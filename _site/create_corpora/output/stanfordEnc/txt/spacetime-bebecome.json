If it is, does time flow or lapse or\npass? Are the future or the past as real as the present? These\nmetaphysical questions have been debated for more than two millennia,\nwith no resolution in sight. Modern physics provides us, however, with\ntools that enable us to sharpen these old questions and generate new\narguments. Does the special theory of relativity, for example, show\nthat there is no temporal passage or that the future is as real as the\npresent? The focus of this entry will be on these new insights into\nthose old questions. \n\nAround 500 B. C. Heraclitus wrote the following:  \nYou cannot step twice into the same river, for other waters and yet\nothers, go flowing on. \nTime is a child, moving counters in a game; the royal power is a\n child’s.[1] \nTransience is basic, and the present is primary. Those things which\nexist now do not abide. They slip into the past and non-existence,\ndevoured by time, as all experience attests.  \nA generation or so later we have a classic statement of the opposing\nview by Parmenides: \nPermanence is basic. No things come to be or, slipping into the past,\ncease to be. Past, present, and future are distinctions not marked in\nthe static Is. Time and becoming are at best secondary, at worst\nillusory, as our understanding of the world confirms.  \nTurn now to modern times and to a paragraph in Rudolf Carnap’s\nintellectual autobiography (Carnap 1963, pp. 37–38): \nThis difference as expressed here between Einstein and Carnap (that\nis, between the Heraclitean and Parmenidean attitude towards time and\nchange) is the subject of this article, which will use modern \nphysics—especially modern spacetime theory—as a set of lenses\nthrough which it is hoped the riddles of time will come into sharper\nfocus. There are many ways, however, to approach these questions.\nEarly in the twentieth century, Anglo-American philosophy turned to\nconsideration of language as a way to clarify philosophical disputes.\nPhilosophers of time debated the relative primacy of tensed language\n(concerning the notions of present, past, and future) or tenseless\nlanguage (concerning the relations of simultaneity and temporal\nprecedence). Our considerations of physics will generally, though not\ncompletely, skirt linguistic disputes. The reader interested in\nfollowing these debates can find a useful introduction in the entry on\n time,\n a classic presentation in Gale (1968), and a review and discussion in\nTooley (1999).  \nOther philosophers have been influenced by analogies between time and\nmodality. The reader interested in this way of thinking about time\nshould consult the article on\n temporal logic.\n The present article will focus on time in physics and the relations\nbetween time and space. Other philosophical approaches focus on the\nprimacy of experience in our understanding of time. The reader\ninterested in these approaches may wish to consult the entry\n the experience and perception of time. \nModern physical theories are often formulated in a language that\npermits one to express a variety of different views with respect to\ntime and its relation to space. One can, for example, formulate the\nbasic ideas of classical (that is, Newtonian) physics, the special\ntheory of relativity, and the general theory of relativity in this\nlanguage. For a brief introduction to manifolds and the spacetime\nview, see the section on\n modern spacetime theories\n in the entry on\n the hole argument\n in this Encyclopedia. For more detail with minimal technical demands\nthe reader should see the first four chapters of Geroch (1978) or the\nmore demanding chapter 2 of Friedman (1983).  \nFor our purposes, the defining feature of a manifold that is a\nNewtonian spacetime is that the temporal interval between any two\npoints or events in the spacetime, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), is a\nwell-defined quantity. This quantity is well-defined in that it does\nnot depend upon point of view, reference frame, coordinate system or\n“observer”. This quantity, then, is absolute in\nthe sense of being frame- or observer-independent. (In the special\ntheory of relativity the temporal interval between two distinct\nspacetime points fails to be absolute in this sense.) \nIf the temporal interval between two events is 0, then we say that the\ntwo events are simultaneous. This relation of (absolute)\nsimultaneity is an equivalence relation (That is, it is reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive.) that slices (partitions or foliates) the\nspacetime or manifold into mutually exclusive and exhaustive planes of\nsimultaneity. These planes of simultaneity can then be completely\nordered by the relation ‘is earlier than’ or its converse\n‘is later than’. \nThe geometrical structure of Newtonian spacetime reflects the way we\nordinarily think about time and is the proper backdrop for introducing\nthe three major rival metaphysical views of time, as illustrated\nbelow: Figure 1. Three Metaphysics of Time \nThe first view, represented on the left, is the ontologically austere\nview called presentism, the view that only the present\nexists. The past has been but is no longer, while the future will come\nto be but is not yet. Note that it is the convention of these diagrams\nthat one spatial dimension is suppressed. The present is actually a\nthree dimensional global slice of the spacetime. Moreover, the\nillustration necessarily represents the spatial extent of the present\nas finite and may suggest that time also has a beginning and/or end.\nThese views are, however, merely artifacts of the representation and\nnot integral to presentism, possibilism, or eternalism. The diagram\nillustrating presentism also has four arrows pointing towards the top\nof the page (conventionally taken to represent the future direction)\nattached to the plane representing the present. These arrows are meant\nto indicate something that is integral to presentism, the idea that\nthe present (and hence the existent) constantly shifts or changes.\nThese arrows represent, then, the dynamic aspect of time called\ntemporal becoming or passage. It is widely thought\nthat the deepest problems in the metaphysics of time concern the\nunderstanding of passage or temporal becoming and its relation to\nexistence. \nIn contrast to the radical Heraclitean view of presentism, the\nParmenidean eternalist picture on the far right lacks these arrows and\nindicates that there is no more special about the temporal present\n(the now) than the spatial present (the here).\nFuture and past events at a place, on this view, are no more or less\nreal than distant events at a time. The now like the\nhere is a function of one’s perspective, one’s\nposition in the spacetime, and these positions are indicated by the\nline in the spacetime representing the history of spacetime locations\nof a particular object or person. Such a line is often called a\nworld line. \nThe middle view, possibilism, is indeed an intermediate view. It is a\npassage view, but it is less ontologically sparse than presentism.\nWhile on this view the future is still merely possible rather than\nactual (hence its name), the past has become and is fully actual. If\none thinks of the future as a branching structure of alternative\npossibilities (as the result, for instance, of free human choices or\nindeterministic quantum measurements), then one can think of the past\nand present as the trunk of that tree, growing as possibilities become\nactual in the present. This view is also known as the growing\nblock view. \nPossibilism seems to capture much of the way we think about time and\nbeing. While the sparse symmetry of presentism is attractive, there\nare many deep asymmetries concerning past and future that it fails to\nreflect. I can easily ascertain, for instance, yesterday’s\nclosing number for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but by no\nefforts, however great, can I now ascertain tomorrow’s close.\nAnd it seems as if my future actions (or certain sorts of quantum\nmeasurements) can actualize some future possibilities as opposed to\nothers, whereas past actions (or the results of past quantum\nmeasurements) seem no longer to admit of past alternatives. Even if\none allows for the possibility of retrocausation, that is, for the\npossibility of an effect preceding its cause in time, it is generally\nheld that a present cause can not change or alter the past. It would\nmerely make the past what it was. (See the entry on\n backwards causation\n for further consideration of this topic.) \nEternalism too, prima facie, would seem to have trouble\naccounting for the asymmetries built into possibilism, while also\napparently bearing the burden of an implausible denial of passage. But\nthe first topic to which we shall turn is an argument, prominent in\ntwentieth century philosophy of time, that passage or becoming is a\nself-contradictory idea. If the argument is correct, then neither\npresentism nor possibilism can be correct metaphysical views of time\nand being. \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, J. M. E. McTaggart (1908)\npresented an argument which purported to prove that time is unreal.\nAccording to McTaggart (1927, pp. 9–10): \nThe first structure of “positions in time,” McTaggart\ncalled the B-series. I will assume that McTaggart intended\nthe B-series to coincide with the Newtonian spacetime structure\ndescribed above. McTaggart noted that there was something static or\n“permanent” about the B-series. If, for example, event\n\\(e_1\\) is earlier than event \\(e_2\\) at\nsome time or other, then one may truly assert that\n\\(e_1\\) is earlier than \\(e_2\\) at all\ntimes. \nThe dynamic element of time must be represented, in McTaggart’s\nview, by the series of properties of pastness, presentness, and\nfuturity, which (in contrast to the static B-series) are constantly\nchanging. A given event becomes less future, becomes present, and then\nbecomes increasingly past. This latter ever-shifting series McTaggart\ncalled the A-series. \nWhile there are many obscurities in McTaggart’s writing, it\nseems clear that his argument that time is unreal runs along the\nfollowing lines: \nThe contradiction alleged by McTaggart is that: \nNear the end of a career in which he spent much time and effort in\nthinking about McTaggart’s argument, C. D. Broad (1959, p. 765)\nwrote: \nBroad’s claim (a) was vindicated by the fact that\nMcTaggart’s argument has received serious attention from most\nsubsequent philosophers who pondered the metaphysics of time. Much of\nthis debate concerns the relative relations of the two series. Is the\nA-series fundamental and the B-series derived from it, or vice versa;\nor does, perhaps, one series supervene upon the other? In the formal\nmode, the questions become whether the B-series may somehow be reduced\nto, may be defined in terms of, the A-series (or vice versa). These\ndebates concern mainly language rather than physics and will not be\nconsidered\n here.[2] \nWhat emerges from the McTaggart literature is, first of all, a\ntendency to identify the existence of passage or temporal becoming\nwith the existence of the A-series (that is, to think of becoming as\nevents changing their properties of pastness, presentness or nowness,\nand futurity) and hence the tendency for debates about the existence\nof passage to focus on the merits or incoherence of the A-series\nrather than examining alternative accounts of becoming. (But Cf.\nFitzgerald, 1985) \nThere is a contrary tendency amongst those philosophers who take\nmodern physics seriously to be sceptical of entities like constantly\nshifting temporal properties of events, since such properties play no\nrole in modern physical theory. One view, defended by Paul Horwich\n(1987, Chapter 2) and Huw Mellor (1981, 1998), is that even though\nMcTaggart showed that the A-series is impossible, the B-series (that\nis, static classical spacetime structure) suffices for time. \nBefore we expand on this theme, though, first a few words about\nBroad’s (b), his suspicion that there is some peculiarity of our\nlanguage(s) that creates or at least reinforces the credibility of\nMcTaggart’s anti-passage argument. Broad suspected that there\nwas a subtle ambiguity in the copula ‘is’ between tensed\nand tenseless uses, between the uses in, for instance: \nIt is raining\n \nand  \nSeven is prime,\n \nthe former sentence containing a tensed and the latter sentence a\nnon-tensed or tenseless copula. It has been further suggested (Sellars\n1962) that one might understand a non-tensed copula (indicated by\n‘be’ rather than ‘is’) after the following\nfashion  \n\\(S\\) be \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) iff \\((S\\) was \\(F\\)\nat \\(t\\) or \\(S\\) is \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) or \\(S\\)\nwill be \\(F\\) at \\(t)\\),\n \nwhere the verbs to the right of the ‘iff’ (a\nlogician’s abbreviation for ‘if and only if’) are\nusual tensed verbs.  \nAlternatively, one might think of a tenseless copula as the usual\ncopula stripped of temporal information (Quine, 1960, p. 170, Mellor\n1981, 1998, Chapter 7), just as the usual copula carries no spatial\ninformation. If we indicate this tenseless copula by writing\n‘BE’ instead of ‘is,’ we can say that\n‘It BE windy in Chicago’ carries information about the\nplace but not the time of the wind, just as ‘It BE windy at\nt’ tells us about its time but not its place. \nThese distinctions will prove helpful in the subsequent discussion of\nbecoming in modern physics. For the moment, one might note that Broad\ncould argue that McTaggart’s (A1) seems plausible if\nthe copula is understood in some tenseless fashion, whereas\n(A2) is plausible if the copula is tensed. If, however, the\ncopula is not univocal in (A1) and (A2), then\nthere is no contradiction involved in accepting both (Savitt,\n2001). \nThe claim that the copula is ambiguous (or more precisely, polysemous)\nhas also been thought to have some implications for the metaphysical\ndispute between presentism and the two non-presentist views sketched\nabove. A number of authors (Meyer (2005), Savitt (2006), Dorato\n(2006), Lombard (2010). See Dolev (2007) for a different\nanti-ontological argument.) have argued that in order for there to be\na genuine difference between these allegedly distinct metaphysical\nviews, in addition to the suggestive pictures displayed above there\nmust be some univocal statement or proposition concerning temporal\nontology that one side asserts and the other side denies. When the\npolysemy of the copula (or of the verb ‘to exist’) is\ntaken into account, it has proven very difficult to find a clear\nexample of such a statement or proposition. (Putnam (2008), by the\nway, has recently joined these critics: “[T]he question whether\nthe past and future are ‘real’ is a\npseudo-question.”) \nAccording to one author (Sider, 2006), there seems to be disagreement\nconcerning the following assertion: dinosaurs exist. Presentists are\nunderstood to deny this claim, while eternalists are supposed to\naffirm it. If those who endorse the claim understand the verb\n‘exist’ to be tenseless and those who deny it take\n‘exist’ to be a present tense verb, then both sides seem\nto endorse correct claims. There is in this instance, however, no\nunivocal statement that is being disputed, since ‘exist’\nis understood differently by the two sides. This observation has led\nmany to try to state a version of presentism that is neither trivial\nnor obviously false and to locate precisely the point at which it\ndiffers from non-presentist views. (See Crisp (2004a,b), Ludlow\n(2005), Wüthrich (2012), Golosz (2013). Tallant (2013) reviews\nseveral such efforts negatively and adds one of his own.) \nThe few authors that have approached this debate from a linguistic\nperspective differ on the behaviour of the verb ‘exist’.\nLudlow (2005) considers both a tensed and a tenseless verb; Stoneham\n(2009) is sceptical with regard to tenseless predication; and Moltmann\n(2013) considers ‘exist’ only as a present tense verb. It\nis worth noting that he claims that ‘exist’ functions\nquite differently from ‘there are’ in that the latter can\nbe used to quantify over past, merely possible, and intensional\nentities whereas the former can not. If his claim is correct, then a\ncommon test sentence for the difference between eternalists and\npresentists introduced in Sider (2006)--There exist dinosaurs--seems\nalmost purpose-built to breed confusion. \nIf McTaggart’s argument that passage is conceptually absurd or\nself-contradictory fails, philosophers mindful of modern physics are\nstill left with Einstein’s concern that passage and the now,\nwhile deeply embedded in human experience, seem to find no place in\nphysics. One may agree with Carnap above that “all that occurs\nobjectively can be described in science” and then argue that\npassage reflects something perspectival or subjective and so is\nrightly omitted by physics. \nThe most popular version of this view holds that now is a\ntoken-reflexive or indexical term, like here (Smart 1963,\nchapter VII; Mellor 1981, 1998). Physics is not felt to be incomplete\nbecause it fails to treat hereness. Why should its\nindifference to nowness be of any greater concern? \nEarly proponents of this view often claimed that ‘\\(S\\) is\nnow \\(F\\)’ meant ‘\\(S\\)’s being \\(F\\)\nis simultaneous with this utterance,’ a quite implausible claim.\nA more sophisticated version of the view is that the truth-conditions\nof sentences like ‘\\(S\\) is now \\(F\\)’ can be\ngiven solely in terms of the (tenseless) facts that exist or events\nthat occur at the time of the utterance or inscription of the given\nsentence. One can treat past and future in a similar\nfashion. \nSmart claimed that excessive attention to the tensed notions of\nnow, past, and future serve to project a “sort\nof anthropocentric idea on the universe at large.”(1963, 132)\nBut even if the tensed temporal locutions are anthropocentric and do\nlocate us in the universe, it may still be asked whether\nthese temporal locations are in a static structure, “a\nfour-dimensional continuum of spacetime entities,” (132) or in\nan unfolding or dynamic universe. Smart dismisses this latter view\nbecause, in his view, it involves the obscure or mistaken idea that\nevents “become” or “come into existence.”\nBecoming and passage are mistakes, in his view, and harmful ones at\nthat. Smart writes: “Our notion of time as flowing, the\ntransitory aspect of time as Broad has called it, is an illusion which\nprevents us seeing the world as it really is” (132). \nIt will be useful to untangle a couple of ideas that are confounded in\nthese quotes from Smart, with the help of some arguments of (mostly)\nBroad’s (1938, section 1.22 of Chapter 35). First is the idea\nthat time “flows” or, more generally, that passage is\nsomehow to be thought of as like motion. Perhaps time itself somehow\nmoves. Or perhaps, as Broad wrote in a famous passage (1923, 59): \nThis picture of passage has come to be called the moving\nspotlight view, or just the moving\n NOW.[3] \nMotion is one sort of change, change of spatial position with respect\nto time. The motion of time, then, must be change of time with respect\nto … What? If the answer, by analogy with motion, is\n“time”, one might be rightly puzzled as to how time (or\nanything else, for that matter) can change with respect to\nitself. Furthermore, if it is just time again, then the ratio of\nthese two quantities expressing the rate of change is a pure or\ndimensionless number if the dimensions of the quantities in this ratio\ncancel. (See Price 1996, p. 13.) A pure number is not a rate of\nchange, although it may represent various rates of change (for\ninstance, 30 meters/second or 30 miles/hour). As Price remarks,\n“We might just as well say that the ratio of the circumference\nof a circle to its diameter flows at \\(\\pi\\) seconds per\nsecond!” \nTim Maudlin (2007) has replied to Price that the rate of one second\nper second is a perfectly fine rate. Consider, he says, a fair\nexchange rate (based, say, on purchasing power parity) for currencies.\nThe fair exchange rate for the British pound might, at some time, be\n1.52 US dollars per pound. Similarly, Maudlin observes that the fair\nexchange rate for the US dollar with respect to itself must be 1 US\ndollar per US dollar. “If you think that this answer is\nmeaningless,” Maudlin writes, “imagine your reaction to an\noffer of exchange at any other rate” (2007, 112). \nPrice (2011) has replied to Maudlin by abandoning the claim that the\nunits in “one second per second” cancel, leaving a pure\nnumber. He now insists, rather, that a ratio of a quantity to itself\ncan not be a rate at all. Maudlin’s example only seems to evade\nthis point by supposing a ratio of dollars offered to dollars\nreturned. That ratio differs, as he sees it, in an essential way from\nthe ratio of one second to one second or, for that matter, from the\nratio of one mile to one mile, which are both ratios of quantities to\nthemselves. Neither in his view can be a rate, and the former ratio is\nno more characteristic of time than the latter ratio is of space. (See\nalso Markosian (1993), Olson (2009), Raven (2010), and Skow\n(2012).) \nIf (in order to avoid the apparent collapse of a ratio or rate into a\npure number) the time in the denominator of the ratio expressing the\nrate of time’s motion is held to be a different temporal\ndimension from the one in the numerator, then for it to be a genuine\ntime there will have to be passage in it, requiring yet a third\ntemporal dimension. One can see that we are at the beginning of an\ninfinite regress, unless the third temporal dimension is identified\nwith the first (as in Schlesinger 1980, Chapter II), leaving us in the\nuncomfortable position of having two temporal dimensions. It seems at\nbest heroic, at worst hopeless, to try to understand passage as a kind\nof motion. \nBroad also thought that trying to explain or represent passage in\nterms of qualitative change was “doomed to failure.” A\nthing or substance, \\(S\\), can change in terms of a quality or\nproperty if property \\(P_1\\) and property \\(P_2\\) are determinates\nunder a given determinable and \\(S\\) is \\(P_1\\) at \\(t_1\\) but \\(P_2\\)\nat \\(t_2\\). The passage of time, then, is to be thought of as an\nevent’s having (say) the property of presentness and then\nimmediately losing that property but gaining (and losing in turn) a\nlong and possibly endless series of properties of the increasing\ndegrees of pastness. \nIn order for a thing to change from having \\(P_1\\) at \\(t_1\\) to\nhaving \\(P_2\\) at \\(t_2\\) it must evidently persist at least from\n\\(t_1\\) to \\(t_2\\), but the events usually supposed in discussions of\npassage are instantaneous events, which have no duration at all. They\ncan not undergo qualitative change. It is sometimes argued that the\nproperties that make up the A-series (and so change of which\nrepresents passage) are special properties, which even instantaneous\nevents can gain and lose, but this is special pleading. As noted\nabove, physics has so far no need of such special properties and such\nspecial change and so is unlikely to be sympathetic to this special\npleading. \nFinally, Broad notes that (assuming one wishes to think of passage as\nlike qualitative change) the acquisition and loss of (say) presentness\nby an event would itself be an event, a second-order event, in the\nhistory of a first-order event. Since the first-order events are, by\nhypothesis, durationless, it is tempting to suppose that this history\ntakes place in a second temporal dimension. We find ourselves again\nlaunched on what looks to be an infinite regress of temporal\ndimensions. \nThese are strong arguments against two perennially tempting ways to\nconstrue temporal becoming—as like motion or qualitative\nchange. They are strong arguments against the existence of temporal\nbecoming if there is no other way to understand it. Broad thought,\nhowever, that he had a third way. Having pointed out the superficial\ngrammatical similarity between ‘\\(E\\) became louder’\nand ‘\\(E\\) became present’, Broad said that our\nunderstanding of these two kinds of assertions need not be dictated by\nit. He wrote (1938, p. 280–1): \nThe terminology may be pretentious, but the idea is simple. Absolute\nbecoming is just the happening of events. The raison\nd’être, the very being or existence of events, is in\ntheir happening (at some place and time). If one is willing to embrace\nthis category of entity at all, then one has the tools for a\nminimalist understanding of passage. Given the geometric richness of\nNewtonian spacetime, we can say that some events occur at the same\ntime and so form a class of simultaneous events. These classes can be\nordered by their times, so we can say that some events occur before or\nafter others. The passage of time is then just the successive\nhappening of (simultaneity sets of)\n events.[4]\n It may be this picture of passage that the great logician Kurt\nGödel had in mind when he wrote (1949, p. 558): “The\nexistence of an objective lapse of time … means (or, at least,\nis equivalent to the fact) that reality consists of an infinity of\nlayers of ‘now’ which come into existence\nsuccessively.” \nThere is an ambiguity in this last quote, however, that we must note.\nDid Gödel think that the layers of now come into existence (as\nwhat is to be becomes what is now) and then immediately cease to exist\n(as what is now becomes what once was), which is the presentist\nmetaphysics of time? Or did he think that the layers of now come into\nexistence and forever stay in existence, as the possibilist picture\nmaintains? If one’s basic ontology consists of the sort of\nevents characterized above and often invoked in discussions of time,\n(idealized) instantaneous happenings, then the presentist picture\nseems inevitable. \nThe metaphysics of time is, however, one of the cross-roads of\nphilosophy where issues intersect. If one thinks of a basic ontology\nconsisting not of events but of substances or continuants, then one is\napt to wonder what it is that makes sentences marking episodes in the\nhistories of such substances—sentences like ‘\\(S\\)\nis \\(\\Phi\\) at \\(t\\)’—true. One frequent suggestion is\nthat the “truth-makers” of such sentences are facts, the\nfact that at \\(t\\), \\(S\\) is \\(\\Phi\\). Then one might\nfurther note that in the current year, 2001, we can say: \nThese facts, when compared to evanescent events, seem to have great\nstability, the first one lasting (since it is a fact\n…) at least from 1980 till the present. The third one is,\nhowever, a special sort of fact, clearly not dependent on human will\nor choice and almost certainly not dependent upon any quantum\nmeasurements either. Future facts that do depend upon human choice or\nquantum measurement, should they be facts now, would seem to constrain\nhuman choice or quantum measurement in ways that many philosophers\nfind undesirable. It is easy to convince oneself, then, that future\nfacts of those two sorts can not really be part of the existing.\nPerhaps, then, facts like fact 3 above can be argued away as well. The\nresult of this (lightly sketched) train of thought is, of course, the\npossibilist picture of time. \nIt seems unlikely that a simple argument will decide between these two\nmetaphysical pictures of time, presentism and possiblism. Showing that\nMcTaggart’s argument is flawed, because it relies on an\nambiguity in the copula ‘is’, and that there is a way to\nconstrue passage that side-steps the traditional objections, moreover,\ndoes not show that eternalism is false but only that it is optional.\nIn Newtonian spacetime it may appear implausible, but it may fare\nbetter when we turn to Minkowski spacetime. \nThe Special Theory of Relativity (Einstein, 1905) was presented as a\ngeometric theory of spacetime in Minkowski\n (1908).[5]\n For our purposes, the key change from Newtonian spacetime to\nMinkowski spacetime is that in the latter it is no longer the case\nthat the temporal interval between any two points or events in the\nspacetime, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), is a well-defined quantity. In\nfact, the temporal interval between two points in the spacetime (and\nhence the simultaneity of two points in the spacetime) is not defined\nat all until a coordinate system or frame of reference (with some\narbitrarily chosen spacetime point as origin of the frame) is chosen.\nA peculiar feature of special relativity (as opposed Newtonian\nphysics) is that each inertial frame defined by an\n“observer” passing through the chosen origin and moving\nwith some constant non-zero velocity that is less than the speed of\nlight (the only coordinate systems or frames of reference that will be\nconsidered in our discussion of the special theory) picks out a\ndistinct set of points as simultaneous with the origin. This\nfeature of special relativity is called the relativity of\nsimultaneity. \nThe relativity of simultaneity is a consequence of two startling\nassumptions. First, each of these “observers”, no matter\nat what (subluminal) speed or in which direction they or the source of\nthe light are moving (as long as neither the speed nor the directions\nchange), must come to the same result (conventionally indicated as\n\\(c)\\) when they measure the speed of light. We will not attempt\nto justify the assumption of the constancy of the speed of light here,\nthough many standard texts present the empirical and theoretical\nbackground that led to it. Nor is it obvious that this assumption\nleads to the relativity of simultaneity, though one of the joys of\neven elementary presentations of the subject is that this prima\nfacie astonishing connection can be convincingly demonstrated to\npersistent non-specialists. \nThe second assumption typically made in presentations of the special\ntheory is the Principle of Relativity: All inertial frames\nare completely equivalent for the formulation of the laws of\n physics.[6] \nA glance back at Figure 1 reminds us that presentism and possibilism\nsuppose that one plane of simultaneity is uniquely metaphysically\nimportant. In the former view, it represents all that exists. In the\nlatter view, it is the locus of becoming, the dividing line between\nthe merely possible future and the actual past-plus-present. The\nspecial theory of relativity tells us that there is an infinity of\nplanes of simultaneity passing through any given spacetime point and\nthat no physical test can distinguish one from amongst the lot. What\nwas metaphysically distinguished is now physically indistinguishable.\nAssuming that we humans are complex physical systems, then we have no\nway to distinguish the present from amongst the multitude of\npresents. \nAn enthusiast could make much of this fact. For instance, the\nmathematician (and science fiction writer) Rudy Rucker wrote (1984, p.\n149): \nOn the other hand, the distinguished philosopher and logician Arthur\nPrior thought that the above conclusion showed that special relativity\nis an incomplete view of reality (Prior,\n 1970):[7] \nWe shall look at more nuanced reactions to the relativity of\nsimultaneity below, but first it will be useful to introduce an\nargument that plays somewhat the same role in Minkowski spacetime as\nMcTaggart’s argument did in Newtonian spacetime. Versions of the\nargument are endorsed in papers by the physicist Wim Rietdijk (1966,\n1976) and the philosopher Hilary Putnam (1967), but the presentation\nhere will be based on an example found in Roger Penrose’s book,\nThe Emperor’s New Mind.  \nImagine that the Andromeda galaxy, which is about two million light\nyears or \\(2\\times 10^{19}\\) kilometers from Earth, is at rest\nwith respect to Earth. On Earth two friends walk past each other,\nAlice walking along the Earth-Andromeda line towards Andromeda, Bob\nwalking along that line but away from Andromeda. Each is walking at a\ncomfortable pace, say 4 km/hour. One can calculate that their planes\n(or spaces) of simultaneity at the instant at which they pass each\nother on Earth (Call the event of their meeting \\(\\mathbf{O})\\)\nintersect the history or world line of Andromeda about 5\n¾ days apart. (Call these two events \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), respectively. We are idealizing Andromeda as a\npoint, for the purpose of this example.) Imagine, finally, that during\nthis 5 ¾ day period between \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) a momentous thing happens. The Andromedeans launch\na space fleet aimed at invading Earth. Figure 2. The Andromedean Invasion \nThe launch of the invading fleet is prior to \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and so\nin some sense in Alice’s past. But since the launch is\nafter \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), it is in that same sense in Bob’s\nfuture. Penrose comments: \nThis is an odd situation indeed. An event in Bob’s future seems\nin some way to become fixed or inevitable by being in Alice’s\npast. But that is not the end of the oddness here. Imagine that at\npoint \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) (where Alice’s plane of simultaneity\nintersects the world line of Andromeda) there is an Andromedean,\nCarol, who is walking directly towards Earth at about 4 km/hour. Then\nCarol’s plane of simultaneity intersects Earth at some point\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) which is about 11 ½ days after\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\), the meeting of Alice and Bob. If all events (like\n\\(\\mathbf{A})\\) in Alice’s past or present at\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\) have happened, are fixed, or are real, then the\nprinciple of relativity (the second assumption of the special theory\nintroduced above) suggests that we must also extend the same courtesy\nto Carol; and so simultaneous with the fixed and real event\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) (Carol’s walking towards Earth at exactly the\npoint at which Alice’s plane of simultaneity intersects the\nhistory of Andromeda) is the event \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) (and so fixed\nand real), the intersection of Carol’s plane of simultaneity\nwith Earth, which is in the future of both Alice and Bob. It\nis easy to see that, by adjusting the speeds of Alice and Carol, any\nevent to the future of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) can be shown to be fixed or\nreal or inevitable. But \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) itself was just an\narbitrarily chosen point in the spacetime. “It begins to seem\nthat if anything is definite at all,” we might echo Penrose,\n“then the entire space-time must indeed be definite! There can\nbe no ‘uncertain’ future.” (p. 304)  \nRoberto Torretti (1983, p. 249) calls the resulting view of the\ndefiniteness or fixity of all events in the spacetime\nchronogeometrical determinism. A slightly better name might\nbe chronogeometrical fatalism, as we will see below. In order\nto see more clearly, however, what has gone wrong in the argument\nabove, it will be useful first to look more closely at the problems\nattendant upon trying to import our commonsense or classical\nintuitions about time into the understanding of Minkowski spacetime\nand then to describe briefly the structures peculiar to that spacetime\nitself. To begin with the first task, one of the most notable attempts\nto bring our time into Minkowski spacetime is to be found in Sellars\n(1962), a determined attempt by one of the most profound systematic\nmetaphysicians of the latter half of the 20th century. \n\n Wilfrid Sellars\n believed that the various invariant or observer-independent\nelements of Minkowski spacetime (like the light cone structure to be\ndescribed below) that are typically given primary consideration in\ntreatments of relativity from a spacetime perspective are abstractions\nfrom and secondary to the ‘perspectival’ pictures or\nperspectives, the myriad of inertial systems or reference\nframes. When it comes to time, however, he believed that there is\nsomething even more fundamental than these perspectives: \nWhile there is in Sellars’ paper a lengthy and illuminating\nseries of reflections on the relation between events, facts, and\nsubstances, there is no guidance offered on the relation between a\nmoment’s being present with respect to a given perspective and a\nmoment’s simply being present, a concept which is ill-defined\nfrom a relativistic point of view. If this latter is indeed an\nessential feature of a temporal picture of the world, then it would\nseem that special relativity does not provide us with a temporal\npicture of the world. If on the other hand the world is\nfundamentally temporal in the way that Sellars insists it must be,\nthen (at least as far a special relativity as a representation of that\nworld is concerned), Sellars’ famous scientific realism is\ncompromised.  \nThere are some useful lessons to learn from the failure of this\nattempt to import pre-relativistic temporal categories into Minkowski\nspacetime. First, Sellars is careful to distinguish between events as\nthings that happen or occur or take place and the ‘events’\n(the use of single quotes is Sellars’) that are basic in\nrelativity. The latter are just spacetime points. They do not take\nplace or occur, and they are not the relata in causal relations,\nwhereas events are. (But cf. Tooley (1997, Chapter 9))  \nSellars also presents a distinction between what he calls (p. 586)\ncategorial existence statements and what, for lack of a\nbetter term, I will call non-categorial existence statements.\nThe former invoke frameworks, like the framework of substances or the\nframework of ‘events’, the frameworks that Sellars takes\ngreat pains to compare in his essay. He is inclined towards a view he\nattributes to Carnap (1950) that to say that, for instance,\n‘Things exist’ is to make the categorial, metalinguistic\nclaim that there are thing words in our language L now. This use of\n‘exist,’ claims Sellars, has no (future or past) tensed\ncontrast. \nNon-categorial existence statements, on the other hand, assert the\nexistence of individuals or less general kinds in a fully tensed\nfashion. Sellars would construe them in the following way (p.\n592): \nLeaving aside Sellars’ idiosyncratic way of construing existence\nstatements, if a distinction between categorial and non-categorial\nexistence claims can be made, then it would be perfectly coherent to\nindicate that one is adopting or working in the framework of\n‘events’ by asserting that ‘events exist’\n(tenselessly, in the categorial sense) without being committed to the\n“tenseless existence” of particular events which may be\npast, present, or future (in the non-categorial sense).  \nIt has sometimes been thought that commitment to a spacetime\nframework, as is often explicit in treatments of special (and general)\nrelativity, is tantamount to commitment to eternalism, since to say\nthat spacetime points exist seems inconsistent with saying that some\nspacetime points are future and so do not exist yet or are past and so\nexist no longer. If some distinction of the type just\nsketched can be made between categorial and non-categorial existence\nstatements, then eternalism is not a straightforward consequence of\nadopting the spacetime\n viewpoint.[8] \nGranting Sellars all the distinctions that he wishes, however, does\nnot give him the tools to avoid the central problem sketched above.\nSince the problem is, in one form or another, the problem that any\nview that tries to define a notion of temporal becoming in Minkowski\nspacetime must address, it is worth examining it a bit more closely.\nSellars wrote (p. 591): \nIn this quote Sellars is using the term ‘topological’\nwhere one would now normally use the term ‘geometric’, and\nhe is forcefully reiterating his view that the spacetime manifold of\n‘events’ is merely an abstraction from the infinity of\ndistinct primary now-pictures of individual observers.  \nThe first question one will surely want to ask about this view is: how\ncan an infinity of distinct “now-pictures” each\nbe primary? No answer is forthcoming. The second, and more troubling\nquestion, is: how can this infinity of distinct\n“now-pictures” be related to the traditional metaphysical\nviews under discussion? What, in short, is the connection (if any)\nbetween the temporal notions implicit in each of the pictures and\nexistence of the past, present, and future? The striking fact about\nSellars’ schema above for ‘a be existent\nnow’ is that it is not relativized to a\nreference frame, inertial system or “perspective” and so\nis not meaningful relativistically. The definition gives us no\nguidance as to how to parcel out existence to elements in the infinity\nof inertial frames that are admissible at a spacetime point. \nIf the definition or schema above were relativized to inertial frames\n\\(F, F'\\), etc., so as to connect existence to\nrelativistically acceptable “primary now-pictures”, its\ninterpretation would be either unhelpful or mysterious. Consider the\nfollowing modification of Sellars’ schema above: \n\\(a\\) be existent now in \\(F \\equiv\\)\n\n\\( \\exists x(x\\) be now in \\(F\\)\nand \\(x\\) be\n\\(\\Phi_1 ,\\ldots \\Phi_n\\)\nand\n\n \n‘\\(\\Phi_1\\)’,…,‘\\(\\Phi_n\\)’\nbe our criteria now for ‘\\(a\\)’)\n \nSuppose it is not the case that \\(a\\) be existent now in\nsome other frame \\(F'\\). It seems as if this difference\nmust result from \\(a\\)’s being simultaneous with some\nspacetime point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), say, in \\(F\\) while not being\nsimultaneous with the same point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) in\n\\(F'\\). But on this reading Sellars’ schema is just a\nround-about way to indicate that simultaneity is relative—the\npoint of departure for our metaphysical questions rather than the\nanswer to any.  \nThe schema looks as if it is meant to do something more, to connect\ntemporal notions to existence. But if so, how is existence relative to\na frame to be understood? Classical presentism, for instance, wishes\nto identify existence with present existence or existence\nnow. Since the present is relativized to frames in special\nrelativity, may not existence be relativized to frames as well? This\nis a difficult notion to understand or accept. Kurt Gödel (1949,\np. 558) said flatly, “The concept of existence … cannot\nbe relativized without destroying its meaning completely.” Is\nthe concept of existence, then, like the concept of truth, which, when\nrelativized (as true-for-me, true-for-you), comes to something more\nlike belief than truth? Or is it like simultaneity, about which\nthoughtful persons a century or so ago might have made pronouncements\nmuch like Gödel’s? This difficult and fundamental question\nhas by no means been resolved. \nWere this question resolved in favor of the relativization of\nexistence, what would be the import of a relativized version of\npresentism? It would have to hold that what existed changed radically\nwith one’s state of motion. Certain events (say on Mars or a\nplanet orbiting a distant star) may be existent for you now, sitting\nat your computer screen or reading a printout, but other events will\nreplace those as existent should you decide to walk one way or\nanother. This seems (once again) less like an interesting metaphysical\ninsight than a restatement of the relativity of simultaneity.\nPossibilism is not better off in this regard, for it relies on a\nmetaphysically distinguished present to separate the real from the\npotential. (See the symposium “The Prospects for the Present in\nSpacetime Theories” in Howard (2000) for further arguments and\nreferences.) \nTo sum up, then, Sellars’ attempt to tie existence to temporal\nnotions, when properly relativized, is either a bland re-statement of\nwhat special relativity tells us already about simultaneity or an\nopaque statement about relativized existence. This dilemma confronts\nany attempt to import pre-relativistic temporal notions into Minkowski\nspacetime, such as that in §5.7 of Dolev (2007), though Dolev\nexplicitly eschews ontologizing temporal relations. Let us, then, turn\nto efforts to understand Minkowski spacetime in a different way,\nefforts that will help clarify the puzzling argument about the\nAndromedean invasion presented above. \nWe have said much about the relativity of simultaneity but little\nabout the invariance of the speed of light. We now rectify that\nsituation. \nImagine that at some point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) of the spacetime an\nidealized point-sized flashbulb flashes for (literally) an instant. It\nfollows from the invariance of the speed of light in all directions\nthat Alice, passing through \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) as above, will find\nherself at the center of an expanding sphere of photons. The radius of\nthe sphere expands with speed \\(c\\). (It follows that Bob, also\npassing through \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) but moving with some constant\nvelocity with respect to Alice, must find himself also at the center\nof such a sphere, even though he and Alice are moving away from each\nother. Such is relativistic life!) If we try to diagram this\nsituation, it is helpful to suppress one spatial dimension, as we have\nin all the figures above, and so the two-dimensional cut through the\nexpanding sphere looks like an expanding circle, which becomes a cone\nwhen that growth is plotted vertically up the diagram (and so is\ncalled the light cone.) More precisely, this figure is just\nhalf the light cone. If two photons (restricting ourselves to two\ndimensions now) converged on point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) from opposite\ndirections, the lines indicating their histories would mark the other\nhalf, the past lobe, of the light\n cone.[9] \nLight cones exist at each point of the spacetime and are invariant\nstructures. Since the speed of light is an invariant quantity, all\n“observers” agree as to which points of the spacetime are\nilluminated by the popping of the flashbulb at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\nFurthermore, as special relativity is standardly understood, the speed\nof light is a limiting speed. No material particle can be accelerated\nfrom a speed less than \\(c\\) to a speed equal to or greater than\n\\(c\\). Electromagnetic radiation (including light) always\npropagates in a vacuum at speed \\(c\\). (To see why \\(c\\) is\nheld to be limiting speed, see Mermin (1968, Chapter 15) and Nahin\n(1999, pp. 342–353 and Tech Note 7.) Given these suppositions,\nthe light cone structure divides all spacetime into three distinct\nsorts of regions relative to each spacetime point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\n(See chapters 5 and 6 of Geroch (1978) for a thorough discussion.) Figure 3. The Light Cone  \nFirst, there are the points from which a photon (travelling at speed\n\\(c\\), of course) may reach \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) or which (like\n\\(\\mathbf{A})\\) may be reached by a photon from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\). We say that these points are lightlike\nseparated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). \nSecond, there are the points inside (rather than on) the future or\npast light cone of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). We say that these points are\ntimelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). If\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is a point in the spacetime timelike separated from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and future to it (that is, inside\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\)’s future light cone), then a material\nparticle travelling at some relativistically acceptable speed (that\nis, less than \\(c)\\) can travel from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) to\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Similarly, a material particle at a point like\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) inside the past light cone of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\),\ncan travel at some speed less than \\(c\\) from \\(\\mathbf{C}\\)\nto \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).  \nFinally, there are the points of the spacetime that are neither in nor\non the light cone of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). We say that such points are\nspacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). If\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is spacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\),\nthen neither a light signal nor a material body can travel from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) or vice versa,\nbecause such travel would require superluminal speed. If one makes the\nnatural assumption that information and causal influence are\npropagated by electromagnetic signals and material particles, then if\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is spacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\),\nevents or occurrences at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) can have no causal\ninfluence at all on events at \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), and vice\nversa. \nWe have reached this last conclusion by means of quite straightforward\nreasoning from the invariance of the speed of light. But consider the\nfollowing observation of Torretti (1983, p. 247): \nAs one illustration of how our traditional views of time and causality\nare upset by restricting the propagation of causal influence to the\nlight cone structure, let us revisit the reasoning of the example of\nthe Andromedean invasion that we used to illustrate and motivate\nchronogeometrical fatalism. We may be able to see now that this\nreasoning is not so compelling as it first seemed, and we may be able\nto see why some philosophers have proposed that we look at becoming in\nMinkowski spacetime in a way quite different from the traditional way.\n \nTo make the exposition easier, let us add to the story of the\nAndromedean invasion a fourth “observer”, Ted, who is at\nrest with respect to Earth (and so also Andromeda) at the spot where\nAlice and Bob meet. Ted too defines an inertial frame, and there is a\npoint at Andromeda (We can call it \\(\\mathbf{D})\\) that (in\nTed’s frame) is simultaneous with the meeting of Alice and Bob\nand Ted. To make our exposition easier still, let us suppose that\nAlice and Bob and Ted set their clocks to read 0 at the instant at\nwhich they all\n meet.[10]\n Let us focus on \\(\\mathbf{D}\\). \nTed (at the meeting of Alice and Bob) assigns to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)\nthe time 0, since it is simultaneous (in his frame) with his time 0.\nAlice assigns \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) (roughly) the time \\(-3\\) days,\nwhereas Bob assigns it time (roughly) \\(+3\\) days. \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is,\nof course, spacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), and we have\nbeen at pains to explain that from a special relativistic standpoint\nthis spacelike separation precludes the (physical) possibility that\nthere is any causal influence upon \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) of the events at\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\), or vice versa. Once the labelling of\nspacetime points like \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) with coordinates is complete,\nwhat further content is there, what further could be meant, by adding\nthat for Alice and Ted \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is real or fixed? Or that\nfor Alice it is past whereas for Bob it is future? If there is indeed\nno further content, then what possible implications with regard to\n‘reality’ or ‘fixity’ or\n‘determinateness’ or ‘tense’ can be drawn from\nthe fact that Bob labels this point with a positive number, Alice\nlabels it with a negative number, and Ted labels it with\n 0?[11] \nAny good text in special relativity will sooner or later prove that\nfor any pair of spacelike separated points (but let us\ncontinue to call them \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D})\\) there\nis precisely one admissible inertial frame (with \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) as\norigin) in which \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) are\nsimultaneous, an infinity of admissible inertial frames in which\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is assigned a positive number (that is, in which\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\) occurs before \\(\\mathbf{D})\\), and an infinity\nof other admissible inertial frames in which \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is\nassigned a negative number (that is, in which \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)\noccurs before \\(\\mathbf{O})\\). What metaphysical significance\ncould be gleaned from the fact that some “observers” (the\nusual anthropomorphized way to refer to admissible inertial frames) at\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\) must assign positive times, some negative times,\nand one time 0 to the distant event \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), which, again,\ncan not be influenced by and can not itself influence the events at\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\), according to special relativity at least? \nInability to provide any positive answer to this question can motivate\na different approach to conceptualizing becoming in Minkowski\nspacetime, an approach presented by the philosopher Howard Stein\n(1968, 1991). The basic idea of this approach is to begin from or to\ndefine concepts in terms of the geometric structure intrinsic to the\nspacetime rather than in terms of coordinates. In the present case,\nthis approach leads one to try to define ‘becoming’ in\nterms of spacetime points and light cones. Pre-relativistically,\n‘has become’ is defined relative to a plane of\nsimultaneity. We have seen the limitations of the notion of a plane of\nsimultaneity in special relativity. Stein begins, then, by proposing\nthat one define the relation of ‘having become’ or\n‘already definite’ with respect to spacetime points. A\ntwo-place relation schematically written as \\(Rxy\\) will be\nintended to capture the idea that point \\(y\\) has already become\nor is definite with respect to point \\(x\\). \nThere are two other formal features that this relation \\(R\\)\nshould possess. It should be transitive—that is, if\n\\(z\\) has already become with respect to \\(y\\) and\n\\(y\\) has already become with respect to \\(x\\), then it\nseems reasonable to require that \\(z\\) has already become with\nrespect to \\(x\\). It should also be reflexive—that \nis, is seems reasonable to require that \\(x\\) has become\nwith respect to \\(x\\) itself. (We can indicate these\nconditions briefly as (1) \\(Rzy\\) and \\(Rxz\\) entail\n\\(Rxy\\), for all \\(x, y, z\\) and (2) \\(Rxx\\), for all\n\\(x\\).) \nFinally, Stein proposes that the relation \\(R\\) not hold between\nevery two points in the spacetime. That is, he proposes that given\nsome choice of spacetime point \\(x\\), there is at least one\ndistinct point \\(y\\) that has not become, that is not already\ndefinite, with respect to \\(x\\). But is there any such relation,\nany relation that has all these intuitively desirable characteristics?\nThe answer is yes. The relation is that between a point\n\\(x\\) and each point in or on its past light\n cone.[12]\n If one can accept that the relation \\(Rxy\\) represents in\nspecial relativity the notion of becoming (or, having become), then\nthe existence of the relation specified and found by Stein is a formal\nrefutation of the Rietdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument for chronogeometric\nfatalism. \nIt is this last issue, of course, that is controversial. Stein, who\nwishes to tie his definitions of temporal concepts to intrinsic\ngeometric structure, holds that “in Einstein-Minkowski\nspace-time an event’s present is constituted by itself\nalone.” (1968, p. 15) If one wishes to include even\none other event in an event’s present—that is,\nif one specifies that for each point \\(x\\) there must be one\nother distinct point \\(y\\) such that not only \\(Rxy\\) but\nalso \\(Ryx\\)—then the only relation that satisfies this\ndesideratum and the other conditions specified by Stein is\nthe universal\n relation.[13] \nCallender (2000, S592) remarks that requiring that an event‘s\npresent must contain at least one event distinct from it, which he\ncalls the non-uniqueness condition, “seems the thinnest\nrequirement one might put on becoming.” He would then not accept\nStein’s relation \\(R\\) as representing a genuine relation\nof becoming since it fails to meet this condition, but then he also\nmust accept the conclusion of the Rietdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument,\nsince the only alternative to \\(R\\) is the universal relation. If\none wishes to evade chronogeometric fatalism, as far as the special\ntheory of relativity is concerned, then it seems there is no\nalternative to accepting Stein’s relation \\(R\\) as\nrepresenting a genuine relation of becoming and to considering that an\nevent’s present is constituted by itself alone. It is a truism\nthat the relativistic revolution in physics has profound implications\nfor our concepts of space and time. This last dilemma shows why that\ntruism is true. \nThere may seem to be an insuperable obstacle to accepting\nStein’s relation \\(R\\) as representing a genuine relation\nof becoming. \\(R\\) is supposed to represent becoming, but the\nlight cone structure of Minkowski spacetime, in terms of which it is\ndefined, is inert. This reaction was voiced, for instance, by Palle\nYourgrau, who wrote that “Stein’s mistake is to adduce a\nstructural property as what ‘justifies the use of our\nnotion of ”becoming“ in relativistic\nspacetime.”’ (1999, p. 77) If Yourgrau has put his finger\non a “mistake”, then it is a “mistake” at the\nvery heart of Stein’s effort. There are, however, a few remarks\nto be made on this score. \nFirst, there have been attempts to articulate positions like\nStein’s that try to account for passage in terms of geometric\nstructure and that seem to incorporate more dynamic elements,\nexploiting the fact that persistent objects or substances (including\n“observers”) are represented by timelike world lines,\nrather than by points. The mathematician G. J. Whitrow (1980, p. 348)\nwrote: \nThe physicist-philosopher Abner Shimony, in responding to the claim\nthat special relativity shows that becoming is subjective or\n“mind-dependent,” wrote (1993, p. 284):  \nIn the felicitous phrase of Park (1971), we have here two different\nsorts of animated Minkowski diagrams. Each seems to involve a\nkind of motion, of the light cone or of the transient now\nadvancing along a world line. Our initial restrictions on accounts of\ntransience inspired by Broad’s arguments above, however, should\nmake us wary of invoking motion to account for passage. Park,\nmoreover, sees no benefit to adding the animation.  \nThe non-animated Minkowski diagram may be “static”, but,\nas Park points out, the static diagram represents the\nevolution in (proper) time of systems along their world lines. The\ndiagram, if Park is correct, need not itself be animated to represent\ndynamical phenomena. If Park is correct, then what Yourgrau called a\n“mistake” is in fact a virtue of Stein’s account, a\nfeature and not a bug. Stein makes no attempt to animate his geometric\npicture but leaves whatever transience there may be in that\nwhich it depicts.  \nLet us now turn to two variants of Stein’s approach—two\nclosely related ways to understand the present and temporal becoming\nin terms of structure intrinsic to Minkowski spacetime. One might see\nthese two views as attempts to capture Shimony’s transience\nwithout animating the Minkowski diagram. \nTwo sources of the view are Arthur (2006) and Dieks (2006). The latter\npaper begins by presenting a series of arguments that hyperplanes of\nsimultaneity or global nows are not the proper relativistic\nsuccessors to the common sense now. \nIn §1 Dieks presents the following argument: \nEven if it has no relevance to human experience, can we nevertheless\nchoose our hyperplane of simultaneity (the one orthogonal to\nour world line) as the hyperplane of simultaneity that marks\nthe passage of time? No, Dieks argues in §2 of his paper, for two\nreasons. \nFirst, there are too many. Were we inertial observers, then there\nwould be a hyperplane of simultaneity orthogonal to our world line\n(and uniquely definable from our world line using the Minkowski\nmetric). But every inertial world line defines such a hyperplane.\nChoosing a particular one, according to Dieks, “is tantamount to\naugmenting the structure of Minkowski spacetime” (Dieks, p.\n5). \nBut, second, there really aren’t any. We are not inertial\nobservers. We are (very nearly) rotating observers, and, as Dieks\npoints out, “local Einstein synchrony \\((\\varepsilon =1/2)\\) in a\nrotating system does not extend to a consistent global definition of\nsimultaneity” (Dieks, p. 6). \nPartisans of a global now in Minkowski spacetime face, according to\nDieks, a dilemma. “If we are not going to refer to the actual\nmaterial worldlines in the universe, but only to the spacetime\nstructure itself, we have insufficient resources to fix a unique set\nof global nows. If we do attempt to rely on the actual material\nworldlines, however, we will not succeed in defining global nows at\nall” (Dieks, p. 7). \nAlthough we are jumping ahead of our story, it is worth remarking here\nthat the situation does not improve in the general theory of\nrelativity, as Dieks notes in §3. It has been proposed that the\nmean motion of matter could be used to define a preferred frame that,\nin turn, could be foliated (or sliced) into spacelike hypersurfaces\nthat define a preferred global time. But this procedure would work\nonly at a large scale, wherein there would be an arbitrary element in\nboth determining the scale and the averaging procedure. Should one\nretreat to the use of actual world lines, the rotation problem\nreasserts itself. As Nelson Goodman remarked in another context, we\nhave either none or too many. \nTime, in the special theory of relativity, appears in two\nguises—coordinate time, which has held center stage thus far,\nand proper time. The histories of material objects, always moving with\nspeeds less than that of light, are represented in Minkowski spacetime\nby timelike world lines (curves in Minkowski spacetime such that the\ntangent vector at each point is timelike). Timelike world lines can be\nparameterized by a quantity, proper time, which is measured\nby ideal clocks following such world lines. \nHaving found it impossible to relate the passage of time to global\nhypersurfaces, which are defined in terms of coordinate time, Dieks\nsuggests (in §§4–5) that becoming in Minkowski\nspacetime is best thought of locally, as the advance of proper time\nalong a timelike world line, or, even more basically, as the\nsuccessive happening of events along such a world line. The passage of\ntime or temporal becoming (along a given timelike world line, of\ncourse) will be directly indicated by a clock. On this view the\npresent for a point particle on a timelike world line coincides\nprecisely with the particle, and a succession of presents is just the\nsuccessive occurence of events along that world line. \nA variant of this idea is to permit the present to be temporally\nextended, as it is in human consciousness, rather than point like. If\nwe then imagine a present (still along a given timelike world line) as\nbeginning at some event \\(e_0\\) and ending at a slightly later\nevent \\(e_1\\), then this variant view takes the present for the\ninterval from \\(e_0\\) to \\(e_1\\) (along the given timelike\nworld line) to be the events in the interior of the intersection of\nthe future light cone of \\(e_0\\) with the past light cone of\n \\(e_1\\).[14] \nIf the speed of light is set equal to 1, which is a common convention\nin discussions of relativity, then these sets are (in a \\(1+1\\)\ndimensional spacetime) diamond-shaped. If their temporal extent is\nscaled to the human psychological present, they will typically be very\nshort (say, one second) temporally, whereas their spatial extent will\nbe rather large by human standards. The succession of these\n“presents” along a timelike world line constitutes the\n(local) passage of time on this view. It is worth noting that on this\nview if two events are in a given present, it does not follow that\neither has become with respect to the other in the sense of Stein\ndiscussed above. \nThese two “variants” may vary, not by being distinct\nviews, but by being two different degrees of idealization of one core\nview, local succession. If one is thinking on the scale of cosmology,\nfor instance, with galaxies represented by points, then idealization\nof presents to points seems appropriate. Galaxy-wide causal diamonds\nwould represent unreasonably long presents. But at the everyday human\nscale, points are too small and too brief. Diamonds, appropriately\nscaled, may be just about right. ","contact.mail":"savitt@mail.ubc.ca","contact.domain":"mail.ubc.ca"}]
