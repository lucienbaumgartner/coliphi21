To say of an individual’s mental states that they\nhave intentionality is to say that they are mental representations or\nthat they have contents. Furthermore, to the extent that a speaker\nutters words from some natural language or draws pictures or symbols\nfrom a formal language for the purpose of conveying to others the\ncontents of her mental states, these artifacts used by a speaker too\nhave contents or intentionality. ‘Intentionality’ is a\nphilosopher’s word: ever since it was introduced into philosophy\nby Franz Brentano in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, it\nhas been used to refer to the puzzles of representation, all of which\nlie at the interface between the philosophy of mind and the philosophy\nof language. A picture of a dog, a proper name (e.g.,\n‘Fido’), the common noun ‘dog’ or the concept\nexpressed by the word can mean, represent, or stand for, one or\nseveral hairy barking creatures. A complete thought, a full sentence\nor a picture can stand for or describe a state of affairs. How could\nsome of the represented things (e.g., dinosaurs) be arbitrarily remote\nin space and time from the representation (e.g., a human thought or\nutterance about dinosaurs tokened in 2018), while others\n(e.g., numbers) may not even be in space and time at all? How could\nsome representations (e.g., direct quotations such as\n‘dinosaur’) even stand for themselves? How does a complex\nrepresentation (e.g., a complete thought or a full sentence) inherit\nits meaning or content from the meanings or contents of its\nconstituents? How should one construe the relationship between the\niconic content of pictorial representations and the conceptual content\nof proposition-like representations (thoughts and utterances)? How\nshould one understand the relation between the content of an\nindividual’s mental state and the meanings of external symbols\nused by the individual to express her internal mental states? Are\nrepresentations of the world part of the world they represent? Do all\nof an individual’s mental states have intentionality or only\nsome of them? The entry falls into ten sections:\n\n\n\n\n\n Contemporary discussions of the nature of intentionality are an\nintegral part of discussions of the nature of minds: what are minds\nand what is it to have a mind? They arise in the context of\nontological and metaphysical questions about the fundamental nature of\nmental states: states such as perceiving, remembering, believing,\ndesiring, hoping, knowing, intending, feeling, experiencing, and so\non. What is it to have such mental states? How does the mental relate\nto the physical, i.e., how are mental states related to an\nindividual’s body, to states of his or her brain, to his or her\nbehavior and to states of affairs in the world? \n\nWhy is intentionality so-called? For reasons soon to be explained, in\nits philosophical usage, the meaning of the word\n‘intentionality’ should not be confused with the ordinary\nmeaning of the word ‘intention.’ As indicated by the\nmeaning of the Latin word tendere, which is the etymology of\n‘intentionality,’ the relevant idea behind intentionality\nis that of mental directedness towards (or attending to) objects, as\nif the mind were construed as a mental bow whose arrows could be\nproperly aimed at different targets. In medieval logic and philosophy,\nthe Latin word intentio was used for what contemporary\nphilosophers and logicians nowadays call a ‘concept’ or an\n‘intension’: something that can be both true of non-mental\nthings and properties—things and properties lying outside the\nmind—and present to the mind. On the assumption that a concept\nis itself something mental, an intentio may also be true of\nmental things. For example, the concept of a dog, which is a\nfirst-level intentio, applies to individual dogs or to the\nproperty of being a dog. It also falls under various higher-level\nconcepts that apply to it, such as being a concept, being mental,\netc. If so, then while the first-level concept is true of non-mental\nthings, the higher-level concepts may be true of something\nmental. Notice that on this way of thinking, concepts that are true of\nmental things are presumably logically more complex than concepts that\nare true of non-mental things. \n\nAlthough the meaning of the word ‘intentionality’ in\ncontemporary philosophy is related to the meanings of such words as\n‘intension’ (or ‘intensionality’ with an\ns) and ‘intention,’ nonetheless it ought not to\nbe confused with either of them. On the one hand, in contemporary\nEnglish, ‘intensional’ and ‘intensionality’\nmean ‘non-extensional’ and\n‘non-extensionality,’ where both extensionality and\nintensionality are logical features of words and sentences. For\nexample, ‘creature with a heart’ and ‘creature with\na kidney’ have the same extension because they are true of the\nsame individuals: all the creatures with a kidney are creatures with a\nheart. But the two expressions have different intensions because the\nword ‘heart’ does not have the same extension, let alone\nthe same meaning, as the word ‘kidney.’ On the other hand,\nintention and intending are specific states of mind that, unlike\nbeliefs, judgments, hopes, desires or fears, play a distinctive role\nin the etiology of actions.  By contrast, intentionality is a\npervasive feature of many different mental states: beliefs, hopes,\njudgments, intentions, love and hatred all exhibit intentionality. In\nfact, Brentano held that intentionality is the hallmark of the mental:\nmuch of twentieth century philosophy of mind has been shaped by what,\nin this entry, will be referred to as “Brentano’s third\nthesis.”  \n\nFurthermore, it is worthwhile to distinguish between levels of\nintentionality. Many of an individual’s psychological states with\nintentionality (e.g., beliefs) are about (or represent) non-mental\nthings, properties and states of affairs. Many are also about\nanother’s psychological states (e.g., another’s beliefs). Beliefs about\nothers’ beliefs display what is known as ‘higher-order\nintentionality.’ Since the seminal (1978) paper by\nprimatologists David Premack and Guy Woodruff entitled “Does the\nchimpanzee have a theory of mind?”, under the heading\n‘theory of mind,’ much empirical research of the past\nthirty years has been devoted to the psychological questions whether\nnon-human primates can ascribe psychological states with\nintentionality to others and how human children develop their capacity\nto ascribe to others psychological states with intentionality (cf. the\ncomments by philosophers Jonathan Bennett, Daniel Dennett and Gilbert\nHarman to Premack and Woodruff’s paper and the SEP entry\n folk psychology: as a theory). \n\nThe concept of intentionality has played a central role both in the\ntradition of analytic philosophy and in the phenomenological\ntradition. As we shall see, some philosophers go so far as claiming\nthat intentionality is characteristic of all mental states.\nBrentano’s characterization of intentionality is quite complex. At the\nheart of it is Brentano’s notion of the ‘intentional inexistence\nof an object,’ which is analyzed in the next section. \n\nContemporary discussions of the nature of intentionality were\nlaunched and many of them were anticipated by Franz Brentano (1874,\n88–89) in his book, Psychology From an Empirical Standpoint,\nfrom which I quote two famous paragraphs: \n This intentional inexistence is characteristic exclusively of mental\nphenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it. We can,\ntherefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those\nphenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves. \n\n As one reads these lines, numerous questions arise: what does\nBrentano mean when he says that the object towards which the mind\ndirects itself ‘is not to be understood as meaning a\nthing’? What can it be for a phenomenon (mental or otherwise) to\nexhibit ‘the intentional inexistence of an object’? What\nis it for a phenomenon to ‘include something as object within\nitself’?  Do ‘reference to a content’ and\n‘direction toward an object’ express two distinct ideas?\nOr are they two distinct ways of expressing one and the same idea? If\nintentionality can relate a mind to something that either does not\nexist or exists wholly within the mind, what sort of relation can it\nbe? \n\n Replete as they are with complex, abstract and controversial ideas,\nthese two short paragraphs have set the agenda for all subsequent\nphilosophical discussions of intentionality in the late nineteenth and\nthe twentieth century. There has been some discussion over the meaning\nof Brentano’s expression ‘intentional inexistence.’ Did\nBrentano mean that the objects onto which the mind is directed are\ninternal to the mind itself (in-exist in the mind)?\nOr did he mean that the mind can be directed onto\nnon-existent objects? Or did he mean both? (See Crane, 1998\nfor further discussion.) \n\n Some of the leading ideas of the phenomenological tradition can be\ntraced back to this issue. Following the lead of Edmund Husserl (1900,\n1913), who was both the founder of phenomenology and a student of\nBrentano’s, the point of the phenomenological analysis has been to\nshow that the essential property of intentionality of being directed\nonto something is not contingent upon whether some real\nphysical target exists independently of the intentional act itself. To\nachieve this goal, two concepts have been central to Husserl’s\ninternalist interpretation of intentionality: the concept of a\nnoema (plural noemata) and the concept of\nepoche (i.e., bracketing) or phenomenological reduction. By\nthe word ‘noema,’ Husserl refers to the internal structure\nof mental acts. The phenomenological reduction is meant to help get at\nthe essence of mental acts by suspending all naive presuppositions\nabout the difference between real and fictitious entities (on these\ncomplex phenomenological concepts, see the papers by\nFøllesdal and others conveniently gathered in Dreyfus\n(1982). For further discussion, see Bell (1990) and Dummett (1993). \n\n In the two paragraphs quoted above, Brentano sketches an entire\nresearch programme based on three distinct theses. According to the\nfirst thesis, it is constitutive of the phenomenon of intentionality,\nas it is exhibited by mental states such as loving, hating, desiring,\nbelieving, judging, perceiving, hoping and many others, that these\nmental states are directed towards things different from themselves.\nAccording to the second thesis, it is characteristic of the objects\ntowards which the mind is directed by virtue of intentionality that\nthey have the property which Brentano calls intentional inexistence.\nAccording to the third thesis, intentionality is the mark of the\nmental: all and only mental states exhibit intentionality. \n\n Unlike Brentano’s third thesis, Brentano’s first two theses can\nhardly be divorced from each other. The first thesis can easily be\nrecast so as to be unacceptable unless the second thesis is accepted.\nSuppose that it is constitutive of the nature of intentionality that\none could not exemplify such mental states as loving, hating,\ndesiring, believing, judging, perceiving, hoping, and so on, unless\nthere was something to be loved, hated, desired, believed,\njudged, perceived, hoped, and so on. If so, then it follows from the\nvery nature of intentionality (as described by the first thesis) that\nnothing could exhibit intentionality unless there were\nobjects—intentional objects—that satisfied\nthe property Brentano called intentional inexistence. \n\n Now, the full acceptance of Brentano’s first two theses raises a\nfundamental ontological question in philosophical logic. The question\nis: are there such intentional objects? Does due recognition of\nintentionality force us to postulate the ontological category of\nintentional objects? This question has given rise to a major division\nwithin analytic philosophy. The prevailing (or orthodox) response has\nbeen a resounding ‘No.’ But an important minority of\nphilosophers, whom I shall call ‘the intentional-object’\ntheorists, have argued for a positive response to the question. Since\nintentional objects need not exist, according to intentional-object\ntheorists, there are things that do not exist. According to their\ncritics, there are no such things.  \nWe shall directly examine the intentional-object theorists approach in\nsection 7. Before doing so, in section 3, we shall examine the way\nsingular thoughts about concrete particulars in space and time can be\nand have been construed as paradigms of genuine intentional\nrelations. On this relational construal, an individual’s ordinary\nsingular thought about a concrete physical particular involves a\ngenuine relation between the individual’s mind and the concrete\nphysical particular. In sections 4–5, we shall examine two puzzles\nthat further arise on the orthodox paradigm. First, we shall deal with\nthe puzzle of how a rational person can believe of an object referred\nto by one singular term that it instantiates a property and\nsimultaneously disbelieve of the same object referred to by a distinct\nsingular term that it instantiates the same property. Section 4 is\ndevoted to Frege’s solution to this puzzle. In section 5, we shall\nscrutinize Russell’s solution to the puzzle of true negative\nexistential statements. In section 6, we shall see how the theory of\ndirect reference emerged within the orthodox paradigm out of a\ncritique of both Frege’s notion of sense and Russell’s assumption that\nmost proper names in natural languages are disguised definite\ndescriptions. \n\n Many non-intentional relations hold of concrete particulars in space\nand time. If and when they do, their relata cannot fail to exist. If\nCleopatra kisses Caesar, then both Cleopatra and Caesar must\nexist. Not so with intentional relations. If Cleopatra loves Caesar,\nthen presumably there is some concrete particular in space and time\nwhom Cleopatra loves. But one may also love Anna Karenina (not a\nconcrete particular in space and time, but a fictitious\ncharacter). Similarly, the relata of the admiration relation (another\nintentional relation) are not limited to concrete particulars in space\nand time. One may admire not only Albert Einstein but also Sherlock\nHolmes (a fictitious character). As the following passage from the\nAppendix to the 1911 edition of his 1874 book testifies, this\nasymmetry between non-intentional and intentional relations puzzled\nBrentano: \n\nWhile the orthodox paradigm is clearly consistent with the possibility\nthat general thoughts may involve abstract objects (e.g., numbers) and\nabstract properties and relations, none of which are in space and\ntime, special problems arise with respect to singular thoughts\nconstrued as intentional relations to non-existent or fictitious\nobjects. Two related assumptions lie at the core of the orthodox\nparadigm. One is the assumption that the mystery of the intentional\nrelation should be elucidated against the background of\nnon-intentional relations. The other is the assumption that\nintentional relations which seem to involve non-existent (e.g.,\nfictitious) entities should be clarified by reference to intentional\nrelations involving particulars existing in space and time. \n\nThe paradigm of the intentional relation that satisfies the orthodox\npicture is the intentionality of what can be called singular\nthoughts, namely those true thoughts that are directed towards\nconcrete individuals or particulars that exist in space and time. A\nsingular thought is such that it would not be available—it could\nnot be entertained—unless the concrete individual that is the\ntarget of the thought existed. Unlike the propositional contents of\ngeneral thoughts that involve only abstract universals such\nas properties and/or relations, the propositional content of a\nsingular thought may involve in addition a relation to a concrete\nindividual or particular. The contrast between ‘singular’\nand ‘general’ propositions has been much emphasized by\nKaplan (1978, 1989). In a slightly different perspective, Tyler Burge\n(1977) has characterized singular thoughts as incompletely\nconceptualized or de re thoughts whose relation to the\nobjects they are about is supplied by the context. On some views, the\nobject of the singular thought is even part of it.  On the\northodox view, part of the importance of true singular thoughts for a\nclarification of intentionality lies in the fact that some true\nsingular thoughts are about concrete perceptible objects. Singular\nthoughts about concrete perceptible objects may seem simpler and more\nprimitive than either general ones or thoughts about abstract\nentities. \n\nConsider, for example, what must be the case for belief-ascription\n(1) to be true: \n\n Intuitively, the belief ascribed to Ava by (1) has intentionality in\nthe sense that it is of or about Lionel Jospin and\nthe property of being a Socialist. Besides being a belief (i.e., a\nspecial attitude different from a wish, a desire, a fear or\nan intention), the identity of Ava’s belief depends on its\npropositional content. What Ava believes is identified by the embedded\n‘that’-clause that can stand all by itself as in (2): \n\n On the face of it, an utterance of (2) is true if and only if a given\nconcrete individual does exemplify the property of being a\nSocialist. Arguably, it is essential to the proposition that Ava\nbelieves—the proposition expressed by an utterance of\n(2)—that it is about Jospin and the property of being a\nSocialist. Just by virtue of having such a true belief, Ava must\ntherefore stand in relation—the belief relation—to Jospin\nand the property of being a Socialist.  Notice that Ava can have a\nbelief about Jospin and the property of being a Socialist even though\nshe has never seen Jospin in person. \n\n From within the orthodox paradigm, one central piece of the mystery\nof intentionality can be brought out by reflection on the conditions\nin which simple singular thoughts about concrete individuals are true.\nThis is the problem of the relational nature of the contents\nof true singular beliefs. In order to generate this problem, it is not\nnecessary to ascend to false or abstract beliefs about fictional\nentities. It is enough to consider how a true thought about a concrete\nindividual that exists in space and time can arise. On the one hand,\nAva’s belief seems to be a singular belief about a concrete\nindividual.  It seems essential to Ava’s belief that it has the\npropositional content that it has. And it seems essential to the\npropositional content of Ava’s belief that Ava must stand in relation\nto somebody else who can be very remote from her in either space or\ntime. On the other hand, Ava’s belief is a state internal to Ava. As\nJohn Perry (1994, 187) puts it, beliefs and other so-called\n‘propositional attitudes’ seem to be “local mental\nphenomena.” How can it be essential to an internal state of\nAva’s that Ava stands in relation to someone else? How can one\nreconcile the local and the relational characters of propositional\nattitudes? \n\n The problem of the relational nature of the contents of true singular\nthoughts can be made more acute by the following puzzle that exercised\nGottlob Frege (1892): how can one rationally hold two\ndistinct singular beliefs that are both about one and the same object?\nAs we shall see momentarily, this puzzle is related to a second\npuzzle: the puzzle of how a statement expressing a belief about\nidentity can both be true and informative. If the belief relation is a\ngenuine relation, then it would seem that it is like kicking:\nif Jacques Chirac kicked Lionel Jospin and if Lionel Jospin was the\nFrench Prime minister in 2001, then Jacques Chirac kicked the French\nPrime minister in 2001. Not so with belief, as we shall see\nmomentarily. Notice that in ordinary contexts, the word\n‘belief’ can be used to denote either a person’s state or\nthe content of that state. \n\n Ever since Frege, it has been standard practice in analytic\nphilosophy to investigate the intentional structure of much human\nthought by inquiring into the logical structure of the language used\nby speakers to express it or to ascribe it to others. (See, e.g.,\nDummett (1973) for a forceful justification.) Suppose that Ava\ncorrectly believes that Hesperus is shining as a result of seeing that\nHesperus shines. Suppose also that she fails to believe that\nPhosphorus is shining because, although she correctly believes that\nHesperus is called ‘Hesperus,’ she incorrectly believes\nthat ‘Phosphorus’ is the name of a different planet (that\nshe is not currently seeing) and she fails to know that\n‘Phosphorus’ is in fact another name for Hesperus. So\nwhereas the first belief report is true, the second belief report is\nfalse: \n\n Given that ‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’ are\njust names of the same object, how can Ava believe one thing and\ndisbelieve the other? Given that ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Phosphorus’ apply to the same object, it would seem that\n‘Hesperus is shining’ is true if and only if\n‘Phosphorus is shining’ is true and that these two\nsentences express one and the same proposition. If what is essential\nto the proposition that Ava believes is that it is about Hesperus and\nthe property of shining, how can she believe one thing and fail to\nbelieve the other since both are about Hesperus? \n\n Another related puzzle is the puzzle of how identity statements can\nboth be true and informative. It seems clear that Ava could not doubt\nthat ‘Hesperus is Hesperus’ expresses a truth. But it\nseems clear that she can—in fact she does—doubt that\n‘Hesperus is Phosphorus’ expresses a truth. In fact, when\nshe learns that ‘Hesperus is Phosphorus’ does express a\ntruth, she is surprised.  How can it be? (See Richard 1990 and Salmon\n1986.)  \n\n Frege (1892) offered a very influential solution to both puzzles.\nThis common solution is based on his famous distinction between the\nreference (or Bedeutung) and the sense (or\nSinn) of an English proper name. The sense, which is the mode\nof presentation of the reference, is presumably something abstract\nthat can both be instantiated by a concrete individual and present to,\nor grasped by, a mind. This distinction is in some ways reminiscent of\nthe distinction between extension and intension and is inconsistent\nwith John Stuart Mill’s (1884) view that proper names have a\ndenotation and no connotation. \n\n The reason (3) and (4) can, on Frege’s view, have different\ntruth-values is that the embedded sentences or\n‘that’-clauses in (3) and (4)—namely (5) and\n(6)—do not express one and the same proposition. They\nexpress different propositions (or thoughts). Frege uses the German\nGedanke for ‘thought.’ \n\n How can (5) and (6) express different propositions? Unlike\nnon-ordinary contexts such as (3) and (4), in which they are part of\nan embedded ‘that’-clause, in ordinary contexts such as\n(5) and (6), ‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’ have\nthe same Bedeutung (or reference). But they have different\nsenses (Sinn) or different modes of presentation of their\ncommon reference. On the Fregean view, what is essential to the\nthought or proposition expressed by an utterance of a sentence\ncontaining a singular term is its sense, not its\nreference. Propositions have senses, not individuals, as\nconstituents. Ava lacks a piece of knowledge. But given that ignorance\nis not irrationality, Ava can rationally believe that Hesperus is\nshining and fail to believe that Phosphorus is shining. Similarly, a\nstatement expressing a belief about identity can both be true and\ninformative because the two singular terms that flank the identity\nsign in an identity statement have both a sense and a reference. The\nidentity statement is true because they have the same reference. It is\ninformative because they have different senses or they present their\ncommon reference via different modes of presentation. \n\n On the Fregean view, in (3) and (4), ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Phosphorus’ do not have their ordinary reference (or\nBedeutung), namely the planet to which they both apply: they\nhave an ‘oblique’ reference. In (3), the oblique reference\nof ‘Hesperus’ is its ordinary sense. In (4), the oblique\nreference of ‘Phosphorus’ is its ordinary sense. And we\nalready agreed that ‘Hesperus’ and\n‘Phosphorus’ in (5) and (6) have different ordinary\nsenses. So in (3), ‘Hesperus’ has an ‘oblique’\nor ‘indirect’ sense, which is the mode of presentation of\nthe ordinary sense ‘Hesperus’ has in (5).  Similarly, in\n(4) ‘Phosphorus’ has an ‘oblique’ sense, which\nis the mode of presentation of the ordinary sense\n‘Phosphorus’ has in (5). On the Fregean view, a thought or\nbelief can be about a concrete individual (its reference),\nbut what matters to the individuation (or the identity) of the\nthought’s content is not the reference of the singular term, but the\nsense or mode of presentation of the reference, i.e., something\nabstract. For further discussion, see the entry on\n Gottlob Frege. \n\n When Brentano reflected on the “quasi-relational” nature\nof the intentionality of thoughts about things that need not\nexist, he wrote that if one “is denying something, the existence\nof the object is precisely what is excluded whenever [one’s] denial is\ncorrect”. He thus assumed that one can correctly and coherently\ndeny the existence of things that do not exist. To show that one can\ndo so, however, is no easy task. The version of the puzzle that \nexercised both Alexius Meinong (a disciple of Brentano’s) and Bertrand\nRussell at the turn of the twentieth century is the puzzle of true\nnegative existential beliefs.  How can a person correctly believe that\nPegasus does not exist? For a person to correctly believe that Pegasus\ndoes not exist, she must have a belief whose content is the same as\nthe content expressed by a true utterance of sentence (7). \n\n How can the proposition expressed by an utterance of (7) be both true\nand about Pegasus? The puzzle arises from the observation that if the\nproposition is true, then presumably it is not about Pegasus since it\nsays that Pegasus does not exist. Conversely, if it is about Pegasus,\nthen Pegasus must exist. But if so, then it cannot be true since it\ndenies the existence of Pegasus. Thus, the puzzle has the form of a\ndilemma: either the proposition expressed by (7) is false or it is not\nabout Pegasus. At least, the puzzle is generated by the pair of\nassumptions that ‘Pegasus’ is a proper name and that\nproper names must have a reference. Is the first assumption\nright? \n\n In his 1905 paper, “On denoting,” Russell embraced the\nview that neither ‘Pegasus’ nor in fact most proper names\nof natural languages are genuine ‘logical’ proper\nnames. He held the epistemological view that unless one is directly\nacquainted with something, one cannot use in thought or\nlanguage a genuine ‘logical’ proper name referring to\nit. Nor can one entertain a genuine singular thought about it. If one\nis not directly acquainted with an object, then one must instead form\na general thought that is not about any particular individual. In\nfact, Russell’s (1911, 1919) held a dual view of acquaintance: on the\none hand, he thought that acquaintance is a relation that can only\nhold between someone’s mind and his or her own sense data. On the\nother hand, he held the view that one can be acquainted with\nuniversals (such as e.g., colors). If most—if not\nall—names of natural languages are not genuine\n‘logical’ names, then what are they and what is their\nfunction in human thought and communication? On Russell’s view, they\nare “disguised” or abbreviated definite descriptions,\ni.e., they are short for some definite description. Their logical\nfunction is that of a definite description. \n\n On the face of it, the grammatical form of the quasi-English sentence\n‘the F is G’ indicates that it serves to express a\nsubject-predicate (or singular) proposition true if and only if the\nobject that exemplifies the property expressed by predicate\n‘F’ also exemplifies the property expressed by predicate\n‘G’. But Russell (1905) designed a method—his\nfamous theory of definite descriptions—for eliminating the\nEnglish definite article ‘the’ (as in ‘the F’)\nby means of a logical formula of first-order logic involving only\nquantifiers and variables.  On his analysis, ‘the F is G’\ncan be paraphrased into the general existentially quantified\nproposition (8): \n\n(8) is true if and only if there is one and only one individual that\nis F and G. This proposition will be false just in\ncase nothing or more than one thing is both F and\nG. \n\n Combined with the assumption that ‘Pegasus’ is not a name\nbut a disguised definite description—that it is short for\ne.g., ‘the winged horse’—Russell’s theory of\ndefinite descriptions thus leads to a solution to the puzzle of true\nnegative existential beliefs. The solution is to accept the second\nhorn of the dilemma: the proposition is not about Pegasus. On this\naccount, one can correctly believe that Pegasus does not exist, since\nwhat one believes is what is expressed by an utterance of (7), namely\nthe true proposition that there does not exist a unique individual\nthat is a winged horse. Clearly, Russell’s solution to the puzzle of\ntrue negative existential beliefs shows how, in Brentano’s own terms,\n“if someone thinks of something, the one who is thinking must\ncertainly exist, but the object of his thinking need not exist at\nall” and furthermore the thought may be true. For further\ndiscussion, see the entry on\n Bertrand Russell. \n\n Within the orthodox paradigm in the philosophy of mind and language\nof the 1960’s and 1970’s, there was an important swing of the pendulum\naway from the implications of Frege’s and especially Russell’s\ndoctrines for intentionality. The so-called “theory of direct\nreference” has contributed to rehabilitate the view that\nconcrete individuals matter more to the identity of the singular\nthoughts that humans entertain than the Frege/Russell doctrines\nallow. According to Frege’s distinction between sense and reference,\nwhat matters to the identity of a thought about a concrete individual\nis not the individual thought about but the abstract sense by means of\nwhich he is thought about. According to Russell, most thoughts that\nseem prima facie to be about concrete individuals are in fact not\nsingular thoughts but generally quantified propositions. Much of the\nimpetus for the theory of direct reference came from the implications\nof the semantics of modal logic for the intentionality of singular\nthoughts and beliefs. \n\n Saul Kripke (1972) noticed an important difference between the\nbehavior of a proper name and the behavior of a coreferential definite\ndescription expressing a contingent or non-essential property of its\nreferent, in modal contexts. Consider two sentences (9) and (10), each\ncontaining some modal operator like ‘might’ (that\nexpresses a possibility) and such that the former contains a proper\nname while the latter contains a coreferential definite\ndescription: \n\n The definite description ‘the president of France elected in\n2002’ happens to be true of Jacques Chirac of whom it expresses\na contingent property. There certainly exists a metaphysically\npossible world in which either Chirac was not a candidate in the 2002\nFrench presidential elections or he was a candidate but he lost the\nelection.  \n\n An utterance of (9) asserts that there exists a possible world in\nwhich Jacques Chirac is a member of the Socialist party, which he in\nfact is not. Given the deep connection between the speech act of\nassertion and speaker’s belief, an utterance of (9) expresses the\ncounterfactual belief about Chirac that he could have been a\nSocialist.  Unlike an utterance of (9), an utterance of (10) is\nambiguous. On one reading, it has the same truth-conditions as does an\nutterance of (9) and it serves to express the same\nbelief. Alternatively, an utterance of (10) says of someone who is in\nfact a Socialist, and who therefore is not Chirac, that he could have\nbeen elected president in 2002. \n\n Thus, the following contrast emerges. An utterance of (9) can only\nserve to express a counterfactual belief or thought about Chirac,\ni.e., the belief ascribing to Chirac the counterfactual property of\nbeing a Socialist. An utterance of (10) can serve to express the same\nbelief about Chirac. But it can also serve to express an entirely\ndifferent counterfactual belief about a different individual, who as a\nmatter of fact happens to be a Socialist. This different\ncounterfactual belief would be true e.g., in a possible world in which\nJospin (who is a Socialist) won the 2002 presidential\nelections.  \n\n On the basis of the fact that, unlike (9), (10) can serve to express\ntwo distinct counterfactual beliefs, Kripke (1972) hypothesizes that a\nproper name is what he calls a rigid designator.\n‘Jacques Chirac’ in (9) is rigid for in all possible\nworlds it refers to one and the same concrete individual, i.e., the\nindividual to whom it in fact refers in the actual world. By contrast,\nthe definite description ‘the president of France elected in\n2002’, which happens to express a contingent property of Chirac,\nis not a rigid designator because it does not pick one and the same\nindividual in all possible worlds. When evaluated with respect to\ndifferent worlds, it is true of different individuals. Of course, some\ndefinite descriptions (e.g., ‘the square root of 21’) do\nexpress essential properties of what they are true of (in this case, a\nnumber). According to Kripke (1980), unlike proper names, whose\nrigidity is de jure, definite descriptions expressing\nessential properties of an object are rigid de facto. For\nfurther discussion, see the entry on\n reference. \n\n Arguably, the goal of the theory of direct reference is to emphasize\nthe depth of the gap between the intentionality of singular thoughts\nand the intentionality of general thoughts. Concrete individuals are\nnot constituents of the contents of the latter. But they are\nconstituents of the contents of the former. Three arguments have been\nbuttressed to dismantle the Russellian disdain for the peculiar\nintentionality of singular thoughts expressible by proper names: a\nmodal argument, an epistemological argument and what can be called a\n“transcendental” argument. \n\n According to the modal argument, if the proper name\n‘Cicero’ were just short for some definite description,\ne.g., ‘the Roman orator who denounced Catiline,’ then it\nwould follow that the sentence ‘Cicero is the Roman orator who\ndenounced Catiline’ would express a necessary truth,\ni.e., a proposition true in all possible worlds. But this seems\nabsurd: there certainly is a possible world in which Cicero did not\ndenounce Catiline. \n\n According to the epistemological argument, from the same assumption,\nit follows that the sentence ‘Cicero is the Roman orator who\ndenounced Catiline’ expresses a proposition knowable a\npriori, so that it makes no sense to imagine that historians may\ndiscover by empirical research that in fact somebody else denounced\nCatiline or that nobody did. But this too seems absurd. \n\n Finally, according to the transcendental argument, people use proper\nnames in thought and in verbal communication to track, pick out and\nexchange valuable information about concrete particulars. Although\nthey may lack information expressible by some definite\ndescription—let alone by a single definite description—for\nuniquely identifying many concrete particulars, still people manage to\nsecure reference to them.  Furthermore, as a person comes to learn\nmore and more information about an object or a person, she comes to\nassociate different definite descriptions to the referent of a proper\nname. If follows that no one definite description seems suitable to\ncapture the content of a proper name. \n\n According to the theory of direct reference, the function of such\nlinguistic devices as proper names, indexicals and demonstratives is\nto introduce a concrete individual or particular into the proposition\nand/or belief expressed. To use David Kaplan’s (1979, 387) revealing\nword, a concrete individual is “trapped” within a singular\nproposition. The theory of direct reference seems like a useful\nantidote against the Frege/Russell tendency to minimize the\ncontribution of concrete particulars to the individuation of human\nsingular thoughts. Three trends of thoughts in recent philosophy of \nmind and language have built on the theory of direct reference. First, \nmany of the insights of the theory\nof direct reference have been extended from thoughts about concrete\nindividuals to thoughts about natural kinds by Kripke (1972) and\nPutnam (1974). This extension plays a crucial role in the externalist\nview of intentional mental states (about which see\n section 10). Secondly, neo-Fregeans have responded \nto the challenge of the theory of direct reference by providing a \nsuitable notion of “object-dependent” or “de \nre” sense (see Evans, 1982 and McDowell, 1984). (For a \nresponse to Frege’s puzzle about how two distinct beliefs can be about\nthe same object on behalf of the theory of direct reference, see\nSalmon, 1986). Thirdly, the metaphysical and epistemological\nunderpinnings of singular thoughts (and singular propositions) have\ngiven rise to a rich discussion of the contrast between two broad\nperspectives: descriptivism and singularism. According to\ndescriptivism, we can only think about objects by thinking about the\nproperties which they instantiate. But according to singularism, not\nall thoughts about objects are mediated by thoughts about their\nproperties. For further discussion, see the papers collected in\nJeshion (ed.) (2010), in particular Recanati (2010).  \n\nSections 4, 5 and 6 described three moves made within the orthodox\nparadigm in analytic philosophy in response to puzzles raised by the\nintentionality of singular thoughts about concrete particulars. In\nparticular, the dispute between the theory of direct reference and either\nthe Fregean distinction between sense and reference or the Russellian\nassumption that ordinary proper names are disguised definite descriptions\ncan be seen as internal to the orthodox paradigm according to which there\nare only existing objects, i.e., concrete particulars in space and time.\nBrentano, however, sketched the possibility of an alternative paradigm\nbased on the acceptance of the view that intentional objects may be\nnon-existent objects or abstract objects. (For a general survey of the\nrole of Brentano in the emergence of the non-orthodox theory of\nintentional objects in Austrian philosophy, see Smith, 1994.) \n\nTo see how the theory of intentional objects flows from Brentano’s\ncharacterization of intentionality, recall (from section 2) that it\nfollows from the nature of intentionality (as described by Brentano’s\nfirst thesis) that nothing could exhibit intentionality unless there\nwere objects – intentional objects – that satisfied the property\nBrentano called “intentional inexistence.” Consider the following\ninference schema licensed by the rule of existential generalization and\ninstantiated by the non-intentional relation expressed by the English\nverb “kiss” in (11): \n\nIf (11a) is true, so is (11b). The question is: is this valid inference\nschema also instantiated by the following pairs (12)-(15) involving\nintentional relations? \n\n 13a. The Ancient Greeks worshiped Zeus. \n 13b. The Ancient Greeks worshiped something. \n 14a. Ponce de Leon searched for the fountain of youth.\n 14b. Ponce de Leon searched for something. \n 15a. Modern criminologists admire Sherlock Holmes.\n 15b. Modern criminologists admire something. \n\nOn the one hand, unlike (11), (12)-(15) involve intentional relations. On\nthe other hand, unlike the intentional relation in (12), the intentional\nrelations in (13)-(15) seem to involve particulars which don’t exist (or\nhaven’t existed) in space and time. Intentional-object theorists hold\nthat the above inferences involving both non-intentional and intentional\nrelations constitute data that call for a consistent explanation. In\nother words, the intentional-object theorist accepts, whereas his critic\nrejects, the validity of the rule of existential\ngeneralization for both intentional and non-intentional relations,\nwhether the relata of the intentional relations are concrete particulars\nin space and time or not. On the non-orthodox assumption that the\ninference schema instantiated by (11) can be instantiated by (12)-(15) as\nwell, then in logical notation, the second coordinate of every pair\n(11)-(15) should be symbolized thus: \nThus, the issue between the intentional-object theorist and his critic is\nwhether the variable bound by the standard existential quantifier of\nfirst-order logic should range not merely over concrete particulars\nexisting in space and time but also over all sorts of other entities as\nwell. Note that the issue is orthogonal to the contrast between the\nobjectual and the substitutional interpretation of the existential\nquantifier since the dispute over the admission of intentional objects is\nwholly internal to the objectual interpretation of the quantifier. The\nquestion that arises for the intentional-object theorist is: what is the\nbest theory of the objects over which (13c)-(15c) seem to quantify? \n\nMeinong (1904) supposed that objects like Zeus, the fountain of youth,\nSherlock Holmes, etc., are non-existent objects which exemplify the\nproperties attributed to them. On his view, the fountain of youth is\nan object that instantiates both the property of being a fountain and\nthat of having waters which confer everlasting life. But it fails to\ninstantiate the property of existence. Meinong seemed to suppose that\nfor any group of properties, there is an object which instantiates\nthose properties. Some of the resulting objects exist and others do\nnot.  Russell (1905) found this view of intentional objects\nontologically unacceptable since it involves the acceptance of\nentities such as golden mountains (which are inconsistent with\nphysical and chemical laws) and round squares (which are inconsistent\nwith the laws of geometry). His theory of definite descriptions was\nprecisely designed to avoid these ontological consequences (see\nsection 5). However, by clarifying distinctions proposed by both\nMeinong and his student Ernst Mally, Parsons (1980) has recently\noffered a theory of non-existent objects, which is based on the\nassumption that existence is a special kind of property. This theory\nuses a quantifier “∃”, which does not imply\nexistence. To assert existence, he uses the predicate\n“E!”. Thus, the assertion that there are\nnon-existent objects can be represented in Parsons’ theory without\ncontradiction by the logical formula\n“∃x(~E!x).” Furthermore, Parsons\ndistinguishes between “nuclear” and\n“extranuclear” properties. Only the former, which are\nordinary, non-intentional kinds of properties, contribute to\nindividuating objects. The set of extranuclear properties involve\nintentional properties, modal properties and existence. Armed with\nthis distinction among properties, Parsons (1980) has been able to\navoid Russell’s objections to Meinong’s naive theory of intentional\nobjects. (For further details, see Parsons, 1980.) An original account\nof the possibility of entertaining true thoughts about non-existent\nobjects, based on the contrast between pleonastic (or\nrepresentation-dependent) and non-pleonastic (natural or substantial)\nproperties, has been developed by Crane (2013).   The theory of intentional objects has also been developed in a\nslightly different way. Meinong’s student Ernst Mally (1912) proposed\nthat fictional and mythical objects, as well as objects like round\nsquares, do not instantiate the properties attributed to them but\n“have” those properties in a different way. For Mally, the\nfountain of youth is “determined” by the properties of\nbeing a fountain and having waters which confer everlasting life, but\nthis object doesn’t instantiate those properties in the traditional\nsense. Given Mally’s distinction, the fact that there is an object\nwhich is determined by the properties of being golden and of being a\nmountain does not contradict the contingent fact that nothing\ninstantiates these two properties, nor does Mally have to think of\nintentional objects as non-existent. Rather, he treats them as\nexisting abstract objects. Thus, whereas Parsons uses two kinds of\nproperties to develop a theory of non-existent objects, a neo-Mallyan\nsuch as Zalta (1988) uses two kinds of predication – exemplification\n(which corresponds to instantiation) and encoding (which corresponds\nto Mally’s notion of determination) – to develop a theory of abstract\nobjects.  These abstract objects are part of the explanations of both\nthe truths expressed by (13a)-(15a) and the validity of the inferences\nin (13a,b)-(15a,b). As such, abstract objects may well\nexist. Nonetheless, some abstract objects (e.g., Sherlock Holmes and\nZeus) may be said “not to exist” in the sense that nothing\nexemplifies the properties which they encode.  \nThough Quine’s (1948) well-known paper “On what there\nis,” raises serious ontological questions for intentional-object\ntheories, both Parsons and Zalta have provided answers to Quine’s\nqueries, in their respective work.  Nonetheless, to this day, many\ncontemporary philosophers have been reluctant to embrace\nintentional-object theories for two related reasons.  First of all,\nthey have been eager to avoid what they see as the heavy ontological\ncommitments incurred by intentional-object theories.  Secondly, the\nontology of non-existent and abstract objects has seemed difficult to\nsquare with the ontology of the contemporary natural sciences\naccording to which the world contains only concrete objects that exist\nin space and time. (See Section 9 for further discussion.) \n\nThe theory of intentional objects, however, may derive support from\nthe following, arguably counterintuitive, consequences of Frege’s and\nRussell’s views, respectively. Frege’s theory faces two\nproblems. First (13a)-(15a) would appear to express truths. But on\nFrege’s view, they lack a truth-value, since they involve singular\nterms devoid of reference and, according to Frege, if part of a\nsentence lacks a reference, then the sentence itself fails to have a\ntruth-value (see section 4).  Secondly, the inferences in (13)-(15)\nappear to be valid. But on Frege’s view, one cannot validly infer\n(13b) from (13a) if (13a) has no truth-value. Similarly for the other\npair of sentences (14) and (15).  Russell’s view faces two analogous\nproblems. First, as noted above, (13a)-(15a) appear to be true. But on\nRussell’s analysis, proper names such as “Zeus” in (13a)\nand “Sherlock Holmes” in (15a) are abbreviated definite\ndescriptions and, given his analysis of definite descriptions, both\n(13a) and (15a) turn out to express false existentially quantified\npropositions (see section 5). Secondly, if (13a)-(15a) are indeed\nfalse, as Russell’s view would have it, then one cannot validly infer\n(13b)-(15b), respectively, from their corresponding premisses. For a\nrecent novel account of the distinction between true and false\nthoughts about non-existent objects, cf. Crane (2013) and for further\ndiscussion of the general topic of existence, see the SEP entry on\nexistence. \n\n Within the orthodox paradigm, an entirely different reaction to the\npuzzles of intentional inexistence has been to try to clarify the\nontological difficulties by ascending to a higher semantic level that\ncan, as Willard Van Orman Quine (1960, 272) says, “carry the\ndiscussion into a domain where both parties are better agreed on the\nobjects (viz., words).” Semantic ascent allows one to rise from\ntalk about things to talk about talk about things, i.e., words. In\ncontemporary analytic philosophy, Roderick Chisholm (1957, 298) was\nthe first to contemplate the formulation of “a working criterion\nby means of which we can distinguish sentences that are intentional,\nor are used intentionally, in a certain language from sentences that\nare not.” The idea is to examine sentences that report\nintentionality rather than intentionality itself. \n\n Intensionality (with an s) is non-extensionality. Two\nfeatures are characteristic of extensionality. First, if a linguistic\ncontext is extensional, two coreferential terms can be substituted one\nfor the other salva veritate as illustrated by (16) and\n(17): \n\n If (16) is true, so is (17). Secondly, the law of existential\ngeneralization applies to either (16) or (17) to yield\n‘∃x(x shines).’ Not so with\nintensionality. As illustrated by examples (3) and (4) repeated here,\nthe truth of (3) does not always entail the truth of (4): \n\n Nor can existential generalization always be validly applied to\nsentences reporting beliefs, since from the fact that John believes\nthat angels have wings, it does not follow that there are things such\nthat John believes of them that they have wings. \n\n Chisholm’s criterion of intensionality is threefold. First, a\nsentence reports an intentional phenomenon if it contains a singular\nterm that purports to refer to some object and it is such that neither\nit nor its negation implies that the purported reference of the\nsingular term does or does not exist. The first criterion amounts to\nthe recognition that if a sentence containing a singular term reports\nan intentional phenomenon, then it fails to satisfy the law of\nexistential generalization (from ‘Fa’ infer\n‘∃xFx’). Secondly, a true sentence reports\nan intentional phenomenon if it contains a singular term\n‘a’ and if replacement of\n‘a’ by coreferential term\n‘b’ results in transforming the true sentence\ninto a false sentence that differs only from the former in that\n‘b’ replaces ‘a’. The second\ncriterion amounts to recognition that if a sentence containing a\nsingular term reports an intentional phenomenon, then it fails the\ntest of the substitutivity of coreferential terms salva\nveritate. Finally, if a complex sentence containing an embedded\n‘that’-clause reports an intentional phenomenon, then\nneither it nor its negation entail the truth of the proposition\nexpressed by the embedded ‘that’-clause. \n\n Chisholm (1957) argued that reports or descriptions of intentional or\npsychological phenomena cannot be reduced to (or eliminated in favor\nof) descriptions of behavior. The intensionality or non-extensionality\nof reports of intentionality was taken to show that descriptions and\nexplanations of psychological phenomena cannot be described nor\nexplained in terms of a vocabulary describing non-intentional\nphenomena. As Quine (1960, 220) put it, “there is no breaking\nout of the intentional vocabulary by explaining its members in other\nterms”. Chisholm (1957) took this conclusion to show the\ncorrectness of Brentano’s third thesis that intentionality\nis the mark of the mental. \n\nThe question can be decomposed into two questions. On the one hand,\nacceptance of intensionality as the criterion of intentionality seems\nto reflect the endorsement of a general linguistic view of\nintentionality in the following sense: what matters to the mental\n(i.e. non-linguistic) state reported are the properties of the\nlinguistic report. There are at least two reasons for scepticism about\nthe linguistic view of intentionality. On the other hand, there are\nsome specific reasons for questioning two of Chisholm’s criteria. I\nstart with the latter. It seems hard to deny that states of\nknowledge are states with intentionality. At least, reports\nof knowledge states satisfy Chisholm’s second non-substitutivity\ncriterion. From the fact that knowledge ascription (18) is true, it\ndoes not follow that (19) is, even though ‘Cicero’ and\n‘Tully’ are coreferential: \n\n However, unlike belief reports, reports of knowledge are\nfactive: (18) could not be true unless (20) was true and\nCicero did in fact denounce Catiline. Thus, unlike belief reports,\nreports of knowledge fail Chisholm’s third criterion. Given that (20)\nis extensional, it obeys the law of existential generalization. If the\ntruth of (20) follows from the truth of (18) and if (20) satisfies the\nlaw of existential generalization, then so does (18). If so, then\nknowledge reports also fail to satisfy Chisholm’s first criterion. \n\n One way to deal with this objection might be to argue that knowledge\nreports fail the test of existential generalization precisely because,\nunlike belief states, states of knowledge fail to exhibit Brentano’s\nintentional inexistence: only beliefs, not states of knowledge, can be\ndirected towards states of affairs that fail to obtain and towards\nnon-existent entities. Alternatively, one might make a distinction\nbetween states with a stronger and states with a weaker\nintentionality.  Reports of the former (like beliefs) satisfy\nChisholm’s three criteria.  Reports of the latter (like states of\nknowledge) only fail the substitutivity test. \n\n The problem with this strategy is that there are sentences that seem\nto describe intentional relations and that, unlike knowledge reports,\nare not intensional at all, for they pass the substitutivity\ntest. This is the case of sentences about what Fred Dretske (1969)\ncalls nonepistemic perception. If, when he was alive, someone\nsaw the French writer Romain Gary, then she ipso facto saw\nAjar, for Ajar was no other than Romain Gary. However, if she failed\nto know that ‘Ajar’ was another name for Romain Gary,\nwhile seeing Romain Gary, she may have failed to see that the\nman in front of her was Ajar. A fortiori, in this nonepistemic sense,\none cannot see an individual unless there is an individual to be\nseen. One possible response might be to bite the bullet and deny that\nnonepistemic perception is an intentional state at all. If so, then,\nas Zalta (1988, 13) notes, linguistic reports of intentional phenomena\ndo satisfy at least one of Chisholm’s criteria of intensionality. \n\n If seeing is intentional, then not all reports of intentionality are\nintensional. That not all reports of intentionality are intensional is\na problem for the linguistic view according to which intensionality is\nthe criterion of intentionality. A second problem is that\nintensionality is also a feature of sentences that are about phenomena\nother than intentionality. Sentences that involve or are about\nmodalities such as necessity, about natural laws, about causation all\nexhibit intensionality. So, for example, the truth of (21) does not\nentail the truth of (22) even though everything that happens to\nexemplify property Q happens to exemplify property\nR: \n\n But necessity, natural laws or causation do not, on the face of it,\nexhibit what Brentano took to be defining characteristics of\nintentionality. So it seems as if the intensionality of the report of\na phenomenon is neither necessary nor sufficient for the\nintentionality of the reported phenomenon. Arguably, ‘P’,\n‘Q’ and ‘R’ in (21)-(22) are not singular\nterms at all. If they are treated as such, then, even though they may\nbe true of the same set of individuals, they do not refer or express\none and the same property. Still, the point illustrated by nomicity is\nthat the intensionality of a linguistic report is not sufficient for\nthe intentionality of the reported phenomenon. \n\n As we saw in section 8, Quine (1960, 220), a leading critic of\nintentional objects (in the sense of section 7), agrees with Chisholm\n(1957) that the intentional vocabulary cannot be reduced to some\nnon-intentional vocabulary. Chisholm (1957) took this conclusion to\nshow the correctness of Brentano’s third thesis that intentionality\nis the mark of the mental. From the same conclusion, Quine\n(1960, 221) presented an influential dilemma with both epistemological\nand ontological implications. The first horn of the dilemma is to\naccept the “indispensability of intentional idioms and the\nimportance of an autonomous science of intention” and to reject\na physicalist ontology.  The second horn of the same dilemma is to\naccept physicalism and renounce the “baselessness” of the\nintentional idioms and the “emptiness” of a science of\nintention. This dilemma has been influential in contemporary\nphilosophy of mind. \n\n The common legacy of Chisholm (1957) and Quine (1960) is the\nlinguistic view of intentionality (accepted by e.g., Dennett 1969).\nWhether intensionality is indeed the defining criterion of\nintentionality, one can certainly question Brentano’s thesis that\nonly mental phenomena exhibit intentionality by noticing that\nsome non-mental things exhibit something very much like Brentano’s\nintentional inexistence, namely sentences of natural languages.\nSentences of natural languages have meaning and by virtue of having\nmeaning, they can be, just like states of mind, directed towards\nthings other than themselves, some of which need not exist in space\nand time.  Sentences of natural languages, however, are non-mental\nthings. \n\n One influential response to this objection to this part of Brentano’s\nthird thesis has been to grant a second-rate, i.e., a degraded and\ndependent, intentional status to sentences (see Haugeland 1981, Searle\n1980, 1983, 1992, Fodor 1987). On this view, sentences of natural\nlanguages have no intrinsic meaning of and by themselves.  Nor do\nutterances of sentences have an intrinsic content. Sentences of\nnatural languages would fail to have any meaning unless it was\nconferred to them by people who use them to express their thoughts and\ncommunicate them to others. Utterances borrow whatever\n‘derived’ intentionality they have from the\n‘original’ (or ‘primitive’) intentionality of\nhuman beings with minds that use them for their purposes (see Dennett\n1987 for dissent). If, as Jerry Fodor (1975, 1987, 1994, 1998, 2008)\nhas argued, there exists a “language of thought”\nconsisting of mental symbols with syntactic and semantic properties,\nthen possibly the semantic properties of mental symbols are the\nprimary bearers of ‘original’ intentionality. (See\nthe SEP entry for the\n language of thought hypothesis.)  \nSo the question is: does any non-mental thing exhibit\n‘original’ intentionality? The question is made more\npressing by Quine’s dilemma, according to which one must choose\nbetween Brentano’s third thesis and a physicalist ontology. So-called\n‘eliminative materialists’ (see Churchland 1989)\nresolutely opt for the second horn of Quine’s dilemma and deny purely\nand simply the reality of human beliefs and desires. As a consequence\nof their denial of the reality of beliefs and desires, the eliminative\nmaterialists must face the challenge raised by the existence of\nphysical objects whose existence depends on the intentions, beliefs\nand desires of their designers, i.e., human artifacts. Others, like\nDaniel Dennett (1971, 1978, 1987), who reject the distinction between\noriginal and derived intentionality, take a so-called\n‘instrumentalist’ position. On their view, the intentional\nidiom fails to describe or explain any real phenomenon. However, in\nthe absence of detailed knowledge of the physical laws that govern the\nbehavior of a physical system, the intentional idiom is a useful\nstance for predicting a system’s behavior. Among philosophers\nattracted to a physicalist ontology, few have accepted the outright\neliminativist materialist denial of the reality of beliefs and\ndesires. Nor have many of them found it easy to answer the puzzling\nquestion raised by the instrumentalist position: how can the\nintentional idiom make useful predictions if it fails to describe and\nexplain anything real? \n\n A significant number of physicalist philosophers subscribe to the\ntask of reconciling the existence of intentionality with a physicalist\nontology (for a forceful exposition see Field 1978, 78–79). On the\nassumption that intentionality is central to the mental, the task is\nto show, in Dennett’s (1969, 21) terms, that there is not an\n“unbridgeable gulf between the mental and the physical” or\nthat one can subscribe to both physicalism and intentional\nrealism. Because intentional states are of or about\nthings other than themselves, for a state to have intentionality is\nfor it to have semantic properties. As Jerry Fodor (1984) put it, the\nnaturalistic worry of intentional realists who are physicalists is\nthat “the semantic proves permanently recalcitrant to\nintegration to the natural order”. Given that on a physicalist\nontology, intentionality or semantic properties cannot be\n“fundamental features of the world,” the task is to show\n“how an entirely physical system could nevertheless exhibit\nintentional states” (Fodor, 1987). As Dretske (1981) puts it,\nthe task is to show how to “bake a mental cake using only\nphysical yeast and flour”. Notice that Brentano’s own view that\n‘no physical phenomenon manifests’ intentionality is\nsimply unacceptable to a physicalist. If physicalism is true, then\nsome physical things are also mental things. The question for a\nphysicalist is: does any non-mental thing manifest intentionality? \n\n Clearly, one way to relieve the tension between physicalism and\nintentional realism is to argue that intentionality can be, and in\nfact is, exhibited by non-mental things. There have been several\nproposals in analytic philosophy in the past twenty years to suggest\nways of accomplishing this program, which has been called ‘the\nnaturalization of intentionality.’ The common strategy is to\nshow that Brentano was wrong in claiming that only mental things can\nexhibit intentionality. This strategy is related to the assumption\nthat intentional relations whose relata are concrete particulars\nshould have primacy over intentional relations whose relata are not\n(see\n section 7).\n I shall illustrate two distinct proposals for implementing this\ncommon goal. \n\n One influential strategy for showing that non-mental things can\nexhibit intentionality has been Fred Dretske’s (1980, 1981, 1994)\ninformation-theoretic proposal that a device that carries\ninformation does exhibit some degree of intentionality. The view is an\nextension of Paul Grice’s (1957) notion of natural meaning:\nunlike the English word ‘fire,’ which non-naturally means\nfire, smoke naturally means fire. The word ‘fire’ can be\ntokened in the absence of any fire either for the purpose of\nexpressing a thought about what to do if there was one or perhaps to\nmislead somebody else into falsely thinking that there is one. But\nthere cannot be any smoke unless there is a fire. As we shall see\nmomentarily, it is a feature of both the original intentionality of\nbeliefs and the derived intentionality of utterances that they can be\nmisrepresentations. \n\n In essence, the information-theoretic proposal is that device\nS carries information about instantiations of property\nG if and only if S’s being F is nomically\ncorrelated with instantiations of G. If S would not\nbe F unless property G were instantiated, then\nS’s being F carries information about, or as Dretske\nlikes to say, indicates G-ness. A fingerprint carries\ninformation about the identity of the human being whose finger was\nimprinted. Spots on a human face carry information about a\ndisease. The height of the column of mercury in a thermometer carries\ninformation about the temperature. A gas-gauge on the dashboard of a\ncar carries information about the amount of fuel in the car tank. The\nposition of a needle in a galvanometer carries information about the\nflow of electric current. A compass carries information about the\nlocation of the North pole. In all such cases, a property of a\nphysical device nomically covaries with some physical property\ninstantiated in its environment (for critical discussion of the\ninformational program, see Kistler 2000, Loewer 1987, 1998 and\nPutnam 1986). \n\nNow, insofar as it is not a law that polar bears live at the\nNorth pole, even though they happen to live there, a compass will fail\nto carry information about where polar bears happen to live in spite\nof the fact that it does carry information about the North pole. If\nso, then reports of what a compass indicates exhibit one of Chisholm’s\nfeatures of intensionality, namely coextensive terms are not freely\nsubstitutable salva veritate in such reports. By contrast, if\nit is law that variations of temperature covary with variations in\natmospheric pressure, then by virtue of indicating the temperature,\nthe height of the column of mercury in a thermometer will also\nindicate atmospheric pressure. If there is a law relating current flow\nto voltage differences, then by indicating the former, a galvanometer\nwill indicate the latter. One can, however, believe and even know that\nthere is a current flow between two points without believing, let\nalone knowing, that there is a voltage difference between the two\npoints, if one fails to know that it is a law that if there is flow of\nelectric current between two points, then there is a voltage\ndifference between these two points (see Jacob 1997 for\ndiscussion). \n\n So although reports of the information carried by such physical\ndevices exhibit some of the intensionality exhibited by reports of\nintentional mental states, the intensionality exhibited by the latter\nis clearly stronger than the intensionality exhibited by the\nformer. On the one hand, it is difficult to generate the strong\nintentionality of mental states from the information-theoretic account\nof the weak intentionality of non-mental things. On the other hand,\ngiven that the information relation is the converse of a nomic\ncorrelation, it is difficult for informational semantics to account\nfor misrepresentation as well as for the normativity of the contents\nof mental states. See the entry on \n causal theories of mental content.. \n\nA second influential proposal for dealing with the difficulties left\npending by the information-theoretic approach and for showing that\nsome non-mental things can exhibit intentionality has been Ruth\nMillikan’s (1984, 1993, 2000, 2004) teleosemantic\napproach. Millikan’s teleosemantic approach rests on two basic\nassumptions, the first of which is that (unlike a natural sign) an\nintentional representation is a relatum in a three-place relation\ninvolving two mechanisms: a producer of the representation and a\nconsumer, both of which are cooperative devices whose activities are\nbeneficial to both. Millikan’s second assumption is that Brentano’s\nrelation of intentional inexistence is exhibited by biological\nfunctions. Given any sort of biological purpose or design, it might\nfail to be fulfilled. For example, if it is the function or purpose of\na mammal’s heart to pump blood, then a mammal’s heart ought to pump\nblood even though it might fail to do so. Notice, however, that\nwhereas biological organs have functions that may fail to be\nfulfilled, they do not ipso facto exhibit intentionality in\nBrentano’s full sense: neither a heart nor a stomach are of\nor about anything. Millikan’s claim, however, is not that\nhaving a function is sufficient for aboutness, but that it is\nnecessary. Arguably, a device cannot be about or represent anything\nunless it can misrepresent what it is about. Presumably, for a device\nto misrepresent what it is about is for it to misfunction. But unless\nthe device had some function, it could simply not misfunction. If this\nis correct, then nothing could be a representational\nsystem—nothing could have content or intentionality—unless\nit had what Millikan (1984) calls a ‘proper’ function. \n\nThe relevant notion of a function here is the biological teleological,\nnot the dispositional one: the function of an organ is not what the\norgan is disposed to do, but what it was selected to do (see Millikan\n1984 and Neander 1995). Arguably, nothing can have a function unless\nit results from some historical process of selection or\nother. Selection processes are design processes. Most advocates of\nteleosemantics accept the etiological account of functions according\nto which the function of a device is a selected effect, i.e. an effect\nproduced by the device that explains the continued proliferation of\ntokens of this type of device. Thus, according to\n“teleosemantic” theories, design is the main source of\nfunction, which in turn is the source of content or\nintentionality. Such theories are called “teleosemantic”\ntheories in virtue of the connection between design or teleology and\ncontent. One contentious issue is whether the teleological approach\nchampioned by Millikan can be combined with informational semantics so\nthat S can be said to represent instances of\nproperty F if and only if it is S’s function to\ncarry information about F. Against this proposal, Millikan\n(2004) has argued that the information carried by a sign depends on\nits causes, not its effects. But according to teleosemantics and the\netiological approach to functions, the function of a device is one of\nits effects: it does not depend on its causes. For further discussion,\nsee the SEP entry on teleological theories of mental content and the\npapers collected in Ryder, Kinsbury and Williford (eds.)(2011).  \n\nNow, selection processes can be intentional or non-intentional.\nArtifacts (including words and other symbols of natural languages)\nderive their functions from some intentional process. While\npsychological mechanisms (e.g., belief-forming mechanisms) derive their\nproper functions from a\nnon-intentional selection process, particular belief states\nhave derived proper functions. The paradigmatic non-intentional\nprocess is the process of natural selection by which Charles Darwin\nexplained the phylogenetic evolution of biological species: natural\nselection sorts organisms that survive. But no intentional agent is\nresponsible for the sorting. Millikan (1984, 2004, 2005) has also\nextended her teleosemantic approach to the contents of intentional\nconventional signs (i.e. linguistic symbols). If this sort of\nteleosemantic proposal could be fully worked out, then it would kill\ntwo birds with one stone. On the one hand, it would point a way in\nwhich the intentionality of minds derives from the intentionality of\nbiological things (see Rowlands 1999 for discussion). On the other\nhand, it would show that some of the normativity of mental states is\nalready exhibited by biological functions (see Neander, 1995). Both\nquestions are currently topics of much discussion in the philosophy of\nmind. Many philosophers such as Davidson (1980), Kripke (1982),\nMcDowell (1994) and Putnam (1988, 1994), for example, have either\nexpressed serious reservations about the program or provided reasons\nfor scepticism. For further discussion, see the essays in MacDonald\nand Papineau (eds.) 2006, and also the entries on\n teleological theories of mental content\nand\n teleological notions in biology. \nSubsequently Burge (2010)  criticized attempts to naturalize\nintentionality by appeal to the notion of biological function on the\ngrounds that it is, according to him, a deep mistake to identify\nrepresentational success (truth or accuracy) with fulfillment of\nbiological function and representational failure (falsity or\ninaccuracy) with failure of biological function. Unlike\nrepresentational (or semantic) success or failure, fulfillment or\nfailure of a biological function is, according to Burge, practical\nsuccess or failure.  \n\n Perceptions, beliefs, desires and intentions and many other\n“propositional attitudes” are mental states with\nintentionality. They are about or represent objects and states of\naffairs under a particular psychological mode or format.  Perceptions,\nbeliefs, desires and intentions illustrate a basic duality of the\nintentionality of the mental: the duality between mind-to-world and\nworld-to-mind directions of fit. In order to clarify this duality,\nElizabeth Anscombe (1957, 56) considers a mere “shopping\nlist”. The list may either be used as a set of instructions (or\na blueprint) for action by a customer in a store or it can be used as\nan inventory by a detective whose purpose is to draw a record of what\nthe customer is buying. In the former case, the list is not to be\nrevised in the light of what lies in the customer’s grocery bag. But\nin the latter case, it is. If a mismatch should occur between the\ncontent of the grocery bag and the list used by the customer, then the\nblame should be put on the customer, not on the list. In the case of a\nmismatch between the content of the bag and the list drawn by the\ndetective, the detective should correct his list. \n\n Building on Anscombe’s insight, Searle (1983) argues that there are\ntwo opposite “directions of fit” that either speech acts\nor mental states can exemplify: just as the speech act of assertion\nhas a word-to-world direction of fit, beliefs and perceptions have a\nmind-to-world direction of fit. It is the function of an assertion to\nstate a fact or an actual state of affairs. Similarly, it is the\nfunction of a belief and a perception to match a fact. Unlike\nassertions, orders have a world-to-word direction of fit. Unlike\nbeliefs and perceptions, desires and intentions have a world-to-mind\ndirection of fit. It is the function of an order to represent a\nnon-actual possible or impossible state of affairs. Similarly, it is\nthe function of a desire and an intention to represent a non-actual\npossible or impossible state of affairs.  \n\n Now the following questions arise: are Brentano and the\nphenomenological tradition right? Do all mental states exhibit\nintentionality? Is intentionality a feature of every aspect of human\nexperience? Are all forms of consciousness consciousness of\nsomething? Does every mental state possess one or the other direction\nof fit? Do sensations (e.g., pains), feelings, emotions (e.g.,\ndepression) all exhibit intentionality? These questions are very\ncontroversial in contemporary philosophy of mind. Before examining\nvarious contradictory answers to these questions, a preliminary\nquestion is relevant. Whether Brentano was right or not, why should we\nwant a mark or a criterion of the mental at all? \n\n The question of why we should seek a criterion of the mental at all\nhas been made pressing by some recent remarks of the linguist Noam\nChomsky (2000, 75, 106), according to whom methodological naturalism\nmandates that we use terms like ‘mind’ and\n‘mental’ on a par with terms like ‘chemical’,\n‘optical’ or ‘electrical.’ Since we do not\nseek to determine the true criterion of the electrical or the mark of\nthe chemical, by naturalistic parity of reasoning, Chomsky argues, we\nshould no more seek a criterion of the mental. Whether we need\ncriteria respectively for the chemical and for the optical, it is a\ngenuine issue whether the English word ‘mental’ can\njustifiably apply to things as diverse as e.g., a pain and the belief\nthat 5 is a prime number. As Richard Rorty (1979, 22) has put it,\n“the attempt to hitch pains and beliefs together seems ad\nhoc—they don’t seem to have anything in common except our\nrefusal to call them ‘physical’”.  His conclusion is\nthat the word ‘mental’ expresses no single property, let\nalone a ‘natural kind.’ On Rorty’s irrealist view, the\nword ‘mental’ is just part of an academic language-game\nwith no scientific explanatory import. \n\n Thus, Rorty’s radical irrealist picture of the mind relies on the\nobservation that pains and arithmetical beliefs seem to have nothing\nin common. Not many contemporary philosophers of mind would accept\nRorty’s irrealist picture of the mind. But most do recognize that if\nminds are real, then two problems arise: the problem of\nintentionality and the problem of consciousness or conscious\nphenomenal experience.  Most would claim that a solution to the\nproblem of intentionality is not ipso facto a solution to the\nproblem of consciousness. Why is that so? \n\n Human beings can experience the world in various ways by means of\nseveral distinct sensory modalities (vision, audition, touch,\nolfaction). They are also aware of parts of their bodies as when they\nsuffer pains. The problem of consciousness is often called “the\nproblem of qualia” because states with a strong\nphenomenal character—like pains, visual or olfactory\nsensations—are states that introspectively seem endowed with a\nstrong intrinsic subjective quality. The general problem of\nconsciousness is to explain, in Thomas Nagel’s (1974) famous phrase,\n“what it is like” to be a certain creature with a\nphenomenal experience. What is the phenomenal character—the\nphenomenology—of the various forms of human experience? Few if\nany philosophers—physicalist or otherwise—are inclined\nto assume that, unlike intentionality, phenomenal consciousness can be\nexemplified by non-mental things. Not many would deny that, although\npains, visual sensations, olfactory sensations, auditive sensations\nare very different experiences, nonetheless they all exhibit a common\nproperty called “phenomenal consciousness”. From both a\nscientific and a physicalist perspective, the questions arise whether\nphenomenal consciousness is physical and whether it can be explained\nin physical terms, i.e., as a result of processes happening in the\nbrain. \n\n As many philosophers are willing to recognize, the concept expressed\nby the word ‘consciousness’ is much in need of\nclarification. Three such clarifications are worth mentioning. Two of\nthem consist in a pair of distinctions drawn by David Rosenthal\n(1986). One distinction is between creature consciousness and state\nconsciousness. The other distinction is between transitive and\nintransitive consciousness. A creature can be said to be\n‘intransitively’ conscious if she is alive and normally\nresponsive to ongoing stimuli. She stops being intransitively\nconscious while in a dreamless sleep, if she is knocked out, drugged\nor comatose. A creature can be said to be ‘transitively’\nconscious if she is conscious of things, properties and\nrelations in her environment. Whereas a creature can be both\nintransitively conscious and transitively conscious of something, a\nmental state can only be intransitively conscious. One important\naspect of the problem of consciousness is the problem of how to draw\nthe line between conscious and unconscious mental states. A third\nclarification has been Ned Block’s (1995) distinction between access\nconsciousness (or A-consciousness) and phenomenal consciousness (or\nP-consciousness). Whereas a state is said to be A-conscious if it is\npoised for free use in reasoning and for direct rational control of\naction and speech (i.e. available or accessible to several cognitive\nmechanisms), the P-consciousness of a state is what it is like to be\nin that state (whether or not it has A-consciousness). In recent work,\nBlock (2007) has argued that much evidence from the cognitive\nscientific investigation of the visual system corroborates his\ndistinction between P- and A-consciousness. For example, on his\ninterpretation, experiments on change blindness and also the\nneuropsychological investigation of brain-lesioned human patients with\nneglect show that attention and working memory are necessary parts of\nA-consciousness, but not of P-consciousness. What makes a state\nA-conscious is that its content is made available to various cognitive\nsystems (e.g., attention and memory). Furthermore, not unless a visual\nstimulus is attended and stored in working memory can an individual\nreport having seen it. But Block (2007) takes the evidence to show\nthat an individual can be P-conscious of the content of an\nunreportable stimulus, i.e. a stimulus whose content has not been\neither attended or stored in working memory. For supporting arguments,\nsee Dretske (2004, 2007). Block’s interpretation of the cognitive\nscientific data has been criticized by scientific advocates of the\nso-called “global neuronal workspace model” of\nconsciousness: see e.g., Dehaene et al. (2006) and Naccache and Dehaene\n(2007), which is a commentary to Block (2007). The global neuronal\nworkspace model of consciousness nicely fits with Dennett’s (1991,\n2005) position on intentionality and consciousness (which he has\nhimself dubbed the “fame (in the brain) theory of\nconsciousness.” (For further discussion of these issues, see the\nSEP entry on\n attention.) \n\n On the one hand, the notion of transitive creature consciousness\nseems like a close cousin to the notion of intentionality. On the\nother hand, what makes a person’s mental state A-conscious is that the\nperson may have access to it. Presumably, a person may have conscious\naccess to one of her A-conscious mental states in virtue of having\nsome other mental state (e.g., a thought or belief) directed to it. So\nhaving states with intentionality seems like a condition for any\nmental state to be A-conscious. It follows that if the problem of\nconsciousness is to be clearly distinguished from the problem of\nintentionality, the key question is that of explaining how a mental\nstate can be P-conscious. \n\n Many philosophers do not accept Brentano’s third thesis that\nintentionality is the mark of all mental states. They do not reject\nBrentano’s second thesis on the grounds that intentionality can be\nexhibited by some non-mental things. They reject it because, like\nBlock (1996) and Peacocke (1983), they subscribe to a view that can be\ncalled ‘anti-intentionalism,’ according to which a\nperson’s conscious mental state has a phenomenal character that cannot\nbe accounted either by its own intentionality (if it has any) or by\nthe intentionality of some other of his or her mental states. Nor do\nthey embrace Rorty’s irrealist attitude towards the mental. Some of\nthe philosophers, who fall under the label\n‘anti-intentionalism,’ may accept the thesis that\nintentionality and the mental happen to coincide. But since they claim\nthat intentionality in turn derives from phenomenal consciousness,\nthey are not quite faithful to the spirit of Brentano’s thesis\nthat intentionality is the constitutive feature of the\nmental.  \n\n The anti-intentionalists, who reject both Rorty’s irrealism and\nBrentano’s thesis that intentionality is the true mark of the mental,\ncan be divided into two groups. Some, like Ned Block (1995, 1996),\nwould accept a dual view according to which mental states\nfall into a division between intentional states and phenomenal\nstates. As we shall see momentarily, this division is denied by the\nintentionalists.  In between the intentionalists and the phenomenal\nrealists, who accept the dual view, lies the intermediate view of\nphilosophers such as Colin McGinn (1989), Sydney Shoemaker (1996) and\nCharles Siewert (1998), who see an intimate connection between\nintentional and phenomenal states. \n\n Other anti-intentionalists, like John Searle (1990, 1992) and Galen\nStrawson (1994), go one step further and reject both Brentano’s thesis\nand the dual view of the mind. They hold consciousness to be the true\ncriterion of the mental. Arguably, as noted above, they might accept\nthe thesis that intentionality coincides with the mental, but they\nhold the view that intentionality derives from consciousness. On the\none hand, Strawson (1994) clearly holds phenomenal consciousness to be\nthe true criterion of the mental. On the other hand, Searle (1992)\nembraces what he calls “the Connection principle,”\naccording to which unless a mental state is available to\nconsciousness, it does not qualify as genuinely mental. As a result,\nSearle (1992) seems to endorse the view that availability to\nconsciousness is the criterion of the mental. Now, the view that\navailability to consciousness is the true criterion of the mental\nentails that states and processes that are investigated by cognitive\nscience and that are unavailable to consciousness will fail to qualify\nas genuine mental states. This view has been vigorously disputed by\nChomsky (2000). On the natural assumption that beliefs are\nparadigmatic mental states, the view that phenomenal consciousness is\nthe true criterion of the mental further entails that there is\nsomething it is like to have such a propositional attitude as\nbelieving that 5 is a prime number—a consequence some find\ndoubtful. If there was nothing it is like to believe that 5 is a prime\nnumber, then, according to the view that phenomenal consciousness is\nthe criterion of the mental, many propositional attitudes would fail\nto qualify as genuine mental states. However, much recent work in the\nphilosophy of mind has been recently devoted to the defense of\nso-called \"cognitive phenomenology,\" according to which there is\nsomething it is like to believe that e.g., 5 is a prime number. See the\nSEP entry on consciousness and the papers collected in Bayne and\nMontague (eds.) (2011).  \n\n Many of the philosophers who accept a version of Brentano’s thesis\nthat all mental states exhibit intentionality try to show that the\nmysteries of phenomenal consciousness can either be explained away\n(i.e., dissolved) or that phenomenal consciousness derives from\nintentionality. Daniel Dennett (1988, 1991, 2001) has been the most\nconsistent advocate of the view that the distinction between\nphenomenal consciousness and access consciousness has been overrated\nand that qualia ought to ‘quined,’ i.e.,\nresolutely denied and dispensed with. \n\n So-called “intentionalists” are philosophers who think\nthat phenomenal consciousness can really be explained by\nintentionality because they think that phenomenal states are\nintentional states. On the intentionalist account, the phenomenal\nqualities of an experience are the properties that objects are\nrepresented as having in the experience. Some intentionalists, like\nFred Dretske (1995) and Michael Tye (1995), think that whereas\nthoughts and propositional attitudes are mental representations with\nconceptual content, qualia or conscious experiences are\nmental representations with nonconceptual content (about\nwhich see Dretske 1981, Peacocke 1992, 2001 and the essays in Crane\n1992). On their view, to have phenomenal features is to have a certain\nsort of nonconceptual content. On Tye’s (1995) view, for example,\npains are mental representations of bodily parts and the phenomenal\nexperience of a pain is the nonconceptual content of the bodily\nrepresentation. Other intentionalists such as Elizabeth Anscombe\n(1965) and especially John McDowell (1994), who are skeptical of the\ndistinction between conceptual and nonconceptual content, will appeal\nto other criteria, e.g., functional role, to account for phenomenal\nstates (see the SEP entry on Nonconceptual mental content). For\nexample, McDowell (1994) argues that the phenomenal content of\nexperience can be explained in terms of a suitable notion of\ndemonstrative conceptual content. \n\nThere are currently two outstanding issues facing an intentionalist\napproach to phenomenal experiences. The first is whether the\nintentionalist account can be extended to the phenomenal character of\nall sensory and bodily experiences. This is at present an open\nquestion (cf. Crane, 2007). The second issue is whether the\nnonconceptual content of perceptual experiences can be objective in\nrepresenting and referring to particular objects, or whether only\nconceptual thoughts can be objective and represent or refer to\nparticular objects. On the one hand, Evans (1982), Dretske (1981,\n1995) and Peacocke (1992) assume that propositional thought or\nconceptual content is required to achieve reference to particulars. On\nthe other hand, Burge (2010) has offered powerful considerations\n(mostly derived from perceptual psychology) in favor of the\nobjectivity of purely perceptual representations. On Burge’s view,\nperceptual representations are both sensory representations and\nobjective representations of the environment: they have nonconceptual\ncontent, but they do not need to be supplemented by conceptual\ncapacities in order to represent particulars. \n      \n Finally, according to David Rosenthal’s “higher-order\nthought” theory of consciousness, what makes a person’s mental\nstate conscious is that the person is conscious of it by virtue of\nhaving formed a higher-order thought (or HOT) about it. Furthermore,\nthe phenomenal character of a person’s sensory experience—what\nit is like for the person to be in that state—arises from the\nfact that the person has formed a HOT about it. The problem with the\nHOT theory of phenomenal consciousness is that the theory entails that\ncreatures who, like non-human animals and human babies, lack the\nability to form HOTs will be deprived of phenomenal\nconsciousness—a consequence many will find implausible\n(cf. Rosenthal, 1986, 2005).
