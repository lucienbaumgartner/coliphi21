As children we are\ntaught (one hopes) to respect our parents, teachers, and elders,\nschool rules and traffic laws, family and cultural traditions, other\npeople's feelings and rights, our country's flag and leaders, the\ntruth and people's differing opinions. And we come to value respect\nfor such things; when we're older, we may shake our heads (or fists)\nat people who seem not to have learned to respect them. We develop\ngreat respect for people we consider exemplary and lose respect for\nthose we discover to be clay-footed, and so we may try to respect only\nthose who are truly worthy of our respect. We may also come to believe\nthat, at some level, all people are worthy of respect. We may learn\nthat jobs and relationships become unbearable if we receive no respect\nin them; in certain social milieus we may learn the price of\ndisrespect if we violate the street law: “Diss me, and you\ndie.” Calls to respect this or that are increasingly part of\npublic life: environmentalists exhort us to respect nature, foes of\nabortion and capital punishment insist on respect for human life,\nmembers of racial and ethnic minorities and those discriminated\nagainst because of their gender, sexual orientation, age, religious\nbeliefs, or economic status demand respect both as social and moral\nequals and for their cultural differences. And it is widely\nacknowledged that public debates about such demands should take place\nunder terms of mutual respect. We may learn both that our lives\ntogether go better when we respect the things that deserve to be\nrespected and that we should respect some things independently of\nconsiderations of how our lives would go.\n\n\n\nWe may also learn that how our lives go depends every bit as much on\nwhether we respect ourselves. The value of self-respect may be\nsomething we can take for granted, or we may discover how very\nimportant it is when our self-respect is threatened, or we lose it and\nhave to work to regain it, or we have to struggle to develop or\nmaintain it in a hostile environment. Some people find that finally\nbeing able to respect themselves is what matters most about getting\noff welfare, kicking a disgusting habit, or defending something they\nvalue; others, sadly, discover that life is no longer worth living if\nself-respect is irretrievably lost. It is part of everyday wisdom that\nrespect and self-respect are deeply connected, that it is difficult if\nnot impossible both to respect others if we don't respect ourselves\nand to respect ourselves if others don't respect us. It is\nincreasingly part of political wisdom both that unjust social\ninstitutions can devastatingly damage self-respect and that robust and\nresilient self-respect can be a potent force in struggles against\ninjustice.\n\n\n\nThe ubiquity and significance of respect and self-respect in everyday\nlife largely explains why philosophers, particularly in moral and\npolitical philosophy, have been interested in these two concepts. They\nturn up in a multiplicity of philosophical contexts, including\ndiscussions of justice and equality, injustice and oppression,\nautonomy and agency, moral and political rights and duties, moral\nmotivation and moral development, cultural diversity and toleration,\npunishment and political violence.  The concepts are also invoked in\nbioethics, environmental ethics, business ethics, workplace ethics,\nand a host of other applied ethics contexts. Although a wide variety\nof things are said to deserve respect, contemporary philosophical\ninterest in respect has overwhelmingly been focused on respect for\npersons, the idea that all persons should be treated with respect\nsimply because they are persons. Respect for persons is a central\nconcept in many ethical theories; some theories treat it as the very\nessence of morality and the foundation of all other moral duties and\nobligations. This focus owes much to the 18th century\nGerman philosopher, Immanuel Kant, who argued that all and only\npersons (i.e., rational autonomous agents) and the moral law they\nautonomously legislate are appropriate objects of the morally most\nsignificant attitude of respect. Although honor, esteem, and\nprudential regard played important roles in moral and political\ntheories before him, Kant was the first major Western philosopher to put\nrespect for persons, including oneself as a person, at the very center\nof moral theory, and his insistence that persons are ends in\nthemselves with an absolute dignity who must always be respected has\nbecome a core ideal of modern humanism and political liberalism. In\nrecent years many people have argued that moral respect ought also to\nbe extended to things other than persons, such as nonhuman living\nthings and the natural environment.\n\n\n\nDespite the widespread acknowledgment of the importance of respect\nand self-respect in moral and political life and theory, there is no\nsettled agreement in either everyday thinking or philosophical\ndiscussion about such issues as how to understand the concepts, what\nthe appropriate objects of respect are, what is involved in respecting\nvarious objects, what the conditions are for self-respect, and what\nthe scope is of any moral requirements regarding respect and\nself-respect. This entry will survey these and related issues.\n\n\n\nAmong the main questions about respect that philosophers have\naddressed are these: (1) How should respect in general be understood?\n(a) What category of thing is it? Philosophers have variously\nidentified it as a mode of behavior, a form of treatment, a kind of\nvaluing, a type of attention, a motive, an attitude, a feeling, a\ntribute, a principle, a duty, an entitlement, a moral virtue, an\nepistemic virtue: are any of these categories more central than\nothers?  (b) What are the distinctive elements of respect? (c) To what\nother attitudes, actions, valuings, duties, etc. is respect similar,\nand with what does it contrast? (d) What beliefs, attitudes, emotions,\nmotives, and conduct does respect involve, and with what is it\nincompatible? (2) What are the appropriate objects of respect, i.e.,\nthe sorts of things that can be reasonably said to warrant respect?\n(3) What are the bases or grounds for respect, i.e., the features of\nor facts about objects in virtue of which it is reasonable and perhaps\nobligatory to respect them? (4) What ways of acting and forbearing to\nact express or constitute or are regulated by respect?  (5) What moral\nrequirements, if any, are there to respect certain types of objects,\nand what is the scope and theoretical status of such requirements? (6)\nAre there different levels or degrees of respect? Can an object come\nto deserve less or no respect? (7) Why is respect morally important?\nWhat, if anything, does it add to morality over and above the conduct,\nattitudes, and character traits required or encouraged by various\nmoral principles or virtues? (8) What are the implications of respect\nfor problematic moral and sociopolitical issues such as racism and\nsexism, pornography, privacy, punishment, responses to terrorism,\npaternalism in health care contexts, cultural diversity, affirmative\naction, abortion, and so on? \n\nIt is widely acknowledged that there are different kinds of respect,\nwhich complicates the answering of these questions. For example,\nanswers concerning one kind of respect can diverge significantly from\nthose about another kind. Much philosophical work has gone into\nexplicating differences and links among the various kinds. One general\ndistinction is between respect simply as behavior and respect as an\nattitude or feeling which may or may not be expressed in or signified\nby behavior.  We might speak of drivers respecting the speed limit,\nhostile forces as respecting a cease fire agreement, or AIDS as not\nrespecting national borders, and in such cases we can be referring\nsimply to behavior which avoids violation of or interference with some\nboundary, limit, or rule, without any reference to attitudes,\nfeelings, intentions, or dispositions, and even, as in the case of the\nAIDS virus, without imputing agency (Bird 2004). In such cases the\nbehavior is regarded as constitutive of respecting.  In other cases,\nwe take respect to be or to express or signify an attitude or feeling,\nas when we speak of having respect for another person or for nature or\nof certain behaviors as showing respect or disrespect. In what\nfollows, I will focus chiefly on respect as attitude or feeling. There\nare, again, several different attitudes or feelings to which the term\n“respect” refers.  Before looking at differences, however, it is\nuseful first to note some elements common among varieties. \n\nAn attitude of respect is, most generally, a relation between a\nsubject and an object in which the subject responds to the object from\na certain perspective in some appropriate way. Respect necessarily has\nan object: respect is always directed toward, paid to, felt about,\nshown for some object. While a very wide variety of things can be\nappropriate objects of one kind of respect or another, the subject of\nrespect (the respecter) is always a person, that is, a conscious\nrational being capable of recognizing and acknowledging things, of\nself-consciously and intentionally responding to them, of having and\nexpressing values with regard to them, and of being accountable for\ndisrespecting or failing to respect them. Though animals may love or\nfear us, only persons can respect and disrespect us or anything\nelse. Respect is a responsive relation, and ordinary discourse about\nrespect identifies several key elements of the response, including\nattention, deference, judgment, acknowledgment, valuing, and\nbehavior. First, as suggested by its derivation from the Latin\nrespicere, which means “to look back at” or\n“to look again,” respect is a particular mode of\napprehending the object: the person who respects something pays\nattention to it and perceives it differently from someone who does not\nand responds to it in light of that perception. This perceptual\nelement is common also to synonyms such as regard (from “to\nwatch out for”) and consideration (“examine (the stars)\ncarefully”). The idea of paying heed or giving proper attention\nto the object which is central to respect often means trying to see\nthe object clearly, as it really is in its own right, and not seeing\nit solely through the filter of one's own desires and fears or likes\nand dislikes. Thus, respecting something contrasts with being\noblivious or indifferent to it, ignoring or quickly dismissing it,\nneglecting or disregarding it, or carelessly or intentionally\nmisidentifying it. An object can be perceived by a subject from a\nvariety of perspectives; for example, one might rightly regard another\nhuman individual as a rights-bearer, a judge, a superlative singer, a\ntrustworthy person, or a threat to one's security. The respect one\naccords her in each case will be different, yet all will involve\nattention to her as she really is as a judge, threat, etc. It is in\nvirtue of this aspect of careful attention that respect is sometimes\nthought of as an epistemic virtue. \n\nAs responsive, respect is object-generated rather than wholly\nsubject-generated, something that is owed to, called for, deserved,\nelicited, or claimed by the object.  We respect something not because\nwe want to but because we recognize that we have to respect it (Wood\n1999); respect involves “a deontic experience”—the\nexperience that one must pay attention and respond\nappropriately (Birch 1993). It thus is motivational: it is the\nrecognition of something “as directly determining our will\nwithout reference to what is wanted by our inclinations” (Rawls\n2000, 153). In this way respect differs from, for example, liking and\nfearing, which have their sources in the subject's interests or\ndesires. When we respect something, we heed its call, accord it its\ndue, acknowledge its claim to our attention. Thus, respect involves\ndeference, in the most basic sense of yielding: self-absorption and\negocentric concerns give way to consideration of the object, one's\nmotives or feelings submit to the object's reality, one is disposed to\nact in obedience to the object's demands. \n\nAt the same time, respect is also an expression of agency: it is\ndeliberate, a matter of directed rather than grabbed attention, of\nreflective consideration and judgment. In particular, the subject\njudges that the object is due, deserves, or rightfully claims a\ncertain response in virtue of some feature of or fact about the object\nthat warrants that response. This feature or fact is the ground or\nbasis in the object, that in virtue of which it calls for respect. The\nbasis gives us a reason to respect the object; it may also indicate\nmore precisely how to respect it. Respect is thus reason-governed: we\ncannot respect a particular object for just any old reason or for no\nreason at all. Rather, we respect an object for the reason that it\nhas, in our judgment, some respect-warranting characteristic, that it\nis, in our view, the kind of object that calls for that kind of\nresponse (Cranor 1975; but see Buss 1999 for disagreement). And these\nreasons are categorical, in the sense that their weight or stringency\ndoes not depend on the subject's interests, goals, or desires; hence\nacting against these reasons, other things equal, is wrong (Raz\n2001). Respect is thus both subjective and objective. It is subjective\nin that the subject's response is constructed from her understanding\nof the object and its characteristics and her judgments about the\nlegitimacy of its call and how fittingly to address the call. An\nindividual's respect for an object can thus be inappropriate or\nunwarranted, for the object may not have the features she takes it to\nhave, or the features she takes to be respect-warranting might not be,\nor her idea of how properly to treat the object might be\nmistaken. But, as object-generated, the logic of respect is the logic\nof objectivity and universality, in four ways. First, in respecting an\nobject, we respond to it not as an extension of feelings, desires, and\ninterests we already have, but as something whose significance is\nindependent of us. Second, we experience the object as constraining\nour attitudes and actions. Third, our reasons for respecting something\nare, we logically have to assume, reasons for other people to respect\nit (or at least to endorse our respect for it from a common point of\nview). Respect is thus, unlike erotic or filial love, an impersonal\nresponse to the object. Fourth, respect is universalizing, in the\nsense that if F is a respect-warranting feature of object O, then\nrespecting O on account of F commits us, other things equal, to\nrespecting other things that also have feature F. In respect, then,\nsubjectivity defers to objectivity. \n\nThere are many different kinds of objects that can reasonably be\nrespected and many different reasons why they warrant respect; thus\nwarranted responses can take different forms beyond attention,\ndeference, and judgment. Some things are dangerous or powerful and\nrespect of them can involve fear, awe, self-protection, or\nsubmission. Other things have authority over us and the respect they\nare due includes acknowledgment of their authority and perhaps\nobedience to their authoritative commands. Other forms of respect are\nmodes of valuing, appreciating the object as having an objective worth\nor importance that is independent of, perhaps even at variance with,\nour antecedent desires or commitments. Thus, we can respect things we\ndon't like or agree with, such as our enemies or someone else's\nopinion. Valuing respect is kin to esteem, admiration, veneration,\nreverence, and honor, while regarding something as utterly worthless\nor insignificant or disdaining or having contempt for it is\nincompatible with respecting it. Respect also aims to value its object\nappropriately, so it contrasts with degradation and discounting. The\nkinds of valuing that respect involves also contrast with other forms\nof valuing such as promoting or using (Anderson 1993, Pettit\n1989). Indeed, regarding a person merely as useful (treating her as\njust a sexual object, an ATM machine, a research subject) is commonly\nidentified as a central form of disrespect for persons, and many\npeople decry the killing of endangered wild animals for their tusks or\nhides as despicably disrespectful of nature. Respect is sometimes\nidentified as a feeling; it is typically the experiencing of something\nas valuable that is in focus in these cases. \n\nFinally, respect is generally regarded as having a behavioral\ncomponent. In respecting an object, we often consider it to be making\nlegitimate claims on our conduct as well as our thoughts and feelings\nand are disposed to behave appropriately. Appropriate behavior\nincludes refraining from certain treatment of the object or acting\nonly in particular ways in connection with it, ways that are regarded\nas fitting, deserved by, or owed to the object. And there are very\nmany ways to respect things: keeping our distance from them, helping\nthem, praising or emulating them, obeying or abiding by them, not\nviolating or interfering with them, destroying them in some ways\nrather than letting them be destroyed in others, protecting or being\ncareful with them, talking about them in ways that reflect their worth\nor status, mourning them, nurturing them. One can behave in respectful\nways, however, without having respect for the object, as when a teen\nwho disdains adults behaves respectfully toward her friend's parents\nin a scheme to get the car, manipulating rather than respecting\nthem. To be a form or expression of respect, behavior has to be\nmotivated by one's acknowledgment of the object as calling for that\nbehavior, and it has to be motivated directly by consideration that\nthe object is what it is, without reference to one's own interests and\ndesires. On the other hand, certain kinds of feelings would not count\nas respect if they did not find expression in behavior or involved no\ndispositions to behave in certain ways rather than others, and if they\ndid not spring from the beliefs, perceptions, and judgments that the\nobject is worthy of or calls for such behavior.  \n\nThe attitudes of respect, then, have cognitive dimensions (beliefs,\nacknowledgments, judgments, deliberations, commitments), affective\ndimensions (emotions, feelings, ways of experiencing things), and\nconative dimensions (motivations, dispositions to act and forbear from\nacting); some forms also have valuational dimensions. The attitude is\ntypically regarded as central to respect: actions and modes of\ntreatment typically count as respect insofar as they either manifest\nan attitude of respect or are of a sort through which the attitude of\nrespect is characteristically expressed; a principle of respect is one\nthat, logically, must be adopted by someone with the attitude of\nrespect or that prescribes the attitude or actions that express it\n(Frankena 1986, Downie and Telfer 1969). \n\nThat it is the nature of the object that determines its\nrespect-worthiness, and that there are different kinds of objects\ncalling for correspondingly different responses has led many\nphilosophers to argue that there are different kinds of respect. In\nwhat follows, three sets of distinctions will be discussed. \n\nSpeculating on the historical development of the idea that all persons\nas such deserve respect, and using terms found in Kant's writings on\nAchtung (the German word usually translated as\n“respect”), Feinberg (1975) identifies three distinct\nconcepts for which “respect” has been the name. (1)\nRespekt, is the “uneasy and watchful attitude that has\n'the element of fear' in it” (1975,1). Its objects are dangerous\nthings or things with power over the subject. It is respekt\nthat woodworkers are encouraged to have for power tools, that a city\ndweller might have for street gangs, a new sailor might be admonished\nto have for the sea, a child might have for an abusive parent.\nRespekt contrasts with contemptuous disregard; it is shown in\nconduct that is cautious, self-protective, other-placating. (2) The\nsecond concept, observantia, is the moralized analogue of\nrespekt. It involves regarding the object as making a\nrightful claim on our conduct, as deserving moral consideration in its\nown right, independently of considerations of personal well being. It\nis observantia, Feinberg maintains, that historically was\nextended first to classes of non-dangerous but otherwise worthy people\nand then to all persons as such, regardless of merit or\nability. Observantia encompasses both the respect said to be\nowed to all humans equally and the forms of polite respect and\ndeference that acknowledge different social positions. (3)\nReverentia, the third concept, is the special feeling of\nprofound awe and respect we have in the presence of something\nextraordinary or sublime, a feeling that both humbles and uplifts\nus. On Kant's account, the moral law and people who exemplify it in\nmorally worthy actions elicit reverentia from us, for we\nexperience the law or its exemplification as “something that\nalways trumps our inclinations in determining our wills”\n(Feinberg 1975, 2). Feinberg sees different forms of power as\nunderlying the three kinds of respect; in each case, respect is the\nacknowledgment of the power of something other than ourselves to\ndemand, command, or make claims on our attention, consideration, and\ndeference. \n\nHudson (1980) draws a four-fold distinction among kinds of respect,\naccording to the bases in the objects. Consider the following sets of\nexamples: (a) respecting a colleague highly as a scholar and having a\nlot of respect for someone with “guts”; (b) a mountain\nclimber's respect for the elements and a tennis player's respect for\nher opponent's strong backhand; (c) respecting the terms of an\nagreement and respecting a person's rights; and (d) showing respect\nfor a judge by rising when she enters the courtroom and respecting a\nworn-out flag by burning it rather than tossing it in the trash. The\nrespect in (a), evaluative respect, is similar to other\nfavorable attitudes such as esteem and admiration; it is earned or\ndeserved (or not) depending on whether and to the degree that the\nobject is judged to meet certain standards.  Obstacle\nrespect, in (b), is a matter of regarding the object as something\nthat, if not taken proper account of in one's decisions about how to\nact, could prevent one from achieving one's ends. The objects of (c)\ndirective respect are directives: things such as requests,\nrules, advice, laws, or rights claims that may be taken as guides to\naction. One respects a directive when one's behaviors intentionally\ncomply with it. The objects of (d) institutional respect are\nsocial institutions or practices, the positions or roles defined\nwithin an institution or practice, and persons or things that occupy\nthe positions or represent the institution. Institutional respect is\nshown by behavior that conforms to rules that prescribe certain\nconduct as respectful. These four forms of respect differ in several\nways. Each identifies a quite different kind of feature of objects as\nthe basis of respect. Each is expressed in action in quite different\nways, although evaluative respect need not be expressed at all, one\ncan have institutional respect for an institution (e.g., the criminal\njustice system) without showing it for a particular element of it (the\njudge in this trial), and directive respect is not an attitude that\none might or might not express but a mode of conduct motivated by a\nrecognition of the directive's authority.  Evaluative respect\ncentrally involves having a favorable attitude toward the object,\nwhile the other forms do not. Directive respect does not admit of\ndegrees (one either obeys the rule or doesn't), but the others do (we\ncan have more evaluative respect for one person than another). Hudson\nuses this distinction to argue that respect for persons is not a\nunique kind of respect but should be conceived rather as involving\nsome combination or other of these four. \n\nTo Hudson's four-fold classification, Dillon (1992a) adds a fifth\nform, care respect, which is exemplified in an\nenvironmentalist's deep respect for nature. Care respect involves\nregarding the object as having profound and perhaps unique value and\nso cherishing it, and perceiving it as fragile or calling for special\ncare and so acting or forbearing to act out of felt benevolent concern\nfor it. This analysis of respect draws explicitly from a feminist\nethics of care and has been influential in feminist and non-feminist\ndiscussions of respecting persons as unique, particular\nindividuals. \n\nDarwall (1977) distinguishes two kinds of respect: recognition\nrespect and appraisal respect. Recognition respect is\nthe disposition to give appropriate weight or consideration in one's\npractical deliberations to some fact about the object and to regulate\none's conduct by constraints derived from that fact. (Frankena 1986\nand Cranor 1982, 1983 refer to this as “consideration\nrespect.”) A wide variety of objects can be objects of\nrecognition respect, including laws, dangerous things, someone's\nfeelings, social institutions, nature, the selves individuals present\nin different contexts, and persons as such. Appraisal respect, by\ncontrast, is an attitude of positive appraisal of a person or their\nmerits, which are features of persons that manifest excellences of\ncharacter.  Individuals can be the objects of appraisal respect either\nas persons or as engaged in some pursuit or occupying some\nrole. Evaluation is always done in light of some qualitative\nstandards, and different standards can apply to one and the same\nindividual. Thus, appraisal respect is a matter of degree, depending\non the extent to which the object meets the standards (so, we can\nrespect someone more or less highly and respect one person more highly\nthan another), and it can co-exist with (some) negative assessments of\nan individual or her traits (judged in light of other standards). We\ncan have appraisal respect for someone's honesty even while thinking\nher lazy, and we can highly respect someone else as altogether a\nmorally fine person; we can respect an individual as an excellent\nteacher or carpenter yet regard her as far from a moral\nexemplar. Darwall (1977) distinguishes appraisal respect, which is\nbased on assessment of character traits, from esteem, another attitude\nof positive assessment whose wider basis include any features in\nvirtue of which one can think well of someone. However, other\nphilosophers treat “esteem” and (appraisal)\n“respect” as synonyms, and Darwall (2004) calls appraisal\nrespect a form of esteem. \n\nThe recognition/appraisal distinction has been quite influential and\nis widely regarded as the fundamental distinction. If it is, then it\nshould encompass the other distinctions (although some fine-tuning\nmight be necessary). And indeed, evaluative respect and perhaps\nreverentia for morally good persons are essentially\nthe same as appraisal respect, while respekt, obstacle\nrespect, observantia, directive respect, institutional\nrespect, and care respect can be analyzed as forms of recognition\nrespect. Some philosophers, however, have found the\nrecognition/appraisal distinction to be inadequate. Neither\nreverentia for the moral law nor the felt experience of\nreverential respect for the sublimity of persons as such (Buss 1999)\nare forms of appraisal respect, yet because recognition respect is\nanalyzed, first, as holding only in deliberative contexts, and second,\nas not essentially involving feeling, reverentia seems also\nnot to be a form of recognition respect. Moreover, while valuing the\nobject is not part of Darwall's analysis of recognition\nrespect—and it is not essential to some forms of recognition\nrespect (e.g., directive respect) and is only indirectly involved in\nother forms (in obstacle respect, we don't value the obstacle but do\nvalue the goal it blocks us from reaching)—valuing is essential\nto some forms of respect that are not appraisal respect. In\nparticular, valuing persons intrinsically is widely regarded as the\nheart of the respect that all persons are thought to be owed simply as\npersons. However, it is not sufficient simply to gloss recognition\nrespect as recognizing the value of the object, for one can recognize\nthe value of something and yet not value it, as an insurance appraiser\ndoes, or take the value of something, say, a person's child, into\naccount in deliberating about how best to revenge oneself on that\nperson. Respect for some categories of objects is not just a matter of\ntaking the object's value into consideration but of valuing the\nobject, and valuing it intrinsically. Analyzing appraisal respect as\njust the positive assessment of someone's character traits as good is\nsimilarly problematic, for one can evaluate something highly and yet\nnot value it. For example, one can appraise someone's moral\nperformance as stellar and hate or envy her for precisely that\nreason. Respect in the appraisal sense is not just evaluating but also\nvaluing the object positively. The recognition/appraisal distinction\nthus seems to obscure another very important distinction between what\nwe might call valuing respect and non-valuing respect. Appraisal\nrespect is a form of valuing respect, but recognition respect includes\nboth valuing and non-valuing forms.  There are, of course, different\nmodes of valuing, and at least three distinctions are relevant to\nrespect: (a) between moral and non-moral valuing (or, valuing from a\nmoral or a nonmoral point of view), (b) between comparative and\nnon-comparative valuing, and (c) between valuing intrinsically\n(valuing it in itself, apart from valuing anything else) and valuing\nextrinsically (for example, because of its relation to something else\nof value) (Anderson 1993). A complete account of respect would need to\nwork out a taxonomy that incorporates these valuing distinctions. \n\nIn the rest of this article, I will discuss respect and self-respect\nusing Darwall's term “recognition respect,” Hudson's term\n“evaluative respect,” and Feinberg's “reverential\nrespect” (the last for the valuing feeling that is motivational\nwithout being deliberative), specifying the valuing dimensions as\nnecessary. \n\nIn everyday discourse, the valuing sense of respect, especially when\nused about people, most commonly means thinking highly of someone,\ni.e., evaluative respect. However, philosophical attention to respect\nhas tended to focus on recognition (or, sometimes, reverential)\nrespect that acknowledges or values the object from a moral point of\nview. These discussions tend to relate such respect to the concepts of\nmoral standing or moral worth. Moral standing, or moral\nconsiderability, is the idea that certain things matter morally in\ntheir own right and so are appropriate objects of direct fundamental\nmoral consideration or concern (Birch 1993, P. Taylor\n1986). Some form of recognition respect is, on some accounts, a\nprimary mode of such moral consideration. Alternatively, it is argued\nthat certain things have a distinctive kind of intrinsic and\nincomparable moral worth or value, often called “dignity,”\nin virtue of which they ought to be accorded some valuing form of\nmoral recognition or reverential respect. Discussions that focus on\nmoral standing or moral worth address questions such as: What things\nfall within the domain of basic moral consideration or have this\ndistinctive moral worth? What confers moral standing on objects, or\nwhat is the basis of their moral worth? Are there different levels of\nmoral standing and, if so, do objects at different levels warrant\ndifferent modes of moral respect? And what sorts of treatment are\nconstitutive of, express, or are compatible with such moral respect?\nIn modern philosophical discussions, humans are universally regarded\nas the paradigm objects of moral respect; if anything has moral\nstanding or dignity and so warrants respect, it is the individual\nhuman being. Although some theorists argue that nature (or, all living\nbeings, species, ecosystems) or societies (or, cultures, traditions)\nalso warrant the moral consideration and valuing of respect, most\nphilosophical discussion of respect has focused on respect for\npersons. \n\nPeople can be the objects or recipients of different forms of\nrespect. We can (directive) respect a person's legal rights, show\n(institutional) respect for the president by calling him\n“Mr. President,” have a healthy (obstacle) respect\n(respekt) for an easily angered person, (care) respect\nsomeone by cherishing her in her concrete particularity,\n(evaluatively) respect an individual for her commitment to a worthy\nproject, and accord one person the same basic moral respect we think\nany person deserves.  Thus the idea of respect for persons is\nambiguous. Because both institutional respect and evaluative respect\ncan be for persons in roles or position, the phrase “respecting\nsomeone as an R” might mean either having high regard for a\nperson's excellent performance in the role or behaving in ways that\nexpress due consideration or deference to an individual qua holder of\nthat position. Similarly, the phrase “respecting someone as a\nperson” might refer to appraising her as overall a morally good\nperson, or to acknowledging her standing as an equal in the moral\ncommunity, or to attending to her as the particular person she is as\nopposed to treating her like just another body. In the literature of\nmoral and political philosophy, the notion of respect for persons\ncommonly means a kind of respect that all people are owed morally just\nbecause they are persons, regardless of social position, individual\ncharacteristics or achievements, or moral merit. The idea is that\npersons as such have a distinctive moral status in virtue of which we\nhave special categorical obligations to regard and treat them in ways\nthat are constrained by certain inviolable limits. This is sometimes\nexpressed in terms of rights: persons, it is said, have a fundamental\nmoral right to respect simply because they are persons. And it is a\ncommonplace that persons are owed or have a right to equal respect. It\nis obvious that we could not owe every individual evaluative respect,\nlet alone equal evaluative respect, since not everyone acts morally\ncorrectly or has an equally morally good character. So, if it is true\nthat all persons are owed or have a moral right to respect just as\npersons, then the concept of respect for person has to be analyzed as\nsome form or combination of forms of recognition or reverential\nrespect. For a variety of reasons, however, it is controversial\nwhether we do indeed have a moral obligation to respect all persons,\nregardless of merit, and if so, why. There are disagreements, for\nexample, about the scope of this claim, the grounds for respect, and\nthe justification for the obligation. There is also a divergence of\nviews about the kinds of treatment that are respectful of persons. \n\nOne source of controversy concerns the scope of the concept\n of a person. Although in everyday discourse the word\n“person” is synonymous with “human being,”\nsome philosophical discussions treat it as a technical term whose\nrange of application might be wider than the class of human beings\n(just as, for legal purposes, business corporations are regarded as\npersons). This is because some of the reasons that have been given for\nrespecting persons have the logical consequence that non-human things\nwarrant the same respect on the very same grounds as\nhumans. Consequently, one question an account of respect for persons\nhas to address is: Who or what are persons that are owed respect?\nDifferent answers have been offered, including all human beings; all\nand only those humans who are themselves capable of respecting\npersons; all beings capable of rational activity, whether human or\nnot; all beings capable of functioning as moral agents, whether human\nor not. The second, third and fourth answers would seem to exclude\ndeceased humans and humans who lack sufficient mental capacity, such\nas the profoundly retarded, the severely mentally ill and senile,\nthose in persistent vegetative states, the pre-born, and perhaps very\nyoung children. The third and fourth answers might include artificial\nbeings (androids, sophisticated robots), spiritual beings (gods,\nangels), extraterrestrial beings, and certain animals (apes,\ndolphins). \n\nIn trying to clarify who or what we are obligated to respect, we are\nnaturally led to a question about the ground or basis of respect: What\nis it about persons that makes them matter morally and makes them\nworthy of respect? One common way of answer this question is to look\nfor some morally significant natural quality that is common to all\nbeings that are noncontroversially owed respect (for example, all\nnormal adult humans). Candidate qualities include the ability to be\nmoved by considerations of moral obligation, the ability to value\nappropriately, the ability to reason, and the ability to engage in\nreciprocal relationships. Some of these apply only to humans, others\nto other beings as well. Even regarding humans, there is a question of\nscope: Are all humans owed respect? If respect is something\nto which all human beings have an equal claim, then, it has been\nargued, the ground quality has to be one that all humans possess\nequally or in virtue of which humans are naturally equal, or a\nthreshold quality that all humans possess, with variations above the\nthreshold ignored. Some philosophers have argued that certain\ncapacities fit the bill; others argue that there is no quality\npossessed by all humans that could be a plausible ground for a moral\nobligation of equal respect. Some draw from this the conclusion that\nrespect is owed not to all but only to some human beings; others\nconclude that the obligation to respect all humans is groundless:\nrather than being grounded in some fact about humans, respect confers\nmoral standing on them. But the last view still leaves the questions:\nwhy should this standing be conferred on humans? And is it conferred\non all humans? Yet another question of scope is: Must persons\nalways be respected? One view is that individuals forfeit\ntheir claim to respect by, for example, committing heinous crimes of\ndisrespect against other persons, such as murder in the course of\nterrorism or genocide. Another view is that there are no circumstances\nunder which it is morally justifiable to not respect a person, and\nthat even torturers and child-rapists, though they may deserve the\nmost severe condemnation and punishment and may have forfeited their\nrights to freedom and perhaps to life, still remain persons to whom we\nhave obligations of respect, since the grounds of respect are\nindependent of moral merit or demerit. \n\nBeyond the question of the ground or basis of respect for persons,\nthere is a further question of justification to be addressed, for it\nis one thing to say that persons have a certain valuable quality, but\nquite another thing to say that there is a moral obligation to respect\npersons. So we must ask: What reasons do we have for believing that\nthe fact that persons possess quality X entails that we are morally\nobligated to respect persons by treating them in certain ways? (Hill\n1997). Another way of asking a justification question seeks not a\nnormative connection between qualities of persons and moral\nobligation, but an explanation for our belief that humans (and perhaps\nother beings) are owed respect, for example: What in our experience of\nother humans or in our evolutionary history explains the development\nand power of this belief?  Our actual felt experiences of reverential\nrespect play a significant role in some of these explanatory accounts;\nwhat justifies accepting our experience of respect for humans (or\nother beings) as grounds for an obligation is its coherence with our\nother moral beliefs (Buss 1999, Margalit 1996, Gibbard 1990). \n\nFinally, there are questions about how we are supposed to respect\npersons, such as: What standards for conduct and character give\nappropriate expression to the attitude of respect? Some philosophers\nargue that the obligation to respect person functions as a negative\nconstraint: respect involves refraining from regarding or treating\npersons in certain ways.  For example, we ought not to treat them as\nif they were worthless or had value only insofar as we find them\nuseful or interesting, or as if they were mere objects or specimens,\nor as if they were vermin or dirt; we ought not to violate their basic\nmoral rights, or interfere with their efforts to make their own\ndecisions and govern their own conduct, or humiliate them, or treat\nthem in ways that flout their nature and worth as persons. Others\nmaintain that we also have positive duties of respect: we ought, for\nexample, to try to see each of them and the world from their own\npoints of view, or help them to promote their morally acceptable ends,\nor protect them from their own self-harming decisions. And some\nphilosophers note that it may be more respectful to judge someone's\nactions or character negatively or to punish someone for wrongdoing\nthan to treat them as if they were not responsible for what they did,\nalthough requirements of respect would impose limits on how such\njudgments may be expressed and how persons may be punished. Another\nquestion is whether treating people with respect requires treating\nthem equally. One view is that the equality of persons entails equal\ntreatment; another view is that equal treatment would involve failing\nto respect the important differences among persons. On the latter\nview, it is respectful to deal with each individual impartially and\nexclusively on the basis of whatever aspects of the individual or the\nsituation are relevant (Frankfurt 1999). \n\nThe most influential position on these issues is found in the moral\nphilosophy of Immanuel Kant (1785, 1788, 1797). Indeed, most\ncontemporary discussions of respect for persons explicitly claim to\nrely on, develop, or challenge some aspect of Kant's ethics. Central\nto Kant's ethical theory is the claim that all persons are owed\nrespect just because they are persons, that is, free rational beings.\nTo be a person is to have a status and worth that is unlike that of\nany other kind of being: it is to be an end in itself with\ndignity. And the only response that is appropriate to such a being is\nrespect.  Respect (that is, moral recognition respect) is the\nacknowledgment in attitude and conduct of the dignity of persons as\nends in themselves.  Respect for such beings is not only appropriate\nbut also morally and unconditionally required: the status and worth of\npersons is such that they must always be respected.  Because we are all\ntoo often inclined not to respect persons, not to value them as they\nought to be valued, one formulation of the Categorical Imperative,\nwhich is the supreme principle of morality, commands that our actions\nexpress due respect for the worth of persons: “Act in such a way\nthat you treat humanity, whether in your own person or the person of\nany other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an\nend” (Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten\n(Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals) (1785/1996, 4:429). Our\nfundamental moral obligation, then, is to respect persons; morally\nright actions are thus those that express respect for persons as ends\nin themselves, while morally wrong actions are those that express\ndisrespect or contempt for persons by not valuing them as ends in\nthemselves (Wood 1999). In addition to this general commandment, Kant\nargues that there are also more specific duties of respect for other\npersons and self-respect, to which we'll return. For now, we must\naddress the question, What is it to be an end in itself and to possess\ndignity? \n\nThe concept of an end has several meanings for Kant.  In one sense, to\nbe an end is to have some kind of value or worth. Most things have\nvalue as the objects of our desires, interests, or affections; they\nare the ends we pursue or produce, our subjective ends. But the worth\nof an end in itself is worth that is not relative to, conditional on,\nor derived from being the object of anyone's desires or\naffections. Rather, its worth is intrinsic to it, unconditional,\nincomparable, and objective. Kant calls this distinctive worth which\nonly ends in themselves possess “dignity.” In Kant's\ntheory of value dignity is the supreme value; thus ends in themselves\nare to be valued morally above all other entities. Kant argues that\nrational beings are the only entities that are ends in themselves and\nthat all rational beings are ends in themselves. The term\n“person” means a being whose rational nature\n“already marks them out as ends in themselves…and an\nobject of respect” (Groundwork 4: 428). In arguing for\nrespect for the dignity of persons, Kant explicitly rejects two other\nconceptions of human value: the aristocratic idea of honor that\nindividuals differentially deserve according to their social rank,\nindividual accomplishments, or moral virtue (see Berger 1983 for a\ndiscussion of the aristocratic dimensions of honor), and the view,\nbaldly expressed by Hobbes, that: In Die Metaphysik der Sitten (The Metaphysics of\nMorals) (1797) Kant grants that if we think of humans as merely\none kind of animal among others “in the system of nature,”\nwe can ascribe a price to them, an extrinsic value that depends on\ntheir usefulness; but, he argues, Against the aristocratic view Kant argues that although individuals\nas members of some social community or other may have or lack\nmeritorious accomplishment or status or may deserve honor (or\nevaluative respect) to different degrees or not at all, all persons as\nmembers of the moral community, the community of all and only ends in\nthemselves, are owed the same (moral recognition) respect, for the\ndignity that they possesses as rational is unconditional and\nindependent of all other facts about or features of them. Dignity is\nalso incomparable worth: it can't be compared with, exchanged for, or\nreplaced by any other value, whereas the very purpose of a price is to\nestablish comparative value. And dignity is absolute or objective\nworth, which means that it is a value that everyone has compelling\nreason to acknowledge, regardless of their antecedent desires,\ninterests, or affections. This brings us to a second sense in which\npersons are ends in themselves. For “end” can also mean a\nlimit or constraint on action (as the end of the road puts a limit on\nour our travel). The rational nature of persons “constitutes the\nsupreme limiting condition of the freedom of action of every human\nbeing” (Groundwork, 4: 431); it puts an absolute limit\non how we can treat them. In particular, they must never be treated\nmerely as means, as things that we may use however we want in order to\nadvance our interests, and they must always be treated as the\nsupremely valuable beings that they are. Note that it is not wrong to\ntreat persons as means to our ends; indeed we could not get along in\nlife if we could not make use of the talents, abilities, service, and\nlabor of other people. What we must not do is to treat persons as mere\nmeans to our ends, to treat them as if the only value they have is\nwhat derives from their usefulness to us.  We must always treat them\n“at the same time as an end.” To respect persons is thus\nto regard them as absolutely, unconditionally, and incomparably\nvaluable, to value them in themselves and not just in comparison to\nothers or insofar as they are valuable to someone or could be useful\nas a means for furthering some purpose, and to acknowledge in a\npractical way that their dignity imposes absolute constraints on our\ntreatment of them. \n\nAs the Categorical Imperative indicates, it is humanity in persons,\nstrictly speaking, that has dignity; that is, it is in virtue of the\nhumanity in them that people are and so ought to be treated as ends in\nthemselves.  Commentators generally identify humanity (that which\nmakes us distinctively human beings and sets us apart from all other\nanimal species) with two closely related aspects of rationality: the\ncapacity to set ends and the capacity to be autonomous, both of which\nare capacities to be a moral agent (for example, Wood 1999, Korsgaard\n1996, Hill 1997). The capacity to set ends, which is the power of\nrational choice, is the capacity to value things through rational\njudgment: to determine, under the influence of reason independently of\nantecedent instincts or desires, that something is valuable or\nimportant, that it is worth seeking or valuing. It is also, thereby,\nthe capacity to value ends in themselves, and so it includes the\ncapacity for respect (Velleman 1999). The capacity to be autonomous is\nthe capacity to be self-legislating and self-governing, that is, (a)\nthe capacity to legislate moral laws that are valid for all rational\nbeings through one's rational willing by recognizing, using reason\nalone, what counts as a moral obligation, and (b) the capacity then to\nfreely resolve to act in accordance with moral laws because they are\nself-imposed by one's own reason and not because one is compelled to\nact by any forces external to one's reason and will, including one's\nown desires and inclinations. The capacity to be autonomous is thus\nalso the capacity to freely direct, shape, and determine the meaning\nof one's own life, and it is the condition for moral\nresponsibility. But why does the possession of these capacities make\npersons ends in themselves? Kant argues that moral principles must be\ncategorical imperatives, which is to say that they must be rational\nrequirements to which we are unconditionally subject, regardless of\nwhatever inclinations, interests, goals, or projects we might\nhave. But there could be categorical imperatives only if there is\nsomething of absolute worth. Only persons have this kind of worth, and\nthey have it because the capacity to set ends, or to confer value on\nthings, is the source of all objective value (as Korsgaard 1996 and\nWood 1999 have argued), and the capacity for autonomy is the source,\non the one hand, both of the obligatoriness of moral law and of\nresponsible moral actions, and on the other, of all realized human\ngoodness. As the sources of all value and of morality itself, then,\nthese rational capacities are the basis of the absolute worth or\ndignity of rational beings. Kant maintains that all rational beings\nnecessarily attribute this value to themselves and that they must, on\nreflection, acknowledge that every other rational being has the same\nvalue and on the same grounds: because of the rational nature that is\ncommon to all persons. It is thus not as members of the biological\nspecies homo sapiens that we have dignity and so are owed\nmoral recognition respect, but as rational beings who are capable of\nmoral agency. \n\nThere are several important consequences of this view regarding the\nscope of recognition respect for persons. First, while all normally\nfunctioning human beings possess the rational capacities that ground\nrecognition respect, there can be humans in whom these capacities are\naltogether absent and who therefore, on this view, are not persons and\nare not owed respect. Second, these capacities may be possessed by\nbeings who are not biologically human, and such beings would also be\npersons with dignity whom we are morally obligated to respect. Third,\nbecause dignity is an absolute worth grounded in the rational\ncapacities for morality, it is in no way conditional on how well or\nbadly those capacities are exercised, on whether a person acts morally\nor has a morally good character or not. Thus, dignity cannot be\ndiminished or lost through vice or morally bad action, nor can it be\nincreased through virtue or morally correct action. Because personhood\nand dignity are not matters of degree, neither is the recognition\nrespect owed to persons. Once a person, always a person (barring, say,\nbrain death), and so individuals cannot forfeit dignity or the right\nto recognition respect no matter what they do.  It follows that even\nthe morally worst individuals must still be regarded as ends in\nthemselves and treated with respect. Of course, wrongdoing may call\nfor punishment and may be grounds for forfeiting certain rights, but\nit is not grounds for losing dignity or for regarding the wrongdoer as\nworthless scum. Recognition respect is not something individuals have\nto earn or might fail to earn, but something they are owed simply\nbecause they are rational beings.  Finally, because dignity is\nabsolute and incomparable, the worth of all rational beings is\nequal. Thus the morally worst persons have the same dignity as the\nmorally best persons, although the former, we might say, fail to live\nup to their dignity. What grounds dignity is something that all\npersons have in common, not something that distinguishes one\nindividual from another. Thus each person is to be respected as an\nequal among equals, without consideration of their individual\nachievements or failures, social rank, moral merit or demerit, or any\nfeature other than their common rational nature. However, the equality\nof all rational beings does not entail that each person must be\ntreated the same as every other persons, nor does it entail that\npersons cannot also be differentially evaluated and valued in other\nways for their particular qualities, accomplishments, merit, or\nusefulness. But such valuing and treatment must always be constrained\nby the moral requirement to accord recognition respect to persons as\nends in themselves. \n\nIn The Metaphysics of Morals, Kant develops the implications\nof this view of persons as ends in themselves. In his doctrine of\njustice he argues that persons, by virtue of their rational nature,\nare bearers of fundamental rights, including the innate right to\nfreedom, which must be respected by other persons and by social\ninstitutions. The dignity of persons also imposes limits on\npermissible reasons for and forms of legal punishment. In his doctrine\nof virtue, Kant discusses specific moral duties of recognition respect\nfor other persons, as well as duties of self-respect, to which we'll\nreturn below. Here, Kant explicitly invokes the notion of respect as\nobservantia. We have no moral duty to feel respect for\nothers, he holds, for we cannot have a moral duty to have any feeling,\nsince feelings are not directly controllable by our will. Rather, the\nrespect we owe others is “to be understood as the maxim of\nlimiting our self-esteem by the dignity of humanity in another person,\nand so as respect in the practical sense” (MM, 6:449).\nThis duty of recognition respect owed to others requires two things:\nfirst, that we adopt as a regulating policy a commitment to control\nour own desire to think well of ourselves (this desire being the main\ncause of disrespect), and, second, that we refrain from treating\nothers in the following ways: treating them merely as means (valuing\nthem as less than ends in themselves), showing contempt for them\n(denying that they have any worth), treating them arrogantly\n(demanding that they value us more highly than they value themselves),\ndefaming them by publicly exposing their faults, and ridiculing or\nmocking them. We also have duties of love to others, and Kant argues\nthat in friendship respect and love, which naturally pull in opposite\ndirections, achieve a perfect balance. \n\nSubsequent work in a Kantian vein on the duty of respect for others\nhas expanded the list of ways that we are morally required by respect\nto treat persons. In particular, although Kant says that the duties of\nrecognition respect are strictly negative, consisting in not engaging\nin certain conduct or having certain attitudes, many philosophers have\nargued that respecting others involves positive actions and attitudes\nas well. The importance of autonomy and agency in Kant's moral\nphilosophy has led many philosophers to highlight respect for\nautonomy.  Thus, we respect others as persons (negatively) by doing\nnothing to impair or destroy their capacity for autonomy, by not\ninterfering with their autonomous decisions and their pursuit of\n(morally acceptable) the ends they value, and by not coercing or\ndeceiving them or treating them paternalistically.  We also respect\nthem (positively) by protecting them from threats to their autonomy\n(which may require intervention when someone's current decisions seem\nto put their own autonomy at risk) and by promoting autonomy and the\nconditions for it (for example, by allowing and encouraging\nindividuals to make their own decisions, take responsibility for their\nactions, and control their own lives).  Some philosophers have\nhighlighted Kant's claim that rationality is the ground for\nrecognition respect, arguing that to respect others is to engage with\nthem not as instruments or obstacles but as persons who are to be\nreasoned with. So, for example, we should employ considerations that\nare accessible to other persons and provide them with genuine reasons\nin our dealings with them rather than trying to manipulate them\nthrough nonrational techniques such as threat or bribery, act toward\nthem only in ways to which they could give rational consent, and be\nwilling to listen to them and take their reasons seriously. The\nimportance of the capacity to set ends and value things has been taken\nby some philosophers to entail that respect also involves\nconsideration for the interests of others; so, we should help them to\npromote and protect what they value and to pursue their ends, provided\nthese are compatible with due respect for other persons, and we should\nmake an effort to appreciate values that are different from our\nown. Kant's emphasis in the doctrine of justice on the fundamental\nrights that persons have has led still others to view the duty of\nrecognition respect for persons as the duty to respect the moral\nrights they have as persons; some have claimed that the duty to\nrespect is nothing more than the duty to refrain from violating these\nrights (Benn 1988, Feinberg 1970). \n\nOne final dimension of Kant's discussions of respect that is worth\nmentioning is his attention to the feeling of respect\n(reverentia). In the Groundwork Kant identifies the\nobject of the feeling of respect as the moral law and says that\nrespect for the moral law is the only moral motive\n(Groundwork 4:400). Reverential respect is unlike any other\nfeeling humans experience in that it is not dependent on empirical\ndesires or any other contingencies of the individual agent's\npsychology, situation, or history, but is “self-produced by\nmeans of a rational concept,” that is, the moral law which, as\nrational beings, we impose on ourselves. The unique moral feeling of\nreverential respect both the experience of the objective worth of the\nmoral law (Wood 1999) and the experience of the supreme and absolute\nauthority that the moral law has over us (Grenberg 1999), the felt\nconsciousness of the immediate “subordination of my will”\nto it (Groundwork 4:401n). In Kritik der practischen\nVernuft (Critique of Practical Reason) (1788), Kant\ndiscusses reverential respect in explaining how the moral law, a\npurely rational principle, is an “incentive” or motivating\nreason for choice and action in a being who is not wholly and solely\nrational but whose will is also affected by inclinations and yet is\nfree (Critique 5:72–76). As a complex experience that\nis both the cognitive recognition of the moral law and an affective\nstate (McCarty 1994), reverential respect is the way, and the only\nway, in which are aware of the self-legislated rational principles for\naction that unconditionally constrain our inclinations (Stratton-Lake\n2000). In recognizing the moral law we are conscious of it in a way\nthat involves two contrasting yet simultaneously experienced\nfeelings. First, in being aware of the law as having absolute\nauthority, we experience the subordination of our will to its\ncommands. This consciousness of subordination involves a painful,\nhumbling feeling insofar as our self-love (our efforts to satisfy our\ndesires and pursue our ends) is constrained and our self-conceit (our\nattempts to esteem ourselves independently of moral considerations) is\nstruck down by the moral law's claim to supreme authority. At the same\ntime, however, our awareness of the moral law involves a pleasurably\nuplifting feeling insofar as we recognize our own reason to be its\nonly source. The moral law thus appears to us not merely as constraint\nbut as freely imposed self-constraint; and reverential respect, this\ncomplex experience of the law as both unconditionally authoritative\nand self-imposed and of both the restriction on our inclinations and\nthe “sublimity” of our “higher vocation” to be\nself-legislating and self-governing (Critique 5:87–88),\nis the way in which we are morally motivated by the law to do\nunconditionally and so freely what it commands.  Reverential respect\nis a unique feeling not only in that it is produced by reason alone\nbut also in that it is the only feeling that we can know a\npriori, which is to say that we can know that the moral\nexperience of every human agent is necessarily and inescapably one of\nreverential respect for the moral law, for we cannot be aware of the\nmoral law except reverentially (Stratton-Lake 2000).  It is, of course\nand unfortunately, also true that many of us, perhaps most of us most\nof the time, ignore this feeling and so act morally\ninappropriately. The feeling of respect is unique also, and relatedly,\nin that the susceptibility to experience it is\n“hard-wired” into human nature. In Die Religion\ninnerhalb der Grenzen der bloßen Vernunft (Religion Within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason) (1793) Kant calls reverential respect\nfor the moral law as it itself sufficient to motivate action the\n“predisposition to personality,” which is that\n“original predisposition” in human nature which makes it\npossible for us to be moral beings (Religion\n6:21–23). \n \nAs the way in which we are motivated to obey the moral law,\nreverential respect for the law is thus the way in which we are\nmotivated to treat persons with recognition respect as the law\ncommands us to do. However, there is another, deeper connection\nbetween respect for the law and respect for persons. For the\ndiscussion in the Critique makes it clear that reverential\nrespect for the moral law is at the same time reverential respect for\noneself, qua rational being, as the author of the law. Self-conceit,\ntrying to esteem ourselves independently of moral considerations, is\nalso the attempt to make our inclinations “lawgiving and the\nunconditional practical principle” (Critique 5:74),\ni.e., to deny that the moral law is purely rational and\nunconditionally and supremely authoritative. Both attempts involve\n“illusion” (5:75), pretending that we do not feel\nreverence for the absolute worth and authority of the moral law and\nfor our reason as its author and as supreme governor of our\ninclinations. In the Metaphysics of Morals Kant says that\nfeeling of reverential self-respect, which the law “unavoidably\nforces from” us (MM 6:403), is part of the subjective\nbasis of morality, the predispositions to feeling that make possible\nfor beings like us to acknowledge that we have binding moral duties\n(MM 6:399–418), including the duty to treat ourselves\nas well as others always as ends in ourselves. There is, finally, one\nfurther interesting relation between respect for the law and respect\nfor persons. Although Kant says that the moral law is the sole object\nof respect (Groundwork 4:400, 401n), he also says that we\nexperience this same humbling and uplifting feeling of respect for\nmorally good people (Critique 5:77ff). This feeling is both\nreverential respect for the moral law which such individuals exemplify\n(Groundwork 4:401n) and a mode of evaluative respect, a\n“tribute” to their moral “merit”\n(Critique 5:77).  Kant holds that reverence for morally good\npeople, like reverential respect for the moral law, is something we\nnecessarily and unavoidably feel, although we might pretend we don't\nor refuse to acknowledge or show it. Reverential respect for morally\ngood persons contrasts with the duty to give recognition respect to\nall persons in our attitudes and conduct, for the former is something\nwe can't help feeling for some people, while the latter is a way we\nare obligated to comport ourselves toward all persons regardless of\nour feelings and their moral performance. We might, however, regard\nthe two as linked, by regarding our recognition and appreciation of\nthe dignity of others as involving a feeling that we can't help but\nexperience and to which we commit ourselves to living up to in\nacknowledging the moral duty to respect persons just because they are\npersons (Hill 1998).  Philosophical discussions of respect since Kant have tended, on\nthe one hand, to develop or apply various aspects of it, or on the\nother, to take issue with it or develop alternative accounts of\nrespect. Some of the discussions have focused on more theoretical\nissues. For example, Kant gives the notion of respect for persons a\ncentral and vital role in moral theory. One issue that has since\nconcerned philosophers is whether respect for persons is the\ndefinitive focus of morality, either in the sense that moral rightness\nand goodness and hence all specific moral duties, rights, and virtues\nare explainable in terms of respect or in the sense that the supreme\nmoral principle from which all other principles are derived is a\nprinciple of respect for persons. Some philosophers have developed\nethical theories in which a principle of respect for persons is\nidentified as the fundamental and comprehensive moral requirement (for\nexample, Donagan 1977, Downie and Telfer 1969). Others (for example,\nHill 1993, Frankena 1986, Cranor 1975) argue that while respect for\npersons is surely a very important moral consideration, it cannot be\nthe principle from which the rest of morality is deduced. They\nmaintain that there are moral contexts in which respect for persons is\nnot an issue and that there are other dimensions of our moral\nrelations with others that seem not to reduce to respect.  Moreover,\nthey argue, such a principle would seem not to provide moral grounds\nfor believing that we ought to treat mentally incapacitated humans or\nnonhuman animals decently, or would (as Kant argues) make a duty to\nrespect such beings only an indirect duty—one we have only\nbecause it is a way of respecting persons who value such beings or\nbecause our duty to respect ourselves requires that we not engage in\nactivities that would dull our ability to treat persons\ndecently—rather than a direct duty to such beings (Kant 1797,\n6:443). \n\nSome theorists maintain that utilitarianism, a moral theory generally\nthought to be a rival to Kant's theory, is superior with regard to\nthis last point.  A utilitarian might argue that it is sentience\nrather than the capacity for rational autonomy that is the ground of\nmoral recognition respect, and so would regard mentally incapacitated\nhumans and nonhuman animals as having moral standing and so as worthy\nof at least some moral respect in themselves.  Another issue, then, is\nwhether utilitarianism (or more generally, consequentialism) can\nindeed accommodate a principle of respect for persons. In opposition\nto the utilitarian claim, some Kantians argue that Kant's ethics is\ndistinguishable from consequentialist ethics precisely in maintaining\nthat the fundamental demand of morality is not that we promote some\nvalue, such as the happiness of sentient beings, but that we respect\nthe worth of humanity regardless of the consequences of doing so\n(Korsegaard 1996, Wood 1999). Thus, some philosophers argue that\nutilitarianism is inconsistent with respect for persons, inasmuch as\nutilitarianism, in requiring that all actions, principles, or motives\npromote the greatest good, requires treating persons as mere means on\nthose occasions when doing so maximizes utility, whereas the very\npoint of a principle of respect for persons is to rule out such\ntrading of persons and their dignity for some other value (Benn 1988,\nBrody 1982). In opposition, other theorists maintain not only that a\nconsequentialist theory can accommodate the idea of respect for person\n(Downie and Telfer 1969, Gruzalski 1982, Landesman 1982, Pettit 1989,\nCummiskey 1990), but also that utilitarianism is derivable from a\nprinciple of respect for persons (Downie and Telfer 1969) and that\nconsequentialist theories provide a better grounding for duties to\nrespect persons (Pettit 1989). \n\nIn addition to the debate between Kantian theory and utilitarianism,\ntheoretical work has also been done in developing the role of respect\nfor persons in Habermasian communicative ethics (Young 1997, Benhabib\n1991) and in Aristotelian ethics (Thompson 2017, Rabbås 2015,\nJacobs 1995), in exploring similarities and differences between\nwestern (Kantian) views of respect for persons and Indian\n(Ghosh-Dastidar 1987), Confucian (Lu 2017, Chan 2006, Wawrytko 1982),\nand Taoist views (Wong 1984), and in developing a distinctively\nfeminist account of respect for persons (Farley 1993, Dillon\n1992a). \n\nOther philosophical discussions have been concerned with clarifying\nthe nature of the respect that is owed to persons and of the persons\nthat are owed respect. Some of these discussions aim to refine and\ndevelop Kant's account, while others criticize it and offer\nalternatives. Darwall (2004, 2006) draws on Kant in revising his own\nunderstanding of the nature of recognition respect for persons,\ncalling attention to an under-discussed dimension of the dignity of\npersons on Kant's account. Dignity is not only a worth but a status or\nstanding, a position in the moral community. The standing is that of\nan equal, for rational beings have the same dignity. But it is also a\nstanding or position from which claims or demands can be made. Dignity\nis, as Kant says in a passage from the Metaphysics of Morals\nquoted above, that “by which” rational beings\n“exact” or demand respect from one another (MM,\n6: 435). As Darwall puts it, dignity is “the second-personal\nstanding of an equal: the authority to make claims and demands on one\nanother as free and rational agents” and to hold each other\naccountable for complying with these commands (Darwall 2004, 43,\n44). Persons are just those beings who have the standing of authority\nto address demands to one another as persons. Moral recognition\nrespect for the dignity of persons is acknowledging this authority; we\nrespect one another as persons when we hold each other mutually\naccountable for complying with the demands that we acknowledge each\nperson has the authority to make of each other person as free and\nrational agents. The reciprocal relations among persons as\nauthoritative claims-makers and mutually accountable claims-responders\nis, in Darwall's view, one way of understanding the constitution of\nrational beings into the community of equal persons that Kant calls in\nthe Groundwork a “kingdom of ends.”  Another area of interest has been the connections between respect\nand other attitudes and emotions, especially love and between respect\nand virtues such as trust. For example, Kant (1797) argues that we\nhave duties of love to others just as we have duties of respect.\nHowever, neither the love nor the respect we owe is a matter of\nfeeling (or, is pathological, as Kant says), but is, rather, a duty to\nadopt a certain kind of maxim, or policy of action: the duty of love\nis the duty to make the ends of others my own, the duty of respect is\nthe duty to not degrade others to the status of mere means to my ends\n(Kant 1779, 6: 449–450). Love and respect, in Kant's view, are\nintimately united in friendship; nevertheless, they seem to be in\ntension with one another and respect seems to be the morally more\nimportant of the two, in that the duties of respect are stricter and\nrespect constrains and limits love within friendship. Critics object\nto what they see here as Kant's devaluing of emotions, maintaining\nthat emotions are morally significant dimensions of persons both as\nsubjects and as objects of both respect and love. In response, some\nphilosophers contend that respect and love are more similar and\nclosely connected in Kant's theory than is generally recognized\n(Velleman 1999, Baron 1997, R. Johnson 1997). Others have developed\naccounts of respect that is or incorporates a form of love (agape) or\ncare (Dillon 1992a, Downie and Telfer 1969, Maclagan 1960) and some\nhave argued that emotions are included among the bases of dignity and\nthat a complex emotional repertoire is necessary for Kantian respect\n(Wood 1999, Sherman 1998a, Farley 1993). In a related vein, some\nphilosophers maintain that it is possible to acknowledge that another\nbeing is a person, i.e., a rational moral agent, and yet not have or\ngive respect to that being. What is required for respecting a person\nis not simply recognizing what they are but emotionally experiencing\ntheir value as a person (Thomas 2001a, Buss 1999, Dillon 1997). \n\nAnother source of dissatisfaction with Kant's account has been with\nhis characterization of persons and the quality in virtue of which\nthey must be respected. In particular, Kant's view that the rational\nwill which is common to all persons is the ground of respect is\nthought to ignore the moral importance of the concrete particularity\nof each individual, and his emphasis on autonomy, which is often\nunderstood to involve the independence of one person from all others,\nis thought to ignore the essential relationality of human beings(for\nexample, Noggle 1999, Farley 1993, Dillon 1992a, E. Johnson\n1982). Rather than ignoring what distinguishes one person from\nanother, it is argued, respect should involve attending to each person\nas a distinctive individual and to the concrete realities of human\nlives, and it should involve valuing difference as well as sameness\nand interdependence as well as independence. Other critics respond\nthat respecting differences and particular identities inevitably\nreintroduces hierarchical discrimination that is antithetical to the\nequality among persons that the idea of respect for persons is\nsupposed to express (for example, Bird 2004). Identity and difference\nmay, however, be appropriate objects of other forms of consideration\nand appreciation. \n\nThe idea of respect for particularity and relationality has also\nbecome an important topic recently in political philosophy. One issue\nis how persons ought to be respected in multicultural liberal\ndemocratic societies (for example, Balint 2006, Tomasi 1995, C. Taylor 1992,\nKymlicka 1989).  Respect for persons is one of the basic tenets of\nliberal democratic societies, which are founded on the ideal of the\nequal dignity of all citizens and which realize this ideal in the\nequalization of rights and entitlements among all citizens and so the\nrejection of discrimination and differential treatment.  Some writers\nargue that respecting persons requires respecting the traditions and\ncultures that permeate and shape their individual identities (Addis\n1997). But as the citizenry of such societies becomes increasingly\nmore diverse and as many groups come to regard their identities or\nvery existence as threatened by a homogenizing equality, liberal\nsocieties face the question of whether they should or could respond to\ndemands to respect the unique identity of individuals or groups by\ndifferential treatment, such as extending political rights or\nopportunities to some cultural groups (for example, Native Americans,\nFrench Canadians, African-Americans) and not others.  The idea that all persons are owed respect has been applied in a\nwide variety of contexts. For instance, some philosophers employ it to\njustify various positions in normative ethics, such as the claim that\npersons have moral rights (Benn 1971, Feinberg 1970, Downie and Telfer\n1969) or duties (Fried 1978, Rawls 1971), or to argue for principles\nof equality (Williams 1962), justice (Narveson 2002a and 2002b,\nNussbaum 1999), and education (Andrews 1976). Others appeal to respect\nfor persons in addressing a wide variety of practical issues such as\nabortion, racism and sexism, rape, punishment, physician-assisted\nsuicide, pornography, affirmative action, forgiveness, terrorism,\nsexual harassment, cooperation with injustice, treatment of gays and\nlesbians, sexual ethics, and many others.  In political philosophy,\nrespect persons has been been used to examine issues of global\ninequality (e.g., Moellendorf 2010). One very important application\ncontext is biomedical ethics, where the principle of respect for\nautonomy is one of four basic principles that have become “the\nbackbone of contemporary Western health care ethics” (Brannigan\nand Boss 2001, 39; see also Beauchamp and Childress 1979/2001 and, for\nexample, Munson 2000, Beauchamp and Walters 1999). The idea of respect\nfor patient autonomy has transformed health care practice, which had\ntraditionally worked on physician-based paternalism, and the principle\nenters into issues such as informed consent, truthtelling,\nconfidentiality, respecting refusals of life-saving treatment, the use\nof patients as subjects in medical experimentation, and so on. \n\nAlthough persons are the paradigm objects of moral recognition\nrespect, it is a matter of some debate whether they are the only\nthings that we ought morally to respect. One serious objection raised\nagainst Kant's ethical theory is that in claiming that only rational\nbeings are ends in themselves deserving of respect, it licenses\ntreating all things which aren't persons as mere means to the ends of\nrational beings, and so it supports morally abhorrent attitudes of\ndomination and exploitation toward all nonpersons and toward our\nnatural environment. Taking issue with the Kantian position that only\npersons are respectworthy, many philosophers have argued that such\nnonpersons as humans who are not agents or not yet agents, human\nembryos, nonhuman animals, sentient creatures, plants, species, all\nliving things, biotic communities, the natural ecosystem of our\nplanet, and even mountains, rocks, and the AIDS virus have moral\nstanding or worth and so are appropriate objects of or are owed moral\nrecognition respect. Of course, it is possible to value such things\ninstrumentally insofar as they serve human interests, but the idea is\nthat such things matter morally and have a claim to respect in their\nown right, independently of their usefulness to humans. A variety of different strategies have been employed in arguing for\nsuch respect claims. For example, the concept of moral respect is\nsometimes stripped down to its bare essentials, omitting much of the\ncontent of the concept as it appears in respect for persons\ncontexts. The respect that is owed to all things, it can be argued, is\na very basic form of attentive contemplation of the object combined\nwith a prima facie assumption that the object might have\nintrinsic value. This does not involve the valuing commitments that\nrespect for persons does, since respectful consideration might reveal\nthat the object does not have any positive value. What we owe\neverything is an opportunity to reveal any value it might have, rather\nthan assuming that only persons have the kind of value that morally\nwarrants attention (Birch 1993). Another strategy is to argue that the true grounds for moral worth\nand respect are other than or wider than rationality. One version of\nthis strategy (employed by P. Taylor 1986) is to argue that all living\nthings, persons and nonpersons, have equal inherent worth and so\nequally deserve the same kind of moral respect, because the ground of\nthe worth of living things that are nonpersons is continuous with the\nground of the worth for persons. For example, we regard persons as\nrespect-worthy inasmuch as they are agents, centers of autonomous\nchoice and valuation, and we can similarly regard all living things as\nrespect-worthy in virtue of being quasi-agents, centers of organized\nactivity that pursue their own good in their own unique way. It\nfollows from this view that humans must not be regarded as having a\nmoral status superior to other living beings and so human interests\nmay not be regarded as always trumping claims of nonhumans. Respect\nfor all living things would require settling conflicts between persons\nand nonpersons in ways that are fair to both. A third strategy, which is employed within Kantian ethics, is to\nargue that respect for persons logically entails respect for\nnonpersons. For example, one can argue that rational nature is to be\nrespected not only by respecting humanity in someone's person but also\nby respecting things that bear certain relations to rational nature,\nfor example, by being fragments of it or necessary conditions of\nit. Respect would thus be owed to humans who are not persons and to\nanimals and other sentient beings (Foreman 2017, Rocha 2015, Wood 1998). Alternatively, one can\nargue that respect for persons requires respecting their values, and\nsince many people value nature or other categories of nonpersons\nintrinsically and not just instrumentally, respect for persons\nrequires (under certain conditions) also respecting what they respect\n(Gaus 1998). Yet another strategy is to reject the Kantian notion that\nthere is but one kind or level of moral status or worth that warrants\nbut one kind or level of respect. Instead, one might argue, we can\nacknowledge that rational moral agents have the highest moral standing\nand worth and are owed maximal respect, and also maintain that other\nbeings have lesser but still morally significant standing or worth and\nso deserve less but still some respect. So, although it is always\nwrong to use moral agents merely as means, it may be justifiable to\nuse nonpersons as means (for example, to do research on human embryos\nor human cadavers, destroying them in the process, or to kill animals\nfor food) provided their moral worth is also respectfully acknowledged\n(for example, by not using them for trivial purposes, by destroying\nthem only in certain ways, or by having an attitude of regret or loss\nbecause something of genuine moral value is sacrificed) (Meyer and\nNelson, 2001). Much philosophical work has been done, particularly in\nenvironmental ethics, to determine the practical implications of the\nclaim that things other than persons are owed respect (e.g., Corral 2015, Foreman 2015, Schmidtz\n2011, Bognar 2011, Connolly 2006, Wiggins 2000, Westra\n1989). Certainly a wide variety of human practices, ranging from\nagriculture and urban development to recreation and energy use to\ntechnological and biomedical research, might have to be profoundly\naltered by a recognition of moral duties of respect to nonpersons. \n\nWhile there is much controversy about respect for persons and other\nthings, there is surprising agreement among moral and political\nphilosophers about at least this much concerning respect for oneself:\nself-respect is something of great importance in everyday life.\nIndeed, it is regarded both as morally required and as essential to\nthe ability to live a satisfying, meaningful, flourishing life—a\nlife worth living—and just as vital to the quality of our lives\ntogether. Saying that a person has no self-respect or acts in a way no\nself-respecting person would act, or that a social institution\nundermines the self-respect of some people, is generally a strong\nmoral criticism. Nevertheless, as with respect itself, there is\nphilosophical disagreement, both real and merely apparent, about the\nnature, scope, grounds, and requirements of self-respect.\nSelf-respect is often defined as a sense of worth or as due respect\nfor oneself; it is frequently (but not always correctly) identified\nwith or compared to self-esteem, self-confidence, dignity, self-love,\na sense of honor, self-reliance, pride, and it is contrasted (but not\nalways correctly) with servility, shame, humility, self-abnegation,\narrogance, self-importance. In addition to the questions philosophers\nhave addressed about respect in general, a number of other questions\nhave been of particular concern to those interested in self-respect,\nsuch as: (1) What is self-respect, and how is it different from\nrelated notions such as self-esteem, self-confidence, pride, and so\non?  (2) Are there objective conditions—for example, moral\nstandards or correct judgments—that a person must meet in order\nto have self-respect, or is self-respect a subjective phenomenon that\ngains support from any sort of self-valuing without regard to\ncorrectness or moral acceptability? (3) Does respecting oneself\nconceptually or causally require or lead to respecting other persons\n(or anything else)? And how are respect for other persons and respect\nfor oneself alike and unalike? (4) How is self-respect related to such\nthings as moral rights, virtue, autonomy, integrity, and identity? (5)\nIs there a moral duty to respect ourselves as there is a duty to\nrespect others?  (6) What features of an individual's psychology and\nexperience, what aspects of the social context, and what modes of\ninteractions with others support or undermine self-respect? (7) Are\nsocial institutions and practices to be judged just or unjust (at\nleast in part) by how they affect self-respect? Can considerations of\nself-respect help us to better understand the nature and wrongness of\ninjustices such as oppression and to determine effective and morally\nappropriate ways to resist or end them? \n\nMost generally, self-respect is a moral relation of persons (and only\npersons) to themselves that concerns their own intrinsic worth.\nSelf-respect is thus essentially a valuing form of respect.  Like\nrespect for others, self-respect is a complex of multilayered and\ninterpenetrating phenomena; it involves all those aspects of\ncognition, valuation, affect, expectation, motivation, action, and\nreaction that compose a mode of being in the world at the heart of\nwhich is an appreciation of oneself as having morally significant\nworth. Unlike some forms of respect, self-respect is not something one\nhas only now and again or that might have no effect on its\nobject. Rather, self-respect has to do with the structure and\nattunement of an individual's identity and of her life, and it\nreverberates throughout the self, affecting the configuration and\nconstitution of the person's thoughts, desires, values, emotions,\ncommitments, dispositions, and actions. As expressing or constituting\none's sense of worth, it includes an engaged understanding of one's\nworth, as well as a desire and disposition to protect and preserve\nit. Accounts of self-respect differ in their characterizations of the\nbeliefs, desires, affects, and behaviors that are constitutive of it,\nchiefly because of differences concerning the aspects or conception of\nthe self insofar as it is the object of one's respect and the nature\nand grounds of the worth of the self or aspects of the self.  Most theorists agree that as there are different kinds of respect,\nso there are different kinds of self-respect.  However, we clearly\ncannot apply all kinds of respect to ourselves: it makes no sense to\ntalk of directive respect for oneself, for instance, and although one\nmight regard oneself or some of one's characteristics as obstacles\n(“I'm my own worst enemy”), this would not generally be\nconsidered a form of self-respect. Because the notion of self-worth is\nthe organizing motif for self-respect, and because in the dominant\nWestern tradition two kinds of worth are ascribed to persons, two\nkinds of self-respect can be distinguished. The first, recognition self-respect, centers on what we can call\nstatus worth, which is worth that derives from such things as one's\nessential nature as a person, membership in a certain class, group, or\npeople, social role, or place in a social hierarchy. Kantian dignity\nis one form, but not the only form, of status worth. Evaluative\nself-respect, in contrast, has to do with acquired worth, merit, based\non the quality of one's character and conduct. We earn or lose moral\nmerit, and so deserve or don't deserve evaluative self-respect,\nthrough what we do or become. Different sources of status worth yield\ndifferent configurations of recognition self-respect, but most\ncontemporary discussions, heavily influenced by Kant, focus on\ndignity-based recognition self-respect.  Recognition respect for\noneself as a person, then, involves living in light of an\nunderstanding and appreciation of oneself as having dignity and moral\nstatus just in virtue of being a person, and of the moral constraints\nthat arise from that dignity and status. All persons are morally\nobligated or entitled to have this kind of self-respect.  Because the\ndominant Kantian conception of persons grounds dignity in three\nthings—equality, agency, and individuality—we can further\ndistinguish three kinds of recognition self-respect.  The first is\nrespect for oneself as a person among persons, as a member of the\nmoral community with a status and dignity equal to every other person\n(see, for example, Thomas 1983a, Boxill 1976, Hill 1973). This\ninvolves having some conception of the kinds of treatment from others\nthat would count as one's due as a person and treatment that would be\ndegrading or beneath one's dignity, desiring to be regarded and\ntreated appropriately, and resenting and being disposed to protest\ndisregard and disrespectful treatment.  Thinking of oneself as having\ncertain moral rights that others ought not to violate is part of this\nkind of self-respect; servility (regarding oneself as the inferior of\nothers) and arrogance (thinking oneself superior to others) are among\nits opposites. The second kind of recognition self-respect involves an\nappreciation of oneself as an agent, a being with the ability and\nresponsibility to act autonomously and value appropriately (see, for\nexample, G. Taylor 1985, Telfer 1968). Persons who respect themselves\nas agents take their responsibilities seriously, especially their\nresponsibilities to live in accord with their dignity as persons, to\ngovern themselves fittingly, and to make of themselves and their lives\nsomething they believe to be good. So, self-respecting persons regard\ncertain forms of acting, thinking, desiring, and feeling as befitting\nthem as persons and other forms as self-debasing or shameful, and they\nexpect themselves to adhere to the former and avoid the latter. They\ntake care of themselves and seek to develop and use their talents and\nabilities in pursuit of their plans, projects, and goals. Those who\nare shameless, uncontrolled, weak-willed, self-consciously\nsycophantic, chronically irresponsible, slothfully dependent,\nself-destructive, or unconcerned with the shape and direction of their\nlives may be said to not respect themselves as agents. \nA third kind of recognition self-respect involves the appreciation of\nthe importance of being autonomously self-defining. One way a\nself-respecting individual does this is through having, and living in\nlight, of a normative self-conception, i.e., a conception of being and\nliving that she regards as worthy of her as the particular person she\nis. Such a self-conception both gives expression to ideals and\ncommitments that shape the individual’s identity, and also\norganizes desires, choices, pursuits, and projects in ways that give\nsubstance and worth to the self.  Self-respecting people hold\nthemselves to personal expectations and standards the disappointment\nof which they would regard as unworthy of them, shameful, even\ncontemptible (although they may not apply these standards to others)\n(Hill 1982). People who sell out, betray their own values, live\ninauthentic lives, let themselves be defined by others, or are\ncomplacently self-accepting lack this kind of recognition\nself-respect. \nTo these three Kantian kinds of recognition\nself-respect we can add a fourth, which has to do with the fact that\nit is not just as abstract human beings or as agents with personal and\nuniversalizable moral goals and obligations that individuals can, do,\nor should respect themselves but also as concrete persons embedded in\nparticular social structures and occupying various social positions\nwith status-related responsibilities they must meet to be\nself-respecting (Middleton 2006). This last kind also has political\nimplications, as discussed below. \n\nEvaluative self-respect, which expresses confidence in one's merit as\na person, rests on an appraisal of oneself in light of the normative\nself-conception that structures recognition self-respect. Recognition\nself-respecting persons are concerned to be the kind of person they\nthink it is good and appropriate for them to be and they try to live\nthe kind of life such a person should live. Thus they have and try to\nlive by certain standards of worthiness by which they are committed to\njudge themselves. Indeed, they stake themselves, their value and their\nidentities, on living in accord with these standards. Because they\nwant to know where they stand, morally, they are disposed to\nreflectively examine and evaluate their character and conduct in light\nof their normative vision of themselves. And it matters to them that\nthey are able to “bear their own survey,” as Hume says\n(1739 (1971), 620). Evaluative self-respect contains the judgment that\none is or is becoming the worthy kind of person one seeks to be, and,\nmore significantly, that one is not in danger of becoming an unworthy\nkind of person (Dillon 2004). Evaluative self-respect holds, at the least, the\njudgment that one “comes up to scratch,” as Telfer (1968)\nputs it. Those whose conduct is unworthy or whose character is\nshameful by their own standards do not deserve their own evaluative\nrespect. However, people can be poor self-appraisers and their\nstandards can be quite inappropriate to them or to any person, and so\ntheir evaluative self-respect, though still subjectively satisfying,\ncan be unwarranted, as can the loss or lack of it. Interestingly,\nalthough philosophers have paid scant attention to evaluative respect\nfor others, significant work has been done on evaluative\nself-respect. This may reflect an asymmetry between the two: although\nour evaluative respect for others may have no effect on them, perhaps\nbecause we don't express it or they don't value our appraisal, our own\nself-evaluation matters intensely to us and can powerfully affect our\nself-identity and the shape and structure of our lives. Indeed, an\nindividual's inability to stomach herself can profoundly diminish the\nquality of her life, even her desire to continue living. \n\nSome philosophers have contended that a third kind of self-valuing\nunderlies both recognition and evaluative self-respect. It is a more\nbasic sense of worth that enables an individual to develop the\nintellectually more sophisticated forms, a precondition for being able\nto take one's qualities or the fact that one is a person as grounds of\npositive self-worth. It has been called “basic psychological\nsecurity” (Thomas 1989), “self-love” (Buss 1999),\nand “basal self-respect” (Dillon 1997). Basal self-valuing\nis our most fundamental sense of ourselves as mattering and our\nprimordial interpretation of self and self-worth. Strong and secure\nbasal self-respect can immunize an individual against personal failing\nor social denigration, but damage to basal self-respect, which can\noccur when people grow up in social, political, or cultural\nenvironments that devalue them or “their kind,” can make\nit impossible for people to properly interpret themselves and their\nself-worth, because it affects the way in which they assess reality\nand weigh reasons.  Basal self-respect is thus the ground of the\npossibility of recognition and evaluative self-respect.  It is common in everyday discourse and philosophical discussion to\ntreat self-respect and self-esteem as synonyms. It is true that\nevaluative self-respect and self-esteem both involve appraising\noneself favorably in virtue of one's behavior and personal traits, and\nthat a person can have or lack either one undeservedly. However, many\nphilosophers have argued that the two attitudes are importantly\ndifferent (for example, Darwall 1977, Sachs 1981, Chazan 1998, Harris,\n2001, Dillon 2004, 2013). One way of distinguishing them is by their\ngrounds and the points of view from which they are\nappraised. Evaluative self-respect involves an assessment from a moral\npoint of view of one's character and conduct, while self-esteem can be\nbased on personal features that are unrelated to character, and the\nassessment it involves need not be from a moral point of view: one can\nhave a good opinion of oneself in virtue of being a good joke-teller\nor having won an important sports competition and yet not think one is\na good person because of it (Darwall 1977). Another way of\ndistinguishing them focuses on what it is to lose them: one would lose\nevaluative respect for oneself if one judged oneself to be shameful,\ncontemptible, or intolerable, but self-esteem can be diminished by the\nbelief that one lacks highly prized qualities that would add to one's\nmerit (Harris 2001). Self-respect is also often identified with\npride. In one sense, pride is the pleasure or satisfaction taken in\none's achievements, possessions, or associations, and in this sense\npride can be an affective element of either evaluative self-respect or\nself-esteem. In another sense, pride is inordinate self-esteem or\nvanity, an excessively high opinion of one's qualities,\naccomplishments, or status that can make one arrogant and contemptuous\nof others.  In this sense, pride contrasts with both well-grounded\nevaluative self-respect and the interpersonal kind of recognition\nself-respect. But pride can also be a claim to and celebration of a\nstatus worth or to equality with others, especially other groups (for\nexample, Black Pride), which is interpersonal recognition\nself-respect; and pride can be “proper pride,” a sense of\none's dignity that prevents one from doing what is unworthy, and in\nthis sense it is the agentic dimension of recognition\nself-respect. Pride's opposites, shame and humility, are also closely\nrelated to self-respect. A loss of evaluative self-respect may be\nexpressed in shame, but shameless people manifest a lack of\nrecognition self-respect; and although humiliation can diminish or\nundermine recognition self-respect, humility is an appropriate\ndimension of the evaluative respect of any imperfect person. \n\nOne issue with which contemporary philosophers have been concerned is\nwhether self-respect is an objective concept or a subjective one. If\nit is the former, then there are certain beliefs, attitudes, and\ndispositions a person must have to be self-respecting. A person who\nthought of herself as a lesser sort of being whose interests and\nwell-being are less important than those of others would not count as\nhaving recognition self-respect, no matter how appropriate she regards\nher stance. If self-respect is a subjective concept, then a person\ncounts as having self-respect so long as she believes she is not\ntolerating treatment she regards as unworthy or behaving in ways she\nthinks is beneath her, regardless of whether her judgments about\nherself are accurate or her standards or sense of what she is due are\njudged by others to be reasonable or worthy (Massey\n1983a). Psychologists, for whom “self-esteem” is the term\nof practice, tend to regard the various dimensions of a person's sense\nof worth as subjective. Many philosophers treat the interpersonal\ndimension of recognition self-respect objectively, and it is generally\nthought that having manifestly inaccurate beliefs about oneself is\ngood grounds for at least calling an individual's sense of worth\nunjustified or compromised (Meyers 1989). But there is no consensus\nregarding the standards to which individuals hold themselves and by\nwhich they judge themselves, and certainly the standards of the\nself-defining dimension of recognition self-respect are inescapably,\nthough perhaps not exclusively, subjective. Complicating the\nobjective/subjective distinction, however, is the fact of the social\nconstruction of self-respect. What it is to be a person or to have a\nstatus worthy of respect, what treatment and conduct are appropriate\nto a person or one with such a status, what forms of life and\ncharacter have merit—all of these are given different content\nin different sociocultural contexts. Individuals necessarily, though\nperhaps not inalterably, learn to engage with themselves and with\nissues of self-worth in the terms and modes of the sociocultural\nconceptions in which they have been immersed. And different kinds of\nindividuals may be given different opportunities in different\nsociocultural contexts to acquire or develop the grounds of the\ndifferent kinds of self-respect (Dillon 1997, Moody-Adams 1992–93,\nMeyers 1989, Thomas 1983b).  Even fully justified self-respect may\nthus be less than strongly objective and more than simply\nsubjective. \n\nSelf-respect is frequently appealed to as a means of justifying a wide\nvariety of philosophical claims or positions, generally in arguments\nof the form: x promotes (or undermines) self-respect;\ntherefore, x is to that extent to be morally approved (or\nobjected to). For example, appeals to self-respect have been used to\nargue for, among many other things, the value of moral rights\n(Feinberg 1970), moral requirements or limits regarding forgiving\nothers or oneself (Dillon 2001; Holmgren 1998, 1993; Novitz 1998;\nHaber 1991; Murphy 1982), and both the rightness and wrongness of\npractices such as affirmative action. Such arguments rely on rather\nthan establish the moral importance of self-respect. Most philosophers\nwho attend to self-respect tend to treat it as important in one of two\nways, which are exemplified in the very influential work of Kant and\nJohn Rawls. Kant argues that, just as we have a moral duty to respect\nothers as persons, so we have a moral duty to respect ourselves as\npersons, a duty that derives from our dignity as rational beings. This\nduty requires us to act always in an awareness of our dignity and so\nto act only in ways that are consistent with our status as end in\nourselves and to refrain from acting in ways that abase, degrade,\ndefile, or disavow our rational nature. That is, we have a duty of\nrecognition self-respect. In The Metaphysics of Morals\n(1797), Kant argues for specific duties to oneself generated by the\ngeneral duty to respect humanity in our persons, including duties to\nnot engage in suicide, misuse of our sexual powers, drunkenness and\nother unrestrained indulgence of inclination, lying, self-deception,\navarice, and servility. Kant also maintains that the duty of\nself-respect is the most important moral duty, for unless there were\nduties to respect oneself, there could be no moral duties at\nall. Moreover, fulfilling our duty to respect ourselves is a necessary\ncondition of fulfilling our duties to respect other persons.  Kant\nmaintains that we are always aware of our dignity as persons and so of\nour moral obligation to respect ourselves, and he identifies this\nawareness as a feeling of reverential respect for ourselves. This is\none of the natural capacities of feeling which we could have no duty\nto acquire but that make it possible for us to be motivated by the\nthought of duty. Reverence for self is, along with “moral\nfeeling,” conscience, and love of others, a subjective source of\nmorality, and it is the motivational ground of the duty of\nself-respect. Kant also discusses evaluative self-respect, especially\nin Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and his Lectures\non Ethics (1779), as a combination of noble pride, the awareness\nthat we have honored and preserved our dignity by acting in morally\nworthy ways, and a healthy dose of humility, the awareness that we\ninevitably fall short of the lofty requirements of the moral law. Kant\nregards well-grounded evaluative self-respect as a subjective\nmotivation to continue striving to do right and be good. \n\nRawls, by contrast, views self-respect neither as something we are\nmorally required to have and maintain nor as a feeling we necessarily\nhave, but as an entitlement that social institutions are required by\njustice to support and not undermine. In A Theory of Justice\n(1971) he argues that self-respect is a “primary good,”\nsomething that rational beings want whatever else they want, because\nit is vital to the experienced quality of individual lives and to the\nability to carry out or achieve whatever projects or aims an\nindividual might have. It is, moreover, a social good, one that\nindividuals are able to acquire only under certain social and\npolitical conditions. Rawls defines self-respect as including “a\nperson's sense of his own value, his secure conviction that his\nconception of the good, his plan of life, is worth carrying\nout,” and it implies “a confidence in one's ability, so\nfar as it is within one's power, to fulfill one's intentions”\n(Rawls 1971, 440). He argues that individuals' access to self-respect is to\na large degree a function of how the basic institutional structure of\na society defines and distributes the social bases of self-respect,\nwhich include the messages about the relative worth of citizens that\nare conveyed in the structure and functioning of institutions, the\ndistribution of fundamental political rights and civil liberties,\naccess to the resources individuals need to pursue their plans of\nlife, the availability of diverse associations and communities within\nwhich individuals can seek affirmation of their worth and their plans\nof life from others, and the norms governing public interaction among\ncitizens. Since self-respect is vital to individual well-being, Rawls\nargues that justice requires that social institutions and policies be\ndesigned to support and not undermine self-respect.  Rawls argues that\nthe principles of justice as fairness are superior to utilitarian\nprinciples insofar as they better affirm and promote self-respect for\nall citizens.  Rawls's view that the ability of individuals to respect themselves\nis heavily dependent on their social and political circumstances has\nbeen echoed by a number of theorists working in moral, social, and\npolitical philosophy. For example, Margalit (1996) argues that a\ndecent society is one whose institutions do not humiliate people, that\nis, give people good reason to consider their self-respect to be\ninjured (but see Bird 2010). Honneth's theory of social criticism (1995) focuses on the\nway people's self-respect and self-identity necessarily depend on the\nrecognition of others and so are vulnerable to being misrecognized or\nignored both by social institutions and in interpersonal\ninteractions. A number of theorists have used the concept of\nself-respect to examine the oppression of women, people of color, gays\nand lesbians, and other groups that are marginalized, stigmatized, or\nexploited by the dominant culture, identifying the plethora of ways in\nwhich oppressive institutions, images, and actions can do damage to\nthe self-respect of members of these groups. Other writers discuss\nways that individuals and groups might preserve or restore\nself-respect in the face of injustice or oppression, and the ways in\nwhich the development of self-respect in individuals living under\noppression or injustice empowers them to participate in the monumental\nstruggles for justice and liberation (for example, Babbitt 2000, 1993;\nBartky 1990a, 1990b, 1990c; Boxill 1992, 1976; Collins 1990; Dillon\n1997, 1995; Hay 2013, 2011; Meyers 1989, 1986; Mohr 1992, 1988;\nMoody-Adams 1992–93; Statman 2002; Thomas 2001b, 1983a,\n1978–79). Some theorists, especially those working within a\nfeminist framework, have argued that the prevailing conceptions of\nself-respect in Kantian theory or in contemporary liberal societies\nthemselves contain features that reflect objectionable aspects of the\ndominating culture, and they have attempted to reconceive self-respect\nin ways that are more conducive to empowerment and emancipation (for\nexample, Dillon 1992c, Borgwald 2012). \n\nIn moral philosophy, theorists have also focused on connections\nbetween self-respect and various virtues and vices, such as self-trust\n(Borgwald 2012, Govier 1993), justice (Bloomfield 2011), honesty\n(Mauri 2011), benevolence (Andrew 2011), humility (Dillon 2015, Grenberg 2010),\nself-forgiveness (Holmgren 1998, Dillon 2001), self-improvement\n(Johnson 2011), general immorality (Bagnoli 2009, Bloomfield 2008),\nand arrogance (Dillon 2003, 2007, forthcoming). \n\nEveryday discourse and practices insist that respect and self-respect\nare personally, socially, politically, and morally important, and\nphilosophical discussions of the concepts bear this out.  Their roles\nin our lives as individuals, as people living in complex relations\nwith other people and surrounded by a plethora of other beings and\nthings on which our attitudes and actions have tremendous effects,\ncannot, as these discussions reveal, be taken lightly.  The\ndiscussions thus far shed light on the nature and significance of the\nvarious forms of respect and self-respect and their positions in a\nnexus of profoundly important but philosophically challenging and\ncontestable concepts. These discussions also reveal that more work\nremains to be done in clarifying these attitudes and their places\namong and implications for our concepts and our lives.","contact.mail":"rsd2@lehigh.edu","contact.domain":"lehigh.edu"}]
