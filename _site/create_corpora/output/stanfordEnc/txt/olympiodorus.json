In his lectures, he\ninterpreted classical philosophical texts, mainly by Plato and\nAristotle; we still possess three of his commentaries on Plato and two\non Aristotle. At times, these seem to be carefully crafted pieces of\npedagogy, but at other times they read more like transcripts drawn up\nby one of the students. Although Olympiodorus comes across as a\nlearned man and guardian of traditional paideia, both\nliterary and philosophical, his œuvre compares unfavorably, from\na philosophical standpoint, with commentaries written by either\nAmmonius or Olympiodorus’ contemporaries such as Simplicius and John\nPhiloponus. Still, his work is valuable in that it affords us vivid\ninsights into the way in which pagan philosophy was taught to young\nmembers of the Christian elite who, for the most part, would move into\ncareers in the clergy or at the Byzantine court. The 6th\ncentury Alexandrian Olympiodorus must be distinguished from another\nOlympiodorus who supposedly lived in the first half of the\n5th century C.E. and was said by Marinus in his Life of\nProclus to have been a teacher of the latter at Athens. No better\nevidence of this earlier figure survives. The relationship of the\nyounger philosopher Olympiodorus to an alchemist, supposedly of the\nsame name and provenance, remains a matter of dispute.\n\n\n\nThere are exactly three more or less solid facts on the basis of which\none can reconstruct the general parameters of Olympiodorus’ life.\nFirst, he held the chair of philosophy in Alexandria (the majority of\nmanuscripts of his work refer to him as “the philosopher of\nAlexandria”). Second, he saw himself as intellectual heir to\nAmmonius (see in Meteor. 153,7; 175,14; 188,36; 238,19;\n255,23; 256,27; Olympiodorus refers to Ammonius frequently as\n“the great philosopher”, in one case as “our\nphilosopher”, in Gorg.  §40.5; cf. §39.2, and\nhe may have been Ammonius’ pupil).  Third, some of his lectures were\ndelivered not long after 565 (cf.  in Meteor. 52,31; the way\nOlympiodorus reminds his students about a comet that had appeared in\nMarch/April 565 suggests that the event occurred a couple of years\nearlier). It is generally assumed that Ammonius passed away (or at\nleast stopped teaching) sometime in the period between 517 and 526. If\nthese dates are correct, we can infer that Olympiodorus was a young\nman when he came to be one of the last pupils of Ammonius and that he\nled an active intellectual life into his late sixties, or early\nseventies of that century. Accordingly, the dates of Olympiodorus’\nlife should be approximately 500–570, encompassing the entire\nreign of emperor Justinian the Great (527–565). Since John\nPhiloponus was teaching philosophy actively until the mid-30s (without\never holding the chair of philosophy), it seems likely that\nOlympiodorus began his teaching career around that time to become the\nofficial successor to Ammonius. \n\nThe best way to understand the circumstances of his life is to get a\nsense of the final period of pagan philosophy in the age of Justinian\n(for a more detailed account, see Wildberg 2005, with further\nreferences). For our purposes, the most important factor is that in\nthe age of Justinian, philosophy, as a discipline taught in schools of\nhigher education, had acquired a highly ambiguous status. On the one\nhand, almost anyone in the empire was perfectly aware of the fact that\nJustinian had, right from the beginning of his reign, taken severe\nmeasures to eradicate philosophy as a way of pagan life and learning,\nboth private and public. The closing of the Athenian School around 529\n(with an apparent expropriation of its assets) is only the most\nnotorious example. On the other hand, members of the elite were\nevidently also acutely aware that it was impossible to sustain the\nculture of the empire, both secular and clerical, without a classical\neducation, part of which was and always had been, philosophy. A\ntraining in philosophy was all the more necessary since only a firm\ngrounding in logic and ontology could prepare one in a meaningful way\nfor participation in the subtle theological debates that dominated the\nbest minds at the time, notably the intractable problem of the nature\nof Christ: Does Christ have two natures, one human, one divine, or one\ncompound nature? How can one possibly understand the side-by-side of\ndivinity and humanity in a single substance? One could not hope to\nbecome an expert in theology (then regarded as the highest form of\nphilosophy) without having exposed oneself in a serious way to the\nworks of Aristotle and Plato. And so, under the emperor who did\nperhaps more than anyone to cripple philosophy, philosophy flourished\n— in Alexandria especially, but also elsewhere — in a\nmanner unparalleled in late antiquity. \n\nThis is the world to which Olympiodorus belonged, a highly trained\npagan philosopher rendering his services to an (at least officially)\nentirely Christian audience. Undoubtedly, the religious\npresuppositions of his students, their needs, interests, and\nexpectations, determined to a large extent the parameters and content\nof his classes, and, as we shall see, foregrounded the need for a\nconsiderable amount of pedagogy on the part of the lecturer. It is\nclear that even if he had wanted to, Olympiodorus could not have\nexpounded the views of Plato and Aristotle with the same zeal and\nconviction as, for example, Simplicius, who had no audience to lecture\nto (once Justinian had closed the school in Athens). To be sure,\nphilosophy was alive and well in the imperial institutions, but the\nlatter were confined on all sides by the walls of orthodoxy and\nheresy. This is what has to be kept in mind before one joins the\nchorus of detractors who bewail the philosophical paucity of\nOlympiodorus’ commentaries. (For a list of his works, see below,\nsect. 6.) \n\nOlympiodorus begins his commentary on Plato’s Alcibiades with\na grand gesture: “Aristotle began his own Theology with the\nwords: ‘All men by nature desire to know, and evidence for this\nis our love of perception’. But as I begin to speak about\nPlato’s philosophy, I would say this, which is better, that all men\nhave a desire for Plato’s philosophy, because all men want to draw\nsomething useful from it; they hurry to be spell-bound by its fountain\nand stand still only when they are full of Platonic enthusiasm.”\nOlympiodorus is working hard to galvanize his audience with his own\npassion for Plato; but it is characteristic of his entire work that he\nholds out for them, in the first place, that something useful is to be\ngained from the study of Plato. \n\nUseful in what sense? As if piecing together a Byzantine mosaic,\nOlympiodorus hands his students the shards and tesserae that could\namount, in the appropriate number and arrangement, to classical\npaideia. His commentaries on Plato abound with references to\nHomer, Demosthenes, the 2nd-century C.E. orator Aelius\nAristides, Plutarch, Epictetus and Aristotle as well as works of Plato\nother than the one being commented on, notably the Republic,\neven if his students had not read it yet. One gets the impression that\nOlympiodorus gently but firmly directs his pupils’ attention to an\nintellectual world waiting for them to discover it — if they\nwant to. We are entering a period in late antiquity in which Plato and\nAristotle cease to be gateways to the ‘truth’ and turn\ninto some kind of cultural heritage that was worth keeping alive for\nother reasons. Olympiodorus has rightly been called “the first\nclassicist” (Tarrant 1997). \n\nThis effort to stem the tide of cultural pauperization was carefully\npackaged and structured, without depriving the lecturer of the\nnecessary amount of flexibility: each class (praxis) was\ndivided into three sections. The reading of the original Platonic (or\nAristotelian) text was followed by an ‘overview’ over the\npassage (theôria), which in turn segued into a closer\nreading (lexis). The overview allowed the professor to make\nall kinds of general remarks on the significance and meaning of the\npassage under discussion; the close reading presented more detailed\nand often simply philological, linguistic, logical, or rhetorical\nobservations not unlike those found in our modern annotated editions.\nThe procedure of dividing one’s comments into these two different\nsections seems to be a formalized development of Proclus’ work (see\nBeutler 1949, 226). \n\nFalsehood or truth in philosophical matters (somewhat abstractly\nenshrined for Olympiodorus in ‘common notions’ [koinai\nennoiai]) is not something he much talks about. The reason may\nnot have been that he harbored no such convictions, but that they\nwould have been inappropriate or unwanted in the classroom. Very\noften, what has proved most interesting to modern scholars for\nhistorical reasons are remarks made entirely in passing, for example\nthe puzzling statement that some of the endowment of the Academy in\nAthens was still intact in his time (in Alc. §141.1f.);\nthat the Alexandrian rhetor Anatolius adapted a line of Homer to great\neffect in the year 546 (in Alc. §2.79–82); or that\nsuicide is forbidden because, according to the Orphic tradition,\n“human bodies belong to Dionysus” (in Phaed.\n§1.3). \n\nOccasionally, we encounter an anecdote about Ammonius, whom\nOlympiodorus clearly revered and whom he invokes frequently to inflate\nhis own authority. One such anecdote is suggestive of a tension\nbetween imperial rule and the political views of the\nphilosophers. Near the end of the Gorgias commentary\n(§42), Olympiodorus endorses the view that aristocracy is the\nbest form of government and far superior to democracy, and he\njustifies this by claiming that the city, just like the human being,\nis a microcosm that should resemble the macrocosm\n‘universe’. But this argument seems to favor monarchy; for\njust as the universe is ruled by one, i.e., God, there “should\nnot be a number of ordinary people who rule, but one prudent and true\nstatesman.” Olympiodorus continues: “Now, if somebody says\n‘But this is monarchy, not aristocracy, and that is not the same\nthing’, reply as the philosopher Ammonius replied: ‘Give\nhim the knuckles and praise him. For it is the same, … even if\nthere are many exceedingly good people, they form a living unit, for\nthey have everything in common.’” (§42.2) \n\nOne question to ask is how the opposed positions of teacher and\nstudent, paganism and Christianity, ancient and ‘modern’\nplayed out in Olympiodorus’ classroom? Here are some illustrative\nexamples. The Delphic oracle still seemed to enjoy an awe-inspiring\nreputation, but the names of Greek gods in Plato’s text, especially\nZeus, are often omitted and/or replaced by the word ‘God’.\nOlympiodorus has trouble showing his students ways in which to make\nsense of pagan divinities in their effort to adapt pagan philosophy to\nthe Christian context: “Do not be disturbed by names when you\nhear talk of a ‘Power of Cronus’ or a ‘Power of\nZeus’ or suchlike, but concentrate on the objects themselves,\nfor we signify something different when we use these names. If you\nwish, think that these powers do not have individual essences and are\nnot distinct from one another, but place them within the first cause\nand say that there are within it both intellectual and vital\npowers” (in Gorg. §47.2). \n\nAt times the underlying tensions rise to the surface, but Olympiodorus\nwas expertly evasive of trouble from the audience. In his\n44th lecture on the Gorgias, for instance, he\nreassures his students that pagan myths ought not to be taken\nliterally; one ought to understand that names such as Zeus and Hera\nand Hades were merely part of the language in which ‘they’\n(i.e., the ancient Greeks) talked. Puzzled by the vertiginous and\nconflicting possibilities of allegorical\ninterpretations of myth, once they are not taken literally, one\nobstinate student must have intervened, for Olympiodorus makes the\nfollowing evasive remark (§44.7): “If someone says\n‘Then neither ought we put trust in philosophers, since they are\nin disagreement, some saying the soul is water, others that it is air,\nsome that it is mortal, others that it is immortal’, we reply\nthat in this case we put our trust in those who stay closer to the\ncommon notions. But [in myths] there are no common notions to guide\nour education. Hence we should first explicate the myths — for\nindeed Plato explicates them. So he said earlier …”. \n\nEven if some students were repelled by the general world-view of\npaganism, it is clear that many of them were fascinated by its more\nsinister aspects. At one point in the Gorgias (513a),\nSocrates mentions in passing certain Thessalian witches who pull down\nthe moon and cause an eclipse. In Lecture 39 on the Gorgias,\nOlympiodorus explains the story behind these witches in a few broad\nstrokes, apparently to his own satisfaction. But witchcraft was just\nthe thing students wanted to hear a bit more about from the pagan\nphilosopher, so Lecture 40 begins like this: “Since last time I\nreferred to the Thessalian women, it is worth explaining the practice,\nwhy people think wizards draw down the moon [at an eclipse], and why\nordinary people beat on bronze. Note that an eclipse is nothing other\nthan the privation of light. During this privation in particular,\nwhile it is dark, certain infernal demons wander around, since the\nworld is without light. Then unholy and God-hating wizards cast spells\nto attract these demons. Hence the multitude believes that they draw\ndown the moon. And since at such time demons are among us, people beat\non bronze, thereby casting off and driving the demonic interference\naway.  I have dealt with these things because you are not without\nideas about these customs. Now let me come to the present\ntopic.” Philosophically, all this is of no interest at all, but\nlooking at it from a cultural point of view one gets a fascinating\nwhiff of the bewildering concerns of students reading Plato in the\nsixth century. \n\nBeing a pagan philosopher on the municipal payroll of the City of\nAlexandria—or worse, being dependent on voluntary student\nfees—must have been no enviable position. One can imagine that\nthe act of playing the token philosopher in Alexandria and lecturing\nfor decades on important matters which no-one in the audience any more\nreally cared about took its toll. The Greek\nAnthology attributes to Olympiodorus an at the same time artful\nand depressing epigram (Anth. Gr., Appendix 177): \n\nThe Prolegomena to Aristotle’s logic, or in a sense to his\nwhole philosophical work, begins again with a carefully worded\nstatement that is reminiscent of the first words of the\nAlcibiades commentary: “Since we want to enjoy the\nfountain of good things, there is an eagerness in us to cling to\nAristotle’s philosophy, which provides life with the principle of good\nthings, and not the least because it leads the bright mind towards\nprecision as to what is being sought.”\n(Proleg. 1,3–6). The Prolegomena consists of\nfive lectures in which he gives his students a brief overview of the\nvarious schools of Greek philosophy and the division of the works of\nAristotle; he explains, among other things, the aim of Aristotle’s\nphilosophy (recognition of the Good — apparently the prime mover\nof the Metaphysics — as the principle of everything,\n9,14–30) and the moral an intellectual requirements of a student\nand of a teacher of philosophy (10,3–33). The various\nphilosophical thinkers and schools are being introduced without\nevaluations of their philosophical merits, and there is no talk about\nthe harmony of the philosophers in general, or between Plato and\nAristotle.  \n\nOlympiodorus adopts the view of Iamblichus that the subject-matter\n(skopos) of the Categories is speech\nsignifying things by the mediation of thoughts\n(Proleg. 21,101–3; in Cat. 28,25ff), which\nconforms with the basic interpretation of the Categories in\nthe school of Alexandria. Formally, too, the commentary resembles more\nthan his other commentaries on Aristotle do the standard format\nfamiliar from other Neoplatonic commentators on Aristotle. Unlike the\ncommentary on the Meteorology, which displays the typically\nOlympiodorean structure of being divided into praxeis which\nare then subdivided into longer expositions of the meaning of the\npassage under discussion (theôriai) and more detailed\nanalyses of the text (lexeis), the commentary on the\nCategories is simply divided into theôriai\n(which don’t seem to be further subdivided). \n\nThe Meteorology commentary begins without any significant\nintroduction directly with Aristotle’s text. It is impossible to tell\nwhether his students, at that point, had worked their way through the\n(in the order of the curriculum) prior physical treatises, notably the\nPhysics, de Caelo, and de Generatione et\nCorruptione. In any case, Olympiodorus makes no reference to\nlectures he had previously delivered on these texts; all he does is\nplace the present work into the context of the other physical\ntreatises. So he says, for example, that Aristotle wrote three\ntreatises about the elementary bodies, the de Caelo, which\nconcerns itself with them insofar as they are eternal, the de\nGeneratione, which concerns their coming to be, and the\nMeteorology, which treats them as things that are\n“subject to influences” (pathainomena), a very\nunusual term the precise meaning of which Olympiodorus nowhere\ndefines. The term occurs in Proclus, but in different contexts. \n\nThis commentary (written after 565) is of particular interest, since\nit is the only complete commentary on the Meteorology extant\nfrom antiquity. There is another commentary, written by the Christian\nJohn Philoponus some 30 years earlier, but it is incomplete (comments\nbreak off in the 12th chapter of Book I). This was, in\nfact, Philoponus’ last commentary, written after the highly\ncontroversial contra Aristotelem and probably just at the\ntime when he stopped teaching philosophy. Olympiodorus must have been\nfamiliar with the gist, if not the details, of Philoponus’ searing\ncriticism of Aristotle, yet he appears to be entirely unfazed by\nit. He announces early on the Aristotelian orthodoxy that there are\nfive elements, not merely four, and that the celestial element\n(aithêr) is creative (poiêtikos), the\nother elements material (hulikos) (in Meteor.\n2,15f). Strikingly, he happily reproduces Aristotle’s argument for the\nexistence of a fifth element from the de Caelo (the\ncircularity of the celestial motion can only be explained on the\nassumption of a special celestial element, cf.  in Meteor.\n16,25–17,9). He polemicizes against the view that the heavens\nconsist of fire (in Meteor. 17,1–18,30), and in no way\nqualifies, hides, or denies the fact (scandalous to Christians) that\nAristotle thought the universe, and time, to be eternal (in\nMeteor. 8,8f;123,24f). \n\nOlympiodorus’ main influences in this commentary stem from Alexander\nof Aphrodisias, whom he cites frequently, and the views of Ammonius,\nwhich he was intimately familiar with. But Olympiodorus never refers\nto Philoponus. There are occasional references to certain unnamed\npeople who proffered views Olympiodorus disagrees with (see e.g.,\n4,16; 7,22; 23,5.11.18.20), but it is difficult to trace these views\nback to Philoponus. The latter seems to have been of no concern to\nhim. Shockingly, perhaps, Olympiodorus simply ignores relevant and\nimportant intellectual work that was carried out in his own lifetime,\nin the same ‘university’, and even the same\n‘department’ by a man he must have known personally. To\nOlympiodorus and his disciples, as with Simplicius in Athens, John\nPhiloponus was evidently persona non grata. \n\nDiscussion of the commentary on Aristotle’s Meteorology (with\nthe co-called “chemical treatise” as its fourth book)\nprompts the question of the identity of the Neoplatonist Olympiodorus\nwith another figure carrying precisely the same name who appears in\nthe alchemist tradition. Four extant manuscripts of an alchemical work\nthat purports to be a commentary on Zosimus’ Kat’\nenergeian (On Activity) state that the piece was written\nby “Olympiodorus, the Alexandrian philosopher” (see\n§6 below). The alchemical treatise starts out as a commentary on\nZosimus (of Panopolis, not the 5th c. C.E. historian),\nexplaining a small passage in some detail, but then continues in the\nvein of a didactic letter written to an unnamed fellow alchemist\n(called ‘friend of the Muses’ at one point); it\n‘explains’ how to join scattered parts of gold and purify\nmetals, emphasizes the significance of ‘divine water’\n(whatever that is) and so on and so forth. The author knows a smidgen\nabout the Presocratics (whom he regards as alchemists), but next to\nnothing about Plato and Aristotle; instead, he can quote at length\nfrom Zosimus, Hermes, Petasius, Pelagius, and a “divine\nMary” — not the mother of Jesus but a Jewish sage\nelsewhere attested in the alchemist tradition. \n\nA closer survey of the text quickly reveals that scholars like H.D.\nSaffrey 2005 are right to suppose that the alchemical treatise cannot\nhave been produced by the Neoplatonist philosopher. For one thing,\nunlike the philosopher, the alchemist seems to be a Christian,\nattributing a saying by Paul (“The letter kills, but the spirit\ngives life.” 2 Cor. 3.6) to “the Lord” (94,\n13–15). In addition, contents, style, diction, as well as the\nwhole rhetorical ambience created by the two authors are strikingly\ndifferent. C. Viano 2006, who once defended the identity of the two\nfigures and who still detects some similarities in language between\nthe alchemical treatise and the commentary on Book IV of Aristotle’s\nMeteorology, now proposes that the author of the alchemical\ntreatise may have used Olympiodorus’ Meteorology commentary,\nor another, more alchemical (rather than philosophical) work; the\nalchemist’s manuscripts would then be testimony to the influence of\nOlympiodorus. \n\nIn any case, we can be quite sure that the Neoplatonist Olympiodorus\ndid not write this piece of alchemy. Nevertheless, it seems\nto be clearly he whom the manuscripts refer to as the work’s\nauthor. Since pseudepigraphy is one of the defining characteristics of\nthe genre of alchemist literature, it seems safe to assume that the\ncommentary on Zosimus is a false attribution. There never was another\nAlexandrian named Olympiodorus whose expertise was alchemy rather than\nPlatonic philosophy. \n\nThe teaching of philosophy did not cease with the death of\nOlympiodorus. He evidently had intelligent pupils who devoted\nthemselves to philosophy in a professional way. Whether they were\npagans or Christians is not entirely clear, but their commentaries\nwere passed around under such names as David and Elias. We can tell\nthat they were influenced by Olympiodorus, not only because they refer\nto him, but also because they adopt his pedagogical method of dividing\ntheir lectures into theôriai and lexeis. The\nsame goes for Stephanus of Alexandria, who taught philosophy in\nConstantinople at the beginning of the 7th century. \n\nOlympiodorus’ wider influence is somewhat less tangible than that of\nthe other great Alexandrians. The Syrians and the Arabs certainly knew\nand read him, but not extensively. Neither did the Latin west. The\ncommentary on the Categories has come down to us in only one\nmanuscript (Codex Mutinensi 69), and there are only a handful\nof manuscripts of the Meteorology commentary.  Manuscripts of\nhis commentaries on Plato are equally rare, with the exception of\nthose containing the Phaedo commentary. Yet, to medieval\nalchemists Olympiodorus’ illustrious name sounded arcane enough to\ndeserve induction into the fictitious canon of ancient alchemists. \n\nApart from these works, we possess scholia from Olympiodorus’\ncommentary on Aristotle’s de Interpretatione in the Codex\nVaticanus Urbinas Graecus 35. The mutilated anonymous commentary\non the de Interpretatione extant in Codex Parisinus\nGraecus 2064 and edited by L. Tarán 1978 has been wrongly\nascribed to Olympiodorus. The same holds for the commentary on Plato’s\nPhilebus which, although attributed to Olympiodorus, has been\nshown by L. G. Westerink 1959 to be the work of Damascius. \n\nOlympiodorus must have written a great deal more over his long\ncareer. He himself refers to a commentary on Porphyry’s\nIntroduction (see in Cat. 16,26; 60,10; 68,15.17);\nit was used by David and Elias. There must have been commentaries on\nAristotle’s Analytics (a late hand in the Jerusalem\nmanuscript Taphos 150 attributes the commentary on the Prior\nAnalytics contained therein to Olympiodorus) and on Aristotle’s\nphysical treatises (commentaries on de Generatione et\nCorruptione and on de Anima are mentioned in Arabic\nsources, and the Ambrosianus Q 74 possibly contains a fragment of the\nlatter, see Rashed). In the Alcibiades commentary\n(§110,8f.), Olympiodorus announces lectures on the\nSophist. \n\nThe work On the ‘On Activity’ by Zosimus; all that has\nbeen said by Hermes and the Philosophers should be regarded as a\nspurious work.
