Arguably, if you recognize another person with regard to a\ncertain feature, as an autonomous agent, for example, you do not only\nadmit that she has this feature but you embrace a positive attitude\ntowards her for having this feature. Such recognition implies that you\nbear obligations to treat her in a certain way, that is, you recognize\na specific normative status of the other person, e.g., as a free and\nequal person.  But recognition does not only matter normatively. It is\nalso of psychological importance. Most theories of recognition assume\nthat in order to develop a practical identity, persons fundamentally\ndepend on the feedback of other subjects (and of society as a\nwhole). According to this view, those who fail to experience adequate\nrecognition, i.e., those who are depicted by the surrounding others or\nthe societal norms and values in a one-sided or negative way, will\nfind it much harder to embrace themselves and their projects as\nvaluable. Misrecognition thereby hinders or destroys persons’\nsuccessful relationship to their selves. It has been poignantly\ndescribed how the victims of racism and colonialism have suffered\nsevere psychological harm by being demeaned as inferior humans (Fanon\n1952). Thus, recognition constitutes a “vital human need”\n(Taylor 1992, 26).\n\n\nRecognition theory is thought to be especially well-equipped to\nilluminate the psychological mechanisms of social and political\nresistance. As experiences of misrecognition violate the identity of\nsubjects, the affected are supposed to be particularly motivated to\nresist, that is, to engage in a “struggle for recognition.”\nTherefore, at least since the 1990s, theories of recognition have\nenjoyed a lively academic as well as public interest. They promise to\nilluminate a variety of new social movements—be it the\nstruggles of ethnic or religious minorities, of gays and lesbians or of\npeople with disabilities. None of these groups primarily fight for a\nmore favorable distribution of goods. Rather, they struggle for an\naffirmation of their particular identity and are thus thought\nto be engaged in a new form of politics, sometimes labeled\n“politics of difference” or “identity\npolitics.” However, many accounts want to ascribe a much more\nfundamental role to the concept of recognition—covering the\nmorality of human relationships in its entirety. From this more general\nperspective, also earlier campaigns for equal rights—be it by\nworkers, women or African Americans—should be understood as\n“struggles for recognition.” To frame these political\nmovements in terms of recognition highlights the relational character\nof morality—and justice: Justice is not primarily concerned\nwith how many goods a person should have but rather with what kind of\nstanding vis-à-vis other persons she deserves (Young 1990).\n\n\n\nThis entry will first discuss some controversies surrounding the\nvery concept of recognition (1) before reviewing four dimensions of\nwhat is recognized (by whom and on what\ngrounds) that have been highlighted by different theories of\nrecognition (2). However, even in light of these differentiations some\nauthors have expressed the fear that concentrating on the issue of\nrecognition might supplant the central problem of (re)distribution on\nthe political agenda (3). Finally, the often rather sanguine\ndescriptions of recognition and its potential for emancipation (4)\nhave been fundamentally challenged: The concern is that because the\nneed for recognition renders persons utterly dependent on the\ndominating societal norms it may undermine the identity of any critic. Thus, some worry that struggles for recognition may lead to\nconformism and a strengthening of ideological formations (5).\n\n\n\nRecognition presupposes a subject of recognition (the recognizer) and\nan object (the recognized). Before asking what kind of subjects and\nobjects of recognition are possible (1.2) this entry discusses the\nmeaning of “recognition” and how it differs from\nneighboring concepts such as “identification” and\n“acknowledgment” (1.1). \n\nPaul Ricoeur has distinguished as many as 23 different usages of the\nnotion “to recognize” (Ricoeur 2005, 5–16) grouping them\nunder three main categories, namely recognition as identification,\nrecognizing oneself and mutual recognition. Many authors have\nchallenged Ricoeur’s view by proposing a distinction between\nrecognition (of oneself as well as of others) and\n“identification”: Whereas we identify an X as an X without\nnecessarily affirming it as (and because of) X, recognition requires a\npositive evaluation of X. The term “acknowledgment” which\nsome authors use interchangeably with recognition (Appiah 1992, 149) is\nalso contested. Whereas some have argued that we acknowledge the\nvalidity of certain insights, values and norms\n(Ikäheimo/Laitinen 2007, 34–37), others continue to use the term\n“acknowledgment” with regard to persons but intend it to\ndenote something less ambitious than the wholesale affirmation of their\nspecific identity (Cavell 1969; Markell 2003). However, it is the\nmeaning of mutual recognition that lies at the heart of the\ncontemporary discussion. \n\nMutuality has always served as the explanatory and normative core of\nthe concept of recognition. Most theories draw on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel who\nwas, in turn, heavily influenced by Johann Gottlieb Fichte (for their\ncommon roots in Jean-Jacques Rousseau see Neuhouser 2008). According to\nFichte we become conscious of our own autonomy by being challenged—or as Fichte would characterize it: “called upon”—by the actions of another subject. Only by understanding that\nthe other’s actions are intentional can we also grasp our own\nactions and utterances as expressions of an intentional self. This\nthought is most famously expressed in Hegel’s Phenomenology\nof Spirit where this interpersonal encounter logically culminates\nin a struggle of life and death (see esp. Kojève 1947 whose\nreading strongly influenced Jean-Paul Sartre and Jacques Lacan; also\nthe contributions in O’Neill 1996). Within the\nPhenomenology this idea is first and foremost a thesis about\nhow we can gain self-consciousness as autonomous agents,\nnamely only by interacting with other autonomous subjects (see in more\ndetail 2.1 below). However, this idea also leads Hegel to consider the\nimportance of differing forms of mutual recognition. Already in his\nearly writings in the Jena Realphilosophie of 1805/06 Hegel\nexpands the Fichtean motif by referring to the Hobbesian idea of a\nfundamental struggle—albeit not of self-interest but of\nrecognition. In Hegel’s story of the state of nature social\nrelationships are a (perhaps forgotten) given: A person who attacks\nyour property does not primarily want to gain material goods. Rather,\nshe wishes to remind you, the first possessor, that she is a person\nwith moral standing as well who has been neglected by the act of first acquisition (Siep 1979, 39; Honneth 1992, 44–45). As becomes\nespecially clear in the Phenomenology: By fighting against the\nother the subject wants to affirm her own freedom by proving that her\nnormative status is of more importance to her than any of her (animal)\ndesires, including—at an extreme—her desire to live.\nHowever, such fighting, expressive of autonomy, must lead to an impasse\nas it cannot achieve mutual recognition: either one of the subjects\ndies or subjects herself as a slave to the other, the superior master,\nand thus fails to express her autonomy. Furthermore, in this case the\nmaster does not receive adequate recognition either, because the\nrecognizer has proven to be a “mere” slave who does not\ncount as an autonomous and competent judge. Thus, adequate recognition\ncan only be achieved within an institutionalized order of\nrights that secures genuinely mutual recognition (Williams 1997,\n59–68). Hegel develops this latter thought most systematically in his\nmature Philosophy of Right. Here, the relationships and\nimplicit norms of the three spheres of, first, love within the family,\nsecond, contractual respect within civil society and, third, solidarity\nwithin the state are supposed to be necessary in order to actualize\nindividual autonomy, but not in the sense of mere\n“negative” but of “social” freedom. These\nspheres allow the subjects to feel at home within (or\n“reconciled” with) the ethical life of their community\n(which is organized as a state) because it provides the subjects with\nthe meanings necessary for a fulfilling individual life that they can\nembrace (see also 2.3 below). \n\nIt has been argued that focusing on the idea of mutuality may limit\nthe scope of recognition too much. Rather, we should distinguish\nbetween a narrow understanding of recognition based on the feature of\nmutuality and a wide understanding grounded in the idea of adequate\nregard (Laitinen 2010). The latter reading emphasizes that by affirming\na valuable feature of any entity (i.e., also of animals and even\ninanimate nature, not only of persons) we properly\n‘recognize’ it regardless of whether the recognized object\nrealizes this fact (or is even able to do so). Thus, the wide\nunderstanding allows for many objects of recognition that cannot\nthemselves be subjects of recognition. However, so far this constitutes\na minority position. \n\nBy contrast, because most theorists of recognition argue that\nrecognition is a genuinely interpersonal endeavor, they conclude that\nonly subjects of recognition can be proper objects of recognition.\nAt its margins, this narrow understanding of mutual recognition between\npersons raises the question from which point onward children can start\nto be subjects of recognition (and whether at least some animals can\nqualify as such). Most theories of recognition—drawing, for\nexample, on psychoanalytic object-relations theory (see in more detail\n2.4 below)—speak of recognition in the context of the\nrelationship between parents and babies. This suggests, of course, that\nhuman babies face the surrounding world differently than even the most\ndeveloped animals do (see in more detail 2.1 below). \n\nWhen it comes to the question of collective agents, there is still\nconsiderable uncertainty within the literature. In the following, this\nentry distinguishes between (i) groups, (ii) corporations or states and\n(iii) institutions more generally. (i) Most authors readily grant that\n(at least certain) groups of persons may be the subject and object of\n(mis)recognition because a group can share collective intentions as\nwell as certain features for which it can be misrecognized (especially\nif these features constitute the group’s self-understanding).\n(ii) It is more contested whether more complex collective actors such\nas corporations or states—to the extent they are thought to\nhave a legal personality—can be regarded as subjects and\nobjects of recognition in the proper sense (see for the latter Rawls\n1999, 34–35). For example, there is dissent about whether the\nacts of the “collective actor” are rather to be understood\nas resulting from the mere aggregation of individual intentions, thus signifying\nindividual acts of (mis)recognition, or whether \nthey display genuinely autonomous collective intentions. Philip Pettit argues for the latter position by pointing out that in order to act reliably (internally and externally) a collective agent’s decisions have to display a certain coherence over time, which is achieved by procedures (Pettit 2007, 180). Recently, there have been attempts\nto introduce the notion of recognition into the field of International\nRelations, beyond the common usage of a legal recognition of states.\nOften enough, it is argued, the (violent) behavior of states cannot be\nreductively understood as a merely instrumental striving for ever more\npower but should (at least also) be perceived as a struggle for\nrecognition (see the contributions in Lindemann/Ringmar 2011, O’Neill/Smith 2012, part III, and Daase et al. 2015). Certainly, citizens frequently speak as if their state was disrespected by another state but it\nremains to be seen whether these citizens are in fact merely indignant\nabout their government being disrespected, some public official or they themselves\nas members of the state (in more detail Iser 2015, 30–34). (iii) Finally,\nwhat about institutions more generally? A lot depends on one’s\ndefinition of institutions, which can be part of a state (for example,\na state’s constitution) or transcend state borders (as the\ninstitution of the free global market). Institutions cannot as easily\nbe described as collective actors. Still, given that they are human\nproducts, there is broad agreement that an institution (say, a\nconstitution) can disrespect persons because institutions, besides\neffectively regulating behavior, always express—as well as\nreinforce—underlying attitudes of those who designed or keep on\nreproducing them. In distinguishing between a civilized society where\nindividuals do not humiliate each other and a decent society where at\nleast the institutions do not do so, Avishai Margalit (1996, 1–2)\nexplicitly affirms this point. Furthermore, political resistance as a\nmoral endeavor would prove to be unintelligible if we did not assume\nthat political institutions (and not only the agents acting within\nthem) could be subjects of misrecognition. But can institutions\nthemselves be disrespected? Institutions can certainly be disregarded\nbut it may be argued that institutions (similar to values and norms)\nare either “acknowledged” or not whereas it is only persons\nor groups subject to these institutions who can be properly\n“(mis)recognized” as only here (mis)recognition has\nconsequences for the object’s self-conception. \n\nWe can differentiate the concept of recognition according\nto the kind of features a person is recognized for. Most agree that only in a formal sense is recognition a vital human\nneed or an anthropological constant. New demands of recognition always\nowe themselves to the historically established and changing ideas of\nwhat kind of recognition we deserve. This is illustrated by the rather\nrecent historical development in which the premodern concept of honor\n(which was assigned to persons as members of a group within a\nhierarchical social structure) was divided into two parts: first, into\nthe modern notion of equal respect awarded to all agents capable of\nautonomy and, second, into the idea of esteem due to one’s\nachievements. Whereas the former now guarantees a basic level of\nrecognition for everyone, the latter creates a hitherto unknown\ninsecurity with regard to the question of what kind of recognition one\ndeserves (Taylor 1992, 34–35); an insecurity which, according to some\nauthors, has led to the growing importance of intimate love and\nfriendship within the private sphere. \n\nKantians—and liberals more generally—usually concentrate\non the first dimension of the modern recognition order, i.e., on\nrespect for the equal dignity of autonomous beings. Hegelian theories\nof recognition, by contrast, embrace a more encompassing view of\nrecognition attempting to cover all spheres of recognition within\nmodernity. Thus, in his classical text on the topic, “The\nPolitics of Recognition,” Charles Taylor distinguishes three\nforms of recognition (Taylor 1992). Whereas a “politics of\nuniversalism” aims at the equal recognition of all persons in\ntheir common humanity, a “politics of difference”—as\nonly one dimension of a politics of recognition (Blum 1998; Thompson\n2006, 7–8)—emphasizes the uniqueness of specific (and\nespecially cultural) features (Taylor 1992, 37) often associated with\ncommunitarianism. Finally, Taylor thematizes the recognition of\nconcrete individuality in contexts of loving care that are of utmost\nimportance to subjects (Taylor 1992, 37). It is these three dimensions\nof the modern recognition order—which reach back to Hegel’s\ntreatment of the subject—that have been primarily analyzed in\nthe discussion (Ikäheimo 2002). They have even been interpreted\nas genealogically distinct stages along which individual persons gain\nself-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem (Honneth 1992, ch. 5).\nHowever, some have argued that a much more fundamental form of\n“elementary” recognition (2.1) is underlying these modern\nspheres of respect (2.2), esteem (2.3) as well as love and friendship\n(2.4). \n\nHegel’s famous idea that we gain self-consciousness only\nthrough a process of mutual recognition (see 1.1 above) has been taken\nup by some neo-Hegelian philosophers of mind. They make the\nsocio-ontological claim that the world is always cooperatively\n(re)constructed by human agents (see Pinkard 1994, Pippin 2008, also\nthe contributions in Ikäheimo/Laitinen 2011). Only mutual\nrecognition that grants others the status of an epistemic authority\nallows us to construct a normative space of reasons: I know that the\ntruth of my judgment depends on you being able to share it (Brandom\n1994). Thus, such accounts try to explain how reason can enter the\nworld in the first place—and therefore this kind of elementary\nrecognition does not seem to depend on values or norms but rather be a\nsource thereof. As early as the 1960s and 1970s, Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas similarly developed their respective variants\nof discourse ethics stressing that the proper use of language already\npresupposes a certain form of recognition of all other speakers as\nequally authoritative (see on both Habermas 1991, ch. 2, for a critique of this argument Wellmer 1986, 108–111, for a good introduction Baynes 2015). However, human beings never create their world\nor the reasons they use from scratch. Rather, they are embedded in\nholistic webs of meanings which they jointly reproduce (and\nmay hereby also redo). Theories of recognition hereby provide\nthe ground for a critique of atomistic views of subjectivity\n(especially in Taylor 1989, part I). \n\nSome have even argued that only empathy with other persons allows us\nto take over their perspective (Cavell 1969) which, again, seems to be\na prerequisite for sharing their evaluative reasons: recognition is\nprimary to cognition (Honneth 2005, 40–44). These ideas have gained\nadditional currency through psychological findings suggesting that the\nchild’s brain can only develop cognitively if she is able\nto be emotionally attached to her primary care-givers. Only by being\ninterested in sharing experiences with other autonomous beings does the\nchild gain access to the world of meaning (Tomasello 1999, Hobson\n2002). \n\nIn this vein it has been argued that people come to recognize others\nas persons very early on. Already the baby learns to recognize her\nattachment figures as intelligible beings, i.e., as meaning-conferring\nand autonomous. Quite automatically, so the argument goes, the child\nthen later perceives all other humans as humans. Only\nafterwards the subject may become blind to this “antecedent\nrecognition” (Honneth 2005, 58). Such “forgetfulness of\nrecognition” is supposedly caused either by reifying social\npractices which prompt individuals to perceive subjects merely as\nobjects or by ideological belief systems that depict some human beings\nas non- or sub-human (Honneth 2005, 59–60). \n\nIn sum, this elementary form shows that recognition is not only\nneeded for the creation and preservation of a subject’s identity,\nbut that it also denotes a basic normative attitude. Brandom emphasizes\nthat—besides constituting self-consciousness as an\n“essentially, and not just accidentally, […]\nsocial achievement […]—recognition is a\nnormative attitude. To recognize someone is to take her to be\nthe subject of normative statuses, that is, of commitments and\nentitlements, as capable of undertaking responsibilities and exercising\nauthority” (Brandom 2007, 136, emphasis in original). Whereas Brandom concentrates on\nrather basic normative ascriptions, all phenomena of recognition can be\ndescribed as inherently normative. In particular, there is one specific\nform of recognition in modernity that seems to flow quite naturally\nfrom our basic capacity of recognizing each other in the elementary\nform sketched so far, namely equal respect. \n\nEver since the idea of universal human rights has been established\nin modernity, assigning equal dignity or respect is commonly thought to\nbe the central dimension of recognition. Nearly every moral philosopher\nwriting today accepts this (Kantian) idea, even if not all embrace it\nin the terminology of recognition. One of the authors who explicitly\ndoes so is Thomas Scanlon. According to him, respect expresses the\nfoundation of morality as such, because the “contractualist ideal\nof acting in accord with principles that others (similarly motivated)\ncould not reasonably reject is meant to characterize the relations with\nothers the value and appeal of which underlies our reasons to do what\nmorality requires. This relation […] might be called a relation\nof mutual recognition. Standing in this relation to others is appealing\nin itself—worth seeking for its own sake” (Scanlon 1998,\n162). For Scanlon, therefore, moral blame is especially relevant because it signifies a disturbance of this basic relationship\n(Scanlon 2008, cf. Wallace 2012). What is valued here, again, is\nautonomous agency, the capacity to respond to reasons. \n\nMost discussions in moral and political philosophy can be seen as\ndisputes over what it means to recognize the other as equal, i.e., what\nproper respect demands. Such respect (for the humanity in each person)\nhas to be distinguished from a common usage in which\n“respect” denotes something quite different, namely a\ncertain respect for the (moral) qualities of a particular\nperson’s character or conduct (for example, in Rawls 1971, §\n67; Sennett 2003). It has been proposed that the former should be\ntermed “recognition respect” whereas the latter should be\nlabeled “appraisal respect” (Darwall 1977). Appraisal\nrespect resembles esteem (see 2.3 below) in that particular properties\nof a person are valued—and not so much the general fact that\nshe is a person capable of autonomous agency. In the\nfollowing, the term “respect” will be used to denote the\nattitude of “recognition respect” with regard to the equal\nmoral standing of persons and their demands. \n\nAs we face a continuum from severe degradation to phenomena of which\nit is hotly contested whether they are disrespectful, quite a few\ntheories of recognition have focused on the negative experiences of\nclear disrespect. In fact, the normative expectation of being\ntreated with respect is most obvious when we look at extreme forms of\nhumiliation in which specific (groups of) humans are symbolically and\nconsequently also materially excluded from humanity, are treated like\nanimals or mere objects. In response to such extreme forms of\nhumiliation, Margalit has concluded that our primary political aim\nshould be to strive for a decent society instead of a fully just one\n(Margalit 1996, 271–291) and there has been some discussion about\nwhether recognition theory has a natural affinity with minimal or\nnegative theories of morality (Allen 2001). \n\nBeing faced with extreme humiliation, the interplay between\nnormative and psychological aspects becomes especially salient. Even if\nthe victims know that their degradation is unjustified, they cannot but\nfeel humiliated all the same. Any trust in being able to control their\nlives is stripped away from them. In the course of mistreatment,\ntorture and rape the perpetrators do not only intentionally inflict\npain and injury on their victims but also deride the agency of the\nlatter. This combination undermines basic self- and world-trust (Scarry\n1985; Rorty 1989, ch. 7–9; Margalit 1996, 115–119, 145). \n\nHowever, even less extreme forms of mistreating persons manifest\ndisrespect. In these cases it is not necessarily denied that those\nunder discussion are humans, but rather that they have equal moral\nand/or legal standing. Instead of being approached as adults, women and\npeople of different color, for instance, were, for the most part of\nhistory, treated like children. They were regarded as\n“second-class citizens” (Taylor 1992, 37) not capable of\nresponsibly reproducing and shaping the social norms of their\ncommunities. Only equal positive rights institutionalize recognition in\na publicly manifest way and thus make it easier for the individual to\ndevelop self-respect (Feinberg 1970, 251–253), “perhaps the most\nimportant primary good” (Rawls 1971, § 67). \n\nNonetheless, there is a certain tension between recognizing somebody as\na legal rights holder and the idea of a full-fledged recognition order.\nThe very idea of subjective rights allows persons to step out of all\ninterpersonal relations and insist on their “right”\nwhatever reasons might be raised against that by others (Menke 2009).\nYet, in granting every subject the right to use their powers of reasons\nas they see fit, law recognizes their autonomous agency. It hereby\ntakes into account the fact of reasonable pluralism. Although people\nmight disagree with each other, toleration of the other’s\ndissenting opinion is then supposed to be grounded in equal respect\n(see Forst 2013) and not only a way of grudgingly settling for a\nmodus vivendi. Nonetheless, theorists of recognition (within\nthe Hegelian tradition) have warned that concentrating entirely on\nnegative liberty without considering the wider social context in which\nsuch liberty is embedded and on which it depends might lead to social\npathologies (Honneth 2014, ch. 4). With this warning they join\ncommunitarian voices. Thus, one necessary step is to secure the\nlegitimacy of the legal order by ascribing equal democratic rights to\nall citizens. This recognizes them as being able to orient themselves\ntoward the common good (and not only to their self-interest). \n\nThe major emancipatory movements of the last two centuries—for instance the women’s or the civil rights movements in the US—fought for equal respect and rights. In contrast, in many of\nthe contemporary social struggles persons or groups demand recognition\nof specific (e.g., cultural or religious) aspects of their identities\nwhich are neglected or demeaned by the dominant value and norm system\nof their society. It is these phenomena which have helped popularize\nthe notions of a “politics of recognition” or\n“identity politics.” However, it is contested why these\ndifferences should matter normatively: Do we owe such recognition to\nthe affected as subjects with equal moral status (a) or\nbecause we should esteem their specific properties as valuable\n(b)? \n\n(a) The first reading, which claims that we owe this kind of\nrecognition to all subjects as equally entitled, allows only for a\ncontext-sensitive form of respect. By pointing to differences\ndisregarded so far one hopes to show that the allegedly\n“neutral” state (or society) is by no means neutral, but\nrather based on a partial (for example, male-dominated, white,\nheterosexual) interpretation of citizenship or just on an arbitrary\nprivileging of specific groups. Hereby all members are discriminated\nwho do not fit the hegemonic understanding (already Taylor 1992, 42).\nIf one tries to cancel out these disadvantages by taking into account\nthe differences, e.g., by means of affirmative action intended to\nremove injustices, this serves the higher-ranking goal of treating\npersons in all their particularity as of equal status (Benhabib 1992).\nIn order to arrive at such context-sensitive laws and regulations one\nhas to more fully include the affected groups into the process of\ndemocratic decision-making, for example, through a vitalized public\nsphere and formal hearings (Habermas 1994). Additionally, it has been\nproposed that (formerly) oppressed groups should have a veto right with\nregard to all those questions that particularly affect them (Young\n1990, 183–191). \n\n(b) In contrast, the second reading claims that we should value\nparticularity in itself. Such a politics of difference is not\nconcerned with (context-sensitive) respect, but with the esteem for\nspecific characteristics or entire identities of individuals and—often enough—groups. \n\nHowever, the idea of group identities has been hotly contested:\nWhereas some groups indeed want to (re)affirm their particular\nidentity, the criticism has been voiced that such a homogenous reading\nof identity fails to take proper account of intersecting axes of\nidentification (being a black, lesbian woman, for instance). The\nfailure to admit of such heterogeneity has been suspected of\nlegitimizing internal oppression within minority groups. According to some\nscholars, all identities have to be deconstructed. Again others have\nheld onto the idea of group identities for political reasons (demanding\nsecure exit-options for individual members) or have favored rainbow\ncoalitions. In this context, it is also controversial whether cultures\nshould be valued in themselves or only in their value for individuals\nand whether such cultural protection necessitates group rights (Kymlicka 1989, Taylor\n1992, Habermas 1994, Laden/Owen 2007, Patten 2014). Finally, there\nseems to be an aporia as the alleged solution to equally value and\npromote all cultures may be no solution at all: Arguably, to esteem\nsomething without accurate knowledge or against one’s own\nconvictions is no real esteem but rather manifests an additional\ninsult. Therefore, Taylor urges us to be “merely” maximally\nopen towards the alien culture and to be led by the principle that\ntraditions with a long history most certainly contain something\nvaluable (Taylor 1992, 68–71). \n\nThere is another group of scholars which has argued that esteem\nshould not be awarded to groups but to individuals—and not for\nthe latter’s wholesale identities but only for specific features.\nYet, in light of the value pluralism so characteristic of modern\nsocieties, it remains unclear who could function as an impartial judge\nwhen it comes to determining what is (more) valuable and what is not.\nEvery decision seems to run the danger of merely expressing a\nrepressive majority opinion. Therefore, according to some accounts,\nesteem should play no role in public politics whatsoever: it is\nsufficient for individuals to be respected by all and to be esteemed by\nonly some significant others, for example, by their family, friends or\nfellow members of voluntary associations (Rawls 1971, § 67;\nHabermas 1994, 129). \n\nYet, an opposing camp claims that simply neglecting the\ndimension of esteem does not do justice to our everyday experiences: We\nare not only injured by humiliating behavior, but also if strangers\ninsult us (either in the sense of not recognizing specific\nfeatures of ourselves or actively devaluing them). After all, we have a\nneed to be esteemed by society “as such” in order to be\nable to appear in public without shame. Bourdieu’s social theory,\nfor example, points to the pervasiveness of evaluative patterns and\ndistinctions even in modern society, determining social status and\nclass (Bourdieu 1984). In order to solve the dilemma of having to\ncreate an impartial value horizon for modern societies, in recent years\nsome authors have proposed to focus on the notion of\n“achievement.” The latter is supposed to be a sufficiently\nformal reference point for esteeming persons. “Achievement”\nis not only of great significance within capitalistic societies but\nremains open for historically and interculturally different ideas of\nwhat kind of achievement should count as relevant (Honneth 1992, 126;\n2003a, 140–142; Margalit 1996, 46–47). It is supposed to allow for\nindividual particularity (one’s own achievement) but still to retain\na common reference point (the contribution to the common good, however\nthat may be defined). From this perspective, mass unemployment, for\ninstance, is a social pathology because it denies this form of esteem\nto large parts of the population. This could only be counteracted by\nacknowledging activities outside of the labor market as achievements so\nthat every citizen has the chance to see herself as a person who\ncontributes to the flourishing of her society. Additionally, it\nconstitutes an injustice if activities are devalued for arbitrary\nreasons (e.g., if specific jobs lose their status just because the\nratio of women holding them increases, see Honneth 2003a, 153, or if\nwomen earn less than men for doing the same job). \n\nTwo sorts of arguments have been leveled against this idea of\nfocusing on achievement. First, some have argued that it is impossible\nto find culturally neutral criteria of merit (Young 1990, 200–206). For instance, the market is not interested so much in capacities or skills, but merely in outputs demanded by others regardless of the skills involved (see Schmidt am Busch 2011, 46–47). But some will argue that the market is thus not tracking the relevant feature. If it is true that the very definition of achievement or merit will remain essentially contested, the problem that was supposed to be solved only\nreappears again: we can only expect such recognition from those who\nshare with us the same standards of achievement. \nSecond, even if the citizenry could come up with a convincing standard,\nthere remains a “recognition gap”: not all, perhaps not\neven the central features that render us valuable in our own eyes can\nbe understood as “achievements” in the sense of\ncontributing to the common good (Iser 2008, 193). \n\nNonetheless, by highlighting the human dependency on evaluative\nhorizons of esteem, many theories of recognition share important\ncharacteristics with communitarian approaches. The idea of a common,\nmore substantial “ethical life” is especially important for\nthose who think that we can only flourish if we live in\nmeaning-bestowing relationships of mutual recognition. In such\nrelationships people are supposed to experience the needs, desires and\ngoals of their alter ego not so much as limitations but rather as\nfurtherances of their own “social” freedom (in this vein\nTaylor 1992, 33–34; Neuhouser 2000, esp. ch. 1; Pippin 2008, ch. 7;\nHonneth 2014, chs. 3 and 6, Honneth 2015, esp. ch. I). The individual can only experience her deeds\nas really hers in living and acting in concert with others and feeling\nat home in the society’s institutions. Here recognition is not\nonly a precondition for valuing one’s own (perhaps still\nindividual) projects but is itself an integral part of (essentially\nsocial) endeavors. According to this picture, we face a lack of freedom\nwhere such relationships of mutual recognition are not fully realized.\nThus, these accounts follow Hegel in generalizing experiences drawn\nfrom the intimate sphere of loving relationships. \n\nRelationships of loving care are deemed important within\npsychologically oriented recognition theories (Benjamin 1988, Honneth\n1992) because such emotionally fulfilling interactions are supposed to\ndisplay the first form of recognition humans experience. The\nunconditional care by a parent provides the baby with the feeling of\nsecurity and of being loved, and thus of being worthy of love. This world-\nand self-trust is taken to later enable the child to value her own\nprojects and align the role standards that grow increasingly more\ncomplicated in the course of her development and to critically question\nthem (Mead 1934, Habermas 1988). Most of those who endorse the\nrelevance of love also stress the importance of the affective\ndimension for all subsequent forms of recognition (Honneth 2014, ch. 6.1). \n\nFollowing the idea that recognition should always affirm certain\naspects of the other person, there has been some controversy about what\nexactly we recognize in other persons when we love them or regard them\nas friends. After all, we seem to embrace them in their entire (and\nchanging) personality and could not just replace them with others who\nmay have similar characteristics. Whereas some think that we still\nrespond to some valuable trait, namely the autonomous core of the loved\none’s personality (Velleman 1999, 366–374), others think that the\nrelationship itself creates a value that is worth caring for (Frankfurt\n2004). \n\nFurthermore, as love embraces the entire\npersonality of individuals it has been proposed that it is this\nexperience, anchored in early childhood, that provides subjects with a\npermanent motivational resource for demanding recognition for ever more\naspects of their identity, and thus for further moral progress. This\nmay, of course, in its extreme form of desiring to be recognized in all\none’s features by all persons be a mere utopia (along these lines\nHonneth 2002, 504). Theories such as those of Emmanuel Lévinas\n(1961, section III) or Jacques Derrida (1990, 959) depict concrete\nothers as demanding an infinite sensibility and care toward them.\nAlthough we often have to relativize these “demands” in\nlight of competing claims of others and for reasons of\noverdemandingness (Forst 2011, 36–37), these theories generally point\nto the possibility of having to redraw the boundaries between different\nspheres of recognition. This could, for example, lead to a revised\nunderstanding of solidarity being not only a task of families or close\nfriends but of entire societies, namely in the form of a welfare\nstate. \n\nAlthough politics might not be directly responsible for\nthis form of recognizing concrete individuality, there are nevertheless\nindirect possibilities to protect and to shape its basic conditions. By\nmeans of effective law enforcement politics assures the individual that\nthe trust (in one’s environment as well as one’s own body),\nacquired in intimate relations since childhood (see Taylor 1992, 36–37),\nis not forcibly destroyed from the outside, e.g., by maltreatment,\ntorture or rape (some, as Owen 2007, 308, even mention natural\ndisasters although these catastrophes do not damage interpersonal\ntrust). Additionally, some of the social conditions that make it more\nchallenging to succeed in intimate relations can be improved\npolitically. This is, for example, valid for inflexible or very long\nworking hours for parents and bad child care offers, for demands of\nhigh mobility which endanger intimate relationships, or for the\ncultural patterns that devalue reciprocity between partners, e.g., by\nfavoring negligence and recklessness as “masculine.” \n\nDespite the differentiation of these four dimensions of recognition,\nin the middle of the 1990s, Nancy Fraser (but also Rorty 1999) voiced\nthe concern that, at least in the political context of the US, the\nincreasingly influential “identity politics” threatened to\nreplace the issue of redistribution on the political agenda. She\ninsisted—against Taylor and Honneth—that only\nrecognition and redistribution taken together would allow for\nthe right kind of justice, namely the ideal of “participatory\nparity” that guarantees each subject an equal participation in\npublic life. While redistribution secures the objective condition of\nsuch an ideal, recognition safeguards its intersubjective condition\n(Fraser 2003a, 36). Fraser tries to illustrate the independency of\nrecognition and redistribution by way of two examples: Whereas homosexuals\nsuffer primarily from culturally discriminating practices of\nhumiliation, workers are first and foremost the victims of economic\nexploitation. Though homosexuals also have to struggle with economic\ndisadvantages and the achievements of the workers have been\nideologically demeaned as less valuable, the real cause of the\ninjustice in the former case lies within the cultural sphere whereas in\nthe latter it lies within the economic sphere (Fraser 1996, ch. 1;\n2003a, 50–54). Thus, Fraser categorizes different forms of injustice\naccording to their socioeconomic roots. Her main point is, nonetheless,\nthat in most cases of injustice we are dealing with a combination of\ncultural disrespect and economic exploitation. As especially fitting\nexamples Fraser refers to groups categorized along the lines of gender\nor race. Thus, women and people of different color suffer not only\nfrom a discriminating status order, but also from an economy which is\nbased on encoding unpaid housework and badly paid labor as female as\nwell as auxiliary and superfluous work as colored. Only a\ntwo-dimensional theory such as the one she suggests can—according to Fraser—pay proper attention to practical conflicts\nbetween policies of redistribution and recognition. On the one hand, if\none redistributes without considering the relations of recognition\ninvolved, the receivers might be stigmatized as “social\nparasites,” and thus disrespected. On the other hand, generally\nlegitimate policies of recognition may lead to normatively undesirable\nside-effects by dramatically worsening the economic position of the\naffected persons, as measures against reification through prostitution\nand pornography might very well do when they render those engaged in\nthese lines of work unemployed (Fraser 2003a, 65; see for a thorough\ndiscussion the contributions in Olsen 2008). \n\nIn light of this criticism, Axel Honneth has insisted that the\nconcept of recognition can be applied to questions of distributive\njustice, but that it is important to properly differentiate between the\ndimensions of respect and esteem: First, our understanding of what we\nowe to others on account of their equal status as autonomous persons\nhas itself been historically extended and now entails social rights.\nAccordingly, the affected persons can at least claim qua equal\ncitizens—and thus in the name of a politics of respect—that amount of basic goods that is necessary for enabling them to\neffectively use their legal entitlements. Secondly, they can refer to\nthe criterion of achievement which is supposed to be constitutive of\ncapitalism—as an (also) cultural entity—in order to\ndemand a more adequate remuneration of their work (Honneth 2003a,\n151–154; see 2.3 above). Only if one understands redistribution in this\nway, that is, as a problem of recognition, can one—according to\nHonneth—explain why the affected experience outrage: namely\nbecause they deem their identity to be threatened by a perceived\ninjustice. What counts as an injustice, therefore, depends on our\nreasonable expectations of recognition: Justice and recognition\nmutually illuminate each other. \n\nHowever, Fraser has responded by arguing that most problems\nassociated with global injustice are not primarily due to\nmisrecognition but rather stem from systemic features of capitalism,\nsuch as when multinational enterprises relocate factories and lay off\nworkers in order to maximize profits and share-holder interests (Fraser\n2003b, 214–215, see for Honneth’s reply Honneth 2003b, 248–249). Subsequently, there has been quite some debate with\nregard to what extent and how fruitfully global capitalism can be\nexplained and criticized in terms of recognition—and what role\nfunctional imperatives play within such an account (see, for example,\nthe contributions in Schmidt am Busch/Zurn 2010, 241–318, Honneth 2014, ch. 6.2, Honneth 2015, ch. III, Jütten 2015). \n\nStruggles for recognition are supposed to effect moral progress toward ever more\njust or fulfilling relations of recognition. Sometimes such struggles are fought by violent\nmeans, which raises challenging questions of when such revolutions might be justifiable (Iser 2017, Bazargan 2018) and who can be targeted. But much more frequently, such struggles proceed in non-violent forms. Just think of the civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King in the US or the Indian liberation movement under Mahatma\nGandhi. Therefore, some authors,\nespecially those interested in social criticism, have proposed to use\nrecognition as a new paradigm for Critical Theory (Honneth 1992, see\nalso Iser 2008, Deranty 2009, Zurn 2015). Such a “critical theory of\nrecognition” is supposed to evaluate whether societies provide\ntheir citizens with the necessary “primary good” of social\nrecognition. \n\nBecause some theories of recognition are not only concerned with\nquestions of justice but also with a formal theory of the good life\ndesigned to illuminate the social conditions of individual flourishing\n(or negatively, of social pathologies) this has sparked the critique\nthat such approaches are too “sectarian” (Fraser 2003a, 30;\nsimilar Zurn 2000, 121): Any reference to the telos of a good\nlife (or the specific idea of individuality or authenticity) proves to\nbe a non-starter (or just eurocentric). In reply, proponents of such a\nbroader account of social philosophy have insisted that the emphasis on\na society that recognizes as many features of individuals as possible,\nhereby promoting their autonomy, does not prescribe how to live. It\nonly spells out the intersubjective conditions which provide everybody\nwith the chance to live the life they want to lead (be it autonomously\nchosen or not), namely in a social environment where this life is\neither adequately recognized or at least not looked upon derogatively\n(Honneth 2003a, 177). \n\nSome authors have emphasized that speaking of recognition as a vital\nhuman need cannot mean that every struggle for recognition is (equally)\njustified (Alexander/Pia Lara 1996). We still require criteria to\ndistinguish between legitimate and illegitimate struggles. Certainly,\nthose who fight for more recognition think that they deserve it. But\nobviously their belief can be false if the claims are unjustified or\nexaggerated. As all instances of legitimate criticism remind us:\nNeither every negative description of a person(’s self-image) nor\nevery challenge of her current status position—as hurtful as\nsuch “challenges” might be for the affected person—is necessarily a form of misrecognition. Quite to the contrary, only by\nbeing subject to well-meaning criticism can we improve ourselves. \n\nTherefore, those who defend a primarily normative account of\nrecognition (and humiliation) distance themselves from what they\nperceive as the problems of overly psychological approaches. On the one\nhand, they claim, due to adapted preferences persons might not even\n(emotionally) register when they are in fact treated disrespectfully.\nOn the other hand, persons might feel slighted because they hold\nutterly unreasonable views in the first place, e.g., if Nazis think\nthat they ought to be treated as super-humans or if a mediocre painter\nexpects others to view him as a genius (Margalit 1996, 9; Fraser 2003a,\n37–42; Iser 2008, 216–221). \n\nBut how do we come by the normative criteria of adequate\nrecognition? Whereas Kantian contractualists ask themselves which\nstandards are acceptable to all (in a hypothetical choice situation),\nmost theorists of recognition follow a more Hegelian route. They argue\nthat the social practices of recognition in which subjects live already\nprovide them with all the normative resources needed to criticize and\ntranscend these practices. Thus, Hegelian theories of recognition in\nall their variations choose an interpretative or—perhaps more\nadequately—reconstructive path: Because we are socialized into\na specific recognition order we also internalize (via the exchange with\nand through the “view” of others) a given space of\n(historical) reasons that shapes our practical identity and our\nnormative expectations springing from this identity. This is also\nsupposed to explain the close connection between the normative and the\npsychological dimension of recognition: On account of our\nintersubjectively acquired identity we have a psychological need to be\nrecognized as having the normative status we deem to deserve.\nConsequently, because it is a normatively structured need to the\ndisappointment of which we usually react with indignation, its\nappropriateness can always be questioned by reference to the reasons\navailable to us (Iser 2008, 173). \n\nOne way to make progress then is to criticize problematic ways of\nthinking of and relating to others’ characteristics by pointing\nto already established principles of recognition. This would, for\nexample, entail arguing for women’s rights on the basis of the\nidea of equal dignity of all “men” or for higher wages for\nworkers by reference to already established notions of desert. Thus,\nit is always possible to bring to bear aspects which were disregarded\nup to now by referring to the “surplus validity” of an\nalready established abstract principle of recognition (Honneth 2003a,\n186).  According to this view, moral progress takes place by way of a\nlaborious sorting out of reasons that are shown to be implausible.\nHowever, this still leaves open the question of how radical such a\ncritique can be, i.e., whether it can only proceed in a\ncontext-dependent and piecemeal way or whether the very logic of\nrecognition provides us with more abstract criteria of progress, such\nas egalitarian inclusion and the recognition of ever more aspects of\nindividuals that fosters their autonomy (Honneth 2003a,\n184–185). \n\nSometimes such critical reflections on one’s society are\ntriggered by emotional impulses. Thus, the psychoanalytic tradition\nrefers to suppressed, but unconsciously still effective drives or\nexperiences. These approaches always search, albeit in a speculative\nmanner, for a motive people may have to transcend the given recognition\norder. These drives or experiences may be described, following Freud,\nas libidinous energies or rather as the positively connotated\nrecollection of a state of infant omnipotence (Whitebook 1996). In\nrecent times, object relations theory has been used to highlight the\ntraumatically experienced end of an original symbiosis (between a baby\nand her primary care-giver) which we supposedly strive to regain\nthroughout our entire life (Benjamin 1988). \n\nBut regardless of the way subjects reach the conviction that they\nmust claim recognition for new, so far neglected or—even worse—demeaned aspects of their identity, the following question must\nbe asked: From where do they gain the mental strength to at least\ntemporarily withstand the disrespect or indifference of (at least many\nof) their surrounding others? The assumption that without recognition\nby all others it is inevitable that we suffer psychological breakdown\nis much too strong. In spite of disrespect, the capacity for\nagency which is necessary for resistance may spring from three\nmotivational sources. First, the oppressed subjects can, under certain\ncircumstances, still draw upon the assurance that they acquired in a\n(more or less) happy childhood. Secondly, social movements of\nresistance often create enough motivational energy by recognizing each\nother within these movements, e.g., within the civil rights movement.\nAs a consequence, the disrespect shown by the rest of society at least\nweighs less heavily. Finally, the idea that members of a better society\nin the future, though merely imagined, would one day grant the desired\nrecognition, might function as a third source of the mental strength\nneeded to endure (Mead 1934, 199). \n\nSome authors are not very optimistic about the prospects of\nemancipation through struggles of recognition.  If our expectations of\nbeing recognized as X are always contingent upon the social and\nhistorical context we live in, how is moral and political progress\npossible at all? Is it—in view of our basic dependency on the\nview of others—not more likely that our striving for\nrecognition leads to uncritical conformity instead of an emancipatory\nstruggle for recognition? It is just this suspicion which is expressed\nby the French Marxist Louis Althusser. He regards recognition\nas the central ideological mechanism by which the state\nconfronts its citizens with the choice between obedience and the loss\nof social existence (Althusser 1970, 174–176). Hereby, Althusser\nfollows a specifically French tradition that does not primarily\nconceptualize recognition as the condition of intersubjective freedom,\nbut as a source of estrangement: Already in\nRousseau’s Second Discourse on Inequality (Rousseau\n1755) individuals lose themselves in vain pretense, because they\ninauthentically attempt to please others (for a more positive reading\nsee Neuhouser 2008).  Finally, in the work of Jean-Paul Sartre\nindividuals are reified by every kind of recognition because even the\naffirmation of others freezes the subjects in their present state,\nhereby denying their potential for change, i.e., their freedom (Sartre\n1943, esp. 347–361).  According to this tradition, we do not suffer\nprimarily from the fact that we are not recognized, but rather from\nthe fact that we are held captive within a specific pattern of\nsocially mandated recognition (Bedorf 2010). Struggles for recognition\nonly entangle us ever deeper in a wrong dependency on power relations\nthe workings of which we fail to adequately grasp. Whereas\nleft-Hegelian approaches are designed to positively overcome\nideological recognition orders for the purposes of social progress\n(Honneth 2004), post-structuralists maintain that one should not ask\nwhich features of one’s identity should be recognized. In doing\nso we only remain caught within the old (ideological) categories and\nare forced to define clear-cut identities.  Rather, one should\nquestion struggles for recognition as to whether and to what extent\nthey increase spaces of freedom to think and act differently (Tully\n2000, 469). Such work, often inspired by Michel Foucault, has also\npointed to the motivational problem of all resistance to the\nestablished recognition order: How can you reject exactly those\ncategories that constitute your identity? Does social criticism not\nnecessary imply self-denial? Judith Butler has tried to circumvent\nthis alleged paradox by pointing out that norms never remain valid by\nthemselves but need constant reaffirmation. This process hereby opens\nup possibilities of—at least slightly—“reconfiguring” the dominant norms and changing\none’s own identity (Butler 1997a, ch. 3; 1997b, 13, 40–41). Some\nauthors even want to replace a politics of recognition with a politics\nof acknowledgment: an acknowledgment that we can never be sure about\nthe changing identities (and thus normative claims) of others but have\nto remain open to new and unpredictable developments (Markell 2003,\n180).  In a similar vein, feminist thinkers have claimed that the\nentire idea of being recognized in one’s given identity makes it\nimpossible for us to gain an adequate understanding of how power and\nagency not simply react to such an identity but rather create it as an\n“embodied” identity in the first place (McNay 2008, 162–197). Finally, the idea that struggles for recognition cannot only lead to further progress, but should be grounded in a belief that modernity is already the result of such progress, has been criticized for its affinity to colonial forms of thought (Allen 2016, cf. Forst 2019). \n\nEven those who think that one can—at least conceptually—conceive of non-ideological forms of recognition have started\nto pay more attention to the ways in which relationships of recognition\nare always also relationships of power (see the contributions in van\nden Brink/Owen 2007). This becomes especially urgent if one realizes,\nas already indicated above, that values and norms—being\nproducts of human thought and attitudes—can express disrespect\neven if those who follow them are not really aware of this. Subjects\nmay attempt to convey recognition within a framework that is itself\ndisrespectful. For example, a lord in the 18th century who\ntreated his maid according to the accepted norms of that time—for example, by treating her as if she was invisible—may not\nhave (intentionally) disrespected her with regard to the socially valid\nsystem of norms and values. Thus, he might have been considered a\n“decent” lord according to prevailing standards (whereas\nother lords might have been described as “cruel”, etc.).\nHowever, at least some probably want to say that this lord—in\nanother sense—did not adequately respect his maid (and that\ntherefore the social changes since then manifest moral progress).\nNonetheless, some authors regard even ideological recognition (as\nbeing, for example, a dutiful maid) as something positive insofar as it\nstrengthens the subject’s sense of worth and is clearly superior\nto acts of misrecognition (Honneth 2004, 323–347). Yet, others may\nmourn such ideological recognition for the incapacitating effects on\nthe recognized subjects’ will to resist. Recently, these controversies have been taken up in a fruitful dialogue between these two traditions (Bankovsky/Le Goff 2013, Honneth/Rancière 2017, Honneth 2018, esp. 211–235). \n\nHowever, even if attitudes and acts of recognition are a much more\nambivalent blessing than might have been presumed at first sight,\nrecognition theory does not only illuminate the complexity of our\nnormative thinking but also provides a strong argument that such\nnormative considerations are an ineradicable part of our social world.\nThe concept of recognition therefore also serves an important\nexplanatory function.","contact.mail":"iser@binghamton.edu","contact.domain":"binghamton.edu"}]
