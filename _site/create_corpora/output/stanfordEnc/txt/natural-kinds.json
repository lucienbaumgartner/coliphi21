To say that a kind\nis natural is to say that it corresponds to a grouping that\nreflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests\nand actions of human beings. We tend to assume that science is often\nsuccessful in revealing these kinds; it is a corollary of scientific\nrealism that when all goes well the classifications and taxonomies\nemployed by science correspond to the real kinds in nature. The\nexistence of these real and independent kinds of things is held to\njustify our scientific inferences and practices.\n\n\n\nPutative examples of kinds may be found in all scientific disciplines.\nChemistry provides what are taken by many to be the paradigm examples\nof kinds, the chemical elements, while chemical compounds, such as\nH2O, are also natural kinds of stuff. (Instances of a\nnatural kind may be man-made, such as artificially synthesized\nascorbic acid, i.e., vitamin C; but whether chemical kinds all of\nwhose instances are artificial are natural kinds is open to debate.\nThe synthetic transuranium elements, e.g. Rutherfordium, seem good\ncandidates for natural kinds, whereas artificial chemical kinds, such\nas the entirely synthetic compound bismuth germanate,\nBi4Ge3OO12, which is used in particle\ndetectors, are, arguably, less obviously natural kinds.) The standard\nmodel in quantum physics reveals many kinds of fundamental particles\n(electron, tau neutrino, charm quark), plus broader categories such as\nkinds of kind (lepton, quark) and higher kinds (fermion,\nboson). Astronomy classifies the heavenly bodies: galaxies, for\nexample, can be either elliptical, lenticular, or spiral.\n\n\n\nSince kinds are revealed by science, a science can revise which kinds\nit holds exist: phlogisticated air was regarded as a kind until after\nLavoisier's chemical revolution. A science can even question a whole\ncategory of kinds. Before being superseded in this regard by the\nchemical elements, biological species were taken to be the best\nexemplars of kindhood. Yet now it is somewhat controversial to state\nthat species are natural kinds.  As the world changes, its kinds may\nchange too.  Rapidly mutating micro-organisms demand new\nclassification systems.  Kinds in the social sciences, such as\neconomics or sociology, are even more problematic, since the changing\nnorms and practices of individuals and societies may also be held to\nbe constitutive factors in kind membership, and these norms and\npractices may themselves respond to our classification of people into\nkinds. These examples are troublesome because there is\nsome tension between the existence of kinds and the mutability of the\nparticulars which are supposed to fall under those kinds. In the case\nof atoms or galaxies, the particulars under study are typically\nlong-lived and only slowly changing; viruses and economic structures,\non the other hand, are more dynamic.\n\n\n\nThis article divides philosophical discussions of natural kinds into\nthree areas: metaphysics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of\nlanguage. The metaphysics of natural kinds asks whether we should\nthink of our supposed natural kinds as genuinely natural.  And if they\nare, what are natural kinds?  And, finally, do natural kinds\nhave essences?  Philosophy of science is concerned with natural kinds\nbecause, as mentioned above, it is the use of natural kinds by the\nindividual (‘special’) sciences that generates our interest in them.\nSo we may ask, whether the kinds appearing in our best scientific\ntheories do indeed satisfy the theories of natural kinds proposed by\nthe metaphysicians.  Philosophy of language takes an interest in\nnatural kinds because basic issues are raised by the semantics of\nnatural kind terms.  For example, if we think of naming an entity and\ndescribing it as, semantically speaking, fundamentally different ways\nof talking about it, should we think of natural kind terms as\nfunctioning like names or like descriptions?\n\n\n\nThe principal metaphysical questions concerning natural kinds are\nthreefold. First, are the kinds that we think of as\n‘natural’ kinds genuinely natural?  Or are our\nclassification processes more anthropocentric than that? Secondly,\nwhat are natural kinds? Are natural kinds any sort of entity at all?\nAre they basic ontological entities or are they derived from or\nreducible to other entities (e.g., universals)?  Thirdly, do natural\nkinds have essences? As regards the first question, the general\nproblem is to determine which of the kinds to which science makes\nappeal, if any, correspond to real natural kinds—those existing\nin nature, so to speak—and which of these kinds are merely\nconventional—those whose boundaries are fixed by us rather than\nnature.  Then, if natural kinds are genuinely natural, what are they?\nAre there entities that are the natural kinds, and if so what can we\nsay about the nature of such entities? Are they irreducible,\nbasic, sui generis entities (alongside, for example,\nparticulars and universals) (Ellis 2001; Lowe 1998)? Or can they be\nreduced, say to universals (Armstrong 1978, 1997; Hawley and Bird\n2011) or to clusters of properties (Boyd 1991, Millikan 1999)? The\nthird question asks whether there are properties that might be\nessential for kind membership. Natural kind essentialists hold that\nnatural kinds have essences (Ellis 2001, 2002; Devitt 2008), where the\nessence of a natural kind is a property or set of properties whose\npossession is a necessary and sufficient condition for a particular's\nbeing a member of the kind. That fact is a so-called essential fact\nconcerning the kind; it is a fact that, in Fine's terms, stems from\nthe identity or nature of the kind (Fine 1994).\n\n \n\nA common view concerning our so-called natural kind classifications is\nthat there are genuinely natural ways of classifying things.\nIntuitively, to group all instances of the metal zinc together is to\nengage in a natural classification, whereas to group together Trajan's\ncolumn, the number two, and Julius Caesar is to classify things in an\narbitrary manner. The classifications ‘cars manufactured in\nGermany’, ‘culinary vegetables’,\n‘altars’ are not arbitrary, but neither are they natural,\nsince they reflect human interests. This view we call\nnaturalism. It is often called realism because of\nthe close affinity to scientific realism; indeed naturalism may be\nregarded as a consequence or component of standard scientific\nrealism. Scientific realists hold that successful scientific theories\nrepresent theory-independent phenomena. Thus the theoretical posits of\nscience reflect natural divisions in nature; for example, the periodic\nsystem for classifying the chemical elements reflects natural\ndivisions between the elements. However, since ‘realism’\nis also associated with ontological doctrines (e.g., realism about\nuniversals, modal realism etc.) it would be preferable to use weak\nrealism (or, as above, naturalism) to label the\nontologically uncommitted view that our classifications are often\nnatural.  (We will note below that not all natural classifications are\nclassifications into natural kinds.) \n\nNaturalism need not maintain that all the classifications we in fact\ntake to be natural are indeed natural. Sometimes scientists and others\nerr in the natural kinds they take to exist. There is no kind that is\nphlogiston or phlogisticated air. Many might suppose jade to be a\nnatural kind of mineral, but it is not because there are two distinct\nminerals called ‘jade’. (See LaPorte 2004, 94–100 and Hacking 2007b\nfor detailed discussions of jade.) Similarly, biologists now believe that\nreptiles do not form a natural kind. Naturalism is the view that\nthere are in fact natural divisions among things, so that when we\nattempt to make a natural classification, there is a fact of the\nmatter as to whether that classification is indeed genuinely\nnatural. \n\nAssuming that one is a naturalist about (some of) our classifications,\nwhat makes a classification into one of natural kinds? The following\nare often suggested criteria or characteristics of a natural kind\nclassification (some of which are more contentious than others): \n\nNaturalism about natural kind classifications contrasts with\nconventionalism (also called constructivism or\nconstructionism), the view natural kinds don't exist\nindependently of the scientists and others who talk about them. John\nStuart Mill puts articulates the contrast thus: “In so far as a\nnatural classification is grounded on real kinds, its groups are\ncertainly not conventional; it is perfectly true that they do not\ndepend upon an arbitrary choice of the naturalist” (Mill 1884,\nbk. IV, ch. II). While the sciences do, it appears, employ\nclassifications according to kinds, the conventionalist will maintain\nthat the purposes of scientists are just one species of interest among\nmany: others will include the interests of automobile enthusiasts, of\ncooks, and of religious people or sociologists of\nreligion. Conventionalists (constructivists, constructionists) deny\nthat any of our classifications, including those of science, are\nnaturally privileged forms of classification. The classifications of\nbotanists do not carve nature at its joints any more than the\nclassifications of cooks. \n\nWe may distinguish between weak conventionalism and strong\nconventionalism. Weak conventionalism asserts that our actual\nclassifications are not, or are very unlikely to be, natural. The\nprincipal ground for weak conventionalism is scepticism about the\nability of science to uncover the natural principles of\nclassification. We may attribute this reason for conventionalism to\nLocke. (Locke, 1690: III). It appears (although this is a matter of\ndebate) that Locke thought that if there were real essences of\nspecies, these would be found in the shared imperceptible\nmicro-structural properties of things, and that there may be such\ngenuinely natural species but that science was ill-equipped to do\nbetter than speculate about them. (Locke also held, employing\ncriterion 6 above, that there would be ‘gaps’ or\n‘chasms’ between genuine species but that observation\nshowed only smooth gradations between the kinds we actually employ,\nwhich therefore must be conventional.)  Strong conventionalism, however, goes on to deny even that\nconventionalism is forced upon us simply by ignorance. It denies that\nthere are any such natural divisions, known or unknown. Strong\nconventionalists claim that the differences and similarities that we\nattribute to things exist in virtue of, for example, the social\nfunction of the relevant concepts rather than in natural facts.  For\nexample, difference in gender is not a biological difference but a\ndifference in social role. The conventionalist treats natural kinds in\nthe same way. The chemical elements, biological species, quarks,\nneutrinos and bosons are equally constructed by the activity of\nscientists. The key claim is that natural kinds are constructed rather\nthan discovered. As Woolgar claims “there is no object beyond\ndiscourse” (1988, 73). Hacking (1999) argues against the strong version of conventionalism\n(which he terms ‘universal constructivism’). The point of social\nconstructivism is to reveal that some of our classificatory categories\nand practices though they may appear inevitable are actually\ncontingent and relative to the practice of classification in the\ncontext of social institutions and norms. However, according to\nHacking, some constructed categories reflect real divisions and so\nwe need not be constructivists in the strong sense. There is still\nroom to distinguish between constructed kinds that reflect real\ncategories and those that do not. For example, Hacking (1999, Ch. 5) distinguishes between\n‘child abuse’ and ‘satanic ritual abuse’.  Satanic\nritual abuse is a socially constructed idea, but not a social kind. In\nthe 1990s, there was an exhaustive investigation into satanic ritual\nabuse in Great Britain after a number of reported cases. However, an\nindependent commission claimed that none of the charges were\nsubstantiated by evidence. Thus, our constructed categories are\nsubject to empirical investigation. We must establish a referent class\nfor our constructed categories. For example and in contrast, a kind\nsuch as child abuse is considered real. The emergence of the category can\nbe traced to a definite time (1961) at a definite place (Denver) in\nthe discussions of paediatricians. Moreover, the reference of the\ncategory was abused children. This reference dynamically changed as\nthe idea became embedded in new legislation, incorporated in practices\ninvolving social workers, police, schoolteachers etc. (See Hacking\n1999, Ch. 5.) But, importantly real instances of the category were\nfound through empirical investigation.  \n\nThe chief claim made by all varieties of conventionalism is that facts\nabout the world are in some sense dependent on human beings, their concepts and\ntheir activities in society. The negation of this view, which we will examine\nin\n Section 1.3, is the claim that facts about the\nworld are independent of human beings, their concepts and their\nactivities, that is, that there are real independent natural kinds in\nthe world. The claim that scientific facts about the world\nare dependent on human activity has been analysed in\ndifferent ways by constructivists. Kukla (2000, Ch. 3) distinguishes\n(i) material, (ii) causal, and (iii) constitutive dependence. The\nfirst, and weakest, claim is material dependence, namely that\nscientific entities are constructed by the activities of scientists in\nthe laboratory. Chemical reactions are brought about by scientists in\nthe laboratory using purified chemicals in a controlled environment\n(Knorr-Cetina et al. 1983). The resultant kinds are merely the\nconstructs of this highly artificial environment, along with the\npragmatic interests of the scientists (i.e., what they are\ntesting for and the methodology they choose to use). However, it is\nclear that scientists still abstract from a complex reality and in\nsome circumstances the materials used are purifications of some\nnaturally occurring materials. Indeed, material dependence is a rather\nweak kind of conventionalism and could even be made compatible with\nsome versions of naturalism/realism (cf. Hacking 1983). Therefore, no general\nconclusion may be drawn about the natural world and its kinds, from\nthe fact that scientists study scientific kinds in a highly idealized\nand controlled setting. The second element in Kukla's three-fold\ndistinction is causal dependence, which occurs when the relevant facts\nare caused to be true by the fact that they are believed to be true\n(e.g. belief that there will be a run on the bank can cause a run on\nthe bank, Merton 1948).  Hacking's (1995) human, interactive kinds,\nsuch as person with multiple-personality disorder, may be regarded as\ninstances, where the kind and its members are brought into existence\nby the belief that there are such kinds and people do belong to\nthem. Lastly, the constitutive dependence thesis claims that\nconvention is constitutive of the physical facts. Plausibly,\nconventions exist in virtue of people holding that they do. Woolgar's\nconstructivism is of the type that treats all scientific facts like\nconventions in this respect.   \n\nDupré (1993) argues for promiscuous realism, the\nclaim that there are countless ways of taxonomizing the worlds into\nkinds. The structure of the world is vastly complex and can be\ncategorized in many different cross-cutting ways, according to the\ndifferent theoretical interests we happen to be pursuing. Nevertheless,\nDupré insists that his view is not conventionalist, but rather that he\nis committed to naturalism and realism about natural kinds. He accepts\nthat there are properties that natural kinds have in common, but denies\nthat these are intrinsic properties of kinds\n (cf. criterion 1 above).\n He also denies that there is a hierarchical\nstructure of natural kinds in the world\n (cf. criterion 5 above)\n and that kinds are categorically distinct \n (cf. criterion 6 above). \n\nDupré (1993, 28) argues that promiscuous realism about natural\nkinds reflects our classificatory practices within the context of both\ncommon sense and particular sciences. The kinds classified by common\nsense and scientific practice often cross one another. For example, in\ncommon sense we classify lilies as a certain kind of\nflower. However, in biological classification the genus\nLilium comprises over one hundred species, including bulbs such as\ngarlic and onions. Moreover, species with the name “lily”\nin common sense do not in fact belong to the lilium genus\nin biological classification (e.g., Calla Lilies and Canna Lilies). \nTherefore, common sense and biological science provide us\nwith pluralistic ways of taxonomizing lilies. Each is equally\nlegitimate, according to Dupré, depending on our interests. \nFurthermore, Dupré (1993, 38) argues that cross-classification occurs \neven within the context of a science. Taking the biological classification \nof species as an example, he argues that there are countless ways of \ntaxonomizing species, depending on the model of biological systematics \nthat is used (see\n Section 2.1 below). \n There are equally legitimate, objectively grounded ways of classifying \nnatural kinds. There is accordingly no unique way of carving nature at\nits joints; different systems of classification are equally\nacceptable, scientifically and metaphysically.  Realism about natural kinds is the view that there exist entities \nthat are the natural kinds. While naturalism about natural kind \nclassifications is a matter of there being natural groupings and\ndistinctions among things and as such has no ontological commitment,\nrealism is an ontologically committed view. Since ‘(weak)\nrealism’ is sometimes used to denote naturalism, we may\ndistinguish by using the term strong realism for the\nstronger, ontological, claim that the natural divisions between kinds\nreflect the boundaries between real entities; i.e. the difference \nbetween silver and gold is not just a difference between two natural groups of \nthing, but is a difference between two distinct entities silver \nand gold. \n\nThe traditional realism versus nominalism debate is an ontological\ndebate over whether in order to account for properties we need to\ninvoke a class of entity, universals (see Section 1.2 above). There is\nan analogous debate as regards natural kinds, whether in order to\naccount for our natural kind talk and our natural classifications, we\nneed a special sort of entity in our ontology. The natural kind\nnominalist may accept that there are genuinely natural\nclassifications, but will reject the idea that we should invoke any\nobject as a consequence. For example, the nominalist might take the\nworld to be made up of individuals, which can be classified as kinds\nin a natural way. But, the nominalist claims, there is no kind of\nentity beyond the individual instances of each kind. The (strong)\nrealist maintains that we cannot explain the distinction between\nnatural and non-natural classifications without appealing to certain\nentities, the natural kinds. The naturalism versus conventionalism\ndebate discussed in the preceding section asked whether there is a\ngenuine metaphysical difference between natural classifications and\nnon-natural classifications; it is not obvious that the naturalist,\nwho maintains that there is a metaphysical difference, is obliged to\nunderstand that difference in terms of an ontological category of\nentities that are natural kinds. The analogue in the debate over\nproperties is whether there is a metaphysical distinction between\nnatural properties and non-natural properties, between, in David\nLewis's terminology, sparse and abundant properties (Lewis, 1986).\nThere is no immediate contradiction in the position of a nominalist\nwho rejects universals, but who maintains that there is a metaphysical\ndifference between natural properties and other properties. The\nrealist in both cases argues that, ultimately, naturalism (about\nproperties and about classification) requires a commitment to entities\n(universals and natural kinds respectively). \n\nQuine is an example of a philosopher who accepts, to some extent,\nnatural classifications into kinds. He holds (1969) that kinds are\nsets, so he does think that there are entities that are kinds, and to\nthat extent he is a realist. That said, his realism is minimal, since\nsets are ubiquitous entities. Any coherent classificatory\nprinciple will determine a set of things thus classified, whether\nnatural or artificial. Thus the ontology of natural kinds does not of\nitself explain there being natural kinds. Quine regards \nthe notions of  kind and similarity as \n“substantially one notion” (1969, 119) but denies that it\nis straightforward to give a definition of one in terms of the\nother. He does consider defining relative similarity thus: a\nis more similar to b than to c iff a and \nb share more properties than a and c do. \nBut this will work only if properties are less abundant than sets \nare (since any two things are jointly members of any number of sets). \nAnd Quine regards such a notion of property as no clearer than the \nnotion of kind.  \n\nQuine opens his discussion of natural kinds by asking “what\ntends to confirm an induction?” (cf.\n criterion 2)\n (1969, 114). With Goodman's new riddle of induction and Hempel's\nparadox of confirmation in mind, Quine answers that it is the\nsimilarity or sameness of kinds between instances that permits an\ninduction: two green emeralds are more similar than two grue emeralds\nwhen one of them is green and the other blue. It is the “dubious\nscientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of\nkind” (1969, 116) that prompts the discussion alluded to\nabove. An intuitive notion of similarity is used in our ordinary\ninductions. And the force of Darwinian processes gives us some reason\nto think that we have evolved an innate similarity space that\ncorresponds to some natural similarities. At the same time, natural\nscience, which developed from these primitive inductions, supported by\nsimilarities, is able to reveal deeper similarities that may\ncontradict superficial similarities. For example, our strong sense of\nsimilarity concerns things of the same colour, but science tells us\nthat there is no deep similarity among things of the same\ncolour. Quine thinks that in due course science will obviate the need\nfor a general notion of similarity or kind: in each area of science\nmore specific notions will take the place of the generic notion; this\nis a sign of the maturity of a branch of science. For example, in\nzoology we may replace talk of the similarity between two animals by\ndiscussion of the historical proximity of their closest common\nancestor. \n\nQuine's conception of natural kinds is liberal. Not all sets are\nnatural kinds, but any set whose members share a natural property are\na natural kind. So the set of white objects is at least a candidate\nnatural kind and Quine asserts that positively charged objects form a\nnatural kind. One might wonder whether an up quark, an uranium\nnucleus, a hydronium ion, a charged water droplet, and a balloon that\nhas been rubbed on someone's jumper all belong to one kind. The\nliterature on natural kinds (cf. Mill 1884) has tended to adopt a more\nrestricted conception of kinds, although articulating that conception\nis not straightforward. This question is related to the link that\nQuine draws between kinds and what it is that confirms induction. If\none adopts the narrower conception of kinds, then one will hold that a\nlaw such as ‘positively charged objects repel one another’\ndoes not concern kinds at all, but nonetheless may be confirmed by\ninstances of objects that are positively charged repelling one\nanother. So the real answer to “what tends to confirm an\ninduction?” is not “natural kinds and their\ninstances” but is “natural properties and their\ninstances”. A further reason for taking this view is that\ninductions often concern relations (such as the repulsion between two\nobjects). But we do not suppose that objects that enter into a natural\nrelation form a natural kind, nor that there is a natural kind of\nordered sequences of objects satisfying a given natural relation. \n\nFollowing Quine, some realists have expanded upon his intuition that a\nnatural kind's members share a natural property by counting \nfamilies of such properties that are contingently clustered in\nnature (Boyd 1991, 1999a; Millikan 1999). These families of properties \ncluster together over time either because the presence of some properties \nin the family favours the presence of others or because there are underlying \ninternal mechanisms and/or extrinsic contextual mechanisms which tend to \nsecure the co-occurrence of the properties. A natural kind is any such \nfamily of co-occurring properties that may be employed in inductive inference \nfor the purposes of scientific explanation. Cluster kind realists will \nreadily concede that, depending on the case, environmental pressures may \naffect and alter the set of properties associated with a kind over time. \nTherefore, in such cases, none of the properties themselves \nneed be individually necessary for kind membership. \n\nBoyd considers biological species to be paradigmatic natural kind \nclusters (1999), where the clustering is due to a \nhomeostatic mechanism. Homeostatic property clusters occur\nwhen mechanisms exist that cause the properties to cluster by ensuring\nthat deviations from the cluster have a low chance of persisting; the\npresence of some of the properties in the cluster favours the presence\nof the others. A homeostatic mechanism thereby achieves\nself-regulation, maintaining a stable range of properties. In the case\nof species, the homeostatic mechanisms may be intrinsic (e.g. gene\nexchange within a population or developmental factors) or extrinsic\n(e.g. a species's evolutionary niche provides common selective\nfactors). Since individuals inherit their basic characteristics from\ntheir parents, and very few people are taller than 2.5m, we can expect\nthe next generation to contain few people of that height. Height can,\nhowever, be affected by environmental factors; a mutation can cause\noffpring to have genes different from their parents that might cause\ngreater than usual height, and malfunctioning of the pituitary gland\ncan cause an excess of growth hormone.  So there can be individual\ncases of excessive height.  But they will remain rare because such\ngigantism and acromegaly are accompanied by serious complicating\ndisorders and often result in premature death. Consequently, these\nindividuals are less likely to reproduce than others. Even greater\nextremes of height (e.g. 4m) are just not possible, since the same\ndevelopmental factors would prevent the individual from being viable\nat an earlier stage in life.  \n\nColouration across a species is often uniform when it is a camouflage\nagainst predation. The more specific the ecological niche occupied,\nthe more uniform will colouration and other features be. Deviations\nwill lead to decreased fitness and will be selected against. Obligate\nmutualistic symbiosis often provides very specialized ecological\nniches; consequently certain key properties must be present in order\nfor an individual to survive.  Certain beard worms, such as Riftia\npachyptila, live at ocean floor thermal vents and have no\ndigestive tract; instead they supply hydrogen sulphide and methane to\nbacteria in their trophosomes, which oxidise the hydrogen sulphide and\nmethane on behalf of the worm. As a result the worm cannot lack any\nproperty essential for the survival of the bacteria to which it is\nhost.  Such homeostatic mechanisms do not preclude deviations from the\nstandard combinations of properties—mutations do occur, for\nexample. Homeostasis just means that usually such mutations will not\npersist. The rare benevolent, or even merely neutral, mutations may\npersist and flourish, in which case there will be variation and\nchange.  Environments may change, perhaps locally, also leading to\nvariation and change (e.g. the famous peppered moth). Consequently, it\nwill not always be the case that property P in a homeostatic property\ncluster F is a necessary condition of an individual belonging to the\nrelevant kind.  \n\nIn such cases, the boundaries of the natural kind are vague. \nCluster kinds nevertheless do form a kind\n (criterion 4 above).\n Members will have at least some properties in common\n (criterion 1). \n Since the emergence of cluster kinds is not entirely random and a \ncausal-historical account can be provided in virtue of stable homeostatic mechanisms, \ncluster kinds are sufficiently robust to support induction\n (criterion 2) \n and perhaps even laws of nature in some cases\n (criterion 3).\n Conversely,\nbecause the boundaries between natural kinds are vague, a cluster kind realist\nwill reject the claim that natural kinds are categorically distinct \n (criterion 6).\n She may be neutral on whether they always form hierarchies\n (criterion 5).\n That said, not all clusters need exhibit the flexibility and\nvagueness of these biological, homeostatic cases. In other cases \nthe clustering may be directly due to the laws of nature. Thus the laws\nof physics rule out fractional nuclear charge, with the consequence\nthat the chemical elements are kinds that have clearly defined\nboundaries and nuclear charge is a necessary and sufficient condition\nof kind membership. \n\nNatural kind realism may be understood as an analogue of realism about\nuniversals. A further question is whether these are simply analogues\nor in fact related positions.  Perhaps natural kinds just are (a\nspecies of) universals or are reducible to universals. Within realism,\nthat reductionist view can be contrasted with natural kind\nfundamentalism, which holds that not only are there natural\nkinds (as entities), but also that natural kinds find a basic and\nsui generis place in our ontology. We illustrate three\npositions within naturalism about natural kinds: (i) naturalism\nwithout (strong) realism; reductionist realism; fundamentalist\nrealism.   \n\nAccording to David Armstrong (1997, 67–8) “The kinds mark\ntrue joints in nature. But it is not clear that we require an\nindependent and irreducible category of universal to accommodate the\nkinds”. Armstrong's view is naturalistic, since there are\ngenuine natural divisions; but he is also resistant to realism. If\nthere were natural kinds they would be universals. But the properties\nshared by all and only the members of a kind will typically be very\ncomplex. For example, he considers whether there is some description\nof human DNA. There may be, but it would be too complex to qualify as\na genuine universal. And there is no reason to suppose that this\ncomplex universal would do any causal or nomic work. So there is not\nsimply an identity between natural kinds and a subcategory of\nuniversals, the natural kind universals (e.g., the universal of\nbeing gold, or of being a human)—according to\nArmstrong's argument there are no natural kind universals. He does\nconcede that the case is stronger for basic kind universals, such as\nelectronhood, where a few properties (the electron's mass, charge, and\nspin) are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for kind\nmembership.   \n\nHawley and Bird (2011) argue that natural kinds are complex\nuniversals.  A complex universal is a universal whose parts are\nuniversals (just as a complex particular is a particular whose parts\nare particulars). In the case of the electron the fundamental\nuniversals (the electron's mass, charge, and spin) do combine to form\na complex universal.  Since an universal is wholly located\nwhere the universal is located, every entity that instantiates\nelectronhood also instantiates its component universals, the\nelectron's mass, charge, and spin. Not every collection of universals\nconstitutes a natural kind, just as not every collection of\nparticulars constitutes a natural (complex) particular.  The facts\nthat explain the clustering of properties explain why these universals\ncompose a complex one. Not every complex universal is, like\nelectronhood, precise.  Some are vague, and this fact can accommodate\nthe indeterminacy of kind constitution implied by Boyd's view of the\nclusters in the case of biological kinds.   \n\nLike Hawley and Bird, E. J. Lowe takes natural kinds to be entities\n(1998, 2006a, and 2006b Other Internet Resources). Thus Lowe is a\nnatural kind realist.  Furthermore, he takes natural\nkinds—substantial universals in his\nterminology—to constitute an irreducible ontological category\n(one category in his four-category ontology).  Hence he is a natural\nkind fundamentalist. Lowe argues that recognizing the ontologically\nfundamental distinction between substantial universals (natural kinds)\nand non-substantial universals (properties) accounts for the laws of\nnature in a manner that, while avoiding the problems of a regularity\naccount, may nonetheless do without Armstrong's second order relation\nof necessitation, itself a relational universal (Armstrong 1983,\n75–110). Consider the law that planets travel in ellipses.\nAccording to Lowe's account, this should be understood as a matter of\nthe kind planet being characterized by the\nproperty travels in an ellipse. (One might query whether all\nlaws can be given this form and so whether the fact that some general\ntruth is a law should be explained this way. For what makes planets\ntravel in ellipses is the fact that they have mass and hence little to\ndo with their being planets. For example, Kepler's law is an\napplication of Newton's laws, but the latter concerns quantities\n(mass, distance), which should be understood as universals not\nkinds.)  As in Lowe's ontology, natural kinds play a fundamental role in\nthe ontology of Brian Ellis (2001, 2002). For Ellis the term\n‘natural kind’ covers three hierarchical categories:\nnatural kinds of objects (substantive kinds), natural kinds of\nprocesses and events (dynamic kinds), and natural kinds of properties\nand relations (property kinds). The chemical elements and compounds\nare substantive kinds; the different chemical reactions are dynamic\nkinds; a tetrahedral molecular structure is a (structural) property\nkind (whose species include the particular tetrahedral structures of\nmethane, carbon tetrachloride, silicon tetrafluoride and so forth).\nEllis is uncommitted on whether the dynamic kinds are independent of\nthe other two types of kinds; but these are independent of one\nanother. Each kind is a universal, and the three categories of kind\ntherefore form three categories of universal. Thus the substantive\nkinds—the familiar kinds of thing and stuff—are\nuniversals, but these are not reducible to property universals. Ellis\nnotes that laws of nature have a hierarchical structure: Kepler's laws\nof planetary motion are an application of Newton's laws.  He argues\n(2001, 90) that the only satisfactory account of this is fact that\nnatural kinds also exist in hierarchies.  \nDo natural kinds have essences? When discussing kinds and essences we\nneed to distinguish two quite different claims. The first claim is\nthat the kind a particular belongs to is essential to that particular:\nif a belongs to kind K, then it is an essential\nproperty of a that it belongs to K. The second claim\nis that the kinds themselves have essential properties: for each kind\nK there is some property Φ of the kind such that it is\nessential to K that Φ(K). What is the logical\nrelation between these two claims? The first claim may be strictly\nconsistent with the denial of the second, but it may be difficult to\nmotivate the first without having reason to accept the second.  Would\none think that some object's nature requires it to belong to kind K\nwithout thinking that there is some distinctive (essential) property\ncharacteristic of all Ks?  The second claim, essentialism about kinds, does not obviously\nimply the first, individual essentialism. To see this, consider the\nfollowing two cases that would seem to show that the latter does not\nimply the former. The first case is chemical/physical. A nucleus of\nneptunium-239 may undergo beta decay, in which one of its neutrons\nemits an electron leaving a proton. As a consequence the nucleus now\nhas one more proton and so is a nucleus of neptunium no longer but is\nnow a nucleus of plutonium. This description is consistent with the\nclaim that it is essential to neptunium that nuclei of neptunium atoms\nhave 93 protons whereas it is essential to plutonium that its nuclei\nhave 94 protons.  But one may also claim, as the description\nimplicitly suggests, that one and the same nucleus persists through\nthis transformation.  If that is so, then a particular has retained\nits identity while undergoing a change of kind. That kind essentialism\ndoes not entail essentialism of kind membership is also demonstrated\nby a second, biological, example. According to Mayr's biological\nspecies concept, a species is a reproductively isolated breeding\npopulation. Thus a new species can be created by the advent of\nreproductive isolation, which will typically split existing\npopulations (Matthen 2009). And so the existing organisms in at least one (and\narguably both) of the newly isolated (sub-)populations will belong to\na new species. And if species are natural kinds, this is an example of\nparticulars changing their kinds. But this account of species is\nconsistent with the view that species have essences (LaPorte 1997,\n2004, 11–12). (As a matter of fact, most essentialists accept\nthat an object's kind is essential to it. The point being advanced\nhere is that this claim does not follow immediately from the claim\nthat kinds have essences.)  It has been widely held that essentialism, and natural kind\nessentialism in particular, is a consequence of the semantic arguments\nconcerning reference put forward by Kripke (1980) and Putnam\n(1975a). These arguments support semantic externalism, the view that\nthe reference of a speaker's term can depend on facts external to the\nspeaker herself (e.g. facts concerning prior uses of the term).\nHowever, Salmon (1979, 1982) has argued persuasively that only trivial\nessentialism can be inferred from such arguments; stronger\nessentialist theses are derived only on the basis of unstated\nessentialist premises. For example, consider the following argument,\nreconstructed by Donnellan and discussed in Salmon (1982,\n161–75):  (Salmon 1982, 166) \n\nP3, however, is not free of non-trivial essentialist import.\nAccording to Salmon, deriving essentialism via the theory of reference\nis question-begging. Nonetheless, the fact that essentialist\nconclusions seem so plausible may be taken as evidence that there\nexist strong essentialist intuitions, and the arguments from Kripke\nand Putnam can be framed in non-semantic terms and thereby motivate\nessentialism directly—indeed many of Kripke's arguments\nare not framed in semantic terms at all. \n\nSeveral of Kripke's exemplary cases concern theoretical identities;\nthese are typically identities of the form C = T,\nexpressed using a common name for a kind, ‘C’,\nand a technical identification of the kind, ‘T’,\ntypically thereby telling us what that kind is. Examples:\nlight is a stream of photons; water is H2O; lightning is an\nelectrical discharge; gold is the element with atomic number 79. This\nmight give the impression that Kripkean essentialism is just a matter\nof the necessity of identity. However, in several of his discussions\nKripke does provide separate, independent arguments on the one hand\nfor the (necessary) necessity of being T for being C\nand on the other hand for the (necessary) sufficiency of being\nT for being C. In general, where K is a\nkind and P is some property, arguments for\n□∀x(Kx→Px) can be\ndecoupled from arguments for\n□∀x(Px→Kx). \nFor example, in his discussion of gold, Kripke argues that something\nthat is superficially like gold in appearance but lacks the property\nof having atomic number 79, would not be gold.  This establishes that,\nof necessity, having atomic number 79 is necessary for being gold, but\ndoes not show that possession of this property is sufficient for being\ngold.  Similarly, argues Kripke, if we were to discover a population\nof animals with the appearance of tigers but which turn out to be\nreptiles, we would deny that such creatures are tigers.  Being\nmammalian is necessarily a necessary condition of being a tiger, but\nof course not a sufficient condition \n\nPutnam's (1975a) Twin Earth thought experiment, in a non-semantic\nguise, leads to a similar conclusion. We imagine there is a planet,\n‘Twin Earth’, exactly like Earth in all readily observable\nrespects.  Every person and thing on Earth has a twin equivalent on\nTwin Earth.  However, there is no H2O on Twin\nEarth. Instead, there is a liquid that shares the manifest properties\nof water (e.g., its being colourless, tasteless, odourless, good for\ndrinking, etc.). This liquid is composed not of H2O\nmolecules but of very different molecules to which we assign the\nmade-up formula ‘XYZ’.  Despite its superficially\nwater-like properties, intuitively XYZ is not water.  What prevents\nXYZ form being water is the fact that XYZ is microstructurally\ndifferent from H2O. If intuition is reliable in this\nrespect, then (i) possessing water’s superficial properties is\nnot sufficient to make something a sample of water, and (ii) being\ncomposed of molecules of H2O is necessary for something's\nbeing a sample of water. (For more on Putnam's Twin Earth thought\nexperiment, see Section 3.2.3.)  \nIt is natural to use the expression ‘the essence of\n…’, which implies sufficiency as well as necessity:\npossession of the essence of K suffices for membership of\nK, as well as being necessary for it.  According to the\nforegoing, not all the arguments of Kripke and Putnam establish what\nthe essence of some kind is, rather they establish only what\nwe may call a partial essence, conditions that are necessary\nbut not sufficient. This is clear in some other of Kripke's\narguments. Thus it is only a partial essence that someone originates\nwith the gamete (sperm and egg) from which they in fact originate,\nsince they might have a monozygotic (identical) twin who has the same\norigin. A further question is whether there is a full essence\n(the essence) for everything that has a partial essence. \nThe fact that such arguments show only that F is an\nessential property of K means that they are invulnerable to\ncomplaints that not everything with F is K. For\nexample it is sometimes complained that water cannot be essentially\nH2O for the following reasons (a) water is a liquid,\nwhereas a substance comprised of H2O can exist as a solid\nor a gas; (b) a single H2O molecule is not a sample of\nwater because it does not have the properties we can ascribe to\nsamples of water (such as a temperature); (c) water is not simply\nH2O but is a polymer-like substance held together by\nhydrogen bonds. These observations are consistent with the claim of\nPutnam's argument that necessarily all water is composed of\nH2O molecules. \nThe arguments so far considered show that the superficial properties\nassociated with a kind are, in those cases, not sufficient for kind\nmembership, and so some further property (often a microstructural\nproperty) is a necessary condition.  Kripke also provides arguments\nthat show that many of the superficial properties typically associated\nwith a kind are not even necessary.  Kripke examines Kant's claim that\nit is a priori that gold is a yellow metal (Kripke 1980,\n118). Let us imagine that the yellow appearance of what we have always\ntaken to be samples of gold is just an optical illusion. Intuitively,\nwe would conclude that we had previously erred in thinking that gold\nis yellow—we would not conclude that there is no\ngold. Likewise, one might ask whether animal species are characterized\n(necessarily) by superficially available qualities, for example,\nwhether a tiger is, by definition, a large carnivorous quadrupedal\nfeline, tawny yellow in colour with blackish transverse stripes and a\nwhite belly (Kripke 1980, 119–121). Again, we may consider that\nthese features of the individual animals we have held to be tigers are\nin fact illusory; that those individuals and others of the same\nspecies are, for example, three–legged but that an optical\nillusion made us think otherwise. This suggests that satisfying a set\nof readily observable ‘superficial’ properties is not\nnecessary for membership of the tiger kind. \n\nThe foregoing arguments from Kripke lead to the conclusion that the\nrelevant kinds are not characterized of necessity by the readily\nobservable properties of their instances. They do not show what does\ncharacterize those kinds. Kripke takes the view that, in most cases,\nit is certain microstructural properties that determine the\nnature of these natural kinds, as evident in his endorsement of the\nidentities: ‘water is H2O’; ‘gold is the\nelement with atomic number 79’, ‘light is a stream of\nphotons’. Such essential properties of kinds are features,\ntherefore, that may be unknown even to competent users of a relevant\nkind concept.  Consequently, these are essences that, when known at\nall, are known a posteriori.\n\n \n\nWhile the arguments just considered suggest a microstructural essence\nfor the chemical and physical kinds considered, they do not have the\nconsequence that every natural kind must have a microstructural\nessence. Kripke regards material individuals as having historical\nessences. In the light of cladism in biology, one may regard biological\ntaxa as having historical essences also, and this is consistent with\nthe general picture given to us by Kripke and Putnam,\neven if they themselves once thought that biological kinds had\nmicrostructural essences (McGinn 1976; Kornblith 1993, 111; LaPorte 2004, 64).\nCladism is the most commonly accepted system of biological\nclassification that groups organisms according to their shared\nphylogenetic ancestry. Cladism has replaced the Linnean hierarchical\nsystem of biological classification where organisms were grouped\naccording to their shared morphological characteristics  (see\n Section 2.1 below).  \nKripke does not distinguish ‘essential property’ from\n‘necessary property’.  Fine (1994) notes that the claim\nthat P is a necessary property of X is not the same as the\nclaim that P is an essential property of X: the latter implies the\nformer but the former does not imply the latter.  The arguments for\nessentialism discussed above do not note this distinction and move\nquickly from claims about necessity to claims about essence: having\nshown that necessarily anything that is gold is made up of an element\nwith atomic number 79, Kripke concludes that having atomic number 79\nis an essential property of the kind gold. Fine's point may not be an\ninsuperable obstacle to establishing essentialism via the arguments of\nKripke and Putnam. For it may be held, as Fine holds, that essences\nconcern the nature or identity of things.  One may then argue that the\narguments of Kripke, Putnam, and others do appeal to intuitions\nconcerning the nature and/or identity of natural kinds, and so the\ninferences to essentialism from claims about necessity are legitimate\nin these cases.\n \n\nThe Kripke–Putnam arguments for essentialism are, in effect, direct\nappeals to intuition. For Ellis and Lowe, the dialectical basis for\nessentialism is that essentialism is a core part of what they each\ntake to be the optimal metaphysical system. Ellis (2001, 145–50)\nregards his essentialist metaphysics as supported by his argument that it\nyields a stronger argument for scientific realism. In particular, for\nEllis the essences of natural kinds explain the laws of nature: laws\nare grounded in the world's natural kind structure, which includes not\nonly natural kinds of thing but also natural kinds of process and\nevent. Above it was mentioned that for Lowe (2006, 144) laws concern\nnatural kinds; by contrast, for Ellis laws are grounded in essential\nfacts about kinds. As a consequence, the laws of nature are\nmetaphysically necessary. This has the advantage of explaining what\nnatural necessity is (it is just metaphysical necessity), but at the\ncost of denying the intuitive contingency of laws. Lowe, on the other\nhand, holds that laws can be grounded in the contingent possession of\nproperties by kinds, and so need not be metaphysically necessary. \n\nIn conclusion we note that some anti-essentialists argue that there is\nno non-question begging way of motivating the appeal to\nessences. Mellor argues that the existence of essences in essentialist\naccounts of natural kinds is simply a gratuitous assumption. (Mellor\n1977, 309). Others use examples from the empirical sciences such as\nbiology to argue that essentialism is too limited to capture the kinds\nwe find in the special sciences (Dupré 1981, 1993).  In\nparticular, essentialist accounts of kinds seem to construe them as\nimmutable or static, whereas examples from the natural sciences\ninclude mutable and dynamic kinds, as we see in section 2.1 below. \n\nOur interest in natural kinds is generated by the fact that the\nparticular sciences make frequent use of what, on the face of it, seem\nto be natural kinds.  So an important question is whether the kinds of\nthe special sciences (e.g. psychology, economics, biology, chemistry\nand so on) do in fact satisfy the conditions laid out by\nmetaphysicians for natural-kindhood (Fodor 1974; Dupré 1981,\n1993; Millikan 1999; Ellis 2001). And to the extent that they do not,\ndoes that show that these kinds are not genuine natural kinds after\nall, but are something different?  Or does it show that the\nmetaphysicians need to revise their theories of natural kindhood?  The\nmetaphysical issues raised by the special sciences vary.  For example,\nphilosophers of biology ask whether species would be better understood\nas being individuals rather than natural kinds.  The\nso-called species problem (Ghiselin 1974, 1987, 1997; Hull\n1976, 1978; Kitts and Kitts 1979, LaPorte 1994) asks which are the\nappropriate criteria to use in order to decide which particular\nspecies an organism belongs to. This is particularly challenging\nbecause species evolve over time, which makes it difficult to determine\nwhen we should recognize a new species and distinguish it from a distinct,\nolder ancestor species or from distinct sister species. Furthermore,\nthe criteria advanced by most of the various species concepts on offer\ninvolve relational rather than intrinsic properties of organisms. So\neither species are not natural kinds or the view that kindhood is\nfixed by the intrinsic properties of things must be revised. In the\nphilosophy of chemistry, a key question is whether chemical kinds\nprovide as much support for microstructuralism as the stock examples\ndiscussed by metaphysicians suggest (Hendry 2006; LaPorte 2004;\nNeedham, 2000, 2002; Van Brakel, 2000). Microstructuralism is the view\nthat chemical kinds can be individuated solely in terms of their\nchemical microstructure. Chemical elements would appear to support\nmicrostructuralism since atomic number is sufficient to individuate\nany element. However, the extension of this view to more complex\nchemical structures (such as molecules) is much discussed in the\nliterature.  In the philosophy of mind, the ontological status of\npsychological kinds has been questioned in the light of modern\nadvances in neuroscience (Churchland 1981; Fodor 1974). In particular,\naction is causally overdetermined by mental and neurophysiological\nkinds. If neuroscience can provide a sufficient account of action,\nthen the role of our common-sense folk psychological concepts, such as\nbelief and desire is called into question. Maybe there are no\npsychological natural kinds corresponding to those concepts.  Natural\nkind realists reject the conventionalist view that in all cases the\nboundaries of ‘natural’ kinds are drawn by human interests.  But is\nit plausible to draw a distinction between genuinely natural and\nconventional kinds when it comes to the social sciences?  In\nparticular, is it important that, via a feedback effect, human\nperceptions of what kinds there are can have an effect on the\ncomposition and even existence of those kinds (Hacking 1995)?  \n\nOne central issue in the philosophy of biology concerns the nature of\nbiological species, which have traditionally been held to be\nparadigmatic natural kinds. The traditional Linnean binomial system of\nclassification groups organisms into species and genera in virtue of\ntheir overall physical similarities (their morphology). However, only\nthe taxa species and genus were held to reflect \nontological divisions in nature. The higher taxa (e.g., family, \norder, class, phylum, kingdom) are merely\nconventional divisions, which are of heuristic use in biology.  \nBiologists offer many different species concepts, which disagree on\nhow species are individuated; indeed the different species concepts\nwill disagree about the extensions of species and about the number of\nspecies. For example, according to the interbreeding species concept\n(e.g. Mayr 1969), species are groups of interbreeding natural\npopulations, that are reproductively isolated from other groups. \nAlternatively, according to the phylogenetic approach to species \n(e.g. Cracraft 1983), species are classified according to common \nancestral descent. These two approaches carve species differently. \nSome phylogenetic species fail to be interbreeding species. For example, \norganisms that reproduce asexually may nevertheless have a common descent. \nThey will be grouped together as species by the phylogenetic\napproach, but not by the interbreeding approach. (Cf. Ereshefsky 1998\nfor a discussion.) Philosophers question whether the multiple divisions used by\nbiologists reflect an ontological pluralism in the world or, alternatively, whether \nthere is a privileged conception of species that captures ontological\nreality. Furthermore, some philosophers argue that species are not to\nbe considered as natural kinds at all, insisting instead that species\nare individuals.  Despite its long history and intuitive appeal, the conception of\nspecies as natural kinds is difficult to sustain while also\nmaintaining a traditional view of what a natural kind requires: a set\nof intrinsic natural properties that are individually necessary and\njointly sufficient for a particular to be a member of the kind. The fact that lineages evolve more or less gradually over time and\nthat this process leads to new species and other taxa, has two\nconsequences: first, that species are spatio-temporally restricted in\nthe sense that the species to which a particular organism belongs\ndepends on its being related to a specific lineage; and secondly, that\nthe characteristic properties of a species may change over time. The first consequence of evolution implies that, contra the\ntraditional view, intrinsically identical organisms may not be members\nof the same species: a cat-like organism independently evolved on a\ndistant planet would not be a cat.  (Cf. Dummett 1973: 144 ‘even\nif creatures exactly like men arose from dragons’ teeth, they\nwould not be men, because not children of Adam’.) The second consequence implies that intrinsic similarity is not\nnecessary for membership of the same species. There exists a high\ndegree of variation in intraspecific morphology and genetic\nmakeup. While members of kinds need not be intrinsically identical\n(e.g., there may be isotopic variation between samples of a chemical\nelement), there will nonetheless be certain distinctive intrinsic\nnatural properties common to all members of the kind (e.g., nuclear\ncharge in the case of atoms of the same element). That, it is claimed,\nis absent for species. Thus there is no genetic material or sequence\nof genes that all and only members of the species Drosophila\nmelanogaster possess, and likewise for all other species. Nor can\nwe turn to larger-scale phenotypic properties (which may nonetheless\nbe hidden), since evolutionary change may eliminate such features\nwithout a new species arising (Sober 1980). Furthermore, gradual\nchange, even through speciation, means that species will not be\ncategorically distinct (criterion 6), which\nfor Ellis (2001) is an additional reason to conclude that species are\nnot natural kinds. \n\nThese problems for the thesis that species are natural kinds may lead\none to conclude that classification by species does not correspond to\nany real division of things in nature any more than the higher taxa\ndo. Darwin himself expressed this kind of conventionalism, in taking\nspecies to differ only in degree from varieties on the one hand and\ngenera and higher taxa on the other hand: \n\n(Mishler 1999 contains a modern version of this view.) The rejection\nof species as natural kinds need not lead to the rejection of realism\nabout species altogether. Indeed, one can commit to species realism in\na specific way: Ghiselin (1974, 1987, 1995, 1997), Hull (1976, 1978,\n1980, 1987), and many other philosophers and biologists accept the\nclaim that species are individuals, not kinds. This claim\nwould appear to explain why, it is said, there are no serious\ncandidates for biological laws, at least concerning members of particular species\n(Beatty 1997). Individual organisms are\nparts of species, not members of the species-kind. \nSpeciation creates a new individual (or possibly two new individuals and \nthe cessation of the preceding species-individual) but not a new kind. \nOrganisms that are parts of the same species may share common features, \nbut that is not what makes them parts of that species. Rather the explanation \nis the reverse: because the organisms are parts of the same species \nthey are parts of the same lineage and so they will probably \n(but not inevitably) share features in common. \n\nDoes individualism about species imply that species are not natural\nkinds? One might suspect as much, but perhaps the two views are\ncompatible. LaPorte (2004), for example, believes that one can\nconsistently hold both views. Where one theorist will see a\nspecies-as-kind and an organism-as-member of that kind, another\ntheorist will see a species-as-individual and an organism-as-part of\nthat kind. And so even allowing that individualism is correct, we can\nconstruct a kind: if S is a species-individual and x\nis an organism, then x is a member of the\nspecies-kind S* iff x is a part\nof S.  For example, an individual organism (a radish plant)\nis a part of the species-individual Raphanus Sativus if and\nonly if it is a member of the species-kind Raphanus Sativus\n(LaPorte 2004, 16). LaPorte's view does entail giving up on certain\nfeatures that natural kinds are often thought to have; one cannot\nstill hold that kind membership is necessarily intrinsic, since\n‘being a part of y’ is not an intrinsic property\nand parts of the same entity do not necessarily have any intrinsic\nproperties in common. For that reason, it is also less plausible that\nkinds must play a role in laws of nature. \n\nIf one retains the view that species are natural kinds one must\nconfront the fact that a plethora of species concepts are available and\nas seen earlier, these species concepts do not always delineate the\nsame species. For example, Mayr's (1969) \nbiological species concept (BSC) regards a species as a\ngroup of “interbreeding natural populations that are\nreproductively isolated from other such populations” (1969,\n26). The phylogenetic species concept (PSC) holds that a\nspecies is “the smallest diagnosable cluster of individual\norganisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and\ndescent” (Cracraft 1983, 170).  These definitions are not\nperfectly coextensive. (For a detailed discussion of species concepts\nsee the entry on species.)  \n\nThis diversity may be thought to support conventionalism about\nnatural kinds\n (Section 1.1.2).\nBut supporters of naturalism about our classifications \n (Section 1.1)\n will deny that the dispute in systematics reflects an indeterminacy in\nthe natural world. A monist will hold that one of the\nexisting systems is a superior account of the natural world. A\ncommitment to one of the different systems over another will result in\na different ontological account of species. The most prevalent system\nof classification in contemporary systematics is cladistics, which\nclassifies organisms phylogenetically, in virtue of shared derived\nfeatures or an organism's place in the genealogical tree. \n\nAn alternative view to monism, motivated by the variety of\nspecies concepts, is pluralism, which holds that the different\naccounts of species in systematics reflect equally legitimate ways \nof carving up nature subject to our pragmatic and theoretical interests. \nHowever, these systems do carve nature in genuinely natural ways. The \nspecies and higher taxa that they delineate reflect real features of \nthe world from the point of view of different theoretical interests. \nPluralism (Kitcher 1984; Dupré 1993; Ereshefsky 1992) is the weakest \nform of realism about kinds in the philosophy of biology. \n\nKripke (1971, 1972) and Putnam (1975a) use animal kinds as examples of\nnatural kinds for which a posteriori essences can be\nfound. There is some implication that these essences are\nmicrostructural, intrinsic properties, which will be, of necessity,\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient for an entity to be a\nmember of a kind. However, if species are individuals, then it is not\ntrue that species may be individuated on the basis of the intrinsic\nproperties of their members. The various species concepts tend to\noffer relational criteria of species membership (see above).\nAccording to the BSC, for example, membership of a species depends on\nrelational properties, such as membership of a certain population and\ninterbreeding. Alternatively, the PSC refers to shared descent. However, Kripke (1980) himself argues that a person's parentage is\nessential to them. If that is so, then if individual S is\ndescended from\nN, then S is necessarily descended\nfrom N. McGinn (1976) suggests that this extends to species\nalso.  LaPorte (2004) argues that essentialism holds with respect to\nfacts relating individuals, species, and other taxa to the higher taxa\n(genus and above) within which they are nested. These taxa are clades,\nthat is to say kinds defined by shared descent from a common ancestral\ngroup: an individual or group that is a member or part of clade is\nnecessarily a member or part of that clade. Thus biological kinds\n(species, genera, etc.) do have essential properties, and these are\nhistorical rather than intrinsic properties.  So one option for biological essentialism is to drop the\ntraditional view that the natural properties that are essential for\nmembership of a natural kind are intrinsic:\nnatural, extrinsic (relational) properties can play this role\n(Okasha 2002). The categorical distinctness criterion must be dropped\nalso. On account of the problems for natural kinds in biology as well as\nthe development of modern chemistry, chemical kinds have replaced\nbiological kinds as the paradigms of natural kinds. The chemical\nelements and chemical compounds appear to be bona fide\nnatural kinds. We refer to chemical kinds in laws, explanations, and\ninductions: that a certain item is iron explains its behaviour and\nthat behaviour is predictable; that iron objects are magnetizable is a\nlaw of nature (criteria\n 2\n and 3\n above). Moreover, we can induce that all iron is magnetizable, from the\nobservation of particular instances of iron objects that are magnetic. And chemical\nkinds appear to obey the categorical distinctness requirement: iron is\nclearly distinct from its neighbours in the periodic table (manganese\nand cobalt); no elements are intermediate kinds \n (criterion 6\n above). Furthermore, microstructural essentialism seems to be a prima\nfacie plausible option for chemical kinds: it is essential\nto iron that something made of pure iron is constituted by atoms that\nhave precisely 26 protons in their nuclei. \n\nMicrostructuralism in the philosophy of chemistry is the thesis that\nchemical kinds can be individuated solely in terms of their\nmicrostructural properties (Hendry 2006). As exemplified above by the\ncase of iron, the chemical elements provide paradigmatic kinds that may\nbe individuated microstructurally, since the atomic number—the number\nof protons in the nucleus—suffices to identify the element. It is true\nthat macro-level chemical and physical properties can also serve to\nindividuate chemical elements, and in the nineteenth century chemists\nwere able to individuate elements without knowing what we do about\nnuclear structure. However, it is held that atomic number has\nexplanatory priority: the number of protons in the nucleus, and hence\nthe nuclear charge, explains the structure of electrons surrounding\nthe nucleus, which, in turn, explains the chemical behaviour of the\nelement. \n\nThe microstructuralist can extend this approach from elements to\ncompounds. Compounds are identified principally by their constituent\nelements. Thus carbon dioxide is that compound of carbon and oxygen\nwith the molar proportion 1:2. In more detail, molecules of carbon\ndioxide consist of two oxygen atoms and a single carbon atom. The\npractice of identifying a chemical compound only by its composing\nelements was the norm in chemistry, until the discovery of isomerism\nby Friedrich Woehler in 1827. Isomers are distinct compounds that\nnonetheless share the same constituent elements in the same\nproportion. Thus fulminic acid and cyanic acid may both be expressed\nin terms of constituents in the empirical formula CHNO, but their\ndistinct chemical and physical properties identify them as different\nsubstances. The explanation of isomerism (and many other facts in\norganic chemistry), provided first by August Kekulé and\nArchibald Scott Couper, is the fact that certain compounds exist in\nmolecular form and these molecules have internal structure. Thus\nmolecules of isomers have the same atoms in different spatial\narrangements, e.g., CHNO may be arranged as H–O–C≡N\n(cyanic acid) or as H–C=N–O (fulminic acid). Isomerism\nmeans that specifying the chemical composition alone is not sufficient\nfor classification. The microstructure of a compound concerns not just\nthe elemental atoms in its molecules, but also their spatial\narrangement. \n\nNeedham (2000) and van Brakel (2000) have argued that compounds such\nas water are dynamic structures whose natures cannot be given in\nstatic accounts of their composing elements. Molecules of\nH2O are polar, with the consequence that the\nelectropositive hydrogen atoms in one H2O molecule will\nbond with the electronegative oxygen atoms in another H2O\nmolecule, such bonds being hydrogen bonds with the result\nthat in liquid water H2O molecules will form polymer-like\nchains known as oligomers.  The hydrogen bonds and the\nconsequent chains are responsible for the fact that water is liquid at\nroom temperature (whereas compounds with similarly sized molecules,\nsuch as hydrogen sulphide, methane, and carbon dioxide, are all\ngaseous at room temperature). These oligomers are constantly forming,\nbreaking, and reforming. The rate of such changes and the mean length\nof such oligomers are dependent on the thermodynamic context (in the\nextreme case, an ice crystal may be considered as a single such\noligomer, the crystal structure being dependent on the fixed, strong\nhydrogen bonds). Thus, say Needham and van Brakel, we cannot consider\nwater to be just a compound composed of a collection of H2O\nmolecules. Furthermore, anything that is to be water must be a\nmacroscopic entity, since only macroscopic bodies can bear\nthermodynamic properties, such as melting point, which we use to\nidentify water. Hence, a single H2O molecule is not\nwater. \n\nThese considerations need not undermine the microstructuralist claim.\nMany chemical kinds may exist in any of the solid, liquid, and gaseous\nstates while remaining the same substance, including water. But,\nwater vapour will not possess the oligomers present in liquid water\nand ice. So their presence, however characteristic of water in the\nliquid and solid phases, cannot be a necessary feature of all bodies\nof water. Above we saw that atomic number is regarded as the essential\nfeature of an element because it explains the other characteristics an\nelement has. Likewise, the structure of the H2O molecule \nexplains why it is a strongly polar molecule, which in turn explains\nwhy it tends to form oligomers. As regards thermodynamic properties,\nHendry (2006) points out that we say that water is contained in a\nperson's body, without thinking that this water has any thermodynamic\nproperties. More generally, thermodynamic properties can be\nascribed only to entities in equilibrium, but not all bodies of water\nare in thermodynamic equilibrium or even nearly so. We may very well\nuse such thermodynamic properties in identifying something as water,\nbut that does not mean that it is in virtue of such properties that\nsomething is water. \n\nHendry (2006) points to a potentially more difficult problem,\nwhich is that any liquid sample of water, however pure, contains not\nonly H2O molecules but also H3O+\nand OH− ions. These ions cannot be regarded as impurities, \nsince they are also an inevitable consequence of the polar structure \nof the H2O molecule. Hendry's solution is to regard \nH2O molecules as the constituents of water in rather\nthe same sense that eggs and flour are the constituents of a\ncake—they go into making the cake but need not retain exactly\nthe form they started with. Water is made from bodies of\nH2O molecules, but not all those retain precisely that\nstructure. \n\nThe taxa in the classical Linnean system of biological classification\nare nested in a hierarchy, as required by\n criterion 5 \n in Section 1.1. But, in certain respects, chemical classification fails to \nmeet this requirement. The phenomenon of allotropy is exhibited when \nan element exists in two or more distinct forms. The element carbon has\nseveral, including the allotropes diamond and graphite. Tin\nhas two allotropes at room tempreature, white tin (which is metallic) and grey tin (which\nis non-metallic). Some instances of tin will fall into one category and\nother instances will fall into the other category. Consequently,\nclassification by element and classification by metal or non-metal\ncannot be combined hierarchically. \n\nSuch cross-cutting classifications are frequently found in organic\nchemistry, where compounds can be classified according to their\nso-called functional groups. Functional groups are specific\ncombinations of atoms within a molecule that will cause the molecule\nto engage in certain reactions and to have other physical and chemical\nproperties that are characteristic of that group. For example,\nalcohols are organic compounds containing a hydroxyl group −OH\nbound to a carbon atom of an alkyl group or derivative of an alkyl\ngroup. Alcohols undergo characteristic reactions such as\nesterification. Since other hydrogen atoms in an alcohol molecule may\nbe substituted by another functional group, the resulting molecule\nwill have properties characteristic of both functional groups and may\nbe classified accordingly. Benzyl alcohol,\nC6H5CH2OH (or BnOH), is obtained from\nmethane, CH4, by replacing one hydrogen atom by an\nalcohol-forming hydroxyl group, −OH, and another by the phenyl\ngroup −C6H5 (Ph) (the phenyl group plus\nthe CH2 from the methane is the benzyl group, i.e.\nBn is PhCH2). Thus benzyl alcohol may be classified either\nas an alcohol, or as an aromatic benzene derivative, since it\nparticipates in the characteristic reactions of the latter, such as\nelectrophilic aromatic substitution or hydrogenation of the benzene\nring. If the hierarchy requirement on a system of natural kinds is\ncorrect, then not all these cross-cutting classifications pick out\nnatural kinds. The claim that the hierarchy requirement is too\nstringent for scientific kinds has been defended by Khalidi (1998) and\nTobin (2010b).  \n\nOne may have to deny that metals form a natural kind, and that\nclassification by functional group is a classification into natural\nkinds. (Not all classifications need to be into kinds in order for them\nto be useful.) Note that in both cases, there is room for vagueness.\nSome elements, such as germanium and antimony, are classed\nas metalloids, with characteristics between metals and non-metals. The\nimpact of a functional group diminishes with the size of the molecules\nof which it is a part and in the presence of competing functional\ngroups, and so in certain cases, classification according to functional\ngroup will be vague. Such vagueness falls foul of the categorical\ndistinctness requirement\n (criterion 6 \n above). \n\nDo the different sorts of mental state form natural kinds? We\ncertainly think that our minds make a difference to what happens in\nthe physical world and we think that we act because\nwe have certain beliefs, desires, hopes, fears etc. The distinctive\nexplanatory roles performed by these different states in folk\npsychology certainly suggest that these beliefs, desires, hopes and\nfears constitute distinct mental natural kinds. Note that in\nconsidering natural kinds in chemistry, biology, and physics we have\nthought of kinds principally as kinds of thing (kinds of stuff,\norganism, particle, etc.) whereas we are now considering the\npossibility of certain kinds of state. (Ellis (2001, 2002) \nis clear that he does not limit natural kinds to kinds of thing, but \nincludes kinds of state and process also.) A Cartesian dualist holds\nthat mental states are distinct from any physical state of the\nsubject, as they are states of an immaterial thinking substance. The\nproblem for dualism however is in finding the ground of the difference\nbetween fearing, believing, hoping etc. i.e. what difference is there\nto the immaterial substance when a subject is in different mental\nstates? In principle this problem could be avoided by the dualist if\nmental kinds are regarded as immaterial substances (Shoemaker 2003).  \n\nThere are many ways to understand mental natural kinds, and theories\nhave been proposed by eliminativists, identity theorists,\nfunctionalists and many others. We will treat each of these in turn. \nPhysicalists hold that the differences in mental kinds relate somehow to \ndifferences in states of the subject's brain, or, more generally, \nthe subject's body. At one extreme, the (type) identity theory of mind\nholds that types of mental state are identical with types of brain\nstate. If so, we may expect the kinds of psychology to be identical with\nthe kinds of neuroscience.  \n\nThe identity theory faces the problem of multiple\nrealizability—the idea that it is possible for physically\ndiverse creatures to be in the same kind of mental state. It is\npossible, for example, that Martian neurophysiology might be entirely\ndifferent from that of humans while Martians nonetheless have the same\nkinds of mental state as humans have; if a Martian's body is injured,\nit writhes, groans, and avoids the causes of such injuries—the\nMartian is in pain (Lewis 1980). Indeed it is possible that cognitive\nscientists might design a machine that is capable of higher-level\nthought (implemented on, for example, a silicon architecture). It is\neven possible that the same mental kinds be realized by distinct\nneurophysiological systems in one and the same organism over\ntime. Consequently, it is at least an open empirical possibility that\nmental kinds may correspond to a widely disjunctive and heterogeneous\nset of neurophysiological kinds, and hence that there is no one-to-one\ncorrelation between them.  \nEliminativism argues that the prima facie failure to\nstraightforwardly reduce mental kinds to neurophysiological kinds\nought to lead to the elimination of mental kinds altogether\n(Churchland 1981, 1988). This is to claim that there are no mental\nnatural kinds. On this view, the mental kinds in folk psychology are\ncomparable to the kinds delineated by discredited folk theories from\nthe past e.g., the humours in medieval medicine. The underlying\nprinciple of medieval medicine was the balancing of so-called four\nhumours. According to the theory, illness was caused by an imbalance\nof these four humours.  From the point of view of modern medicine this\ntheory is radically false and so the only option is to eliminate the\nhumours as putative natural kinds. Analogously, mental kinds ought to\nbe eliminated in favour of those kinds uncovered by recent research in\nneuroscience. Eliminativists agree that human beings have invented a\nvery successful methodology for describing their mental lives. This\nmethodology is folk psychology, a common sense theory of how mental\nstates are causally related to human action.  However, folk\npsychology, they argue, is merely a heuristic device invented by human\nbeings in order to make the explanation of behaviour easier.  The\nposits of the theory are not real natural kinds. Once a better\nexplanation of human behaviour in terms of neurophysiological kinds is\navailable, then mental kinds will be eliminated.  \n\nFunctionalists argue that the irreducibilty of mental kinds is\nnevertheless compatible with a token-token identity theory (Fodor\n1974, 1997). Mental kinds are not type-identical with neurophysiological\nkinds (i.e. there is not one type of neurophysiological\ncorrelate for each type of mental state, so we cannot make general\nidentity statements such as “pain = C-fibres\nfiring”). A Martian and I, both in a state of fear at a\ntime t, may be in different physiological\nstates. Nevertheless, my token instance of the kind fear at time\nt will be identical with the token physical state in my brain\nat that time. Likewise, the token instance of the Martian's fear at\ntime t1 is identical with his token physical state.  \n\nIt has been argued by Kim (1992, 1993) that multiply realized mental\nkinds of the latter kind can in principle be locally reduced to their\nrealizing states. Mental kinds are analogous to mineral kinds such as\njade, which can be locally reduced to\nnephrite or jadeite depending on the sample. Importantly, a sample \nthat does not consist of either nephrite or jadeite is simply not jade. \nNevertheless, there is an important disanalogy between mental kinds and \nlocally reduced kinds like jade. If you want a sample of jade, then it \nmust be composed of either jadeite or nephrite. In other words, if \nJ (jade) is realized by the disjunction P (Jadeite) or \nQ (Nephrite), then it is metaphysically necessary that the \nproperties a thing has qua J are either properties it\nhas qua P or properties it has qua Q. \nSo, something with all the other qualitative properties of\njade in another possible world, but which lacked the essential \nproperties (i.e., jadeite or nephrite) would simply not be \nan instance of jade. \n\nIn contrast, for the functionalist (Fodor 1997) mental kinds are\ndefined by their functional roles, rather than by the essential\nproperties of the neurophysiological kinds that realize them. It does\nnot matter which physical kind does the realizing, be it silicon\nchips, neurons, C-fibres or whatever. Rather, what matters is\nthat the psychological state (e.g., pain) plays a certain functional\nrole. The whole point of multiple realizability is that it is easy to\nimagine some possible world where a token mental kind is realized by\nsilicon chips, C-fibres firing, or whatever. So, a mental\nkind is not essentially realized by a certain neurophysiological kind;\nrather it plays the same functional role independently of what\nunderlying kind is realizing it. This appears to\nviolate criterion 1) for natural kinds (in\nSection 1.1.1); namely, that members of a natural kind should have\nsome natural properties in common. \n\nThe functional role of mental kinds is explained by some\nfunctionalists in terms of the modularity of the mind (Fodor\n1983). This is the claim that the mind has different innate modules\nwhich play a certain functional role. These modules are\ndomain-specific, operating only on certain kinds of inputs. So, for\nexample, there will be distinct modules for mental tasks like\nmind-reading, speaker recognition and facial recognition. The\nfunctional role associated with mental kinds might for example be\ngiven an evolutionary account in terms of adapted modules (Cosmides\nand Tooby 1992). On this view, mental kinds in folk psychology are\nsuccessful for the purposes of the explanation of human behaviour\nbecause they refer to the functional modules of the mind. Such views\nmay motivate emergentism. One interpretation of the\nemergentist account of mind is that there are emergent mental kinds\nthat have no straightforward correlation with the kinds identified by\nneuroscience. Nor are mental kinds and neurophysiological kinds either\nidentical to or subkinds of one another; consequently emergentism is in\nconflict with the (contested) taxonomic hierarchy criterion\n(criterion 5).  (See the entry on\n emergent properties.) \n\nThe type-identity theory, if true, might seem to motivate essentialism\nabout psychological kinds, by analogy with other theoretical\nidentities (cf.\n Section 1.3.1\n and\n Section 3.3).\n Kripke (1980), however, \ndenies that his arguments concerning other theoretical identities\napply here. Let us say that (slow) pain for us humans is correlated\nwith the firing of C-fibres. If this were a genuine \ntheoretical identity, then in all possible worlds, when someone\nundergoes C-fibre firing, then they are in a state of pain.\nBut it seems plausible that there could be worlds where C-fibre \nstimulation is not accompanied by any painful sensation. If there are \nsuch worlds, then the theoretical identity implies that such a world \nis one where people can be in pain without having any painful sensation; \nindeed the pain might yield a pleasant sensation. Kripke regards this \nas counterintuitive. The concept of pain is necessarily tied to the \nphenomenal nature of the pain sensation, whereas the concept of gold \nis not tied to the colour yellow. Consequently, there is no identity \nbetween pain and C-fibre firing (nor any other physical state); \nlikewise there is no physical essence to pain. A posteriori natural \nkind essentialism fails in this case.  Recently, there has been some discussion of whether mental concepts\nare themselves natural kinds. The claim that concepts form a natural\nkind has been accepted by philosophers of psychology and cognitive\npsychologists alike (Margolis, 1994, 1995; Fodor, 1998, 2008). Recent\nliterature has argued against that assumption (Griffiths 1997; Machery\n2005, 2009; Piccinini and Scott 2006). Griffiths 1997 has argued that\nindividual and familiar concepts such as emotion do not correspond to\ngenuine natural kinds, and should therefore be eliminated from\nscientific vocabulary. Machery's (2009, Ch. 3) heterogeneity\nhypothesis claims furthermore that the class of concepts do not\ndelineate a homogeneous class; the kind ‘concept’. Rather, they divide\ninto several distinct kinds that actually have little in common. Thus,\nit is a mistake to assume that there are many general properties of\nconcepts, and that a theory of concepts should attempt to describe\nthese. In general, then the notion of concept is not part of an\nadequate taxonomy of our mental representation. The question as to whether there are social kinds has a long\nhistory. In the sociology of science, functionalists such as Durkheim\n(1897) have argued that there is empirical support for the autonomy of\nsocial facts. For example, statistical analysis shows that suicide\nrates differed radically depending on social factors, (e.g. religious\nbackground, gender, marital status etc.) This analysis led to the\npossibility of social science being taken in a quantitative\ndirection. Even if every individual commits suicide as a result of\npsychological factors, the statistical facts about the\nreasons for suicide and how they change with place and\nover time are distinctly social. One question then is whether one\nshould be naturalist about such social facts. If so, how could\nnaturalism be reconciled with the claim that social facts are dynamic\nand changing in so far as they concern human beings in social\ninteractions? \n\nBecause social kinds are distinctly anthropocentric, some theorists\nclaim that the only plausible view we can hold is some form of\nconstructivism about them. Hacking (1995, 1999) argues that in social\ncontexts the object of classification itself changes in being\nclassified. The fact that the people being classified are conscious\nmakes for dynamic interactions between the classification and the\nclassified.  The latter may resist or embrace certain classifications\n(‘child abuser’, ‘hip’) and modify their\nbehaviour accordingly.  This leads to an change in the extensions of\nthe relevant kind concepts. Furthermore, as the extensions change, the\ncriteria for membership may change also. Many of our classifications\nin social science are evaluative. A social situation looks deviant\nfrom the norm and people make an evaluative judgment about\nthis. Sometimes this means that people passively accept what experts\nsay about them, and see themselves in that light. But feedback can\ndirect itself in many ways. Alternatively, some people seek to\nreclassify themselves. Thus, classification in social science is\ninteractive. Hacking argues that this is in marked contrast to the\nindifferent kinds that are found in natural science.  An electron is\nindifferent to being classified as an electron. Pace Hacking, Khalidi (2010) argues that in fact the\ncontrast between natural and social kinds is not so stark: even many\nchemical kinds would not have been instantiated in the world were it\nnot for the fact that a scientist conceived of it and acted on that\nconception. So in both cases the existence of a classification scheme\ncan cause changes to the extension of the kinds in question. The\ndifference between natural kinds and social kinds is a difference of\nthe degree of control we have over the object of classification. In\nthe chemical domain, for example, the nature of the phenomena\nthemselves imposes greater restrictions on the kinds that we can\ncreate.  (See also Cooper 2004.) \n\nMuch recent interest in natural kinds has been stimulated by debates\nconcerning the semantics of natural kind terms, originating especially\nwith the work of Saul Kripke (1972) and Hilary Putnam (1973,\n1975a). Typical natural kind expressions fall into one of two\ncategories: predicates (is water, is gold, is a\ntiger, and\nis an oak) and singular terms (water,\ngold, the tiger, and the oak).  In this\nsection we survey some of the debates concerning the meaning of such\nterms, what—if anything—they refer to, and how they do\nso. Many discussions focus on the predicate kind terms, often\nconsidering them alongside other general terms, taking the principal\nissue to be the relationship between a natural kind term and its\nextension. Such an approach will appeal to conventionalists, but it may appeal also\nto those naturalists who are nominalists about natural kinds or\notherwise hostile or indifferent to (strong) realism about natural\nkinds. However, we shall see that there may be reason to take the\nsingular kind terms as primary. (One difference between Putnam and\nKripke is that while Putnam tends to focus on the natural kind\npredicates, Kripke's arguments are centered primarily on the singular\nnatural kind terms.) Kripke and Putnam attacked a pair of related\nviews about natural kind terms: descriptivist semantics (the meaning\nof such a term is a description satisfied by all and only members of\nthe kind) and internalism (the meaning of such a term, the relevant\ndescription, is fully grasped by competent users of the term so that\nwhat fixes the extension of the term supervenes on what is internal to\nthe user).  Putnam's rejection of descriptivism is a component of his\nargument that ‘meaning ain't in the head’ whereas for\nKripke the goal is to show that natural kind terms are much like\nproper names, for which, he argues, a descriptivist semantics\nfails. Members of the extension of a natural kind share properties in\ncommon.  If descriptivism were true, then one would reasonably believe\nthat those properties would be the properties mentioned in the\ndescription with the possible addition of further properties nomically\ncorrelated with those.  But if descriptivism is false, it would appear\nthat the characteristic properties of a kind will not typically be\nknowable a priori, but must be uncovered by scientific investigation.\nIf so, then those properties, being necessary conditions of kind\nmembership but discoverable only a posteriori, look very much\nlike real essences.  At first sight it seems then that the\nsemantic arguments of Kripke and Putnam have metaphysical\nconsequences.  This is highly controversial (Salmon 1979, 1982). Do\nthe arguments of Putnam and Kripke really support an essentialist\nmetaphysics? Or do they illegitimately assume it? Or do they, more\ninnocently, show that we as users of natural kind terms implicitly\nassume such a metaphysics? \n\nThe modern tradition of natural kinds begins with J. S. Mill (1884)\nwho talked of ‘Kinds’ (the term ‘natural kind’\nis traced by Hacking (1991a) back to Mill's contemporary, the logician\nJohn Venn (1886)). According to Mill, typical singular (individual)\nnames such as ‘Scott’ denote their referents but\nlack any connotation, that is to say the names do not imply\nany attribute.  Some singular names do have connotation as well as\ndenotation, for example ‘the author of Waverley’.  A\ngeneral name, such as ‘white’, denotes all the things they\nhold of (its extension) while also connoting the attribute they all\nshare in common. Natural kind terms are a special case of general\nterms in this respect \n\nThe idea that something such as a connotation determines the extension\nof a term is elaborated in Frege's notion of sense\nand, later, that of intension. Frege and later philosophers have\napplied this view to singular proper names, and views of this sort\nfall under the general heading of ‘descriptivism’.\nRussell is also often referred to in this regard, but it should be\nremembered that Russell's view is that grammatically proper names \nare abbreviations of quantified expressions and so do not have any\nreferring role at all (and so a fortiori they do not have a \nreferring role that is meditated by a connotation/sense/intension).\nSome neo-Fregeans nevertheless deny that Fregean senses should be\ncashed out as descriptions (e.g., McDowell 1977; Evans\n1982).  \n\nMill's descriptivism implies that for each natural kind term there is\nan associated set of properties such that for some item to be a member\nof that natural kind, it should possess those properties—these\nare properties that describe objects belonging to the kind in\nquestion. Implicit in Mill and explicit in Frege is the claim that\nthese descriptions are constitutive of the meaning of the term in the\nfollowing way: someone who understands the term adequately will be\nin a position to grasp a priori that something falls under\nthe kind term if and only if it satisfies that description. For this\nreason the relevant properties will normally be readily observable\nproperties of things; they will not be properties associated with the\nkind only by a posteriori investigation. For example, as mentioned\nabove, Kant held the view that it is a priori that something\nfalls under the kind term gold only if it is a yellow\nmetal. Because the extension-fixing meaning of a term is thus\ngraspable a priori this view is internalist about\nextension fixing. The extensions of kind terms of any two subjects\nwith the same internal mental states will have (in the same context)\nthe same extensions. \n\nPutnam (1973, 1975a) and Kripke (1972) reject the descriptivist view of\nnatural kind terms. Putnam's principal aim is to undermine internalism\nabout reference and extension (“meanings just aint in the\nhead”). Kripke's aim is first to restate a Millian view of \nproper names (they denote without connoting) and then to extend that view \nto natural kind terms. (‘Millian’ will be used to characterize \nany account of the semantics of a term that claims that it denotes without\nconnoting, even when applied, pace Mill, to kind terms.)\nAccording to Kripke, Mill was right about proper names but wrong about\nkinds; Millianism—Mill's denotation-without-connotation\nview—is right for both sorts of term. Salmon (1982) categorizes\nKripke's arguments against descriptivism for singular terms under the\nheadings ‘the modal arguments’, ‘the epistemological\narguments’, and ‘the semantic arguments’—this \ncategorization is useful also for the corresponding arguments against \ndescriptivism for general terms. \n\nThe modal arguments against descriptivism take the following form.\nLet C be some natural kind and D be some complex set\nof readily observable properties that would, on a descriptivist view,\nbe most naturally regarded as providing the content of the description\nthat constitutes the meaning of ‘C’.  Now\nconsider: \n\nSince D is constitutive of the meaning of\n‘C’, (K) should be analytic and so necessary.\nThe descriptive view would thus be refuted either by (i)\nmetaphysically possible instances of the kind C that do not\npossess the property complex D or by (ii) metaphysically\npossible items that do possess the property complex D without\nbeing instances of C. \n\nSome proposed cases of (i) require the laws of nature to be contingent.  Although\nthe laws of nature are widely held to be contingent, some philosophers hold that\nthe laws are necessary, on the basis of essentialist arguments that\nare much of a piece with Kripke's essentialist arguments, even if\nstrictly independent of them. The anti-descriptivist arguments regard\nthe observable properties of instances of a kind C as nomic\nconsequences of the essence of C. If the laws of nature are\nmetaphysically necessary then D will be a necessary property\nof instances of C also.  Thus, instances of (i) will not be\navailable. If the laws are necessary, then the melting point of gold\nwill be necessary just as the atomic number of gold is. However, not\nall observable properties are consequences of the laws alone. Some are\nconsequences of the laws plus contingent environmental factors.  Thus\nthe perceived colour of an object may change with environmental\ndifferences. Thus if looking yellow is a component\nof D, then a possible world in which gold does not look\nyellow (because of unusual atmospheric effects)—surely a genuine\npossibility—would be a counterinstance of type (i). On the other\nhand, it might be argued, that the proper component of D\nwould be being yellow, in which case we will have the makings\nof an epistemological argument against descriptivism (see below). \n\nOther cases of (i) might be thought to be generated, irrespective of\nthe necessity of the laws, by noting that a kind might be manifested\nin two or more superficially distinct species. Thus allotropes are\ndistinct types of a single chemical kind that may differ considerably\nin superficial properties (for example, graphite and diamond, both\ntypes of the element carbon). Similarly, a caterpillar and a butterfly\ncan be members of the same species. For known cases, D would\nhave to be disjunctive. While that may not itself be problematic, it\nraises the epistemic possibility that the same phenomenon may be\n(nomically and metaphysically) possible for many kinds that we think\nexist in only one form. \n\nCases of (ii) may be more readily available, since the necessity of\nlaws may rule out a particular kind having different possible sets of\nmanifest properties, but does not rule out two distinct possible kinds\nhaving the same manifest properties. Indeed, the case of jadeite and\nnephrite is often referred to as an example of the latter. Along the\nsame lines, we may imagine that something like fool's gold, iron\npyrites, is just like gold in observable properties, differing only in chemical\nconstitution. We may imagine that there were creatures to all\nappearances like cats, but which are internally robots; or just like\ntigers but had reptilian innards. These are all metaphysically\npossible, so the arguments go; hence, possession of the relevant\nproperties cannot suffice for membership of the corresponding\nkind. \n\nThe modal argument does not refute descriptivism applied to every\ndescription—after all, Kripke and Putnam do both think that the \ndescription “is constituted by H2O” holds \nnecessarily of anything that is water. Rather, the modal argument is \nintended to exclude as possible descriptions those that could be \nconstitutive of a sense or connotation that is grasped by any \ncompetent user of the term. Such a sense, if it exists, would \nemploy descriptions that refer to the observable features of the \nmembers of a kind, not those features uncovered by science. \n\nThe epistemological arguments against descriptivism have a similar\nstructure to the modal arguments. Consider again the proposition (K).\nSomeone who uses the term ‘C’ competently should be\nthereby able to come to know that (K) is true, in virtue of grasping\nthe meaning of ‘C’. Thus (K) should be a\npriori. So counterexamples to descriptivism would be cases (i)\nwhere although one knows that some thing is of the kind C one\ncannot thereby come to know that it possesses the property\ncomplex D, or (ii) where although one knows that some thing\npossesses the property complex D, one cannot thereby come to\nknow that it is of the kind C. \n\nTo generate epistemological type (i) cases, Kripke asks us to imagine\nthat gold might be blue but only appears yellow thanks to an optical\nillusion, or that tigers do not normally have four legs, but only\nappear that way, again thanks to an illusion. However, if the\ndescriptions associated with ‘gold’ were to include\n‘is yellow’ and the descriptions associated with\n‘tiger’ include ‘is four-legged’ then we would\nknow a priori that these possibilities do not obtain. But\nthat seems to be a mistake. Although we may reasonably be confident\nthat gold really is yellow and not blue, and not just appearing that\nway, this confidence is not a priori but is instead a\nconsequence of a posteriori experience of the conditions\nunder which we have observed samples of gold. It is a matter of\ndiscovery whether we are subject to this kind of illusion, or whether\nsomething that is in fact white or grey could be gold; for example it\nis only a posteriori that we know that gold does not have\nwhite and grey allotropes, as tin does. (What is called ‘white\ngold’ is in fact an alloy of gold; but given a description of\nits appearance, it is not a priori that it is not gold. This\nis a contrapositive version of an epistemological type (i) case.)\nLikewise, turning to epistemological type (ii) cases, if descriptivism\nwere correct, we could rule out a priori the possibility that\nsomething has all the superficial properties of gold, but is not\ngold. But again we do not have such a priori knowledge (again\nwe note that jadeite is superficially similar to nephrite but not the\nsame kind). \n\nPutnam's Division of Linguistic Labor may be thought of as furnishing\nan epistemological argument. Putnam's idea is that the referent of a\nterm used by some individual may be fixed not by their own knowledge\nor beliefs, but rather by the knowledge of certain experts to whom\nthat individual defers. Since aluminium and molybdenum are different\nkinds, then according to descriptivism there should be some a\npriori knowable features that will distinguish between them for\nanyone who is capable of using ‘aluminium’ to refer to the\none kind and ‘molybdenum’ to the other kind.  Likewise\nthere should be some mental difference between a speaker in the actual\nworld who uses ‘aluminium’ to refer to aluminium and a\nspeaker in another world, where the instances of aluminium and\nmolybdenum are swapped (pans and cans are made of molybdenum there),\nwho uses ‘aluminium’ to refer to molybdenum. But, says,\nPutnam, no such difference need exist: ordinary speakers have these\ndifferentiated referring capacities without any difference in\nknowledge of the referents. That is because those referential\ncapacities are parasitic on those of the experts who do have the\nrequired discriminating knowledge (Putnam, 1975b, 228). Their\nknowledge fixes the referents of their use of ‘aluminium’\nand ‘molybdenum’.  Our deference to them as those people\nwho could tell us which things are aluminium and which are molybdenum,\nmeans that our referents of ‘aluminium’ and\n‘molybdenum’ are the same as theirs. \n\nThe modal and epistemological arguments concern the modal and\nepistemic properties of propositions of the form of (K). If\ndescriptivism were correct then there should be for each\nkind, C, a proposition of that form employing a\nmanifest property complex D, such that the proposition \nis analytic and hence both necessary and a priori. \nThe modal and epistemological arguments deny this. \n\nNote that the modal and epistemological arguments are most naturally\npresented in the material mode, concerning the objects themselves and\ntheir relations. (K) is in the material mode and we ask about its\nmodal status, by talking about certain stuff and asking whether it is\nor would be gold if it had such-and-such properties, and so\nforth. Likewise, mutatis mutandis, for the epistemological\narguments.  The semantic arguments differ in that they are presented\nin the formal mode, concerning the linguistic expressions in\nquestion. This is because we are asking what a term's reference or\nextension would be in certain counterfactual circumstances. To use an\nexample concerning a proper (singular) name, we start by imagining\nthat it turns out that Johannes Kepler had not been the first to\npostulate the laws of planetary motion, whereas it was an unknown\nstudent of Kepler's who did this first. Many people have no beliefs\nabout Kepler other that that he was the first person to postulate\nthose laws. If our story were true, would the name\n‘Kepler’, as used by such people, refer to the student or\nto the teacher? Our intuition, so anti-descriptivists maintain, is\nthat the name would still refer to the teacher, the man we (falsely)\nbelieved to be responsible for the discovery of the laws of planetary\nmotion. Yet, if the descriptivist account were correct for proper\nnames, then with respect to the people under consideration, their use\nof ‘Kepler’ would either refer to the student, or would\nfail to refer at all. \n\nBoth Putnam and Kripke take arguments of this sort to generalize to\nnatural kind terms. The best known of the semantic arguments as\napplied to natural kind terms is Putnam's Twin Earth thought\nexperiment (see\n Section 1.3.1).\n Putnam asks us to imagine that elsewhere in the universe there is a\nplanet exactly like Earth in virtually all respects, which we may call\n‘Twin Earth’. However, where on Earth we find\nH2O, on Twin Earth we find XYZ, a substance with a\nfundamentally different chemical structure from H2O, but\nwhich shares all its manifest properties (boiling and freezing points,\ntaste, odour, ability to support life, being the predominant\nconstituent of precipitation, seas, lakes etc.)  with\nH2O. Every inhabitant of Earth has a twin equivalent on\nTwin Earth. Twin Earthlings (at least those in the parts bearing a\ngeographical similarity to Earth's United States, Australia,\nJamaica, Pitcairn etc.) speak a language rather like English and use\nthe term ‘water’ in circumstances precisely analogous to\nour uses of ‘water’ on Earth, e.g., they say that their\nlakes and reservoirs are full of ‘water’. \n\nThe semantic Twin Earth argument now proceeds by asking what the\nextension of ‘water’ is, as used by some Earthling, and\nlikewise what the extension of ‘water’ is, as used by some\nTwin Earthling. Putnam's appeal to our linguistic intuitions is\nsupposed to yield the verdict that the extension of the Earthling's\nuse of ‘water’ includes all and only H2O\nwhereas the Twin Earthling's use of ‘water’ includes all\nand only XYZ. In support of this we may consider that this is the\njudgment we must come to if we Earthlings are not to deny what Earth\nchemists tell us, viz. that water is H2O, nor,\nsymmetrically, deny the Twin Earth chemists assertion,\n‘water is XYZ’. Nor will it do to gainsay our\nchemists judgment that water is H2O, given the\nassumption of the existence of XYZ. For that is tantamount to the\nsuggestion that (actual) Berzelius (the discoverer of the correct\nchemical formula for water) was not entitled to assert that water is\nH2O until he had ruled out the possibility of some\nsubstance other than H2O sharing water's manifest\nqualities. \n\nThe thought experiment is now almost in a position to claim the\nforegoing as a counterexample to descriptivism, for XYZ will satisfy\nany set of manifest properties that could be constitutive of the\nmeaning of ‘water’ as used on Earth. Yet the extension of\nthat term excludes XYZ. However, the reference to chemists\nknowledge made above reminds us that there is a difference between not\nonly the physical constitution of Earth and Twin Earth, but also a\ndifference between the psychological states of their inhabitants. For\n(some of) those on Earth believe ‘water is H2O’\nwhereas their Twin Earth counterparts believe ‘water is\nXYZ’.  Perhaps, at least for those speakers, those beliefs are\nalso constitutive of the meanings of the two terms ‘water’\n(Earth) and ‘water’ (Twin Earth). In order to exclude this\nresponse, Putnam asks us to consider the same comparison made in 1750,\nbefore any beliefs of this form were held. We now assume that there\nhas been no major change in the (cross-temporal) extension of\n‘water’ (Earth) since 1750. (That is to say, when David\nHume asked for a glass of what he called ‘water’, he was\nrequesting the same stuff as we are when we make a request using the\nsame term.) Since, as argued above, the extensions of\n‘water’ (Earth) and ‘water’ (Twin Earth)\ndiffer today, their extensions differed in 1750. But in 1750 the\ndescriptions associated with the word ‘water’ cannot\ndiffer between Earth and Twin Earth. This is because the molecular\nstructure of water was unknown in 1750, prior to the chemical\nrevolution (when phlogiston theory was replaced by Lavoisier's new\noxygen theory). Given that the molecular structure was unknown even to\nthe experts, the descriptive resources available to Earthians and\ntheir Twin Earthian counterparts were identical. Nonetheless, their\nreferences using ‘water’ differed. Hence, descriptions do\nnot suffice to fix reference. \n\nThe conclusions of the arguments given above include not only the\nfalsity of descriptivism as a thesis about the reference of natural\nkind terms, but also the more general truth of semantic\nexternalism.  The Earthling in 1750 and their Twin Earth\ncounterpart are supposed to be intrinsic physical duplicates. (There\nis a problem in that one would expect the twin to have XYZ in its\nblood stream, etc., not H2O, so the two are not perfect\nduplicates; but we can take it that this physical difference should\nnot affect the argument.) Although they are duplicates, the terms they\nuse have different extensions; likewise their thoughts have different\ntruth conditions. Consequently, the reference, extension, and truth\nconditions of a person's utterances do not supervene on their physical\nstate. These things are fixed, at least in part, by external\nconsiderations. We might retain a conception of the psychological such\nthat the psychological still supervenes on the physical; but then one\nwould have to deny that ‘thinking about water’\ncharacterizes a psychological state. Or, we must deny that the\npsychological state of a subject supervenes upon the physical state of the subject. \n\nIf descriptions do not fix extensions, and some external factor fixes\nextensions, then by what process are extensions fixed? Kripke does not \nintend to propose a new theory of reference fixing, although the outlines of\nsuch a theory are fairly clearly implied by what he says. His principal aim \nis to make the case for the Millian denotation-without-connotation view of \nsingular proper names, and then extend this (contrary to Mill's own \nopinion) to certain general terms also, including natural kind terms. \n\nThe Millian view may be called direct reference (Kaplan\n1977), since the reference of singular proper name is not mediated by\na connotation/sense/intension. The semantic value of such a name just\nis the individual to which it refers. Such terms are thus\nrigid designators—they denote the same object with respect to all\npossible worlds (Kripke 1980, 48). How does this view extend to natural kind \nterms? The answer is that the view does not transfer if we take the analogue \nof the denotation of a singular term to be the extension of a kind term. This is\nbecause presumably the extension of a kind term differs from world to world, \nsince the individual members of a kind, such as individual tigers and lumps \nof gold, are generally contingent entities. \n\nThe obvious route to an analogy between kind terms and singular direct\nreference is to focus not on natural kind predicates but on singular\nnatural kind terms (cf. first paragraph of\n Section 3\n above). We should regard terms such as ‘water’, \n‘gold’, ‘Rattus rattus’, etc. \nas denoting abstract individuals and objects (or some other \nkinds of entity that may be the constant recipient of reference\nacross worlds). Thus the direct reference view applied to such\nterms says that the semantic value of those terms just is those\nabstract individuals, and the claim that the terms are rigid\ndesignators is the claim that they denote the same abstract\nindividual, the same natural kind, with respect to all possible\nworlds. Rigid designation is a consequence of direct reference (but\nnot vice versa). (See Martí 2003 for a discussion of the relationship\nbetween Millianism, direct reference, and rigid designation. See also\nSullivan 2005.) \n\nTreating kinds as abstract individuals permits an analogue for natural\nkind terms to the natural story concerning the reference of singular\nproper names that emerges from Kripke's discussion. In the simplest\ncase, an individual receives a name in a naming ceremony, and the use\nof that name is transferred from speaker to speaker, preserving its\nreference through each transfer. Thus the reference of a later use is\ndetermined by tracing back the route of transmission to the original\nnaming ceremony. In the natural kind case, which is rather more of an\nidealization than the case of a concrete particular, the original\nnaming ceremony picks out a natural kind via an ostension of one of\nits samples. This is the so-called ‘causal’ theory of\nreference.  Note that ‘causal’ refers to the causal\ntransmission of the use of the name. (Although an ostensive reference\nfixing will be causal, the link between the kind (or its sample) and\nthe first use of the kind term could be secured by a reference-fixing\ndescription.  In such as case the reference-fixing description does\nmerely that; it does not supply a meaning (sense or intension). \n\nThus far Kripke's account of the semantics of natural kind terms\ntreats them very much on a par with proper names, suggesting that\nkinds are much like abstract individuals, being potential recipients\nof singular reference—Millianism has been extended from proper\nnames of individuals to natural kind terms. (Mill's own view of\n‘general terms’ was not Millian in this sense, but closer\nto a Fregean view.) Putnam gives a more elaborate account of the\nreference of natural kind terms, which apparently does not depend on\ntreating kinds as abstract individuals. According to Putnam, the\nextension of a natural kind term is fixed by ostending or otherwise\nidentifying a sample of the kind and appealing, explicitly or\nimplicitly, to a ‘same kind relation’. Thus the extension\nof ‘water’ includes all and only those things that bears\nthe same kind relation to some sample, which may be specified loosely,\nfor instance as ‘the watery stuff around here’ (where\n‘watery’ is defined in terms of the manifest\ncharacteristics of water, not in terms of ‘water’). (Note\nthat Putnam says ‘same liquid relation’, but that would\nnot provide the extension of a natural kind term, since it would\nexclude the gaseous and solid phases of water.) Putnam (1975a) thereby\nextends the notion of rigid designation to general terms, since (a)\nthe same kind relation is a cross-world relation, and (b) it is\nanchored to a specific, actual world sample. Consequently all samples\nof water in all possible worlds will bear the same kind relation to\none another. That this excludes XYZ depends upon its being the case\nthat a sample that does not share the ‘important physical\nproperties’ of our sample cannot be of the same kind. \n\nThe view that natural kind terms are rigid designators has\nconsequences for identity statements involving natural kind terms\n(e.g., “brontosaurus is apatosaurus”). The reason is that\nany identity statement relating two rigid designators is necessarily\ntrue. Hence identity statements involving natural kind terms express\nnecessary truths, even if knowable only a posteriori. Kripke\nregards theoretical identities such as ‘water =\nH2O’, where one of the terms is a description, as\ninstances of such a posteriori necessary identities. Such a\nclaim requires an argument to show that ‘H2O’\nis a rigid designator, since it is not a directly referring\nexpression. We may take ‘H’ and ‘O’ to\ndesignate hydrogen and oxygen rigidly. However, if the formula\n‘H2O’ just means ‘hydrogen and oxygen\ncompounded in the ratio 2:1’ one might wonder whether, if the\nlaws of nature are contingent, there might be worlds where hydrogen\nand oxygen are compounded in that ratio in such a way that the\nresulting compound does not belong to the same kind as H2O,\nand is not water. If that is possible, then\n‘H2O’ is not a rigid designator, and\n‘water = H2O’ is not necessary.  (As noted\nabove, Putnam's Twin Earth thought experiment does not establish the\nidentity of water and H2O—all it establishes is that\nbeing constituted of H2O is a necessary condition of being\nwater. In which case it is consistent with some instances (actual and\npossible) of H2O not being water.) Most discussions accept\nthat to count H2O as a substance it must be compounded of\nhydrogen and oxygen in the way that they are actually compounded. The\nrigid designation of simple, directly referring names and kind terms\nis often explained in terms of their having an indexical character. In\nideal cases where the name is introduced via an ostension of its\nintended referent, the designation is literal. In other cases\nindexicality is less apparent, as we see in the case of\n‘water’ where there is something like an implicit\nostension of ‘watery stuff around here’ (though\n‘water’ could not mean ‘watery stuff around\nhere’, since then the referent of ‘water’ would then be\ndifferent in an XYZ environment).  A similar implicit indexicality is\nfound in the theoretical specification of kind terms, which explains\ntheir rigid character also. \n\nThe Millian view applied to simple natural kind terms faces \nvarious problems. One of these problems concerns empty terms. \n‘Phlogiston’, ‘caloric’, \n‘ether’, ‘humour’, are all\nnatural kind terms that fail to refer to anything. Millianism \nimplies that there is no semantic difference between these terms \nat all. Surely ‘phlogiston does not exist’ \nand ‘caloric does not exist’ mean different things; \nLavoisier asserted the first and denied the second with apparent \nconsistency. The most common response to this problem is a retreat \nfrom pure Millianism for such terms. Some descriptive element \nis included in their semantics. \n\nThis need not be a full retreat to a Fregean view for two reasons. The\ndescriptive element may not suffice to pick out the kind (in the\nnon-empty cases)—the implicit historical ostension of a sample\nmay be necessary to fix reference. And the description itself may have\nnon-Fregean features—it may have an indexical component, for\nexample, a reference to the actual world, that a Fregean would\ndeny. The retreat from pure Millianism (and a partial vindication of\nMill's own view of general terms, which Kripke\nrejected) need not undermine the claim that kind terms are\nrigid designators. Rigid designation does not require direct\nreference; complex theoretical expressions, such as\n‘H2O’, may, as we saw, also be rigid\ndesignators. \n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that rigid designation for kind and\nother general terms faces a serious objection: rigid designation for\nkind terms is trivial (Soames 2002; Schwartz 2002; Martí 2004). Rigid\ndesignation requires that the object designated by a rigid designator\nbe the same in all worlds. That requirement rules out the extension of\na kind term as its designation, since the same kind may have different\nextensions in different worlds. On the other hand, regarding the\nextension as an abstract individual also faces difficulties. One might\ntake ‘Mary's favourite colour’ to designate different\ncolours in different worlds, and thus understood it is not a rigid\ndesignator. But we could take ‘Mary's favourite colour’ to\ndesignate (rigidly) an unusual abstract\nindividual Mary's-favourite-colour, which has violet things\nas its extension in the actual world, but turquoise things in another\npossible world and so on. This thought experiment suggests that it is\nalways possible to regard a general term as a rigid designator. One\noption for resisting this move is to deny that in every case there is\nsome entity for the term to refer to. There is no thing abstract or\nconcrete that is\nMary's-favourite-colour. Property terms may denote a natural\nproperty, in Lewis's (1986) terms a\nsparse property or they do not denote at all. Similarly, \nnatural kind terms denote genuinely natural entities that are likewise\n sparse or they fail to denote. \n\nAbove we saw that an identity statement conjoining two rigid\ndesignators expresses a necessary truth, one that may be knowable\nonly a posteriori. That follows simply from the definition of\n‘rigid designator’. We have also seen that natural kind\nterms are rigid designators. That seems simply to be a fact about the\nsemantics of natural kind terms. Consequently it looks as if a\nnon-trivial metaphysical fact—that there are necessary truths\nknowable only a posteriori—is a consequence of Kripke's\nsemantics for natural kind terms. Furthermore, when we consider\ntheoretical identities, such as ‘water is H2O’\nand ‘gold is the element with atomic number 79’ etc., it\nappears that we are being given a special kind of necessary truth, a\ntruth that it necessary because it specifies the essence of a\nkind. \n\nThe conclusion that we can derive metaphysical facts from semantic\nones has been regarded as highly questionable by many commentators.\nHow could facts about our use of terms lead to\nconclusions about the essences of things and kinds?\nFurthermore, the anti-descriptivist semantics involved is closely related \nto semantic externalism, but the latter need not imply essentialism, as Tyler\nBurge's social externalism shows (Burge 1979, 1986). Nathan Salmon\n(1982) argues that no non-trivial essentialist consequences can be\ninferred from a theory of reference. \n\nOne might take the view that the apparent derivation of a metaphysical\nconclusion from semantic premises is a sleight of hand, with hidden\nessentialist premises being smuggled into the argument. If one were to\nassume that ‘H2O’ is a rigid designator, one\nmight be accused of tacitly assuming metaphysical\nessentialism. However, one might alternatively take the view that\nsemantics and metaphysics are more intimately related. For\nexample, one might hold that the semantics itself makes certain\nmetaphysical assumptions, in which case the metaphysics would follow\nfrom the semantics, but innocently and for fairly trivial reasons. Note that a\nthoroughgoing Fregean descriptivism also has metaphysical\nconsequences, since it rules out essentialism. According to the view\nthat the correct semantics implies an essentialist metaphysics, the\nsemantic claim that ‘water’ is a rigid designator is\nitself metaphysically loaded. But this is not to say that Putnam,\nKripke, and other philosophers are smuggling in metaphysical\nassumptions. Rather, it is to say that competent users of the term\ntacitly make those assumptions. Putnam's Twin Earth thought\nexperiments make those assumptions explicit. Note that, as the above\ndiscussion has shown, while the thought experiments are normally\nexpressed in the formal mode—we ask whether XYZ would fall within \nthe extension of the term ‘water’ (Earth)—the essentialist \nconclusion can be reached directly by phrasing the same question in the \nmaterial mode: we ask whether XYZ would be water.","contact.mail":"ajb368@cam.ac.uk","contact.domain":"cam.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2008-09-17","date.changed":"2017-02-15","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-kinds/","author1":"Alexander Bird","author1.info":"http://www.alexanderbird.org/","author2.info":"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/tobin","entry":"natural-kinds","body.text":"\n\n\n\nScientific disciplines frequently divide the particulars they study\ninto kinds and theorize about those kinds. To say that a kind\nis natural is to say that it corresponds to a grouping that\nreflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests\nand actions of human beings. We tend to assume that science is often\nsuccessful in revealing these kinds; it is a corollary of scientific\nrealism that when all goes well the classifications and taxonomies\nemployed by science correspond to the real kinds in nature. The\nexistence of these real and independent kinds of things is held to\njustify our scientific inferences and practices.\n\n\n\nPutative examples of kinds may be found in all scientific disciplines.\nChemistry provides what are taken by many to be the paradigm examples\nof kinds, the chemical elements, while chemical compounds, such as\nH2O, are also natural kinds of stuff. (Instances of a\nnatural kind may be man-made, such as artificially synthesized\nascorbic acid, i.e., vitamin C; but whether chemical kinds all of\nwhose instances are artificial are natural kinds is open to debate.\nThe synthetic transuranium elements, e.g. Rutherfordium, seem good\ncandidates for natural kinds, whereas artificial chemical kinds, such\nas the entirely synthetic compound bismuth germanate,\nBi4Ge3OO12, which is used in particle\ndetectors, are, arguably, less obviously natural kinds.) The standard\nmodel in quantum physics reveals many kinds of fundamental particles\n(electron, tau neutrino, charm quark), plus broader categories such as\nkinds of kind (lepton, quark) and higher kinds (fermion,\nboson). Astronomy classifies the heavenly bodies: galaxies, for\nexample, can be either elliptical, lenticular, or spiral.\n\n\n\nSince kinds are revealed by science, a science can revise which kinds\nit holds exist: phlogisticated air was regarded as a kind until after\nLavoisier's chemical revolution. A science can even question a whole\ncategory of kinds. Before being superseded in this regard by the\nchemical elements, biological species were taken to be the best\nexemplars of kindhood. Yet now it is somewhat controversial to state\nthat species are natural kinds.  As the world changes, its kinds may\nchange too.  Rapidly mutating micro-organisms demand new\nclassification systems.  Kinds in the social sciences, such as\neconomics or sociology, are even more problematic, since the changing\nnorms and practices of individuals and societies may also be held to\nbe constitutive factors in kind membership, and these norms and\npractices may themselves respond to our classification of people into\nkinds. These examples are troublesome because there is\nsome tension between the existence of kinds and the mutability of the\nparticulars which are supposed to fall under those kinds. In the case\nof atoms or galaxies, the particulars under study are typically\nlong-lived and only slowly changing; viruses and economic structures,\non the other hand, are more dynamic.\n\n\n\nThis article divides philosophical discussions of natural kinds into\nthree areas: metaphysics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of\nlanguage. The metaphysics of natural kinds asks whether we should\nthink of our supposed natural kinds as genuinely natural.  And if they\nare, what are natural kinds?  And, finally, do natural kinds\nhave essences?  Philosophy of science is concerned with natural kinds\nbecause, as mentioned above, it is the use of natural kinds by the\nindividual (‘special’) sciences that generates our interest in them.\nSo we may ask, whether the kinds appearing in our best scientific\ntheories do indeed satisfy the theories of natural kinds proposed by\nthe metaphysicians.  Philosophy of language takes an interest in\nnatural kinds because basic issues are raised by the semantics of\nnatural kind terms.  For example, if we think of naming an entity and\ndescribing it as, semantically speaking, fundamentally different ways\nof talking about it, should we think of natural kind terms as\nfunctioning like names or like descriptions?\n\n\n\nThe principal metaphysical questions concerning natural kinds are\nthreefold. First, are the kinds that we think of as\n‘natural’ kinds genuinely natural?  Or are our\nclassification processes more anthropocentric than that? Secondly,\nwhat are natural kinds? Are natural kinds any sort of entity at all?\nAre they basic ontological entities or are they derived from or\nreducible to other entities (e.g., universals)?  Thirdly, do natural\nkinds have essences? As regards the first question, the general\nproblem is to determine which of the kinds to which science makes\nappeal, if any, correspond to real natural kinds—those existing\nin nature, so to speak—and which of these kinds are merely\nconventional—those whose boundaries are fixed by us rather than\nnature.  Then, if natural kinds are genuinely natural, what are they?\nAre there entities that are the natural kinds, and if so what can we\nsay about the nature of such entities? Are they irreducible,\nbasic, sui generis entities (alongside, for example,\nparticulars and universals) (Ellis 2001; Lowe 1998)? Or can they be\nreduced, say to universals (Armstrong 1978, 1997; Hawley and Bird\n2011) or to clusters of properties (Boyd 1991, Millikan 1999)? The\nthird question asks whether there are properties that might be\nessential for kind membership. Natural kind essentialists hold that\nnatural kinds have essences (Ellis 2001, 2002; Devitt 2008), where the\nessence of a natural kind is a property or set of properties whose\npossession is a necessary and sufficient condition for a particular's\nbeing a member of the kind. That fact is a so-called essential fact\nconcerning the kind; it is a fact that, in Fine's terms, stems from\nthe identity or nature of the kind (Fine 1994).\n\n \n\nA common view concerning our so-called natural kind classifications is\nthat there are genuinely natural ways of classifying things.\nIntuitively, to group all instances of the metal zinc together is to\nengage in a natural classification, whereas to group together Trajan's\ncolumn, the number two, and Julius Caesar is to classify things in an\narbitrary manner. The classifications ‘cars manufactured in\nGermany’, ‘culinary vegetables’,\n‘altars’ are not arbitrary, but neither are they natural,\nsince they reflect human interests. This view we call\nnaturalism. It is often called realism because of\nthe close affinity to scientific realism; indeed naturalism may be\nregarded as a consequence or component of standard scientific\nrealism. Scientific realists hold that successful scientific theories\nrepresent theory-independent phenomena. Thus the theoretical posits of\nscience reflect natural divisions in nature; for example, the periodic\nsystem for classifying the chemical elements reflects natural\ndivisions between the elements. However, since ‘realism’\nis also associated with ontological doctrines (e.g., realism about\nuniversals, modal realism etc.) it would be preferable to use weak\nrealism (or, as above, naturalism) to label the\nontologically uncommitted view that our classifications are often\nnatural.  (We will note below that not all natural classifications are\nclassifications into natural kinds.) \n\nNaturalism need not maintain that all the classifications we in fact\ntake to be natural are indeed natural. Sometimes scientists and others\nerr in the natural kinds they take to exist. There is no kind that is\nphlogiston or phlogisticated air. Many might suppose jade to be a\nnatural kind of mineral, but it is not because there are two distinct\nminerals called ‘jade’. (See LaPorte 2004, 94–100 and Hacking 2007b\nfor detailed discussions of jade.) Similarly, biologists now believe that\nreptiles do not form a natural kind. Naturalism is the view that\nthere are in fact natural divisions among things, so that when we\nattempt to make a natural classification, there is a fact of the\nmatter as to whether that classification is indeed genuinely\nnatural. \n\nAssuming that one is a naturalist about (some of) our classifications,\nwhat makes a classification into one of natural kinds? The following\nare often suggested criteria or characteristics of a natural kind\nclassification (some of which are more contentious than others): \n\nNaturalism about natural kind classifications contrasts with\nconventionalism (also called constructivism or\nconstructionism), the view natural kinds don't exist\nindependently of the scientists and others who talk about them. John\nStuart Mill puts articulates the contrast thus: “In so far as a\nnatural classification is grounded on real kinds, its groups are\ncertainly not conventional; it is perfectly true that they do not\ndepend upon an arbitrary choice of the naturalist” (Mill 1884,\nbk. IV, ch. II). While the sciences do, it appears, employ\nclassifications according to kinds, the conventionalist will maintain\nthat the purposes of scientists are just one species of interest among\nmany: others will include the interests of automobile enthusiasts, of\ncooks, and of religious people or sociologists of\nreligion. Conventionalists (constructivists, constructionists) deny\nthat any of our classifications, including those of science, are\nnaturally privileged forms of classification. The classifications of\nbotanists do not carve nature at its joints any more than the\nclassifications of cooks. \n\nWe may distinguish between weak conventionalism and strong\nconventionalism. Weak conventionalism asserts that our actual\nclassifications are not, or are very unlikely to be, natural. The\nprincipal ground for weak conventionalism is scepticism about the\nability of science to uncover the natural principles of\nclassification. We may attribute this reason for conventionalism to\nLocke. (Locke, 1690: III). It appears (although this is a matter of\ndebate) that Locke thought that if there were real essences of\nspecies, these would be found in the shared imperceptible\nmicro-structural properties of things, and that there may be such\ngenuinely natural species but that science was ill-equipped to do\nbetter than speculate about them. (Locke also held, employing\ncriterion 6 above, that there would be ‘gaps’ or\n‘chasms’ between genuine species but that observation\nshowed only smooth gradations between the kinds we actually employ,\nwhich therefore must be conventional.)  Strong conventionalism, however, goes on to deny even that\nconventionalism is forced upon us simply by ignorance. It denies that\nthere are any such natural divisions, known or unknown. Strong\nconventionalists claim that the differences and similarities that we\nattribute to things exist in virtue of, for example, the social\nfunction of the relevant concepts rather than in natural facts.  For\nexample, difference in gender is not a biological difference but a\ndifference in social role. The conventionalist treats natural kinds in\nthe same way. The chemical elements, biological species, quarks,\nneutrinos and bosons are equally constructed by the activity of\nscientists. The key claim is that natural kinds are constructed rather\nthan discovered. As Woolgar claims “there is no object beyond\ndiscourse” (1988, 73). Hacking (1999) argues against the strong version of conventionalism\n(which he terms ‘universal constructivism’). The point of social\nconstructivism is to reveal that some of our classificatory categories\nand practices though they may appear inevitable are actually\ncontingent and relative to the practice of classification in the\ncontext of social institutions and norms. However, according to\nHacking, some constructed categories reflect real divisions and so\nwe need not be constructivists in the strong sense. There is still\nroom to distinguish between constructed kinds that reflect real\ncategories and those that do not. For example, Hacking (1999, Ch. 5) distinguishes between\n‘child abuse’ and ‘satanic ritual abuse’.  Satanic\nritual abuse is a socially constructed idea, but not a social kind. In\nthe 1990s, there was an exhaustive investigation into satanic ritual\nabuse in Great Britain after a number of reported cases. However, an\nindependent commission claimed that none of the charges were\nsubstantiated by evidence. Thus, our constructed categories are\nsubject to empirical investigation. We must establish a referent class\nfor our constructed categories. For example and in contrast, a kind\nsuch as child abuse is considered real. The emergence of the category can\nbe traced to a definite time (1961) at a definite place (Denver) in\nthe discussions of paediatricians. Moreover, the reference of the\ncategory was abused children. This reference dynamically changed as\nthe idea became embedded in new legislation, incorporated in practices\ninvolving social workers, police, schoolteachers etc. (See Hacking\n1999, Ch. 5.) But, importantly real instances of the category were\nfound through empirical investigation.  \n\nThe chief claim made by all varieties of conventionalism is that facts\nabout the world are in some sense dependent on human beings, their concepts and\ntheir activities in society. The negation of this view, which we will examine\nin\n Section 1.3, is the claim that facts about the\nworld are independent of human beings, their concepts and their\nactivities, that is, that there are real independent natural kinds in\nthe world. The claim that scientific facts about the world\nare dependent on human activity has been analysed in\ndifferent ways by constructivists. Kukla (2000, Ch. 3) distinguishes\n(i) material, (ii) causal, and (iii) constitutive dependence. The\nfirst, and weakest, claim is material dependence, namely that\nscientific entities are constructed by the activities of scientists in\nthe laboratory. Chemical reactions are brought about by scientists in\nthe laboratory using purified chemicals in a controlled environment\n(Knorr-Cetina et al. 1983). The resultant kinds are merely the\nconstructs of this highly artificial environment, along with the\npragmatic interests of the scientists (i.e., what they are\ntesting for and the methodology they choose to use). However, it is\nclear that scientists still abstract from a complex reality and in\nsome circumstances the materials used are purifications of some\nnaturally occurring materials. Indeed, material dependence is a rather\nweak kind of conventionalism and could even be made compatible with\nsome versions of naturalism/realism (cf. Hacking 1983). Therefore, no general\nconclusion may be drawn about the natural world and its kinds, from\nthe fact that scientists study scientific kinds in a highly idealized\nand controlled setting. The second element in Kukla's three-fold\ndistinction is causal dependence, which occurs when the relevant facts\nare caused to be true by the fact that they are believed to be true\n(e.g. belief that there will be a run on the bank can cause a run on\nthe bank, Merton 1948).  Hacking's (1995) human, interactive kinds,\nsuch as person with multiple-personality disorder, may be regarded as\ninstances, where the kind and its members are brought into existence\nby the belief that there are such kinds and people do belong to\nthem. Lastly, the constitutive dependence thesis claims that\nconvention is constitutive of the physical facts. Plausibly,\nconventions exist in virtue of people holding that they do. Woolgar's\nconstructivism is of the type that treats all scientific facts like\nconventions in this respect.   \n\nDupré (1993) argues for promiscuous realism, the\nclaim that there are countless ways of taxonomizing the worlds into\nkinds. The structure of the world is vastly complex and can be\ncategorized in many different cross-cutting ways, according to the\ndifferent theoretical interests we happen to be pursuing. Nevertheless,\nDupré insists that his view is not conventionalist, but rather that he\nis committed to naturalism and realism about natural kinds. He accepts\nthat there are properties that natural kinds have in common, but denies\nthat these are intrinsic properties of kinds\n (cf. criterion 1 above).\n He also denies that there is a hierarchical\nstructure of natural kinds in the world\n (cf. criterion 5 above)\n and that kinds are categorically distinct \n (cf. criterion 6 above). \n\nDupré (1993, 28) argues that promiscuous realism about natural\nkinds reflects our classificatory practices within the context of both\ncommon sense and particular sciences. The kinds classified by common\nsense and scientific practice often cross one another. For example, in\ncommon sense we classify lilies as a certain kind of\nflower. However, in biological classification the genus\nLilium comprises over one hundred species, including bulbs such as\ngarlic and onions. Moreover, species with the name “lily”\nin common sense do not in fact belong to the lilium genus\nin biological classification (e.g., Calla Lilies and Canna Lilies). \nTherefore, common sense and biological science provide us\nwith pluralistic ways of taxonomizing lilies. Each is equally\nlegitimate, according to Dupré, depending on our interests. \nFurthermore, Dupré (1993, 38) argues that cross-classification occurs \neven within the context of a science. Taking the biological classification \nof species as an example, he argues that there are countless ways of \ntaxonomizing species, depending on the model of biological systematics \nthat is used (see\n Section 2.1 below). \n There are equally legitimate, objectively grounded ways of classifying \nnatural kinds. There is accordingly no unique way of carving nature at\nits joints; different systems of classification are equally\nacceptable, scientifically and metaphysically.  Realism about natural kinds is the view that there exist entities \nthat are the natural kinds. While naturalism about natural kind \nclassifications is a matter of there being natural groupings and\ndistinctions among things and as such has no ontological commitment,\nrealism is an ontologically committed view. Since ‘(weak)\nrealism’ is sometimes used to denote naturalism, we may\ndistinguish by using the term strong realism for the\nstronger, ontological, claim that the natural divisions between kinds\nreflect the boundaries between real entities; i.e. the difference \nbetween silver and gold is not just a difference between two natural groups of \nthing, but is a difference between two distinct entities silver \nand gold. \n\nThe traditional realism versus nominalism debate is an ontological\ndebate over whether in order to account for properties we need to\ninvoke a class of entity, universals (see Section 1.2 above). There is\nan analogous debate as regards natural kinds, whether in order to\naccount for our natural kind talk and our natural classifications, we\nneed a special sort of entity in our ontology. The natural kind\nnominalist may accept that there are genuinely natural\nclassifications, but will reject the idea that we should invoke any\nobject as a consequence. For example, the nominalist might take the\nworld to be made up of individuals, which can be classified as kinds\nin a natural way. But, the nominalist claims, there is no kind of\nentity beyond the individual instances of each kind. The (strong)\nrealist maintains that we cannot explain the distinction between\nnatural and non-natural classifications without appealing to certain\nentities, the natural kinds. The naturalism versus conventionalism\ndebate discussed in the preceding section asked whether there is a\ngenuine metaphysical difference between natural classifications and\nnon-natural classifications; it is not obvious that the naturalist,\nwho maintains that there is a metaphysical difference, is obliged to\nunderstand that difference in terms of an ontological category of\nentities that are natural kinds. The analogue in the debate over\nproperties is whether there is a metaphysical distinction between\nnatural properties and non-natural properties, between, in David\nLewis's terminology, sparse and abundant properties (Lewis, 1986).\nThere is no immediate contradiction in the position of a nominalist\nwho rejects universals, but who maintains that there is a metaphysical\ndifference between natural properties and other properties. The\nrealist in both cases argues that, ultimately, naturalism (about\nproperties and about classification) requires a commitment to entities\n(universals and natural kinds respectively). \n\nQuine is an example of a philosopher who accepts, to some extent,\nnatural classifications into kinds. He holds (1969) that kinds are\nsets, so he does think that there are entities that are kinds, and to\nthat extent he is a realist. That said, his realism is minimal, since\nsets are ubiquitous entities. Any coherent classificatory\nprinciple will determine a set of things thus classified, whether\nnatural or artificial. Thus the ontology of natural kinds does not of\nitself explain there being natural kinds. Quine regards \nthe notions of  kind and similarity as \n“substantially one notion” (1969, 119) but denies that it\nis straightforward to give a definition of one in terms of the\nother. He does consider defining relative similarity thus: a\nis more similar to b than to c iff a and \nb share more properties than a and c do. \nBut this will work only if properties are less abundant than sets \nare (since any two things are jointly members of any number of sets). \nAnd Quine regards such a notion of property as no clearer than the \nnotion of kind.  \n\nQuine opens his discussion of natural kinds by asking “what\ntends to confirm an induction?” (cf.\n criterion 2)\n (1969, 114). With Goodman's new riddle of induction and Hempel's\nparadox of confirmation in mind, Quine answers that it is the\nsimilarity or sameness of kinds between instances that permits an\ninduction: two green emeralds are more similar than two grue emeralds\nwhen one of them is green and the other blue. It is the “dubious\nscientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of\nkind” (1969, 116) that prompts the discussion alluded to\nabove. An intuitive notion of similarity is used in our ordinary\ninductions. And the force of Darwinian processes gives us some reason\nto think that we have evolved an innate similarity space that\ncorresponds to some natural similarities. At the same time, natural\nscience, which developed from these primitive inductions, supported by\nsimilarities, is able to reveal deeper similarities that may\ncontradict superficial similarities. For example, our strong sense of\nsimilarity concerns things of the same colour, but science tells us\nthat there is no deep similarity among things of the same\ncolour. Quine thinks that in due course science will obviate the need\nfor a general notion of similarity or kind: in each area of science\nmore specific notions will take the place of the generic notion; this\nis a sign of the maturity of a branch of science. For example, in\nzoology we may replace talk of the similarity between two animals by\ndiscussion of the historical proximity of their closest common\nancestor. \n\nQuine's conception of natural kinds is liberal. Not all sets are\nnatural kinds, but any set whose members share a natural property are\na natural kind. So the set of white objects is at least a candidate\nnatural kind and Quine asserts that positively charged objects form a\nnatural kind. One might wonder whether an up quark, an uranium\nnucleus, a hydronium ion, a charged water droplet, and a balloon that\nhas been rubbed on someone's jumper all belong to one kind. The\nliterature on natural kinds (cf. Mill 1884) has tended to adopt a more\nrestricted conception of kinds, although articulating that conception\nis not straightforward. This question is related to the link that\nQuine draws between kinds and what it is that confirms induction. If\none adopts the narrower conception of kinds, then one will hold that a\nlaw such as ‘positively charged objects repel one another’\ndoes not concern kinds at all, but nonetheless may be confirmed by\ninstances of objects that are positively charged repelling one\nanother. So the real answer to “what tends to confirm an\ninduction?” is not “natural kinds and their\ninstances” but is “natural properties and their\ninstances”. A further reason for taking this view is that\ninductions often concern relations (such as the repulsion between two\nobjects). But we do not suppose that objects that enter into a natural\nrelation form a natural kind, nor that there is a natural kind of\nordered sequences of objects satisfying a given natural relation. \n\nFollowing Quine, some realists have expanded upon his intuition that a\nnatural kind's members share a natural property by counting \nfamilies of such properties that are contingently clustered in\nnature (Boyd 1991, 1999a; Millikan 1999). These families of properties \ncluster together over time either because the presence of some properties \nin the family favours the presence of others or because there are underlying \ninternal mechanisms and/or extrinsic contextual mechanisms which tend to \nsecure the co-occurrence of the properties. A natural kind is any such \nfamily of co-occurring properties that may be employed in inductive inference \nfor the purposes of scientific explanation. Cluster kind realists will \nreadily concede that, depending on the case, environmental pressures may \naffect and alter the set of properties associated with a kind over time. \nTherefore, in such cases, none of the properties themselves \nneed be individually necessary for kind membership. \n\nBoyd considers biological species to be paradigmatic natural kind \nclusters (1999), where the clustering is due to a \nhomeostatic mechanism. Homeostatic property clusters occur\nwhen mechanisms exist that cause the properties to cluster by ensuring\nthat deviations from the cluster have a low chance of persisting; the\npresence of some of the properties in the cluster favours the presence\nof the others. A homeostatic mechanism thereby achieves\nself-regulation, maintaining a stable range of properties. In the case\nof species, the homeostatic mechanisms may be intrinsic (e.g. gene\nexchange within a population or developmental factors) or extrinsic\n(e.g. a species's evolutionary niche provides common selective\nfactors). Since individuals inherit their basic characteristics from\ntheir parents, and very few people are taller than 2.5m, we can expect\nthe next generation to contain few people of that height. Height can,\nhowever, be affected by environmental factors; a mutation can cause\noffpring to have genes different from their parents that might cause\ngreater than usual height, and malfunctioning of the pituitary gland\ncan cause an excess of growth hormone.  So there can be individual\ncases of excessive height.  But they will remain rare because such\ngigantism and acromegaly are accompanied by serious complicating\ndisorders and often result in premature death. Consequently, these\nindividuals are less likely to reproduce than others. Even greater\nextremes of height (e.g. 4m) are just not possible, since the same\ndevelopmental factors would prevent the individual from being viable\nat an earlier stage in life.  \n\nColouration across a species is often uniform when it is a camouflage\nagainst predation. The more specific the ecological niche occupied,\nthe more uniform will colouration and other features be. Deviations\nwill lead to decreased fitness and will be selected against. Obligate\nmutualistic symbiosis often provides very specialized ecological\nniches; consequently certain key properties must be present in order\nfor an individual to survive.  Certain beard worms, such as Riftia\npachyptila, live at ocean floor thermal vents and have no\ndigestive tract; instead they supply hydrogen sulphide and methane to\nbacteria in their trophosomes, which oxidise the hydrogen sulphide and\nmethane on behalf of the worm. As a result the worm cannot lack any\nproperty essential for the survival of the bacteria to which it is\nhost.  Such homeostatic mechanisms do not preclude deviations from the\nstandard combinations of properties—mutations do occur, for\nexample. Homeostasis just means that usually such mutations will not\npersist. The rare benevolent, or even merely neutral, mutations may\npersist and flourish, in which case there will be variation and\nchange.  Environments may change, perhaps locally, also leading to\nvariation and change (e.g. the famous peppered moth). Consequently, it\nwill not always be the case that property P in a homeostatic property\ncluster F is a necessary condition of an individual belonging to the\nrelevant kind.  \n\nIn such cases, the boundaries of the natural kind are vague. \nCluster kinds nevertheless do form a kind\n (criterion 4 above).\n Members will have at least some properties in common\n (criterion 1). \n Since the emergence of cluster kinds is not entirely random and a \ncausal-historical account can be provided in virtue of stable homeostatic mechanisms, \ncluster kinds are sufficiently robust to support induction\n (criterion 2) \n and perhaps even laws of nature in some cases\n (criterion 3).\n Conversely,\nbecause the boundaries between natural kinds are vague, a cluster kind realist\nwill reject the claim that natural kinds are categorically distinct \n (criterion 6).\n She may be neutral on whether they always form hierarchies\n (criterion 5).\n That said, not all clusters need exhibit the flexibility and\nvagueness of these biological, homeostatic cases. In other cases \nthe clustering may be directly due to the laws of nature. Thus the laws\nof physics rule out fractional nuclear charge, with the consequence\nthat the chemical elements are kinds that have clearly defined\nboundaries and nuclear charge is a necessary and sufficient condition\nof kind membership. \n\nNatural kind realism may be understood as an analogue of realism about\nuniversals. A further question is whether these are simply analogues\nor in fact related positions.  Perhaps natural kinds just are (a\nspecies of) universals or are reducible to universals. Within realism,\nthat reductionist view can be contrasted with natural kind\nfundamentalism, which holds that not only are there natural\nkinds (as entities), but also that natural kinds find a basic and\nsui generis place in our ontology. We illustrate three\npositions within naturalism about natural kinds: (i) naturalism\nwithout (strong) realism; reductionist realism; fundamentalist\nrealism.   \n\nAccording to David Armstrong (1997, 67–8) “The kinds mark\ntrue joints in nature. But it is not clear that we require an\nindependent and irreducible category of universal to accommodate the\nkinds”. Armstrong's view is naturalistic, since there are\ngenuine natural divisions; but he is also resistant to realism. If\nthere were natural kinds they would be universals. But the properties\nshared by all and only the members of a kind will typically be very\ncomplex. For example, he considers whether there is some description\nof human DNA. There may be, but it would be too complex to qualify as\na genuine universal. And there is no reason to suppose that this\ncomplex universal would do any causal or nomic work. So there is not\nsimply an identity between natural kinds and a subcategory of\nuniversals, the natural kind universals (e.g., the universal of\nbeing gold, or of being a human)—according to\nArmstrong's argument there are no natural kind universals. He does\nconcede that the case is stronger for basic kind universals, such as\nelectronhood, where a few properties (the electron's mass, charge, and\nspin) are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for kind\nmembership.   \n\nHawley and Bird (2011) argue that natural kinds are complex\nuniversals.  A complex universal is a universal whose parts are\nuniversals (just as a complex particular is a particular whose parts\nare particulars). In the case of the electron the fundamental\nuniversals (the electron's mass, charge, and spin) do combine to form\na complex universal.  Since an universal is wholly located\nwhere the universal is located, every entity that instantiates\nelectronhood also instantiates its component universals, the\nelectron's mass, charge, and spin. Not every collection of universals\nconstitutes a natural kind, just as not every collection of\nparticulars constitutes a natural (complex) particular.  The facts\nthat explain the clustering of properties explain why these universals\ncompose a complex one. Not every complex universal is, like\nelectronhood, precise.  Some are vague, and this fact can accommodate\nthe indeterminacy of kind constitution implied by Boyd's view of the\nclusters in the case of biological kinds.   \n\nLike Hawley and Bird, E. J. Lowe takes natural kinds to be entities\n(1998, 2006a, and 2006b Other Internet Resources). Thus Lowe is a\nnatural kind realist.  Furthermore, he takes natural\nkinds—substantial universals in his\nterminology—to constitute an irreducible ontological category\n(one category in his four-category ontology).  Hence he is a natural\nkind fundamentalist. Lowe argues that recognizing the ontologically\nfundamental distinction between substantial universals (natural kinds)\nand non-substantial universals (properties) accounts for the laws of\nnature in a manner that, while avoiding the problems of a regularity\naccount, may nonetheless do without Armstrong's second order relation\nof necessitation, itself a relational universal (Armstrong 1983,\n75–110). Consider the law that planets travel in ellipses.\nAccording to Lowe's account, this should be understood as a matter of\nthe kind planet being characterized by the\nproperty travels in an ellipse. (One might query whether all\nlaws can be given this form and so whether the fact that some general\ntruth is a law should be explained this way. For what makes planets\ntravel in ellipses is the fact that they have mass and hence little to\ndo with their being planets. For example, Kepler's law is an\napplication of Newton's laws, but the latter concerns quantities\n(mass, distance), which should be understood as universals not\nkinds.)  As in Lowe's ontology, natural kinds play a fundamental role in\nthe ontology of Brian Ellis (2001, 2002). For Ellis the term\n‘natural kind’ covers three hierarchical categories:\nnatural kinds of objects (substantive kinds), natural kinds of\nprocesses and events (dynamic kinds), and natural kinds of properties\nand relations (property kinds). The chemical elements and compounds\nare substantive kinds; the different chemical reactions are dynamic\nkinds; a tetrahedral molecular structure is a (structural) property\nkind (whose species include the particular tetrahedral structures of\nmethane, carbon tetrachloride, silicon tetrafluoride and so forth).\nEllis is uncommitted on whether the dynamic kinds are independent of\nthe other two types of kinds; but these are independent of one\nanother. Each kind is a universal, and the three categories of kind\ntherefore form three categories of universal. Thus the substantive\nkinds—the familiar kinds of thing and stuff—are\nuniversals, but these are not reducible to property universals. Ellis\nnotes that laws of nature have a hierarchical structure: Kepler's laws\nof planetary motion are an application of Newton's laws.  He argues\n(2001, 90) that the only satisfactory account of this is fact that\nnatural kinds also exist in hierarchies.  \nDo natural kinds have essences? When discussing kinds and essences we\nneed to distinguish two quite different claims. The first claim is\nthat the kind a particular belongs to is essential to that particular:\nif a belongs to kind K, then it is an essential\nproperty of a that it belongs to K. The second claim\nis that the kinds themselves have essential properties: for each kind\nK there is some property Φ of the kind such that it is\nessential to K that Φ(K). What is the logical\nrelation between these two claims? The first claim may be strictly\nconsistent with the denial of the second, but it may be difficult to\nmotivate the first without having reason to accept the second.  Would\none think that some object's nature requires it to belong to kind K\nwithout thinking that there is some distinctive (essential) property\ncharacteristic of all Ks?  The second claim, essentialism about kinds, does not obviously\nimply the first, individual essentialism. To see this, consider the\nfollowing two cases that would seem to show that the latter does not\nimply the former. The first case is chemical/physical. A nucleus of\nneptunium-239 may undergo beta decay, in which one of its neutrons\nemits an electron leaving a proton. As a consequence the nucleus now\nhas one more proton and so is a nucleus of neptunium no longer but is\nnow a nucleus of plutonium. This description is consistent with the\nclaim that it is essential to neptunium that nuclei of neptunium atoms\nhave 93 protons whereas it is essential to plutonium that its nuclei\nhave 94 protons.  But one may also claim, as the description\nimplicitly suggests, that one and the same nucleus persists through\nthis transformation.  If that is so, then a particular has retained\nits identity while undergoing a change of kind. That kind essentialism\ndoes not entail essentialism of kind membership is also demonstrated\nby a second, biological, example. According to Mayr's biological\nspecies concept, a species is a reproductively isolated breeding\npopulation. Thus a new species can be created by the advent of\nreproductive isolation, which will typically split existing\npopulations (Matthen 2009). And so the existing organisms in at least one (and\narguably both) of the newly isolated (sub-)populations will belong to\na new species. And if species are natural kinds, this is an example of\nparticulars changing their kinds. But this account of species is\nconsistent with the view that species have essences (LaPorte 1997,\n2004, 11–12). (As a matter of fact, most essentialists accept\nthat an object's kind is essential to it. The point being advanced\nhere is that this claim does not follow immediately from the claim\nthat kinds have essences.)  It has been widely held that essentialism, and natural kind\nessentialism in particular, is a consequence of the semantic arguments\nconcerning reference put forward by Kripke (1980) and Putnam\n(1975a). These arguments support semantic externalism, the view that\nthe reference of a speaker's term can depend on facts external to the\nspeaker herself (e.g. facts concerning prior uses of the term).\nHowever, Salmon (1979, 1982) has argued persuasively that only trivial\nessentialism can be inferred from such arguments; stronger\nessentialist theses are derived only on the basis of unstated\nessentialist premises. For example, consider the following argument,\nreconstructed by Donnellan and discussed in Salmon (1982,\n161–75):  (Salmon 1982, 166) \n\nP3, however, is not free of non-trivial essentialist import.\nAccording to Salmon, deriving essentialism via the theory of reference\nis question-begging. Nonetheless, the fact that essentialist\nconclusions seem so plausible may be taken as evidence that there\nexist strong essentialist intuitions, and the arguments from Kripke\nand Putnam can be framed in non-semantic terms and thereby motivate\nessentialism directly—indeed many of Kripke's arguments\nare not framed in semantic terms at all. \n\nSeveral of Kripke's exemplary cases concern theoretical identities;\nthese are typically identities of the form C = T,\nexpressed using a common name for a kind, ‘C’,\nand a technical identification of the kind, ‘T’,\ntypically thereby telling us what that kind is. Examples:\nlight is a stream of photons; water is H2O; lightning is an\nelectrical discharge; gold is the element with atomic number 79. This\nmight give the impression that Kripkean essentialism is just a matter\nof the necessity of identity. However, in several of his discussions\nKripke does provide separate, independent arguments on the one hand\nfor the (necessary) necessity of being T for being C\nand on the other hand for the (necessary) sufficiency of being\nT for being C. In general, where K is a\nkind and P is some property, arguments for\n□∀x(Kx→Px) can be\ndecoupled from arguments for\n□∀x(Px→Kx). \nFor example, in his discussion of gold, Kripke argues that something\nthat is superficially like gold in appearance but lacks the property\nof having atomic number 79, would not be gold.  This establishes that,\nof necessity, having atomic number 79 is necessary for being gold, but\ndoes not show that possession of this property is sufficient for being\ngold.  Similarly, argues Kripke, if we were to discover a population\nof animals with the appearance of tigers but which turn out to be\nreptiles, we would deny that such creatures are tigers.  Being\nmammalian is necessarily a necessary condition of being a tiger, but\nof course not a sufficient condition \n\nPutnam's (1975a) Twin Earth thought experiment, in a non-semantic\nguise, leads to a similar conclusion. We imagine there is a planet,\n‘Twin Earth’, exactly like Earth in all readily observable\nrespects.  Every person and thing on Earth has a twin equivalent on\nTwin Earth.  However, there is no H2O on Twin\nEarth. Instead, there is a liquid that shares the manifest properties\nof water (e.g., its being colourless, tasteless, odourless, good for\ndrinking, etc.). This liquid is composed not of H2O\nmolecules but of very different molecules to which we assign the\nmade-up formula ‘XYZ’.  Despite its superficially\nwater-like properties, intuitively XYZ is not water.  What prevents\nXYZ form being water is the fact that XYZ is microstructurally\ndifferent from H2O. If intuition is reliable in this\nrespect, then (i) possessing water’s superficial properties is\nnot sufficient to make something a sample of water, and (ii) being\ncomposed of molecules of H2O is necessary for something's\nbeing a sample of water. (For more on Putnam's Twin Earth thought\nexperiment, see Section 3.2.3.)  \nIt is natural to use the expression ‘the essence of\n…’, which implies sufficiency as well as necessity:\npossession of the essence of K suffices for membership of\nK, as well as being necessary for it.  According to the\nforegoing, not all the arguments of Kripke and Putnam establish what\nthe essence of some kind is, rather they establish only what\nwe may call a partial essence, conditions that are necessary\nbut not sufficient. This is clear in some other of Kripke's\narguments. Thus it is only a partial essence that someone originates\nwith the gamete (sperm and egg) from which they in fact originate,\nsince they might have a monozygotic (identical) twin who has the same\norigin. A further question is whether there is a full essence\n(the essence) for everything that has a partial essence. \nThe fact that such arguments show only that F is an\nessential property of K means that they are invulnerable to\ncomplaints that not everything with F is K. For\nexample it is sometimes complained that water cannot be essentially\nH2O for the following reasons (a) water is a liquid,\nwhereas a substance comprised of H2O can exist as a solid\nor a gas; (b) a single H2O molecule is not a sample of\nwater because it does not have the properties we can ascribe to\nsamples of water (such as a temperature); (c) water is not simply\nH2O but is a polymer-like substance held together by\nhydrogen bonds. These observations are consistent with the claim of\nPutnam's argument that necessarily all water is composed of\nH2O molecules. \nThe arguments so far considered show that the superficial properties\nassociated with a kind are, in those cases, not sufficient for kind\nmembership, and so some further property (often a microstructural\nproperty) is a necessary condition.  Kripke also provides arguments\nthat show that many of the superficial properties typically associated\nwith a kind are not even necessary.  Kripke examines Kant's claim that\nit is a priori that gold is a yellow metal (Kripke 1980,\n118). Let us imagine that the yellow appearance of what we have always\ntaken to be samples of gold is just an optical illusion. Intuitively,\nwe would conclude that we had previously erred in thinking that gold\nis yellow—we would not conclude that there is no\ngold. Likewise, one might ask whether animal species are characterized\n(necessarily) by superficially available qualities, for example,\nwhether a tiger is, by definition, a large carnivorous quadrupedal\nfeline, tawny yellow in colour with blackish transverse stripes and a\nwhite belly (Kripke 1980, 119–121). Again, we may consider that\nthese features of the individual animals we have held to be tigers are\nin fact illusory; that those individuals and others of the same\nspecies are, for example, three–legged but that an optical\nillusion made us think otherwise. This suggests that satisfying a set\nof readily observable ‘superficial’ properties is not\nnecessary for membership of the tiger kind. \n\nThe foregoing arguments from Kripke lead to the conclusion that the\nrelevant kinds are not characterized of necessity by the readily\nobservable properties of their instances. They do not show what does\ncharacterize those kinds. Kripke takes the view that, in most cases,\nit is certain microstructural properties that determine the\nnature of these natural kinds, as evident in his endorsement of the\nidentities: ‘water is H2O’; ‘gold is the\nelement with atomic number 79’, ‘light is a stream of\nphotons’. Such essential properties of kinds are features,\ntherefore, that may be unknown even to competent users of a relevant\nkind concept.  Consequently, these are essences that, when known at\nall, are known a posteriori.\n\n \n\nWhile the arguments just considered suggest a microstructural essence\nfor the chemical and physical kinds considered, they do not have the\nconsequence that every natural kind must have a microstructural\nessence. Kripke regards material individuals as having historical\nessences. In the light of cladism in biology, one may regard biological\ntaxa as having historical essences also, and this is consistent with\nthe general picture given to us by Kripke and Putnam,\neven if they themselves once thought that biological kinds had\nmicrostructural essences (McGinn 1976; Kornblith 1993, 111; LaPorte 2004, 64).\nCladism is the most commonly accepted system of biological\nclassification that groups organisms according to their shared\nphylogenetic ancestry. Cladism has replaced the Linnean hierarchical\nsystem of biological classification where organisms were grouped\naccording to their shared morphological characteristics  (see\n Section 2.1 below).  \nKripke does not distinguish ‘essential property’ from\n‘necessary property’.  Fine (1994) notes that the claim\nthat P is a necessary property of X is not the same as the\nclaim that P is an essential property of X: the latter implies the\nformer but the former does not imply the latter.  The arguments for\nessentialism discussed above do not note this distinction and move\nquickly from claims about necessity to claims about essence: having\nshown that necessarily anything that is gold is made up of an element\nwith atomic number 79, Kripke concludes that having atomic number 79\nis an essential property of the kind gold. Fine's point may not be an\ninsuperable obstacle to establishing essentialism via the arguments of\nKripke and Putnam. For it may be held, as Fine holds, that essences\nconcern the nature or identity of things.  One may then argue that the\narguments of Kripke, Putnam, and others do appeal to intuitions\nconcerning the nature and/or identity of natural kinds, and so the\ninferences to essentialism from claims about necessity are legitimate\nin these cases.\n \n\nThe Kripke–Putnam arguments for essentialism are, in effect, direct\nappeals to intuition. For Ellis and Lowe, the dialectical basis for\nessentialism is that essentialism is a core part of what they each\ntake to be the optimal metaphysical system. Ellis (2001, 145–50)\nregards his essentialist metaphysics as supported by his argument that it\nyields a stronger argument for scientific realism. In particular, for\nEllis the essences of natural kinds explain the laws of nature: laws\nare grounded in the world's natural kind structure, which includes not\nonly natural kinds of thing but also natural kinds of process and\nevent. Above it was mentioned that for Lowe (2006, 144) laws concern\nnatural kinds; by contrast, for Ellis laws are grounded in essential\nfacts about kinds. As a consequence, the laws of nature are\nmetaphysically necessary. This has the advantage of explaining what\nnatural necessity is (it is just metaphysical necessity), but at the\ncost of denying the intuitive contingency of laws. Lowe, on the other\nhand, holds that laws can be grounded in the contingent possession of\nproperties by kinds, and so need not be metaphysically necessary. \n\nIn conclusion we note that some anti-essentialists argue that there is\nno non-question begging way of motivating the appeal to\nessences. Mellor argues that the existence of essences in essentialist\naccounts of natural kinds is simply a gratuitous assumption. (Mellor\n1977, 309). Others use examples from the empirical sciences such as\nbiology to argue that essentialism is too limited to capture the kinds\nwe find in the special sciences (Dupré 1981, 1993).  In\nparticular, essentialist accounts of kinds seem to construe them as\nimmutable or static, whereas examples from the natural sciences\ninclude mutable and dynamic kinds, as we see in section 2.1 below. \n\nOur interest in natural kinds is generated by the fact that the\nparticular sciences make frequent use of what, on the face of it, seem\nto be natural kinds.  So an important question is whether the kinds of\nthe special sciences (e.g. psychology, economics, biology, chemistry\nand so on) do in fact satisfy the conditions laid out by\nmetaphysicians for natural-kindhood (Fodor 1974; Dupré 1981,\n1993; Millikan 1999; Ellis 2001). And to the extent that they do not,\ndoes that show that these kinds are not genuine natural kinds after\nall, but are something different?  Or does it show that the\nmetaphysicians need to revise their theories of natural kindhood?  The\nmetaphysical issues raised by the special sciences vary.  For example,\nphilosophers of biology ask whether species would be better understood\nas being individuals rather than natural kinds.  The\nso-called species problem (Ghiselin 1974, 1987, 1997; Hull\n1976, 1978; Kitts and Kitts 1979, LaPorte 1994) asks which are the\nappropriate criteria to use in order to decide which particular\nspecies an organism belongs to. This is particularly challenging\nbecause species evolve over time, which makes it difficult to determine\nwhen we should recognize a new species and distinguish it from a distinct,\nolder ancestor species or from distinct sister species. Furthermore,\nthe criteria advanced by most of the various species concepts on offer\ninvolve relational rather than intrinsic properties of organisms. So\neither species are not natural kinds or the view that kindhood is\nfixed by the intrinsic properties of things must be revised. In the\nphilosophy of chemistry, a key question is whether chemical kinds\nprovide as much support for microstructuralism as the stock examples\ndiscussed by metaphysicians suggest (Hendry 2006; LaPorte 2004;\nNeedham, 2000, 2002; Van Brakel, 2000). Microstructuralism is the view\nthat chemical kinds can be individuated solely in terms of their\nchemical microstructure. Chemical elements would appear to support\nmicrostructuralism since atomic number is sufficient to individuate\nany element. However, the extension of this view to more complex\nchemical structures (such as molecules) is much discussed in the\nliterature.  In the philosophy of mind, the ontological status of\npsychological kinds has been questioned in the light of modern\nadvances in neuroscience (Churchland 1981; Fodor 1974). In particular,\naction is causally overdetermined by mental and neurophysiological\nkinds. If neuroscience can provide a sufficient account of action,\nthen the role of our common-sense folk psychological concepts, such as\nbelief and desire is called into question. Maybe there are no\npsychological natural kinds corresponding to those concepts.  Natural\nkind realists reject the conventionalist view that in all cases the\nboundaries of ‘natural’ kinds are drawn by human interests.  But is\nit plausible to draw a distinction between genuinely natural and\nconventional kinds when it comes to the social sciences?  In\nparticular, is it important that, via a feedback effect, human\nperceptions of what kinds there are can have an effect on the\ncomposition and even existence of those kinds (Hacking 1995)?  \n\nOne central issue in the philosophy of biology concerns the nature of\nbiological species, which have traditionally been held to be\nparadigmatic natural kinds. The traditional Linnean binomial system of\nclassification groups organisms into species and genera in virtue of\ntheir overall physical similarities (their morphology). However, only\nthe taxa species and genus were held to reflect \nontological divisions in nature. The higher taxa (e.g., family, \norder, class, phylum, kingdom) are merely\nconventional divisions, which are of heuristic use in biology.  \nBiologists offer many different species concepts, which disagree on\nhow species are individuated; indeed the different species concepts\nwill disagree about the extensions of species and about the number of\nspecies. For example, according to the interbreeding species concept\n(e.g. Mayr 1969), species are groups of interbreeding natural\npopulations, that are reproductively isolated from other groups. \nAlternatively, according to the phylogenetic approach to species \n(e.g. Cracraft 1983), species are classified according to common \nancestral descent. These two approaches carve species differently. \nSome phylogenetic species fail to be interbreeding species. For example, \norganisms that reproduce asexually may nevertheless have a common descent. \nThey will be grouped together as species by the phylogenetic\napproach, but not by the interbreeding approach. (Cf. Ereshefsky 1998\nfor a discussion.) Philosophers question whether the multiple divisions used by\nbiologists reflect an ontological pluralism in the world or, alternatively, whether \nthere is a privileged conception of species that captures ontological\nreality. Furthermore, some philosophers argue that species are not to\nbe considered as natural kinds at all, insisting instead that species\nare individuals.  Despite its long history and intuitive appeal, the conception of\nspecies as natural kinds is difficult to sustain while also\nmaintaining a traditional view of what a natural kind requires: a set\nof intrinsic natural properties that are individually necessary and\njointly sufficient for a particular to be a member of the kind. The fact that lineages evolve more or less gradually over time and\nthat this process leads to new species and other taxa, has two\nconsequences: first, that species are spatio-temporally restricted in\nthe sense that the species to which a particular organism belongs\ndepends on its being related to a specific lineage; and secondly, that\nthe characteristic properties of a species may change over time. The first consequence of evolution implies that, contra the\ntraditional view, intrinsically identical organisms may not be members\nof the same species: a cat-like organism independently evolved on a\ndistant planet would not be a cat.  (Cf. Dummett 1973: 144 ‘even\nif creatures exactly like men arose from dragons’ teeth, they\nwould not be men, because not children of Adam’.) The second consequence implies that intrinsic similarity is not\nnecessary for membership of the same species. There exists a high\ndegree of variation in intraspecific morphology and genetic\nmakeup. While members of kinds need not be intrinsically identical\n(e.g., there may be isotopic variation between samples of a chemical\nelement), there will nonetheless be certain distinctive intrinsic\nnatural properties common to all members of the kind (e.g., nuclear\ncharge in the case of atoms of the same element). That, it is claimed,\nis absent for species. Thus there is no genetic material or sequence\nof genes that all and only members of the species Drosophila\nmelanogaster possess, and likewise for all other species. Nor can\nwe turn to larger-scale phenotypic properties (which may nonetheless\nbe hidden), since evolutionary change may eliminate such features\nwithout a new species arising (Sober 1980). Furthermore, gradual\nchange, even through speciation, means that species will not be\ncategorically distinct (criterion 6), which\nfor Ellis (2001) is an additional reason to conclude that species are\nnot natural kinds. \n\nThese problems for the thesis that species are natural kinds may lead\none to conclude that classification by species does not correspond to\nany real division of things in nature any more than the higher taxa\ndo. Darwin himself expressed this kind of conventionalism, in taking\nspecies to differ only in degree from varieties on the one hand and\ngenera and higher taxa on the other hand: \n\n(Mishler 1999 contains a modern version of this view.) The rejection\nof species as natural kinds need not lead to the rejection of realism\nabout species altogether. Indeed, one can commit to species realism in\na specific way: Ghiselin (1974, 1987, 1995, 1997), Hull (1976, 1978,\n1980, 1987), and many other philosophers and biologists accept the\nclaim that species are individuals, not kinds. This claim\nwould appear to explain why, it is said, there are no serious\ncandidates for biological laws, at least concerning members of particular species\n(Beatty 1997). Individual organisms are\nparts of species, not members of the species-kind. \nSpeciation creates a new individual (or possibly two new individuals and \nthe cessation of the preceding species-individual) but not a new kind. \nOrganisms that are parts of the same species may share common features, \nbut that is not what makes them parts of that species. Rather the explanation \nis the reverse: because the organisms are parts of the same species \nthey are parts of the same lineage and so they will probably \n(but not inevitably) share features in common. \n\nDoes individualism about species imply that species are not natural\nkinds? One might suspect as much, but perhaps the two views are\ncompatible. LaPorte (2004), for example, believes that one can\nconsistently hold both views. Where one theorist will see a\nspecies-as-kind and an organism-as-member of that kind, another\ntheorist will see a species-as-individual and an organism-as-part of\nthat kind. And so even allowing that individualism is correct, we can\nconstruct a kind: if S is a species-individual and x\nis an organism, then x is a member of the\nspecies-kind S* iff x is a part\nof S.  For example, an individual organism (a radish plant)\nis a part of the species-individual Raphanus Sativus if and\nonly if it is a member of the species-kind Raphanus Sativus\n(LaPorte 2004, 16). LaPorte's view does entail giving up on certain\nfeatures that natural kinds are often thought to have; one cannot\nstill hold that kind membership is necessarily intrinsic, since\n‘being a part of y’ is not an intrinsic property\nand parts of the same entity do not necessarily have any intrinsic\nproperties in common. For that reason, it is also less plausible that\nkinds must play a role in laws of nature. \n\nIf one retains the view that species are natural kinds one must\nconfront the fact that a plethora of species concepts are available and\nas seen earlier, these species concepts do not always delineate the\nsame species. For example, Mayr's (1969) \nbiological species concept (BSC) regards a species as a\ngroup of “interbreeding natural populations that are\nreproductively isolated from other such populations” (1969,\n26). The phylogenetic species concept (PSC) holds that a\nspecies is “the smallest diagnosable cluster of individual\norganisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and\ndescent” (Cracraft 1983, 170).  These definitions are not\nperfectly coextensive. (For a detailed discussion of species concepts\nsee the entry on species.)  \n\nThis diversity may be thought to support conventionalism about\nnatural kinds\n (Section 1.1.2).\nBut supporters of naturalism about our classifications \n (Section 1.1)\n will deny that the dispute in systematics reflects an indeterminacy in\nthe natural world. A monist will hold that one of the\nexisting systems is a superior account of the natural world. A\ncommitment to one of the different systems over another will result in\na different ontological account of species. The most prevalent system\nof classification in contemporary systematics is cladistics, which\nclassifies organisms phylogenetically, in virtue of shared derived\nfeatures or an organism's place in the genealogical tree. \n\nAn alternative view to monism, motivated by the variety of\nspecies concepts, is pluralism, which holds that the different\naccounts of species in systematics reflect equally legitimate ways \nof carving up nature subject to our pragmatic and theoretical interests. \nHowever, these systems do carve nature in genuinely natural ways. The \nspecies and higher taxa that they delineate reflect real features of \nthe world from the point of view of different theoretical interests. \nPluralism (Kitcher 1984; Dupré 1993; Ereshefsky 1992) is the weakest \nform of realism about kinds in the philosophy of biology. \n\nKripke (1971, 1972) and Putnam (1975a) use animal kinds as examples of\nnatural kinds for which a posteriori essences can be\nfound. There is some implication that these essences are\nmicrostructural, intrinsic properties, which will be, of necessity,\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient for an entity to be a\nmember of a kind. However, if species are individuals, then it is not\ntrue that species may be individuated on the basis of the intrinsic\nproperties of their members. The various species concepts tend to\noffer relational criteria of species membership (see above).\nAccording to the BSC, for example, membership of a species depends on\nrelational properties, such as membership of a certain population and\ninterbreeding. Alternatively, the PSC refers to shared descent. However, Kripke (1980) himself argues that a person's parentage is\nessential to them. If that is so, then if individual S is\ndescended from\nN, then S is necessarily descended\nfrom N. McGinn (1976) suggests that this extends to species\nalso.  LaPorte (2004) argues that essentialism holds with respect to\nfacts relating individuals, species, and other taxa to the higher taxa\n(genus and above) within which they are nested. These taxa are clades,\nthat is to say kinds defined by shared descent from a common ancestral\ngroup: an individual or group that is a member or part of clade is\nnecessarily a member or part of that clade. Thus biological kinds\n(species, genera, etc.) do have essential properties, and these are\nhistorical rather than intrinsic properties.  So one option for biological essentialism is to drop the\ntraditional view that the natural properties that are essential for\nmembership of a natural kind are intrinsic:\nnatural, extrinsic (relational) properties can play this role\n(Okasha 2002). The categorical distinctness criterion must be dropped\nalso. On account of the problems for natural kinds in biology as well as\nthe development of modern chemistry, chemical kinds have replaced\nbiological kinds as the paradigms of natural kinds. The chemical\nelements and chemical compounds appear to be bona fide\nnatural kinds. We refer to chemical kinds in laws, explanations, and\ninductions: that a certain item is iron explains its behaviour and\nthat behaviour is predictable; that iron objects are magnetizable is a\nlaw of nature (criteria\n 2\n and 3\n above). Moreover, we can induce that all iron is magnetizable, from the\nobservation of particular instances of iron objects that are magnetic. And chemical\nkinds appear to obey the categorical distinctness requirement: iron is\nclearly distinct from its neighbours in the periodic table (manganese\nand cobalt); no elements are intermediate kinds \n (criterion 6\n above). Furthermore, microstructural essentialism seems to be a prima\nfacie plausible option for chemical kinds: it is essential\nto iron that something made of pure iron is constituted by atoms that\nhave precisely 26 protons in their nuclei. \n\nMicrostructuralism in the philosophy of chemistry is the thesis that\nchemical kinds can be individuated solely in terms of their\nmicrostructural properties (Hendry 2006). As exemplified above by the\ncase of iron, the chemical elements provide paradigmatic kinds that may\nbe individuated microstructurally, since the atomic number—the number\nof protons in the nucleus—suffices to identify the element. It is true\nthat macro-level chemical and physical properties can also serve to\nindividuate chemical elements, and in the nineteenth century chemists\nwere able to individuate elements without knowing what we do about\nnuclear structure. However, it is held that atomic number has\nexplanatory priority: the number of protons in the nucleus, and hence\nthe nuclear charge, explains the structure of electrons surrounding\nthe nucleus, which, in turn, explains the chemical behaviour of the\nelement. \n\nThe microstructuralist can extend this approach from elements to\ncompounds. Compounds are identified principally by their constituent\nelements. Thus carbon dioxide is that compound of carbon and oxygen\nwith the molar proportion 1:2. In more detail, molecules of carbon\ndioxide consist of two oxygen atoms and a single carbon atom. The\npractice of identifying a chemical compound only by its composing\nelements was the norm in chemistry, until the discovery of isomerism\nby Friedrich Woehler in 1827. Isomers are distinct compounds that\nnonetheless share the same constituent elements in the same\nproportion. Thus fulminic acid and cyanic acid may both be expressed\nin terms of constituents in the empirical formula CHNO, but their\ndistinct chemical and physical properties identify them as different\nsubstances. The explanation of isomerism (and many other facts in\norganic chemistry), provided first by August Kekulé and\nArchibald Scott Couper, is the fact that certain compounds exist in\nmolecular form and these molecules have internal structure. Thus\nmolecules of isomers have the same atoms in different spatial\narrangements, e.g., CHNO may be arranged as H–O–C≡N\n(cyanic acid) or as H–C=N–O (fulminic acid). Isomerism\nmeans that specifying the chemical composition alone is not sufficient\nfor classification. The microstructure of a compound concerns not just\nthe elemental atoms in its molecules, but also their spatial\narrangement. \n\nNeedham (2000) and van Brakel (2000) have argued that compounds such\nas water are dynamic structures whose natures cannot be given in\nstatic accounts of their composing elements. Molecules of\nH2O are polar, with the consequence that the\nelectropositive hydrogen atoms in one H2O molecule will\nbond with the electronegative oxygen atoms in another H2O\nmolecule, such bonds being hydrogen bonds with the result\nthat in liquid water H2O molecules will form polymer-like\nchains known as oligomers.  The hydrogen bonds and the\nconsequent chains are responsible for the fact that water is liquid at\nroom temperature (whereas compounds with similarly sized molecules,\nsuch as hydrogen sulphide, methane, and carbon dioxide, are all\ngaseous at room temperature). These oligomers are constantly forming,\nbreaking, and reforming. The rate of such changes and the mean length\nof such oligomers are dependent on the thermodynamic context (in the\nextreme case, an ice crystal may be considered as a single such\noligomer, the crystal structure being dependent on the fixed, strong\nhydrogen bonds). Thus, say Needham and van Brakel, we cannot consider\nwater to be just a compound composed of a collection of H2O\nmolecules. Furthermore, anything that is to be water must be a\nmacroscopic entity, since only macroscopic bodies can bear\nthermodynamic properties, such as melting point, which we use to\nidentify water. Hence, a single H2O molecule is not\nwater. \n\nThese considerations need not undermine the microstructuralist claim.\nMany chemical kinds may exist in any of the solid, liquid, and gaseous\nstates while remaining the same substance, including water. But,\nwater vapour will not possess the oligomers present in liquid water\nand ice. So their presence, however characteristic of water in the\nliquid and solid phases, cannot be a necessary feature of all bodies\nof water. Above we saw that atomic number is regarded as the essential\nfeature of an element because it explains the other characteristics an\nelement has. Likewise, the structure of the H2O molecule \nexplains why it is a strongly polar molecule, which in turn explains\nwhy it tends to form oligomers. As regards thermodynamic properties,\nHendry (2006) points out that we say that water is contained in a\nperson's body, without thinking that this water has any thermodynamic\nproperties. More generally, thermodynamic properties can be\nascribed only to entities in equilibrium, but not all bodies of water\nare in thermodynamic equilibrium or even nearly so. We may very well\nuse such thermodynamic properties in identifying something as water,\nbut that does not mean that it is in virtue of such properties that\nsomething is water. \n\nHendry (2006) points to a potentially more difficult problem,\nwhich is that any liquid sample of water, however pure, contains not\nonly H2O molecules but also H3O+\nand OH− ions. These ions cannot be regarded as impurities, \nsince they are also an inevitable consequence of the polar structure \nof the H2O molecule. Hendry's solution is to regard \nH2O molecules as the constituents of water in rather\nthe same sense that eggs and flour are the constituents of a\ncake—they go into making the cake but need not retain exactly\nthe form they started with. Water is made from bodies of\nH2O molecules, but not all those retain precisely that\nstructure. \n\nThe taxa in the classical Linnean system of biological classification\nare nested in a hierarchy, as required by\n criterion 5 \n in Section 1.1. But, in certain respects, chemical classification fails to \nmeet this requirement. The phenomenon of allotropy is exhibited when \nan element exists in two or more distinct forms. The element carbon has\nseveral, including the allotropes diamond and graphite. Tin\nhas two allotropes at room tempreature, white tin (which is metallic) and grey tin (which\nis non-metallic). Some instances of tin will fall into one category and\nother instances will fall into the other category. Consequently,\nclassification by element and classification by metal or non-metal\ncannot be combined hierarchically. \n\nSuch cross-cutting classifications are frequently found in organic\nchemistry, where compounds can be classified according to their\nso-called functional groups. Functional groups are specific\ncombinations of atoms within a molecule that will cause the molecule\nto engage in certain reactions and to have other physical and chemical\nproperties that are characteristic of that group. For example,\nalcohols are organic compounds containing a hydroxyl group −OH\nbound to a carbon atom of an alkyl group or derivative of an alkyl\ngroup. Alcohols undergo characteristic reactions such as\nesterification. Since other hydrogen atoms in an alcohol molecule may\nbe substituted by another functional group, the resulting molecule\nwill have properties characteristic of both functional groups and may\nbe classified accordingly. Benzyl alcohol,\nC6H5CH2OH (or BnOH), is obtained from\nmethane, CH4, by replacing one hydrogen atom by an\nalcohol-forming hydroxyl group, −OH, and another by the phenyl\ngroup −C6H5 (Ph) (the phenyl group plus\nthe CH2 from the methane is the benzyl group, i.e.\nBn is PhCH2). Thus benzyl alcohol may be classified either\nas an alcohol, or as an aromatic benzene derivative, since it\nparticipates in the characteristic reactions of the latter, such as\nelectrophilic aromatic substitution or hydrogenation of the benzene\nring. If the hierarchy requirement on a system of natural kinds is\ncorrect, then not all these cross-cutting classifications pick out\nnatural kinds. The claim that the hierarchy requirement is too\nstringent for scientific kinds has been defended by Khalidi (1998) and\nTobin (2010b).  \n\nOne may have to deny that metals form a natural kind, and that\nclassification by functional group is a classification into natural\nkinds. (Not all classifications need to be into kinds in order for them\nto be useful.) Note that in both cases, there is room for vagueness.\nSome elements, such as germanium and antimony, are classed\nas metalloids, with characteristics between metals and non-metals. The\nimpact of a functional group diminishes with the size of the molecules\nof which it is a part and in the presence of competing functional\ngroups, and so in certain cases, classification according to functional\ngroup will be vague. Such vagueness falls foul of the categorical\ndistinctness requirement\n (criterion 6 \n above). \n\nDo the different sorts of mental state form natural kinds? We\ncertainly think that our minds make a difference to what happens in\nthe physical world and we think that we act because\nwe have certain beliefs, desires, hopes, fears etc. The distinctive\nexplanatory roles performed by these different states in folk\npsychology certainly suggest that these beliefs, desires, hopes and\nfears constitute distinct mental natural kinds. Note that in\nconsidering natural kinds in chemistry, biology, and physics we have\nthought of kinds principally as kinds of thing (kinds of stuff,\norganism, particle, etc.) whereas we are now considering the\npossibility of certain kinds of state. (Ellis (2001, 2002) \nis clear that he does not limit natural kinds to kinds of thing, but \nincludes kinds of state and process also.) A Cartesian dualist holds\nthat mental states are distinct from any physical state of the\nsubject, as they are states of an immaterial thinking substance. The\nproblem for dualism however is in finding the ground of the difference\nbetween fearing, believing, hoping etc. i.e. what difference is there\nto the immaterial substance when a subject is in different mental\nstates? In principle this problem could be avoided by the dualist if\nmental kinds are regarded as immaterial substances (Shoemaker 2003).  \n\nThere are many ways to understand mental natural kinds, and theories\nhave been proposed by eliminativists, identity theorists,\nfunctionalists and many others. We will treat each of these in turn. \nPhysicalists hold that the differences in mental kinds relate somehow to \ndifferences in states of the subject's brain, or, more generally, \nthe subject's body. At one extreme, the (type) identity theory of mind\nholds that types of mental state are identical with types of brain\nstate. If so, we may expect the kinds of psychology to be identical with\nthe kinds of neuroscience.  \n\nThe identity theory faces the problem of multiple\nrealizability—the idea that it is possible for physically\ndiverse creatures to be in the same kind of mental state. It is\npossible, for example, that Martian neurophysiology might be entirely\ndifferent from that of humans while Martians nonetheless have the same\nkinds of mental state as humans have; if a Martian's body is injured,\nit writhes, groans, and avoids the causes of such injuries—the\nMartian is in pain (Lewis 1980). Indeed it is possible that cognitive\nscientists might design a machine that is capable of higher-level\nthought (implemented on, for example, a silicon architecture). It is\neven possible that the same mental kinds be realized by distinct\nneurophysiological systems in one and the same organism over\ntime. Consequently, it is at least an open empirical possibility that\nmental kinds may correspond to a widely disjunctive and heterogeneous\nset of neurophysiological kinds, and hence that there is no one-to-one\ncorrelation between them.  \nEliminativism argues that the prima facie failure to\nstraightforwardly reduce mental kinds to neurophysiological kinds\nought to lead to the elimination of mental kinds altogether\n(Churchland 1981, 1988). This is to claim that there are no mental\nnatural kinds. On this view, the mental kinds in folk psychology are\ncomparable to the kinds delineated by discredited folk theories from\nthe past e.g., the humours in medieval medicine. The underlying\nprinciple of medieval medicine was the balancing of so-called four\nhumours. According to the theory, illness was caused by an imbalance\nof these four humours.  From the point of view of modern medicine this\ntheory is radically false and so the only option is to eliminate the\nhumours as putative natural kinds. Analogously, mental kinds ought to\nbe eliminated in favour of those kinds uncovered by recent research in\nneuroscience. Eliminativists agree that human beings have invented a\nvery successful methodology for describing their mental lives. This\nmethodology is folk psychology, a common sense theory of how mental\nstates are causally related to human action.  However, folk\npsychology, they argue, is merely a heuristic device invented by human\nbeings in order to make the explanation of behaviour easier.  The\nposits of the theory are not real natural kinds. Once a better\nexplanation of human behaviour in terms of neurophysiological kinds is\navailable, then mental kinds will be eliminated.  \n\nFunctionalists argue that the irreducibilty of mental kinds is\nnevertheless compatible with a token-token identity theory (Fodor\n1974, 1997). Mental kinds are not type-identical with neurophysiological\nkinds (i.e. there is not one type of neurophysiological\ncorrelate for each type of mental state, so we cannot make general\nidentity statements such as “pain = C-fibres\nfiring”). A Martian and I, both in a state of fear at a\ntime t, may be in different physiological\nstates. Nevertheless, my token instance of the kind fear at time\nt will be identical with the token physical state in my brain\nat that time. Likewise, the token instance of the Martian's fear at\ntime t1 is identical with his token physical state.  \n\nIt has been argued by Kim (1992, 1993) that multiply realized mental\nkinds of the latter kind can in principle be locally reduced to their\nrealizing states. Mental kinds are analogous to mineral kinds such as\njade, which can be locally reduced to\nnephrite or jadeite depending on the sample. Importantly, a sample \nthat does not consist of either nephrite or jadeite is simply not jade. \nNevertheless, there is an important disanalogy between mental kinds and \nlocally reduced kinds like jade. If you want a sample of jade, then it \nmust be composed of either jadeite or nephrite. In other words, if \nJ (jade) is realized by the disjunction P (Jadeite) or \nQ (Nephrite), then it is metaphysically necessary that the \nproperties a thing has qua J are either properties it\nhas qua P or properties it has qua Q. \nSo, something with all the other qualitative properties of\njade in another possible world, but which lacked the essential \nproperties (i.e., jadeite or nephrite) would simply not be \nan instance of jade. \n\nIn contrast, for the functionalist (Fodor 1997) mental kinds are\ndefined by their functional roles, rather than by the essential\nproperties of the neurophysiological kinds that realize them. It does\nnot matter which physical kind does the realizing, be it silicon\nchips, neurons, C-fibres or whatever. Rather, what matters is\nthat the psychological state (e.g., pain) plays a certain functional\nrole. The whole point of multiple realizability is that it is easy to\nimagine some possible world where a token mental kind is realized by\nsilicon chips, C-fibres firing, or whatever. So, a mental\nkind is not essentially realized by a certain neurophysiological kind;\nrather it plays the same functional role independently of what\nunderlying kind is realizing it. This appears to\nviolate criterion 1) for natural kinds (in\nSection 1.1.1); namely, that members of a natural kind should have\nsome natural properties in common. \n\nThe functional role of mental kinds is explained by some\nfunctionalists in terms of the modularity of the mind (Fodor\n1983). This is the claim that the mind has different innate modules\nwhich play a certain functional role. These modules are\ndomain-specific, operating only on certain kinds of inputs. So, for\nexample, there will be distinct modules for mental tasks like\nmind-reading, speaker recognition and facial recognition. The\nfunctional role associated with mental kinds might for example be\ngiven an evolutionary account in terms of adapted modules (Cosmides\nand Tooby 1992). On this view, mental kinds in folk psychology are\nsuccessful for the purposes of the explanation of human behaviour\nbecause they refer to the functional modules of the mind. Such views\nmay motivate emergentism. One interpretation of the\nemergentist account of mind is that there are emergent mental kinds\nthat have no straightforward correlation with the kinds identified by\nneuroscience. Nor are mental kinds and neurophysiological kinds either\nidentical to or subkinds of one another; consequently emergentism is in\nconflict with the (contested) taxonomic hierarchy criterion\n(criterion 5).  (See the entry on\n emergent properties.) \n\nThe type-identity theory, if true, might seem to motivate essentialism\nabout psychological kinds, by analogy with other theoretical\nidentities (cf.\n Section 1.3.1\n and\n Section 3.3).\n Kripke (1980), however, \ndenies that his arguments concerning other theoretical identities\napply here. Let us say that (slow) pain for us humans is correlated\nwith the firing of C-fibres. If this were a genuine \ntheoretical identity, then in all possible worlds, when someone\nundergoes C-fibre firing, then they are in a state of pain.\nBut it seems plausible that there could be worlds where C-fibre \nstimulation is not accompanied by any painful sensation. If there are \nsuch worlds, then the theoretical identity implies that such a world \nis one where people can be in pain without having any painful sensation; \nindeed the pain might yield a pleasant sensation. Kripke regards this \nas counterintuitive. The concept of pain is necessarily tied to the \nphenomenal nature of the pain sensation, whereas the concept of gold \nis not tied to the colour yellow. Consequently, there is no identity \nbetween pain and C-fibre firing (nor any other physical state); \nlikewise there is no physical essence to pain. A posteriori natural \nkind essentialism fails in this case.  Recently, there has been some discussion of whether mental concepts\nare themselves natural kinds. The claim that concepts form a natural\nkind has been accepted by philosophers of psychology and cognitive\npsychologists alike (Margolis, 1994, 1995; Fodor, 1998, 2008). Recent\nliterature has argued against that assumption (Griffiths 1997; Machery\n2005, 2009; Piccinini and Scott 2006). Griffiths 1997 has argued that\nindividual and familiar concepts such as emotion do not correspond to\ngenuine natural kinds, and should therefore be eliminated from\nscientific vocabulary. Machery's (2009, Ch. 3) heterogeneity\nhypothesis claims furthermore that the class of concepts do not\ndelineate a homogeneous class; the kind ‘concept’. Rather, they divide\ninto several distinct kinds that actually have little in common. Thus,\nit is a mistake to assume that there are many general properties of\nconcepts, and that a theory of concepts should attempt to describe\nthese. In general, then the notion of concept is not part of an\nadequate taxonomy of our mental representation. The question as to whether there are social kinds has a long\nhistory. In the sociology of science, functionalists such as Durkheim\n(1897) have argued that there is empirical support for the autonomy of\nsocial facts. For example, statistical analysis shows that suicide\nrates differed radically depending on social factors, (e.g. religious\nbackground, gender, marital status etc.) This analysis led to the\npossibility of social science being taken in a quantitative\ndirection. Even if every individual commits suicide as a result of\npsychological factors, the statistical facts about the\nreasons for suicide and how they change with place and\nover time are distinctly social. One question then is whether one\nshould be naturalist about such social facts. If so, how could\nnaturalism be reconciled with the claim that social facts are dynamic\nand changing in so far as they concern human beings in social\ninteractions? \n\nBecause social kinds are distinctly anthropocentric, some theorists\nclaim that the only plausible view we can hold is some form of\nconstructivism about them. Hacking (1995, 1999) argues that in social\ncontexts the object of classification itself changes in being\nclassified. The fact that the people being classified are conscious\nmakes for dynamic interactions between the classification and the\nclassified.  The latter may resist or embrace certain classifications\n(‘child abuser’, ‘hip’) and modify their\nbehaviour accordingly.  This leads to an change in the extensions of\nthe relevant kind concepts. Furthermore, as the extensions change, the\ncriteria for membership may change also. Many of our classifications\nin social science are evaluative. A social situation looks deviant\nfrom the norm and people make an evaluative judgment about\nthis. Sometimes this means that people passively accept what experts\nsay about them, and see themselves in that light. But feedback can\ndirect itself in many ways. Alternatively, some people seek to\nreclassify themselves. Thus, classification in social science is\ninteractive. Hacking argues that this is in marked contrast to the\nindifferent kinds that are found in natural science.  An electron is\nindifferent to being classified as an electron. Pace Hacking, Khalidi (2010) argues that in fact the\ncontrast between natural and social kinds is not so stark: even many\nchemical kinds would not have been instantiated in the world were it\nnot for the fact that a scientist conceived of it and acted on that\nconception. So in both cases the existence of a classification scheme\ncan cause changes to the extension of the kinds in question. The\ndifference between natural kinds and social kinds is a difference of\nthe degree of control we have over the object of classification. In\nthe chemical domain, for example, the nature of the phenomena\nthemselves imposes greater restrictions on the kinds that we can\ncreate.  (See also Cooper 2004.) \n\nMuch recent interest in natural kinds has been stimulated by debates\nconcerning the semantics of natural kind terms, originating especially\nwith the work of Saul Kripke (1972) and Hilary Putnam (1973,\n1975a). Typical natural kind expressions fall into one of two\ncategories: predicates (is water, is gold, is a\ntiger, and\nis an oak) and singular terms (water,\ngold, the tiger, and the oak).  In this\nsection we survey some of the debates concerning the meaning of such\nterms, what—if anything—they refer to, and how they do\nso. Many discussions focus on the predicate kind terms, often\nconsidering them alongside other general terms, taking the principal\nissue to be the relationship between a natural kind term and its\nextension. Such an approach will appeal to conventionalists, but it may appeal also\nto those naturalists who are nominalists about natural kinds or\notherwise hostile or indifferent to (strong) realism about natural\nkinds. However, we shall see that there may be reason to take the\nsingular kind terms as primary. (One difference between Putnam and\nKripke is that while Putnam tends to focus on the natural kind\npredicates, Kripke's arguments are centered primarily on the singular\nnatural kind terms.) Kripke and Putnam attacked a pair of related\nviews about natural kind terms: descriptivist semantics (the meaning\nof such a term is a description satisfied by all and only members of\nthe kind) and internalism (the meaning of such a term, the relevant\ndescription, is fully grasped by competent users of the term so that\nwhat fixes the extension of the term supervenes on what is internal to\nthe user).  Putnam's rejection of descriptivism is a component of his\nargument that ‘meaning ain't in the head’ whereas for\nKripke the goal is to show that natural kind terms are much like\nproper names, for which, he argues, a descriptivist semantics\nfails. Members of the extension of a natural kind share properties in\ncommon.  If descriptivism were true, then one would reasonably believe\nthat those properties would be the properties mentioned in the\ndescription with the possible addition of further properties nomically\ncorrelated with those.  But if descriptivism is false, it would appear\nthat the characteristic properties of a kind will not typically be\nknowable a priori, but must be uncovered by scientific investigation.\nIf so, then those properties, being necessary conditions of kind\nmembership but discoverable only a posteriori, look very much\nlike real essences.  At first sight it seems then that the\nsemantic arguments of Kripke and Putnam have metaphysical\nconsequences.  This is highly controversial (Salmon 1979, 1982). Do\nthe arguments of Putnam and Kripke really support an essentialist\nmetaphysics? Or do they illegitimately assume it? Or do they, more\ninnocently, show that we as users of natural kind terms implicitly\nassume such a metaphysics? \n\nThe modern tradition of natural kinds begins with J. S. Mill (1884)\nwho talked of ‘Kinds’ (the term ‘natural kind’\nis traced by Hacking (1991a) back to Mill's contemporary, the logician\nJohn Venn (1886)). According to Mill, typical singular (individual)\nnames such as ‘Scott’ denote their referents but\nlack any connotation, that is to say the names do not imply\nany attribute.  Some singular names do have connotation as well as\ndenotation, for example ‘the author of Waverley’.  A\ngeneral name, such as ‘white’, denotes all the things they\nhold of (its extension) while also connoting the attribute they all\nshare in common. Natural kind terms are a special case of general\nterms in this respect \n\nThe idea that something such as a connotation determines the extension\nof a term is elaborated in Frege's notion of sense\nand, later, that of intension. Frege and later philosophers have\napplied this view to singular proper names, and views of this sort\nfall under the general heading of ‘descriptivism’.\nRussell is also often referred to in this regard, but it should be\nremembered that Russell's view is that grammatically proper names \nare abbreviations of quantified expressions and so do not have any\nreferring role at all (and so a fortiori they do not have a \nreferring role that is meditated by a connotation/sense/intension).\nSome neo-Fregeans nevertheless deny that Fregean senses should be\ncashed out as descriptions (e.g., McDowell 1977; Evans\n1982).  \n\nMill's descriptivism implies that for each natural kind term there is\nan associated set of properties such that for some item to be a member\nof that natural kind, it should possess those properties—these\nare properties that describe objects belonging to the kind in\nquestion. Implicit in Mill and explicit in Frege is the claim that\nthese descriptions are constitutive of the meaning of the term in the\nfollowing way: someone who understands the term adequately will be\nin a position to grasp a priori that something falls under\nthe kind term if and only if it satisfies that description. For this\nreason the relevant properties will normally be readily observable\nproperties of things; they will not be properties associated with the\nkind only by a posteriori investigation. For example, as mentioned\nabove, Kant held the view that it is a priori that something\nfalls under the kind term gold only if it is a yellow\nmetal. Because the extension-fixing meaning of a term is thus\ngraspable a priori this view is internalist about\nextension fixing. The extensions of kind terms of any two subjects\nwith the same internal mental states will have (in the same context)\nthe same extensions. \n\nPutnam (1973, 1975a) and Kripke (1972) reject the descriptivist view of\nnatural kind terms. Putnam's principal aim is to undermine internalism\nabout reference and extension (“meanings just aint in the\nhead”). Kripke's aim is first to restate a Millian view of \nproper names (they denote without connoting) and then to extend that view \nto natural kind terms. (‘Millian’ will be used to characterize \nany account of the semantics of a term that claims that it denotes without\nconnoting, even when applied, pace Mill, to kind terms.)\nAccording to Kripke, Mill was right about proper names but wrong about\nkinds; Millianism—Mill's denotation-without-connotation\nview—is right for both sorts of term. Salmon (1982) categorizes\nKripke's arguments against descriptivism for singular terms under the\nheadings ‘the modal arguments’, ‘the epistemological\narguments’, and ‘the semantic arguments’—this \ncategorization is useful also for the corresponding arguments against \ndescriptivism for general terms. \n\nThe modal arguments against descriptivism take the following form.\nLet C be some natural kind and D be some complex set\nof readily observable properties that would, on a descriptivist view,\nbe most naturally regarded as providing the content of the description\nthat constitutes the meaning of ‘C’.  Now\nconsider: \n\nSince D is constitutive of the meaning of\n‘C’, (K) should be analytic and so necessary.\nThe descriptive view would thus be refuted either by (i)\nmetaphysically possible instances of the kind C that do not\npossess the property complex D or by (ii) metaphysically\npossible items that do possess the property complex D without\nbeing instances of C. \n\nSome proposed cases of (i) require the laws of nature to be contingent.  Although\nthe laws of nature are widely held to be contingent, some philosophers hold that\nthe laws are necessary, on the basis of essentialist arguments that\nare much of a piece with Kripke's essentialist arguments, even if\nstrictly independent of them. The anti-descriptivist arguments regard\nthe observable properties of instances of a kind C as nomic\nconsequences of the essence of C. If the laws of nature are\nmetaphysically necessary then D will be a necessary property\nof instances of C also.  Thus, instances of (i) will not be\navailable. If the laws are necessary, then the melting point of gold\nwill be necessary just as the atomic number of gold is. However, not\nall observable properties are consequences of the laws alone. Some are\nconsequences of the laws plus contingent environmental factors.  Thus\nthe perceived colour of an object may change with environmental\ndifferences. Thus if looking yellow is a component\nof D, then a possible world in which gold does not look\nyellow (because of unusual atmospheric effects)—surely a genuine\npossibility—would be a counterinstance of type (i). On the other\nhand, it might be argued, that the proper component of D\nwould be being yellow, in which case we will have the makings\nof an epistemological argument against descriptivism (see below). \n\nOther cases of (i) might be thought to be generated, irrespective of\nthe necessity of the laws, by noting that a kind might be manifested\nin two or more superficially distinct species. Thus allotropes are\ndistinct types of a single chemical kind that may differ considerably\nin superficial properties (for example, graphite and diamond, both\ntypes of the element carbon). Similarly, a caterpillar and a butterfly\ncan be members of the same species. For known cases, D would\nhave to be disjunctive. While that may not itself be problematic, it\nraises the epistemic possibility that the same phenomenon may be\n(nomically and metaphysically) possible for many kinds that we think\nexist in only one form. \n\nCases of (ii) may be more readily available, since the necessity of\nlaws may rule out a particular kind having different possible sets of\nmanifest properties, but does not rule out two distinct possible kinds\nhaving the same manifest properties. Indeed, the case of jadeite and\nnephrite is often referred to as an example of the latter. Along the\nsame lines, we may imagine that something like fool's gold, iron\npyrites, is just like gold in observable properties, differing only in chemical\nconstitution. We may imagine that there were creatures to all\nappearances like cats, but which are internally robots; or just like\ntigers but had reptilian innards. These are all metaphysically\npossible, so the arguments go; hence, possession of the relevant\nproperties cannot suffice for membership of the corresponding\nkind. \n\nThe modal argument does not refute descriptivism applied to every\ndescription—after all, Kripke and Putnam do both think that the \ndescription “is constituted by H2O” holds \nnecessarily of anything that is water. Rather, the modal argument is \nintended to exclude as possible descriptions those that could be \nconstitutive of a sense or connotation that is grasped by any \ncompetent user of the term. Such a sense, if it exists, would \nemploy descriptions that refer to the observable features of the \nmembers of a kind, not those features uncovered by science. \n\nThe epistemological arguments against descriptivism have a similar\nstructure to the modal arguments. Consider again the proposition (K).\nSomeone who uses the term ‘C’ competently should be\nthereby able to come to know that (K) is true, in virtue of grasping\nthe meaning of ‘C’. Thus (K) should be a\npriori. So counterexamples to descriptivism would be cases (i)\nwhere although one knows that some thing is of the kind C one\ncannot thereby come to know that it possesses the property\ncomplex D, or (ii) where although one knows that some thing\npossesses the property complex D, one cannot thereby come to\nknow that it is of the kind C. \n\nTo generate epistemological type (i) cases, Kripke asks us to imagine\nthat gold might be blue but only appears yellow thanks to an optical\nillusion, or that tigers do not normally have four legs, but only\nappear that way, again thanks to an illusion. However, if the\ndescriptions associated with ‘gold’ were to include\n‘is yellow’ and the descriptions associated with\n‘tiger’ include ‘is four-legged’ then we would\nknow a priori that these possibilities do not obtain. But\nthat seems to be a mistake. Although we may reasonably be confident\nthat gold really is yellow and not blue, and not just appearing that\nway, this confidence is not a priori but is instead a\nconsequence of a posteriori experience of the conditions\nunder which we have observed samples of gold. It is a matter of\ndiscovery whether we are subject to this kind of illusion, or whether\nsomething that is in fact white or grey could be gold; for example it\nis only a posteriori that we know that gold does not have\nwhite and grey allotropes, as tin does. (What is called ‘white\ngold’ is in fact an alloy of gold; but given a description of\nits appearance, it is not a priori that it is not gold. This\nis a contrapositive version of an epistemological type (i) case.)\nLikewise, turning to epistemological type (ii) cases, if descriptivism\nwere correct, we could rule out a priori the possibility that\nsomething has all the superficial properties of gold, but is not\ngold. But again we do not have such a priori knowledge (again\nwe note that jadeite is superficially similar to nephrite but not the\nsame kind). \n\nPutnam's Division of Linguistic Labor may be thought of as furnishing\nan epistemological argument. Putnam's idea is that the referent of a\nterm used by some individual may be fixed not by their own knowledge\nor beliefs, but rather by the knowledge of certain experts to whom\nthat individual defers. Since aluminium and molybdenum are different\nkinds, then according to descriptivism there should be some a\npriori knowable features that will distinguish between them for\nanyone who is capable of using ‘aluminium’ to refer to the\none kind and ‘molybdenum’ to the other kind.  Likewise\nthere should be some mental difference between a speaker in the actual\nworld who uses ‘aluminium’ to refer to aluminium and a\nspeaker in another world, where the instances of aluminium and\nmolybdenum are swapped (pans and cans are made of molybdenum there),\nwho uses ‘aluminium’ to refer to molybdenum. But, says,\nPutnam, no such difference need exist: ordinary speakers have these\ndifferentiated referring capacities without any difference in\nknowledge of the referents. That is because those referential\ncapacities are parasitic on those of the experts who do have the\nrequired discriminating knowledge (Putnam, 1975b, 228). Their\nknowledge fixes the referents of their use of ‘aluminium’\nand ‘molybdenum’.  Our deference to them as those people\nwho could tell us which things are aluminium and which are molybdenum,\nmeans that our referents of ‘aluminium’ and\n‘molybdenum’ are the same as theirs. \n\nThe modal and epistemological arguments concern the modal and\nepistemic properties of propositions of the form of (K). If\ndescriptivism were correct then there should be for each\nkind, C, a proposition of that form employing a\nmanifest property complex D, such that the proposition \nis analytic and hence both necessary and a priori. \nThe modal and epistemological arguments deny this. \n\nNote that the modal and epistemological arguments are most naturally\npresented in the material mode, concerning the objects themselves and\ntheir relations. (K) is in the material mode and we ask about its\nmodal status, by talking about certain stuff and asking whether it is\nor would be gold if it had such-and-such properties, and so\nforth. Likewise, mutatis mutandis, for the epistemological\narguments.  The semantic arguments differ in that they are presented\nin the formal mode, concerning the linguistic expressions in\nquestion. This is because we are asking what a term's reference or\nextension would be in certain counterfactual circumstances. To use an\nexample concerning a proper (singular) name, we start by imagining\nthat it turns out that Johannes Kepler had not been the first to\npostulate the laws of planetary motion, whereas it was an unknown\nstudent of Kepler's who did this first. Many people have no beliefs\nabout Kepler other that that he was the first person to postulate\nthose laws. If our story were true, would the name\n‘Kepler’, as used by such people, refer to the student or\nto the teacher? Our intuition, so anti-descriptivists maintain, is\nthat the name would still refer to the teacher, the man we (falsely)\nbelieved to be responsible for the discovery of the laws of planetary\nmotion. Yet, if the descriptivist account were correct for proper\nnames, then with respect to the people under consideration, their use\nof ‘Kepler’ would either refer to the student, or would\nfail to refer at all. \n\nBoth Putnam and Kripke take arguments of this sort to generalize to\nnatural kind terms. The best known of the semantic arguments as\napplied to natural kind terms is Putnam's Twin Earth thought\nexperiment (see\n Section 1.3.1).\n Putnam asks us to imagine that elsewhere in the universe there is a\nplanet exactly like Earth in virtually all respects, which we may call\n‘Twin Earth’. However, where on Earth we find\nH2O, on Twin Earth we find XYZ, a substance with a\nfundamentally different chemical structure from H2O, but\nwhich shares all its manifest properties (boiling and freezing points,\ntaste, odour, ability to support life, being the predominant\nconstituent of precipitation, seas, lakes etc.)  with\nH2O. Every inhabitant of Earth has a twin equivalent on\nTwin Earth. Twin Earthlings (at least those in the parts bearing a\ngeographical similarity to Earth's United States, Australia,\nJamaica, Pitcairn etc.) speak a language rather like English and use\nthe term ‘water’ in circumstances precisely analogous to\nour uses of ‘water’ on Earth, e.g., they say that their\nlakes and reservoirs are full of ‘water’. \n\nThe semantic Twin Earth argument now proceeds by asking what the\nextension of ‘water’ is, as used by some Earthling, and\nlikewise what the extension of ‘water’ is, as used by some\nTwin Earthling. Putnam's appeal to our linguistic intuitions is\nsupposed to yield the verdict that the extension of the Earthling's\nuse of ‘water’ includes all and only H2O\nwhereas the Twin Earthling's use of ‘water’ includes all\nand only XYZ. In support of this we may consider that this is the\njudgment we must come to if we Earthlings are not to deny what Earth\nchemists tell us, viz. that water is H2O, nor,\nsymmetrically, deny the Twin Earth chemists assertion,\n‘water is XYZ’. Nor will it do to gainsay our\nchemists judgment that water is H2O, given the\nassumption of the existence of XYZ. For that is tantamount to the\nsuggestion that (actual) Berzelius (the discoverer of the correct\nchemical formula for water) was not entitled to assert that water is\nH2O until he had ruled out the possibility of some\nsubstance other than H2O sharing water's manifest\nqualities. \n\nThe thought experiment is now almost in a position to claim the\nforegoing as a counterexample to descriptivism, for XYZ will satisfy\nany set of manifest properties that could be constitutive of the\nmeaning of ‘water’ as used on Earth. Yet the extension of\nthat term excludes XYZ. However, the reference to chemists\nknowledge made above reminds us that there is a difference between not\nonly the physical constitution of Earth and Twin Earth, but also a\ndifference between the psychological states of their inhabitants. For\n(some of) those on Earth believe ‘water is H2O’\nwhereas their Twin Earth counterparts believe ‘water is\nXYZ’.  Perhaps, at least for those speakers, those beliefs are\nalso constitutive of the meanings of the two terms ‘water’\n(Earth) and ‘water’ (Twin Earth). In order to exclude this\nresponse, Putnam asks us to consider the same comparison made in 1750,\nbefore any beliefs of this form were held. We now assume that there\nhas been no major change in the (cross-temporal) extension of\n‘water’ (Earth) since 1750. (That is to say, when David\nHume asked for a glass of what he called ‘water’, he was\nrequesting the same stuff as we are when we make a request using the\nsame term.) Since, as argued above, the extensions of\n‘water’ (Earth) and ‘water’ (Twin Earth)\ndiffer today, their extensions differed in 1750. But in 1750 the\ndescriptions associated with the word ‘water’ cannot\ndiffer between Earth and Twin Earth. This is because the molecular\nstructure of water was unknown in 1750, prior to the chemical\nrevolution (when phlogiston theory was replaced by Lavoisier's new\noxygen theory). Given that the molecular structure was unknown even to\nthe experts, the descriptive resources available to Earthians and\ntheir Twin Earthian counterparts were identical. Nonetheless, their\nreferences using ‘water’ differed. Hence, descriptions do\nnot suffice to fix reference. \n\nThe conclusions of the arguments given above include not only the\nfalsity of descriptivism as a thesis about the reference of natural\nkind terms, but also the more general truth of semantic\nexternalism.  The Earthling in 1750 and their Twin Earth\ncounterpart are supposed to be intrinsic physical duplicates. (There\nis a problem in that one would expect the twin to have XYZ in its\nblood stream, etc., not H2O, so the two are not perfect\nduplicates; but we can take it that this physical difference should\nnot affect the argument.) Although they are duplicates, the terms they\nuse have different extensions; likewise their thoughts have different\ntruth conditions. Consequently, the reference, extension, and truth\nconditions of a person's utterances do not supervene on their physical\nstate. These things are fixed, at least in part, by external\nconsiderations. We might retain a conception of the psychological such\nthat the psychological still supervenes on the physical; but then one\nwould have to deny that ‘thinking about water’\ncharacterizes a psychological state. Or, we must deny that the\npsychological state of a subject supervenes upon the physical state of the subject. \n\nIf descriptions do not fix extensions, and some external factor fixes\nextensions, then by what process are extensions fixed? Kripke does not \nintend to propose a new theory of reference fixing, although the outlines of\nsuch a theory are fairly clearly implied by what he says. His principal aim \nis to make the case for the Millian denotation-without-connotation view of \nsingular proper names, and then extend this (contrary to Mill's own \nopinion) to certain general terms also, including natural kind terms. \n\nThe Millian view may be called direct reference (Kaplan\n1977), since the reference of singular proper name is not mediated by\na connotation/sense/intension. The semantic value of such a name just\nis the individual to which it refers. Such terms are thus\nrigid designators—they denote the same object with respect to all\npossible worlds (Kripke 1980, 48). How does this view extend to natural kind \nterms? The answer is that the view does not transfer if we take the analogue \nof the denotation of a singular term to be the extension of a kind term. This is\nbecause presumably the extension of a kind term differs from world to world, \nsince the individual members of a kind, such as individual tigers and lumps \nof gold, are generally contingent entities. \n\nThe obvious route to an analogy between kind terms and singular direct\nreference is to focus not on natural kind predicates but on singular\nnatural kind terms (cf. first paragraph of\n Section 3\n above). We should regard terms such as ‘water’, \n‘gold’, ‘Rattus rattus’, etc. \nas denoting abstract individuals and objects (or some other \nkinds of entity that may be the constant recipient of reference\nacross worlds). Thus the direct reference view applied to such\nterms says that the semantic value of those terms just is those\nabstract individuals, and the claim that the terms are rigid\ndesignators is the claim that they denote the same abstract\nindividual, the same natural kind, with respect to all possible\nworlds. Rigid designation is a consequence of direct reference (but\nnot vice versa). (See Martí 2003 for a discussion of the relationship\nbetween Millianism, direct reference, and rigid designation. See also\nSullivan 2005.) \n\nTreating kinds as abstract individuals permits an analogue for natural\nkind terms to the natural story concerning the reference of singular\nproper names that emerges from Kripke's discussion. In the simplest\ncase, an individual receives a name in a naming ceremony, and the use\nof that name is transferred from speaker to speaker, preserving its\nreference through each transfer. Thus the reference of a later use is\ndetermined by tracing back the route of transmission to the original\nnaming ceremony. In the natural kind case, which is rather more of an\nidealization than the case of a concrete particular, the original\nnaming ceremony picks out a natural kind via an ostension of one of\nits samples. This is the so-called ‘causal’ theory of\nreference.  Note that ‘causal’ refers to the causal\ntransmission of the use of the name. (Although an ostensive reference\nfixing will be causal, the link between the kind (or its sample) and\nthe first use of the kind term could be secured by a reference-fixing\ndescription.  In such as case the reference-fixing description does\nmerely that; it does not supply a meaning (sense or intension). \n\nThus far Kripke's account of the semantics of natural kind terms\ntreats them very much on a par with proper names, suggesting that\nkinds are much like abstract individuals, being potential recipients\nof singular reference—Millianism has been extended from proper\nnames of individuals to natural kind terms. (Mill's own view of\n‘general terms’ was not Millian in this sense, but closer\nto a Fregean view.) Putnam gives a more elaborate account of the\nreference of natural kind terms, which apparently does not depend on\ntreating kinds as abstract individuals. According to Putnam, the\nextension of a natural kind term is fixed by ostending or otherwise\nidentifying a sample of the kind and appealing, explicitly or\nimplicitly, to a ‘same kind relation’. Thus the extension\nof ‘water’ includes all and only those things that bears\nthe same kind relation to some sample, which may be specified loosely,\nfor instance as ‘the watery stuff around here’ (where\n‘watery’ is defined in terms of the manifest\ncharacteristics of water, not in terms of ‘water’). (Note\nthat Putnam says ‘same liquid relation’, but that would\nnot provide the extension of a natural kind term, since it would\nexclude the gaseous and solid phases of water.) Putnam (1975a) thereby\nextends the notion of rigid designation to general terms, since (a)\nthe same kind relation is a cross-world relation, and (b) it is\nanchored to a specific, actual world sample. Consequently all samples\nof water in all possible worlds will bear the same kind relation to\none another. That this excludes XYZ depends upon its being the case\nthat a sample that does not share the ‘important physical\nproperties’ of our sample cannot be of the same kind. \n\nThe view that natural kind terms are rigid designators has\nconsequences for identity statements involving natural kind terms\n(e.g., “brontosaurus is apatosaurus”). The reason is that\nany identity statement relating two rigid designators is necessarily\ntrue. Hence identity statements involving natural kind terms express\nnecessary truths, even if knowable only a posteriori. Kripke\nregards theoretical identities such as ‘water =\nH2O’, where one of the terms is a description, as\ninstances of such a posteriori necessary identities. Such a\nclaim requires an argument to show that ‘H2O’\nis a rigid designator, since it is not a directly referring\nexpression. We may take ‘H’ and ‘O’ to\ndesignate hydrogen and oxygen rigidly. However, if the formula\n‘H2O’ just means ‘hydrogen and oxygen\ncompounded in the ratio 2:1’ one might wonder whether, if the\nlaws of nature are contingent, there might be worlds where hydrogen\nand oxygen are compounded in that ratio in such a way that the\nresulting compound does not belong to the same kind as H2O,\nand is not water. If that is possible, then\n‘H2O’ is not a rigid designator, and\n‘water = H2O’ is not necessary.  (As noted\nabove, Putnam's Twin Earth thought experiment does not establish the\nidentity of water and H2O—all it establishes is that\nbeing constituted of H2O is a necessary condition of being\nwater. In which case it is consistent with some instances (actual and\npossible) of H2O not being water.) Most discussions accept\nthat to count H2O as a substance it must be compounded of\nhydrogen and oxygen in the way that they are actually compounded. The\nrigid designation of simple, directly referring names and kind terms\nis often explained in terms of their having an indexical character. In\nideal cases where the name is introduced via an ostension of its\nintended referent, the designation is literal. In other cases\nindexicality is less apparent, as we see in the case of\n‘water’ where there is something like an implicit\nostension of ‘watery stuff around here’ (though\n‘water’ could not mean ‘watery stuff around\nhere’, since then the referent of ‘water’ would then be\ndifferent in an XYZ environment).  A similar implicit indexicality is\nfound in the theoretical specification of kind terms, which explains\ntheir rigid character also. \n\nThe Millian view applied to simple natural kind terms faces \nvarious problems. One of these problems concerns empty terms. \n‘Phlogiston’, ‘caloric’, \n‘ether’, ‘humour’, are all\nnatural kind terms that fail to refer to anything. Millianism \nimplies that there is no semantic difference between these terms \nat all. Surely ‘phlogiston does not exist’ \nand ‘caloric does not exist’ mean different things; \nLavoisier asserted the first and denied the second with apparent \nconsistency. The most common response to this problem is a retreat \nfrom pure Millianism for such terms. Some descriptive element \nis included in their semantics. \n\nThis need not be a full retreat to a Fregean view for two reasons. The\ndescriptive element may not suffice to pick out the kind (in the\nnon-empty cases)—the implicit historical ostension of a sample\nmay be necessary to fix reference. And the description itself may have\nnon-Fregean features—it may have an indexical component, for\nexample, a reference to the actual world, that a Fregean would\ndeny. The retreat from pure Millianism (and a partial vindication of\nMill's own view of general terms, which Kripke\nrejected) need not undermine the claim that kind terms are\nrigid designators. Rigid designation does not require direct\nreference; complex theoretical expressions, such as\n‘H2O’, may, as we saw, also be rigid\ndesignators. \n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that rigid designation for kind and\nother general terms faces a serious objection: rigid designation for\nkind terms is trivial (Soames 2002; Schwartz 2002; Martí 2004). Rigid\ndesignation requires that the object designated by a rigid designator\nbe the same in all worlds. That requirement rules out the extension of\na kind term as its designation, since the same kind may have different\nextensions in different worlds. On the other hand, regarding the\nextension as an abstract individual also faces difficulties. One might\ntake ‘Mary's favourite colour’ to designate different\ncolours in different worlds, and thus understood it is not a rigid\ndesignator. But we could take ‘Mary's favourite colour’ to\ndesignate (rigidly) an unusual abstract\nindividual Mary's-favourite-colour, which has violet things\nas its extension in the actual world, but turquoise things in another\npossible world and so on. This thought experiment suggests that it is\nalways possible to regard a general term as a rigid designator. One\noption for resisting this move is to deny that in every case there is\nsome entity for the term to refer to. There is no thing abstract or\nconcrete that is\nMary's-favourite-colour. Property terms may denote a natural\nproperty, in Lewis's (1986) terms a\nsparse property or they do not denote at all. Similarly, \nnatural kind terms denote genuinely natural entities that are likewise\n sparse or they fail to denote. \n\nAbove we saw that an identity statement conjoining two rigid\ndesignators expresses a necessary truth, one that may be knowable\nonly a posteriori. That follows simply from the definition of\n‘rigid designator’. We have also seen that natural kind\nterms are rigid designators. That seems simply to be a fact about the\nsemantics of natural kind terms. Consequently it looks as if a\nnon-trivial metaphysical fact—that there are necessary truths\nknowable only a posteriori—is a consequence of Kripke's\nsemantics for natural kind terms. Furthermore, when we consider\ntheoretical identities, such as ‘water is H2O’\nand ‘gold is the element with atomic number 79’ etc., it\nappears that we are being given a special kind of necessary truth, a\ntruth that it necessary because it specifies the essence of a\nkind. \n\nThe conclusion that we can derive metaphysical facts from semantic\nones has been regarded as highly questionable by many commentators.\nHow could facts about our use of terms lead to\nconclusions about the essences of things and kinds?\nFurthermore, the anti-descriptivist semantics involved is closely related \nto semantic externalism, but the latter need not imply essentialism, as Tyler\nBurge's social externalism shows (Burge 1979, 1986). Nathan Salmon\n(1982) argues that no non-trivial essentialist consequences can be\ninferred from a theory of reference. \n\nOne might take the view that the apparent derivation of a metaphysical\nconclusion from semantic premises is a sleight of hand, with hidden\nessentialist premises being smuggled into the argument. If one were to\nassume that ‘H2O’ is a rigid designator, one\nmight be accused of tacitly assuming metaphysical\nessentialism. However, one might alternatively take the view that\nsemantics and metaphysics are more intimately related. For\nexample, one might hold that the semantics itself makes certain\nmetaphysical assumptions, in which case the metaphysics would follow\nfrom the semantics, but innocently and for fairly trivial reasons. Note that a\nthoroughgoing Fregean descriptivism also has metaphysical\nconsequences, since it rules out essentialism. According to the view\nthat the correct semantics implies an essentialist metaphysics, the\nsemantic claim that ‘water’ is a rigid designator is\nitself metaphysically loaded. But this is not to say that Putnam,\nKripke, and other philosophers are smuggling in metaphysical\nassumptions. Rather, it is to say that competent users of the term\ntacitly make those assumptions. Putnam's Twin Earth thought\nexperiments make those assumptions explicit. Note that, as the above\ndiscussion has shown, while the thought experiments are normally\nexpressed in the formal mode—we ask whether XYZ would fall within \nthe extension of the term ‘water’ (Earth)—the essentialist \nconclusion can be reached directly by phrasing the same question in the \nmaterial mode: we ask whether XYZ would be water.","contact.mail":"e.tobin@ucl.ac.uk","contact.domain":"ucl.ac.uk"}]
