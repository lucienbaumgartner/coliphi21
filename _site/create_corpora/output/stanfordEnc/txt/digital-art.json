These claims suggest that\nthe “digital condition” (Kittler 1999) induces a loss of trust in the\nimage, a new way of experiencing the world as indeterminate and\nfragmentary, and a breakdown of traditional boundaries between artist\nand audience, artwork and artistic process. Testing these claims\nrequires a formal understanding of the distinction between analog and\ndigital systems and the implications of that distinction for aesthetic\nappreciation. The philosophy of digital art proceeds from a carefully\narticulated general account of digital representation to an\ninvestigation of the precise ways in which different kinds of digital\nart are digital. This leads to further investigation into the ways\nan artwork’s digital status bears on its appropriate\nappreciation.  By conducting a systematic analysis of the digital as\nan artistically significant category, the philosophy of digital art\nseeks to ground burgeoning interdisciplinary and popular interest in\nthe so-called “digital revolution”.\n\n\nAlthough technology-based art is viewed as being part of the\n“the final avant-garde of the twentieth-century” (Rush\n2005), and digital art has been part of the mainstream art world since\nthe late 1900s (Paul 2008), the philosophy of digital art is still an\nemerging subfield. Three seminal monographs, one on videogames\n(Tavinor 2009), one on digital cinema (Gaut 2010), and one on computer\nart (Lopes 2010), have been invaluable in laying the groundwork\nconcerning philosophical questions about art and computer\ntechnology. Since these publications, further philosophical attention\nhas been given to the digital arts, including the first published\nvolume to focus on the aesthetics of videogames (see Robson &\nTavinor, eds., 2018). However, there is still a great deal of\nphilosophical work to be done. In particular, work is needed to provide a general conceptual\nframework for an interdisciplinary discussion of the true extent to\nwhich the digital has revolutionized art and media.\n\nIn its broadest extant sense, “digital art” refers to\nart that relies on computer-based digital encoding, or on the\nelectronic storage and processing of information in different\nformats—text, numbers, images, sounds—in a common binary\ncode. The ways in which art-making can incorporate computer-based\ndigital encoding are extremely diverse. A digital photograph may be\nthe product of a manipulated sample of visual information captured\nwith a digital camera from a “live” scene or captured with\na scanner from a traditional celluloid photograph. Music can be\nrecorded and then manipulated digitally or created digitally with\nspecialized computer software. And a movie is now the product of an\nextremely complex sequence of choices between analog and digital\nprocesses at the stages of image and sound capture or composition,\nimage and sound editing, color correction or sound mastering, special\neffects production, and display or projection.  The complexity of the digital cinema workflow draws attention to a\nfurther difference concerning whether reliance on the digital is\nrestricted to the way an artwork is made or extends to the display of\nthe work. A work may be made on a computer—say, a musical work\ncomposed with Sibelius or a play written in Microsoft Word—and yet meant\nfor apprehension in a non-digital format—say, performance on\ntraditional musical instruments or enactment on stage. Similarly, a\nmovie could be captured and edited digitally before being printed on\ntraditional 35mm photochemical film for projection in theaters. By\ncontrast, works which are purely digital include a film made and\nprojected digitally—for example, Avatar (2009), a\npiece of music composed and played back electronically—for\nexample, the electroacoustic works of Gottfried Michael Koenig\n(see Other Internet Resources), and a work of\nASCII art—an image made up from the 95 printable characters\ndefined by the ASCII standard of 1963 and displayed on a computer\nmonitor. An example of ASCII art is: \nPurely digital works include interactive works such as videogames and\ndigital installations. Videogames are arguably the newest digital\nworks to be recognized as a potential art form, although Brock Rough\n(2018) claims that under certain circumstances, videogames and art are\nincompatible. Additionally, many interactive digital installations in\nthe museum borrow videogame mechanics, which factor as prominent\nfeatures to appreciate (Paul 2008). \nEach of the examples above incorporates a computational process, to\nsome degree, in the presentation of the work. In many ways, works\ncomprised of digital media stand in stark contrast to those made by\ncompletely analog means. The classical account of the analog-digital distinction is found in\nNelson Goodman’s Languages of Art (1976). In fact\nGoodman’s account remains practically the only general\naccount of the distinction. While David Lewis (1971) raises a series\nof objections to Goodman’s account, Lewis’ alternative\naccount applies only to the representation of numbers. And while John\nHaugeland (1981) returns to the general distinction, he effectively\nqualifies and re-frames Goodman’s account in order to overcome\nLewis’s and other potential objections. A few philosophers\ninterested in clarifying the concepts employed by cognitive scientists\nhave recognized the need for a general account of the analog-digital\ndistinction (e.g., Dretske 1981; Blachowicz 1997; Katz 2008; Maley\n2011). But in this context, as well, Goodman’s account is the\nessential point of reference. In some ways, this is surprising or at\nleast striking: As Haugeland points out, the digital is a\n“mundane engineering notion” (1981: 217). Yet the\nphilosophical context in which the notion receives its fullest\nanalysis is that of aesthetics. As is well-known, Goodman’s\ninterests in this context center on the role of musical notation in\nfixing the identity of musical works. But a musical notation is also a\nstandard example of a digital system.  On Goodman’s broad, structuralist way of thinking,\nrepresentational systems in general consist of sets of possible\nphysical objects that count as token representations. Objects are\ngrouped under syntactic and semantic types, and interesting\ndifferences between kinds of representational system track differences\nin the way syntactic and semantic types relate to one another. Digital\nsystems are distinguished by being differentiated as opposed\nto dense. The condition of syntactic differentiation\nis met when the differences between classes of token representations\nare limited such that it is possible for users of the system always to\ntell that a token belongs to at most one class. The condition\nof semantic differentiation is met when the extension of each\ntype, or the class of referents corresponding to a class of token\nrepresentations, differs in limited ways from the extension of any\nother type; so that users of the system can always tell that a\nreferent belongs to at most one extension.  Goodman provides the\nfollowing example of a simple digital computer, a system that meets\nthe conditions of both syntactic and semantic differentiation: Say we\nhave an instrument reporting on the number of dimes dropped into a toy\nbank with a capacity for holding 50 dimes, where the count is reported\nby an Arabic numeral on a small display (Goodman 1976: 159). In this\nsystem, the syntactic types are just the numbers 0–50, which\nhave as their instances the discrete displays, at different times, of\nthe corresponding Arabic numerals. Both conditions of syntactic and\nsemantic differentiation are met because the relevant differences\nbetween instances of different numbers are both highly circumscribed\nand conspicuous. This means that users of the system can be expected\nto be able to read the display, or determine which number is\ninstantiated on the display (syntactic differentiation) and which\nnumerical value, or how many coins, is thereby being indicated\n(semantic differentiation).  Analog representation fails to be differentiated because it is\ndense. With an ordering of types such that between any two types,\nthere is a third, it is impossible to determine instantiation of at\nmost one type. Not every case involving a failure of finite\ndifferentiation is a case of density. However, a traditional\nthermometer is such that heights of mercury that differ to any degree\ncount as distinct syntactic types, the kinds of things that can differ\nsemantically. Similarly, for pictures distinguished according to\nregions of color, for any two pictures, no matter how closely similar,\none can always find a third more similar to each of them than they are\nto each other. Density is a feature of any system that measures\ncontinuously varying values. That is, as long as the system in\nquestion is designed so that any difference in magnitude indicates a\ndifference in type.  Returning to the digital, some commentators have questioned\nwhether Goodman’s condition of (syntactic and semantic) finite\ndifferentiation is sufficient to distinguish the kind of\nrepresentation in question (Haugeland 1981; Lewis 1971). John\nHaugeland, for example, argues that there can be differentiated\nschemes without the “copyability” feature that defines the\npractical significance of digital systems. Haugeland’s solution\nis to require the practical and not just the theoretical possibility\nof a system’s users determining type membership. In fact,\nhowever, Goodman himself would likely accept this modification. In a\nlater work, Goodman explicitly states that finite differentiation must\nmake it possible to determine type membership “by means\navailable and appropriate to the given user of the given scheme”\n(Goodman and Elgin 1988: 125).  Whether or not a work of digital art is a work of representational\nart, and even with the most abstract works of digital art, there are\nlayers of representation involved in the complex processes of their\nproduction and presentation. Most of these layers, and arguably the\nmost important ones, are digital. Where there are analog systems\ninvolved, digital translation makes possible the realization of the\nvalues of the final work. This is perhaps best seen with paradigmatic\ncases of digital art. Consider the following two early works: The first of these works involves digital moving imagery that is\nentirely generated by a computer program. At the same time, the video\nlooks like it was or could have been recorded in an actual office\nsetting. The particular significance of the work depends on the viewer\nbeing aware of its digital composition while at the same time being\nstruck by its photorealistic familiarity. According to the San Francisco\nMuseum of Modern Art (SF MoMA),  Kalpakjian thus reveals the complete artificiality\nof the built environments we inhabit, and their aesthetic distance\nfrom more humanistic forms.  (SF MoMA n.d.)  The second work involves imagery that was initially captured\ndigitally. Arcangel began by taking 360-degree photographs of his\nhometown of Buffalo, New York.  He scanned and modified the\nphotographs on his computer so that they could be coded according to\nthe graphics capabilities of the Nintendo gaming system, and in order\nto give the images the distinctive look and feel of the Mario Bros\ngame. Arcangel then programmed the landscape imagery to scroll\ncontinuously across a TV screen, as in the Mario Bros game. Finally,\nArcangel melted the chips in a Super Mario cartridge, replacing them\nwith his self-manufactured chips so that his landscape\n“game” could be run on any Nintendo system. As well as all\nthe ways in which Arcangel’s work relies on both the technology\nand aesthetics of videogames, there are clearly ways in which it\ndeliberately removes or blocks certain key features or capacities of\nvideogames, perhaps most notably their robust interactivity. Playing a\nvideogame essentially involves the prescribed creation of new display\ninstances of a work. But we do not “play” Landscape\nStudy #4, and its imagery is fixed by the artist. The kind of\ninteractivity typical of videogames can also be found in artworks made\nwithout computers (see Lopes 2010: 49). But this type of interactivity\nis most closely associated with digital art because it is so much\neasier to achieve with the use of computers. This suggests a high\ndegree of self-consciousness in Arcangel’s decision to block the\ninteractivity of his reverse-engineered videogame. From the\nperspective of the philosophy of digital art, such a decision\nhighlights the need for further discussion of the link between the\nnature of the digital and the nature of interactivity.  What is it about the ways in which the works by Arcangel and\nKalpakjian are made that makes them digital in an appreciatively\nrelevant sense? Computer imaging depends on the inherent\nprogrammability and automation of digital computers. Digital image\ncapture depends on sampling and subsequently on the near-instantaneous\nprocesses of discrete coding.  None of this would be possible without\na series of linked systems each with finitely differentiated\nsettings. \nAt the most basic level, the myriad transistors in a computer are\nessentially tiny digital schemes, each with two types: the\n“on” and “off” settings of the\ntransistor-capacitor switch. The settings are discrete and\ndistinguishable, as are their compliance classes, of 1s and 0s. The\nubiquity of binary code in computer processing is a consequence of the\nfact that a digital computer is essentially a vast collection of\non-off switches. A particular sequence of 1s and 0s realized at a\nparticular time in virtue of the requisite arrangement of transistors\nis a binary instance of a particular number, interchangeable with all\nother instances of the same number and with no instances of different\nnumbers. The difference between instances of one number and instances\nof other numbers is strictly limited to the difference in the ordering\nof 1s and 0s. In other words, Goodman’s condition of finite\ndifferentiation is clearly met. In turn, the numbers can refer to\nother values, including the light-intensity values of an image. A\ncomputation simply involves the generation of output strings of binary\ndigits from input strings in accordance with a general rule that\ndepends on the properties of the strings (Piccinini 2008). The modern\n(digital) computer encodes both data and instructions of human\nreadable code and assembly languages as sequences of binary digits, or\nbits, and allows for the internal storage of instructions. This makes\nthe computer essentially programmable in the sense that it can be\nmodified to compute new functions simply by being fed an appropriate\narrangement of bits.  A program is a list of instructions, and instructions are strings\nof digits. The modern digital computer has components that serve to\ncopy and store programs inside the machine, and to supply instructions\nto the computer’s processing units for implementation in the\nappropriate order. The outputs of a system can be dependent on\nspecific inputs often in tandem with the conditional if-then\nstatements. This is what is involved in a computer executing\nconditional branching instructions such that it can monitor and\nrespond to its own intermediate computational states and even modify\ninstructions based on its own processes. Such modifications are\ndictated by an algorithm—the program’s set of rules and\noperations. It is the digital computer’s capacity for branching,\ndue to its digital programmability, that allows for the kinds of\nhigher-level automation involved in the use of imaging applications\nand sequential image-generation. Our artists, Kalpakjian and Arcangel,\ndo not have to enter the strings of digits for every basic operation\nof the computer that underlies the complex operations involved in\ndescribing and manipulating images (among other features). If they did\nhave to do this, they would never finish making their\nartworks. Rather, artists can rely on open-source code, libraries, or\ncommercial software that automatically and instantaneously supplies the\nlines of code required for the execution of their decisions.  The imaging software with which Kalpakjian works allows him to\ngenerate architectural interiors in rich detail. Arcangel does not\nrequire as much from his imaging software given that he is\nmanipulating previously captured and scanned images. The process of\nscanning the photographs, just like the process involved in digital\nphotography, involves sampling and quantization of a visual source;\nassigning an integer, from a finite range, to the average\nlight-intensity measured across each small area of source-space\ncorresponding to a cell in a grid. This process involves averaging and\nrounding up values, and it involves measurement, or sampling, of light\nintensities at (spatially and temporally) discrete intervals. Some,\nindeed many, of the differences in light intensity across the source\nimage or scene (and at different times, in the case of moving imagery)\nare thereby dropped by the process of digital image-capture. Among\nsome media theorists, this fact has led to deep suspicion of the\ndigitally recorded image, prompting the feeling that the digital image\nis always a poor substitute for the analog. Current digital\ntechnologies for image-capture and display have such high rates of\nsampling frequency and resolution that the values dropped in\nquantization are well below the threshold of human perception. At the\nsame time, Arcangel’s Landscape Study #4  reminds us\nthat digital artists may choose to exploit visible pixellation for\nparticular artistic ends.  A digitally recorded image need not appear any less richly\ndetailed or varied in color than an analog image. All the same, in the\nterms of D. N.  Rodowick, whereas the analog photograph is an\n“isomorphic transcription” of its subject, a digital\nphotograph is a “data-output”, with a\nsymbolically-mediated link to its subject (Rodowick 2007:\n117–8). This ontological divide—described by William\nJ. Mitchell as a “sudden and decisive rupture” in the\nhistory of photography (1994: 59), is then assumed to have aesthetic\nimplications: Rodowick insists that the “discontinuities”\nin digital information “produce perceptual or aesthetic\neffects”. Despite this insistence, however, Rodowick goes on to\nacknowledge that, with enough resolution, “a digital photograph\ncan simulate the look of a continuously produced analogical\nimage”. This concession would seem to work against any attempt\nto identify the aesthetic effects of pixellation, even if “the\npixel grid remains in the logical structure of the image”\n(Rodowick 2007: 119). But if we are to interpret Rodowick charitably,\nhe could be implying that ontology at least partly determines\nappropriate appreciation; even if a digital photograph can look just\nlike an analog photograph, its (known) digital status affects which of\nits perceptible features are aesthetically relevant and how we\nappropriately engage with them. The media theorists’ worry about the impoverished digital\nimage primarily refers to the production of digital images\nwith its reliance on sampling and quantization. But there are also\nanalogous worries one could have about the\ndigital presentation of images, worries about deep structural\nchanges to analog images once they are displayed digitally—for\nexample, on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen or when projected\ndigitally on a flat surface. Of course one could simply be interested\nin investigating these structural changes without being particularly\nworried about them.  This shall be our approach.  The traditional method of film reel projection has been a\nremarkably stable and entrenched technology, remaining largely\nunchanged for over a century.  But digital projection is on the rise,\nparticularly in conjunction with the networked distribution of\nmovies. And although movie audiences may not be able to see the\ndifference on screen between analog and digital projection, their\nexpectations are changing—for example, about what can go wrong\nin the presentation of a movie. A deeper assumption that has not\nchanged, one that is almost universal among film scholars, is that\ncinema fundamentally depends on an illusion. Cinema is the art of\nmoving images and thus its very existence depends on our being tricked\ninto seeing a rapid succession of static images as a persistent moving\nimage. In the philosophy of film, there is a small debate about the\nstatus of cinematic motion—whether it really is an illusion as\nis commonly assumed. An analysis of digital projection technology\nreveals new complexities in this debate but ultimately provides\nadditional reasons to stick with the popular illusionist view.  Traditional and digital projection methods could not appear more\ndifferent: the former involves running a flexible film strip through a\nmechanical projector; the latter involves a complex array of\nmicromirrors on semiconductor chips, which, in combination with a\nprism and a lamp, generate projectable images from binary\ncode. Nevertheless, both are methods for generating the impression of\na continuously illuminated, persistent moving image from a sequence of\nstatic images. Compared with traditional projection, however, digital\nprojection includes an extra step, whereby the images in the static\nsequence are generated from flashes of light. In order to generate\neach image in the digital projector, a light beam from a high-powered\nlamp is separated by a prism into its color components of red, blue,\nand green. Each color beam then hits a different Digital Micromirror\nDevice (DMD), which is a semiconductor chip covered with more than a\nmillion tiny, hinged mirrors. Based on the information encoded in the\nvideo signal, the DMDs selectively turn over some of the tiny mirrors\nto reflect the colored lights. Most of the tiny mirrors are flipped\nthousands of times a second in order to create the gradations of light\nand dark making up a monochromatic, pixellated image—a mirror\nthat is flipped on a greater proportion of the time will reflect more\nlight and so will form a brighter pixel than a mirror that is not\nflipped on for so long. Each DMD reflects a monochromatic image back\nto the prism, which then recombines the colors to form the projected,\nfull-color image. This image—if it were held for long enough on\nthe screen—would be perceived as static. In order then to\nproduce the impression of motion in the projected, full-color image,\nthe underlying memory array of the DMDs has to update rapidly so that\nall the micromirrors are released simultaneously and allowed to move\ninto a new “address state”, providing new patterns of\nlight modulation for successive, slightly different images.  The two-stage process of digital projection, whereby each image in\na static sequence is generated by flashing light and the impression of\na moving image is then generated by the rapid execution of the\nsequence, draws attention to the metaphysical complexity of the\nquestion of how movies move. In particular, one is unlikely to\ndetermine the status of the impression of motion that makes possible\nthe art of cinema unless one can determine the status of the imagery\nthat is seen to move. Given that motion involves an object occupying\ncontiguous spatial locations in successive moments of time, a moving\nobject must be re-identifiable over time. A moving image in a film,\narising as it does out of the rapid display of a succession of still\nimages, is not obviously a persistent object that can be seen to\nmove. Then again, perhaps it is enough that ordinary viewers identify\nan image—say of a moving train— as the same image, for the\nmoving image to persist (Currie 1996).  Alternatively, the moving\nimage could be thought to persist as a second-order physical entity\nconstituted by a sequence of flashing light (Ponech 2006).  The second proposal immediately runs into trouble with digital\nprojection. If the traditionally projected moving image exists as a\nseries of flashes of light, in digital projection, other\n“intermediate” objects must be granted existence—for\nexample, the stable point of light consisting of the rate of flashes,\nand gaps between them, of a single micromirror on the DMD. At the same\ntime, the moving image itself must be stripped of its existence since\nit does not consist of flashes of light. This is due to the fact that,\nin digital projection, there are no gaps between frames and so no\nunderlying, imperceptible alternation of light and dark. This leaves\nthe realist in the awkward position of claiming that the moving image\ngoes in and out of existence with the switch between analog and\ndigital projection technologies.  The first proposal, on which cinematic motion is a secondary\nquality, threatens to destroy the distinction between the apparent and\nthe illusory. It suggests a way of reinterpreting any case of\nperceptual illusion as a case involving the ascription of secondary\nqualities. That is, unless it can be shown that there are independent\nmeans of checking that we are mistaken about genuine illusions. But\neven if this can be shown, a problem remains: While there may not be\nan independent check for the motion in an image, there is likewise no\nindependent check for a genuine illusion of color. Given the contrived\nconditions of movie viewing, there is more reason to think of\ncinematic motion as akin to an illusory, than to a genuine, experience\nof color. With the introduction of digital projection, the conditions\nare arguably even more contrived. For it is not just movement in the\nimage but the image itself that is constituted by rapid flashes of\nlight. And the technology involved is far less accessible than that of\na traditional mechanical projector in the sense that one cannot, just\nby looking at the projection device, see (roughly) how it works. In\nthis way, an analysis of digital movie projection serves to reinforce\nthe traditional assumption that cinema is an art of illusion. In\naddition, however, the analysis suggests that the illusion at the\nheart of cinema is particularly impenetrable—akin to an illusion\nof color, and thus an illusion of a mere appearance that cannot be\nchecked (Thomson-Jones 2013). With digital movie projection, we begin to see the importance of\nunderstanding the technology of display for understanding the nature\nof digital art. Another way we see its importance is in relation to\nimages displayed on LCD screens. According to Goodman, images are\nessentially analog. Nevertheless, there seems to be a way for\nengineers to circumvent the essential analogicity of pictorial schemes\nby using digital technologies for encoded subphenomenal\ndiscrimination. Arguably, finite differentiation can be imposed on the\nscheme of all possible images displayed on high-resolution LCD\nscreens.  As we shall see, this has far-reaching implications for the\nways in which we think about and properly appreciate image-based\nart.  Both in his earlier and in his later work in aesthetics, Goodman\ncommits to “a special relation” between the analog and the\npictorial, one that is seen when we compare “the presystematic\nnotions of description and picture in a given culture”. Given\ntwo schemes, S and S′, where S\nconsists of all descriptions or predicates in a language such as\nEnglish, and S′ consists of all pictures, if we were\ntold only of the structures of S and S′, we\ncould distinguish the pictorial scheme by its being analog (Goodman\nand Elgin 1988: 130). The special relation remains, Goodman claims,\ndespite the possibility of a digital sub-scheme made up of black and\nwhite grid patterns all of which happen to be pictures. In such a\nscheme, the differences between patterned types that matter for the\nscheme’s being digital do not include all of the differences\nthat matter for distinguishing pictorial types. Pictures are\ndistinguished by color, shape, and size, which vary continuously; any\nvariation in color, shape, or size potentially results in a different\npicture. When we impose limits on the differences that matter for\ndistinguishing one grid pattern in the scheme from another, we are not\ninterpreting the grid patterns as pictures; if we were to do so, we\nwould have to treat them as members of a syntactically dense, an\nanalog, scheme.  Goodman’s insight about grid patterns and pictures suggests\nan immediate difficulty for explaining the digital status of images\ndisplayed on LCD screens: Clearly it will not be sufficient to point\nout that such images are pixellated, and therefore made up of small\nidentical building blocks that impose a lower limit on the differences\nbetween display-instances. Remember that pictures are defined by\ncolor, shape, and size, which vary continuously. This means that even\nif the physical pixels of an LCD screen are such that there are gaps\nbetween the possible shapes, sizes, and colors that the screen can\ninstantiate, and there are a finite number of shapes, sizes, and\ncolors that the screen can instantiate, there is still going to be\nvagueness at the limits of types. Any means of discretely carving up\nthe property spaces of color, shape, and size has to involve grouping\ninto types what are in fact (subphenomenally) distinct shapes, sizes,\nand colors, some of which may differ less from adjacent properties\ngrouped into other types. This makes it impossible always to determine\nunique class membership; hence, finite differentiation is not\nachieved.  Pixellation alone, no matter the resolution, cannot account for\nimages displayed on LCD screens belonging to a digital scheme; digital\nimages qua images thus remain stubbornly analog. But perhaps\nGoodman’s condition of finite differentiation can still be met\nwith a closer analysis of digital image technology. Current\ntechnologies for sampling and instantiating light intensities group\nobjective colors well below the level of phenomenal\ndiscrimination. For example, in the standard “Truecolor”\nsystem, a display pixel has three 8-bit subpixels, each of which emits\na different visible wavelength with an intensity from a range of 256\nvalues, yielding over 16 million objective colors. Such a large number\nof available colors gives the impression of a color continuum when, in\nfact, digital sampling technology has been used to carve up the\nobjective color space into a disjoint series of wavelength\nintensities. On the one hand, from the fact that display pixels can be\nlit at intensities between and indiscriminable from adjacent\ndiscriminable intensities, it seems to follow finite differentiation is\ndefeated. On the other hand, precisely because digital technology\ninvolves microtechnology and metrology for subphenomenal\ndiscrimination between colors, the light intensity groupings that are\nexpressed numerically as red-blue-green triplets in a system like\nTruecolor can be narrower than the objective color types that\ncontribute to the resultant image scheme. The key is keeping the\nvariations in the essentially analog properties of color, shape, and\nsize small enough so that they cannot accumulate to the point of\nmaking a difference to image perception (Zeimbekis 2012). The types in\nthe scheme of digital images are technologically segmented, transitive\ngroupings of the same color-, shape-, and size-experiences.  The\ncarving out of a transitive sub-set of magnitudes has to occur\nrelative to the needs of the users of the system. In the case of\ndigital color, the types are classes of light intensities\nsufficient to cause the same color experience for normal\nhuman perceivers. The replicability of digital images is made possible\nby the gap between the discriminatory limits of the human visual\nsystem and the discriminatory limits of digital sampling\ntechnology.  Digital images can be replicated insofar as they are digital and\nthus finitely differentiated. They are finitely differentiated because\nthey rely on subphenomenal sampling and display technology. In\npractical terms, replication depends on the use of binary code, even\nthough this is not in fact what makes images qua images\ndigital. Of course binary code representations are themselves part of\na digital scheme. But the role of binary code in image-instantiation\nis just one of consistent preservation; preservation for long enough\nto permit reproduction. Despite the inherent replicability of digital\nimages, it does not appear to follow automatically that artworks\ninvolving these images are multiples.   The SF MoMA is in possession of the original of Kalpakjian’s\nwork, Corridor; they control access to the video imagery. At\npresent, the work is not available to be viewed: it cannot be viewed\non-line as part of a digital archive or collection, nor is it\ncurrently on view in the physical space of the museum. The image\nsequence comprising the work could be multiply instantiated and widely\ndistributed, but in fact it is not. Similarly with Arcangel’s\nwork, Landscape Study #4: described as an installation, it is\nto be exhibited in a physical gallery alongside an arrangement of\nprinted stills, with a television connected to a Nintendo\nEntertainment System. Again, the image sequence displayed on the\ntelevision could be multiply instantiated and widely distributed, but\nit is not. Clips and copies of the landscape imagery are available\non-line, but these are not taken to instantiate parts of the work\nitself. By contrast, works of net art are instantiated whenever they\nare accessed by someone on-line.  There are many kinds of net art, including various forms of\nexperimental on-line literature, conceptual browser art, and works\ndrawing on software and computer gaming conventions. Extensive on-line\ncollections of visual and audiovisual net art are rigorously curated\nand at the same time immediately accessible to ordinary Internet\nusers. The contrast is striking, between the conventions of access and\npresentation, for works of net art and for works like those by\nKalpakjian and Arcangel. Perhaps a digital artwork comprising multiply\ninstantiable images need not itself be multiply instantiable. At this\npoint, in considering the factors determining the status of a digital\nvisual artwork, the philosophy of digital art joins an ongoing debate\nabout the ontology of art.  On the question of whether artworks are all the same kind of thing\nor many different kinds of things, ontological pluralism is often\ntaken to be implied by the primary role of the artist in\n“sanctioning” features of his or her work (Irvin 2005,\n2008; Thomasson 2010). A sanction can consist simply in a\nself-professed artist painting a canvas, say, and handing it over to a\ngallery with a title attached. The artist has sanctioned those\nfeatures of the work that make it a traditional painting. But what was\nonce largely implicit is now often explicit: many contemporary works\nof art are defined by a set of instructions for their presentation\n(e.g., aspect ratio, resolution). We can find similar examples of\nnon-digital works that are defined by a set of instructions such as\nFelix Gonzalez-Torres’ Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.) (1991),\nwhich is given to a gallery to display by way of nothing other than a\nset of instructions for constructing and maintaining a pile of\ncandies. Whether non-digital or digital, the instructions determine\nwhat is part of the work and what is not, and whether the work is\nsingular or multiply instantiable. As a result, the instructions guide\nappropriate interpretation of the work. On this view, ontology\nprecedes interpretation: we cannot properly and fully appreciate a\nwork, for the work that it is, without a prior determination of what\nit comprises.  This is a matter of contention, however. On another way\nof thinking, artworks just are objects of interpretation, and there is\nno artwork prior to interpretation whose boundaries can be identified\nbefore we begin interpretation (Davies 2004).  The issue of the relation between ontology and interpretation is a\ncomplex and difficult one, but progress likely can be made on the\nissue through an examination of digital art practices. This is\nparticularly in light of the high degree of self-consciousness with\nwhich many digital artists and digital art curators specify the\nfeatures of digital art works. It is common practice, for example,\nwhen archiving net art, to have artists fill out a questionnaire in\norder to specify which features of a work are crucial for its\npreservation—whether features of appearance, timing and motion,\ninteractivity potentials and methods, linking to other sites, or\nhardware and software. When a work of net art is individuated by its\nimagery, the artist has chosen to make the inherent replicability of\ndigital imagery part of his or her work. That this is a choice is\nsuggested by the existence of singular works of digital visual art,\nlike the examples discussed above. If indeed the works by Kalpakjian\nand Arcangel can function allographically—and certainly, this\nquestion requires further investigation (see D’Cruz and Magnus\n2014)—this would support a primary role for the artist’s\npresentation instructions in fixing, not just the art form\n(installation, movie, conceptual work, etc.) but the basic structure\nof the work: for example, whether the work is singular and thus\nidentical with a certain kind of physical display or multiple with no\noriginal display. Where interactive digital works are concerned,\nindividuation is determined by the algorithm. An algorithmic account\nof interactive digital art suggests that, although the code is\nimportant for adequate instantiation of the work, it is the algorithm\nthat specifies the crucial features of the work (Lopes 2010; Tavinor\n2011; Moser 2018). Since the code is, ontologically speaking, less\nrelevant than the algorithm, this account also makes allowances for\nthe variability that may be found in the code when an instance of a\nprogram is run on different kinds of devices.  Reflection on the kinds and significance of choices available to an\nartist contributes to a full appreciation of his or her work. For any\nartwork, appreciation begins with recognition of its status as\na work, the product of artistic activity of some kind, and\nthus something to be appreciated as the achievement of an artist or\ngroup of artists. Most commonly, this achievement is understood in\nterms of the aesthetically significant effects achieved by an artist\nwith certain kinds of tools and materials and in light of certain\nappreciative conventions. In other words, the achievement is always\nrelative to an artistic medium. Returning to the case of an artist\nchoosing what to do about the inherent replicability of digital\nimagery, another way of thinking about this choice is in terms of the\nartist recognizing the limits and capacities of her chosen\nmedium. Images conveyed digitally are always replicable and so when an\nartist aims to convey artistic content through digital imagery, she\neither has to accept the inevitable multiplicity of her images or\nresist the tendency of the medium and somehow specify the work’s\nsingularity in presentation. At a more fine-grained level, our\nappreciation of particular effects—of color and composition,\nexpression, narrative structure, and so on—depends on the\neffects themselves but also on background acknowledgment of their\ndegree of difficulty or innovation in the relevant medium. One worry\nwith digital art is that its production relies on the computer\nautomation of many of the tasks, both manual and cognitive,\ntraditionally involved in making art. The effects achieved by computer\nautomation cannot be assessed in the same way as those achieved by\ntraditional “hands-on” artistic methods. The terms of our\nappreciation, therefore, need to be adjusted in the digital age. This\nis certainly compatible with the continued relevance of medium-based\nappreciation, as long as we can make sense of digital media as\nartistic media (Binkley 1998). But there is a strong tendency in film\nand media studies to assume that the medium has absolutely no role to\nplay in the appreciation of digital art.  Summing up this view, it supposedly follows from the fact that\nmodern (digital) computers encode every kind of information in the\nsame way—i.e., as a sequence of binary digits—that an\nartwork that crucially relies in its production on computer processing\nis no longer defined by its mode of presentation, whether in images,\nmoving images, sound patterns, or text. A work’s display is\nrendered merely contingent by the fact that it is generated from a\ncommon code. By adding a particular instruction to the code sequence\nspecifying a work, imagery associated with that work could be\ninstantaneously converted into sounds or text, or just into different\nimagery. This possibility alone supposedly renders meaningless all\ntalk of an artwork being in a particular medium and being properly\nappreciated in terms of that medium (Kittler 1999; Doane\n2007).  Given the considerable effects of digital technology on artistic\nproduction, it is perhaps understandable that some commentators are\ninclined toward a radical overhauling of art theoretical concepts. But\ntheir arguments in support of such an overhaul are, at best,\nincomplete. We see this once we cite some important continuities\nbetween ways of making and thinking about art in the analog age and in\nthe digital age. It has always been the case, for example, that\n“any medium can be translated into any other” (Kittler\n1999: 1): without using a computer, someone could manually devise a\nset of rules (an algorithm) for the translation of image values, say,\ninto sounds or text. Moreover, a common storage and transmission means\nfor (moving) imagery and sound is not unique to digital technology: As\nDoron Galili points out (2011), electronic image transmission going\nback to the late nineteenth century—in other words, precursors\nof the TV—relies on the conversion of both images and sound into\nelectronic pulses.  Apart from these important continuities, the media\ntheorist’s inference from translatability to medium-free art\nsimply does not hold. That we could set about\n“translating” the imagery of Citizen Kane into a\nsymphony does not mean that the original artwork lacks a medium; it is\na movie, after all, and as such, it has to be in the medium of moving\nimages. The symphonic translation of Citizen Kane is not the\nsame work as the 1941 movie by Orson Welles. This reminds us that, in\ndeciding whether there is a digital medium, we must not reduce the\nmedium to the artist’s materials, for it also matters how the\nartist uses those materials. Nor must we limit the constitutive\nmaterials of a medium to physical materials. The case of literature\nshows that neither the materials of an art form, nor their modes of\nmanipulation, need be physical. The medium of literature is neither\npaper and ink nor abstract lexical symbols, but letters and words used\nin certain ways. There are, of course, many different ways of\nphysically storing and transmitting literary works, including by the\nprinted page, in audio recordings, and by memory (human or computer).\nBut from the fact that The Tale of Two Cities can be\npreserved in many different formats, it does not follow that this\nnovel is any less decisively a novel and, as such, in the medium of\nliterature.  Just as with a literary work, the preservation and transmission of\ndigital works in different formats depends on the use of a common\ncode, but a binary numeric code rather than a lexical one. If words\nand their literary uses constitute the medium of literature, then\nbinary code, along with the information it implements, and its\nartistic uses constitute the medium of digital art. This allows for\nthe possibility that the digital medium contains various sub-media, or\n“nested” media (Gaut 2010). For instance, within the\nmedium of digital art, the medium of digital visual art comprises\nartistic uses of computer code specifically to create images. In\ntechnical terms, such uses can be referred to as (artistic)\n“bitmapping”, given that a computer ultimately stores all\nimages (2D and 3D vector) as bitmaps, code sequences that specify the\nintegers assigned to light intensity measurements in a pixel grid. The\nmedium of bitmapping is thus distinguished by a kind of digital\ntechnology, but the kind used to produce just those items belonging to\nthe traditional medium of images.  Once the notion of digital media is revealed to be no more\nconfused or mysterious than the familiar notion of literary media, its\nirreducible role in appreciation becomes apparent. To take just one\nexample, proper appreciation of movies in the digital age depends on\nrecognizing that digital movie-making tools do not just make\ntraditional movie-making easier; they also present new creative\npossibilities and challenges. Given the maturity and mass-art status\nof the cinematic art form, it is easy to take for granted the medium\nof moving imagery; we may think we know precisely its limits, and we\nmay even think we have seen everything that can be done with it. The\ndigital medium is different, however, and digital cinema is in both\nthe medium of moving imagery and the digital medium.  At first glance, it might seem odd to speak of\n“challenges” or “limits” in relation to\ndigital processes, which allow for instantaneous and endless\nmodification with increasingly user-friendly applications and\ndevices. The high degree of automation in the process of capturing an\nimage with a digital video camera, along with increasingly high image\nresolution and memory capacity, could make it seem as though digital\nimages are too easily achieved to be interesting. Then there are the\npractically endless possibilities for “correcting” the\ncaptured image with applications like Photoshop. Digital sound\nrecording is likewise increasingly automated, increasingly\nfine-grained, and reliant on ever-larger computer memory\ncapacities. Modifying and mastering recorded sound with digital\nediting software allows for an unlimited testing of options. In\ndigital movie editing, sequence changes are instantaneous and entirely\nreversible—quite unlike when the editing process involved the\nphysical cutting and splicing of a film (image or sound)\nstrip. Digital tools thus allow moviemakers to focus (almost) purely\non the making of choices about the look and sound of the movie without\nhaving to worry about the technical difficulty or finality of\nimplementation.  Rather than dismissing all digital works as too easily achieved to\nbe interesting, medium-based appreciation requires that we consider\nthe digital on its own terms and allow for the possibility that\ncertain kinds of increased technical efficiency can bring new creative\nrisks. For example, even though committing to certain editorial\ndecisions does not entail irreversible alterations to a filmstrip,\narriving at those decisions involves sifting through and eliminating\nfar more options, a process which can easily become overwhelming and\ntherefore more error-ridden.  When we properly appreciate a digital\nmovie, therefore, part of what we need to appreciate is the\nsignificance of any scene or sequence looking just the way it does\nwhen it could have, so easily, looked so many other ways. Similarly,\nwhen we properly appreciate an interactive digital installation or\nvideogame, we are, in part, appreciating certain representations,\nfunctions, and capabilities of the input-output system that are made\npossible by digital media. This is undeniably a form of medium-based\nappreciation, but the medium to which we appeal is the digital medium\nrather than traditional media. If the digital medium is computer code\nused in certain ways—for example, to make moving images, then it\nis only when we think of a digital movie as in this medium that we can\nappreciate it as a particular response to the creative problem,\nintroduced by coding, of finalizing selections from a vast array of\nequally and instantly available options.  The case of digital cinema is perhaps a useful starting point for\nwork in the philosophy of digital art. Digital cinema is a multi-media\nart form, after all, involving 2D and 3D moving images as well as\nsound, and with the potential for robust interactivity, whereby\naudiences select story events or otherwise modify a movie’s\nscreening in prescribed ways (Gaut 2010: 224–43). Many of the\ndigital tools developed by the movie and video game industries are now\navailable more widely to artists interested in making other forms of\ndigital art, including net art, digital sound installations, and\nvirtual reality art (Grau 2003; Chalmers 2017; Tavinor 2019). In terms\nof how the use of these tools affects proper appreciation, there are\nimportant continuities between the movie-making context and the wider\ndigital art world. In addition, the philosophy of film is a\nwell-established subfield in aesthetics, one that engages with both\nfilm theory and cognitive science in order to explicate the nature of\nfilm as a mass art (Thomson-Jones 2014, Other Internet Resources). For\nmany of the standard topics in the philosophy of film, interesting and\nimportant questions arise when we extend the discussion from analog to\ndigital cinema.  There is a question, for example, about the kinds and\nsignificance of realism that can be achieved with traditional\ncelluloid film as compared with manipulated digital imagery (Gaut\n2010: 60–97). The philosophy of film can provide some of the\ninitial terms of analysis for artworks in a broad range of digital\nmedia. At the same time, it is important to approach the digital arts\non their own terms under the assumption that the digital is an\nartistically significant category. \nMore and more, contemporary artists are taking advantage of the\ndynamic and responsive capabilities of digital media to make their art\ninteractive. The experimental online literature, conceptual browser\nart, and videogames mentioned above require user interactivity, but\nall to varying degrees. Therefore, if interactivity plays a\ndistinctive role in the digital arts, there are good reasons to\nanalyse the nature of these works more deeply. \nNot all digital works are interactive, and not all interactive works\nare digital. However, since computers are inherently interactive, much\nof the early philosophical literature on interactivity arose from the\nemergence of computer art (also see Smuts 2009; Lopes 2001; Saltz\n1997). The distinctive character of interactive digital art is best\nconsidered in tandem with the work’s ontology. \nAll interactive artworks, digital and non-digital, have dual\nontological structures that consist of properties belonging to the\nwork and properties that belong to the work’s instances. So far,\nthis is not so different than performance works like music and dance,\nor even digital photographs that can be multiply instantiated. Where\ndigitally interactive works are concerned, certain properties of the\nwork are borne by the work’s algorithm, whereas properties of\nthe instances are brought about by the user’s interaction. \nGiven that appreciation of certain artworks is embedded in a\nuser’s interactivity, philosophers are then tasked with defining\ninteractive art in a manner that eliminates unsanctioned actions from\nconstituting a kind of interactive work. One could imagine, for\nexample, someone hacking into a digital file to manipulate a digital\nimage, thus generating new instance-properties of the work. That, and\nmore benign actions such as reading chapters of, let us say, a\ndigitized copy of The Brothers Karamazov in random order may\nchange the properties of the work, but such activities are not\nprescribed. This, once again, underscores the importance of the\nartist’s sanction. Bearing this in mind and relating it to\ncomputer art, Dominic Lopes offers the following definition, “A\nwork of art is interactive just in case it prescribes\nthat the actions of its users help generate its\ndisplay” (Lopes 2010:36, original emphasis). Similarly, Berys\nGaut’s definition states that “a work is interactive just\nin case it authorizes that its audience’s actions partly\ndetermine its instances and their features” (Gaut 2010: 143,\noriginal emphasis). In specifying certain actions as prescribed and\nauthorized, these often-cited definitions restrict the kinds of works\nthat ought or ought not be considered candidates for an interactive\nart category. \nThe capability of a work to generate instance-properties from the\nuser’s actions is recognized within philosophical aesthetics as\na distinctive feature of interactive artworks. However, given the\nontological similarities between performance works and interactive\nones, it follows that one may question the specific roles of\n‘user’ and ‘audience’ in the definitions presented\nabove. Lopes clarifies that, \nA person plays the role of a user in generating a display of a work\nonly if he or she (1) generates the display, (2) exploring the work,\nso that (3) an audience attends to the work partly by attending to his\nor her doing (1) and (2) (Lopes 2010: 82). \nUsers explore a work by generating the display via a computational\nprocess. For Lopes, the user and audience can be the same, but they\nneed not be. For philosophers of art, the above conception falls just\nshy of fully excluding performance works from a category of\ninteractive art (Gaut 2010; Kania 2018). Afterall, it can be argued\nthat a musician similarly engages in (1), (2), and (3) when she\nperforms a specific work. If this is the case, the terms\n‘user’ and ‘audience’ are not always\nsynonymous, unless it is stipulated that for interactive works the\nidentity of users and audiences are identical. This is atypical of\nnon-interactive performance works where a performer plays for\nan audience, beyond him or herself. This distinctive user-audience\nrelationship also suggests that adequate appreciation of a work is not\ngranted by merely observing a user interact with it (Kania 2018:\n188). \nThe aforementioned words ‘instance’ and\n‘display’ (used interchangeably here) can be applied to\nboth interactive and non-interactive works characterized by a two-level\nontology. Nevertheless, there are significant metaphysical\ndifferences between works like an interactive digital installation or\nvideogame and others like a digital photograph. One of the more\nsignificant distinctions has to do with the structure of the displays;\ndisplays of interactive works are variable in ways the displays of\nnon-interactive works are not (Lopes 2010). More precisely stated, the\ndisplays of interactive works are considered variable if they have a\nsuccession of states or they are repeatable (Lopes 2010: 37–38). To\ncharacterize the first kind of variability, consider the following\ndescription of the digital installation “Universe of Water\nParticles on a Rock where People Gather” (henceforth, where\nPeople Gather) by TeamLab: \nThe Rock where People Gather is reproduced in a virtual\nthree-dimensional space. Water is simulated to fall onto the rock, and\nthe flow of the water draws the shape of the waterfall. The water is\nrepresented by a continuum of numerous water particles and the\ninteraction between the particles is then calculated. Lines are drawn\nin relation to the behavior of the water particles. The lines are then\n“flattened” using what TeamLab considers to be\nultrasubjective space. \nWhen a person stands on the rock or touches the waterfall, they too\nbecome like a rock that changes the flow of water. The flow of water\ncontinues to transform in real time due to the interaction of\npeople. Previous visual states can never be replicated, and will never\nreoccur (TeamLab 2018). \nUsers interact with the work to generate variations in the succession\nof displays, but none of the previous states are repeatable. Compare\nthis with the second kind of display variability. Digital works that\nare networked, such as most net art and videogames, are repeatable\nbecause they can be multiply accessed and instantiated by different\nusers, in different places, and all at once; variations are generated\nwhen the work is repeated. Although repeatable digital works are\npossible due to digital media’s unique transmissible nature,\nmore needs to be said about how this trait distinguishes interactive\ndigital works from non-interactive digital images. \nIf the displays of digital photographs vary from instance to instance\ndue to different settings on different devices (e.g., brightness,\nresolution, intensity), then the aesthetic and structural differences\nof all works with multiple displays need to be considered in greater\ndetail. Consider, for example, that with many videogames, players can\nchoose which route to take, quests to accept, characters to\nkill or save, personalities to adopt, and the like. These sorts of\nin-game player choices are not merely features that generate varying\nresolutions and the like: the interactivity shapes the stories that\nunfold, which can be reshaped during another playing of the same game\nfor very different outcomes. In these cases, strong variability occurs\nbecause the works consist of differing multiple displays\n(Preston 2014). For clarification, Dominic Preston says, \nfor any given artwork, each possible set of structural and aesthetic\nproperties F is a display type of that artwork.  (Preston 2014:\n271, original emphasis). \nFrom the above, we can briefly infer the following scenarios: digital\nphotographs are ontologically similar to plays and music because they\nconsist of one display type, but multiple displays given subtle\nvariances between the particular tokens. Works that instance a\nsuccession of states such as “where People Gather” consist\nof multiple potential display types but where only one display is\ninstantiated at any given time. Now, compare such works with those\nlike videogames and comparable interactive digital examples that\npresent us with strong degrees of display variability to such an\nextent that we might re-classify the work’s genre depending upon the\noutcomes. For example, one playthrough might end in a tragedy but,\ngiven a player’s different choices, end in a non-tragedy at\nanother time, to list just one example. Under a Prestonian view of\ndisplay types, these sorts of works consist of both multiple display\ntypes and multiple displays, which means users will generate one of the\npossible display types each time they repeat the work. While this\nconcept is mostly applicable to videogames, one could imagine\ninteractive digital installations or net art with similar degrees of\nvariability.  It is important to reiterate that the strong interactivity just\ndescribed is not distinctively digital. Whilst interactivity is a\nstandard feature of many contemporary digital works, and the\nresponsiveness of such works is remarkable, non-digital appreciative\ncategories can also exploit a similar degree of display\nvariability. For example, literature, theater, and tabletop role\nplaying games can be strongly interactive similarly to many digital\nartworks. What is unique about all such works are the ways in which\nthings like immersion, agency, identity, and fictions, to list a few,\nare impacted by the interactivity, due to the user’s role in the\nwork (for more, see Robinson & Tavinor 2018; Patridge 2017; Meskin\n& Robson 2016). \nAlthough they have only begun to scratch the surface, philosophers of\nart have done a good deal to stress the significance of both digital\nmedia and interactivity in the arts, as well as their ongoing\ninfluence in changing philosophical conceptions of art and artistic\npractices. However, further investigation is needed on topics such as\nforms of realism distinctive of digital image-based art, digital\nconceptual art, art categories and media distinctions in relation to\ndigital art, and the impact of digital technology on practices of\nmaking, displaying, and appreciating art. Given that digital media\nconnect physical locations to virtual ones, it is also worth exploring\nthe ways in which the connectivity and mobility of digital art\nchallenge our traditional notions of site-specificity and\nlocation-specific art. On a related note are the social (and perhaps\npolitical) implications of digital art, which are also of growing\ninterest.","contact.mail":"Katherine.Thomson-Jones@oberlin.edu","contact.domain":"oberlin.edu"},{"date.published":"2015-02-23","date.changed":"2019-08-01","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/digital-art/","author1":"Katherine Thomson-Jones","author2":"Shelby Moser","author1.info":"http://oberlin.edu/faculty/kthomson","entry":"digital-art","body.text":"\n\nThe philosophy of digital art is the study of\nthe nature and appreciative grounds of all those kinds of art whose\nproduction and presentation crucially involves computer processing.\nThis first-order inquiry cannot proceed without acknowledgment of\nclaims made by media and cultural theorists, art theorists and art\naudiences, concerning the way digital image- and sound-making\ntechnologies are fundamentally changing our understanding of art, physical\nrepresentation, and perceptual experience. These claims suggest that\nthe “digital condition” (Kittler 1999) induces a loss of trust in the\nimage, a new way of experiencing the world as indeterminate and\nfragmentary, and a breakdown of traditional boundaries between artist\nand audience, artwork and artistic process. Testing these claims\nrequires a formal understanding of the distinction between analog and\ndigital systems and the implications of that distinction for aesthetic\nappreciation. The philosophy of digital art proceeds from a carefully\narticulated general account of digital representation to an\ninvestigation of the precise ways in which different kinds of digital\nart are digital. This leads to further investigation into the ways\nan artwork’s digital status bears on its appropriate\nappreciation.  By conducting a systematic analysis of the digital as\nan artistically significant category, the philosophy of digital art\nseeks to ground burgeoning interdisciplinary and popular interest in\nthe so-called “digital revolution”.\n\n\nAlthough technology-based art is viewed as being part of the\n“the final avant-garde of the twentieth-century” (Rush\n2005), and digital art has been part of the mainstream art world since\nthe late 1900s (Paul 2008), the philosophy of digital art is still an\nemerging subfield. Three seminal monographs, one on videogames\n(Tavinor 2009), one on digital cinema (Gaut 2010), and one on computer\nart (Lopes 2010), have been invaluable in laying the groundwork\nconcerning philosophical questions about art and computer\ntechnology. Since these publications, further philosophical attention\nhas been given to the digital arts, including the first published\nvolume to focus on the aesthetics of videogames (see Robson &\nTavinor, eds., 2018). However, there is still a great deal of\nphilosophical work to be done. In particular, work is needed to provide a general conceptual\nframework for an interdisciplinary discussion of the true extent to\nwhich the digital has revolutionized art and media.\n\nIn its broadest extant sense, “digital art” refers to\nart that relies on computer-based digital encoding, or on the\nelectronic storage and processing of information in different\nformats—text, numbers, images, sounds—in a common binary\ncode. The ways in which art-making can incorporate computer-based\ndigital encoding are extremely diverse. A digital photograph may be\nthe product of a manipulated sample of visual information captured\nwith a digital camera from a “live” scene or captured with\na scanner from a traditional celluloid photograph. Music can be\nrecorded and then manipulated digitally or created digitally with\nspecialized computer software. And a movie is now the product of an\nextremely complex sequence of choices between analog and digital\nprocesses at the stages of image and sound capture or composition,\nimage and sound editing, color correction or sound mastering, special\neffects production, and display or projection.  The complexity of the digital cinema workflow draws attention to a\nfurther difference concerning whether reliance on the digital is\nrestricted to the way an artwork is made or extends to the display of\nthe work. A work may be made on a computer—say, a musical work\ncomposed with Sibelius or a play written in Microsoft Word—and yet meant\nfor apprehension in a non-digital format—say, performance on\ntraditional musical instruments or enactment on stage. Similarly, a\nmovie could be captured and edited digitally before being printed on\ntraditional 35mm photochemical film for projection in theaters. By\ncontrast, works which are purely digital include a film made and\nprojected digitally—for example, Avatar (2009), a\npiece of music composed and played back electronically—for\nexample, the electroacoustic works of Gottfried Michael Koenig\n(see Other Internet Resources), and a work of\nASCII art—an image made up from the 95 printable characters\ndefined by the ASCII standard of 1963 and displayed on a computer\nmonitor. An example of ASCII art is: \nPurely digital works include interactive works such as videogames and\ndigital installations. Videogames are arguably the newest digital\nworks to be recognized as a potential art form, although Brock Rough\n(2018) claims that under certain circumstances, videogames and art are\nincompatible. Additionally, many interactive digital installations in\nthe museum borrow videogame mechanics, which factor as prominent\nfeatures to appreciate (Paul 2008). \nEach of the examples above incorporates a computational process, to\nsome degree, in the presentation of the work. In many ways, works\ncomprised of digital media stand in stark contrast to those made by\ncompletely analog means. The classical account of the analog-digital distinction is found in\nNelson Goodman’s Languages of Art (1976). In fact\nGoodman’s account remains practically the only general\naccount of the distinction. While David Lewis (1971) raises a series\nof objections to Goodman’s account, Lewis’ alternative\naccount applies only to the representation of numbers. And while John\nHaugeland (1981) returns to the general distinction, he effectively\nqualifies and re-frames Goodman’s account in order to overcome\nLewis’s and other potential objections. A few philosophers\ninterested in clarifying the concepts employed by cognitive scientists\nhave recognized the need for a general account of the analog-digital\ndistinction (e.g., Dretske 1981; Blachowicz 1997; Katz 2008; Maley\n2011). But in this context, as well, Goodman’s account is the\nessential point of reference. In some ways, this is surprising or at\nleast striking: As Haugeland points out, the digital is a\n“mundane engineering notion” (1981: 217). Yet the\nphilosophical context in which the notion receives its fullest\nanalysis is that of aesthetics. As is well-known, Goodman’s\ninterests in this context center on the role of musical notation in\nfixing the identity of musical works. But a musical notation is also a\nstandard example of a digital system.  On Goodman’s broad, structuralist way of thinking,\nrepresentational systems in general consist of sets of possible\nphysical objects that count as token representations. Objects are\ngrouped under syntactic and semantic types, and interesting\ndifferences between kinds of representational system track differences\nin the way syntactic and semantic types relate to one another. Digital\nsystems are distinguished by being differentiated as opposed\nto dense. The condition of syntactic differentiation\nis met when the differences between classes of token representations\nare limited such that it is possible for users of the system always to\ntell that a token belongs to at most one class. The condition\nof semantic differentiation is met when the extension of each\ntype, or the class of referents corresponding to a class of token\nrepresentations, differs in limited ways from the extension of any\nother type; so that users of the system can always tell that a\nreferent belongs to at most one extension.  Goodman provides the\nfollowing example of a simple digital computer, a system that meets\nthe conditions of both syntactic and semantic differentiation: Say we\nhave an instrument reporting on the number of dimes dropped into a toy\nbank with a capacity for holding 50 dimes, where the count is reported\nby an Arabic numeral on a small display (Goodman 1976: 159). In this\nsystem, the syntactic types are just the numbers 0–50, which\nhave as their instances the discrete displays, at different times, of\nthe corresponding Arabic numerals. Both conditions of syntactic and\nsemantic differentiation are met because the relevant differences\nbetween instances of different numbers are both highly circumscribed\nand conspicuous. This means that users of the system can be expected\nto be able to read the display, or determine which number is\ninstantiated on the display (syntactic differentiation) and which\nnumerical value, or how many coins, is thereby being indicated\n(semantic differentiation).  Analog representation fails to be differentiated because it is\ndense. With an ordering of types such that between any two types,\nthere is a third, it is impossible to determine instantiation of at\nmost one type. Not every case involving a failure of finite\ndifferentiation is a case of density. However, a traditional\nthermometer is such that heights of mercury that differ to any degree\ncount as distinct syntactic types, the kinds of things that can differ\nsemantically. Similarly, for pictures distinguished according to\nregions of color, for any two pictures, no matter how closely similar,\none can always find a third more similar to each of them than they are\nto each other. Density is a feature of any system that measures\ncontinuously varying values. That is, as long as the system in\nquestion is designed so that any difference in magnitude indicates a\ndifference in type.  Returning to the digital, some commentators have questioned\nwhether Goodman’s condition of (syntactic and semantic) finite\ndifferentiation is sufficient to distinguish the kind of\nrepresentation in question (Haugeland 1981; Lewis 1971). John\nHaugeland, for example, argues that there can be differentiated\nschemes without the “copyability” feature that defines the\npractical significance of digital systems. Haugeland’s solution\nis to require the practical and not just the theoretical possibility\nof a system’s users determining type membership. In fact,\nhowever, Goodman himself would likely accept this modification. In a\nlater work, Goodman explicitly states that finite differentiation must\nmake it possible to determine type membership “by means\navailable and appropriate to the given user of the given scheme”\n(Goodman and Elgin 1988: 125).  Whether or not a work of digital art is a work of representational\nart, and even with the most abstract works of digital art, there are\nlayers of representation involved in the complex processes of their\nproduction and presentation. Most of these layers, and arguably the\nmost important ones, are digital. Where there are analog systems\ninvolved, digital translation makes possible the realization of the\nvalues of the final work. This is perhaps best seen with paradigmatic\ncases of digital art. Consider the following two early works: The first of these works involves digital moving imagery that is\nentirely generated by a computer program. At the same time, the video\nlooks like it was or could have been recorded in an actual office\nsetting. The particular significance of the work depends on the viewer\nbeing aware of its digital composition while at the same time being\nstruck by its photorealistic familiarity. According to the San Francisco\nMuseum of Modern Art (SF MoMA),  Kalpakjian thus reveals the complete artificiality\nof the built environments we inhabit, and their aesthetic distance\nfrom more humanistic forms.  (SF MoMA n.d.)  The second work involves imagery that was initially captured\ndigitally. Arcangel began by taking 360-degree photographs of his\nhometown of Buffalo, New York.  He scanned and modified the\nphotographs on his computer so that they could be coded according to\nthe graphics capabilities of the Nintendo gaming system, and in order\nto give the images the distinctive look and feel of the Mario Bros\ngame. Arcangel then programmed the landscape imagery to scroll\ncontinuously across a TV screen, as in the Mario Bros game. Finally,\nArcangel melted the chips in a Super Mario cartridge, replacing them\nwith his self-manufactured chips so that his landscape\n“game” could be run on any Nintendo system. As well as all\nthe ways in which Arcangel’s work relies on both the technology\nand aesthetics of videogames, there are clearly ways in which it\ndeliberately removes or blocks certain key features or capacities of\nvideogames, perhaps most notably their robust interactivity. Playing a\nvideogame essentially involves the prescribed creation of new display\ninstances of a work. But we do not “play” Landscape\nStudy #4, and its imagery is fixed by the artist. The kind of\ninteractivity typical of videogames can also be found in artworks made\nwithout computers (see Lopes 2010: 49). But this type of interactivity\nis most closely associated with digital art because it is so much\neasier to achieve with the use of computers. This suggests a high\ndegree of self-consciousness in Arcangel’s decision to block the\ninteractivity of his reverse-engineered videogame. From the\nperspective of the philosophy of digital art, such a decision\nhighlights the need for further discussion of the link between the\nnature of the digital and the nature of interactivity.  What is it about the ways in which the works by Arcangel and\nKalpakjian are made that makes them digital in an appreciatively\nrelevant sense? Computer imaging depends on the inherent\nprogrammability and automation of digital computers. Digital image\ncapture depends on sampling and subsequently on the near-instantaneous\nprocesses of discrete coding.  None of this would be possible without\na series of linked systems each with finitely differentiated\nsettings. \nAt the most basic level, the myriad transistors in a computer are\nessentially tiny digital schemes, each with two types: the\n“on” and “off” settings of the\ntransistor-capacitor switch. The settings are discrete and\ndistinguishable, as are their compliance classes, of 1s and 0s. The\nubiquity of binary code in computer processing is a consequence of the\nfact that a digital computer is essentially a vast collection of\non-off switches. A particular sequence of 1s and 0s realized at a\nparticular time in virtue of the requisite arrangement of transistors\nis a binary instance of a particular number, interchangeable with all\nother instances of the same number and with no instances of different\nnumbers. The difference between instances of one number and instances\nof other numbers is strictly limited to the difference in the ordering\nof 1s and 0s. In other words, Goodman’s condition of finite\ndifferentiation is clearly met. In turn, the numbers can refer to\nother values, including the light-intensity values of an image. A\ncomputation simply involves the generation of output strings of binary\ndigits from input strings in accordance with a general rule that\ndepends on the properties of the strings (Piccinini 2008). The modern\n(digital) computer encodes both data and instructions of human\nreadable code and assembly languages as sequences of binary digits, or\nbits, and allows for the internal storage of instructions. This makes\nthe computer essentially programmable in the sense that it can be\nmodified to compute new functions simply by being fed an appropriate\narrangement of bits.  A program is a list of instructions, and instructions are strings\nof digits. The modern digital computer has components that serve to\ncopy and store programs inside the machine, and to supply instructions\nto the computer’s processing units for implementation in the\nappropriate order. The outputs of a system can be dependent on\nspecific inputs often in tandem with the conditional if-then\nstatements. This is what is involved in a computer executing\nconditional branching instructions such that it can monitor and\nrespond to its own intermediate computational states and even modify\ninstructions based on its own processes. Such modifications are\ndictated by an algorithm—the program’s set of rules and\noperations. It is the digital computer’s capacity for branching,\ndue to its digital programmability, that allows for the kinds of\nhigher-level automation involved in the use of imaging applications\nand sequential image-generation. Our artists, Kalpakjian and Arcangel,\ndo not have to enter the strings of digits for every basic operation\nof the computer that underlies the complex operations involved in\ndescribing and manipulating images (among other features). If they did\nhave to do this, they would never finish making their\nartworks. Rather, artists can rely on open-source code, libraries, or\ncommercial software that automatically and instantaneously supplies the\nlines of code required for the execution of their decisions.  The imaging software with which Kalpakjian works allows him to\ngenerate architectural interiors in rich detail. Arcangel does not\nrequire as much from his imaging software given that he is\nmanipulating previously captured and scanned images. The process of\nscanning the photographs, just like the process involved in digital\nphotography, involves sampling and quantization of a visual source;\nassigning an integer, from a finite range, to the average\nlight-intensity measured across each small area of source-space\ncorresponding to a cell in a grid. This process involves averaging and\nrounding up values, and it involves measurement, or sampling, of light\nintensities at (spatially and temporally) discrete intervals. Some,\nindeed many, of the differences in light intensity across the source\nimage or scene (and at different times, in the case of moving imagery)\nare thereby dropped by the process of digital image-capture. Among\nsome media theorists, this fact has led to deep suspicion of the\ndigitally recorded image, prompting the feeling that the digital image\nis always a poor substitute for the analog. Current digital\ntechnologies for image-capture and display have such high rates of\nsampling frequency and resolution that the values dropped in\nquantization are well below the threshold of human perception. At the\nsame time, Arcangel’s Landscape Study #4  reminds us\nthat digital artists may choose to exploit visible pixellation for\nparticular artistic ends.  A digitally recorded image need not appear any less richly\ndetailed or varied in color than an analog image. All the same, in the\nterms of D. N.  Rodowick, whereas the analog photograph is an\n“isomorphic transcription” of its subject, a digital\nphotograph is a “data-output”, with a\nsymbolically-mediated link to its subject (Rodowick 2007:\n117–8). This ontological divide—described by William\nJ. Mitchell as a “sudden and decisive rupture” in the\nhistory of photography (1994: 59), is then assumed to have aesthetic\nimplications: Rodowick insists that the “discontinuities”\nin digital information “produce perceptual or aesthetic\neffects”. Despite this insistence, however, Rodowick goes on to\nacknowledge that, with enough resolution, “a digital photograph\ncan simulate the look of a continuously produced analogical\nimage”. This concession would seem to work against any attempt\nto identify the aesthetic effects of pixellation, even if “the\npixel grid remains in the logical structure of the image”\n(Rodowick 2007: 119). But if we are to interpret Rodowick charitably,\nhe could be implying that ontology at least partly determines\nappropriate appreciation; even if a digital photograph can look just\nlike an analog photograph, its (known) digital status affects which of\nits perceptible features are aesthetically relevant and how we\nappropriately engage with them. The media theorists’ worry about the impoverished digital\nimage primarily refers to the production of digital images\nwith its reliance on sampling and quantization. But there are also\nanalogous worries one could have about the\ndigital presentation of images, worries about deep structural\nchanges to analog images once they are displayed digitally—for\nexample, on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen or when projected\ndigitally on a flat surface. Of course one could simply be interested\nin investigating these structural changes without being particularly\nworried about them.  This shall be our approach.  The traditional method of film reel projection has been a\nremarkably stable and entrenched technology, remaining largely\nunchanged for over a century.  But digital projection is on the rise,\nparticularly in conjunction with the networked distribution of\nmovies. And although movie audiences may not be able to see the\ndifference on screen between analog and digital projection, their\nexpectations are changing—for example, about what can go wrong\nin the presentation of a movie. A deeper assumption that has not\nchanged, one that is almost universal among film scholars, is that\ncinema fundamentally depends on an illusion. Cinema is the art of\nmoving images and thus its very existence depends on our being tricked\ninto seeing a rapid succession of static images as a persistent moving\nimage. In the philosophy of film, there is a small debate about the\nstatus of cinematic motion—whether it really is an illusion as\nis commonly assumed. An analysis of digital projection technology\nreveals new complexities in this debate but ultimately provides\nadditional reasons to stick with the popular illusionist view.  Traditional and digital projection methods could not appear more\ndifferent: the former involves running a flexible film strip through a\nmechanical projector; the latter involves a complex array of\nmicromirrors on semiconductor chips, which, in combination with a\nprism and a lamp, generate projectable images from binary\ncode. Nevertheless, both are methods for generating the impression of\na continuously illuminated, persistent moving image from a sequence of\nstatic images. Compared with traditional projection, however, digital\nprojection includes an extra step, whereby the images in the static\nsequence are generated from flashes of light. In order to generate\neach image in the digital projector, a light beam from a high-powered\nlamp is separated by a prism into its color components of red, blue,\nand green. Each color beam then hits a different Digital Micromirror\nDevice (DMD), which is a semiconductor chip covered with more than a\nmillion tiny, hinged mirrors. Based on the information encoded in the\nvideo signal, the DMDs selectively turn over some of the tiny mirrors\nto reflect the colored lights. Most of the tiny mirrors are flipped\nthousands of times a second in order to create the gradations of light\nand dark making up a monochromatic, pixellated image—a mirror\nthat is flipped on a greater proportion of the time will reflect more\nlight and so will form a brighter pixel than a mirror that is not\nflipped on for so long. Each DMD reflects a monochromatic image back\nto the prism, which then recombines the colors to form the projected,\nfull-color image. This image—if it were held for long enough on\nthe screen—would be perceived as static. In order then to\nproduce the impression of motion in the projected, full-color image,\nthe underlying memory array of the DMDs has to update rapidly so that\nall the micromirrors are released simultaneously and allowed to move\ninto a new “address state”, providing new patterns of\nlight modulation for successive, slightly different images.  The two-stage process of digital projection, whereby each image in\na static sequence is generated by flashing light and the impression of\na moving image is then generated by the rapid execution of the\nsequence, draws attention to the metaphysical complexity of the\nquestion of how movies move. In particular, one is unlikely to\ndetermine the status of the impression of motion that makes possible\nthe art of cinema unless one can determine the status of the imagery\nthat is seen to move. Given that motion involves an object occupying\ncontiguous spatial locations in successive moments of time, a moving\nobject must be re-identifiable over time. A moving image in a film,\narising as it does out of the rapid display of a succession of still\nimages, is not obviously a persistent object that can be seen to\nmove. Then again, perhaps it is enough that ordinary viewers identify\nan image—say of a moving train— as the same image, for the\nmoving image to persist (Currie 1996).  Alternatively, the moving\nimage could be thought to persist as a second-order physical entity\nconstituted by a sequence of flashing light (Ponech 2006).  The second proposal immediately runs into trouble with digital\nprojection. If the traditionally projected moving image exists as a\nseries of flashes of light, in digital projection, other\n“intermediate” objects must be granted existence—for\nexample, the stable point of light consisting of the rate of flashes,\nand gaps between them, of a single micromirror on the DMD. At the same\ntime, the moving image itself must be stripped of its existence since\nit does not consist of flashes of light. This is due to the fact that,\nin digital projection, there are no gaps between frames and so no\nunderlying, imperceptible alternation of light and dark. This leaves\nthe realist in the awkward position of claiming that the moving image\ngoes in and out of existence with the switch between analog and\ndigital projection technologies.  The first proposal, on which cinematic motion is a secondary\nquality, threatens to destroy the distinction between the apparent and\nthe illusory. It suggests a way of reinterpreting any case of\nperceptual illusion as a case involving the ascription of secondary\nqualities. That is, unless it can be shown that there are independent\nmeans of checking that we are mistaken about genuine illusions. But\neven if this can be shown, a problem remains: While there may not be\nan independent check for the motion in an image, there is likewise no\nindependent check for a genuine illusion of color. Given the contrived\nconditions of movie viewing, there is more reason to think of\ncinematic motion as akin to an illusory, than to a genuine, experience\nof color. With the introduction of digital projection, the conditions\nare arguably even more contrived. For it is not just movement in the\nimage but the image itself that is constituted by rapid flashes of\nlight. And the technology involved is far less accessible than that of\na traditional mechanical projector in the sense that one cannot, just\nby looking at the projection device, see (roughly) how it works. In\nthis way, an analysis of digital movie projection serves to reinforce\nthe traditional assumption that cinema is an art of illusion. In\naddition, however, the analysis suggests that the illusion at the\nheart of cinema is particularly impenetrable—akin to an illusion\nof color, and thus an illusion of a mere appearance that cannot be\nchecked (Thomson-Jones 2013). With digital movie projection, we begin to see the importance of\nunderstanding the technology of display for understanding the nature\nof digital art. Another way we see its importance is in relation to\nimages displayed on LCD screens. According to Goodman, images are\nessentially analog. Nevertheless, there seems to be a way for\nengineers to circumvent the essential analogicity of pictorial schemes\nby using digital technologies for encoded subphenomenal\ndiscrimination. Arguably, finite differentiation can be imposed on the\nscheme of all possible images displayed on high-resolution LCD\nscreens.  As we shall see, this has far-reaching implications for the\nways in which we think about and properly appreciate image-based\nart.  Both in his earlier and in his later work in aesthetics, Goodman\ncommits to “a special relation” between the analog and the\npictorial, one that is seen when we compare “the presystematic\nnotions of description and picture in a given culture”. Given\ntwo schemes, S and S′, where S\nconsists of all descriptions or predicates in a language such as\nEnglish, and S′ consists of all pictures, if we were\ntold only of the structures of S and S′, we\ncould distinguish the pictorial scheme by its being analog (Goodman\nand Elgin 1988: 130). The special relation remains, Goodman claims,\ndespite the possibility of a digital sub-scheme made up of black and\nwhite grid patterns all of which happen to be pictures. In such a\nscheme, the differences between patterned types that matter for the\nscheme’s being digital do not include all of the differences\nthat matter for distinguishing pictorial types. Pictures are\ndistinguished by color, shape, and size, which vary continuously; any\nvariation in color, shape, or size potentially results in a different\npicture. When we impose limits on the differences that matter for\ndistinguishing one grid pattern in the scheme from another, we are not\ninterpreting the grid patterns as pictures; if we were to do so, we\nwould have to treat them as members of a syntactically dense, an\nanalog, scheme.  Goodman’s insight about grid patterns and pictures suggests\nan immediate difficulty for explaining the digital status of images\ndisplayed on LCD screens: Clearly it will not be sufficient to point\nout that such images are pixellated, and therefore made up of small\nidentical building blocks that impose a lower limit on the differences\nbetween display-instances. Remember that pictures are defined by\ncolor, shape, and size, which vary continuously. This means that even\nif the physical pixels of an LCD screen are such that there are gaps\nbetween the possible shapes, sizes, and colors that the screen can\ninstantiate, and there are a finite number of shapes, sizes, and\ncolors that the screen can instantiate, there is still going to be\nvagueness at the limits of types. Any means of discretely carving up\nthe property spaces of color, shape, and size has to involve grouping\ninto types what are in fact (subphenomenally) distinct shapes, sizes,\nand colors, some of which may differ less from adjacent properties\ngrouped into other types. This makes it impossible always to determine\nunique class membership; hence, finite differentiation is not\nachieved.  Pixellation alone, no matter the resolution, cannot account for\nimages displayed on LCD screens belonging to a digital scheme; digital\nimages qua images thus remain stubbornly analog. But perhaps\nGoodman’s condition of finite differentiation can still be met\nwith a closer analysis of digital image technology. Current\ntechnologies for sampling and instantiating light intensities group\nobjective colors well below the level of phenomenal\ndiscrimination. For example, in the standard “Truecolor”\nsystem, a display pixel has three 8-bit subpixels, each of which emits\na different visible wavelength with an intensity from a range of 256\nvalues, yielding over 16 million objective colors. Such a large number\nof available colors gives the impression of a color continuum when, in\nfact, digital sampling technology has been used to carve up the\nobjective color space into a disjoint series of wavelength\nintensities. On the one hand, from the fact that display pixels can be\nlit at intensities between and indiscriminable from adjacent\ndiscriminable intensities, it seems to follow finite differentiation is\ndefeated. On the other hand, precisely because digital technology\ninvolves microtechnology and metrology for subphenomenal\ndiscrimination between colors, the light intensity groupings that are\nexpressed numerically as red-blue-green triplets in a system like\nTruecolor can be narrower than the objective color types that\ncontribute to the resultant image scheme. The key is keeping the\nvariations in the essentially analog properties of color, shape, and\nsize small enough so that they cannot accumulate to the point of\nmaking a difference to image perception (Zeimbekis 2012). The types in\nthe scheme of digital images are technologically segmented, transitive\ngroupings of the same color-, shape-, and size-experiences.  The\ncarving out of a transitive sub-set of magnitudes has to occur\nrelative to the needs of the users of the system. In the case of\ndigital color, the types are classes of light intensities\nsufficient to cause the same color experience for normal\nhuman perceivers. The replicability of digital images is made possible\nby the gap between the discriminatory limits of the human visual\nsystem and the discriminatory limits of digital sampling\ntechnology.  Digital images can be replicated insofar as they are digital and\nthus finitely differentiated. They are finitely differentiated because\nthey rely on subphenomenal sampling and display technology. In\npractical terms, replication depends on the use of binary code, even\nthough this is not in fact what makes images qua images\ndigital. Of course binary code representations are themselves part of\na digital scheme. But the role of binary code in image-instantiation\nis just one of consistent preservation; preservation for long enough\nto permit reproduction. Despite the inherent replicability of digital\nimages, it does not appear to follow automatically that artworks\ninvolving these images are multiples.   The SF MoMA is in possession of the original of Kalpakjian’s\nwork, Corridor; they control access to the video imagery. At\npresent, the work is not available to be viewed: it cannot be viewed\non-line as part of a digital archive or collection, nor is it\ncurrently on view in the physical space of the museum. The image\nsequence comprising the work could be multiply instantiated and widely\ndistributed, but in fact it is not. Similarly with Arcangel’s\nwork, Landscape Study #4: described as an installation, it is\nto be exhibited in a physical gallery alongside an arrangement of\nprinted stills, with a television connected to a Nintendo\nEntertainment System. Again, the image sequence displayed on the\ntelevision could be multiply instantiated and widely distributed, but\nit is not. Clips and copies of the landscape imagery are available\non-line, but these are not taken to instantiate parts of the work\nitself. By contrast, works of net art are instantiated whenever they\nare accessed by someone on-line.  There are many kinds of net art, including various forms of\nexperimental on-line literature, conceptual browser art, and works\ndrawing on software and computer gaming conventions. Extensive on-line\ncollections of visual and audiovisual net art are rigorously curated\nand at the same time immediately accessible to ordinary Internet\nusers. The contrast is striking, between the conventions of access and\npresentation, for works of net art and for works like those by\nKalpakjian and Arcangel. Perhaps a digital artwork comprising multiply\ninstantiable images need not itself be multiply instantiable. At this\npoint, in considering the factors determining the status of a digital\nvisual artwork, the philosophy of digital art joins an ongoing debate\nabout the ontology of art.  On the question of whether artworks are all the same kind of thing\nor many different kinds of things, ontological pluralism is often\ntaken to be implied by the primary role of the artist in\n“sanctioning” features of his or her work (Irvin 2005,\n2008; Thomasson 2010). A sanction can consist simply in a\nself-professed artist painting a canvas, say, and handing it over to a\ngallery with a title attached. The artist has sanctioned those\nfeatures of the work that make it a traditional painting. But what was\nonce largely implicit is now often explicit: many contemporary works\nof art are defined by a set of instructions for their presentation\n(e.g., aspect ratio, resolution). We can find similar examples of\nnon-digital works that are defined by a set of instructions such as\nFelix Gonzalez-Torres’ Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.) (1991),\nwhich is given to a gallery to display by way of nothing other than a\nset of instructions for constructing and maintaining a pile of\ncandies. Whether non-digital or digital, the instructions determine\nwhat is part of the work and what is not, and whether the work is\nsingular or multiply instantiable. As a result, the instructions guide\nappropriate interpretation of the work. On this view, ontology\nprecedes interpretation: we cannot properly and fully appreciate a\nwork, for the work that it is, without a prior determination of what\nit comprises.  This is a matter of contention, however. On another way\nof thinking, artworks just are objects of interpretation, and there is\nno artwork prior to interpretation whose boundaries can be identified\nbefore we begin interpretation (Davies 2004).  The issue of the relation between ontology and interpretation is a\ncomplex and difficult one, but progress likely can be made on the\nissue through an examination of digital art practices. This is\nparticularly in light of the high degree of self-consciousness with\nwhich many digital artists and digital art curators specify the\nfeatures of digital art works. It is common practice, for example,\nwhen archiving net art, to have artists fill out a questionnaire in\norder to specify which features of a work are crucial for its\npreservation—whether features of appearance, timing and motion,\ninteractivity potentials and methods, linking to other sites, or\nhardware and software. When a work of net art is individuated by its\nimagery, the artist has chosen to make the inherent replicability of\ndigital imagery part of his or her work. That this is a choice is\nsuggested by the existence of singular works of digital visual art,\nlike the examples discussed above. If indeed the works by Kalpakjian\nand Arcangel can function allographically—and certainly, this\nquestion requires further investigation (see D’Cruz and Magnus\n2014)—this would support a primary role for the artist’s\npresentation instructions in fixing, not just the art form\n(installation, movie, conceptual work, etc.) but the basic structure\nof the work: for example, whether the work is singular and thus\nidentical with a certain kind of physical display or multiple with no\noriginal display. Where interactive digital works are concerned,\nindividuation is determined by the algorithm. An algorithmic account\nof interactive digital art suggests that, although the code is\nimportant for adequate instantiation of the work, it is the algorithm\nthat specifies the crucial features of the work (Lopes 2010; Tavinor\n2011; Moser 2018). Since the code is, ontologically speaking, less\nrelevant than the algorithm, this account also makes allowances for\nthe variability that may be found in the code when an instance of a\nprogram is run on different kinds of devices.  Reflection on the kinds and significance of choices available to an\nartist contributes to a full appreciation of his or her work. For any\nartwork, appreciation begins with recognition of its status as\na work, the product of artistic activity of some kind, and\nthus something to be appreciated as the achievement of an artist or\ngroup of artists. Most commonly, this achievement is understood in\nterms of the aesthetically significant effects achieved by an artist\nwith certain kinds of tools and materials and in light of certain\nappreciative conventions. In other words, the achievement is always\nrelative to an artistic medium. Returning to the case of an artist\nchoosing what to do about the inherent replicability of digital\nimagery, another way of thinking about this choice is in terms of the\nartist recognizing the limits and capacities of her chosen\nmedium. Images conveyed digitally are always replicable and so when an\nartist aims to convey artistic content through digital imagery, she\neither has to accept the inevitable multiplicity of her images or\nresist the tendency of the medium and somehow specify the work’s\nsingularity in presentation. At a more fine-grained level, our\nappreciation of particular effects—of color and composition,\nexpression, narrative structure, and so on—depends on the\neffects themselves but also on background acknowledgment of their\ndegree of difficulty or innovation in the relevant medium. One worry\nwith digital art is that its production relies on the computer\nautomation of many of the tasks, both manual and cognitive,\ntraditionally involved in making art. The effects achieved by computer\nautomation cannot be assessed in the same way as those achieved by\ntraditional “hands-on” artistic methods. The terms of our\nappreciation, therefore, need to be adjusted in the digital age. This\nis certainly compatible with the continued relevance of medium-based\nappreciation, as long as we can make sense of digital media as\nartistic media (Binkley 1998). But there is a strong tendency in film\nand media studies to assume that the medium has absolutely no role to\nplay in the appreciation of digital art.  Summing up this view, it supposedly follows from the fact that\nmodern (digital) computers encode every kind of information in the\nsame way—i.e., as a sequence of binary digits—that an\nartwork that crucially relies in its production on computer processing\nis no longer defined by its mode of presentation, whether in images,\nmoving images, sound patterns, or text. A work’s display is\nrendered merely contingent by the fact that it is generated from a\ncommon code. By adding a particular instruction to the code sequence\nspecifying a work, imagery associated with that work could be\ninstantaneously converted into sounds or text, or just into different\nimagery. This possibility alone supposedly renders meaningless all\ntalk of an artwork being in a particular medium and being properly\nappreciated in terms of that medium (Kittler 1999; Doane\n2007).  Given the considerable effects of digital technology on artistic\nproduction, it is perhaps understandable that some commentators are\ninclined toward a radical overhauling of art theoretical concepts. But\ntheir arguments in support of such an overhaul are, at best,\nincomplete. We see this once we cite some important continuities\nbetween ways of making and thinking about art in the analog age and in\nthe digital age. It has always been the case, for example, that\n“any medium can be translated into any other” (Kittler\n1999: 1): without using a computer, someone could manually devise a\nset of rules (an algorithm) for the translation of image values, say,\ninto sounds or text. Moreover, a common storage and transmission means\nfor (moving) imagery and sound is not unique to digital technology: As\nDoron Galili points out (2011), electronic image transmission going\nback to the late nineteenth century—in other words, precursors\nof the TV—relies on the conversion of both images and sound into\nelectronic pulses.  Apart from these important continuities, the media\ntheorist’s inference from translatability to medium-free art\nsimply does not hold. That we could set about\n“translating” the imagery of Citizen Kane into a\nsymphony does not mean that the original artwork lacks a medium; it is\na movie, after all, and as such, it has to be in the medium of moving\nimages. The symphonic translation of Citizen Kane is not the\nsame work as the 1941 movie by Orson Welles. This reminds us that, in\ndeciding whether there is a digital medium, we must not reduce the\nmedium to the artist’s materials, for it also matters how the\nartist uses those materials. Nor must we limit the constitutive\nmaterials of a medium to physical materials. The case of literature\nshows that neither the materials of an art form, nor their modes of\nmanipulation, need be physical. The medium of literature is neither\npaper and ink nor abstract lexical symbols, but letters and words used\nin certain ways. There are, of course, many different ways of\nphysically storing and transmitting literary works, including by the\nprinted page, in audio recordings, and by memory (human or computer).\nBut from the fact that The Tale of Two Cities can be\npreserved in many different formats, it does not follow that this\nnovel is any less decisively a novel and, as such, in the medium of\nliterature.  Just as with a literary work, the preservation and transmission of\ndigital works in different formats depends on the use of a common\ncode, but a binary numeric code rather than a lexical one. If words\nand their literary uses constitute the medium of literature, then\nbinary code, along with the information it implements, and its\nartistic uses constitute the medium of digital art. This allows for\nthe possibility that the digital medium contains various sub-media, or\n“nested” media (Gaut 2010). For instance, within the\nmedium of digital art, the medium of digital visual art comprises\nartistic uses of computer code specifically to create images. In\ntechnical terms, such uses can be referred to as (artistic)\n“bitmapping”, given that a computer ultimately stores all\nimages (2D and 3D vector) as bitmaps, code sequences that specify the\nintegers assigned to light intensity measurements in a pixel grid. The\nmedium of bitmapping is thus distinguished by a kind of digital\ntechnology, but the kind used to produce just those items belonging to\nthe traditional medium of images.  Once the notion of digital media is revealed to be no more\nconfused or mysterious than the familiar notion of literary media, its\nirreducible role in appreciation becomes apparent. To take just one\nexample, proper appreciation of movies in the digital age depends on\nrecognizing that digital movie-making tools do not just make\ntraditional movie-making easier; they also present new creative\npossibilities and challenges. Given the maturity and mass-art status\nof the cinematic art form, it is easy to take for granted the medium\nof moving imagery; we may think we know precisely its limits, and we\nmay even think we have seen everything that can be done with it. The\ndigital medium is different, however, and digital cinema is in both\nthe medium of moving imagery and the digital medium.  At first glance, it might seem odd to speak of\n“challenges” or “limits” in relation to\ndigital processes, which allow for instantaneous and endless\nmodification with increasingly user-friendly applications and\ndevices. The high degree of automation in the process of capturing an\nimage with a digital video camera, along with increasingly high image\nresolution and memory capacity, could make it seem as though digital\nimages are too easily achieved to be interesting. Then there are the\npractically endless possibilities for “correcting” the\ncaptured image with applications like Photoshop. Digital sound\nrecording is likewise increasingly automated, increasingly\nfine-grained, and reliant on ever-larger computer memory\ncapacities. Modifying and mastering recorded sound with digital\nediting software allows for an unlimited testing of options. In\ndigital movie editing, sequence changes are instantaneous and entirely\nreversible—quite unlike when the editing process involved the\nphysical cutting and splicing of a film (image or sound)\nstrip. Digital tools thus allow moviemakers to focus (almost) purely\non the making of choices about the look and sound of the movie without\nhaving to worry about the technical difficulty or finality of\nimplementation.  Rather than dismissing all digital works as too easily achieved to\nbe interesting, medium-based appreciation requires that we consider\nthe digital on its own terms and allow for the possibility that\ncertain kinds of increased technical efficiency can bring new creative\nrisks. For example, even though committing to certain editorial\ndecisions does not entail irreversible alterations to a filmstrip,\narriving at those decisions involves sifting through and eliminating\nfar more options, a process which can easily become overwhelming and\ntherefore more error-ridden.  When we properly appreciate a digital\nmovie, therefore, part of what we need to appreciate is the\nsignificance of any scene or sequence looking just the way it does\nwhen it could have, so easily, looked so many other ways. Similarly,\nwhen we properly appreciate an interactive digital installation or\nvideogame, we are, in part, appreciating certain representations,\nfunctions, and capabilities of the input-output system that are made\npossible by digital media. This is undeniably a form of medium-based\nappreciation, but the medium to which we appeal is the digital medium\nrather than traditional media. If the digital medium is computer code\nused in certain ways—for example, to make moving images, then it\nis only when we think of a digital movie as in this medium that we can\nappreciate it as a particular response to the creative problem,\nintroduced by coding, of finalizing selections from a vast array of\nequally and instantly available options.  The case of digital cinema is perhaps a useful starting point for\nwork in the philosophy of digital art. Digital cinema is a multi-media\nart form, after all, involving 2D and 3D moving images as well as\nsound, and with the potential for robust interactivity, whereby\naudiences select story events or otherwise modify a movie’s\nscreening in prescribed ways (Gaut 2010: 224–43). Many of the\ndigital tools developed by the movie and video game industries are now\navailable more widely to artists interested in making other forms of\ndigital art, including net art, digital sound installations, and\nvirtual reality art (Grau 2003; Chalmers 2017; Tavinor 2019). In terms\nof how the use of these tools affects proper appreciation, there are\nimportant continuities between the movie-making context and the wider\ndigital art world. In addition, the philosophy of film is a\nwell-established subfield in aesthetics, one that engages with both\nfilm theory and cognitive science in order to explicate the nature of\nfilm as a mass art (Thomson-Jones 2014, Other Internet Resources). For\nmany of the standard topics in the philosophy of film, interesting and\nimportant questions arise when we extend the discussion from analog to\ndigital cinema.  There is a question, for example, about the kinds and\nsignificance of realism that can be achieved with traditional\ncelluloid film as compared with manipulated digital imagery (Gaut\n2010: 60–97). The philosophy of film can provide some of the\ninitial terms of analysis for artworks in a broad range of digital\nmedia. At the same time, it is important to approach the digital arts\non their own terms under the assumption that the digital is an\nartistically significant category. \nMore and more, contemporary artists are taking advantage of the\ndynamic and responsive capabilities of digital media to make their art\ninteractive. The experimental online literature, conceptual browser\nart, and videogames mentioned above require user interactivity, but\nall to varying degrees. Therefore, if interactivity plays a\ndistinctive role in the digital arts, there are good reasons to\nanalyse the nature of these works more deeply. \nNot all digital works are interactive, and not all interactive works\nare digital. However, since computers are inherently interactive, much\nof the early philosophical literature on interactivity arose from the\nemergence of computer art (also see Smuts 2009; Lopes 2001; Saltz\n1997). The distinctive character of interactive digital art is best\nconsidered in tandem with the work’s ontology. \nAll interactive artworks, digital and non-digital, have dual\nontological structures that consist of properties belonging to the\nwork and properties that belong to the work’s instances. So far,\nthis is not so different than performance works like music and dance,\nor even digital photographs that can be multiply instantiated. Where\ndigitally interactive works are concerned, certain properties of the\nwork are borne by the work’s algorithm, whereas properties of\nthe instances are brought about by the user’s interaction. \nGiven that appreciation of certain artworks is embedded in a\nuser’s interactivity, philosophers are then tasked with defining\ninteractive art in a manner that eliminates unsanctioned actions from\nconstituting a kind of interactive work. One could imagine, for\nexample, someone hacking into a digital file to manipulate a digital\nimage, thus generating new instance-properties of the work. That, and\nmore benign actions such as reading chapters of, let us say, a\ndigitized copy of The Brothers Karamazov in random order may\nchange the properties of the work, but such activities are not\nprescribed. This, once again, underscores the importance of the\nartist’s sanction. Bearing this in mind and relating it to\ncomputer art, Dominic Lopes offers the following definition, “A\nwork of art is interactive just in case it prescribes\nthat the actions of its users help generate its\ndisplay” (Lopes 2010:36, original emphasis). Similarly, Berys\nGaut’s definition states that “a work is interactive just\nin case it authorizes that its audience’s actions partly\ndetermine its instances and their features” (Gaut 2010: 143,\noriginal emphasis). In specifying certain actions as prescribed and\nauthorized, these often-cited definitions restrict the kinds of works\nthat ought or ought not be considered candidates for an interactive\nart category. \nThe capability of a work to generate instance-properties from the\nuser’s actions is recognized within philosophical aesthetics as\na distinctive feature of interactive artworks. However, given the\nontological similarities between performance works and interactive\nones, it follows that one may question the specific roles of\n‘user’ and ‘audience’ in the definitions presented\nabove. Lopes clarifies that, \nA person plays the role of a user in generating a display of a work\nonly if he or she (1) generates the display, (2) exploring the work,\nso that (3) an audience attends to the work partly by attending to his\nor her doing (1) and (2) (Lopes 2010: 82). \nUsers explore a work by generating the display via a computational\nprocess. For Lopes, the user and audience can be the same, but they\nneed not be. For philosophers of art, the above conception falls just\nshy of fully excluding performance works from a category of\ninteractive art (Gaut 2010; Kania 2018). Afterall, it can be argued\nthat a musician similarly engages in (1), (2), and (3) when she\nperforms a specific work. If this is the case, the terms\n‘user’ and ‘audience’ are not always\nsynonymous, unless it is stipulated that for interactive works the\nidentity of users and audiences are identical. This is atypical of\nnon-interactive performance works where a performer plays for\nan audience, beyond him or herself. This distinctive user-audience\nrelationship also suggests that adequate appreciation of a work is not\ngranted by merely observing a user interact with it (Kania 2018:\n188). \nThe aforementioned words ‘instance’ and\n‘display’ (used interchangeably here) can be applied to\nboth interactive and non-interactive works characterized by a two-level\nontology. Nevertheless, there are significant metaphysical\ndifferences between works like an interactive digital installation or\nvideogame and others like a digital photograph. One of the more\nsignificant distinctions has to do with the structure of the displays;\ndisplays of interactive works are variable in ways the displays of\nnon-interactive works are not (Lopes 2010). More precisely stated, the\ndisplays of interactive works are considered variable if they have a\nsuccession of states or they are repeatable (Lopes 2010: 37–38). To\ncharacterize the first kind of variability, consider the following\ndescription of the digital installation “Universe of Water\nParticles on a Rock where People Gather” (henceforth, where\nPeople Gather) by TeamLab: \nThe Rock where People Gather is reproduced in a virtual\nthree-dimensional space. Water is simulated to fall onto the rock, and\nthe flow of the water draws the shape of the waterfall. The water is\nrepresented by a continuum of numerous water particles and the\ninteraction between the particles is then calculated. Lines are drawn\nin relation to the behavior of the water particles. The lines are then\n“flattened” using what TeamLab considers to be\nultrasubjective space. \nWhen a person stands on the rock or touches the waterfall, they too\nbecome like a rock that changes the flow of water. The flow of water\ncontinues to transform in real time due to the interaction of\npeople. Previous visual states can never be replicated, and will never\nreoccur (TeamLab 2018). \nUsers interact with the work to generate variations in the succession\nof displays, but none of the previous states are repeatable. Compare\nthis with the second kind of display variability. Digital works that\nare networked, such as most net art and videogames, are repeatable\nbecause they can be multiply accessed and instantiated by different\nusers, in different places, and all at once; variations are generated\nwhen the work is repeated. Although repeatable digital works are\npossible due to digital media’s unique transmissible nature,\nmore needs to be said about how this trait distinguishes interactive\ndigital works from non-interactive digital images. \nIf the displays of digital photographs vary from instance to instance\ndue to different settings on different devices (e.g., brightness,\nresolution, intensity), then the aesthetic and structural differences\nof all works with multiple displays need to be considered in greater\ndetail. Consider, for example, that with many videogames, players can\nchoose which route to take, quests to accept, characters to\nkill or save, personalities to adopt, and the like. These sorts of\nin-game player choices are not merely features that generate varying\nresolutions and the like: the interactivity shapes the stories that\nunfold, which can be reshaped during another playing of the same game\nfor very different outcomes. In these cases, strong variability occurs\nbecause the works consist of differing multiple displays\n(Preston 2014). For clarification, Dominic Preston says, \nfor any given artwork, each possible set of structural and aesthetic\nproperties F is a display type of that artwork.  (Preston 2014:\n271, original emphasis). \nFrom the above, we can briefly infer the following scenarios: digital\nphotographs are ontologically similar to plays and music because they\nconsist of one display type, but multiple displays given subtle\nvariances between the particular tokens. Works that instance a\nsuccession of states such as “where People Gather” consist\nof multiple potential display types but where only one display is\ninstantiated at any given time. Now, compare such works with those\nlike videogames and comparable interactive digital examples that\npresent us with strong degrees of display variability to such an\nextent that we might re-classify the work’s genre depending upon the\noutcomes. For example, one playthrough might end in a tragedy but,\ngiven a player’s different choices, end in a non-tragedy at\nanother time, to list just one example. Under a Prestonian view of\ndisplay types, these sorts of works consist of both multiple display\ntypes and multiple displays, which means users will generate one of the\npossible display types each time they repeat the work. While this\nconcept is mostly applicable to videogames, one could imagine\ninteractive digital installations or net art with similar degrees of\nvariability.  It is important to reiterate that the strong interactivity just\ndescribed is not distinctively digital. Whilst interactivity is a\nstandard feature of many contemporary digital works, and the\nresponsiveness of such works is remarkable, non-digital appreciative\ncategories can also exploit a similar degree of display\nvariability. For example, literature, theater, and tabletop role\nplaying games can be strongly interactive similarly to many digital\nartworks. What is unique about all such works are the ways in which\nthings like immersion, agency, identity, and fictions, to list a few,\nare impacted by the interactivity, due to the user’s role in the\nwork (for more, see Robinson & Tavinor 2018; Patridge 2017; Meskin\n& Robson 2016). \nAlthough they have only begun to scratch the surface, philosophers of\nart have done a good deal to stress the significance of both digital\nmedia and interactivity in the arts, as well as their ongoing\ninfluence in changing philosophical conceptions of art and artistic\npractices. However, further investigation is needed on topics such as\nforms of realism distinctive of digital image-based art, digital\nconceptual art, art categories and media distinctions in relation to\ndigital art, and the impact of digital technology on practices of\nmaking, displaying, and appreciating art. Given that digital media\nconnect physical locations to virtual ones, it is also worth exploring\nthe ways in which the connectivity and mobility of digital art\nchallenge our traditional notions of site-specificity and\nlocation-specific art. On a related note are the social (and perhaps\npolitical) implications of digital art, which are also of growing\ninterest.","contact.mail":"shelby.moser@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
