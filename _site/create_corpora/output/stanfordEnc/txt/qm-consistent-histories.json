However, the concept\nof measurement by which probabilities are introduced in\nstandard quantum theory no longer plays a fundamental\nrole. Instead, all quantum time dependence is probabilistic\n(stochastic), with probabilities given by the Born rule or its\nextensions. By requiring that the description of a quantum system be\ncarried out using a well-defined probabilistic sample space (called a\n“framework”) this approach resolves all the well-known\nquantum paradoxes of quantum foundations. In particular, quantum\nmechanics is local and consistent with special relativity. Classical\nmechanics emerges as a useful approximation to the more fundamental\nquantum mechanics under suitable conditions. The price to be paid for\nthis is a set of rules for reasoning resembling, but also\nsignificantly different from, those which comprise quantum logic. An\nimportant philosophical implication is the lack of a single\nuniversally-true state of affairs at each instant of time. However,\nthere is a correspondence limit in which the new quantum logic becomes\nstandard logic in the macroscopic world of everyday experience.\n\nIn the article that follows the term ‘consistent\nhistories’ will generally be abbreviated to\n‘histories’, since the ‘decoherent’ and\n‘consistent’ interpretations are very similar; when in\ndoubt insert ‘consistent’ before\n‘histories’. The reader is assumed familiar with, and\nprobably a bit confused by and frustrated with, the fundamentals of\nquantum mechanics found in introductory textbooks.\n\nThe consistent histories interpretation of quantum mechanics was\nintroduced by Griffiths (1984), and\ndiscussed by Omnès in a series of papers beginning\nwith (Omnès 1988). The decoherent\nhistories approach that first appeared\nin Gell-Mann & Hartle (1990)\ncontains similar ideas. The single term “histories” will\nbe employed below, with the understanding that at points where the\n“consistent” and “decoherent” approaches might\nbe slightly different, the former is intended. The histories approach extends the calculational methods found in\nstandard textbooks and gives them a microscopic physical\ninterpretation which the textbooks lack. It is not intended as an\nalternative, but as a fully consistent and clear statement of basic\nquantum mechanics, “Copenhagen done right”. In particular,\nmeasurements are treated in the same way as all other physical\nprocesses and play no special role in the interpretation. Thus there\nis no measurement problem, and under appropriate conditions one can\ndiscuss the microscopic properties revealed by measurements. All the standard quantum paradoxes (double slit, Schrödinger cat,\nHardy, three box, etc.) are resolved using the histories approach, or\none might better say “tamed”: they are no longer unsolved\ndifficulties casting doubt upon the reliability and completeness of\nthe quantum formalism, but instead they illustrate striking\ndifferences between quantum and classical physics. In particular,\nthere is no conflict between quantum theory and relativity:\nsuperluminal influences cannot carry information or anything else for\nthe simple reason that they do not exist. In appropriate regimes\n(large systems, strong decoherence) the laws of classical physics\nprovide a very good approximation, valid for all practical purposes,\nto the more fundamental and more exact laws of quantum mechanics. But at what price? The histories approach introduces a variety of\nconcepts that go beyond textbook quantum theory, and these can be\nsummarized under two headings. First, quantum dynamics is treated as\nstochastic or probabilistic. Not just when measurements are carried\nout, but always. Born’s rule, together with its extensions,\nis a fundamental axiom of quantum theory. The task of Schrödinger’s\ntime-dependent equation is to assist in assigning\nprobabilities. Second, following Sec. III.5\nof J. von Neumann (1932), quantum\nproperties, which are what the probabilities refer to, are associated\nwith subspaces of the quantum Hilbert space. But then new logical\nprinciples are required to consistently deal with the difference\nbetween the quantum Hilbert space and a classical phase space. These\nprinciples are related to, but not identical with, those of the\nquantum logic initiated by Birkhoff &\nNeumann (1936). Since textbook quantum mechanics already contains certain rules for\ncalculating probabilities, the first innovation of the histories\napproach, stochastic dynamics, is not very startling and by itself\ncauses few conceptual difficulties. It is the second innovation, in\nthe domain of logic and ontology, that represents the most radical\ndeparture from classical thinking. However, the new quantum logic\nreduces to the old familiar classical propositional logic in the same\ndomain where classical mechanics is a good approximation to quantum\nmechanics. That is to say, the old logic is perfectly good for all\npractical purposes in the same domain where classical mechanics is\nperfectly good for all practical purposes, and a consistent, fully\nquantum analysis explains why this is so. A classical mechanical system can be described using a phase\nspace \\(\\Gamma\\) with points denoted by \\(\\gamma\\). A\nclassical property \\(P\\) is a collection of points \\(\\PC\\) from\nthe phase space, and can be conveniently described by an indicator\nfunction \\(P(\\gamma)\\) which is equal to 1 if \\(\\gamma \\in \\PC\\) and\n0 otherwise. It will cause no confusion to use \\(P\\) for both the\nproperty and its indicator function. The negation \\(\\lnot P\\)\nof a property \\(P\\) corresponds to the complement \\(\\PC^c\\) of the set\n\\(\\PC\\), consisting of points in \\(\\Gamma\\) that are not in \\(\\PC\\). Its\nindicator is \\(I-P\\), where the identity indicator \\(I(\\gamma)\n=1\\) for all \\(\\gamma\\). For example, the phase space of a\none-dimensional harmonic oscillator is the real plane with a point\n\\(\\gamma = (x,p)\\) indicating that the particle is at \\(x\\) and has\nmomentum \\(p\\). The property that its energy is less than some fixed value \\(E_r\\) corresponds to the set of\npoints contained in the ellipse \\(E=E_r\\) centered at the origin of the\n\\(x,p\\) plane, and the indicator is the function that is 1 on the points\ninside (and on the boundary) of the ellipse and 0 outside. Its\nnegation, the property that the energy is greater than \\(E_r\\),\ncorresponds to all the points lying outside this ellipse. The quantum counterpart of a phase space is a Hilbert space \\(\\HC\\):\na complex vector space with an inner product. If infinite dimensional\nit must be complete—Cauchy sequences have limits. But for our\npurposes finite-dimensional spaces will suffice for discussing the\nmajor conceptual difficulties of quantum theory and how the histories\napproach resolves them. (Some examples use a harmonic oscillator with\nan infinite dimensional Hilbert space simply because it is relatively\nsimple and familiar.) We use Dirac notation in which an element of\n\\(\\HC\\), a “ket”, is denoted by \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\), where \\(\\psi\\)\nis a label, and \\(\\inpd{\\phi}{\\psi}\\) denotes the inner product of\n\\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) with \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\). The simplest quantum physical\nproperty, the counterpart of a point \\(\\gamma\\) in the classical phase\nspace, is a one-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space,\nor ray, consisting of all multiples \\(c\\ket{\\psi}\\) of some\nnonzero \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\), with \\(c\\) an arbitrary complex number. The ray\nuniquely determines and is uniquely determined by the\ncorresponding projector \\[P = [\\psi] = \\dya{\\psi}, \\label{eqn2}\\] assuming \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) is normalized, \\(\\inp{\\psi}=1\\). In Dirac\nnotation \\(\\dyad{a}{b}\\) is an operator which when applied to an\narbitrary ket \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) yields the ket\n\\(\\ket{a}\\inpd{b}{\\phi}=(\\inpd{b}{\\phi}) \\ket{a}\\). The square bracket\nin \\eqref{eqn2} is not standard Dirac notation, but is very convenient\nand will be used later. In addition to rays, a Hilbert space of dimension \\(d\\) also contains\nsubspaces of dimension 2, 3, etc., up to \\(d\\) (the entire space). These\nlarger subspaces also represent quantum properties and are the\nanalogues of sets of more than one point in a classical phase\nspace. Each subspace \\(\\PC\\) corresponds to a unique projector \\(P\\), a\nHermitian operator \\(P=P^\\dagger =P^2\\) such that\n\\(P\\ket{\\phi}=\\ket{\\phi}\\) if and only if \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) belongs to\n\\(\\PC\\). A quantum projector behaves in many ways like a classical\nindicator function, e.g., its eigenvalues can only be 0 or 1. Using\nthe same symbol \\(P\\) for the property and the projector should cause no\nconfusion. Following Sec. III.5 of J. von\nNeumann (1932), we identify the negation \\(\\lnot P\\) of\na quantum property \\(P\\), subspace \\(\\PC\\), with the orthogonal\ncomplement \\(\\PC^\\perp\\) consisting of the kets in \\(\\HC\\) which are\northogonal to all the kets in \\(\\PC\\). The projector on \\(\\PC^\\perp\\) is\n\\(I-P\\), again analogous to the classical case. Consider the example of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic\noscillator. As is well known, its energy \\(E\\) can take on only discrete\nvalues \\((n+1/2)\\hbar\\omega\\), where \\(n=0, 1,\\ldots\\) is any nonnegative\ninteger and \\(\\omega\\) is its angular frequency, as in \\eqref{eqn1}. We\ndenote the corresponding normalized ket by \\(\\ket{n}\\). The projector\n\\([n]=\\dya{n}\\) then represents the property that the energy is equal to\n\\((n+1/2)\\hbar\\omega\\). The property that the energy is less than or\nequal to \\((N+1/2)\\hbar\\omega\\) for some integer \\(N\\) is given by the\nprojector \\[P = \\sum_{n=0}^N [n] = \\sum_{n=0}^N\\dya{n}, \\label{eqn3}\\] while the corresponding sum from \\(n=N+1\\) to \\(\\infty\\) represents its\nnegation, \\(I-P\\), the property that \\(E\\) is greater than\n\\((N+1/2)\\hbar\\omega\\). Despite the close analogy between classical and quantum properties\nthere is actually a profound difference. For a particular classical\nproperty \\(P\\), every point \\(\\gamma\\) in the phase space lies either\ninside the set \\(\\PC\\), so that the property is true for this \\(\\gamma\\),\nor else it lies in the complementary set \\(\\PC^c\\), and the property \\(P\\)\nis false. However, given a nontrivial (neither 0 nor the entire space)\nsubspace \\(\\PC\\) of the quantum Hilbert space \\(\\HC\\), there are always\nkets \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) with corresponding rays \\(\\{c\\ket{\\phi}\\}\\) which lie\nneither in \\(\\PC\\) nor in \\(\\PC^\\perp\\). For example, \\(\\ket{\\phi} =\n\\ket{N} + \\ket{N+1}\\) for \\(P\\) given by \\eqref{eqn3}. How is one to\nthink about these? That is a key question in quantum foundations. The conjunction \\(P\\land Q\\), or \\(P\\) AND \\(Q\\), of two classical\nproperties corresponds to the intersection \\(\\PC\\cap\\QC\\) of the sets\nthat represent them on the phase space, and the indicator for this set\nis the product \\(P(\\gamma)Q(\\gamma)\\) of the two indicator\nfunctions. What about the quantum case? In quantum logic \\(P\\land Q\\) is\nidentified with the intersection \\(\\PC\\cap\\QC\\) of the two Hilbert\nsubspaces, which is itself a subspace and thus a quantum property. The\nhistories interpretation identifies \\(P\\land Q\\) with the product \\(PQ\\)\nof the projectors \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) provided the two\nprojectors commute, that is, provided \\(PQ=QP\\). When and only\nwhen this condition is fulfilled is the product \\(PQ\\) itself a\nprojector, and it projects onto the subspace \\(\\PC\\cap\\QC\\), in\nagreement with quantum logic. However, if \\(PQ\\neq QP\\) the conjunction\n\\(P\\land Q\\) is undefined or meaningless in the sense\nthat the histories interpretation assigns it no meaning. In the same\nway the disjunction \\(P\\lor Q\\), the nonexclusive \\(P\\) OR \\(Q\\), is\nrepresented by the projector \\(P+Q-PQ\\) when \\(PQ=QP\\), but is otherwise\nundefined. The refusal to define the conjunction or disjunction when \\(PQ\\neq\nQP\\) should be thought of as a syntactical rule, analogous to that in\nordinary logic that says an expression like \\(P\\land\\lor\\, Q\\) is\nmeaningless because it has not been formed according to the rules used\nto construct meaningful sentences. In this connection it is important\nto distinguish “meaningless” from “false”. A\nproposition which is false is meaningful and its negation is true,\nwhereas the negation of a meaningless statement is equally\nmeaningless. Once the commutativity restriction for meaningful\ncombinations of quantum propositions or properties is in place the\nusual logical rules apply together with the intuition that goes along\nwith them. This will be further codified using the single framework\nrule defined in subsection 3.4\nbelow. Let us apply these ideas to a specific example, that of the spin\ndegree of freedom of a spin-half particle, such as an electron or a\nproton, or a silver atom in its electronic ground state. The operator\n\\(S_z\\) for the \\(z\\) component of spin angular momentum acts on a\n2-dimensional Hilbert space and has eigenvalues \\(+1/2\\) and \\(-1/2\\) in\nunits of \\(\\hbar\\). If \\(\\ket{z^+}\\) and \\(\\ket{z^-}\\) are the corresponding\neigenkets, the projectors corresponding to \\(S_z=\\pm 1/2\\) are \\([z^+]\n=\\dya{z^+}\\) and \\([z^-] =\\dya{z^-}\\). The product of these projectors in\neither order is the zero operator \\(0\\), which is the property that is\nalways false, the quantum counterpart of the empty subset of a\nclassical phase space. Their sum \\([z^+] + [z^-] =I\\) is the identity\noperator, the property that is always true. In physical terms, \\(S_z\\)\nis either positive or negative: it cannot be both (\\([z^+]\\cdot [z^-]\n=0\\)), and it must be one or the other (\\([z^+] + [z^-] =I\\)). This\nexplains the outcome of the Stern-Gerlach experiment. In the same way the \\(x\\) component \\(S_x\\) of angular momentum can\ntake only two values \\(+1/2\\) or \\(-1/2\\), corresponding to the projectors\n\\([x^+] = \\dya{x^+}\\) and \\([x^-] = \\dya{x^-}\\) formed from its eigenkets\n\\(\\ket{x^+}\\) and \\(\\ket{x^-}\\). Consequently, what was stated in the\nprevious paragraph about \\(S_z\\) can also be said about\n\\(S_x\\). However—here we arrive at a central feature of the\nhistories interpretation—it is not meaningful\nto combine discussions of \\(S_z\\) with discussions of \\(S_x\\),\nbecause neither \\([x^+]\\) nor \\([x^-]\\) commutes with \\([z^+]\\) or\n\\([z^-]\\). There is no way of associating the property “\\(S_z=+1/2\\)\nAND \\(S_x=+1/2\\)” with a subspace of the two-dimensional quantum\nHilbert space. One way to see this is that every one-dimensional\nsubspace of this Hilbert space has a physical interpretation:\n\\(S_w=+1/2\\) for some direction \\(w\\) in space, so there are no\npossibilities left over which could correspond to “\\(S_z=+1/2\\)\nAND \\(S_x=+1/2\\)”. But might one assign the zero-dimensional\nsubspace, the proposition that is always false, to “\\(S_z=+1/2\\)\nAND \\(S_x=+1/2\\)”? This is the approach of quantum logic. However,\ntaking the negation of this proposition that is always false has the\nconsequence that the proposition “\\(S_z=-1/2\\) OR\n\\(S_x=-1/2\\)” is always true, which to a physicist seems\nextremely odd. See the\n Further Reading supplement\nfor more details. For a more detailed discussion of the logic associated with the\nhistories approach, see (Griffiths\n2014). Probabilities in the histories interpretation of quantum mechanics\nare standard Kolmogorov probabilities, not some new\ninvention that, for example, allows negative probabilities. But these\nstandard probabilities must be associated with a well-defined sample\nspace. While this is also true in classical applications of\nprobability theory, in quantum mechanics the penalty for carelessness\ncan be severe: confusion and unresolved paradoxes. The following\ndiscussion indicates what steps need to be taken to construct\nconsistent probabilities and stay out of trouble. For more details see\nCh. 5 of Griffiths (2002a). A probabilistic model as used in classical physics and\nother sciences can be thought of as a triple \\((\\SC,\\EC,\\MC)\\),\na sample space \\(\\SC\\), an event algebra \\(\\EC\\) and\na probability measure \\(\\MC\\). When a die is rolled the sample\nspace \\(\\SC\\) consists of six mutually exclusive possibilities, one and\nonly one of which actually occurs. The event algebra can be set equal\nto the collection of all \\(2^6\\) subsets of \\(\\SC\\), including the empty\nset and \\(\\SC\\) itself; it forms a Boolean algebra under complements and\nintersections. Finally, \\(\\MC\\) assigns probabilities, real numbers\nbetween 0 and 1, to the different sets in \\(\\EC\\) according to certain\nrules. Again we need only consider the simplest situation in which\n\\(\\SC\\) is finite or countable, and a nonnegative number \\(p_j\\) is\nassigned to each \\(j\\in\\SC\\) in such a manner that \\(\\sum_j p_j = 1\\). The\nprobability for some \\(E\\in \\EC\\) is then given by the formula \\[\\Pr(E) = \\sum_{j\\in E} p_j.  \\label{eqn4}\\] Note that the mathematical rules of probability theory do not\nconstrain the choice of the \\(p_j\\), aside from the requirement that\nthey be nonnegative and sum to 1. It is up to the scientist\nconstructing the model to come up with appropriate values, which may\nbe done using a variety of considerations; among them pure guesswork,\nas well as carefully fitting parameters using results of previous\nexperiments. The histories interpretation of quantum mechanics employs\nprobability theory in exactly the same way as in the other\nsciences once a sample space \\(\\SC\\) has been specified. A\nquantum sample space \\(\\SC\\) is always a projective decomposition of\nthe identity operator \\(I\\), hereafter referred to as a\n“projective decomposition” (or\n“decomposition”), on the quantum Hilbert space \\(\\HC\\) used\nto model the situation of interest. That is to say, a collection\n\\(\\{P_j\\}\\) of projectors (\\(P^{}_j = P_j^\\dagger =P_j^2)\\) which are\nmutually orthogonal (\\(P_jP_k = 0\\) for \\(j\\neq k\\)) and sum to the\nidentity \\[I = \\sum_j P_j.  \\label{eqn5}\\] These projectors represent mutually exclusive properties\n(implied by orthogonality), one of which is true (implied by the sum\nequal to \\(I\\)) in any given experiment or situation to which the model\nis being applied. The event algebra \\(\\EC\\) consists of all projectors formed by taking\nsums of some of the \\(P_j\\) in the collection; i.e., \\(\\sum_j\\pi_j P_j\\),\nwhere each \\(\\pi_j\\) is either 0 or 1. This includes the identity\noperator \\(I\\) and the zero operator 0 along with such things as \\(P_2\\)\nor \\(P_1+P_3\\). The event algebra is a Boolean algebra in the sense that\nthe complement \\(I-P\\) of any projector and the product \\(PQ\\) of any two\nprojectors belonging to \\(\\EC\\) is an element of \\(\\EC\\). The\nterm framework can refer to either the sample space or the\nevent algebra constructed from it in this way, since there is a\none-to-one correspondence between the two. Quantum theory does not in\ngeneral specify the probability \\(p_j\\) to be assigned to the projector\n\\(P_j\\) in \\(\\SC\\), apart from the requirement that it be nonnegative, and\nthat the \\(p_j\\) sum to 1 (but see subsection 4.2\nconcerning time dependence). Thus, for example, to the element\n\\(P_1+P_3\\) of \\(\\EC\\) one assigns the probability\n\\(p_1+p_3\\). The intuitive interpretation of probabilities\nintroduced in this way is the same as in the other sciences which\nemploy probability theory as long as a single framework is in\nview. What is distinctly different in the quantum case is the\nexistence of multiple incompatible frameworks; given these consistency\nrequires that one adopt the single framework\nrule, subsection 3.4. Quantum observables, represented by Hermitian operators, are the\ncounterpart of real-valued functions on a classical phase space. The\nspectral decomposition \\[A = \\sum a_j P_j \\label{eqn6}\\] of an observable \\(A\\), where each eigenvalue \\(a_j\\) of \\(A\\) occurs but\nonce in the sum, \\(j\\neq k\\) implies \\(a_j\\neq a_k\\), associates with \\(A\\)\na unique decomposition of the identity of the form \\eqref{eqn5}. Thus\n\\(A\\) takes on or has the value \\(a_j\\) if and only if \\(P_j\\) is true, and\nthe probability that \\(A\\) has the value \\(a_j\\) is given by the\nprobability \\(p_j\\) assigned to \\(P_j\\). Hence measuring \\(A\\) is\nequivalent to measuring the corresponding decomposition in the sense\nof determining which of the mutually-exclusive properties \\(P_j\\) is\ntrue. (The subject of quantum measurements is taken up below\nin section 7.) The property that the value of\n\\(A\\) lies between \\(a\\) and \\(a'\\) corresponds to the sum of the projectors\n\\(P_j\\) for which the corresponding \\(a_j\\) falls in this interval, which\nis a projector belong to the corresponding event algebra, and its\nprobability is the sum of the corresponding \\(p_j\\) values. A refinement of a sample space is obtained by replacing\none or more of its projectors with other projectors which add up to\nit; conversely a coarsening or coarse graining is obtain by\nadding together two or more projectors in the projective decomposition\nand using the sum as one of the elements in a new decomposition. Given\nthe connection between sample spaces and event algebras as defined\nabove, one sees that the event algebra of a refined sample space is\nlarger than the original event algebra: i.e., it contains all the\noriginal projectors and others in addition; conversely, a coarsening\nleads to a new event algebra which is a subset of the old event\nalgebra. Two quantum sample spaces (projective decompositions) \\(\\{P_j\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{Q_k\\}\\) associated with the same Hilbert space are said to\nbe compatible provided all the projectors in one\ndecomposition commute with all the projectors in the other\ndecomposition: \\(P_jQ_k = Q_k P_j\\) for all \\(j\\) and \\(k\\). Otherwise they\nare incompatible. Note that all projectors in the two event\nalgebras commute if and only if this is true for the sample spaces, so\nit makes sense to talk about compatible and incompatible\nframeworks. When the frameworks are compatible one can combine\nthem. In particular, the coarsest common refinement is given\nby the sample space or decomposition formed by all nonzero products of\nthe form \\(P_jQ_k\\), and the corresponding event algebra contains all\nthe projectors in the original algebras along with the additional ones\nconstructed from their products. The single framework rule says that a specific quantum\nprobabilistic model employs just one sample space and its associated\nevent algebra, and in particular two incompatible\nframeworks cannot be combined. This rule, together with its\nextension to quantum dynamics, see subsection 4.2,\nis a central principle of histories quantum mechanics. It provides a\nguide for quantum reasoning that prevents one from falling into\nparadoxes; conversely, most quantum paradoxes are constructed by\nviolating the single framework rule in some way. As an illustration, consider the one-dimensional harmonic\noscillator of subsection 2.1 and a sample\nspace \\[\\SC_a = \\{P,I-P\\};\\quad P = [0] + [1], \\label{eqn7}\\] containing two projectors, where \\(P\\) corresponds to the case \\(N=1\\)\nin \\eqref{eqn3}. The physical interpretation of \\(P\\) is that the energy\nof the oscillator is no greater than \\((3/2)\\hbar\\omega\\), whereas \\(I-P\\)\nmeans the energy is at least \\((5/2)\\hbar\\omega\\). If \\(P\\) is true it\nmight seem reasonable to conclude that either \\(n=0\\) and the energy is\n\\((1/2)\\hbar\\omega\\), or else \\(n=1\\) and the energy is\n\\((3/2)\\hbar\\omega\\). After all, the energy can only take values\n\\((n+1/2)\\hbar\\omega\\), so does it not follow from the truth of \\(P\\) that\n\\(n=0\\) or \\(n=1\\)? No it does not, and understanding why it does\nnot will expose an important principle of quantum reasoning. The point\nis that probabilistic reasoning, in quantum mechanics or in other\ndisciplines, does not allow one to make inferences about matters which\nare outside the scope of discussion, i.e., which are not contained in\nthe event algebra. The event algebra \\(\\EC_a\\) corresponding to the\nsample space \\(\\SC_a\\) in \\eqref{eqn7} contains \\(P\\) and \\(I-P\\), but does\nnot contain either \\([0]\\) or \\([1]\\), the projectors that correspond to\nthe two lowest energy eigenstates. Consequently, this framework\ndoes not allow for the statement of a result which might seem\nintuitively obvious. A solution is readily at hand. In place of \\(\\SC_a\\) use a\nrefinement \\[\\SC_b = \\{[0],[1],I-P\\};\\quad P = [0] + [1].  \\label{eqn8}\\] Now because \\([0]\\) and \\([1]\\) belong to the event algebra \\(\\EC_b\\)\nthey can be discussed, and the truth of \\(P\\) indeed implies that either\n\\([0]\\) or \\([1]\\) is true: if the energy is not greater than\n\\((3/2)\\hbar\\omega\\) then it is either \\(1/2\\) or \\(3/2\\) \\(\\hbar\\omega\\). But\nis not this insistence that \\(\\SC_b\\) be used in place of \\(\\SC_a\\) a\npiece of sophistry irrelevant to the needs of the working scientist?\nNo, not if the scientist’s work involves quantum mechanics. To see\nwhy, consider an alternative refinement \\[\\SC_c = \\{[+],[-],I-P\\};\\quad P = [+] + [-] = [0]+[1]\n\\label{eqn9}\\] of \\(\\SC_a\\), where \\[\\ket{+} = (\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})/\\sqrt{2},\\quad \\ket{-} = (\\ket{0} -\n\\ket{1})/\\sqrt{2}.  \\label{eqn10}\\] Since the event algebra \\(\\EC_c\\) contains \\(P\\) along with \\([+]\\) and\n\\([-]\\), in this framework the truth of \\(P\\) implies that the oscillator\nis either in the state \\([+]\\) or the state \\([-]\\). But neither of these\nare energy eigenstates, and these projectors do not commute with \\([0]\\)\nand \\([1]\\); the relationship is formally the same as that between\neigenstates of \\(S_x\\) and those of \\(S_z\\) for a spin-half\nparticle, subsection 2.3. Consequently, if\nresults using frameworks \\(\\EC_b\\) and \\(\\EC_c\\) are carelessly combined,\nit is possible to infer for the oscillator something quite analogous\nto the meaningless assertions combining properties of \\(S_x\\) and\n\\(S_z\\). Hence the importance of the single framework rule which\nprohibits combining \\(\\EC_b\\) and \\(\\EC_c\\) (equivalently, \\(\\SC_b\\) and\n\\(\\SC_c\\)). If \\(\\EC_b\\) and \\(\\EC_c\\) cannot be combined, which is\nthe correct framework to use in describing a harmonic\noscillator? The answer, again a key point in the histories\ninterpretation, which will be discussed in more detail\nin section 5, and also section\n11, is that in the quantum world there is never a single correct\nframework, there are always many possibilities, something rather\nstrange from the perspective of classical physics. The single\nframework rule prohibits combining incompatible frameworks;\nit does not assert that there is just one correct framework\nto use in modeling a particular physical situation. One may add that in the early days of quantum theory there was a\ntendency among the practitioners to think that quantum systems must\nalways be in states of well-defined energy, and this led to various\nconundrums. Nowadays states which are superpositions of the ground\nstate and an excited state of an atom are produced routinely in\nquantum optics experiments, and thus analogs of \\(\\EC_c\\) can be quite\nrelevant for a quantum description of what goes on in the\nlaboratory. Once a quantum sample space has been chosen the question arises of\nhow probabilities are to be assigned to the different projectors of\nwhich it is composed. As in other applications of probability theory\nsuch assignments may represent pure guesswork, or contain parameters\nwhich are to be adjusted according to experimental data, or be based\nupon some other information about the system, such as prior\npreparation or a later measurement. Information about the preparation\nof a quantum system is often expressed using a density\noperator \\(\\rho\\), a positive semidefinite operator (Hermitian with\nnonnegative eigenvalues) with trace (sum of the eigenvalues) equal to\n1, used as a pre-probability in the terminology of Sec. 9.4\nof Griffiths (2002a), a mathematical\nobject that can be used to generate a probability distribution. In\nparticular if \\(\\{P_j\\}\\) is a projective decomposition of the identity,\na quantum sample space, one assigns a probability \\[p_j = \\text{Tr}(\\rho P_j) \\label{eqn11}\\] to the property \\(P_j\\). Very often \\(\\rho\\) is referred to as the\n“quantum state”, since it is somewhat analogous to a\nprobability distribution, e.g., a “Gibbs state”, in\nclassical statistical mechanics. The name\n“pre-probability” refers to the fact that \\(\\rho\\) can be\nused to generate many different probability distributions for\ndifferent choices of the sample space. Whereas the distinction between quantum properties and quantum\nstates in the sense of pre-probabilities is often evident from the\ncontext and the use of different symbols, the case of a “pure\nstate” in which the density operator can be written as a rank\none projector or dyad, \\(\\rho =\\dya{\\psi}\\), can lead to confusion in\nthat the same mathematical object can represent either a\npre-probability or a property. Indeed, there is a close connection in\nthat if for such a \\(\\rho\\) one introduces a sample space\n\\(\\{[\\psi],I-]\\psi]\\}\\), the probability of the property \\([\\psi]\\) is 1,\nwhich is to say that if one uses this particular sample space\nthe quantum system certainly has the property \\([\\psi]\\). But if this\nsame \\(\\rho\\) is used as a pre-probability for some other sample space,\nand if one ignores the single framework rule, it is easy to fall into\nthe trap of thinking that \\([\\psi]\\) and some other incompatible\nproperty corresponding to a projector that does not commute with\n\\([\\psi]\\) can both be true, which makes no sense. The best known\nexample of the confusion that results is Schrödinger’s infamous\ndead-and-alive cat, subsection 10.1. Suppose a coin is tossed three times in succession, with results\nheads (\\(H\\)) or tails (\\(T\\)). In the theory of stochastic processes one\nconstructs a sample space \\(\\SC\\) containing 8 events, let us call\nthem histories: \\(HHH\\), \\(HHT\\), \\(HTH\\), …. Notice that\nformally the same sample space is obtained if instead of a coin tossed\nthree times in a row, three different coins are tossed\nsimultaneously. Since in quantum mechanics the Hilbert space of\nseveral separate systems is constructed as a tensor product of the\nindividual Hilbert spaces, this suggests that the Hilbert space for a\nsystem at a sequence of times, the histories Hilbert space,\ncan be constructed as the tensor product of copies of the Hilbert\nspace for a single time. We write it as \\[\\breve \\HC = \\HC_1\\odot\\HC_2\\cdots\\odot\\HC_f \\label{eqn12}\\] for times \\(t_1 <t_2 <\\cdots < t_f\\), where \\(\\odot\\) is\nemployed in place of the usual \\(\\otimes\\) simply to emphasize that a\nsequence of times is involved. A single quantum history will typically correspond to a\nprojector \\[Y^\\alpha = P_1^{\\alpha_1}\\odot P_2^{\\alpha_2}\\odot\\cdots\nP_f^{\\alpha_f}, \\label{eqn13}\\] where the superscript \\(\\alpha_m\\) labels different possible\nprojectors at time \\(t_m\\), and \\(\\alpha =\n(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots\\alpha_f)\\) is a composite label for the\nentire history. (Since the square of a projector is the same as the\nprojector, the superscript position is not needed for exponents, and\nit is convenient to reserve the subscript to indicate the time.) If\nfor each time \\(t_m\\) it is the case that \\(\\sum_{\\alpha_m}\nP_m^{\\alpha_m} = I_m\\) it follows that \\(\\sum_\\alpha Y^\\alpha = \\breve\nI\\), the identity operator on \\(\\breve\\HC\\); thus the \\(\\{Y^\\alpha\\}\\) form\na projective decomposition of the identity \\(\\breve I\\), a quantum\nsample space or family of histories, one and only one of\nwhich will actually occur in any given experimental run. The physical\ninterpretation of \\eqref{eqn13} is that the property \\(P_1^{\\alpha_1}\\)\noccurs or is true at time \\(t_1\\), \\(P_2^{\\alpha_2}\\) at time \\(t_2\\), and\nso forth. Indeed, since we live in a quantum world, the\n“classical” coin-tossing history \\(THT\\) can be written in\nthe form \\eqref{eqn13} using appropriate projectors to represent \\(T\\)\nand \\(H\\). As will be discussed later in section\n6, the histories approach employs the same mathematical procedures\nfor both microscopic and macroscopic physics, consistent with the\nbelief of most physicists that quantum theory applies to phenomena of\nany size. Several comments are in order. First, the projective decompositions\nof the identity at different times need not be the same. Thus for a\nspin half particle one could have the \\(S_z=\\pm 1/2\\) decomposition at\none time and the \\(S_x=\\pm 1/2\\) decomposition at some later\ntime. And more complicated history-dependent decompositions of\n\\(\\breve I\\) are possible; see the\n Further Reading supplement.\n\nSecond, there is\nno reference to measurements. Events occur or do not occur; whether a\nmeasuring apparatus is involved is entirely irrelevant, although\nhistories can be used to discuss what goes on in a measuring process;\nsee section 7. Third, the projectors in a\nhistory can be coarse-grained and specify only a small amount of\ninformation, e.g., the spin degree of freedom of an atom without\nreference to its position; they do not and generally will not project\nonto pure states. Fourth, there is no direct connection between the\nchoice of projectors entering a history and Schrödinger’s\ntime-dependent equation, although in appropriate circumstances the\nlatter can be used to assign probabilities to the different histories\nin a family, as discussed next. Classical mechanics yields a deterministic dynamics only in the\ncase of a closed or isolated system, since an exact\nprediction of the future or past for a system interacting with an\nunknown environment is not possible. But even if one is interested in\nthe approximate dynamics of an open classical system it helps to start\noff with the idealization that the environment and the system of\ninterest are parts of a total system which is isolated, and therefore\nhas a dynamics given by Hamilton’s equations. Similarly, when\nconstructing the intrinsically stochastic dynamics appropriate to\nquantum theory it is helpful to begin with a closed or isolated system\nwith well-defined boundary conditions in which Schrödinger’s equation\nhas well defined solutions and induces a unitary time development\ngiven by a collection of time-evolution operators \\(T(t',t)\\): if\n\\(\\ket{\\psi(t)}\\) is any solution to Schrödinger’s (time-dependent)\nequation, then \\(\\ket{\\psi(t')} = T(t',t)\\ket{\\psi(t)}\\). In the case of\na time-independent Hamiltonian \\(H\\) one has \\(T(t',t) =\n\\exp[-i(t'-t)H/\\hbar]\\). Consider a family \\(\\FC=\\{Y^\\alpha\\}\\) of histories of a closed\nquantum system, for a finite (possibly very large) collection of times\n\\(t_1, t_2, \\ldots t_f\\). Under appropriate conditions one can use\n\\(T(t',t)\\) to assign probabilities in a consistent way to the histories\nin \\(\\FC\\), using a multi-time generalization of the Born rule. To\nsimplify the exposition we restrict attention to situations in which\nall histories begin with the same normalized initial pure state\n\\(\\ket{\\Psi_0}\\) at a time \\(t_0 <t_1\\), and modify the definition in\n\\eqref{eqn13} so that it reads \\[Y^\\alpha = [\\Psi_0]\\odot P_1^{\\alpha_1}\\odot\nP_2^{\\alpha_2}\\odot\\cdots P_f^{\\alpha_f}.  \\label{eqn14}\\] In addition, add an extra history \\(Y^0=(I-[\\Psi_0])\\odot I_1\\odot\nI_2\\cdots\\) so that the sum of all the history projectors together is\nthe identity \\(\\breve I\\) on the Hilbert space\n\\(\\HC_0\\odot\\HC_1\\odot\\cdots\\). (Here, consistent with the notation used\nelsewhere in this article, \\([\\Psi_0]\\) denotes the projector\n\\(\\dya{\\Psi_0}\\).) Then define a collection of “chain kets”\n\\(\\ket{\\Phi^\\alpha}\\), \\[\\ket{\\Phi^\\alpha} = P^{\\alpha_f}_f T(t_f,t_{f-1})\n  P^{\\alpha_{f-1}}_{f-1} T(t_{f-1},t_{f-2})\\cdots P^{\\alpha_1}_1\n  T(t_1,t_0) \\ket{\\Psi_0}, \\label{eqn15}\\] one for each history \\(\\alpha\\). Provided the consistency\nconditions \\[\\inpd{\\Phi^\\alpha}{\\Phi^{\\alpha'}} = 0 \\text{ for }\n\\alpha\\neq\\alpha', \\label{eqn16}\\] are satisfied, where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\alpha'\\) are considered unequal\nif \\(\\alpha_m\\neq \\alpha'_m\\) for at least one value of \\(m\\) between 1\nand \\(f\\), the history \\(Y^\\alpha\\) is assigned the probability \\[\\Pr(Y^\\alpha) = \\inp{\\Phi^\\alpha}.  \\label{eqn17}\\] In the case \\(f=1\\) the consistency condition \\eqref{eqn16} is\nautomatically satisfied because the projectors at \\(t_1\\) are orthogonal\nto each other, and the probabilities \\(\\inp{\\Phi^\\alpha}\\) are those\ngiven by the usual Born rule. For \\(f=2\\) or more the consistency\nconditions are not trivial, and when they are satisfied \\eqref{eqn17}\nprovides a generalization of the Born\nrule.[1] Insight\ninto the meaning of the consistency conditions is best obtained by\nworking through examples;  see the \n Further Reading supplement.\n\nFamilies\nfor which the consistency conditions are satisfied are\ncalled consistent families, and it is only for this\nrestricted class that the laws of quantum dynamics for a closed system\ncan be used to assign a meaningful set of probabilities. Some additional comments. First, two consistent families \\(\\FC_a\\)\nand \\(\\FC_b\\) may be such that the (history) projectors in one commute\nwith those in the other, but still the common coarsest refinement does\nnot satisfy the dynamical consistency conditions, in which case they\nare said to be incommensurate and cannot be combined, at\nleast if one wishes to use the dynamical laws of quantum mechanics to\nassign them probabilities. Second, measurements play no role\nin terms of the fundamental mathematical formulation or its physical\ninterpretation. In classical physics there is never any difficulty in\nimagining events actually occurring inside a closed system, even with\nno observers or measuring apparatus present. The same is true for\nquantum physics once one removes “measurement” from its\nspurious role as an interpretive principle, and instead treats it like\nany other quantum process, see section 7. Third,\nthe histories approach is time symmetrical in the sense that\nthe rules for assigning probabilities do not single out a particular\n“direction” or sense of time. (This symmetry is evident in\nthe more complete discussion in Ch. 10\nof Griffiths (2002a), which allows more\ngeneral types of family. That generality has been sacrificed here in\nthe interests of a simpler and more intuitive exposition based on the\nassumption of a single pure state at the initial time.) The histories interpretation of quantum mechanics, as noted\nearlier, is probabilistic, and hence the processes of reasoning are\nthose that scientists generally use for probabilistic models. This\nrequires a method of assigning probabilities along with procedures for\ndrawing inferences, usually in the form of conditional\nprobabilities. In both these respects quantum theory resembles other\napplications of probabilistic reasoning. The main difference is the\nnecessity in the quantum case of paying close attention to the problem\nof choosing a sample space (which then determines the event algebra)\nor framework, and then confining the logical reasoning process, from\nassumptions to conclusions, to a single framework. We have\nalready encountered some applications of this single framework rule,\nand additional ones are discussed later, but at this point it is\nuseful to summarize some of the basic principles involved, which can\nbe conveniently placed under four headings: The reasoning process begins with some initial data, which\nmay reflect some knowledge of the system under discussion or may be\npurely hypothetical. Here “initial” refers to the\nbeginning of a logical argument, not necessarily to the initial state\nof a quantum system, though the latter is often included in the\ninitial data. These data must then be expressed in appropriate quantum\nterms as some sort of property or properties, subspaces of an\nappropriate Hilbert space, which could be a space of histories, all\nbelonging to a single framework or event algebra, principle\nR3. Generally there will be more than one framework that can contain\nthe initial data, and the physicist is at liberty to choose among\nthese possibilities, R1. However, the types of conclusions which can\nbe drawn using a particular framework (and thus event algebra) will\ndepend upon the framework, and for this reason the physicist’s\ninterests can, and in general will, influence the choice of\nframework. It is utility, R4, which determines this choice; from a\nfundamental point of view all frameworks are equally good, R2. The link between initial data and the conclusions one can draw from\nthem will be probabilistic (sometimes with probabilities 0 or 1, hence\ndeterministic). One might be concerned that the flexibility in\nframework choice provided by R1 and R2 could lead to different results\nwhen using different frameworks. However, it is straightforward to\nshow, see Ch. 16 of Griffiths (2002a),\nthat as long as both frameworks contain all the events needed to\nexpress the initial data and also those needed for drawing\nconclusions, the probabilities linking data and conclusions will be\nidentical even if the two frameworks in question are mutually\nincompatible. This ensures an overall consistency. The discussion of\nquantum preparation and measurement found in\n section 7 below will show how principles\nof quantum reasoning apply to\nmeasurements, a topic that has given rise to a lot of confusion. A counterfactual argument begins by imagining another world which\nresembles the actual world in certain respects and differs from it in\nothers, and asking the question: “What would be the\ncase if instead of …it were true that\n…”. For example, “What would the weather be like in\nPittsburgh in January if the city were 1000 kilometers closer to the\nequator?” In general, counterfactual reasoning is not easy to\nanalyze, and this gives rise to difficulties when trying to understand\nquantum paradoxes stated in counterfactual form. The basic principle\ngoverning counterfactual reasoning in the histories approach is the\nsingle framework rule, with the requirement that a comparison between\nthe real and the counterfactual world be carried out using\nthe same framework for both. For details, see the\nFurther Reading supplement\nand the applications in Sec. 10.4 below.\n\n The histories approach assumes that the same fundamental quantum\nmechanical laws apply to systems of any size, from quarks to jaguars\nto quasars. Classical mechanics is a very good approximation to the\nmore exact quantum laws in appropriate circumstances. The following\nremarks \nprovide only a broad outline of how the classical world\nemerges from quantum theory; see the \n Further Reading supplement for additional\nmaterial.\n\n The first task is to identify suitable quasiclassical\nframeworks, appropriate choices of projective decompositions of the\nidentity at a single time corresponding to macroscopic properties,\ntogether with suitable quantum histories that involve such properties,\nwith results which correspond closely to the time development of\nclassical physics. The desired decompositions will be coarse grained,\nwith individual projectors corresponding to subspaces of enormous\ndimension (e.g., 10 raised to the power \\(10^{16}\\)). In such a\nsituation it is plausible that there are families containing quantum\nhistories having a probability very close to 1, and which exhibit a\ntime development that closely approximates that of classical\nmechanics. To be sure, the task of showing that classical laws emerge to a\ngood approximation in this manner is a nontrivial one, and it cannot\nbe claimed that it has been completed. However, the effort expended\nthus far has not revealed any fundamental difficulty which would\nundermine this approach. One also expects to find cases in which the\nrelevant quantum probabilities are not close to 0 or 1; in particular\nin a regime where classical analysis predicts chaos (positive Lyapunov\nexponents) quantum “fluctuations” are likely to be\namplified. But this is also a situation in which the deterministic\naspect of classical time development is not to be taken too seriously,\ndue to the sensitive dependence upon initial conditions, so there is\nno reason to suppose that an appropriate quantum description cannot be\nconstructed, at least in principle. Understanding the emergence of classical physics from the quantum\nworld does not require a unique quasiclassical framework; there are\nundoubtedly a large number of different possibilities, any one of\nwhich could for the circumstances of interest provide\n“classical” results within a suitable approximation\n(further comments on nonuniqueness will be found\nin subsection 11.3 below). In constructing a\nquasiclassical description decoherence plays a useful role in\nthe sense that it removes the effects of quantum interference which\nmight otherwise render a quasiclassical family inconsistent,\npreventing the application of the Born rule and its\ngeneralizations. Once again, this statement can be supported by model\ncalculations of an appropriate sort which make it plausible, but work\nstill remains to be done in coming to a full understanding of\ndecoherence in quantum terms. Invoking decoherence by itself outside\nthe framework provided by the histories approach does not solve the\nconceptual difficulties of quantum theory; see,\ne.g., Adler (2003). The principles discussed above provide a resolution of\nthe measurement problem of quantum foundations: that is, how\nto discuss the measurement process itself in fully quantum mechanical\nterms. It is convenient to think of this as made up of two\nproblems: The reliable preparation of a microscopic system in a\nparticular quantum state raises similar conceptual issues; indeed,\nwhat in textbooks are often called “measurements” would be\nbetter thought of as “preparations”. Both are discussed\nbelow. The issues are most simply addressed by using a simple schematic\nquantum model of measurement and preparation that goes back\nto J. von Neumann (1932: sec. VI.3). Let\n\\(\\HC_s\\) be the Hilbert space of the system to be measured, henceforth\nreferred to as a particle, and \\(\\HC_m\\) that of the measuring\ndevice or apparatus. For example, \\(\\HC_s\\) could be the\n2-dimensional Hilbert space of the spin of a spin-half particle,\nwhereas the quantum description of its position might be included in\n\\(\\HC_m\\), along with all the many degrees of freedom needed to describe\nthe apparatus itself. Let \\(\\{\\ket{s^j}\\}\\) be an orthonormal basis for\n\\(\\HC_s\\), with states labeled by a superscript so subscripts can label\ntime. Let \\[\\ket{s_0} = \\sum_j c_j \\ket{s^j},\\quad \\ket{m_0},\\quad\n\\ket{\\Psi_0}=\\ket{s_0}\\otimes\\ket{m_0} \\label{eqn18}\\] be the normalized initial states of the particle, the measuring\ndevice, and the total system at time \\(t_0\\). Here \\(c_j\\) are complex\nnumbers satisfying \\(\\sum_j|c_j|^2=1\\). Let \\(T(t',t)\\), subsection 4.2, be the unitary\ntime development operator for the total system, and assume it is\ntrivial—equal to the identity operator \\(I=I_s\\otimes\nI_m\\)—for \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) both less than some \\(t_1\\) or both greater\nthan \\(t_2\\), whereas for the interval from \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_2\\) during which\nthe particle and the apparatus interact, \\[T(t_2,t_1) \\bigl( \\ket{s^j}\\otimes\\ket{m_0}\\bigr) =\n\\ket{w^j}\\otimes \\ket{m^j}.  \\label{eqn19}\\] Here the \\(\\ket{m^j}\\) are orthonormal states of the apparatus,\n\\(\\inpd{m^j}{m^k}=\\delta_{jk}\\), corresponding to different pointer\npositions, and the \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) are normalized, \\(\\inp{w^j}=1\\),\nbut not necessarily orthogonal; it may be that\n\\(\\inpd{w^j}{w^k}\\neq 0\\) when \\(j\\neq k\\). (In von Neumann’s original\nmodel the \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) were the same as the \\(\\ket{s^j}\\), and this is\nalso possible, but is not being assumed, for the situation we are\nconsidering.) The transformation \\eqref{eqn19} can be extended to a\nunitary transformation on \\(\\HC_s\\otimes\\HC_m\\), because the\northogonality of the \\(\\ket{m^j}\\) ensures that the states on the right\nside of \\eqref{eqn19} are normalized and mutually orthogonal. Unitary\ntime development leads to states for the total system at times \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\). To study the physical implications of this model we need to\nintroduce a family of histories. From a mathematical perspective the\nsimplest such family is based solely on unitary time development and\ntakes the form \\[\\FC_u:\\;\\;[\\Psi_0]\\;\\odot\\; \\{[\\Psi_1],I-[\\Psi_1]\\}\\;\\odot\\;\n\\{[\\Psi_2], I-[\\Psi_2]\\}, \\label{eqn21}\\] where \\([\\Psi_1]\\) and \\([\\Psi_2]\\) are projectors onto the states\n\\(\\ket{\\Psi_1}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\Psi_2}\\) defined in \\eqref{eqn20}, and the\nfamily \\eqref{eqn21} should be interpreted as a set of four mutually\nexclusive histories obtained by choosing at \\(t_1\\) one of the\nprojectors inside the first pair of curly brackets, and at \\(t_2\\) one\ninside the second pair. The corresponding chain\nkets, subsection 4.2, are zero except for the\nsingle history \\([\\Psi_0]\\odot [\\Psi_1] \\odot [\\Psi_2]\\), which is\nassigned probability 1 by \\eqref{eqn17}. The family \\(\\FC_u\\) is of no use for resolving the first measurement\nproblem M1, because the family of histories does not include the\nprojectors \\(\\{[m^j]\\}\\) for the pointer positions at time \\(t_2\\) needed\nto discuss the measurement outcome, nor can it be refined to include\nthem, because \\([\\Psi_2]\\) will not commute with some of the \\([m^j]\\),\nassuming at least two of the \\(c_j\\) in \\eqref{eqn18} are nonzero. This\nis the basic reason why the first measurement problem M1 is an\nenormous difficulty for quantum interpretations in which the only\npossible time dependence for a closed quantum system is that given by\nSchrödinger’s equation. By contrast, the histories approach gives the\nphysicist Liberty to use a different family \\[\\FC_1:\\;\\;[\\Psi_0]\\;\\odot\\;[\\Psi_1] \\;\\odot\\; \\{[m^j]\\}\n\\label{eqn22}\\] in place of \\(\\FC_u\\). Note that \\([m^j]\\) is understood as\n\\(I_s\\otimes[m^j]\\), using a common physicist’s convention. In addition\na projector \\(R=I_m-\\sum_j[m^j]\\) should be included among the\npossibilities at the final time \\(t_2\\), but as it occurs with zero\nprobability it can be ignored. The consistency of the family \\(\\FC_1\\)\nis easily demonstrated, and the probability \\(|c_j|^2\\) for the final\nposition \\([m^j]\\) is an immediate consequence of \\eqref{eqn17}. However, the second measurement problem M2, relating the outcome of\nthe measurement to the property of the particle before the\nmeasurement, cannot be solved using the family \\(\\FC_1\\), because the\nproperties of interest, the \\([s^j]\\), are not included among the\npossibilities at time \\(t_1\\). To discuss these requires another\nfamily \\[\\FC_2:\\;\\;[\\Psi_0]\\;\\odot\\; \\{ [s^j]\\}\\;\\odot\\; \\{[m^k]\\}.\n\\label{eqn23}\\] Again, \\([s^j]\\) can be understood as \\([s^j]\\otimes I_m\\), a property\nof the particle without reference to the apparatus. Showing that\n\\(\\FC_2\\) is consistent is straightforward, as is calculating the joint\nprobability distribution \\[\\Pr(\\,[s^j]_1,[m^k]_2) = |c_j|^2 \\delta_{jk} \\label{eqn24}\\] using \\eqref{eqn17}. Here the subscripts refer to the time: the\nparticle property at time \\(t_1\\) before the measurement takes place,\nand the outcome at \\(t_2\\) when the measurement is over. The marginal\nprobabilities are \\[\\Pr([s^j]_1) = \\Pr([m^j]_2) = |c_j|^2.  \\label{eqn25}\\] Thus for every case in which \\(c_k\\) is not zero (so \\([m^k]\\) occurs\nwith finite probability) one has the conditional probability \\[\\Pr([s^j]_1 \\boldsymbol{\\mid} [m^k]_2) = \\delta_{jk}.\n\\label{eqn26}\\] In other words, given a measurement outcome \\([m^k]\\) at \\(t_2\\) one\ncan be certain that the prior state of the particle at \\(t_1\\) was\n\\([s^k]\\); i.e., the apparatus did what it was designed to do. The reader may have noticed that the particle states \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) in\n\\eqref{eqn19} played no role in our discussion of measurement\nin subsection 7.2. Von Neumann’s\noriginal (1932: sec. VI.3) presentation\nused \\(\\ket{w^j}=\\ket{s^j}\\), as he thought it important that a second\nmeasurement could confirm the first. This practice was followed in\nlater textbooks, and has resulted in some confusion. The \\(\\ket{w^j}\\)\nare in fact irrelevant when considering measurements, but they are\nuseful when considering a preparation procedure in which\nmacroscopic apparatus is used to produce a quantum system—again\nwe shall speak of it as a particle—in some well-defined\nstate. To see how this works let us again employ the model\nof subsection 7.1 with unitary development given\nby \\eqref{eqn19}, but now introduce a family \\[\\FC_p:\\;\\;[\\Psi_0]\\;\\odot\\;[\\Psi_1] \\;\\odot\\;\n\\{[v^l]\\otimes[m^j]\\} \\label{eqn27}\\] that is a refinement of \\(\\FC_1\\) in \\eqref{eqn22}, with \\(I_s\\)\nreplaced by a projective decomposition onto some orthonormal basis\n\\(\\{\\ket{v^j}\\}\\) of the particle Hilbert space \\(\\HC_s\\). The joint\nprobability distribution at time \\(t_2\\) of the particle and pointer\nstates is then Since \\(\\Pr([m^j]) = |c_j|^2\\), \\eqref{eqn25}, one obtains the\nconditional probability \\[\\Pr([v^l]\\boldsymbol{\\mid} [m^j]) = |\\inpd{v^l}{w^j}|^2\n\\label{eqn29}\\] (assuming \\(|c_j|^2\\) is not 0). That is to say, if the measurement\noutcome is known to be \\([m^j]\\), then the probability of any property\nof the particle is precisely that given by assuming the particle is in\nthe state \\(\\ket{w^j}\\), with “state” having its usual\nmeaning: a pre-probability from which the probability distribution for\nthe properties represented by any projective decomposition of its\nidentity can be calculated; see subsection\n3.5. Note that this discussion remains valid when \\(\\{\\ket{w^j}\\}\\) is not\na collection of orthogonal states, even though this means that the\ncorresponding projectors \\(\\{[w^j]\\}\\) cannot all belong to the same\nprojective decomposition of \\(I_s\\). The point is that \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) is\nassigned to the particle only in association with the projector\n\\([m^j]\\), and the collection \\(\\{\\ket{w^j}\\otimes\\ket{m^j}\\}\\) is\northogonal. In such circumstances the \\([w^j]\\) are what in Ch. 14\nof Griffiths (2002a) are referred to\nas dependent or contextual\n(“conditional” would be equally good) properties:\nthey must be understood in conjunction with other properties, which in\nthis case are the pointer positions \\([m^j]\\), when forming part of a\nquantum description or history. What has here been deduced from fundamental quantum principles,\nincluding the Born rule, is in textbooks stated as a mysterious and\nseparate principle of “wave function collapse”: if the\nmeasurement outcome is \\([m^j]\\) then the particle state\n“collapses” onto a particular state associated with this\noutcome. To make closer contact with textbook discussions of this\ntopic, let \\[S = \\sum_j \\sigma_j [s^j] \\label{eqn30}\\] be a Hermitian operator with nondegenerate eigenvalues \\(\\sigma_j\\),\nand let \\(\\ket{w^j}=\\ket{s^j}\\). Then the measurement outcome \\([m^j]\\)\ncorresponds to measuring the eigenvalue \\(\\sigma_j\\)—see the\nremarks in subsection 3.3—and\n\\eqref{eqn29} and the remarks following it justify assigning to the\nparticle at time \\(t_2\\) the ket \\(\\ket{w^j}=\\ket{s^j}\\). One may add that\nthe more general form of wave function collapse embodied in the\nLüder’s rule (Busch & Lahti 2009) is\nlikewise a consequence of the general quantum principles governing\nstochastic time development set forth in section\n4, so need not be added as an additional hypothesis. \nIn any case there is no need to set \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) equal to\n\\(\\ket{s^j}\\) in order to discuss quantum measurements, and a better\nway of viewing the family \\(\\FC_p\\) in \\eqref{eqn27} is as a model of\na quantum preparation process in which the macroscopic pointer\nposition tells one the future rather than the past state of the\nparticle. The conditional probability in \\eqref{eqn29} refers\nspecifically to properties at the time \\(t_2\\), but given the\nassumption that \\(T(t',t)\\) is trivial for times after \\(t_2\\), the\nargument leading to \\eqref{eqn29} is easily extended to \\([v^l]\\) and\n\\([m^j]\\) at any times (not necessarily the same) later than \\(t_2\\).\nIn general the outcome \\([m^j]\\) is random, and if the wrong \\(j\\)\noccurs \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) may not be the desired state.  But then the\npreparer can throw the particle away (run it into a baffle) and repeat\nthe experiment until the desired outcome occurs. There are more\nsophisticated ways to do preparations, but our model illustrates the\ngeneral idea, and in fact discarding unwanted outcomes is a procedure\noften used in quantum optics.  The essential point is that an\napparatus can be constructed using quantum principles to prepare a\nparticle whose future state is known on the basis of macroscopic\n(pointer) information. Von Neumann’s measurement model in \n section 7.1\nis often referred to as a “projective measurement”, since its outcome\n\\(k\\), see , indicates an earlier quantum property corresponding to\nthe projector \\([s^k]\\). It is also called a “strong measurement” in\ncontrast to a weak measurement as defined below. In practice one often\nuses a more general measurement model, referred to as\na generalized measurement or POVM (positive operator value\nmeasure) where the measurement outcome corresponds not to a specific\nproperty but instead to a positive (semi-definite) operator for the\nmeasured system at an earlier time. \n\n Generalized measurements are often thought of in the following\nway. Instead of interacting directly with the measurement apparatus,\nthe system to be measured first interacts with another (microscopic)\nsystem, a probe, prepared in a known quantum state. Then the\nprobe is subjected to a projective measurement, and from its outcome\none learns something about the original system. If the interaction\nbetween the probe and the system of interest is very weak this is\ncalled a weak measurement. Sometimes a hybrid measurement is\nemployed, in which, following its interaction with a probe, the\noriginal system is subjected to another (typically projective)\nmeasurement. Both the weak measurement and the hybrid are examples of\ngeneralized measurements, and can be discussed in the manner indicated\nbelow. A weak measurement must be carefully distinguished from\na weak value; see the comment at the end of this section. \nThe generalized measurement model starts, as in Sec. [sbct7.1], with a\nHilbert space \\({{\\mathcal H}}={{\\mathcal H}}_s\\otimes{{\\mathcal\nH}}_m\\), where \\({{\\mathcal H}}_s\\) represents the measured system\n(hereafter referred to as a particle), and \\({{\\mathcal H}}_m\\) the\nmeasuring apparatus, including the probe if that is part of the\narrangement. And as in and assume an initial state\n \n and a unitary time development from \\(t_0\\) to later times \\(t_1 < t_2\\) given by \n \nwhere, as previously, we are assuming that the time interval from\n\\(t_0\\) to \\(t_1\\) is so short that \\(T(t_1,t_0)\\) is the identity\noperator. \nBut instead of introducing pure states \\({|m^j\\rangle }\\) for the\ndifferent positions of the measurement pointer, we assume a projective\ndecomposition of the identity of \\({{\\mathcal H}}\\), \nwhere \\(M^k\\) projects onto the entire (macroscopic) subspace in which\nthe apparatus pointer is in position \\(k\\). Since any two situations\nwhich are macroscopically distinct correspond to mutually orthogonal\nsubspaces of the quantum Hilbert space, the \\(M^k\\) for different\n\\(k\\) will be orthogonal to each other. In addition one can include a\nspecial projector, say \\(\\hat M\\), in the sum to represent any\nadditional possibilities (e.g., the pointer has fallen off the\napparatus), to make the sum add up to \\(I\\). The \\({|m^j\\rangle }\\) of\nSec. [sbct7.1] are related to the \\(M^k\\) through \ni.e., \\({|m^j\\rangle }\\) belongs to the subspace associated with\n\\(M^j\\). \nSince we are interested in what the measurement tells us about the\nparticle, we can regard the initial apparatus state \\({|m_0\\rangle }\\)\nin as fixed, and indicate the dependence of \\({|\\Psi_2\\rangle }\\) on\n\\({|s_0\\rangle }\\) using the formula \nwhere \\(J\\) is an isometry (it preserves inner products) that maps\n\\({{\\mathcal H}}_s\\) onto a subspace of \\({{\\mathcal H}}\\). This\nprovides a convenient way to define operators \nacting on \\({{\\mathcal H}}_s\\). Because the \\(M^k\\) are positive\n(semi-definite) operators, the same is true of the \\(Q^k\\), and\nbecause \\(J{^\\dagger }J= I_s\\) (\\(J{^\\dagger }\\) is the left inverse\nof \\(J\\)), it follows from that \n(We assume that \\(\\hat Q=J{^\\dagger }\\hat M J=0\\) for the special\nprojector \\(\\hat M\\) introduced following .) Thus \\(\\{Q^k\\}\\) is a\ncollection of positive operators which sum to the identity, which is\nthe definition of a POVM. \nIf every \\(Q^k\\) is a projector, then implies that they are mutually\northogonal, and form a projective decomposition of the identity of\n\\({{\\mathcal H}}_s\\). This means we are dealing with a projective\nmeasurement, though more general than the von Neumann model of\nSec. [sbct7.1], as the \\(Q^k\\) may project on subspaces of dimension\ngreater than 1. However, in general \\(Q^k\\) is not a projector or\nproportional to a projector, but since it is Hermitian it can be\nwritten in the form \nwhere for a fixed \\(k\\) the \\(\\{\\xi^{jk}\\}\\) form a projective\ndecomposition of \\(I_s\\), and the \\(\\{q_{jk}\\}\\) are the nonnegative\neigenvalues of \\(Q^k\\). It is then not hard to show that the family of\nhistories \nlabeled by both \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), is consistent. It gives rise to\nconditional probabilities \nwhere the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 indicate the time. In words, what\ntells us is that if at the end of a run the pointer is in position\n\\(k\\), then at the earlier time before the measurement took place the\nparticle had a property represented by a projector \\(\\xi^{jk}\\) for\nsome value of \\(j\\). If in addition the initial state \\({|s_0\\rangle\n}\\) is known, that can be used to assign a probability \\(p_{jk}\\),\nnote that \\(\\sum_j p_{jk}=1\\), to the property \\(\\xi^{jk}\\) at time\n\\(t_1\\). While not as “clean” as in the case of a projective\nmeasurement, this can still be informative. \nLet us close this section with two additional remarks about weak\nmeasurements, including the hybrid case. First, there is an abundant\nliterature in which weak measurements are discussed in terms of\nso-called weak values of certain quantum observables. The\nphysical significance (if any) of weak values has been the subject of\nan ongoing controversy. Without entering that discussion it is worth\npointing out that apart from exceptional cases a weak value has\nnothing to do with a quantum property in the sense used in the\nhistories interpretation, related to some subspace of the quantum\nHilbert space; e.g., one of the \\(\\xi^{jk}\\) in . \nSecond, a single weak measurement corresponding to a weak interaction\nbetween particle and probe will not yield much information about the\nparticle, and hence it is usually assumed that such a measurement will\nbe repeated a large number of times, with the particle prepared in the\nsame initial state for each run, so that useful information can be\nextracted from the random outcomes. It is sometimes assumed that\nbecause the interaction is weak, in none of the runs will the state of\nthe particle change significantly. However, that is not necessarily\nthe case. Weakness of the interaction is also consistent with the\nparticle’s state being drastically altered in a number of runs,\nprovided these are but a small fraction of the total. A useful example\nis provided by Feynman (Feynman, Leighton,\n& Sands: Chapter 1) in his discussion of a weak light\nsource used to determine which of two holes an electron passes through\non its way to a distant screen where successive arrivals display a\ntwo-hole (double slit) interference pattern. If the light source is\nvery weak, only for a small fraction of the runs does a scattered\nphoton reveals which hole the electron went through. But if one\ncollects data for these rare instances one finds a very large effect:\nin these runs the interference pattern is completely washed out. See the \n Further Reading supplement for additional\ndetails of the histories approach to generalized and weak\nmeasurements. \nIn summary, the histories approach resolves both quantum measurement problems\nM1 and M2 by introducing appropriate stochastic families of histories.\nIn order to describe the measurement outcome as a pointer position one needs an\nappropriate projective decomposition of the identity—\\(\\{[m^j]\\}\\) in the\nsimplest model or the more general \\(\\{M^k\\}\\) of \n section 7.4—associated\nwith the pointer positions. Similarly, in order to discuss how properties of\nthe microscopic particle before the measurement are related to measurement\noutcomes, one needs a decomposition at \\(t_1\\) that includes these properties,\nthe \\([s^j]\\) in \\eqref{eqn23} for the simple model or the \\(\\xi^{jk}\\) in\n\\eqref{eqn38} for a generalized measurement. There is no fundamental quantum\nprinciple that forces one to use these decompositions. The choice is based on\nutility, and illustrates the importance of principle R4 in \n section 5. If\none wants to discuss measurements as measurements, one needs\nto adopt a framework in which the associated concepts make sense. And,\nsince it is often misunderstood, it is worth emphasizing that neither\nthe validity nor the utility of a particular framework is in any way\nreduced by the existence of other frameworks which are incompatible\n(or incommensurate) with it. \nThe models employed here are a bit simplistic compared to the experimental\nsituation in a laboratory. However, extending them to something more realistic\nposes difficulties no worse than those encountered when introducing\nquasiclassical descriptions. Thus, rather than a pure initial\nstate \\(\\ket{m_0}\\) for the apparatus it is more realistic to use a macroscopic\nprojector of the type mentioned in \n section 6, or else an initial density\noperator. These changes present no difficulty in principle, and some\nof them are discussed in Ch. 17 of Griffiths (2002a). The role of\ndecoherence is to allow a consistent quasiclassical description, as\nnoted in\n section 6. By itself decoherence does not\nresolve either of the measurement problems; see, e.g., Adler\n(2003). Finally, while wave function collapse is a legitimate calculational\nprocedure when describing a preparation in quantum mechanical terms,\nit amounts to nothing more than a convenient way of calculating\nconditional probabilities useful in the quantum description of a\npreparation. Trying to view it as some sort of mysterious physical\nprocess leads to confusion and the incorrect notion that quantum\nmechanics is somehow inconsistent with special relativity, which is\nour next topic. According to some interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, e.g., \n d’Espagnat (2006),\nMaudlin (2011),\nthe quantum world is infested with nonlocal influences:\nsystems which are far apart, even spacelike separated in the sense of\nspecial relativity, can influence each other. This has given rise to\nthe notion that quantum theory is incompatible with special\nrelativity. No such nonlocal influences are present in the histories\ninterpretation, which is perfectly compatible with special\nrelativity. See the \nFurther Reading supplement for the detailed discussions\nunderlying the following remarks.\n\n The Bohm version (Bohm 1951: Chapter\n22) of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nparadox (Einstein, Podolsky, & Rosen\n1935) is based on the spin singlet state \\[\\ket{\\psi_0} = \\bigl( \\ket{z^+_a,z^+_b} - \\ket{z^-_a,z^-_b}\n\\bigr) \\label{eqn41}\\] of two spin-half particles \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), using the same notation as\nin subsection 2.3. This is said to be\nan entangled state because it is not a product state of the\nform \\(\\ket{a,b} = \\ket{a}\\otimes\\ket{b}\\). It is easy to show that the\ncorresponding projector \\([\\psi_0]\\) does not commute with any projector\non a nontrivial property of particle \\(a\\), such as \\([z^+_a]\\), or on a\nnontrivial property of \\(b\\). (The trivial properties are the identity\nand the zero projector.) Thus a quantum description that contains\n\\([\\psi_0]\\) as a property cannot at the same time ascribe any\nnontrivial properties to either of the particles. This is a mathematical fact which makes no reference to where the\nparticles are located in space. It is true for the ground state of a\nhydrogen atom, in which the electron and proton are on top of each\nother, as well as for the situation we consider next in which particle\n\\(a\\) is in Alice’s laboratory and \\(b\\) in Bob’s laboratory some distance\naway. Suppose that Alice measures \\(S_{az}\\) for her particle and Bob\nmeasures \\(S_{bz}\\) for his. Then using \\([\\psi_0]\\) as a\npre-probability, subsection 3.5, one\ncan show that the outcomes, although they are random, will always be\nopposite: if Alice obtains \\(+1/2\\) (in units of \\(\\hbar\\)), Bob will find\n\\(-1/2\\); if Alice obtains \\(-1/2\\), Bob will find \\(+1/2\\). Correlated outcomes are by themselves not surprising once one\naccepts the idea that quantum mechanics is stochastic, not\ndeterministic. Here is a classical analogy: Charlie in Chicago places\na red slip of paper in an opaque envelope and a green slip in a second\nidentical envelope, and after shuffling them chooses one at random and\nmails it to Alice in Atlanta and the other to Bob in Boston. Upon\nopening her envelope and finding a red slip, Alice can at once\nconclude from her knowledge of the protocol that Bob’s envelope\ncontains a green slip of paper. There is no need to invoke some\nsuperluminal influence to explain this. Her reasoning is exactly the same in the case where Charlie\nprepares a spin singlet state at the center of the laboratory and\nsends the two particles in opposite directions towards apparatuses\nconstructed by Alice and Bob, both competent experimentalists, and\nAlice measures \\(S_{az}\\). From her measurement outcome and because she\nis a competent experimentalist she is entitled to conclude that before\nthe measurement took place particle \\(a\\) possessed the value indicated\nlater by the pointer position; see the discussion\nin subsection 7.2. Assume for the sake of\ndiscussion that this was \\(S_{az} = +1/2\\). Then from her knowledge of\nthe protocol (initial singlet state) she can assign a state\n\\(S_{bz}=-1/2\\) to Bob’s particle and use this (as a pre-probability) to\nassign a probability to the outcome of a measurement of \\(S_{bz}\\). She\nemploys a scheme of probabilistic inference appropriate to the quantum\nworld; there is no need to invoke wave function collapse except,\nperhaps, as a handy calculational tool. But suppose Bob rather than measuring \\(S_{bz}\\) measures some other\ncomponent \\(S_{bw}\\) of the spin of particle \\(b\\), where \\(w\\) could be \\(x\\)\nor \\(y\\) or some arbitrary direction in space? Again, Alice on the basis\nof her measurement outcome can still assign an \\(S_{bz}\\) value to Bob’s\nparticle before measurement, and use it as a pre-probability to\ncalculate a probability for Bob’s measurement outcome. Conversely,\ngiven the outcome of his \\(S_{bw}\\) measurement (and knowledge of the\nprotocol) Bob can assign a state \\(S_{aw}\\) to Alice’s particle before\nit is measured, and use that to predict the outcome of a measurement\nof \\(S_{az}\\). Both reasoning processes follow the rules indicated above\nin subsection 5.1, but when \\(w\\) is neither \\(z\\)\nnor \\(-z\\) the single framework rule means they cannot be combined. It\nis at this point that quantum principles must be used, unlike the\nanalysis applicable to colored slips of paper, where one can employ\nthe single quasiclassical framework (section 6)\nappropriate for macroscopic physics. If Alice measured \\(S_{az}\\), then surely she could have\ninstead measured \\(S_{ax}\\) perhaps making the choice between this and\n\\(S_{az}\\) at the very last instant, even after Bob has completed his\nmeasurement; what would have occurred in that situation? This\nis a counterfactual question of the form discussed\nin subsection 5.2, \nand we refer the reader to the references given there. Quantum theory predicts correlations in the spin-singlet state that\ndo not satisfy Bell inequalities (Shimony\n2009), and by now there is ample evidence from experiments on\nthe analogous property of pairs of correlated photons that quantum\ntheory is correct, and therefore one or more of the assumptions that\ngo into the derivation of a Bell inequality must be faulty. While the\nclaim has been made that the key assumption is locality, and therefore\na violation of Bell inequalities implies that the real (quantum) world\nis nonlocal, a histories analysis identifies the problem as a\ndifferent assumption made by Bell: the existence of classical hidden\nvariables that are inconsistent with Hilbert space quantum\nmechanics. For more details see the \n Further Reading supplement.\n\n In addition, the histories approach makes it possible to establish\non the basis of quantum mechanics itself a principle of Einstein\nlocality (Griffiths 2011b): Objectively real internal properties of an isolated individual\nsystem do not change when something is done to another non-interacting\nsystem. This statement is to be understood in the following way. Let\n\\(\\HC_S\\) be the Hilbert spaces of an isolated individual system \\(S\\),\n\\(\\HC_R\\) that of the rest of the world, so \\(\\HC=\\HC_S\\otimes\\HC_R\\) is\nthe Hilbert space of the total system. The properties of \\(S\\) must be\nrepresented by a projective decomposition of \\(\\HC_S\\), or by a\nconsistent family of such properties. That \\(S\\) is isolated means there\nis no interaction between \\(S\\) and \\(R\\), which is to say that for any\ntwo times \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) during the period of interest the time\ndevelopment operator of the total system factors: \\[T(t',t)=T_S(t',t)\\otimes T_R(t',t).  \\label{eqn42}\\] Something done to another system might be, for example, the choice\nbetween measuring \\(S_{bx}\\) and \\(S_{bz}\\) for a particle \\(b\\) which is\npart of \\(R\\), with the measuring apparatus and whatever makes the\nmeasurement choice, e.g., a quantum\ncoin (Sec. 19.2 of Griffiths 2002a) that\nis also part of \\(R\\). Quantum information is at present a very active field of research,\none in which quantum foundational issues continually arise. One reason\nfor current interest is the hope of building quantum computers that\nare capable, assuming they can be made to work properly, of carrying\nout certain information-processing tasks faster and more efficiently\nthan is possible using ordinary classical computers. To be sure, if\nthe entire world is quantum mechanical then our current\n“classical” computers must in some real sense be quantum\ncomputers. So what is the difference? At least to a first\napproximation, classical computation is that kind where a single\nquasiclassical framework, section 6, suffices\nfor describing the carriers of information (e.g., on-off states of\ntransistors) and the way information is processed, whereas quantum\ncomputation is what cannot be so described. Further clarifying this\ndistinction is one of the tasks of quantum information theory. Classical information theory as developed by Shannon and his\nsuccessors employs standard (Kolmogorov) probability theory. The\nhistories approach to quantum mechanics also uses standard probability\ntheory, and thus it is plausible that as long as one sticks to a\nsingle quantum framework, both the mathematical structure and the\nintuition associated with classical information theory can be directly\ntranslated into the quantum domain. This is indeed the case, and such\na quantum framework is not limited to quasiclassical states; it can\nalso include microscopic quantum states. This makes it possible for the histories approach to answer two\nquestions raised by J. S. Bell (1990) as\nobjections to using information theory to address foundational issues\nin quantum mechanics: “Whose information? Information\nabout what?” The answers in reverse order: information\nis always about quantum properties or, more generally,\nproperties at different times, thus histories. And it is\npossessed by someone who, like Alice\nin subsection 8.1, can build a reliable\npiece of apparatus and interpret the (macroscopic) outcome by applying\nconsistent quantum principles. Not all problems in quantum information can be simply and\nimmediately mapped in a useful way onto a single framework, and those\nthat cannot are what make quantum information an interesting, as well\nas a rather difficult, field of research. Note that the single\nframework rule forbids combining incompatible frameworks, but\nallows one to compare them or work out relationships that hold between\nresults in different frameworks. Therefore one can say that, at least\nin some general sense, problems at the frontiers of quantum\ninformation theory have to do with comparisons of incompatible\nframeworks. See the \n Further Reading supplement for additional discussions of these\nissues.\n\n In summary, the histories approach provides a consistent conceptual\nframework for the full scope of quantum information theory, including\nclassical (Shannon) information as a special case. The histories approach resolves, or one might say\n“tames”, all the usual quantum paradoxes in the sense of\nproviding a clear explanation of why certain results which seem\npeculiar from the perspective of classical physics are perfectly\nconsistent with quantum theory, and can thus serve as useful\nillustrations of its basic principles. As the explanations have for\nthe most part already been published, what is found below is mostly\njust a few comments along with references. The paradox of Schrödinger (1935)’s\ncat is a particularly striking way of stating the unresolved\ndifficulties associated with the first measurement problem in standard\n(i.e., textbook) quantum mechanics. It corresponds to using the\nframework \\(\\FC_u\\), \\eqref{eqn21} in subsection 7.2,\nwith \\(\\ket{\\Psi_2}\\) the superposition of dead and live cat states. The\nhistories approach addresses this paradox by first noting that there\nis nothing wrong from the point of view of fundamental quantum theory\n(principle R2 of subsection 5.1) with using\n\\(\\FC_u\\), but it is a serious misunderstanding to suppose that\n\\(\\ket{\\Psi_2}\\) or the corresponding property \\([\\Psi_2]\\) represents a\ncat which is both dead and alive. First, the projectors, let us call\nthem \\(P_d\\) and \\(P_a\\), that correspond to the cat being dead and alive\ndo not commute with \\([\\Psi_2]\\), so they cannot, by the single\nframework rule, be brought into the discussion (and, indeed, it is\ndoubtful that any projector associated with what one might call\n“catness” will commute with \\([\\Psi_2]\\)). Second, since\n\\(P_d P_a=0\\) (distinct macroscopic states) \nboth properties cannot be true simultaneously, so it is false to say that the cat is\nboth dead and alive. In addition the historian may\nremark that the existence of other frameworks in no way invalidates a\ndiscussion based on the quasiclassical one that lies behind the\nordinary language discussion of cats, which is distinguished by its\nutility and not by some framework selection rule,\nsee subsection 11.3. In this case a useful\nframework is the counterpart of \\(\\FC_1\\), \\eqref{eqn22}\nin subsection 7.2, with quasiclassical projectors\n\\(P_d\\) and \\(P_a\\) at time \\(t_2\\), and \\(\\ket{\\Psi_2}\\) understood not as a\nproperty but as a pre-probability useful for assigning probabilities\nthat the cat is dead or alive. At this point the paradox has\ndisappeared. A similar but somewhat more complex analysis can be applied\nto Wigner (1961)’s friend; the solution\nis to use an appropriate framework. The best known of the interference paradoxes is the double\nslit. How can successive quantum particles passing through the slit\nsystem and later detected at specific points in the interference zone\nbuild up a pattern showing interference of a sort that depends on the\nseparation of the slits, even though measurements carried out directly\nbehind the slits will show that the particle passed through one or the\nother, but not both? Feynman’s\ndiscussion (Feynman, Leighton, & Sands\n1965: Chapter 1, where two holes replace the two slits) is\nsuperb. What is essentially the same paradox, but in a form somewhat\neasier to analyze, is the one in which a particle passes through the\ntwo arms of Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Chapter 13\nof Griffiths (2002a) provides an\nextensive discussion of how the histories approach deals with\ndifferent possibilities in a consistent way that avoids paradoxes\nwhile producing analogs of all the interesting effects discussed by\nFeynman. The Bell-Kochen-Specker family of\nparadoxes (Bell 1966; Kochen & Specker\n1967) are based on a relatively simple idea, although its\nexecution is sometimes complicated: if one chains together a\nsufficient number of incompatible frameworks it is possible to arrive\nat a logical contradiction. The chaining consists in finding a\nprojector which belongs to two (or more) incompatible decompositions\nof the identity, and then assuming it has the same truth value in both\nframeworks, whereas in any single decomposition one and only one\nprojector is true. The histories approach blocks paradoxes of this\nsort because they (obviously) violate the single framework rule. See\nthe Further Reading supplement for details.\n\n The three-box paradox of Aharonov &\nVaidman (1991) is similar to Bell-Kochen-Specker, except that\nin this case quantum dynamics is involved, and the issue has to do\nwith incommensurate families of histories (combining them violates the\nconsistency conditions) rather than incompatible sample spaces. Again,\nthe histories resolution of the paradox, Sec. 22.5\nof Griffiths (2002a), consists in\napplying the single framework rule: a contradiction can only be\nreached by violating quantum rules of reasoning. In the histories approach the rule governing counterfactual\nreasoning, as indicated in subsection 5.2, is\nthat a single framework must be used for comparing the actual and\ncounterfactual world. Counterfactual paradoxes are constructed by\nignoring this rule. One of the best known is\nWheeler’s (1978) delayed choice paradox\nin which in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer the second beam splitter is\nor is not removed at a time when the quantum particle (or wave) has\nalready passed the first beam splitter, so the particle is already\nphysically present inside the interferometer. With the second beam\nsplitter absent one can determine the arm through which the particle\npassed, whereas the interference exhibited when the beam splitter is\npresent shows that the particle cannot have been in a particular\narm. \n\nThere are several other paradoxes which hinge upon the\n(incorrect) use of counterfactuals, or at least include a\ncounterfactual element in the way they are stated. Among these\nare Hardy (1992)’s paradox\n\nand the somewhat similar Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\nparadox (Greenberger, Horne, Shimony, &\nZeilinger 1990; Greenberger, Horne, & Zeilinger 1989). \nFor comments on how the histories approach deals with these and \nsimilar paradoxes, see the \n Further Reading supplement.\n\n As discussed in section 8, the Bohm (spin\nsinglet) version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox has been\ninterpreted, by Bell and others, as indicating that quantum theory is\nnonlocal. Similar conclusions have been drawn from the Hardy and the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger paradoxes stated in a form which involves\nmeasurements at distinct physical locations. One can add to this list\nthe Elitzur-Vaidman indirect measurement\nparadox (Elitzur & Vaidman 1993),\nwhich again suggests some form of nonlocal influence. When critically\nexamined using the tools provided by the histories interpretation all\nevidence for nonlocality vanishes, for reasons discussed in\nsubsection 8.2.\n\n Any physical theory can give rise to various kinds of conceptual\ndifficulty. Problems may arise because of lack of familiarity with, or\nmisunderstanding of, new ideas. Most students upon their first\nencounter with calculus or with special relativity have difficulties\nof this sort, which can be cleared up by additional study, working\nthrough examples, and the like. In addition theories may be internally\ninconsistent. This is often the case when they are relatively new and\nunder development, but can also be true of more mature\ntheories. Indeed certain theories turn out to be of great usefulness\ndespite the fact that they contain serious flaws or\ninconsistencies. (Standard, which is to say textbook, quantum\nmechanics is a prime example!) And even theories which are properly\nunderstood and are internally consistent can be rejected, either by\nindividual scientists or the community as a whole, because they are\nnot “good physics”, a term whose importance should not be\nunderestimated even if it cannot be given a precise definition. The\nhistories interpretation of quantum theory has given rise to\nconceptual difficulties that fall in all of these areas, and while it\nis impossible in a few words to discuss each of them in detail, the\nfollowing remarks are intended to indicate the general nature of some\nof the more serious issues raised by critics, along with responses\nmade by advocates of the histories approach. \n\n The issue of internal consistency has been raised\nby Kent (1997) and\nby Bassi & Ghirardi (1999, 2000) on\nthe grounds that the rules for reasoning using histories, summarized\nin section 5, lead to contradictions: certain\nassumptions allow one to derive both a proposition and its\ncontradiction. Equivalently, a quantum property can be assigned, on\nthe basis of the same initial data, probabilities of both 0 and\n1. These criticisms have been answered\nin Griffiths & Hartle (1998) and in \nGriffiths (2000a, 2000b).\nIn addition there is a general argument for the\nconsistency of the histories approach in Ch. 16\nof Griffiths (2002a). The key point,\neasily overlooked as it has no close analogy in classical physics, is\nthe single framework rule R3 of section 5. In\nsituations that involve quantum properties at a single time the use of\na single framework means the use of a particular projective\ndecomposition of the identity and the associated Boolean event\nalgebra. When reasoning is restricted to this algebra the usual rules\nof propositional logic apply, so an inconsistency at this level would\nimply the inconsistency of standard logic. If the framework in\nquestion consists of a family of histories of a closed system, it\ncannot be assigned probabilities using the extended Born\nrule, subsection 4.2, unless the consistency\nconditions are satisfied. But in those cases where probabilities can\nbe assigned they satisfy the usual rules of probabilistic reasoning,\nthus ruling out contradictions. The single framework rule itself lies at the center of a large\nnumber of objections to the histories approach, which is hardly\nsurprising since in an important sense it marks the boundary between\nclassical and quantum physics. As it is absent from classical physics\nand from most quantum textbooks, the concept is unfamiliar, and one\nhas to work through various examples in order to gain an intuitive as\nwell as a formal understanding of how it deals with the various\nparadoxes and other conceptual difficulties of quantum theory. The\nfour principles R1 to R4 found in subsection 5.1\nshould help in understanding how frameworks should be thought of and\nhow they should be used. It is of particular importance that the\nsingle framework rule does not imply that there is only one\nway available to the physicist to think about or discuss a particular\nsituation. What it forbids is not the construction of many, perhaps\nmutually incompatible, frameworks, but combining them in the\nfashion characteristic of the incompatibility paradoxes discussed\nabove in subsection 10.3. Indeed, the single\nframework rule rather than being a restriction actually extends the\nLiberty of the theoretical physicist to describe the quantum world in\na consistent way without the danger of running into insoluble\nparadoxes. But Liberty is coupled to a denial of the unicity of the\nworld, subsection 11.4, which is perhaps the most\nimportant philosophical implication of quantum mechanics from the\nhistories perspective, as well as the principal stumbling block in the\nway of a wider acceptance of that approach as a satisfactory\ninterpretation of quantum theory. An objection first raised by Dowker &\nKent (1996), and subsequently repeated by \nKent (1998),\nSchlosshauer (2004),\nand Wallace (2008), among others, is that\nquasiclassical frameworks are by no means the only possible consistent families\nof histories in a closed quantum system.  In particular, one can have\nconsistent families in which there is quasiclassical behavior up to some time\nfollowed by something which is not at all quasiclassical at a later time.  This\nwould be a serious objection if historians were claiming that there must be a\nunique family of histories which can be used to describe the world, but such is\nnot the case.  The physicist is at Liberty to choose a family whose histories\nclosely resemble those of classical mechanics, and the existence of alternative\nframeworks in no way diminishes the validity of such a quasiclassical\ndescription, for reasons indicated in section 4.2 of Griffiths (2013).\nOne senses that underlying such criticisms is the expectation that any good\nphysical theory must satisfy the principle of unicity, to which\nwe now turn. In a probabilistic theory the limiting cases of a probability equal\nto 1 or 0 are equivalent to asserting that the corresponding\nproposition (e.g., “the system has property \\(P\\)”) is,\nrespectively, true or false. In the histories approach probabilities\nare linked to frameworks, and for this reason the notions of\n“true” and “false” are also framework\ndependent. This cannot lead to inconsistencies, a proposition being\nboth true and false, because of the single framework rule. But it is\ncontrary to a deeply rooted faith or intuition, shared by\nphilosophers, physicists, and the proverbial man in the street, that\nat any point in time there is one and only one state of the universe\nwhich is “true”, and with which every true statement about\nthe world must be consistent. In Sec. 27.3\nof Griffiths (2002a) this belief is\nreferred to as unicity, and it is what must be abandoned if\nthe histories interpretation of quantum theory is on the right\ntrack. As an example, consider the measurement model\nin subsection 7.2, where in the family \\(\\FC_u\\) at\ntime \\(t_2\\) the measurement apparatus is in a superposition state\ncorresponding to a projector which is incompatible with the projectors\nrepresenting different pointer positions, which are employed in the\nfamily \\(\\FC_1\\). The histories approach says the physicist is at\nLiberty to employ either family, both of which are valid ways of\ndescribing the quantum world, but Incompatibility forbids combining\nthem into a single description. The prohibition on combining families\nis based on the fact that certain quantum projectors do not commute,\nsomething quite specific to quantum mechanics with no classical\ncounterpart. In classical mechanics the true state of affairs for a\nphysical system is always represented by a single point in the phase\nspace. It is this feature that has to be abandoned in quantum\nmechanics interpreted using histories. See the \nFurther Reading supplement for additional\ndetails.\n\n Abandoning unicity is certainly a radical proposal, comparable in\nthe history of science to the radical step our intellectual ancestors\ntook when they replaced the centuries old notion of an immovable earth\nwith the modern concept of a spinning planet in motion around the\nsun. In making that transition it was important to develop an\nunderstanding of why the earlier ideas worked so well; e.g., why one\ndid not feel the earth was moving. By analogy it is helpful to note,\nas discussed in section 6, that from a quantum\nperspective the macroscopic world of everyday experience can be\nunderstood for all, or almost all, practical purposes using a single\nquasiclassical framework. Within that framework the principle of\nunicity holds, and one can thus understand why it was quite\nsatisfactory before the quantum revolution, and remains so in sciences\nwhere specific quantum effects do not need to be taken into\naccount.
