The study of justice has been concerned with what we owe one\nanother, what obligations we might have to treat each other fairly in\na range of domains, including over distributive and recognitional\nmatters. Contemporary political philosophers had focused their\ntheorizing about justice almost exclusively within the state, but the\nlast twenty years or so has seen a marked extension to the global\nsphere, with a huge expansion in the array of topics covered. While\nsome, such as matters of just conduct in war, have long been of\nconcern, others are more recent and arise especially in the context of\ncontemporary phenomena like intensified globalization, economic\nintegration and potentially catastrophic anthropogenic climate\nchange.\n\n\n\nJohn Rawls’s Law of Peoples was an especially important\nwork and greatly stimulated thinking about different models of global\njustice (Rawls 1999). Several questions soon became prominent in\ndiscussions including: What principles should guide international\naction? What responsibilities do we have to the global poor? Should\nglobal inequality be morally troubling? Are there types of non-liberal\npeople who should be tolerated? What kind of foreign policy is\nconsistent with liberal values? Is a “realistic utopia”\npossible in the global domain? How might we transition effectively\ntowards a less unjust world?\n\n\n\nContemporary events also played an enormous role in prompting\nphilosophical inquiries. Prominent cases of genocide, ethnic\ncleansing, forms of terrorism uncommon prior to 2001, intensified\ninterest in immigration to affluent developed countries, increased\ndependence on the labor of those from poor developing countries, and\nenormous threats to well-being, security and the environment became\ncommon catalysts for further work. Philosophers began to reflect on\nquestions such as: Is it ever permissible to engage in coercive\nmilitary action for humanitarian purposes, such as to halt genocide or\nprevent large-scale violations of human rights? Can terrorism ever be\njustified? Should affluent developed countries open their borders more\ngenerously than they currently do to those from poor developing\ncountries who would like to immigrate to them? Are our current global\neconomic arrangements fair ones and if not, how should they be\ntransformed? What responsibilities do we have to one another in a\nglobalized, post-Westphalian world order? How should we allocate\nresponsibilities for reducing global injustice in our world, such as\nin the case of distributing costs associated with addressing climate\nchange?\n\n\n\nIncreased interest concerning issues of global justice has also\ncoincided with enhanced interest in the place and value of\nnationalism. These explorations also track contemporary events such as\nnationalist clashes which have spilled over into widespread suffering\n(notably in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda), increased calls for\nnational self-determination to carry considerable weight, such as in\nstate recognition for Palestinians or Tibetans, and also in the case\nof secession (prominently, Quebec). In this area global justice\ntheorists have been concerned with a range of important questions such\nas: Under what conditions should claims to national self-determination\nbe granted substantial weight? When should self-determination yield to\nconcern for protecting human rights? Are commitments to nationalism\nand global justice compatible? Is genuine democracy only possible at\nthe state level or are there robust forms of democracy that are\npossible in more international fora? How are ideals of democracy best\nincorporated into defensible global institutional arrangements? Is\nworld justice possible without a world state? \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this article is to give an orientation to the\nenormous and rapidly expanding field of global justice. There are\nseveral entries in this encyclopedia that already cover some of the\ncore topics well and these will be cross-referenced. But there are\nstill many important gaps, along with some missing context as to how\nsome topics fits together. This entry aims primarily to address these\nneeds.\n\n\n\nA distinction is often drawn between global and international\njustice. The key point of difference between these two notions\ninvolves clarifying the entities among which justice is sought. In\ninternational justice the nation or state is taken as the central\nentity of concern and justice among nations or states is the focus. In\nthe domain of global justice, by contrast, theorists do not seek\nprimarily to define justice between states or nations. Rather\nthey drill down through the state shell and inquire about what justice\namong human beings consists in. Global justice inquiries take\nindividual human beings as of primary concern and seek to give an\naccount of what fairness among such agents involves. There are a range\nof actions that cut across states or involve different agents,\nrelationships, and structures that might be invisible in an inquiry\nseeking justice among states exclusively. Many different kinds of\ninteractions are not circumscribed by state membership and yet can\nimportantly affect human beings’ most fundamental interests, so\nasking the question about what individual human beings owe one another\noften uncovers significant neglected features of relationships and\nstructures that are of normative concern. Global justice analyses are\nnot precluded from yielding state-level obligations; indeed, they\ntypically do. However, they consider a wider array of possible agents\nand organizations that might have duties as well. \n\nThere are advantages associated with both types of inquiries. An\nimportant advantage of asking what states owe one another is that much\ninternational law presupposes the states system and requires states to\nperform various actions to promote justice. In this way,\nresponsibilities often appear to be clearly allocated to particular\nparties thus making it quite precise who ought to do what in our\nactual world. One advantage of global justice inquiries is that we are\nnot forced to take states as a fixed constraint and we can therefore\nconsider a range of relevant relationships, capacities and roles that\nalso structure our interactions and might be relevant to how we ought\nto conceptualize global responsibilities. While asking about what\nindividuals owe each other may well have implications for states and\ntheir obligations, a range of other agents and institutions may also\nhave relevant justice obligations. These responsibilities can become\nmore visible when we explore what individuals owe each other. The two\napproaches have different strengths and can complement each other, but\nin contemporary debate they are often taken as rivals competing to\nprovide the most plausible framework. \n\nSince there is already an entry in this encyclopedia that focuses on\n international justice (see the entry  on \n international distributive justice),\n this entry will focus on the area of global justice. \n\nIn general, a theory of global justice aims to give us an account of\nwhat justice on a global scale consists in and this often includes\ndiscussion of the following components: \n\nTheories of global justice aim to help us understand our world\nbetter and what our responsibilities are in it. While some\ntheorists aim purely at theoretical understanding, others hope also to\nprovide an analysis that can be useful in practical policy making\nconcerning global justice matters. \n\nA problem is often considered to constitute a global justice problem\nwhen one (or more) of the following conditions obtain: \n\nSo, in general, a problem is one of global justice when the problem\neither affects agents resident in more than one state or the problem is\nunresolvable without their co-operation. For the problem to be\nconsidered genuinely global rather than regional it should affect more\nthan one regional area.  \n\nWhat sorts of duties of justice, if any, exist among human beings\nwho do not reside in the same country? If there are such duties, what\ngrounds them? Some argue that John Rawls’s principles developed\nfor the case of domestic justice, notably, the Fair Equality of\nOpportunity Principle or the Difference Principle, should apply\nglobally (Caney 2005, Moellendorf 2002). Others maintain that the\ncontent of our duties to one another is best explored by examining\nalternative concepts not featured in the Rawlsian corpus, such as\ncapabilities or human rights (Nussbaum 2006, Pogge 2008). \n\nMuch discussion about what we owe one another in the global context is\ninfluenced by the work of John Rawls, so a short synopsis is needed to\nsituate debates. Since discussion of these issues is amply\n covered in the entries on\n international distributive justice\n and on \n John Rawls,\n this will be a compressed\nsummary focusing only on the most central aspects of the debate that\nhave a bearing on core topics of global justice. \n\nIn The Law of Peoples, John Rawls argues for eight\nprinciples that he believes should regulate international interactions\nof peoples. For Rawls, a “people” is constituted by a\ngroup of persons who have in common sufficient characteristics such as\nculture, history, tradition, or sentiment. Rawls uses the term\n“people” in ways that relevantly correspond with how many\nuse the term “nation”. In addition, Rawls often\nassumes that, for the most part, each people has a state. \n\nThe eight principles Rawls endorses acknowledge peoples’\nindependence and equality, that peoples have the right to\nself-determination along with having duties of non-intervention, that\nthey ought to observe treaties, honor a particular list of human\nrights, should conduct themselves in certain appropriate ways if they\nengage in warfare, and that they have duties to assist other peoples in\nestablishing institutions to enable people’s self-determination.\nHe also advocates for international institutions governing trade,\nborrowing, and other international matters that are characteristically\ndealt with by the United Nations. \n\nSeveral claims have been the subject of much debate between critics\nand defenders of Rawls’s position. In particular, Rawls believes\nthat so long as all peoples have a set of institutions that enable\ncitizens to lead decent lives, any global inequality that might remain\nis not morally troubling. Critics draw attention to the ways in which\nglobal inequality—perhaps in levels of power or\naffluence—can convert into opportunities for deprivation and\ndisadvantage. For instance, the global advantaged can use their\nsuperior position to influence the rules that govern international\ninstitutions—such as trade practices—which can facilitate\nfurther opportunities for increased advantage and so they can indeed\nthreaten the abilities of others in distant lands to lead decent lives\n (Pogge\n 2008).[1] \n\nAnother important issue that underlies debate between Rawls and his\ncritics concerns different views about the nature and origins of\nprosperity. Rawls gives a particularly strong statement of what he\ntakes the causes of prosperity to be. He claims that the causes of the\nwealth of a people can be traced to the domestic political culture,\nthe virtues and vices of leaders, and the quality of domestic\ninstitutions. He says:  \n\nCritics observe that in addition to local factors there are also\ninternational ones which play an important role in prospects for\nwell-being. Thomas Pogge prominently helps bring some of these into\nview. International institutions, such as the International Borrowing\nand Resource Privileges, are good examples of the ways in which\ninternational institutions can have profound effects on domestic\nfactors which undeniably also play a role in promoting\nprosperity. According to the international borrowing privilege,\ngovernments may borrow amounts of money on behalf of the country and\nthe country thereby incurs an obligation to repay the debt. The\ninternational resource privilege refers to a government’s\nability to do what it likes with resources, including sell them to\nwhomsoever it chooses to and at what price. Any group that exercises\neffective power in a state is internationally recognized as the\nlegitimate government of that territory and enjoys the two\nprivileges. But, Pogge argues, this sets up undesirable incentives\nthat hamper developing countries’ abilities to flourish. These\ninclude incentivizing those strongly motivated to hold office for\nmaterial gain to take power by force or exercise it in oppressive ways\nthat help reinforce oppressive governments’ abilities to retain\ncontrol. The global advantaged benefit greatly from these privileges\nand so have little incentive to reform them. But, according to Pogge,\nreforms are sorely needed.  If only sufficiently legitimate\ngovernments are able to enjoy these privileges, the international\ncommunity would remove one important obstacle developing countries\ncurrently face. \n\nDefenders of Rawls’s views argue that his position is more\ncomplex than is commonly acknowledged and allows for both a principled\nstance on some fundamental values along with appropriate openness to\nalternative ways in which legitimate and decent peoples might organize\ntheir collective lives (Reidy 2004, Freeman 2006). They argue that\nRawls’s position shows great sensitivity to a number of factors\nthat must be weighed in considering right conduct in international\naffairs. For instance, when Rawls makes his bold claims about the\ncauses of wealth it is useful to bear in mind the context in which he\nis arguing. Against an assumption that resources are enormously\nimportant for a society’s ability to flourish, Rawls emphasizes\nthe importance of strong institutions, political culture and other\nlocal factors, in sustaining decent lives for citizens.  Rawls also\nreflects on the difficulty of changing political culture, noting that\nsimply transferring resources will not help.  Interestingly, in a\nlittle discussed passage, Rawls ventures that an “emphasis on\nhuman rights may work to change ineffective regimes and the conduct of\nrulers who have been callous about the well-being of their own\npeople” (Rawls 1999, p. 109). For more on whether Rawls provides\nus with a cogent model that can provide sage guidance in international\n matters see the entry on\n international distributive justice\n and the entry on \n John Rawls.\n See also Martin and\nReidy (2006). For the purposes of this entry we need only summarize\nsome key questions that were influential in setting the terms of\ndiscussion about global justice for some time. \n\nSome key questions are: \n\nI trace some of the influential positions that have shaped answers\nto these questions next. \n\nOne of the most visible and large-scale contemporary global justice\nproblems we face is that of global poverty. What ought we to do for\nthe 1 billion or so people who currently live in poverty? (This is a\n huge area nicely canvassed in the entry on \n international distributive justice.)\n A few seminal arguments deserve mention\nhere as well, however. In a classic argument Peter Singer describes a\nso-called easy rescue case in which an infant is drowning in a shallow\npond. You happen by and can save the child with minimal effort and\ninconvenience on your part. Singer argues that you would be obligated\nto assist using the principle that when it is in our power to prevent\nsomething bad from happening without sacrificing anything comparable,\nit is wrong not to prevent the bad from occurring. Reflecting on this\nprinciple Singer argues that it entails extensive duties to assist\nneedy others, whether they be geographically proximate or not. We have\nextensive duties to assist the global poor who, with equally minimal\neffort on our part, can be saved from dire circumstances, since the\nsame principle applies in both cases (Singer 1972, and for more\ntreatment Unger 1996). \n\nAnother enormously influential contribution is that of Thomas Pogge\nwho argues that since developed countries impose a coercive global\norder on the poor that foreseeably and avoidably causes great harm,\nthey have important responsibilities to reform the global order such\nthat it ceases to do so and instead better secures human rights (Pogge\n2002, 2008, 2010). We harm the global poor when we collaborate in\nimposing an unjust global institutional order on them and, moreover,\nthat order is unjust when it foreseeably perpetuates large-scale human\nrights deficits that can reasonably be avoided were we to make quite\nfeasible institutional modifications (Pogge 2002, 2008, 2010). While\nSinger emphasizes our capacity to assist with need\nsatisfaction, Pogge emphasizes instead our contributions to\nthe problem as grounding our duties. \n\nWhen discussing our duties to one another there is also vigorous\ndebate about what the content and target of our duties should be,\nalong with discussion about what are the best ways to discharge\nthese. Traditional dominant economic approaches to promoting\nprosperity have focused on raising income levels or increasing Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP). Railing against such approaches, Amartya Sen\nsuggested that the capabilities approach provides an improved measure\nof well-being and constitutes a better way to capture changes in\npeople’s condition over time (Sen 1980). Exploring what people\nare able to do and be provides a more appropriate standard by which to\nevaluate whether their condition has improved rather than focusing\nexclusively on their incomes or per capita GDP. Martha Nussbaum\ndevelops this approach and argues for a list of ten capabilities that\nshould be secured for all people in all places.  This universal list\ncan provide an important tool in persuading governments to make\n reforms conducive to their citizens’ flourishing. (See the entry on\n the capability approach\n for more.)  What constitutes well-being and the\nbest ways to measure it is an enormous topic both in Philosophy and in\n adjacent disciplines. For a good introduction see the entry\n well-being.\n Another important discourse for discussing these\ntopics is that of human rights which is discussed in Section 2.4\nbelow. \n\nWhen considering what we owe one another, are compatriots special? Do\nwe have the same duties to non-compatriots as we have to compatriots\nor is there some principled way in which these two sets of duties\nought to differ? \n\nNationalists argue that we belong to national communities and any\naccount of our global responsibilities that ignores this omits an\nimportant aspect of how we relate—and ought to relate—to\none another. They argue that nations can provide a valuable grounding\nfor social attachment, identity and meaning in life, and can ground\nspecial obligations to strengthen national life and assist\nco-nationals. Others defend the value of nationalism on instrumental\ngrounds; there is nothing inherently special about our co-national\nrelationships but state boundaries are useful in assigning important\nduties to particular agents (Goodin 1998). In a world of great unmet\nneed, paying special attention to one’s co-nationals can be\njustified\n (Goodin\n 1998).[2] \n\nIn the words of Diogenes, widely credited as the first person to\npropound cosmopolitan views, cosmopolitans see themselves as\n“citizens of the world”. Contemporary cosmopolitans\ntypically hold that every human being has standing as an ultimate unit\nof moral concern and is entitled to equal consideration of her\ninterests no matter what other affiliations, especially national\naffiliations, she might have. Drawing on the idea that we all\nhave equal moral worth, cosmopolitans seek to broaden our moral\nhorizons so that we do not forget about the responsibilities we have to\nothers beyond state borders, even when we have local responsibilities\nas well. \n\nThere are two particularly prominent contemporary accounts of\ncosmopolitanism. Martha Nussbaum emphasizes that, as human\nbeings, we belong to a global community of human persons (Nussbaum\n1996). Nussbaum argues that while love for one’s country\nmight have a legitimate place in people’s conceptions of a good\nlife, we should not overlook the many other relationships we are in\nwhich connect us to others in the world. We need to draw the\nglobal community in closer to the local one, and, more generally, aim\nto see ourselves as members of overlapping communities which also have\nimportant claims on us. \n\nThomas Pogge offers an enormously influential account that focuses\non the implications of cosmopolitanism for the global institutional\norder. We need to ensure that global institutional structures\ngive equal consideration to everyone’s interests. He says,\n“Insofar as human agents are involved in the design or\nadministration of global rules, practices, or organizations, they ought\nto disregard their private and local, including national, commitments\nand loyalties to give equal consideration to the needs and interests of\nevery human being on this planet” (Pogge 2013, 298). This\nequal-consideration-of-interests requirement only applies to such\ncontexts. While such impartiality norms are perfectly familiar\nwithin the state, for instance, when judges operate in law courts, we\nhave yet to realize the requirement at the global level. \n\nIt is often assumed that cosmopolitanism must necessarily be in\ntension with more local attachments to friends, family or\ncompatriots. Some cosmopolitans believe such conflict is\ninevitable and a necessary part of understanding what cosmopolitanism\nentails but that this implication is unproblematic (Ypi 2013). \nOthers argue for different ways in which the apparent tensions could be\nresolved (Pogge 2013, Tan 2004). As we see above, Pogge\nemphasizes the clear separation of spheres in which equal consideration\nof people’s interests applies. Kok-Chor Tan also offers a\nsimilar argument. His strategy is to show that cosmopolitan principles\nshould govern global institutional structures that ensure people are\ntreated as equals in their entitlements (Tan 2004). When this is\nthe case there can be a legitimate role for patriotism that operates\nwithin such constraints. Partiality to co-nationals need not\nconflict with cosmopolitan obligations. Another notable strategy\nis to argue that we cannot achieve justice at a national level unless\nwe attend to justice at a global level. On this view, we have at\nleast instrumental reasons to care about global justice, even if we\ncare deeply about social justice in our nation (Banai, Ronzoni and\nSchemmel 2011, Ronzoni 2013). \n\nThere is an important debate among egalitarian theorists about\nwhether our concern with equality should be confined to members of the\nsame state or whether it should extend to all globally. Some\ntheorists argue that careful consideration of notions such as\nreciprocity, coercion, or fair terms of co-operation mandate that we\ngive special weighting to the interests of compatriots. Others,\nby contrast, argue that these concerns, when properly understood, point\nin the direction of equally strong duties to non-compatriots. One\nform of the argument that we have special duties to compatriots that\nare not shared with non-compatriots, draws on the coercive legal\nstructure that applies within states and claims that such coercive\nstructures do not apply outside of them (R. Miller 1998, Blake\n2001). Another highly influential version claims that there is a\ndifference in the authority to enforce justice within and outside the\nstate (Nagel 2005). There are many important challenges to such\npositions. One important line of argument maintains that coercion\nis indeed relevant in triggering duties of egalitarian justice, but\nsince this is rampant at the global level it activates global not just\nnational egalitarian duties (Cohen and Sabel 2006, Abizadeh\n2007). In addition, some argue that the same ingredients Nagel\nidentifies as crucial in generating state authority exist at the global\n level as well (Cohen and Sabel 2006). See the entry on\n  international distributive justice\n for more on these issues. For\ncomprehensive treatment of nationalism and cosmopolitanism see the\n entries on\n nationalism  \n and on\n cosmopolitanism, \n respectively. \n\nDiscussion of global justice matters often invokes concern for human\nrights. In fact, for all their differences, both nationalists and\ncosmopolitans frequently agree that a good way to think about some of\nour duties to one another is via human rights. Human rights can and\ndoes therefore serve as an important discourse for furthering\ndiscussion about our global responsibilities. \n\nRespecting human rights is an important requirement in much\ninternational law and can be a key criterion in evaluating whether\ngovernments are considered legitimate by the international\ncommunity. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is\na highly influential account of all human beings’ basic\nentitlements and this document often plays an important role in real\nworld debates about justice matters. See the comprehensive entry on\n human rights for more detail. Here I\nhave space to discuss only two issues that have been prominent in\ndebates about global justice. \n\nThe first concerns the kinds of duties we have in relation to human\nrights. Against a conventional view widespread before 1980, Henry Shue\nargues that if rights to physical security are basic, so are rights to\nsubsistence (Shue 1980). A careful analysis of the duties associated\nwith human rights indicates that the commonly held distinction between\npositive and negative duties cannot be maintained. All rights have a\nrange of both positive and negative duties associated with them. \n\nThomas Pogge offers an enormously influential account of duties with\nrespect to human rights. Our current global order perpetuates\nglobal poverty on a massive scale, but since feasible reforms to that\norder could avert this harm, our failure to make reforms not only\nimplicates us in the misery but also in the violation of the rights of\n the\n poor.[3] \n We therefore\nhave extensive obligations to reform our global order so that the\nrights of the poor can be fulfilled. \n\nFor more treatment of issues, especially concerning what human rights\nare, which rights are rightly construed as human rights, and how human\nrights function in international law, see the entry \n  human rights. \n\nWithin the field of global justice, issues concerning war have one of\nthe longest histories. The just war framework has been influential in\nsetting the terms of much debate about the proper use of force in\ninternational affairs. Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas\noffered some of the earliest accounts of the criteria that should be\nmet for war to be justified. Two areas have been especially thoroughly\nstudied (1) the conditions under which entry into the war is justified\n(Jus Ad Bellum) and (2) the conditions for fair conduct\nwithin the war (Jus In Bello).  While having a just cause is\nstandardly held to be a necessary condition for a war to be justified,\nit is not sufficient. Theorists often disagree about which additional\nconditions must be satisfied for a war to be characterized as a just\nwar. The most common additional conditions proposed are that the war\nshould be undertaken by a proper authority, with the right intentions,\nwhen the war would follow requirements of proportionality (the ends to\nbe secured would warrant going to war), only as a last resort, and\nwhen there are reasonable prospects of success. On traditional\naccounts of just war theory all conditions must be met, but more\ncontemporary theorists challenge whether they are all necessary\n(Mellow 2006, Moellendorf 2002). \n\nOnce the fighting begins two central principles guide\nevaluation of whether the war is being conducted fairly: one which\nrespects the distinction between combatants and noncombatants (The\nPrinciple of Non-Combatant Immunity) and another that governs what\ncounts as the proportional use of force (Proportionality). On the\nfirst, it is not legitimate to use force against civilians and, even\nthough some collateral civilian damage may occur, it is wrong to\ndeliberately target non-combatants. On the second, combatants may\nonly use the force necessary to achieve their ends -- the force used\nmust be proportional to the ends that are to be secured in conducting\nthe war. There are further requirements governing fairness, such\nas requirements to comply with international laws and treat prisoners\nfairly, but the two featured principles are the most commonly invoked\nin normative analyses of Jus In Bello. \n\nThe third part of just war theory (Jus Post Bellum) concerns\nhow the war concludes and the transition back to a situation of\npeace. It deals with issues such as compensation, punishment, and\nreform.  More recently a further component has been suggested\nespecially in light of engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan in the\nyears 2001-2011, namely, justice in exiting the war (Jus Ex\nBello), which concerns when it is appropriate to end a war\n(Moellendorf 2008, Rodin 2008). \n\nThere are many contemporary global justice issues concerning the\nappropriate use of force and its aftermath that currently command\nattention including: Is drone warfare permissible? Can terrorism\never be justified? Are “targeted assassinations”\n(where leaders who are primarily responsible for decisions to go to war\nare targeted for assassination) justifiable? May we engage in a\nwar in order to prevent an anticipated “worse war” (as\nproponents of the “Bush Doctrine” maintain)? Is\ntorture to contain major global threats permissible? Is the\nattempt to contain nuclear weapons development by those who have them\nalready fraught with hypocrisy? How should we deal best with\nsocieties in a state of transitional justice? Is there a place\nfor “Truth and Reconciliation Committees”? When are\npolitical apologies for historic injustice in warfare\nappropriate?  \n\nHere we consider very briefly only two further issues that have\nwidespread current interest in the global justice literature:\nHumanitarian Intervention and Terrorism. See the entry on\n terrorism \nfor an extended analysis of such questions. \n  See the entry on \n war for a comprehensive overview of issues\nconcerning justice in war.  \n\nUnder what conditions, if any, may we engage in military\nintervention aimed at stopping genocide? In recent years this issue\nhas become salient as large-scale human rights violations and\nsuffering unfolded in Rwanda, the Sudan, the former Yugoslavia, and\nLibya. Against the traditional understanding that respecting state\nsovereignty requires non-interference, successful arguments were\nmarshaled that there are important responsibilities to protect the\nvulnerable (International Commission on Intervention and State\nSovereignty 2001). Leaning heavily on the conventional conditions\ncontained in the just war framework, the International Commission on\nIntervention and State Sovereignty argued that we may engage in war\naimed at protecting those who suffer at the hands of governments\nunwilling or unable to stop large-scale human rights abuses. The\ncommission produced an influential report “The Responsibility to\nProtect” which was accepted by the United Nations in 2005, and\nthe principles contained in the report have guided decisions about\nrecent cases, such as Libya in 2011 and Syria in 2012. \n\nOne frequently voiced concern about humanitarian interventions is\nwhether they are just another form of imperialism. How will\ninterveners be held accountable for their actions? Taking such\nconcerns seriously Allen Buchanan and Robert Keohane advocate for a\nseries of innovative mechanisms of accountability, both before and\nafter the proposed intervention takes place, to allay fears about\nabuse (Buchanan and Keohane 2004).  \n\nWhat kinds of violence count as terrorism? Is there a difference\nbetween state terrorism and that perpetrated by insurgent\norganizations? Might terrorism be justified under certain\ncircumstances? Terrorism centrally involves either using or\nthreatening to use violence against people, commonly taken to be\ninnocent, in order to produce results that would not otherwise occur\n(Coady and O’Keefe 2002, Primoratz 2013). Some challenge that\nthe targets are innocent. As terrorists often point out about citizen\ncomplicity in atrocities, citizens pay taxes and vote, and their\ngovernments undertake actions that they can be said to sanction and\nfrom which they benefit, so it is coherent to hold citizens\nresponsible for their governments’ actions. On this argument,\ncitizens can be legitimate targets of violence. In addition, there is\nrelevant precedent from governments targeting civilians when they\nperceive the situation to be one of a “supreme emergency”,\nas happened in the case of Britain targeting German civilians in the\nSecond World War. So when governments judge that some moral disaster\nis sufficiently likely, it can be repelled using unorthodox and\notherwise repugnant means.  \n\nPossibly the next most prominent global justice issue after\nconsiderations of proper use of force concerns the impact of, and\nresponsibilities created by, globalization. Globalization is a complex\nphenomenon with many facets. For our purposes we need note only some\nof its characteristic central features. These include (i) an\nincreasingly globally integrated economy, (ii) dominated by\ntransnational corporations engaged in activities (such as production\nand distribution) that span multiple countries, (iii) increasing\nregulation of economic matters by supranational institutions (such as\nthe World Trade Organization), (iv) general commitment to removal of\nbarriers to “free trade,” and (v) higher levels of\neconomic interdependence. While there is much debate about the\nlong-term effects of globalization and whether they are on balance\ngood or bad, at this stage, the effects of globalization have been\nmixed. For some, globalization has brought improvements, while it has\nworsened the position of others (Singer 2002). \n\nPhilosophers have been concerned with answers to a range of questions\nsuch as: What kinds of economic arrangements are just?  Should our\ninternational institutions be reformed to better reflect fair terms of\nco-operation in our globalized world? Can globalization be better\nmanaged so that it works to assist the global poor more effectively?\nAre protectionist policies in trade justified or, rather, is free\ntrade required by considerations of justice? Should poor working\nconditions in developing countries be a matter of concern for citizens\nand consumers in affluent, developed countries? If so, how might\nharmful employment conditions be effectively improved?  \n\nWhile Thomas Pogge argues that globalization has harmed the poor\non a massive scale, Mathias Risse argues that this is not at all clear\n(Pogge 2010, Risse 2005). Risse argues that in many ways the global\norder must be credited with benefiting the global poor as well. He\nchallenges Pogge’s claim that there are feasible alternatives to\nour global order that could be easily implemented and would avert the\nharm to which Pogge draws attention. \n\nThe World Trade Organization has been an important focal point for\ndiscussion about global economic justice. In particular, critics\nargue that some of its policies, such as those that generally advocate\nfree trade but allow protectionism in affluent developed countries,\ninvolve grave hypocrisy and unfairness to some of the world’s\nmost vulnerable people (Pogge 2001, Moellendorf 2002). There are\nalso large disparities in the resources at the disposal of various\nparties such that weaker parties often suffer huge disadvantages in\nbeing able to negotiate agreements that work well for them. In\nthese sorts of ways agents in developed countries (such as governments,\ncitizens or firms) can take unfair advantage of those in developing\ncountries (R. Miller 2010). \n\nMore generally, there are concerns related to the extraordinary\npower of multinationals and the undue influence they are able to\nexercise in negotiating deals favorable to them at the expense of the\ninterests of the most vulnerable. So-called sweatshops (in which\nworkers typically labor under harsh and hazardous conditions) are also\na frequently raised example of how western consumers are implicated in\nfar away suffering, given the high level of dependence in high-income\ncountries on labor from low-income ones. When we purchase\nproducts manufactured in sweatshops are we guilty of contributing to\nexploitation and if so, what ought we to do to mitigate these\nunfairnesses? Christian Barry and Sanjay Reddy offer an\ninnovative proposal to incentivize improvements in labor standards and\nwage levels in poor developing countries (Barry and Reddy 2008). \nThis “Just Linkage” proposal offers some additional\ndesirable opportunities for enhanced international trade to those who\nmeet higher standards. \n\nIn this domain philosophers have also examined a range of other issues\nincluding obligations to forgive odious debt (Barry, Herman and\nTomitova 2007) and whether micro-finance is to be welcomed as a\npositive force for the global poor (Sorrell and Cabrera, 2015).  Other\nmore general concerns about exploitation and economic justice can be\n found at the entries on\n exploitation\n and economics and economic justice.\n See also the entry on\n globalization.\n  \n\nThe effects of poverty do not fall equally on men and women, nor on\nboys and girls. In general, poverty makes the lives of women and girls\nharder than their male counterparts, as cultural expectations often\ndictate that women and girls do more care and domestic work or go\nwithout (or much less) when resources are scarce. This can\nsignificantly thwart women and girls’ well-being, as education,\nhealth care, and food are routinely withheld in favor of distribution\nto men and boys. Alison Jaggar prominently argues that various\nstructures create and recreate transnational gendered vulnerabilities\nand she illustrates with practices common in domestic work and the sex\nindustry (Jaggar 2009). \n\nCultural perceptions of gender roles can often lead to practices\nhighly damaging to the most fundamental interests of women and\ngirls. These include “honor killings” (where it is\nbelieved culturally permissible to kill a girl or woman who is\nperceived to have brought shame to the family), genital mutilation,\ninfanticide, forced prostitution, arranged marriage, and legal\nrecognition of property and inheritance rights that significantly\ndisadvantage women and girls. Poverty can exacerbate such\nvulnerabilities so we have further reasons to address it as a matter of\nurgency (Jaggar 2009, 2014). Martha Nussbaum has argued for a\nlist of ten capabilities that all human persons, no matter what their\ngender, ought to be positioned to exercise. She argues that this\napproach offers a powerful tool for persuasion in cases where girls and\nwomen are denied these opportunities by local actors in different\ncultures. \n\nSome important policy has been influential in international\ndiscourse concerning combating gender injustice. The Millennium\nDevelopment Goals includes as a third goal the promotion of gender\nequality and the empowerment of women. The 1995 Beijing Platform\nfor Action set the stage for several International Covenants and before\nthat the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination Against Women afforded some important protection for\nwomen’s human rights. Some feminist theorists are\nsuspicious of human rights language and are inclined to reject what\nthey perceive as a masculine discourse that trumpets individual\nautonomy in a way that fails to acknowledge adequately our fundamental\nhuman interdependence. While there certainly is a place for\ndiscussion of these important themes, others argue that we should not\nlose sight of the important victories human rights have also been able\nto secure, despite still having a long way to go (and other\nfailings). The rhetoric of human rights has enabled substantial\ngains for promoting gender equality and protection of women’s\nfundamental interests, so it has at least strategic value. \n\nThere are a large number of issues debated in the global justice\nliterature concerning migration, whether temporary, permanent, legal or\nillegal. These include: Should states have the right to control\ntheir borders? Even if they have such a right, should states be\nmore generous in admitting would-be migrants, especially considering\nthe facts about global disparities in life prospects? When\naffluent developed states refuse to open their borders to the\neconomically disadvantaged, is this equivalent to members of the\naristocracy unjustly protecting their privilege as was the case in\nfeudal times? What responsibilities are there to admit more\nrefugees? Can illegal immigration be justified under certain\ncircumstances? What sorts of criteria may affluent developed\ncountries use when selecting migrants from the pool of applicants for\ncitizenship? May they legitimately consider how prospective\nmigrants would fit in with current citizens, favoring certain\nreligious, linguistic, or ethnic affiliations to manage\ncompatibility? When making migrant selection decisions, should\nthey consider the effects on those who remain in countries of origin\nand if so, is this fair to the would-be migrants who would be excluded\non grounds of the alleged negative impacts for home country\ncitizens? If states admit migrant workers, are there moral\nconstraints on how they should be treated? Would admitting\ntemporary workers without simultaneously allowing them a pathway to\ncitizenship be unjust? What responsibilities do we have in\nrelation to human trafficking? \n\nThere are several now classic defenses of state’s rights to\ncontrol borders. David Miller (Miller 2005, 2007), Michael Walzer\n(Walzer 1983) and Christopher Wellman (Wellman and Cole 2011) have been\nparticularly important. Joseph Carens is the most influential\nproponent of the alternative “Open Borders” position\n(Carens 1987, 2013, but see also Cole 2000 and Wellman and Cole\n2011). While many theorists discuss the responsibilities to\nrefugees and guest workers, Walzer’s treatment is particularly\ninfluential, especially in arguing for his view that guest worker\nprograms are only justified when they offer such “guests” a\nproper pathway to full and equal citizenship (Walzer 1983). \nWellman offers comprehensive discussion of defensible admission\ncriteria (Wellman and Cole 2011). Whether brain drain issues\nshould be salient for migration decisions has been the subject of\nrecent discussion (Carens 2013, Oberman 2012, Brock and Blake\n2015). For detailed coverage of issues concerning whether borders\nshould be more or less open, what our obligations are to refugees or\nguest workers, and issues concerning the ethics of recruiting\n immigrants away from poor, developing countries, see the entry on\n immigration.\n  \n\nPatterns of human behavior that destroy habitats, accelerate species\nextinction, exacerbate toxic levels of pollution, contribute to ozone\nlayer destruction, or increase population levels are all issues of\nglobal environmental concern. However, although there are many\nglobal environmental topics that are rightly concerns of global\njustice, there is one that dominates discussion and that concerns our\nresponsibilities with respect to climate change. Here we focus\nexclusively on this issue. \n\nAmong the scientific community it is no longer controversial that\nanthropogenic climate change is real and a significant threat to the\nwell-being of both current and future generations. \nBut it is also widely acknowledged that human development is an\nimportant way to address high levels of global poverty, that such\ndevelopment is energy intensive, and the cheapest sources of energy\navailable are not likely to be clean energy types. These\nconsiderations significantly affect efforts to deal with problems\npresented by climate change. There is much discussion about the\nprinciples that should inform a fair treaty aimed at dealing with\naddressing climate change that also gives appropriate weight to\nconcerns for human development. Some of the main contenders\ninclude principles that recognize causal responsibility for high\nemission levels, principles that are sensitive to ability to pay, and\nones according to which those who have benefited from emissions should\nnow be expected to absorb more costs. \n\nWe have not all contributed equally to the problems created by\nemissions; industrialized nations have contributed historically at much\nhigher levels than those that are still developing. And so we\nshould endorse the guidelines that those who have polluted more should\npay more to help redress current problems (The Polluter Pays\nPrinciple). However critics argue that this principle\nunfairly holds some responsible when they did not know they were\ncausing harm, since it was not widely known that greenhouse gases could\nresult in climate change prior to 1990. So on this view,\nresponsibility for emissions prior to 1990 should not conform with the\nPolluter Pays Principle, even if it is used to allocate costs after\n1990. A second principle that is often discussed is The\nBeneficiary Pays Principle. Those who live in industrialized\ncountries have typically benefited greatly from high levels of\nemissions so it is not unfair if they are expected to pay a higher\nproportion of costs. Critics object that a history of benefiting is an\ninsufficiently strong consideration for assigning responsibilities now:\nin many cases whether or not people benefit is largely outside of their\ncontrol. According to a third popular principle, The Ability\nto Pay Principle, the capacity of agents to pay for costs\nassociated with mitigating climate change should be relevant. \n\nComprehensive treatment of climate justice requires addressing the\nissue of responsibilities to future generations. For important\n treatment of our responsibilities to other generations see the entry on\n intergenerational justice.\n  \n\nOne striking feature of the state of global health is that there are\nlarge inequalities in health outcomes and opportunities for\nhealth. Consider that life expectancy can vary a great\ndeal. A person born in Sierra Leone can expect to live about 40\nyears whereas one born in Japan can expect to live for 80 years. \nMalaria has been almost entirely eradicated in high-income countries,\nbut it still kills about a million people in developing countries\n(United Nations 2009). A woman in the Niger has a 1 in 7 chance\nof dying in childbirth, whereas this is 1 in 11 000 for women in Canada\n(Benatar and Brock 2011). The global burden of disease is by no\nmeans evenly spread nor does workforce capability correspond with areas\nof highest need. In fact many of the countries that suffer from\nthe greatest burdens of disease have the fewest skilled healthcare\nworkers. In addition, pharmaceutical companies do not spend their\nresearch and development budgets in ways that match where the needs are\ngreatest. Rather, seeking the most profitable ventures, they are\nmuch more likely to spend resources developing drugs for lucrative\nmarkets where the payoffs are greatest, even when the marginal benefits\nto consumers are small. One example is the research and\ndevelopment resources pharmaceutical companies frequently spend on\ndeveloping drugs that are similar to others already available, rather\nthan developing treatments for diseases for which there are no\ncures. It is estimated that drug companies spend approximately\n90% of their research and development resources in seeking treatment\nfor about 10% of diseases (Drugs for Neglected Diseases Working Group\n2001). \n\nThe poor in developing countries are also often more vulnerable to\ndisease and less able to resist disease because of poor living\nconditions related to poverty. Lack of clean water, clean energy\nsources, inadequate nutrition, and other social determinants of health\nplay a key role in explaining this increased vulnerability. \nLiving in overcrowded houses can facilitate the spread of infectious\ndiseases, such as tuberculosis. So, a number of issues that\nsustain poverty or exacerbate people’s vulnerability to disease\nas a result of poverty should be of concern (Benatar and Brock\n2011). As Norman Daniels argues, health inequalities among\ndifferent social groups can be considered unjust when they result from\nunjust distribution in factors that are socially controllable that\naffect population health (Daniels 2011, 101). On this view many\nof the health inequalities that exist are ones that ought to be of\nconcern as they meet this criterion. How should responsibilities\nfor improving this situation be allocated? In many ways, but here\nI pick out just a few that have received considerable attention in the\nphilosophical literature. \n\nThe current system of intellectual property rights is one troubling\narea. The World Trade Organization grants product patents for a\ntwenty year period which effectively renders many new medicines\nunaffordable for the vast majority of the world’s population and\nthose in greatest need. There are a number of innovative\nproposals aimed at addressing these issues. One prominent example is\nthe Health Impact Fund proposal developed by Thomas Pogge, which offers\nalternative ways to reward pharmaceutical companies, notably by how\nmuch impact they have on actually curing diseases (Pogge 2008). \nThe greater their impact, the larger the share of the rewards they\nwould receive from the Health Impact Fund. Nicole Hassoun\nproposes a certification program for rating pharmaceutical\ncompanies’ contributions to the global poor, “Fair Trade\nBio” (Hassoun 2012). Companies would compete for the gold\nstar rankings which could significantly affect consumption choices and\nthereby expected profits. In both cases the aim is to create\nimportant incentives for key players to care about how their products\naffect the global poor. \n\nThere are many other issues that concern philosophers in the domain\nof global health. There are increasingly worrying practices of\nexperimentation on disadvantaged subjects in developing\ncountries. Increasingly, clinical research has been outsourced to\npoor, developing countries with populations that are often highly\nvulnerable. We might wonder about whether these populations are being\nexploited and whether the participants have compromised abilities to\nconsent to drug trials. In many cases the trials bring\nconsiderable health benefits that would not come their way were it not\nin the interests of pharmaceutical companies to do clinical research in\nthose locations. If sufficient benefits accrue for local\npopulations some argue that these cases need not be of concern (London\n2011). \n\nNew infectious diseases and the threat of pandemics are creating\nfurther questions about our responsibilities. Often the case is\nmade that national interests in public health in developed countries\nmandate concern for infectious diseases that originate in developing\ncountries. But more recently, this argument appears to have\nstriking limitations. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014\nraises questions about what we ought to do to help the victims who,\nbecause of the ways in which the disease spreads, are unlikely to\nthreaten large segments of the population in affluent developed\ncountries outside of Africa. The national interests of affluent\ndeveloped countries do not easily converge with public health demands\nin developing ones in this case and yet we might still have important\nresponsibilities to assist. \n\nDiscussion of natural resources often figure prominently in several\ntopics of global justice. Some relevant questions include: Are\nnational communities entitled to the resources they find on their\nterritories? Should principles of global justice apply to our\narrangements for justly distributing natural resources? Charles\nBeitz was an early proponent of a resource distribution principle,\naccording to which natural resources should be allocated such that each\nsociety is able to provide adequately for its population (Beitz\n1975). We saw in Section 2 that Rawls believes that resources are\nnot important to prosperity in the ways many imagine. Rather,\ninstitutional resilience matters more. By contrast, Thomas Pogge\nhighlights the ways in which international practices concerning the\ndistribution of resources create considerable obstacles for prosperity\nin developing countries. In short, these practices create incentives\nfor the wrong kinds of people to take power through illegitimate means\nand to focus on retaining power at the expense of other goals\ngovernments should have, such as trying to improve the well-being of\ntheir citizens. We need to modify these international practices\nso they do not create such an unfavorable environment. In\naddition, Pogge proposes a Global Resources Dividend as one measure by\nwhich practices concerning natural resource distribution would work in\nsome small way to the benefit of the global poor. On this Global\nResources Dividend proposal there would be a small tax on resource\nextraction, payable by the consumers of resources, and available for\nprojects that would assist in helping everyone to be able to meet their\nbasic needs with dignity (Pogge 2008). \n\nLeif Wenar is also concerned with prevailing practices governing the\nsale of natural resources and their products (Wenar 2010). When\nconsumers in wealthy states buy goods from developing countries, this\nis often similar to consciously receiving stolen goods. \nLegitimate resource sales require general agreement from\ncitizens. Evidence of agreement requires that: (i) owners must be\ninformed about sales, (ii) owners must be able to express dissent\nfreely should they have doubts about sales, and (iii) owners should be\nable to stop resource sales without fearing grave consequences such as\nviolence and intimidation. In these sorts of ways, Wenar aims to\noutlaw dispossession of citizens’ resources. \n\nFor various reasons (including strategic ones) Thomas Pogge and Leif\nWenar do not directly challenge the right of nations to own resources\non their territories. Policy recommendations, for instance, are\nmuch more likely to be effective if they can fit within the main\nstructures of international conventions. However, other theorists\ndo take up this issue including Hillel Steiner, Tim Hayward and Mathias\nRisse. Steiner argues that all inhabitants of the world are\nentitled to an equal share in the value of all land and he advocates\nfor the “Global Fund” which aims to ensure that equal share\nentitlements can be secured. The Global Fund would constitute a\nclearing house for payments and disbursements (Steiner 2005). \n\nAppealing to accounts of ownership of resources, some philosophers\ndraw out important implications for diverse global justice\ndebates. Mathias Risse argues that we all, collectively, own the\nresources of the earth and this has profound implications for a range\nof global justice issues, including immigration. When people are\nunder-utilizing their “rightful shares” of territory, they\ncannot complain when co-owners would like to occupy some of it. \nSome theorists concerned with environmental issues also discuss our\nrights with respect to natural resources. Some argue that we have\nequal rights to access the earth’s resources. Tim Hayward,\nfor instance, argues that we have equal rights to ecological space\n(Hayward 2005). This is often appealed to when there is a\nperception that we have exceeded our share, such as in levels of carbon\nemissions and consumption more generally. \n\nAccounts according to which we have equal rights to resources, land,\necological space and so on, are often accused of suffering from an\nimportant common problem. It is difficult to defend a clear and\ncompelling account of the value of resources as these can vary\nconsiderably in different social, cultural and technological\ncontexts. But we need to be able to quantify resource values to\nsome plausible extent, if we are to determine whether people are\nenjoying or exceeding their equal shares. \n\nThere are a number of global justice problems that require\nremedying, and this raises the issue of remedial\nresponsibilities. Who should do what to reduce global\ninjustices? Several different agents, groups, organizations and\ninstitutions could play a role. Which responsibilities should\ndevolve to corporations, governments, consumers, citizens,\ninternational organizations or social movements? Several\nguidelines that are often discussed include issues concerning the\ncontribution agents have made to a problem, their patterns of benefit\nfrom the problem, and their capacity to take constructive action now.\nTwo influential frameworks deserve more extended treatment, notably\nthat of Iris Marion Young concerning a social connection model for\nallocating responsibilities for structural injustice and that of David\nMiller concerning remedial responsibility (Young 2011, Miller\n2007). \n\nIn contrast to the idea of responsibility as involving finding fault\nand individual liability, Iris Marion Young develops a forward-looking\nmodel which she argues is more appropriate. She draws on the idea\nthat participation via institutions sometimes produces injustice, so we\nhave particular responsibilities to address injustice. We share\nresponsibility for remedying injustice but we may have different\ndegrees and kinds of responsibility. She offers different\nparameters of reasoning that can help individuals and organizations\ndecide what might make the most sense for them to do in efforts to\nremedy injustice, given that there are so many injustices, whereas time\nand resources are limited. Using the case study of the\nglobal apparel industry she illustrates how the fact that we are\npositioned differently can entail varying but important\nresponsibilities for all who participate in activities that sustain\nsweatshops. There are at least four parameters that agents can\nuse in their reasoning: \n\nIn summary, Young encourages us to think about how we can best take\nresponsibility for reducing structural injustice by reflecting on these\nfour parameters—different positions of power, privilege,\ninterest and collective ability. \n\nDavid Miller offers a tremendously influential connection theory of\nresponsibility that also discusses our remedial responsibilities. There\nare six ways in which we can be connected to someone, P, who needs help\nand so be held remedially responsible for assisting. These\nconnections give rise to six ways in which remedial responsibility can\nbe identified. We might be morally responsible for P’s\ncondition; we might be outcome or causally responsible for P’s\ncondition; we might have had no causal role in their condition but have\nbenefited from it; we might have capacity to assist P; or we might be\n connected to P through ties of\n community.[4] \n\nIn the global justice literature there are also important concerns\nabout the distribution of responsibilities among collective and\nindividual agents. Prominently, can we hold nations responsible for\nglobal injustices or remedying such injustices? This raises important\nquestions about collective responsibility that are well\n treated elsewhere in this encyclopedia (see the entry  on\n collective responsibility.\n  \n\nIs it possible to have global justice in the absence of a world\nstate? Hobbes argues that this is not possible since there is no\nglobal authority that can secure and enforce the requirements of\njustice. He presents the classic so-called realist case, which is\nhighly influential in international politics, such that there is a\nstate of nature in the international realm. All states compete in\npursuing their own advantage and since there is no global authority\nthere can be no justice in international affairs. \n\nOthers are more optimistic. Since we already have a high level\nof interaction among states, organizations and other agents, this has\ngenerated various norms and expectations about appropriate conduct\nwhich guide behavior in the international sphere (Beitz 1999). \nMoreover, we have a strong interest in co-operation when this is\nnecessary to deal practically with a range of problems that have global\nreach. Global governance is concerned with how we manage\ninterests affecting the residents of more than one state in the absence\nof a world state. There is already a high level of co-operation\namong a variety of networks, organizations and other groups of\ninterested parties at the sub-state level, and this is powerfully\ninfluencing the redesign of best practice norms in particular domains\n(Anne-Marie Slaughter 2004). \n\nOther change agents that can and have exercised considerable reform\npressures include global social movements, such as the anti-sweatshop\nmovement, the fair trade movement, and other ethical consumption\nmovements. Global activism has been an important source of\nincremental change. These simple examples show that much more is\npossible in the absence of a world state than realists acknowledge. \n\n For more on issues of world government, see the entry\n world government,\n which provides extended treatment of this issue.  \n\nPhilosophers are contributing in important ways to discussions of\nglobal justice policy issues. As illustrations, in this entry we have\ncanvassed several institutional reform proposals for addressing global\ninjustices which have enjoyed widespread attention, both within the\nacademy and beyond. These include Thomas Pogge’s Health Impact\nFund proposal (Section 8) along with his proposal for a Global\nResources Dividend (Section 9.1), Christian Barry and Sanjay\nReddy’s Just Linkage Proposal to help improve working conditions\n(Section 4), and Allan Buchanan and Robert Keohane’s\ninstitutional innovations to secure accountability in the use of\nmilitary force (Section 3.2). There is also the innovative work of\nLeif Wenar concerning proposals for clean trade (Section 9.1). \n\nIn addition to those illustrations already highlighted in this\narticle, philosophers are also having an impact on policy discussions\nin a wide range of areas including climate change, reforming the\nUnited Nations, and suggesting the new priorities that should replace\nthe Millennium Development Goals which expire in 2015. Philosophers\nhave also contributed to influential international multi-disciplinary\nprojects that seek alternative ways to measure quality of life or\npoverty (Nussbaum and Sen 1993, Pogge 2014). One area recently drawing\nincreased attention concerns tax and accounting matters. Philosophers\nhave discussed rampant abusive tax practices by corporations and\nwealthy individuals and how this deprives developing countries of\nmuch-needed income for human development in developing\ncountries. There has also been discussion of global income taxes,\ncarbon taxes, financial transaction taxes and Tobin Taxes (Moellendorf\n2009, Caney 2005b, Brock 2009). \n\nPhilosophers continue to make an important contribution to policy\ndebates and this is also likely to be an area in which considerable\nuseful future work on global justice will concentrate.","contact.mail":"g.brock@auckland.ac.nz","contact.domain":"auckland.ac.nz"}]
