On the basis of a certain similarity in style and content,\nit is generally supposed that the works transmitted under the name of\n“Elias,” just like the works attributed to\n“David,” emerged from the school of Olympiodorus at\nAlexandria and that the author lived and worked there in the second\nhalf of the 6th century CE. However, good evidence that a Neoplatonic\nphilosopher bearing the Christian monastic name “Elias”\never existed is in fact scant. In this article “Elias” is\nused to refer to the assumed author of the commentaries nowadays\nattributed to him. (See further below, section 3.)\n\nThe 6th century witnesses at once the culmination and the demise of a\nlong tradition of philosophical commentaries on the works of Plato and\nespecially Aristotle. This tradition already began in the 1st century\nBCE, but it becomes first tangible for us with the commentaries on\nAristotle of Aspasius in the 2nd century CE and especially with\nAlexander of Aphrodisias in the early 3rd century. This exegetical\ntradition reached its pinnacle in the first half of the 6th century\nwith the great works of Ammonius Hermeiou and his pupils Simplicius\nand John Philoponus. The latter was a Christian who, after much\ncriticism and polemic, broke with (pagan) Neoplatonic school\nphilosophy and turned his energy to the exegesis of biblical texts as\nwell as the theological controversies of his day. However, because of\nthe survival of even later commentaries attributed to philosophers\nwith Christian names such as Elias and David, it is commonly supposed\nthat in the later 6th century pagan philosophy was indeed still being\ntaught in Alexandria, only by Christians. This would then be in marked\ncontrast to Athens, where pagan philosophy died out rapidly after the\nAthenian academy was closed by Emperor Justinian in 529. \nThree works attributed to Elias have been published: a commentary on\nPorphyry’s Isagoge, a commentary on Aristotle’s\nCategories (both in Commentaria in Aristotelem\nGraeca Vol 18) and a third, highly truncated work on\nAristotle’s Prior Analytics (see Westerink 1961). The\nauthor of these works may have been a pupil of Olympiodorus, and in\nthat case it is quite possible that the commentary on the\nIsagoge was composed in the form of a transcript of\nOlympiodorus’ lectures. \nIn the tradition of Neoplatonic philosophical training,\nPorphyry’s Isagoge and Aristotle’s\nCategories were part of the standard curriculum for\nbeginners, a practice that was well established by the 5th and 6th\ncenturies. Like Ammonius Hermeiou before him, Elias prefaces the\nlectures on the Isagoge with a very general\n‘Introduction’ to philosophy, a text that belongs to the\ngenre of protreptic or exhortational philosophical literature.\nElias’exhortation to philosophy consists of 12 lectures designed\nto serve a triple purpose: 1. to outline and define the scope of\nphilosophy, 2. to justify the various topics of the lectures the\nstudents are about to hear, and 3. to motivate them in a general way\nto pursue a course in philosophy. \nTo some extent, Elias’ introduction to philosophy brings out the\nindividual character and temperament of the author. He comes across as\na very lively lecturer who dazzled his students with quotations and\nallusions of many kinds. For example, in his 12 introductory lectures,\nPlato is mentioned 22 times; there are 15 quotations from Homer as\nwell as numerous scattered references to Aristotle, Plotinus, Proclus,\nMarinus, Hierocles, Pythagoras, Archilochus, Theognis, Herodotus,\nCallimachus, Demosthenes, Sophocles, Euripides, Menander, Galen and an\nunnamed Stoic. Moreover, Elias repeatedly emphasizes the\nPlatonic-Neoplatonic conviction that the purpose of philosophy is the\ntransformation or assimilation of a human being to the godhead, a\ngenuinely Platonic ideal explicitly stated in the Theaetetus,\n176A-B. Given that by the late 6th century a professor in Alexandria,\nor anywhere else in the Eastern empire, would address a predominantly,\nif not exclusively, Christian audience, these remarks give one pause,\nespecially if one believes that they stem from an author who, if the\nattribution to “Elias” can be trusted, himself subscribed to\nChristianity. For a Christian, of course, drawing near the godhead\nwould not be the result of reading and embracing Platonic philosophy\nbut of divine grace that depended on faith. \nIn his preface to Aristotle’s Categories, Elias gives a\nconcise and admirable summary of the qualities an ideal commentator\nought to have (CAG 18.1, pp. 122f. as quoted by Wilson 1983,\n47): \nThe title of a recently published manuscript, dated to the 13th or\n14th century and containing a Prior Analytics commentary,\nsuggests that Elias, who is named as the author of the commentary,\nonce held the office of prefect in the Byzantine empire. In the\nNovellae of Justinian, a prefect by the name of Elias is\nindeed mentioned (Novel. CLIII, dated 12 December 541; cf.\nWesterink 1961). Since the name Elias was rare in secular circles at\nthe time, Westerink proposes that unless evidence to the contrary\nemerges our commentator and the prefect should be considered\nidentical. A (praetorian or urban) prefect in the late Roman Empire\nwas, as direct representative of the emperor, the highest civilian\nadministrator of a region or city (most importantly Rome or\nConstantinople). If our commentator really held such an illustrious\noffice, presumably after he had established himself as professor of\nphilosophy (cf. the life of Themistius), he most likely also came from\na high-ranking family of nobles. Unfortunately, apart from the scant\nevidence found in the late manuscripts of the extant commentaries\nnothing further is known about a philosopher or prefect by the name of\nElias. A fairly comprehensive Byzantine list of commentators on\nPorphyry and Aristotle does not know of any philosopher by that name,\nnor do Photius (9th c. Byzantine scholar) and the author of the Suda,\na 10th c. encyclopedia. A closer look at the manuscript tradition\nreveals that the texts now attributed to Elias circulated as anonymous\nmanuscripts for a considerable time, meaning that the attribution to\none “Elias” is a much later addition. Given that there is nothing\nexplicitly Christian about these works (there are no references to the\nBible, but the text abounds with references to pagan philosophers and\nliterary figures), and given that we find an explicit avowal of\ndoctrines that are quite obviously at variance with Christianity (e.g.\nthat a philosopher must strive to imitate the sun; that the world is\neternal), it is possible to adopt a more skeptical position (cf.\nWildberg 1990). That is to say, the suspicion arises that the original\nauthor may not have been Christian at all, but a latter-day pagan who,\nlike Olympiodorus, taught Greek philosophy to a Christian audience. In\nthat case, the attribution of these commentaries to some\n“Elias” may well have been motivated by monastic scribes\nwho sought to justify copying these pagan philosophical texts by\ninventing a good Christian name for their author. Alternatively, if\nthe author was indeed the Christian prefect Elias, as Westerink\nsuggests, we are invited to modify our preconceptions about the\npossibility of pagan philosophical discourse within the Christian\nculture of the Byzantine empire. In either case, the commentaries\ntestify to the vitality and importance of pagan philosophy and\nlearning in the mid- or late 6th century CE.","contact.mail":"wildberg@princeton.edu","contact.domain":"princeton.edu"}]
