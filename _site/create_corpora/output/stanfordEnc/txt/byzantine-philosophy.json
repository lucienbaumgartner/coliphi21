The second half of this delineation\nconstrues the attribute “Byzantine” rather narrowly, in\nthat it excludes the whole period between c. 330 and c. 730, which is\ncommonly referred to by historians as “Early Byzantine”\n(and also leaves out of account philosophical activity in the minority\nlanguages of the Byzantine Empire). The main reason for focusing on\nthe philosophical works after c. 730 is that Early Byzantine\nphilosophy is usually covered in accounts of late Ancient Philosophy,\nof which it is a seamless continuation. The first half of the\ndelineation should not be taken to imply any particular view regarding\nthe “true face of Byzantine philosophy”, although we do\nthink that it is by being related in certain ways to the philosophical\ntradition that a written work is eligible to be classed as\nphilosophical. This tradition was formed in antiquity. Hence, the\nworks discussed here will typically be concerned with questions\ninherited from ancient philosophy.\n\n\n\nWe have tried to impose a provisional borderline between Byzantine\nphilosophy and other areas which are so closely related to Byzantine\nphilosophy as to be sometimes inseparable from it. Most importantly,\nwe have tried to demarcate our subject matter from that of Byzantine\ntheology, not because we believe that an account in which the\nreligious dimension is largely ignored will be sufficient to grasp\nByzantine intellectual history in its organic entirety, but because we\nthink that a clearer conception of the “purely”\nphilosophical part of Byzantine intellectual history is both desirable\nin itself and necessary for the understanding of the whole. This may\nseem to lead us straight towards an episodic account, concentrating on\na few solitary thinkers on the fringe of Byzantine intellectual\nhistory. In order to avoid this we have chosen not to place very heavy\ndemands on the originality of the works to be included. Our main\nconcern has been to describe the typical features of the philosophical\ntradition in Byzantium, rather than to highlight the rare instances\nwhen innovative views and arguments were put forward. For further discussion of the methodology of the history of Byzantine philosophy, see Kapriev (2006), Trizio (2007), Golitsis (2011), and Gutas and Siniossoglou (2017).\n\n\n\nThe main part of the article is divided into two sections. Section\n1 attempts to situate Byzantine philosophy in the general context of\nByzantine culture and education, and to give a brief survey of the more\nimportant philosophical authors and their works. For Section 2, we have\nmade a selection of two especially significant topics in the fields of\nnatural philosophy and metaphysics. This arrangement allows us to look\na bit more closely at the form and content of some Byzantine\nphilosophical views and arguments without giving up the ambition to be\nreasonably historically comprehensive.\n\n\n\nOne conspicuous feature of Byzantine literary culture in general, and\nthe study of philosophy in particular, is its relative continuity with\nancient Greek literary culture. In Byzantium, the treasures of this\nculture never had to be discovered, as they were in the 9th-century\nArab East, or even rediscovered, as in the 12th-century Latin West. At\nall times, Homer’s Iliad remained the most important\ntextbook for secondary education. Still, this continuity is not\nabsolute: considerable parts of the literary heritage were pushed into\noblivion in periods of cultural decline, some of which were eventually\nlost, whereas others survived to attract new attention during the\nsubsequent periods of intensified activity. The most important periods\nof intensified activity, so far as the history of philosophy is\nconcerned, are: (1) the late Phrygian to early Macedonian\n(842–959), when ancient philosophical texts were saved for\nposterity by the production of new copies in minuscule script; (2) the\nlate Macedonian to early Komnenan (1042–1143); and (3) the early\nPalaiologan (1259–1341). Each of these periods was ushered in by\nthe establishment of an Imperial School of Philosophy in\nConstantinople. Apart from the Imperial Schools, private tutorial\nplayed an important part in higher education, some teachers attaining\nconsiderable fame, for example Nikephoros Blemmydes\n(1197–c. 1269), Gregory of Cyprus (1241–1290), Nikephoros\nGregoras (1293/94–1360/61) and George Gemistos Plethon\n(c. 1360–1452). In the Komnenan (1182–1204) and\nPalaiologan (1259–1453) periods, the Patriarchal School loomed\nlarge, at times existing side by side with the Imperial School, but\napparently specially designated for the education of the clergy. \n\nThere was never in Byzantium anything resembling the autonomous\nuniversities of the Latin West. Higher education was designed to train\nofficials of the state and church, not masters of the arts and\nsciences. The Greek-speaking world was small and decreasing, and there\nwas scarcely any demand in it for very specialized scholarship.\nMoreover, theology never developed into the kind of systematic\ndiscipline it became in the Latin West, and logic was never\nacknowledged as an ancillary discipline (although it was taught at the\nPatriarchal School, at least in the Palaiologan period). All this\ncontributed to the prevalence in Byzantine higher education of an\nencyclopedic ideal, and to the preference of rhetorical over\nphilosophical studies. \n\nThere is reason to think that the task facing Leo the Mathematician,\nas he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Magnaura School\nin the mid-9th century, was to teach Aristotelian logic. In fact,\nelementary Aristotelian logic and natural philosophy combined with\nelementary mathematics would always form the standard philosophical\ncurriculum in Byzantium. Perhaps the range of courses was slightly\nexpanded in the late 1040s to the 1070s, when Michael Psellos and John\nItalos were Consuls of the Philosophers, but the standard curriculum\nwas certainly back in force at the Imperial School under George\nAkropolites in the 1260s and early 1270s. The logic texts usually\nstudied were Porphyry’s Isagoge as well as\nAristotle’s Categories, De interpretatione,\nPrior Analytics 1.1–7 and Sophistici elenchi\n1–7. Periodically, there seems to have been significant interest\nalso in the Posterior Analytics, since we have no fewer than\nfour extant Byzantine commentaries on the second book — in\naddition to the ancient paraphrase by Themistius and the commentary by\npseudo-Philoponus — which probably were intended to supplement\nPhiloponus’ commentary on the first book. In natural philosophy,\nextracts from Aristotle’s Physics, De generatione\net corruptione and Meteorology would be read, whereas\nthe mathematics course consisted mainly of Nicomachus’\nIntroductio arithmetica and the first six books of\nEuclid’s Elements. In many cases, students would replace\nsome or all of these texts with compendia such as the widely circulated\nEpitome logica and Epitome physica by Nikephoros\nBlemmydes, or the Logic and Quadrivium by the anonymous of\n1007 (‘Anonymus Heiberg’)—or indeed John of\nDamascus’ Dialectica. \n\nIt deserves to be noted that before the 12th century, the whole\nByzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries dealt exclusively with\nthe works on logic. No doubt this reflects the needs of the\neducational sector at the time. Natural philosophy in the\n7th–11th centuries is only represented by elementary compendia\nsuch as the ones by Symeon Seth (mid- to late-11th century). There is\na commentary on the\nPhysics attributed in some manuscripts (and in Benakis’\n2008 edition) to Michael Psellos, but recent research has plausibly\nsuggested that this is really the work of the late-13th-century\nscholar George Pachymeres (Golitsis 2007).  If the range of subjects\ncovered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades\nafter 1118 is much greater, this may be due to the initiative of the\nprincess Anna Komnene, who seems to have commissioned a number of\nscholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of\nAristotle. This was an exceptional enterprise: it would and could\nhardly have been undertaken had it not been preceded by a period of\nstrong interest in philosophy; but it left very few traces in the\nlearned activities of the immediately following decades. \n\nObviously, there were other forums than the schools for philosophical\ndiscourse. Photios seems to have hosted some kind of literary salon in\nhis home in the 850s or 860s, and similar gatherings,\nso-called theatra, where philosophical and other essays were\nread and discussed, constituted a central element in early Palaiologan\ncultural life (see Gaul 2011). \n\nSince Byzantine education was so preoccupied with rhetoric, it is\nperhaps no wonder that we find a rather large diversity of literary\nforms employed for philosophical purposes by Byzantine writers.\nObviously, this diversity to some extent reflects the various needs of\neducational and scholarly practice. But there are many literary forms\nthat do not readily lend themselves to use in such contexts; these, then, will\nhave been cultivated for other reasons. \n\nOne such form is the dialogue. The philosophical dialogue endured\nthroughout the whole Byzantine era, even if perhaps it did not flourish\nas abundantly as in the contemporary West. By and large, it seems\npossible to divide the extant specimens into two subcategories: Plato\npastiche and Lucian pastiche. In the latter subcategory belongs the\nearly 12th-century satire Timarion, which offers some amusing\nmockery of contemporary or near-contemporary philosophy professors like\nMichael Psellos, John Italos, and Theodore of Smyrna. The elenctic\ndialogue in Plato’s style seems to have been considered\nparticularly useful for polemical purposes. Many dialogues in this\nsubcategory have a more theological than philosophical content, but\nTheodore Prodromos’ (c. 1100–1170) relatively good-humoured\nXenedemus, or, Predicables, and Nikephoros Gregoras’\n(1293/94–1360/61) rather more virulent Phlorentius, or, On\nWisdom are two conspicuous exceptions. A particularly intriguing\nexample is Hermippus, or, On Astrology: this attempt at a\nreconciliation between the belief in astral influence over the natural\nworld and the Christian doctrines of divine providence and human free\nwill is one of three anonymous dialogues, probably from the\nearly 14th century, which have been variously attributed to Nikephoros\nGregoras, John Aktouarios and John Katrones (or Katrarios) (Hohlweg\n1995). \n\nPhilosophical treatises, vaguely defined as prose monologues on\nparticular themes arguing personal views, are found predominantly from\nthe three most philosophically productive periods (see section 1.1).\nThey were composed by numerous authors and for various purposes, some\nof them, no doubt, strictly pedagogical or scholarly; but we will here\nonly mention two examples of a slightly more topical and literary\ncharacter. The philosophical essays (Logoi) of Nikephoros\nChoumnos (c. 1250/55–1327) are written in a personal but hardly\noriginal style—much in keeping with the views propounded in\nthem—which does not always correspond to the author’s\nprofessed ideal of clarity. Those of Theodore Metochites\n(Sēmeiōseis gnōmikai, c. 1326) represent a\nfurther move in the direction of essays in the strict and narrow sense.\nInspired by Plutarch and anticipating Montaigne, Metochites seems to\nhave conceived of them as adding up to a ‘self-portrait as a\nphilosopher’, theorizing about, and obviously trying to put into\npractice, the proper style for philosophy. \n\nMetochites discussed philosophy in some of his orations\n(Logoi) and some of his hexameter poetry. Dodecasyllabic verse\nwas also put to use, notably by John Tzetzes (c. 1110–1180), who\nwrote a 1700-line paraphrase of Porphyry’s Isagoge. The\nByzantines are also known for having enthusiastically cultivated the\nart of writing letters, in which they occasionally dealt with\nphilosophical questions (e.g., Michael Psellos, Letter to\nXiphilinos; Theodore Prodromos, On ‘Great’ and\n‘Small’). \n\nTurning to those literary forms that can be assumed to have had an\neducational or scholarly purpose, the kind of texts that bring us most\nclosely into contact with the daily reality of philosophy classes are\nundoubtedly the collections of questions and answers that have been\nhanded down from the 1040s to 1070s, the most well-known of which is\nperhaps the Quaestiones quodlibetales by John Italos (c.\n1025–after 1082). \n\nA very well-represented philosophical genre is the compendium. Most of\nthese cover only a part of philosophy, like the logic compendium by\nJohn Chortasmenos (c. 1370–1436/37), the Quadrivium by\nGeorge Pachymeres (1242–c. 1310), or the Logic and\nQuadrivium by the anonymous of 1007 (‘Anonymus\nHeiberg’). Some of them attempt universality, like\nPachymeres’ paraphrase-compendium of Aristotle’s\nphilosophical writings (the Philosophia), or indeed Joseph\nRhakendytes’ (died 1330) Encyclopedia, which also\nincluded rhetoric and medicine. As to the question of why the\nByzantines produced compendia, there can be little doubt that they\nmainly did so for educational purposes. Most of the compendia are\nwholly or partly concerned with logic, the most basic subject in the\nphilosophical curriculum. They do not contain detailed comments for\npeople already initiated in the subtleties of Aristotelian logic;\nrather, they are introductory texts that do not presuppose any\nsignificant knowledge of the subject.  \n\nA large proportion of the Byzantine philosophical texts consist of\ncommentaries on ancient authorities—in fact, almost invariably\nAristotle. The only Plato commentary from the period after c. 730 is\nGeorge Pachymeres’ supplement to Proclus on the last 24 pages of\nthe Parmenides. These commentaries are not, however, all made\naccording to the same pattern. A few main categories can be discerned,\nand even within some of these categories, there is considerable\nvariation. The most basic type of commentary is (a) simply a\ncollection of scholia or notes, usually transmitted in the margin of\nthe Aristotelian text. The individual scholia of such a collection may\nbe the work of an indeterminate number of scholars. An example is\nArethas’ scholia on the Isagoge, which draws on many\nearlier commentaries, some of which are now lost. It is Arethas’\ncommentary in the sense that he copied, and possibly collected and\nedited, the scholia in his Aristotle manuscript; in terms of\nauthorship, however, it is a product of mass collaboration. Next, (b)\nthe collection may be provided with an introduction dealing with\npreliminary questions. Rules for the composition of such introductions\nwere established by the Alexandrian commentators on Porphyry and\nAristotle in the 5th–7th centuries. The best examples in the\nperiod after c. 730 of collections of scholia with introductions are\nprobably the commentaries on Porphyry’s and Aristotle’s\nlogical works by Leo Magentenos (late 12th or early to mid-13th\ncentury). Further, (c) the notes can be integrated in a running\ncommentary, so as to form a quasi-independent whole, each new section\nintroduced by a lemma from the text. This is the standard type of\nso-called ‘exegetical commentary’ typified by Alexander of\nAphrodisias and cultivated in Byzantine times by Michael of Ephesus\nand Eustratios of Nicaea in the early 12th century. (d) The\nAlexandrian 6th–7th-century commentaries are sometimes divided\ninto more or less even chunks (praxeis), each starting with a\nlemma followed by a general explanation of its meaning\n(theōria), and then proceeding to comments on particular\npoints (lexis). While there are no clear-cut examples of this\ntype of commentary from Middle or Late Byzantium, its influence can be\ntraced, for instance, in Eustratios’ commentary on Posterior\nAnalytics 2. (e) An even more advanced form is represented by\nGeorge (Gennadios) Scholarios’ commentaries, which, in the\nmanner of contemporary Latin works, are divided into\n‘lessons’ (anagnōseis = lectiones),\neach of which is subdivided into an introduction, a broad analysis of\nthe text into sections, a detailed analysis with interpretations of\nparticular points, and finally ‘investigations’\n(zētēmata = quaestiones). \n\nThe genre of Aristotelian paraphrase, that is, adaptations in which\nAristotle’s text is rephrased, reorganized, and amplified or\npruned, as need be, in order to make it more easily understood, was\nallegedly invented by Themistius in the mid-4th century, revived by\nMichael Psellos in the mid-11th century, and further developed by\nSophonias and others in the late 13th to early 14th centuries. It is a\ncurious fact that the only periods from which we have dated paraphrases\nof Aristotelian works are precisely these three. In addition, there is\nan Arabic paraphrase that may have been based on a lost Greek\nparaphrase, which must in that case have been composed in the late 6th\nor 7th century (D’Ancona 2001). Works of uncertain date include\nthe paraphrase of the Nicomachean Ethics printed in\nCAG 19 as the work of Heliodorus of Prusa (perhaps mid-14th cent.: see\nsection 1.3). Sophonias consciously tried to blend elements of\n‘exegetical commentary’ with his paraphrase of the De\nanima, in order to be able to preserve more of Aristotle’s\noriginal wording. George Pachymeres effected another kind of hybrid\nparaphrase by organizing his Philosophia like a compendium,\nwhich deals with a given subject, rather than a commentary or a\nparaphrase, which deals with a given text. \n\nNot only Aristotle’s works were paraphrased; there are\nChristianizing paraphrases of Proclus’ Three Treatises\non Providence (the latter have since been lost in the original\nGreek) by Isaac Sebastokrator (1093–after 1152) and of\nEpictetus’ Encheiridion (no fewer than three of them,\nall of uncertain date; one of them, composed and provided with a\ncommentary no later than 960, when the oldest manuscript was copied,\nseems to have enjoyed considerable popularity in the 13th and 14th\ncenturies: Boter 1999, 197–256). One may also note a paraphrase\nof Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos sometimes ascribed to Proclus,\nwritten before the end of the 10th century (Bydén 2003,\n352). \n\nOur brief survey of the philosophical production in Byzantium starts\nin the 9th century with the work of the patriarch of Constantinople,\nPhotios (c. 810–after 893), though there is\nevidence of elementary teaching of logic and ethics in the 7th and 8th\ncenturies, during the period of Iconoclasm. The most important\nphilosophical work from this period is the Dialectica, the\nfirst part of John of Damascus’ (c.\n675–749) widely influential Source of Knowledge, which\ndraws mainly on the late antique commentators on Porphyry’s\nIsagoge and Aristotle’s logical works. Unfortunately, the\nonly surviving works by Leo the Mathematician\n(c. 790–after 869), who taught Aristotelian logic at the\nMagnaura School in Constantinople, established soon after the end of\nIconoclasm, are some notes in manuscripts containing Platonic\ndialogues. \n\nBut it is undoubtedly with Photios that we first encounter in\nByzantine times a large-scale revival of the study of antiquity and a\nprofound interest in the texts of ancient philosophers. Photios is\nfamous mainly for his Bibliotheke, a vast compilation of\nancient Greek literature, and a Lexicon, in which he collected\nnotable words and expressions. He also taught Aristotelian logic and\nwrote, for this purpose, a series of small essays on Aristotle’s\nCategories, which are included in the Amphilochia,\nan unsystematic collection of texts on theological and philosophical\ntopics. In these and other essays, Photios engages in a critical\ndiscussion of some of the most central theses in ancient philosophy,\nsuch as Plato’s conception of forms, whose capacity to function\nas predicates he rejects, and Aristotle’s distinction between\nprimary and secondary substances, which he thinks entails that\n‘substance’ is an ambiguous term. \n\nDuring this “first Byzantine Renaissance”, as the period\nhas sometimes been characterized, the archbishop of\nCaesarea, Arethas (c. 850–932/44) also\ncommented on Aristotle’s Categories and\nPorphyry’s Isagoge (cf. section 1.2). He is better\nknown, however, for having been instrumental in the transmission of\nancient texts, in particular the Platonic corpus. He commissioned the\ntranscription of a complete copy of Plato’s works to which he added\nmarginal notes; the first part of his Plato text is extant as the\nfamous Clarkianus 39 manuscript in the Bodleian Library of Oxford. \n\nIn the mid-11th to early 12th centuries, there is a significant\ndevelopment from the widely humanistic character of Photios’ and\nArethas’ interests towards a new understanding of the\nphilosophical enterprise. The philosopher is now regarded as someone\nwith a hard-earned knowledge in all branches of learning, who forms his\nown views on the philosophical topics discussed by the ancients, and\nmoreover as someone who is interested in applying the philosophical\ncategories to various problems in theology or in everyday affairs. \n\nMichael Psellos (1018–1078) was one of\nthe most erudite and intriguing figures of the Byzantine Middle Ages.\nHe was given the title “Consul of the Philosophers” and\ntaught all branches of philosophy. He commented on and paraphrased\ntreatises from the Aristotelian Organon (De\ninterpretatione, Prior Analytics), and wrote a large\nnumber of short treatises discussing particular philosophical issues\nraised, in part at least, by his pupils: e.g., on the distinction\nbetween homonyms and synonyms, on the characteristic of substance as\nself-existent (authuparktos), on the Platonic forms, on the\nunity of the soul and the body, on the problem of evil, on dreams. He\nalso compiled the De omnifaria\ndoctrina, a short encyclopedia in which various philosophical notions are explained in close dependence on Christian as well as pagan authors. His speeches are famous as examples of rhetorical style; there is also a collection of about five hundred of his letters. Although the amount of attention he paid to Aristotle’s works was significant, there is no doubt that Psellos had a strong preference for Plato and the Neoplatonists. On this account he has often — and not unreasonably — been identified as a pivotal figure in the transmission of the Platonic heritage through the Middle Ages. His works show that he carefully read Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and especially Proclus, whom he considered as an authority among ancient authors. In particular, he found in the Elements of Theology an elaborate metaphysical system open to adaptation to Christian theology. For although the Christian Trinity differed significantly from the Neoplatonic first principle, Psellos found that Proclus’ view of the general structure of reality, descending from the first cause to intellect, soul nature, body, and matter, could be adopted with some modifications. However, in his attempts to advance\nphilosophical learning, he was often attacked concerning his\ntheological orthodoxy, with the result that he often had to be careful\nto distance himself from heretical doctrines, e.g., in his writings on\nthe Chaldaean Oracles. \n\nJohn Italos (c. 1025–after 1082) was a pupil\nof Michael Psellos, and his successor in the Imperial School as\n“Consul of the Philosophers”, where he also taught all\nbranches of philosophy. Anna Komnene refers to him in the\nAlexiad, the history she wrote of the events during the reign\nof her father Alexios I (1081–1118), as an exceptional thinker\nand an excellent logician who interpreted Aristotle better than anyone\nelse in his time. Indeed, Italos occupies a special place in the\nhistory of Byzantine thought for having been put on trial and condemned\nby the Church in 1082, on the charge of having advocated the systematic\nuse of philosophical analysis and logical reasoning in clarifying\ntheological issues. Regardless of the positions he defended on such\nissues, positions some of which, after all, were not at all different\nfrom those of other philosophers, notably from Psellos’, what\nseems to have been really unacceptable for the religious and the\npolitical establishment at the time was his rationalist approach\ntowards doctrines which the Orthodox Church considered beyond\ncomprehension, as something Christians should simply accept on faith\nand as something only the Church had the authority to judge. It is\ntelling that to this day, during the mass of the first Sunday in Lent,\nthe so-called Synodikon of the Greek Orthodox Church is read,\nin which Italos is anathematized in eleven articles. What mainly\nsurvives from his writings are the commentary on the second, third and\nfourth book of the Topics; two small treatises on dialectic\nand on the Aristotelian syllogisms together with a very brief synopsis\nof rhetoric; and finally, the Quaestiones quodlibetales, a\ncollection of ninety-three answers to philosophical questions posed to\nhim by his students, among which were the emperor Michael VII (ruled\n1071–1078) and his brother Andronikos Doukas. In these texts\nItalos seems to question the supremacy of theology over philosophy and\neven to overturn the established hierarchy. That is to say, Italos\nobviously follows the ancient conception of philosophy, well known from\nboth the Platonic and the Aristotelian traditions, according to which\ntheology is part of philosophy, since philosophy culminates in the\nattempt to understand the first principle of everything. It probably\nwas this supposedly arrogant attempt on his part to develop a natural\nor philosophical theology that led to his trial and condemnation. \n\nAfter John Italos, Theodore of Smyrna (mid-11th\ncentury–after 1112) was appointed “Consul of the\nPhilosophers”. His work Epitome of All Things Pertaining to\nNature and to Natural Principles according to the Ancients is\nstill unpublished. It was conceived as an introductory compendium in\nfour books (three of which survive) to the topics and terminology of\nAristotle’s Physics.  \n\nAccording to a widely accepted hypothesis, Eustratios of\nNicaea and Michael of Ephesus were two of\nthe contributors to a series of commentaries, initiated by the\nprincess and historian Anna Komnene, on previously neglected\nAristotelian works. Their commentaries, in which they followed ancient\nmodels, some of which are now lost, but also added their own\ninsightful remarks, were partly translated into Latin and played a\nrole in the development of Western Aristotelianism in the 13th\ncentury. \n\nEustratios was a pupil of John Italos and became the Metropolitan of\nNicaea at the beginning of the 12th century. Anna Komnene in the\nAlexiad presents him as an extremely erudite scholar both of\nreligious and of secular literature as well as a master of dialectic.\nHe was also asked by the emperor Alexios I to participate in various\ntheological debates with the Latin Church, until he himself, just like\nhis teacher Italos, was finally condemned for heresy in 1117. The\nreasons for his condemnation are a rather complicated matter involving\nboth theological and political issues. In this connection, however, it\nis interesting to note that he was famous for his strong conviction of\nthe propriety of using Aristotle’s syllogistic in theology; he even\nstated that Christ himself had argued with the help of Aristotelian\nsyllogisms. What we have of his work as a commentator are his comments\non the first and sixth book of the Nicomachean Ethics and his\ncommentary on the second book of the Posterior Analytics. In\ninterpreting Aristotle, Eustratios clearly followed the late antique\nNeoplatonic philosophers, though at certain places, like the issue\nconcerning the knowledge of first principles, he advocated theses\nwhich seem closer in line with his Christian beliefs. For Eustratius,\ncontrary to Plato and Aristotle, did not claim that the human soul\nregains pieces of knowledge that we possessed at some former time, nor\nthat it has only potential knowledge which then becomes actual. He\nbelieved that the human soul, when created by God, is created perfect,\nthat is, it has full knowledge of the principles and self-evident\ncommon concepts, but human beings lose sight of this knowledge and\nunderstanding, because they are susceptible to the impulses generated\nby their body. \n\nAbout Michael of Ephesus’ life next to nothing is known. On\nthe other hand, it is perfectly clear that his breadth as an\nAristotelian commentator is remarkable. Indeed, Michael has been\ncompared to Alexander of Aphrodisias in respect both of his mode of\nexposition and method of interpretation. He wrote commentaries not only\non the fifth, ninth, and tenth books of the Nicomachean\nEthics, but also on Metaphysics 6–14 and on the\nSophistical Refutations (both wrongly attributed to\nAlexander), on the Generation of Animals (wrongly attributed\nto Philoponus), on the Parva naturalia, on the Parts of\nAnimals, on the Movement of Animals, on the\nProgression of Animals; furthermore, he wrote comments on the\npseudo-Aristotelian treatise De coloribus, and on\nthe Politics, the latter of which have only partly\nsurvived. \n\nTheodore Prodromos (c. 1100–c. 1170) continued\nthe tradition of writing extensive commentaries on Aristotle’s works\nby authoring a still unedited commentary on the second book of\nAristotle’s Posterior Analytics, heavily influenced by\nEustratios’. A couple of his minor works are also worth\nmentioning. His Xenedemus is a short Plato-style elenctic\ndialogue on themes from Porphyry’s\nIsagoge. He also wrote a small essay, On\n‘Great’ and ‘Small’, which contains a\nseries of arguments against Aristotle’s doctrine in the sixth\nchapter of the Categories that ‘great’ and\n‘small’ are not quantities but relatives, and not\ncontraries. \n\nNevertheless, not all Byzantine philosophers at the time were in\nfavor of harmonizing ancient wisdom with the Christian doctrines. In\nfact, since Proclus seems to have represented the ancient philosopher\npar excellence, being so much admired by Psellos and his\npupils, he understandably became the target of Nicholas of\nMethone (early 12th century–c. 1160/66), who wrote a\ndetailed refutation of the Elements of Theology.\nNicholas’ aim clearly was to provide the pious readers with the\nnecessary arguments against the Neoplatonic influences on Christian\ndogmas, influences that on his view could lead the believers away from\nthe true faith. For instance, Nicholas systematically argues against\nthose of Proclus’ propositions which try to establish that the\nunderlying principle of the universe is pure unity, because he\nconsiders them contrary to the Christian belief in the Holy\nTrinity. \n\nThe capture of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204 dealt a\nsevere blow to the Byzantine institutions of education and learning.\nMany teachers and scholars fled the city to find a haven in Nicaea,\nwhere the Laskarid dynasty had settled. Education and learning were\nmatters of great concern to the Laskarid emperors; one of them,\nTheodore II Doukas Laskaris (ruled 1254–1258),\nwas himself the author of two works on natural\nphilosophy, Kosmikē dēlōsis (Cosmic\nExposition) and Peri phusikēs koinōnias\n(On Physical Community), in which he brought simple\nmathematical schemes to bear on elemental theory and cosmology. In\n1261 Constantinople was recaptured by Michael VIII Palaiologos, and\nthe period of cultural prosperity that followed is sometimes referred\nto as the “Palaiologan renaissance”. \n\nThe most important philosophy teacher and scholar in the period\nleading up to this “renaissance” was\nundoubtedly Nikephoros Blemmydes\n(1197–c. 1269). Through his students – who included Doukas\nLaskaris as well as the historian George Akropolites\n(1217–1282), later charged by Michael VIII with the\nheadmastership of the Imperial School in Constantinople – and\nthrough his widely read compendia on logic and natural philosophy (see\nsect. 1.2), Blemmydes exerted an influence that is clearly discernible\nin many later philosophical works although it has never been\nsystematically measured. In a prefatory note to his compendium on\nlogic, the first version of which was apparently composed in 1237 at\nthe behest of Emperor John III Batatzes, he somewhat unexpectedly\nemphasizes the utility of logic for theology.  Indeed,\nBlemmydes’ services were employed on more than one occasion to\ndefend the Orthodox dogma of the procession of the Holy Ghost in\nofficial debates with papal legates. The relation to the Catholic\nChurch was the dominating political and religious issue for most of\nthe 13th century. A reunion was negotiated at the Second Council of\nLyons in 1274, but it lacked popular support, and after the death of\nMichael VIII in 1282, the new emperor and his patriarch pulled out of\nthe deal. Encounters with Dominican and Franciscan theologians may\nhave helped fuel the interest in logic in Byzantium during this time.\nThe Greek translations of Boethius’ De hypotheticis\nsyllogismis and De topicis differentiis\nby Manuel Holobolos, who taught logic at the\nPatriarchal School between 1265 and 1273, must be seen against this\nbackground. Other Latin philosophical and theological works were\ntranslated by Maximos Planoudes\n(1260–c. 1310). They do not seem to have had any discernible\nimpact until the mid-14th century, when Augustine’s\n“cogito” appears as one of several arguments against\nScepticism in a pamphlet by Nicholas Kabasilas\nChamaetos (c. 1322/3–after 1391); it reappears in a\nsimilar work of unknown date, transmitted as chapter 3 of a miscellany\nattributed in the (late) manuscripts to\none Herennius. \n\nOn the other hand, the development of Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy at the hands of Western masters may have encouraged their\nGreek-speaking colleagues to a more intense study of the relevant\ntexts. As noted in section 1.2, a great number of commentaries,\nparaphrases and compendia of Aristotle’s works, mainly but\nnot exclusively on logic and natural philosophy, were produced in the\n13th and early 14th centuries. \n\nBlemmydes’ compendia draw for the most part on Aristotle and\nhis late antique commentators, but occasionally other influences are in\nevidence, such as that of John of Damascus in the Epitome\nlogica and that of the Stoic cosmologist Cleomedes in the\nEpitome physica. Besides these two compendia, Blemmydes\ncomposed two anthropological works, De anima and\nDe corpore, and two short treatises on a much-discussed\nquestion of both theological and philosophical import, Against the\nPredetermination of the Terminus of Life, in which he defends\nthe causal connection between moral choice and life span, although he\nproceeds mostly by appeal to authority. \n\nThe historian George Pachymeres (1242–c.\n1310), who also taught at the Patriarchal School, wrote a voluminous\nAristotelian paraphrase-compendium covering not only logic and natural\nphilosophy but also metaphysics and ethics, the Philosophia.\nIn addition, he wrote a textbook on the four mathematical disciplines\n(the Quadrivium) and, more importantly,\n“exegetical” commentaries on four Aristotelian works, or\ngroups of works, namely the Organon, the Physics,\nthe Metaphysics and the Nicomachean Ethics, as well\nas the only Late Byzantine commentary on Plato, a continuation of\nProclus’ incompletely transmitted commentary on\nthe Parmenides, which contrasts starkly with its ancient\npredecessor by applying a “logical” (i.e.,\nnon-metaphysical) method of interpretation and a paraphrastic mode of\nexposition. A growing body of evidence shows that Pachymeres was\ndeeply engaged in collecting, transcribing, and editing manuscripts of\nphilosophical authors. \n\nPachymeres’ concern with Plato was not coincidental. If the\nboom in Aristotelian studies in this period was partly a response to\nthe challenge of Western philosophy and theology, it seems reasonable\nto think that a similar cause may be found for the rising popularity of\nPlato, who was much less known than Aristotle in the West. Ever since\nLate Antiquity Aristotelian logic and natural philosophy had been\ncommonly regarded as propaedeutic to Platonic metaphysics, and the\nhierarchical relation between the two philosophers was now increasingly\nstressed, sometimes (as in Nikephoros Gregoras’\nPhlorentius) in the context of open criticism of the\nAristotelian inclinations of Latin philosophy. Platonic metaphysics\nwas, however, a theologically precarious field, and it is hardly\nsurprising if those who plowed it were not at all times equally\noutspoken about the fruits of their labor. Still, in the 1260s, George\nAkropolites willingly admitted that his interpretations of Church\nFathers were informed by the divinely inspired Plato, Proclus,\nIamblichus and Plotinus; and towards the end of our period George\nGemistos Plethon went so far as completely to discard Christianity in\nfavor of Neoplatonic polytheism. \n\nAnother early Palaiologan compendium extends its ambit to cover\nrhetoric and medicine as well as the whole of philosophy. This is\nthe Encyclopedia of Joseph Rhakendytes\n(aka Joseph the Philosopher, died 1330). Joseph drew heavily on the\nworks of his Byzantine predecessors. His part on logic reproduces\nBlemmydes’ Epitome logica with some additions; his part\non natural philosophy combines works by Blemmydes with works by\nPachymeres and Michael of Ephesus; his part on the quadrivial\ndisciplines is identical with the Logic and Quadrivium by\nthe anonymous of 1007. \n\nA contemporary of Pachymeres was Sophonias, a\nConstantinopolitan monk and later Catholic convert, whose hybrid\nparaphrase of Aristotle’s De anima was mentioned in\nsection 1.2. On stylistic grounds the anonymously transmitted\nparaphrases of the Categories, the Prior\nAnalytics, the Sophistici elenchi, and the Parva\nnaturalia edited in CAG 23 and 5 may also be attributed\nto Sophonias. Even though these works are in themselves of limited\nphilosophical interest, it has been shown that Sophonias draws on John\nPhiloponus’ lost commentary on book 3 of the De\nanima (Van Riet 1965). \n\nOf more interest is the mostly anonymously transmitted paraphrase of\nthe Nicomachean Ethics edited in CAG 19 as the work\nof Heliodorus of Prusa. This attribution is clearly a\nhoax; in fact the only thing we know about the circumstances under\nwhich the work was composed is that it must have been before 1366,\nwhen the earliest manuscript is dated, and after the composition of\nEustratios’ commentary, on which it draws. It has recently been\nargued (by Trizio 2011) that it originated in the milieu around the\nformer emperor John Kantakouzenos (abdicated 1354). \n\nNot all Late Byzantine philosophical authors were content to write\ncompendia, paraphrases, and commentaries on the classical authors. One\nwho decided to write essays on natural philosophy in order to\ninvestigate the relevant questions independently of Aristotle and\nPlato was Nikephoros Choumnos\n(c. 1250/55–1327), a leading ﬁgure at the court of\nAndronikos II in the 1290s and 1300s. Choumnos’ main concern was\nwith elemental theory, cosmology, and psychology. Many of his essays\nseem to have been composed on the occasion of literary gatherings\n(theatra), some of which were presided over by the\nemperor. \n\nIt is typical of Choumnos’ approach that he seeks to argue\nphilosophically, that is by valid inference from principles and\ndefinitions that are universally accepted, for views that are already\ntheologically established. Thus he attempts to refute\nAristotle’s theory that the heavens are composed of a fifth,\nnaturally ungenerable and imperishable body, not by simply appealing\nto the Christian doctrine that the world was created at the beginning\nof time and persists only through the grace of its creator, but by\npointing out that Aristotle’s attempt to deduce his theory from the\nfact that the heavens have a circular movement fails, inasmuch as he\nhas only secured the premise that all simple bodies have simple\nmovements, not that all simple movements belong to simple bodies,\nwhich is what his argument requires. Likewise, Choumnos argues by\nelimination against the theory of pre-existing matter (which is how\nhe, following Aristotle, interprets the chōra of\nPlato’s Timaeus), and insists against the theory of\nseparate forms that if forms do not allow self-predication, they are\nnot participated in by individuals; but if they do, they are not\nuniversal and eternal, but individual and perishable. The bottom line\nis that matter and form are inseparable and simultaneously\ncreated. Another time he attacks the theory of recollection, which he\ntakes to entail the pre-existence of the soul, by flatly denying that\nknowledge can suffer destruction or, obviously, be revived, and\nstressing the fact that this follows from Plotinus’ (whom he\nconsiders to be his main opponent) view that the activities of the\nsoul are immortal. He even prides himself on having proved the\ndoctrine of the resurrection of the body on the basis of Plato’s\nviews on the migration of souls. \n\nOriginality of thought and expression was also striven for by\nChoumnos’ rival and adversary at court, Theodore\nMetochites (1270–1332). It is perhaps most clearly\nattained in his Sēmeiōseis gnōmikai\n(Sententious Notes), a collection of 120 essays on subjects as\ndiverse as the reasons for Aristotle’s obscurity and for\nPlato’s use of the dialogue form, the interrelations between\ndifferent faculties of soul, and the pros and cons of different\npolitical constitutions. A significant part of the essays are taken up\nby meditations on the transience of human life, not\ninfrequently bearing on the vicissitudes of Metochites’ own\nlife and career. He also lingered over many of these themes in his\norations, notably On Education. \n\nIn a more traditional vein, Metochites wrote paraphrases of all of\nAristotle’s writings on natural philosophy; his proudest\naccomplishment, however, was his monumental Introduction to\nthe study of Ptolemaic astronomy. The superiority of mathematics\n(including astronomy) to natural philosophy is in Metochites’\nview warranted by the higher degree of reality of mathematical objects,\nwhich he seems (especially in his hexameter poem On\nMathematics) to have conceived of as being ultimately derived by\nprocession from intelligible objects, even if he sometimes speaks of\nthem as the products of abstraction from sensibles. The two conceptions\nare probably intended to be complementary, as indeed they are in many\nNeoplatonic writers. \n\nMetochites’ student and intellectual heir, Nikephoros\nGregoras (1293/94–1360/61), began his career as an\nastronomer and ended it as a theological controversialist. Some of his\nletters and a few passages of his Roman History touch upon\nphilosophical subjects: especially noteworthy is the vehement criticism\nof Aristotle in the dialogue Phlorentius, ostensibly an\naccount of the author’s debate with Barlaam of\nCalabria (c. 1290–1348) in 1331–1332. As Gregoras\nnotes with disdain, Barlaam was well-versed in contemporary Latin\nscholasticism; but it was his knowledge in ancient Greek philosophy and\nmathematics (including astronomy) that aroused both admiration and\nhostility when he arrived at Constantinople in the 1320s. In his\nSolutions for George Lapithes he is largely concerned with\ndefending Aristotle against accusations of inconsistency with Plato as\nwell as with himself. In so doing he addresses issues of more profound\nimportance than Gregoras does in his Solutions for Helena\nPalaiologina, which deal principally with problems of natural\nphilosophy; but the Neoplatonic epistemology in Barlaam’s\nSolution 4 and especially his First Greek Letter,\naccording to which scientific knowledge rests on innate\n“substantial principles” in our souls, which reflect the\ncreative principles in the Divine Intellect, and thus indicate the\ntrue causes of the nature of things, is curiously inconsistent with\nthe theory expounded in his Anti-Latin Treatises, which\nstates that the universal principles in our souls, on which\ndemonstrative arguments are based, are completely derived from the\nexperience of particulars. \n\nBarlaam and Gregoras were both on the losing side in the Hesychast\nstrife, which raged between c. 1337 and 1351 and revolved around the\nquestion of theological method. The winner was Gregory\nPalamas (1296–1359), famous for his claim that even\nthough God’s substance (ousia) is necessarily concealed\nto us, we can have direct experience of his activities\n(energeiai). The first 29 of Palamas’ 150\nChapters attempt to put natural philosophy on a more secure\nfooting by placing facts about the world as a whole—in contrast\nto particular facts, such as astronomical phenomena—in the same\nepistemological category as facts about God and Man, which are only\nknowable through the teaching of the spirit. Thus Palamas expends\nconsiderable energy on denouncing the erroneous views of the Greek\nnatural philosophers, Platonists as well as Aristotelians. \n\nIn the last years of the Byzantine Empire, philosophical writers\ntended indeed to identify themselves as either Platonists or\nAristotelians, and to emphasize the disagreements existing between the\ntwo ancient authorities. This approach was very different from the\nharmonizing endeavors of the late antique commentators, and it was left\nas a legacy to Renaissance and early modern Aristotelianism and\nPlatonism. Its roots are to be found in the anti-Aristotelian\nsentiments of 14th-century authors such as Metochites and Gregoras, but\nit came into full blossom in the great controversy which started in\n1439, when George Gemistos Plethon (c.\n1360–1452) published his pamphlet De differentiis, and\nground to a halt after the Latin version of Cardinal\nBessarion’s (1403–1472) In\ncalumniatorem Platonis was printed thirty years later. \n\nPlethon’s pamphlet purported to show how inferior Aristotle was\nto Plato, in spite of being more admired especially in the Latin\nWest. Like Metochites before him, Plethon seems to have drawn on the\nMiddle Platonist Atticus for his criticisms, which cover every part of\nAristotle’s philosophy and end with a refutation of\nAristotle’s objections to the Theory of Forms. Aristotle was\nduly assisted by George (Gennadios) Scholarios (c.\n1405–after 1472), whose Contra Plethonem bears\ntestimony to a philosophical education that was clearly more Latin\nthan Greek. Of paramount concern to Gennadios was the repudiation of\nPlethon’s claim that Aristotle’s God is not creator of the\nworld. This is achieved inter alia by recourse to the\ntime-honored hypothesis of eternal creation. As his sobriquet\nsuggests, Gennadios was an extremely erudite man, who prided himself\non being a better Aristotelian commentator than his Byzantine\nforerunners precisely on account of his vast knowledge of the Latin\nliterature, including translations of Avicenna and Averroes. His\ncommentaries on Porphyry’s Isagoge and\nAristotle’s Categories and De interpretatione\nare the most extensive Byzantine ones on these works, and owe a great\ndeal, with respect to their content and form, to earlier and\ncontemporary works in Latin. Especially strong is the influence of\nThomas Aquinas, many of whose works Gennadios also translated, thus\ncontinuing the efforts of\nDemetrios (c. 1323/26–c. 1397/98) and\nProchoros (c. 1333/34–c. 1370/71)\nKydones in the preceding century. \n\nThe controversy dragged on with new contributions on Plato’s\nbehalf by Plethon and Michael Apostoles; and on\nAristotle’s by Theodore of Gaza, Andronikos\nKallistos, and George of Trebizond. All\nthese men were native Greek speakers; and except for Trebizond, they\nall wrote in their mother tongue. The importance of the controversy\nfor Renaissance philosophy is largely due to Bessarion, who tried, in\nthe work already mentioned, to give a fair hearing to both\nphilosophers (thus reverting to the traditional approach of\nharmonization), and whose systematic account of Platonism was\nunprecedented in the Latin literature. \n\nA few years after his appointment as patriarch in 1454 (thus after the\nfall of Constantinople), Scholarios gave orders for all existing\ncopies of Plethon’s Book of Laws to be destroyed. It is clear\nfrom the remaining fragments that this work constituted Plethon’s\nprescription for a happy life for humankind, advocating an ethics and\na politics inspired by Plato himself as well as by Middle Platonic,\nNeoplatonic, and Stoic writers, and propagating a philosophically\nrefined form of the old Olympian religion. It has been claimed (by\nTambrun 2007 and Siniossoglou 2011) that Plethon rejected the\ntranscendence of the highest god (Zeus), and that his theology\ntherefore, in contrast to both the Christian and the Neoplatonic\nconsensus, was entirely positive, but this appears dubious (see\nHladký 2014). One surviving chapter of the Book of\nLaws (De fato) argues, both from the nature of causation\nand from the assumption that the gods have foreknowledge, that all\nevents are determined by fate. According to Plethon, this is\ncompatible with freedom, not in the sense that human beings are not\nruled by anything, but in the sense that they are ruled by their own\nintellect: being free is simply submitting to the decree of Zeus.\nDivine punishment is justified as a method for teaching human beings\nto become free. A combination of Platonic and Stoic influences is also\nmanifest in another short treatise by Plethon, On\nVirtues. \n\nThe question of the immortality of the soul is a potential point of\nconflict between Orthodox Christian doctrine and Byzantine natural\nphilosophy. Byzantine natural philosophy, like its late antique\npredecessor, was largely based on the works of Aristotle. In Book 2 of\nthe De anima, Aristotle defines the soul as “the first\nactuality of a natural body which potentially has life.” He\nhimself draws the conclusion that the soul must be inseparable from the\nbody. It seems clear, too, that on this view the soul cannot survive\nthe moment of the body’s death. Still, Aristotle leaves open the\npossibility that there may be some part of the soul that is not the\nactuality of a body, and therefore may be separable. As he explains in\nBook 3 of the De anima, the mental faculty by which we think\nand form beliefs, nous, variously translated as\n“mind” or “intellect”, in fact lacks a bodily\norgan. In one of the most intriguing and hotly debated passages of\nancient philosophy, De anima Book 3, chapter 5, Aristotle\nintroduces the notion of a kind of intellect that he describes as\nproductive and active, and this kind of intellect, according to him, is\nnot only separable from the body but is “alone immortal and\neternal.” The question, then, is whether the eternal life of this\nproductive and active intellect is enough to ensure survival after\ndeath for the individual human soul. \n\nAristotle’s definition of the soul presented a formidable\nchallenge to Byzantine Christians and late antique pagan philosophers\nalike. As Theodore Metochites explained in his Sēmeiōseis\ngnōmikai (3.6–7), \n\nAmong the ancient authors who held the view that Aristotle denied\nany kind of immortality for the individual human soul we find Alexander\nof Aphrodisias, who famously identified the productive intellect of\nDe anima 3.5 with the first mover. Christian authors such as\nHippolytus of Rome, Tatian, Ps.-Justin Martyr, Gregory of Nyssa, and\nTheodoret also claimed that Aristotle believed the soul to be wholly\nmortal, and they all condemned him for it. Perhaps it is not so\nsurprising that the fiercely anti-Aristotelian 2nd-century Platonist\nAtticus did the same; but Aristotle’s definition was also\ncriticized by Plotinus and Porphyry, since it seemed to suggest that\nthe soul was not a separable substance. \n\nOne may presume that Metochites’ attribution of this view to\n“the multitude” expresses contempt. In fact he seems to\nhave sided with “the opposite view”, namely, \n\nThis was the standard view. Among those who maintained that\nAristotle did assign immortality to at least some part of the\nindividual soul are all the late antique commentators whose\ncommentaries on the De anima are extant. \n\nOf the Neoplatonists, John Philoponus, whose commentary was highly\ninfluential throughout the Greek Middle Ages though virtually unknown\nin the Latin West, held that Aristotle agreed with Plato that of the\nthree kinds of soul (1) the vegetative soul alone is wholly\ninseparable from the body; (2) the irrational soul (comprising the\nfaculties of imagination and sense-perception as well as appetite and\ndesire) is separable from the gross body, though inseparable from\nthe pneuma, and thus mortal; and (3) the rational soul, the\nsubstance of which transcends all body, but some of whose activities\nare bound up with the human body (as those of the pilot are bound up\nwith the ship), is wholly separable and thus immortal. It seems clear\nthat “rational soul” in this context is synonymous with\n“intellect” in the Aristotelian texts. Ps.-Simplicius (=\n?Priscian) takes a similar view, but in Ps.-Philoponus’ (=\n?Stephanus’) commentary, the scheme is altered so as to allow\nimmortality even to the two perishable kinds of soul (“for they\nperish not in their capacity of soul but in their capacity of being in\na body”). Thus Plato’s dictum that “all soul is\nimmortal” (Phdr. 245c6) according to Ps.-Philoponus\nholds true, even though intellect is the only part of soul which is\nimmortal and eternal, as Aristotle says. The interpretation\nof Phaedrus 245c6 as referring to “both rational,\nirrational and vegetative” soul is ascribed to Numenius (f. 47)\nand repudiated by Philoponus (In DA 9.35–10.1). What\nall the Neoplatonic commentators took for granted is that the\nproductive intellect introduced in De anima 3.5 is part of\nthe individual human soul. This must be so, since in their view\nthe De anima is a treatise on the human soul. \n\nThe interpretative tradition of the Neoplatonic commentators\nstretches well beyond the 11th century, when John Italos defended what\nhe took to be Aristotle’s position, namely that rational\nsoul alone is immortal, against Ps.-Philoponus’ interpretation of\nthe above-mentioned Platonic dictum (quaestiones nos. 36;\n50). This is also what Sophonias argued at the turn of the\n14th century in his paraphrase of De anima 3.2. Thus both he\nand Italos conformed to the same scheme as Philoponus and\nPs.-Simplicius. In the same vein, Nikephoros Blemmydes, in his De\nanima (c. 1263), made extensive use of the analogy of the pilot of\na ship as interpreted by the Neoplatonists. First he used\nit to show that Aristotle thought the rational soul was separable and\nimmortal; then he developed it into an image of the turmoil experienced\nby the rational soul as long as it is connected with the body. And in\nthe early 12th century, Michael of Ephesus pointed out, when commenting\non Aristotle’s dictum that the activity of the better part of us\nis more serious, that the intellect which is part of us comes into its\nown only after being separated from the body, which shows, he says,\n“that those who claim that Aristotle was of the opinion that the\nsoul is mortal were fundamentally wrong” (In NE 10,\n576.25–33). \n\nHaving thus briefly summarized the arguments both of those who claim\nthat Aristotle did not believe in the immortality of the soul and of\nthose who maintain that he did, Metochites adds an observation of his\nown in support of the latter’s view: \n\nIn this passage Metochites seems to contend that Aristotle’s\nargument against self-movement in Physics 7.1 and 8.5 entails\nthe proposition that “what moves itself will not cease to do\nso,” which is used as one of the premises of an argument for the\nimmortality of the soul. This latter argument is apparently strongly\ninspired by the first part of the proof of immortality in\nSocrates’ palinode in Plato’s Phaedrus\n(245c5–8). It seems to be an “ontological” kind of\nargument. That is to say, it attempts to show that the (eternal)\nexistence of the soul follows from its nature. The soul’s nature\nis defined precisely as its movement, whereby it moves itself. The idea\nis obviously that since the mover and the moved thing, if they are\nidentical, cannot be disconnected, there will always be sufficient\nreason that the moved thing is moved (because there will always be a\nmover connected with it) and that the mover causes movement (because\nthere will always be something there for it to move). Now, what seems\nto be the other premise of this argument, namely the proposition that\nthe soul moves itself, is refuted by Aristotle in De anima\n1.3–4 on the strength of the very proposition established in\nPhysics 7.1 and 8.5 and cited by Metochites in the preceding\nparagraph, namely that movement is necessarily an irreflexive relation.\nThe question is, then: what reason, if any, can Metochites have for\nthinking that the proposition that self-movement is eternal follows\nfrom (an argument containing) the proposition that self-movement does\nnot exist? \n\nIt may be noted that Metochites deduces this proposition in two\nsteps. First he says that it follows from Aristotle’s\nview—namely, (A) that movement is an asymmetrical relation\nbetween two contiguous entities, one of which causes movement and one\nof which is moved—(1) that for any movement, if the moving and\nthe moved parts are disconnected, the movement will cease. Then he adds\nthe further inference (2) that if the moving and the moved parts are\nidentical, the moving part will not cease to cause movement. Since (2)\nclearly does not follow either from (A) or from (1), but does seem to\nfollow from the converse of (1)—that for any movement,\nonly if the moving and the moved parts are disconnected, the\nmovement will cease—one may wonder whether Metochites may have\nfallen prey to the fallacia consequentis: if (if p\nthen q) then (if not-p then not-q). \n\nEven if we cannot definitively clear him of this charge, we may be\nable to point to extenuating circumstances. The Neoplatonic\ncommentators, too, espouse the ontological argument for the immortality\nof the soul. They also accept Aristotle’s analysis of movement as\nnecessarily an irreflexive relation; they believe, however, that\n“movement” in this context refers exclusively to physical\nmovement, and thus that the analysis does not concern the self-movement\nof the soul. That is to say, they affirm the compatibility of the\npremises of the ontological argument with Aristotle’s analysis of\nmovement. They do not try to deduce the former from the latter. That is\nwhy it is interesting to find in Proclus’ Elements of\nTheology (14, 16.15–23) an attempt to deduce the existence\nof a self-moved soul à la Plato from that of an unmoved\nintellect à la Aristotle. It is not clear that it is a\nsuccessful attempt; but it may still have predisposed some of\nProclus’ readers to understand Aristotle’s cosmological\nargument in Physics 8.5 as a proof of the existence of both an\nunmoved mover and (by implication) a self-moved soul. At any rate, if\nthis is how Metochites understood it, his suggestion that the premises\nof the ontological argument for the immortality of the soul are implied\nby Aristotle’s analysis of movement may seem less\nfar-fetched. \n\nThere is plenty of textual evidence that the attempt of Neoplatonist\ncommentators of Late Antiquity to reconcile the doctrines of Plato and\nAristotle on the issue of universals was closely followed in Byzantium\nby prominent thinkers like John Italos, Eustratios of Nicaea,\nNikephoros Blemmydes, Nikephoros Choumnos and George (Gennadios)\nScholarios. More specifically, Byzantine philosophers as a rule adopted\nthe Neoplatonist commentators’ three ways of understanding genera\n(and species) terms as referring to: \n\nThese three types of genera are the ones first introduced by the\n5th-century Neoplatonist Ammonius in his commentary on Porphyry’s\nIsagoge; they are also discussed in Elias’ and\nDavid’s commentaries on the same work, in Olympiodorus’\nProlegomena, and in Philoponus’ commentary on\nAristotle’s Categories. And it is the same three ways of\nunderstanding genera (and species) terms that are discussed by Arethas\nin his commentary on Porphyry’s Isagoge, but are also\nhinted at in Photios’ treatise Various Questions for\nDiscussion on Genera and Species (= Amphil. 77) as well\nas in Psellos’ paraphrase of Aristotle’s De\ninterpretatione. \n\nThis attempt to bring together the three ways of understanding\ngenera (and species) terms has been labeled as “conceptual”\nor “moderate realism” (Benakis 1982), but it has also been\npresented as a nominalist or conceptualist position (Joannou 1954;\nLloyd 1990). In view of this disagreement, it may be interesting to\ntake a closer look at the position the Byzantines advocated and to\ncompare it with that propounded by the Neoplatonist commentators. In\nparticular, it is important to focus on John Italos’ views on\ngenera, since he repeatedly discusses them at great length in his\nQuaestiones quodlibetales and there seems to be no earlier\nindications of any more vivid or systematic interest in this issue. \n\nIn quaestio 5, for instance, Italos talks about the same\nthree types of genera in the same order, but a certain detail of his\naccount proves to be quite intriguing. Italos, too, regards the genera\nbefore the particulars as the causes and paradigms of perceptible\nindividuals, which are not predicates, are separate from them, and\nexist in God’s mind, perfectly accommodating in this way the\nrequirements of Christian dogma. But then he presents the genera in the\nparticulars and the genera after the particulars in a manner which\nseems to differ from Ammonius’ account, for he seems to treat\nthem as two subdivisions of one class of genera, which is distinguished\nfrom the genera before the particulars by being later-born\n(hysterogenē) than the perceptible individuals, capable\nof being predicated of them, inseparable from them, and acquired by our\nmind by abstraction. What makes the genera in the particulars differ\nfrom the genera after the particulars, according to Italos, is the fact\nthat they are inseparable from the particulars in which they are: they\nare not predicated of many particulars, but only of the one particular\nwhich participates in them. The animal in Socrates is not the same as\nthe animal in Plato. On the other hand, the genera after the\nparticulars are predicated of many particulars, and it is one and the\nsame genus that is predicated both of all the particulars together and\nof every single one of them separately. \n\nDoes this mean that Italos understands the genera in the particulars\nas referring to forms which are particular? In other words, does this\nmean that he interprets Aristotle’s immanent forms as particular\nrather than universal? The pedigree of such an interpretation is not\nnegligible; both Proclus in his Elements of Theology as well\nas his teacher Syrianus in his commentary on Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics viewed the immanent forms as particulars, without\nimplying in any way that on this point they disagreed with Aristotle.\nAnd although Ammonius is not clear on this subject, there is no reason\nto believe that he was not here in agreement with these other\nNeoplatonists. This, of course, does not mean that such an\ninterpretation of Aristotle’s theory has to be the right one. But\nit is reasonable to think that, by Italos’ time, treating\nAristotle’s immanent forms as particulars was an acceptable, if\nnot the standard, interpretation. \n\nMost importantly, though, the point on which Italos seems to differ\nfrom Ammonius’ account of the three types of genera is that he\nconsiders not only the genera after the particulars as acquired by our\nmind by abstraction but also the genera in the particulars as such. For\nit seems that the genera after the particulars are acquired by our mind\nby abstraction of the common characteristics of perceptible\nindividuals, just like in Ammonius’ commentary, while the genera\nin the particulars are acquired by our mind by abstraction of the\nparticular form from the matter involved in each particular. Therefore,\nthe genera in the particulars do seem to represent, on Italos’\nview, what they represent for Proclus and Syrianus, namely immanent\nforms that are particular. \n\nBut if both the genera after the particulars and the genera in the\nparticulars are acquired by our mind by abstraction, does this mean\nthat, for Italos, they are not beings? On the contrary, Italos offers a\nwhole series of arguments to support the thesis that the genera are\nbeings (quaestiones 3, 19, 31). For this purpose he draws what\nhe takes to be Aristotle’s distinction between two senses of\nsomething’s being incorporeal (quaestio 8): \n\nThus, according to Italos’ interpretation of Aristotle, the\ngenera are incorporeal in a weak sense, since they are not strictly\nspeaking incorporeal but depend on a body for subsisting. Indeed, this\nis the sense that Italos himself adopts in his understanding of the\ngenera as incorporeal; genera are incorporeal per accidens and\nnot per se, because they are incorporeal insofar as they are\nin the human soul, while at the same time they are corporeal by\nparticipation (kata methexin) insofar as they subsist in the\nparticulars. And the genera that he has in mind in such contexts are\nobviously the genera in the particulars and the genera after the\nparticulars. \n\nBut if the genera are incorporeal beings, is there a special sense\nin which they are said to be beings? Italos often makes use of another\ndistinction, which is a commonplace in Platonic texts from Plotinus to\nSimplicius, but seems to have its origins even earlier; namely, the\ndistinction between something subsisting and something depending on\nmere thought. According to Italos (quaestio 19), things that\ndo not subsist (anupostata) but depend on mere thought are not\nbeings. As for things that subsist, he distinguishes between two\ndifferent kinds of beings; namely, between beings that subsist per\nse, which he calls subsistences (hupostaseis), and beings\nthat subsist in something else (enupostata). Subsistences are\nprior by perception, they are particulars and are for the most part\nbodies, whereas beings that subsist in something else are prior by\nknowledge, they are incorporeal, they are predicates shared by many\nthings, and they are thoughts (noēmata /\ndianoēmata). Italos’ terminology here clearly shows\nthe influence of the Christian Fathers, and in particular of John of\nDamascus, who in his Dialectica draws just this distinction\nbetween subsistences, things that subsist in something else, and things\nthat do not subsist. According to Italos, therefore, both subsistences\nand beings that subsist in something else are beings, and thus do not\ndepend on mere thought. Italos distinguishes these two kinds of beings\nfrom the standard examples of things that do not subsist, i.e.,\ngoat-stags and centaurs, as well as from his own examples of many-eyed\nmen and four-headed horses; for all these are, on his view, nothing but\nfabrications of the human mind and products of our imagination\n(phantasmata). On the other hand, it also is important not to\noverlook the difference between subsistences and beings that subsist in\nsomething else. Although the first subsist per se, the latter\nare thoughts that subsist in something else. \n\nHence, Italos’ position on the three types of genera could be\nsummarized as follows: All types of genera are incorporeal beings, the\ngenera before the particulars are subsistences whereas the genera in\nthe particulars as well as the genera after the particulars are beings\nthat subsist in something else. That is to say, although only God,\nGod’s thoughts, and the perceptible individuals exist in the\nstrong sense as subsistences, all types of genera are beings; they may\nbe beings in a different sense, but they all are beings and not\nconstructions of our mind devoid of reality. For this reason, it would\nperhaps be misleading to label Italos as a “nominalist”,\nsince he does not defend the view that the in rebus and\npost res genera are mere expressions, but it would also be\nmisleading to label him as a “realist”, since he does not\nthink that the in rebus and post res genera are\nsubsistences. Presumably, it is this difficulty of pinning down\nItalos’ position that has led to the introduction of intermediate\nlabels such as “conceptualist” and “conceptual”\nor “moderate realist”.","contact.mail":"ierokaterina@phs.uoa.gr","contact.domain":"phs.uoa.gr"},{"date.published":"2008-09-08","date.changed":"2018-09-16","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/byzantine-philosophy/","author1":"Katerina Ierodiakonou","author2":"Börje Bydén","entry":"byzantine-philosophy","body.text":"\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this article, Byzantine philosophy is the study\nand teaching of traditional subjects of philosophy in the Greek\nlanguage between c. 730 and 1453. The second half of this delineation\nconstrues the attribute “Byzantine” rather narrowly, in\nthat it excludes the whole period between c. 330 and c. 730, which is\ncommonly referred to by historians as “Early Byzantine”\n(and also leaves out of account philosophical activity in the minority\nlanguages of the Byzantine Empire). The main reason for focusing on\nthe philosophical works after c. 730 is that Early Byzantine\nphilosophy is usually covered in accounts of late Ancient Philosophy,\nof which it is a seamless continuation. The first half of the\ndelineation should not be taken to imply any particular view regarding\nthe “true face of Byzantine philosophy”, although we do\nthink that it is by being related in certain ways to the philosophical\ntradition that a written work is eligible to be classed as\nphilosophical. This tradition was formed in antiquity. Hence, the\nworks discussed here will typically be concerned with questions\ninherited from ancient philosophy.\n\n\n\nWe have tried to impose a provisional borderline between Byzantine\nphilosophy and other areas which are so closely related to Byzantine\nphilosophy as to be sometimes inseparable from it. Most importantly,\nwe have tried to demarcate our subject matter from that of Byzantine\ntheology, not because we believe that an account in which the\nreligious dimension is largely ignored will be sufficient to grasp\nByzantine intellectual history in its organic entirety, but because we\nthink that a clearer conception of the “purely”\nphilosophical part of Byzantine intellectual history is both desirable\nin itself and necessary for the understanding of the whole. This may\nseem to lead us straight towards an episodic account, concentrating on\na few solitary thinkers on the fringe of Byzantine intellectual\nhistory. In order to avoid this we have chosen not to place very heavy\ndemands on the originality of the works to be included. Our main\nconcern has been to describe the typical features of the philosophical\ntradition in Byzantium, rather than to highlight the rare instances\nwhen innovative views and arguments were put forward. For further discussion of the methodology of the history of Byzantine philosophy, see Kapriev (2006), Trizio (2007), Golitsis (2011), and Gutas and Siniossoglou (2017).\n\n\n\nThe main part of the article is divided into two sections. Section\n1 attempts to situate Byzantine philosophy in the general context of\nByzantine culture and education, and to give a brief survey of the more\nimportant philosophical authors and their works. For Section 2, we have\nmade a selection of two especially significant topics in the fields of\nnatural philosophy and metaphysics. This arrangement allows us to look\na bit more closely at the form and content of some Byzantine\nphilosophical views and arguments without giving up the ambition to be\nreasonably historically comprehensive.\n\n\n\nOne conspicuous feature of Byzantine literary culture in general, and\nthe study of philosophy in particular, is its relative continuity with\nancient Greek literary culture. In Byzantium, the treasures of this\nculture never had to be discovered, as they were in the 9th-century\nArab East, or even rediscovered, as in the 12th-century Latin West. At\nall times, Homer’s Iliad remained the most important\ntextbook for secondary education. Still, this continuity is not\nabsolute: considerable parts of the literary heritage were pushed into\noblivion in periods of cultural decline, some of which were eventually\nlost, whereas others survived to attract new attention during the\nsubsequent periods of intensified activity. The most important periods\nof intensified activity, so far as the history of philosophy is\nconcerned, are: (1) the late Phrygian to early Macedonian\n(842–959), when ancient philosophical texts were saved for\nposterity by the production of new copies in minuscule script; (2) the\nlate Macedonian to early Komnenan (1042–1143); and (3) the early\nPalaiologan (1259–1341). Each of these periods was ushered in by\nthe establishment of an Imperial School of Philosophy in\nConstantinople. Apart from the Imperial Schools, private tutorial\nplayed an important part in higher education, some teachers attaining\nconsiderable fame, for example Nikephoros Blemmydes\n(1197–c. 1269), Gregory of Cyprus (1241–1290), Nikephoros\nGregoras (1293/94–1360/61) and George Gemistos Plethon\n(c. 1360–1452). In the Komnenan (1182–1204) and\nPalaiologan (1259–1453) periods, the Patriarchal School loomed\nlarge, at times existing side by side with the Imperial School, but\napparently specially designated for the education of the clergy. \n\nThere was never in Byzantium anything resembling the autonomous\nuniversities of the Latin West. Higher education was designed to train\nofficials of the state and church, not masters of the arts and\nsciences. The Greek-speaking world was small and decreasing, and there\nwas scarcely any demand in it for very specialized scholarship.\nMoreover, theology never developed into the kind of systematic\ndiscipline it became in the Latin West, and logic was never\nacknowledged as an ancillary discipline (although it was taught at the\nPatriarchal School, at least in the Palaiologan period). All this\ncontributed to the prevalence in Byzantine higher education of an\nencyclopedic ideal, and to the preference of rhetorical over\nphilosophical studies. \n\nThere is reason to think that the task facing Leo the Mathematician,\nas he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Magnaura School\nin the mid-9th century, was to teach Aristotelian logic. In fact,\nelementary Aristotelian logic and natural philosophy combined with\nelementary mathematics would always form the standard philosophical\ncurriculum in Byzantium. Perhaps the range of courses was slightly\nexpanded in the late 1040s to the 1070s, when Michael Psellos and John\nItalos were Consuls of the Philosophers, but the standard curriculum\nwas certainly back in force at the Imperial School under George\nAkropolites in the 1260s and early 1270s. The logic texts usually\nstudied were Porphyry’s Isagoge as well as\nAristotle’s Categories, De interpretatione,\nPrior Analytics 1.1–7 and Sophistici elenchi\n1–7. Periodically, there seems to have been significant interest\nalso in the Posterior Analytics, since we have no fewer than\nfour extant Byzantine commentaries on the second book — in\naddition to the ancient paraphrase by Themistius and the commentary by\npseudo-Philoponus — which probably were intended to supplement\nPhiloponus’ commentary on the first book. In natural philosophy,\nextracts from Aristotle’s Physics, De generatione\net corruptione and Meteorology would be read, whereas\nthe mathematics course consisted mainly of Nicomachus’\nIntroductio arithmetica and the first six books of\nEuclid’s Elements. In many cases, students would replace\nsome or all of these texts with compendia such as the widely circulated\nEpitome logica and Epitome physica by Nikephoros\nBlemmydes, or the Logic and Quadrivium by the anonymous of\n1007 (‘Anonymus Heiberg’)—or indeed John of\nDamascus’ Dialectica. \n\nIt deserves to be noted that before the 12th century, the whole\nByzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries dealt exclusively with\nthe works on logic. No doubt this reflects the needs of the\neducational sector at the time. Natural philosophy in the\n7th–11th centuries is only represented by elementary compendia\nsuch as the ones by Symeon Seth (mid- to late-11th century). There is\na commentary on the\nPhysics attributed in some manuscripts (and in Benakis’\n2008 edition) to Michael Psellos, but recent research has plausibly\nsuggested that this is really the work of the late-13th-century\nscholar George Pachymeres (Golitsis 2007).  If the range of subjects\ncovered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades\nafter 1118 is much greater, this may be due to the initiative of the\nprincess Anna Komnene, who seems to have commissioned a number of\nscholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of\nAristotle. This was an exceptional enterprise: it would and could\nhardly have been undertaken had it not been preceded by a period of\nstrong interest in philosophy; but it left very few traces in the\nlearned activities of the immediately following decades. \n\nObviously, there were other forums than the schools for philosophical\ndiscourse. Photios seems to have hosted some kind of literary salon in\nhis home in the 850s or 860s, and similar gatherings,\nso-called theatra, where philosophical and other essays were\nread and discussed, constituted a central element in early Palaiologan\ncultural life (see Gaul 2011). \n\nSince Byzantine education was so preoccupied with rhetoric, it is\nperhaps no wonder that we find a rather large diversity of literary\nforms employed for philosophical purposes by Byzantine writers.\nObviously, this diversity to some extent reflects the various needs of\neducational and scholarly practice. But there are many literary forms\nthat do not readily lend themselves to use in such contexts; these, then, will\nhave been cultivated for other reasons. \n\nOne such form is the dialogue. The philosophical dialogue endured\nthroughout the whole Byzantine era, even if perhaps it did not flourish\nas abundantly as in the contemporary West. By and large, it seems\npossible to divide the extant specimens into two subcategories: Plato\npastiche and Lucian pastiche. In the latter subcategory belongs the\nearly 12th-century satire Timarion, which offers some amusing\nmockery of contemporary or near-contemporary philosophy professors like\nMichael Psellos, John Italos, and Theodore of Smyrna. The elenctic\ndialogue in Plato’s style seems to have been considered\nparticularly useful for polemical purposes. Many dialogues in this\nsubcategory have a more theological than philosophical content, but\nTheodore Prodromos’ (c. 1100–1170) relatively good-humoured\nXenedemus, or, Predicables, and Nikephoros Gregoras’\n(1293/94–1360/61) rather more virulent Phlorentius, or, On\nWisdom are two conspicuous exceptions. A particularly intriguing\nexample is Hermippus, or, On Astrology: this attempt at a\nreconciliation between the belief in astral influence over the natural\nworld and the Christian doctrines of divine providence and human free\nwill is one of three anonymous dialogues, probably from the\nearly 14th century, which have been variously attributed to Nikephoros\nGregoras, John Aktouarios and John Katrones (or Katrarios) (Hohlweg\n1995). \n\nPhilosophical treatises, vaguely defined as prose monologues on\nparticular themes arguing personal views, are found predominantly from\nthe three most philosophically productive periods (see section 1.1).\nThey were composed by numerous authors and for various purposes, some\nof them, no doubt, strictly pedagogical or scholarly; but we will here\nonly mention two examples of a slightly more topical and literary\ncharacter. The philosophical essays (Logoi) of Nikephoros\nChoumnos (c. 1250/55–1327) are written in a personal but hardly\noriginal style—much in keeping with the views propounded in\nthem—which does not always correspond to the author’s\nprofessed ideal of clarity. Those of Theodore Metochites\n(Sēmeiōseis gnōmikai, c. 1326) represent a\nfurther move in the direction of essays in the strict and narrow sense.\nInspired by Plutarch and anticipating Montaigne, Metochites seems to\nhave conceived of them as adding up to a ‘self-portrait as a\nphilosopher’, theorizing about, and obviously trying to put into\npractice, the proper style for philosophy. \n\nMetochites discussed philosophy in some of his orations\n(Logoi) and some of his hexameter poetry. Dodecasyllabic verse\nwas also put to use, notably by John Tzetzes (c. 1110–1180), who\nwrote a 1700-line paraphrase of Porphyry’s Isagoge. The\nByzantines are also known for having enthusiastically cultivated the\nart of writing letters, in which they occasionally dealt with\nphilosophical questions (e.g., Michael Psellos, Letter to\nXiphilinos; Theodore Prodromos, On ‘Great’ and\n‘Small’). \n\nTurning to those literary forms that can be assumed to have had an\neducational or scholarly purpose, the kind of texts that bring us most\nclosely into contact with the daily reality of philosophy classes are\nundoubtedly the collections of questions and answers that have been\nhanded down from the 1040s to 1070s, the most well-known of which is\nperhaps the Quaestiones quodlibetales by John Italos (c.\n1025–after 1082). \n\nA very well-represented philosophical genre is the compendium. Most of\nthese cover only a part of philosophy, like the logic compendium by\nJohn Chortasmenos (c. 1370–1436/37), the Quadrivium by\nGeorge Pachymeres (1242–c. 1310), or the Logic and\nQuadrivium by the anonymous of 1007 (‘Anonymus\nHeiberg’). Some of them attempt universality, like\nPachymeres’ paraphrase-compendium of Aristotle’s\nphilosophical writings (the Philosophia), or indeed Joseph\nRhakendytes’ (died 1330) Encyclopedia, which also\nincluded rhetoric and medicine. As to the question of why the\nByzantines produced compendia, there can be little doubt that they\nmainly did so for educational purposes. Most of the compendia are\nwholly or partly concerned with logic, the most basic subject in the\nphilosophical curriculum. They do not contain detailed comments for\npeople already initiated in the subtleties of Aristotelian logic;\nrather, they are introductory texts that do not presuppose any\nsignificant knowledge of the subject.  \n\nA large proportion of the Byzantine philosophical texts consist of\ncommentaries on ancient authorities—in fact, almost invariably\nAristotle. The only Plato commentary from the period after c. 730 is\nGeorge Pachymeres’ supplement to Proclus on the last 24 pages of\nthe Parmenides. These commentaries are not, however, all made\naccording to the same pattern. A few main categories can be discerned,\nand even within some of these categories, there is considerable\nvariation. The most basic type of commentary is (a) simply a\ncollection of scholia or notes, usually transmitted in the margin of\nthe Aristotelian text. The individual scholia of such a collection may\nbe the work of an indeterminate number of scholars. An example is\nArethas’ scholia on the Isagoge, which draws on many\nearlier commentaries, some of which are now lost. It is Arethas’\ncommentary in the sense that he copied, and possibly collected and\nedited, the scholia in his Aristotle manuscript; in terms of\nauthorship, however, it is a product of mass collaboration. Next, (b)\nthe collection may be provided with an introduction dealing with\npreliminary questions. Rules for the composition of such introductions\nwere established by the Alexandrian commentators on Porphyry and\nAristotle in the 5th–7th centuries. The best examples in the\nperiod after c. 730 of collections of scholia with introductions are\nprobably the commentaries on Porphyry’s and Aristotle’s\nlogical works by Leo Magentenos (late 12th or early to mid-13th\ncentury). Further, (c) the notes can be integrated in a running\ncommentary, so as to form a quasi-independent whole, each new section\nintroduced by a lemma from the text. This is the standard type of\nso-called ‘exegetical commentary’ typified by Alexander of\nAphrodisias and cultivated in Byzantine times by Michael of Ephesus\nand Eustratios of Nicaea in the early 12th century. (d) The\nAlexandrian 6th–7th-century commentaries are sometimes divided\ninto more or less even chunks (praxeis), each starting with a\nlemma followed by a general explanation of its meaning\n(theōria), and then proceeding to comments on particular\npoints (lexis). While there are no clear-cut examples of this\ntype of commentary from Middle or Late Byzantium, its influence can be\ntraced, for instance, in Eustratios’ commentary on Posterior\nAnalytics 2. (e) An even more advanced form is represented by\nGeorge (Gennadios) Scholarios’ commentaries, which, in the\nmanner of contemporary Latin works, are divided into\n‘lessons’ (anagnōseis = lectiones),\neach of which is subdivided into an introduction, a broad analysis of\nthe text into sections, a detailed analysis with interpretations of\nparticular points, and finally ‘investigations’\n(zētēmata = quaestiones). \n\nThe genre of Aristotelian paraphrase, that is, adaptations in which\nAristotle’s text is rephrased, reorganized, and amplified or\npruned, as need be, in order to make it more easily understood, was\nallegedly invented by Themistius in the mid-4th century, revived by\nMichael Psellos in the mid-11th century, and further developed by\nSophonias and others in the late 13th to early 14th centuries. It is a\ncurious fact that the only periods from which we have dated paraphrases\nof Aristotelian works are precisely these three. In addition, there is\nan Arabic paraphrase that may have been based on a lost Greek\nparaphrase, which must in that case have been composed in the late 6th\nor 7th century (D’Ancona 2001). Works of uncertain date include\nthe paraphrase of the Nicomachean Ethics printed in\nCAG 19 as the work of Heliodorus of Prusa (perhaps mid-14th cent.: see\nsection 1.3). Sophonias consciously tried to blend elements of\n‘exegetical commentary’ with his paraphrase of the De\nanima, in order to be able to preserve more of Aristotle’s\noriginal wording. George Pachymeres effected another kind of hybrid\nparaphrase by organizing his Philosophia like a compendium,\nwhich deals with a given subject, rather than a commentary or a\nparaphrase, which deals with a given text. \n\nNot only Aristotle’s works were paraphrased; there are\nChristianizing paraphrases of Proclus’ Three Treatises\non Providence (the latter have since been lost in the original\nGreek) by Isaac Sebastokrator (1093–after 1152) and of\nEpictetus’ Encheiridion (no fewer than three of them,\nall of uncertain date; one of them, composed and provided with a\ncommentary no later than 960, when the oldest manuscript was copied,\nseems to have enjoyed considerable popularity in the 13th and 14th\ncenturies: Boter 1999, 197–256). One may also note a paraphrase\nof Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos sometimes ascribed to Proclus,\nwritten before the end of the 10th century (Bydén 2003,\n352). \n\nOur brief survey of the philosophical production in Byzantium starts\nin the 9th century with the work of the patriarch of Constantinople,\nPhotios (c. 810–after 893), though there is\nevidence of elementary teaching of logic and ethics in the 7th and 8th\ncenturies, during the period of Iconoclasm. The most important\nphilosophical work from this period is the Dialectica, the\nfirst part of John of Damascus’ (c.\n675–749) widely influential Source of Knowledge, which\ndraws mainly on the late antique commentators on Porphyry’s\nIsagoge and Aristotle’s logical works. Unfortunately, the\nonly surviving works by Leo the Mathematician\n(c. 790–after 869), who taught Aristotelian logic at the\nMagnaura School in Constantinople, established soon after the end of\nIconoclasm, are some notes in manuscripts containing Platonic\ndialogues. \n\nBut it is undoubtedly with Photios that we first encounter in\nByzantine times a large-scale revival of the study of antiquity and a\nprofound interest in the texts of ancient philosophers. Photios is\nfamous mainly for his Bibliotheke, a vast compilation of\nancient Greek literature, and a Lexicon, in which he collected\nnotable words and expressions. He also taught Aristotelian logic and\nwrote, for this purpose, a series of small essays on Aristotle’s\nCategories, which are included in the Amphilochia,\nan unsystematic collection of texts on theological and philosophical\ntopics. In these and other essays, Photios engages in a critical\ndiscussion of some of the most central theses in ancient philosophy,\nsuch as Plato’s conception of forms, whose capacity to function\nas predicates he rejects, and Aristotle’s distinction between\nprimary and secondary substances, which he thinks entails that\n‘substance’ is an ambiguous term. \n\nDuring this “first Byzantine Renaissance”, as the period\nhas sometimes been characterized, the archbishop of\nCaesarea, Arethas (c. 850–932/44) also\ncommented on Aristotle’s Categories and\nPorphyry’s Isagoge (cf. section 1.2). He is better\nknown, however, for having been instrumental in the transmission of\nancient texts, in particular the Platonic corpus. He commissioned the\ntranscription of a complete copy of Plato’s works to which he added\nmarginal notes; the first part of his Plato text is extant as the\nfamous Clarkianus 39 manuscript in the Bodleian Library of Oxford. \n\nIn the mid-11th to early 12th centuries, there is a significant\ndevelopment from the widely humanistic character of Photios’ and\nArethas’ interests towards a new understanding of the\nphilosophical enterprise. The philosopher is now regarded as someone\nwith a hard-earned knowledge in all branches of learning, who forms his\nown views on the philosophical topics discussed by the ancients, and\nmoreover as someone who is interested in applying the philosophical\ncategories to various problems in theology or in everyday affairs. \n\nMichael Psellos (1018–1078) was one of\nthe most erudite and intriguing figures of the Byzantine Middle Ages.\nHe was given the title “Consul of the Philosophers” and\ntaught all branches of philosophy. He commented on and paraphrased\ntreatises from the Aristotelian Organon (De\ninterpretatione, Prior Analytics), and wrote a large\nnumber of short treatises discussing particular philosophical issues\nraised, in part at least, by his pupils: e.g., on the distinction\nbetween homonyms and synonyms, on the characteristic of substance as\nself-existent (authuparktos), on the Platonic forms, on the\nunity of the soul and the body, on the problem of evil, on dreams. He\nalso compiled the De omnifaria\ndoctrina, a short encyclopedia in which various philosophical notions are explained in close dependence on Christian as well as pagan authors. His speeches are famous as examples of rhetorical style; there is also a collection of about five hundred of his letters. Although the amount of attention he paid to Aristotle’s works was significant, there is no doubt that Psellos had a strong preference for Plato and the Neoplatonists. On this account he has often — and not unreasonably — been identified as a pivotal figure in the transmission of the Platonic heritage through the Middle Ages. His works show that he carefully read Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and especially Proclus, whom he considered as an authority among ancient authors. In particular, he found in the Elements of Theology an elaborate metaphysical system open to adaptation to Christian theology. For although the Christian Trinity differed significantly from the Neoplatonic first principle, Psellos found that Proclus’ view of the general structure of reality, descending from the first cause to intellect, soul nature, body, and matter, could be adopted with some modifications. However, in his attempts to advance\nphilosophical learning, he was often attacked concerning his\ntheological orthodoxy, with the result that he often had to be careful\nto distance himself from heretical doctrines, e.g., in his writings on\nthe Chaldaean Oracles. \n\nJohn Italos (c. 1025–after 1082) was a pupil\nof Michael Psellos, and his successor in the Imperial School as\n“Consul of the Philosophers”, where he also taught all\nbranches of philosophy. Anna Komnene refers to him in the\nAlexiad, the history she wrote of the events during the reign\nof her father Alexios I (1081–1118), as an exceptional thinker\nand an excellent logician who interpreted Aristotle better than anyone\nelse in his time. Indeed, Italos occupies a special place in the\nhistory of Byzantine thought for having been put on trial and condemned\nby the Church in 1082, on the charge of having advocated the systematic\nuse of philosophical analysis and logical reasoning in clarifying\ntheological issues. Regardless of the positions he defended on such\nissues, positions some of which, after all, were not at all different\nfrom those of other philosophers, notably from Psellos’, what\nseems to have been really unacceptable for the religious and the\npolitical establishment at the time was his rationalist approach\ntowards doctrines which the Orthodox Church considered beyond\ncomprehension, as something Christians should simply accept on faith\nand as something only the Church had the authority to judge. It is\ntelling that to this day, during the mass of the first Sunday in Lent,\nthe so-called Synodikon of the Greek Orthodox Church is read,\nin which Italos is anathematized in eleven articles. What mainly\nsurvives from his writings are the commentary on the second, third and\nfourth book of the Topics; two small treatises on dialectic\nand on the Aristotelian syllogisms together with a very brief synopsis\nof rhetoric; and finally, the Quaestiones quodlibetales, a\ncollection of ninety-three answers to philosophical questions posed to\nhim by his students, among which were the emperor Michael VII (ruled\n1071–1078) and his brother Andronikos Doukas. In these texts\nItalos seems to question the supremacy of theology over philosophy and\neven to overturn the established hierarchy. That is to say, Italos\nobviously follows the ancient conception of philosophy, well known from\nboth the Platonic and the Aristotelian traditions, according to which\ntheology is part of philosophy, since philosophy culminates in the\nattempt to understand the first principle of everything. It probably\nwas this supposedly arrogant attempt on his part to develop a natural\nor philosophical theology that led to his trial and condemnation. \n\nAfter John Italos, Theodore of Smyrna (mid-11th\ncentury–after 1112) was appointed “Consul of the\nPhilosophers”. His work Epitome of All Things Pertaining to\nNature and to Natural Principles according to the Ancients is\nstill unpublished. It was conceived as an introductory compendium in\nfour books (three of which survive) to the topics and terminology of\nAristotle’s Physics.  \n\nAccording to a widely accepted hypothesis, Eustratios of\nNicaea and Michael of Ephesus were two of\nthe contributors to a series of commentaries, initiated by the\nprincess and historian Anna Komnene, on previously neglected\nAristotelian works. Their commentaries, in which they followed ancient\nmodels, some of which are now lost, but also added their own\ninsightful remarks, were partly translated into Latin and played a\nrole in the development of Western Aristotelianism in the 13th\ncentury. \n\nEustratios was a pupil of John Italos and became the Metropolitan of\nNicaea at the beginning of the 12th century. Anna Komnene in the\nAlexiad presents him as an extremely erudite scholar both of\nreligious and of secular literature as well as a master of dialectic.\nHe was also asked by the emperor Alexios I to participate in various\ntheological debates with the Latin Church, until he himself, just like\nhis teacher Italos, was finally condemned for heresy in 1117. The\nreasons for his condemnation are a rather complicated matter involving\nboth theological and political issues. In this connection, however, it\nis interesting to note that he was famous for his strong conviction of\nthe propriety of using Aristotle’s syllogistic in theology; he even\nstated that Christ himself had argued with the help of Aristotelian\nsyllogisms. What we have of his work as a commentator are his comments\non the first and sixth book of the Nicomachean Ethics and his\ncommentary on the second book of the Posterior Analytics. In\ninterpreting Aristotle, Eustratios clearly followed the late antique\nNeoplatonic philosophers, though at certain places, like the issue\nconcerning the knowledge of first principles, he advocated theses\nwhich seem closer in line with his Christian beliefs. For Eustratius,\ncontrary to Plato and Aristotle, did not claim that the human soul\nregains pieces of knowledge that we possessed at some former time, nor\nthat it has only potential knowledge which then becomes actual. He\nbelieved that the human soul, when created by God, is created perfect,\nthat is, it has full knowledge of the principles and self-evident\ncommon concepts, but human beings lose sight of this knowledge and\nunderstanding, because they are susceptible to the impulses generated\nby their body. \n\nAbout Michael of Ephesus’ life next to nothing is known. On\nthe other hand, it is perfectly clear that his breadth as an\nAristotelian commentator is remarkable. Indeed, Michael has been\ncompared to Alexander of Aphrodisias in respect both of his mode of\nexposition and method of interpretation. He wrote commentaries not only\non the fifth, ninth, and tenth books of the Nicomachean\nEthics, but also on Metaphysics 6–14 and on the\nSophistical Refutations (both wrongly attributed to\nAlexander), on the Generation of Animals (wrongly attributed\nto Philoponus), on the Parva naturalia, on the Parts of\nAnimals, on the Movement of Animals, on the\nProgression of Animals; furthermore, he wrote comments on the\npseudo-Aristotelian treatise De coloribus, and on\nthe Politics, the latter of which have only partly\nsurvived. \n\nTheodore Prodromos (c. 1100–c. 1170) continued\nthe tradition of writing extensive commentaries on Aristotle’s works\nby authoring a still unedited commentary on the second book of\nAristotle’s Posterior Analytics, heavily influenced by\nEustratios’. A couple of his minor works are also worth\nmentioning. His Xenedemus is a short Plato-style elenctic\ndialogue on themes from Porphyry’s\nIsagoge. He also wrote a small essay, On\n‘Great’ and ‘Small’, which contains a\nseries of arguments against Aristotle’s doctrine in the sixth\nchapter of the Categories that ‘great’ and\n‘small’ are not quantities but relatives, and not\ncontraries. \n\nNevertheless, not all Byzantine philosophers at the time were in\nfavor of harmonizing ancient wisdom with the Christian doctrines. In\nfact, since Proclus seems to have represented the ancient philosopher\npar excellence, being so much admired by Psellos and his\npupils, he understandably became the target of Nicholas of\nMethone (early 12th century–c. 1160/66), who wrote a\ndetailed refutation of the Elements of Theology.\nNicholas’ aim clearly was to provide the pious readers with the\nnecessary arguments against the Neoplatonic influences on Christian\ndogmas, influences that on his view could lead the believers away from\nthe true faith. For instance, Nicholas systematically argues against\nthose of Proclus’ propositions which try to establish that the\nunderlying principle of the universe is pure unity, because he\nconsiders them contrary to the Christian belief in the Holy\nTrinity. \n\nThe capture of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204 dealt a\nsevere blow to the Byzantine institutions of education and learning.\nMany teachers and scholars fled the city to find a haven in Nicaea,\nwhere the Laskarid dynasty had settled. Education and learning were\nmatters of great concern to the Laskarid emperors; one of them,\nTheodore II Doukas Laskaris (ruled 1254–1258),\nwas himself the author of two works on natural\nphilosophy, Kosmikē dēlōsis (Cosmic\nExposition) and Peri phusikēs koinōnias\n(On Physical Community), in which he brought simple\nmathematical schemes to bear on elemental theory and cosmology. In\n1261 Constantinople was recaptured by Michael VIII Palaiologos, and\nthe period of cultural prosperity that followed is sometimes referred\nto as the “Palaiologan renaissance”. \n\nThe most important philosophy teacher and scholar in the period\nleading up to this “renaissance” was\nundoubtedly Nikephoros Blemmydes\n(1197–c. 1269). Through his students – who included Doukas\nLaskaris as well as the historian George Akropolites\n(1217–1282), later charged by Michael VIII with the\nheadmastership of the Imperial School in Constantinople – and\nthrough his widely read compendia on logic and natural philosophy (see\nsect. 1.2), Blemmydes exerted an influence that is clearly discernible\nin many later philosophical works although it has never been\nsystematically measured. In a prefatory note to his compendium on\nlogic, the first version of which was apparently composed in 1237 at\nthe behest of Emperor John III Batatzes, he somewhat unexpectedly\nemphasizes the utility of logic for theology.  Indeed,\nBlemmydes’ services were employed on more than one occasion to\ndefend the Orthodox dogma of the procession of the Holy Ghost in\nofficial debates with papal legates. The relation to the Catholic\nChurch was the dominating political and religious issue for most of\nthe 13th century. A reunion was negotiated at the Second Council of\nLyons in 1274, but it lacked popular support, and after the death of\nMichael VIII in 1282, the new emperor and his patriarch pulled out of\nthe deal. Encounters with Dominican and Franciscan theologians may\nhave helped fuel the interest in logic in Byzantium during this time.\nThe Greek translations of Boethius’ De hypotheticis\nsyllogismis and De topicis differentiis\nby Manuel Holobolos, who taught logic at the\nPatriarchal School between 1265 and 1273, must be seen against this\nbackground. Other Latin philosophical and theological works were\ntranslated by Maximos Planoudes\n(1260–c. 1310). They do not seem to have had any discernible\nimpact until the mid-14th century, when Augustine’s\n“cogito” appears as one of several arguments against\nScepticism in a pamphlet by Nicholas Kabasilas\nChamaetos (c. 1322/3–after 1391); it reappears in a\nsimilar work of unknown date, transmitted as chapter 3 of a miscellany\nattributed in the (late) manuscripts to\none Herennius. \n\nOn the other hand, the development of Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy at the hands of Western masters may have encouraged their\nGreek-speaking colleagues to a more intense study of the relevant\ntexts. As noted in section 1.2, a great number of commentaries,\nparaphrases and compendia of Aristotle’s works, mainly but\nnot exclusively on logic and natural philosophy, were produced in the\n13th and early 14th centuries. \n\nBlemmydes’ compendia draw for the most part on Aristotle and\nhis late antique commentators, but occasionally other influences are in\nevidence, such as that of John of Damascus in the Epitome\nlogica and that of the Stoic cosmologist Cleomedes in the\nEpitome physica. Besides these two compendia, Blemmydes\ncomposed two anthropological works, De anima and\nDe corpore, and two short treatises on a much-discussed\nquestion of both theological and philosophical import, Against the\nPredetermination of the Terminus of Life, in which he defends\nthe causal connection between moral choice and life span, although he\nproceeds mostly by appeal to authority. \n\nThe historian George Pachymeres (1242–c.\n1310), who also taught at the Patriarchal School, wrote a voluminous\nAristotelian paraphrase-compendium covering not only logic and natural\nphilosophy but also metaphysics and ethics, the Philosophia.\nIn addition, he wrote a textbook on the four mathematical disciplines\n(the Quadrivium) and, more importantly,\n“exegetical” commentaries on four Aristotelian works, or\ngroups of works, namely the Organon, the Physics,\nthe Metaphysics and the Nicomachean Ethics, as well\nas the only Late Byzantine commentary on Plato, a continuation of\nProclus’ incompletely transmitted commentary on\nthe Parmenides, which contrasts starkly with its ancient\npredecessor by applying a “logical” (i.e.,\nnon-metaphysical) method of interpretation and a paraphrastic mode of\nexposition. A growing body of evidence shows that Pachymeres was\ndeeply engaged in collecting, transcribing, and editing manuscripts of\nphilosophical authors. \n\nPachymeres’ concern with Plato was not coincidental. If the\nboom in Aristotelian studies in this period was partly a response to\nthe challenge of Western philosophy and theology, it seems reasonable\nto think that a similar cause may be found for the rising popularity of\nPlato, who was much less known than Aristotle in the West. Ever since\nLate Antiquity Aristotelian logic and natural philosophy had been\ncommonly regarded as propaedeutic to Platonic metaphysics, and the\nhierarchical relation between the two philosophers was now increasingly\nstressed, sometimes (as in Nikephoros Gregoras’\nPhlorentius) in the context of open criticism of the\nAristotelian inclinations of Latin philosophy. Platonic metaphysics\nwas, however, a theologically precarious field, and it is hardly\nsurprising if those who plowed it were not at all times equally\noutspoken about the fruits of their labor. Still, in the 1260s, George\nAkropolites willingly admitted that his interpretations of Church\nFathers were informed by the divinely inspired Plato, Proclus,\nIamblichus and Plotinus; and towards the end of our period George\nGemistos Plethon went so far as completely to discard Christianity in\nfavor of Neoplatonic polytheism. \n\nAnother early Palaiologan compendium extends its ambit to cover\nrhetoric and medicine as well as the whole of philosophy. This is\nthe Encyclopedia of Joseph Rhakendytes\n(aka Joseph the Philosopher, died 1330). Joseph drew heavily on the\nworks of his Byzantine predecessors. His part on logic reproduces\nBlemmydes’ Epitome logica with some additions; his part\non natural philosophy combines works by Blemmydes with works by\nPachymeres and Michael of Ephesus; his part on the quadrivial\ndisciplines is identical with the Logic and Quadrivium by\nthe anonymous of 1007. \n\nA contemporary of Pachymeres was Sophonias, a\nConstantinopolitan monk and later Catholic convert, whose hybrid\nparaphrase of Aristotle’s De anima was mentioned in\nsection 1.2. On stylistic grounds the anonymously transmitted\nparaphrases of the Categories, the Prior\nAnalytics, the Sophistici elenchi, and the Parva\nnaturalia edited in CAG 23 and 5 may also be attributed\nto Sophonias. Even though these works are in themselves of limited\nphilosophical interest, it has been shown that Sophonias draws on John\nPhiloponus’ lost commentary on book 3 of the De\nanima (Van Riet 1965). \n\nOf more interest is the mostly anonymously transmitted paraphrase of\nthe Nicomachean Ethics edited in CAG 19 as the work\nof Heliodorus of Prusa. This attribution is clearly a\nhoax; in fact the only thing we know about the circumstances under\nwhich the work was composed is that it must have been before 1366,\nwhen the earliest manuscript is dated, and after the composition of\nEustratios’ commentary, on which it draws. It has recently been\nargued (by Trizio 2011) that it originated in the milieu around the\nformer emperor John Kantakouzenos (abdicated 1354). \n\nNot all Late Byzantine philosophical authors were content to write\ncompendia, paraphrases, and commentaries on the classical authors. One\nwho decided to write essays on natural philosophy in order to\ninvestigate the relevant questions independently of Aristotle and\nPlato was Nikephoros Choumnos\n(c. 1250/55–1327), a leading ﬁgure at the court of\nAndronikos II in the 1290s and 1300s. Choumnos’ main concern was\nwith elemental theory, cosmology, and psychology. Many of his essays\nseem to have been composed on the occasion of literary gatherings\n(theatra), some of which were presided over by the\nemperor. \n\nIt is typical of Choumnos’ approach that he seeks to argue\nphilosophically, that is by valid inference from principles and\ndefinitions that are universally accepted, for views that are already\ntheologically established. Thus he attempts to refute\nAristotle’s theory that the heavens are composed of a fifth,\nnaturally ungenerable and imperishable body, not by simply appealing\nto the Christian doctrine that the world was created at the beginning\nof time and persists only through the grace of its creator, but by\npointing out that Aristotle’s attempt to deduce his theory from the\nfact that the heavens have a circular movement fails, inasmuch as he\nhas only secured the premise that all simple bodies have simple\nmovements, not that all simple movements belong to simple bodies,\nwhich is what his argument requires. Likewise, Choumnos argues by\nelimination against the theory of pre-existing matter (which is how\nhe, following Aristotle, interprets the chōra of\nPlato’s Timaeus), and insists against the theory of\nseparate forms that if forms do not allow self-predication, they are\nnot participated in by individuals; but if they do, they are not\nuniversal and eternal, but individual and perishable. The bottom line\nis that matter and form are inseparable and simultaneously\ncreated. Another time he attacks the theory of recollection, which he\ntakes to entail the pre-existence of the soul, by flatly denying that\nknowledge can suffer destruction or, obviously, be revived, and\nstressing the fact that this follows from Plotinus’ (whom he\nconsiders to be his main opponent) view that the activities of the\nsoul are immortal. He even prides himself on having proved the\ndoctrine of the resurrection of the body on the basis of Plato’s\nviews on the migration of souls. \n\nOriginality of thought and expression was also striven for by\nChoumnos’ rival and adversary at court, Theodore\nMetochites (1270–1332). It is perhaps most clearly\nattained in his Sēmeiōseis gnōmikai\n(Sententious Notes), a collection of 120 essays on subjects as\ndiverse as the reasons for Aristotle’s obscurity and for\nPlato’s use of the dialogue form, the interrelations between\ndifferent faculties of soul, and the pros and cons of different\npolitical constitutions. A significant part of the essays are taken up\nby meditations on the transience of human life, not\ninfrequently bearing on the vicissitudes of Metochites’ own\nlife and career. He also lingered over many of these themes in his\norations, notably On Education. \n\nIn a more traditional vein, Metochites wrote paraphrases of all of\nAristotle’s writings on natural philosophy; his proudest\naccomplishment, however, was his monumental Introduction to\nthe study of Ptolemaic astronomy. The superiority of mathematics\n(including astronomy) to natural philosophy is in Metochites’\nview warranted by the higher degree of reality of mathematical objects,\nwhich he seems (especially in his hexameter poem On\nMathematics) to have conceived of as being ultimately derived by\nprocession from intelligible objects, even if he sometimes speaks of\nthem as the products of abstraction from sensibles. The two conceptions\nare probably intended to be complementary, as indeed they are in many\nNeoplatonic writers. \n\nMetochites’ student and intellectual heir, Nikephoros\nGregoras (1293/94–1360/61), began his career as an\nastronomer and ended it as a theological controversialist. Some of his\nletters and a few passages of his Roman History touch upon\nphilosophical subjects: especially noteworthy is the vehement criticism\nof Aristotle in the dialogue Phlorentius, ostensibly an\naccount of the author’s debate with Barlaam of\nCalabria (c. 1290–1348) in 1331–1332. As Gregoras\nnotes with disdain, Barlaam was well-versed in contemporary Latin\nscholasticism; but it was his knowledge in ancient Greek philosophy and\nmathematics (including astronomy) that aroused both admiration and\nhostility when he arrived at Constantinople in the 1320s. In his\nSolutions for George Lapithes he is largely concerned with\ndefending Aristotle against accusations of inconsistency with Plato as\nwell as with himself. In so doing he addresses issues of more profound\nimportance than Gregoras does in his Solutions for Helena\nPalaiologina, which deal principally with problems of natural\nphilosophy; but the Neoplatonic epistemology in Barlaam’s\nSolution 4 and especially his First Greek Letter,\naccording to which scientific knowledge rests on innate\n“substantial principles” in our souls, which reflect the\ncreative principles in the Divine Intellect, and thus indicate the\ntrue causes of the nature of things, is curiously inconsistent with\nthe theory expounded in his Anti-Latin Treatises, which\nstates that the universal principles in our souls, on which\ndemonstrative arguments are based, are completely derived from the\nexperience of particulars. \n\nBarlaam and Gregoras were both on the losing side in the Hesychast\nstrife, which raged between c. 1337 and 1351 and revolved around the\nquestion of theological method. The winner was Gregory\nPalamas (1296–1359), famous for his claim that even\nthough God’s substance (ousia) is necessarily concealed\nto us, we can have direct experience of his activities\n(energeiai). The first 29 of Palamas’ 150\nChapters attempt to put natural philosophy on a more secure\nfooting by placing facts about the world as a whole—in contrast\nto particular facts, such as astronomical phenomena—in the same\nepistemological category as facts about God and Man, which are only\nknowable through the teaching of the spirit. Thus Palamas expends\nconsiderable energy on denouncing the erroneous views of the Greek\nnatural philosophers, Platonists as well as Aristotelians. \n\nIn the last years of the Byzantine Empire, philosophical writers\ntended indeed to identify themselves as either Platonists or\nAristotelians, and to emphasize the disagreements existing between the\ntwo ancient authorities. This approach was very different from the\nharmonizing endeavors of the late antique commentators, and it was left\nas a legacy to Renaissance and early modern Aristotelianism and\nPlatonism. Its roots are to be found in the anti-Aristotelian\nsentiments of 14th-century authors such as Metochites and Gregoras, but\nit came into full blossom in the great controversy which started in\n1439, when George Gemistos Plethon (c.\n1360–1452) published his pamphlet De differentiis, and\nground to a halt after the Latin version of Cardinal\nBessarion’s (1403–1472) In\ncalumniatorem Platonis was printed thirty years later. \n\nPlethon’s pamphlet purported to show how inferior Aristotle was\nto Plato, in spite of being more admired especially in the Latin\nWest. Like Metochites before him, Plethon seems to have drawn on the\nMiddle Platonist Atticus for his criticisms, which cover every part of\nAristotle’s philosophy and end with a refutation of\nAristotle’s objections to the Theory of Forms. Aristotle was\nduly assisted by George (Gennadios) Scholarios (c.\n1405–after 1472), whose Contra Plethonem bears\ntestimony to a philosophical education that was clearly more Latin\nthan Greek. Of paramount concern to Gennadios was the repudiation of\nPlethon’s claim that Aristotle’s God is not creator of the\nworld. This is achieved inter alia by recourse to the\ntime-honored hypothesis of eternal creation. As his sobriquet\nsuggests, Gennadios was an extremely erudite man, who prided himself\non being a better Aristotelian commentator than his Byzantine\nforerunners precisely on account of his vast knowledge of the Latin\nliterature, including translations of Avicenna and Averroes. His\ncommentaries on Porphyry’s Isagoge and\nAristotle’s Categories and De interpretatione\nare the most extensive Byzantine ones on these works, and owe a great\ndeal, with respect to their content and form, to earlier and\ncontemporary works in Latin. Especially strong is the influence of\nThomas Aquinas, many of whose works Gennadios also translated, thus\ncontinuing the efforts of\nDemetrios (c. 1323/26–c. 1397/98) and\nProchoros (c. 1333/34–c. 1370/71)\nKydones in the preceding century. \n\nThe controversy dragged on with new contributions on Plato’s\nbehalf by Plethon and Michael Apostoles; and on\nAristotle’s by Theodore of Gaza, Andronikos\nKallistos, and George of Trebizond. All\nthese men were native Greek speakers; and except for Trebizond, they\nall wrote in their mother tongue. The importance of the controversy\nfor Renaissance philosophy is largely due to Bessarion, who tried, in\nthe work already mentioned, to give a fair hearing to both\nphilosophers (thus reverting to the traditional approach of\nharmonization), and whose systematic account of Platonism was\nunprecedented in the Latin literature. \n\nA few years after his appointment as patriarch in 1454 (thus after the\nfall of Constantinople), Scholarios gave orders for all existing\ncopies of Plethon’s Book of Laws to be destroyed. It is clear\nfrom the remaining fragments that this work constituted Plethon’s\nprescription for a happy life for humankind, advocating an ethics and\na politics inspired by Plato himself as well as by Middle Platonic,\nNeoplatonic, and Stoic writers, and propagating a philosophically\nrefined form of the old Olympian religion. It has been claimed (by\nTambrun 2007 and Siniossoglou 2011) that Plethon rejected the\ntranscendence of the highest god (Zeus), and that his theology\ntherefore, in contrast to both the Christian and the Neoplatonic\nconsensus, was entirely positive, but this appears dubious (see\nHladký 2014). One surviving chapter of the Book of\nLaws (De fato) argues, both from the nature of causation\nand from the assumption that the gods have foreknowledge, that all\nevents are determined by fate. According to Plethon, this is\ncompatible with freedom, not in the sense that human beings are not\nruled by anything, but in the sense that they are ruled by their own\nintellect: being free is simply submitting to the decree of Zeus.\nDivine punishment is justified as a method for teaching human beings\nto become free. A combination of Platonic and Stoic influences is also\nmanifest in another short treatise by Plethon, On\nVirtues. \n\nThe question of the immortality of the soul is a potential point of\nconflict between Orthodox Christian doctrine and Byzantine natural\nphilosophy. Byzantine natural philosophy, like its late antique\npredecessor, was largely based on the works of Aristotle. In Book 2 of\nthe De anima, Aristotle defines the soul as “the first\nactuality of a natural body which potentially has life.” He\nhimself draws the conclusion that the soul must be inseparable from the\nbody. It seems clear, too, that on this view the soul cannot survive\nthe moment of the body’s death. Still, Aristotle leaves open the\npossibility that there may be some part of the soul that is not the\nactuality of a body, and therefore may be separable. As he explains in\nBook 3 of the De anima, the mental faculty by which we think\nand form beliefs, nous, variously translated as\n“mind” or “intellect”, in fact lacks a bodily\norgan. In one of the most intriguing and hotly debated passages of\nancient philosophy, De anima Book 3, chapter 5, Aristotle\nintroduces the notion of a kind of intellect that he describes as\nproductive and active, and this kind of intellect, according to him, is\nnot only separable from the body but is “alone immortal and\neternal.” The question, then, is whether the eternal life of this\nproductive and active intellect is enough to ensure survival after\ndeath for the individual human soul. \n\nAristotle’s definition of the soul presented a formidable\nchallenge to Byzantine Christians and late antique pagan philosophers\nalike. As Theodore Metochites explained in his Sēmeiōseis\ngnōmikai (3.6–7), \n\nAmong the ancient authors who held the view that Aristotle denied\nany kind of immortality for the individual human soul we find Alexander\nof Aphrodisias, who famously identified the productive intellect of\nDe anima 3.5 with the first mover. Christian authors such as\nHippolytus of Rome, Tatian, Ps.-Justin Martyr, Gregory of Nyssa, and\nTheodoret also claimed that Aristotle believed the soul to be wholly\nmortal, and they all condemned him for it. Perhaps it is not so\nsurprising that the fiercely anti-Aristotelian 2nd-century Platonist\nAtticus did the same; but Aristotle’s definition was also\ncriticized by Plotinus and Porphyry, since it seemed to suggest that\nthe soul was not a separable substance. \n\nOne may presume that Metochites’ attribution of this view to\n“the multitude” expresses contempt. In fact he seems to\nhave sided with “the opposite view”, namely, \n\nThis was the standard view. Among those who maintained that\nAristotle did assign immortality to at least some part of the\nindividual soul are all the late antique commentators whose\ncommentaries on the De anima are extant. \n\nOf the Neoplatonists, John Philoponus, whose commentary was highly\ninfluential throughout the Greek Middle Ages though virtually unknown\nin the Latin West, held that Aristotle agreed with Plato that of the\nthree kinds of soul (1) the vegetative soul alone is wholly\ninseparable from the body; (2) the irrational soul (comprising the\nfaculties of imagination and sense-perception as well as appetite and\ndesire) is separable from the gross body, though inseparable from\nthe pneuma, and thus mortal; and (3) the rational soul, the\nsubstance of which transcends all body, but some of whose activities\nare bound up with the human body (as those of the pilot are bound up\nwith the ship), is wholly separable and thus immortal. It seems clear\nthat “rational soul” in this context is synonymous with\n“intellect” in the Aristotelian texts. Ps.-Simplicius (=\n?Priscian) takes a similar view, but in Ps.-Philoponus’ (=\n?Stephanus’) commentary, the scheme is altered so as to allow\nimmortality even to the two perishable kinds of soul (“for they\nperish not in their capacity of soul but in their capacity of being in\na body”). Thus Plato’s dictum that “all soul is\nimmortal” (Phdr. 245c6) according to Ps.-Philoponus\nholds true, even though intellect is the only part of soul which is\nimmortal and eternal, as Aristotle says. The interpretation\nof Phaedrus 245c6 as referring to “both rational,\nirrational and vegetative” soul is ascribed to Numenius (f. 47)\nand repudiated by Philoponus (In DA 9.35–10.1). What\nall the Neoplatonic commentators took for granted is that the\nproductive intellect introduced in De anima 3.5 is part of\nthe individual human soul. This must be so, since in their view\nthe De anima is a treatise on the human soul. \n\nThe interpretative tradition of the Neoplatonic commentators\nstretches well beyond the 11th century, when John Italos defended what\nhe took to be Aristotle’s position, namely that rational\nsoul alone is immortal, against Ps.-Philoponus’ interpretation of\nthe above-mentioned Platonic dictum (quaestiones nos. 36;\n50). This is also what Sophonias argued at the turn of the\n14th century in his paraphrase of De anima 3.2. Thus both he\nand Italos conformed to the same scheme as Philoponus and\nPs.-Simplicius. In the same vein, Nikephoros Blemmydes, in his De\nanima (c. 1263), made extensive use of the analogy of the pilot of\na ship as interpreted by the Neoplatonists. First he used\nit to show that Aristotle thought the rational soul was separable and\nimmortal; then he developed it into an image of the turmoil experienced\nby the rational soul as long as it is connected with the body. And in\nthe early 12th century, Michael of Ephesus pointed out, when commenting\non Aristotle’s dictum that the activity of the better part of us\nis more serious, that the intellect which is part of us comes into its\nown only after being separated from the body, which shows, he says,\n“that those who claim that Aristotle was of the opinion that the\nsoul is mortal were fundamentally wrong” (In NE 10,\n576.25–33). \n\nHaving thus briefly summarized the arguments both of those who claim\nthat Aristotle did not believe in the immortality of the soul and of\nthose who maintain that he did, Metochites adds an observation of his\nown in support of the latter’s view: \n\nIn this passage Metochites seems to contend that Aristotle’s\nargument against self-movement in Physics 7.1 and 8.5 entails\nthe proposition that “what moves itself will not cease to do\nso,” which is used as one of the premises of an argument for the\nimmortality of the soul. This latter argument is apparently strongly\ninspired by the first part of the proof of immortality in\nSocrates’ palinode in Plato’s Phaedrus\n(245c5–8). It seems to be an “ontological” kind of\nargument. That is to say, it attempts to show that the (eternal)\nexistence of the soul follows from its nature. The soul’s nature\nis defined precisely as its movement, whereby it moves itself. The idea\nis obviously that since the mover and the moved thing, if they are\nidentical, cannot be disconnected, there will always be sufficient\nreason that the moved thing is moved (because there will always be a\nmover connected with it) and that the mover causes movement (because\nthere will always be something there for it to move). Now, what seems\nto be the other premise of this argument, namely the proposition that\nthe soul moves itself, is refuted by Aristotle in De anima\n1.3–4 on the strength of the very proposition established in\nPhysics 7.1 and 8.5 and cited by Metochites in the preceding\nparagraph, namely that movement is necessarily an irreflexive relation.\nThe question is, then: what reason, if any, can Metochites have for\nthinking that the proposition that self-movement is eternal follows\nfrom (an argument containing) the proposition that self-movement does\nnot exist? \n\nIt may be noted that Metochites deduces this proposition in two\nsteps. First he says that it follows from Aristotle’s\nview—namely, (A) that movement is an asymmetrical relation\nbetween two contiguous entities, one of which causes movement and one\nof which is moved—(1) that for any movement, if the moving and\nthe moved parts are disconnected, the movement will cease. Then he adds\nthe further inference (2) that if the moving and the moved parts are\nidentical, the moving part will not cease to cause movement. Since (2)\nclearly does not follow either from (A) or from (1), but does seem to\nfollow from the converse of (1)—that for any movement,\nonly if the moving and the moved parts are disconnected, the\nmovement will cease—one may wonder whether Metochites may have\nfallen prey to the fallacia consequentis: if (if p\nthen q) then (if not-p then not-q). \n\nEven if we cannot definitively clear him of this charge, we may be\nable to point to extenuating circumstances. The Neoplatonic\ncommentators, too, espouse the ontological argument for the immortality\nof the soul. They also accept Aristotle’s analysis of movement as\nnecessarily an irreflexive relation; they believe, however, that\n“movement” in this context refers exclusively to physical\nmovement, and thus that the analysis does not concern the self-movement\nof the soul. That is to say, they affirm the compatibility of the\npremises of the ontological argument with Aristotle’s analysis of\nmovement. They do not try to deduce the former from the latter. That is\nwhy it is interesting to find in Proclus’ Elements of\nTheology (14, 16.15–23) an attempt to deduce the existence\nof a self-moved soul à la Plato from that of an unmoved\nintellect à la Aristotle. It is not clear that it is a\nsuccessful attempt; but it may still have predisposed some of\nProclus’ readers to understand Aristotle’s cosmological\nargument in Physics 8.5 as a proof of the existence of both an\nunmoved mover and (by implication) a self-moved soul. At any rate, if\nthis is how Metochites understood it, his suggestion that the premises\nof the ontological argument for the immortality of the soul are implied\nby Aristotle’s analysis of movement may seem less\nfar-fetched. \n\nThere is plenty of textual evidence that the attempt of Neoplatonist\ncommentators of Late Antiquity to reconcile the doctrines of Plato and\nAristotle on the issue of universals was closely followed in Byzantium\nby prominent thinkers like John Italos, Eustratios of Nicaea,\nNikephoros Blemmydes, Nikephoros Choumnos and George (Gennadios)\nScholarios. More specifically, Byzantine philosophers as a rule adopted\nthe Neoplatonist commentators’ three ways of understanding genera\n(and species) terms as referring to: \n\nThese three types of genera are the ones first introduced by the\n5th-century Neoplatonist Ammonius in his commentary on Porphyry’s\nIsagoge; they are also discussed in Elias’ and\nDavid’s commentaries on the same work, in Olympiodorus’\nProlegomena, and in Philoponus’ commentary on\nAristotle’s Categories. And it is the same three ways of\nunderstanding genera (and species) terms that are discussed by Arethas\nin his commentary on Porphyry’s Isagoge, but are also\nhinted at in Photios’ treatise Various Questions for\nDiscussion on Genera and Species (= Amphil. 77) as well\nas in Psellos’ paraphrase of Aristotle’s De\ninterpretatione. \n\nThis attempt to bring together the three ways of understanding\ngenera (and species) terms has been labeled as “conceptual”\nor “moderate realism” (Benakis 1982), but it has also been\npresented as a nominalist or conceptualist position (Joannou 1954;\nLloyd 1990). In view of this disagreement, it may be interesting to\ntake a closer look at the position the Byzantines advocated and to\ncompare it with that propounded by the Neoplatonist commentators. In\nparticular, it is important to focus on John Italos’ views on\ngenera, since he repeatedly discusses them at great length in his\nQuaestiones quodlibetales and there seems to be no earlier\nindications of any more vivid or systematic interest in this issue. \n\nIn quaestio 5, for instance, Italos talks about the same\nthree types of genera in the same order, but a certain detail of his\naccount proves to be quite intriguing. Italos, too, regards the genera\nbefore the particulars as the causes and paradigms of perceptible\nindividuals, which are not predicates, are separate from them, and\nexist in God’s mind, perfectly accommodating in this way the\nrequirements of Christian dogma. But then he presents the genera in the\nparticulars and the genera after the particulars in a manner which\nseems to differ from Ammonius’ account, for he seems to treat\nthem as two subdivisions of one class of genera, which is distinguished\nfrom the genera before the particulars by being later-born\n(hysterogenē) than the perceptible individuals, capable\nof being predicated of them, inseparable from them, and acquired by our\nmind by abstraction. What makes the genera in the particulars differ\nfrom the genera after the particulars, according to Italos, is the fact\nthat they are inseparable from the particulars in which they are: they\nare not predicated of many particulars, but only of the one particular\nwhich participates in them. The animal in Socrates is not the same as\nthe animal in Plato. On the other hand, the genera after the\nparticulars are predicated of many particulars, and it is one and the\nsame genus that is predicated both of all the particulars together and\nof every single one of them separately. \n\nDoes this mean that Italos understands the genera in the particulars\nas referring to forms which are particular? In other words, does this\nmean that he interprets Aristotle’s immanent forms as particular\nrather than universal? The pedigree of such an interpretation is not\nnegligible; both Proclus in his Elements of Theology as well\nas his teacher Syrianus in his commentary on Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics viewed the immanent forms as particulars, without\nimplying in any way that on this point they disagreed with Aristotle.\nAnd although Ammonius is not clear on this subject, there is no reason\nto believe that he was not here in agreement with these other\nNeoplatonists. This, of course, does not mean that such an\ninterpretation of Aristotle’s theory has to be the right one. But\nit is reasonable to think that, by Italos’ time, treating\nAristotle’s immanent forms as particulars was an acceptable, if\nnot the standard, interpretation. \n\nMost importantly, though, the point on which Italos seems to differ\nfrom Ammonius’ account of the three types of genera is that he\nconsiders not only the genera after the particulars as acquired by our\nmind by abstraction but also the genera in the particulars as such. For\nit seems that the genera after the particulars are acquired by our mind\nby abstraction of the common characteristics of perceptible\nindividuals, just like in Ammonius’ commentary, while the genera\nin the particulars are acquired by our mind by abstraction of the\nparticular form from the matter involved in each particular. Therefore,\nthe genera in the particulars do seem to represent, on Italos’\nview, what they represent for Proclus and Syrianus, namely immanent\nforms that are particular. \n\nBut if both the genera after the particulars and the genera in the\nparticulars are acquired by our mind by abstraction, does this mean\nthat, for Italos, they are not beings? On the contrary, Italos offers a\nwhole series of arguments to support the thesis that the genera are\nbeings (quaestiones 3, 19, 31). For this purpose he draws what\nhe takes to be Aristotle’s distinction between two senses of\nsomething’s being incorporeal (quaestio 8): \n\nThus, according to Italos’ interpretation of Aristotle, the\ngenera are incorporeal in a weak sense, since they are not strictly\nspeaking incorporeal but depend on a body for subsisting. Indeed, this\nis the sense that Italos himself adopts in his understanding of the\ngenera as incorporeal; genera are incorporeal per accidens and\nnot per se, because they are incorporeal insofar as they are\nin the human soul, while at the same time they are corporeal by\nparticipation (kata methexin) insofar as they subsist in the\nparticulars. And the genera that he has in mind in such contexts are\nobviously the genera in the particulars and the genera after the\nparticulars. \n\nBut if the genera are incorporeal beings, is there a special sense\nin which they are said to be beings? Italos often makes use of another\ndistinction, which is a commonplace in Platonic texts from Plotinus to\nSimplicius, but seems to have its origins even earlier; namely, the\ndistinction between something subsisting and something depending on\nmere thought. According to Italos (quaestio 19), things that\ndo not subsist (anupostata) but depend on mere thought are not\nbeings. As for things that subsist, he distinguishes between two\ndifferent kinds of beings; namely, between beings that subsist per\nse, which he calls subsistences (hupostaseis), and beings\nthat subsist in something else (enupostata). Subsistences are\nprior by perception, they are particulars and are for the most part\nbodies, whereas beings that subsist in something else are prior by\nknowledge, they are incorporeal, they are predicates shared by many\nthings, and they are thoughts (noēmata /\ndianoēmata). Italos’ terminology here clearly shows\nthe influence of the Christian Fathers, and in particular of John of\nDamascus, who in his Dialectica draws just this distinction\nbetween subsistences, things that subsist in something else, and things\nthat do not subsist. According to Italos, therefore, both subsistences\nand beings that subsist in something else are beings, and thus do not\ndepend on mere thought. Italos distinguishes these two kinds of beings\nfrom the standard examples of things that do not subsist, i.e.,\ngoat-stags and centaurs, as well as from his own examples of many-eyed\nmen and four-headed horses; for all these are, on his view, nothing but\nfabrications of the human mind and products of our imagination\n(phantasmata). On the other hand, it also is important not to\noverlook the difference between subsistences and beings that subsist in\nsomething else. Although the first subsist per se, the latter\nare thoughts that subsist in something else. \n\nHence, Italos’ position on the three types of genera could be\nsummarized as follows: All types of genera are incorporeal beings, the\ngenera before the particulars are subsistences whereas the genera in\nthe particulars as well as the genera after the particulars are beings\nthat subsist in something else. That is to say, although only God,\nGod’s thoughts, and the perceptible individuals exist in the\nstrong sense as subsistences, all types of genera are beings; they may\nbe beings in a different sense, but they all are beings and not\nconstructions of our mind devoid of reality. For this reason, it would\nperhaps be misleading to label Italos as a “nominalist”,\nsince he does not defend the view that the in rebus and\npost res genera are mere expressions, but it would also be\nmisleading to label him as a “realist”, since he does not\nthink that the in rebus and post res genera are\nsubsistences. Presumably, it is this difficulty of pinning down\nItalos’ position that has led to the introduction of intermediate\nlabels such as “conceptualist” and “conceptual”\nor “moderate realist”.","contact.mail":"borje.byden@gu.se","contact.domain":"gu.se"}]
