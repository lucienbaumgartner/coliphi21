During this\nperiod, the content of geometry and its internal diversity increased\nalmost beyond recognition; the axiomatic method, vaunted since\nantiquity by the admirers of geometry, finally attained true logical\nsufficiency, and the ground was laid for replacing, in the description\nof physical phenomena, the standard geometry of Euclid by Riemann's\nwonderfully pliable system. Modern philosophers of all tendencies\n— Descartes and Hobbes, Spinoza and Locke, Hume and Kant —\nhad regarded Euclidean geometry as a paradigm of epistemic certainty.\nThe sudden shrinking of Euclidean geometry to a subspecies of the vast\nfamily of mathematical theories of space shattered some illusions and\nprompted important changes in the philosophical conception of human\nknowledge. Thus, for instance, after these nineteenth-century\ndevelopments, philosophers who dream of a completely certain knowledge\nof right and wrong secured by logical inference from self-evident\nprinciples can no longer propose Euclidean geometry as an instance in\nwhich a similar goal has proved attainable. The present article\nreviews the aspects of nineteenth century geometry that are of major\ninterest for philosophy and hints in passing, at their philosophical\nsignificance.\n\n\n\nEuclid (fl. 300 BCE) placed at the head of his Elements a\nseries of ‘definitions’ (e.g., “A point is that which has\nno part”) and ‘common notions’ (e.g., “If equals be added\nto equals, the sums are equal”), and five ‘requests’.\nSupposedly these items conveyed all of the information needed for\ninferring the theorems and solving the problems of geometry, but as a\nmatter of fact they do not. However, the requests\n(aitemata)—usually called ‘postulates’ in\nEnglish—must at any rate be granted or Euclid's proofs will not\ngo through. Some of them are plainly practical: \n\nHowever, the fifth one sounds more like a statement of fact.  Euclid's\ntext can be rendered in English as follows: “If a straight line\n[c] falling on two straight lines [a and b]\nmakes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles,\nthe two straight lines [a and b], if produced\nindefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the\ntwo right angles” (terms in brackets added for clarity). This\nsounds far-fetched. Still, it can be readily paraphrased as a recipe\nfor constructing triangles, (See Figure 1.) Every triangle is formed\nby three coplanar straight lines that meet, by pairs, at three\npoints. Given any segment PQ, draw a straight line a\nthrough P and a straight line b through Q,\nso that a and b lie on the same plane; verify that\nthe angles that a and b make with\nPQ on one of the two sides of PQ\nadd up to less than two right angles; if this condition is satisfied,\nit should be granted that a and b meet at a point\nR on that same side of PQ, thus forming the\ntriangle PQR. This request is known as “Euclid's\nPostulate”. If the request is rejected—say, because we\nbelieve that the world is finite and there is no room in it to\naccomodate vertex R if the interior angles in question add up\nto very little less than two right angles—then much of Euclid's\nsystem of geometry will not go through. \n\nIn the darker ages that followed, Euclid's sense of mathematical\nfreedom was lost and philosophers and mathematicians expected geometry\nto rest on self-evident grounds. Now, if a is perpendicular\nand b is almost perpendicular to PQ,\na and b approach each other very slowly on one side\nof PQ and it is not self-evident that they must\neventually meet somewhere on that side. After all, the hyperbole\nindefinitely approaches its asymptotes and yet, demonstrably, never\nmeets them.  Through the centuries, several authors demanded—and\nattempted—a proof of Euclid's Postulate. John Wallis\n(b. 1616, d. 1703) derived it from the assumption that there\nare polygons of different sizes that have the same shape. But then\nthis assumption needs proof in turn. Girolamo Saccheri (b. 1667,\nd. 1733) tried reductio. He inferred a long series of\npropositions from the negation of Euclid's Postulate, until he reached\none which he pronounced “repugnant to the nature of the straight\nline”.  But Saccheri's understanding of this “nature” was\nrooted in Euclidean geometry and his conclusion begged the\nquestion. \n\nIn the 1820's, Nikolai I. Lobachevsky (b. 1793, d. 1856)\nand Janos Bolyai (b. 1802, d. 1860) independently tackled\nthis question in a radically new way. Lobachevsky built on the negation\nof Euclid's Postulate an alternative system of geometry, which he\ndubbed “imaginary” and tried inconclusively to test for\nvalidity at the astronomical scale by calculating the sum of the\ninternal angles of triangles formed by stars on the sky. Bolyai excised\nthe postulate from Euclid's system; the remaining rump is the “absolute\ngeometry”, which can be further specified by adding to it either\nEuclid's Postulate or its negation. From the 1790's Carl Friedrich\nGauss (b. 1777, d. 1855) had been working on the subject in\nthe same direction, but he refrained from publishing for fear of\nscandal. Since Lobachevsky was the first to publish, the system of\ngeometry based on the said “absolute geometry” plus the negation of\nEuclid's Postulate is properly called Lobachevskian\ngeometry. \n\nThe construction introduced above to explain Euclid's Postulate can\nalso be used for elucidating its negation. Draw the straight\nline a through point P at right angles with the\nsegment PQ. If Euclid's Postulate is denied, there\nare countless straight lines through Q, coplanar\nwith a, that make acute angles with PQ but\nnever meet a.  Consider the set of real numbers which are the\nmagnitudes of these acute angles. Let the greatest lower bound of this\nset be μ.  Evidently, μ > 0. There are exactly two straight\nlines through\nQ, coplanar with a, that make an angle of size μ with\nPQ. (See Figure 2.) Call them b1\nand b2. Neither b1 nor\nb2 meets a, but a meets every\nline through Q that is coplanar with a and makes\nwith PQ an angle less than μ. Gauss, Lobachevsky\nand Bolyai—unbeknownst to each other—coincided in calling\nb1 and b2the\nparallels to a through Q. μ is called the angle\nof parallellism for segment PQ. Its size depends on\nthe length of PQ, and decreases as the latter\nincreases. \n\nSuppose that the angle of parallellism for PQ is one\nhalf a right angle. In this case, b1 and\nb2 make a right angle at Q and we thus\nhave two mutually perpendicular straight lines on the same plane as a,\nwhich fail to meet a. \n\nLobachevsky's geometry abounds in surprising theorems (many of which\nhad already been found by Saccheri). Here are a few: The three interior\nangles of a triangle add up to less than two right angles. The\ndifference or “defect” is proportional to the triangle's area. Hence,\nin Lobachevskian geometry, similar triangles are congruent. Moreover,\nif a triangle is divided into smaller triangles, the defect of the\nwhole equals the sum of the defects of the parts. Since the defect\ncannot be greater than two right angles, the area of triangles has a\nfinite maximum. If a quadrilateral, by construction, has three right\nangles, the fourth angle is necessarily acute. Thus, in Lobachevskian\ngeometry there are no rectangles. \n\nThere is a simple formal correspondence between the equations of\nLobachevskian trigonometry and those of standard spherical\ntrigonometry. Based on it, Lobachevsky argued that any contradiction\narising in his geometry would inevitably be matched by a contradiction\nin Euclidean geometry. This appears to be the earliest example of a\npurported proof of relative consistency, by which a theory is shown to\nbe consistent lest another theory — whose consistency is\ntypically taken for granted — be inconsistent. \n\nLobachevskian geometry received little attention before the late\n1860s. When philosophers finally took notice of it, their opinions were\ndivided. Some regarded it as a formal exercise in logical deduction,\nwith no physical or philosophical significance, which employed ordinary\nwords—such as ‘straight’ and\n‘plane’—with a covertly changed meaning. Others\nwelcomed it as sufficient proof that, contrary to the influential\nthesis of Kant, Euclidean geometry does not convey any prerequisites of\nhuman experience and that the geometrical structure of physical space\nis open to experimental inquiry. Still others agreed that Non-Euclidean\ngeometries were legitimate alternatives, but pointed out that the\ndesign and interpretation of physical experiments generally presupposes\na definite geometry and that this role has been preempted by Euclid's\nsystem. \n\nNo matter what philosophers might say, for mathematicians\nLobachevskian geometry would probably have been no more than an odd\ncuriosity, if a niche had not been found for it within both projective\nand differential geometry, the two main currents of nineteenth-century\ngeometrical research (§§ 2 and 5). \n\nToday projective geometry does not play a big role in mathematics, but\nin the late nineteenth century it came to be synonymous with modern\ngeometry. Projective methods had been employed by Desargues\n(b. 1591, d. 1661) and Pascal (b. 1623, d. 1662),\nbut were later eclipsed by Descartes's method of coordinates. They\nprospered, however, after Jean-Victor Poncelet (b. 1788,\nd. 1867) showed that the projective properties of figures\nfurnished grounds of proof that were at least as powerful as, and\ncertainly more intuitive and ostensibly compelling than the Cartesian\nprocedure of setting up and solving equations between numbers\nrepresenting points.  \n\nProjective properties are those preserved by projections. Take, for\nexample, two planes Γ and H and a point P\noutside them. Let Φ be any figure on Γ. Draw straight lines\nfrom P through each point of Φ. The figure formed by the\npoints where these lines meet H is the projection of Φ on\nH from P. Generally this figure will differ from\nΦ in size and shape. But the projection of any number of straight\nlines on Γ meeting each other at certain points generally\nconsists of an equal number of straight lines on H meeting\nrespectively at the projection of those points. What happens, however,\nif the straight line joining P with some point Q of\nΓ never meets H, because PQ happens\nto lie on a plane parallel to H? (See Figure 3.) \n\nTo obviate such irksome exceptions, projective geometry added to each\nstraight line in space an ideal point, shared by every line parallel to\nit. Continuity requires then that all ideal points lie on a single\nideal plane, which meets each family of parallel planes along a\ndifferent ideal line. Fundamentalists may shudder at this seemingly\nwanton multiplication of entities. However, it had been practised in\narithmetic for centuries, as the initial stock of natural numbers 1, 2,\n3, … , was supplemented with zero, the negative integers, the\nnon-integral rationals, the irrationals, and the so-called imaginary\nnumbers.  \n\nThe points of a straight line stand in mutual relations of\nneighborhood and order. To see how the ideal point fits into these\nrelations let H rotate continually about the straight line\nm where it intersects Γ. (See Figure 4.) When\nH is parallel to PQ—say, at time\nt—the projection of Q on H from\nP is the ideal point of the straight line through P\nand Q. Right before t the said projection is an\nordinary point of H, very far from m.  Right after\nt the projection is again an ordinary point of H,\nvery far from m, but at the opposite end of the\nplane. Studying the continuous displacement of the projection during a\nshort time interval surrounding t, one concludes that if\nA and B are any two points of H that stand,\nrespectively, on either side of m, the ideal point of the\nstraight line through A and B must be placed between\nA and B.  Thus, in projective geometry, the points\nof a straight line are ordered cyclically, i.e., like the points of a\ncircle. As a result of this, the neighborhood relations among points\nin projective space and on projective planes differ drastically from\nthose familiar from standard geometry, and are highly\ncounterintuitive. It is fair to say that projective geometry signified\na much deeper and far-reaching revolution in human thought than did\nthe mere denial of Euclid's Postulate. \n\nIn the new setting, the projective properties of figures can be\ndefined unexceptionably. a one-one mapping f of projective\nspace onto itself is a collineation if it sends any three\ncollinear points A, B, and C, to three\npoints (A), (B), and (C), which are\ncollinear too. Projective properties (and relations) are those which\nare preserved by collineations. Here are a few examples of projective\nproperties. Of three or more points: to lie on the same straight line;\nto lie on the same plane. Of three or more straight lines: to meet at\nthe same point; to lie on the same plane. Of three or more planes: to\nintersect along the same straight line; to share the same point. Of\ncurves: to be a conic. Of surfaces: to be a quadric. \n\nIn a booklet issued when he joined the faculty at Erlangen (1872),\nFelix Klein (b. 1849, d. 1925) took stock of the enormous\ngrowth and diversification of geometry and proposed a standpoint from\nwhich its many branches could be organized into a system. From this\nstandpoint, the task of a branch of geometry can be stated thus:  \n\nIn nineteenth-century mathematics, ‘manifold’ often\ndesignated what we now call a set, but Klein apparently had something\nmore specific in mind:  \n\nIf S is a manifold in either sense, by a transformation\nof S we mean a one-one mapping of S onto itself. It is\nclear that \n\nBy virtue of conditions (i)-(iv), the transformations of S\nform a group GS  in\nthe precise sense that this term has in algebra.\nGS  includes subgroups, i.e.,\nsubsets which contain I and satisfy conditions (i) and (iv). If H is a\nsubgroup of GS  and Φ is a\nfeature of S, or of its elements or parts, which is not\naffected by the transformations of Φ, we say that Φ is\nH-invariant. The only GS-invariant\nis the cardinality of S (i.e., the number of elements in the\nmanifold). On the other hand, the group {I}, consisting of the identity\nalone, trivially preserves every conceivable feature. Between these two\nextremes there can be many different subgroups with all sorts of\ninteresting invariants, depending on the respective group structure. If\nS is not an arbitrary (structureless) set, but a numerical\nmanifold as described by Klein, it inherits structure from the real\nnumber field, which contributes to characterize the different subgroups\nof GS  and their invariants.\nThus, the group of continuous transformations preserves the topological\nproperties (neighborhood relations), and the group of linear\ntransformations preserves the projective properties.  \n\nCan metric properties be fixed in this way? Traditionally one\ndefines the distance between two points (x1, …\n,xn) and (y1, … ,yn) of a\nnumerical manifold as the positive square root of\n(x1 − y1)\n2 + … +\n(xn − y\nn)2. The group of isometries consists of the\ntransformations that preserve this function. However, this is just a\nconvention, adopted to ensure that the geometry is Euclidean. Using\nprojective geometry, Klein thought of something better. No real-valued\nfunction of point pairs, defined on all projective space, is an\ninvariant of the projective group, but there is a function of collinear\npoint quadruples, called the cross-ratio, which is such an\ninvariant. Drawing on work by Arthur Cayley (b. 1821,\nd. 1895), Klein (1871, 1873) considered the cross-ratio of point\nquadruples\n<P1,P2,P3,P4>. such\nthat P3 and P4 belong to a given conic κ on\na projective plane, while P1 and P2 range over a\nregion\n R\n that is bounded by or\notherwise fixed by κ. Since P3 and P4 must\nbe the points where the straight line through P1 and\nP2 meets κ, the said cross-ratio may be regarded as a\nfunction of the point pair <P1,P2>. The\ncollineations that map a given conic onto itself form a group, and the\nsaid function is clearly an invariant of this group. Klein showed that\na certain function of this function behaves like an ordinary distance\nfunction on\n R.\n According to the nature\nof the conic κ, the structure determined by this function\nsatisfies either (i) all the theorems of Euclidian plane geometry, or\n(ii) all those of Lobachevskian plane geometry, or (iii) those of a\nthird geometry which Klein himself discovered and dubbed\n‘elliptic’. (In elliptic geometry every straight line meets\nevery other, and the three internal angles of a triangle always add up\nto more than two right angles. Klein's names for the geometries of\nEuclid and Lobachevsky were ‘parabolic’ and\n‘hyperbolic’, respectively.) \n\nThis is how Klein's approach works for Lobachevskian geometry on the\nplane. Let κ be a real conic—a conic comprising only real\npoints—on the projective plane. Let Gκ be the\nset of all collineations that map κ onto itself.\nGκ is a subgroup of the projective group. Consider now\nthe cross-ratio of point quadruples\n<P1,P2,P3,P4> such\nthat P3 and P4 belong to κ, while\nP1 and P2 range over the interior Int(κ) of\nthe region of the real plane bounded by κ.\n (P ∈ Int(κ) if and only if P is a real point\nand no real tangent to κ passes through P.) As noted above, the\nchoice of points P1 and P2 fixes P3\nand P4, so the said cross-ratio may be regarded as a\nfunction of the first pair of points only, say,\nfκ(P1,P2). The function\nfκ is clearly Gκ-invariant. Put\ndκ(P1,P2) =\nc log fκ(P1,P2),\nwhere c is an arbitrary real-valued constant, different from\n0, and log x denotes the principal value of the natural logarithm of x.\nKlein was able to show that dκ behaves precisely like\na Lobachevskian distance function on Int(κ). In other words,\nevery theorem of Lobachevskian geometry holds for suitable figures\nformed from points of Int(κ), if the distance between any two of\nthese points is given by the function dκ. Consider,\nfor instance, four points P1,P2,P3,\nand P4 in Int(κ), such that\ndκ(P1,P2) =\ndκ(P2,P3) =\ndκ(P3,P4) =\ndκ(P4,P1). They are the vertices\nof a Lobachevskian equilateral quadrilateral Q, which can have at most\nthree right angles, in which case the fourth interior angle of Q must\nbe acute. (Where ‘right angle’ means, as usual, an angle\nequal to its adjacent angle, and two angles in Int(κ) are said to\nbe equal if one is the image of the other by a transformation of group\nGκ). \n\nIf κ stands for a different sort of conic, not an ordinary\nreal one, the function dκ obtained by the above\nprocedure behaves on suitably defined regions of the projective plane\nlike a Euclidian distance function or like the distance function of\nelliptic geometry (this depends on the nature of the conic κ).\nThus, depending on whether κ belongs to one or the other of three\nkinds of conic, the group of collineations that map κ onto itself\nis structurally identical with one of the three groups of\nLobachevskian, Euclidean, or elliptic isometries. Similar results hold\nfor the three-dimensional case, with κ a quadric surface. \n\nKlein's result led Bertrand Russell (b. 1873, d. 1970) to\nassert, in his neo-Kantian book on the foundations of geometry (1897),\nthat the general “form of externality” is disclosed to\nus a priori in projective geometry, but its metric\nstructure—which can only be Lobachevskian, Euclidean or\nelliptic—must be determined a posteriori by experiment. Henri\nPoincaré (b. 1854, d. 1912) took a more radical\nstance: If geometry is nothing but the study of a group, \n\nThe application to physics is immediate: “Among all possible groups\nwe have chosen one in particular, in order to refer to it all physical\nphenomena, just as we choose three coordinate axes in order to refer to\nthem a geometrical figure” (ibid., p. 291). The choice of this\nparticular group is motivated by its mathematical simplicity, but also\nby the fact that “there exist in nature some remarkable bodies which\nare called solids, and experience tells us that the different\npossible movements of these bodies are related to one another much in\nthe same way as the different operations of the chosen group” (ibid.).\nThese remarks of Poincaré signalled the beginning of\nconventionalism in the philosophy of science and provided its initial\nmotivation.  Klein's group-theoretical view of geometry enjoyed much favor\namong mathematicians and philosophers. It achieved a major success\nwhen Minkowski (1909) showed that the gist of Einstein's special\ntheory of relativity was the (spacetime) geometry of the Lorentz\ngroup, an essential result that Klein (1911) lived to enjoy. It\nimplies that the recent debate on the priority of Minkowski\nchronogeometry over Lorentz invariance or vice-versa is utterly idle,\nfor these are logically equivalent and thus, in effect, two sides of\nthe same coin (as explained by Acuña (2016)). However, Klein's\nErlangen program failed to cover the differential geometry of Riemann\n(§5), which Einstein (1915, 1916) placed at the core of his\ngeneral theory of relativity. \n\nAccording to Aristotle, scientific knowledge (episteme) must\nbe expressed in statements that follow deductively from a finite list\nof self-evident statements (axioms) and only employ terms defined from\na finite list of self-understood terms (primitives). For over two\nmillennia it was generally assumed that Aristotle's ideal is actually\nrealized in Euclid's Elements. As a matter of fact, there is a\nlogical gap already in Euclid I.1 (the solution of this problem rests\non an unstated assumption of continuity) and it is not clear that\nEuclid regarded his postulates as self-evident (by calling them\n‘requests’ he suggested he did not). The idea of securing\nknowledge by logical deduction from unquestionable principles had a\npowerful fascination for modern scientists such as Galileo and Newton,\nboth of whom fondly practised axiomatics, at any rate as a literary\nform, like Spinoza in his Ethics. Still, a truly satisfactory\nand, if one may say so, serious instance of axiomatization of a branch\nof knowledge was not available in print until 1882, when Moritz Pasch\n(b. 1843, d. 1930) published his Lectures on Modern\nGeometry.  \n\nPasch viewed geometry as a natural science, whose successful\nutilization by other sciences and in practical life rests “exclusively\non the fact that geometrical concepts originally agreed exactly with\nempirical objects” (Pasch 1882, p. iii). Geometry distinguishes itself\nfrom other natural sciences because it obtains only very few concepts\nand laws directly from experience, and aims at obtaining from them the\nlaws of more complex phenomena by purely deductive means. The empirical\nfoundation of geometry was encapsulated by Pasch in a core of basic\nconcepts and basic statements or axioms. The basic concepts refer to\nthe shape and size of bodies and their positions relative to one\nanother. They are not defined, for no definition could replace the\n“exhibition of appropriate natural objects,” which is the only road to\nunderstanding such simple, irreducible notions (ibid., p. 16). All\nother geometric concepts must be ultimately defined in terms of the\nbasic ones. The basic concepts are connected to one another by the\naxioms, which “state what has been observed in certain very simple\ndiagrams” (p. 43). All other geometric statements must be proved from\nthe axioms by the strictest deductive methods. Everything that is\nneeded to prove them must be recorded, without exception, in the\naxioms. These must therefore embody the whole empirical material\nelaborated by geometry, so that “after they are established it is no\nlonger necessary to resort to sense perceptions” (p. 17). “Every\nconclusion which occurs in a proof must find its confirmation in the\ndiagram, but it is not justified by the diagram, but by a definite\nearlier statement (or definition)” (p. 43). Pasch understood clearly\nthe implications of his method. He writes (p. 98): \n\nPasch's Lectures on Modern Geometry dealt with projective\ngeometry. The first axiomatization of Euclidean geometry that was up to\nPasch's standards—Foundations of Geometry by David\nHilbert (b. 1862, d. 1943)—appeared in 1899 and\nexercised enormous influence on twentieth century mathematics and\nphilosophy. Hilbert invites the reader to consider three arbitrary\ncollections of objects, which he calls ‘points’,\n‘straight lines’ and ‘planes’, and five\nundefined relations between (i) a point and a straight line, (ii) a\nstraight line and a plane, (iii) three points, (iv) two pairs of points\n(‘segments’) and (v) two equivalence classes of point\ntriples (‘angles’). The conditions prescribed in Hilbert's\n20 axioms—including the Axiom of Completeness added in the second\nedition—are sufficient to characterize the said objects and\nrelations up to isomorphism. Isomorphism—i.e., structural\nequivalence—can hold, however, between different, intuitively\ndisparate, systems of objects. Hilbert availed himself of this feature\nof axiomatic theories for studying the independence of some axioms from\nthe rest. To prove it he proposed actual instances (models) of the\nstructure determined by all axioms but one, plus the negation of the\nomitted one. Frege complained that the geometric axioms retained in\nthese exercises could be applied to Hilbert's far-fetched models only\nby tampering with the natural meaning of words (cf. Alice's\nconversation with Humpty Dumpty). Hilbert replied on 29 December 1899:  \n\nAll this follows, of course, from the very nature of axiomatics, as\nexplained in the passage quoted from Pasch. Indeed, such\ntruth-preserving semantic permutations were no news in geometry after\nGergonne (1771–1859) drew attention in 1825 to the following\nprinciple of duality: Any true statement of projective plane\ngeometry gives rise to another, equally true, dual statement obtained\nby substituting ‘point’ for ‘line’,\n‘collinear’ for ‘concurrent’,\n‘meet’ for ‘join’, and vice versa, wherever\nthese words occur in the former. (In projective space geometry, duality\nholds for points and planes.) The same result is secured, of course, by\nexchanging not the words, but their meanings.  \n\nIn a lecture “On the hypotheses that lie at the foundation of\ngeometry”, delivered to the Faculty of Philosophy at Göttingen in\n1854 and posthumously published in 1867, Bernhard Riemann\n(b. 1826, d. 1866) presented some radically innovative views\non this matter. He noted that the measurable properties of a discrete\nmanifold can be readily determined by counting. (Think of the\npopulation of a country, and the proportion of born-again Christians,\nor of couples who divorced within the first year of their marriage.)\nBut continuous manifolds do not admit this approach. In particular, the\nmeasurable properties of physical space, which are the subject of\ngeometry, depend on the binding forces that act on it. The distance\nbetween two points in space can be ascertained with a rod, or a tape,\nor by optical means, and the result depends essentially on the physical\nbehavior of the instruments used. Up to now, the measurable properties\nof space have been successfully described in accordance with Euclidean\ngeometry. However, “the empirical concepts on which the metric\ndeterminations of space are based—the concepts of a rigid body\nand a light ray—lose their validity in the infinitely small; it\nis therefore quite likely that the metric relations of space in the\ninfinitely small do not agree with the assumptions of geometry, and in\nfact one would have to accept this as soon as the phenomena can thereby\nbe explained in a simpler way” (Riemann 1854, p. 149). To prepare\nphysicists for this eventuality, Riemann proposed a more general\nconception of geometry. Riemann's basic scheme makes allowance for much\ngreater generality than he actually reaches for; but, in his judgment,\nit should be enough for the time being to characterize the geometry of\ncontinuous manifolds in such a way that it agrees optimally with\nEuclidean geometry on a small neighborhood of each point.  \n\nRiemann extends to n dimensions the methods employed by Gauss\n(1828) in his study of the intrinsic geometry of curved surfaces\nembedded in Euclidean space (called ‘intrinsic’ because it\ndescribes the metric properties that the surfaces display by\nthemselves, independently of the way they lie in space). Looking back\nat Gauss's work one gets a better intuitive feel for Riemann's\nconcepts (see Torretti 1978, pp. 68–82). However, for the sake of\nconciseness and perspicuity, it is advisable to look forward and to\navail oneself of certain concepts introduced by later mathematicians\nas they tried to make sense of Riemann's proposal. Consider the modern\nformulation of Riemann's theory in the supplement\n A Modern Formulation of Riemann's Theory. \n\nIn his study of curved surfaces, Gauss introduced a real-valued\nfunction, the Gaussian curvature, which measures a surface's\nlocal deviation from flatness in terms of the surface's intrinsic\ngeometry. Riemann extended this concept of curvature to Riemannian\nn-manifolds. By using his extended concept of curvature, he was able to\ncharacterize with great elegance the metric manifolds in which all\nfigures can freely move around without changing their size and shape.\nThey are the Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature. This\nidea can be nicely combined with Klein's classification of metric\ngeometries. Regarded as Riemannian 3-manifolds, Euclidean space has\nconstant zero curvature, Lobachevskian space has constant negative\ncurvature, and elliptic space has constant positive curvature. Pursuant\nto the Erlangen Program, each of these geometries of constant curvature\nis characterized by its own group of isometries. But Klein's conception\nis too narrow to embrace all Riemannian geometries, which include\nspaces of variable curvature. Indeed, in the general case, the group of\nisometries of a Riemannian n-manifold is the trivial group consisting\nof the identity alone, whose structure conveys no information at all\nabout the respective geometry. \n\nFor a philosopher, the most satisfying feature of the tremendous\ncomplication attained by 19th-century mathematics was perhaps the\npromptness with which the newly created (or discovered?) mathematical\nstructures found their way into empirical science, enabling the\nintellectual grasp and handling of actual phenomena. We shall wind up\nthis survey of 19th-century geometry with a few light remarks on a\nparticularly rich and fruitful structure that has pride of place in\ncurrent physics, namely, Lie groups, so called after Sophus Lie\n(1842–1899), the Norwegian mathematician who studied them in\ndepth after 1870. A Lie group is, of course, a group in the algebraic\nsense we met in §3, that is, a set G such that (i) every\nordered pair <x,y> ∈ G is associated\nto a unique element x · y\n∈ G (known as the product or the sum\nof x and y); (ii) the product operation is associative,\ni.e., (x · y)\n· z = x ·\n(y · z), for\nevery x, y, z ∈ G; (iii) there is a\none and only one element 0 ∈ G such that for\nevery x ∈ G, x ·\n0 = 0 · x = x (0\nis the identity or neutral element of G); (iv)\nfor every x ∈ G, there is one and only one\nelement x−1 ∈ G such\nthat x\n· x−1 = 0\n(x−1 is known as the inverse\nof x). But a Lie group is also a smooth manifold, as described\nin the supplement\n A Modern Formulation of Riemann's Theory: \n the set G can be\nrepresented patchwise by systems of real-valued (or alternatively\ncomplex-valued) coordinates, mutually linked by well-defined,\ndifferentiable coordinate transformations wherever their respective\npatches overlap. The group and manifold structures of G are meshed\ntogether by the condition that the product operation is a\ndifferentiable mapping of G × G into G. \n\nA simple, yet important, example of a Lie group is the group SO(2),\ninstantiated by the rotations of the plane about an arbitrary fixed\npoint. The manifold is topologically compact and therefore cannot be\ncovered by a single coordinate patch, but three will suffice: one\nincluding, say, all counterclockwise rotations by more than three\nradians and less than four, which can be naturally coordinatized using\nthe real numbers in the open interval (3,4); another patch comprising\nthe inverses of the former, which can be mapped onto the open interval\n(−4,−3), and a third one covering all counterclockwise\nrotations by less than two right angles plus their clockwise inverses,\nwhich can be mapped onto the open interval\n(−π,π). Indeed, all the groups we encountered in\n§3, which Klein used for characterizing the Euclidean geometry of\nspace and the classical Non-Euclidean geometries, are Lie groups, and\ntheir respective smooth manifold structures allow for topological\nquirks. Thus the Euclidean isometries constitute a disconnected\nmanifold, with mirror reflection not included in the same component as\nthe subgroup of Euclidean motions.  \n\nLike all smooth manifolds, a Lie group G has a tangent vector\nspace attached to each element. In particular, the tangent space at\nthe neutral element 0 of G becomes the Lie algebra\nof G by the definition of the so-called Lie bracket, a\nbilinear mapping of T0G\n× T0G\ninto T0G, which, for\nall u,v,w in T0G\nsatisfies the condition [u,u] = 0 and the Jacobi\nidentity: [u,[v,w]] +\n[v,[w,u]] + [w,[u,v]] =\n0. The Lie algebra of G throws much light on the structure\nof G through the homeomorphic (“exponential”) mapping of a\nneighborhood of 0 ∈ T0G into a\nneighborhood of 0 ∈ G.  \nIn the supplement\n A Modern Formulation of Riemann's Theory\n we touch on the idea of a fiber bundle, formed by two smooth\nmanifolds F and M, bound together by a “projection”\nmapping π of F onto M, which partitions the\nmanifold F into “fibers”, mapped by π to the different\npoints of M. A fiber bundle <F,M,π>\nbecomes a principal fiber bundle\n<F,M,π,G> if a Lie group G,\nknown as the bundle's structure group, acts on F in such\na way that each fiber of F is an orbit of the action and a few\nother conditions are met. For instance, the Lorentz group is the\nstructure group of the principal fiber bundle of tetrads (orthonormal\n4-tuples of tangent vectors at each point) on any relativistic\nspacetime, no matter how bizarre. In such ways, Lie groups provide a\nmeans of unifying the many models allowed by a physical theory and of\nintroducing some degree of homogeneity among them.  \nDuring the last third of the 20th-century, fibre bundles and their Lie\ngroups have virtually taken over fundamental physics. This is not the\nplace to explain how or why, but the unstoppable evolution of physics\ntowards ever more mathematically sophisticated, prima facie\nless straightforward representations of its subject-matter, deserves\nthe attention of philosophers. It is clear that the concept of a\ndefinite stable thing out there, which might, at least in principle,\nbe held and manipulated, is no longer so serviceable to us as it was\nonce to our flint-carving ancestors.
