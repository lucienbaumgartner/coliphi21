Not only authors writing in the \nperipatetic tradition, but also the famous Roman teachers of \nrhetoric, such as Cicero and Quintilian, frequently used elements \nstemming from the Aristotelian doctrine. Nevertheless, these authors \nwere interested neither in an authentic interpretation of the \nAristotelian works nor in the philosophical sources and backgrounds \nof the vocabulary that Aristotle had introduced to rhetorical theory.\nThus, for two millennia the interpretation of Aristotelian rhetoric \nhas become a matter of the history of rhetoric, not of philosophy. In\nthe most influential manuscripts and editions, Aristotle's \nRhetoric was surrounded by rhetorical works and even written\nspeeches of other Greek and Latin authors, and was seldom interpreted\nin the context of the whole Corpus Aristotelicum. It was not until \nthe last few decades that the philosophically salient features of the\nAristotelian rhetoric were rediscovered: in construing a general \ntheory of the persuasive, Aristotle applies numerous concepts and \narguments that are also treated in his logical, ethical, and \npsychological writings. His theory of rhetorical arguments, for \nexample, is only one further application of his general doctrine of \nthe sullogismos, which also forms the basis of dialectic, \nlogic, and his theory of demonstration. Another example is the \nconcept of emotions: though emotions are one of the most important \ntopics in the Aristotelian ethics, he nowhere offers such an \nilluminating account of single emotions as in the Rhetoric. \nFinally, it is the Rhetoric, too, that informs us about the \ncognitive features of language and style. \n\n\n\nAccording to ancient testimonies, Aristotle wrote an early dialogue \non rhetoric entitled ‘Grullos’, in which he put \nforward the argument that rhetoric cannot be an art \n(technê); and since this is precisely the position of \nPlato's Gorgias, the lost dialogue Grullos has \ntraditionally been regarded as a sign of Aristotle's (alleged) early \nPlatonism. But the evidence for the position of this dialogue is too \ntenuous to support such strong conclusions: it also could have been a\n‘dialectical’ dialogue, which listed the pros and cons of\nthe thesis that rhetoric is an art. We do not know much more about \nthe so-called ‘Technê Sunagogê’, a \ncollection of previous theories of rhetoric that is also ascribed to \nAristotle. Cicero seems to use this collection itself, or at least a \nsecondary source relying on it, as his main historical source when he\ngives a short survey of the history of pre-Aristotelian rhetoric in \nhis Brutus 46–48. Finally, Aristotle once mentions a \nwork called ‘Theodecteia’ which has also been \nsupposed to be Aristotelian; but more probably he meant the \nrhetorical handbook of his follower Theodectes, who was a former \npupil of Isocrates.  \n\nWhat has come down to us are just the three books on rhetoric, which \nwe know as The Rhetoric, though the ancient catalogue of the\nAristotelian works, reported by Diogenes Laertius, mentions only two \nbooks on rhetoric (perhaps our Rhetoric I & II), and two\nfurther books on style (perhaps our Rhetoric III?). Whereas \nmost modern authors agree that at least the core of Rhet. I \n& II presents a coherent rhetorical theory, the two themes of \nRhet. III are not mentioned in the agenda of Rhet. \nI & II. The conceptual link between Rhet. I & II and\nRhet. III is not given until the very last sentence of the \nsecond book. It is quite understandable that the authenticity of this\nad hoc composition has been questioned: we cannot exclude \nthe possibility that these two parts of the Rhetoric were \nnot put together until the first edition of Aristotle's works \ncompleted by Andronicus in the first century. In the Poetics\n(1456a33) we find a cross-reference to a work called \n‘Rhetoric’ which obviously refers to \nRhet. I & II, but excludes Rhet. III. \nRegardless of such doubts, the systematic idea that links the two \nheterogeneous parts of the Rhetoric does not at all seem to \nbe unreasonable: it is not enough to have a supply of things to say \n(the so-called “thought”), the theorist of rhetoric must \nalso inform us about the right way to say those things (the so-called\n“style”). \n\nThe chronological fixing of the Rhetoric has turned out to \nbe a delicate matter. At least the core of Rhet. I & II \nseems to be an early work, written during Aristotle's first stay in \nAthens (it is unclear, however, which chapters belong to that core; \nregularly mentioned are the chapters I.4–15 and II.1–17).\nIt is true that the Rhetoric refers to historical events \nthat fall in the time of Aristotle's exile and his second stay in \nAthens, but most of them can be found in the chapters II.23–24,\nand besides this, examples could have been updated, which is \nespecially plausible if we assume that the Rhetoric formed \nthe basis of a lecture held several times. Most striking are the \naffinities to the (also early) Topics; if, as it is widely \nagreed, the Topics represents a pre-syllogistic state of \nAristotelian logic, the same is true of the Rhetoric: we \nactually find no hints of syllogistic inventory in it. \n\nThe structure of Rhet. I & II is determined by two \ntripartite divisions. The first division consists in the distinction \namong the three means of persuasion: The speech can produce \npersuasion either through the character of the speaker, the emotional\nstate of the listener, or the argument (logos) itself (see \nbelow \n §5).\n The second tripartite division concerns the three species of public \nspeech. The speech that takes place in the assembly is defined as the\ndeliberative species. In this rhetorical species, the speaker either \nadvises the audience to do something or warns against doing \nsomething. Accordingly, the audience has to judge things that are \ngoing to happen in the future, and they have to decide whether these \nfuture events are good or bad for the polis, whether they will cause \nadvantage or harm. The speech that takes place before a court is \ndefined as the judicial species. The speaker either accuses somebody \nor defends herself or someone else. Naturally, this kind of speech \ntreats things that happened in the past. The audience or rather jury \nhas to judge whether a past event was just or unjust, i.e., whether \nit was according to the law or contrary to the law. While the \ndeliberative and judicial species have their context in a \ncontroversial situation in which the listener has to decide in favor \nof one of two opposing parties, the third species does not aim at \nsuch a decision: the epideictic speech praises or blames somebody, it\ntries to describe things or deeds of the respective person as \nhonorable or shameful.  \n\nThe first book of the Rhetoric treats the three species in \nsuccession. Rhet. I.4–8 deals with the deliberative, \nI.9 with the epideictic, I.10–14 the judicial species. These \nchapters are understood as contributing to the argumentative mode of \npersuasion or—more precisely—to that part of \nargumentative persuasion that is specific to the respective species \nof persuasion. The second part of the argumentative persuasion that \nis common to all three species of rhetorical speech is treated in the\nchapters II.19–26. The second means of persuasion, which works \nby evoking the emotions of the audience, is described in the chapters\nII.2–11. Though the following chapters II.12–17 treat \ndifferent types of character these chapters do not, as is often \nassumed, develop the third means of persuasion, which depends on the \ncharacter of the speaker. The underlying theory of this means of \npersuasion is elaborated in a few lines of chapter II.1. The \naforementioned chapters II.12–17 give information about \ndifferent types of character and their disposition to emotional \nresponse, which can be useful for those speakers who want to arouse \nthe emotions of the audience. Why the chapters on the argumentative \nmeans of persuasion are separated by the treatment of emotions and \ncharacter (in II.2–17) remains a riddle, especially since the \nchapter II.18 tries to give a link between the specific and the \ncommon aspects of argumentative persuasion. Rhetoric \nIII.1–12 discusses several questions of style (see below \n §8.1),\n Rhetoric III.13–19 is on the several parts of a speech. \n\nAristotle stresses that rhetoric is closely related to dialectic. He \noffers several formulas to describe this affinity between the two \ndisciplines: first of all, rhetoric is said to be a \n“counterpart” (antistrophos) to dialectic \n(Rhet. I.1, 1354a1); (ii) it is also called an \n“outgrowth” (paraphues ti) of dialectic and the \nstudy of character (Rhet. I.2, 1356a25f.); finally, \nAristotle says that rhetoric is part of dialectic and resembles it \n(Rhet. I.2, 1356a30f.). In saying that rhetoric is a \ncounterpart to dialectic, Aristotle obviously alludes to Plato's \nGorgias (464bff.), where rhetoric is ironically defined as a\ncounterpart to cookery in the soul. Since, in this passage, Plato \nuses the word ‘antistrophos’ to designate an \nanalogy, it is likely that Aristotle wants to express a kind of \nanalogy too: what dialectic is for the (private or academic) practice\nof attacking and maintaining an argument, rhetoric is for the \n(public) practice of defending oneself or accusing an opponent.  \n\nThis analogy between rhetoric and dialectic can be substantiated by \nseveral common features of both disciplines: \n\nThe analogy to dialectic has important implications for the status of\nrhetoric. Plato argued in his Gorgias that rhetoric cannot \nbe an art (technê), since it is not related to a \ndefinite subject, while real arts are defined by their specific \nsubjects, as e.g. medicine or shoemaking are defined by their \nproducts, i.e., health and shoes. However, though dialectic has no \ndefinite subject, it is easy to see that it nevertheless rests on a \nmethod, because dialectic has to grasp the reason why some arguments \nare valid and others are not. Now, if rhetoric is nothing but the \ncounterpart to dialectic in the domain of public speech, it must be \ngrounded in an investigation of what is persuasive and what is not, \nand this, in turn, qualifies rhetoric as an art. \n\nFurther, it is central to both disciplines that they deal with \narguments from accepted premises. Hence the rhetorician who wants to \npersuade by arguments or (rhetorical) proofs can adapt most of the \ndialectical equipment. Nevertheless, persuasion that takes place \nbefore a public audience is not only a matter of arguments \nand proofs, but also of credibility and emotional attitudes. This is \nwhy there are also remarkable differences between the two \ndisciplines: \n\nAristotle defines the rhetorician as someone who is always able to \nsee what is persuasive (Topics VI.12, 149b25). \nCorrespondingly, rhetoric is defined as the ability to see what is \npossibly persuasive in every given case (Rhet. I.2, \n1355b26f.). This is not to say that the rhetorician will be able to \nconvince under all circumstances. Rather he is in a situation similar\nto that of the physician: the latter has a complete grasp of his art \nonly if he neglects nothing that might heal his patient, though he is\nnot able to heal every patient. Similarly, the rhetorician \nhas a complete grasp of his method, if he discovers the available \nmeans of persuasion, though he is not able to convince \neverybody.  \n\nAristotelian rhetoric as such is a neutral tool that can be used by \npersons of virtuous or depraved character. This capacity can be used \nfor good or bad purposes; it can cause great benefits as well as \ngreat harms. There is no doubt that Aristotle himself regards his \nsystem of rhetoric as something useful, but the good purposes for \nwhich rhetoric is useful do not define the rhetorical capacity as \nsuch. Thus, Aristotle does not hesitate to concede on the one hand \nthat his art of rhetoric can be misused. But on the other hand he \ntones down the risk of misuse by stressing several factors: \nGenerally, it is true of all goods, except virtue, that they can be \nmisused. Secondly, using rhetoric of the Aristotelian style, it is \neasier to convince of the just and good than of their opposites. \nFinally, the risk of misuse is compensated by the benefits that can \nbe accomplished by rhetoric of the Aristotelian style.  \n\nIt could still be objected that rhetoric is only useful for those who\nwant to outwit their audience and conceal their real aims, since \nsomeone who just wants to communicate the truth could be \nstraightforward and would not need rhetorical tools. This, however, \nis not Aristotle's point of view: Even those who just try to \nestablish what is just and true need the help of rhetoric when they \nare faced with a public audience. Aristotle tells us that it is \nimpossible to teach such an audience, even if the speaker had the \nmost exact knowledge of the subject. Obviously he thinks that the \naudience of a public speech consists of ordinary people who are not \nable to follow an exact proof based on the principles of a science. \nFurther, such an audience can easily be distracted by factors that do\nnot pertain to the subject at all; sometimes they are receptive to \nflattery or just try to increase their own advantage. And this \nsituation becomes even worse if the constitution, the laws, and the \nrhetorical habits in a city are bad. Finally, most of the topics that\nare usually discussed in public speeches do not allow of exact \nknowledge, but leave room for doubt; especially in such cases it is \nimportant that the speaker seems to be a credible person and that the\naudience is in a sympathetic mood. For all those reasons, affecting \nthe decisions of juries and assemblies is a matter of persuasiveness,\nnot of knowledge. It is true that some people manage to be persuasive\neither at random or by habit, but it is rhetoric that gives us a \nmethod to discover all means of persuasion on any \ntopic whatsoever.  \n\nAristotle joins Plato in criticizing contemporary manuals of \nrhetoric. But how does he manage to distinguish his own project from \nthe criticized manuals? The general idea seems to be this: Previous \ntheorists of rhetoric gave most of their attention to methods outside\nthe subject; they taught how to slander, how to arouse emotions in \nthe audience, or how to distract the attention of the hearers from \nthe subject. This style of rhetoric promotes a situation in which \njuries and assemblies no longer form rational judgments about the \ngiven issues, but surrender to the litigants. Aristotelian rhetoric \nis different in this respect: it is centered on the rhetorical kind \nof proof, the enthymeme (see below \n §6),\n which is called the most important means of persuasion. Since people \nare most strongly convinced when they suppose that something has been\nproven (Rhet. I.1, 1355a5f.), there is no need for the \norator to confuse or distract the audience by the use of emotional \nappeals, etc. In Aristotle's view an orator will be even more \nsuccessful when he just picks up the convincing aspects of a given \nissue, thereby using commonly-held opinions as premises. Since people\nhave a natural disposition for the true (Rhet. I.1, \n1355a15f.) and every man has some contribution to make to the truth \n(Eudemian Ethics I.6, 1216b31,) there is no unbridgeable gap\nbetween the commonly-held opinions and what is true. This alleged \naffinity between the true and the persuasive justifies Aristotle's \nproject of a rhetoric that essentially relies on the persuasiveness \nof pertinent argumentation; and it is just this argumentative \ncharacter of Aristotelian rhetoric that explains the close affinity \nbetween rhetoric and dialectic (see above \n §3).\n  \n\nOf course, Aristotle's rhetoric covers non-argumentative tools of \npersuasion as well. He tells the orator how to stimulate emotions and\nhow to make himself credible (see below \n §5);\n his art of rhetoric includes considerations about delivery and style \n(see below \n §8.1)\n and the parts of a speech. It is understandable that several \ninterpreters found an insoluble tension between the argumentative \nmeans of pertinent rhetoric and non-argumentative tools that aim at \nwhat is outside the subject. It does not seem, however, that \nAristotle himself saw a major conflict between these diverse tools of\npersuasion—presumably for the following reasons: (i) He leaves \nno doubt that the subject that is treated in a speech has the highest\npriority (e.g. Rhet. III.1, 1403b18–27). Thus, it is \nnot surprising that there are even passages that regard the \nnon-argumentative tools as a sort of accidental contribution to the \nprocess of persuasion, which essentially proceeds in the manner of \ndialectic (cp. Rhet. I.1, 1354a15). (ii) There are, he says \n(III.1, 1404a2f.), methods that are not right, but necessary because \nof certain deficiencies of the audience. His point seems to be that \nthe argumentative method becomes less effective, the worse the \ncondition of the audience is. This again is to say that it is due to \nthe badness of the audience when his rhetoric includes aspects that \nare not in line with the idea of argumentative and pertinent \nrhetoric. (iii) In dealing with methods of traditional rhetoric, \nAristotle obviously assumes that even methods that have traditionally\nbeen used instead of argumentation can be refined so that they \nsupport the aim of an argumentative style of rhetoric. The prologue \nof a speech, for example, was traditionally used for appeals to the \nlistener, but it can also be used to set out the issue of the speech,\nthus contributing to its clearness. Similarly, the epilogue has \ntraditionally been used to arouse emotions like pity or anger; but as\nsoon as the epilogue recalls the conclusions reached, it will make \nthe speech more understandable.  \n\n The\n systematical core of Aristotle's Rhetoric is the doctrine \nthat there are three technical means of persuasion. The attribute \n‘technical’ implies two characteristics: (i) Technical \npersuasion must rest on a method, and this, in turn, is to say that \nwe must know the reason why some things are persuasive and some are \nnot. Further, methodical persuasion must rest on a complete analysis \nof what it means to be persuasive. (ii) Technical means of persuasion\nmust be provided by the speaker himself, whereas preexisting facts, \nsuch as oaths, witnesses, testimonies, etc. are non-technical, since \nthey cannot be prepared by the speaker. \n\nA speech consists of three things: the speaker, the subject that is \ntreated in the speech, and the listener to whom the speech is \naddressed (Rhet. I.3, 1358a37ff.). It seems that this is why\nonly three technical means of persuasion are possible: Technical \nmeans of persuasion are either (a) in the character of the speaker, \nor (b) in the emotional state of the hearer, or (c) in the argument \n(logos) itself. \n\n(a) The persuasion is accomplished by character whenever the speech \nis held in such a way as to render the speaker worthy of credence. If\nthe speaker appears to be credible, the audience will form the \nsecond-order judgment that propositions put forward by the credible \nspeaker are true or acceptable. This is especially important in cases\nwhere there is no exact knowledge but room for doubt. But how does \nthe speaker manage to appear a credible person? He must display (i) \npractical intelligence (phronêsis), (ii) a virtuous \ncharacter, and (iii) good will (Rhet. II.1, 1378a6ff.); for,\nif he displayed none of them, the audience would doubt that he is \nable to give good advice at all. Again, if he displayed (i) without \n(ii) and (iii), the audience could doubt whether the aims of the \nspeaker are good. Finally, if he displayed (i) and (ii) without \n(iii), the audience could still doubt whether the speaker gives the \nbest suggestion, though he knows what it is. But if he displays all \nof them, Aristotle concludes, it cannot rationally be doubted that \nhis suggestions are credible. It must be stressed that the speaker \nmust accomplish these effects by what he says; it is not \nnecessary that he is actually virtuous: on the contrary, a \npreexisting good character cannot be part of the technical means of \npersuasion. \n\n(b) The success of the persuasive efforts depends on the emotional \ndispositions of the audience; for we do not judge in the same way \nwhen we grieve and rejoice or when we are friendly and hostile. Thus,\nthe orator has to arouse emotions exactly because emotions have the \npower to modify our judgments: to a judge who is in a friendly mood, \nthe person about whom he is going to judge seems not to do wrong or \nonly in a small way; but to the judge who is in an angry mood, the \nsame person will seem to do the opposite (cp. Rhet. II.1, \n1378a1ff.). Many interpreters writing on the rhetorical emotions were\nmisled by the role of the emotions in Aristotle's ethics: they \nsuggested that the orator has to arouse the emotions in order (i) to \nmotivate the audience or (ii) to make them better persons (since \nAristotle requires that virtuous persons do the right things together\nwith the right emotions). Thesis (i) is false for the simple reason \nthat the aim of rhetorical persuasion is a certain judgment \n(krisis), not an action or practical decision \n(prohairesis). Thesis (ii) is false, because moral education\nis not the purpose of rhetoric (see above \n §4),\n nor could it be effected by a public speech: “Now if speeches \nwere in themselves enough to make men good, they would justly, as \nTheognis says, have won very great rewards, and such rewards should \nhave been provided; but as things are … they are not able to \nencourage the many to nobility and goodness.” (EN X.9. \n1179b4–10) \n\nHow is it possible for the orator to bring the audience to a certain \nemotion? Aristotle's technique essentially rests on the knowledge of \nthe definition of every significant emotion. Let, for example, anger \nbe defined as “desire, accompanied with pain, for conspicuous \nrevenge for a conspicuous slight that was directed against oneself or\nthose near to one, when such a slight is undeserved.” (Rhet. \nII.2 1378a31–33). According to such a definition, someone who \nbelieves that he has suffered a slight from a person who is not \nentitled to do so, etc., will become angry. If we take such a \ndefinition for granted, it is possible to deduce circumstances in \nwhich a person will most probably be angry; for example, we can \ndeduce (i) in what state of mind people are angry and (ii) against \nwhom they are angry and (iii) for what sorts of reason. Aristotle \ndeduces these three factors for several emotions in the chapters \nII.2–11. With this equipment, the orator will be able, for \nexample, to highlight such characteristics of a case as are likely to\nprovoke anger in the audience. In comparison with the tricks of \nformer rhetoricians, this method of arousing emotions has a striking \nadvantage: The orator who wants to arouse emotions must not even \nspeak outside the subject; it is sufficient to detect aspects of a \ngiven subject that are causally connected with the intended emotion. \n\n(c) We persuade by the argument itself when we demonstrate or seem to\ndemonstrate that something is the case. For Aristotle, there are two \nspecies of arguments: inductions and deductions (Posterior \nAnalytics I.1, 71a5ff.). Induction \n(epagôgê) is defined as the proceeding from \nparticulars up to a universal (Topics I.12, 105a13ff.). A \ndeduction (sullogismos) is an argument in which, certain \nthings having been supposed, something different from the \nsuppositions results of necessity through them (Topics I.1, \n100a25ff.) or because of their being true (Prior Analytics \nI.2, 24b18–20). The inductive argument in rhetoric is the \nexample (paradeigma); unlike other inductive arguments, it \ndoes not proceed from many particular cases to one universal case, \nbut from one particular to a similar particular if both particulars \nfall under the same genus (Rhet. I.2, 1357b25ff.). The \ndeductive argument in rhetoric is the enthymeme (see below \n §6):\n  \n\nIt is remarkable that Aristotle uses the qualification “either \nuniversally or for the most part”: obviously, he wants to say \nthat in some cases the conclusion follows universally, i.e., by \nnecessity, while in other cases it follows only for the most \npart. At first glance, this seems to be inconsistent, since a \nnon-necessary inference is no longer a deduction. However, it has \nbeen disputed whether in arguments from probable premises the formula\n“for the most part” qualifies the inference itself \n(“If for the most part such and such is the case it follows\nfor the most part that something different is the case”), \nor only the conclusion (“If for the most part such and such is \nthe case it follows by necessity that for the most \npart something different is the case”). If the former \ninterpretation is true, then Aristotle concedes in the very \ndefinition of the enthymeme that some enthymemes are not deductive. \nBut if the latter interpretation (which has a parallel in An. \npost. 87b23–25) is correct, an enthymeme whose premises \nand conclusion are for the most part true would still be a valid \ndeduction.  \n\nFor Aristotle, an enthymeme is what has the function of a proof or \ndemonstration in the domain of public speech, since a demonstration \nis a kind of sullogismos and the enthymeme is said to be a \nsullogismos too. The word ‘enthymeme’ \n(from ‘enthumeisthai—to consider’) had \nalready been coined by Aristotle's predecessors and originally \ndesignated clever sayings, bon mots, and short arguments involving a \nparadox or contradiction. The concepts ‘proof’ \n(apodeixis) and ‘sullogismos’ play a \ncrucial role in Aristotle's logical-dialectical theory. In applying \nthem to a term of conventional rhetoric, Aristotle appeals to a \nwell-known rhetorical technique, but, at the same time, restricts and\ncodifies the original meaning of ‘enthymeme’: properly \nunderstood, what people call ‘enthymeme’ should \nhave the form of a sullogismos, i.e., a deductive argument.  \n\nIn general, Aristotle regards deductive arguments as a set of \nsentences in which some sentences are premises and one is the \nconclusion, and the inference from the premises to the conclusion is \nguaranteed by the premises alone. Since enthymemes in the proper \nsense are expected to be deductive arguments, the minimal requirement\nfor the formulation of enthymemes is that they have to display the \npremise-conclusion structure of deductive arguments. This is why \nenthymemes have to include a statement as well as a kind of reason \nfor the given statement. Typically this reason is given in a \nconditional ‘if’-clause or a causal ‘since’- \nor ‘for’-clause. Examples of the former, conditional type\nare: “If not even the gods know everything, human beings can \nhardly do so.” “If the war is the cause of present evils,\nthings should be set right by making peace.” Examples of the \nlatter, causal type are: “One should not be educated, for one \nought not be envied (and educated people are usually envied).” \n“She has given birth, for she has milk.” Aristotle \nstresses that the sentence “There is no man among us who is \nfree” taken for itself is a maxim, but becomes an enthymeme as \nsoon as it is used together with a reason such as “for all are \nslaves of money or of chance (and no slave of money or chance is \nfree).” Sometimes the required reason may even be implicit, as \ne.g. in the sentence “As a mortal, do not cherish immortal \nanger” the reason why one should not cherish mortal anger is \nimplicitly given in the phrase “immortal,” which alludes \nto the rule that is not appropriate for mortal beings to have such an\nattitude.  \n\nAristotle calls the enthymeme the “body of persuasion”, \nimplying that everything else is only an addition or accident to the \ncore of the persuasive process. The reason why the enthymeme, as the \nrhetorical kind of proof or demonstration, should be regarded as \ncentral to the rhetorical process of persuasion is that we are most \neasily persuaded when we think that something has been demonstrated. \nHence, the basic idea of a rhetorical demonstration seems to be this:\nIn order to make a target group believe that q, the orator \nmust first select a sentence p or some sentences \np1 … pn that are \nalready accepted by the target group; secondly he has to show that \nq can be derived from p or p1 \n… pn, using p or \np1 … pn as premises. \nGiven that the target persons form their beliefs in accordance with \nrational standards, they will accept q as soon as they \nunderstand that q can be demonstrated on the basis of their \nown opinions.  \n\nConsequently, the construction of enthymemes is primarily a matter of\ndeducing from accepted opinions (endoxa). Of course, it is \nalso possible to use premises that are not commonly accepted by \nthemselves, but can be derived from commonly accepted opinions; other\npremises are only accepted since the speaker is held to be credible; \nstill other enthymemes are built from signs: see \n §6.5.\n That a deduction is made from accepted opinions—as opposed to \ndeductions from first and true sentences or principles—is the \ndefining feature of dialectical argumentation in the Aristotelian \nsense. Thus, the formulation of enthymemes is a matter of dialectic, \nand the dialectician has the competence that is needed for the \nconstruction of enthymemes. If enthymemes are a subclass of \ndialectical arguments, then it is natural to expect a specific \ndifference by which one can tell enthymemes apart from all other \nkinds of dialectical arguments (traditionally, commentators regarded \nlogical incompleteness as such a difference; for some objections \nagainst the traditional view, see \n §6.4).\n Nevertheless, this expectation is somehow misled: The enthymeme is \ndifferent from other kinds of dialectical arguments, insofar as it is\nused in the rhetorical context of public speech (and rhetorical \narguments are called ‘enthymemes’); thus, no further \nformal or qualitative differences are needed. \n\nHowever, in the rhetorical context there are two factors that the \ndialectician has to keep in mind if she wants to become a rhetorician\ntoo, and if the dialectical argument is to become a successful \nenthymeme. First, the typical subjects of public speech do \nnot—as the subject of dialectic and theoretical \nphilosophy—belong to the things that are necessarily the case, \nbut are among those things that are the goal of practical \ndeliberation and can also be otherwise. Second, as opposed to \nwell-trained dialecticians the audience of public speech is \ncharacterized by an intellectual insufficiency; above all, the \nmembers of a jury or assembly are not accustomed to following a \nlonger chain of inferences. Therefore enthymemes must not be as \nprecise as a scientific demonstration and should be shorter than \nordinary dialectical arguments. This, however, is not to say that the\nenthymeme is defined by incompleteness and brevity. Rather, it is a \nsign of a well-executed enthymeme that the content and the number of \nits premises are adjusted to the intellectual capacities of the \npublic audience; but even an enthymeme that failed to incorporate \nthese qualities would still be enthymeme. \n\nIn a well known passage (Rhet. I.2, 1357a7–18; \nsimilar: Rhet. II.22, 1395b24–26), Aristotle says that\nthe enthymeme often has few or even fewer premises than some other \ndeductions, (sullogismoi). Since most interpreters refer the\nword ‘sullogismos’ to the syllogistic theory \n(see the entry on \n Aristotle's logic),\n according to which a proper deduction has exactly two premises, those\nlines have led to the widespread understanding that Aristotle defines\nthe enthymeme as a sullogismos in which one of two premises \nhas been suppressed, i.e., as an abbreviated, incomplete syllogism. \nBut certainly the mentioned passages do not attempt to give a \ndefinition of the enthymeme, nor does the word \n‘sullogismos’ necessarily refer to deductions \nwith exactly two premises. Properly understood, both passages are \nabout the selection of appropriate premises, not about logical \nincompleteness. The remark that enthymemes often have few or less \npremises concludes the discussion of two possible mistakes the orator\ncould make (Rhet. I.2, 1357a7–10): One can draw conclusions \nfrom things that have previously been deduced or from things that \nhave not been deduced yet. The latter method is unpersuasive, for the\npremises are not accepted, nor have they been introduced. The former \nmethod is problematic, too: if the orator has to introduce the needed\npremises by another deduction, and the premises of this pre-deduction\ntoo, etc., one will end up with a long chain of deductions. Arguments\nwith several deductive steps are common in dialectical practice, but \none cannot expect the audience of a public speech to follow such long\narguments. This is why Aristotle says that the enthymeme is and \nshould be from fewer premises.  \n\nJust as there is a difference between real and apparent or fallacious\ndeductions in dialectic, we have to distinguish between real and \napparent or fallacious enthymemes in rhetoric. The topoi for\nreal enthymemes are given in chapter II.23, for fallacious enthymemes\nin chapter II.24. The fallacious enthymeme pretends to include a \nvalid deduction, while it actually rests on a fallacious inference.  \n\nFurther, Aristotle distinguishes between enthymemes taken from \nprobable (eikos) premises and enthymemes taken from signs \n(sêmeia). (Rhet. I.2, 1357a32–33). In a \ndifferent context, he says that enthymemes are based on \nprobabilities, examples, tekmêria (i.e., proofs, \nevidences), and signs (Rhet. II.25, 1402b12–14). Since the \nso-called tekmêria are a subclass of signs and the \nexamples are used to establish general premises, this is only an \nextension of the former classification. (Note that neither \nclassification interferes with the idea that premises have to be \naccepted opinions: with respect to the signs, the audience must \nbelieve that they exist and accept that they \nindicate the existence of something else, and with respect to the \nprobabilities, people must accept that something is likely \nto happen.) However, it is not clear whether this is meant to be an \nexhaustive typology. That most of the rhetorical arguments are taken \nfrom probable premises (“For the most part it is true that \n…” “It is likely that …”) is due to \nthe typical subjects of public speech, which are rarely necessary. \nWhen using a sign-argument or sign-enthymeme we do not try to explain\na given fact; we just indicate that something exists or is \nthe case: “… anything such that when it is another thing\nis, or when it has come into being, the other has come into being \nbefore or after, is a sign of the other's being or having come into \nbeing.” (Prior Analytics II.27, 70a7ff.). But there \nare several types of sign-arguments too; Aristotle offers the \nfollowing examples: \n\nSign-arguments of type (i) and (iii) can always be refuted, even if \nthe premises are true; that is to say that they do not include a \nvalid deduction (sullogismos); Aristotle calls them \nasullogistos (non-deductive). Sign-arguments of type (ii) \ncan never be refuted if the premise is true, since, for example, it \nis not possible that someone has fever without being ill, or that \nsomeone has milk without having given birth, etc. This latter type of\nsign-enthymemes is necessary and is also called \ntekmêrion (proof, evidence). Now, if some \nsign-enthymemes are valid deductions and some are not, it is tempting\nto ask whether Aristotle regarded the non-necessary sign-enthymemes \nas apparent or fallacious arguments. However, there seems to be a \nmore attractive reading: We accept a fallacious argument only if we \nare deceived about its logical form. But we could regard, for \nexample, the inference “She is pregnant, since she is \npale” as a good and informative argument, even if we know that \nit does not include a logically necessary inference. So it seems as \nif Aristotle didn't regard all non-necessary sign-arguments as \nfallacious or deceptive; but even if this is true, it is difficult \nfor Aristotle to determine the sense in which non-necessary \nsign-enthymemes are valid arguments, since he is bound to the \nalternative of deduction and induction, and neither class seems \nappropriate for non-necessary sign-arguments. \n\nGenerally speaking, an Aristotelian topos \n(‘place’, ‘location’) is an argumentative \nscheme that enables a dialectician or rhetorician to construe an \nargument for a given conclusion. The use of so-called topoi \nor ‘loci communes’ can be traced back to early \nrhetoricians such as Protagoras, Gorgias (cp. Cicero, \nBrutus, 46–48) and Isocrates. But while in earlier \nrhetoric a topos was understood as a complete pattern or \nformula that can be mentioned at a certain stage of the speech to \nproduce a certain effect, most of the Aristotelian topoi are\ngeneral instructions saying that a conclusion of a certain form can \nbe derived from premises of a certain form; and because of this \n‘formal’ or ‘semi-formal’ character of \nAristotelian topoi, one topos can be used to \nconstrue several different arguments. Aristotle's book \nTopics lists some hundred topoi for the \nconstruction of dialectical arguments. These lists of topoi \nform the core of the method by which the dialectician should be able \nto formulate deductions on any problem that could be proposed. Most \nof the instructions that the Rhetoric gives for the \ncomposition of enthymemes are also organized as lists of \ntopoi; especially the first book of the Rhetoric \nessentially consists of topoi concerning the subjects of the\nthree species of public speech.  \n\nIt is striking that the work that is almost exclusively dedicated to \nthe collection of topoi, the book Topics, does not \neven make an attempt to define the concept of topos. At any \nrate the Rhetoric gives a sort of defining characterization:\n“I call the same thing element and topos; for an \nelement or a topos is a heading under which many enthymemes \nfall.” (Rhet. 1403a18–19) By \n‘element’ Aristotle does not mean a proper part of the \nenthymeme, but a general form under which many concrete enthymemes of\nthe same type can be subsumed. According to this definition, the \ntopos is a general argumentative form or pattern, and the \nconcrete arguments are instantiations of the general topos. \nThat the topos is a general instruction from which several \narguments can be derived, is crucial for Aristotle's understanding of\nan artful method of argumentation; for a teacher of rhetoric who \nmakes his pupils learn ready samples of arguments would not impart \nthe art itself to them, but only the products of this art, just as if\nsomeone pretending to teach the art of shoe-making only gave samples \nof already made shoes to his pupils (see Sophistical \nRefutations 183b36ff.).  \n\nThe word ‘topos’ (place, location) most probably\nis derived from an ancient method of memorizing a great number of \nitems on a list by associating them with successive places, say the \nhouses along a street, one is acquainted with. By recalling the \nhouses along the street we can also remember the associated items. \nFull descriptions of this technique can be found in Cicero, De \nOratore II 86–88, 351–360, Auctor ad \nHerennium III 16–24, 29–40 and in Quintilian, \nInstitutio XI 2, 11–33). In Topics \n163b28–32, Aristotle seems to allude to this technique: \n“For just as in the art of remembering, the mere mention of the\nplaces instantly makes us recall the things, so these will make us \nmore apt at deductions through looking to these defined premises in \norder of enumeration.” Aristotle also alludes to this technique\nin On the soul 427b18–20, On Memory \n452a12–16, and On Dreams 458b20–22.  \n\nBut though the name ‘topos’ may be derived from \nthis mnemotechnical context, Aristotle's use of topoi does \nnot rely on the technique of places. At least within the system of \nthe book Topics, every given problem must be analyzed in \nterms of some formal criteria: Does the predicate of the sentence in \nquestion ascribe a genus or a definition or peculiar or accidental \nproperties to the subject? Does the sentence express a sort of \nopposition, either contradiction or contrariety, etc.? Does the \nsentence express that something is more or less the case? Does it \nmaintain identity or diversity? Are the words used linguistically \nderived from words that are part of an accepted premise? Depending on\nsuch formal criteria of the analyzed sentence one has to refer to a \nfitting topos. For this reason, the succession of \ntopoi in the book Topics is organized in accordance\nwith their salient formal criteria; and this, again, makes a further \nmnemotechnique superfluous. More or less the same is true of the \nRhetoric—except that most of its topoi are \nstructured by material and not by formal criteria, as we shall see in\nsection 7.4. Besides all this, there is at least one passage in which\nthe use of the word ‘topos’ can be explained \nwithout referring to the previously mentioned mnemotechnique: In \nTopics VIII.1, 155b4–5 Aristotle says: “we must \nfind the location (topos) from which to attack”, where\nthe word ‘topos’ is obviously used to mean a \nstarting point for attacking the theses of the opponents. \n\nA typical Aristotelian topos runs as follows: “Again, \nif the accident of a thing has a contrary, see whether it belongs to \nthe subject to which the accident in question has been declared to \nbelong: for if the latter belongs, the former could not belong; for \nit is impossible that contrary predicates should belong at the same \ntime to the same thing.” (Topics 113a20–24). \nLike most topoi, it includes (i) a sort of general \ninstruction (“see, whether …”); further it \nmentions (ii) an argumentative scheme—in the given example, the\nscheme ‘if the accidental predicate p belongs to the \nsubject s, then the opposed P* cannot belong to \ns too’. Finally, the topos refers to (iii) a \ngeneral rule or principle (“for it is impossible, \n…”) which justifies the given scheme. Other \ntopoi often include the discussion of (iv) examples; still \nother topoi suggest (v) how to apply the given \nschemes.—Though these are elements that regularly occur in \nAristotelian topoi, there is nothing like a standard form \nwith which all topoi comply. Often Aristotle is very brief \nand leaves it to the reader to add the missing elements. \n\nIn a nutshell, the function of a topos can be explained as \nfollows. First of all, one has to select an apt topos for a \ngiven conclusion. The conclusion is either a thesis of our opponent \nthat we want to refute, or our own assertion we want to establish or \ndefend. Accordingly, there are two uses of topoi: they can \neither prove or disprove a given sentence; some can be used for both \npurposes, others for only one of them. Most topoi are \nselected by certain formal features of the given conclusion; if, for \nexample, the conclusion maintains a definition, we have to select our\ntopos from a list of topoi pertaining to \ndefinitions, etc. When it comes to the so-called \n‘material’ topoi of the Rhetoric, the \nappropriate topos must be selected not by formal criteria, \nbut in accordance with the content of the conclusion—whether, \nfor example, something is said to be useful or honorable or just, \netc. Once we have selected a topos that is appropriate for a\ngiven conclusion, the topos can be used to construe a \npremise from which the given conclusion can be derived. If for \nexample the argumentative scheme is ‘If a predicate is \ngenerally true of a genus, then the predicate is also true of any \nspecies of that genus’, we can derive the conclusion ‘the\ncapacity of nutrition belongs to plants’ using the premise \n‘the capacity of nutrition belongs to all living things’,\nsince ‘living thing’ is the genus of the species \n‘plants’. If the construed premise is accepted, either by\nthe opponent in a dialectical debate or by the audience in public \nspeech, we can draw the intended conclusion.  \n\nIt has been disputed whether the topos (or, more precisely, \nthe ‘if …, then …’ scheme that is included \nin a topos) that we use to construe an argument must itself \nbe regarded as a further premise of the argument. It could be either,\nas some say, the premise of a propositional scheme such as the modus \nponens, or, as others assume, as the conditional premise of a \nhypothetical syllogism. Aristotle himself does not favor one of these\ninterpretations explicitly. But even if he regarded the \ntopoi as additional premises in a dialectical or rhetorical \nargument, it is beyond any doubt that he did not use them as premises\nthat must be explicitly mentioned or even approved by the opponent or\naudience. \n\nRhet. III.1–12 introduces the topic of lexis,\nusually translated as ‘style’. This topic was not \nannounced until the final passage of Rhet. II, so that most \nscholars have come to think of this section as a more or less \nself-contained treatise. The insertion of this treatise into the \nRhetoric is motivated by the claim that, while \nRhet. I & II dealt with thought (dianoia), i.e., about \nwhat the orator should say, it remains to inquire into the \nvarious ways of saying or formulating one and the same thing. In the \ncourse of Rhet. III.1–12 it turns out that Aristotle \ntackles this task by using some quite heterogeneous approaches. After\nan initial exploration of the field of delivery and style (III.1) \nAristotle tries to determine what good prose style consists in; for \nthis purpose he has to go into the differentiation and the selection \nof various kinds of nouns, one of which is defined as metaphor \n(III.2). The following chapters III.3–6 feature topics that are\nat best loosely connected with the theme of good prose style; among \nthese topics is the opposite of good style, namely frigid or \ndeterring style (psuchron) (III.3), the simile, which turns \nout to be connected with the metaphor (III.4), the issue of correct \nGreek (III.5), the appropriateness (III.7) and the means by which \none's style becomes long-winded and dignified (III.6). Chapters \nIII.8–9 introduce two new approaches to the issue of style, \nwhich seem to be unrelated to everything that has been said so far: \nThese are the topics of the rhythmical shaping of prose style and of \nperiodic and non-periodic flow of speech. Chapters III.10–11 \nare dedicated to how the orator can ‘bring things before one's \neyes’, which amounts to something like making the style more \nvivid. Again metaphors are shown to play a crucial role for that \npurpose, so that the topic of metaphor is taken up again and deepened\nby extended lists of examples. Chapter III.12 seems to make a new \nstart by distinguishing between oral and written style and assessing \ntheir suitability for the three genres of speech (see above \n §2).\n The philosophical core of Aristotle's treatise on style in Rhet. \nIII.1–12 seems to be included in the discussion of the \ngood prose style (see below \n §8.1),\n however it is the topic of metaphor (see below \n §8.2)\n that has attracted the most attention in the later reception up to \nthe present day. \n\nOriginally the discussion of style belongs to the art of poetry \nrather than to rhetoric; the poets were the first, as Aristotle \nobserves, to give an impulse for the study of style. Nevertheless he \nadmits that questions of style or, more precisely, of different ways \nto formulate the same subject, may have an impact on the degree of \nclarity: “What concerns the topic of lexis, however, has some \nsmall necessary place in all teaching; for to speak in one way rather\nthan another makes some difference in regard to clarity; although not\na great difference…” (Rhet. III.1, \n1404a8–10). Clarity again matters for comprehension and \ncomprehensibility contributes to persuasiveness. Indeed Aristotle \neven claims that the virtue or excellence (aretê) of \nprose style ultimately depends on clarity, because it is the genuine \npurpose of a speech is to make something clear. In prose speeches, \nthe good formulation of a state of affairs must therefore be a clear \none. However, saying this is not yet enough to account for the best \nor excellent prose style, since clear linguistic expressions tend to \nbe banal or flat, while good style should avoid such banality. If the\nlanguage becomes too banal it will not be able to attract the \nattention of the audience. The orator can avoid this tendency of \nbanality by the use of dignified or elevated expressions and in \ngeneral by all formulations that deviate from common usage. On the \none hand, uncommon vocabulary has the advantage of evoking the \ncuriosity of an audience. On the other hand the use of such elevated \nvocabulary bears a serious risk: Whenever the orator makes excessive \nuse of it, the speech might become unclear, thus failing to meet the \ndefault requirement of prose speech, namely clarity. Moreover, if the\nvocabulary becomes too sublime or dignified in relation to prose's \nsubject matter (Aristotle assumes it is mostly everyday affairs), the\naudience will notice that the orator uses his words with a certain \nintention and will become suspicious about the orator and his \nintentions. Hitting upon the right wording is therefore a matter of \nbeing clear, but not too banal; In trying not to be too banal, one \nmust use uncommon, dignified words and phrases, but one must be \ncareful not to use them excessively or inappropriately in relation to\nprose style and the typical subject matter of prose speeches.  \n\nBringing all these considerations together Aristotle defines the good\nprose style, i.e. the virtue of prose style, as follows: “Let \nthe virtue of linguistic form be defined as being clear, for since \nthe logos is a (linguistic, sc.) sign, it would fail to bring about \nits proper function, whenever it does not make clear (whatever it is \nthe sign of, sc.)—and neither banal/mean/flat \n(tapeinên) nor above the deserved dignity, but \nappropriate (prepon).” (Rhet. III.2, \n1404b1–4; similar at III.12, 1414a22–26) According to \nthis definition, the virtue of prose style has to avoid two opposed \ntendencies, both of which are excessive and therefore fallacious: The\ngood style is clear in a way that is neither too banal nor too \ndignified, but appropriate (in proportion to the subject matter of \nprose speech). In this respect the definition of stylistic virtue \nfollows the same scheme as the definition of ethical virtues in \nAristotle's ethical writings, insofar as both the stylistic virtue \nand the virtue of character are defined in terms of a mean that lies \nbetween two opposed excesses. If the virtue of style is defined as a \nmean between the banality involving form of clarity and overly \ndignified (and hence inappropriate) speech, it is with good reason \nthat Aristotle speaks of only one virtue of prose style, and not of \nclarity, ornament (by dignified expressions) and appropriateness as \nthree distinct virtues of style. However, from the times of Cicero \nand Quintilianus on, these three, along with the correctness of Greek\nor Latin, became the canonical four virtues of speech (virtutes \ndicendi). Reading Aristotle through the spectacles of the Roman \nart of rhetoric, scholars often try to identify two, three or four \nvirtues of style in his Rhetoric. \n\nFinally, if the virtue of style is about finding a balance between \nbanal clarity, which is dull, and attractive dignity, which is \ninappropriate in public speeches, how can the orator manage to \ncontrol the different degrees of clarity and dignity? For this \npurpose Aristotle equips the orator with a classification of words \n(more or less the same classification can also be found in \nPoetics chapter 21): First of all Aristotle distinguishes \nbetween the kuria onamata, the standard expressions, and the\nglôtta, the borrowed words, idioms or vernacular \nexpressions. Most examples that Aristotle gives of this latter class \nare taken from the different Greek dialects, and most examples of \nthis type are in turn taken from the language of the Homeric epos. \nFurther classes are defined by metaphors and by several expressions \nthat are somehow altered or modified, e.g., newly coined expressions \n(pepoiêmena), composite expressions (especially new or\nunusual compositions (ta dipla)), and lengthened, shortened \nor otherwise altered expressions. Sometimes Aristotle also uses the \nterm kosmos under which he collects all epithets and \notherwise ornamental expressions. These different types of words \ndiffer in accordance with their familiarity. Most familiar are the \nusual or current words, the least familiar words are the \nglôtta or words that are newly coined. The metaphors \nare also unknown and unusual, because a usual, well-known word is \nused to designate something other than its usual designation (see \nbelow \n §8.2).\n The best established words, the kuria, make their subject \nclear, but do not excite the audience's curiosity, whereas all other \ntypes of words are not established, and hence have the sort of \nattraction that alien or foreign things used to have. Since remote \nthings are admirable (thaumaston) and the admirable is \npleasant, Aristotle says, one should make the speech admirable and \npleasant by the use of such unfamiliar words. However one has to be \ncareful not to use inappropriately dignified or poetic words in prose\nspeech. Thus the virtue of style is accomplished by the selection and\nbalanced use of these various types of words: Fundamental for prose \nspeech is the use of usual and therefore clear words. In order to \nmake the speech pleasant and dignified and in order to avoid banality\nthe orator must make moderate use of non-familiar elements. Metaphor \nplays an important role for prose style, since metaphors contribute, \nas Aristotle says, clarity as well as the unfamiliar, surprising \neffect that avoids banality and tediousness.  \n\nAccording to Aristotle Poetics 21, 1457b9–16 and \n20–22, a metaphor is “the application of an alien name by\ntransference either from genus to species, or from species to genus, \nor from species to species, or by analogy, that is, \nproportion”. These four types are exemplified as follows:  \n\nMost of the examples Aristotle offers for types (i) to (iii) would \nnot be regarded as metaphors in the modern sense; rather they would \nfall under the headings of metonomy or synecdoche. The examples \noffered for type (iv) are more like modern metaphors. Aristotle \nhimself regards the metaphors of group (iv), which are built from \nanalogy, as the most important type of enthymemes. An analogy is \ngiven if the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. \nCorrespondingly, an analogous metaphor uses the fourth term for the \nsecond or the second for the fourth. This principle can be \nillustrated by the following Aristotelian examples: \n\nExamples (a) and (b) obey the optional instruction that metaphors can\nbe qualified by adding the term to which the proper word is relative \n(cp. “the shield of Ares,” “the evening \nof life”). In example (c), there is no proper name for\nthe thing that the metaphor refers to. In example (d) the relation of\nanalogy is not, as in the other cases, indicated by the domain to \nwhich an item is referred to, but by a certain negation (for example \n“without name”); the negations make clear that the term \nis not used in its usual sense. \n\nMetaphors are closely related to similes; but as opposed to the later\ntradition, Aristotle does not define the metaphor as an abbreviated \nsimile, but, the other way around, the simile as a metaphor. The \nsimile differs from the metaphor in the form of expression: while in \nthe metaphor something is identified or substituted, the simile \ncompares two things with each other, using words as \n“like,” “as”, etc. For example, “He \nrushed as a lion” is, according to Aristotle, a simile, but \n“The lion rushed” is a metaphor. \n\nWhile in the later tradition the use of metaphors has been seen as a \nmatter of mere decoration, which has to delight the hearer, Aristotle\nstresses the cognitive function of metaphors. Metaphors, he says, \nbring about learning (Rhet. III.10, 1410b14f.). In order to \nunderstand a metaphor, the hearer has to find something common \nbetween the metaphor and the thing the metaphor refers to. For \nexample, if someone calls the old age “stubble”, we have \nto find a common genus to which old age and stubble belong; we do not\ngrasp the very sense of the metaphor until we find that both, old age\nand stubble, have lost their bloom. Thus, a metaphor not only refers \nto a thing, but simultaneously describes the thing in a certain \nrespect. This is why Aristotle says that the metaphor brings about \nlearning: as soon as we understand why someone uses the metaphor \n“stubble” to refer to old age, we have learned at least \none characteristic of old age.","contact.mail":"Ch.Rapp@lmu.de","contact.domain":"lmu.de"}]
