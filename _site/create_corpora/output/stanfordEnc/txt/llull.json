He is currently recognized as the\nauthor of Ars Magna, a combining logical system to discover\nthe truth, conceived as an instrument to be used in interfaith\ndialogue to convert infidels. In the Ars Llull’s\ntheological, metaphysical, and logical conceptions are amply\nillustrated, and they were developed throughout his more than 200\nwritten works in Catalan, Arabic, and Latin. He is known for being\namong the first authors to use his vernacular language, Catalan, to\ncommunicate his thought.\n\nRamon Llull (also called Raymond Lully or Raymond Lull; in Latin,\nRaimundus or Raymundus Lullus or Lullius) lead an exceptional and\nextraordinarily fruitful life, unusually long for a medieval man,\nfilled with adventures and guided by his philosophical, religious, and\npolitical convictions, which invariably permeated his work. He was\nborn in Majorca in 1232, possibly in 1233. His parents, Ramon Amat\nLlull and Isabel d’Erill, were members of a bourgeois\nmiddle-class family in Barcelona. In 1229 they encouraged and\nfinanced, alongside other Catalan merchants, the efforts of King James\nI of Aragon to conquer the island of Majorca, at that time under\nMuslim dominion, in exchange for land and privileges. Following the\ntriumph over the Moors, they received lands and moved to the island.\nRamon, their only son, was born there only a few years later. \nVery little is known about his early life. The main source regarding\nLlull’s life, the anonymous De vita coaetanea, is a\ntext written in 1311 by a friend of his in Paris. Apparently based on\nhis memories, it states that Llull was a seneschal and major of the\npalace of King James II during his youth. However, contemporary\nstudies by Dominguez Reboiras and Gayá (2008) have established\nthat the “Llulls of Majorca never held nor were they awarded the\nsocial status of nobles” (2008: 21). Ramon Llull must have\nactually spent the early years of his life as a young bourgeois,\nhaving a basic education to meet his needs and dedicating himself to\nfamily business. In 1257 he married Blanca Picany, who belonged to\nanother Catalan family settled in Majorca, with whom he had two\nchildren, Domènec and Magdalena. \nThe process through which Ramon Llull was converted to Christianity is\nnarrated in De vita coaetanea I-4: Llull was writing “a\nsong to a lady whom he loved with a foolish love” (and was not\nhis wife) when he saw an apparition of Christ on the Cross. This\nvision would not be enough for him to fully understand and embrace the\ncalling. Thus, it would be repeated another four times while he\ncontinued to attempt to write the aforementioned love song. Finally,\nthe voice of \nhis conscience told him that they (the apparitions) could only mean\nthat he should abandon the world at once and from then on dedicate\nhimself totally to the service of our Lord Jesus Christ. (De\nVita I–4. Translation Anthony Bonner) \nThe call to faith was accompanied by a decision to dedicate his life\nto the service of God. That moment is recalled in De vita\ncoaetanea, where he reflected on the way in\nwhich he could serve God and conceived an action plan that outlined\nthree main objectives: in converting unbelievers to Christ, in writing\nbooks against the errors of the infidels, and in funding monasteries\nin which the different languages necessary for this mission could be\ntaught. \nThe project demonstrates a novel conviction that the\nrational dialogue between religions is, as Mayer (2010, 53) pointed\nout, “the way to establish a single faith and a sigle universal\nreligious law based on overcoming the differences between the three\nmonotheist religions: Chrstianity, Judaism and Islam”. But the\nproject that Ramon Llull resolved to undertake entailed a greater\ndifficulty that he himself acknowledged: he had none of the knowledge\nnecessary for such an undertaking. Consequently, a fundamental part of\nhis project would be his education in two cultures and languages he\ndid not thoroughly know: Latin and Arabic. \nThe apparitions and the reflection on his mission are nothing but the\nbeginning of the process of conversion. For three months, according to\nDe vita coaetanea, Llull did not undertake any of his\nprojects. \nOn Saint Francis’ feast day, observed on October 4, he listened\nto the bishop as he described the conversion of Saint Francis of\nAssisi. Impressed by the example set by the saint, Llull decided to\nsell most of his material possessions, just keeping the bare minimum\nfor the support of his wife and children, and set out on a\npilgrimage. \nIf they ever occurred, the episodes of the apparitions must have taken\nplace between 1263 and 1265, but no testimonies have been found to\nsupport this claim. On the other hand, there are documents that show\nthat Llull kept his family life at least another decade, which\ncoincides with the period spent on his formation. However, this\nprocess separated him from his family. His wife Blanca would request\nthe legal administration of the family properties due to Llull’s\nincreasingly eremitic life. She was granted her request on May 13,\n1276 (Dominguez Reboiras and Gayá 2008: 43) \nLittle is known about the time following Ramon Llull’s\nconversion, in which he began a period of intense study and\nmeditation. According to De vita coaetanea, after his\npilgrimage, he had decided to travel to Paris to study. Nevertheless,\nhis intentions were not supported either by friends or by relatives\nand he stayed in Majorca. \nThe object and means of his studies have been a topic of discussion.\nFor Johnston (1996) it is possible that he studied Latin with private\ntutors, and he might have attended lectures in the colleges of the\nmendicant orders established on the island. According to De vita\ncoaetanea, he learned Arabic from a Muslim slave. In any case,\nLlull does not seem to have received any formal education. \nThis process of instruction would end with a retreat to dedicate\nhimself to contemplation and study on Puig de Randa (a mountain in\nMajorca). During this spiritual experience he conceived the method and\nwork, now known as the Ars (Art), with which he\nwould fight “the errors of the infidels” (De Vita\nI-5). His retirement to Puig de Randa would end with a visit to the\nCistercian Abbey La Real, where he would write a first version of the\nArs, known as Ars compendiosa inveniendi veritatem.\nThis learning period would end with a new meditative stay on the\nmountain for four months until he received a new divine message\nthrough a strange priest who blessed him. \nBetween 1274 and 1275 Ramon Llull was summoned by Prince James II of\nMajorca to Montpellier. During this first trip to Montpellier, Llull\nwould suggest that James II found a monastery in Miramar, Majorca,\nwhose main objective would be to teach languages, particularly Arabic,\nto missionaries. The project was approved and the Crown granted the\nnecessary funds to support the monastery, where 13 Franciscan brothers\nwould reside. The foundation of the monastery was confirmed by Pope\nJohn XXI in a papal bull from October 17, 1276. \nLlull would reach Paris at the end of 1287 and would stay there until\nthe summer of 1289. In spite of the limited information about his\nvisit to Paris, it is known that he frequently visited the\nCollège de Sorbonne. He established influential friendships\nwith two prominent members of the Sorbonne: Peter of Limoges and\nThomas Le Myésier, who would become his most important\ndisciple. \nSome references made in De vita point out that his stay in\nParis would encourage Llull to revise the structure of this\nArt, in the light of the difficulties discussed during his\npublic lectures. \nLlull went back to Montpellier during the summer of 1289. He stayed\nthere until the autumn of 1290. During this stay he publicly presented\nhis comments to the Art and wrote a new, simpler version of\nthis work called Ars inventiva veritatis. When he finished\nhis work in Montpellier, Llull left for Genoa, a city that held great\nrelevance to him, both for his personal relationship with the Spinola\nfamily and the events that would later unfold. \nIn April 1289, the city of Tripoli, in Syria, was taken by the\nEgyptians, who imprisoned the Latin armies in Acre. The Crusades are\nnearing their end, and it is a delicate political moment, among\nothers, for the Genoese who had taken part in the Crusades. Even if\nthe defense of Tripoli and Acre were not important priorities for the\npapacy, Pope Nicholas IV asked the kings of Europe to support the\nCrusade, which spawned a series of initiatives to support the\nreconquest of the Holy Land. \nRamon Llull arrived in Rome under these circumstances at the end of\n1290, where he writes Liber de passagio, a text preceded by a\nletter called Quomodo terra sancta recuperari potest, in\nwhich Llull took advantage of the political situation to show the\nrelevance of his mission and his Art, linking his work for\nthe first time with the Crusade and the possibility of using military\nforce against the infidels. \nThis visit to Rome had no beneficial outcome, and in 1291 Llull was\nback in Genoa, and this time he had the firm intention of traveling to\nTunisia to continue his missionary vocation. This trip would be filled\nwith extreme difficulties, mainly due to a profound personal\ncrisis. \nThis crisis, narrated in great detail in De vita, must have\nstarted when he was preparing his trip to Tunisia in the spring of\n1292 and reached its most critical point in May 1293 during the\ncelebration of Pentecost. \nTwo significant events must have influenced his mood. Llull had turned\n60 years old, and in January 1292 King James II had decided to close\nthe monastery of Miramar. Llull had already made the necessary\narrangements for his missionary trip, but he started to consider the\npossibility of being murdered or incarcerated by the infidels. This\nsituation caused him to be filled with fear. Consequently, he did not\nembark on this trip. \nAs soon as the ship that would have have taken him to Tunisia set sail\nwithout him, Llull, filled with shame, got sick. This illness would\nlast until the feast of Pentecost, in which Llull was taken to the\nChurch of Saint Dominic. While he was at the church, he had a vision\nin which he was told that “he would be saved in this\norder” (De vita IV-20). Consequently, Llull resolved to\njoin the Dominican Order at that exact moment but was unable to\nbecause the prior was not present at the church. Finally, after a\ncareful process of deliberation and new visions, and considering that\nhis Art had been favorably received by the Franciscan Order,\nLlull decided to join the Franciscans. However, Dominguez\nRéboras (2016) suggests that there is no historical evidence\nthat Llull entered the order of Saint Fracisco.  \nWith new found enthusiasm, even though he was still ill and feverish,\nhe embarked on the first available ship to Tunisia, but he was\npromptly stopped by his friends. A few days later, fully recovered, he\nboarded a new ship and and set sail. Around September 1293 he arrived\nin Tunisia and started his mission. His plan was to establish contact\nand prompt dialogue with the intellectual circles in the city, using\nthe method proposed in his Art to convince them of the error\nof their ways. The endeavor did not last long, and he was\nincarcerated. He was expelled from the city and sent to Naples in\nOctober 1293. \nRamon Llull left Naples when Pope Celestine V was elected in July\n1294, and he traveled to Rome. This was an extraordinary period for\nhis work. During the two years he would spend in Rome he wrote diverse\ntexts about his Art. However, the two most important works in\nthis period were Desconhort, a poem in which he reflected on\nhis life, his plans, his failures, and his hopes; and Arbor\nScientiae, an encyclopedia in which he classified knowledge,\nwhich would be very appreciated during the Renaissance. \nAfter his stay in Rome, Llull went to Paris, where he would live from\nAugust 1298 until July 1299. He wrote 17 texts addressed to the\nscholars in the arts and theologians, which showed his involvement in\nthe academic and political discussions of the University. After this\nprolific period, he returns to Majorca but new events will make travel\nhim again. \nThe invasion of Syria by the Mongolian armies lead by Ghazan Khan in\n1299 and his subsequent advance on the Holy Land raised new hopes\namong the Crusaders. Filled with enthusiasm by this news, Llull\ndecided to travel to Cyprus during the summer of 1301. On his arrival\nhe found out that, a year before, the Mongols had retired once again.\nHis disappointment would not stop him, and he convinced the King of\nCyprus to help him convert the Muslim, Nestorian, and Jacobite\npopulation of the island. His sermons met with little success, and in\n1302 he traveled to Port Ayas, in Armenia, where he made another\nattempt to preach to the infidels. \nRamon Llull went back to Genoa in May 1303. He would spend the\nfollowing years between Genoa and Montpellier, and he would write more\nthan 18 texts, the majority of which would be directed towards the\napplication of his Art to various disciplines and topics. \nAfter this relatively quiet period, Llull set out on a new trip to\nAfrica. This time he went to Libya, on his way to Béjaïa.\nDe vita narrates this trip in detail. Llull spent most of the\ntime in prison. Instead of seeking to meet intellectuals, as he did on\nhis first trip to Tunisia, right after disembarkation, he went to the\nmain square and harangued passersby and anyone present at the time.\nThe crowd was infuriated, and Llull was placed under arrest. The\nauthorities questioned and imprisoned him. He would stay there for six\nmonths, receiving visits from sages who sought to convert him to\nIslam. He was later expelled from the city, but his hardships would\nnot end there. His ship sank on the trip back to Genoa, but Llull and\nanother passenger managed to survive by reaching the coast. He would\nthen remain in Pisa, where he would finish texts he had previously\nbegan writing, such as Ars generalis ultima. \nRamon Llull traveled again to Paris on November 1309. This was a\ndifferent visit, not only due to the increasing acceptance of Llullian\nthought at the University, but also for his involvement in political\nactivities. Clear proof of this situation was the letter of approval\nsigned by professors in the Faculties of Medicine and Theology after\nhearing a lecture on his Art on February 1310. In addition,\nLlull met King Philip IV and was awarded a letter of recommendation by\nthe King. The following year, the chancellor of the University of\nParis certified Llullian doctrine to be “in accordance to the\nCatholic faith”. (Dominguez Reboiras and Gayá 2008:\n108) \nWhen Pope Clement V summoned a General Council in Vienna during the\nsummer of 1311, Llull sent a series of requests that defined his\nreligious and political program. Some of the petitions included were\nthe foundation of language schools, the unification of the military\norders, funds for a new Crusade, questions regarding the clothing of\nthe priests, the eradication of Averroism, and a program to preach\nCatholic faith in synagogues and mosques. Some of these petitions were\nalready part of the topics to be discussed and were addressed during\nthe Council. The most important of his requests was the decision to\nfound and promote Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldean language schools, which\nwas one of the main objectives of the Llullian project. Regarding the\nunification of the military orders, the Council seemed to acknowledge\nLlull’s proposal and used it to discuss the fate of the\nTemplars, a Christian military order which would be formally dissolved\nafter the Council. \nBy 1313 relations between Tunisia and Sicily had radically changed.\nFrederick III, King of Sicily, signed a treaty with Tunisia to stop\npiracy. Taking advantage of this treaty, he undertook a project to\npromote catechesis, naturally joined by Ramon Llull. He traveled to\nSicily during the summer of 1313. Shortly afterwards, he traveled to\nTunisia, with the approval of Frederick III and the support of James\nII of Aragon, who translated some of Llull’s work from Catalan\nto Latin. After this last trip to African lands, Llull went back to\nMajorca. He passed away in this island, at the age of 84, after March\n1316. \nRamon Llull’s philosophy is not easily situated in the context\nof the 13th century. Some authors such as Libera (1991:\n135), conceptualize it as part of a movement whose main objective was\nto “unprofessionalize”\n(dèprofessionnalisation) philosophy. While Johnston\n(1996) emphasizes the vernacular character of Llull’s thought,\naimed at promoting popular instruction and not only debates in\nuniversities, Pereira (2012) highlights that the originality of his\nthought lies not in the use of the vernacular, but rather in the way\nin which he presents previously disseminated ideas as newly founded,\nwhat ultimately granted the recognition from his peers. In recent\nyears it has been emphasized that Llull is a lay thinker (Dominguez\n2016: 408) who is part of a wide movement of lay people engaged in\nfaith, such as the Beguins (Ensenyat 2017:37) with whom he has\nimportant similarities regarding how to live according to faith. \nHowever, the general consensus is that his philosophy is separated\nfrom the novelties proposed by scholasticism and Aristotelianism. His\nthought is based on the widely spread ideas of philosophers such as\nSaint Augustine, Dionysius the Areopagite, Saint Anselm, Hugh of Saint\nVictor, and Saint Bonaventure. \nBut the main feature of Llull’s philosophy is its unifying\ncharacter. It suggests that philosophy, theology, and mysticism are\nnot separate or contradictory sources of truth. Rather, they are\ndifferent aspects of the same process of knowledge. He believes also\nin the unity of Christianity. A unit threatened by the infidels and\nthe schism. His entire philosophical program, says Trias Mercant\n(1989), is aimed at turning the infidels of the truth of faith and\nunifying Christians into a dogmatically coherent and morally virtuous\ncommunity.   \nWith this purpose in mind, Llull aims to conceive a universal model to\nunderstand reality. As Bordoy (2012) points out, on the one hand, this\nmodel would allow us to know God in his existence and action, and on\nthe other hand, it would acknowledge the rest of creation as generated\nby the divinity. These ideas would allow the writing of the\nArs, a book that would serve as a method to reach truth for\nany Jewish, Catholic, or Muslim scholar. Its ultimate purpose, as\nRubio (2008a) argues, would be to convert infidels through the\nnecessary reasons stated throughout the text and for Christians, as\nTrias Mercant (1989) points out, to know and practice the principles\nof faith.  \nFor Ramon Llull, God necessarily exists, and he is the beginning of\nall existing things. However, under the influence of the negative\ntheology proposed by Dionysius the Areopagite, Llull considers God to\nbe incomprehensible due to the limitations of human nature to\nunderstand Him. This inability establishes an initial difficulty with\ngeneral knowledge, for there would be no means to access the ultimate\nsource of existence, truth, and knowledge, according to Llull’s\nideas. \nThe means by which this difficulty is solved, according to Llull, is\nto recognize the cognitive value of the predicates that describe the\npositive qualities of the things created by God as a reflection of the\ndivine qualities, thus serving as a way to know God by his\nattributes. \nWhen we talk about the goodness or the greatness of something, we\nexpress a quality in things that, for Llull, corresponds to a divine\nattribute as well. These attributes are called Dignities, although\nthey are sometimes referred to as “reasons” or\n“virtues”. Llull defines “Dignity” in\nGayá’s (2008: 466) words as “God’s\nperfection, or attributes that in God, and only in God, reach their\nmost perfect realization”. \nDignities are varied in number throughout Llull’s work. Among\nthem we find infinity (infinitas), eternity\n(aeternitas), unity (unitas), wisdom\n(sapientia), which are common to the Christian tradition, as\nwell as others such as magnitude (magnitudo), virtue\n(virtus), mercy (misericordia), or simplicity\n(simplicitas), which correspond to attributes that we\nrecognize in ourselves (quoad nos) or in relation to other\ncreatures. These attributes are, according to Mayer (2016), the means\nthrough which men can perceive the work of God in creation so that\nthey can then project it onto divinity. \nThese “Dignities” designate divine properties and are,\nthus, the starting point for Llull’s thought, and at the same\ntime, his ultimate object of reflection. We find them enunciated in\nthe different versions of the Ars in\n “Figure A”. \nGoodness is that whereby good does good. \nThat is how Ramon Llull defines the first principle in his Ars\nbrevis 3–1. The principles are axioms that Ramon Llull will\nformulate based on the Dignities. He defines them as principles of\nexistence and action (principia existendi et agendi). As\nprinciples of existence, they are abstract and allude to the\nDignities. As principles of action, they are used to apply the\nArs to the knowledge of particular sciences, such as law,\nnavigation, and astrology, among others. The principles can be\nabsolute, if they are taken by themselves, or relative, if they are\napplied to a particular subject (e.g., Peter is great). Llull explains\nin Ars Brevis this quality of the principles as \na ladder for ascending and descending; as, for instance, descending\nfrom a completely general principle to one neither completely general\nnor completely particular, and from a principle neither completely\ngeneral nor completely particular to one that is completely\nparticular. (Ars Brevis 2-I. Translation Yanis Dambergs) \nDuring his process of formation, Ramon Llull develops a metaphysics of\nsimilarity, under the probable influence of Saint Bonaventure. This\nmetaphysics dominates his first texts and his first versions of the\nArs. It is based on the idea that creation has a\nrepresentative function: it is a mirror (Mayer 2016) or a net of\n“traces” (Rubio 2008b: 325) in which divine perfection is\nreflected. \nIn Llull’s metaphysics, the existence of things is explained\nbased on the “similarity” that their nature shares with\nother beings, and the way in which this resemblance\n“participates” in the nature of other superior beings like\nPrinciples or Dignities. The “similarity” expresses a\nrelationship of correspondence among beings, which is also designated\n“signification” by Llull, as it is a relationship by which\nGod is manifest in creation. “In the perfection of the created\ngoodness”—wrote Llull in Libre dels proverbis de\nRamon LXXXI—“the perfection of the uncreated goodness\nis signified”. \nSignification does not only describe the relationship between creation\nand divinity. In addition, it describes the relationship among the\ndifferent degrees of existence. Llull shares the theory—commonly\nused in Christian, Jewish, and Arab cultures—of a ladder of\nbeings. It is organized based on the existence of an order—a\nstructure that organizes things according to a purpose—which\nresults in a hierarchy defined by similarity or difference in each\ndegree of being ascending or descending in the ladder. In\nLlull’s metaphysics, these degrees are as follows: (1)\nElementative, which corresponds to the four elements; (2) Vegetative,\nwhich encompasses beings capable of nutrition, growth, and\nreproduction; (3) Sensitive, which includes beings who are able to\nhave sensory perception; (4) Imaginative, which includes beings who\nare capable of internally reproducing what they have perceived; (5)\nMan, as a rational being, and at the same time, participant of both\nthe spiritual and the material field; (6) Heaven, which includes the\ncelestial spheres; (7) Angels, pure spirits without a body; and\nfinally (8) God, the highest step of the ladder. \nAll beings, except God, are dependent, for the ultimate signification\nof creation is given by the divinity, who expresses itself through\ncreation. An important feature of this organization of creation is\nthat, according to Llull, regardless of the step in the ladder in\nwhich a being is found, it is possible to ascend or descend through it\ndue to the similarity that interconnects all the steps. This network\nof significations given by the similarities—as shown in the case\nof the principles—shows a ladder of knowledge through which both\nascent and descent are possible, through sensory data to the\nintellectual understanding of spiritual reality, and inversely. \nOne of the innovations introduced by Llull in the ladder of beings is\nthe category he calls instrumentality or artifice, which is introduced\nafter he begins the reformulation of the Ars in 1290. It\nencompasses instrumental or artificial beings, which are a result of\nthe instrumental or artificial power or faculty of man. Within the\nladder, they would be found below the Elementative step. \nOne of the most original aspects of Llull’s philosophy is the\ntheory of the correlatives, which does not follow the analogic logic\nfound in the first formulations of the Ars, but a logic whose\nfoundations are the ontological principles that explain the\nconcatenation between beings based on their own nature. \nAccording to the theory of the correlatives, the nature of a being is\nsomething defined by its activity. Therefore, being and activity are\ninseparable and identified (esse and agere).\nConsequently, according to the theory of the correlatives, the nature\nof a being is defined based on (a) its activity, that which makes it\nactive and allows it to execute different intrinsic and extrinsic\nactions; (b) its passion, that which affects the being either\nintrinsically by itself or extrinsically by another; and (c) its\naction, that which makes it being in act and being in constant\nmovement. This structure, which will receive diverse formulations\nthroughout his work, namely matter/form/conjunction,\nbeginning/middle/end, or doer/done/means (Gayá 2008; Bonner\n2007), is presented in the book Liber de ascensu et descensu\nintellectus as follows: every being has a natural virtue, which\ncan be “active”, “passive”, and\n“connective”. These virtues are the correlatives that\nLlull linguistically distinguishes using suffixes. For the active\nnature he uses -tivus (e.g., bonificativus), for the passive,\n-bilis (bonificabilis), and for the connective, -are\n(bonificare). \nThe nature of each being is constituted, intrinsically, by its\ncorrelatives, which are, for example, in the case of man,\n“homificativus”,\n“homificabilis”, and\n“homificare”. Through the actions carried out by\nthese correlatives, man must actualize the potentiality of his act.\nHowever, as every being is formed by certain faculties, the activity,\nthe passivity, and the connectivity of man’s nature must be\nexercised through each one of these faculties. Thus, to see, he will\nuse the vision formed by its correlatives (which will be explained in\nthe following sections), and so on. When he uses each one of these\ncorrelatives, he must apply the dynamism of the correlatives of the\nprinciples such as “bonitas” or\n“magnitudo”, by which he is also constituted, to\nreflect the divinity of the dignities in his action. \nThe correlatives form, therefore, a complex structure that is\nreproduced throughout the ladder and in each one of the beings, from\nGod to a stone, to ontologically explain the continuity among all\nbeings. In each one of them, the chain of the whole of creation is\nreproduced. \nThe correlatives are also distinguished in God because, for Llull,\nactivity is needed for nature, and there could only be divine nature\nif it has an activity. Llull identifies the divine correlatives in\ntheir intrinsic action through the Trinity, namely the Father, the\nSon, and the Holy Spirit, while their extrinsic action, through the\nDignities, will result in creation. \nIn this definition of man in the Ars Brevis 9-IV, Ramon Llull\nidentifies human nature with its activity, with its dynamic principle\nas López Alcaide (2016) explains. Homificans is\nproduced through the realization of the three main activities of the\nhuman soul, which for Llull are knowing, remembering, and loving,\nwhich correspond to the three superior faculties of the soul:\nunderstanding, memory, and will. \nIn Liber de homine, Llull acknowledges that man must know\nwhat man is, and as he is able to know himself, he will be able to\nknow other men and, naturally, God as well. However, the knowledge\nthat man can reach is different from the rest of the beings. Animals,\nfor example, can only know through senses and imagination, whereas\nangels can only intellectually know through themselves. As man is\nconstituted by a soul and a body, he can know through the senses but\nis not limited by them. He is capable of going up the ladder and\nunderstanding other beings through the principles; additionally, he\ncan also go down the ladder and understand the principles through\nbeings. \nThe ascent and descent describe the two paths the soul can traverse to\nobtain knowledge of the world. They are different but supplementary\nways. The ascent starts with corporeal objects, whose sensible species\n(form or similarity) are captured by the external senses and\ntransformed into internal species by the imagination; then, the higher\nfaculties of the soul in the intellect transform them into knowledge\nof exterior beings. The descent is the opposite path, from the\nuniversal to the particular. It takes the principles as starting\npoints through which the human soul can recognize these\nprinciples—goodness, truth, etc.—in particular beings. \nLlull explains how the senses function perceptually and cognitively\nbased on the theory of the correlatives. Each one of the five\ntraditional senses has its three correlatives. Following the example\nproposed by Romano and de la Cruz (2008: 380), the eye functions\nintrinsically according to “Visituus”,\n“Visibilis”, and “Videre”,\nwhereas “Visibilitas” is found in objects, that\nis, its visible species. Since the act of seeing is similar to the act\nof being seen, they are connected in such a way that the extrinsically\nvisible species can be perceived and transformed in the intrinsically\nvisible species through the activity of the mind, by the imagination,\nwhich is the faculty that completes the process of abstraction. \nLlull presents an original contribution he designates as\nAffatus, which operates in the same way as the five\ntraditional senses. The Affatus is defined as the\npotentiality by which an animal manifests its conceptions through its\nvoice to another animal. This is the means, as he writes in the\nLibre dels proverbis de Ramon CCLXII, through which man\ncommunicates with the rational soul more than with any other sense, by\nwhich the soul produces sound, and, in the case of man, communicates\nscience. It is the image of understanding, it allows communication\nwith God, and it is how the mechanical arts are expressed. \nAll the senses have the same purpose as the affatus: to\nrealize the activity of man, the homificans, through the\nconnection of the internal and external species in order to enable man\nto know, remember, love, and live. Consequently, the senses are\nnecessary for living, but particularly the lowest kind, such as touch,\ntaste, and smell, are especially important for distinguishing pleasure\nfrom pain. The superior senses, such as hearing, sight, and\naffatus, not only allow man to live, but they also activate\nhis highest faculties and they bring man closer to God. Hearing is\nnecessary to know and remember, especially God’s name; sight, to\nunderstand, remember, and love, particularly God; and\naffatus, to communicate knowledge and to talk to God. \nTaken as a whole, the process of knowledge in Llull includes several\nsteps that, even if they have a sequence of ascent and descent, form a\ncircle which can be traversed in both directions. This process would\nbegin, as was previously stated, with self-knowledge. Initially man\nwould use his intellect to understand his own dynamism (Petit 2004),\nand in that process he will find the principles whose\nsimilarities—goodness, greatness, etc.—he will look for in\nthe sensible things as he descends. \nFrom this descending move, an ascending one will follow, through which\nthe intrinsic species are deduced from the extrinsic\nspecies. The process would end in a final intellectual move that\nLópez Alcaide (2015) describes as horizontal, in which the\nintellect, by considering the goodness of the senses, will consider\nthe goodness of the intellect itself, thus reaching goodness in\nitself. \nThrough this process of concatenating the similarities of external\nobjects with the internal principles of understanding, man realizes\nwhat the structure of creation is, as well as its order, the mutual\nparticipation and influence among beings, and among the principles and\nthe dignities. \nIn this sense, knowledge in Llull consists of perceiving and\nunderstanding the meanings revealed by the objects found in the divine\nattributes. As Petit (2004: 219) observes, according to Llull, knowing\n“is the result not only of seeing, feeling or touching, but also\ncontemplating”. \nDuring his stay in Paris between 1297 and 1299, Llull participated in\nthe discussion against Averroism, specifically against “the\ntheory of double truth”. In the context of this dispute, he\ndeveloped what is known as the doctrine of the transcendent points,\nwhich tries to solve the problem of the discontinuities in the process\nof acquiring knowledge and ultimately show that faith and knowledge do\nnot differ. \nLlull’s starting point is to identify that truth is found above\nman’s own capabilities in two senses. First, the knowledge that\nman gets from the world, through his sensitive faculties, is\ninsufficient to build an accurate truth of the world. Consequently,\nman must overcome this initial level. It is then when, according to\nLlull, happens the transcendental move that encourages man to look for\nthe objects that are characteristic of his superior faculties, that\nis, the intelligible things, allowing him to reach the knowledge that\nscience and philosophy can offer. But this knowledge is also limited\nand insufficient. Thus, he must leap forward to transcend and surpass\nhimself. His purpose will be to reach the divine objects, the\ndignities, recognizing in them, in a superlative way, what were mere\nhuman concepts before. This is proper theological knowledge. \nEven if the main function of the doctrine of the transcendent points\nis fundamentally polemical, it is associated with two central elements\nin Llull’s logic. The first one is the formulation of the\nexistence of three types of objects of knowledge, sensitive,\nintellective, and divine, which correspond to the three degrees of the\nadjective in language: positive, comparative, and superlative. In this\nway, it would be related to the three ways of logical demonstration\nthat, according to Rubio (2008a), Llull used in the Ars. The\nfirst two are the propter quid and quia proofs from\nAristotelian logic: (1) when the effect is proven by its cause (e.g.,\nWhen the sun is shining, it must be daytime); (2) when the cause is\nproven by its effect (e.g., It is daytime; therefore, the sun must be\nshining). The third demonstration is designated by Llull as\nargumentum per aequiparantiam or by equivalence, according to\nwhich the demonstration is produced when a thing is equal to another.\nFor example, God cannot sin because his power is equal to his will,\nand by his will he does not want to sin. \nThe Ars, or to be more precise, the development through\nnumerous texts of a combining logical system to reveal the truth, is\nthe most important and original product of Ramon Llull’s\nphilosophy, and the main core of his work. \nIts development is divided into two great phases. The first one is\ncalled the Quaternary Phase, for it is organized based on the model of\nthe four elements which form the base of the majority of the analogies\nused by Llull. The Quaternary Phase comprises two main texts: the\nArs compendiosa inveniendi veritatem, written by Llull\nfollowing the revelation of the Art at the Puig de Randa\nMount in 1274, and the Ars demonstrativa in 1283, in addition\nto other texts that comment or explain the Ars. The second\nphase is known as Ternary Period, for it follows the structure of a\ntrinity. It began with the criticism experienced in Paris with the\nArs inventiva veritatis (1290), followed by the modification\nof the Tabula generalis (1293–4), and it concludes with\nthe Ars generalis ultima (1305–8) and its abbreviated\nversion, which incidentally had the most comments and discussions\nduring the Renaissance, the Ars brevis of 1308. \nThe Ars was conceived by Ramon Llull as an instrument for an\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. Thus, it was to be a tool\nto aid the missionaries’ work. Giles (2020, 4) had pointed out\nLlull’s openness “to convince religious others of Christian\ntruth, not through the rhetoric of polemics or by strategically quoting\nauthorities, but through methods of discussing or debating spiritual\ndifference and acknowledging shared traditions”. \nAs a result, Llull did not structure this work based on the main\nChristian dogmas, the Trinity and the Incarnation, but on the common\nprinciples to the three religions of the book. As Rubio (2008a: 245)\nargues, “the secret of the Art consists of its demonstrating\nthat the accepted world view implies the Christian view of\nGod”. \nStudies on the Ars (Ruiz Simón 1998; Rubio 2008a;\nJaulent 2010) show that it addresses the criticism made by Llull to\nScholastic logic. This criticism has two great stages: on the one\nhand, the insufficiency of the demonstration by syllogisms—the\nbasis of all Scholastic science—to reveal new truths, because it\nonly explicitly states the relationship between known facts and\nevident principles (Ruiz Simón 1998), thus relegating\ndialectics (or ars inveniendi), which consists of finding\narguments and counterarguments based on some loci or\n“places”, to the domain of opinion. On the other hand,\nthis criticism (Jaulent 2010) addresses the fact that demonstration by\nsyllogisms only works through second intentions, that is, it describes\nrelationships within logical propositions and not according to objects\nin reality, which are conceptualized as first intentions. \nLlull’s Ars would seek to form a logic system different\nto the scholastic one, through which novel truths that describe not\nonly logical relationships, but also metaphysical relationships, can\nbe discovered. According to Ruiz Simón (1998) and Bonner\n(2007), the Ars is defined by Llull based on four adjectives:\ncompendioso and inventivo, like its first version;\ndemostrativo, as in the second one; and general, in\nthe final phase: (1) compendioso, for it is from some limited\nprinciples that an unlimited number of arguments can be found; (2)\ninventivo, because, through its combining mechanism, it makes\nit possible to find those arguments; (3) demostrativo,\nbecause it allows one to reach necessary conclusions; (4) and\ngeneral, because it encompasses both real and logical\nobjects, and it is thus applicable to any topic. \nTherefore, the Ars is a system to access any logical or\nmetaphysical truth, a means to find novel arguments, an instrument to\naccess all general and particular knowledge, a tool for the missionary\nthat seeks to refute the arguments of the infidels and a way to enact\nvirtues and suppress vices.  \nThe Ars is structured to answer questions, which are\ninvariably found in the final sections of the different versions of\nthe Ars. These answers are usually a combination of terms\nconstituted by using the elements that form the Ars: terms,\nfigures, and alphabet. \nThe terms are the basic concepts of the Ars. For example, the\nDignities, such as Goodness, Beauty, Greatness, Eternity; or the\nprinciples, such as Difference, Concordance, Contrariety, etc. \nThe figures are graphical forms of different types, such as circles,\ntables, and triangles, which form the combinations of both the\ninternal elements and their combinations with other figures. \nFinally, the alphabet is used, above all, in the Ternary Period, and\nit is formed by nine letters whose meaning is not fixed, as it is\nunderstood according to the use of the figures and their\ncombinations. \nFigure A. Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducación, Cultura y Deporte. \nThe first figure of the Ars is\n Figure A,\n composed by 16 terms that correspond to the Dignities: Goodness,\nWisdom, Glory, Simplicity, Greatness, Will, Perfection, Nobility,\nEternity, Virtue, Justice, Mercy, Power, Truth, Generosity,\nDominion. \nTwo cases should be noted in this figure: The use of the\nalphabet—the letters that surround the figure from\n“b” to “r”, whose function is to refer to the\nterms inside of the figure in a simplified way, although they are not\nfound in all the versions of the Ars—and the network of\nlines that join each term within the figure with all the remaining\nones, which are not shown in all the versions either. These lines\nillustrate the combinations found within this figure. In this case,\neach one of the 16 terms would have 15 combinations with the remaining\nterms. This combining possibility is supported by the fact that each\nDignity may be converted into another, by the principle of the unity\nof all divine attributes. Moreover, it reflects the principle of the\nargument of equivalence, which, as was already explained, is one of\nthe demonstrative forms of the Ars. \nEach one of these combinations would form a compartment, and its set,\na table with all the possible combinations (see the\n Second Figure of A). \nThe Second Figure of A. Ars\ncompendiosa inveniendi veritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031.\nDigital version Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio\nBibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y\nDeporte. \nThe second figure of the Ars is called\n Figure S,\n where the rational soul is represented, following St. Augustine, as\nformed by Memory, Intellect, and Will. The representation is, however,\nnot according to the faculties, but to their acts and their\ncombinations. \nThe acts of the faculties of the soul are found in the compartments of\n Figure S:\n the intellect, understanding and not understanding; the memory,\nremembering and forgetting; the will, loving, hating, and loving and\nhating. In addition, the compartments contain combinations of letters,\ncorresponding to the ones found in the internal circle, that refer to\nthe combined acts of the faculties. Therefore, d. h. m. refers to, for\nexample, the combined acts of the will that loves, the will that\nhates, the will that loves and hates. b. c. d. refers to the combined\nacts of the memory that remembers, the intellect that understands, the\nwill that loves. Llull groups these combinations in four species named\nE, I, N, R, which are identified by the letter of the compartment\nwhere the combination of the acts of the faculties is found, and which\nforms one of the squares drawn within the circle. Therefore, the\nspecies E identifies the combination b. c. d. The I, the combination\nf. g. h.; the N, the combination k. l. m.; and finally, the R, the\ncombination of these combinations, o. p. q. \nFigure S. Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducación, Cultura y Deporte. \nThe species not only organize certain acts of the faculties of the\nsoul. Additionally, they also represent certain conducts. Thus,\nspecies E, for example, which is formed by the intellect that\nunderstands, the memory that remembers, and the will that loves,\ncorresponds to the attitude of someone who affirms a proposition with\narguments. I, formed by the intellect that understands, the memory\nthat remembers, and the will that hates, represents the attitude of\nsomeone that denies a proposition with arguments. \nSpecies N, where intellect and memory fail to understand and remember,\nthus confirming or denying something, represents supposition, a belief\nthat is not sustained either by arguments or by reasons. \nFinally, R, formed by the combination of all the aforementioned\noptions, represents doubt. \nThe use of the letters in this case has a distinctive function. F and\nB, for example, have the same meaning: the intellect that understands,\nbut its sense varies according to the relationships found in the\nspecies E and I. Consequently, the use of this letter allows one to\nemphasize this structural sense above the meaning of the words (Bonner\n2007. \n\n Figure S\n can be combined with the rest of the figures of the Ars. As\na result, it is used to build solutions to the questions that are\nformulated in the final sections of the Ars. \n\n Figure T\n is crucial because it is used to build solutions through its\ncombination with other figures. It is formed by three circles\nconnected by triangles of different colors. The triangles connect\nthree concepts (i.e., Difference, Concordance, Contrariety), with\nthree species in each one of the edges that form the circles (i.e.,\nsensual and sensual, sensual and intellectual, intellectual and\nintellectual). \nFigure T. Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducación, Cultura y Deporte. \nFigure V is simpler and refers to the virtues and vices, including\nseven of each. In some representations, virtues are red and vices are\nblue, and both are interconnected with each other by lines. \nThe figure reflects Llull’s ethical ideas. The system is based on\nthe antithesis between virtues and vices (Rocha 2019). 28 ethical\nnotions are obtained by combining all of its elements. Together with\nthe variants in Figure T, it offers morality rich in nuances and\nalternatives, since the Art is also a method to encourage virtues and\nsuppress vices (according to Trias Mercant 1989).  \nFigure V. Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducación, Cultura y Deporte. \nFigure X, or “Figure of Opposites” or “Figure of\ncontraries and concordances”, is formed by different\noppositions: Predestination/Free Will; Being/Privation;\nPerfection/Defect; Merit/Blame; Supposition/Demonstration; etc. As in\n Figure A,\n the lines join all terms with each other. However, as Llull himself\nexplains, these connections are at times contradictory and at times in\nconcordance, for with this figure Llull represents the problem that\ncertain oppositions—namely predestination and freedom—pose\nfor man. \nFigure X. Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducación, Cultura y Deporte. \nFinally,\n Figures Y and Z\n are formed by only one concept: Truth Y and Falsehood Z. The\nArs leads to these two directions, represented by the two\nconcepts: towards the definition of the truth or falsehood of certain\npropositions. \nFigure Y and Figure Z. Ars\ncompendiosa inveniendi veritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031.\nDigital version Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio\nBibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y\nDeporte. \nOnce the figures and terms within have been defined, Llull proceeds to\nshow how they are combined. A substantial part of the several versions\nof the Ars is to show how the relationships between the\nfigures are useful to build a specific argument or to solve a certain\nmatter. Llull uses the word enter (intra) to express the way\nin which a figure is related to another, occasionally using for this\npurpose another figure, usually\n figure T.\n Thus, in the Ars compendiosa inveniendi veritatem, for\nexample, he uses figures A S T V to explain which are the species\ncontrary to the vices. Consequently, he explains that if X (the human\nsoul), with the species E I N enters T in V (figure of vices and\nsins), it is because with species E it understands (b), remembers (c),\nand loves (d) abstinence, whereas by I it understands (g), remembers\n(f), and hates (h) Gluttony. I forms patience when b c d are in\nabstinence, for it is transformed. When the soul enters N (it does not\nunderstand, does not remember, loves and hates) in A (God), Perfection\nand Justice (the compartment [Perfection, Justice]) strengthens E I\nwith a greater concordance through the red triangle (equality). \nThis example allows us to follow Llull’s construction of this\nargument, based on the combination of the different figures.\nTherefore, it is an example of a possible combination and a valid\nphilosophical proposition for Llull. If we follow the example, Llull\nuses the combination of the figures to build the argument through\nwhich it is explained how the soul transforms the negation of the\nvices into virtues, when it assumes perfection and justice in God. \nLlull does not exhaust all the possible combinations in the different\nversions of the Ars. He presents those that are relevant for\nthe construction of arguments to confront, first and foremost, the\narguments offered by the infidels, by affirming doctrinal principles\nof Christianity. Thus, the possibility remains open for the artist,\nthat is, whoever uses the Ars, to find new combinations and\nnew arguments to be applied in other contexts. \nIn Ars demostrativa (1283), Llull introduces two important\nvariations. The first is the inclusion of the\n Elemental Figure,\n which in the first version of the Ars was just a figure that\nsupported\n Figure T.\n The function of this figure, as Bonner (2007) explained, is an\nanalogical substitute of the table of oppositions to emphasize two\naspects: the proper and appropriated qualities, and their concordant\nand contrary. \nFigura Elementalis. Ars\ndemostrativa. Beati Raymundi Lulli Opera, ed. Ivo\nSalzinger i Franz Philipp Wolff, III (Magúncia: Häffner,\n1722. Digital version Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio\nBibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y\nDeporte. \nNevertheless, the introduction of the\n Demonstrative Figure\n in Ars demostrativa is particularly meaningful, for it\nsynthesizes the other figures and makes their relationship dynamic.\nThe Demonstrative Figure is formed by six circles, and it includes a\nmechanism that allows the circles to rotate. At the center, Llull\nplaces a triangle, as those found in\n Figure T.\n The first two circles correspond to the\n Elemental Figure,\n the following two, with seven letters, represent Figures A, S, T, V,\nX, Y, Z. The last two circles have the letters B–R that are the\nterms of\n Figure S,\n but Figures A, T, V, X as well, and other two figures, the Principles\nof Theology and the Principles of Philosophy, which are introduced\nwhen the operation of the Art is extended to both fields. \nDemonstrative Figure \nThe importance of the\n Demonstrative Figure\n resides in its being a step towards the universalization of the\nArs, for it initiates a process of greater abstraction of the\nprinciples. Even though the terms used in the original figures are\nkept, they, as well as the figures themselves, have been substituted\nfor letters. At the same time, it is a figure that rotates, which\nevidently shows the combining character of the Ars. Finally,\nit opens up the Ars beyond its own principles, to be used in\nother fields, such as theology, philosophy, and law. \nAfter his first visit to Paris and the criticism that ensued, in 1290\nLlull starts to make profound changes that will lead him to\nreformulate the Ars. The Ars generalis ultima,\nwritten between 1305 and 1308, and the Ars brevis, from 1308,\nestablish the most accomplished formulations of this new version of\nLlull’s tool. The changes he introduced to the Ars aim\nto simplify its structure and its function through a greater\nabstraction of its figures and a reduction of its elements. \nA general overview of these changes include the reduction of the seven\nbasic figures—A, S, T, V, X, Y, Z—in the first version, to\nonly four. Particularly remarkable is the disappearance of\n Figure S,\n an essential element in the first version, as well as that of figures\nV, X, Y and Z. In the case of V, its terms will be found in other\nsections of the text. The\n Elemental Figure\n and the\n Demonstrative Figure,\n incorporated in the Ars demostrandi, are removed as well.\nThe name of the figures is changed. Instead of using letters, they are\nnow designated First, Second, Third, and Fourth. In all of them, the\nterms shown in the first versions are substituted by letters, and the\nmeanings of these letters, in each one of the figures, are found in an\n“alphabet”. In addition, only 9 out of the 16 terms\ncontained in them remain, for the new base of the formulation of the\nArs is a ternary model, and not a quaternary one. \nThe alphabet is a central element in the ternary formulation of the\nArs. It is formed by nine letters, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K,\nthat using the figures, will be organized to form propositions and\narguments, formulate and solve questions. Each letter has six terms\nassociated with it: \nThe first of these terms refers to positive attributes that are\napplicable to all the scale of beings. The second corresponds to the\ndefinition of a relationship between entities (it is a reformulation\nof the former\n Figure T).\n The third term corresponds to the Rules and the Questions, and it\nconstitutes the most important tool for research within this model,\nfor they will be used to formulate problems and their solutions. The\nlast three terms correspond to (a) the subjects addressed by the\nArs, (b) virtues, and (c) vices. The figures will be used to\nvisually represent the relationships between the different terms in a\nsimilar way to the previous formulation of the Ars. They are\n54 principles in total, which constitute the basis of the whole system\nand whose relationships are established through the figures. \nThe\n First Figure\n is formed by a sole circle of nine elements, whose letters correspond\nto the terms of the first meaning of the alphabet. \nFirst Figure. Ars brevis XVIII\nCentury. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducación, Cultura y Deporte. \nThe\n Second Figure\n is formed by three concentric circles connected by three triangles,\nsimilarly to the way\n Figure T\n was shown in the first version of the Art. In this case, only one of\nthe triangles was lost. In the edges of the triangles the terms of the\nsecond meaning of the alphabet are found, each one of them unfolded in\nthree species. Thus, for example: the first triangle deals with\ndifference, concordance, and contrariety (B, C, D). Each one of these\nconcepts has three species: sense and sense, sense and intellect,\nintellect and intellect. The second triangle, beginning, middle, end\n(E, F, G) has different species in each one of the edges. The species\nof beginning are cause, quantity, and time. In Ars brevis\n2-II, Llull explains the following \ncause means the efficient, material, formal and final causes. Quantity\nand time signify the other predicates and whatever can be reduced to\nthem. \nBonner (2007) has argued that in this section Llull introduces the\nAristotelian causes and categories, which entails the adoption of the\nterminology and concepts of this logic into his system. The middle\nhas, at the same time, three species that will be formed by the middle\nbetween subject and predicate (e.g., Man is an animal—the\nphysical life), the middle between agent and patient (Love, in the\nrelationship between loved and lover), and the middle between extremes\n(e.g., between two points). The edges of the last minor triangle,\nminor, equal, major (H, I, K) share the same three species: accident\nand accident, substance and accident, substance and substance. \nSecond Figure. Ars brevis XVIII\nCentury. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducación, Cultura y Deporte. \nThe\n Third\n and\n Fourth\n Figure of the new formulation of the Art have a similar function. The\nthird is a square in which the binary combinations are represented,\nwhereas the fourth is a representation of the ternary combinations\ninside the Art. The latter is formed by three concentric circles, and\nLlull explains that it must be rotated to form the different\ncombinations. That is, if the starting point of an initial combination\nis BCB, the one that will follow is CCB, building the first nine\nternary combinations accordingly. The circles are, therefore, rotated\nto the next alignment, which is BDB, and the process continues. \nThird Figure. Ars brevis XVIII\nCentury. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998.

Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducación, Cultura y Deporte. \nUnlike the two first figures, whose letters refer to the terms of the\nfirst and second signification given in the alphabet, in the Third and\nFourth Figures the letters can be substituted by any of the six\nmeanings presented in the alphabet. For example, the combination BC\ncan mean “goodness is great”—the terms are taken\nfrom the first meaning of the alphabet—but it can also mean\n“difference is great”, when the first term is taken from\nthe second meaning, and the second term is taken from the first\nmeaning. Likewise, its sense can be “goodness is\nconcordant”, when the first term is taken from the first\nmeaning, and the second term is taken from the second meaning. Some\nauthors use capital letters when the first sense is used and lowercase\nletters when the second sense is used to facilitate the understanding\nand use of the Art. Thus, the given examples could be expressed as BC,\nbC, Bc. \nLlull introduces a table, originated from the\n Fourth Figure,\n in which all the combinations of this figure are found. \nTable of the Fourth Figure (fragment).\nArs brevis XVIII Century. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital\nversion Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico. Spain.\nMinisterio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte. \nIn this table, the letter T is introduced with a syntactic function to\nstate what terms are taken from the first meaning and which are taken\nfrom the second. The rule is that the letters found before letter T\nuse the first of the meanings of the alphabet, and the ones found\nafter, the second. \nBoth in Ars generalis ultima and Ars brevis, Llull\nexplains the operation of the Ars in two sections called\n“Evacuating the\n Third Figure”\n and “Multiplying the\n Fourth Figure”. \nLlull uses the term “evacuate” to illustrate how all the\nsenses of each one of the combinations are extracted, using the\nintellect as agent. The evacuation starts “by making statements,\nthen we interchange subjects with predicates, and then put\nquestions” (The Ars generalis ultima 6–1.\nTranslation Yanis Dambergs) That is, statements are formed using a\nterm from the first meaning of the alphabet (e.g., B, C: goodness is\ngreat); then another one is formed by using the first and second\nmeaning of the alphabet (e.g., b, B: difference is good), and then the\nsubject and the predicate are inverted (e.g., B, b: goodness is\ndifferent). There are 12 meanings in total for each combination of\nletters. The example for BC is: \nAfterwards, the corresponding questions to the third meaning of the\nletters according to the alphabet are introduced. In the case of B and\nC, it would be whether and what. Thus, based on the affirmations, the\nexample would be: “Goodness is great”, “Whether\ngoodness is great?”, and “What is great goodness?”\nThis process is applied to the 12 affirmations, thus obtaining a total\nof 36 possible meanings for the combination BC. This procedure must be\nfollowed with all the combinations found in the\n Third Figure. \nThe definitions and rules offered by Llull as part of the Ars\nmust be used to complete the evacuation and make sense of all 36\npossible combinations. There are 18 definitions: nine of them\ncorrespond to the first meaning of the alphabet, and the other nine,\nto the second meaning. The first five, for example, state that: \nBonner (2007) has noted that a distinctive feature of the definitions\nproposed by Llull is that they do not follow the Aristotelian model.\nOn the contrary, they define the subject based on his activity, which\nallows the application of the definition of greatness, for example, to\nany of the beings in the ladder and not exclusively to God. That is\nprecisely what he would do to complete the evacuation of the\n Third Figure,\n as will be explained later. \nThe rules correspond to the third of the meanings given to the\nalphabet. Each one of these questions has, at the same time, species\nthat will be useful to establish the type of answer that is sought or\nthe nature of the question that wishes to be formulated. For example,\nthe first, “Whether?”, has three species, namely doubt,\naffirmation, and negation. The second, “What?”, has four\nspecies: the first defines the subject, the second defines the\ncorrelatives, the third asks what a certain thing is in another thing\n(e.g., “What is the intellect in other things?”), and the\nfourth asks what a certain thing does or has in another thing (e.g.,\n“What does the intellect have in other things?”). \nTo finalize the evacuation of the\n third figure,\n the intellect has to build the meanings with these tools, following\nthe guide offered by the definitions and the rules. For example, in\nthe case of the first combination BC, “goodness is great”,\nfollowing rule C, the question is formulated as “Is goodness\ngreat?” Its evacuation would follow the application of the first\nspecies of Rule C, to define the predicate: “Greatness is a\nbeing on account of which goodness is great.” Then, the second\nspecies of Rule C, by which the subject is defined by its correlative,\nwould be: “Goodness is great because it has its essential\nbonifier, bonifiable, and bonifying”. Consequently, following\nthe fourth species in Rule C (What does goodness have in greatness?),\ngoodness would have in greatness its “natural repose”.\nFinally, the third species of Rule C (What is goodness in\ngreatness?), \nit is in difference and concordance by definition as it differentiates\nand merges its coessential correlatives within its genus and essence\nfrom which great moral goodness arises. (The Ars generalis\nultima 6–1. Translation Yanis Dambergs) \nFor the\n fourth figure,\n Llull follows a similar procedure to the one found in the\n third figure.\n First, ternary combinations can be made based on the initial\ncombination. For example, based on B C D, B C E would follow, then B C\nF, and so on. Consequently, for each triple combination of letters,\nfor example, B C D, it is possible to formulate 20 questions based on\nthe first, the second, and the third meaning of the alphabet to obtain\nthe form of a question. There are 20 questions in total for each\ncolumn in the table. For example: \nThe way to solve these questions follows the same procedure as in the\ncase of the\n third figure,\n combining definitions and rules, according to the involved letters,\ntheir meaning in the alphabet, and the species of the rules used in\neach one of them. \nIn the ternary form of the Ars, Llull extensively uses the\ncombining structure. Thus, the principles of the\nArs—the first and the second meaning of the\nalphabet—are combined among themselves and the rules to obtain\nan exhaustive relationship of all that can be affirmed from the\ncombination of the principles and the rules. This is a fundamental\ntool for the user of the Ars, for it is following this\n“mixture”, as designated by Llull, of the principles, that\nthe identification of the appropriate principle to solve the questions\nwill be easier. The same combining procedure must be applied to the\nnine subjects or beings with which Llull has formed a hierarchy of\nreality—the fourth meaning of the alphabet: God, Angel, Heaven,\nMan, imaginative, sensitive, vegetative, elementative, instrumentality\nor artifice. Each one of these must be combined with the principles\nand the rules to exhaustively obtain what can be said of each one, in\norder to answer concrete questions. This procedure is also applied to\nthe fifth and sixth meaning of the alphabet, that is, the virtues and\nvices. \nBoth Ars Generalis Ultima and Ars Brevis conclude\nwith a sequence of questions that can be formulated, and it is\nnormally illustrated how they are answered using the combining\nmechanisms of the Ars. However, these are not the only\nquestions that the Ars can answer. Llull himself explains in\nboth texts that, above all, the Ars is an instrument to solve\nproblems and develop arguments. Consequently, the majority of the\nresolved questions show the exemplary character of the use of the\nArs. In the section dedicated to the teaching of the\nArs, Llull notes two things. The first highlights the\nintention of creating an instrument to reason without appealing to\nauthority. He writes in Ars Generalis Ultima 13–2: \nSecond, he shall clearly explain the text to the students through\nreasoning, without any appeal to authority, and the students shall\nread through the text, and put any questions they have about it to the\nteacher. (Translation Yanis Dambergs) \nBut the ultimate sense of the teaching and use of the Art is\nillustrated in this recommendation in the Ars generalis\nultima 13–3: \nThe teacher shall propose questions to the students and solve them by\nproviding reasons according to the process of this art, for without\nreasoning, the artist cannot make it work. Here we should note that\nthe art has three friends, namely intellectual subtlety, skill in\nreasoning, and good intentions, for without these, no one can learn\nit.
