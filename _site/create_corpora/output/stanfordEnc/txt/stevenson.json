A. Richards and A. J. Ayer in the development of\nemotivism. Emotivism, a precursor to the metaethical expressivism\ntoday championed by Simon Blackburn (1984, 1993) and Alan Gibbard\n(1990, 2003) among others, is typically understood as a theory of\nmoral language according to which ethical terms are used much like\nexclamative and imperative sentences (‘Hooray!’, ‘Be\nkind’) to express a speaker's affective, noncognitive\npsychological states, such as approval or disapproval, rather than to\ndescribe (or in addition to describing) some action, person,\ninstitution, etc. Stevenson's emotivism, however, was more than a\ntheory of moral language.  Rather, it was but one part of a full-blown\nethical theory, grounded in moral and linguistic psychology, which was\nintended to clarify the nature and structure of a whole range of\nnormative problems common to everyday life—ethical, aesthetic,\neconomic, legal, political, etc.—as well as the methods\ntypically used to resolve them. Throughout his work, Stevenson is\nrespectful of the complexity of human experience and the power of\nsigns and sounds to move a person emotionally and\nbehaviorally. Correspondingly, he is impatient with simplistic answers\nto complex problems, the postulation of entities unverifiable by\nscientific methods (e.g., non-naturalistic moral properties), and the\nquest for exceptionless “first principles” of explanation\nand justification that can be known with certainty.\n\n In this entry, the words ‘ethics’ and\n‘morality’ and their cognates, such as\n‘ethical’ or ‘moral’, are used\ninterchangeably.\n\n\n\nC. L. Stevenson was born in 1908 in Cincinnati, Ohio. In his\nyouth, he developed a life-long passion for literature and the arts,\nespecially poetry and music, whose power to influence a person's\nemotions and actions fascinated him—a fascination that would remain at\nthe center of Stevenson's personal and professional life.\n \n\nIn 1926, Stevenson entered Yale University, earning a prize for best\nentrance examination for piano at the Yale School of Music. He\ngraduated from Yale in 1930 with a BA in English Literature, a field he\nintended to pursue upon entering Cambridge University, England later\nthat year. While at Cambridge, however, Stevenson became\nincreasingly attracted to philosophy, in large part because of\nacquaintances with I. A. Richards, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig\nWittgenstein. Each of these figures produced important, and\ndifferent, kinds of work on the nature, analysis, and use of language,\nhad strong personalities, and shared Stevenson's love for literature,\narts, and aesthetics. Stevenson earned his BA in Philosophy from\nCambridge in 1933 and entered Harvard that same year to earn his PhD in\nPhilosophy, which he received in 1935. While at Harvard,\nStevenson worked closely with Ralph Barton Perry, whose General\nTheory of Value (1926), conversant in early American pragmatism\nand early Continental phenomenology, had a lasting influence on\nStevenson's work (Sartris 1984; Warnock 1978). \n\nStevenson remained at Harvard as an instructor for three years until\n1938, during which time three early essays were published in\nMind: “The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms”\n(1937), “Ethical Judgments and Avoidability” (1938a), and\n“Persuasive Definitions” (1938b). In 1939, Stevenson\naccepted the position of Assistant Professor at Yale, where he\nremained until 1946, and during which time his landmark Ethics and\nLanguage was published in 1944.  One of the conclusions Stevenson\nreached in this book was that some ethical disputes may be rationally\nirresolvable and, thus, would be resolvable if at all only by\nnonrational methods. Apparently on these grounds, and in the\nhistorical context of World War II atrocity, Stevenson was denied\ntenure.[1] The\nUniversity of Michigan immediately offered Stevenson a position as\nAssociate Professor, which he accepted, and where he remained until\n1978.  During his thirty-one year career at Michigan, Stevenson\npublished scores of articles in ethics and aesthetics. The most\nimportant of his ethics articles are collected in Facts and\nValues (1963a), which also contains an informative retrospective\nessay (1963b) that clarifies, expands, and refines his mature ethical\ntheory.  His closely related work in aesthetics remains uncollected. \nStevenson passed away in 1979 in Bennington, Vermont, where he had\nmoved to be near family and where he had accepted a position as\nProfessor of Philosophy at Bennington College. He was survived by\nhis second wife Nora, whom he married in 1965, after the death, two\nyears earlier, of his first wife, Louise. With Louise, Stevenson\nhad three children, including acclaimed poet Anne Stevenson. \n\nFor Stevenson, a field of study is demarcated by the kinds of\nproblems into which it inquires. Biology inquires into problems\nconcerning life; history inquires into problems concerning past social\nevents and cultural developments; etc. Ethics inquires into\nethical problems, problems about what is good or bad, what ought or\nought not be done, how we ought or ought not feel about something,\netc. Ethical problems are ubiquitous. They are the\n“problems that are familiar in everyday discussions, and which range\nfrom idle bits of gossip about this or that man's character to\nprolonged and serious discussions of international politics” (1963a,\nv). Stevenson conceives of his work as having “far less to say\nabout the summum bonum of the philosophers than about the\njudgments of the ordinary man as he finishes reading the morning's\nnewspaper” (1963a, v).  Stevenson viewed normative ethics—the branch of ethics which\nseeks to resolve ethical problems in a systematic, rigorous\nway—as the most important branch of ethics (e.g., 1944, 1 and\n336). But he also viewed normative ethics as having long been an\nembarrassment owing to its practitioners' stubborn, “age old\nquest” for foundational, exceptionless moral principles that\ncould be known with certainty (1944, 336; 1961–62a,\n97–106). The quest for such principles, whether general\n(“Produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number,”\n“Treat people always as ends in themselves”) or more\nspecific (“Thou shall not lie”), was futile in Stevenson's\nview; but worse, it was injurious, because it ignored the complexity\nof moral issues and, thus, issued forth inflexible norms unsuitable\nfor resolving the complex moral problems of modern life (1944, 336;\n1961–62a, 116).  What normative ethics needed most, according to\nStevenson, was clarity about the nature of moral problems. For if the\nnature of moral problems were more transparent, so too might be more\neffective means of resolving them—that is, more effective\n“methodology.” In particular, the role, if any, of\nscientific methods in resolving moral problems would be more\ntransparent. \nThe nature of moral problems, according to Stevenson, lies in the\nsubjective experiences of those engaged in interpersonal moral\ndisagreement and intrapersonal moral uncertainty. He viewed this\narea of moral psychology—the subjective experience of moral\ndisagreement and uncertainty—as the most underappreciated area of\nethics and the key to making progress on the important, normative\nquestions of ethics: \n[Dealing adequately with the nature of ethical problems] requires us\nto abstract from the detailed subject matter of the problems and pay\nselective attention to the aspects of them that are most likely to prod\nus into problem solving. It requires us to see these aspects not\nfrom a moral point of view (which would attend any attempt to settle\nthe problems) but rather from the point of view of an informal, common\nsense psychology. In effect, then, it asks for a generic\ndescription, given in psychological terms, of those ethical doubts and\nuncertainties, or discords and disagreements, that we often resolve by\ninquiry, deliberation, and discussion, but which on some occasions can\nlead us into an impasse, and on other occasions can induce us\ntemporarily to suspend judgment, acknowledging that we are not yet in a\nposition to come to a trustworthy conclusion. (1963b, 186–187) \nThat Stevenson intentionally develops his entire ethical theory\naround an “informal, common-sense psychology” is a point\nmissed by many commentators, who misconceive Stevenson's ethical\ntheory merely as a “development” of Ayer's comparatively\nthin emotive theory. Warnock, for example, apparently conceiving of\nStevenson's Ethics and Language simply as a development of a\ntheory of moral language, writes that “it is as if Stevenson had\nbecome over self-conscious about methodology and there is a good deal\nof reflexive commenting upon his own procedures, which add little or\nnothing to the actual ethical theory” (Warnock 1978, p. 66). But\nas we'll see below, Stevenson focuses on methodology and procedure\nprecisely because he aims to describe in some detail how language is\nand can be used to resolve interpersonal moral disagreement and\nintrapersonal moral uncertainty. \nThus, although normative questions constitute for Stevenson the most\nimportant branch of ethics, “pervading all of common-sense life, and\noccupying most of the professional attention of legislators,\neditorialists, didactic novelists, clergymen, and moral philosophers,”\nhis work focused on questions of moral psychology, judgment,\ndisagreement, uncertainty, language, and deliberation, thereby\ncontributing to the early development of that branch of ethics now\nknown as metaethics, and thus, on the “limited task of sharpening the\ntools others employ” (1944, 1).  For Stevenson, then, the study of ethics is the study of moral\nproblems. Normative ethics concerns the resolution of actual moral\nproblems, while “analytical” or “meta” ethics\nconcerns the nature or general features of those problems. Stevenson\nplausibly assumes that if we ultimately want better resolutions to\nethical problems, we should begin in metaethics by gaining clarity\nabout the general features of those problems. For as we gain clarity\nabout their general features, we gain clarity about the function of\nmoral language—about how moral problems arise and are dealt with\nin our lives as social, communicative beings—clarity about the\nmethods that are and can be used to effectively resolve those\nproblems, and clarity about whether those methods are distinct from\nthe methods of science. \n\nMoral problems can be interpersonal or personal. Problems are\ninterpersonal when there is disagreement between or among two or more\npeople and personal when an individual is uncertain. But what is the\nnature of this disagreement or uncertainty? This is the\nquestion around which Stevenson organizes all of his work in ethical\ntheory and with which he begins both Ethics and Language\n(1944) and Facts and Values (1963a). \nInterpersonal disagreement is of two broad kinds: disagreement in\nbelief and disagreement in attitude. Disagreement in belief\noccurs when two or more people have beliefs that cannot all be true and\n“neither is content to let the belief of the other remain unchallenged”\n(1948b, 1), that is, when at least one party desires, needs, or\nattempts to coordinate, or make consistent, those beliefs. If\nSmith believes that his and Jones's anniversary is in June, while Jones\nbelieves their anniversary is in July, their respective beliefs are\nincompatible, since they cannot both be true; but Smith and Jones\ndisagree in Stevenson's sense only when—because there would likely be\na practical coordination problem only when—either or both desire,\nneed, or attempt to coordinate their beliefs, perhaps because they\nwould like to celebrate their anniversary as close to their wedding\ndate as possible. Their disagreement would be resolved when Smith\nor Jones (or both) modify their beliefs in ways that make them\ncompatible (e.g., they both come to believe that their anniversary is in\nJune), or when both cease to care about coordinating their incompatible\nbeliefs, perhaps because they no longer care when they celebrate their\nanniversary. Personal uncertainty in belief occurs when an\nindividual is uncertain about what to believe about some event or\nobject yet desires or needs to settle on such a belief. For\nexample, Smith may not have any strong belief about whether Jones or\nRodriguez will be his next boss; but he would be personally uncertain,\nin Stevenson's sense, about which will be his next boss only when he\ndesires to settle between these beliefs, perhaps because he has decided\nto look for a new job were Jones to become his new boss. By\nimplication, interpersonal agreement in belief occurs when two or more\npeople have beliefs that can all be true or, if they cannot all be\ntrue, have no desire, etc. for them to be so (1944, 4–5; 1950,\n55–60). Personal “certainty” in belief occurs when an individual\nhas settled on, or ceases to care about, what to believe (see\nespecially 1963b, 191–194; 1950, 55–60). \nAnalogously, interpersonal disagreement in attitude occurs when two or\nmore people have attitudes or interests—i.e., desires, feelings,\nattitudes, plans, intentions, or other affective psychological states\nwhose general nature is that of being for or being\nagainst something (1948b, 2)—that cannot all be jointly satisfied\n(had, felt, etc.) and there is a desire, need, or attempt to coordinate\nthose interests. If Smith and Jones desire to dine together, but\nSmith desires to dine at a restaurant where there is music, while Jones\ndesires to dine at a quiet restaurant, they disagree, in a quite\nordinary sense of the term, about where to dine (1944, 3). This\nkind of disagreement, as Stevenson notes, “springs more from divergent\npreferences than from divergent beliefs, and will end when they both\nwish to go the same place. It will be a mild, temporary\ndisagreement for this simple case—a disagreement in miniature;\nyet it will be a ‘disagreement’ in a wholly familiar sense” (1944,\n3). Indeed, for Stevenson, interpersonal disagreements in\nattitude are not only unextraordinary, they are ubiquitous: \nFurther examples are easily found. Mrs. A has social aspirations, and\nwants to move with the elite. Mr. A is easy-going, and loyal to his\nold friends. They accordingly disagree about what guests they will\ninvite to their party. The curator of the museum wants to buy pictures\nby contemporary artists; some of his advisors prefer the purchase of\nold masters. They disagree. John's mother is concerned about the\ndangers of playing football, and doesn't want him to play. John, even\nthough he agrees (in belief) about the dangers, wants to play anyhow.\nAgain, they disagree. (1944, 3) \nPersonal uncertainty in attitude occurs when an individual is\nuncertain about how to feel or what to do about some object or event,\nbut desires to feel or do something appropriate with respect to that\nobject or event. For example, Smith may currently be neither for nor\nagainst some particular legislation proposal, but desires to determine\nwhether he is for or against the proposal so he can vote\nresponsibly. By implication, interpersonal agreement in attitude\noccurs when two or more people have attitudes that can all be jointly\nsatisfied or when there is no desire, etc. for them to be all\nsatisfied (1944, 4–5; 1950, 55–60), and personal\n“certainty” in attitude occurs when an individual has\nsettled on, or has no desire to settle on, how to feel or what to do\nabout a particular object or event (1963b, 191–194; 1950,\n55–60). Interpersonal disagreement and personal uncertainty in\nbelief and attitude thus differ essentially in that “the former\nis concerned with how matters are truthfully to be described and\nexplained; the latter is concerned with how they are to be favored or\ndisfavored, and hence with how they are to be shaped by human\nefforts” (1944, 4). \nSince there can be agreement and disagreement with respect to beliefs\nand attitudes, there are four possible combinations of agreement and\ndisagreement (1944, 6–7). Two people can agree in attitude but\ndisagree in belief. For example, two researchers may value and aim to\nproduce a cure for a particular disease, but disagree about whether a\nproposed treatment would produce its cure. In this case, the two\nresearchers may come to disagree about whether to implement the\nproposed treatment. Their disagreement would be grounded in\ndisagreement in belief, and ensuing discussion would likely focus on\ncoordinating their respective beliefs. Alternatively, two people may\nagree in belief but disagree in attitude. Our two researchers, for\nexample, may agree that proposed treatments T1 and\nT2 may produce a cure for diseases\nD1 and D2 respectively, but\ndisagree about whether available but limited funding ought to be used\nto cure D1 or D2 and, hence,\nought to be used to develop T1 or\nT2. In this case, the two researchers may disagree\nabout whether to develop T1 or\nT2. Their disagreement would be grounded in\ndisagreement in attitude, and ensuing discussion would likely focus on\ncoordinating their respective attitudes. And two people may disagree\nboth in belief and attitude, in which case disagreement would be\ngrounded in both, and two people may agree in both belief and\nattitude, in which case there may be no disagreement.\n \n\nStevenson does not assume that interpersonal disagreement always\nsignals that one is intending to get another to changes her beliefs or\nattitudes, to win the argument as it were. It may, and often is,\nthe case that one is open to having his or her own beliefs or attitudes\nchanged in the course of open-minded discussion or deliberation.\nThus neither disagreement in belief nor disagreement in attitude need\nbe an “occasion for forensic rivalry; it may be an occasion for an\ninterchange of aims, with a reciprocal influence that both parties find\nto be beneficial” (1944, 4–5). \nGiven that beliefs and attitudes play a crucial organizing role in\nStevenson's full-blown emotivism, one is entitled to inquire about the\nnature of these psychological states—what these respective attitudes\nare. Stevenson provides a rather thin account of\nthe nature of various psychological states and, consequently, provides\nlittle detail about the nature of belief and attitude. Part of\nthe reason for the lack of detail is their complexity. Stevenson\nrejects the “antiquated school of thought” according to which beliefs\nare “so many mental photographs, the product of a cognitive faculty,\nwhereas attitudes stand apart as the drives or forces of a totally\ndifferent faculty,” and, hence, adopts the view that beliefs and\nattitudes are more alike than folk psychology suggests (1944, 7).\nRather, he accepts a dispositional theory of psychological states,\nincluding of beliefs and attitudes, according to which these states are\ndistinguishable by their respective complex causal relations (1944,\n7–8; 1950). More will be said about Stevenson's view of\ndispositions in\n Section 3.2.\nAlthough Stevenson fails to provide a detailed account\nof the nature of belief and attitude, he does think that these are\neasily distinguishable in our daily experience and, thus, that there is\na distinction “certainly beyond any practical objection” (1944,\n7). It is also beyond any practical objection that beliefs and\nattitudes causally affect each other. Consider an onlooker who\nwitnesses a chess expert open weakly against a novice and wonders: \nDoes he make the move because he believes that it is a strong\none, or because out of charity to his opponent, he doesn't\nwant to make a strong one? The distinction here between a\nbelief and a want (attitude) is certainly beyond any practical\nobjection. One can imagine the expert, with constant beliefs about the\nopening, using it or not in accordance with his changing desires to\nwin; or one can imagine him, with constant desires to win, using it or\nnot in accordance with his changing beliefs.  If in imagining this\nindependent variation of the ‘causal factors’ involved one\nis tempted to hypostatize either ‘belief’ or\n‘attitude,’ the fault must be corrected not by dispensing\nwith the terms in favor of purely generic talk about action,\nbut rather by coming to understand the full complexity of reference\nthat lies behind the convenient simplicity of language. (1944,\n7–8) \n\nThus, for Stevenson, beliefs and attitudes are different, yet causally\nrelated. Attitudes may causally affect beliefs, as when people\nwishfully believe that they will win the upcoming lottery or when\nparties conjure beliefs about a pub's closing hours while desiring one\nmore beer at late night. Likewise, beliefs may causally affect\nattitudes, as when employees begin to disapprove of their company CEO\nbecause of their newly acquired beliefs concerning her exorbitant\ncompensation package. Often beliefs and attitudes affect each\nother (1944, 5; 1950). \n\nAre moral problems essentially disagreements or uncertainties in\nbelief, attitude, or both? And are moral judgments constituted by\nbeliefs, attitudes, or both? Stevenson asserts that moral\nproblems almost always involve both types of disagreement or\nuncertainty (1944, 11; 1948b, 4). For example, consider an\nethical disagreement between a union representative and a company\nrepresentative over an increase in employee wages: \nSuch an argument clearly represents a disagreement in attitude. The\nunion is for higher wages; the company is against\nthem, and neither is content to let the other's attitude remain\nunchanged. In addition to this disagreement in attitude, of\ncourse, the argument may represent no little disagreement in\nbelief. Perhaps the parties disagree about how much the cost of living\nhas risen and how much the workers are suffering under the present\nwage scale. Or perhaps they disagree about the company's earnings and\nthe extent to which the company could raise wages and still operate at\na profit. Like any typical ethical argument, then, this argument\ninvolves both disagreement in attitude and disagreement in\nbelief. (1948b, 4)  However, although moral problems almost always involve both types\nof disagreement or uncertainty, their distinguishing feature is\ndisagreement or uncertainty in attitude. In fact, moral disagreement\nor uncertainty may sometimes involve only that in attitude. Stevenson\nwields four arguments for this conclusion, three of which may be\ncalled the “Internalist,” “Desirability,” and\n“Generational Arguments.” The Internalist Argument is an\nintuitive appeal to what is now often called “motivational\njudgment internalism,” roughly, the view that there is a\nnecessary connection between one's moral judgments and motivational\nstates. Our actual moral judgments and disagreements, Stevenson\nintuits, involve “something more than a disinterested\ndescription, or a cold debate about whether [something] is already\napproved, or when it spontaneously will be” (1944, 13; see also\n1948b, 3–4). Reflection on possible moral judgments and\ndisagreements also leads Stevenson to the same intuitive\nconclusion. Consider a person who is fully persuaded that what he did\nwas wrong and, for that very reason, is more in favor of doing it\nagain: \nTemporarily puzzled to understand him, we shall be likely to\nconclude, ‘This is his paradoxical way of abusing what he considers our\noutworn moral conventions. He means to say that it is really all\nright to do it, and that one ought to do it flagrantly in order to\ndiscredit the many people who consider it wrong’. But\nwhatever we may make of his meaning (and there are several other\ninterpretations possible) we shall scarcely take seriously his\nprotestations of agreement. Were we not trying all along to make\nhim disapprove of his action? Would not his ethical agreement\nwith us require that he share our disfavor—that he agree with us\nin attitude? (1944, 16–17) \n\nThe Desirability Argument appeals to an oft-leveled objection to J. S.\nMill's claim that the only proof that can be given that something is\ndesirable is that people actually desire it (Utilitarianism,\nCh. 4, para. 3). The objection is that Mill equivocates on\n‘desirable’, which could mean either ‘capable of\nbeing desired’, or ‘worthy of being desired’ (see,\nfor example, Moore, 1903, Section 40). If the former, then Mill's\nclaim is a truism and, hence, would rarely occasion any kind of\ndisagreement. If the latter, however, then Mill's claim is a\ncontroversial moral claim. Would such a controversy be essentially\ndisagreement in belief or in attitude? Stevenson concludes that it\nwould be disagreement in attitude, again appealing to intuition: \nThe statement so far from being axiomatic becomes highly\ncontroversial. And it becomes so for a reason that is\neasily understood. ‘That which is desired is desirable’ is a\nstatement of the easy-going man who wishes to encourage people to leave\ntheir present desires unchanged; and conversely, the statement, ‘That\nwhich is desired is not desirable’ is characteristic of the stern\nreformer, who seeks to alter or inhibit existing desires.\nStatements about what is desirable, unlike those about what is desired,\nserve not to describe attitudes, merely, but to intensify or alter\nthem. (1944, 17–18) \n\nThe Generational Argument is an argument from the best explanation\nabout the cause of the disparity of ethical views that often occur\nbetween people of widely different generations, ethnic or racial\ncommunities, and geographic locations. According Stevenson, the\ndisparity is adequately explained if ethical disagreement were\nessentially disagreement in attitude, “for different temperaments,\nsocial needs, and group pressures would more directly and urgently lead\nthese people to have opposed attitudes than it would lead them to have\nopposed factual beliefs” (1944, 18). \nMany today would find these three arguments controversial at best,\nespecially taken individually. The Internalist Argument is\ncontroversial for at least two reasons. First, the upshot of the\nthesis of motivational judgment internalism is that it would be\nimpossible to make moral judgments without being appropriately\nmotivated; for example, it would be impossible to genuinely think\nthat insulting others is wrong without being motivated at\nleast to some extent to avoid or prevent insults to others.\nHowever, some claim that this implication is too strong, appealing\neither to their own intuitions that genuine-but-nonmotivating moral\njudgments are possible or to accepted standards of burden of proof\narguments, which are thought to place the burden on internalists to\nargue for the impossibility of such judgments (Brink 1989;\nRailton 1986; Shafer-Landau 2003; Svavarsdottir 1999, 2006). More\nrecent objections to motivational judgment internalism appeal to\nempirical evidence from the neuro and cognitive sciences.\nAlthough appeal to such evidence is itself controversial (e.g.,\nKauppinen 2008, Prinz 2006), some suggest that persons with certain\ndamaged or underdeveloped brain functions, perhaps including\npsychopaths and sociopaths, actually make such genuine\njudgments (e.g., Roskies 2003, 2005). A second controversy over\nStevenson's Internalist Argument is its assumption that beliefs are\nmotivationally inert, that is, that beliefs are insufficient by\nthemselves to generate motivating states and, therefore, that moral\njudgments must be constituted at least in part by affective attitudes\n(which are taken to be inherently moving). While some object to\nthe assumption itself, arguing that some beliefs are in fact inherently\nmotivating, or at least sufficient to generate motivating states (e.g.,\n Dancy 1993, Scanlon 1998, Shafer-Landau 2003), others object to\nStevenson's inference from that assumption to the further conclusion\nthat moral judgments must be constituted at least in part by affective\nattitudes (e.g., Railton 1986, Smith 1994). For in-depth but\naccessible overviews of the issues surrounding moral judgment and\nmotivation, see the entries on \n moral motivation\nand \n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.\n \n\nStevenson's Desirability and Generational Arguments are also\ncontroversial at best. The Desirability argument appears to\ncollapse into the Internalist Argument, for it is at bottom an appeal\nto the internalist intuition that disagreement over whether something\nis worthy of being desired is, essentially, disagreement in\nattitude. Finally, Stevenson himself recognizes the relative\nweakness of the Generational Argument, admitting that the disparity in\nethical views between individuals of different generations, etc. may\njust as well be explained, for example, by disagreement in belief about\nthe qualities or consequences of certain actions, people, policies,\netc. (1944, 18). \nBefore turning to Stevenson's fourth argument, it is important to note\nthat these two theses—that moral judgments are essentially constituted\nat least in part by attitudes and that moral disagreement is\nessentially disagreement in attitude—are two of the features that made\nStevenson's theory novel for its time and that continue to be of\nlasting importance. For although a number of other “interest”\ntheories had taken seriously the central role that attitudes play in\nmoral judgment and disagreement, these theories, according to\nStevenson, had erred in holding that moral judgments are essentially\nbeliefs about attitudes and, consequently, that moral\ndisagreement is essentially disagreement in belief (about\nattitudes): \nA long tradition of ethical theorists strongly suggest, whether\nthey always intend to or not, that the disagreement is one in\nbelief. Naturalistic theorists, for instance, identify an\nethical judgment with some sort of scientific statement, and so make\nnormative ethics a branch of science. Now a scientific argument\ntypically exemplifies disagreement in belief, and if an ethical\nargument is simply a scientific one, then it too exemplifies\ndisagreement in belief. The usual naturalistic theories of ethics\nthat stress attitudes—such as those of Hume, Westermarck, Perry,\nRichards, and so many others—stress disagreement in belief no\nless than the rest. They imply, of course, that disagreement\nabout what is good is simply one sort of disagreement in\nbelief about attitudes; but we have seen that that is simply one\nsort of disagreement in belief, and by no means the same as\ndisagreement in attitude. Analyses that stress\ndisagreement in attitude are extremely rare. (1948b, 3; see also 1944,\n9–10) \n\nThese theses also continue to motivate current day expressivists, such\nBlackburn (1984, 1993) and Gibbard (1990, 2003). \n\nStevenson's fourth argument for the view that moral disagreement\nessentially involves disagreement in attitude relies on the\n“conspicuous role” that disagreement in attitude plays in\nunifying moral disagreements; hence, this argument may be\ncalled the “Unification Argument.” According to Stevenson,\ndisagreement in attitude imposes a “characteristic type or\norganization” on the beliefs that could serve to resolve moral\ndisagreement, and, therefore, is that which most distinguishes ethical\nissues from scientific issues (1944, 13; see also 1948b, 4).\nDisagreement in attitude unifies moral disagreement in at least two\nways. First, disagreement in attitude determines which beliefs\nare relevant to ethical deliberation, for “any belief that is\nintroduced into the argument must be one that is likely to lead one\nside or the other to have a different attitude …. But\nbeliefs that are likely to alter the attitudes of neither side …\nwill have no bearing on the disagreement in attitude, with which both\nparties are primarily concerned” (1948b, 4–5; see also 1944, 14).\nSecond, disagreement in attitude determines when an ethical problem is\nresolved:  If the men come to agree in belief about all the factual matters\nthey have considered, and if they continue to have divergent aims in\nspite of this … they will still have an ethical issue that is\nunresolved. But if they come to agree [in attitude], they will have\nbrought their ethical issue to an end; and this will be so even though\nvarious beliefs … still remain debatable. Both men may conclude\nthat these remaining beliefs, no matter how they are later settled,\nwill have no decisive effect on their attitudes. (1944, 14–15;\nsee also 1948b, 6) \n\nThis triumvirate—that beliefs and attitudes are different yet\ncausally related, that moral disagreement essentially involves\ndisagreement in attitude, and that moral disagreement also typically\ninvolves disagreement in belief—provides much of the leverage for\nthe remainder of Stevenson's full-blown ethical theory involving moral\nlanguage and methodology and provides the grounds for insisting that\nethical inquiry cannot be a science. For this package of views\ntogether inform his conclusions about the nature of and differences\nbetween ethical and scientific problems, functions,\nlanguage, and methods. Ethical problems,\naccording to Stevenson, are constituted at least in part by\ndisagreement in attitude, while scientific problems are constituted\nonly by disagreement in belief; hence, the function of ethical inquiry\nis at least in part to coordinate or settle attitudes, while the\nfunction of scientific inquiry is to coordinate or settle only\nbeliefs. Ethical language, then, must have features,\nnamely, emotive meaning\n (Section 3.3),\nthat make it\napt for coordinating attitudes, while scientific language need only\nhave features, namely, descriptive meaning\n (Section 3.3)\nthat make it\napt for coordinating beliefs. Finally, the linguistic methods for\nresolving ethical disputes must be grounded at least in part by the\nrelations among beliefs and attitudes, while those for resolving\nscientific disputes need be guided only by the relations among\nbeliefs. For these reasons, ethics is not—and cannot\nbe—a science: \n(S)cientific methods cannot guarantee the definite role in the\nso-called normative sciences that they may have in the natural\nsciences. Apart from a heuristic assumption to the contrary, it\nis possible that the growth of scientific knowledge may leave many\ndisputes about values permanently unsolved. … For the same\nreason I conclude that normative ethics is not a branch of any\nscience. It deliberately deals with a type of disagreement that\nscience deliberately avoids. … Insofar as normative ethics\ndraws from the sciences, in order to change attitudes via\nchanging people's beliefs, it draws from all the\nsciences; but a moralist's peculiar aim—that of\nredirecting attitudes—is a type of activity, rather than\nknowledge, and falls within no science. Science may study that\nactivity and may help indirectly to forward it; but it is not\nidentical with that activity. (1948b, 7–8) \n\nFor Stevenson, language is an instrument or tool for serving certain\npurposes; ethical language is thus suited especially for the central\npurposes of ethics. Since the central purposes of ethics are to\nresolve or coordinate attitudes, an analysis of ethical language must\nreveal how ethical language serves these dynamic purposes. It\ndoes so, according to Stevenson, by having emotive meaning in addition\nto descriptive meaning, where meaning is to be cashed out in\n“pragmatic” or dispositional terms as a network of causal relations\nthat obtain between language and psychology. \n\nStevenson intends to provide a theory of emotive and descriptive\nmeaning in the “pragmatic” or “psychological” sense, where this sense\nof ‘meaning’ invokes the work of Charles Morris. In\nFoundations of the Theory of Signs (1938), Morris had\nsuggested a tripartite division of the study of signs into (i) syntax,\nthe study of the relations among signs; (ii) semantics, the study of\nthe relations among signs and their designations or denotations; and\n(iii) pragmatics, the study of signs as they are used by members of a\ncommunity in order to “meet more satisfactorily their individual and\ncommon needs” (10), that is, the study of signs as they are used to\ncoordinate mental and social life. Taking this cue from Morris,\nStevenson seeks to provide a theory of meaning in terms of the\n“psychological reactions” of those who use the signs (1944, 42), and,\nthen, to distinguish emotive and descriptive meaning by the different\ntypes of psychological reaction associated with the use of emotive and\ndescriptive language respectively. \nAccording to Stevenson, explaining emotive and descriptive meaning in\nthis psychological sense of ‘meaning’ would be promising if it did not\nencounter an immediate problem that “has long been one of the most\ntroublesome aspects of linguistic theory” (1944, 42; 1937, 20).\nThe problem, as Stevenson saw it, is that the meaning of an expression\nmust be relatively stable across a variety of social and linguistic\ncontexts, lest the expression be unhelpful to our understanding of the\nmany contexts in which the expression is used; however, the\npsychological states associated with an expression vary widely across\nsocial and linguistic contexts. At a football game, for example,\n‘Hooray!’ may be shouted in connection with terrific excitement, but at\nother times with little emotion at all; likewise, to a postmaster who\nregularly sorts the mail, “‘Connecticut’ may cause only a toss of the\nhand, but for an old resident it may bring a train of reminiscences”\n(1944, 43). Similarly, the sentence ‘This legislation is just’\nmay be used to express a favorable attitude towards a particular piece\nof legislation, but not when embedded within the more complex sentence\n‘Vote for this legislation only if it is just’. Thus, \nSome variation (of psychological states) must of course be allowed,\nelse we shall end with a fictitious entity, serene and thoroughly\nuseless amid the complexities of actual practice; but\n‘meaning’ is a term wanted for marking off something\nrelatively constant amid these complexities, not merely for paying\nthem deference. A sense is needed where a sign may ‘mean’\nless than it ‘suggests’—a sense in which meanings\nare helpful to the understanding of many contexts, not some\nvagrant sense in which a word has a wholly different\n‘meaning’ every time it is used. (1944, 43) \n\nStevenson's task, then, is to provide a psychological theory of meaning\naccording to which the psychological states associated with an\nexpression's use, and hence an expression's meaning, remains relatively\nconstant across contexts. \n\nStevenson's solution to this problem of flux is to provide a\ndispositional theory of meaning grounded in the causal-historical\nrelations between a sign and the psychological states of those within\na linguistic community who have used and reacted, and continue to use\nand react, to the sign. Thus, Stevenson's is not a\n“use,” “tool,” or “instrumental”\ntheory of meaning, for a sign's meaning is not constituted by its use\non an occasion of utterance. Rather, a sign's meaning is constituted\nby its power—its “tendency,”\n“potentiality,” “latent ability,” or\n“disposition” (1937, 20–22; 1944, 46; 1948a,\n158)—to evoke the psychological states of a hearer or to be used\nto express those of a speaker. The “power” of an\nexpression, like the purchasing “power” of a dollar, or\nthe stimulating “power” of coffee, is to be understood not\nas some mysterious entity or force, but rather as a complex network of\ncausal relations: \nThe word ‘disposition’ …, is useful in dealing with\ncomplicated causal situations, where some specified sort of\nevent is a function of many variables. To illustrate\n… Although coffee often ‘causes’ stimulation, it is never\nthe only cause. The degree of stimulation will depend as well on\nmany other factors—the initial state of a man's fatigue, the\nabsorptive state of his stomach, the constitution of his nervous\nsystem, and so on. (1944, 46) \n\nJust as the stimulating power of coffee remains relatively unchanged\ndespite varied reactions or responses to the ingestion of coffee, so\ntoo does the meaning of an expression remain relatively unchanged\ndespite varied psychological states resulting from or leading to the\narticulation of an expression (1944, 46–47). \n\nA closer look at Stevenson's notion of dispositions might be\nhelpful. A disposition, on Stevenson's account, is a complex\ncausal network consisting of (i) stimuli, (ii) responses, (iii)\ncontextual or “attendant” circumstances of the stimuli, which are\nsubject to occasional or even frequent change, and (iv) the “bases” of\nthe disposition, which are the set of circumstances that are subject to\nmuch less frequent change. Considering again Stevenson's own\nexample, the stimulating power of coffee is a disposition constituted\nby a complex causal network consisting of: stimuli, such as the\nvariable amounts of coffee ingested; and responses, such as the\nresulting changes in energy, attention, anxiety, or irritation.\nThese stimuli and responses are mediated by: attendant circumstances,\nsuch as a drinker's fatigue at the time of ingestion, the absorptive\nrate of her stomach, or the constitution of her nervous system; and the\nbasis of the disposition, such as the chemical composition of the\ncoffee or the soil conditions where it was grown. The responses,\nthen, are a function of the stimuli, attendant circumstances, and\nbasis, and one who specifies these and who specifies in detail their\ncorrelation “has said all about the disposition that there is to say”\n(1944, 51). \n\nAnalogously, the meaning of a sentence, such as ‘Hooray’, is\nconstituted in part by a complex causal network of: stimuli, such as\nthe spoken or written tokens of ‘Hooray!’; and responses, such as\nexcitement, affection, or possibly even annoyance. These are\nmediated by: attendant circumstances, such the time, location, or\nsociological context (e.g., whether the person uttering ‘Hooray!’ is a\nfellow fan or rival) of the utterance; and the basis of the\ndisposition. The basis of a sign's disposition is a notion that\nis especially underdeveloped in Stevenson's work. He does say\nthat to count as meaningful, a sign's disposition must have been caused\nby, and would not have developed without, an “elaborate process of\nconditioning which has attended the sign's use in communication” (1944,\n57), a requirement necessary to distinguish linguistic meaning from\nother general phenomena that might be said to have meaning in some very\nbroad sense, such as a cough that might be said to “mean” that a person\nhas a cold. Thus, for Stevenson, the linguistic meaning of a sign\nis tied to linguistic conventions that have developed in light of the\nhistory of a sign's use in a variety of situations. Perhaps this\nqualification suggests that the basis of a sign's disposition is its\nhistory of use in attendant circumstances within a linguistic\ncommunity. \n\nIn any case, in addition to the “active” disposition of a sign\nto evoke particular psychological states of a hearer, the\nmeaning of a sign is also constituted in part by a “passive”\ndisposition to be used to express the psychological states of\na speaker (1944, 57–58). The essential difference between these\ndispositions is that the kinds of stimuli and responses are\n“reversed.” In the case of a sign's active disposition, the\nstimuli are the token productions of the sign, while the responses are\nthe psychological states of a hearer; however, in the case of a sign's\npassive disposition, the stimuli are psychological states of a person,\nthe responses the token productions of the sign. Thus, for\nStevenson, the meaning of a term is the “conjunction” or union of two\ndispositions, one “active” disposition to evoke psychological states of\na hearer, another “passive” disposition to be used to express the\npsychological states of a speaker, where a disposition is a complex\ncausal network of stimuli, responses, attendant circumstances, and\nbasis. Stevenson warns that his account of meaning, understood in\ncausal-dispositional terms, should not be taken as anything close to a\ncomplete theory of meaning, but only the detailed outlines of one that\nmust be extraordinarily complex (EL, 58). \n\nFor Stevenson, the meaning of a sign is a complex dispositional\nproperty. Consequently, since the sentences of a language have\ndistinguishable kinds of dispositions, they have distinguishable kinds\nof meaning. \n\nThe emotive meaning of a sign is a disposition that relates the sign\nto a range of attitudes (1944, 59–60). From a hearer or reader's\npoint of view, feelings or attitudes are the responses, tokens of the\nsign are the stimuli; from a speaker or writer's point of view,\nattitudes are the stimuli, tokens of the sign are the responses.\nAn attitude is itself a disposition whose stimuli and responses relate\nto “hindering or assisting” the object of the attitude, that which one\nis for or against (1944, 60). As a disposition, the emotive\nmeaning of a sign remains relatively stable, though responses may vary\nacross contexts given different attendant, or contextual, circumstances\n(1944, 60). Thus, a speaker's utterance of “Hooray!” may be\noccasioned by excitement or, on rare occasion, even indifference; but\nthe disposition of the sign to be used to express or to evoke these\nvarying attitudes remains relatively stable, its stability a result of\nan “elaborate process of conditioning” that gives rise to linguistic\nconventions (1944, 60–62). Emotive meaning, for Stevenson, is not\na degenerate kind of meaning, as is sometimes thought to be the\nconclusion of some Logical Positivists, such as Ayer (1936).\nRather, Stevenson is among the group of philosophers, linguists,\ncritical and value theorists, such as Richards (1924, 1926, and with\nOgden 1922) and Perry (1926), who seek to re-establish, in an era of\nscientific enthusiasm, the importance of emotive language and meaning\nfor coordinating mental and social life: \nIt may be well to guard against the tendency, too common among\npopular writers, to separate meanings into the sheep and the goats—a\nprocedure which militates against detachment, and hides the need for a\nmore detailed classification (of meaningful language)…. In\nparticular, the term ‘emotive’ is sometimes used in an extremely rough\nway, until it labels a wastebasket for the many aspects of linguistic\nusage that are detrimental or irrelevant to the purposes of\nscience. … (This) usage is not at all fortunate when it\nleads one to suppose, as it too readily does, that any expression\nclassifiable as emotive is thereby perfectly put in its place,\nrequiring no further attention. (1944, 76–77) \n\nThe descriptive meaning of a sign is a disposition that relates the\nsign to a range of “cognitive” states, including belief, supposition,\npresumption, etc. From a hearer or reader's point of view,\ncognitive states are the responses, tokens of the sign are the\nstimuli. From a speaker or writer's point of view, cognitive\nstates are the stimuli, tokens of the sign are the responses.\nCognitive states, like attitudes, are complex dispositions. \n\nIndeed, according to Stevenson, cognitive states and attitudes are\ndispositions so complex that he can give no precise account of\nthem. He does, however, try to clarify by analogy the complexity\nwith which cognition and attitudes are linked to action. Consider\na small ball of iron surrounded by magnets, each with its own\ndisposition to affect the ball: \nThe current is switched on, and the ball moves in a certain\nway. Now each of the magnets has a disposition to affect the\nmotion of the ball, but the actual motion of it cannot be related to\none of these dispositions alone; it must be related to all.\nChange any of the magnets, and, all else remaining constant, the motion\nof the ball will change as well. In spite of many differences,\nthis case parallels the one in question. Several dispositional\nproperties are present together, each making a difference to the way\nany other is realized. … There is clearly nothing mysterious\nabout such a situation. The term ‘disposition’ is used, as\nalways, to refer to a complicated milieu in which a given sort of event\nhas many causes. Here the situation is complicated enough to\nrequire the mention of several dispositions. … It is after\nthis fashion, perhaps, that cognition must be conceived—as a\ndisposition whose response is modified by that of many other\ndispositions. (1944, 65–66) \n\nThe emotive and descriptive meanings of signs are related in a\nvariety of ways. Signs may have both emotive and descriptive\nmeaning, and often do. Perhaps a noncontroversial example\nis the sentence ‘That was courageous’, whose descriptive meaning\nrelates tokens of the sentence to cognitive states that, in some way,\nrepresent the action referred to as one performed in spite of an\nactor's fear, and whose emotive meaning relates tokens of the sentence\nto favorable states, such as admiration towards the action or\nactor. According to Stevenson, almost all words in a natural\nlanguage have both emotive and descriptive meaning owing to their\nhistorical uses in emotional contexts (1944, 71). The interplay\nof emotive and descriptive meaning also affects the development and\nevolution of sign's meaning, a result of the relative independence of\nthe two kinds of meaning. Stevenson suggests, for example, that\nthe word ‘democracy’ may have come to possess its laudatory emotive\nmeaning in America because the word refers, via its descriptive\nmeaning, to properties of government that Americans favored. But\nnow:  Suppose, for example, that a group of people should come to\ndisapprove of certain aspects of democracy, but continue to approve of\nother aspects of it. They might leave the descriptive meaning of\n‘democracy’ unchanged, and gradually let it acquire, for\ntheir usage, a much less laudatory emotive meaning. On the other hand,\nthey might keep the strong laudatory meaning unchanged, and let\n‘democracy’ acquire a descriptive sense which made\nreference only to those aspects of democracy (in the older sense)\nwhich they favored. It is often essential, if failures in\ncommunication are to be avoided, to determine which of these changes\nis taking place; and the distinction between emotive and descriptive\nmeaning is of great use in studying the matter. (1944, 72)  Emotive and descriptive meaning can thus be independent to varying\ndegrees. Consequently, one kind of meaning can survive change or even\ndisappearance of the other. The independence of the emotive meaning of\na sign can be roughly tested by comparing the meaning of a sign with\nthat of a sign that is a descriptive, but not an emotive,\nsynonym. (Stevenson holds that signs rarely, if ever, have emotive\nsynonyms given their respective “emotional histories”\n(1944, 82).) Thus, to whatever extent the laudatory strength of\n‘democracy’ exceeds that of ‘government where rule\nis by popular vote’, the emotive meaning of the former will be\nindependent of the latter (1944, 73).  Ethical language should be suitable for the purposes of\nethics. Since, for Stevenson, the purposes of ethics are to settle,\ncoordinate, or otherwise resolve disagreements in attitude, an\nanalysis of ethical language must display how ethical language is apt\nfor performing these functions. It is apt, according to Stevenson,\nbecause ethical language (i) almost always has both emotive and\ndescriptive meaning, where (ii) emotive meaning is essential and (iii)\noften strongly independent of descriptive meaning (in the sense in\nwhich “thin” ethical terms, such as ‘good’,\nmight be said to have emotive meaning that is strongly independent of\nany descriptive meaning it might have). That ethical language has\nessential emotive meaning—that is, has dispositions in which\nattitudes play a most prominent role—implies as it should that\nattitudes and feelings are at issue in cases of moral disagreement or\nuncertainty. That ethical language usually has both emotive and\ndescriptive meanings which often interact in various ways suggests as\nit should that beliefs, and therefore rational methods, can be\nrelevant to resolving moral disagreement or uncertainty. That emotive\nmeaning is often strongly independent of descriptive meaning suggests\nas it should that nonrational “persuasive” methods can\nalso play a role in settling or resolving moral disagreement or\nuncertainty. \nStevenson aims to clarify ethical language by using\n“tools” of analysis. One tool that Stevenson will\nnot use to clarify ethical language is the tool of\ndefinition, at least in the sense of ‘definition’ that\nimplies “finding synonym for synonym,” since he thinks\nthat ethical terms, due to their emotive meanings, are indefinable in\nthis sense (1944, 82). Rather, Stevenson's analytic tool of choice is\na set of models. The models highlight the respective dispositional\nelements (i.e. elements of meaning) of ethical language that, via its\nuse, are to varying degrees in linguistic play (1944,\n82–83). \nTwo such models, labled ‘(P1)’ and\n‘(P4)’ below, receive a great deal of\nStevenson's attention, because they paradigmatically exemplify for the\nsentence ‘This is good’ what Stevenson calls respectively\nhis “First Pattern” and “Second Pattern” of\nanalysis. These patterns and, hence, (P1) and\n(P4) differ most importantly in descriptive richness and\nemotive force. (P1)'s descriptive content is scant,\nconveying only information about the speaker's attitude and,\ntherefore, conveying only somewhat more information than is conveyed\nby (P1)'s relatively strong emotive element; therefore,\n(P1) well-models those uses of an ethical sentence at which\nfront and center is a speaker's attitude. (P4)'s\ndescriptive content conveys more complex, precise information about\nthe qualities of which the speaker approves and merely characterizes\n‘This is good’ as conveying emotive force; therefore,\n(P4) well-models those uses of an ethical sentence at which\nfront and center are a speaker's moral standards. \nAs models, (P1) and (P4) have different\nstrengths and weaknesses, and while discussing them Stevenson suggests\nor implies several other models:\n(P2a)-(P3c). Like (P1),\n(P2a)-(P2c) exemplify Stevenson's First Pattern\nof Analysis, and, like (P4),\n(P3a)-(P3c) exemplify Stevenson's Second Pattern\nof Analysis. Notice that each subset of models, and each model within\neach subset, is listed roughly in order of increasing descriptive\nrichness and decreasing emotive force. \nDiscussion begins with (P1), returning later to (P0a)–(P0d).\n \n‘This is good’ means:\n \nModel (P1) contains two sentences each of a different mood:\n‘I approve of this’, a non-normative declarative sentence,\nand ‘Do so as well’, a second-person imperative. As a\nnon-normative declarative sentence, ‘I approve of\nX’ is passively disposed, Stevenson thinks, to be used\nby a speaker or writer who believes the world is as described—in\nthis case, by a speaker or writer who believes that she approves of\nthat which is demonstrated by ‘this’—and is actively\ndisposed to evoke a similar belief or cognitive state in an audience\nupon its being heard or read. Similarly, as a second-person imperative\nsentence, ‘Do so as well’ is passively disposed, Stevenson\nthinks, to be used by a speaker or writer who desires her audience\neither to share her favorable attitude or to engage in the particular\nkind of behavior demonstrated, and is actively disposed to effect that\nparticular attitude or behavior of a hearer or reader. Thus,\n(P1) is intended to clarify the sense in which ethical\nlanguage dispositionally relates ethical terms to both attitudes and\nbeliefs, and thus, the sense in which ethical language has both\nemotive and descriptive meaning. As a model, (P1) also\nhelps to clarify several other important features of ethical language.\nFor example: the descriptive sentence in (P1) has quite\nnarrow descriptive content, namely, that the speaker approves of the\nparticular object or act to which she is referring; the imperative\nsentence has especially direct emotive force, strongly commanding\none's audience to have similar favorable attitudes; and both sentences\nare, of course, about attitudes. Thus, (P1) is intended to\nbring to light that ethical terms sometimes bring, or are brought,\ninto play by narrow descriptive content, as with many uses of\n“thin” ethical terms like ‘good’,\nright’, etc.—though also sometimes even by\n“thick” ethical terms like ‘courage’ or\n‘justice’; as Stevenson writes, “We all know that a\npolitician who promises ‘justice’ commits himself to very\nlittle, unless he defines the term before the election” (1944,\n35)—and sometimes have very direct emotive force, as when a\nparent strongly intones to her child that she (the child) is to share\nthe parent's favorable attitude towards sharing with others. Also, by\nforcing attitudes to center-stage, (P1) captures the\nessential nature and organizational focus of moral problems as\ndescribed in Section 2.3.  Finally,\nbecause the descriptive content of the declarative is relativized to a\nspeaker, (P1) brings to the fore the speaker-relativity of\nthe descriptive meaning of ethical terms, a point to which Stevenson\nreturns on several occasions (e.g., 1944, 227–232).\n \n\nDespite its usefulness, Stevenson's (P1) is not be taken as\nsome sort of “official” model of ethical sentences. It\nmight be tempting to do so, given that Stevenson devotes a great deal\nof space in Ethics and Language discussing the various\nfeatures and implications of (P1). Despite the temptation,\nStevenson himself later came to regret putting (P1) front\nand center, and this for two reasons. First, (P1) has the\nimplausible methodological implication that to fully justify a moral\nclaim, such as ‘This is good’, one must provide reasons\nfor believing that one approves of the object that\n(P1) describes one as having (1963b, 210–212). Second\nand more importantly, taking (P1) as a sort of\n“official” model masks Stevenson's own sensitivity to the\nmyriad of ways in which (P1) is misleading or\notherwise defective. Five of (P1)'s misleading features are\nas follows: \nModels (P2a)–(P2c) rectify Problems 1 and\n2 to some degree in several ways. First, each lessens the blunt force\nand authoritativeness of the second-person imperative by using a more\ninterpersonally agreeable first-person plural imperative, exclamative,\nand optative respectively. (P2a), because it retains an\nimperative, models better than (P2b) and (P2c)\nthe dispositions of moral sentences to evoke an audience's attitudes\nor behaviors. The latter two, containing instead an exclamative and\noptative respectively, models better than (P2a) the\ndispositions of moral sentences to express a speaker's attitudes,\nthough at the expense of evoking the audience's attitudes less\ndirectly than (P2a). (P2b), given its\nexclamative, which typically conveys an attitude more forcefully than\nan optative (with the possible exception of regret), models even\nbetter than (P2c) the disposition of moral sentences to\nexpress a speaker's attitudes and, thereby, better models the\ndispositions of moral sentences to evoke an audience's attitudes via\nthe “contagion of warmly expressed approval” (1944,\n22). In the models to follow, an exclamative rather than an imperative\nor optative is used to model the emotive features of ethical language. \nModels (P3a)–(P3c) rectify Problems 3-5 to\nsome degree, while suggesting additional complexity in the emotive\nelement. Each suggests that the descriptive element in ethical\nsentences is more complex and perhaps more vague, suggesting as they\ndo a more general description of an action, person, policy, etc. as\nexemplifying certain characteristics or properties, rather than the\nnarrower and more precise description of a speaker as exemplifying a\nspecific attitude. Thus, each allows that moral disagreement may be\ngrounded in disagreement in belief—e.g., Smith and Jones can use\n‘complimenting others is good’ and ‘complimenting\nothers is not good’ respectively as a means of disagreeing in\nbelief about whether complimenting others exemplifies property X (or Y\nor Z)—and, thereby, eliminates the implication that fully\njustifying a moral claim requires providing reasons for\nbelieving that a speaker has the particular attitude she is\ndescribed as having. In addition, the exclamative in (P3a)\nsuggests that the disposition of ethical sentences relates ethical\nterms in part to attitudes directed towards the object or\naction at issue. The exclamatives in (P3b) and\n(P3c), on the other hand, suggest that the dispositions of\nethical sentences relates ethical terms in part to attitudes directed\ntowards the characteristics or properties that an object or\naction might exemplify. \nStevenson's (P4), has a descriptive element that is more\nprecise than (P3a)–(P3b). It also removes\neven a model of the emotive element, leaving instead just a\ncharacterization to the effect that some emotive element is\npresent. Thus, unlike (P0a)–(P1), which\nplace the dispositional relations between ethical terms and\nattitudes—i.e., emotive meaning—front and center,\n(P4) instead places front and center the dispositional\nrelations between ethical terms and beliefs—i.e., descriptive\nmeaning.  (P4) thus captures the passive dispositions of\nethical terms to be used as a result of a speaker or writer's more\nspecific cognitive states about the properties or characteristics of\nan action, person, etc, and the terms’ active dispositions to\ncause such cognitive states in an audience. Perhaps the more\ndescriptive “thick” ethical terms, such as\n‘cruel’, ‘kind’, or ‘courageous’\nprovide the best examples of terms that possess such dispositions,\nthough these may be evident even when reflecting on “thin”\nethical terms, such as ‘good’ or\n‘right’. Consider, for example, an Aristotelian, Kantian,\nand Millian individually deliberating over whether a particular action\nor object is good, their respective deliberation and use of\n‘This is good’ guided, as they would be, by their beliefs\nabout whether the action or object under discussion exemplifies the\npromotion of a teleological end, a Good Will, or pleasure\nrespectively. \n\nReturning to (P0a)–(P0d), these rectify to some\ndegree an additional problem, one that encumbers all of\n(P1)–(P4). \n\nThe distinction between ‘strictly designates’ and ‘suggests’ is most\nplausibly understood as invoking the distinction between semantics and\npragmatics, or the distinction between that which is conveyed as a\nmatter of convention or as a matter of conversational\ndynamics: \nThe distinction which the question presupposes, that between what\n‘good’ means and what it suggests, is\noften beyond the precision of ordinary language. It is a distinction\nbetween descriptive dispositions of the term, one of which is\npreserved by linguistic rules and the other is not. In the rigorous\ndiscourse of science or mathematics, which avails itself of\ninterrelated sets of definitions or formal postulates, the distinction\nis readily made. In the rough contexts of daily life, however, a great\nmany rules are not stipulated, being imperfectly evident from people's\nlinguistic habits; and even those rules which are occasionally\nstipulated are not constantly followed. Certain rules, of course,\nare always observed; for ‘good’, whatever else,\nis ‘not bad’ and ‘not indifferent’. But many\nother rules remain as mere possibilities. If such a rule is\nspecifically called to a person's attention he may accept\nit—though usually only temporarily, for a given purpose. Not\nuntil a great many rules are permanently settled, though, do we get\nbeyond the undecided region that separates descriptive meaning from\nsuggestiveness. When rules are in the course of becoming\ngenerally accepted, there is a long period over which we may either\naccept or reject them without violence to conventional language. Our\ndecision may settle the matter for our own usage, and determine what\nis afterward to be called the term's descriptive meaning, and\nwhat is to be called its suggestiveness; but our finished product is\nby no means the same as the raw material. (1944, 86; see also\n1948a, 154–158; 1963b, 208–210) \n\nThus, Stevenson's distinction between ‘strictly designates’ and\n‘suggests’ is plausibly captured by the later Gricean distinction\nbetween that which is “said” or “conventionally implicated” on the one\nhand, and that which is “conversationally implicated” on the other\n(Grice 1975); or perhaps by the later Searlean distinction between that\nwhich is conveyed via the performance of a “direct” assertive\nillocutionary act on the one hand, and via an “indirect” assertive\nillocutionary act on the other (Searle, 1975). Models\n(P0a)–(P0d), then, are useful for reminding us\nthat the “strict” meaning of ethical terms may include only\nits emotive meaning; if so, however, its descriptive meaning is\nstrongly suggested and, thus, always remains in linguistic play.\n \nAll of these specific models, (P0a)–(P4),\nthus fall into two logical patterns: \n‘This is good’ means:\n \nwhere ‘x’ is to be instantiated by a term\ndenoting an action, person, policy, etc; ‘is D’\nis to be replaced by a set of descriptive predicates; and\n‘φ’ is to be either instantiated by an appropriate\nexclamative, optative, or imperative sentence, or replaced by a\ndescription of an emotive linguistic rule (as in\n(P4)). Instantiations of (G1) will model: (i)\nthe dispositional relations that obtain between ethical sentences and\npsychological states of belief and attitude; (ii) varying degrees of\ndescriptive precision; (iii) varying degrees of descriptive\ncomplexity; (iv) speaker-relativity of descriptive meaning; (v)\nvarying degrees of emotive force or directness; and (vi) varying\nobjects of attitude, whether actions, persons, etc, or any properties\nthese may exemplify. Instantiations of (G2) will model (i),\n(v), and (vi), and serve as a reminder that the descriptive meaning of\nethical language may be merely suggested by the use of ethical\nsentences, rather than a part of their conventional meanings. \n\nAn ethical problem is essentially constituted by disagreement or\nuncertainty in attitude, though it is often constituted by\ndisagreement or uncertainty in belief as well. Resolving an ethical\nproblem, therefore, requires coordinating attitudes, sometimes by\ncoordinating beliefs that causally affect those attitudes. Attitudes\nmay be coordinated by methods that do not involve the use of language;\nphysical force, bribery, and physical seduction are just a few\nnonlinguistic means of shaping and coordinating attitudes.  Stevenson,\nhowever, is interested only in linguistic methods of\ncoordinating attitudes, about which at least two questions can be\ndistinguished: (i) How can language be used (and how\nhas it been used) to coordinate attitudes? and (ii) How\nought language be used to coordinate attitudes? The latter is\nitself a normative question and thus falls outside the scope of\nStevenson's project. The former is a metaethical question and, thus,\nis that which Stevenson is most keen to answer. Stevenson categorizes\nlinguistic methods of coordinating attitudes as either\n“rational” or “nonrational.” Rational methods\nseek to shape or coordinate attitudes by using language to produce\nreasons; Stevenson thus calls the set of such methods, aptly enough,\n“Reason.” Nonrational methods seek to shape or coordinate\nattitudes by using language in ways other than the production of\nreasons; Stevenson calls this set of methods\n“Persuasion.” \nA reason, for Stevenson, is “any statement about\nany matter of fact which any speaker considers\nlikely to alter attitudes” (1944, 115). “Whether this\nreason will in fact support or oppose the judgment will depend,”\nStevenson says, “on whether the hearer believes it, and upon\nwhether if he does, it will actually make a difference to his\nattitudes; but it may conveniently be called a reason (though not\nnecessarily a ‘valid’ one) regardless of whether it is\naccepted or not” (1944, 115). Thus, a reason is a statement\nwhose content, if believed, is causally relevant to altering\nattitudes. About how beliefs may alter attitudes Stevenson\ncannot be precise, given the complexity of the phenomena. He does\nprovide a very general explanation, namely, that beliefs serve as\n“intermediaries” between attitudes, strengthening or\nweakening them by “disclosing new objects of favor or disfavor,\nin such a way that several attitudes act concurrently, with a mutual\nmodification of them all” (1944, 115; also see especially 1950,\n63–70). \nAlthough this explanation is quite general, Stevenson provides a\nplethora of examples throughout his work to clarify the variety of ways\nin which beliefs, in their intermediary roles, may serve to strengthen\nor weaken attitudes (1944, especially Chapters, V, VI, VIII). The\nexamples are divided into those in which beliefs can alter attitudes by\nbeing logically related to other beliefs and by being\npsychologically related to other beliefs. Consider\nexamples of the former kind in which reasons are deductively related to\nother beliefs in the sense that they call into question the truth of\none's judgments. Suppose that Smith disapproves of policies that\nwould weaken a person's sense of independence, but nevertheless claims\nthat providing for unemployment payments would be a good policy (1944,\n115–116). Assuming model (P1),\nSmith's claim is akin the claim “I approve of this policy; do so as\nwell.” In such a case, Jones might try to alter, or call into\nquestion, Smith's judgment that the policy is good by establishing the\nintermediary belief that receiving unemployment payments would weaken a\nperson's sense of independence. In this case, Jones introduces an\nintermediary belief that is likely to cause in Smith the belief ‘I\ndisapprove of this policy’, which logically contradicts Smith's\noriginal belief (according to (P1)). Similarly,\nassuming model (P3a), Smith's judgment is akin to the\nclaim “This policy (of receiving unemployment benefits) will not weaken\na person's sense of independence; hooray for this policy.” Again,\nJones might try to alter, or call into question, Smith's judgment that\nthe policy is good by establishing the intermediary, and logically\ncontradictory, belief that receiving unemployment payments would weaken\na person's sense of independence. In either case, Smith may alter\nher attitudes toward unemployment insurance and, hence, her judgment\nabout the policy. As a second example, consider a person\nA who claims that “it is always wrong to break a promise,”\nthough B points out to A that “there are many cases\nof that sort which you regard without the least disapproval”: \nB's reply is an empirical assertion, but note that it contradicts\nA's judgment (by the first pattern only, of course) and so is logically\nrelated to it. A must, in the interest of consistency, either\nreject B's assertion, or give up his ethical judgment [i.e., modify his\nattitude]. (He would be very likely to qualify his judgment,\nsaying merely that most instances of breaking promises are wrong.)\n(1944, 116) \n\nStevenson also identifies a number of ways that reasons can shape\nattitudes in virtue of being psychologically related to others'\nbeliefs. Consider, for example, cases in which reasons are\noffered pertaining to the consequences or nature of a proposed tax bill\n(1944, 118–119). One might try, for example, to mold an\nunfavorable attitude towards the bill by proffering as a reason to\noppose it that “it will put a great burden on the poor, and make little\ndifference to the rich” (1944, 119). In this case, the speaker\nuses as a reason to oppose the bill consequences towards which one is\nlikely to disapprove. (This example is closely related to the\nprevious example, but it does not directly call into question the truth\nof a belief someone already has.) Stevenson identifies other ways\nthat reasons can be psychologically related to a person's other beliefs\nor attitudes. Consider, for example, reasons that appeal to\nintentions, origin, or authority. Smith mentions that another's\nactions towards an elder friend “is admirable,” but Jones points out\nthat those actions are performed with the intention of getting the\nelder's inheritance; in this case, Jones makes a claim about the\nperson's intentions or motives, towards which she believes Smith will\nhave an unfavorable attitude and, thereby, will alter Smith's\nadmiration (1944, 121). Or perhaps Jones points out that the\ngeneral disapproval towards extramarital intercourse arose historically\nbecause of admirable attitudes towards a stable family life for\nchildren, but that such an origin no longer fits with current\ncircumstances that provide for widespread, effective birth control\n(1944, 123). In this case, Jones seeks to affect Smith's attitude\ntowards extramarital intercourse by pointing out the origin of that\nattitude and contrasting it with present circumstances. Or\nconsider a person who tries to shape attitudes by invoking an\nauthority. For example, Jones claims that our schools ought to\nemphasize the humanities because “‘To seek utility everywhere is\nentirely unsuited to men that are great-souled and free’ as Aristotle\nso wisely says” (1944, 125). In this case, Jones seeks to mold\nSmith's attitude towards favoring the promotion of the humanities by\nleveraging the extent to which Smith respects Aristotle as an authority\non educational matters. \nThus, ethical inquiry and deliberation often proceeds rationally by\npresenting reasons to be for or against something,\nreasons whose effectiveness is tied to their logical or psychological\nrelation to others' beliefs. \n\nNot all linguistic attempts to coordinate or settle attitudes are\nrational. Often, according to Stevenson, we attempt to mold\nattitudes by linguistic means other than the presentation of reasons. For\nexample, we often attempt to affect or coordinate attitudes merely by\ninvoking or stressing the purely emotive element of words, or perhaps\nby using metaphor, intonation, pleasantness of speech or rhythm, and\nthe like. These are all nonrational, but still linguistic,\nmethods of settling and coordinating attitudes that Stevenson calls\n“Persuasion”: \nThe most important of the nonrational methods will be called\n‘persuasive’ in a somewhat broad sense. It depends on the sheer,\ndirect emotional impact of words—on emotive meaning, rhetorical\ncadence, apt metaphor, stentorian, stimulating, or pleading tones of\nvoice, dramatic gestures, care in establishing rapport with\nthe hearer or audience, and so on. … A redirection of the\nhearer's attitudes is sought not by the mediating step of altering his\nbeliefs, but by exhortation, whether obvious or subtle, crude\nor refined. (1944, 139)  Consider as the first of several examples the many uses of thick\nethical terms, such as ‘courageous’ or\n‘democratic’. Often, we try to coordinate attitudes by\ninvoking these words more for their emotive meanings than for their\ndescriptive, especially when the descriptive meanings are taken for\ngranted. Saying that one acted in the face of fear may be\ndescriptively accurate; saying that one acted courageously, especially\nwhen all relevant parties already believe that one acted in the face\nof fear, is more likely an attempt to coordinate admiration among the\nparties. Consider also the persuasive strategy of repetition,\nespecially when terms are used repeatedly in question begging\nform. Smith says that Jones did the right thing; asked for a reason,\nSmith merely states that Jones's act was an instance of performing his\nduty, or that Jones had an obligation to do it. Here, Smith provides\nno reason at all, but merely attempts to coordinate positive attitudes\nby relying on the repeated effect of the emotive force of evaluative\nterms. For a different use of repetition, consider the persuasiveness\nof Martin Luther King, Jr.'s repetition of ‘I have a\ndream’ and ‘Let freedom ring’ during his “I\nHave a Dream” speech, delivered during the 1963 March on\nWashington. No doubt, Dr. King's speech was intended to shape\nattitudes in part by specifying various kinds of injustices, that is,\nby proffering reasons that, it was to be hoped, clashed logically with\nothers’ beliefs about the extension of freedom and equality; but\nthe impact of Dr. King's speech continues to be the persuasive,\nemotive power of his words and their delivery, including the\nlinguistic technique of repetition. For a wildly different example of\npersuasion, consider the power wielded by Jim Jones, who was so adept\nat building rapport with his followers that he was able to coordinate,\nthrough speech, the agreement among hundreds of followers to commit\nsuicide in protest “of an inhumane world” (Jones et\nal. 1978).  These are just a few examples in which persuasive\nlinguistic methods are used to shape and coordinate moral thought and,\nthereby, to resolve moral disagreement. \nPersuasive techniques, according to Stevenson, play a vital role in\nattempts to modify the standards of a society or group. At the\ncenter of such reform is the use of what Stevenson calls “persuasive\ndefinition,” or attempts to give “a new conceptual meaning to a\nfamiliar word without substantially changing its emotive meaning, and\nwhich is used with the conscious or unconscious purpose of changing, by\nthis means, the direction of people's interests” (1938b, 32).\nSuppose Smith recognizes that Jones has had little formal education and\nuses grammatically incorrect sentences and obvious literary references\nand, on this basis, claims that Jones is simply not a person of\n“culture.” Rodriguez agrees that Jones has such qualities but\nclaims that Jones is a person of culture notwithstanding, for “in the\ntrue and full sense of the term, ‘culture’ means imaginative\nsensitivity and originality,” and these qualities Jones\nhas in abundance:  It will be obvious that [Rodriguez], in defining\n‘culture’, was not simply introducing a convenient\nabbreviation, nor was he seeking to clarify ‘the’ common\nmeaning of the term. His purpose was to redirect [Smith's] attitudes,\nfeeling that [Smith] was insufficiently appreciative of their friend's\nmerits. ‘Culture’ had and would continue to have, for\npeople of their sort, a laudatory emotive meaning. The definition\nurged [Smith] to stop using the laudatory term to refer to grammatical\nniceties, literary allusions, and the rest, and to use it, instead, to\nrefer to imaginative sensitivity and originality. In this manner, it\nsought to place the former qualities in a relatively poor light, and\nthe latter in a fine one, and thus to redirect [Smith's]\nadmiration. When people learn to call something by a name rich in\nemotive meaning, they more readily admire it; and when they learn not\nto call it by such a name, they less readily admire it. The definition\nmade use of this fact. It sought to change attitudes by changing\nnames. (1944, 211–212; see also 1938b)  It is also possible to persuasively change the emotive meaning of\na term while retaining its descriptive meaning. Stevenson calls such\nattempts persuasive “quasi-definitions,” since he wants to\nreserve ‘definition’ for a statement of a word's\ndescriptive meaning only. Consider, for example, Simon Blackburn's\nrecent explicit attempt to persuasively quasi-define\n‘lust’ (2004). Lust is not a sin, suggests Blackburn, but\nrather a “delight of the mind”: \n(Lust) is not merely useful but essential. We would none of\nus be here without it. So the task I set myself is to clean off\nsome of the mud, to rescue it from the echoing denunciations of old men\nof the deserts, to deliver it from the pallid and envious confessors of\nRome, and the disgust of the Renaissance, to destroy the stocks and\npillories of the Puritans, to separate it from the other things that we\nknow drag it down … and so to lift it from the category of sin\nto that of virtue. (2004, 3)  Persuasive definitions and quasi-definitions, then, lie at the\nheart of much moral reform, whether for good or ill (1944,\n209–210). “The words are prizes,” Stevenson writes,\n“which each man seeks to bestow on the qualities of his own\nchoice” (1938b, 35). \n\nFor Stevenson, then, ethical inquiry or deliberation involve three\ngeneral sorts of linguistic methods for resolving moral disagreement or\nuncertainty: (i) rational, logical methods; (ii) rational,\npsychological methods; and (ii) persuasive methods. \n\nAt least nine objections have been leveled against Stevenson's\nemotivism over the years, some of which were first articulated by Brand\nBlanshard (1949). The objections fall within two categories, one\nrelated to Stevenson's theory of moral psychology, the other to his\ntheory of moral language. Though most of these objections\nultimately miss their mark against Stevenson, several serious\nobjections remain, including what is described below as the Objection\nfrom Motivational Judgment Internalism, the Frege-Geach Objection, and\nthe Objection from a Dispositional Theory of Meaning. \n\nStevenson holds that moral judgments or thoughts are essentially\nconstituted at least in part by affective attitudes, feelings, or\ninterests, those mental states whose general character is to be\nfor or against something. In this section,\n‘strong emotivism’ refers to this metaphysical view of moral\nthought. Several objections to Stevenson's theory arise from\nperceived implications of strong emotivism. \nObjection from Moral Properties. According to this\nobjection, if strong emotivism is true, then an event (person, action,\npolicy, institution, etc.) is bad (good, evil, etc.) only if a person\nhas an unfavorable attitude towards that event; however, having such an\nattitude (the objection goes) cannot be a necessary condition for an\nevent's being bad (good, evil, etc.). Consider, for example,\nBlanshard's example in which a rabbit has been caught in a severe\nhunting trap for several days, causing the rabbit unnecessary,\nprolonged, and extreme agony (1949). According to Blanshard's\nunderstanding of strong emotivism, until a person has an unfavorable\nattitude towards such an event or state of affairs, the rabbit's being\nin such agony would not be bad, for on this understanding of strong\nemotivism, an event cannot be bad unless and until someone has a\nnegative attitude towards that event. Since (the objection\ncontinues), this conclusion is absurd, Stevenson's theory of moral\nthought must be false. However, this objection conflates\nStevenson's theory of moral thought with a theory of moral properties,\nassuming as it does that having, for example, an unfavorable attitude\ntowards an event constitutes the badness of that event, at\nleast in part. But this is the kind of moral metaphysics that\nStevenson's theory is designed to avoid. According to Stevenson,\nthere is nothing that constitutes badness (or goodness, etc.), for on\nStevenson's view there are no such moral properties. Rather,\nhaving a negative attitude towards an event constitutes in part the\nthought that something is bad (good, etc), not badness\n(goodness, etc.) itself. \nObjection from Externalism.\n Section 2.3\ndescribes Stevenson's\n“Internalist” argument for strong emotivism. Blanshard objects to\nthis argument for reasons similar to those discussed in that\nsection. Consider a person who thinks, with great contempt, that\nunnecessary, prolonged, extreme agony is bad and claims repeatedly that it\nis bad, still repeating the claim even a week later though fatigue has\ndissipated all contempt: \nWhen we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing, the\nfeeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing\npoint, but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before,\nwe should certainly answer Yes. We should say that we made our\npoint with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second\ntime, but that it was the same point we were making. And if we\nsee that what we meant to say remains the same, while the feeling\nvaries from intensity to near zero, it is not the feeling that we\nprimarily meant to express. (1949, 45) \n\nThat is, it appears plausible that a person can think over time that a\ncertain event is bad, even though the attitude or feeling with which\none judged the event as bad has partially or even completely\ndissipated over that time frame. However, were strong emotivism\ntrue, such a thing would be impossible, and thus strong emotivism is\nlikely false. As discussed in\n Section 2.3,\nobjections of this kind\nprovide one of the more serious challenges to Stevenson's emotivism. \nObjection from Rational Irresolvability. According to\nthis objection, if strong emotivism is true, then there can be no\nobjective moral truth, no rational criticism of one's moral judgments,\nno rationally resolvable moral disagreement. For according to\nstrong emotivism, the moral judgment that something is bad (good, etc)\njust is in part having a negative attitude towards that thing, and\nattitudes, feelings, or interests are not rationally governable.\nThis objection has a strong and a weak version. The strong\nversion argues that attitudes cannot be, and hence are never,\nrationally governable. This objection misses its mark against\nStevenson, for as we saw in\n Sections 2.2\nand\n 4.2,\nStevenson goes to great lengths to show\nhow attitudes can be, and in fact often are, rationally governable (see\nespecially 1950, 63–70; 1961–62b). That is, attitudes can be and\noften are settled, shaped, or coordinated by the presentation of\nreasons that are logically or psychologically related by means of\nintermediary beliefs. The weak version argues that attitudes, in\nprinciple, may sometimes be rationally ungovernable. Stevenson\nhimself admits that this might be the case (e.g., 1944, 336). From\nthis admission, however, some have been tempted to argue for the next,\nradically different, objection. \nObjection from Moral Chaos. If attitudes may sometimes\nbe rationally ungovernable, then moral disagreement may sometimes be\nrationally irresolvable. However, if moral disagreement may\nsometimes be rationally irresolvable, then (this objection goes) moral\nchaos is likely to ensue. Taking this objection to heart,\nBlanshard goes as far as to claim that “[The general acceptance of\nstrong emotivism] would, so far as one can see, be an international\ndisaster” (1949). Stevenson could respond that even if the\npossibility of rational irresolvability could lead to such chaos, such\nan objection would not constitute a theoretical objection to his theory\nof moral thought. That is, the objection does not imply that\nStevenson's theory of moral thought is false. Stevenson, however,\nresponds directly to the challenge, arguing that such an objection\narises from fear that cannot be assuaged by postulating some objective\ntruth or robust moral properties awaiting to be discovered (e.g., 1944,\n336 and 1950, 68–70). Rather, such fear can be assuaged only when\nwe have a clear, realistic understanding of the nature and complexity\nof moral disagreement and of the methods by which they can be, and\noften are, resolved: \nThe present analysis can afford no assurance that dictators and\nself-seeking politicians, whose skill in exhortation is so manifest,\n‘inevitably must” fail, if left unopposed, in reshaping\nmoral codes to serve their narrow interests. … But this much\nmust be said: Those who cherish altruism, and look forward to a time\nwhen a stable society will be governed by farsighted men, will serve\nthese ideals poorly by turning from present troubles to fancied\nrealms.  For these ideals, like all other attitudes, are not imposed\nupon human nature by esoteric forces; they are a part of human nature\nitself. If they are to become a more integral part of it, they must be\nfought for. They must be fought for with the words ‘right’\nand ‘wrong’, else these attitude-molding weapons will be\nleft to the use of opponents. And they must be supported with\nclear-minded reasons, else hypostatic obscurantism will bring\ncontempt to the cause it is intended to plead. (1944, 110; see\nalso 1961–62b) \n\nObjections also arise from considerations of the view that moral\nlanguage is conventionally used at least in part to express or evoke\naffective attitudes rather than or in addition to describing or\nreporting. \nObjection from Empty Expression. According to this objection,\nif strong emotivism is true, then a speaker who utters, for example,\n‘That's bad’ as a means of expressing her moral judgment,\nbut without having any negative attitude towards what is referred to,\nhas “expressed nothing.” Such an utterance is, says\nBlanshard, “as empty as the word ‘Hurrah’ would be\nwhen there was no enthusiasm behind it” (1949). This objection\nfails to distinguish sincere from insincere speech acts. Consider, for\nexample, a speaker who knowingly lies by uttering the sentence\n‘Smith is home’.  Intuitively, the speaker has expressed\nthe belief that Smith is home, even though by hypothesis she lies and,\nthus, fails to have that belief. The reason is that it is a plausible\ncondition of sincere assertion that a person who asserts that p\nbelieve that p; but one could certainly assert that p without\nbelieving that p.  Analogously, a speaker who utters\n‘Hurrah’ intuitively expresses enthusiasm, since it is a\nplausible condition of sincere expression that a person who utters\n‘Hurrah!’ be enthusiastic. But one could certainly utter\n‘Hurrah!’ to express enthusiasm while remaining\nunenthused. Likewise, Stevenson would respond, a speaker may be\nunaffected and, thereby, insincere in uttering ‘That's\nbad’, though she would still thereby express an unfavorable\nattitude via her utterance. \nObjections from Illocutionary/Perlocutionary\nConflation. Stevenson claims repeatedly that moral language is\nused to express a speaker's attitudes or interests or to evoke or\notherwise shape the attitudes or interests of others.  The Objection\nfrom Illocutionary/Perlocutionary Conflation argues that these two\nclaims—that moral language is used to express the attitudes of\nspeakers, and that moral language is used to evoke or alter the\nattitudes of an audience—conflate illocutionary acts and\nperlocutionary intentions (e.g., Hare 1952 Section 1.7 and 1997\nSections 1–5–1.6; Urmson 1968). Illocutionary acts are the\nacts that a speaker performs in uttering a sentence: warning,\nadvising, describing, directing or commanding, asking, expressing and\nso on. Like sentences, illocutionary acts are subject to logical\nconstraints—it would be logically inconsistent, in some\nintuitive sense, to direct one's hearer to both close and open a\nparticular window (‘Close that window and open that same\nwindow’), for example, or to express both gratitude and\nannoyance towards the cleaning of one's room (‘Thank you for\ncleaning the room and shame on you for cleaning the room!’).\nSince sentences and the illocutionary acts they are typically used to\nperform have similar logical constraints, illocutionary acts may\nplausibly be associated in some appropriate way with the semantics or\nmeanings of sentences. Now when a speaker performs an illocutionary\nact in uttering a sentence, she often does so with particular\nintentions or effects in mind. For example, knowing that her audience\noften attempts to annoy her by doing the opposite of what she asks, a\nspeaker may utter ‘Keep the window closed’ with the\nintention that her audience will in fact open the window. Thus, there\nneed be no logical inconsistency between directing one to\nkeep a particular window closed and an intention that the window be\nopened. Thus, it is concluded, perlocutionary intention ought not be\nassociated with the semantics or meanings of sentences. The Objection\nfrom Illocutionary/Perlocutionary Conflation, then, is that\nStevenson's theory of meaning incorporates that which is irrelevant to\nsemantics, namely perlocutionary intentions. This objection is related\nto the next.\n \nThe Objection from Instrumentalism. Even if Stevenson's\nclaims about perlocutionary intentions are ignored, it remains\n(according to this objection) that Stevenson's theory of meaning is,\nat bottom, an instrumental or use theory of meaning, since it is a\ntheory that explains the meaning of moral sentences by appealing to\nthe illocutionary acts they are typically used to perform, that is, to\ntheir typical illocutionary forces. However, a great many uses of\nmoral sentences fail to have such force. For example, when moral\nsentence 1 is used in utterances of sentences 2 or 3, it is used\nwithout its usual expressive force. \n\nThus, the objection goes, Stevenson's theory of meaning leaves too\nmuch unsaid about a great many uses of ethical language, and\nconsequently, is radically incomplete. \nThese last two objections are understandable, given how often Stevenson\nappeals to the uses and purposes of moral language. Nevertheless,\nthey miss their mark, for Stevenson's theory of meaning is not a “use”\nor “tool” theory of meaning, but rather a dispositional theory of\nmeaning\n (Section 3.2; Urmson 1968, Ch. 4; Warnock 1978, Ch. 3).\nThus, Stevenson associates the meaning of a word or\nsentence with neither perlocutionary intentions nor with illocutionary\nforce, but rather with the conjunction or union of its passive and\nactive dispositions—its passive dispositions to be used to\nexpress a speaker's mental states and its active dispositions\nto evoke mental states of a speaker's audience. \nThe Frege-Geach Objection. Because Stevenson's theory is\noften thought to succumb to the Objection from Instrumentalism, it is\nalso thought to succumb to the Frege-Geach Objection, perhaps the most\npressing objection to any emotivist or expressivist theory of\nmeaning. This objection is so-called because Peter Geach (1958,\n1960, 1965), relying on insights from Frege (e.g., 1918), argued\npersuasively that a sentence's illocutionary force cannot constitute\nits meaning. The strength of the Frege-Geach Objection arises\nfrom the fact that natural languages are compositional and, thus, that\na minimal condition of adequacy on any semantic theory is that it\nspecify that which sentences contribute to the more complex sentences\ninto which they are embeddable. For example, a minimally adequate\nsemantic theory for English will entail that the meaning of sentence 1.\nremains the same when it is embedded within sentences 2. or 3., since\nan understanding of the latter sentences rests on an understanding of\ntheir respective parts, including 1., and of the significance of the\nway those parts are combined. However, since (it is thought)\nStevenson's theory of meaning holds that moral sentences are used to\nexpress a speaker's attitudes—i.e., used with expressive illocutionary\nforce—and since moral sentences are often used as parts of more\ncomplex sentences without such expressive force, as in sentences 2. and\n3., Stevenson has failed to provide a minimally adequate theory of\nmeaning for moral sentences.\n \n\nThe Frege-Geach objection may ultimately undermine Stevenson's theory\nof moral language, though not, as just discussed, because his theory\nis a “use” or “tool” theory of meaning that\nidentifies a sentence's meaning with the illocutionary force of its\nutterance or with the perlocutionary intentions of its\nspeaker. Associating a sentence's meaning instead with the set of its\npassive and active dispositions, Stevenson's theory of meaning implies\nthat sentences will have relatively stable meanings across contexts of\nuse\n (Sections 3.1\nand\n 3.2),\nand therefore, that\nthese dispositions might themselves be contributed to the more complex\nsentences into which they embed. Precisely how Stevenson's\ndispositional theory could be extended to account for compositionality\nin this way is unclear, and Stevenson himself appears never to have\nbeen sufficiently worried by the Frege-Geach objection to respond to\nit. One idea would be that sentential operators, such as ‘if\n… then’ and ‘it is possible that’ be treated as functions from\nthe dispositions of the component sentences to a resulting set of\ndispositions, where the latter would constitute the meaning of the\ncomplex sentence. Stevenson hints at such a possible extension of\nhis theory while discussing the compositionality of atomic\nsentences: \nNo attempt has been made here to deal with one of the most difficult\nproblems that meaning-theory includes—that of explaining how\nseparate words, each one with its own meaning, can combine to yield\nsentence-meanings. It is feasible, perhaps, to take each word as\nhaving a disposition to affect cognition, just as the full sentence\ndoes. The problem reduces, then, to one of explaining the interplay of\nthe dispositions of the several words, when realized conjointly. The\nanalogy of the magnets will still serve, used now to illustrate the\nrelationship of meanings rather than of beliefs. We\nmay compare the meaning of each word with the disposition of some one\nof the magnets, and compare the meaning of the sentence with the\ndisposition that may be assigned to the group of magnets. Each word\nhas an independent meaning in the sense that if it is replaced by\ncertain others in any context, there will be a typical sort of\ndifference in the meaning of the context; but the precise way in which\nthe word's meaning is realized will depend on the meaning of the other\nwords that accompany it. (1944, 67) \n\nSince Stevenson suggests that he might explain the compositionality of\natomic sentences in terms of functions from the dispositions of a\nsentence's parts to a set of resulting dispositions, it is plausible\nthat he might also wish to extend his theory in a similar way to explain the\ncompositionality of complex sentences. Whether such a theory\ncould sustain additional scrutiny is debatable. For more in-depth\nbut accessible discussion of emotivist and expressivist attempts to\nrespond to the Frege-Geach Objection, see especially Schroeder 2008a\nand 2008b and the entry on \n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.\n \n\nObjection from General Dispositional Theories.\nStevenson's is a dispositional theory of meaning. As explained\nin\n Section 2.2,\nhis\nis also a dispositional theory of mental states. As such,\nStevenson's emotivism inherits challenges that accrue to most kinds of\ndispositional theories. For an accessible discussion of the\nmerits and demerits of dispositional theories, see the entry on \n dispositions. \n\nStevenson remains a central figure in current day metaethics, a\nresult of his development of at least four key ideas: \n\nThese four ideas remain central to current day expressivists, such\nas Blackburn (1984, 1993) and Gibbard (1990, 2003), whose work arises\nespecially from ideas 1–3. Indeed, the title of Gibbard 1990,\nWise Choices, Apt Feelings, suggests all three ideas.\nCurrent day hybrid expressivists, such as Stephen Barker (2002), Daniel\nBoisvert (2008), David Copp (2001, 2009), and Michael Ridge (2006,\n2007, 2014), hold that moral language is used conventionally to express both\nbeliefs and attitudes and, thereby, continue to develop in different\nways Stevenson's idea that moral sentences have both emotive and\ndescriptive meaning (Fletcher and Ridge 2014).","contact.mail":"DanBoisvert@uncc.edu","contact.domain":"uncc.edu"}]
