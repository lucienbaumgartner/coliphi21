Do they exist independently of the things\nand processes in them? Or is their existence parasitic on these things\nand processes? Are they like a canvas onto which an artist paints;\nthey exist whether or not the artist paints on them? Or are they akin\nto parenthood; there is no parenthood until there are parents and\nchildren? That is, is there no space and time until there are things\nwith spatial properties and processes with temporal durations?\n\n\n\nThese questions have long been debated and continue to be debated.\nThe hole argument arose when these questions were asked in the context\nof modern spacetime physics. In that context, space and time are fused\ninto a single entity, spacetime, and we inquire into its status. One\nview is that spacetime is a substance, a thing that exists\nindependently of the processes occurring within spacetime. This is\nspacetime substantivalism. The hole argument seeks to show that this\nviewpoint leads to unpalatable conclusions in a large class of\nspacetime theories. Spacetime substantivalism requires that we ascribe\nsuch a surfeit of properties to spacetime that neither observation nor\neven the laws of the relevant spacetime theory itself can determine\nwhich are the correct ones. Such abundance is neither logically\ncontradictory nor refuted by experience. But there must be some bounds\non how rich a repertoire of hidden properties can be ascribed to\nspacetime. The hole argument urges that spacetime substantivalism goes\nbeyond those bounds.\n\n\n The hole argument depends upon a gauge freedom in general relativity;\nthat is, the presence of surplus mathematical structure in general\nrelativity that has no correlate in physical reality. The hole\nargument provides a template for the analysis of gauge freedoms in\nphysical theories. We learn from it that the identification of surplus\nmathematical structure cannot be achieved by any a priori or purely\nmathematical rule. Some physical grounds are needed. The hole argument\nprovides two grounds that can be used: verifiability—changes\nin the candidate surplus structure make no difference to what can be\nverified in observation; determinism—the laws of the theory\nare unable to fix the candidate surplus structure.  \n\n\n\nThe hole argument was invented for slightly different purposes by\nAlbert Einstein late in 1913 as part of his quest for the general\ntheory of relativity. It was revived and reformulated in the modern\ncontext by John3 = John Earman × John Stachel × John\nNorton.\n\nSee Stachel (2014) for a review that covers the historical aspects\nof the hole argument and its significance in philosophy and\nphysics. It is written at a technically more advanced level than this\narticle.\n\nVirtually all modern spacetime theories are now built in the same\nway.  The theory posits a manifold of events and then assigns further\nstructures to those events to represent the content of spacetime. A\nstandard example is Einstein’s general theory of relativity. As a host\nfor the hole argument, we will pursue one of its best known\napplications, the expanding universes of modern relativistic\ncosmology. \n This one example illustrates the core content of the hole\nargument. With only a little further effort, the argument can be made\nmore precise and general. This will be done concurrently in these\n notes,[1]\n intended for readers with some background in differential geometry and\ngeneral relativity. \n Here are the two, basic building blocks of modern, relativistic\ncosmology: a manifold of events and the fields defined on it. \n  Manifold of Events. Consider our universe, which\nrelativistic cosmologies attempt to model. Its spacetime is the\nentirety of all space through all time. The events of this spacetime\nare generalizations of the dimensionless points of ordinary spatial\ngeometry.  A geometric point in ordinary spatial geometry is just a\nparticular spot in the space and has no extension.  Correspondingly,\nan event in spacetime is a particular point in a cosmological space at\na particular moment of time. \nSo far, all we have defined is a set of events. To be a\nfour-dimensional manifold, the set of events must be a little bit more\norganized. In a real spacetime, we have the idea that each event sits\nin some local neighborhood of events; and this neighborhood sits\ninside a larger neighborhood of events; and so on. That extra\norganization comes from the requirement that we can smoothly label the\nevents with four numbers—or at least we can do this for any\nsufficiently small chunk of the manifold. These labels form coordinate\nsystems. The fact that four numbers are just sufficient to label the\nevents makes the manifold four-dimensional. We can now pick out\nneighborhoods of some event as the set of all points whose spacetime\ncoordinates differ from our starting event by at most one unit; or two\nunits; or three units; etc.. That gives us the nestling neighborhoods\nof events.  Figure 1 illustrates how a set of events may be made into\na two dimensional manifold by assigning “x” and\n“y” coordinates to the events. \n \n Figure 1. Forming a manifold of events\n \n Metrical Structure and Matter Fields. In specifying\nthat events form a four dimensional manifold, there is still a lot we\nhave not said about the events. We have not specified which\nevents lie in the future and past of which other events, how much time\nelapses between these events, which events are simultaneous with\nothers so that they can form three dimensional spaces, what spatial\ndistances separates these events and many more related\nproperties.  \n These additional properties are introduced by specifying the metric\nfield. To see how this field provides that information, imagine all\nthe curves connecting all pairs of events in spacetime. The\ninformation about times elapsed and spatial distances is given by the\ntimes elapsed and distances along all of these curves. See Figure\n2: \n \n Figure 2. The function of the metric field.\n  \n That information could be supplied by a huge catalog that specifies\nthe spatial or temporal distance between every pair of events along\nevery curve connecting them. Such a huge catalog would be massively\nredundant, however. If we know the distance from A to\nB and from B to C along some curve, then we\nknow the distance from A to C as well. The minimum\ninformation we need is the temporal and spatial distance between each\nevent and all those (loosely speaking) infinitesimally close to it. That\ninformation is what the metric field provides. It is a “field” since\nthat information belongs just to one event. We can then piece together\ntemporal and spatial distance along any curve just by summing all the\ndistances between successive infinitesimally close points along the\ncurve. \n\nThe matter of the universe is represented by matter fields. The\nsimplest form of matter—the big lumps that make \ngalaxies—can be represented by worldlines that trace out the history of\neach galaxy through time. In standard models, the galaxies recede from\none another and this is represented by a spreading apart of the\ngalactic worldlines as we proceed to later times. See Figure 3: \n\nWhen Einstein first introduced his general theory of relativity in the\n1910s, its novel feature was its general covariance. It was the first\nspacetime theory in which one was free to use arbitrary spacetime\ncoordinate systems.  This feature is now shared by virtually all\nmodern formulations of spacetime theories, including modern versions\nof special relativity and Newtonian spacetime theory.  In its original\nform, general covariance was understood “passively”; that is, as a\nfreedom to describe structures in spacetime by means of arbitrarily\nchosen coordinate systems. That freedom proves to be equivalent to\nanother freedom, known as “active” general covariance.  According to\nactive general covariance, we are licensed to spread geometrical\nstructures like metrical fields over the manifold in as many different\nways as there are coordinate transformations. (For a more extensive\naccount of the relationship between active and passive covariance, see\nthe Supplementary Document:\n Active and Passive Covariance.)[2] \n The exercising of this freedom is the essential manipulation of the  \nhole argument. Figure 4 illustrates one way that we might spread the  \nmetrical structure and matter fields over the manifold of spacetime  \nevents: \n \n Figure 4. One way to spread metric and matter over the manifold.\n \nFigure 5 illustrates a second way: \n \n Figure 5. Another way to spread metric and matter over the manifold.\n  \n We shall call the transformation between the two spreadings a “hole\ntransformation.” The dotted region is The Hole. The first distribution\nof metric and matter fields is transformed into the second in a way\nthat \n The two different spreadings share one vital characteristic upon\nwhich the hole argument depends: the two spreadings agree completely\non all invariant properties.  \n These invariant properties are, loosely speaking, the ones that are\nintrinsic to the geometry and dynamics, such as distance along spatial\ncurves and time along worldlines of galaxies, the rest mass of the\ngalaxy, the number of particles in it, as well as a host of other\nproperties, such as whether the spacetimes are metrically flat or\ncurved. \n The invariant properties are distinguished from non-invariant\nproperties. Best known of the non-invariant properties are those\ndependent on a particular choice of coordinate system. For example,\njust one event in a two-dimensional Euclidean space lies at the origin\nof coordinate system, that is, at x=0, y=0. But\nwhich event that is, changes when we change our coordinate system. So\n“being at the origin” is not an invariant. The spatial distance\nbetween two points, however, is that same no matter coordinate system\nis used to describe the space. It is an invariant. \n While the fields are spread differently in the two cases, they agree\nin all invariant properties; so, in invariant terms, they are the\nsame.   \n This last result actually explains the prevalence of general\ncovariance. The laws of a spacetime theory are typically stated as\nrelations between invariant properties. Therefore if they are\nsatisfied by one spacetime, they must also be satisfied by a transform\nof that spacetime that shares all the original’s invariant geometric\nproperties. \n There is a special relationship between the invariants of a spacetime\ntheory and its observables, those quantities which are accessible to\nobservational verification:  \n For example, if one makes a journey from one galaxy to another, all\nobservables pertinent to the trip will be invariants. These include\nthe time elapsed along the journey, whether the spaceship is\naccelerating or not at any time in its journey, the age of the galaxy\none leaves at the start of the trip and the age of the destination\ngalaxy at the end and all operations that may involve signaling with\nparticles or light pulses. \n Therefore, since the two spreadings or distributions of metric and\nmatter fields of a hole transformation agree on invariants, they also\nagree on all observables. They are observationally\nindistinguishable. \n Recall our original concern: we want to know whether we can conceive\nof spacetime as a substance, that is, as something that exists\nindependently. To do this, we need to know what in the above\nstructures represents spacetime. One popular answer to that question\nis that the manifold of events represents spacetime. We shall see\nshortly that this popular form of the answer is the one that figures\nin the hole argument. This choice is natural since modern spacetime\ntheories are built up by first positing a manifold of events and then\ndefining further structures on them. So the manifold plays the role of\na container just as we expect spacetime\n does.[4] \n One might wonder if this is the right choice, given that it excludes\nthe metric field, which contains important information on spatial\ndistances and times elapsed. Ought that not also to be considered a\npart of the containing spacetime as opposed to what is contained\nwithin spacetime?   \n General relativity makes it hard to view the metric field simply as\npart of the containing spacetime. For, in addition to spatial and\ntemporal information, the metric field also represents the\ngravitational field. Therefore it also carries energy and\nmomentum—the energy and momentum of the gravitational field\n(although a notorious technical problem in general relativity\nprecludes identifying the energy and momentum density of the\ngravitational field at any particular event in spacetime). This energy\nand momentum is freely interchanged with other matter fields in\nspacetimes. It is the source of the huge quantities of energy released\nas radiation and heat in stellar collapse, for example. To carry\nenergy and momentum is a natural distinguishing characteristic of\nmatter contained within spacetime. So the metric field of general\nrelativity seems to defy easy characterization. We would like it to be\nexclusively part of spacetime the container, or exclusively part of\nmatter the contained. Yet it seems to be part of both. \n The notion that the manifold represents an independently existing\nthing is quite natural in the realist view of physical theories. In\nthat view one tries to construe physical theories literally. If\nformulated as above, a spacetime is a manifold of events with certain\nfields defined on the manifold. The literal reading is that this\nmanifold is an independently existing structure that bears\nproperties. \n So far we have characterized the substantivalist doctrine as the view\nthat spacetime has an existence independent of its contents. This\nformulation conjures up powerful if vague intuitive pictures, but it\nis not clear enough for interpretation in the context of physical\ntheories. If we represent spacetime by a manifold of events, how do we\ncharacterize the independence of its existence? Is it the\ncounterfactual claim that were there no metric or matter fields, there\nwould still be a manifold of events? That counterfactual is\nautomatically denied by the standard formulation which posits that all\nspacetimes have at least metrical structure. That seems too cheap a\nrefutation of manifold substantivalism. Surely, there must be an\nimproved formulation. Fortunately, we do not need to wrestle with\nfinding it. For present purposes we need only consider a consequence\nof the substantivalist view and can set aside the task of giving a\nprecise formulation of the substantivalist view. \n In their celebrated debate over space and time, Leibniz taunted the\nsubstantivalist Newton’s representative, Clarke, by asking how the\nworld would change if East and West were switched. For Leibniz there\nwould be no change since all spatial relations between bodies would be\npreserved by such a switch. But the Newtonian substantivalist had to\nconcede that the bodies of the world were now located in different\nspatial positions, so the two systems were physically distinct. \n Correspondingly, when we spread the metric and matter fields\ndifferently over a manifold of events, we are now assigning metrical\nand material properties in different ways to the events of the\nmanifold. For example, imagine that a galaxy passes through some event\nE in the hole. After the hole transformation, this galaxy might not\npass through that event. For the manifold substantivalist, this must\nbe a matter of objective physical fact: either the galaxy passes\nthrough E or not. The two distributions represent two physically\ndistinct possibilities. \n That is, manifold substantivalists must deny an equivalence inspired\nby Leibniz’ taunt and is thus named after\n him:[5] \n The supplementary document \n  illustrates the essential idea of Leibniz equivalence through an\nanalogy with different map projections of the Earth’s surface. \n\nWe can now assemble the pieces above to generate unhappy consequences\nfor the manifold substantivalist. Consider the two distributions of\nmetric and matter fields related by a hole transformation. Since the\nmanifold substantivalist denies Leibniz equivalence, the\nsubstantivalist must hold that the two systems represent distinct\nphysical systems. But the properties that distinguish the two are very\nelusive. They escape both (a) observational verification and (b) the\ndetermining power of cosmological theory.  \n (a) Observational verification.  We have already noticed\nthat the two distributions are observationally equivalent.  So the\nsubstantivalist must insist that it makes a physical difference as to\nwhether the galaxy passes through event E or not. But no\nobservation can tell us if we are in a world in which the galaxy\npasses through event E or misses event E, for\nuniverses with either are observationally equivalent. \n It might be a little hard to see from Figure 6 that the two\ndistributions are observationally equivalent. In the first\ndistribution on the left, the middle galaxy moves in what looks like a\nstraight line and stays exactly at the spatial midpoint between the\ngalaxies on either side. In the second distribution on the right, all\nthat seems to be undone. The galaxy looks like it accelerates in\ntaking a swerve to the right, so that it moves closer to the galaxy on\nits right. \n These differences that show up in the portrayal of Figure 6 are all\nnon-invariant differences. For the right hand distribution, the galaxy\ndoes veer to the right in the figure, but at the same time, distances\nbetween events get stretched as well, just as they get stretched in\nthe various map projections shown in the supplement,\n Visualizing Leibniz Equivalence Through Map Projections.\n So the galaxy always remains at the spatial midpoint of the galaxies\non either side; it just doesn’t look like it is at the spatial\nmidpoint from the way the figure is drawn. \n Similarly, an acceleration vector along the galaxy’s worldline\ndetermines whether the galaxy is accelerating. That acceleration\nvector is an invariant. So, if the galaxy in the left hand\ndistribution has a zero acceleration vector, then the corresponding\ngalaxy in the right hand distribution will also have a zero\nacceleration vector. Remember, a hole transformation preserves\ninvariants. So if a galaxy is unaccelerated in the left hand\ndistribution, it is also unaccelerated in the right hand\ndistibution. \n (b) Determinism. The physical theory of relativistic\ncosmology is unable to pick between the two cases. This is manifested\nas an indeterminism of the theory. We can specify the distribution of\nmetric and matter fields throughout the manifold of events, excepting\nwithin the region designated as The Hole. Then the theory is unable to\ntell us how the fields will develop into The Hole. Both the original\nand the transformed distribution are legitimate extensions of the\nmetric and matter fields outside The Hole into The Hole, since each\nsatisfies all the laws of the theory of relativistic cosmology. The\ntheory has no resources which allow us to insist that one only is\nadmissible. \n\nIt is important to see that the unhappy consequence does not consist\nmerely of a failure of determinism. We are all too familiar with such\nfailures and it is certainly not automatic grounds for dismissal of a\nphysical theory. The best known instance of a widely celebrated,\nindeterministic theory is quantum theory, where, in the standard\ninterpretation, the measurement of a system can lead to an\nindeterministic collapse onto one of many possible outcomes. Less well\nknown is that it is possible to devise indeterministic systems in\nclassical physics as well. Most examples involves oddities such as\nbodies materializing at unbounded speed from spatial infinity, so\ncalled “space invaders.” (Earman, 1986a, Ch. III; see also\n determinism: causal)\n Or they may arise through the interaction of infinitely many bodies\nin a supertask\n (Supertasks.)\n More recently an extremely simple example has emerged in which a\nsingle mass sits atop a dome and spontaneously sets itself into motion\nafter an arbitrary time delay and in an arbitrary direction (Norton,\n2003, Section 3). \n The problem with the failure of determinism in the hole argument is\nnot the fact of failure but the way that it fails. If we deny manifold\nsubstantivalism and accept Leibniz equivalence, then the indeterminism\ninduced by a hole transformation is eradicated. While there are\nuncountably many mathematically distinct developments of the fields\ninto the hole, under Leibniz Equivalence, they are all physically the\nsame. That is, there is a unique development of the physical fields\ninto the hole after all. Thus the indeterminism is a direct product of\nthe substantivalist viewpoint. Similarly, if we accept Leibniz\nequivalence, then we are no longer troubled that the two distributions\ncannot be distinguished by any possible observation. They are merely\ndifferent mathematical descriptions of the same physical reality and\nso should agree on all observables. \n We can load up any physical theory with superfluous, phantom\nproperties that cannot be fixed by observation. If their invisibility\nto observation is not sufficient warning that these properties are\nillegitimate, finding that they visit indeterminism onto a theory that\nis otherwise deterministic in this set-up ought to be warning enough.\nThese properties are invisible to both observation and theory; they\nshould be discarded along with any doctrine that requires their\nretention. \n\nIn sum the hole argument amounts to\n this:[6] \n\nThe hole argument was created by Albert Einstein late in 1913 as an\nact of desperation when his quest for his general theory of relativity\nhad encountered what appeared to be insuperable obstacles. Over the\nprevious year, he had been determined to find a gravitation theory\nthat was generally covariant, that is, whose equations were unchanged\nby arbitrary transformation of the spacetime coordinates. He had even\nconsidered essentially the celebrated, generally covariant equations\nhe would settle upon in November 1915 and which now appear in all the\ntext books. \n\nUnfortunately Einstein had been unable to see that these equations\nwere admissible. Newton’s theory of gravitation worked virtually\nperfectly for weak gravitational fields. So it was essential that\nEinstein’s theory revert to Newton’s in that case. But try as he\nmight, Einstein could not see that his equations and many variants of\nthem could properly mesh with Newton’s theory. In mid 1913 he\npublished a compromise: a sketch of a relativistic theory of\ngravitation that was not generally covariant. (For further details of\nthese struggles, see Norton (1984).) \n\nHis failure to find an admissible generally covariant theory troubled\nEinstein greatly. Later in 1913 he sought to transform his failure\ninto a victory of sorts: he thought he could show that no generally\ncovariant theory at all is admissible. Any such theory would violate\nwhat he called the Law of Causality—we would now call it\ndeterminism. He sought to demonstrate this remarkable claim with the\nhole argument. \n\nIn its original incarnation, Einstein considered a spacetime filled\nwith matter excepting one region, the hole, which was matter free. (So\nin this original form, the term “hole” makes more sense than in the\nmodern version.) He then asked if a full specification of both metric\nand matter fields outside the hole would fix the metric field within.\nSince he had tacitly eschewed Leibniz Equivalence, Einstein thought\nthat the resulting negative answer sufficient to damn all generally\ncovariant theories. \n\nEinstein struggled on for two years with his misshapen theory of\nlimited covariance. Late in 1915, as evidence of his errors mounted\ninexorably, Einstein was driven to near despair and ultimately\ncapitulation. He returned to the search for generally covariant\nequations with a new urgency, fueled in part by the knowledge that\nnone other than David Hilbert had thrown himself into analysis of his\ntheory. Einstein’s quest came to a happy close in late November 1915\nwith the completion of his theory in generally covariant form. \n\nFor a long time it was thought that Hilbert had beaten Einstein by 5\ndays to the final theory. New evidence in the form of the proof pages\nof Hilbert’s paper now suggests he may not have. More important, it\nshows clearly that Hilbert, like Einstein, at least temporarily\nbelieved that the hole argument precluded all generally covariant\ntheories and that the belief survived at least as far as the proof\npages of his paper. (See Corry, Renn and Stachel 1997.) \n\nWhile Einstein had tacitly withdrawn his objections to generally\ncovariant theories, he had not made public where he thought the hole\nargument failed. This he finally did when he published what John\nStachel calls the “point-coincidence argument.” This argument, well\nknown from Einstein’s (1916, p.117) review of his general theory of\nrelativity, amounts to a defense of Leibniz equivalence. He urges that\nthe physical content of a theory is exhausted by the catalog of the\nspacetime coincidences it licenses. For example, in a theory that\ntreats particles only, the coincidences are the points of intersection\nof the particle worldlines. These coincidences are preserved by\ntransformations of the fields. Therefore two systems of fields that\ncan be intertransformed have the same physical content; they represent\nthe same physical system. \n\nOver the years, the hole argument was deemed to be a trivial error by\nan otherwise insightful Einstein. It was John Stachel (1980) who\nrecognized its highly non-trivial character and brought this\nrealization to the modern community of historians and philosophers of\nphysics. (See also Stachel, 1986.) In Earman and Norton (1987), the\nargument was recast as one that explicitly targets spacetime\nsubstantivalism. For further historical discussion, see Howard and\nNorton (1993), Janssen (1999), Klein (1995) and Norton\n(1987). A thorough, synoptic treatment in four volumes is Renn (2007). For an account of the appropriation and misappropriation of\nEinstein’s point-coincidence argument by the logical empiricists, see\nGiovanelli (2013). There are at least as many responses to the hole argument as authors\nwho have written on it. One line of thought simply agrees that the\nhole argument makes acceptance of Leibniz equivalence compelling. It\nseeks to make more transparent what that acceptance involves by trying\nto find a single mathematical structure that represents a physical\nspacetime system rather than the equivalence class of\nintertransformable structures licensed by Leibniz equivalence. One\nsuch attempt involves the notion of a “Leibniz algebra.” (See Earman,\n1989, Ch. 9, Sect. 9) It has become unclear that such attempts can\nsucceed.  Just as intertransformable fields represent the same\nphysical system, there are distinct but intertransformable Leibniz\nalgebras with the same physical import. If the formalisms of manifolds\nand of Leibniz algebras are intertranslatable, one would expect the\nhole argument to reappear in the latter formalism as well under this\ntranslation. (See Rynasiewicz, 1992.) Another approach seeks to explain Leibniz equivalence and\ndemonstrate the compatibility of general relativity with the hole\nargument through the individuation of spacetime points by means of\n“Dirac observables” and an associated gauge fixing\nstipulation (Lusanna and Pauri, 2006). \n\nEinstein’s original hole argument was formulated in the context of\ngeneral relativity. The hole argument as formulated in Earman and\nNorton (1987) applies to all local spacetime theories and that\nincludes generally covariant formulations of virtually all known\nspacetime theories. One view is that this goes too far, that general\nrelativity is distinct from many other spacetime theories in that its\nspacetime geometry has become dynamical and it is only in such\ntheories that the hole argument should be mounted. (See Earman, 1989,\nCh.9, Section 5; Stachel, 1993; Iftime and Stachel, 2006.) \n\nTo critics, the hole argument presents a huge target. It consists of a\nseries of assumptions all of which are needed to make good on its\nconclusion. The argument can be blocked by denying just one of its\npresumptions. Different authors have sought to sustain denial of\nvirtually every one of them. \n\nPerhaps the most promising of these attacks is one that requires the\nleast modification of the ideas used to mount the hole argument. It is\nthe proposal that spacetime is better represented not by the manifold\nof events alone but by some richer structure, such as the manifold of\nevents in conjunction with metrical properties. (See, for example,\nHoefer, 1996.)  What motivates this escape is the idea that the\nmanifold of events lacks properties essential to spacetime. For\nexample, there is no notion of past and future, of time elapsed or of\nspatial distance in the manifold of events. Thus one might be tempted\nto identify spacetime with the manifold of events plus some further\nstructure that supplies these spatiotemporal notions. In relativistic\ncosmologies, that further structure would be the metrical\nstructure. This escape from the hole argument sometimes succeeds and\nsometimes fails. In certain important special cases, alternative\nversions of the hole argument can be mounted against the\nmanifold-plus-further-structure substantivalists. (See Norton\n1988.) \n A slight and very popular variant allows that each event of the\nmanifold represents a physical spacetime event, but which physical\nevent that might be depends on the spreading of metric and matter\nfields on the manifold. Thus the indeterminism of the hole\ntransformation can be eradicated since the metric and matter\nproperties of an event can be carried with the transformation. (See,\nfor example, Brighouse, 1994.) \n\nMore generally, we may well wonder whether the problems faced by\nspacetime substantivalism is an artifact of the particular formalism\ndescribed above. Bain (1998, 2003) has explored the effect of a transition\nto other formalisms. \n\nThe simplest challenge notes that Leibniz equivalence is a standard\npresumption in the modern mathematical physics literature and suggests\nthat even entertaining its denial (as manifold substantivalists must)\nis some kind of mathematical blunder unworthy of serious attention.\nWhile acceptance of Leibniz equivalence is widespread in the physics\nliterature, it is not a logical truth that can only be denied on pain\nof contradiction. That it embodies non-trivial assumptions whose\nimport must be accepted with sober reflection is indicated by the\nearly acceptance of the hole argument by David Hilbert. (See\n Section 8.2\n above.) If denial of Leibniz equivalence is a blunder so egregious\nthat no competent mathematician would make it, then our standards for\ncompetence have become unattainably high, for they must exclude David\nHilbert in 1915 at the height of his powers. The question has been reopened recently by Weatherall (2018). He\nargues that intertransformable mathematical structures are taken in\nstandard mathematical practice to be the same structure. Thus they\nshould represent the same physical system, precluding denial of\nLeibniz equivalence. Roberts (2014, Other Internet Resources) has\nresponded that Nature, not mathematical practice, should decide\nwhether two mathematical structures represent the same physical\nsystem. Curiel (2018) argues for a similar triviality conclusion as\nWeatherall but on a different basis: there is no physical\ncorrelate to the hole transformation in standard physical practice. \nBelot (2018) argues against a single decision univocally in favor or\nor contrary to Leibniz equivalence. While allowing that hole\ntransformations relate systems that are physically the same, he argues\nthat in some sectors of general relativity, some transformations that\npreserve the metric may relate physically distinct systems. \nAnother challenge seeks principled reasons for denying general\ncovariance. One approach tries to establish that a spacetime can be\nproperly represented by at most one of two intertransformable systems\nof fields on some manifold. So Maudlin (1990) urges that each\nspacetime event carries its metrical properties essentially, that is,\nit would not be that very event if (after redistribution of the\nfields) we tried to assign different metrical properties to it. Teitel\n(2019) has explored a refined version of this essentialist response\nbut concludes that it fails to improve on standard modal responses to\nthe hole argument. Butterfield (1989) portrays intertransformable\nsystems as different possible worlds and uses counterpart theory to\nargue that at most one can represent an actual spacetime. \n\nThese responses are just a few of a large range of responses of\nincreasing ingenuity and technical depth. In the course of the\nscrutiny of the argument, virtually all its aspects have been weighed\nand tested. Is the indeterminism of the hole argument merely an\nartifact of an ill-chosen definition of determinism? Is the problem\nmerely a trivial variant of the philosophical puzzle of inscrutability\nof reference? Or are there deep matters of physics at issue? The\ndebate continues over these and further issues. To enter it, the\nreader is directed to the bibliography below. \n The hole argument has had a broader significance in the philosophy of\nscience in three ways, pertaining to realism about theoretical\nentities, to theories of quantum gravity and to the way we should\napproach gauge freedoms in physical theories. \n The hole argument has presented a new sort of obstacle to the rise of\nscientific realism. According to that view, one should read the\nassertions of our mature theories literally. So, if general relativity\ndescribes a manifold of events and a metrical structure, then that is\nliterally what is there in the view of the strict scientific\nrealist. To think otherwise, it is asserted, would be to leave the\nsuccess of these theories an unexplained miracle. If spacetime does\nnot really have the geometrical structure attributed to it by general\nrelativity, then how can we explain the theory’s success? \n Appealing as this view is, the hole argument shows that some limits\nmust be placed on our literal reading of a successful theory. Or at\nleast that persistence in such literal readings comes with a high\nprice. The hole argument shows us that we might want to admit that\nthere is something a little less really there than the literal reading\nsays, lest we be forced to posit physically real properties that\ntranscend both observation and the determining power of our\ntheory. \n One of the most tenacious problems in modern theoretical physics is\nthe quantization of gravity. While Einstein’s 1915 general theory of\nrelativity produced a revolutionary new way of thinking of gravitation\nin terms of the curvature of spacetime, it is generally agreed now\nthat it cannot be the final account of gravity. The reason is that it\nis still a classical theory. It does not treat matter in accord with\nthe quantum theory. \n The problem of bringing quantum theory and general relativity\ntogether in a single theory remains unsolved. (See Quantum Gravity.) \nThere are many\ncontenders, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity. One of the\nissues that has been raised is that the hole argument has shown us\nthat no successful theory of quantum gravity can be set against an\nindependent, container spacetime. John Stachel was an early proponent\nof this outcome of the hole argument. See Stachel 2005 (Other Internet\nResources). This issue has often been raised by loop quantum gravity\ntheorists specifically as a criticsm of string theoretic approaches,\nfor string theoretic approaches have such a background spacetime. See\nGaul and Rovelli (1999) (Other Internet Resources) and Smolin (2005)\n(Other Internet Resources). In a related development, Gryb and Thébault (2016) have argued that\nthe problem of the hole argument and the “problem of time”\nof quantum gravity are essentially the same, given suitable\nassumptions. For more, see\nProblem of Time in the article on quantum gravity.\n\n \n The hole argument has played a role in the growing recognition in\nphilosophy of physics of the importance of gauge transformations. The\nanalysis of the hole argument provides philosophers of physics a\nconvenient template when they are trying to decide if something is a\ngauge freedom or not. \n To see how this works, let us first review what a gauge freedom is. A\ngauge freedom arises whenever we have mathematically distinct\nstructures in a physical theory that represent the same physical\nsituation. The simplest and best known example occurs in Newtonian\ngravitation theory. If we have a large mass M like the sun,\nit exerts an attractive force F on a unit test mass at\ndistance r from the sun of magnitude \n where G is the universal constant of gravitation. This force\nis an observable in the sense that a unit test mass at r will\nbe accelerated towards the central mass by this force with\nacceleration F. \n These same facts about gravity can be expressed in terms of a\npotential field U. The large mass M generates a\npotential field U at a point r distant from the mass\naccording to \n The potential field U becomes more negative as r\ngets smaller. For r= 6, 4, 3, …, U =\n−2, −3, −4, … where we pick the numerically\neasy case of GM=12. Since masses move to regions of lower\npotential, they fall into this negative potential well. \n A simple rule lets us determine the force pulling a unit mass into\nthe potential well. That force is just the negative gradient of the\npotential field, where (loosely speaking) the gradient is the\ndifference between potentials at the point in question and an\ninfinitesimally neighboring point.  \n The important point in all this is that the potential field\nU = −GM/r is only one of very many\npotential fields compatible with the inverse square law for forces\nF = GM/r2. Since the forces\nF are recovered from the potential field U by\ncomparing the values of U at neighboring points in space, we\ncan add a constant amount—K say—to U\neverywhere and still get the same forces. When we compare the\npotential field U at neighboring points, the Ks at\neach point cancel out.  \n What will become very important below is that this constant\nK must be the same everywhere in space only at one instant of\ntime. Its value can change from moment to moment. So at time\nt=0, we may have K=0; or at t=1 we may have\nK=27; and so on. To indicate that K may vary with\ntime t but not spatial position, it is written here as\n K(t).[7] \n If we use the freedom to add the constant K(t) to\nU to transform to the new potential field U′,\nwe arrive at the simplest example of a gauge transformation \n  Both fields, U and U′ give the same\nobservable forces. In so far as determining the gravitational forces\non bodies is concerned, we can use either U or\nU′. The choice doesn’t matter. That is taken to signify\nthat the two potential fields U and U′\nrepresent the same reality. The transformation between them is a gauge\nfreedom.  \n This is the simplest and best known example of a gauge freedom in\nphysics. If we accept Leibniz equivalence, the hole transformation\nthat relates the two metric fields of the hole argument is another\nexample of a gauge transformation. Gauge transformations have long\nbeen of importance in particle physics, where they have provided a\npowerful means of constructing theories of interaction fields. \n Intertransformable mathematical structures often arise in physical\ntheories. The philosophical problem is to know when two\nintertransformable structures do in fact represent the same physical\nsituation, so that the transformation is a gauge transformation.  \n Sometimes it is thought that the mere fact that two mathematical\nstructures are intertransformable is all that is needed for the\ntransformation to be a gauge transformation and for the differences\nbetween the two structures to correspond to nothing physical. Since\nthe transformation is invertible, the essential fact is that any\nproperty of the first structure will have a correlated property in the\nsecond; and any property of the second will have a correlated property\nin the first. That means that the two structures are, informally\nspeaking, perfect mathematical images of each other and each could\nstand in for the other in any formal application. \n The notion that this transformation must be a gauge transformation\nfails, however. That the two structures are perfect mathematical\nmirror images of each other is not sufficient to ensure that they must\nrepresent the same physical structures. They certainly may\nrepresent the same physical structures, but they also may\nnot. To see this, consider a mathematical, three dimensional\nEuclidean space used to represent a three dimensional physical space\nwith Euclidean properties. The mathematical space hosts many flat, two\ndimensional surfaces, each of which can be transformed perfectly into\nany other. But to say that these transformations are merely gauge\ntransformations is to collapse the three dimensions of the physical\nspace into two dimensions. Each two dimensional surface in the\nphysical space is a perfect copy of every other one; they are not all\nthe same surface. The transformations between them cannot be gauge\ntransformations.   \n One of the major outcomes of the discussions of the hole argument was\nthis: \n Unfortunately that complicates matters. A nice mathematical condition\nfor when something is a gauge freedom would have been a\nstraightforward solution to the problem. The sorts of physical\nconsiderations that speak for or against a gauge freedom are more\nelusive and less decisive. The template of the hole argument provides\ntwo indicators that some candidate transformation is a gauge\ntransformation: A transformation may be a gauge transformation and correspond to no\nreal change in the physical reality represented if \n The argument that justifies this criterion is the same as was used in\nthe hole argument; it is just slightly generalized. The presumption is\nthat it is possible to keep adding further mathematical embellishments\nto the mathematics of a physical theory until we are assuredly adding\nstructures with no physical counterparts. The warning that we have\nreached this point of physical superfluity is that we can make changes\nto these mathematical structures that make no difference to what we\nobserve and also outstrip the determining power of the laws of the\ntheory. When those structures become invisible both to our powers of\nobservation and to the theory’s laws, we are being warned that we have\ngone too far. \n These ideas can be carried further. Earman (2003) has generalized\nthis approach and suggests that the constrained Hamiltonian formalism\ngives principled reason for deciding whether a transformation is a\ngauge transformation. (For an entry into philosophical problems\nassociated with gauge transformations, see the entry on \n symmetry and symmetry breaking,\nespecially Section 2.5; and Brading and Castellani (2003).) \n A hole argument type failure of determinism can often be achieved in\nfield theories, depending, of course, on the specific properties of\nthe field theory. Here’s an example of one within Newtonian\ngravitation theory. \n Let us consider the field surrounding a central mass for which\nGM=12. We shall use the transformation \n  to create a hole type argument that indicates this transformation is\nmerely a gauge transformation. \n We start with the field U. It has values\nU(6)=−2, U(4)=−3, U(3)=−4\nU(2)=−6. If we assume that the mass M is at\nrest in space, then the potential field U will be constant\nthrough time. This field is illustrated in Figure 7 below.  It shows\nthe space around the central mass at different times t=0,\nt=1 and t=2. The circles represent points in space\nwith the same value of U. For example, all those points at\nradius r=6 have U=−2. The constancy of the\nfield in time is represented by the vertical lines that connect points\nwith the same value of U across time. For example, point at\nr=6 at each time instant have the same potential\nU=−2. \n Let us select the following K(t). It is 0 for all\ntime t except in 0 < t < 2. In that time\ninterval, K(t) grows to a maximum value of\nK(t)=2 at t=1. Computing the field\nU′ = U+K(t) for\nt=1, where K=2, we find values for U′\nas follows: U(6)=0, U(4)=−1,\nU(3)=−2 U(2)=−4.  Figure 8\nillustrates this new field. The result of the transformation has been\nto shift regions of a particular value of U′\ninwards. For example, at t=0 and t=2,\nU′=−2 at radial distance r=6. However at\nt=1, U′ has a different value at r=6;\nthe points with U′=−2 have been shifted inward to\nradial distance r=3. As before, the vertical lines connect\npoints with the same potential U′. They bend inward to\nreflect the shift in U′ in the time 0 < t\n< 2. \n What are we to make of these differences between the two fields\nU and U′? Do they betoken any physical\ndifference in gravitational realities? The template of the hole\nargument suggests that they do not. For the differences in U and U’\nare not expressed in any differences in the observationally verifiable\nmotions of bodies falling in the vicinity of the mass M; the forces in\nboth fields are the same. Moreover the laws of Newtonian gravitation\ntheory do not seem to be able to discern which of the two fields ought\nto be realized in space. We can fix the field at\nU=U′ for all space and all times t\n< 0.5 and t > 1.5. Nonetheless, Newtonian gravitation\ntheory is unable to say which of U and U′ is\nthe appropriate extension of the potential field into the times 0.5\n< t < 1.5. Whatever dfferences there are between\nU and U′ in this region outstrip Newtonian\ngravitation theory. \n In this example, the region in which determinism fails fills all\nspace over some short period of time. What was distinctive and\ndisturbing about the indeterminism of the original hole argument was\nthat the indeterminism was localized to a region of arbitrarily small\nextent in both space and time. Such failures of determinism can arise\nin other field theories. After the gauge freedom of Newtonian\ngravitation theory, the next best known gauge freedom is in classical\nelectrodynamics. In that theory, it is possible to set up a hole\nargument in which the indeterminism manifests in a region of\narbitrarily small extent in both space and\n time.[8] Rynasiewicz (2012) has related this gauge freedom to the freedom\nasserted by the thesis of the\n conventionality of simultaneity\n in special relativity. He argues that the relation\nof distant simultaneity among events is conventional to the same\nextent as the intertransformable models of the hole argument are\nphysically equivalent. For more applications of hole type arguments see Iftime (2006)\n(Other Internet Resources), Healey (1999), Lyre (1999) (Other Internet\nResources) and Rickles (2004) (Other Internet Resources), and Rickles\n(2005).
