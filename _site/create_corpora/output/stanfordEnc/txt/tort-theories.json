The other main branches are\ncontract, property, and restitution (sometimes known as unjust\nenrichment).\n\nSection 1 offers a brief overview of tort law and tort theory.\nSection 2 discusses economic analysis, which is the historically\ndominant tort theory and the primary foil for philosophical\nperspectives on tort law. Section 3 discusses the most influential\nnon-economic tort theories, theories that emphasize such normative\nconcepts as justice, rights, and duties.\n\nA tort suit enables the victim of a wrong to seek a remedy from the\nperson who injured her. Unlike a criminal case, which is initiated and\nmanaged by the state, a tort suit is prosecuted by the victim or the\nvictim's estate (or survivors). Moreover, a successful tort suit\nresults in a judgment of liability, rather than a sentence of\npunishment. Such a judgment normally requires the defendant to\ncompensate the plaintiff financially. In principle, an award\nof compensatory damages shifts all of the plaintiff's legally\ncognizable costs to the defendant. (It is controversial whether tort\nreally lives up to this principle in practice.) On rare occasions, a\nplaintiff may also be awarded punitive damages, which go\nbeyond what it necessary for compensation. In other cases, a plaintiff\nmay obtain an injunction: a court order preventing the\ndefendant from injuring her or from invading her rights (perhaps\nharmlessly). An example of the former would be awarding a\nplaintiff (or a class of plaintiffs) an injunction against a polluting\nmanufacturer. An example of the latter would be awarding a plaintiff\nan injunction against a harmless trespass. “Tort” means “wrong” and it is natural to\nthink that wrongs are the domain of tort law. But tort law does not\nconcern itself with all the wrongs that people do. Some wrongs are\naddressed by the criminal law, not private law (some are addressed by\nboth). And not every wrong that falls within the province of private\nlaw falls within tort law. A breach of contract, for example, is not\ntraditionally regarded as a tort.  More generally, tort law does not\nprovide a remedy for every wrong that a victim might suffer. Rather,\ntort law offers relief for a canonical set of wrongs, or torts. These\ninclude assault, battery, defamation, and trespass, among many\nothers. Rather than focusing on categories of torts, it is more fruitful to\nbegin by conceptualizing torts in terms of the elements that a\nplaintiff must prove in order to obtain a remedy. For example, a\ndefendant commits battery if she acts, intending to cause harmful or\noffensive contact with the plaintiff, and such contact in fact results\nfrom her act. If a plaintiff meets the burden of establishing these\nelements, then he or she has established a prima facie case\nfor battery. A defendant who commits a battery so defined might\nnevertheless escape liability by asserting a defense. For example, a\ndefendant in a battery action might avoid liability by showing that\nshe acted in self-defense or that the plaintiff consented to the\notherwise unlawful touching. Many think of battery and trespass as the paradigmatic private\nwrongs and thus as paradigmatic torts. Conceiving of torts in terms of\nthe paradigmatic case invites the thought that tort law proceeds by\nidentifying wrongs that share some important normative characteristics\nwith either trespass or battery—for example, that a tort\ninvolves an intention to disregard certain protected rights of others;\nand perhaps that the fundamental rights protected by torts are those\npertaining to the security of person and property. It also invites the\nthought that the aim or purpose of tort law is to redress those\nwrongs. In such a view, the core concepts of tort law appear to be\n“rights”, “wrongs” and “redress”\nand the dual goals of tort theory are to identify the principle that\nconnects the category of wrongs that torts addresses and to justify\nthe distinctive mode(s) of redress for wrongs that tort law adopts. We\nwill explore this approach to tort law in some detail in what\nfollows. While not denying or downplaying the significance of the concept of\nwrong to understanding tort law, other theorists are inclined to\nexpress the centrality of it in torts in terms of a more generic\nformulation: namely, the duty each us has in undertaking various\nactivities not to injure those our undertakings put at risk. On this\nview, the core duty in torts is not to injure others (either full stop\nor unjustifiably). Such a general approach to conceptualizing tort law has many\nappealing features, not the least of which is the fact that in the\nmodern context tort suits typically begin with the plaintiff’s\nallegation that the defendant wronged her by breaching a duty not to\ninjure her. In addition, this alternative view captures the centrality\nof the notion of a wrong without inviting the idea that the wrongs\nthat fall within the domain of tort law must exhibit some of the\nnormatively significant features of battery or trespass. Beyond that,\nthe alternative view introduces the notion of injury and invites the\nidea that the concern of tort law is to address injuries in some way\nor other; either, for example, by addressing their costs or the\nsuffering that normally attends them. Thus, while the notion of a\nwrong remains important to our understanding of tort law, the\nalternative view invites the thought that the underlying concern of\ntort law is to address the costs, suffering, or more generally, the\nlosses that victims suffer as a result. As helpful as the focus on injuries is, it is important to see that\nthe concept of an injury cannot, by itself, play the foundational role\nin a theory of tort law. After all, the law does not recognize just\nany injury as the basis of a claim in tort. If you beat me in tennis\nor in competition for the affections of another, I may well be\ninjured. Yet I have no claim in tort to repair my bruised ego or\nbroken heart. Since you lack a legal duty not to beat me in\ntennis or in competition for the affections of another, you do not act\ntortiously when you succeed at my expense. Thus, even if we take tort\nto be an institution that addresses injuries, will still stand in need\nof an account of just which injuries it is wrong to cause. Tort law distinguishes between two general classes of duties not to\ninjure: (i) duties not to injure “full stop” and (ii)\nduties not to injure negligently. When you engage in an activity the\nlaw regards as extremely hazardous (e.g., blasting with dynamite), you\nare subject to a duty of the first sort—a duty not to injure\n“full stop”. When you engage in more common activities\n(e.g., driving), you are subject to a duty of the second sort—a\nduty not to injure negligently. Your conduct is governed by strict\nliability when you are subject to a duty not to injure\n“full stop”. Your conduct is governed by fault\nliability when you are subject to a duty not to injure\nnegligently or carelessly. It is worth exploring the difference between strict liability and\nfault liability in greater detail, since the development of both tort\nlaw and tort theory is in part a story about the choice between\nthem. Strict liability. Suppose I make a mess on my property and\npresent you with the bill for cleaning it up. Absent some prior\nagreement, this would seem rather odd. It is my mess, after all, not\nyours. Now suppose that instead of making a mess on my property and\npresenting you with the bill, I make a mess on your property and walk\naway, claiming that the mess is your problem. If it was inappropriate\nof me to present you with the bill for the mess I made on my property,\nit hardly seems that I have improved matters making my mess on your\nproperty. I have a duty to clean up my messes and the existence of\nthis duty does not appear to depend on how hard I have tried not to\nmake a mess in the first place. In other words, it does not depend on\nwhether I made the mess absentmindedly or carelessly. All that matters\nis that it is my mess; that is to say, I made it. And if I make it, it is\nmine to clean. This is a helpful way of capturing the underlying\nintuition expressed by the rule of strict liability. Fault liability. Unless we stay home all day, we are each\nbound to make the occasional mess in one another's life. This being\nso, it would be unreasonable of me to demand that you never make any\nkind of mess in my life. What I can reasonably demand is that you take\nmy interests into account and moderate your behavior accordingly. In\nparticular, I can reasonably demand that you take ordinary care (i.e.,\nthe care that a reasonable person would take) not to injure me. In\nother words, I can reasonably demand that you refrain from negligently\ninjuring me. This is a useful way of capturing the underlying\nintuition expressed by the rule of fault liability. People sometimes misunderstand the nature of fault liability in\ntort because they misunderstand the nature of strict liability in\ntort. And they misunderstand the nature of strict liability in tort\nbecause their inclination is to model it on the notion of strict\nliability in the criminal law, with which many theorists and\nlaypersons alike are more familiar. Strict liability in the criminal\nlaw is a form of responsibility without culpability. If you are\nstrictly liable for a criminal offense, you are punishable for the\noffense even if your conduct is not morally blameworthy. The standard\nway to express this is to say that strict liability in criminal law is\nnot defeasible by the kind of excuse one would offer in order to\ndefeat an attribution of culpability or blameworthy (e.g.,\nduress). If we conceived similarly of strict liability in tort, we would\nthen understand fault liability, incorrectly, as liability\nthat is defeasible by excuses that establish the absence of\nculpability, in other words, as liability (only) for one's culpable\nconduct. But you can be at fault in tort even if your conduct is not\nmorally blameworthy. Under a regime of fault liability, you are liable\nfor injuries you cause while failing to comport yourself as\na reasonable person would in the circumstances. It won't get\nyou off the hook that you are not a reasonable person, or that could\nnot come up to that standard in this case. Nor will it matter that\nyour failure to come up to that standard is a failure for which you\nare utterly blameless. Fault liability is not defeasible by excuses\nthat establish the absence of culpability. This raises the question of how to distinguish fault liability from\nstrict liability in tort law, since neither is defeasible by a showing\nof blamelessness. The difference between the two regimes of liability\nis that only under fault can you avoid liability if you comport\nyourself as a reasonable person—in other words, if you act\nreasonably or justifiably—whereas you remain subject to strict\nliability even if you had sufficient reason for what you did.  Thus,\nfault liability, but not strict liability, can be undermined\nby justification. Some find it helpful to distinguish between strict liability and\nfault liability in terms of the content of the underlying\nlegal duty. In the case of blasting—an activity traditionally\ngoverned by strict liability—the blaster has a\nduty not-to-injure-by-blasting. In the case of\ndriving—an activity traditionally governed by fault\nliability—the driver has a\nduty not-to-injure-by-driving-negligently. No matter how much\ncare he takes, the blaster fails to discharge his duty whenever his\nblasting is causally connected in the right way to another’s\ninjury or damage to someone’s property. In contrast, the driver\nfails to discharge his duty only when he injures someone\nnegligently. Analytical theories seek to interpret and explain\ntort law. More specifically, they aim (i) to identify the concepts\nthat figure centrally in tort's substantive norms and structural\nfeatures (the latter being the procedures and mechanisms by which the\ninstitution of tort law enforces its substantive norms) and (ii) to\nexplain how tort's substantive norms and structural features are\nrelated. Key substantive norms include the wrongs that tort recognizes\nand the remedies that it provides for those wrongs. Key structural\nfeatures include the fact that tort suits are brought by the victim\nrather than by the state and the fact that such suits are\n“bilateral”: victims (plaintiffs) sue their putative\ninjurers instead of drawing on a common pool of resources, as in New\nZealand’s accident compensation scheme (which was adopted as a\nsubstitute for tort law). Normative theories seek to justify or reform tort\nlaw.  Justificatory theories aim to provide tort with a normative\ngrounding, often by defending the values tort embodies or the goals it\naims to achieve. Reformist theories seek to improve tort law,\nsay, by recommending changes that would bring the institution closer\nin line with its core values or would help it do a better job of\nachieving its goals. The distinction between analytical and normative theories is not\nexclusive. On the contrary, few analytical theories are altogether\ndevoid of normative elements and no normative theory is ever devoid of\nanalytical elements. Analytical theories frequently invoke concepts\nthat are fundamentally normative, since such theories (following\nDworkin) often seek to portray tort's substantive norms and structural\nfeatures in their “best light”. All the more so, normative\ntheories are always at least partly analytical, since such theories\nmust either provide or presuppose some account of the institution they\nseek to justify or reform. Along another axis, we can distinguish between theories of tort\nbased on whether they are instrumental or non-instrumental. (This\ndistinction cuts across the distinction between the analytical and the\nnormative.) Instrumental theories regard tort's essential features as\nexplicable in terms of an overarching purpose, typically, the\nremediation of some social problem, such as the problem of allocating\nthe costs of life's misfortunes. These theories do not always agree on\nthe specific principles that govern (or ought to govern) the\nallocation of costs. This is in part because they disagree about\nthe further purposes that tort serves (or ought to serve) in\nallocating costs. Some theorists believe that tort aims (or ought to\naim) at allocating costs efficiently. Others believe that\ntort aims (or ought to aim) at allocating costs fairly. Both\nsorts of theorist treat tort instrumentally, as a tool for solving a\nsocial problem. In contrast, non-instrumental theorists do not see\ntort primarily as responding to a social problem. They believe that\ntort is better understood as a way of giving expression to certain\nmoral or political principles. For many decades now, an economic analysis of tort law has been\nascendant, especially (but not only) in American law schools. Rather\nthan surveying the range of economic theories, this entry focuses in\ndepth on what is arguably the dominant strain of economic analysis:\noptimal deterrence theory. Proponents of this approach, like economic\nanalysts more generally, see tort liability primarily as a mode of\nallocating the costs of accidents (though an economic analysis can be\nextended to cover intentional torts, like assault and battery, too).\nTheir principal claim is that tort should be understood as aiming to\nminimize the sum of the costs of accidents and the costs of avoiding\nthem. Since shifting costs is itself costly, economic analysis begins\nwith the following question: when is it worth incurring costs in order\nto shift costs? The obvious answer is that it makes sense to incur\ncosts in order to reduce costs only when doing so is itself cost\njustified: that is, when the cost incurred are less than the costs\navoided. This leads to the well known economic view that the goal of\ntort law is to minimize the sum of the costs of accidents and the\ncosts of avoiding them—so-called, optimal deterrence. Taking the relevant social problem to be the problem of costly\naccidents, economic analysts deem the paradigmatic tort to be that\nof negligence. The law holds a person to be negligent when\nshe imposes an unreasonable risk of injury on another. Imposing an\nunreasonable risk of injury is in turn a matter of failing to take\nprecautions that a reasonable person would take. But which precautions\nwould a reasonable person take? Economists offer the following answer: a precaution is reasonable\nwhen it is rational; a precaution is rational when it\nis cost-justified; and a precaution is cost-justified when\nthe cost of the precaution is less than the expected injury (the\nlatter being the cost of the anticipated injury discounted by the\nprobability of the injury's occurrence). Imagine that you are engaged\nin an activity that carries a benefit of $100 and an expected injury\nof $90. Now suppose that the only way to prevent the injury is to stop\nthe activity. Other things being equal, you would be irrational to\nforego a benefit of $100 in order to avoid a cost of $90. Foregoing\nthe benefit would not be a cost-justified precaution; you’d\nrather incur the injury and keep the $10 profit from the activity. Now\nimagine that things are the other way around: the benefit is $90 and\nthe expected injury is $100. Under these circumstances, foregoing the\nbenefit would be a cost-justified precaution. You would be\nirrational not to forego the benefit, since you would have to\nincur a $10 loss to engage in the activity. This is the calculation\nthat a rational agent would make when the costs and benefits are his\nalone. As economists see things, the same standard of rationality should\napply when the benefit and the injury accrue to different\nparties. That is because the rationality of an action depends of the\nexpected costs and benefits and not on their distribution. If I can\nspare you some injury by taking precautions less costly than your\nexpected injury, my failure to take such precautions would be\nirrational, hence, unreasonable and thus negligent. Should you be\ninjured as a result of my failure to take those precautions, then I\nwould be at fault for your loss; and under the rule of fault\nliability, I would be required to make good your costs. By the same\ntoken, if I can spare you some injury only by taking precautions\ncostlier than your expected injury, my failure to take these\nprecautions is not irrational, hence, not negligent. If the injury is\ngoverned by the rule of fault liability, its costs will be yours, not\nmine, to bear. The rule of fault liability has much to recommend it from an\neconomic point of view. In particular, it induces all rational\npersons—injurers and victims alike—to take all and only\ncost-justified precautions. If all potential injurers behave\nrationally, losses will always lie where they fall: with victims.\nRational victims will therefore approach all accidents assuming that\nthey will have to bear the costs. But then they, too, will take all\nand only cost-justified precautions. So the rule of fault liability is\neconomically efficient: it produces an optimal level of\nrisk-taking. If fault liability is efficient, what are we to make of strict\nliability? Can it be efficient as well? Since someone facing strict\nliability will bear the costs of his conduct whether or not he is at\nfault, one might think that a potential defendant under a regime of\nstrict liability will have no incentive to invest in precautions. This\nis wrong. Suppose that I am strictly liable for some costs that I\nimpose on you—costs of $100. Suppose further that by taking $90\nworth of precautions I can eliminate the chance of my imposing these\ncosts on you. What is it rational for me to do? The answer is obvious.\nIt is rational for me to invest in $90 worth of precautions, since I\ncome out $10 ahead if I prevent the injury and thereby avoid liability\nfor it. So even under a regime of strict liability, potential\ndefendants have an incentive to take cost-justified precautions. And\nthey won’t take any precautions that are not cost-justified. If\nit would cost $110 to take a precaution that would eliminate the\nchance that you would suffer an injury with an expected cost of $100,\nI would prefer to pay for your injury than take the precaution. So\nstrict liability does not induce extra care. Under a regime of strict\nliability, potential defendants have an incentive to take all\ncost-justified precautions—just as they do under fault\nliability. In a crucial respect, the plight of the defendant (injurer) under\nstrict liability is identical to that of the plaintiff (victim) under\nfault liability. If we assume that the injurer is rational, we can\ninfer that under fault liability he will take all cost-justified\nprecautions. As a result, any losses that his conduct turns out to\ncause will lie where they fall: with the victim. This means that we\ncan characterize the victim as herself facing a sort of strict\nliability, namely, strict liability for losses not caused by another's\nfault.  (Strictly speaking, this is a misnomer, since one cannot be\nliable to oneself, but the analogy is nevertheless helpful.) The\nvictim cannot shift these losses to the injurer because the injurer\nhas insulated himself from liability by taking cost-justified\nprecautions. So the rational victim will ask herself the following\nquestion: which is lower—the cost of taking precautions or the\nexpected cost of incurring an injury? She will take precautions when\n(and only when) taking precautions is cheaper than remaining\nvulnerable to injury. The upshot is that strict liability and fault liability both induce\nrational persons to take all and only cost-justified precautions. If\nefficiency requires that individuals take all and only cost-justified\nprecautions, then strict and fault liability can both be\nefficient. If both rules can be efficient, why might we prefer one to the\nother? Strict liability and fault liability have different\ndistributional consequences. A rule of strict liability makes the\ncosts of the defendant's conduct higher than a rule of fault liability\nwould; he pays for the injuries he causes whether or not he has taken\nreasonable care to avoid them. A rule of fault liability raises the\ncosts of those who are injured relative to strict liability, since\nthey are compensated for fewer accidents. So if we have an independent\nreason to privilege the plaintiff's activity over the defendant's (or\nvice versa)—maybe we want less of the first activity to occur or\nwe feel that people should have to pay a steeper price for engaging in\nit—then we have an independent reason to prefer strict liability\nto fault liability (or vice versa). There is no doubt that economic analysis offers valuable insight\ninto tort law's capacity to increase overall safety and reduce the\ncosts of misfortune or bad luck. For all its insight, however,\neconomic analysis is vulnerable to difficult objections. These\nobjections speak both to tort's substantive norms and to its\nstructural features. We discuss some of the most significant\nobjections here. Many theorists believe that economic analysis offers a questionable\ninterpretation of the legal duty to behave reasonably. In\ncharacterizing negligence as the failure to take cost-justified\nprecautions, economic analysis identifies reasonable\nrisk-taking with rational risk taking. Economic analysis\neffectively invites us to determine what risks it would be acceptable\nfor a potential defendant to take on the assumption that he owns both\nthe resultant benefits and the resultant injuries. This way of\narticulating the fault standard treats an activity's costs and\nbenefits as being of the same importance regardless of where they\nfall. But what I owe you may not be the same as what I owe\nmyself. Indeed, it might be reasonable for me to be more solicitous of\nyour well-being than my own, since we might think me entitled to make\ntradeoffs with respect to my own well-being that I am not entitled to\nmake with respect to yours. Besides offering a questionable interpretation of the legal duty to\nbehave reasonably, economic analysis arguably fails to make good sense\nof the concept of legal duty more generally. The norms of tort law\nimpose duties not to injure. There are two questions we can ask about\nthese duties: What do they require of us? And to whom do we owe them?\nTort consequently distinguishes between a duty's content and its\nscope.  This is a distinction much emphasized by Judge Cardozo\nin Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road, the most famous\nAmerican tort case. In Cardozo's view, I have a duty to guard against\ninjuring those who fall within the ambit of foreseeable risk\nassociated with my conduct. Others might be injured by what I do, and\nwhat I do might be lamentable or mischievous, but those who fall\noutside the ambit of foreseeable risk have no claim against me in\ntort. This is not because my careless behavior does not injure\nthem. Ex hypothesi, it does. They have no claim against me\nbecause I have no legal duty to take their interests into account. The\nonly individuals who can have a claim against me in tort are those to\nwhom I have a legal duty. The problem for economic analysis is that\nthe duty restriction on liability is arguably incompatible with the\ngoal of inducing individuals to take appropriate precautions. In order\nfor injurers to have an incentive to take appropriate precautions,\neach must face the costs of his activity in full. But the duty\nrequirement allows injurers to displace at least some of these costs\non their victims. Economic analysts have responded to this problem\nalternately by (i) offering an efficiency rationale for the\nforeseeability limitation and (ii) arguing that the duty requirement\nis an imperfection in tort law. Economic analysis cares about the relationship between a particular\ninjurer and victim only to the extent that the nature of this\nrelationship provides evidence of the ability of either party to\nreduce accident costs. As far as economic analysis is concerned, there\nis no intrinsic reason why a victim should sue the person who injured\nhim.  Nor is there any intrinsic reason why a plaintiff should argue\nin court that the defendant wronged him, rather than that the\ndefendant was in a better position to reduce overall costs. The most basic relationship in our actual institution of tort law\nis the relationship between an injurer and his victim—not the\nrelationship between each litigant, taken separately, and the goal of\nminimizing the sum of the costs of accidents and the costs of avoiding\nthem. If the victim of another's mischief brings an action in tort, he\nbrings it against the person he believes has injured him, not against\nthe person best situated to reduce overall costs. We will learn the most from economic analysis if we view it as a\nreformist, normative theory, a theory that asks questions of the\nfollowing sort: What substantive liability rules have the greatest\nimpact on reducing the incidence of accidents at the lowest cost? What\nprocedural rules at a trial will induce those with relevant\ninformation to reveal it? What substantive and procedural rules will\nlead to optimal investments in safety? These are the questions of a\nreformer less interested in the actual state of tort law than in how\ntort law can be improved. Economic analysis is less convincing if its\naim is to illuminate the law from the perspective of a judge or a\nlitigant. Corrective justice theory—the most influential non-economic\nperspective on tort law—understands tort law as embodying a\nsystem of first- and second-order duties. First order duties prohibit\nconduct (e.g., assault, battery, and defamation) or inflicting an\ninjury (either full stop or negligently). (Some theorists believe that\ncorrective justice has nothing to say about the character of these\nnorms; others think that it helps define their scope and content.)\nSecond order duties in torts are duties of repair. These\nduties arise upon the breach of first-order duties. That second-order\nduties so arise follows from the principle of corrective\njustice, which (in its most influential form) says that an\nindividual has a duty to repair the wrongful losses that his conduct\ncauses. For a loss to be wrongful in the relevant sense, it need not\nbe one for which the wrongdoer is morally to blame. It need only be a\nloss incident to the violation of the victim's right— a right\ncorrelative to the wrongdoer's first-order duty. So understood, corrective justice neatly accounts for the central\nfeatures of tort law. It explains why tort law links victim and\ninjurer, since it takes the injurer to have the duty to repair the\nwrongful losses that he causes. And it explains why tort law presents\nitself as a law of wrongs, rather than as a tool for inducing\nefficient behavior. We can bring out what is distinctive about the corrective justice\napproach to tort law by contrasting it with various alternatives. From the standpoint of economic analysis, all legal liabilities are\njust costs of one sort or another. From an economic perspective, there\nare no significant normative differences among such things as\nlicensing fees, tort liability, and taxes: normative differences that\nwould in any event make a difference in how the law should approach\nthem.  From an economic perspective, the choice among them is based on\ntheir relative comparative advantages in securing the goals the law\nseeks to reach. All are tools for achieving social goals, and in some\ncases, taxes are better tools than licenses are. In other cases, tort\nliability is better than both. In many cases a mix of tools will prove\noptimal. The important point is that within the economic analysis, the\n“fit”or “aptness” of a response to wrongdoing\nis determined by its effectiveness in securing the aim in question;\nand in tort law, that aim is optimal deterrence. Tort liability is a\ntool that achieves that aim by shifting costs. In contrast, corrective justice theory maintains that tort\nliability is not simply a mechanism for shifting costs. A licensing\nfee imposes a cost, as does a tax, but we would not say that in\nlevying fees or taxes we are holding people responsible or accountable\nfor their wrongdoing.  In contrast, when we hold a defendant liable in\ntort, we say that he committed a wrong—assault, battery,\nnegligence, or the like—and it is in respect of that wrong that\nhe must be made to pay. For this reason, corrective justice theory\ninsists that different legal liabilities are not simply\ninterchangeable cost-shifting implements in the legal tool box, as\nthey can have radically different expressive consequences, and some\nare appropriate, apt, or fitting responses to the wrongdoing in\nquestion while others are not. Many theorists believe that a principle of retributive\njustice—say, that the blameworthy deserve to\nsuffer—does a good job of interpreting and justifying criminal\nlaw.  Yet most theorists think that such a principle does a rather\npoor job of interpreting and justifying tort law (except, perhaps, for\nthe part of tort law concerned with punitive damages). First, tort\nliability does not communicate condemnation, since (as explained\nabove) a defendant can be liable in tort even though he did nothing\nblameworthy. Second, the duty of repair in tort is treated as a debt\nof repayment, in that it can be paid by third parties—and not\njust when the creditor (the plaintiff) has authorized repayment. By\ncontrast, “debts” incurred as a result of criminal\nmischief can never be paid by third parties. You cannot serve my\nprison sentence. Third, a person cannot guard against liability to\ncriminal sanction by purchasing insurance. Yet it is common to\npurchase insurance to guard against the burdens of tort\nliability. Indeed, in some areas of life (e.g., driving), purchasing\nthird-party insurance is mandatory. Some theorists are skeptical of the idea that corrective justice is\nreally an independent principle of justice. Their concern is twofold:\nconsiderations that make corrective justice seem like a genuine\nprinciple of justice also seem to undermine its independence\nfrom distributive justice (justice in the distribution of\nresources); at the same time, considerations that support the\nprinciple's independence from distributive justice also seem to\nundermine its status as a genuine principle of justice. This twofold\nconcern stems from the fact that corrective justice requires the\nreversal of wrongful changes to an initial distribution of\nresources. If, on the one hand, some initial distribution of resources\nis just, then corrective justice seemingly does no more than require\nthat we return individuals to the position to which they are\nentitled merely as a matter of distributive justice.  This\nsuggests that corrective justice is but distributive justice from\nan ex post perspective rather than an independent principle\nof justice. If, on the other hand, an initial distribution of\nresources is unjust, then corrective justice seemingly requires that\nwe sustain, enforce, or entrench what is ex hypothesi an\ninjustice. This suggests that corrective justice is not really a\nmatter of justice at all: independent, yes; a genuine principle of\njustice, no. First Response: Corrective Justice as Transactional\nJustice. Some theorists respond by suggesting that we understand\ncorrective justice as a kind of transactional justice.  These\ntheorists identify the domain of distributive justice with the initial\ndistribution of holdings and take corrective justice to be concerned\nexclusively with norms of transfer, norms that govern whether\ndepartures from an initial distribution are legitimate.  Whatever the\nunderlying pattern of holdings, we can distinguish legitimate modes of\ntransfer from illegitimate ones. If agreement or gift moves resources\nfrom one person to another, then the mode of transfer is\nlegitimate. Never mind whether the resultant allocation of resources\nis unequal or unfair: that is a concern of distributive, not\ntransactional, justice. If fraud or force moves resources from one\nperson to another, then the mode of transfer is illegitimate. Even if\nan illegitimate transfer gives rise to an equitable distribution, the\ntransaction is unjust and must therefore be annulled. Second Response: Justice versus Legitimacy. Other\ntheorists respond by distinguishing between a\ndistribution's justness and its legitimacy. These\ntheorists allow that a legitimate distribution of resources may fall\nshort of being a fully just distribution. But they insist that a\n(merely) legitimate distribution can suffice to generate duties of\nrepair. Civil recourse theory agrees with corrective justice theory that\ntort's normative structure involves a variety of first-order duties,\nduties that establish norms of conduct. Yet civil recourse theory\ntakes a different view of the legal consequence of a first-order\nduty's breach. Whereas corrective justice theory holds that such a\nbreach saddles the would-be defendant with a second-order\nduty—in particular, a duty of repair—civil recourse theory\nholds that no such second-order duty results directly from the\nbreach. Rather, the breach of a first-order duty endows the victim\nwith a right of action: a legal power to seek redress from\nher injurer. That this power so arises follows from what proponents\nregard as a deeply embedded legal principle—the principle of\ncivil recourse—which says that one who has been wronged is\nlegally entitled to an avenue of recourse against the perpetrator. Civil recourse theory has substantial explanatory power. Perhaps\nmost obvious, it explains why tort suits have a bilateral\nstructure—why the victim of a tortious wrong seeks redress from\nthe wrongdoer herself instead of drawing on a common pool of\nresources. It also explains why tort suits are privately\nprosecuted—why the state does not act of its own accord to\nimpose liability on those who breach first-order duties. According to\ncivil recourse theory, the breach of a first-order duty gives rise not\nto a legal duty but to a legal power, a power the victim can choose\nnot to exercise. Furthermore, civil recourse theory accommodates a number of tort's\ncentral substantive features, features that arguably elude corrective\njustice theory. Prominent among these are (i) the fact that tort\noffers a variety of different remedies, only some of which are\ndesigned to restore the plaintiff's antecedent holdings, and (ii) the\nfact that the defendant incurs a legal duty to pay damages only upon a\nlawsuit's successful conclusion (either by settlement or by the final\njudgment of a court), rather than immediately upon the breach of a\nfirst-order duty. Despite its explanatory power, civil recourse theory is vulnerable\nto a potentially serious objection—or else it seems to leave\ntort law vulnerable to such an objection. Because civil recourse\ntheory offers little guidance as to what sort of redress is\nappropriate, the theory depicts tort law primarily as an institution\nthat enables one person to harm another with the aid of the state's\ncoercive power. Tort law may well be such an institution, of\ncourse. But if it is, it may be deeply flawed—indeed, it may be\nunjust. This problem can be posed in the form of a dilemma. Either the\nprinciple of civil recourse is grounded in a principle of justice or\nit is not. If the principle of civil recourse is grounded in a\nprinciple of justice, then civil recourse theory threatens to collapse\ninto a kind of a justice-based theory. If the principle of civil\nrecourse is not so grounded, then the principle apparently does no\nmore than license one party to inflict an evil on another. If that is\nwhat the principle does, we might reasonably wonder whether it can\njustify or even make coherent sense of an entire body of law. One way to rescue civil recourse theory from this objection is to\nsee it as a kind of corrective justice theory, though doing so\nrequires adjusting the picture of corrective justice presented\nabove. Earlier, we said that corrective justice requires that a\nwrongdoer repair the wrongful losses that she causes. But some think\nthis an inadequate account of corrective justice, since all too often,\nit is not possible for a wrongdoer to repair the injury that she\ninflicted on her victim.  When a victim suffers a serious bodily\ninjury, for example, it may be possible for the wrongdoer to pay her\nmedical bills or compensate her for lost wages, but the physical\ndamage the victim suffered is probably beyond repair. And the problem\nis all the more striking when the wrong involves a serious affront to\nthe victim’s dignity. For example, it is doubtful that a rapist\ncould repair the “loss” suffered by his victim. In cases\nsuch as these, we must find a way to respond to the wrongdoing that\ndoes not require repair, since repair is not possible. With this in\nmind, some have suggested that what corrective justice corrects is not\na disturbance in the prevailing distribution of goods brought about by\nthe wrong, but rather the expressive significance of the wrong. We do\ncorrective justice, on this picture, by responding to the wrongdoing\nin a way that reasserts the victim’s right. We cannot restore\nthe victim of a rape to the position she was in before the wrong, but\nwe can treat her rape as a wrong, and thereby reassert her right not\nto be raped. This picture of corrective justice can be used to ground the\nprinciple of civil recourse. If a person has a right not to be\nassaulted, for example, then we must treat an assault against her as\nwrong, so as to reassert that right. One way to do that is to maintain\na system of civil recourse, which entitles her to demand a remedy from\nanyone who assaults her. Oftentimes, repair will be a sensible form of\nrecourse, since ensuring that the plaintiff does not suffer the\nconsequences of the wrong will be one way of communicating that she\nhad a right not to be wronged in that fashion. But this approach can\nalso explain why tort allows victims to demand compensation even when\ntheir injuries are irreparable. The payment of damages in respect of\nthe wrong reinforces the victim’s right even if it does not\nrepair her injury.","contact.mail":"jules.coleman@nyu.edu","contact.domain":"nyu.edu"},{"date.published":"2003-09-22","date.changed":"2015-12-17","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tort-theories/","author1":"Jules Coleman","author2":"Scott Hershovitz","entry":"tort-theories","body.text":"\n\nTort is a branch of private law. The other main branches are\ncontract, property, and restitution (sometimes known as unjust\nenrichment).\n\nSection 1 offers a brief overview of tort law and tort theory.\nSection 2 discusses economic analysis, which is the historically\ndominant tort theory and the primary foil for philosophical\nperspectives on tort law. Section 3 discusses the most influential\nnon-economic tort theories, theories that emphasize such normative\nconcepts as justice, rights, and duties.\n\nA tort suit enables the victim of a wrong to seek a remedy from the\nperson who injured her. Unlike a criminal case, which is initiated and\nmanaged by the state, a tort suit is prosecuted by the victim or the\nvictim's estate (or survivors). Moreover, a successful tort suit\nresults in a judgment of liability, rather than a sentence of\npunishment. Such a judgment normally requires the defendant to\ncompensate the plaintiff financially. In principle, an award\nof compensatory damages shifts all of the plaintiff's legally\ncognizable costs to the defendant. (It is controversial whether tort\nreally lives up to this principle in practice.) On rare occasions, a\nplaintiff may also be awarded punitive damages, which go\nbeyond what it necessary for compensation. In other cases, a plaintiff\nmay obtain an injunction: a court order preventing the\ndefendant from injuring her or from invading her rights (perhaps\nharmlessly). An example of the former would be awarding a\nplaintiff (or a class of plaintiffs) an injunction against a polluting\nmanufacturer. An example of the latter would be awarding a plaintiff\nan injunction against a harmless trespass. “Tort” means “wrong” and it is natural to\nthink that wrongs are the domain of tort law. But tort law does not\nconcern itself with all the wrongs that people do. Some wrongs are\naddressed by the criminal law, not private law (some are addressed by\nboth). And not every wrong that falls within the province of private\nlaw falls within tort law. A breach of contract, for example, is not\ntraditionally regarded as a tort.  More generally, tort law does not\nprovide a remedy for every wrong that a victim might suffer. Rather,\ntort law offers relief for a canonical set of wrongs, or torts. These\ninclude assault, battery, defamation, and trespass, among many\nothers. Rather than focusing on categories of torts, it is more fruitful to\nbegin by conceptualizing torts in terms of the elements that a\nplaintiff must prove in order to obtain a remedy. For example, a\ndefendant commits battery if she acts, intending to cause harmful or\noffensive contact with the plaintiff, and such contact in fact results\nfrom her act. If a plaintiff meets the burden of establishing these\nelements, then he or she has established a prima facie case\nfor battery. A defendant who commits a battery so defined might\nnevertheless escape liability by asserting a defense. For example, a\ndefendant in a battery action might avoid liability by showing that\nshe acted in self-defense or that the plaintiff consented to the\notherwise unlawful touching. Many think of battery and trespass as the paradigmatic private\nwrongs and thus as paradigmatic torts. Conceiving of torts in terms of\nthe paradigmatic case invites the thought that tort law proceeds by\nidentifying wrongs that share some important normative characteristics\nwith either trespass or battery—for example, that a tort\ninvolves an intention to disregard certain protected rights of others;\nand perhaps that the fundamental rights protected by torts are those\npertaining to the security of person and property. It also invites the\nthought that the aim or purpose of tort law is to redress those\nwrongs. In such a view, the core concepts of tort law appear to be\n“rights”, “wrongs” and “redress”\nand the dual goals of tort theory are to identify the principle that\nconnects the category of wrongs that torts addresses and to justify\nthe distinctive mode(s) of redress for wrongs that tort law adopts. We\nwill explore this approach to tort law in some detail in what\nfollows. While not denying or downplaying the significance of the concept of\nwrong to understanding tort law, other theorists are inclined to\nexpress the centrality of it in torts in terms of a more generic\nformulation: namely, the duty each us has in undertaking various\nactivities not to injure those our undertakings put at risk. On this\nview, the core duty in torts is not to injure others (either full stop\nor unjustifiably). Such a general approach to conceptualizing tort law has many\nappealing features, not the least of which is the fact that in the\nmodern context tort suits typically begin with the plaintiff’s\nallegation that the defendant wronged her by breaching a duty not to\ninjure her. In addition, this alternative view captures the centrality\nof the notion of a wrong without inviting the idea that the wrongs\nthat fall within the domain of tort law must exhibit some of the\nnormatively significant features of battery or trespass. Beyond that,\nthe alternative view introduces the notion of injury and invites the\nidea that the concern of tort law is to address injuries in some way\nor other; either, for example, by addressing their costs or the\nsuffering that normally attends them. Thus, while the notion of a\nwrong remains important to our understanding of tort law, the\nalternative view invites the thought that the underlying concern of\ntort law is to address the costs, suffering, or more generally, the\nlosses that victims suffer as a result. As helpful as the focus on injuries is, it is important to see that\nthe concept of an injury cannot, by itself, play the foundational role\nin a theory of tort law. After all, the law does not recognize just\nany injury as the basis of a claim in tort. If you beat me in tennis\nor in competition for the affections of another, I may well be\ninjured. Yet I have no claim in tort to repair my bruised ego or\nbroken heart. Since you lack a legal duty not to beat me in\ntennis or in competition for the affections of another, you do not act\ntortiously when you succeed at my expense. Thus, even if we take tort\nto be an institution that addresses injuries, will still stand in need\nof an account of just which injuries it is wrong to cause. Tort law distinguishes between two general classes of duties not to\ninjure: (i) duties not to injure “full stop” and (ii)\nduties not to injure negligently. When you engage in an activity the\nlaw regards as extremely hazardous (e.g., blasting with dynamite), you\nare subject to a duty of the first sort—a duty not to injure\n“full stop”. When you engage in more common activities\n(e.g., driving), you are subject to a duty of the second sort—a\nduty not to injure negligently. Your conduct is governed by strict\nliability when you are subject to a duty not to injure\n“full stop”. Your conduct is governed by fault\nliability when you are subject to a duty not to injure\nnegligently or carelessly. It is worth exploring the difference between strict liability and\nfault liability in greater detail, since the development of both tort\nlaw and tort theory is in part a story about the choice between\nthem. Strict liability. Suppose I make a mess on my property and\npresent you with the bill for cleaning it up. Absent some prior\nagreement, this would seem rather odd. It is my mess, after all, not\nyours. Now suppose that instead of making a mess on my property and\npresenting you with the bill, I make a mess on your property and walk\naway, claiming that the mess is your problem. If it was inappropriate\nof me to present you with the bill for the mess I made on my property,\nit hardly seems that I have improved matters making my mess on your\nproperty. I have a duty to clean up my messes and the existence of\nthis duty does not appear to depend on how hard I have tried not to\nmake a mess in the first place. In other words, it does not depend on\nwhether I made the mess absentmindedly or carelessly. All that matters\nis that it is my mess; that is to say, I made it. And if I make it, it is\nmine to clean. This is a helpful way of capturing the underlying\nintuition expressed by the rule of strict liability. Fault liability. Unless we stay home all day, we are each\nbound to make the occasional mess in one another's life. This being\nso, it would be unreasonable of me to demand that you never make any\nkind of mess in my life. What I can reasonably demand is that you take\nmy interests into account and moderate your behavior accordingly. In\nparticular, I can reasonably demand that you take ordinary care (i.e.,\nthe care that a reasonable person would take) not to injure me. In\nother words, I can reasonably demand that you refrain from negligently\ninjuring me. This is a useful way of capturing the underlying\nintuition expressed by the rule of fault liability. People sometimes misunderstand the nature of fault liability in\ntort because they misunderstand the nature of strict liability in\ntort. And they misunderstand the nature of strict liability in tort\nbecause their inclination is to model it on the notion of strict\nliability in the criminal law, with which many theorists and\nlaypersons alike are more familiar. Strict liability in the criminal\nlaw is a form of responsibility without culpability. If you are\nstrictly liable for a criminal offense, you are punishable for the\noffense even if your conduct is not morally blameworthy. The standard\nway to express this is to say that strict liability in criminal law is\nnot defeasible by the kind of excuse one would offer in order to\ndefeat an attribution of culpability or blameworthy (e.g.,\nduress). If we conceived similarly of strict liability in tort, we would\nthen understand fault liability, incorrectly, as liability\nthat is defeasible by excuses that establish the absence of\nculpability, in other words, as liability (only) for one's culpable\nconduct. But you can be at fault in tort even if your conduct is not\nmorally blameworthy. Under a regime of fault liability, you are liable\nfor injuries you cause while failing to comport yourself as\na reasonable person would in the circumstances. It won't get\nyou off the hook that you are not a reasonable person, or that could\nnot come up to that standard in this case. Nor will it matter that\nyour failure to come up to that standard is a failure for which you\nare utterly blameless. Fault liability is not defeasible by excuses\nthat establish the absence of culpability. This raises the question of how to distinguish fault liability from\nstrict liability in tort law, since neither is defeasible by a showing\nof blamelessness. The difference between the two regimes of liability\nis that only under fault can you avoid liability if you comport\nyourself as a reasonable person—in other words, if you act\nreasonably or justifiably—whereas you remain subject to strict\nliability even if you had sufficient reason for what you did.  Thus,\nfault liability, but not strict liability, can be undermined\nby justification. Some find it helpful to distinguish between strict liability and\nfault liability in terms of the content of the underlying\nlegal duty. In the case of blasting—an activity traditionally\ngoverned by strict liability—the blaster has a\nduty not-to-injure-by-blasting. In the case of\ndriving—an activity traditionally governed by fault\nliability—the driver has a\nduty not-to-injure-by-driving-negligently. No matter how much\ncare he takes, the blaster fails to discharge his duty whenever his\nblasting is causally connected in the right way to another’s\ninjury or damage to someone’s property. In contrast, the driver\nfails to discharge his duty only when he injures someone\nnegligently. Analytical theories seek to interpret and explain\ntort law. More specifically, they aim (i) to identify the concepts\nthat figure centrally in tort's substantive norms and structural\nfeatures (the latter being the procedures and mechanisms by which the\ninstitution of tort law enforces its substantive norms) and (ii) to\nexplain how tort's substantive norms and structural features are\nrelated. Key substantive norms include the wrongs that tort recognizes\nand the remedies that it provides for those wrongs. Key structural\nfeatures include the fact that tort suits are brought by the victim\nrather than by the state and the fact that such suits are\n“bilateral”: victims (plaintiffs) sue their putative\ninjurers instead of drawing on a common pool of resources, as in New\nZealand’s accident compensation scheme (which was adopted as a\nsubstitute for tort law). Normative theories seek to justify or reform tort\nlaw.  Justificatory theories aim to provide tort with a normative\ngrounding, often by defending the values tort embodies or the goals it\naims to achieve. Reformist theories seek to improve tort law,\nsay, by recommending changes that would bring the institution closer\nin line with its core values or would help it do a better job of\nachieving its goals. The distinction between analytical and normative theories is not\nexclusive. On the contrary, few analytical theories are altogether\ndevoid of normative elements and no normative theory is ever devoid of\nanalytical elements. Analytical theories frequently invoke concepts\nthat are fundamentally normative, since such theories (following\nDworkin) often seek to portray tort's substantive norms and structural\nfeatures in their “best light”. All the more so, normative\ntheories are always at least partly analytical, since such theories\nmust either provide or presuppose some account of the institution they\nseek to justify or reform. Along another axis, we can distinguish between theories of tort\nbased on whether they are instrumental or non-instrumental. (This\ndistinction cuts across the distinction between the analytical and the\nnormative.) Instrumental theories regard tort's essential features as\nexplicable in terms of an overarching purpose, typically, the\nremediation of some social problem, such as the problem of allocating\nthe costs of life's misfortunes. These theories do not always agree on\nthe specific principles that govern (or ought to govern) the\nallocation of costs. This is in part because they disagree about\nthe further purposes that tort serves (or ought to serve) in\nallocating costs. Some theorists believe that tort aims (or ought to\naim) at allocating costs efficiently. Others believe that\ntort aims (or ought to aim) at allocating costs fairly. Both\nsorts of theorist treat tort instrumentally, as a tool for solving a\nsocial problem. In contrast, non-instrumental theorists do not see\ntort primarily as responding to a social problem. They believe that\ntort is better understood as a way of giving expression to certain\nmoral or political principles. For many decades now, an economic analysis of tort law has been\nascendant, especially (but not only) in American law schools. Rather\nthan surveying the range of economic theories, this entry focuses in\ndepth on what is arguably the dominant strain of economic analysis:\noptimal deterrence theory. Proponents of this approach, like economic\nanalysts more generally, see tort liability primarily as a mode of\nallocating the costs of accidents (though an economic analysis can be\nextended to cover intentional torts, like assault and battery, too).\nTheir principal claim is that tort should be understood as aiming to\nminimize the sum of the costs of accidents and the costs of avoiding\nthem. Since shifting costs is itself costly, economic analysis begins\nwith the following question: when is it worth incurring costs in order\nto shift costs? The obvious answer is that it makes sense to incur\ncosts in order to reduce costs only when doing so is itself cost\njustified: that is, when the cost incurred are less than the costs\navoided. This leads to the well known economic view that the goal of\ntort law is to minimize the sum of the costs of accidents and the\ncosts of avoiding them—so-called, optimal deterrence. Taking the relevant social problem to be the problem of costly\naccidents, economic analysts deem the paradigmatic tort to be that\nof negligence. The law holds a person to be negligent when\nshe imposes an unreasonable risk of injury on another. Imposing an\nunreasonable risk of injury is in turn a matter of failing to take\nprecautions that a reasonable person would take. But which precautions\nwould a reasonable person take? Economists offer the following answer: a precaution is reasonable\nwhen it is rational; a precaution is rational when it\nis cost-justified; and a precaution is cost-justified when\nthe cost of the precaution is less than the expected injury (the\nlatter being the cost of the anticipated injury discounted by the\nprobability of the injury's occurrence). Imagine that you are engaged\nin an activity that carries a benefit of $100 and an expected injury\nof $90. Now suppose that the only way to prevent the injury is to stop\nthe activity. Other things being equal, you would be irrational to\nforego a benefit of $100 in order to avoid a cost of $90. Foregoing\nthe benefit would not be a cost-justified precaution; you’d\nrather incur the injury and keep the $10 profit from the activity. Now\nimagine that things are the other way around: the benefit is $90 and\nthe expected injury is $100. Under these circumstances, foregoing the\nbenefit would be a cost-justified precaution. You would be\nirrational not to forego the benefit, since you would have to\nincur a $10 loss to engage in the activity. This is the calculation\nthat a rational agent would make when the costs and benefits are his\nalone. As economists see things, the same standard of rationality should\napply when the benefit and the injury accrue to different\nparties. That is because the rationality of an action depends of the\nexpected costs and benefits and not on their distribution. If I can\nspare you some injury by taking precautions less costly than your\nexpected injury, my failure to take such precautions would be\nirrational, hence, unreasonable and thus negligent. Should you be\ninjured as a result of my failure to take those precautions, then I\nwould be at fault for your loss; and under the rule of fault\nliability, I would be required to make good your costs. By the same\ntoken, if I can spare you some injury only by taking precautions\ncostlier than your expected injury, my failure to take these\nprecautions is not irrational, hence, not negligent. If the injury is\ngoverned by the rule of fault liability, its costs will be yours, not\nmine, to bear. The rule of fault liability has much to recommend it from an\neconomic point of view. In particular, it induces all rational\npersons—injurers and victims alike—to take all and only\ncost-justified precautions. If all potential injurers behave\nrationally, losses will always lie where they fall: with victims.\nRational victims will therefore approach all accidents assuming that\nthey will have to bear the costs. But then they, too, will take all\nand only cost-justified precautions. So the rule of fault liability is\neconomically efficient: it produces an optimal level of\nrisk-taking. If fault liability is efficient, what are we to make of strict\nliability? Can it be efficient as well? Since someone facing strict\nliability will bear the costs of his conduct whether or not he is at\nfault, one might think that a potential defendant under a regime of\nstrict liability will have no incentive to invest in precautions. This\nis wrong. Suppose that I am strictly liable for some costs that I\nimpose on you—costs of $100. Suppose further that by taking $90\nworth of precautions I can eliminate the chance of my imposing these\ncosts on you. What is it rational for me to do? The answer is obvious.\nIt is rational for me to invest in $90 worth of precautions, since I\ncome out $10 ahead if I prevent the injury and thereby avoid liability\nfor it. So even under a regime of strict liability, potential\ndefendants have an incentive to take cost-justified precautions. And\nthey won’t take any precautions that are not cost-justified. If\nit would cost $110 to take a precaution that would eliminate the\nchance that you would suffer an injury with an expected cost of $100,\nI would prefer to pay for your injury than take the precaution. So\nstrict liability does not induce extra care. Under a regime of strict\nliability, potential defendants have an incentive to take all\ncost-justified precautions—just as they do under fault\nliability. In a crucial respect, the plight of the defendant (injurer) under\nstrict liability is identical to that of the plaintiff (victim) under\nfault liability. If we assume that the injurer is rational, we can\ninfer that under fault liability he will take all cost-justified\nprecautions. As a result, any losses that his conduct turns out to\ncause will lie where they fall: with the victim. This means that we\ncan characterize the victim as herself facing a sort of strict\nliability, namely, strict liability for losses not caused by another's\nfault.  (Strictly speaking, this is a misnomer, since one cannot be\nliable to oneself, but the analogy is nevertheless helpful.) The\nvictim cannot shift these losses to the injurer because the injurer\nhas insulated himself from liability by taking cost-justified\nprecautions. So the rational victim will ask herself the following\nquestion: which is lower—the cost of taking precautions or the\nexpected cost of incurring an injury? She will take precautions when\n(and only when) taking precautions is cheaper than remaining\nvulnerable to injury. The upshot is that strict liability and fault liability both induce\nrational persons to take all and only cost-justified precautions. If\nefficiency requires that individuals take all and only cost-justified\nprecautions, then strict and fault liability can both be\nefficient. If both rules can be efficient, why might we prefer one to the\nother? Strict liability and fault liability have different\ndistributional consequences. A rule of strict liability makes the\ncosts of the defendant's conduct higher than a rule of fault liability\nwould; he pays for the injuries he causes whether or not he has taken\nreasonable care to avoid them. A rule of fault liability raises the\ncosts of those who are injured relative to strict liability, since\nthey are compensated for fewer accidents. So if we have an independent\nreason to privilege the plaintiff's activity over the defendant's (or\nvice versa)—maybe we want less of the first activity to occur or\nwe feel that people should have to pay a steeper price for engaging in\nit—then we have an independent reason to prefer strict liability\nto fault liability (or vice versa). There is no doubt that economic analysis offers valuable insight\ninto tort law's capacity to increase overall safety and reduce the\ncosts of misfortune or bad luck. For all its insight, however,\neconomic analysis is vulnerable to difficult objections. These\nobjections speak both to tort's substantive norms and to its\nstructural features. We discuss some of the most significant\nobjections here. Many theorists believe that economic analysis offers a questionable\ninterpretation of the legal duty to behave reasonably. In\ncharacterizing negligence as the failure to take cost-justified\nprecautions, economic analysis identifies reasonable\nrisk-taking with rational risk taking. Economic analysis\neffectively invites us to determine what risks it would be acceptable\nfor a potential defendant to take on the assumption that he owns both\nthe resultant benefits and the resultant injuries. This way of\narticulating the fault standard treats an activity's costs and\nbenefits as being of the same importance regardless of where they\nfall. But what I owe you may not be the same as what I owe\nmyself. Indeed, it might be reasonable for me to be more solicitous of\nyour well-being than my own, since we might think me entitled to make\ntradeoffs with respect to my own well-being that I am not entitled to\nmake with respect to yours. Besides offering a questionable interpretation of the legal duty to\nbehave reasonably, economic analysis arguably fails to make good sense\nof the concept of legal duty more generally. The norms of tort law\nimpose duties not to injure. There are two questions we can ask about\nthese duties: What do they require of us? And to whom do we owe them?\nTort consequently distinguishes between a duty's content and its\nscope.  This is a distinction much emphasized by Judge Cardozo\nin Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road, the most famous\nAmerican tort case. In Cardozo's view, I have a duty to guard against\ninjuring those who fall within the ambit of foreseeable risk\nassociated with my conduct. Others might be injured by what I do, and\nwhat I do might be lamentable or mischievous, but those who fall\noutside the ambit of foreseeable risk have no claim against me in\ntort. This is not because my careless behavior does not injure\nthem. Ex hypothesi, it does. They have no claim against me\nbecause I have no legal duty to take their interests into account. The\nonly individuals who can have a claim against me in tort are those to\nwhom I have a legal duty. The problem for economic analysis is that\nthe duty restriction on liability is arguably incompatible with the\ngoal of inducing individuals to take appropriate precautions. In order\nfor injurers to have an incentive to take appropriate precautions,\neach must face the costs of his activity in full. But the duty\nrequirement allows injurers to displace at least some of these costs\non their victims. Economic analysts have responded to this problem\nalternately by (i) offering an efficiency rationale for the\nforeseeability limitation and (ii) arguing that the duty requirement\nis an imperfection in tort law. Economic analysis cares about the relationship between a particular\ninjurer and victim only to the extent that the nature of this\nrelationship provides evidence of the ability of either party to\nreduce accident costs. As far as economic analysis is concerned, there\nis no intrinsic reason why a victim should sue the person who injured\nhim.  Nor is there any intrinsic reason why a plaintiff should argue\nin court that the defendant wronged him, rather than that the\ndefendant was in a better position to reduce overall costs. The most basic relationship in our actual institution of tort law\nis the relationship between an injurer and his victim—not the\nrelationship between each litigant, taken separately, and the goal of\nminimizing the sum of the costs of accidents and the costs of avoiding\nthem. If the victim of another's mischief brings an action in tort, he\nbrings it against the person he believes has injured him, not against\nthe person best situated to reduce overall costs. We will learn the most from economic analysis if we view it as a\nreformist, normative theory, a theory that asks questions of the\nfollowing sort: What substantive liability rules have the greatest\nimpact on reducing the incidence of accidents at the lowest cost? What\nprocedural rules at a trial will induce those with relevant\ninformation to reveal it? What substantive and procedural rules will\nlead to optimal investments in safety? These are the questions of a\nreformer less interested in the actual state of tort law than in how\ntort law can be improved. Economic analysis is less convincing if its\naim is to illuminate the law from the perspective of a judge or a\nlitigant. Corrective justice theory—the most influential non-economic\nperspective on tort law—understands tort law as embodying a\nsystem of first- and second-order duties. First order duties prohibit\nconduct (e.g., assault, battery, and defamation) or inflicting an\ninjury (either full stop or negligently). (Some theorists believe that\ncorrective justice has nothing to say about the character of these\nnorms; others think that it helps define their scope and content.)\nSecond order duties in torts are duties of repair. These\nduties arise upon the breach of first-order duties. That second-order\nduties so arise follows from the principle of corrective\njustice, which (in its most influential form) says that an\nindividual has a duty to repair the wrongful losses that his conduct\ncauses. For a loss to be wrongful in the relevant sense, it need not\nbe one for which the wrongdoer is morally to blame. It need only be a\nloss incident to the violation of the victim's right— a right\ncorrelative to the wrongdoer's first-order duty. So understood, corrective justice neatly accounts for the central\nfeatures of tort law. It explains why tort law links victim and\ninjurer, since it takes the injurer to have the duty to repair the\nwrongful losses that he causes. And it explains why tort law presents\nitself as a law of wrongs, rather than as a tool for inducing\nefficient behavior. We can bring out what is distinctive about the corrective justice\napproach to tort law by contrasting it with various alternatives. From the standpoint of economic analysis, all legal liabilities are\njust costs of one sort or another. From an economic perspective, there\nare no significant normative differences among such things as\nlicensing fees, tort liability, and taxes: normative differences that\nwould in any event make a difference in how the law should approach\nthem.  From an economic perspective, the choice among them is based on\ntheir relative comparative advantages in securing the goals the law\nseeks to reach. All are tools for achieving social goals, and in some\ncases, taxes are better tools than licenses are. In other cases, tort\nliability is better than both. In many cases a mix of tools will prove\noptimal. The important point is that within the economic analysis, the\n“fit”or “aptness” of a response to wrongdoing\nis determined by its effectiveness in securing the aim in question;\nand in tort law, that aim is optimal deterrence. Tort liability is a\ntool that achieves that aim by shifting costs. In contrast, corrective justice theory maintains that tort\nliability is not simply a mechanism for shifting costs. A licensing\nfee imposes a cost, as does a tax, but we would not say that in\nlevying fees or taxes we are holding people responsible or accountable\nfor their wrongdoing.  In contrast, when we hold a defendant liable in\ntort, we say that he committed a wrong—assault, battery,\nnegligence, or the like—and it is in respect of that wrong that\nhe must be made to pay. For this reason, corrective justice theory\ninsists that different legal liabilities are not simply\ninterchangeable cost-shifting implements in the legal tool box, as\nthey can have radically different expressive consequences, and some\nare appropriate, apt, or fitting responses to the wrongdoing in\nquestion while others are not. Many theorists believe that a principle of retributive\njustice—say, that the blameworthy deserve to\nsuffer—does a good job of interpreting and justifying criminal\nlaw.  Yet most theorists think that such a principle does a rather\npoor job of interpreting and justifying tort law (except, perhaps, for\nthe part of tort law concerned with punitive damages). First, tort\nliability does not communicate condemnation, since (as explained\nabove) a defendant can be liable in tort even though he did nothing\nblameworthy. Second, the duty of repair in tort is treated as a debt\nof repayment, in that it can be paid by third parties—and not\njust when the creditor (the plaintiff) has authorized repayment. By\ncontrast, “debts” incurred as a result of criminal\nmischief can never be paid by third parties. You cannot serve my\nprison sentence. Third, a person cannot guard against liability to\ncriminal sanction by purchasing insurance. Yet it is common to\npurchase insurance to guard against the burdens of tort\nliability. Indeed, in some areas of life (e.g., driving), purchasing\nthird-party insurance is mandatory. Some theorists are skeptical of the idea that corrective justice is\nreally an independent principle of justice. Their concern is twofold:\nconsiderations that make corrective justice seem like a genuine\nprinciple of justice also seem to undermine its independence\nfrom distributive justice (justice in the distribution of\nresources); at the same time, considerations that support the\nprinciple's independence from distributive justice also seem to\nundermine its status as a genuine principle of justice. This twofold\nconcern stems from the fact that corrective justice requires the\nreversal of wrongful changes to an initial distribution of\nresources. If, on the one hand, some initial distribution of resources\nis just, then corrective justice seemingly does no more than require\nthat we return individuals to the position to which they are\nentitled merely as a matter of distributive justice.  This\nsuggests that corrective justice is but distributive justice from\nan ex post perspective rather than an independent principle\nof justice. If, on the other hand, an initial distribution of\nresources is unjust, then corrective justice seemingly requires that\nwe sustain, enforce, or entrench what is ex hypothesi an\ninjustice. This suggests that corrective justice is not really a\nmatter of justice at all: independent, yes; a genuine principle of\njustice, no. First Response: Corrective Justice as Transactional\nJustice. Some theorists respond by suggesting that we understand\ncorrective justice as a kind of transactional justice.  These\ntheorists identify the domain of distributive justice with the initial\ndistribution of holdings and take corrective justice to be concerned\nexclusively with norms of transfer, norms that govern whether\ndepartures from an initial distribution are legitimate.  Whatever the\nunderlying pattern of holdings, we can distinguish legitimate modes of\ntransfer from illegitimate ones. If agreement or gift moves resources\nfrom one person to another, then the mode of transfer is\nlegitimate. Never mind whether the resultant allocation of resources\nis unequal or unfair: that is a concern of distributive, not\ntransactional, justice. If fraud or force moves resources from one\nperson to another, then the mode of transfer is illegitimate. Even if\nan illegitimate transfer gives rise to an equitable distribution, the\ntransaction is unjust and must therefore be annulled. Second Response: Justice versus Legitimacy. Other\ntheorists respond by distinguishing between a\ndistribution's justness and its legitimacy. These\ntheorists allow that a legitimate distribution of resources may fall\nshort of being a fully just distribution. But they insist that a\n(merely) legitimate distribution can suffice to generate duties of\nrepair. Civil recourse theory agrees with corrective justice theory that\ntort's normative structure involves a variety of first-order duties,\nduties that establish norms of conduct. Yet civil recourse theory\ntakes a different view of the legal consequence of a first-order\nduty's breach. Whereas corrective justice theory holds that such a\nbreach saddles the would-be defendant with a second-order\nduty—in particular, a duty of repair—civil recourse theory\nholds that no such second-order duty results directly from the\nbreach. Rather, the breach of a first-order duty endows the victim\nwith a right of action: a legal power to seek redress from\nher injurer. That this power so arises follows from what proponents\nregard as a deeply embedded legal principle—the principle of\ncivil recourse—which says that one who has been wronged is\nlegally entitled to an avenue of recourse against the perpetrator. Civil recourse theory has substantial explanatory power. Perhaps\nmost obvious, it explains why tort suits have a bilateral\nstructure—why the victim of a tortious wrong seeks redress from\nthe wrongdoer herself instead of drawing on a common pool of\nresources. It also explains why tort suits are privately\nprosecuted—why the state does not act of its own accord to\nimpose liability on those who breach first-order duties. According to\ncivil recourse theory, the breach of a first-order duty gives rise not\nto a legal duty but to a legal power, a power the victim can choose\nnot to exercise. Furthermore, civil recourse theory accommodates a number of tort's\ncentral substantive features, features that arguably elude corrective\njustice theory. Prominent among these are (i) the fact that tort\noffers a variety of different remedies, only some of which are\ndesigned to restore the plaintiff's antecedent holdings, and (ii) the\nfact that the defendant incurs a legal duty to pay damages only upon a\nlawsuit's successful conclusion (either by settlement or by the final\njudgment of a court), rather than immediately upon the breach of a\nfirst-order duty. Despite its explanatory power, civil recourse theory is vulnerable\nto a potentially serious objection—or else it seems to leave\ntort law vulnerable to such an objection. Because civil recourse\ntheory offers little guidance as to what sort of redress is\nappropriate, the theory depicts tort law primarily as an institution\nthat enables one person to harm another with the aid of the state's\ncoercive power. Tort law may well be such an institution, of\ncourse. But if it is, it may be deeply flawed—indeed, it may be\nunjust. This problem can be posed in the form of a dilemma. Either the\nprinciple of civil recourse is grounded in a principle of justice or\nit is not. If the principle of civil recourse is grounded in a\nprinciple of justice, then civil recourse theory threatens to collapse\ninto a kind of a justice-based theory. If the principle of civil\nrecourse is not so grounded, then the principle apparently does no\nmore than license one party to inflict an evil on another. If that is\nwhat the principle does, we might reasonably wonder whether it can\njustify or even make coherent sense of an entire body of law. One way to rescue civil recourse theory from this objection is to\nsee it as a kind of corrective justice theory, though doing so\nrequires adjusting the picture of corrective justice presented\nabove. Earlier, we said that corrective justice requires that a\nwrongdoer repair the wrongful losses that she causes. But some think\nthis an inadequate account of corrective justice, since all too often,\nit is not possible for a wrongdoer to repair the injury that she\ninflicted on her victim.  When a victim suffers a serious bodily\ninjury, for example, it may be possible for the wrongdoer to pay her\nmedical bills or compensate her for lost wages, but the physical\ndamage the victim suffered is probably beyond repair. And the problem\nis all the more striking when the wrong involves a serious affront to\nthe victim’s dignity. For example, it is doubtful that a rapist\ncould repair the “loss” suffered by his victim. In cases\nsuch as these, we must find a way to respond to the wrongdoing that\ndoes not require repair, since repair is not possible. With this in\nmind, some have suggested that what corrective justice corrects is not\na disturbance in the prevailing distribution of goods brought about by\nthe wrong, but rather the expressive significance of the wrong. We do\ncorrective justice, on this picture, by responding to the wrongdoing\nin a way that reasserts the victim’s right. We cannot restore\nthe victim of a rape to the position she was in before the wrong, but\nwe can treat her rape as a wrong, and thereby reassert her right not\nto be raped. This picture of corrective justice can be used to ground the\nprinciple of civil recourse. If a person has a right not to be\nassaulted, for example, then we must treat an assault against her as\nwrong, so as to reassert that right. One way to do that is to maintain\na system of civil recourse, which entitles her to demand a remedy from\nanyone who assaults her. Oftentimes, repair will be a sensible form of\nrecourse, since ensuring that the plaintiff does not suffer the\nconsequences of the wrong will be one way of communicating that she\nhad a right not to be wronged in that fashion. But this approach can\nalso explain why tort allows victims to demand compensation even when\ntheir injuries are irreparable. The payment of damages in respect of\nthe wrong reinforces the victim’s right even if it does not\nrepair her injury.","contact.mail":"sahersh@umich.edu","contact.domain":"umich.edu"}]
