Bradley) of late nineteenth and early twentieth century\n‘Absolute Idealism.’\n\nBernard Bosanquet was born on July 14, 1848 in Rock Hall (near\nAlnwick), Northumberland, England. He was the youngest of five sons of\nthe Reverend Robert William Bosanquet by the latter’s second wife,\nCaroline (MacDowall). Bernard’s eldest brother, Charles, was one of\nthe founders of the Charity Organization Society and its first\nSecretary.  Another brother, Day, was an Admiral in the Royal Navy and\nserved as Governor of South Australia. Yet another, Holford, was\nelected to the Royal Society and was a fellow of St John’s College,\nOxford. Bosanquet studied at Harrow (1862–1867) and at Balliol\nCollege, Oxford (1867–1870), where he came under the influence\nof German idealist philosophy, principally through his\nteacher T.H. Green and the work of Benjamin Jowett. (Green reputedly\ndescribed Bosanquet as “the best equipped man of his\ngeneration” [Muirhead 1935, p. 21; McBriar 1987, p. 3].) Bosanquet received first class honors in classical\nmoderations (1868) and literae humaniores (1870) and, upon\ngraduation, was elected to a Fellowship of University College, Oxford,\nover F.H. Bradley. While at University College, Bosanquet taught the\nhistory of logic and the history of moral philosophy; his only\npublished work during this time was a translation of\nG.F. Schoemann’s Athenian Constitutional History. Upon the death of his father in 1880 and the receipt of a small\ninheritance in 1881, Bosanquet left Oxford for London, where he became\nactive in adult education and social work through such organizations\nas the London Ethical Society (founded 1886), the Charity Organisation\nSociety, and the short-lived London School of Ethics and Social\nPhilosophy (1897–1900). During this time he met and married (in\n1895) Helen Dendy, an activist in social work and social reform, who\nwas to be a leading figure in the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws\n(1905–1909). While in London, Bosanquet was also able to engage in philosophical\nwork, and many of his major publications date from this time. Some of\nthem—such as The Philosophical Theory of the State\nand Psychology of the Moral Self—were developed from\nlectures that he gave to adult education groups. He was an early\nmember of the Aristotelian Society, and served as its Vice President\n(1888) and President (1894–1898). In 1903, at the age of 55, Bosanquet briefly returned to university\nlife, as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of St Andrews\nin Scotland. His health, however, was not good and soon he wished to\ndevote more time to original philosophical writing. He retired in 1908\nto Oxshott, Surrey, where he nevertheless remained active in social\nwork and philosophical circles. In 1910, Bosanquet was appointed\nGifford Lecturer in the University of Edinburgh for 1911 and 1912. The\ntext of these lectures—The Principle of Individuality and\nValue and The Value and Destiny of the\nIndividual—serve as the most developed statement of his\nmetaphysical views. Understanding Bosanquet’s metaphysics, however,\nrequires recognizing that it reflects his earlier work in logic,\nethics, social work, and political philosophy. The publication of the Gifford lectures incited a good deal of\ncritical reaction to Bosanquet’s views, particularly in metaphysics\n(e.g., on the idealism/materialism controversy and on\nthe nature of finite individuality), logic (e.g., concerning the\nstatus of propositions and the nature of inference), and\nethics. Despite his vigorous participation in such exchanges, present\nthroughout Bosanquet’s work is his desire to find common ground among\nphilosophers of various traditions and to show relationships among\ndifferent schools of thought, rather than to dwell on what separates\nthem. In spite of the challenges to idealism from both within and outside\nof the academic world, discussion of Bosanquet’s work continued\nthrough the early decades of the 20th century. He died in\nhis 75th year in London on February 8, 1923. At the time of his death, Bosanquet was arguably “the most\npopular and influential of the English idealists”\n(Randall 1966, p. 488). He was the author or editor of more than 20 books and some 150 articles.\nThe breadth of his philosophical interests is obvious from the range\nof topics treated in his books and essays—logic, aesthetics,\nepistemology, social and public policy, psychology, metaphysics,\nethics and political philosophy. For his contributions to philosophy\nand to social work, he had been made a Fellow of the British Academy\nin 1907, and had received honorary degrees from Glasgow (1892), Durham\n(1903), Birmingham (1909), and St Andrews (1911). Bosanquet was one of the earliest philosophers in the\nAnglo-American world to appreciate the work of Edmund Husserl,\nBenedetto Croce, Giovanni Gentile and Emile Durkheim, and the relation\nof his thought to that of Ludwig Wittgenstein, G.E. Moore, and\nBertrand Russell is significant, though still largely\nunexplored. Although F.H. Bradley is today far better known in\nphilosophical circles, in his obituary in the Times,\nBosanquet was said to have been “the central figure of British\nphilosophy for an entire generation.” Bosanquet’s philosophical views were in many ways a reaction to\n19th century Anglo-American empiricism and materialism\n(e.g., that of Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Alexander Bain),\nbut also to that of contemporary personalistic idealism (e.g., that of\nAndrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, James Ward, Hastings Rashdall,\nW.R. Sorley, and J.M.E. McTaggart) and organicism (e.g., Herbert\nSpencer). Bosanquet held that the inspiration of many of his ideas\ncould be found in Hegel, Kant, and Rousseau and, ultimately, in\nclassical Greek thought. Indeed, while at the beginning of his\nphilosophical career Bosanquet described Kant and Hegel as “the\ngreat masters who ‘sketched the\nplan’” (Muirhead 1935, p. 21; see Bosanquet, Knowledge and Reality, p. vii), he said that\nthe most important influence on him was that of Plato. The result was\na brand of idealist philosophical thought that combined the\nAnglo-Saxon penchant for empirical study with a vocabulary and\nconceptual apparatus borrowed from the continent. Bosanquet is\ngenerally considered to be one of the most Hegelian of\nthe British Idealists, though the extent to which the term\n‘Hegelian’ is appropriate or illuminating in describing\nhis work has been a matter of some recent debate (Sweet 1995). More directly, Bosanquet’s thought shows a number of similarities\nto that of T.H. Green, his teacher, and to Bradley, his contemporary.\nBosanquet himself acknowledges that these similarities are far from\ncoincidental. He frequently admits his debt to Green’s works and, as\nlate as 1920, he wrote that\n  since the appearance of Ethical Studies… I have\nrecognized [Bradley] as my master; and there is never, I think, any\nmore than a verbal difference or difference of emphasis, between\nus.(Letter to Lello Vivante, 27 March 1920, cited in Muirhead 1935, p. 262) There is, however, at least some hyperbole in such comments.\nBosanquet did not follow either Green or Bradley blindly (see Sweet\n1996), and there are important differences in his work. While he\ndefended Green’s ethical theory and many of Green’s conclusions, he\naddressed a number of issues never dealt with in Green’s\ncorpus. Moreover, while it is clear that Bosanquet considered\nBradley’s work in metaphysics and ethics to have been momentous, this\nadmiration was no doubt influenced by the fact that Bradley’s\nphilosophy and method reflected interests and an approach that\nBosanquet had arrived at quite independently. Bosanquet’s earliest philosophical writing was in logic; his\ninterest in the area continued throughout his career, and it was\ninitially considered to be the area in which he made his most\nsignificant contributions to philosophy.  The first published statement of Bosanquet’s views on logic appears\nin his 1883 essay, “Logic as the Science of\nKnowledge.” Here, one finds an explicit debt to Hegel and to\nLotze (whose System of Philosophy he was encouraged by\nT.H. Green to translate and edit). Developed expositions of\nBosanquet’s logic appear in his Knowledge and Reality: A Criticism\nof Mr F.H. Bradley’s ‘Principles of Logic’ (1885) and\nin Logic, or the Morphology of Knowledge (1888). (The main\nthemes of this latter work were recast in a short volume, The\nEssentials of Logic [1895].) Bosanquet produced a second edition\nof his Logic in 1911, adding a number of notes and three\nchapters dealing specifically with pragmatist and realist criticisms\nof idealist coherence theory. During the last decade of his life he\nengaged in a number of exchanges on questions in logic, culminating in\nthe publication of Implication and Linear Inference (1920),\nwhich C.D. Broad described as containing “the clearest and most\nplausible account” of Bosanquet’s views (Broad 1920, p. 323).  For Bosanquet, logic is central to philosophy, but it is\n‘logic’ in a broad sense. He writes:\n  By Logic we understand, with Plato and Hegel, the\nsupreme law or nature of experience, the impulse towards unity and\ncoherence […] by which every fragment yearns towards the whole\nto which it belongs… (Principle of Individuality and\nValue, p. 340).\n \nThe “inherent nature of reason,” Bosanquet adds, is “the absolute\ndemand for totality and consistency” (Value and Destiny of\nthe Individual, p. 9). Moreover, logic— which Bosanquet calls “the spirit of\ntotality”—is “the clue to reality, value and\nfreedom” (Principle of Individuality and Value,\np. 23). Not surprisingly, then, Bosanquet argues that\nmetaphysics—“the general science of\nreality”—cannot be distinguished from logic—the\nscience of knowledge—any more than one can separate a result\nfrom the process which produces it.  Despite the connection between logic and knowledge, however,\nBosanquet denied that he was doing epistemology—in the sense of\na theory of cognition in which truth and reality are treated as\nindependent of one another.  In general, there are three key elements to Bosanquet’s\nlogic. First, logic is concerned with\n  the properties which are possessed by objects or ideas\nin so far as they are members of the world of\nknowledge. (Essentials of Logic, p. 44)\n \nEverything that can be studied must be ”asserted’ in\nconsciousness and, thus, is ultimately the concern of\nlogic. Second, Bosanquet writes that reality is\n  composed of contents determined by systematic\ncombination in a single coherent structure. (Logic, p. 5)\n \nTo have a complete description of some thing, then, it must be\nunderstood in its context and in its relations to other\nthings. Similarly, to say that a judgement is ‘true’, we\nmust take the system in which the judgement is bound up and then note\n  how unintelligible that part of our world…\nwould become if we denied that judgement.  (“Logic as the\nScience of Knowledge”, Works, vol. 1, p. 302)\n \nBosanquet’s view is best described, then, as a coherence\ntheory—though it is one that is concerned with more than the\nformal consistency of the set of true propositions. Third, according\nto Bosanquet,\n  the true meaning of propositions lies always ahead of\nfully conscious usage, as the real reality lies ahead of actual\nexperience (Logic, 2nd ed., p. x).\n \n Our understanding of the world, then, is always incomplete. Nevertheless,\n  experience forces thought along certain lines from\npartial to more complete notions. (“Logic as the Science of\nKnowledge”, Works, vol. 1, p. 311)\n \nCoherence, therefore, is attained by a dialectical, evolutionary\nprocess. But this does not mean that humanity will some day arrive at\nultimate truth.  \nBosanquet’s logic has been the subject of significant discussion; the\nfocus of this was, and still is, is the nature of inference and the\ntheory of induction.  In Implication and Linear Inference, for example,\nBosanquet defends his long-standing view that inference is\n“every process by which knowledge extends itself”\n(op. cit., p. 2). It is made possible by\nimplication—i.e., the property of each system whereby one can go\nfrom one part to all other parts. Standard formal logic (e.g., linear\ninference or syllogistic) is only a limited form of inference for, as\nBosanquet reminded his readers, logical principles are not part of\nsome abstract real but are the expression of the movement and life of\nthe mind.  Bosanquet considered induction as importantly related to deduction;\nin this respect, his views are similar to those of Christoph Sigwart\nand W.S. Jevons. To see specifically how induction and deduction are\nrelated, one must start with Bosanquet’s distinction between the verification of a hypothesis and its establishment. In induction, a hypothesis is\n“verified by the agreement of its deduced conclusion with\nobserved facts”; it is established only “in proportion as\nwe are convinced that the verified results could not be deduced from\nany other principle” (“Logic as the Science of\nKnowledge”, Works, vol. 1, p. 329). But then Bosanquet\nadds that “every verified result is pro tanto a confirmation of\nany principles from which it is deducible”\n(ibid.). Inference, then, is neither deductive (i.e., from\ngeneral principles) nor inductive (e.g., from instances or sense data, but “systematic”—it\nproceeds from within a whole or a system. Thus, knowledge does not\nexist as a set of isolated formal propositions; all that we know is\nwithin a system.  Bosanquet’s view of inference and of induction had significant\nconsequences, not only for the then-contemporary understanding of\nlogic—by challenging the view that deductive inference is\n“useless” (because those who know the premises already\nknow the content of the conclusion)—but also for the\n‘new’ logic of Frege, as developed by Russell and\nWhitehead, where judgement was separated from inference and\n‘linear implication’ was the norm. It is perhaps for this\nreason that Bosanquet’s arguments incited not only a wide-ranging\ncritical response—particularly from the\n‘neo-realists’ at Cambridge and in the United\nStates—but the tantalizing remark by Wittgenstein to Moore in\n1914 (cited in McGuinness 1988: 199–200) that some of\nWittgenstein’s (unsuccessful) Cambridge B.A. dissertation was\n“cribbed” from Bosanquet’s logic. Although Bosanquet’s logic follows, in many respects, that of\nHegel, it arguably avoids Bertrand Russell’s criticism of Hegel’s\nlogic—i.e., that it unconsciously assumes and incorporates the\nfaults of traditional logic. Indeed, Bosanquet’s defense of elements\nof classical deductive logic against J.S. Mill’s criticisms\n“made philosophy safe for logic” and was, in large part,\nresponsible for “rehabilitating” logic in British\nphilosophy, particularly after the critiques of Locke and his\nsuccessors (see Allard 2007). It has also been argued (by Fred Wilson\n2007) that Bosanquet’s views on logic and scientific method are close\nto those of some contemporary critics of empirical accounts of natural\nlaws, such as Fred Dretske and David Armstrong. Bosanquet’s publications on metaphysics date from the late 1880s,\nbut it was not until the early 1910s, when he was in his 60s, that he\npublished his comprehensive statement on the topic—his Gifford\nlectures, The Principle of Individuality and Value\nand The Value and Destiny of the Individual. It is important\nto realise that it was only after he had developed his views in\nethics, social work, philosophical psychology, and political\nphilosophy, that his metaphysics took its final form.  Bosanquet’s first essays on metaphysics—“Is Mind\nSynonymous with Consciousness?” and “What Takes Place in\nVoluntary Action?”—focused on the nature of mind, and in\n1893–94 he offered a course of lectures that became the basis of\nhis book, Psychology of the Moral Self (1897). Opposed to the\ncrude associationist and the ‘push and pull’ psychology of\nempiricists (such as David Hume, J.S. Mill, and Alexander Bain) who\nheld that thought consists of disconnected, discrete data of the\nsenses, and the ‘psychological habits’ that arise out of\nthe contiguous relations of these data, Bosanquet argued that one\ncannot separate the human individual from everything makes up its\nworld. A key interest of Bosanquet was the articulation of a theory of\nmind and will. In Psychology of the Moral Self, in a lecture\non “The Organisation of Intelligence”, Bosanquet argues\nthat “[t]he psychical elements of the mind are so grouped and\ninterconnected as to constitute what are technically known as\nAppercipient masses or systems” (op. cit., p. 42).  The\nmind or self, then, is a multiplicity of such systems. Bosanquet\ndescribes the mind, then, as “a growth of material, more like a\nprocess of crystallization, the material moulding itself according to\nits own affinities and cohesions” (op. cit.,\np. 9)—a view which, he says, is implicit in Plato and\nAristotle. In his Gifford lectures, Bosanquet moves beyond the discussion of\nmind in order to focus on a principle underlying much of his\nphilosophical thought and rooted in his studies in\nlogic—individuality.  In the first series of Gifford lectures, The Principle of\nIndividuality and Value, Bosanquet holds that when we speak of\n‘the real’ or ‘truth’, we have in mind a\n‘whole’ (i.e., a system of connected members), and it is\nby seeing a thing in its relation to others that we can say not only\nthat we have a better knowledge of that thing, but that it is, as Bosanquet writes, \n“more complete”, more true, and more real. Since this\nwhole is self-contained and self-sufficient, Bosanquet calls it\n(following Aristotle) an ‘individual’. But because of its\n‘independence’ and self explanatory character or\nnecessity, it is also a universal. The ‘whole’ is, then,\nwhat Bosanquet calls a “concrete universal”. This\n“logical universal as a living world” he calls\n“individuality” or “the Absolute”\n(op. cit., p. xx), and the metaphysical position he adopts is\noften referred to ‘absolute idealism’. According to Bosanquet, the “mainspring of movement and\neffort in [the finite] world” is “contradiction”\n(op. cit., p. xxviii).  Nevertheless, as principles come into\nconflict, a process of harmonisation also occurs. Terms are readjusted\nor new distinctions are introduced, so that conflicting elements find\na place in the result. This process or method of meeting and removing\ncontradiction, characteristic of the growth of any thing, is what\nBosanquet calls the argument a contingentia mundi, and it is\nthrough this process that we come to the Absolute.  Individuality is the principle of value. Since individuality is\n“logical self-completeness [and] freedom from incoherence”\n(op. cit., p. xxxi), Bosanquet holds that, in as far as\nthings are completely organised and have parts which confirm and\nsustain one another, they have value; it is not a matter of whether\nthey are, as in utilitarian accounts, desired.  In Bosanquet’s metaphysics, there is no rigid line between\n‘nature’ or the physical, and\n‘mind’. Bosanquet is clearly opposed to dualism; he sees\nthe mind as “a perfection and cooperation of the adaptations and\nacquisitions stored in the body” (op. cit., p. xxv) and\nnot a separate thing, independent of the body. Bosanquet’s\nanti-dualism does not, however, lead to panpsychism—the view\nthat all nature has consciousness. (In this respect he appears to\ndiffer from F.H. Bradley.) Still, he argues that nature is complete\nonly through human consciousness. Human consciousness serves,\nBosanquet holds, as a “copula” between nature and the\nAbsolute.  In the second series of Gifford lectures, The Value and Destiny\nof the Individual, Bosanquet focuses on how his theory of the\nAbsolute bears on the nature and value of the finite (i.e., human)\nindividual. He does so, first, by saying something of the evolution or\ndevelopment of the human person, as both a natural being and a being\npossessing a self-determining will; then, by looking at finite beings\nin relation to one another; and, finally, by showing how finite\nselfhood can have stability and security. Progress in\nthe development of the human individual, Bosanquet suggests, is not serial nor should it be seen as approximation towards a\ndefined telos. The destiny of the finite self is that it comes to\nrecognise itself as an element of the Absolute; it is in relation to\nthis, Bosanquet says, that one sees its value. Some critics responded that Bosanquet’s arguments radically reduced\nor eliminated the value of the human person because, they claimed, the\n“perfection of human personality” that he advocated was\nnot the development of a finite individual as a finite\nindividual. This issue was the focus of an important exchange among\nBosanquet, Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, G.F. Stout, and R.B. Haldane\non “Do Individuals Possess a Substantive or Adjectival Mode of\nBeing?” (Bosanquet et al. 1918). Here, Bosanquet asserts that\nindividuals characterise the world “as permanent\nqualifications”—but, at the same time, he reiterates his\nview that finite selves are not “necessarily eternal or\neverlasting units” (op. cit., pp. 86–87). Still,\none may say that while Bosanquet’s absolute idealism leads him to reject certain conceptions of the self, he does not\nreject its existence or its value. He simply denies that finite\nindividuals are wholly independent centres or ultimate principles of\nvalue. Recent scholarship by Mander (2005) and Sweet (1997a) suggest\nthat Bosanquet’s case was stronger than Pringle-Pattison’s. Although Bosanquet described his approach as\n‘idealist’, he was aware that the term was broad and\npotentially misleading. In work published after the Gifford lectures,\nBosanquet took pains to try to explain how his view was entirely\nunlike the subjective idealism challenged by G.E. Moore’s “The\nRefutation of Idealism” (1903) and, in “Realism and\nMetaphysic” (1917), Bosanquet suggested that his philosophy\ncould be more accurately described as “speculative”. Bosanquet pursued this issue of the character of his philosophy\nin The Distinction between Mind and its Objects (1913) and in\nthe last book to be published during his lifetime, The Meeting of\nExtremes in Contemporary Philosophy (1921). In The Distinction between Mind and its\nObjects—which dealt with common characteristics of American\nneo-realism and Italian neo-idealism (specifically, that of Benedetto\nCroce and Giovanni Gentile), and the relation of his own account to\nthat of philosophical realism and the neo-realists —Bosanquet argued that the terms\n‘idealism’ and ‘realism’ are both vague and\nmisleading. There are, as he notes, different kinds of realism and\ndifferent kinds of idealism as well. Moreover,the terms are not\nantithetical; in fact, Bosanquet saw some affinity between his\nposition and that of the realist Samuel Alexander. Nevertheless,\nBosanquet thoroughly rejected the views of such authors as R.B. Perry,\nW.P. Montague, and E.B. Holt. He argued that, while aiming at\nproviding a comprehensive view of reality, this ‘new\nrealism’ restricts the place of mind and cuts it off from\nphysical reality.  The very title of The Meeting of Extremes in Contemporary\nPhilosophy (1921) reveals Bosanquet’s conviction that, despite\nthe apparently radical differences separating them, there is a\nconvergence both in aim and in result of the investigations of the\ndifferent dominant philosophical schools —for\nexample, on such matters as the reality of time, positive development\nin ethics, and human progress. Bosanquet notes that, although there is\na clear disagreement among critical realists and absolutists\nconcerning the nature of ‘the real’, as each seeks a\ncomplete account, it is led to positions that are characteristic of\nits ‘opponent’. Bosanquet’s own “speculative\nphilosophy”—based, he maintains, on careful analysis of\nexperience—complements both of the preceding approaches. With a\nmore reasoned understanding of progress and a correct account of the\nnature of ‘individuality’ and the ‘unity’ of\nreality (where mind and its objects are seen together in a single\ncontext), the absurdities of the extremes of idealism and realism can\nbe avoided, and the opposition between them can be overcome.  Bosanquet’s philosophical views on religion were in large part\ninfluenced by early nineteenth century biblical\nstudies—initially, mediated through the writings of Green,\nEdward Caird, and Benjamin Jowett. The work of David Strauss, Ferdinand Baur, and others, at the\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, marked a turn in the scholarly\napproach to religion and scripture, towards what is now called\n‘the scientific study of religion’. Religious experience,\nsacred texts, and religious practice were now to be seen as phenomena\nopen to critical investigation and which could—and\nshould—be examined independently of one’s religious commitment,\nand according to the principles of literary and historical\nanalysis. Strauss and his followers challenged the tendency to equate\nreligious dogmas and creeds with original religious experience, and\nthey were particularly doubtful whether one could recover much\nknowledge of such experience from ‘events’ recorded in\nscripture. By the mid-nineteenth century, this approach to the study of\nreligion had established itself in Britain, particularly in Oxford.\nFigures such as Jowett and Caird, and others in the Church of England\n‘Broad Church movement’ (such as Frederick Temple, Bishop\nJ.W. Colenso, and Thomas Arnold) argued for a more analytical and rational approach to understanding religious\nbelief—though they were frequently criticised for this by Church\nauthorities. The distinction of practice from dogma and experience from creeds\nwas, however, also a feature of the evangelical movement within the\nChurch of England. Bosanquet, like many of his fellow idealists, was\nraised in an Evangelical household; his later philosophical views,\nthen, can be seen as an evolution, rather than an interruption or\ncontradiction, of his early religious convictions. Despite his conventional religious upbringing, Bosanquet was not an\northodox Christian. While he did claim that religion was not only\ncentral to one’s life, but was that which made life worth living, he\nheld that, taken literally or at face value, many particular religious\nbeliefs are either incoherent or false. Bosanquet notes that, in\nreligion, “rationalism, curiosity, metaphor, and deduction from\nmetaphor, operate by way of distortion” (What Religion\nIs, p.  68), and that, to help one read biblical texts, one must\nengage in a hermeneutical enterprise, and “learn to\ninterpret” them—though, even here, he doubted whether\n“the sacred books of a Church” can ever be “understood in their\nactual meaning” (Essays and Addresses, p. 132). Moreover, some religious beliefs do not mean\nwhat many take them to mean. Bosanquet argues, for example, that, if\nwe examine the idea of God—who is often described as an\n‘infinite individual—we will find that to attribute\n‘infinity’ to a being would be inconsistent with\n“every predicate which we attach to personality”. Finally,\nBosanquet held that religious belief in general is not about some\nsupernatural being or transcendent realm, entering into our daily\nlives. It focuses, rather, on what takes place in the world. His\nanalysis of religion and religious belief is, then,\n‘immanentist’. Bosanquet distinguished religious beliefs about particular persons\nor events from ‘religion’ (or, what was the same thing for\nhim, ‘religious belief as a whole’ or ‘religious\nconsciousness’). Still, he did not see himself as either an\nagnostic or atheist, or as reducing ‘religion’ to the\n‘ethical’. While he states that there is much in\nChristianity that is no longer intelligible, he insists that\nreligion—in the sense of religious consciousness—is needed\nfor morality, and that an ethics cut off from religion is\n“without sap or life”. Similarly, Bosanquet’s opposition\nto seeing religion or religious belief as a faith in something\nsupernatural does not mean that he denied the existence of the\nspiritual or held a reductionist view of reality. When\nit comes to human consciousness, he argued, the spiritual—the\n‘inward’ transfiguration of the ‘outward’\naspects of life—is at least as much a part of what exists as the\nvisible and material. This ‘infinite’ here is what\nBosanquet called the ‘Absolute’. Human beings are, Bosanquet noted, aware of something infinite that\nbears directly on their lives, and in his entry on Philosophy\nof Religion, for J.M. Baldwin’s Dictionary of Philosophy\nand Psychology (1902), he writes that it is this awareness, and\none’s commitment to\n  that set of objects, habits, and convictions, whatever\nit might prove to be, which [one] would rather die for than abandon,\nor at least would feel himself excommunicated from humanity if he did\nabandon\n \n that constitutes what religion is (Collected Works, vol. 1,\n p. 33). (While some idealists, such as Pringle-Pattison, seem to have\n held that such an Absolute is God, Bosanquet did not—though\n neither does he explicitly reject the existence of God.) Still,\n religious belief is neither the same as, nor tied essentially to,\n rituals and practices. Neither does it require adherence or assent to\n a set of propositions or dogmas—and certainly not to a set of\n propositions focusing on beings or events in the history of a\n community of believers. Religious belief is, in short, quite distinct\n from theism. In this, Bosanquet brings to completion\n views characteristic of many of the nineteenth-century British\n idealist philosophers (see Sweet 2014). While one finds religious belief and religious consciousness\nthroughout history and throughout the world, Bosanquet rejects the\nview that all religions are on a par. Religious consciousness has\nevolved, and higher forms of religion—i.e., those which show\na unity of the Divine and human nature—are the more\n‘true’. What Bosanquet is ultimately interested in, then,\nis religion in its highest or most developed form—what Caird\ncalled “Absolute Religion”. Though Bosanquet does not\ndevelop what, specifically, this means, his Gifford lectures give some\nhint as to the direction of his thought. Despite his criticisms of, and challenges to, Christianity,\nBosanquet believed that the world had benefitted from Christian\ncivilisation and culture, and that Christianity was a progress over earlier stages of religion. Moreover, he not only\nfrequently employed allusions to Christian religious belief and\npractice to illustrate his general views, but retained elements from\nChristian doctrine, such as the ideas of the atonement and of\njustification by faith—though in a highly modified form. The\ndoctrines of the atonement (to which Bosanquet often referred, using\nthe words of Goethe, as ‘dying in order to live’) and of\n‘justification by faith’ (which emphasised the presence of\nreligious consciousness in ‘works’) have a practical\nrather than a doctrinal significance. The former reflected the notion\nof ‘self-sacrifice’, involved in the achievement of\nself-realisation—where one had to ‘die’ to the\ndesires of one’s ‘private will’ in order to\n‘live’ as a more complete moral agent. And the latter was\na reminder that one’s actions could have a moral and spiritual\ncharacter only so far as they were carried out, out of a set of\n“dominant ideas” to which one was committed. Given his explanation of what religion is, Bosanquet holds that\nreligion is entirely consistent with reason. He insists that religious\nbelief as a whole is not superstition, and that it is true so far as\nit is an expression of a “nisus towards the whole”\n(Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 98). Again, since\nparticular religious beliefs purport to be cognitive, they must, at\nleast in principle, be able to be known by believers and non-believers\nalike. (He is, however, sceptical about the relevance of traditional\napologetics.) In both cases, the standard that Bosanquet employs in\norder to assess truth in religion is the same as that which he uses to\nassess the truth in general—namely, coherence. In his 2006 The God of Metaphysics, T.L.S. Sprigge\nendorses a broadly Bosanquetian account of religion, but raises a\nnumber of criticisms of Bosanquet’s account—particularly\nconcerning its implications for ethics. Sprigge argues, for example,\nthat by his assimilation of evil into the Absolute,\nBosanquet not only fails to take evil seriously, but encourages\npassivity, assuming that evil is either inevitable or will eventually\ndisappear on its own. The claim that Bosanquet’s absolute idealism\nentails such an attitude towards evil seems difficult, however, to\nsquare with Bosanquet’s concern for public welfare and interest in\nsocial reform (see Sweet 2007).\n Though Bosanquet’s analysis of religious belief reflects an\nunderstanding that, broadly speaking, was shared by a number of his\nfellow idealists, it is significantly different from other late\n19th century and early 20th century\nperspectives, such as those of William Clifford, John Henry Newman,\nand William James, and can be seen as an alternative to them. Given\nits immanentist character and insistence on separating religion from\ndogma and theology, it is close to the view of religion that one finds\nin recent work by R.B. Braithwaite, R.M. Hare, W. Cantwell Smith,\nD.Z. Phillips, and Hendrik Hart, and there is some similarity to the\ncontemporary ‘Sea of Faith’ movement, advanced by the\nAnglican theologian, Don Cupitt. Bosanquet’s views, like those of\nthese authors, have been challenged (for example, by C.C.J. Webb,\nFrançois Houang, and Alan P.F. Sell) for not only being inconsistent\nwith any orthodox theism, but as presenting in its stead a\nnon-realist, generic religion (which, some critics hold,\nis not religion at all). It is, however, important to recognise that\nBosanquet is not advancing a non-cognitivist or fideist view of\nreligion, and that he maintains that both religious belief as a whole\nand particular religious beliefs must meet appropriate rational\nstandards (see Sweet 2000). Bosanquet’s writings on art and aesthetics are not as well known as\nthose of the third generation idealist, R.G. Collingwood\n(1889–1943) or of his Italian late contemporary Benedetto Croce\n(1866–1952). Yet Bosanquet was the author of the first history\nof aesthetics in English—described by Monroe C. Beardsley as a\n“pioneering work” (1966: 14) that was the only\ncomprehensive study of aesthetics in English for half a\ncentury—and he was referred to by the literary scholar and\nOxford Professor of Poetry, A.C. Bradley as “the only British\nphilosopher of the first rank who had dealt fully with this branch of\nphilosophy [i.e., aesthetics]” (A.C. Bradley,\np. 570). \nBosanquet had a life-long interest in the arts, and his writings are\nreplete with examples and illustrations taken from them. He read\nwidely, particularly poetry, from the classics to the moderns, and for\nseveral years served on the (London) Council of the Home Arts and\nIndustries Association. Among his early works was a translation of The\nIntroduction to Hegel’s Philosophy of Fine Art\n(1886)—to which he wrote an important introduction—and he\nwas the author of several articles on aesthetics, A History of\nAesthetic (1892), a series of lectures on aesthetics given to the\nLondon Ethical Society (1895–96), and Three Lectures on\nAesthetic (1915).   Bosanquet’s aesthetics shows a debt to Hegel, to the Romantic\npoets, to the Arts and Crafts movement, and to the\nphilosophy of Hermann Lotze (1817–1881). Bosanquet was\nparticularly inspired by Hegel’s views on the function and the\ndevelopment of art, but he was also influenced by the Romantic\nmovement and its disciples (e.g., J.W. Goethe, F.W.J. Schelling, and\nWilliam Wordsworth—but also S.T. Coleridge, Robert Southey, and\nWilliam Blake), a movement that, interestingly, Hegel had\ndisparaged. The Romantics’ emphasis on unity, the importance of art as\na form of self-expression essential to the development of the self,\nand the organic conception of nature all have an important place in\nBosanquet’s work. But other Romantic themes were not adopted so\nreadily. Bosanquet rejected any emphasis of emotion over reason, and\nhe acknowledged the importance of limits to art and to\nartistic activity in general.   \nFor Bosanquet, art is revelatory of the ‘spiritual’\ncharacter of the world, and aesthetics is important because it is a\ndisciplined attempt to understand how artists and artworks contribute\nto this. Bosanquet’s work in aesthetics focused on four principal\nissues: i) the nature and evolution of aesthetic consciousness, ii)\nartistic production, iii) aesthetic appreciation—particularly,\nthe experience of beauty, ugliness, and the sublime in\nart, and iv) the role of art in the development of\ncharacter. Throughout, Bosanquet writes that he is simply following\nHegel’s lead—though his work is clearly a development rather\nthan a repetition of Hegel’s views.\n\n  The first issue, aesthetic consciousness, is discussed at length\nin Bosanquet’s A History of Aesthetic (and, to an extent, in\nhis introductory essay to The Introduction to Hegel’s Philosophy\nof Fine Art). In A History of Aesthetic, for example,\nBosanquet describes the gradual recognition, over the course of\nEuropean history, of art as a synthesis of content and expression. He\ntraces the continuity and ‘interruption’ in the\nunderstanding of art and the beautiful, from the classical Greek model\n(with its idea that “art... is symbolic”), through the middle\nages, to the beginnings of a concrete synthesis in Schiller and\nGoethe, and then towards a “synthesis of content and expression\nin that ‘characteristic’ which overmasters the mind and\nfeeling” (History of Aesthetic, p. 458) which he finds\nin Ruskin’s analysis of “the penetrative\nimagination”. While Hegel had earlier held that there was a\ndevelopment in consciousness over time—that at one point\nincludes aesthetic consciousness—Bosanquet was not committed to\nthe Hegelian claim that aesthetic consciousness developed\ndialectically.   For Bosanquet, aesthetics is importantly connected to metaphysics;\nunderstanding art and the work of the artist requires a broader\nmetaphysical and logical theory. (It is this relation between the\nmetaphysical and the aesthetic, developed in Bosanquet’s later\nwritings, that led Dorothy Emmet to write that Bosanquet’s Three\nLectures on Aesthetic was his “most successful book”\n[Emmet 1998: 28].) For Bosanquet, aesthetic experience was\ncharacteristic of the higher experiences we have that\ngive us insight into the full nature of reality, and features of such\nexperiences were features that one also finds in logic and\nmetaphysics. Art, then, can help not only in understanding other\naspects of the world, but by revealing something of the\n“spiritual” character of the world.   \nThe second major issue that Bosanquet focused on was what is—and\nwhat is involved in the production of—a work of art. Here, too,\nBosanquet’s treatment of this topic goes beyond Hegel’s; it also\nanticipates elements later found in Collingwood and Croce.   The creation of a work of art, according to Bosanquet, is an\nexpression of spirit or feeling; some see Bosanquet as articulating a\nnascent expression theory of art. Yet Bosanquet held that there is\nalso a content communicated in a work of art, and so it is\n“representative” (Three Lectures,\np. 57)—not in the sense of copying a natural object, but as\nembodying the ‘soul’ or essence of an object or a feeling\nin a new medium. (Here, Bosanquet is clearly influenced by Hegel’s\nview that beauty exists when the Idea is embodied in sensuous form.)\nWhile artists have some preconception of the effect they wish to\nproduce in the work of art, they also learn as they engage in the\nactivity itself. A work of art, then, is a product of a process of\nexpression, but this expression must normally be completed in an\nobject in the ‘physical’ world. Thus, Bosanquet insists,\nwhile a work of art originates in the subjective, it is also something\nobjective. He writes:\n  Feeling, […] in order to be capable of\nutterance in determinate form, must take on an objective character.\n(Value and Destiny of the Individual, p. 43)\n \nWhile some have suggested that Bosanquet’s account of the embodiment\nof a feeling in a work of art is unclear (Kobayashi 2009: 166),\nBosanquet would likely reply that such a concern is addressed by his\nview that a work of art is a “concrete\nuniversal”—that it possesses an organisation and a unity\nthat shows a relation of interdependence among its parts, and it\npresents certain general principles in a concrete form.\n The third principal issue that concerned Bosanquet is what happens\nwhen a person encounters a work of art, i.e., aesthetic\nappreciation. In his Three Lectures on Aesthetic, Bosanquet\nanalyses the “aesthetic attitude” which, he says, is an\nactivity not of the mind alone, but of the whole\nperson—“body-and-mind”. (This issue of the connexion\nof body and mind is discussed at length in Lecture V of The\nPrinciple of Individuality and Value.)  Although Bosanquet is an\nidealist, he is an objective idealist, and holds that, like\nperception, aesthetic experience involves the whole person.   On Bosanquet’s view, the aesthetic attitude is\n“contemplative”—it is a “preoccupation with a\npleasant feeling, embodied in an object which can be\ncontemplated” (Three Lectures, p. 10). But the work of\nart is also something in which the spectator finds his or her feelings\n“expressed”. Bosanquet writes that when we\n“imaginatively contemplate” an art object, we are\n“able […] to live in it as an embodiment of our\nfeeling” (Three Lectures, p. 30); there is no ultimate\ndistinction between art and the feelings it evokes in\nus. Moreover, the appreciation of a work of art requires understanding\nit as a whole or as a unity—and so it must be organisational. This organisational character refers not\nonly to elements or features within the art object itself, but to the\nenvironment in which the work comes to be. Further, Bosanquet argued\nthat art (and aesthetic consciousness) have their basis only in a\ncommunity. Art, then, is social and public—so far\nas both the artist and the spectator are epistemically dependent on\nthe communities in which they live.  \nBosanquet’s discussion of aesthetic appreciation in the Three\nLectures also addressed such questions as the forms of aesthetic\nsatisfaction and the different “kinds” of\nbeauty—beauty being understood as more than what is\naesthetically pleasing. It is here that most of the critical attention\nto his work (e.g., by John Dewey 1893) has been focussed.  Bosanquet\nargues that while beauty is sometimes\n“easy”—accessible to and recognisable by\nall—the excellence of certain beautiful items may be evident\nonly to those possessing “aesthetic insight”. Because of\nthe “intricacy” or complexity of the components of a work\nof art, some might consider an aesthetically excellent object to be an\nugly one. This, Bosanquet writes, is a mistake. Ugliness is, Bosanquet\nargues, strictly speaking a failure in expression. Ugliness in art\nmust not be confused with “difficult art”—i.e., art\nthat is beautiful, though many may fail to appreciate it.   Bosanquet’s fourth principal concern in aesthetics was with the\nrole of art in the development of character. In several early essays\n(from 1886 to 1890), he emphasised how art leads to an expansion of\nthe self—of the artist, in creating the work of art, but also of\nthe spectator, in appreciating the work. (Bosanquet followed William\nMorris and John Ruskin in holding that this result follows as much\nfrom “artistic handiwork” as from “fine art”.)\nIn the short term, aesthetic appreciation leads to a greater ability\nto appreciate not only art but life. But, as indicated earlier,\nBosanquet also maintains that in the long term—here, agreeing\nwith Hegel—art is a vehicle for the recognition of insights\nconcerning the unity of reality, and for an experience of something\ngreater than ourselves.   \nWhile Bosanquet’s aesthetics is close to the expression theory\nassociated with Collingwood and Croce, and while there is a continuity\nbetween Bosanquet’s work and Collingwood’s early studies in\naesthetics, Bosanquet was a sharp critic of Croce.  Bosanquet holds\nthat any adequate aesthetic theory must leave room for externality in\nart, and so he thinks that any theory that calls into question\n“the reality of the external world”—which he\nbelieves Croce’s does—cannot provide an accurate portrayal of\nthe unity of the world. Bosanquet also challenges, for example, the\nclaim that art is prior to the conceptual and the philosophical. He\nargues that Croce ignores that “the aesthetic attitude is\nlearnt” (“Croce’s æsthetic”, in Collected Works,\nVol. 1, p. 113), and that if language is just expression, not only are\nlogic and conceptual meaning are excluded from it, but we get a\nmetaphysical “singleness” without substance, content, or\n“definite meaning”. Finally, Bosanquet writes that Croce\nfails to provide an adequate statement of the relation between the\naesthetic, nature, and the metaphysical. By restricting the aesthetic\nto the realm of art, Croce ignores the role that the beauty of nature\nhas in calling us “out of ourselves” and to the\nrecognition of what is real.   \nBosanquet’s account of the production of the work of art and the\nnature of aesthetic appreciation is arguably an advance on Hegel, not\nonly in the understanding of art and aesthetic experience as something\nmore than a prelude to Religion, but in re-situating them within the\nhistory of the development of consciousness. (Consequently, he denied\nwhat he saw to be the Crocean interpretation of Hegel: that, at some\npoint, art—as uniquely expressing certain truths—would\ncease to have a function, and be superceded by another form of\nconsciousness.)  Moreover, Bosanquet’s view that art is an expression\nof emotion—later articulated and developed by Croce and\nCollingwood—may nevertheless be able to avoid some of the\ncriticisms raised against these later formulations. While Kobayashi\nhas argued that this account fails to explain how the aesthetic\nsentiment or feeling can be shared by the artist and spectators (2009:\n166), Bosanquet would likely respond that an explanation is to be\nfound in his account of the work of art as a concrete universal. Some\nrecent studies (e.g., by Morigi 2001) have suggested that there are\ninsights within Bosanquet’s work that warrant further investigation of\nidealist aesthetics, and others argue that Bosanquet’s analyses of\naesthetic judgement and aesthetic consciousness may plausibly bear on\nother fields (e.g., politics) concerning matters related to self\nconsciousness and our relations to other persons.   Bosanquet’s social and political philosophy is called\n‘idealist’ because of his view that social relations and\ninstitutions were not ultimately material phenomena, but best\nunderstood as existing in human consciousness. Writing largely in\nreaction to the utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill and to the\nnatural-rights based theory of Herbert Spencer, Bosanquet’s views show\nboth a strong influence of Hegel and an important debt to Kant and to\nthe classical Greek thought of Plato and Aristotle. Indeed, Bosanquet\noften spoke of his political theory as reflecting principles found in\nclassical philosophy, and one of his early works was a commentary on\nPlato’s Republic. Nevertheless, his political thought lies\nclearly within the tradition of liberalism. The main source for Bosanquet’s social and political philosophy\nis The Philosophical Theory of the State (1899 [1923; Sweet\nand Gaus (ed.) 2001]; See Sweet 1997b), though many of his ideas are developed in\ndozens of articles and essays which he wrote for professional academic\njournals, for publications of the Charity Organisation Society and for\nthe popular press. Like many of his fellow idealists (notably\nT.H. Green, D.G. Ritchie, William Wallace, John Watson, and, to a\nlesser degree, F.H. Bradley).  Bosanquet’s principal concern was to\nexplain the basis of political authority and the state, the place of\nthe citizen in society, and the nature, source and limits of human\nrights. The political theory that he developed is importantly related\nto his metaphysics and logic—particularly to such notions as the\nindividual, the general will, “the best life”, society,\nand the state. In order to provide a coherent account of such issues,\nBosanquet argued, one must abandon some of the assumptions of the\nliberal tradition—particularly those that reveal a commitment to\n‘individualism’. Bosanquet saw authority and the state neither as based on\nindividual consent or a social contract, nor as mere products of a\nsovereign, but as part of the natural development of humanity, and as\nexpressions of what he called the “real” or general\nwill. On Bosanquet’s view, the will of the individual is “a\nmental system” whose parts—“ideas or groups of\nideas”—are\n  connected in various degrees, and more or less\nsubordinated to some dominant ideas which, as a rule, dictate the\nplace and importance of the others [i.e., of the other ideas that one has] (Bosanquet 1893-94, p. 311).\n \nThus, Bosanquet writes that,\n  [i]n order to obtain a full statement of what we will,\nwhat we want at any moment must at least be corrected and amended by\nwhat we want at all other moments.\n \nBut the process does not stop there. He continues:\n  this cannot be done without also correcting and\namending it so as to harmonise it with what others want, which\ninvolves an application of the same process to them. (1899 [1923;\nSweet and Gaus (ed.) 2001]: 133)\n \n In other words, if we wish to arrive at an accurate statement of what\n our will is, we must be concerned not only with what we wish at some\n particular moment, but also with all of the other wants, purposes,\n associations and feelings that we and others have (or might have)\n given all of the knowledge available. The result is one’s\n “real” or the “general will”. Bosanquet sees a relation between the “real” or\n‘general will’ and the “common good”. He\nwrites that “The General Will seems to be, in the last resort,\nthe ineradicable impulse of an intelligent being to a good extending\nbeyond itself” (op. cit., p. 127). This\n‘good’ is nothing other than “the existence and the\nperfection of human personality” which Bosanquet identified with\n“the excellence of souls” and the complete realisation of\nthe individual. It is so far as the state reflects the general will\nand this common good that its authority is legitimate and its action\nmorally justifiable.  Bosanquet describes the function of the state,\nthen, as “the hindrance of hindrances” to human\ndevelopment. (op. cit., p. 189) The influence of Rousseau and Hegel is clearly evident\nhere (Sweet 1991). Bosanquet saw in Hegel’s Philosophy of Right a\nplausible account of the modern state as an “organism” or\nwhole united around a shared understanding of the good. Moreover, like\nHegel, he argued that the state, like all other social\n“institutions”, was best understood as an ethical idea and\nas existing at the level of consciousness rather than just material\nreality. Within nation states, Bosanquet held that the authority of\nthe state is absolute, because social life requires a consistent\nco-ordination of the activities of individuals and institutions. Still, although Bosanquet believed that the state was absolute, he\ndid not exclude the possibility of an organized system of\ninternational law (see Nicholson 1976). The conditions for an\neffective recognition and enforcement of such a system were, he\nthought, absent at that moment—though he held out hope that the\nLeague of Nations reflected the beginnings of the consciousness of a\ngenuine human community and that it might provide a mechanism by which\nmultinational action could be accomplished. Because the state can be said to reflect the general will that\nBosanquet claimed is also each individual’s real will, Bosanquet held\n(following Rousseau) that sometimes individuals can be required to\nengage in certain activities for their own good—that is they can\nbe “forced to be free”. Moreover, he maintained that it is\nin terms of the ‘common good’ that one’s\n“station” or “function” in society is defined,\nand it is the conscientious carrying out of the duties that are\nattached to one’s ‘station’ that constitutes ethical\nbehaviour. In fact, on Bosanquet’s account, it is primarily in light\nof one’s service in the state that a person has the basis for speaking\nof his or her personal identity. Not surprisingly, then, as Tyler\n(2006) points out, Bosanquet was frequently challenged by those who\nclaimed that he was anti-democratic and that his philosophical views\nled to a devaluation of the individual. Such attacks ignore, however,\nBosanquet’s insistence on liberty as the essence and quality of the\nhuman person and his emphases on the moral development of the human\nindividual and on limiting the state from directly promoting morality\n(which reflects both his own reading of Kant and the influence of\nGreen’s Kantianism.) Moreover, while Bosanquet did not hold that there\nwere any a priori restrictions on state action, he held that\nthere were a number of practical conditions that did limit it. For\nexample, while law was seen as necessary to the promotion of the\ncommon good, it could not make a person good, and social progress\ncould often be better achieved by volunteer action. (It is just this\nemphasis that Bosanquet found and defended in the approach to social\nwork of the Charity Organisation Society.) Although the state and law employ compulsion and restraint, they\nare considered to be ‘positive’ in that they provide the\nmaterial conditions for liberty, the functioning of social\ninstitutions, and the development of individual moral character. For\nBosanquet, then, there was no incompatibility between liberty and the\nlaw. Moreover, since individuals are necessarily social beings, their\nrights were neither absolute and inalienable, but reflected the\n“function” or “positions” they held in the\ncommunity. For such rights to have not only moral but legal weight,\nBosanquet insisted that they had to be recognized by the state in\nlaw. Strictly speaking, then, there could be no rights against the\nstate. Nevertheless, Bosanquet acknowledged that, where social\ninstitutions were fundamentally corrupt, even though there was no\nright to rebellion, there could be a duty to resist. \nIt is in his discussion of the nature, source, and limits of state\naction and of the nature of rights that Bosanquet introduces the topic\nof punishment. Bosanquet considers the three dominant theories of\npunishment—retribution, reformation, and prevention—and\nseems to find all defective; some have argued that, like Green, in the\nend Bosanquet does not offer a clear, consistent theory of\npunishment. Yet Bosanquet writes that “[t]he three main aspects\nof punishment [...] are really inseparable” (1899 [1923; Sweet\nand Gaus (ed.) 2001]: 215). Punishment is the response to an act of a\nbad will—and so it can be regarded as retributivist—but it\nalso has a properly preventive element, as well as a reformatory\ncharacter (since “the aim of punishment is to make the offender\ngood” (p. 206). The tension among these three theories has also\nled to the question of whether Bosanquet offers a “unified\ntheory of punishment”, and more recent scholarship, such as that\nof Brooks (2010), Crossley (2004), and Sweet (2000), all argue that\nthere is a way of reconciling the different theories, though they\ndisagree on the specifics of how that can occur.\n Although Bosanquet is sometimes regarded as a conservative, recent\nstudies have pointed out that he was an active Liberal and, in the\n1910s, supported the Labour Party. He insisted on the positive role\nthat the state can have in the promotion of social well being and he\nwas in favour of worker ownership. It is also worth noting that\nBosanquet’s audience was as much the professional social worker or the\npolitician, as the philosopher. He was well-informed of the political\nsituation in Britain, on the continent, and in the United States. His\ninterests extended to economics and social welfare, and his work in\nadult education and social work provided a strong empirical dimension\nto his work. This background supplied him with a broad base from which\nto reply to challenges from many of his critics—e.g., from\nphilosophers, like Mill and Spencer, and from social reformers, such\nas Sidney and Beatrice Webb and the founder of the Salvation Army,\nGeneral William Booth. Despite charges that Bosanquet’s political\nphilosophy is simplistic, inconsistent, or naive, Adam Ulam notes\nthat The Philosophical Theory of the State\n  has a comprehensiveness and an awareness of\nconflicting political and philosophical opinions which give it a\nsupreme importance in modern political thought.  Bosanquet is both a\npolitical theorist and a political analyst.  (Ulam 1951: 50)\n \n Colin Tyler (2002) argues that Bosanquet’s political thought can also\n provide a basis for the recognition of cultural diversity suited to a\n liberal, multicultural society. It has sometimes been suggested that the influences of Kant and\nHegel lead to a tension in Bosanquet’s political thought (see Vincent\n1982). Bosanquet’s emphasis on the moral development of the human\nindividual and on limiting the state from directly promoting morality\nclearly reflects a Kantian influence. Moreover, Bosanquet believed\nthat “the best life” that he describes as the\n“end” of the individual and of the state alike,\napproximates what Kant referred to as “the kingdom of\nends”. Even Bosanquet’s justification of the authority of the\nstate can be seen as a reflection of a Kantian imperative that one\nwills the state as a necessary means to the moral end. \nSoon after his move to London, in 1881, Bosanquet joined his\nhalf-brother Charles, and his friend and former classmate C.S. Loch,\nin their work with the Charity Organisation Society (COS). This led to\na lifelong association with the COS—one with which Bosanquet was\nindelibly connected. He was a Member of Council of the COS from 1898\nuntil his death, serving as Vice Chairman (1901–1915) and as\nChairman (1916–1917). He also served on Administration and\nDistrict Committees of the COS and was involved in the operation (and,\nfrom 1908–1912, served as Chairman of the Executive Council) of\nthe COS-sponsored School of Sociology and Social Economics from 1903\nuntil its incorporation into the London School of Economics in\n1912.  For Bosanquet, social work needed to be connected with education\nand, by extension, educational reform. Through his cousin Mary\nC. McCallum, Bosanquet learned about the Home Arts and Industries\nAssociation and its role in practical education and, starting in 1891,\nhe frequently lectured and taught university extension courses for the\nLondon Ethical Society (LES)—initially under auspices of the\nUniversity Extension Scheme at Essex Hall—and its successor, the\nshort-lived London School of Ethics and Social Philosophy\n(1897–1900). Many of his publications, including The\nEssentials of Logic, A Companion to Plato’s Republic for\nEnglish Readers, Psychology of the Moral Self,\nand The Philosophical Theory of the State, were based on or\nwere prepared as texts for these courses. Bosanquet’s lectures and essays on social topics deal not only with\ngeneral concerns on the role of social institutions and the state in\npromoting the good life, but on specific questions dealing with social\nreform. Many of these essays were published in the Charity\nOrganisation Review, but several were of a broad interest and\nappeared in leading philosophical and sociological journals and\nbooks. In Essays and Addresses (1889), Bosanquet advances an\n“ideal of modern life” which he calls “Christian\nHellenism”. There, in an essay entitled “The Kingdom of\nGod on Earth”, he gives an analysis of the relation between the\nhuman individual and the community that was taken up later in his\npolitical philosophy.  \nParticularly because of his COS work, Bosanquet was familiar with the\nempirical data on what was called “the social problem”,\nand he made extensive concrete proposals for social reform; one finds\nexamples of this in “In Darkest England” On the Wrong\nTrack (1891), his discussion and critique of Salvation Army\nGeneral William Booth’s programme for the alleviation of pauperism,\nand in Aspects of the Social Problem (1895), a collection of\nessays which he edited and to which he contributed six of the 18\nchapters. Bosanquet believed, however, that the key to social progress\nwas the development of individual character. It was this focus on character rather than social conditions that brought his views into conflict with a number of reformers,\nincluding the Fabian social radicals, Sidney and Beatrice Webb. In\nparticular, it led to the accusation that Bosanquet’s views were too\nindividualistic and out of touch with the root of the problem of\npoverty (see Hobhouse 1918: 78–79). This disagreement came to a\nhead during the sessions of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws on\nwhich both Helen Bosanquet and Beatrice Webb served. Some commentators\nhave noted that, when one examines their specific suggestions on\npractical policy, the differences between the Bosanquets and their\nopponents are more often over strategy than principle. For Bosanquet, education was not simply the acquisition of\nknowledge, but of values; his involvement in adult education was\ninspired both by his interest in bringing advanced formal education to\na larger population that had a more extensive life experience than the\ntypical undergraduate, but also by his views on art in the development\nof character. While an adequate education requires having some\nunderstanding of general principles, it also involves moral and\naesthetic values. In his early writings, but also in his later work,\nBosanquet is particularly concerned with how such values can be\ninculcated. In his two early essays on “Artistic Handiwork in\nEducation” (1887), Bosanquet argued for some form of handicraft\nwork being introduced into elementary and secondary education. This,\nBosanquet wrote, can contribute to the awakening, the enjoyment, and\nthe appreciation of beauty in nature and in art. Handicraft that has a\ndistinctively artistic character requires not only exertion through\nthe exercise of active apprehension, but also “seeing\ndeeply” into nature. Moreover, the study of works of art\nprovides a key to understanding both the culture and character of\nother nations but also universal human values. Similar views on education can be discerned in Bosanquet’s The\nEducation of the Young in ‘The Republic’ of Plato\n(1900), in his remarks on “How Could the Ethical Efficiency of\nEducation be Increased?” (1908), and in essays in Some\nSuggestions in Ethics (1918). In Some Suggestions in\nEthics, for example, Bosanquet distinguishes between\n“ignorance” and “stupidity”. Ignorance is the\nintellectual state of not knowing facts. But, more problematic for\nBosanquet, is stupidity—the “inability to see” or\nthe blindness to values—for it either distorts, or reflects a\ndistortion of, one’s “ideas concerning facts, objects and\ntruths” (op. cit., p. 236). For Bosanquet, then,\neducation should be primarily directed at improving character; it is\nthe remedy for “awakening interests and proportioning them to\nvalues” (op. cit., p. 237). This, however, requires\neducational reform in schools—concerning the atmosphere or tone of the school, the personality of the teachers, and\nthe organisation of work and play. Through the social activities\ninvolved in participation—particularly of the young—in the\narts or in artistic training, Bosanquet believed that society can\nfacilitate both the appreciation of beauty and moral excellence.   Interest in Bosanquet’s work—as with idealism as a\nwhole—waned during the middle decades of the 20th\ncentury. Of the idealists, the writings of Bradley and, in political\ntheory, Green, are now much better known.  There is no simple\nexplanation of this; many factors seem relevant. First, some of the work that made Bosanquet’s reputation in his\ntime—his popular essays, the books and articles that came out of\nhis university extension courses, and his involvement in social\npolicy—now seems largely dated. Bosanquet’s association with the\nmajority report of the Poor Law Reform Commission and his alleged\nchampioning of the nation state, led many to see him as a conservative\nif not reactionary thinker whose contributions to social and public\npolicy, and to political philosophy, were outdated almost as soon as\nthey had been published. It has been suggested, as well, that some of the concepts central\nto Bosanquet’s work are problematic or not clearly defined, and that\nseveral of his essays lack the logical rigor that one finds in\nmaterial destined for the more specialized audience of academic\nphilosophers. While insightful and wide ranging—and while\naccessible to a much wider audience than the work of other idealists,\nsuch as Bradley and J.M.E.  McTaggart—Bosanquet’s writings lack\nthe sharpness, the density, and, at times, the outrageousness of those\nof some of his contemporaries. It is also fair to say that Bosanquet himself was an indifferent\nliterary stylist. His work often betrays a looseness that one tends to\nfind in texts based on lectures prepared for general audiences or for\nclasses, and he wrote that “I usually rush my books, I get so\ntired of them” (Muirhead 1935: 131). His early work on logic was\nalso remarked upon for its “stiffness” (ibid., p. 58). But\nthese primarily stylistic issues may also be a consequence of\nBosanquet’s refusal to sever philosophical analysis from the\nexperience which Bosanquet was trying to investigate. There are other reasons that no doubt contributed to the decline of\ninterest in Bosanquet’s work. By the early part of the 20th\ncentury, philosophical idealism as a whole was seen by many as a\nphilosophical dead-end, with figures such as G.E. Moore, Bertrand\nRussell, and A.J. Ayer challenging what they saw as its irredeemably\nobscure vocabulary, as well as its questionable underlying speculative\nmetaphysics. \nNevertheless, the influence and legacy of Bosanquet, and of British\nidealism in general, should not be underestimated.  \nOne area in which today one sees a resonance or legacy is in political\nand social thought; Bosanquet’s arguments have been seen as at least\nclose—or even a preferred alternative—to the work of some\ncontemporary communitarians. Bosanquet’s emphasis on the importance of\na common good, on the social character of the individual, and on the\nfundamental place of substantive social ends within a community, are\nechoed in the more recent writings of Charles Taylor (1992) and Alasdair\nMacIntyre (1990). Other authors (such as Gerald\nGaus [1983, 1994, 2001]) see in Bosanquet’s work a model of a\nsubstantive liberalism. A second area that is beginning to be explored is that of\nBosanquet’s relation to philosophers of succeeding generations in\nBritain, such as R.G. Collingwood and Michael Oakeshott. Collingwood,\nfor example, discusses Bosanquet’s political philosophy in his\nunpublished “Notes Towards a Theory of Politics as a\nPhilosophical Science” (see Connelly 2002), and Oakeshott\nregarded The Philosophical Theory of the State as “the\nonly theory which has paid thoroughgoing attention to all the problems\nwhich must be considered by a theory of the State” (Oakeshott\n1936). Other areas that have been the subject of some recent study are\nBosanquet’s views on religion and on logic. Bosanquet is known to have\nhad an influence on the ‘social gospel’ of the English\ntheologian and future Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple. More\nbroadly, Bosanquet’s emphasis on the moral, and not doctrinal,\ncharacter of religious belief is, as noted earlier, reflected in\nrecent work in the study of religion. While many accept the standard\nview that idealist logic was problematic and no rival for the later\nlogic of Russell and Wittgenstein, it bears noting that, given\nBosanquet’s view of the centrality of logic to philosophy, he engaged\nand debated then-current developments in logic, such as that of Franz\nBrentano, Alexius Meinong, and Russell. For example, in the\nposthumously published Three Chapters on the Nature of Mind\n(1923), Bosanquet closely examines Russell’s account in The\nAnalysis of Mind, claiming that there were many points on which\nboth were in agreement, and that Russell’s view was not so much wrong\nas “too narrow”. It has also been argued that Bosanquet’s\nviews on logic and scientific method are close to those of some\ncontemporary critics of empirical accounts of natural laws.\n \nJust as the recent exploration of the origins of analytic philosophy\nhave led some authors to look more closely at its relations with\nBritish idealism, the intellectual roots of Bosanquet’s idealism also\nneed to be more thoroughly explored. Though Bosanquet’s debt to the\nwritings of Hegel and Kant is relatively well-known, there were a\nnumber of other important influences on his work (see Sweet 1995). Perhaps the most\nsignificant is that of classical Greek thought, and it is only\nrecently recognised that Bosanquet’s philosophy cannot be fully\nappreciated without am appreciation of his debt to Greek\nphilosophy. Finally, even as Bosanquet’s influence, and that of British\nidealism as a whole, diminished at home, they continued for some time\nafterward in other countries of the English-speaking world. Thus,\naside from the ‘third generation’ of idealists or\nidealist-influenced philosophers in Britain (such as Collingwood,\nMichael Oakeshott, and Dorothy Emmet), Bosanquet’s thought also had an\nimpact in English-language philosophy in Canada (with John Watson), in\nSouth Africa (with R.F.A. Hoernlé (see Sweet 2010), A.R. Lord (see\nSweet 2005), and Andrew Murray), and in India (with Hiralal Haldar,\nSarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and Benoy Ray) (see Sweet 2011).\n\n In recent years, then, there has been a renewed interest in\nBosanquet’s work—particularly concerning his philosophical and\nsocial thought. Given the number of studies published during the past\nthirty years on Hegel, Green and, more recently, Bradley, and given\nthe reevaluation of the significance of the work of British idealism\nand its place in the history of philosophy, there has been a steady\nreconsideration of the contribution of Bosanquet’s philosophy as\nwell.","contact.mail":"wsweet@stfx.ca","contact.domain":"stfx.ca"}]
