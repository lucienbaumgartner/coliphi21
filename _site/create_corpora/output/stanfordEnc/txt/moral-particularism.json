The strongest defensible\nversion, perhaps, holds that though there may be some moral principles,\nstill the rationality of moral thought and judgement in no way depends\non a suitable provision of such things; and the perfectly moral judge\nwould need far more than a grasp on an appropriate range of principles\nand the ability to apply them. Moral principles are at best crutches\nthat a morally sensitive person would not require, and indeed the use\nof such crutches might even lead us into moral error.\n\n\n\nThe particularist’s opponent is the generalist. Ethical generalism\nis the view that the rationality of moral thought and judgement depends\non a suitable provision of moral principles.\n\n\nThis entry provides a high-level introduction. For a more detailed\npresentation, see the entry on the debate between\n moral particularism and moral generalism.\n\n\n\n\nIf we are going to debate the question whether there is a need for\nmoral principles, we need some idea of what we mean by a ‘moral\nprinciple’. Unfortunately there are two radically different\nconceptions of what moral principles are. The first conception, the\n‘absolute’ conception, takes a moral principle to be a\nuniversal claim to the effect that all actions of a certain type are\noverall wrong (or right).  The principle ‘don’t break your\npromises’can be expressed in various ways: ‘it is wrong to\nbreak one’s promises’; ‘all actions that involve breaking a\npromise are wrong’—and so on. On the absolute conception,\nthese all mean that each and every action of breaking a promise is a\nwrong action, whatever else there may be to be said for it. Each such\naction is wrong overall, despite any redeeming features it may\nhave. \n\nThere is a very different way of understanding a moral principle, as\n‘contributory’ rather than as absolute. Understood in this\nsecond way, our principle maintains that if an action involves\nbreaking a promise, that counts against it. The action is the worse\nfor being a promise-breaking. Of course it may be the worse for being\na promise-breaking but the better for some other feature that it\nhas—that of being kindly meant, say. The contributory conception\nof moral principles allows that more than one principle can apply to\nthe case before us, since it holds that each principle is, as it were,\npartial; each specifies how things are only in a certain respect. But\nactions have many relevant features, some counting in favour and\nothers against. Whether the action is overall right or wrong can only\nbe determined by the overall balance of right and wrong in it. The\ncontributory principles do not themselves tell us how to determine\nthat balance. They only specify contributions one by one, and leave us\nto work out how these add up. Some people suppose that the principles\ncan themselves be ranked in order of importance; if that were right,\nit would be of some help to us in working out what matters most in a\ngiven case. Others suppose that there is no available lexical ordering\nof such a sort, and that the matter is left to unaided\n‘judgement’. \n\nSince there are these two quite different conceptions of what a\nmoral principle says, our discussion will need to address both\npossibilities. If particularism is true, there is not much room for\nmoral principles of either sort. \n\nIt is standard, at least in cultures informed by the Christian\ntradition, to think of the moral person as the person of principle.\nThis person is the person who has learnt, or developed for herself, a\nsufficient range of sound moral principles (of either type), and who\nhas sufficient skill at applying these principles to cases as they\ncrop up. There is no need to underestimate the sort of skill that\nwould be required for this; the matter is certainly far from\nmechanical. One needs judgement both to discern whether a principle\napplies at all and, if it does, what exactly it requires of\none. Nonetheless, however difficult it may be, moral judgement is\nconceived here as the application of principles to cases. \n\nIf moral judgement is a rational enterprise, it must be subject to\nconstraints of consistency. What is demanded of us when we are\nrequired to be consistent in our moral judgements? The answer is that\nwe are required to apply our principles consistently, that is, to\napply the same principle to similar cases. It is inconsistent to apply\nthe principle ‘don’t lie’ to cases involving one’s friends\nand not to those that involve strangers. If you want to behave in that\nsort of way, your principle is going to have to be ‘don’t lie to\nyour friends’. What this tells us, of course, is that consistency is\nnot the only requirement.  Our moral principles are supposed to be\nimpartial, and it is not obvious that the principle ‘don’t lie\nto your friends’meets this condition. But at least\nsomeone who takes it as his principle can tell the truth to his\nfriends and lie to strangers without inconsistency. \n\nWhy do we think of the moral person as the person of principle, and\nwhy do we think of moral judgement as subject to this sort of\nconsistency constraint? (As we will see later, there are other forms\nthat the consistency constraint could have taken.) The answer, I\nthink, is that we suppose that without moral principles there could be\nno such thing as the difference between right and wrong. Rightness and\nwrongness are peculiar properties, and the only way that an action can\nget them is by being related to a principle in one way or another. So\nunless there are principles saying which sorts of actions are right\nand which wrong, none would be right and none wrong. If this were so,\nit would hardly be surprising that the good moral judge would be the\nperson capable of following in her mind the way in which actions get\nto be right or wrong, which requires knowing the relevant principles\nand seeing that they have this effect here and that effect there. And\nit would be hardly surprising that consistency in judgement would\namount to no more than applying similar principles to similar\ncases. \n\nA rather different argument appeals not so much to a metaphysical need\nfor principles as to an epistemological need. If there is a\ndistinction between right and wrong actions, how are we to detect it?\nThere must be a detectable difference between the properties of the\nright ones and the properties of the wrong ones. Now if an action is\nwrong, it is wrong because of certain other features it has—the\nnon-moral features that make it wrong. Those non-moral features will\nbe detectable in the ordinary way, whatever that is. Good moral\njudges, having detected them, can somehow work out whether they make\nthe action right or wrong. But if this ability is not a matter of\nmagic, it must rest on an at least implicit knowledge of regularities\nconnecting the non-moral features of actions and their moral\nproperties. Moral principles specify such regularities. So if moral\njudgement is to be even possible, there must be a set of principles\nconnecting moral properties to non-moral properties, contrary to what\nthe particularist claims. \n\nIf this is our picture of the individual trying to decide what she\nought to do, how are we likely to conceive of the way to resolve\ndisagreements between two individuals? Of course there are the facts\nof the matter to be sorted out between them. Then presumably they have\nto try to agree at least on which principles are to be taken as\nrelevant (that is, to agree on the principles, and to agree that they\nare the relevant ones in the present case). Finally, they have to\nagree on the course of action that those principles recommend in the\nsituation that faces them. This would be, as we might put it, a full\nresolution of any initial disagreement. Otherwise we are looking for a\ncompromise of one form or another. It is possible, for instance, for a\ndisagreement on the principles not to make any practical difference as\nthings turn out, so that it can be left to be sorted out another\nday. \n\nOverall, then, we are offered a way in which moral reasons work, and\nan account of the perfectly moral agent whose decision processes fit\nthe way the reasons work, that is, fit the way in which an action can\nget to be right or wrong. But the way moral reasons work is probably\nvery different from the way that other reasons work. Other reasons are\nnot principle-driven. Morality is special, since without principles it\nis impossible. (Remember that the two arguments given above for the\nneed for principles appealed to the special nature of\nrightness and wrongness, or of moral properties in general.) \n\nThe particularist believes, like the generalist, that the perfectly\nmoral person is the person who is fully sensitive to the moral reasons\npresent in the case. But the particularist paints a very different\npicture of what it is to be fully sensitive to those reasons. The\nparticularist picture is one which takes moral reasons to operate in\nways that are not noticeably different from the way in which other\nreasons function—more ordinary reasons for action, say, or\nreasons for belief rather than for action. Morality may be\ndistinguished by its subject matter, but moral thought does not have a\ndistinctive structure. \n\nIf we are to form a view about what a full sensitivity to the reasons\namounts, to, we need to have some picture of how moral reasons\nwork. The core of particularism is its insistence on variability.\nEssentially the generalist demands sameness in the way in which one\nand the same consideration functions case by case, while the\nparticularist sees no need for any such thing. A feature can make one\nmoral difference in one case, and a different difference in\nanother. Features have, as we might put it, variable\nrelevance. Whether a feature is relevant or not in a new case,\nand if so what exact role it is playing there (the ‘form’\nthat its relevance takes there) will be sensitive to other features of\nthe case. This claim emerges as the consequence of the core\nparticularist doctrine, which we can call the holism of reasons. This\nis the doctrine that what is a reason in one case may be no reason at\nall in another, or even a reason on the other side. In ethics, a\nfeature that makes one action better can make another one worse, and\nmake no difference at all to a third. \n\nParticularists suppose that this doctrine is true for reasons in\ngeneral, so that its application to moral reasons is just part and\nparcel of a larger story. For an example that comes from a non-moral\ncontext, suppose that it currently seems to me that something before\nme is red. Normally, one might say, that is a reason (some\nreason, that is, not necessarily sufficient reason) for me to believe\nthat there is something red before me. But in a case where I also\nbelieve that I have recently taken a drug that makes blue things look\nred and red things look blue, the appearance of a red-looking thing\nbefore me is reason for me to believe that there is a blue, not a red,\nthing before me. It is not as if it is some reason for me to believe\nthat there is something red before me, but that as such a reason it\nis overwhelmed by contrary reasons. It is no longer any reason at\nall to believe that there is something red before me; indeed it\nis a reason for believing the opposite. \n\nExamples like this establish the variability of reasons for belief.\nTurning to reasons for action, we might point out that in some\ncontexts the fact that something is against the law is a reason not to\ndo it, but in others it is a reason to do it (so as to protest, let us\nsay, against the existence of a law governing an aspect of private\nlife with which the law should not interfere). Examples of this sort\ncan be multiplied at will. They appear to establish the holism, or\nvariability of reasons for belief and of ordinary reasons for\naction. The particularist suggests that there is no reason to suppose\nthat moral reasons function in a radically different way from other\nreasons.  Indeed, there is a sort of presumption that they don’t. That\npresumption is partly grounded on the fact that nobody is able to say\nwith any confidence just which reasons are moral ones and which are\nnot. This means that providing a radical difference between the way in\nwhich reasons of the two sorts function should seem rather peculiar.\nBut the presumption is also partly grounded in the fact that the\ndifference suggested by the generalist is very radical, since it\naffects what one might call the very logic of moral thought. To\nsuppose that moral thought has a different logic from other thought is\nto adopt a bifurcated conception of rationality. Moral rationality is\nprinciple-bound, based on invariant reasons. Other forms of\nrationality are nothing like this at all. Particularists think that\nthis suggestion is very strange. \n\nThese points about holism or the variability of reasons need to be\nexpressed in different ways, according to the conception of principles\nthat they are aimed at—the absolute or the\ncontributory. Principles of both sorts aim to specify invariant\nreasons, but the reasons they specify are rather different in\nstyle. Absolute principles, which specify a feature or combination of\nfeatures that always succeed in making an action wrong (or right)\nwherever they occur, purport to specify an invariant overall reason,\nas we might put it.  Counter-examples to suggested principles of this\nsort will consist in cases where the supposed feature or combination\nof features is present but the action concerned is not wrong overall\n(or right overall).  Contributory principles are different. They\npurport to specify features that always make the same contribution,\nirrespective of context.  Counter-examples to suggested contributory\nprinciples consist of cases where the feature cited is present but\neither does not count at all or counts the wrong way (a supposed\nright-making feature actually making an action worse rather than\nbetter, for instance). Particularists take their holism to be a reason\nto reject any invariance of reasons, of either sort—whether at\nthe overall or at the contributory level.  Reasons as such, they say,\ndo not need to behave in this sort of way.  It is consistent with this\nto allow that there might be some invariant reasons. What the\nparticularist says, however, is that the possibility of morality in no\nway depends upon a suitable provision of invariant reasons of the\nsorts that principles are attempting to specify.  Principle-based\naccounts of morality, such as those that specify ten (or some other\nnumber) of basic moral principles (e.g., Gert 1998), are left looking\nrather peculiar. \n\nThe picture so far is that actions get to be right or wrong in a wide\nvariety of ways. Particularists are ‘pluralists’,\nbelieving that there is more than one morally relevant property. Many\nproperties (or features) are capable of making a difference to how one\nought to act, and are therefore capable of being morally relevant. But\na property can be relevant on one occasion and not on another, and can\ncount in favour of action here and against action there. Isn’t this\nall terribly confusing? If it is all as much of a mess as this, how\nare we capable of keeping track of it? Are we reduced to looking at\nthe case before us and hoping that the complex interrelations between\nthe various features that happen to be relevant here will just strike\nus, somehow? Is there no such thing as general moral knowledge that\none can extract from experience and bring to bear on a new case?\nParticularists need not deny this possibility. The question will be\nwhat form such general moral knowledge will take if it is not\nknowledge of the sort of invariabilities that particularism sets its\nface against, and that principles try to capture. I suggest that what\nthe experienced moral judge knows is a range of ways in which a\nfeature can contribute to determining how to act. There need be no\nhard core to this set of ‘sorts of contribution’, no\ncommon element, no limited set of paradigm cases. Instead, in\nunderstanding the practical purport of a concept such as\ncruelty, what one knows is the sort of difference it can make that\nwhat one proposes to do would be cruel, in a way that enables one to\nsee new differences made in situations rather different from those one\nhas encountered so far. Particularists may suggest that this is rather\nlike what one knows when one knows the semantic purport of a\nterm. In knowing the semantic purport (= the meaning) of\n‘and’, one is in command of a range of contributions that\n‘and’ can make to sentences in which it occurs. There need\nbe no ‘core meaning’ to ‘and’; it would be\nwrong to suggest that ‘and’ basically signifies\nconjunction. If you only know about conjunction, you are not a\ncompetent user of ‘and’ in English, for there are lots of\nuses that have little or nothing to do with conjunction. For example:\ntwo and two make four; ‘And what do you think you are doing?\n(said on discovering a child playing downstairs in the middle of the\nnight); John and Mary lifted the boulder; the smoke rose higher and\nhigher. Those competent with ‘and’ are not unsettled by\ninstances such as these, but nor are they trying to understand them in\nterms of similarity to a supposed conjunctive paradigm or core case.\nParticularists in ethics will want to say the same sort of thing about\nwhat one knows when one knows the practical purport of a concept; one\nbecomes familiar with its practical grammar. There is complexity,\nthen, but it is manageable complexity. \n\nThis tells us how particularists will conceive of moral deliberation,\nwhen an individual tries to work out for herself how to act. There is\nno attempt to bring principles to bear on the situation, but there is\nan attempt to work out what matters here and how it matters, in ways\nthat may involve an indirect appeal to the way things were or might be\nelsewhere. And when two particularists are engaged in dispute, it is\nnot as if they are reduced to saying ‘I see it this\nway’. There are ways of supporting or defending the way one\ntakes the situation to be. A particularist can perfectly well point to\nhow things are in another perhaps simpler case, and suggest that this\nreveals something about how they are in the present more difficult\none. There need be no generalist suggestion that since this feature\nmade a certain difference there, it must make the same difference\nhere. But our judgement can be informed, and indeed defended, by\nseeing the way in which a feature functions in situations that\nresemble the present one in various ways. What we learn is not how\nthings must be here, but how they might very well\nbe. Argument between two people who differ on the way to see the\npresent case can make progress as each brings to bear other situations\nthat are both appropriately different from and also appropriately\nsimilar to the one before them. There is no guarantee that\nthis process will lead to agreement, any more than the generalist\nunderstanding of how disagreements get resolved leads us to suppose\nthat all disagreements are resoluble, if treated properly. But things\ncan happen even where there is no guarantee that they will happen. \n\nFinally, in this section, how does the particularist understand\nsomeone who says ‘that is stealing, and therefore you should not\ndo it’? One way of understanding what is said here is as an\nabbreviated argument, which fully specified reads ‘that is\nstealing and stealing is always wrong; therefore that is\nwrong’. This reading introduces silent appeal to a\nprinciple—either absolute or contributory, according to one’s\nway of understanding ‘that is wrong’. And it suggests that\nwhat we have here is really an inference, or argument, with premises\nand a conclusion. This is not how the particularist is likely to see\nthings.  Particularism is likely to think of ‘that is stealing\nand therefore it is wrong’ as saying ‘that is stealing and\nwrong for that reason’. This is not an argument, and there is\nnothing going on here that really merits being called inference. It is\nsimply an account of the presence of a reason and a statement of what\nreason it is, that is, of what it is a reason for (or against). \n\nThe previous section tried to lay out the main aspects of the\nparticularist conception of moral thought, and of the way in which\nactions get to be right and wrong. Particularists do not, however,\nrestrict themselves to expounding their own view. Of course, they are\nlikely to say that their view is at least possible, and that\ngeneralism tends merely to assume otherwise and then to carry on\nblithely. The mere possibility that particularism should be true is of\nsome importance in the dialectic. But there are also reasons for\ndoubting whether any form of generalism can really be true. Some of\nthese have already emerged; these involved the attempt to establish a\nbroad holism of reasons, by appeal to examples. There are replies to\nsuch attempts, which we will consider in  \n Section 8 (below); \n the replies amount to the claim that, despite appearances, holism\nmust be false. \n\nIn the present section we consider reasons for thinking that morality\ncannot be a system of absolute principles. \n\nThe first reason is that absolute principles cannot conflict, and that\nif they cannot conflict a vital aspect of our moral lives (that is,\nconflict) has been left out of account altogether by any theory that\nsupposes that morality is entirely governed by absolute\nprinciples. \n\nIf two supposed absolute principles conflict in a single case, one of\nthem must be abandoned. Suppose, for instance that one principle says\nthat all actions of type A are wrong and another says that\nall actions of type B are right. Suppose also that no action\ncan be both overall wrong and overall right, and that it is possible\nfor an action to be of both types, A and B. Things\nare all right so far, but if there were an action of both types, one\nor other of the principles would have to have abandoned. But this\nmeans that we have no room for conflict.  What is meant by moral\nconflict here is not conflict between two individuals, but conflict\nbetween reasons for and against in a given case. There cannot\nbe that sort of conflict, if all reasons are specified in absolute\nprinciples, because if the reasons conflicted the principles\nspecifying them would conflict, and this would just show that one of\nthe principles was a fraud. Conflict would, then, never be more than a\nproduct of our own misconceptions. There would be no real\nconflict. \n\nWhat this criticism amounts to is the complaint that we need to be\nable to make sense of cases in which there are moral reasons on both\nsides, for and against. But we cannot do this effectively if all moral\nreasons are specified in absolute principles. Morality cannot,\ntherefore, be just a system of absolute principles. The only way in\nwhich we could continue to think of morality as governed by absolute\nprinciples is to suppose that there is only one such principle, so\nthat there is no possibility of conflict between principles, or to\narrange things in some other way so that the principles are incapable\nof conflict. (Even then, of course, there would be the worry that\nconflict is real, and that to arrange things so that conflict is\nmerely apparent is to erase something important.) We know of one\nposition that offers only one principle: classical utilitarianism. The\nargument against this ‘monistic’ position is rather\ndifferent. The argument is the direct claim that monism is false;\nthere is more than one sort of relevant property, or more than one way\nin which features can get to be morally relevant. So a position with\nonly one absolute principle is false, and one with more than one such\nprinciple cannot make proper sense of conflict. \n\nThe best form of generalism, therefore, probably tries to do the whole\nthing in terms of contributory principles—principles that\nspecify considerations that always count as contributory reasons. In\nthis picture it is quite possible for there to be reasons on both\nsides. The classic example of such a theory is W. D. Ross’s theory of\nPrima Facie Duties (Ross 1930, ch. 2). This is just an attempt to\nput into good theoretical order our untutored intuitions that there\nare many different sorts of things that can make a difference to how\nwe should act. There is a principle that says ‘Be just’,\nbut this does not mean that all just actions are in fact right; it\nonly means that the justness of an action counts in its favour, or\nthat an action is the better for being just. Sadly, an action can be\njust but still wrong for other reasons. This means that it can\nsometimes be morally required of us that we act unjustly. If it is,\nthere will be features of the situation that require it of us; perhaps\nwe owe an enormous debt of gratitude, or perhaps by this unjust action\nwe can save Holland from flooding. \n\nThe generalist who takes this line supposes, qua generalist,\nthat a feature that makes a difference in one case will make the same\nsort of difference in every case, and that there will be a\ncontributory principle specifying its regular contribution. This is\nwhat particularism is concerned to rebut. Particularists applaud\nRoss’s insistence that there can be many features of the situation\neach of which makes some difference to how one should act; they merely\nwant to say that the matter is not regular in the way that Ross, as a\ngeneralist, supposes. They have three points to make, then. The first\ninvolves producing counter-examples to suggested regular contributors.\nRoss supposes, for instance, in accordance with long tradition, that\nthe fact that one has promised to do something is always some\nreason to do it. A counter-example to this claim would be a case\nwhere, for peculiar reasons no doubt, the fact that one has promised\nto do something is either no reason to do it or even a reason not to\ndo it.  Suppose, for instance, that I have promised not to keep my\nnext three promises; what then? Again, does one always have at least\nsome reason to tell the truth? A little bit of ingenuity enables one\nto come up with a case in which the fact that this is true is a reason\nnot to say it. And so on. \n\nThe second prong of the particularist attack is to ask why we should\nsuppose that a feature that counts in favour in one case must count\nthe same way wherever it appears. To this question, I think, no real\nanswer has been produced. Generalists tend to point out that if one\nclaims that a feature counts in favour here and against there, one has\nsomething to explain. But the particularist is happy to admit this. It\nis true that if a feature counts in favour in one case and against in\nanother broadly similar case, there must be an explanation of how this\ncan be. That explanation will presumably be given by pointing to other\ndifferences between the cases. In the second case, perhaps, something\nthat is required for the feature to count in favour is in fact absent,\nthough it was present in the first case. Such explanations must be\navailable, and they can be found. None of this does anything to\nrestore a generalist conception of how reasons function. \n\nThe third prong of attack on contributory generalism involves asking\nfor an appropriate epistemology. How are we to tell, from what we can\ndiscern case by case, that this feature will function in the same way\nwherever else it appears? Ross, our paradigm generalist, holds that we\nstart with the recognition that this feature counts in favour here,\nbut that we can immediately tell (by a process which he calls\n‘intuitive induction’) that it must count in favour\neverywhere. The question is how this is supposed to work. What is it\nthat is discernible in one case and tells us that what we have here\nmust repeat in all other cases? (Ross rightly does not suppose that we\nlearn our moral principles by ordinary induction.) The standard, and\nprobably the only, answer to this question is wrong. This answer\namounts to an account of what it is to make a difference in a\nparticular case—what it is to be relevant here. That account\nunderstands a feature as relevant here if and only if, in any case\nwhere it is the only relevant feature, it would decide the\nissue. Now if this account of particular relevance were\ndefensible, we would indeed have some reason to suppose that what is\nrelevant here would be relevant in any other situation. For on each\nfurther situation it will still be true that if it were the only\nrelevant feature, it would decide the issue. So relevance is indeed\ngeneral relevance, on this showing. And this gives the generalist the\nepistemology he needs, for it is now easy to see how, in discerning\nthat this feature matters here, we immediately see that it would make\nthe same difference on every occurrence. For it is true of it on each\noccurrence that if it were the only relevant feature, it would decide\nthe issue. \n\nSadly, the account of relevance that this all depends on is not\ndefensible. It is, after all, true of any feature whatever that if it\nwere the only relevant feature, it would decide the issue. The word\n‘relevant’ appears within this formulation, and it cannot\nbe removed.  For if we said merely that if this feature were the\nonly feature, it would decide the issue, we would have said\nsomething that is probably both false and, worse, incoherent. It would\nbe incoherent because the idea that a feature could be present alone,\nwithout any other features whatever, is surely nonsense. The idea that\nan action could be merely kind, say, without having any other\nfeatures at all, makes no sense at all. Further, there may be some\nfeatures that can only be relevant if some other feature is also\nrelevant—features that (in terms of reasons) only give us\nreasons if some other feature is giving us reasons as well. For\ninstance, in the Prisoner’s Dilemma one prisoner only has reasons if\nthe other one does. If this can occur, any ‘isolation\ntest’ for reasons must miss some reasons out. Finally, trying to\nisolate the contribution of a feature by asking how things would have\nbeen if no other feature had made any contribution is, when one comes\nto think of it, a rather peculiar enterprise. It is uncomfortably like\ntrying to determine the contribution made by one football player to\nhis team’s success today by asking how things would have been if there\nhad been no other players on the field. So the notion of relevance\nthat is required as a basis for generalist epistemology is\nunacceptable. \n\nGeneralists have two possible replies to these attacks, assuming\nalways that they accept that many of the contributory principles that\nthey originally suggested have been refuted by counter-example. The\nfirst thing they can do is to complicate the principles. The second\nthing they can do is to restrict their generalism to a limited group\nof reasons. \n\nTaking the first tack, one might suggest that if the fact that one has\npromised is in some cases not a reason for doing what one promised to\ndo, there will be some explanation of this. Suppose that the\nexplanation is that what one promised to do was immoral. All one needs\nto do is to suck this feature into one’s account of the supposedly\ngeneral reason. So now the reason in ordinary cases will be that one\npromised to do it and it is not immoral. We might object that not even\nthis is always a reason. What if one’s promise has been extracted by\nduress? The response will be to suck that into the reason as\nwell. This reason is growing all the time; now it is that one promised\nto do it, that it is not itself immoral, and one’s promise was not\nmade under duress. This battle can continue; it has no obvious\nstopping point.  Still, we might say, eventually ingenuity will give\nout, and we will reach a (now very complex) specification of a reason\nto which we can think of no appropriate counter-example. \n\nBut note what has happened here. We started from a consideration that\nwe took to count in favour of our action, and we have ended with a\ncomplex specification of something that plays rather a different role.\nWhat we got at the end was more like an elaborate guarantee that\nsomething mentioned in the guarantee counts in favour of the action.\nConsider the promising example above. That I promised does, let us\nsuppose, count in favour of my acting. But that my promise was not\nmade under duress does not do that at all. It functions as an\nenabling condition, one in whose absence the first feature\n(that I promised) would not have been the reason it is. It is not\nitself a reason to do the action; that role is distinctive, and it is\nplayed here only by the fact that I promised. Note, further, that the\ncombination of that reason and this enabling condition is not itself a\n(further) reason in favour of doing the action. So the distinction\nbetween ‘counting in favour’ and ‘enabling something\nelse to count in favour’ is significant, as particularists see\nthings. What the generalist reached, in defending her supposed reason\nby complication, is therefore not itself a reason at all, but only a\nguarantee (when finally complete) that there is a reason somewhere\nwithin it. And why should we suppose that nothing can be a reason\nunless we can specify a condition that guarantees its status as a\nreason, and that it is only a reason when present in a larger state\nwithin which it is guaranteed to serve as such? No obvious answer\nsuggests itself. The whole enterprise of defending one’s reason by\ncomplication begins to look strangely irrelevant, and its product\nunnecessary. One would have thought that there can be reasons that can\nfunction perfectly well without this sort of guarantee. And the\nreasons given on behalf of generalism in \n Section 2 (above) \n do nothing to show otherwise. \n\nThe second generalist line of defence involves drawing in one’s horns\na little. Ross distinguishes between derived and underived prima facie\nduties. The underived ones are the duty to do the just thing, to act\nfor the best, not to cause harm, to keep promises, and so on. Other\nduties are derived from these. So there is, as we might put it, a core\nof invariability surrounded by a variable periphery. I might have a\nduty to go up to London today to see my son Hugh. But this duty is\nderived from a general duty to do what I have promised to do. As we\nmight put it, that Hugh is expecting to see me today sometimes gives\nme a reason to go up to London and sometimes does not; it is a\nderived, and therefore variable, reason. If it does give me a reason,\nit will because it is keyed in some way into an unvariable, underived\nreason.  So derived reasons are variable, and underived ones\ninvariant. On this account, counter-examples will only do damage if\nthey are aimed at the supposed underived reasons. (See McNaughton and\nRawling 2000.) \n\nA different version of this picture maintains that invariant reasons\nderive from the virtues (Crisp 2000). That an action is generous,\nhonest, just, thoughtful, or helpful is always a reason to do it. The\ninvariant core is given by the virtues, therefore, and the variant\nperiphery depends upon that invariant core. This last point is\nimportant, because this defence of generalism needs to show why it is\nthat morality requires a basis of invariance. Just to come up\nwith a few invariant reasons is nothing to the point. Those who\nsuppose they can seriously damage particularism by specifying a few\n(probably fairly complex) invariant reasons do little to show that\nmoral thought depends (as it was put in the Introduction above) on a\nsuitable provision of principles (which we are now understanding as\n‘invariant reasons’). The suggestion we are dealing with\nnow does well in this respect. We are offered an invariant core and an\naccount of why there must be such a core if moral thought is to be\npossible at all. \n\nOf course, for the suggestion to work, it must be the case that the\nvirtues function invariantly. Particularists are likely to say, for\ninstance, that an action can be considerate without necessarily being\nthe better for it. It may be considerate to wipe the torturer’s brow,\nbut this fact hardly functions as a reason to wipe, or makes his sweat\na reason for us to wipe it off. The torturer’s other activities\nprevent what would ordinarily give us a reason from doing so\nhere. Similarly, it may be that a cruel response is exactly the one\ncalled for in the circumstances; cruelty, according to particularists,\nneed not be an invariant reason. A generalist reply to these\nsuggestions depends on showing that similar remarks cannot be made\nabout (a sufficient range of) the other virtues. \n\nWhat is at issue between particularism and generalism is the nature of\nmoral rationality. Particularists maintain that there can be\nreasons—moral reasons—even if the features that give us\nthose reasons function variably rather than invariably in their\nreason-giving.  Generalists suppose that this is not possible. They\nclaim either that all reasons, when properly understood,\nmust function invariably, or that there is an invariant core even if\nthere is a variable periphery. To argue for the first claim, they\noften demand, for each reason, that there be a discoverable guarantee\nof its status as such. But until they have offered some justification\nfor this demand, their generalism will rest on nothing. Crisp’s\nposition is a model of the second approach because it offers an\naccount of why the variability that the particularist is so fond of\npointing to must be built around an invariant core. But I would say\nthat the supposed virtues do not in fact play the role required\nhere. \n\nParticularists are fond of saying that generalists will make bad\ndecisions. One reason for this is that generalism seems to validate\ncertain patterns of argument that particularists would think of as\ninvalid. For instance, a generalist might think ‘Feature F made\na difference in that case; so it must make the same sort of difference\nhere too’. If our decision in the second case was influenced by\nsuch ‘reasoning’, it would have been influenced by a\nmistake, according to the particularist. Particularism supposes that\none cannot extract from one case anything that is guaranteed to make a\ndifference to another.  They recommend keeping one’s eyes firmly fixed\non the case before one rather than trying to squeeze an answer to one\nproblem out of the answer to another. This does not show that there is\nnothing to be learnt from other cases. Particularists can even allow\nthat it might, on occasion, be impossible to see the right answer here\nif one does not work to that answer from consideration of other cases,\nsuitably constructed or provided by experience. One can perfectly well\nsay ‘this feature mattered there, and so it might well matter\nhere—I had better have a look and see whether it does or\nnot’. What one cannot and should not do is to say ‘it\nmattered there and so it must matter here’. So\nparticularists allow a relevance to moral experience; they are not\nreduced to just gazing vacantly at the case before them and coming up\nwith an answer that somehow seems appropriate. There is a practical\ndifference between particularism and generalism, but it is not\nthis. \n\nThere is another possible practical difference between the two. This\ncomes out when we consider two pretty similar cases of which we\nnonetheless want to make different judgements. Nobody supposes that\nthis is impossible. The question is rather what is rationally required\nof the judge in such a case. The generalist might end up demanding\nthat one make the same judgement in both cases unless one can provide\na principle that distinguishes them. The particularist, by contrast,\nmight demand only that one make the same judgement in both cases\nunless one can offer some reason for not doing so. Some, however,\nwould not even demand that. All agree that there must be some relevant\ndifference between any two cases of which one wants to make different\njudgements.  Might it be enough to allow that there is some such\ndifference, even though one has no idea what it is? Or is one\nrationally required to be able to make some suggestion about what it\nis? Or is one’s suggestion to be formulated as a possible principle\ngoverning all similar cases?  Particularists might be distinguished\nfrom generalists by their answer to these questions. \n\nPeople reject the persuasive charms of particularism for, broadly, two\nsorts of reasons: reasons to do with rationality, and reasons to do\nwith motivation. I take rationality first. Three points are made. The\nfirst and most direct is that thinking rationally requires at least\nthat one think consistently, and in ethics this just means taking the\nsame feature to be the same reason wherever it occurs. Particularism,\ntherefore, denies the rationality of moral thought. Second, what is\nthe difference between moral choice and choosing chocolates? The\ndifference is that when choosing morally we are required to make\nsimilar choices in similar circumstances; not so for the choice\nbetween rum truffles and peppermint creams. Third, what account can\nthe particularist give of our ability to learn from our moral\nexperience? Such moral self-education is certainly possible. An\nadolescent who has so far refused to accept that tact is a virtue can\nbe brought to see the importance of being tactful in a particular\ncase, and is then in a position to apply this knowledge more\ngenerally. The generalist can understand this as the extraction of a\nprinciple from an earlier case, which we then apply to later\nones. What can the particularist offer as an alternative account? \n\nOf these three points, the third is the hardest. The answer to the\nfirst is that, when we are thinking of reasons for belief, the sort of\nconsistency required of us is merely that we do not adopt beliefs that\ncannot all be true together. Why should we understand the consistency\nrequirement in a different way when we turn to moral reasons? Simply\nto insist that this is so must be to beg the question against\nparticularism. \n\nThe second question asks us to justify a distinction between matters\nof whim, such as the choosing of chocolates, and matters of weighty\nreasons, such as those involved in moral choice. But this need not be\na problem. Moral reasons as the particularist understands them occur\nin the one case and not in the other. Nothing at all like them applies\nto the choosing of chocolates (normally). This does nothing to show\nthat in morality, unlike in the area of whim, we are required to make\nsimilar choices in similar situations. There are quite enough other\ndifferences between morality and whim. \n\nThe third question asks us what relevance other cases do have to a new\ncase, if not the sort of relevance that the generalist supposes.  The\nanswer to this is that experience of similar cases can tell us what\nsort of thing to look out for, and the sort of relevance that a\ncertain feature can have; in this way our judgement in a new case can\nbe informed, though it is not forced or constrained, by our experience\nof similar cases in the past. There is no need to suppose that the way\nin which this works is by the extraction of principles from the\nearlier cases, which we then impose on the new case. \n\nSo much for one sort of complaint. I now turn to questions which focus\non motivation. The general idea here is that a particularist morality\nis a lax morality: without principles, anything goes. But there are\nvarious ways in which this thought can be built up. The first is just\nto say that morality is in the business of imposing constraints on our\nchoices. For there to be constraints, there needs to be regulation,\nand regulation means rules, and rules mean principles.  This, however,\nis just wrong. There can be fully particular constraints on action,\nand the judgement that this action would be wrong is surely just such\na thing. Constraints do not need to be general constraints, any more\nthan reasons need to be general reasons. \n\nAnother line is that the person of principle will be unbudgeable;\nhaving taken a stand on an issue, he will not be moved from it. A\nparticularist will not be like this. But here I have two things to\nsay.  First, nothing prevents a particularist from being of firm\nconviction case by case; an unbudgeable conviction need not be founded\non principle, but simply on the nature of the case. Unbudgeability and\nprinciple have nothing essentially in common. Second, even if it were\ntrue that a principled person will on some points be unbudgeable, the\nquestion is whether those points are the right points. The worrying\nthought is that they might not be—that in being driven by\nprinciple, our principled person will distort the relevance of\nrelevant features by insisting on filtering them through principles,\nin a way that is at odds with the falsehood of generalism. In my view,\nunbudgeability and principles go very badly together. Unbudgeability\nmay be a virtue in its place, but to be unbudgeably involved in a\ndistortion is not a great triumph. If you are going to be incorrigible\nyou had better always be right; incorrigible error is the worst of all\nworlds. \n\nA different suggestion is that morality has the sort of authority over\nus that can only be provided by a rule. Here, however, I think that\nparticularists should simply dig their heels in, and insist that moral\nreasons have all the authority they need already. She needs medical\nhelp, and I am the only person around to summon it. This situation\ndemands a certain response from me, in a way that has authority over\nme because there is nothing that I can do to get out of it. \n\nStill, we might say, there is the ever-present danger of backsliding\nin ethics; we see the right, but somehow cannot bring ourselves to do\nit. With principles, we have something capable of stiffening our\nwaning resolve. Without principles, we will fall short all too\noften. One answer to this is that it is an empirical hypothesis for\nwhich there is little real evidence. What is more, the need for moral\nstiffening only arises once we have already decided what morality\nrequires of us here, and the real question was whether that decision\nneeded to be based on principle. The point about backsliding does\nnothing to show that the decision from which we might otherwise slide\nneeds to have been made on principle. The supposed need for principles\ncomes after that decision, not before. \n\nMore to the point might be a worry about special pleading. This is\ndifferent from backsliding, because the special pleader is the person\nwho makes exceptions in their own favour. It would not be right for\nmost people to do what I propose to do, but I am special; so I am left\noff the moral hook that others are caught by. This sort of special\npleading occurs in the process of making our moral decision; it is not\nto do with motivation thereafter, as backsliding is. With backsliding\nI say ‘this is wrong but I am going to do it all the\nsame’; with special pleading I say ‘this would be wrong\nfor others, but not for me’. \n\nThe reason why there is a genuine worry about special pleading is that\none can always find some difference between this act and a plain duty,\nand there seems to be no way, within the resources available to\nparticularism, to prevent such differences from being appealed to by\nthose who, in bad faith, want to let themselves off the moral hook. A\nprinciple, we might say, would, or at least should, stop this sort of\nthing. \n\nWhat is really going on here is that we are appealing to principles to\nrectify a natural distortion in moral judgement. If such judgement\nfocuses only on the reasons present in the case before us, it is all\ntoo easy to twist those reasons to suit oneself. So we use principles\nto stop ourselves from doing that. But really the remedy for poor\nmoral judgement is not a different style of moral judgement,\nprinciple-based judgement, but just better moral judgement. There is\nonly one real way to stop oneself distorting things in one’s own\nfavour, and that is to look again, as hard as one can, at the reasons\npresent in the case, and see if really one is so different from others\nthat what would be required of them is not required of oneself. This\nmethod is not infallible, I know; but then neither was the appeal to\nprinciple.","contact.mail":"jdancy@austin.utexas.edu","contact.domain":"austin.utexas.edu"}]
