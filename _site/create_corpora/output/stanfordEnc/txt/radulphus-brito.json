He was part of the group of\nmedieval masters who later came to be known as the modistae,\nprincipally because of their common appeal to the notion of modes of\nsignifying (modi significandi) in their accounts of\ngrammatical congruence. Brito’s philosophical work is largely\nunexplored, even though it is a crucial link between the philosophical\ndiscussions of the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries. Among\nother things, he richly contributed to the development of medieval\nlogic and philosophy of language. In fact, one can fairly consider his\nlogic of intentions to be the pinnacle of the development of\nthirteenth-century Aristotelian logic. Brito was a prolific author,\nwho commented on nearly all the Aristotelian corpus. Almost his entire\nphilosophical work is extant, although most of it is unedited.\n\n\n\n\nOnly little is known about Brito’s life. Recent studies by\nWilliam Courtenay (2005) and Jean-Luc Deuffic (2002) significantly\nincreased our knowledge of his biography. He was born in the village\nof Ploudiry, in French Brittany, around 1270 and not later than 1273.\nHe was a master of arts in Paris from around 1290. He probably began\nthe study of theology in 1299, while still teaching in the faculty of\narts. He read Peter Lombard’s Sentences in 1308/09 and\nobtained his doctorate in theology in 1313/14. Brito became\n Provisor[1]\n of the Sorbonne at some point between 1312 and 1315 and kept this\nfunction until at least 1319. He also held several ecclesiastical\npositions, which is a good indication of both his prominence within\nthe university and excellent personal connections. Brito died in\n1320/21. \nBrito’s philosophical output consists mainly of\nquestion-commentaries on the corpus of Aristotle’s writings,\nBoethius’ logical corpus, and Priscian’s grammar. In all\nlikelihood, these commentaries were produced during his career as a\nmaster of arts in Paris in the 1290s. \nHis grammatical and logical works, which are those that have been most\nthoroughly studied, consist of the following\nquestion-commentaries: \nAlthough most of these works are only extant in manuscript form, there\nare editions of 1 (QPm-1980), 3 (QTB-1978) and 5\n(QPA-2016), and editions in progress of, at least, 2,\n4.1–4.2 and\n 7–9.\n Finally, there is a fifteenth-century edition (QR-1499) and\na Renaissance Greek translation by Gennadios Scholarios (Ebbesen &\nPinborg 1981–1982) of 4, as well as a number of partial editions\nof\n 4–10. See in particular Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982 \nfor an edition of the prooemium of\n 4.1.[2] \nMuch less studied is the remaining part of Brito’s philosophical\ncorpus, which consists of the following question-commentaries: \nMost of these works are also extant only in manuscript. There are\neditions in progress of 1 and 4.\n\nOnly 7 (QE-2008) and 12 (QDc-2016) have been fully\nedited. Regarding 3, the questions on De anima I\n(QDA-2012-I) and on De anima III\n(QDA-1974-III) are fully edited, and there is a partial\nedition of the questions on De anima II\n(QDA-2012-II). Finally, there are partial editions of 1,\n4–6 and\n 8.[3] \nAlmost completely unexplored are Brito’s theological writings,\nvirtually all of which are unedited. These include a question\ncommentary on Peter Lombard’s Sentences I–III,\nwritten in 1308/9 and preserved in the ms. Pavia, Biblioteca\nUniversitaria Aldini 244 ff. 15–54. In addition, Prospero di\nReggio Emilia reports a set of theological questions, preserved in ms.\nVaticana lat. 1086, ff. 156rv and 196r–208r (see QE-2008: 103).\nAnd F. Stegmüller has\nattributed to Brito a set of questions on the Psalms, also\npreserved in the Pavia manuscript (see QE-2008: 103). The authenticity of the two\nlatter items is still uncertain, however (see QE-2008: 103).\nPartial editions of the commentary on the Sentences are found\nin Rossini and Schabel 2005 and in QE-2008.  \nIn his commentary on Priscian Minor, Brito endeavors to show\nthat grammar meets the criteria a medieval discipline must meet in\norder to be considered a theoretical science. In doing so, he puts\nforth his own account of grammar as an independent theoretical science\nin terms of both subject matter and principles (for Brito’s\ntheoretical grammar, see Pinborg 1967; Rosier-Catach 1983, 1999, 2010;\nEbbesen 1998a.). Regarding grammar’s subject matter,\nBrito’s position is that, from the point of view of predication,\nsignificant speech (sermo significativus) is the general\nsubject matter. In fact, significant speech is:  \nHowever, from the point of view of attribution, the expression\n(oratio) can also be considered the subject matter of\ngrammar, as everything that grammar considers is in one way or another\nrelated to it (QPm; QPm-1980: 104). More\nspecifically, from the point of view of predication, the expression is\ndiscussed in the so-called Priscian Minor (books\nXVII–XVIII of Priscian’s Institutiones), which is\nexclusively concerned with the principles of grammatical expressions\nand with the demonstration of their features (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 107). \nThe principles of the grammatical expression—what makes an\nexpression grammatical—are the modes of signifying (modi\nsignificandi) of its constituent parts (Rosier-Catach 1995),\nwhich are the parts of speech (partes orationis), i.e., noun,\nverb, participle, pronoun, preposition, adverb, conjunction, and\ninterjection. The modes of signifying are, in turn, the formal\nconstituent features of these parts (QPm; QPm-1980:\n138–139). \nA part of speech is the result of a series of hylomorphic compositions\nstarting with articulated sound (vox). First, the word\n(dictio) is the result of the hylomorphic composition of an\narticulate sound (vox) and the relation of signification\n(ratio\n significationis).[4]\n This relation links the articulate sound to the thing signified\n(res significata, for res significata, see\nRosier-Catach 1995), regardless of the thing’s different modes\nof being (modi essendi; for modi essendi, see Donati\n2013). In fact, things and their modes of being are not identical. For\ninstance, a horse may happen to be a particular horse, a universal\nhorse, my horse, etc., but being particular, being universal, being\nmine, etc. are all different from being a horse. \nA part of speech (pars orationis) is the result of the\nhylomorphic composition of a word and a mode of signifying. The mode\nof signifying, in turn, is derived from some of the modes of being a\nthing may have (QPm; QPm-1980: 164). For instance, a\n‘walk’ has the mode of signifying of a qualified\nsubstance, because it indicates the action of walking as a qualified\nsubstance (QPm; QPm-1980: 192–193). This mode\nof signifying directly results from a particular mode of understanding\n(modus intelligendi) the action of walking, namely from\nunderstanding it as a qualified substance. Generally speaking, then,\nthe modes of signifying are taken from their corresponding modes of\nunderstanding; and the modes of understanding, in turn, are taken from\nthe modes of being of things. This is, in fact, the fundamental tenet\nof the modistic grammar to which Brito adheres: the modes of\nsignifying follow from the modes of understanding things, which in\nturn follow from the modes of being of things. Note, however, that a\nwalk is in itself an action and not a substance. But this is not a\nproblem for grammar’s scientific status because a grammatical\nitem takes its mode of signifying from the possible modes of being of\nthings and not necessarily from the actual modes of being of a\nword’s significate (QPm; QPm-1980: 164).\nConsequently, every mode of signifying is ultimately grounded in a\nreal mode of being, making the science of grammar grounded in\nsomething real.  \nHaving established that every mode of signifying corresponds, through\na mode of understanding, to a thing’s mode of being, Brito goes\non to introduce a distinction between active and passive modes of\nsignifying, as well as between active and passive modes of\n understanding.[5]\n The passive mode of understanding and the passive mode of signifying\nare the mode of being as understood and the mode of being as indicated\nby the part of speech, respectively. Therefore, although the passive\nmode of signifying, the passive mode of understanding, and the mode of\nbeing are features of the same thing, they are notionally\ndifferent. \nThe active mode of understanding and the active mode of signifying are\nthe intellectual apprehension of the mode of being and the\ncorresponding relation of consignification whereby the part of speech\nindicates that mode of being (QPm; QPm-1980: 153).\nHence, the active mode of understanding and the active mode of\nsignifying are both notionally different and features of different\nthings. Nevertheless, they are linked by a causal relation, because\nthe mode of understanding immediately causes the mode of signifying.\nThus, the active modes of signifying and understanding are similar\n(QPm; QPm-1980: 158). \nFinally, the active and passive modes of signifying are notionally\nidentical, but they are features of different things. This is because\none and the same relation of consignification is considered on the one\nhand as a feature of a grammatical item and, on the other, as a\nfeature of a thing. The same goes for the active and passive modes of\nunderstanding (QPm; QPm-1980: 170). \nSince grammar is mainly concerned with the principles of grammatical\nspeech, one could expect these principles to be the active modes of\nsignifying—the formal features of the words that constitute a\ngrammatical phrase. However, since the active modes are notionally\nidentical to the passive ones, Brito claims that, from a formal\nperspective, both the active and the passive modes of signifying are\nthe principles of grammatical constructions. The modes of being, on\nthe contrary, are the principles of grammatical constructions only\ninsofar as they are consignified by the parts of speech (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 173). \nA grammatical phrase is formed when the modes of signifying of its\nconstituent parts are compatible with each other (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 132). Hence, ‘a man runs’ is a\ngrammatical construction, because the mode of signifying of ‘a\nman’ (i.e., the mode of the qualified substance) and that of\n‘runs’ (i.e., the mode of being performed) are compatible\nwith each other. These modes of signifying are in turn compatible with\neach other because the modes of being that ‘a man’ and\n‘runs’ consignify are compatible with each other. \nAccording to Brito, logic is a theoretical science dealing with the\nmethods of scientific-knowledge acquisition (modi sciendi,\nhereafter ‘methods of knowledge’) (QsP; see\nEbbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 301). However, since the\nsyllogism is the method of knowledge par excellence, and that\nto which all the other methods of knowledge are subordinated, it can\nalso be posited as the general subject matter of logic. \nFor a medieval master like Brito, the science of logic is first and\nforemost contained in Aristotle’s organon (see entry on\n Aristotle's logic).\nHence, Brito’s account of logic as a science must explain the\ndivision of the organon into six treatises as a reflection of\na division of the syllogism into its different kinds (the\ndemonstrative syllogism, the dialectical syllogism, etc.) and its\nconstituent parts (simple words, assertions, etc.). Accordingly,\nBrito’s first division of logic proceeds as follows: the\nsyllogism considered only with regard to its moods and figures is the\nsubject matter of the Prior Analytics. The syllogism\nconsidered according to the alethic modality of its premises is the\nsubject matter of the Topics and of the Posterior\nAnalytics, the former dealing with the syllogism from probable\npremises and the latter with the syllogism from necessary premises.\nThe syllogism from apparently probable premises is, in turn, the\nsubject matter of the Sophistical Refutations. Now, since the\nsyllogism can also be analyzed with respect to its constituent parts,\nthe Categories deals with its simple parts—simple\nwords—insofar as they can be sorted into different kinds\n(substance, quality, quantity, etc.). Finally, the De\ninterpretatione deals with the complex parts of the\nsyllogism—assertions that become its premises and\nconclusion—as well as with the simple parts of the assertion,\ni.e., the subject and predicate terms (QsP; see Ebbesen &\nPinborg 1981–1982: 301 and 303). \nBrito also puts forth the most developed account of the\nthirteenth-century logic of intentions (for Brito’s logic, see\nPinborg 1967, 1971, 1975a; Ebbesen 1998a). His logic of intentions\nconsiders the subject matter of logic to be second\n intentions[6]\n (intentiones secundae), which are best understood as\nqualified fundamental concepts (first intentions). A first intention\nis the first intellectual apprehension of a thing—the\nunqualified concept that only grasps what a thing essentially is. A\nsecond intention, in turn, is a first intention qualified according to\none of the several modes of being that things have. For instance, the\nconcept of man can be understood as a substance because its content is\nthe substantial form of individual men, or it can be understood as a\nspecies because its content actually informs several individuals at\nthe same time, etc. (QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 307). \nSince first and second intentions are essentially related to a\ncognitive object, depending on whether the cognitive relation is taken\nfrom the side of the thinking subject or from the side of the object,\nfirst and second intentions can be abstract or concrete. Accordingly,\nman, insofar as it is known through its concept, is a concrete first\nintention; its concept is an abstract first intention. On the other\nhand, man, understood as a species of animal, is a concrete second\nintention; the concept of man thus qualified is an abstract second\nintention, etc. (QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 307). \nBrito goes on to claim that, more precisely, the subject matter of\nlogic is concrete second intentions. The subsequent division\nof logic must then correspond to a division of concrete second\nintentions. Such a division is deduced from the three cognitive\noperations of the intellect: apprehension, composition/division, and\ndeduction (Ebbesen and Pinborg 1981-1982: 309). A second intention\nqualifies the object of some of these intellectual operations.\nCorrespondingly, the Categories deals with concrete second\nintentions understood through intellectual apprehension (e.g., man as\nsubstance, whiteness as quality, etc.). De interpretatione\ndeals with concrete second intentions understood through composition\nand division (e.g., man as subject, white as predicate, a man being\nwhite as an assertion, etc.). Both Analytics, the\nTopics, and Sophistical Refutations deal with\nconcrete second intentions understood through deduction. In other\nwords, these treatises deal with things insofar as they are related to\na syllogistic process, e.g., with the premise that every man is an\nanimal (in the Prior Analytics), with the probability of a\nman being white (in the Topics), with the necessity of every\nman being an animal (in the Posterior Analytics), etc.\n(QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 309 and 311). \nOf particular importance is the difference between concrete second\nintentions as they are dealt with in the Prior Analytics on\nthe one hand, and in the Topics and the Posterior\nAnalytics on the other. For the Prior Analytics deals\nwith second intentions related to a syllogistic process, regardless of\nwhether its premises are probable or necessary, whereas the\nTopics and the Posterior Analytics deal with those\nsecond intentions whereby the premises are qualified as probable or\nnecessary, respectively. Therefore, while the Prior Analytics\ndeals with the intentions involved in a syllogistic deduction only\nwith regard to its mood and figure, the Topics and the\nPosterior Analytics deal with these intentions with regard to\ntheir probability and necessity (QsP; see Ebbesen &\nPinborg 1981–1982: 311 and 313). \nBrito’s logic of intentions also allows him to explain away a\nconcern that had troubled earlier commentators of Aristotle’s\nlogic, such as Nicholas of Paris and Robert Kilwardby, namely the fact\nthat simple words, such as ‘man’, are discussed in the\nCategories, De interpretatione and Prior\nAnalytics (see Mora-Márquez 2015b: 71). If, they thought,\na discussion of simple words belongs in logic at all, then at least it\nought to be found in precisely one treatise. However, since logic, for\nBrito, deals with man as a concrete second intention rather than as a\nword or a thing, the problem does not arise. In fact,\nthe Categories discusses man insofar as it is a substance;\nthe De interpretatione insofar as it is a subject of\npredication; and the Prior Analytics insofar as it is a term,\ni.e., the major, minor or middle term of a syllogism (QsP;\nsee Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 313). \nFinally, Brito’s logic of intentions results in a major\ndeparture from the logical tradition represented by Kilwardby and his\ncontemporaries: the exclusion of truth from the realm of logic (see\nMora-Márquez 2015b: ch. 4). According to Brito, logic does not\ndeal with truth because it does not deal with real things per se, and\nreal things, regardless of whatever second intentions they may fall\nunder, are the truth-makers of assertions (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 138–139). The truth of an assertion such as\n‘every man is an\n animal’[7]\n depends on a real identity holding between man and animal—a\nreal identity that is independent of the fact that man is a species, a\nsubject, a substance, etc. In other words, such an identity is\nindependent of the second intentions that qualify the cognitive\napprehension of man. Despite this, second intentions do play a role in\nthe validity of deductions that have ‘every man is an\nanimal’ as a premise, for second intentions are the principles\nof a syllogism’s validity. But they are not the principles of an\nassertion’s truth or falsity, and hence truth is no longer a\nlogical concern.  \nIn his question commentary on Aristotle’s De anima I,\nBrito asks about the subject matter of the science of the soul (for\nBrito’s psychology, see De Boer 2012, 2013). With respect to\nthis question, earlier scholars usually take one of two main opposing\npositions: the subject matter of psychology is either simply the soul,\nor it is the body that has a soul, i.e., the animate body. Brito opts\nfor the second position: the subject matter of the science of the soul\nis the animate body, with an emphasis on its being animated. Two\narguments are given to support his position: the science of the soul\nstudies the operations and features specifically related to the\nanimate body’s having a soul (growth, nutrition, sensation, and\nunderstanding). Hence, its subject matter ought to be the possessor of\nthose operations and features—the animate body. Accordingly,\nthis science does not study the soul, that which makes the animate\nbody animate, without any consideration of its relation to the body;\nrather, it studies the entire composite of body and soul, and more\nspecifically, the body that has a soul (QDA-2012-I: 276).\nTherefore, the science of the soul approaches the soul not as an\nentity totally detached from the body it animates, but rather as the\ncause of the set of operations and features that separate living\nbodies from inanimate ones. \nIn his commentary on De anima II, Brito goes on to discuss\nthe description of the soul as the substantial form of the living\nbody. The discussion is directly related to the debate between those\n(like Albert the Great) who describe the soul as the extrinsically\ngiven perfection of the living body, and those (like Thomas Aquinas)\nwho describe it as the living body’s intrinsic substantial form.\nThe first group of commentators refrained from describing the soul as\nthe substantial form of the body because this seemed too close to the\nmaterialist account of Alexander of Aphrodisias, who seemingly would\ndeny the possibility of the separation of the human soul after the\nbody’s death. Albert therefore describes the soul as that which\nextrinsically perfects (perficit) a material body that has\nlife potentially—a material body capable of performing the\noperations causally related to being alive. Aquinas, however, opts for\na description more in accordance with Aristotelian doctrine: the soul\nis the intrinsic substantial form of the living body, for that which\nseparates animate from inanimate bodies must belong essentially, and\nintrinsically, to animate bodies as their form. Brito, in turn, sides\nwith Aquinas and describes the soul as the substantial form of the\nbody. His position is supported by two arguments: a substantial form\nis that due to which something receives its specific name (e.g.,\n‘horse’); when this form is removed, its subject is called\nby that name only equivocally (e.g., a dead horse is called ‘a\nhorse’ only equivocally); since the soul is that due to which an\nanimate body is said to be animate per se, and since its removal makes\nthe body animate only equivocally, the soul must be the substantial\nform of the animate body (QDA-2012-II: 319). More\nimportantly, the substantial form is that due to which individuals\nbelonging to a natural kind can perform the specific operations that\ndistinguish them from other kinds belonging to the same genus. Hence,\nsince the soul is that due to which the animate body can perform its\nspecific operations of growth, nutrition, sensation, and\nunderstanding, the soul must be described as the substantial form of\nthe animate body (QDA-2012-II: 320). \nAccordingly, Brito also considers the animate body—the\nhylomorphic composition of body and soul—to be an essential\nunity—a unity where the body is the material part and the soul\nis the formal part (QDA-2012-II: 325). Like Aristotle, Brito\ndismisses as misleading the question about the metaphysical link that\nbinds soul and body together into an essential unity. In fact, there\nis no such link that could belong essentially and intrinsically to the\nanimate body. If there were, it would be either material or formal. It\ncannot be material, because whatever is material is also potential,\nand whatever is potential is unable to actually connect body and soul.\nIf it were formal, it would be either a substantial or an accidental\nform. It cannot be a substantial form, for then the animate body would\nhave two substantial forms—a possibility that Brito\ncategorically rejects. And it cannot be an accidental form, because\nthe possession of accidents naturally implies the possession of a\nsubstantial form that serves as their support. Hence, we end up with\nan additional substantial form that supports the accident that binds\nbody and soul. Consequently, the cause of the union of body and soul\ncan only be an extrinsic agent that does not belong essentially to the\nanimate body (QDA-2012-II: 326). \nBrito defends, then, the correctness of Aristotle’s definition\nof the soul as the act of an organic physical body that has life\npotentially. In keeping with the description of the soul as a\nsubstantial form, the soul is defined as that which essentially\nconstitutes the first actualization of the animate body. The rest of\nthe definition singles out the specific kind of body the soul\nactualizes. First, the body in question is natural and not artificial,\nfor the actualization of the body by the soul creates an individual\nbelonging to a natural kind and not an artifact like a table. Second,\nit is organized (i.e., organic), for it involves an interconnected set\nof fundamentally different parts whereby the different operations of\nthe animate body are carried out (QDA-2012-II: 328). Finally,\nit has life potentially, quite simply because there cannot be\nsomething actual in a certain respect that was not previously\npotential in the very same respect. In other words, one could not be\nan actual living being if one’s body did not first possess the\npotential to be alive (QDA-2012-II: 329). Consequently,\naccording to Brito, Aristotle’s definition of the soul correctly\nplaces the soul in the class of substantial acts or forms, just as it\ncorrectly singles out the specific kind of matter that this act or\nform actualizes—an organic physical body that has life\npotentially. \nBrito’s explanation of why the animate body must be organic also\nshows clearly his commitment to a faculty psychology. He says: \nEvery form that has several capacities and operations […]\nrequires its subject to have multiple organs in order to perform those\noperations; the soul has several faculties and several operations;\ntherefore etc. […] [T]he vegetative faculty has the capacities\nof nutrition, growth, and generation; and these capacities have\ndifferent operations: the capacity of nutrition must preserve the\nsubstance of what is nourished; the capacity of growth must lead it to\na perfect quantity (ducere ad perfectam quantitatem), and the\ncapacity of generation must preserve the species. The sensitive soul\nalso has multiple capacities: the capacity of sight, of hearing, of\nsmell, etc., which have different operations. Also, the common sense\nhas several capacities, as imagination (potentia ymaginativa)\nand memory (potentia memorativa). Therefore, the soul\nrequires multiple organs in its body in order to perform those\noperations. Also, the intellectual soul insofar as it is intellectual\ndoes not have a bodily organ; however, its operation depends on some\nbodily power (virtus) that is in an organ, i.e., on the\nphantasia. (QDA-2012-II: 328–329) \nConsequently, the parts of the organic body are the instruments for\nthe operations specifically performed by living beings; operations\nthat are divided into three different kinds: vegetative (bodily,\nnon-cognitive), sensitive (bodily, cognitive) and intellectual\n(non-bodily, cognitive). These operations must, then, correspond to\nthree specifically different faculties of the soul, which are\nresponsible for the actualization of the organic body’s\npotential with regard to those operations (QDA-2012-II: 343\nand 345). \nThe soul has two cognitive faculties: the sensitive and the\nintellectual. The sensitive faculty is bodily in the sense that its\noperations necessarily use bodily organs (QDA-1974-III: 102).\nThis faculty involves a set of powers that are divided into external\nand internal senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, and\ncommon sense, estimation, memory and phantasia,\n respectively),[8]\n depending on whether their operations are performed through external\nor internal organs (i.e., the eye, the ear, the tongue, etc., and the\nthree ventricles of the brain) (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 36). The\nmost complex animals must have both internal and external senses,\nbecause for their self-preservation they must have the capacity to\nform sense representations of external objects, whether they are\npresent or absent (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 35). All of these\nsenses perform different cognitive operations that take different\nobjects (e.g., sight takes color, hearing takes sound, estimation\ntakes the harmful and the useful, memory takes sensorial\nrepresentations, etc.) (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 38). Moreover,\neach of these senses contributes in a specific way to the formation by\nthe phantasia of a unified sensory representation (a\nphantasma) of an external object. \nThe intellectual faculty, in turn, does not use a bodily organ in its\noperations. According to Brito, however, every single case of\nintellectual cognition takes as a starting point a phantasma\nor image (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 40). This does not mean that the\nimage is itself the object of intellectual cognition. On the contrary,\nBrito emphasizes in several places that the object of intellectual\ncognition is the essence (quod quid est) of the thing\n(QDA-1974-III: 174; cf. QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 41). For\ninstance, what is known through intellectual cognition is neither the\nimage of the apple nor the external apple, but the essence of the\nexternal apple that is represented in the image. \nThe process of intellectual cognition of an essence involves two\noperations that correspond to two different powers of the intellectual\nfaculty: the operations of abstraction and intellection by the agent\nand the possible intellect. Since the essence in both the image and\nthe external thing has material existence, and since the object of\nintellectual cognition must be immaterial, it is necessary to\nintroduce a power that makes the essence immaterial. This power is the\nagent intellect—an active power that, through the act of\nabstraction, makes immaterial the essence materially represented in\nthe image (QDA-1974-III: 212). \nBrito rejects two alternative accounts that explain this act of\nabstraction either as \nThe former, (i), is rejected because whatever is impressed in a\nmaterial power immediately becomes material, and hence the impression\nof a disposition in the image cannot make the essence immaterial\n(QDA-1974-III: 218). The latter account, (ii), in turn, is\nrejected because either the result of the removal remains in the\nphantasia—a material power—and we end up again\nwith the same problem as (i), or the result is transferred to the\npossible intellect and we end up with a problematic transfer of an\naccidental form from one subject to another—from the organ of\nthe phantasia to the soul (QDA-1974-III: 230). An\naccident only has being in a substance; hence, if the transfer of\naccidents from one subject to another were possible, one would need to\nposit a time t where the accident has no supporting\nsubstance, which is impossible. Brito’s own account is that the\nagent intellect functions as a ‘light’ that enables the\nessence in the image to trigger a corresponding act of intellection\nwithout any removal, impression, or transfer of a form. Brito explains\nhis point by means of an analogy with seeing milk’s whiteness:\nthanks to the action of light, the milk’s whiteness is seen,\nwithout other features of the milk being seen, e.g., its sweetness;\nbut the action of light on the milk involves neither the impression of\na disposition on the milk’s whiteness (namely, visibility) nor a\nreal removal of the whiteness from the sweetness\n(QDA-1974-III: 237). In fact, the milk’s whiteness is\nin itself potentially visible and the action of light does nothing\nmore than to make it actually visible. The same goes for the agent\nintellect: it makes the essence in the image, which is in itself\npotentially intelligible, be actually intelligible. \nThe essence in the image thus illuminated, but neither really\nseparated from the image nor transferred anywhere, triggers the act of\nintellection of the possible intellect—the passive power of the\nintellectual faculty. This power is passive precisely in the sense\nthat it cannot trigger its own operation; rather, this operation must\nbe caused in it by the essence of the thing with the assistance of the\nagent intellect (QDA-1974-III: 122). Finally, the act of\nintellection comes about when, thanks to the action of the agent\nintellect, the actually intelligible essence in the image is actually\nunderstood by the possible intellect, thus causing the formation of\nthe essence’s concept in the soul. \nAssuming that Aristotle’s Metaphysics (Met.)\nis a systematic account of a particular subject, Brito follows the\nmajority of medieval commentators by beginning his inquiry with the\nquestion “What is the subject matter of metaphysics?”. In\nthe first question of the first book he asks whether the subject\nmatter of metaphysics is being. Traditionally, the question arises\nbecause of Aristotle’s treatment of:  \nTherefore, it seems necessary to determine whether the proper subject\nmatter of metaphysics is:  \nDepending on which subject matter is posited, metaphysics would be\nconsidered  \nIn his solution to the question, Brito considers only positions (i)\nand (iii), the first of which he attributes to Avicenna and the second\nto Averroes. He sides with Avicenna and supports his position with\nboth authoritative and epistemological arguments: the subject matter\nof metaphysics is being, not only because Aristotle says so in\nMet. Γ.1.1003a20–23, but also because, just as\nthe science of being must do, the Metaphysics deals with the\nparts and attributes of being in general (e.g., in its discussion of\nfirst substances, form and matter, truth and unity, etc.), as well as\nwith its causes and principles (e.g., in its discussion of the causes\nof being in Metaphysics. A and E) (QMet: I.1). \nAverroes’ position is dismissed for epistemological reasons:\nfirst, metaphysics cannot be equated with theology, because the latter\nmust posit God and proceed to the demonstration of his attributes, but\nMet. E presumably contains an inquiry into God’s\nexistence. Second, metaphysics is not the science of separate\nsubstances, because the inquiry into the notion of being is also\nconcerned with material substances (QMet: I.1). \nBrito also contributes to the famous medieval debate about whether\nthere is a fundamental difference between a thing’s essence and\nits being (essentia et esse). In his reply to the question\nwhether being belongs to the essence of things, Brito, like Siger of\nBrabant before him, takes issue with Aquinas’ position,\naccording to which being would be something added to the essence of a\nthing, though not as an accident. Aquinas’ position posits an\nodd constituent of things, which is neither essential nor accidental,\nbut, as Brito calls it, “fictional” (figmentum)\n(Ebbesen 2001: 476). \nBrito’s position is that essence and being are identical\n(QMet: IV.2).\nHis argument can be summarized as\nfollows: \nBrito’s opponents attack either step 2 or step 3 of his\nargument. The objection to step 2 states that a thing’s being\ndoes not need have being, in the same way that the whiteness that\nmakes something white needs not be white; so, \\(x_{1}\\) need not have\nbeing. A first objection to step 3 rejects the infinite regress,\nbecause there may be a \\(x_{n}\\) that has being by itself—the\nfirst cause (QMet: IV.2).\nAccording to a second objection to\nstep 3, not everything is such that its being and essence differ, so\nsome \\(x_{n}\\)’s being and essence can be the same without this\nleading to the same conclusion with respect to x. \nBrito’s position is clearly articulated in his reply to these\nobjections. In fact, whatever is predicated of a thing is predicated\non the basis of something that is either essential or accidental to\nit. If being is not predicated essentially, then it must be predicated\nby means of an accidental attribute. But according to Brito accidents\nhave\n being,[9]\n therefore step 2 stands. Moreover, if being belongs to the essence of\nsome \\(x_{n}\\), which is not the first cause, then it must belong to\nthe essence of any \\(x_{n}\\), which is not the first cause; therefore,\nstep 3 also stands. And no \\(x_{n}\\) can be the first cause, because,\nBrito tells us, being is an intrinsic and formal disposition of\nthings, which the first cause cannot be (QMet: IV.2; cf. Donati\n2013: 348). In other words, the predication of being cannot be based\non something that is neither essential nor accidental; and whoever\nclaims that it is based on something accidental will be committed to\nan infinite regress. Consequently, being is predicated essentially of\nthings, i.e., it belongs to them essentially. \nAlthough being is not equivocally predicated relative to substance and\naccident, it is not predicated completely univocally either (Ebbesen\n2001: 477). In fact, Brito develops his own account of the analogy of\nbeing, according to which being is predicated of substances and\naccidents with respect to a single concept, but under different\nmodalities (Donati 2013: 338). For him, the predication of being has\nreality in the ontological structure of things, specifically in\nmetaphysical constituents called presentations (apparens) or\nmodes of being (modus essendi). A thing’s presentations\nor modes of being are properties of the thing that manifest themselves\nin its perceivable operations (Donati 2013: 344; Ebbesen 2001: 479).\nThese presentations explain both the common attribution and the\ndifferent ways in which being is attributed to substance and accident,\nwithout having to appeal to a multiplicity of forms. The common\npredication of being to substance and accident is supported by a\ncommon mode of being: their esse formaliter—the\nprinciple of being that formally exists in both of them (Donati 2013:\n345). The different modalities of predication, in turn, are taken from\nthe substance’s capacity to exist in its own right and by the\naccident’s dependence on the substance for its existence, which\nare modes of being of the substance and of the accident, respectively.\n \nBrito’s contribution to the debate about the ontological status\nof universals can be found in his reply to the set of questions left\nunresolved in Porphyry’s Isagoge. In his commentary on\nthis text, Brito raises the question whether the universal exists\nindependently of any intellectual operation. His reply is negative or\npositive depending on whether the question concerns the actual or the\npotential universal. In doing so, Brito puts forth a moderate realist\nposition with respect to the external existence of universals (see\nalso Sirridge 2008). \nOn the one hand, the actual universal does not exist independently\nfrom the intellect, because its being depends on a separation from\nmatter performed by the active power of the intellect (QsP;\nsee Pinborg 1980: 86). The actual universal is, indeed, the cognition\nof an essence, and hence it is evidently dependent on the\nintellect’s activity (QsP; see Pinborg 1980: 100).  \nOn the other hand, the potential universal exists independently of the\nintellect, because it is an essence that as one of its modes of being\nhas the capacity to be separated from matter by the agent intellect.\nBut the essence and its modes of being are in themselves external and\nindependent of such an intellectual separation (QsP; see\nPinborg 1980: 86 and 92). Therefore, the potential universal exists\nindependently from any intellectual operation. \nHowever, in a subsequent question (QsP; q.8) Brito also\npresents a way in which the actual universal can be said to exist in\nthe external world. For, as was explained above in Brito’s\nlogic, any cognition is an abstract or concrete intention depending on\nwhether we consider it from the perspective of the cognitive subject\nor from the perspective of the thing understood. Hence, the actual\nuniversal understood as a concrete intention (i.e., as the thing\nunderstood) has external existence, although not independently of the\nintellect. But understood as an abstract intention (i.e., from the\nperspective of the cognitive subject) the actual universal exists only\nin the soul (QsP; see Pinborg 1980: 114). \nIn sum, Brito’s realist position states that the universal has\nexternal existence in at least two senses: first, potentially, in the\nessence with the intrinsic capacity of becoming the object of\nuniversal cognition; second, actually, in the essence actually known\nthrough universal cognition by virtue of some of its modes of being.\n \nRadulphus Brito has been identified as the author of two anonymous\nsets of questions on Aristotle’s Ethics. The first one\n(previously known as the ‘Vatican commentary’) was\nascribed to Brito by Costa after a suggestion by René-Antoine\nGauthier (QEN; QE-2008: 99–137). The second\nset of questions, preserved in a sole manuscript, Vat. Lat. 2173, is\nstill unedited. The first one was written around 1295, when Brito was\na master of arts, and the second some years later, most likely when he\nwas studying theology. \nPhilosophical happiness is discussed in books I and X of Brito’s\ncommentaries on the Ethics. Following in the footsteps of\nAquinas (cf. Summa theologiae, I.II 3.4), Brito holds the\nessence of happiness to consist in the intellect’s actual\nknowledge of God and the separate substances. Happiness, thus, amounts\nto the intellectual union of man with the highest beings. But despite\nAquinas’ strong influence on his position, Brito’s notion\nof human happiness is still ‘radically Aristotelian’, as\nhe fervently defends the Aristotelian ideal of philosophical life, or\nbios theoretikos (QEN; QE-2008:\n171–176). As a result, Brito establishes the superiority of the\ncontemplative life over the active life (or of philosophical life over\npolitical life). The contemplative life is the highest form of life\nfor a rational creature and that towards which active life must aim as\nan end. This conception of philosophical happiness is the same we find\nin other Parisian commentaries on the Ethics from the same\nperiod, particularly the Anonymous of Paris (ms. BnF lat. 14698: see Costa\n2010), the Anonymous of\nErlangen (ms. Universitätsbibl. 213), the Anonymous of Erfurt\n(ms. Amplon. F. 13) and Giles of Orleans (ms. Paris, BnF lat. 16089). \nBrito’s accounts of human freedom and moral responsibility\nheavily depend on Godfrey of Fontaines. Godfrey, a theology master, is\nthe author of an important set of quodlibetal questions, where he\noffers a strongly intellectualist account of the psychology of human\nacts (or of free agency). After Aquinas’ death in 1274, two main\nnotions of human agency were opposed, especially among theologians. On\nthe one hand, voluntarist theologians proposed that intellect and will\nare the two main faculties of the intellectual soul, with the\nintellect being a cognitive power, and the will an active, or dynamic,\npower. Since the perfection of the will is greater than that of the\nintellect, will is the main agent of human action. Intellectual\nknowledge is only a condition sine qua non of free action. In\nother words, the intellect’s function is merely to present to\nthe will the objects of action. On the other hand, as a critical\nresponse to voluntarism, intellectualism proposes that the\nintellect’s main function is to act responsibly. Thus,\nintellectualist theologians, such as Godfrey, hold that the\nintellect’s function is not only to present to the will the\nobjects of action, but also to judge about the good and evil of\npossible actions. Moreover, voluntarist theologians consider will to\nbe an active power, whereas the intellectualists consider it a passive\none insofar as it is moved by the judgment it receives from the\nintellect. Accordingly, voluntarist theologians raise against the\nintellectualists the charge of determinism, since in the\nlatter’s position, the will’s action would not be properly\nfree. On the other hand, intellectualist theologians reject the\nvoluntarists’ consideration of will as a cognitive power, as it\nwould perform the intellect’s judgment about good and evil. \nFor Brito, free will (liberum arbitrium) depends entirely on\nintellectual judgment: \nWhen something appears to the will as a good, the will desires it,\nuntil deliberation and the intellect’s judgment make something\nelse to appear as being better. Thus, when the will is brought towards\na good object, it doesn’t pursue it immediately, but it first\ndeliberates about its contrary, its consequences, its accidents and\ncircumstances, and so the discourse of reason can make something,\nwhich appeared as good, appear as evil. And this is how free will\nworks. (QEN 60; QE-2008: 322) \nBrito thinks that the will necessarily desires something that appears\nas good. If there were no means to restrain the will, this would\ncertainly be a form of determinism. However, for Brito, the intellect\nhas the power to restrain the will. By deliberating about the extent\nto which the object is good, the intellect can eventually come upon\nnegative aspects in it and obstruct the action of the will.  \nRegarding the essence of moral virtue, Brito holds different positions\nin his two commentaries on the Ethics. In this change of\nposition, Brito reveals an interesting use of theological sources. In\nthe first commentary, he holds that will is the subject of justice,\nwhile the sensitive appetite is the subject of the remaining moral\nvirtues (QEN; QE-2008: 276–279,\n426–428). Here Brito roughly replicates Aquinas’ position\n(cf. Summa theologiae, II.II 58.4). However, in his second\ncommentary, Brito adopts the rather Aristotelian position of Godfrey\nof Fontaines (Quodl. \n XIV),[10]\n according to which all the moral\nvirtues are dispositions of the sensitive appetite. Thus, Brito\nopposes, on the one hand, Aquinas and Henry of Ghent, for whom all\nmoral virtues are dispositions of the will, and, on the other hand,\nPeter of Auvergne, for whom all virtues exist both in the will and in\nthe sensitive appetite.","contact.mail":"ana.maria.mora.marquez@gu.se","contact.domain":"gu.se"},{"date.published":"2018-03-02","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/radulphus-brito/","author1":"Ana María Mora-Márquez","author2":"Iacopo Costa","entry":"radulphus-brito","body.text":"\n\n\nRadulphus Brito († 1320/21) was an important thirteenth-century\nmaster of arts at the University of Paris. He was part of the group of\nmedieval masters who later came to be known as the modistae,\nprincipally because of their common appeal to the notion of modes of\nsignifying (modi significandi) in their accounts of\ngrammatical congruence. Brito’s philosophical work is largely\nunexplored, even though it is a crucial link between the philosophical\ndiscussions of the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries. Among\nother things, he richly contributed to the development of medieval\nlogic and philosophy of language. In fact, one can fairly consider his\nlogic of intentions to be the pinnacle of the development of\nthirteenth-century Aristotelian logic. Brito was a prolific author,\nwho commented on nearly all the Aristotelian corpus. Almost his entire\nphilosophical work is extant, although most of it is unedited.\n\n\n\n\nOnly little is known about Brito’s life. Recent studies by\nWilliam Courtenay (2005) and Jean-Luc Deuffic (2002) significantly\nincreased our knowledge of his biography. He was born in the village\nof Ploudiry, in French Brittany, around 1270 and not later than 1273.\nHe was a master of arts in Paris from around 1290. He probably began\nthe study of theology in 1299, while still teaching in the faculty of\narts. He read Peter Lombard’s Sentences in 1308/09 and\nobtained his doctorate in theology in 1313/14. Brito became\n Provisor[1]\n of the Sorbonne at some point between 1312 and 1315 and kept this\nfunction until at least 1319. He also held several ecclesiastical\npositions, which is a good indication of both his prominence within\nthe university and excellent personal connections. Brito died in\n1320/21. \nBrito’s philosophical output consists mainly of\nquestion-commentaries on the corpus of Aristotle’s writings,\nBoethius’ logical corpus, and Priscian’s grammar. In all\nlikelihood, these commentaries were produced during his career as a\nmaster of arts in Paris in the 1290s. \nHis grammatical and logical works, which are those that have been most\nthoroughly studied, consist of the following\nquestion-commentaries: \nAlthough most of these works are only extant in manuscript form, there\nare editions of 1 (QPm-1980), 3 (QTB-1978) and 5\n(QPA-2016), and editions in progress of, at least, 2,\n4.1–4.2 and\n 7–9.\n Finally, there is a fifteenth-century edition (QR-1499) and\na Renaissance Greek translation by Gennadios Scholarios (Ebbesen &\nPinborg 1981–1982) of 4, as well as a number of partial editions\nof\n 4–10. See in particular Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982 \nfor an edition of the prooemium of\n 4.1.[2] \nMuch less studied is the remaining part of Brito’s philosophical\ncorpus, which consists of the following question-commentaries: \nMost of these works are also extant only in manuscript. There are\neditions in progress of 1 and 4.\n\nOnly 7 (QE-2008) and 12 (QDc-2016) have been fully\nedited. Regarding 3, the questions on De anima I\n(QDA-2012-I) and on De anima III\n(QDA-1974-III) are fully edited, and there is a partial\nedition of the questions on De anima II\n(QDA-2012-II). Finally, there are partial editions of 1,\n4–6 and\n 8.[3] \nAlmost completely unexplored are Brito’s theological writings,\nvirtually all of which are unedited. These include a question\ncommentary on Peter Lombard’s Sentences I–III,\nwritten in 1308/9 and preserved in the ms. Pavia, Biblioteca\nUniversitaria Aldini 244 ff. 15–54. In addition, Prospero di\nReggio Emilia reports a set of theological questions, preserved in ms.\nVaticana lat. 1086, ff. 156rv and 196r–208r (see QE-2008: 103).\nAnd F. Stegmüller has\nattributed to Brito a set of questions on the Psalms, also\npreserved in the Pavia manuscript (see QE-2008: 103). The authenticity of the two\nlatter items is still uncertain, however (see QE-2008: 103).\nPartial editions of the commentary on the Sentences are found\nin Rossini and Schabel 2005 and in QE-2008.  \nIn his commentary on Priscian Minor, Brito endeavors to show\nthat grammar meets the criteria a medieval discipline must meet in\norder to be considered a theoretical science. In doing so, he puts\nforth his own account of grammar as an independent theoretical science\nin terms of both subject matter and principles (for Brito’s\ntheoretical grammar, see Pinborg 1967; Rosier-Catach 1983, 1999, 2010;\nEbbesen 1998a.). Regarding grammar’s subject matter,\nBrito’s position is that, from the point of view of predication,\nsignificant speech (sermo significativus) is the general\nsubject matter. In fact, significant speech is:  \nHowever, from the point of view of attribution, the expression\n(oratio) can also be considered the subject matter of\ngrammar, as everything that grammar considers is in one way or another\nrelated to it (QPm; QPm-1980: 104). More\nspecifically, from the point of view of predication, the expression is\ndiscussed in the so-called Priscian Minor (books\nXVII–XVIII of Priscian’s Institutiones), which is\nexclusively concerned with the principles of grammatical expressions\nand with the demonstration of their features (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 107). \nThe principles of the grammatical expression—what makes an\nexpression grammatical—are the modes of signifying (modi\nsignificandi) of its constituent parts (Rosier-Catach 1995),\nwhich are the parts of speech (partes orationis), i.e., noun,\nverb, participle, pronoun, preposition, adverb, conjunction, and\ninterjection. The modes of signifying are, in turn, the formal\nconstituent features of these parts (QPm; QPm-1980:\n138–139). \nA part of speech is the result of a series of hylomorphic compositions\nstarting with articulated sound (vox). First, the word\n(dictio) is the result of the hylomorphic composition of an\narticulate sound (vox) and the relation of signification\n(ratio\n significationis).[4]\n This relation links the articulate sound to the thing signified\n(res significata, for res significata, see\nRosier-Catach 1995), regardless of the thing’s different modes\nof being (modi essendi; for modi essendi, see Donati\n2013). In fact, things and their modes of being are not identical. For\ninstance, a horse may happen to be a particular horse, a universal\nhorse, my horse, etc., but being particular, being universal, being\nmine, etc. are all different from being a horse. \nA part of speech (pars orationis) is the result of the\nhylomorphic composition of a word and a mode of signifying. The mode\nof signifying, in turn, is derived from some of the modes of being a\nthing may have (QPm; QPm-1980: 164). For instance, a\n‘walk’ has the mode of signifying of a qualified\nsubstance, because it indicates the action of walking as a qualified\nsubstance (QPm; QPm-1980: 192–193). This mode\nof signifying directly results from a particular mode of understanding\n(modus intelligendi) the action of walking, namely from\nunderstanding it as a qualified substance. Generally speaking, then,\nthe modes of signifying are taken from their corresponding modes of\nunderstanding; and the modes of understanding, in turn, are taken from\nthe modes of being of things. This is, in fact, the fundamental tenet\nof the modistic grammar to which Brito adheres: the modes of\nsignifying follow from the modes of understanding things, which in\nturn follow from the modes of being of things. Note, however, that a\nwalk is in itself an action and not a substance. But this is not a\nproblem for grammar’s scientific status because a grammatical\nitem takes its mode of signifying from the possible modes of being of\nthings and not necessarily from the actual modes of being of a\nword’s significate (QPm; QPm-1980: 164).\nConsequently, every mode of signifying is ultimately grounded in a\nreal mode of being, making the science of grammar grounded in\nsomething real.  \nHaving established that every mode of signifying corresponds, through\na mode of understanding, to a thing’s mode of being, Brito goes\non to introduce a distinction between active and passive modes of\nsignifying, as well as between active and passive modes of\n understanding.[5]\n The passive mode of understanding and the passive mode of signifying\nare the mode of being as understood and the mode of being as indicated\nby the part of speech, respectively. Therefore, although the passive\nmode of signifying, the passive mode of understanding, and the mode of\nbeing are features of the same thing, they are notionally\ndifferent. \nThe active mode of understanding and the active mode of signifying are\nthe intellectual apprehension of the mode of being and the\ncorresponding relation of consignification whereby the part of speech\nindicates that mode of being (QPm; QPm-1980: 153).\nHence, the active mode of understanding and the active mode of\nsignifying are both notionally different and features of different\nthings. Nevertheless, they are linked by a causal relation, because\nthe mode of understanding immediately causes the mode of signifying.\nThus, the active modes of signifying and understanding are similar\n(QPm; QPm-1980: 158). \nFinally, the active and passive modes of signifying are notionally\nidentical, but they are features of different things. This is because\none and the same relation of consignification is considered on the one\nhand as a feature of a grammatical item and, on the other, as a\nfeature of a thing. The same goes for the active and passive modes of\nunderstanding (QPm; QPm-1980: 170). \nSince grammar is mainly concerned with the principles of grammatical\nspeech, one could expect these principles to be the active modes of\nsignifying—the formal features of the words that constitute a\ngrammatical phrase. However, since the active modes are notionally\nidentical to the passive ones, Brito claims that, from a formal\nperspective, both the active and the passive modes of signifying are\nthe principles of grammatical constructions. The modes of being, on\nthe contrary, are the principles of grammatical constructions only\ninsofar as they are consignified by the parts of speech (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 173). \nA grammatical phrase is formed when the modes of signifying of its\nconstituent parts are compatible with each other (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 132). Hence, ‘a man runs’ is a\ngrammatical construction, because the mode of signifying of ‘a\nman’ (i.e., the mode of the qualified substance) and that of\n‘runs’ (i.e., the mode of being performed) are compatible\nwith each other. These modes of signifying are in turn compatible with\neach other because the modes of being that ‘a man’ and\n‘runs’ consignify are compatible with each other. \nAccording to Brito, logic is a theoretical science dealing with the\nmethods of scientific-knowledge acquisition (modi sciendi,\nhereafter ‘methods of knowledge’) (QsP; see\nEbbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 301). However, since the\nsyllogism is the method of knowledge par excellence, and that\nto which all the other methods of knowledge are subordinated, it can\nalso be posited as the general subject matter of logic. \nFor a medieval master like Brito, the science of logic is first and\nforemost contained in Aristotle’s organon (see entry on\n Aristotle's logic).\nHence, Brito’s account of logic as a science must explain the\ndivision of the organon into six treatises as a reflection of\na division of the syllogism into its different kinds (the\ndemonstrative syllogism, the dialectical syllogism, etc.) and its\nconstituent parts (simple words, assertions, etc.). Accordingly,\nBrito’s first division of logic proceeds as follows: the\nsyllogism considered only with regard to its moods and figures is the\nsubject matter of the Prior Analytics. The syllogism\nconsidered according to the alethic modality of its premises is the\nsubject matter of the Topics and of the Posterior\nAnalytics, the former dealing with the syllogism from probable\npremises and the latter with the syllogism from necessary premises.\nThe syllogism from apparently probable premises is, in turn, the\nsubject matter of the Sophistical Refutations. Now, since the\nsyllogism can also be analyzed with respect to its constituent parts,\nthe Categories deals with its simple parts—simple\nwords—insofar as they can be sorted into different kinds\n(substance, quality, quantity, etc.). Finally, the De\ninterpretatione deals with the complex parts of the\nsyllogism—assertions that become its premises and\nconclusion—as well as with the simple parts of the assertion,\ni.e., the subject and predicate terms (QsP; see Ebbesen &\nPinborg 1981–1982: 301 and 303). \nBrito also puts forth the most developed account of the\nthirteenth-century logic of intentions (for Brito’s logic, see\nPinborg 1967, 1971, 1975a; Ebbesen 1998a). His logic of intentions\nconsiders the subject matter of logic to be second\n intentions[6]\n (intentiones secundae), which are best understood as\nqualified fundamental concepts (first intentions). A first intention\nis the first intellectual apprehension of a thing—the\nunqualified concept that only grasps what a thing essentially is. A\nsecond intention, in turn, is a first intention qualified according to\none of the several modes of being that things have. For instance, the\nconcept of man can be understood as a substance because its content is\nthe substantial form of individual men, or it can be understood as a\nspecies because its content actually informs several individuals at\nthe same time, etc. (QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 307). \nSince first and second intentions are essentially related to a\ncognitive object, depending on whether the cognitive relation is taken\nfrom the side of the thinking subject or from the side of the object,\nfirst and second intentions can be abstract or concrete. Accordingly,\nman, insofar as it is known through its concept, is a concrete first\nintention; its concept is an abstract first intention. On the other\nhand, man, understood as a species of animal, is a concrete second\nintention; the concept of man thus qualified is an abstract second\nintention, etc. (QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 307). \nBrito goes on to claim that, more precisely, the subject matter of\nlogic is concrete second intentions. The subsequent division\nof logic must then correspond to a division of concrete second\nintentions. Such a division is deduced from the three cognitive\noperations of the intellect: apprehension, composition/division, and\ndeduction (Ebbesen and Pinborg 1981-1982: 309). A second intention\nqualifies the object of some of these intellectual operations.\nCorrespondingly, the Categories deals with concrete second\nintentions understood through intellectual apprehension (e.g., man as\nsubstance, whiteness as quality, etc.). De interpretatione\ndeals with concrete second intentions understood through composition\nand division (e.g., man as subject, white as predicate, a man being\nwhite as an assertion, etc.). Both Analytics, the\nTopics, and Sophistical Refutations deal with\nconcrete second intentions understood through deduction. In other\nwords, these treatises deal with things insofar as they are related to\na syllogistic process, e.g., with the premise that every man is an\nanimal (in the Prior Analytics), with the probability of a\nman being white (in the Topics), with the necessity of every\nman being an animal (in the Posterior Analytics), etc.\n(QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 309 and 311). \nOf particular importance is the difference between concrete second\nintentions as they are dealt with in the Prior Analytics on\nthe one hand, and in the Topics and the Posterior\nAnalytics on the other. For the Prior Analytics deals\nwith second intentions related to a syllogistic process, regardless of\nwhether its premises are probable or necessary, whereas the\nTopics and the Posterior Analytics deal with those\nsecond intentions whereby the premises are qualified as probable or\nnecessary, respectively. Therefore, while the Prior Analytics\ndeals with the intentions involved in a syllogistic deduction only\nwith regard to its mood and figure, the Topics and the\nPosterior Analytics deal with these intentions with regard to\ntheir probability and necessity (QsP; see Ebbesen &\nPinborg 1981–1982: 311 and 313). \nBrito’s logic of intentions also allows him to explain away a\nconcern that had troubled earlier commentators of Aristotle’s\nlogic, such as Nicholas of Paris and Robert Kilwardby, namely the fact\nthat simple words, such as ‘man’, are discussed in the\nCategories, De interpretatione and Prior\nAnalytics (see Mora-Márquez 2015b: 71). If, they thought,\na discussion of simple words belongs in logic at all, then at least it\nought to be found in precisely one treatise. However, since logic, for\nBrito, deals with man as a concrete second intention rather than as a\nword or a thing, the problem does not arise. In fact,\nthe Categories discusses man insofar as it is a substance;\nthe De interpretatione insofar as it is a subject of\npredication; and the Prior Analytics insofar as it is a term,\ni.e., the major, minor or middle term of a syllogism (QsP;\nsee Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981–1982: 313). \nFinally, Brito’s logic of intentions results in a major\ndeparture from the logical tradition represented by Kilwardby and his\ncontemporaries: the exclusion of truth from the realm of logic (see\nMora-Márquez 2015b: ch. 4). According to Brito, logic does not\ndeal with truth because it does not deal with real things per se, and\nreal things, regardless of whatever second intentions they may fall\nunder, are the truth-makers of assertions (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 138–139). The truth of an assertion such as\n‘every man is an\n animal’[7]\n depends on a real identity holding between man and animal—a\nreal identity that is independent of the fact that man is a species, a\nsubject, a substance, etc. In other words, such an identity is\nindependent of the second intentions that qualify the cognitive\napprehension of man. Despite this, second intentions do play a role in\nthe validity of deductions that have ‘every man is an\nanimal’ as a premise, for second intentions are the principles\nof a syllogism’s validity. But they are not the principles of an\nassertion’s truth or falsity, and hence truth is no longer a\nlogical concern.  \nIn his question commentary on Aristotle’s De anima I,\nBrito asks about the subject matter of the science of the soul (for\nBrito’s psychology, see De Boer 2012, 2013). With respect to\nthis question, earlier scholars usually take one of two main opposing\npositions: the subject matter of psychology is either simply the soul,\nor it is the body that has a soul, i.e., the animate body. Brito opts\nfor the second position: the subject matter of the science of the soul\nis the animate body, with an emphasis on its being animated. Two\narguments are given to support his position: the science of the soul\nstudies the operations and features specifically related to the\nanimate body’s having a soul (growth, nutrition, sensation, and\nunderstanding). Hence, its subject matter ought to be the possessor of\nthose operations and features—the animate body. Accordingly,\nthis science does not study the soul, that which makes the animate\nbody animate, without any consideration of its relation to the body;\nrather, it studies the entire composite of body and soul, and more\nspecifically, the body that has a soul (QDA-2012-I: 276).\nTherefore, the science of the soul approaches the soul not as an\nentity totally detached from the body it animates, but rather as the\ncause of the set of operations and features that separate living\nbodies from inanimate ones. \nIn his commentary on De anima II, Brito goes on to discuss\nthe description of the soul as the substantial form of the living\nbody. The discussion is directly related to the debate between those\n(like Albert the Great) who describe the soul as the extrinsically\ngiven perfection of the living body, and those (like Thomas Aquinas)\nwho describe it as the living body’s intrinsic substantial form.\nThe first group of commentators refrained from describing the soul as\nthe substantial form of the body because this seemed too close to the\nmaterialist account of Alexander of Aphrodisias, who seemingly would\ndeny the possibility of the separation of the human soul after the\nbody’s death. Albert therefore describes the soul as that which\nextrinsically perfects (perficit) a material body that has\nlife potentially—a material body capable of performing the\noperations causally related to being alive. Aquinas, however, opts for\na description more in accordance with Aristotelian doctrine: the soul\nis the intrinsic substantial form of the living body, for that which\nseparates animate from inanimate bodies must belong essentially, and\nintrinsically, to animate bodies as their form. Brito, in turn, sides\nwith Aquinas and describes the soul as the substantial form of the\nbody. His position is supported by two arguments: a substantial form\nis that due to which something receives its specific name (e.g.,\n‘horse’); when this form is removed, its subject is called\nby that name only equivocally (e.g., a dead horse is called ‘a\nhorse’ only equivocally); since the soul is that due to which an\nanimate body is said to be animate per se, and since its removal makes\nthe body animate only equivocally, the soul must be the substantial\nform of the animate body (QDA-2012-II: 319). More\nimportantly, the substantial form is that due to which individuals\nbelonging to a natural kind can perform the specific operations that\ndistinguish them from other kinds belonging to the same genus. Hence,\nsince the soul is that due to which the animate body can perform its\nspecific operations of growth, nutrition, sensation, and\nunderstanding, the soul must be described as the substantial form of\nthe animate body (QDA-2012-II: 320). \nAccordingly, Brito also considers the animate body—the\nhylomorphic composition of body and soul—to be an essential\nunity—a unity where the body is the material part and the soul\nis the formal part (QDA-2012-II: 325). Like Aristotle, Brito\ndismisses as misleading the question about the metaphysical link that\nbinds soul and body together into an essential unity. In fact, there\nis no such link that could belong essentially and intrinsically to the\nanimate body. If there were, it would be either material or formal. It\ncannot be material, because whatever is material is also potential,\nand whatever is potential is unable to actually connect body and soul.\nIf it were formal, it would be either a substantial or an accidental\nform. It cannot be a substantial form, for then the animate body would\nhave two substantial forms—a possibility that Brito\ncategorically rejects. And it cannot be an accidental form, because\nthe possession of accidents naturally implies the possession of a\nsubstantial form that serves as their support. Hence, we end up with\nan additional substantial form that supports the accident that binds\nbody and soul. Consequently, the cause of the union of body and soul\ncan only be an extrinsic agent that does not belong essentially to the\nanimate body (QDA-2012-II: 326). \nBrito defends, then, the correctness of Aristotle’s definition\nof the soul as the act of an organic physical body that has life\npotentially. In keeping with the description of the soul as a\nsubstantial form, the soul is defined as that which essentially\nconstitutes the first actualization of the animate body. The rest of\nthe definition singles out the specific kind of body the soul\nactualizes. First, the body in question is natural and not artificial,\nfor the actualization of the body by the soul creates an individual\nbelonging to a natural kind and not an artifact like a table. Second,\nit is organized (i.e., organic), for it involves an interconnected set\nof fundamentally different parts whereby the different operations of\nthe animate body are carried out (QDA-2012-II: 328). Finally,\nit has life potentially, quite simply because there cannot be\nsomething actual in a certain respect that was not previously\npotential in the very same respect. In other words, one could not be\nan actual living being if one’s body did not first possess the\npotential to be alive (QDA-2012-II: 329). Consequently,\naccording to Brito, Aristotle’s definition of the soul correctly\nplaces the soul in the class of substantial acts or forms, just as it\ncorrectly singles out the specific kind of matter that this act or\nform actualizes—an organic physical body that has life\npotentially. \nBrito’s explanation of why the animate body must be organic also\nshows clearly his commitment to a faculty psychology. He says: \nEvery form that has several capacities and operations […]\nrequires its subject to have multiple organs in order to perform those\noperations; the soul has several faculties and several operations;\ntherefore etc. […] [T]he vegetative faculty has the capacities\nof nutrition, growth, and generation; and these capacities have\ndifferent operations: the capacity of nutrition must preserve the\nsubstance of what is nourished; the capacity of growth must lead it to\na perfect quantity (ducere ad perfectam quantitatem), and the\ncapacity of generation must preserve the species. The sensitive soul\nalso has multiple capacities: the capacity of sight, of hearing, of\nsmell, etc., which have different operations. Also, the common sense\nhas several capacities, as imagination (potentia ymaginativa)\nand memory (potentia memorativa). Therefore, the soul\nrequires multiple organs in its body in order to perform those\noperations. Also, the intellectual soul insofar as it is intellectual\ndoes not have a bodily organ; however, its operation depends on some\nbodily power (virtus) that is in an organ, i.e., on the\nphantasia. (QDA-2012-II: 328–329) \nConsequently, the parts of the organic body are the instruments for\nthe operations specifically performed by living beings; operations\nthat are divided into three different kinds: vegetative (bodily,\nnon-cognitive), sensitive (bodily, cognitive) and intellectual\n(non-bodily, cognitive). These operations must, then, correspond to\nthree specifically different faculties of the soul, which are\nresponsible for the actualization of the organic body’s\npotential with regard to those operations (QDA-2012-II: 343\nand 345). \nThe soul has two cognitive faculties: the sensitive and the\nintellectual. The sensitive faculty is bodily in the sense that its\noperations necessarily use bodily organs (QDA-1974-III: 102).\nThis faculty involves a set of powers that are divided into external\nand internal senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, and\ncommon sense, estimation, memory and phantasia,\n respectively),[8]\n depending on whether their operations are performed through external\nor internal organs (i.e., the eye, the ear, the tongue, etc., and the\nthree ventricles of the brain) (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 36). The\nmost complex animals must have both internal and external senses,\nbecause for their self-preservation they must have the capacity to\nform sense representations of external objects, whether they are\npresent or absent (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 35). All of these\nsenses perform different cognitive operations that take different\nobjects (e.g., sight takes color, hearing takes sound, estimation\ntakes the harmful and the useful, memory takes sensorial\nrepresentations, etc.) (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 38). Moreover,\neach of these senses contributes in a specific way to the formation by\nthe phantasia of a unified sensory representation (a\nphantasma) of an external object. \nThe intellectual faculty, in turn, does not use a bodily organ in its\noperations. According to Brito, however, every single case of\nintellectual cognition takes as a starting point a phantasma\nor image (QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 40). This does not mean that the\nimage is itself the object of intellectual cognition. On the contrary,\nBrito emphasizes in several places that the object of intellectual\ncognition is the essence (quod quid est) of the thing\n(QDA-1974-III: 174; cf. QDM; Ebbesen 2016: 41). For\ninstance, what is known through intellectual cognition is neither the\nimage of the apple nor the external apple, but the essence of the\nexternal apple that is represented in the image. \nThe process of intellectual cognition of an essence involves two\noperations that correspond to two different powers of the intellectual\nfaculty: the operations of abstraction and intellection by the agent\nand the possible intellect. Since the essence in both the image and\nthe external thing has material existence, and since the object of\nintellectual cognition must be immaterial, it is necessary to\nintroduce a power that makes the essence immaterial. This power is the\nagent intellect—an active power that, through the act of\nabstraction, makes immaterial the essence materially represented in\nthe image (QDA-1974-III: 212). \nBrito rejects two alternative accounts that explain this act of\nabstraction either as \nThe former, (i), is rejected because whatever is impressed in a\nmaterial power immediately becomes material, and hence the impression\nof a disposition in the image cannot make the essence immaterial\n(QDA-1974-III: 218). The latter account, (ii), in turn, is\nrejected because either the result of the removal remains in the\nphantasia—a material power—and we end up again\nwith the same problem as (i), or the result is transferred to the\npossible intellect and we end up with a problematic transfer of an\naccidental form from one subject to another—from the organ of\nthe phantasia to the soul (QDA-1974-III: 230). An\naccident only has being in a substance; hence, if the transfer of\naccidents from one subject to another were possible, one would need to\nposit a time t where the accident has no supporting\nsubstance, which is impossible. Brito’s own account is that the\nagent intellect functions as a ‘light’ that enables the\nessence in the image to trigger a corresponding act of intellection\nwithout any removal, impression, or transfer of a form. Brito explains\nhis point by means of an analogy with seeing milk’s whiteness:\nthanks to the action of light, the milk’s whiteness is seen,\nwithout other features of the milk being seen, e.g., its sweetness;\nbut the action of light on the milk involves neither the impression of\na disposition on the milk’s whiteness (namely, visibility) nor a\nreal removal of the whiteness from the sweetness\n(QDA-1974-III: 237). In fact, the milk’s whiteness is\nin itself potentially visible and the action of light does nothing\nmore than to make it actually visible. The same goes for the agent\nintellect: it makes the essence in the image, which is in itself\npotentially intelligible, be actually intelligible. \nThe essence in the image thus illuminated, but neither really\nseparated from the image nor transferred anywhere, triggers the act of\nintellection of the possible intellect—the passive power of the\nintellectual faculty. This power is passive precisely in the sense\nthat it cannot trigger its own operation; rather, this operation must\nbe caused in it by the essence of the thing with the assistance of the\nagent intellect (QDA-1974-III: 122). Finally, the act of\nintellection comes about when, thanks to the action of the agent\nintellect, the actually intelligible essence in the image is actually\nunderstood by the possible intellect, thus causing the formation of\nthe essence’s concept in the soul. \nAssuming that Aristotle’s Metaphysics (Met.)\nis a systematic account of a particular subject, Brito follows the\nmajority of medieval commentators by beginning his inquiry with the\nquestion “What is the subject matter of metaphysics?”. In\nthe first question of the first book he asks whether the subject\nmatter of metaphysics is being. Traditionally, the question arises\nbecause of Aristotle’s treatment of:  \nTherefore, it seems necessary to determine whether the proper subject\nmatter of metaphysics is:  \nDepending on which subject matter is posited, metaphysics would be\nconsidered  \nIn his solution to the question, Brito considers only positions (i)\nand (iii), the first of which he attributes to Avicenna and the second\nto Averroes. He sides with Avicenna and supports his position with\nboth authoritative and epistemological arguments: the subject matter\nof metaphysics is being, not only because Aristotle says so in\nMet. Γ.1.1003a20–23, but also because, just as\nthe science of being must do, the Metaphysics deals with the\nparts and attributes of being in general (e.g., in its discussion of\nfirst substances, form and matter, truth and unity, etc.), as well as\nwith its causes and principles (e.g., in its discussion of the causes\nof being in Metaphysics. A and E) (QMet: I.1). \nAverroes’ position is dismissed for epistemological reasons:\nfirst, metaphysics cannot be equated with theology, because the latter\nmust posit God and proceed to the demonstration of his attributes, but\nMet. E presumably contains an inquiry into God’s\nexistence. Second, metaphysics is not the science of separate\nsubstances, because the inquiry into the notion of being is also\nconcerned with material substances (QMet: I.1). \nBrito also contributes to the famous medieval debate about whether\nthere is a fundamental difference between a thing’s essence and\nits being (essentia et esse). In his reply to the question\nwhether being belongs to the essence of things, Brito, like Siger of\nBrabant before him, takes issue with Aquinas’ position,\naccording to which being would be something added to the essence of a\nthing, though not as an accident. Aquinas’ position posits an\nodd constituent of things, which is neither essential nor accidental,\nbut, as Brito calls it, “fictional” (figmentum)\n(Ebbesen 2001: 476). \nBrito’s position is that essence and being are identical\n(QMet: IV.2).\nHis argument can be summarized as\nfollows: \nBrito’s opponents attack either step 2 or step 3 of his\nargument. The objection to step 2 states that a thing’s being\ndoes not need have being, in the same way that the whiteness that\nmakes something white needs not be white; so, \\(x_{1}\\) need not have\nbeing. A first objection to step 3 rejects the infinite regress,\nbecause there may be a \\(x_{n}\\) that has being by itself—the\nfirst cause (QMet: IV.2).\nAccording to a second objection to\nstep 3, not everything is such that its being and essence differ, so\nsome \\(x_{n}\\)’s being and essence can be the same without this\nleading to the same conclusion with respect to x. \nBrito’s position is clearly articulated in his reply to these\nobjections. In fact, whatever is predicated of a thing is predicated\non the basis of something that is either essential or accidental to\nit. If being is not predicated essentially, then it must be predicated\nby means of an accidental attribute. But according to Brito accidents\nhave\n being,[9]\n therefore step 2 stands. Moreover, if being belongs to the essence of\nsome \\(x_{n}\\), which is not the first cause, then it must belong to\nthe essence of any \\(x_{n}\\), which is not the first cause; therefore,\nstep 3 also stands. And no \\(x_{n}\\) can be the first cause, because,\nBrito tells us, being is an intrinsic and formal disposition of\nthings, which the first cause cannot be (QMet: IV.2; cf. Donati\n2013: 348). In other words, the predication of being cannot be based\non something that is neither essential nor accidental; and whoever\nclaims that it is based on something accidental will be committed to\nan infinite regress. Consequently, being is predicated essentially of\nthings, i.e., it belongs to them essentially. \nAlthough being is not equivocally predicated relative to substance and\naccident, it is not predicated completely univocally either (Ebbesen\n2001: 477). In fact, Brito develops his own account of the analogy of\nbeing, according to which being is predicated of substances and\naccidents with respect to a single concept, but under different\nmodalities (Donati 2013: 338). For him, the predication of being has\nreality in the ontological structure of things, specifically in\nmetaphysical constituents called presentations (apparens) or\nmodes of being (modus essendi). A thing’s presentations\nor modes of being are properties of the thing that manifest themselves\nin its perceivable operations (Donati 2013: 344; Ebbesen 2001: 479).\nThese presentations explain both the common attribution and the\ndifferent ways in which being is attributed to substance and accident,\nwithout having to appeal to a multiplicity of forms. The common\npredication of being to substance and accident is supported by a\ncommon mode of being: their esse formaliter—the\nprinciple of being that formally exists in both of them (Donati 2013:\n345). The different modalities of predication, in turn, are taken from\nthe substance’s capacity to exist in its own right and by the\naccident’s dependence on the substance for its existence, which\nare modes of being of the substance and of the accident, respectively.\n \nBrito’s contribution to the debate about the ontological status\nof universals can be found in his reply to the set of questions left\nunresolved in Porphyry’s Isagoge. In his commentary on\nthis text, Brito raises the question whether the universal exists\nindependently of any intellectual operation. His reply is negative or\npositive depending on whether the question concerns the actual or the\npotential universal. In doing so, Brito puts forth a moderate realist\nposition with respect to the external existence of universals (see\nalso Sirridge 2008). \nOn the one hand, the actual universal does not exist independently\nfrom the intellect, because its being depends on a separation from\nmatter performed by the active power of the intellect (QsP;\nsee Pinborg 1980: 86). The actual universal is, indeed, the cognition\nof an essence, and hence it is evidently dependent on the\nintellect’s activity (QsP; see Pinborg 1980: 100).  \nOn the other hand, the potential universal exists independently of the\nintellect, because it is an essence that as one of its modes of being\nhas the capacity to be separated from matter by the agent intellect.\nBut the essence and its modes of being are in themselves external and\nindependent of such an intellectual separation (QsP; see\nPinborg 1980: 86 and 92). Therefore, the potential universal exists\nindependently from any intellectual operation. \nHowever, in a subsequent question (QsP; q.8) Brito also\npresents a way in which the actual universal can be said to exist in\nthe external world. For, as was explained above in Brito’s\nlogic, any cognition is an abstract or concrete intention depending on\nwhether we consider it from the perspective of the cognitive subject\nor from the perspective of the thing understood. Hence, the actual\nuniversal understood as a concrete intention (i.e., as the thing\nunderstood) has external existence, although not independently of the\nintellect. But understood as an abstract intention (i.e., from the\nperspective of the cognitive subject) the actual universal exists only\nin the soul (QsP; see Pinborg 1980: 114). \nIn sum, Brito’s realist position states that the universal has\nexternal existence in at least two senses: first, potentially, in the\nessence with the intrinsic capacity of becoming the object of\nuniversal cognition; second, actually, in the essence actually known\nthrough universal cognition by virtue of some of its modes of being.\n \nRadulphus Brito has been identified as the author of two anonymous\nsets of questions on Aristotle’s Ethics. The first one\n(previously known as the ‘Vatican commentary’) was\nascribed to Brito by Costa after a suggestion by René-Antoine\nGauthier (QEN; QE-2008: 99–137). The second\nset of questions, preserved in a sole manuscript, Vat. Lat. 2173, is\nstill unedited. The first one was written around 1295, when Brito was\na master of arts, and the second some years later, most likely when he\nwas studying theology. \nPhilosophical happiness is discussed in books I and X of Brito’s\ncommentaries on the Ethics. Following in the footsteps of\nAquinas (cf. Summa theologiae, I.II 3.4), Brito holds the\nessence of happiness to consist in the intellect’s actual\nknowledge of God and the separate substances. Happiness, thus, amounts\nto the intellectual union of man with the highest beings. But despite\nAquinas’ strong influence on his position, Brito’s notion\nof human happiness is still ‘radically Aristotelian’, as\nhe fervently defends the Aristotelian ideal of philosophical life, or\nbios theoretikos (QEN; QE-2008:\n171–176). As a result, Brito establishes the superiority of the\ncontemplative life over the active life (or of philosophical life over\npolitical life). The contemplative life is the highest form of life\nfor a rational creature and that towards which active life must aim as\nan end. This conception of philosophical happiness is the same we find\nin other Parisian commentaries on the Ethics from the same\nperiod, particularly the Anonymous of Paris (ms. BnF lat. 14698: see Costa\n2010), the Anonymous of\nErlangen (ms. Universitätsbibl. 213), the Anonymous of Erfurt\n(ms. Amplon. F. 13) and Giles of Orleans (ms. Paris, BnF lat. 16089). \nBrito’s accounts of human freedom and moral responsibility\nheavily depend on Godfrey of Fontaines. Godfrey, a theology master, is\nthe author of an important set of quodlibetal questions, where he\noffers a strongly intellectualist account of the psychology of human\nacts (or of free agency). After Aquinas’ death in 1274, two main\nnotions of human agency were opposed, especially among theologians. On\nthe one hand, voluntarist theologians proposed that intellect and will\nare the two main faculties of the intellectual soul, with the\nintellect being a cognitive power, and the will an active, or dynamic,\npower. Since the perfection of the will is greater than that of the\nintellect, will is the main agent of human action. Intellectual\nknowledge is only a condition sine qua non of free action. In\nother words, the intellect’s function is merely to present to\nthe will the objects of action. On the other hand, as a critical\nresponse to voluntarism, intellectualism proposes that the\nintellect’s main function is to act responsibly. Thus,\nintellectualist theologians, such as Godfrey, hold that the\nintellect’s function is not only to present to the will the\nobjects of action, but also to judge about the good and evil of\npossible actions. Moreover, voluntarist theologians consider will to\nbe an active power, whereas the intellectualists consider it a passive\none insofar as it is moved by the judgment it receives from the\nintellect. Accordingly, voluntarist theologians raise against the\nintellectualists the charge of determinism, since in the\nlatter’s position, the will’s action would not be properly\nfree. On the other hand, intellectualist theologians reject the\nvoluntarists’ consideration of will as a cognitive power, as it\nwould perform the intellect’s judgment about good and evil. \nFor Brito, free will (liberum arbitrium) depends entirely on\nintellectual judgment: \nWhen something appears to the will as a good, the will desires it,\nuntil deliberation and the intellect’s judgment make something\nelse to appear as being better. Thus, when the will is brought towards\na good object, it doesn’t pursue it immediately, but it first\ndeliberates about its contrary, its consequences, its accidents and\ncircumstances, and so the discourse of reason can make something,\nwhich appeared as good, appear as evil. And this is how free will\nworks. (QEN 60; QE-2008: 322) \nBrito thinks that the will necessarily desires something that appears\nas good. If there were no means to restrain the will, this would\ncertainly be a form of determinism. However, for Brito, the intellect\nhas the power to restrain the will. By deliberating about the extent\nto which the object is good, the intellect can eventually come upon\nnegative aspects in it and obstruct the action of the will.  \nRegarding the essence of moral virtue, Brito holds different positions\nin his two commentaries on the Ethics. In this change of\nposition, Brito reveals an interesting use of theological sources. In\nthe first commentary, he holds that will is the subject of justice,\nwhile the sensitive appetite is the subject of the remaining moral\nvirtues (QEN; QE-2008: 276–279,\n426–428). Here Brito roughly replicates Aquinas’ position\n(cf. Summa theologiae, II.II 58.4). However, in his second\ncommentary, Brito adopts the rather Aristotelian position of Godfrey\nof Fontaines (Quodl. \n XIV),[10]\n according to which all the moral\nvirtues are dispositions of the sensitive appetite. Thus, Brito\nopposes, on the one hand, Aquinas and Henry of Ghent, for whom all\nmoral virtues are dispositions of the will, and, on the other hand,\nPeter of Auvergne, for whom all virtues exist both in the will and in\nthe sensitive appetite.","contact.mail":"iacopo.costa@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
