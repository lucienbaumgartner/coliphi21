The traditional\ndoctrine that pictures represent objects by copying their appearance\nhad been challenged by art theorists since the first quarter of the\ntwentieth century, when what were thought of as illusionistic styles\nof painting lost favour, due to the growing prestige of so-called\n“primitive” artistic styles, and the fauvist and cubist\nexperiments of artists at that time. But it took several decades\nbefore philosophers became interested in these debates. When they did\nso, it was largely due to the impact of two books: Ernst\nGombrich’s Art and Illusion (1960), and Nelson\nGoodman’s Languages of Art (1968). Gombrich explored a\nvariety of problems about the nature of depiction, the evolution of\nstyle, and the nature of realism, drawing extensively on theories of\nvisual perception advanced since Helmholtz, and on Karl Popper’s\nfalsificationist theory of science. Goodman, by contrast defended a\npurely conventionalist theory of depiction in general and realistic\ndepiction in particular, which was rooted in the nominalist philosophy\nhe had developed in collaboration with W.V.O. Quine. A large part of\nthe philosophical work on this topic during the past fifty years\nconsists in attempts to develop theories of depiction in general, and\nrealistic depiction in particular, which overcome the objections to\ntheir views, while avoiding the simplifications and alleged cultural\nbias of the traditional ideas they rejected.\n\nResemblance theories of depiction are commonly traced to\nRepublic, book X, where Plato suggests that a painting of an\nobject is a mimesis (imitation or representation) of its\nshape and colour. The idea is intuitively plausible, and it provides\nthe basis for a variety of attempts by philosophers to define or\nanalyse the concept of a picture, or to explain how pictures\nrepresent. It is true that pictures represent things that do not have\nshapes or colours, such as God and Justice, but they do so by\ndepicting things that do have shapes and colours, such as bearded men\nand blindfolded women carrying scales. Accordingly, the basic thought\nthat underlies resemblance theories of depiction is that pictures are\ncomposed of shapes and colours that resemble the shapes and colours of\nthe visible objects they depict. But even if this provides an adequate\nstarting-point, a convincing theory of depiction needs to be\nelaborated with care, as Nelson Goodman (1968) showed. The simplistic\nclaim that A depicts B if and only if A\nappreciably resembles B is demonstrably false. According to\nGoodman “more error could hardly be compressed into so short a\nformula” (1968: 3–4). \nAs a matter of fact, the simplistic formula Goodman attacks was never\nproposed by Charles Sanders Peirce or his followers, such as Suzanne\nLanger (1942) and John Hospers (1947), whose semiotic theories were\nGoodman’s immediate target, or by any other philosopher or\ntheorist of art. Peirce described pictures as iconic signs,\ni.e., signs that signify objects by resembling them, and he contrasted\niconic signs with indices, which signify objects by standing in\nspatial, temporal or causal relations to them, and with\nsymbols, which signify objects by means of conventions\n(Peirce 1982, Vol. 2: 53–56). But this classification depends on\nthe basic idea of signification, which Peirce holds is a three-termed\nrelation between a sign, its object, and an\n“interpretant”, i.e., a thought of the object or a\ntranslation of the sign. Moreover, Peirce acknowledges that these\nthree categories of sign are not mutually exclusive, and that the\nsignification of a picture can also depend on iconographic\nconventions, and on its context of use. \nHence, Peirce’s conception of depiction is not captured by the\nformula Goodman criticizes. But arguably the formula has some\nheuristic value, because it draws attention to some of the challenges\na theory that explains depiction in terms of resemblance will need to\naddress. Thus, according to Goodman, resemblance is a reflexive and\nsymmetric relation, whereas representation is neither: an object\nresembles itself to the maximum degree but does not normally represent\nitself, and the object that a picture represents does not represent\nthe picture, although it resembles the picture to exactly the same\ndegree and in exactly the same respects as the picture resembles it.\nFurthermore, many pictures resemble other pictures, such as copies of\nthem, more closely than they resemble their objects, but they do not\nrepresent those pictures. “Plainly” Goodman concludes\n“resemblance in any degree is no sufficient condition for\nrepresentation”(1968: 4). \nAs we have indicated, Goodman’s initial challenge to resemblance\ntheories of depiction does not show that the approach is wrong. For\naccording to philosophers who favour the approach, the idea of\nresemblance is used to explain what makes a pictorial representation\nspecifically pictorial, rather than what makes it generically\nrepresentational. The depictive relation between a portrait and its\nsubject is indeed neither reflexive nor symmetric. But resemblance\nremains a candidate for explaining what makes a representation\npictorial or figurative, and therefore how a portrait of an individual\ndiffers from a text describing her appearance. For comparison, the\nreferential relation between the indexical “now” and the\ntime it refers to is neither reflexive nor symmetric, but this does\nnot prevent us from explaining how “now” refers to a\nspecific time in terms of simultaneity (between the use of the word\nand the time referred to), which is both. \nHowever, the example of a portrait brings us to another objection to\nresemblance theories of depiction, which Goodman mentions in passing\n(1968: 25), and others have accorded greater weight (Hopkins 1998b;\nAbell 2009). For if resemblance is a relation, and if the relata of a\nrelation must be existing particulars, then it appears that pictures\nthat represent fictional individuals (Zeus, Pegasus), and genre\npictures, which represent kinds of objects without representing any\nparticular instances of them, cannot resemble what they represent.\nHence, even if it is plausible that a resemblance theory can explain\nhow a portrait represents a sitter, it cannot provide a general\nexplanation of depiction. \nOne response to this argument is to claim that fictional characters\nare abstract entities that actually exist (Kripke 2013: 73). Another\nis to claim that a fictional character can be a genuine relatum of a\nrelation without existing: it is sufficient that it is capable of\nbeing identified, referred to, and described, and meeting these\nconditions does not require existence (Rundle 1979: 249; Sainsbury\n2005: ch. 6). But even if one of these responses is correct, and the\nobjection therefore fails to show that the concept of resemblance is\nunsuited to explaining how pictures represent fictional characters,\nthe problem of genre pictures remains. However, John Hyman (2012:\n129–132) has argued that the verb “resemble”\nsometimes expresses a relation and sometimes does not. For instance,\nin the sentence “Darwin resembles Socrates”,\n“resembles” expresses a relation, whereas in the sentence\n“Socrates resembles a satyr”, it is a copular (linking)\nverb. Thus, according to Hyman, “resembles”, “looks\nlike”, “is like”, etc. have the same kind of dual\nuse as “is”, which can either express identity or have a\ncopular function (Russell 1914: 48). If this is right, the objection\nalso fails to show that the concept of resemblance is unsuited to\nexplaining generic depiction (cf. Blumson 2014). \nGoodman places more weight on a third objection to resemblance\ntheories of depiction. A theory of this kind, he maintains, would need\nto specify the visible aspect or aspects of its object that a picture\nimitates or copies. But every object can be seen in many ways,\ndepending on the experience, interests, and attitudes of the viewer:\n“the object before me is a man, a swarm of atoms, a complex of\ncells, a fiddler, a friend, a fool and much more” (1968: 8).\nSince the artist cannot copy all of these aspects at once, all of the\nways the object is or looks, one might assume that her aim is to strip\naway the varnish of perceptual habit, prejudice or interpretation, and\ncapture the object as seen “under aseptic conditions by the free\nand innocent eye”. But, Goodman claims, following Ernst Gombrich\n(1960), “there is no innocent eye”: the idea that we can\naccess some raw visual data by means of “purification rites or\nby methodical disinterpretation” is a myth. Both “the way\nwe see and the way we depict depends upon and varies with experience,\npractice, interests, and attitudes” (Goodman 1968: 10). \nAccording to Goodman and Gombrich, resemblance theories of depiction\ndepend on the mistaken assumption that visual perceptions result from\na process of interpreting two-dimensional patterns of raw colour,\nwithout any intrinsic meaning, which artists are trained to observe\nand record. Psychologists such as Hermann von Helmholtz, artists such\nas Claude Monet, and art theorists such as John Ruskin embraced a\ntheory of painting of this kind. For instance, the passage by Ruskin\nfrom which Gombrich took the phrase “innocent eye” reads\nas follows: \nThe whole technical power of painting depends on our recovery of what\nmay be called the innocence of the eye; that is to say, of a\nsort of childish perception of these flat stains of colour, merely, as\nsuch, without consciousness of what they signify. (Gombrich 1960: 296;\nquoting Ruskin 1857: 6, note 1) \nGoodman and Gombrich associate this conception of painting with\nresemblance theories of depiction. But it is not an essential part of\nsuch a theory. If the depiction of an object depends on the imitation\nof its form and colour, it follows that an artist must be able to\nperceive these properties and reproduce them, but it does not follow\nthat we need to conceive of painting in the way Ruskin recommends. \nThe principal objections to resemblance theories of depiction may be\nunconvincing, but the challenge for such a theory is to specify the\nrespect or respects in which pictures resemble their objects, and this\nis not a simple task. Merely referring to ‘form and\ncolour’ is unsatisfactory. For as Descartes pointed out, it is\nunclear how the 2-D shape of a mark on the surface of a painting or\ndrawing can resemble the 3-D shape of an object it depicts; and the\nuse of foreshortening shows that rhombuses can represent squares\nbetter than squares, ovals can represent circles better than circles,\nand so on ([1637] 1985: I 165). Furthermore, some pictures (for\ninstance, cubist paintings) do not bear much obvious resemblance to\nthe objects they depict in either form or colour. Hence, the basic\nidea that depiction depends on resemblances in form and colour will\nneed to be specified in such a way as to meet what Dominic Lopes calls\nthe diversity constraint (Lopes 1996: 32), in other words, it\nwill need to accommodate the wide variety of styles of picture-making.\nDifferent resemblance theorists have responded to these challenges in\ndifferent ways. \nJohn Hyman and Catherine Abell have proposed different theories of\ndepiction in which the idea of resemblance plays a significant role.\nHyman rejects the theory that pictures are iconic signs (2012: 127),\nbut he claims that there is a strict and invariable relationship\nbetween the shapes and colours on a picture’s surface and the\nshapes and colours of the objects it represents. Hyman’s theory\ndepends on Gottlob Frege’s distinction between sense and\nreference (see §3.2 of the  entry on\n Frege).\n Taking one of Frege’s own examples, the phrases “the\nmorning star” and “the evening star” have the same\nreference, but different senses, or modes of presentation. Both\nphrases refer to one and the same object, the planet Venus, but they\ndescribe or present it as a star that is visible at different times of\nday. Similarly, two portraits of the same individual may present him\nas dark-haired and seated, wearing a black smock\n (Kramskoy’s 1873 portrait of Tolstoy),\n or as grey-haired and standing, wearing a white smock\n (Repin’s 1901 portrait).\n They portray (refer to) the same individual, but they present him\ndifferently (they differ in sense). The distinction matters, Hyman\nargues, because resemblances do not explain a picture’s\nreference, they explain its sense. (The claim that A depicts\nB if and only if A appreciably resembles B, which\nGoodman criticizes, is about depiction qua portrayal, i.e.,\npictorial reference, not sense.) \nAccording to Hyman, the sense or mode of presentation of a picture,\nexpressed in the most general terms, is an aspect or view of an object\nor arrangement of objects, relative to an implicit point (or a variety\nof points) of view. (An “object” in this sense is not\nnecessarily a “material object”, it might be a shadow, a\nrainbow, or part of the sky.) Different parts of a picture can present\ndifferent aspects of an object or its parts, corresponding to\ndifferent points of view, but nothing can be depicted independently of\na point of view. Otherwise, Hyman points out, \n[we could] discover different aspects of an object represented in a\npicture by moving around it and studying it from different angles, as\nwe can in the case of a free-standing sculpture. (2012: 142) \nHyman’s principal claim is that the sense or mode of\npresentation of a picture is defined by the colours and shapes of the\nmarks on its surface in accordance with definite optical principles\nconcerning colour and shape (2006: ch. 5; see also Hopkins 1998a: 27).\nWe shall concentrate on shape. \nHyman’s shape-principle employs the concept of an object’s\nocclusion shape, i.e., the 2-D cross-section of the cone of\nlight it subtends to a viewer’s eye. (The concept is similar to\nHopkins’s outline shape; see below,\n §3.2.)\n For example, the occlusion shape of a circular coin viewed obliquely\nis an ellipse. This shape, Hyman argues, is a visible property of the\ncoin. It is especially salient when an object is backlit, and appears\nin silhouette. It is relative to a point of view, and changes as the\npoint of view changes. But Hyman insists that relative does not mean\nsubjective. An object’s occlusion shape “is not merely a\nfeature of the viewer’s experience. It belongs to optics, not\npsychology” (2012: 143; cf. Peacocke 1987). Hyman’s\nshape-principle is that the shape of a region on a picture’s\nsurface (or, in the case of anamorphic pictures, its occlusion shape\nrelative to the intended point of view of a spectator) is identical to\nthe occlusion shape of the object it represents, relative to the\nimplicit point of view. In other words, there is an exact resemblance\nbetween these shapes (2006: 81). \nAccording to Hyman, this principle captures an exact relationship\nbetween the marks on a picture’s surface and the picture’s\nsense, which does not depend on the artist’s intention, or on\nthe picture’s psychological effect on a spectator, and which\napplies to pictures regardless of their style or the artistic\ntradition to which they belong. Together with a principle concerning\ncolour, it is supposed to explain how the colours and shapes on the\nsurface of a picture fix the colours and shapes of the objects it\ndepicts. But Hyman’s optical principles do not imply that a\nportrait of Tolstoy resembles Tolstoy, since they are only concerned\nwith a picture’s sense, as opposed to its reference. Nor do they\nimply that a painting of a bearded man resembles a bearded man, since\nthey are only concerned with the shapes and colours of the objects in\na picture. Hyman therefore claims that his theory dovetails neatly\nwith the idea that a picture’s reference is normally determined\nby the artist’s intention, and with the idea that the depiction\nof objects of specific kinds, such as men and horses, depends on a\npicture’s propensity to trigger a spectator’s ability to\nrecognize these kinds of objects by their shapes and colours, and the\nshapes and colours of their parts (see below,\n §3.2).\n He explains how these two elements of a theory of depiction can be\ncombined with the example of a silhouette: \nthe black shapes the silhouettist has cut out fix the occlusion shapes\nof the objects represented and their parts, relative to an implicit\nline of sight. And the spectator’s ability to recognize, say, a\ngirl or a cat, enables him to see a girl or a cat depicted in a\nsilhouette by seeing its occlusion shape and the occlusion shapes of\nits parts. (2012: 113) \nHyman’s theory has been criticised on various grounds. First,\nand most generally, Michael Podro argues that it expresses a bias in\nfavour of realistic or literal representation (Podro 2010: 457).\nHowever, Hyman replies that the optical principles he defines\n“do not dictate or limit the forms artists create, the models\nthey follow, or the values they embody in their work”, any more\nthan English grammar limits the imagination of English poets (Hyman\n2012: 145). Second, it has been alleged that Hyman’s theory\ncannot explain “the depiction of nonexistent objects”\n(Abell 2009: 195). However, this objection depends on the questionable\nassumption that resemblance is invariably a relation between existing\nparticulars (see above\n §1.1).\n Third, it has been argued that indeterminacies in the occlusion\nshapes of objects represented in a picture may not match the\nindeterminacies in the shapes of the parts of the picture that depict\nthem (Kulvicki 2014: 61–62). Finally, it has been argued more\ngenerally that the exact correspondences in shape and colour between\nthe surface of a picture and its content, which Hyman’s theory\npredicts, sometimes break down; and that the correspondences which do\nexist depend on contingent features of the human visual system (Newall\n2006; Hyman 2007; Newall 2011). \nThe last objection reflects the most widely accepted reason for\nrejecting resemblance theories such as Hyman’s, in which the\nbasic mechanism of depiction is defined without reference either to\nthe visual experience of a spectator, or to the changing cultural\ncontext in which pictures are made. Catharine Abell has defended a\nresemblance theory of depiction which differs from Hyman’s in\nboth of these respects, and is designed to avoid the objections\nmentioned above. It is also a more ambitious theory, both because\nAbell does not distinguish between the sense and reference of a\npicture, but aims to explain both at once, and because she explains\nthe depiction of specific kinds of objects, such as men and horses, in\nterms of resemblance, instead of confining the scope of the theory to\nthe shapes and colours of the objects in a picture. Unlike Hyman,\nAbell does not specify which particular respects of resemblance are\nnecessary for depiction, beyond the requirement that they should be\nvisible (2009: 199), arguing instead that “different respects of\nresemblance govern different instances of depiction” (2009:\n196), including resemblance in respect of optical properties, such as\nocclusion shape, and response-dependent properties, such as when\npainters mimic the effect of simultaneous contrast. \nDrawing on Paul Grice’s seminal article “Meaning”\n(Grice 1957), Abell argues that the respects of resemblance governing\na particular picture depend on the artist’s communicative\nintentions: \nA picture’s resemblance to some object O in a given\nrespect(s) is relevant to determining what the picture depicts if its\nmaker intended the picture to resemble O in the relevant\nrespect(s) and thus to bring O to viewers’ minds; and\nintended that these resemblances have this effect in part because\nviewers recognize that intention. (2009: 201; cf. Blumson 2009 and\n2014) \nAccording to Abell, a picture depicts some object O only if it\nresembles O in a range of relevant respects, and if it thereby\ncaptures O’s “overall appearance”, enabling a\nspectator to distinguish it from objects for which it would not\nordinarily be mistaken (2009: 210). As noted above, Abell regards\npictures of objects that do not actually exist as problematic for\nresemblance theories of depiction. Her solution to the problem\ncombines two ideas: first, a picture of an object that does not\nactually exist, but could exist, such as a gold mountain,\nwould resemble the object, if it did exist; second, we can\nmake-believe that a fictional character such as Sherlock Holmes\nexists, and make-believe that a picture resembles him (2009:216). \nAbell argues that because she does not specify which particular\nrespects of resemblance are necessary for depiction, her theory is\nconsistent with the diversity constraint, in other words, it\naccommodates the wide variety of stylistic conventions that have\ndeveloped in different artistic traditions. However, it can be\nobjected that it fails to accommodate another alleged constraint on an\nadequate resemblance theory of depiction identified by Lopes, which he\ncalls the independence constraint. According to Lopes, a\nspectator must be able to perceive the resemblances postulated by a\nresemblance theory of depiction “without first knowing”\nwhat a picture represents (Lopes 2005a: 16–17). In fact, this\nobjection only applies to a theory which implies that a spectator\nperceives a certain kind of object in a picture by perceiving a\nresemblance between the marks on its surface and an object of\nthis kind, and a resemblance theory need not have this implication.\nHowever, Abell accepts that the objection applies to her own theory,\nespecially since she holds that the “respects of\nresemblance” that “govern” a picture depend on the\nartist’s communicative intentions, and that a spectator’s\nknowledge of these intentions is gained, at least in part, from the\npicture itself. However, she addresses the objection by highlighting\nalternative, context-specific sources of information about them (Abell\n2005, 2009; cf. Blumson 2014). \nResemblance theories of depiction differ from one another in\nsignificant ways. But they agree on the following crucial point: the\nfundamental difference between pictorial and linguistic representation\nconsists in the fact that the former depends on resemblances between\nrepresentations and the objects they represent, whereas the latter\ndoes not. It is widely agreed that linguistic representation depends\non conventions that create the vocabulary of a language and the\nsemantically significant structures in which the elements of its\nvocabulary are combined. But the contribution words and structures\nmake to the meaning of a sentence are hardly ever explained by\nresemblance. If there are exceptions, such as onomatopoeia, they\nconfirm the rule. \nArt theorists such as Roman Jakobson challenged this division between\npictorial art and language early in the twentieth century (Jakobson\n[1921/1971] 1987), reacting against what were thought of as\nillusionistic styles of painting. Once it was understood that artistic\nstyles are comparable to languages or codes, it was thought, artists\nwould feel freer to abandon academic conventions, to follow\n“primitive” models, and to participate in the fauvist and\ncubist experiments of Matisse, Picasso, and Braque (Bois 1987).\nConventionalism was well established by the 1950s. For example, the\nfollowing remark appears in an article by the American art historian\nLeo Steinberg entitled “The Eye Is a Part of the Mind”,\nwhich anticipates Gombrich’s and Goodman’s stance on the\n“innocent eye” (see above\n §1.1): \n“Technical capacity in the imitation of nature” simply\ndoes not exist. What does exist is the skill of reproducing handy\ngraphic symbols for natural appearances, of rendering familiar facts\nby set professional conventions. (Steinberg [1953] 1972: 198 \nHowever, the first attempt to defend a conventionalist theory of art\nsystematically and in detail was made in Goodman’s book\nLanguages of Art. \nGoodman accepts that pictures may resemble the objects they depict,\nbut he denies that this explains why they depict them: \nA picture that represents—like a passage that describes—an\nobject refers to and, more particularly, denotes it. Denotation is the\ncore of representation and is independent of resemblance. (1968:\n5) \nGoodman does not define denotation, beyond describing it as a variety\nof reference, but two features of his conception of denotation should\nbe noted. First, it is supposed to be the relation in which a name\nstands to its bearer, or a predicate stands to the members of its\nextension, or a portrait stands to its subject. Hence the\ncontroversial doctrine that predicates and names have the same\nsemantic function is implicit in Goodman’s theory of depiction\n(Geach 1972; Strawson 1976; Hyman 2006: 185–190). Second,\nGoodman’s nominalist theory of properties excludes the\npossibility that a symbol denotes an object because it resembles it\n(Arrell 1987: 42). For he does not merely make the uncontroversial\nobservation that an object is gray if and only if “gray”\napplies to it, he claims that the properties an object has depends\non what predicates apply to it (Goodman 1968: 51, 54–55).\nIn other words, “gray” does not denote an object because\nit has the property of being gray; on the contrary, it has the\nproperty because “gray” denotes it. Equally, the same\npredicates do not denote different individuals because they resemble\neach other, or have properties in common. On the contrary, they\nresemble each other, or have properties in common, because the same\npredicates denote them. Hence, resemblance is explained by, and\ntherefore cannot itself explain, denotation. \nAccording to Goodman, pictorial symbol systems differ from linguistic\nones in being analog and relatively replete, an\nanalog system being one that is syntactically and\nsemantically dense. (For reasons of space we shall not\ndiscuss the relationship between analog and dense;\nsee Lewis 1971 and Haugeland 1981.) A pictorial system is\nsyntactically dense because it provides for a dense set of\npictorial characters, in other words, a set containing infinitely many\npictures “so ordered that between each two there is a\nthird” (Goodman 1968: 136), and it is semantically\ndense because it provides for a dense set of classes of denotata.\n(By contrast, the Arabic numeral system for denoting the natural\nnumbers provides for infinitely many characters—“1”,\n“2”, “3” …, “11”,\n“12”, “13” …, etc.—but there is a\n“gap” between each numeral and its successor, and between\neach of the corresponding natural numbers and its successor:\nthe system is articulate, not dense.) Finally, a\npictorial system is relatively replete because relatively\nmany properties of a picture are relevant to its interpretation: \nAny thickening or thinning of the line, its colour, its contrast with\nthe background, its size, even the qualities of the paper-none of\nthese is ruled out, none can be ignored. (Goodman 1968: 229) \nThus, whereas different instances of the same written letter, word or\nsentence can differ widely in appearance, pictures that differ in\nappearance, in any one of many different ways, and however small the\ndifference is, will also differ in what they represent. \nThus, Goodman’s principal claims are these: \nAll three claims have been contested. \nThe first difficulty with (1) is that a set is dense only relative to\nan ordering. For example, the set of natural numbers can be given a\ndense ordering, but it is not dense in the familiar 1, 2, 3, …\nordering. In the first edition of Languages of Art, Goodman\ndoes not explain what ordering of pictures he has in mind, but in the\nrevised edition he states that \nthe ordering in question is understood to be such that any element\nlying between two others is less discriminable from each of them than\nthey are from each other. (1976: 136) \nThis raises two questions. First, is an ordering of pictures of this\nkind possible? Second, Goodman’s ordering appears to depend on\ndegrees of resemblance, albeit between signs as opposed to between\nsigns and denotata. But is this reintroduction of the concept of\nresemblance compatible with his nominalist theory of properties and\nhis attack on the doctrine of the “innocent eye”? \nThe second difficulty with (1) is that digital photographs would\nnormally be classified as pictures along with analog ones (Bach 1970;\nKulvicki 2006); and some diagrams, which would not normally\nbe classified as pictures, are analog and relatively replete (Peacocke\n1987). Furthermore, outline drawings are less replete than diagrams in\nwhich not only shape but also colour affects what they represent, but\nthe former would normally be classified as pictures, whereas the\nlatter would not (Schier 1986; Kulvicki 2006). Goodman acknowledges\nthat “some old and vague boundaries are transgressed, some\nsignificant new alliances and alienations effected” by the\nclassification of symbol systems he defends (1968: 232), but it is\ndebatable how revisionist his theory can be, without ceasing to be a\ntheory of depiction. For we want to know how pictures,\nincluding digital photographs, represent. It is possible to\nclaim, in reply, that depiction is not the unitary phenomenon we\nnaïvely imagine it to be. But this cannot be established merely\nby showing that Goodman’s theory of symbols precludes a unitary\nexplanation of depiction. \nThe principal ground on which philosophers have contested (2) is that\nit is inconsistent with the so-called natural generativity of\npictures. The argument is originally due to Flint Schier (1986:\n43–55), but it is also advanced by Richard Wollheim: \nif I can recognize a picture of a cat, and I know what a dog looks\nlike, then I can be expected to recognize a picture of a dog. But on\n[Goodman’s] view this ought to be baffling. It should be as\nbaffling as if, knowing that the French word “chat” means\na cat, and knowing what dogs look like, I should, on hearing it, be\nable to understand what the word “chien” means. (1987:\n77) \nHowever, there appear to be conventional symbol systems, such as\nguitar tablature, in which natural generativity occurs. Hence, it is\narguable that Schier and Wollheim mistook a disanalogy between\npictures and words for a disanalogy between pictures and conventional\nsigns in general. \n(3) invites two questions. First, what explains the fact that a\npicture has a particular denotation, e.g., that Goya’s portrait\ndenotes the Duke of Wellington? Second, denotation is a\nrelation—the relation between a name and its bearer, or between\na predicate and the members of its extension. So Goodman’s\ntheory also faces the question raised earlier about resemblance\ntheories of depiction, regarding pictures of fictional individuals\n(Zeus, Pegasus), and genre pictures. If the relata of a relation must\nbe existing particulars, then it appears that pictures of these kinds\ncannot denote what they depict. So how do they depict them? \nRegarding the first question, Wittgenstein claims that “An\nobvious, and correct, answer to the question ‘What makes a\nportrait the portrait of so-and-so?’ is that it is the\nintention” (1958: 32). But Goodman disagrees. He acknowledges\nthat intentions are “usually involved” in setting up\nsymbol systems, as they are in building bridges, “but in both\ncases, we can study the results independently of the thoughts of the\nmakers” (1972: 125). He claims that what a painting or drawing\ndenotes pictorially depends solely on the arrangement of colours on\nits surface, and the semantic and syntactic conventions that define\nthe symbol system to which it belongs (1968: 42). But it seems to\nfollow that few portraits, if any, portray a single individual, as\nopposed to every member of a class of similar individuals. For if\npictures are effectively predicate-like symbols in a pictorial system,\nthen unless X is the sole individual satisfying a portrait,\ni.e., unless the portrait is a uniquely identifying pictorial\n“description” of X, X is not the only\nsubject of the portrait, the sole individual it portrays. Furthermore,\nit is hard to see how one can paint an inaccurate portrait of someone,\njust as it is hard to see how one can use an inaccurate description to\nrefer to someone (e.g., “The man drinking a martini is\nmy brother”, when he is actually drinking a daiquiri), if whom\none refers to depends purely on the syntax and semantics of the phrase\n(Kripke 1977). \nRegarding the second question, concerning pictures of fictional\nindividuals and genre pictures, Goodman argues that the verbs\n“depict” and “represent” are “highly\nambiguous” (1968: 22). In the sentence “Goya’s\nportrait represents the Duke of Wellington”,\n“represents” is a two-place predicate, expressing a\nrelation, and the sentence as a whole identifies the denotation of\nGoya’s portrait; whereas in the sentence “Rubens’\npainting represents Pegasus”, “represents” is part\nof a one-place predicate, and the sentence as a whole classifies or\ncharacterizes Rubens’ painting without implying that it denotes\nanything at all. Thus, pictures with null denotation are comparable to\npredicates or descriptions with null denotation, such as “flying\nhorse” or “largest prime number”. We can distinguish\nbetween a picture of a centaur and a picture of a unicorn, even though\nthey denote exactly the same objects (i.e., none), because they are\ninstances of different characters in a symbol system that we\nunderstand. The symbol system consists of rules “correlating\nsymbols with denotata” (1968: 228), but it provides for pictures\nwith null denotation. \nFinally, according to Goodman, a pictorial symbol system consists of\nrules correlating symbols with denotata, but he does not propose a\nsingle example of such a rule. He refers to “the traditional\nWestern system of representation” (1968: 226), but he does not\nbegin to formulate its rules. It is uncontroversial that various kinds\nof customs, rules and conventions are involved in making pictures,\nincluding technical procedures, iconographic conventions, rules of\ncomposition, and so on. But none of these have the function of\ncorrelating symbols with denotata, and it is doubtful whether\npictorial rules of this specific kind exist (Hyman 2006:\n174–175). \nDespite these objections to Goodman’s theory of depiction, it\ncontinues to exert an influence on philosophers of art. For example,\nJohn Kulvicki has recently defended a theory that is designed to\naddress some of the arguments above, and to incorporate some of the\nideas advanced by Goodman’s opponents, while retaining\nGoodman’s principal ideas. In particular, Kulvicki agrees with\nGoodman that a picture is a symbol in a denotative system, and that a\ndenotative system is pictorial in virtue of its structure, rather than\nany resemblance between its symbols and the objects they denote\n(Kulvicki 2006: 13). But it is difficult to be certain how far he\nshares Goodman’s approach to the semantics of pictures, and of\nsymbols generally. In particular, Kulvicki relies on the idea that\npictures have different kinds of content (see below), but it\nis unclear whether he agrees with Goodman’s reduction of content\nto denotation (1968: 27–29), and whether he shares\nGoodman’s general commitment to extensionalism (see \n§3.1 of the entry on\n Nelson Goodman),\n or whether he agrees with Frege that as well as having a reference or\ndenotation, names and descriptions also express a sense. \nAccording to Kulvicki, the semantic features of a picture are the\n“features the picture depicts its scene as having”, while\nits syntactic features are the colour and shape properties that are\n“relevant to the semantics of the picture” (2014:\n92–93). Not all of a picture’s colour and shape properties\nqualify as syntactic features. For example, the brownish colour of a\nsepia photograph is merely an “incidental” feature.\nKulvicki argues that a pictorial symbol system has four\ncharacteristics: (a) repleteness, i.e., a relatively wide\nrange of properties of a picture qualify as syntactic features, e.g.,\ncolour, thickness of lines, etc.; (b) sensitivity, i.e.,\nsmall changes to a picture in respect of any of these properties are\nsyntactically significant (cf. Bach 1970: 128–132); (c)\nrichness, i.e., “there are at least as many possible\ndenotations in the system as there are syntactic types”\n(Kulvicki 2006: 38); (d) transparency, i.e., if part of a\npicture X depicts a picture Y, then that part of\nX has the syntactic features that Y is depicted as\nhaving. \nRepleteness, sensitivity and richness are\nexplained, and compared with Goodman’s relative repleteness,\nsyntactic density and semantic density, in Kulvicki 2006\n(29–46). But Kulvicki explores transparency in most detail,\ndeducing in particular the following consequence: that a picture\nresembles the scene it represents in respect of a limited\nrange of colour and shape properties, such as “the abstract\npattern of light and dark” recorded by a black-and-white\nphotograph (2014: 101). Kulvicki calls this range of properties the\npicture’s “bare bones content”, following Haugeland\n1991. He does not attempt to define the colour- and shape-properties\nit consists in, but like Hyman, he suggests that the resemblance he\npostulates between a picture and the scene it represents partially\nexplains how the normal experience of perceiving what a picture\nrepresents occurs. A picture’s “fleshed out content”\n(i.e., the content identified in a normal description of a picture: a\nhorse, a man, etc.) depends on its propensity to trigger a\nspectator’s ability to recognize kinds of objects by the shape-\nand colour-properties included in its bare bones content: \nSeeing a fleshed out content results from deploying concepts as a\nresult of seeing the picture surface—and thus registering its\nbare bones content—that do not apply to the picture surface.\nWhich concepts we deploy depends on what recognitionally keyed\nconcepts we have, which determines the perceptual salience of a given\nfleshed out content. (2006: 173–174) \nThe main questions critics have raised about Kulvicki’s theory\nare as follows. First, it is designed to avoid some of the objections\nto Goodman’s theory, notably the fact that there are digital\npictures as well as analog ones, but other objections remain,\nespecially those concerning Goodman’s doctrine that denotation\nis “the core of representation”. Second, it is unclear\nwhat role Kulvicki accords to the artist’s intention in the\ntheory of depiction. The question is ignored in Kulvicki 2006, as it\nis in Goodman 1968. In Kulvicki 2014, by contrast, he suggests that\npictures “represent in virtue of the intentions of their\nmakers” (2014: 156), but he does not discuss the scope of this\nprinciple (e.g., whether it applies to the sense or reference of a\npicture, or to both) or how precisely the role of intention should be\ndefined. Finally, Kulvicki’s explicit disagreement with Goodman\nfocuses on how the relationships between the symbols in a pictorial\nsystem should be defined. But it is debatable whether the four\nconditions he stipulates are in fact necessary and sufficient for\ndepiction. Some alleged counter-examples are discussed in Blumson\n2011, Newall 2011, and Kulvicki 2012. \nExperiential theories seek to explain depiction in terms of the kind\nof experience a picture causes in a spectator, rather than the kind of\nrepresentational system to which a picture allegedly belongs, or the\nspectator-independent resemblance or isomorphism between a picture and\nthe objects it depicts, or the subpersonal cognitive mechanisms a\npicture may be thought to engage. It remains an open question whether\ntheories of this kind can avoid the charge of circularity, in other\nwords, whether it is possible to define the experience of seeing what\na picture represents without employing the concept of depiction. But\neven among philosophers who believe that this is possible,\nthe exact nature of the experience has been a matter of debate. \nThe simplest experiential theory is that a picture depicts an object\nof a certain kind by causing a spectator to have the visual experience\nshe would normally have if she saw the kind of object it depicts.\nDescartes’ remarks about depiction in his Optics\nsuggest a theory of this kind: \nThe problem is to know simply how [pictures] can enable the soul to\nhave sensory perceptions of all the various qualities of the objects\nto which they correspond—not to know how they can resemble these\nobjects. ([1637] 1985: I, 166) \nMichael Newall has recently defended the theory that “pictures\noccasion non-veridical seeing of their subject-matter” (Newall\n2011: 42), which can be interpreted as an endorsement of\nDescartes’s position. But it is generally thought that Descartes\nassimilates pictures in general to trompes l’oeil,\nwhose purpose is (or is commonly thought to be) to cause spectators to\nexperience a kind of illusion. The experiential theories philosophers\nadvocate today tend to define the experience caused by pictures\ndifferently, for this reason. (Newall distinguishes between his own\ntheory and the theory that pictorial experience is a kind of illusion\nin Newall 2011: 23–30.) \nThe most important twentieth-century source of experiential theories\nis Ernst Gombrich’s book Art and Illusion (1960), based\non the Mellon Lectures he delivered in 1956. In this pathbreaking\nbook, Gombrich argues that realistic or naturalistic pictures\ndo approximate to trompes l’oeil. Indeed, as\nWollheim points out, \nthe two sets of terms, “naturalism”,\n“naturalistic” on the one hand, “illusion”,\n“illusionistic” on the other, are used interchangeably \nin Art and Illusion (Wollheim 1963: 25). However, no general\ntheory of depiction is presented in Art and Illusion,\nalthough Gombrich compares the perception of pictorial content with\nthe phenomenon of aspect-switching or “seeing as”. He\nintroduces “seeing as” with the ambiguous drawing of a\nduck or a rabbit that Wittgenstein’s Philosophical\nInvestigations had made famous (Wittgenstein 1953: 194): \nWe can see the picture as either a rabbit or a duck. It is easy to\ndiscover both readings. It is less easy to describe what happens when\nwe switch from one interpretation to the other. Clearly we do not have\nthe illusion that we are confronted with a “real” duck or\nrabbit. The shape on the paper resembles neither animal very closely.\nAnd yet there is no doubt that the shape transforms itself in some\nsubtle way. (Gombrich 1960: 5) \nThe significance of the ambiguous image is meant to be that it makes\nus aware of a process that the perception of pictorial content\nalways involves: the process of making a “tentative\nprojection, a trial shot which transforms the image if it turns out to\nbe a hit.” “Ambiguity—rabbit or duck?—is\nclearly the key to the whole problem of image reading” (1960:\n198). Gombrich is commonly described as proposing an “illusion\ntheory” of depiction (e.g., Lopes 1996: 37; Newall 2011: 2), but\nhe emphatically disavowed any such intention, pointing out that the\ntitle of the lectures on which Art and Illusion was based was\nThe Visible World and the Language of Art: \n[I] never dreamed that this title [Art and Illusion] would\nconvey to some that I considered illusion, or even deception, the main\naim of art. (Gombrich 1973: 195) \nGombrich explores a variety of fertile ideas in Art and\nIllusion, about the history of style, about realism in the visual\narts, and about the relationship between the content of a\nrepresentation and its use in imaginative play, some of which we shall\nreturn to below. But the comparison between seeing pictures and seeing\naspects provides the focus of Richard Wollheim’s criticism of\nGombrich’s ideas, out of which he develops his own theory of\ndepiction. \nWollheim interprets Gombrich as claiming that a spectator cannot be\nsimultaneously conscious of the marks on a picture’s surface and\nthe scene it represents, and that these can only be objects of\nalternating perceptions, although Gombrich does not say this\nexplicitly (Wollheim 1963; cf. Bantinaki 2007). But according to\nWollheim himself, simultaneous awareness of surface and content is\nprecisely what is distinctive about the experience of seeing a\npicture. Furthermore, these are two distinguishable but\n“inseparable” aspects of a single visual experience, and\nnot two experiences somehow combined (Wollheim 1987, 1998, 2003a,b;\nWollheim does not attempt to define a criterion of identity for\nexperiences, so this claim is difficult to assess). Thus, the\nexperience of seeing a picture has a sui generis\nphenomenology, which Wollheim calls “twofoldness”. The two\naspects of this experience—its configurational aspect\nand its recognitional aspect—are held to be\npsychologically real and to be integrated in a way that also affects\nthe phenomenal character of the experience as a whole. \nWollheim names this twofold visual experience “seeing-in”,\nbut he explains that it is not confined to pictures. For example, it\ncan also occur if we follow Leonardo’s famous advice to discover\nlandscapes, battles and grotesque faces in the stains on an old\nwall. \nSeeing-in is a distinct kind of perception, and it is triggered by the\npresence within the field of vision of a differentiated surface.\n[…] When the surface is right, then an experience with a\ncertain phenomenology will occur, and it is this phenomenology that is\ndistinctive about seeing-in. […] The distinctive\nphenomenological feature I call ‘twofoldness’, because,\nwhen seeing-in occurs, two things happen: I am visually aware of the\nsurface I look at, and I discern something standing out in front of,\nor (in certain cases) receding behind, something else. (Wollheim 1987:\n46) \nAccording to Wollheim, a genealogical parable reveals how\n“representation can be explained in terms of\nseeing-in”: \nIn a community where seeing-in is firmly established, some member of\nthe community—let us call him (prematurely) an artist—sets\nabout marking a surface with the intention of getting others around\nhim to see some definite thing in it: say, a bison. If the\nartist’s intention is successful to the extent that a bison can\nbe seen in the surface as he has marked it, then the community closes\nranks in that someone who does indeed see a bison in it is now held to\nsee the surface correctly, and anyone is held to see it incorrectly if\nhe sees, as he might, something else in it, or nothing at all. Now the\nmarked surface represents a bison. (Wollheim 1987: 46) \nThis is not meant to be piece of speculative history. The purpose of\nthe story is to show that depiction occurs when the marks on a surface\nare successfully designed to make the seeing-in experience occur. It\nis not enough that this experience should occur. It must, when it\noccurs, fulfil the intention of the “artist”. Notice that\nfor Wollheim, neither trompe l’oeils nor purely\nabstract paintings (i.e., abstract paintings that do not solicit the\nperception of figure-ground relations), are depictions, although they\nmay resemble depictions in certain ways and embody some of the same\naesthetic values. Purely abstract paintings do not produce an\nexperience with the “recognitional” aspect of seeing in,\nwhereas trompes l’oeil do not produce an experience\nwith its “configurational” aspect. \nWollheim’s theory has been widely discussed and criticised (see\nespecially van Gerwen 2001; Kemp & Mras 2016; Jagnow 2019).\nThe principal objections to it are the following. First, the\nimplication that trompe l’oeils are not\nrepresentational has been contested (Lopes 1996: 49–50; Levinson\n[1998] 2001; Newall 2009: 25–26; for a critical assessment of\nWollheim’s conception of abstract painting see Caldarola 2012).\nSecond, the suggestion that the figure-ground relationship is a\nuniversal feature of depiction has been challenged (Hyman 2006).\nThird, Wollheim proposes that the standard of correctness, which\ndetermines whether the spectator has correctly perceived the content\nof a picture, “is set … for each painting by the\nintentions of the artist in so far as they are fulfilled”\n(Wollheim 1987: 46). But this appears to oversimplify the relationship\nbetween the representational content of a picture and the content\nintended by the artist. It is well known that the meaning of an\nuttered sentence can diverge from the intended meaning of the speaker,\nand hard to see why the same should not apply to a picture (see \n§4 of the entry on\n Paul Grice;\n cf. Terrone forthcoming). Fourth, Wollheim declines to offer a detailed\ncharacterisation of seeing in, which explains (a) how the experience\nof seeing a certain kind of object in a surface is related to the\nexperience of seeing the same kind of object face to face (he\ndescribes these experiences as “incommensurable” (1987:\n47)); or (b) how the experience of seeing one certain kind of\nobject in a surface differs from the experience of seeing\nanother kind of object in a surface (Budd 2008a; Hopkins\n1998a). Finally, Wollheim’s theory is unable to explain the fact\nthat objects are necessarily depicted from an implicit point of view\n(Hopkins 1998a). Finally—a development rather than an\nobjection—it has been argued that, at least in the case of\npictures that have a reference as well as a sense, the experience of\nseeing a picture has a third aspect, i.e. it is\n“threefold” rather than merely “twofold”, as\nWollheim suggests (see Brough 2012; Nanay 2018; Mion 2019; cf.\nVoltolini 2018). \nDespite these objections, and the elusive character of his writing,\nWollheim’s theory became the key point of reference for\nsubsequent experiential theories of depiction. \nExperienced resemblance: As noted above, experiential\ntheories explain depiction in terms of the kind of experience a\npicture causes in a spectator. The two most influential theories that\nhave sought to define this experience more precisely than Wollheim\ndoes are due to Christopher Peacocke and Robert Hopkins, and the\nprincipal concept both employ is that of experienced\nresemblance. \nConsider the experience of being struck by someone’s resemblance\nto another person one already knows well, e.g., when one sees the\ngrown-up child of an old friend for the first time in several years.\n(We might speak here of seeing the parent ‘in’ the child.)\nNo doubt there is a resemblance—in bone-structure,\npigmentation, etc.—with a genetic explanation. But we can\ndescribe the experience as an experience of a resemblance,\nindependently of whether the resemblance actually exists, in what\nrespects, or why. According to theories that employ the concept of\nexperienced resemblance, this is comparable to (though not exactly\nlike) the experience a spectator has when she sees what a picture\nrepresents. Hence, the assumption (made by or attributed to Wollheim\ninter alia) that the object or scene represented by a picture\nis itself somehow perceived by the spectator, or present in\nher experience, is rejected by those who explain depiction in terms of\nexperienced resemblance. \nAccording to Peacocke (1987: 386–388), a design or configuration\nof marks on a surface depicts a certain kind of object φ if, and\nonly if, it is successfully designed to occupy a region of the\nspectator’s two-dimensional visual field that she experiences as\nsimilar in shape to a region in which a φ could be presented, but\nwithout being experienced (as a sculpture representing a φ might\nbe) as occupying a three-dimensional region of physical space similar\nto one which could be occupied by a φ. The details of\nPeacocke’s account have been criticized (see Hopkins 1998a; Budd\n2008b; Voltolini 2015), but his appeal to experienced resemblance in\nthe explanation of depiction proved influential. \nThe most widely discussed development of Wollheim’s approach is\nby Robert Hopkins. Hopkins adopts Wollheim’s term “seeing-in” to\nrefer to the kind of visual experience a picture is allegedly designed\nto produce. He agrees with Peacocke that seeing-in can be defined in\nterms of experienced resemblance, but he argues that seeing-in is an\nexperience of resemblance in outline shape between the marks\non the surface of a picture and the object or arrangement of objects\nthey represent, rather than shape in the two-dimensional visual field\n(Hopkins 1998a). Outline shape, Hopkins explains, is “a property of\nthings that we regularly perceive, but rarely articulate” (1998b:\n§6), a visible property, but one which is relative to a point of\nview (unlike colour, for example). In fact it appears to be the same\nproperty as Hyman’s occlusion shape, i.e., the 2-D\ncross-section of the cone of light an object subtends to a point of\nview (see above\n §1).\n Unlike Peacocke’s concept of the shape of a region in a\nspectator’s visual field, it is not defined subjectively, in\nterms of the experience of a spectator, but objectively, purely in\nterms of projective geometry. And since seeing-in can be defined in\nterms of outline shape, so can depiction: \nSeeing-in […] is essentially the experience of likeness in\nrespect of outline shape. Depiction may then be understood as that\nrepresentation which works through the deliberate generation of this\nexperience. (Hopkins 1998b: §6) \nHopkins’ definition of seeing-in addresses several influential\nobjections to Wollheim’s own approach. In particular, it avoids\nthe implication that the figure-ground relationship is a universal\nfeature of depiction; it explains precisely how the experience of\nseeing a certain kind of object in a surface is related to the\nexperience of seeing the same kind of object face to face, and how the\nexperience of seeing one kind of object in a surface differs from the\nexperience of seeing another kind of object in a surface; and it\nexplains the fact that objects are necessarily depicted from an\nimplicit point of view. But Hopkins does not claim that there is\ninvariably an exact match between the content of a picture and what\ncan be seen in it (Hopkins 1998a: 128; see also Brown 2010; Dilworth\n2005, 2010). Drawing on his or her knowledge of pictorial culture and\nconvention, an educated spectator will discount some features of the\nobject seen in a picture—such as deviations from normal human\nanatomy—attributing them to the prevalent pictorial style,\nrather than including them in the picture’s intended content. In\nthis way, Hopkins draws a distinction between the content of\nseeing-in, which is determined by experienced resemblance in\noutline shape alone, and pictorial content, which also\ndepends on the artist’s intentions (Hopkins 1998a). \nHowever, several difficulties remain. First, it is unclear how\nHopkins’s theory can accommodate Lopes’s independence\nconstraint. As we have seen (see above,\n §1.2),\n according to Lopes, if a theory implies that a spectator perceives a\npicture’s content by perceiving a resemblance between the marks\non its surface and the kind of object which it represents, then she\nmust be able to perceive this resemblance “without first\nknowing” what the picture represents. But a spectator’s\n“experience of likeness in respect of outline shape” may\ndepend on what she sees in a picture, Lopes claims, and\n“experienced resemblance cannot explain depiction if it is\nbeholden to [i.e., explained by] depiction” (2005a:\n16–17). Second, Hopkins agrees with Wollheim that the standard\nof correctness for a spectator’s perception of the content of a\npicture, “is set … for each painting by the intentions of\nthe artist in so far as they are fulfilled”, and therefore faces\nthe same Gricean objection (see above,\n §3.1).\n Finally, every experiential theory of depiction faces a difficulty in\nexplaining how the shapes (or outline shapes) of the marks on the\nsurface of a picture constrain the shapes (or outline shapes) of the\nobjects they represent. On the one hand, if the only constraint is\nthat they must be such as to generate an experience of the kind the\ntheory postulates, then it is difficult to explain how this experience\ndiffers from a hallucination caused by an optical stimulus, such as\nthe mysterious blank canvas described by Flint Schier, which causes\nthe illusory experience of seeing a portrait of Marilyn Monroe, but\npresumably does not depict anything at all (Schier 1986:\n197). On the other hand, if there must be a direct optical or\ngeometrical correspondence between the shapes (or outline shapes) of\nthe marks and the shapes (or outline shapes) of the objects they\nrepresent, so that we can perceive the latter by perceiving\nthe former, then the theory is no longer purely experiential, and\ndepends ultimately on the kind of relationship between surface and\ncontent postulated (for different reasons) by Hyman, Kulvicki, and\nVoltolini. (See Hyman 2006, Kulvicki 2014, Voltolini 2015. For\nHopkins’ replies to these objections, see Hopkins 2003 and\n2005.) \nMake-believe: An alternative characterisation of the\nexperience generated by pictures, which refers to the imagination, is\nproposed by Kendall Walton (1990, 2008a,b, 2011) in the context of a\nwider theory of artistic representation. Following Gombrich (1963),\nand drawing on Ryle’s seminal writings on imagination and\npretence (Ryle 1949: ch. 8; cf. White 1990), Walton claims that\npictures are props in visual games of make-believe, which prescribe\nvisual imaginings with a particular content. When one engages in the\nright way with a picture of a certain kind of object or scene, one\nimagines that one is seeing an object or scene of that kind: \nParticipation in visual games of make-believe using pictures as props\nis a complex perceptual and imaginative activity. […] At a\nminimum, one imagines seeing the depicted objects or objects of the\nkinds that are depicted, as one scans the picture surface. One also\nimagines one’s actual visual experience of the picture to be a\nvisual experience of these objects or objects of these kinds.\n[…] I claim that this complex experience constitutes,\napproximately, what Wollheim and others call seeing trees, fields,\netc. in the picture. (Walton 2011: 396–397) \nWalton’s general theory of make-believe is widely regarded as an\nimportant contribution to the philosophy of art. But his theory of\ndepiction faces the same difficulty as other experiential theories in\nexplaining how the shapes (or outline shapes) of the marks on the\nsurface of a picture constrain the shapes (or outline shapes) of the\nobjects they represent, or the imaginative games they invite\nspectators to engage in. Furthermore, some of Walton’s critics\nhave denied that visual imagination is an essential feature of picture\nperception (Savile 1986); and others have denied that the concept of a\nvisual game of make-believe can capture the experience of seeing in,\non the grounds that Walton fails to integrate the\n“recognitional” and “configurational” aspects\nof the experience, or at least fails to integrate them in the right\nway. However, the force of this objection is blunted to some degree by\nthe disagreement among Wollheim’s followers about the right way\nof explaining how the experience of seeing in is integrated. (For\nobjections to Walton, see Wollheim 1998, 2003b; Budd 2008a; Nanay\n2004. For Walton’s replies to objections, see Walton 2008b,c.\nFor an alternative analysis of seeing in in terms of imagining, see\nStock 2008. For different views about the “integration” of\nseeing in, see Abell & Bantinaki 2010; Newall 2015; Voltolini\n2015.) \nInflection: As noted above, the alleged\n“integration” of seeing in has been a matter of debate.\nThis is especially true with respect to cases where the marks on the\nsurface of a picture are not merely a means by which the spectator\nperceives its content, but are designed by the artist to contribute to\nthe content of the picture in virtue of their character as marks. For\nexample, in several pastel drawings made in the 1880s, in which\n Degas depicts a woman drying herself,\n he trace of the pastel rubbing against the paper’s surface\nsubliminally registers the motion of the towel against the\nwoman’s skin. In this kind of case, as Michael Podro\nexplains, \nthe recognition of the subject is extended and elaborated by the way\nits conditions of representation, the medium and the psychological\nadjustments the painting invites become absorbed into its content.\n(Podro 1998: 2) \nThe spectator’s experience of this phenomenon has been called\n“inflected seeing in”, and both the phenomenon and the experience have\nreceived considerable attention, both from philosophers who maintain\nthat depiction can be defined in experiential terms, and from those\nwho doubt or deny this. Lopes (2005a) makes the interesting claim that\ninflection solves the puzzle of mimesis: in other words, it\nexplains why we value or enjoy seeing pictures of kinds of objects\nthat we do not value or enjoy seeing face-to-face (The seminal\ntreatment of this problem is in Aristotle’s Poetics (Book\nIV). Noteworthy discussions of inflection include Hopkins 2010, Nanay\n2010, and Voltolini 2013. Broader discussions of the kinds of\npictorial experience that pictures in different styles can elicit\ninclude Lopes 2005a, Cavedon-Taylor 2011, Newall 2011, and Bradley\n2014.) \nWe noted in\n §3.1\n that experiential theories seek to explain depiction in terms of the\nkind of experience a picture causes in a spectator, rather than the\nsubpersonal cognitive mechanisms a picture is thought to engage. Some\nphilosophers therefore maintain that theories which explain depiction\nin terms of the propensity of a picture to activate a\nspectator’s recognitional skills are not experiential theories,\non the grounds that recognition can occur without experience (Matthen\n2005: 25–26; Newall 2011: 21–23). Others either claim or\nassume, on the contrary, that recognition is a kind of\nexperience, at least the kind of recognition that is stimulated by a\npicture (Squires 1969; Schier 1986). \nThe basic thought that underlies recognition-based theories of\ndepiction is that a picture must be recognisable: \nIt must be the kind of thing that can be connected up with what the\nartist had in mind, if looked at in the right way by people with\naptitude and experience. […] Ultimately, we establish what is\nrecognisable by reference to what is recognised. (Squires 1969:\n203) \nThe same thought is developed by Schier. As noted above (see\n §2),\n Schier claims that our interpretation of pictures, unlike our\ninterpretation of words, is generated naturally: \nOnce you have succeeded in an initial pictorial interpretation\n[…] you should then be able to interpret novel icons without\nbeing privy to additional stipulations given only that you can\nrecognise the object or state of affairs depicted. (Schier 1986:\n43) \nAccordingly, Schier argues that depiction can be defined in terms of\nnatural generativity and recognition: a picture is the kind of\nrepresentation that causes naturally generated interpretations in\ncompetent spectators by activating their recognitional skills. Thus,\n“pictures are symbols whose interpretation can be causally\nexplained by relevant recognitional abilities” (Schier 1986:\n49). Specifically, “a picture of O is precisely something\nwhich can trigger the interpreter’s O-recognising\nabilities” (Schier 1986: 195). \nSchier’s basic thought was subsequently incorporated into an\neclectic theory of depiction by Dominic Lopes (1996). Drawing on\nGareth Evans’s information-theoretic account of reference (Evans\n1982; see §2.3 of the entry on\n reference)\n and Kendall Walton’s controversial claim that photographs are\n“transparent” (Walton 1984), as well as Schier’s\nrecognition-based theory of depiction, Lopes defends the following\nideas. \nFirst, pictures belong to “information systems”, and\ntransmit perceptual information from their subjects (Lopes 1996: 107),\nthereby engaging (and also extending) the recognitional skills\nspectators exercise in ordinary visual perception. “The ability\nto work out what pictures depict covaries with the ability to\nrecognize their depicta in the flesh” (2005a: 170). Second,\nLopes adopts Walton’s claim that photographs are\n“transparent”, i.e., spectators literally see the\nobjects that appear in photographs, as if through a pane of glass, and\nnot merely visual records or sources of information about them.\nHowever, Lopes extends this claim to encompass every kind of picture:\n“there is as much reason to believe that we see through\npaintings and drawings as through photographs” (1996: 181).\nThird, pictures present aspects of their subjects, by making both\n“commitments” and “non-commitments” regarding\ntheir properties: “Every picture represents its subject as\nhaving some property that precludes it from making commitments about\nsome other property” (Lopes 1996: 125). For example, a picture\nthat depicts a man sporting a beard makes a commitment regarding the\nproperty of being hirsute, but by the same token is non-commital\nregarding the property of having a dimpled chin. Explicit\n“non-commitment” distinguishes depiction from other kinds\nof representation. (For criticism see Herwitz 2000, Savile 2000,\nKulvicki 2006.) Fourth, pictorial styles, or systems of pictorial\nrepresentation, differ from each other in the kinds of aspects they\ntypically present. Pictorial competence is relative to specific styles\nor systems: to be able to interpret a picture, one needs to have the\nrecognitional skills corresponding to the system to which it belongs\n(Lopes 1996: 152–3). \nThese ideas face various difficulties, some of which we have already\nconsidered in connection with other experiential theories. First,\nLopes’s ideas about the transmission of perceptual information\nand the transparency of pictures are difficult to apply to pictures of\nfictional individuals and genre pictures (Hopkins 1997). Second, the\ntransparency claim has been criticised even in the case of\nphotographs, where the problem of fictional subjects and genre\npictures does not normally arise (Currie 1995). Third, the claim that\npictures differ from other kinds of representations in that only\npictures explicitly “non-commit” to properties has been\nchallenged (Kulvicki 2006). Finally, as we have seen, Walton’s\ntheory that picture are props in games of visual make-believe does not\nseem capable of explaining how the shapes of the marks on the surface\nof a picture constrain the shapes of the objects they represent, or\nthe imaginative games they invite spectators to engage in.\nRecognition-based theories are open to a similar objection. Various\ntheories of depiction are compatible with the claim that pictures\nactivate the same recognitional skills as the kinds of objects they\ndepict. The question on which they differ is why they do so. For\nexample, is it because the shape of a region on a picture’s\nsurface is identical to the occlusion shape of the object it depicts?\nOr is it because part of a picture’s surface occupies a region\nof the spectator’s two-dimensional visual field that she\nexperiences as similar in shape to a region in which the kind of\nobject that it depicts could be presented? Or is it for some other\nreason? Without an answer to this question, the problem of explaining\nhow pictures represent is elaborated by introducing ideas about\nrecognition, natural generativity and transparency, but it is not\nsolved (Newman 1998; cf. Neander 1987, Sartwell 1991). \nAs we have seen, any plausible theory of depiction will need to\naccommodate the wide variety of styles of picture-making. Art history\ncontains more sophisticated and fertile treatments of the concept of\nstyle than philosophy does, notably by Heinrich Wolfflin (1950), Alois\nRiegl ([1893] 1992), Erwin Panofsky (1997), Ernst Gombrich (1968), and\nMeyer Schapiro (1994). However, one topic in the theory of style on\nwhich there is a substantial philosophical literature is\nrealism. \nThe term “realism” and equivalent terms in other European\nlanguages were introduced into literary and art criticism during the\nnineteenth century, and paintings and sculptures are still commonly\ndescribed as realistic (faithful, true to nature, etc.) by critics and\nhistorians of art. However, many philosophers and historians of art\nsince the 1920s have expressed scepticism about the idea that some\nstyles of art represent reality more truthfully or faithfully than\nothers (Jakobson [1921/1971] 1987; Steinberg [1953] 1972; Nochlin\n1971; Stewart 1997). The most influential exponent of this view is\nGoodman, who argues that realism cannot be a matter of fidelity to\nnature, and cannot be measured by resemblance to reality, because our\njudgements about fidelity to nature depend on our visual habits, which\nare shaped in turn by the visual culture we inhabit, and the images we\nare used to seeing and interpreting. Resemblance cannot be a\n“constant and independent” standard against which works of\nart can be measured, because “the criteria of resemblance vary\nwith changes in representational practice” (Goodman 1968: 39).\n“The literal or realistic or naturalistic system of\nrepresentation”, Goodman claims, “is simply the customary\none”. \nRealism is relative, determined by the system of representation\nstandard for a given culture or person at a given time. Newer or older\nor alien systems are accounted artificial or unskilled. (1968: 37) \nGoodman’s argument has been challenged on several grounds.\nFirst, the realistic system of representation cannot simply be the\nstandard or customary one, because as an artistic style evolves,\nspectators are inevitably less accustomed to innovative subjects and\ntechniques than they are to the ones these modify or replace. So if\nGoodman’s claim were true, an artistic style could never become\nmore realistic, in the eyes of spectators living at the time. But the\nhistorical record proves, on the contrary, that it does (Newall 2011:\n119–121). Second, Goodman exaggerates the extent to which visual\nexperience is modified by art. Oscar Wilde famously claimed that there\nhad been no fog in London before it appeared in Turner’s\npaintings. But in fact, writers generally described optical effects\nlong before painters learned to represent them. For example, the\nspinning highlights on a chariot-wheel were described by the Latin\npoet Prudentius many centuries before Velazquez captured this effect\nin paint. Third, even if the art we see does modify our visual habits\nand influence the resemblances we perceive to some extent, it does not\nfollow that realism cannot consist in resemblance or fidelity to\nnature. Compare the relationship between theory and observation in\nscience. The growth of scientific knowledge has enabled us to refine\nour observations of natural phenomena, and these observations have in\nturn enabled us to test scientific theories. There is nothing\nsuspicious about this interaction between theory and observation, and\nnothing that should make us wonder whether we possess a\n“constant and independent” standard, with which scientific\ntheories can be assessed (see §4; of the entry on\n theory and observation in science\n and  §3 of the entry on \n Popper). \nIt is now generally agreed that the concepts of resemblance and\nfidelity to nature are too vague and metaphorical to explain what\nrealism is, and that “realist” or “realistic”\nart proceeds from specific values, methods and viewpoints, no less\nthan other kinds of art (Schapiro 1978). Furthermore, confusion about\nrealism is compounded by the fact that the term is used to describe a\nvariety of period styles, including late medieval and early\nRenaissance art, Dutch painting in the seventeenth century, and French\npainting in the nineteenth century. But it does not follow that\n“realism” is merely an honorific term, which we apply to\nart in a familiar style, or that fidelity to nature is a vacuous\nidea. \nThe fundamental distinction we need to draw, in order to clarify the\nconcept of realism, is between realism in subject-matter and realism\nin technique (Hyman 2005). Realism in subject-matter is about the\nchoice of subject-matter and the manner in which it is treated.\nRealistic art, in this sense, represents the lower social classes,\ncomic as opposed to tragic material, daily life as opposed to myth.\nFor example, in the paintings of Courbet, Manet and Degas the\ntraditional hierarchy of genres, which promoted the representation of\nhistory, myth or allegory, is definitively set aside, and the everyday\nlives of people belonging to the lower social classes are taken\nseriously, and placed in a contemporary social setting, as they are in\nthe novels of Balzac and Flaubert. \nRealism in technique is a different phenomenon, which can be traced\nback to the revolutionary developments in Greek art between the sixth\nand fourth centuries BC, specifically, developments in anatomy and in\nthe representation of space and light. Since philosophers and art\ntheorists abandoned the idea that realism can be defined in terms of\nfidelity to nature or resemblance, most of those who do not regard\nrealism as a purely ideological concept or a sham (e.g., Stewart 1997;\nNeer 2002) have defined realism in technique in terms of information:\neither the quantity of information recorded in a picture (Gombrich\n1960; Schier 1986), or the quantity of relevant or visually salient\ninformation (Lopes 1996; Sartwell 1994; Abell 2006, 2007; Kulvicki\n2006), or the ease with which information issues (Goodman 1968), or\nthe range of information (Hyman 2005), is said to be the, or the\nprincipal, measure of realistic art. (See also Walton 1990; Chasid\n2007; and Newall 2011 for comparable views.) \nAccording to Hyman, realism in technique can be defined in terms of\nthree characteristics: accuracy, animation, and\nmodality (Hyman 2005: 40–46). Accuracy means the\naccurate depiction of a kind of material or object or activity, such\nas water or satin, a palm tree or a dove, sleeping, galloping or\nmaking love. Animation combines mobility with the expression of\nemotion, character or thought (see also Penrose 1973: 268). The term\n“modality” refers to the expressive potential available to\nartists during a particular phase in the development of an artistic\ntradition, in other words, the range of kinds of information that the\ntechnical resources available to artists allow them to record: \nThe technical resources of pictorial art are always limited in their\nexpressive range, as languages are also bound to be; and these\ntechnical resources, like languages, can expand in different\ndirections to express new ideas and new observations. The development\nof realistic techniques is the expansion of the modality of art, in\nother words, the expansion of what it is possible for art to\nrepresent. (Hyman 2009: 497) \nThe commonest argument debunking the idea of a realistic artistic\nstyle depends on the thought that artistic styles are analogous to\nlanguages (see above,\n §2\n for references). The comparison is intended to underline the extent\nto which artists rely on systems of conventions, and to discourage the\nidea that some styles are more truthful, or closer to reality, than\nothers. For the things we say are not truer or closer to reality if we\nsay them in French, or English, or Chinese. However, the analogy\nactually supports the claim that expressive potential is the measure\nof realistic art. For languages are not like codes or scripts. For\nexample, the Hieratic and Hieroglyphic Egyptian scripts do not differ\nin the range of information they can be used to record, and neither do\nSemaphore and Morse code. But languages obviously differ widely in\ntheir expressive powers, and have expanded rapidly in some periods of\nhistory. Thus, the difference between trecento and seicento Italian\nart is comparable to the difference between the English of\nChaucer’s Canterbury Tales and the English of\nMilton’s Paradise Lost, not to that between Morse Code\nand Semaphore or between English and French (see Ackerman 1978:\n157–160; Hyman 2005: 47).","contact.mail":"john.hyman@queens.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"queens.ox.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2017-06-08","date.changed":"2021-05-20","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/depiction/","author1":"John Hyman","author2":"Katerina Bantinaki","entry":"depiction","body.text":"\n\n\nDepiction or pictorial representation was studied less intensively by\nphilosophers than linguistic meaning until the 1960s. The traditional\ndoctrine that pictures represent objects by copying their appearance\nhad been challenged by art theorists since the first quarter of the\ntwentieth century, when what were thought of as illusionistic styles\nof painting lost favour, due to the growing prestige of so-called\n“primitive” artistic styles, and the fauvist and cubist\nexperiments of artists at that time. But it took several decades\nbefore philosophers became interested in these debates. When they did\nso, it was largely due to the impact of two books: Ernst\nGombrich’s Art and Illusion (1960), and Nelson\nGoodman’s Languages of Art (1968). Gombrich explored a\nvariety of problems about the nature of depiction, the evolution of\nstyle, and the nature of realism, drawing extensively on theories of\nvisual perception advanced since Helmholtz, and on Karl Popper’s\nfalsificationist theory of science. Goodman, by contrast defended a\npurely conventionalist theory of depiction in general and realistic\ndepiction in particular, which was rooted in the nominalist philosophy\nhe had developed in collaboration with W.V.O. Quine. A large part of\nthe philosophical work on this topic during the past fifty years\nconsists in attempts to develop theories of depiction in general, and\nrealistic depiction in particular, which overcome the objections to\ntheir views, while avoiding the simplifications and alleged cultural\nbias of the traditional ideas they rejected.\n\nResemblance theories of depiction are commonly traced to\nRepublic, book X, where Plato suggests that a painting of an\nobject is a mimesis (imitation or representation) of its\nshape and colour. The idea is intuitively plausible, and it provides\nthe basis for a variety of attempts by philosophers to define or\nanalyse the concept of a picture, or to explain how pictures\nrepresent. It is true that pictures represent things that do not have\nshapes or colours, such as God and Justice, but they do so by\ndepicting things that do have shapes and colours, such as bearded men\nand blindfolded women carrying scales. Accordingly, the basic thought\nthat underlies resemblance theories of depiction is that pictures are\ncomposed of shapes and colours that resemble the shapes and colours of\nthe visible objects they depict. But even if this provides an adequate\nstarting-point, a convincing theory of depiction needs to be\nelaborated with care, as Nelson Goodman (1968) showed. The simplistic\nclaim that A depicts B if and only if A\nappreciably resembles B is demonstrably false. According to\nGoodman “more error could hardly be compressed into so short a\nformula” (1968: 3–4). \nAs a matter of fact, the simplistic formula Goodman attacks was never\nproposed by Charles Sanders Peirce or his followers, such as Suzanne\nLanger (1942) and John Hospers (1947), whose semiotic theories were\nGoodman’s immediate target, or by any other philosopher or\ntheorist of art. Peirce described pictures as iconic signs,\ni.e., signs that signify objects by resembling them, and he contrasted\niconic signs with indices, which signify objects by standing in\nspatial, temporal or causal relations to them, and with\nsymbols, which signify objects by means of conventions\n(Peirce 1982, Vol. 2: 53–56). But this classification depends on\nthe basic idea of signification, which Peirce holds is a three-termed\nrelation between a sign, its object, and an\n“interpretant”, i.e., a thought of the object or a\ntranslation of the sign. Moreover, Peirce acknowledges that these\nthree categories of sign are not mutually exclusive, and that the\nsignification of a picture can also depend on iconographic\nconventions, and on its context of use. \nHence, Peirce’s conception of depiction is not captured by the\nformula Goodman criticizes. But arguably the formula has some\nheuristic value, because it draws attention to some of the challenges\na theory that explains depiction in terms of resemblance will need to\naddress. Thus, according to Goodman, resemblance is a reflexive and\nsymmetric relation, whereas representation is neither: an object\nresembles itself to the maximum degree but does not normally represent\nitself, and the object that a picture represents does not represent\nthe picture, although it resembles the picture to exactly the same\ndegree and in exactly the same respects as the picture resembles it.\nFurthermore, many pictures resemble other pictures, such as copies of\nthem, more closely than they resemble their objects, but they do not\nrepresent those pictures. “Plainly” Goodman concludes\n“resemblance in any degree is no sufficient condition for\nrepresentation”(1968: 4). \nAs we have indicated, Goodman’s initial challenge to resemblance\ntheories of depiction does not show that the approach is wrong. For\naccording to philosophers who favour the approach, the idea of\nresemblance is used to explain what makes a pictorial representation\nspecifically pictorial, rather than what makes it generically\nrepresentational. The depictive relation between a portrait and its\nsubject is indeed neither reflexive nor symmetric. But resemblance\nremains a candidate for explaining what makes a representation\npictorial or figurative, and therefore how a portrait of an individual\ndiffers from a text describing her appearance. For comparison, the\nreferential relation between the indexical “now” and the\ntime it refers to is neither reflexive nor symmetric, but this does\nnot prevent us from explaining how “now” refers to a\nspecific time in terms of simultaneity (between the use of the word\nand the time referred to), which is both. \nHowever, the example of a portrait brings us to another objection to\nresemblance theories of depiction, which Goodman mentions in passing\n(1968: 25), and others have accorded greater weight (Hopkins 1998b;\nAbell 2009). For if resemblance is a relation, and if the relata of a\nrelation must be existing particulars, then it appears that pictures\nthat represent fictional individuals (Zeus, Pegasus), and genre\npictures, which represent kinds of objects without representing any\nparticular instances of them, cannot resemble what they represent.\nHence, even if it is plausible that a resemblance theory can explain\nhow a portrait represents a sitter, it cannot provide a general\nexplanation of depiction. \nOne response to this argument is to claim that fictional characters\nare abstract entities that actually exist (Kripke 2013: 73). Another\nis to claim that a fictional character can be a genuine relatum of a\nrelation without existing: it is sufficient that it is capable of\nbeing identified, referred to, and described, and meeting these\nconditions does not require existence (Rundle 1979: 249; Sainsbury\n2005: ch. 6). But even if one of these responses is correct, and the\nobjection therefore fails to show that the concept of resemblance is\nunsuited to explaining how pictures represent fictional characters,\nthe problem of genre pictures remains. However, John Hyman (2012:\n129–132) has argued that the verb “resemble”\nsometimes expresses a relation and sometimes does not. For instance,\nin the sentence “Darwin resembles Socrates”,\n“resembles” expresses a relation, whereas in the sentence\n“Socrates resembles a satyr”, it is a copular (linking)\nverb. Thus, according to Hyman, “resembles”, “looks\nlike”, “is like”, etc. have the same kind of dual\nuse as “is”, which can either express identity or have a\ncopular function (Russell 1914: 48). If this is right, the objection\nalso fails to show that the concept of resemblance is unsuited to\nexplaining generic depiction (cf. Blumson 2014). \nGoodman places more weight on a third objection to resemblance\ntheories of depiction. A theory of this kind, he maintains, would need\nto specify the visible aspect or aspects of its object that a picture\nimitates or copies. But every object can be seen in many ways,\ndepending on the experience, interests, and attitudes of the viewer:\n“the object before me is a man, a swarm of atoms, a complex of\ncells, a fiddler, a friend, a fool and much more” (1968: 8).\nSince the artist cannot copy all of these aspects at once, all of the\nways the object is or looks, one might assume that her aim is to strip\naway the varnish of perceptual habit, prejudice or interpretation, and\ncapture the object as seen “under aseptic conditions by the free\nand innocent eye”. But, Goodman claims, following Ernst Gombrich\n(1960), “there is no innocent eye”: the idea that we can\naccess some raw visual data by means of “purification rites or\nby methodical disinterpretation” is a myth. Both “the way\nwe see and the way we depict depends upon and varies with experience,\npractice, interests, and attitudes” (Goodman 1968: 10). \nAccording to Goodman and Gombrich, resemblance theories of depiction\ndepend on the mistaken assumption that visual perceptions result from\na process of interpreting two-dimensional patterns of raw colour,\nwithout any intrinsic meaning, which artists are trained to observe\nand record. Psychologists such as Hermann von Helmholtz, artists such\nas Claude Monet, and art theorists such as John Ruskin embraced a\ntheory of painting of this kind. For instance, the passage by Ruskin\nfrom which Gombrich took the phrase “innocent eye” reads\nas follows: \nThe whole technical power of painting depends on our recovery of what\nmay be called the innocence of the eye; that is to say, of a\nsort of childish perception of these flat stains of colour, merely, as\nsuch, without consciousness of what they signify. (Gombrich 1960: 296;\nquoting Ruskin 1857: 6, note 1) \nGoodman and Gombrich associate this conception of painting with\nresemblance theories of depiction. But it is not an essential part of\nsuch a theory. If the depiction of an object depends on the imitation\nof its form and colour, it follows that an artist must be able to\nperceive these properties and reproduce them, but it does not follow\nthat we need to conceive of painting in the way Ruskin recommends. \nThe principal objections to resemblance theories of depiction may be\nunconvincing, but the challenge for such a theory is to specify the\nrespect or respects in which pictures resemble their objects, and this\nis not a simple task. Merely referring to ‘form and\ncolour’ is unsatisfactory. For as Descartes pointed out, it is\nunclear how the 2-D shape of a mark on the surface of a painting or\ndrawing can resemble the 3-D shape of an object it depicts; and the\nuse of foreshortening shows that rhombuses can represent squares\nbetter than squares, ovals can represent circles better than circles,\nand so on ([1637] 1985: I 165). Furthermore, some pictures (for\ninstance, cubist paintings) do not bear much obvious resemblance to\nthe objects they depict in either form or colour. Hence, the basic\nidea that depiction depends on resemblances in form and colour will\nneed to be specified in such a way as to meet what Dominic Lopes calls\nthe diversity constraint (Lopes 1996: 32), in other words, it\nwill need to accommodate the wide variety of styles of picture-making.\nDifferent resemblance theorists have responded to these challenges in\ndifferent ways. \nJohn Hyman and Catherine Abell have proposed different theories of\ndepiction in which the idea of resemblance plays a significant role.\nHyman rejects the theory that pictures are iconic signs (2012: 127),\nbut he claims that there is a strict and invariable relationship\nbetween the shapes and colours on a picture’s surface and the\nshapes and colours of the objects it represents. Hyman’s theory\ndepends on Gottlob Frege’s distinction between sense and\nreference (see §3.2 of the  entry on\n Frege).\n Taking one of Frege’s own examples, the phrases “the\nmorning star” and “the evening star” have the same\nreference, but different senses, or modes of presentation. Both\nphrases refer to one and the same object, the planet Venus, but they\ndescribe or present it as a star that is visible at different times of\nday. Similarly, two portraits of the same individual may present him\nas dark-haired and seated, wearing a black smock\n (Kramskoy’s 1873 portrait of Tolstoy),\n or as grey-haired and standing, wearing a white smock\n (Repin’s 1901 portrait).\n They portray (refer to) the same individual, but they present him\ndifferently (they differ in sense). The distinction matters, Hyman\nargues, because resemblances do not explain a picture’s\nreference, they explain its sense. (The claim that A depicts\nB if and only if A appreciably resembles B, which\nGoodman criticizes, is about depiction qua portrayal, i.e.,\npictorial reference, not sense.) \nAccording to Hyman, the sense or mode of presentation of a picture,\nexpressed in the most general terms, is an aspect or view of an object\nor arrangement of objects, relative to an implicit point (or a variety\nof points) of view. (An “object” in this sense is not\nnecessarily a “material object”, it might be a shadow, a\nrainbow, or part of the sky.) Different parts of a picture can present\ndifferent aspects of an object or its parts, corresponding to\ndifferent points of view, but nothing can be depicted independently of\na point of view. Otherwise, Hyman points out, \n[we could] discover different aspects of an object represented in a\npicture by moving around it and studying it from different angles, as\nwe can in the case of a free-standing sculpture. (2012: 142) \nHyman’s principal claim is that the sense or mode of\npresentation of a picture is defined by the colours and shapes of the\nmarks on its surface in accordance with definite optical principles\nconcerning colour and shape (2006: ch. 5; see also Hopkins 1998a: 27).\nWe shall concentrate on shape. \nHyman’s shape-principle employs the concept of an object’s\nocclusion shape, i.e., the 2-D cross-section of the cone of\nlight it subtends to a viewer’s eye. (The concept is similar to\nHopkins’s outline shape; see below,\n §3.2.)\n For example, the occlusion shape of a circular coin viewed obliquely\nis an ellipse. This shape, Hyman argues, is a visible property of the\ncoin. It is especially salient when an object is backlit, and appears\nin silhouette. It is relative to a point of view, and changes as the\npoint of view changes. But Hyman insists that relative does not mean\nsubjective. An object’s occlusion shape “is not merely a\nfeature of the viewer’s experience. It belongs to optics, not\npsychology” (2012: 143; cf. Peacocke 1987). Hyman’s\nshape-principle is that the shape of a region on a picture’s\nsurface (or, in the case of anamorphic pictures, its occlusion shape\nrelative to the intended point of view of a spectator) is identical to\nthe occlusion shape of the object it represents, relative to the\nimplicit point of view. In other words, there is an exact resemblance\nbetween these shapes (2006: 81). \nAccording to Hyman, this principle captures an exact relationship\nbetween the marks on a picture’s surface and the picture’s\nsense, which does not depend on the artist’s intention, or on\nthe picture’s psychological effect on a spectator, and which\napplies to pictures regardless of their style or the artistic\ntradition to which they belong. Together with a principle concerning\ncolour, it is supposed to explain how the colours and shapes on the\nsurface of a picture fix the colours and shapes of the objects it\ndepicts. But Hyman’s optical principles do not imply that a\nportrait of Tolstoy resembles Tolstoy, since they are only concerned\nwith a picture’s sense, as opposed to its reference. Nor do they\nimply that a painting of a bearded man resembles a bearded man, since\nthey are only concerned with the shapes and colours of the objects in\na picture. Hyman therefore claims that his theory dovetails neatly\nwith the idea that a picture’s reference is normally determined\nby the artist’s intention, and with the idea that the depiction\nof objects of specific kinds, such as men and horses, depends on a\npicture’s propensity to trigger a spectator’s ability to\nrecognize these kinds of objects by their shapes and colours, and the\nshapes and colours of their parts (see below,\n §3.2).\n He explains how these two elements of a theory of depiction can be\ncombined with the example of a silhouette: \nthe black shapes the silhouettist has cut out fix the occlusion shapes\nof the objects represented and their parts, relative to an implicit\nline of sight. And the spectator’s ability to recognize, say, a\ngirl or a cat, enables him to see a girl or a cat depicted in a\nsilhouette by seeing its occlusion shape and the occlusion shapes of\nits parts. (2012: 113) \nHyman’s theory has been criticised on various grounds. First,\nand most generally, Michael Podro argues that it expresses a bias in\nfavour of realistic or literal representation (Podro 2010: 457).\nHowever, Hyman replies that the optical principles he defines\n“do not dictate or limit the forms artists create, the models\nthey follow, or the values they embody in their work”, any more\nthan English grammar limits the imagination of English poets (Hyman\n2012: 145). Second, it has been alleged that Hyman’s theory\ncannot explain “the depiction of nonexistent objects”\n(Abell 2009: 195). However, this objection depends on the questionable\nassumption that resemblance is invariably a relation between existing\nparticulars (see above\n §1.1).\n Third, it has been argued that indeterminacies in the occlusion\nshapes of objects represented in a picture may not match the\nindeterminacies in the shapes of the parts of the picture that depict\nthem (Kulvicki 2014: 61–62). Finally, it has been argued more\ngenerally that the exact correspondences in shape and colour between\nthe surface of a picture and its content, which Hyman’s theory\npredicts, sometimes break down; and that the correspondences which do\nexist depend on contingent features of the human visual system (Newall\n2006; Hyman 2007; Newall 2011). \nThe last objection reflects the most widely accepted reason for\nrejecting resemblance theories such as Hyman’s, in which the\nbasic mechanism of depiction is defined without reference either to\nthe visual experience of a spectator, or to the changing cultural\ncontext in which pictures are made. Catharine Abell has defended a\nresemblance theory of depiction which differs from Hyman’s in\nboth of these respects, and is designed to avoid the objections\nmentioned above. It is also a more ambitious theory, both because\nAbell does not distinguish between the sense and reference of a\npicture, but aims to explain both at once, and because she explains\nthe depiction of specific kinds of objects, such as men and horses, in\nterms of resemblance, instead of confining the scope of the theory to\nthe shapes and colours of the objects in a picture. Unlike Hyman,\nAbell does not specify which particular respects of resemblance are\nnecessary for depiction, beyond the requirement that they should be\nvisible (2009: 199), arguing instead that “different respects of\nresemblance govern different instances of depiction” (2009:\n196), including resemblance in respect of optical properties, such as\nocclusion shape, and response-dependent properties, such as when\npainters mimic the effect of simultaneous contrast. \nDrawing on Paul Grice’s seminal article “Meaning”\n(Grice 1957), Abell argues that the respects of resemblance governing\na particular picture depend on the artist’s communicative\nintentions: \nA picture’s resemblance to some object O in a given\nrespect(s) is relevant to determining what the picture depicts if its\nmaker intended the picture to resemble O in the relevant\nrespect(s) and thus to bring O to viewers’ minds; and\nintended that these resemblances have this effect in part because\nviewers recognize that intention. (2009: 201; cf. Blumson 2009 and\n2014) \nAccording to Abell, a picture depicts some object O only if it\nresembles O in a range of relevant respects, and if it thereby\ncaptures O’s “overall appearance”, enabling a\nspectator to distinguish it from objects for which it would not\nordinarily be mistaken (2009: 210). As noted above, Abell regards\npictures of objects that do not actually exist as problematic for\nresemblance theories of depiction. Her solution to the problem\ncombines two ideas: first, a picture of an object that does not\nactually exist, but could exist, such as a gold mountain,\nwould resemble the object, if it did exist; second, we can\nmake-believe that a fictional character such as Sherlock Holmes\nexists, and make-believe that a picture resembles him (2009:216). \nAbell argues that because she does not specify which particular\nrespects of resemblance are necessary for depiction, her theory is\nconsistent with the diversity constraint, in other words, it\naccommodates the wide variety of stylistic conventions that have\ndeveloped in different artistic traditions. However, it can be\nobjected that it fails to accommodate another alleged constraint on an\nadequate resemblance theory of depiction identified by Lopes, which he\ncalls the independence constraint. According to Lopes, a\nspectator must be able to perceive the resemblances postulated by a\nresemblance theory of depiction “without first knowing”\nwhat a picture represents (Lopes 2005a: 16–17). In fact, this\nobjection only applies to a theory which implies that a spectator\nperceives a certain kind of object in a picture by perceiving a\nresemblance between the marks on its surface and an object of\nthis kind, and a resemblance theory need not have this implication.\nHowever, Abell accepts that the objection applies to her own theory,\nespecially since she holds that the “respects of\nresemblance” that “govern” a picture depend on the\nartist’s communicative intentions, and that a spectator’s\nknowledge of these intentions is gained, at least in part, from the\npicture itself. However, she addresses the objection by highlighting\nalternative, context-specific sources of information about them (Abell\n2005, 2009; cf. Blumson 2014). \nResemblance theories of depiction differ from one another in\nsignificant ways. But they agree on the following crucial point: the\nfundamental difference between pictorial and linguistic representation\nconsists in the fact that the former depends on resemblances between\nrepresentations and the objects they represent, whereas the latter\ndoes not. It is widely agreed that linguistic representation depends\non conventions that create the vocabulary of a language and the\nsemantically significant structures in which the elements of its\nvocabulary are combined. But the contribution words and structures\nmake to the meaning of a sentence are hardly ever explained by\nresemblance. If there are exceptions, such as onomatopoeia, they\nconfirm the rule. \nArt theorists such as Roman Jakobson challenged this division between\npictorial art and language early in the twentieth century (Jakobson\n[1921/1971] 1987), reacting against what were thought of as\nillusionistic styles of painting. Once it was understood that artistic\nstyles are comparable to languages or codes, it was thought, artists\nwould feel freer to abandon academic conventions, to follow\n“primitive” models, and to participate in the fauvist and\ncubist experiments of Matisse, Picasso, and Braque (Bois 1987).\nConventionalism was well established by the 1950s. For example, the\nfollowing remark appears in an article by the American art historian\nLeo Steinberg entitled “The Eye Is a Part of the Mind”,\nwhich anticipates Gombrich’s and Goodman’s stance on the\n“innocent eye” (see above\n §1.1): \n“Technical capacity in the imitation of nature” simply\ndoes not exist. What does exist is the skill of reproducing handy\ngraphic symbols for natural appearances, of rendering familiar facts\nby set professional conventions. (Steinberg [1953] 1972: 198 \nHowever, the first attempt to defend a conventionalist theory of art\nsystematically and in detail was made in Goodman’s book\nLanguages of Art. \nGoodman accepts that pictures may resemble the objects they depict,\nbut he denies that this explains why they depict them: \nA picture that represents—like a passage that describes—an\nobject refers to and, more particularly, denotes it. Denotation is the\ncore of representation and is independent of resemblance. (1968:\n5) \nGoodman does not define denotation, beyond describing it as a variety\nof reference, but two features of his conception of denotation should\nbe noted. First, it is supposed to be the relation in which a name\nstands to its bearer, or a predicate stands to the members of its\nextension, or a portrait stands to its subject. Hence the\ncontroversial doctrine that predicates and names have the same\nsemantic function is implicit in Goodman’s theory of depiction\n(Geach 1972; Strawson 1976; Hyman 2006: 185–190). Second,\nGoodman’s nominalist theory of properties excludes the\npossibility that a symbol denotes an object because it resembles it\n(Arrell 1987: 42). For he does not merely make the uncontroversial\nobservation that an object is gray if and only if “gray”\napplies to it, he claims that the properties an object has depends\non what predicates apply to it (Goodman 1968: 51, 54–55).\nIn other words, “gray” does not denote an object because\nit has the property of being gray; on the contrary, it has the\nproperty because “gray” denotes it. Equally, the same\npredicates do not denote different individuals because they resemble\neach other, or have properties in common. On the contrary, they\nresemble each other, or have properties in common, because the same\npredicates denote them. Hence, resemblance is explained by, and\ntherefore cannot itself explain, denotation. \nAccording to Goodman, pictorial symbol systems differ from linguistic\nones in being analog and relatively replete, an\nanalog system being one that is syntactically and\nsemantically dense. (For reasons of space we shall not\ndiscuss the relationship between analog and dense;\nsee Lewis 1971 and Haugeland 1981.) A pictorial system is\nsyntactically dense because it provides for a dense set of\npictorial characters, in other words, a set containing infinitely many\npictures “so ordered that between each two there is a\nthird” (Goodman 1968: 136), and it is semantically\ndense because it provides for a dense set of classes of denotata.\n(By contrast, the Arabic numeral system for denoting the natural\nnumbers provides for infinitely many characters—“1”,\n“2”, “3” …, “11”,\n“12”, “13” …, etc.—but there is a\n“gap” between each numeral and its successor, and between\neach of the corresponding natural numbers and its successor:\nthe system is articulate, not dense.) Finally, a\npictorial system is relatively replete because relatively\nmany properties of a picture are relevant to its interpretation: \nAny thickening or thinning of the line, its colour, its contrast with\nthe background, its size, even the qualities of the paper-none of\nthese is ruled out, none can be ignored. (Goodman 1968: 229) \nThus, whereas different instances of the same written letter, word or\nsentence can differ widely in appearance, pictures that differ in\nappearance, in any one of many different ways, and however small the\ndifference is, will also differ in what they represent. \nThus, Goodman’s principal claims are these: \nAll three claims have been contested. \nThe first difficulty with (1) is that a set is dense only relative to\nan ordering. For example, the set of natural numbers can be given a\ndense ordering, but it is not dense in the familiar 1, 2, 3, …\nordering. In the first edition of Languages of Art, Goodman\ndoes not explain what ordering of pictures he has in mind, but in the\nrevised edition he states that \nthe ordering in question is understood to be such that any element\nlying between two others is less discriminable from each of them than\nthey are from each other. (1976: 136) \nThis raises two questions. First, is an ordering of pictures of this\nkind possible? Second, Goodman’s ordering appears to depend on\ndegrees of resemblance, albeit between signs as opposed to between\nsigns and denotata. But is this reintroduction of the concept of\nresemblance compatible with his nominalist theory of properties and\nhis attack on the doctrine of the “innocent eye”? \nThe second difficulty with (1) is that digital photographs would\nnormally be classified as pictures along with analog ones (Bach 1970;\nKulvicki 2006); and some diagrams, which would not normally\nbe classified as pictures, are analog and relatively replete (Peacocke\n1987). Furthermore, outline drawings are less replete than diagrams in\nwhich not only shape but also colour affects what they represent, but\nthe former would normally be classified as pictures, whereas the\nlatter would not (Schier 1986; Kulvicki 2006). Goodman acknowledges\nthat “some old and vague boundaries are transgressed, some\nsignificant new alliances and alienations effected” by the\nclassification of symbol systems he defends (1968: 232), but it is\ndebatable how revisionist his theory can be, without ceasing to be a\ntheory of depiction. For we want to know how pictures,\nincluding digital photographs, represent. It is possible to\nclaim, in reply, that depiction is not the unitary phenomenon we\nnaïvely imagine it to be. But this cannot be established merely\nby showing that Goodman’s theory of symbols precludes a unitary\nexplanation of depiction. \nThe principal ground on which philosophers have contested (2) is that\nit is inconsistent with the so-called natural generativity of\npictures. The argument is originally due to Flint Schier (1986:\n43–55), but it is also advanced by Richard Wollheim: \nif I can recognize a picture of a cat, and I know what a dog looks\nlike, then I can be expected to recognize a picture of a dog. But on\n[Goodman’s] view this ought to be baffling. It should be as\nbaffling as if, knowing that the French word “chat” means\na cat, and knowing what dogs look like, I should, on hearing it, be\nable to understand what the word “chien” means. (1987:\n77) \nHowever, there appear to be conventional symbol systems, such as\nguitar tablature, in which natural generativity occurs. Hence, it is\narguable that Schier and Wollheim mistook a disanalogy between\npictures and words for a disanalogy between pictures and conventional\nsigns in general. \n(3) invites two questions. First, what explains the fact that a\npicture has a particular denotation, e.g., that Goya’s portrait\ndenotes the Duke of Wellington? Second, denotation is a\nrelation—the relation between a name and its bearer, or between\na predicate and the members of its extension. So Goodman’s\ntheory also faces the question raised earlier about resemblance\ntheories of depiction, regarding pictures of fictional individuals\n(Zeus, Pegasus), and genre pictures. If the relata of a relation must\nbe existing particulars, then it appears that pictures of these kinds\ncannot denote what they depict. So how do they depict them? \nRegarding the first question, Wittgenstein claims that “An\nobvious, and correct, answer to the question ‘What makes a\nportrait the portrait of so-and-so?’ is that it is the\nintention” (1958: 32). But Goodman disagrees. He acknowledges\nthat intentions are “usually involved” in setting up\nsymbol systems, as they are in building bridges, “but in both\ncases, we can study the results independently of the thoughts of the\nmakers” (1972: 125). He claims that what a painting or drawing\ndenotes pictorially depends solely on the arrangement of colours on\nits surface, and the semantic and syntactic conventions that define\nthe symbol system to which it belongs (1968: 42). But it seems to\nfollow that few portraits, if any, portray a single individual, as\nopposed to every member of a class of similar individuals. For if\npictures are effectively predicate-like symbols in a pictorial system,\nthen unless X is the sole individual satisfying a portrait,\ni.e., unless the portrait is a uniquely identifying pictorial\n“description” of X, X is not the only\nsubject of the portrait, the sole individual it portrays. Furthermore,\nit is hard to see how one can paint an inaccurate portrait of someone,\njust as it is hard to see how one can use an inaccurate description to\nrefer to someone (e.g., “The man drinking a martini is\nmy brother”, when he is actually drinking a daiquiri), if whom\none refers to depends purely on the syntax and semantics of the phrase\n(Kripke 1977). \nRegarding the second question, concerning pictures of fictional\nindividuals and genre pictures, Goodman argues that the verbs\n“depict” and “represent” are “highly\nambiguous” (1968: 22). In the sentence “Goya’s\nportrait represents the Duke of Wellington”,\n“represents” is a two-place predicate, expressing a\nrelation, and the sentence as a whole identifies the denotation of\nGoya’s portrait; whereas in the sentence “Rubens’\npainting represents Pegasus”, “represents” is part\nof a one-place predicate, and the sentence as a whole classifies or\ncharacterizes Rubens’ painting without implying that it denotes\nanything at all. Thus, pictures with null denotation are comparable to\npredicates or descriptions with null denotation, such as “flying\nhorse” or “largest prime number”. We can distinguish\nbetween a picture of a centaur and a picture of a unicorn, even though\nthey denote exactly the same objects (i.e., none), because they are\ninstances of different characters in a symbol system that we\nunderstand. The symbol system consists of rules “correlating\nsymbols with denotata” (1968: 228), but it provides for pictures\nwith null denotation. \nFinally, according to Goodman, a pictorial symbol system consists of\nrules correlating symbols with denotata, but he does not propose a\nsingle example of such a rule. He refers to “the traditional\nWestern system of representation” (1968: 226), but he does not\nbegin to formulate its rules. It is uncontroversial that various kinds\nof customs, rules and conventions are involved in making pictures,\nincluding technical procedures, iconographic conventions, rules of\ncomposition, and so on. But none of these have the function of\ncorrelating symbols with denotata, and it is doubtful whether\npictorial rules of this specific kind exist (Hyman 2006:\n174–175). \nDespite these objections to Goodman’s theory of depiction, it\ncontinues to exert an influence on philosophers of art. For example,\nJohn Kulvicki has recently defended a theory that is designed to\naddress some of the arguments above, and to incorporate some of the\nideas advanced by Goodman’s opponents, while retaining\nGoodman’s principal ideas. In particular, Kulvicki agrees with\nGoodman that a picture is a symbol in a denotative system, and that a\ndenotative system is pictorial in virtue of its structure, rather than\nany resemblance between its symbols and the objects they denote\n(Kulvicki 2006: 13). But it is difficult to be certain how far he\nshares Goodman’s approach to the semantics of pictures, and of\nsymbols generally. In particular, Kulvicki relies on the idea that\npictures have different kinds of content (see below), but it\nis unclear whether he agrees with Goodman’s reduction of content\nto denotation (1968: 27–29), and whether he shares\nGoodman’s general commitment to extensionalism (see \n§3.1 of the entry on\n Nelson Goodman),\n or whether he agrees with Frege that as well as having a reference or\ndenotation, names and descriptions also express a sense. \nAccording to Kulvicki, the semantic features of a picture are the\n“features the picture depicts its scene as having”, while\nits syntactic features are the colour and shape properties that are\n“relevant to the semantics of the picture” (2014:\n92–93). Not all of a picture’s colour and shape properties\nqualify as syntactic features. For example, the brownish colour of a\nsepia photograph is merely an “incidental” feature.\nKulvicki argues that a pictorial symbol system has four\ncharacteristics: (a) repleteness, i.e., a relatively wide\nrange of properties of a picture qualify as syntactic features, e.g.,\ncolour, thickness of lines, etc.; (b) sensitivity, i.e.,\nsmall changes to a picture in respect of any of these properties are\nsyntactically significant (cf. Bach 1970: 128–132); (c)\nrichness, i.e., “there are at least as many possible\ndenotations in the system as there are syntactic types”\n(Kulvicki 2006: 38); (d) transparency, i.e., if part of a\npicture X depicts a picture Y, then that part of\nX has the syntactic features that Y is depicted as\nhaving. \nRepleteness, sensitivity and richness are\nexplained, and compared with Goodman’s relative repleteness,\nsyntactic density and semantic density, in Kulvicki 2006\n(29–46). But Kulvicki explores transparency in most detail,\ndeducing in particular the following consequence: that a picture\nresembles the scene it represents in respect of a limited\nrange of colour and shape properties, such as “the abstract\npattern of light and dark” recorded by a black-and-white\nphotograph (2014: 101). Kulvicki calls this range of properties the\npicture’s “bare bones content”, following Haugeland\n1991. He does not attempt to define the colour- and shape-properties\nit consists in, but like Hyman, he suggests that the resemblance he\npostulates between a picture and the scene it represents partially\nexplains how the normal experience of perceiving what a picture\nrepresents occurs. A picture’s “fleshed out content”\n(i.e., the content identified in a normal description of a picture: a\nhorse, a man, etc.) depends on its propensity to trigger a\nspectator’s ability to recognize kinds of objects by the shape-\nand colour-properties included in its bare bones content: \nSeeing a fleshed out content results from deploying concepts as a\nresult of seeing the picture surface—and thus registering its\nbare bones content—that do not apply to the picture surface.\nWhich concepts we deploy depends on what recognitionally keyed\nconcepts we have, which determines the perceptual salience of a given\nfleshed out content. (2006: 173–174) \nThe main questions critics have raised about Kulvicki’s theory\nare as follows. First, it is designed to avoid some of the objections\nto Goodman’s theory, notably the fact that there are digital\npictures as well as analog ones, but other objections remain,\nespecially those concerning Goodman’s doctrine that denotation\nis “the core of representation”. Second, it is unclear\nwhat role Kulvicki accords to the artist’s intention in the\ntheory of depiction. The question is ignored in Kulvicki 2006, as it\nis in Goodman 1968. In Kulvicki 2014, by contrast, he suggests that\npictures “represent in virtue of the intentions of their\nmakers” (2014: 156), but he does not discuss the scope of this\nprinciple (e.g., whether it applies to the sense or reference of a\npicture, or to both) or how precisely the role of intention should be\ndefined. Finally, Kulvicki’s explicit disagreement with Goodman\nfocuses on how the relationships between the symbols in a pictorial\nsystem should be defined. But it is debatable whether the four\nconditions he stipulates are in fact necessary and sufficient for\ndepiction. Some alleged counter-examples are discussed in Blumson\n2011, Newall 2011, and Kulvicki 2012. \nExperiential theories seek to explain depiction in terms of the kind\nof experience a picture causes in a spectator, rather than the kind of\nrepresentational system to which a picture allegedly belongs, or the\nspectator-independent resemblance or isomorphism between a picture and\nthe objects it depicts, or the subpersonal cognitive mechanisms a\npicture may be thought to engage. It remains an open question whether\ntheories of this kind can avoid the charge of circularity, in other\nwords, whether it is possible to define the experience of seeing what\na picture represents without employing the concept of depiction. But\neven among philosophers who believe that this is possible,\nthe exact nature of the experience has been a matter of debate. \nThe simplest experiential theory is that a picture depicts an object\nof a certain kind by causing a spectator to have the visual experience\nshe would normally have if she saw the kind of object it depicts.\nDescartes’ remarks about depiction in his Optics\nsuggest a theory of this kind: \nThe problem is to know simply how [pictures] can enable the soul to\nhave sensory perceptions of all the various qualities of the objects\nto which they correspond—not to know how they can resemble these\nobjects. ([1637] 1985: I, 166) \nMichael Newall has recently defended the theory that “pictures\noccasion non-veridical seeing of their subject-matter” (Newall\n2011: 42), which can be interpreted as an endorsement of\nDescartes’s position. But it is generally thought that Descartes\nassimilates pictures in general to trompes l’oeil,\nwhose purpose is (or is commonly thought to be) to cause spectators to\nexperience a kind of illusion. The experiential theories philosophers\nadvocate today tend to define the experience caused by pictures\ndifferently, for this reason. (Newall distinguishes between his own\ntheory and the theory that pictorial experience is a kind of illusion\nin Newall 2011: 23–30.) \nThe most important twentieth-century source of experiential theories\nis Ernst Gombrich’s book Art and Illusion (1960), based\non the Mellon Lectures he delivered in 1956. In this pathbreaking\nbook, Gombrich argues that realistic or naturalistic pictures\ndo approximate to trompes l’oeil. Indeed, as\nWollheim points out, \nthe two sets of terms, “naturalism”,\n“naturalistic” on the one hand, “illusion”,\n“illusionistic” on the other, are used interchangeably \nin Art and Illusion (Wollheim 1963: 25). However, no general\ntheory of depiction is presented in Art and Illusion,\nalthough Gombrich compares the perception of pictorial content with\nthe phenomenon of aspect-switching or “seeing as”. He\nintroduces “seeing as” with the ambiguous drawing of a\nduck or a rabbit that Wittgenstein’s Philosophical\nInvestigations had made famous (Wittgenstein 1953: 194): \nWe can see the picture as either a rabbit or a duck. It is easy to\ndiscover both readings. It is less easy to describe what happens when\nwe switch from one interpretation to the other. Clearly we do not have\nthe illusion that we are confronted with a “real” duck or\nrabbit. The shape on the paper resembles neither animal very closely.\nAnd yet there is no doubt that the shape transforms itself in some\nsubtle way. (Gombrich 1960: 5) \nThe significance of the ambiguous image is meant to be that it makes\nus aware of a process that the perception of pictorial content\nalways involves: the process of making a “tentative\nprojection, a trial shot which transforms the image if it turns out to\nbe a hit.” “Ambiguity—rabbit or duck?—is\nclearly the key to the whole problem of image reading” (1960:\n198). Gombrich is commonly described as proposing an “illusion\ntheory” of depiction (e.g., Lopes 1996: 37; Newall 2011: 2), but\nhe emphatically disavowed any such intention, pointing out that the\ntitle of the lectures on which Art and Illusion was based was\nThe Visible World and the Language of Art: \n[I] never dreamed that this title [Art and Illusion] would\nconvey to some that I considered illusion, or even deception, the main\naim of art. (Gombrich 1973: 195) \nGombrich explores a variety of fertile ideas in Art and\nIllusion, about the history of style, about realism in the visual\narts, and about the relationship between the content of a\nrepresentation and its use in imaginative play, some of which we shall\nreturn to below. But the comparison between seeing pictures and seeing\naspects provides the focus of Richard Wollheim’s criticism of\nGombrich’s ideas, out of which he develops his own theory of\ndepiction. \nWollheim interprets Gombrich as claiming that a spectator cannot be\nsimultaneously conscious of the marks on a picture’s surface and\nthe scene it represents, and that these can only be objects of\nalternating perceptions, although Gombrich does not say this\nexplicitly (Wollheim 1963; cf. Bantinaki 2007). But according to\nWollheim himself, simultaneous awareness of surface and content is\nprecisely what is distinctive about the experience of seeing a\npicture. Furthermore, these are two distinguishable but\n“inseparable” aspects of a single visual experience, and\nnot two experiences somehow combined (Wollheim 1987, 1998, 2003a,b;\nWollheim does not attempt to define a criterion of identity for\nexperiences, so this claim is difficult to assess). Thus, the\nexperience of seeing a picture has a sui generis\nphenomenology, which Wollheim calls “twofoldness”. The two\naspects of this experience—its configurational aspect\nand its recognitional aspect—are held to be\npsychologically real and to be integrated in a way that also affects\nthe phenomenal character of the experience as a whole. \nWollheim names this twofold visual experience “seeing-in”,\nbut he explains that it is not confined to pictures. For example, it\ncan also occur if we follow Leonardo’s famous advice to discover\nlandscapes, battles and grotesque faces in the stains on an old\nwall. \nSeeing-in is a distinct kind of perception, and it is triggered by the\npresence within the field of vision of a differentiated surface.\n[…] When the surface is right, then an experience with a\ncertain phenomenology will occur, and it is this phenomenology that is\ndistinctive about seeing-in. […] The distinctive\nphenomenological feature I call ‘twofoldness’, because,\nwhen seeing-in occurs, two things happen: I am visually aware of the\nsurface I look at, and I discern something standing out in front of,\nor (in certain cases) receding behind, something else. (Wollheim 1987:\n46) \nAccording to Wollheim, a genealogical parable reveals how\n“representation can be explained in terms of\nseeing-in”: \nIn a community where seeing-in is firmly established, some member of\nthe community—let us call him (prematurely) an artist—sets\nabout marking a surface with the intention of getting others around\nhim to see some definite thing in it: say, a bison. If the\nartist’s intention is successful to the extent that a bison can\nbe seen in the surface as he has marked it, then the community closes\nranks in that someone who does indeed see a bison in it is now held to\nsee the surface correctly, and anyone is held to see it incorrectly if\nhe sees, as he might, something else in it, or nothing at all. Now the\nmarked surface represents a bison. (Wollheim 1987: 46) \nThis is not meant to be piece of speculative history. The purpose of\nthe story is to show that depiction occurs when the marks on a surface\nare successfully designed to make the seeing-in experience occur. It\nis not enough that this experience should occur. It must, when it\noccurs, fulfil the intention of the “artist”. Notice that\nfor Wollheim, neither trompe l’oeils nor purely\nabstract paintings (i.e., abstract paintings that do not solicit the\nperception of figure-ground relations), are depictions, although they\nmay resemble depictions in certain ways and embody some of the same\naesthetic values. Purely abstract paintings do not produce an\nexperience with the “recognitional” aspect of seeing in,\nwhereas trompes l’oeil do not produce an experience\nwith its “configurational” aspect. \nWollheim’s theory has been widely discussed and criticised (see\nespecially van Gerwen 2001; Kemp & Mras 2016; Jagnow 2019).\nThe principal objections to it are the following. First, the\nimplication that trompe l’oeils are not\nrepresentational has been contested (Lopes 1996: 49–50; Levinson\n[1998] 2001; Newall 2009: 25–26; for a critical assessment of\nWollheim’s conception of abstract painting see Caldarola 2012).\nSecond, the suggestion that the figure-ground relationship is a\nuniversal feature of depiction has been challenged (Hyman 2006).\nThird, Wollheim proposes that the standard of correctness, which\ndetermines whether the spectator has correctly perceived the content\nof a picture, “is set … for each painting by the\nintentions of the artist in so far as they are fulfilled”\n(Wollheim 1987: 46). But this appears to oversimplify the relationship\nbetween the representational content of a picture and the content\nintended by the artist. It is well known that the meaning of an\nuttered sentence can diverge from the intended meaning of the speaker,\nand hard to see why the same should not apply to a picture (see \n§4 of the entry on\n Paul Grice;\n cf. Terrone forthcoming). Fourth, Wollheim declines to offer a detailed\ncharacterisation of seeing in, which explains (a) how the experience\nof seeing a certain kind of object in a surface is related to the\nexperience of seeing the same kind of object face to face (he\ndescribes these experiences as “incommensurable” (1987:\n47)); or (b) how the experience of seeing one certain kind of\nobject in a surface differs from the experience of seeing\nanother kind of object in a surface (Budd 2008a; Hopkins\n1998a). Finally, Wollheim’s theory is unable to explain the fact\nthat objects are necessarily depicted from an implicit point of view\n(Hopkins 1998a). Finally—a development rather than an\nobjection—it has been argued that, at least in the case of\npictures that have a reference as well as a sense, the experience of\nseeing a picture has a third aspect, i.e. it is\n“threefold” rather than merely “twofold”, as\nWollheim suggests (see Brough 2012; Nanay 2018; Mion 2019; cf.\nVoltolini 2018). \nDespite these objections, and the elusive character of his writing,\nWollheim’s theory became the key point of reference for\nsubsequent experiential theories of depiction. \nExperienced resemblance: As noted above, experiential\ntheories explain depiction in terms of the kind of experience a\npicture causes in a spectator. The two most influential theories that\nhave sought to define this experience more precisely than Wollheim\ndoes are due to Christopher Peacocke and Robert Hopkins, and the\nprincipal concept both employ is that of experienced\nresemblance. \nConsider the experience of being struck by someone’s resemblance\nto another person one already knows well, e.g., when one sees the\ngrown-up child of an old friend for the first time in several years.\n(We might speak here of seeing the parent ‘in’ the child.)\nNo doubt there is a resemblance—in bone-structure,\npigmentation, etc.—with a genetic explanation. But we can\ndescribe the experience as an experience of a resemblance,\nindependently of whether the resemblance actually exists, in what\nrespects, or why. According to theories that employ the concept of\nexperienced resemblance, this is comparable to (though not exactly\nlike) the experience a spectator has when she sees what a picture\nrepresents. Hence, the assumption (made by or attributed to Wollheim\ninter alia) that the object or scene represented by a picture\nis itself somehow perceived by the spectator, or present in\nher experience, is rejected by those who explain depiction in terms of\nexperienced resemblance. \nAccording to Peacocke (1987: 386–388), a design or configuration\nof marks on a surface depicts a certain kind of object φ if, and\nonly if, it is successfully designed to occupy a region of the\nspectator’s two-dimensional visual field that she experiences as\nsimilar in shape to a region in which a φ could be presented, but\nwithout being experienced (as a sculpture representing a φ might\nbe) as occupying a three-dimensional region of physical space similar\nto one which could be occupied by a φ. The details of\nPeacocke’s account have been criticized (see Hopkins 1998a; Budd\n2008b; Voltolini 2015), but his appeal to experienced resemblance in\nthe explanation of depiction proved influential. \nThe most widely discussed development of Wollheim’s approach is\nby Robert Hopkins. Hopkins adopts Wollheim’s term “seeing-in” to\nrefer to the kind of visual experience a picture is allegedly designed\nto produce. He agrees with Peacocke that seeing-in can be defined in\nterms of experienced resemblance, but he argues that seeing-in is an\nexperience of resemblance in outline shape between the marks\non the surface of a picture and the object or arrangement of objects\nthey represent, rather than shape in the two-dimensional visual field\n(Hopkins 1998a). Outline shape, Hopkins explains, is “a property of\nthings that we regularly perceive, but rarely articulate” (1998b:\n§6), a visible property, but one which is relative to a point of\nview (unlike colour, for example). In fact it appears to be the same\nproperty as Hyman’s occlusion shape, i.e., the 2-D\ncross-section of the cone of light an object subtends to a point of\nview (see above\n §1).\n Unlike Peacocke’s concept of the shape of a region in a\nspectator’s visual field, it is not defined subjectively, in\nterms of the experience of a spectator, but objectively, purely in\nterms of projective geometry. And since seeing-in can be defined in\nterms of outline shape, so can depiction: \nSeeing-in […] is essentially the experience of likeness in\nrespect of outline shape. Depiction may then be understood as that\nrepresentation which works through the deliberate generation of this\nexperience. (Hopkins 1998b: §6) \nHopkins’ definition of seeing-in addresses several influential\nobjections to Wollheim’s own approach. In particular, it avoids\nthe implication that the figure-ground relationship is a universal\nfeature of depiction; it explains precisely how the experience of\nseeing a certain kind of object in a surface is related to the\nexperience of seeing the same kind of object face to face, and how the\nexperience of seeing one kind of object in a surface differs from the\nexperience of seeing another kind of object in a surface; and it\nexplains the fact that objects are necessarily depicted from an\nimplicit point of view. But Hopkins does not claim that there is\ninvariably an exact match between the content of a picture and what\ncan be seen in it (Hopkins 1998a: 128; see also Brown 2010; Dilworth\n2005, 2010). Drawing on his or her knowledge of pictorial culture and\nconvention, an educated spectator will discount some features of the\nobject seen in a picture—such as deviations from normal human\nanatomy—attributing them to the prevalent pictorial style,\nrather than including them in the picture’s intended content. In\nthis way, Hopkins draws a distinction between the content of\nseeing-in, which is determined by experienced resemblance in\noutline shape alone, and pictorial content, which also\ndepends on the artist’s intentions (Hopkins 1998a). \nHowever, several difficulties remain. First, it is unclear how\nHopkins’s theory can accommodate Lopes’s independence\nconstraint. As we have seen (see above,\n §1.2),\n according to Lopes, if a theory implies that a spectator perceives a\npicture’s content by perceiving a resemblance between the marks\non its surface and the kind of object which it represents, then she\nmust be able to perceive this resemblance “without first\nknowing” what the picture represents. But a spectator’s\n“experience of likeness in respect of outline shape” may\ndepend on what she sees in a picture, Lopes claims, and\n“experienced resemblance cannot explain depiction if it is\nbeholden to [i.e., explained by] depiction” (2005a:\n16–17). Second, Hopkins agrees with Wollheim that the standard\nof correctness for a spectator’s perception of the content of a\npicture, “is set … for each painting by the intentions of\nthe artist in so far as they are fulfilled”, and therefore faces\nthe same Gricean objection (see above,\n §3.1).\n Finally, every experiential theory of depiction faces a difficulty in\nexplaining how the shapes (or outline shapes) of the marks on the\nsurface of a picture constrain the shapes (or outline shapes) of the\nobjects they represent. On the one hand, if the only constraint is\nthat they must be such as to generate an experience of the kind the\ntheory postulates, then it is difficult to explain how this experience\ndiffers from a hallucination caused by an optical stimulus, such as\nthe mysterious blank canvas described by Flint Schier, which causes\nthe illusory experience of seeing a portrait of Marilyn Monroe, but\npresumably does not depict anything at all (Schier 1986:\n197). On the other hand, if there must be a direct optical or\ngeometrical correspondence between the shapes (or outline shapes) of\nthe marks and the shapes (or outline shapes) of the objects they\nrepresent, so that we can perceive the latter by perceiving\nthe former, then the theory is no longer purely experiential, and\ndepends ultimately on the kind of relationship between surface and\ncontent postulated (for different reasons) by Hyman, Kulvicki, and\nVoltolini. (See Hyman 2006, Kulvicki 2014, Voltolini 2015. For\nHopkins’ replies to these objections, see Hopkins 2003 and\n2005.) \nMake-believe: An alternative characterisation of the\nexperience generated by pictures, which refers to the imagination, is\nproposed by Kendall Walton (1990, 2008a,b, 2011) in the context of a\nwider theory of artistic representation. Following Gombrich (1963),\nand drawing on Ryle’s seminal writings on imagination and\npretence (Ryle 1949: ch. 8; cf. White 1990), Walton claims that\npictures are props in visual games of make-believe, which prescribe\nvisual imaginings with a particular content. When one engages in the\nright way with a picture of a certain kind of object or scene, one\nimagines that one is seeing an object or scene of that kind: \nParticipation in visual games of make-believe using pictures as props\nis a complex perceptual and imaginative activity. […] At a\nminimum, one imagines seeing the depicted objects or objects of the\nkinds that are depicted, as one scans the picture surface. One also\nimagines one’s actual visual experience of the picture to be a\nvisual experience of these objects or objects of these kinds.\n[…] I claim that this complex experience constitutes,\napproximately, what Wollheim and others call seeing trees, fields,\netc. in the picture. (Walton 2011: 396–397) \nWalton’s general theory of make-believe is widely regarded as an\nimportant contribution to the philosophy of art. But his theory of\ndepiction faces the same difficulty as other experiential theories in\nexplaining how the shapes (or outline shapes) of the marks on the\nsurface of a picture constrain the shapes (or outline shapes) of the\nobjects they represent, or the imaginative games they invite\nspectators to engage in. Furthermore, some of Walton’s critics\nhave denied that visual imagination is an essential feature of picture\nperception (Savile 1986); and others have denied that the concept of a\nvisual game of make-believe can capture the experience of seeing in,\non the grounds that Walton fails to integrate the\n“recognitional” and “configurational” aspects\nof the experience, or at least fails to integrate them in the right\nway. However, the force of this objection is blunted to some degree by\nthe disagreement among Wollheim’s followers about the right way\nof explaining how the experience of seeing in is integrated. (For\nobjections to Walton, see Wollheim 1998, 2003b; Budd 2008a; Nanay\n2004. For Walton’s replies to objections, see Walton 2008b,c.\nFor an alternative analysis of seeing in in terms of imagining, see\nStock 2008. For different views about the “integration” of\nseeing in, see Abell & Bantinaki 2010; Newall 2015; Voltolini\n2015.) \nInflection: As noted above, the alleged\n“integration” of seeing in has been a matter of debate.\nThis is especially true with respect to cases where the marks on the\nsurface of a picture are not merely a means by which the spectator\nperceives its content, but are designed by the artist to contribute to\nthe content of the picture in virtue of their character as marks. For\nexample, in several pastel drawings made in the 1880s, in which\n Degas depicts a woman drying herself,\n he trace of the pastel rubbing against the paper’s surface\nsubliminally registers the motion of the towel against the\nwoman’s skin. In this kind of case, as Michael Podro\nexplains, \nthe recognition of the subject is extended and elaborated by the way\nits conditions of representation, the medium and the psychological\nadjustments the painting invites become absorbed into its content.\n(Podro 1998: 2) \nThe spectator’s experience of this phenomenon has been called\n“inflected seeing in”, and both the phenomenon and the experience have\nreceived considerable attention, both from philosophers who maintain\nthat depiction can be defined in experiential terms, and from those\nwho doubt or deny this. Lopes (2005a) makes the interesting claim that\ninflection solves the puzzle of mimesis: in other words, it\nexplains why we value or enjoy seeing pictures of kinds of objects\nthat we do not value or enjoy seeing face-to-face (The seminal\ntreatment of this problem is in Aristotle’s Poetics (Book\nIV). Noteworthy discussions of inflection include Hopkins 2010, Nanay\n2010, and Voltolini 2013. Broader discussions of the kinds of\npictorial experience that pictures in different styles can elicit\ninclude Lopes 2005a, Cavedon-Taylor 2011, Newall 2011, and Bradley\n2014.) \nWe noted in\n §3.1\n that experiential theories seek to explain depiction in terms of the\nkind of experience a picture causes in a spectator, rather than the\nsubpersonal cognitive mechanisms a picture is thought to engage. Some\nphilosophers therefore maintain that theories which explain depiction\nin terms of the propensity of a picture to activate a\nspectator’s recognitional skills are not experiential theories,\non the grounds that recognition can occur without experience (Matthen\n2005: 25–26; Newall 2011: 21–23). Others either claim or\nassume, on the contrary, that recognition is a kind of\nexperience, at least the kind of recognition that is stimulated by a\npicture (Squires 1969; Schier 1986). \nThe basic thought that underlies recognition-based theories of\ndepiction is that a picture must be recognisable: \nIt must be the kind of thing that can be connected up with what the\nartist had in mind, if looked at in the right way by people with\naptitude and experience. […] Ultimately, we establish what is\nrecognisable by reference to what is recognised. (Squires 1969:\n203) \nThe same thought is developed by Schier. As noted above (see\n §2),\n Schier claims that our interpretation of pictures, unlike our\ninterpretation of words, is generated naturally: \nOnce you have succeeded in an initial pictorial interpretation\n[…] you should then be able to interpret novel icons without\nbeing privy to additional stipulations given only that you can\nrecognise the object or state of affairs depicted. (Schier 1986:\n43) \nAccordingly, Schier argues that depiction can be defined in terms of\nnatural generativity and recognition: a picture is the kind of\nrepresentation that causes naturally generated interpretations in\ncompetent spectators by activating their recognitional skills. Thus,\n“pictures are symbols whose interpretation can be causally\nexplained by relevant recognitional abilities” (Schier 1986:\n49). Specifically, “a picture of O is precisely something\nwhich can trigger the interpreter’s O-recognising\nabilities” (Schier 1986: 195). \nSchier’s basic thought was subsequently incorporated into an\neclectic theory of depiction by Dominic Lopes (1996). Drawing on\nGareth Evans’s information-theoretic account of reference (Evans\n1982; see §2.3 of the entry on\n reference)\n and Kendall Walton’s controversial claim that photographs are\n“transparent” (Walton 1984), as well as Schier’s\nrecognition-based theory of depiction, Lopes defends the following\nideas. \nFirst, pictures belong to “information systems”, and\ntransmit perceptual information from their subjects (Lopes 1996: 107),\nthereby engaging (and also extending) the recognitional skills\nspectators exercise in ordinary visual perception. “The ability\nto work out what pictures depict covaries with the ability to\nrecognize their depicta in the flesh” (2005a: 170). Second,\nLopes adopts Walton’s claim that photographs are\n“transparent”, i.e., spectators literally see the\nobjects that appear in photographs, as if through a pane of glass, and\nnot merely visual records or sources of information about them.\nHowever, Lopes extends this claim to encompass every kind of picture:\n“there is as much reason to believe that we see through\npaintings and drawings as through photographs” (1996: 181).\nThird, pictures present aspects of their subjects, by making both\n“commitments” and “non-commitments” regarding\ntheir properties: “Every picture represents its subject as\nhaving some property that precludes it from making commitments about\nsome other property” (Lopes 1996: 125). For example, a picture\nthat depicts a man sporting a beard makes a commitment regarding the\nproperty of being hirsute, but by the same token is non-commital\nregarding the property of having a dimpled chin. Explicit\n“non-commitment” distinguishes depiction from other kinds\nof representation. (For criticism see Herwitz 2000, Savile 2000,\nKulvicki 2006.) Fourth, pictorial styles, or systems of pictorial\nrepresentation, differ from each other in the kinds of aspects they\ntypically present. Pictorial competence is relative to specific styles\nor systems: to be able to interpret a picture, one needs to have the\nrecognitional skills corresponding to the system to which it belongs\n(Lopes 1996: 152–3). \nThese ideas face various difficulties, some of which we have already\nconsidered in connection with other experiential theories. First,\nLopes’s ideas about the transmission of perceptual information\nand the transparency of pictures are difficult to apply to pictures of\nfictional individuals and genre pictures (Hopkins 1997). Second, the\ntransparency claim has been criticised even in the case of\nphotographs, where the problem of fictional subjects and genre\npictures does not normally arise (Currie 1995). Third, the claim that\npictures differ from other kinds of representations in that only\npictures explicitly “non-commit” to properties has been\nchallenged (Kulvicki 2006). Finally, as we have seen, Walton’s\ntheory that picture are props in games of visual make-believe does not\nseem capable of explaining how the shapes of the marks on the surface\nof a picture constrain the shapes of the objects they represent, or\nthe imaginative games they invite spectators to engage in.\nRecognition-based theories are open to a similar objection. Various\ntheories of depiction are compatible with the claim that pictures\nactivate the same recognitional skills as the kinds of objects they\ndepict. The question on which they differ is why they do so. For\nexample, is it because the shape of a region on a picture’s\nsurface is identical to the occlusion shape of the object it depicts?\nOr is it because part of a picture’s surface occupies a region\nof the spectator’s two-dimensional visual field that she\nexperiences as similar in shape to a region in which the kind of\nobject that it depicts could be presented? Or is it for some other\nreason? Without an answer to this question, the problem of explaining\nhow pictures represent is elaborated by introducing ideas about\nrecognition, natural generativity and transparency, but it is not\nsolved (Newman 1998; cf. Neander 1987, Sartwell 1991). \nAs we have seen, any plausible theory of depiction will need to\naccommodate the wide variety of styles of picture-making. Art history\ncontains more sophisticated and fertile treatments of the concept of\nstyle than philosophy does, notably by Heinrich Wolfflin (1950), Alois\nRiegl ([1893] 1992), Erwin Panofsky (1997), Ernst Gombrich (1968), and\nMeyer Schapiro (1994). However, one topic in the theory of style on\nwhich there is a substantial philosophical literature is\nrealism. \nThe term “realism” and equivalent terms in other European\nlanguages were introduced into literary and art criticism during the\nnineteenth century, and paintings and sculptures are still commonly\ndescribed as realistic (faithful, true to nature, etc.) by critics and\nhistorians of art. However, many philosophers and historians of art\nsince the 1920s have expressed scepticism about the idea that some\nstyles of art represent reality more truthfully or faithfully than\nothers (Jakobson [1921/1971] 1987; Steinberg [1953] 1972; Nochlin\n1971; Stewart 1997). The most influential exponent of this view is\nGoodman, who argues that realism cannot be a matter of fidelity to\nnature, and cannot be measured by resemblance to reality, because our\njudgements about fidelity to nature depend on our visual habits, which\nare shaped in turn by the visual culture we inhabit, and the images we\nare used to seeing and interpreting. Resemblance cannot be a\n“constant and independent” standard against which works of\nart can be measured, because “the criteria of resemblance vary\nwith changes in representational practice” (Goodman 1968: 39).\n“The literal or realistic or naturalistic system of\nrepresentation”, Goodman claims, “is simply the customary\none”. \nRealism is relative, determined by the system of representation\nstandard for a given culture or person at a given time. Newer or older\nor alien systems are accounted artificial or unskilled. (1968: 37) \nGoodman’s argument has been challenged on several grounds.\nFirst, the realistic system of representation cannot simply be the\nstandard or customary one, because as an artistic style evolves,\nspectators are inevitably less accustomed to innovative subjects and\ntechniques than they are to the ones these modify or replace. So if\nGoodman’s claim were true, an artistic style could never become\nmore realistic, in the eyes of spectators living at the time. But the\nhistorical record proves, on the contrary, that it does (Newall 2011:\n119–121). Second, Goodman exaggerates the extent to which visual\nexperience is modified by art. Oscar Wilde famously claimed that there\nhad been no fog in London before it appeared in Turner’s\npaintings. But in fact, writers generally described optical effects\nlong before painters learned to represent them. For example, the\nspinning highlights on a chariot-wheel were described by the Latin\npoet Prudentius many centuries before Velazquez captured this effect\nin paint. Third, even if the art we see does modify our visual habits\nand influence the resemblances we perceive to some extent, it does not\nfollow that realism cannot consist in resemblance or fidelity to\nnature. Compare the relationship between theory and observation in\nscience. The growth of scientific knowledge has enabled us to refine\nour observations of natural phenomena, and these observations have in\nturn enabled us to test scientific theories. There is nothing\nsuspicious about this interaction between theory and observation, and\nnothing that should make us wonder whether we possess a\n“constant and independent” standard, with which scientific\ntheories can be assessed (see §4; of the entry on\n theory and observation in science\n and  §3 of the entry on \n Popper). \nIt is now generally agreed that the concepts of resemblance and\nfidelity to nature are too vague and metaphorical to explain what\nrealism is, and that “realist” or “realistic”\nart proceeds from specific values, methods and viewpoints, no less\nthan other kinds of art (Schapiro 1978). Furthermore, confusion about\nrealism is compounded by the fact that the term is used to describe a\nvariety of period styles, including late medieval and early\nRenaissance art, Dutch painting in the seventeenth century, and French\npainting in the nineteenth century. But it does not follow that\n“realism” is merely an honorific term, which we apply to\nart in a familiar style, or that fidelity to nature is a vacuous\nidea. \nThe fundamental distinction we need to draw, in order to clarify the\nconcept of realism, is between realism in subject-matter and realism\nin technique (Hyman 2005). Realism in subject-matter is about the\nchoice of subject-matter and the manner in which it is treated.\nRealistic art, in this sense, represents the lower social classes,\ncomic as opposed to tragic material, daily life as opposed to myth.\nFor example, in the paintings of Courbet, Manet and Degas the\ntraditional hierarchy of genres, which promoted the representation of\nhistory, myth or allegory, is definitively set aside, and the everyday\nlives of people belonging to the lower social classes are taken\nseriously, and placed in a contemporary social setting, as they are in\nthe novels of Balzac and Flaubert. \nRealism in technique is a different phenomenon, which can be traced\nback to the revolutionary developments in Greek art between the sixth\nand fourth centuries BC, specifically, developments in anatomy and in\nthe representation of space and light. Since philosophers and art\ntheorists abandoned the idea that realism can be defined in terms of\nfidelity to nature or resemblance, most of those who do not regard\nrealism as a purely ideological concept or a sham (e.g., Stewart 1997;\nNeer 2002) have defined realism in technique in terms of information:\neither the quantity of information recorded in a picture (Gombrich\n1960; Schier 1986), or the quantity of relevant or visually salient\ninformation (Lopes 1996; Sartwell 1994; Abell 2006, 2007; Kulvicki\n2006), or the ease with which information issues (Goodman 1968), or\nthe range of information (Hyman 2005), is said to be the, or the\nprincipal, measure of realistic art. (See also Walton 1990; Chasid\n2007; and Newall 2011 for comparable views.) \nAccording to Hyman, realism in technique can be defined in terms of\nthree characteristics: accuracy, animation, and\nmodality (Hyman 2005: 40–46). Accuracy means the\naccurate depiction of a kind of material or object or activity, such\nas water or satin, a palm tree or a dove, sleeping, galloping or\nmaking love. Animation combines mobility with the expression of\nemotion, character or thought (see also Penrose 1973: 268). The term\n“modality” refers to the expressive potential available to\nartists during a particular phase in the development of an artistic\ntradition, in other words, the range of kinds of information that the\ntechnical resources available to artists allow them to record: \nThe technical resources of pictorial art are always limited in their\nexpressive range, as languages are also bound to be; and these\ntechnical resources, like languages, can expand in different\ndirections to express new ideas and new observations. The development\nof realistic techniques is the expansion of the modality of art, in\nother words, the expansion of what it is possible for art to\nrepresent. (Hyman 2009: 497) \nThe commonest argument debunking the idea of a realistic artistic\nstyle depends on the thought that artistic styles are analogous to\nlanguages (see above,\n §2\n for references). The comparison is intended to underline the extent\nto which artists rely on systems of conventions, and to discourage the\nidea that some styles are more truthful, or closer to reality, than\nothers. For the things we say are not truer or closer to reality if we\nsay them in French, or English, or Chinese. However, the analogy\nactually supports the claim that expressive potential is the measure\nof realistic art. For languages are not like codes or scripts. For\nexample, the Hieratic and Hieroglyphic Egyptian scripts do not differ\nin the range of information they can be used to record, and neither do\nSemaphore and Morse code. But languages obviously differ widely in\ntheir expressive powers, and have expanded rapidly in some periods of\nhistory. Thus, the difference between trecento and seicento Italian\nart is comparable to the difference between the English of\nChaucer’s Canterbury Tales and the English of\nMilton’s Paradise Lost, not to that between Morse Code\nand Semaphore or between English and French (see Ackerman 1978:\n157–160; Hyman 2005: 47).","contact.mail":"bantinaki@fks.uoc.gr","contact.domain":"fks.uoc.gr"}]
