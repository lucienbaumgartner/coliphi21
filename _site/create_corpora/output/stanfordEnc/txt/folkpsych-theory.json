(1) Sometimes “folk psychology”\nis used to refer to a particular set of cognitive capacities which\ninclude—but are not exhausted by—the capacities to predict\nand explain behavior. (2) The term “folk psychology” is\nalso used to refer to a theory of behavior represented in the brain.\nAccording to many philosophers and cognitive scientists, the set of\ncognitive capacities identified above are underpinned by folk\npsychology in this second sense. (3) The final sense of “folk\npsychology” is closely associated with the work of David Lewis.\nOn this view, folk psychology is a psychological theory constituted by\nthe platitudes about the mind ordinary people are inclined to\nendorse.\n\n\nTo reduce terminological ambiguity, throughout this entry the term\n“mindreading” will be used to refer to that set of\ncognitive capacities which include (but is not exhausted by) the\ncapacities to predict and explain behavior. “Folk\npsychology” will be used only in the second and third senses\nidentified above. When separate names are required to avoid confusion,\nthe second sense of “folk psychology” will be called the\nmindreading approach to folk psychology and the third sense\nthe platitude approach to folk psychology. This terminology\nis due to Stich & Nichols 2003.\n\n\nIt’s not clear who introduced the term “folk\npsychology” into the philosophy of mind. It gained wide usage\nduring the 1980s and is rarely used outside philosophy. The phrase\n“commonsense psychology” is sometimes used by philosophers\nsynonymously with “folk psychology”, although the former\nterm seems to be dying out. Psychologists rarely use “folk\npsychology”, preferring the phrase “theory of mind”\n(or sometimes “naïve psychology”). Just as there is\nambiguity in the use of “folk psychology”, “theory\nof mind” is used to refer both to mindreading and to the theory\nhypothesized to underpin mindreading.\n\nThere’s an important set of human cognitive capacities first\nnoticed by social psychologists and philosophers in the middle of last\ncentury (see for example Heider 1958 and Sellars 1956.) The members of\nthis set of cognitive capacities are almost always assumed to be\nclosely related, perhaps in virtue of their being produced by a single\nunderlying cognitive mechanism. To a first approximation the set\nconsists of— \n(See for example Stich & Nichols 1992.) The second and third\ncapacities are clearly related: explaining the behavior of humans in\nterms of their mental states involves attributing mental states to\nthem. But we should not assume without further investigation that all\nmental state attributions take the form of explanations of\nbehavior. \nThe characterization of mindreading given above is too restrictive. In\naddition to attributing mental states and predicting and explaining\nbehavior, there is a wide range of closely related activities. To\nbegin with, we not only seek to predict and explain people’s\nbehavior, we also seek to predict and explain their mental states. In\naddition, we speculate about, discuss, recall and evaluate both\npeople’s mental states and their behavior. We also speculate\nabout, discuss, recall and evaluate people’s dispositions to\nbehave in certain ways and to have certain mental states; that is, we\nconsider their character traits. It may be that these additional\nactivities are grounded in the three capacities mentioned above, but\nwe cannot simply assume that they are. Throughout this entry the term\n“mindreading” is used in a wide sense to include all of\nthese activities. \nAs characterized above, mindreading is a human capacity directed at\nhumans. But in two ways this is overly exclusive. First, we attribute\nmental states to non-human animals and to non-animal systems such as\nmachines and the weather. It’s not uncommon to hear people say\nthat their dog wants a bone, or that the chess program is\nthinking about its next move. We do not have to accept every\nsuch attribution at face value; plausibly, some of this talk is\nmetaphorical. Nevertheless, there seem to exist plenty of examples of\nnon-metaphorical attributions of mental states to non-humans. (Notice\nthat insisting that mental state attributions to animals are not\nmetaphorical is compatible with such attributions being systematically\nfalse.) Consequently, we must be careful not to characterize\nmindreading in a way which makes it definitional that only\nhumans can be the objects of mindreading. The second way in which the\ncharacterization of mindreading offered above is overly focused on\nhumans is that it remains an open question whether some non-human\nprimates can predict the behavior of their conspecifics. (See for\nexample Call & Tomasello 2008.) Consequently, we should avoid\ncharacterizing the mindreading capacities in a way that makes it\nanalytic that non-human animals lack those capacities. \nOne way to avoid the risk of over-emphasizing human capacities when\ncharacterizing mindreading is to begin with the human capacities and\nthen let the empirical chips fall where they may. For example, it may\nturn out that some non-human primates can predict the behavior of\ntheir conspecifics, and that there are significant similarities\n(including neurological similarities) between the human capacity to\npredict the behavior of others and that of the non-human primate. In\nthat case we should widen the characterization of mindreading given\nabove so that it is not exclusively focused on human capacities.\nSimilarly, it may turn out that precisely the same cognitive\nmechanisms are engaged when humans attribute mental states to their\nconspecifics and when they attribute mental states to animals and\nmachines. In that case we should widen the characterization of\nmindreading to allow that animals and machines can be the objects of\nmindreading. Defining the precise extension of\n“mindreading” by stipulation from the armchair is not\nlikely to be fruitful. \nA final comment on mindreading is in order. The characterization of\nmindreading given here is compatible with the existence of first\nperson mindreading. But it may turn out that we deploy quite distinct\nmechanisms when we predict or explain our own behavior, or attribute\nmental states to ourselves, than when we predict or explain\nother’s behavior, or attribute mental states to them. However,\nthis is not an issue which can be settled here. (See the entry on\n self-knowledge.) \nHow is mindreading achieved? One popular theory, often called the\n“theory-theory”, holds that when we mindread we access and\nutilize a theory of human behavior represented in our brains. The\nposited theory of human behavior is commonly called “folk\npsychology”. On this view, mindreading is essentially an\nexercise in theoretical reasoning. When we predict behavior, for\nexample, we utilize folk psychology to reason from representations of\nthe target’s past and present circumstances and behavior\n(including verbal behavior), to representations of the target’s\nfuture behavior. Chomsky’s claim that understanding and\nproducing grammatical sentences involves a representation of the\ngrammar of the relevant language is frequently offered as analogy.\n(See for example Carruthers 1996a: 29.) \nThe claim that folk psychology is represented “in the\nhead” raises a range of important empirical questions. These\nquestions are extensively interrelated, with research in one area very\noften having significant consequences for research in other areas. \nIn addition to the issues just outlined, there is a further empirical\nquestion with which theory-theorists have been engaged. Is it the case\nthat mindreading is in fact underpinned by a theory of human\npsychology? Is mindreading really a theoretical activity? A variety of\nphilosophers and psychologists have argued that it is not, or have at\nleast argued that there is more to mindreading than theorizing.\nAccording to simulation theory, mindreading involves a kind of mental\nprojection in which we temporarily adopt the target’s\nperspective (Gordon 1986; Goldman 1989; Goldman 2006). (See the entry\non\n folk psychology: as mental simulation.)\n According to the Narrative Practice Hypothesis, mindreading involves\nnot theoretical reasoning but the construction of a certain kind of\nnarrative (Hutto 2008). And according to intentional systems theory,\nmindreading is achieved by adopting a particular stance towards a\nsystem such as another human being (Dennett 1971; 1987). Important\nthough these alternatives are, they will not be assessed in this\nentry. \nThe remainder of this section is in three parts. Part 2.2 briefly\nsurveys some of the important issues surrounding the development of\nmindreading in children and its evolution in our lineage. Part 2.3\nprovides a quick overview of work in social psychology aimed at\nexploring mindreading. And Part 3 introduces the idea that folk\npsychology is more like a scientific model than a deductive-normative\ntheory. \nThere exists a very substantial body of research on the development of\nmindreading in young children. In an early paper, Heinz Wimmer and\nJoseph Perner (1983) describe what is now usually called the\n“false belief test”. In the original version of the test,\nthe participants are introduced to a puppet, Maxi. Maxi shows the\nparticipants that he has a piece of chocolate, and then hides his\nchocolate in the “cupboard”—a cardboard box. He then\nannounces that he is going out to play and leaves the scene. A second\npuppet now enters and is introduced as Maxi’s Mom. Mom finds the\nchocolate in the cupboard and moves it to a second box, the\n“refrigerator”. Mom leaves and Maxi returns, saying that\nhe is going to retrieve his chocolate. The action stops and the\nsubjects are asked some control questions to check that they\nunderstand what has happened. They are then asked in which box Maxi\nwill look for his chocolate, the cupboard or the refrigerator?\nStrikingly, children up to about four years of age typically reply\nthat Maxi will look in the refrigerator, while children older than\nfive typically say that Maxi will look in the cupboard. The standard\ninterpretation of this experiment is that children younger than four\ntypically lack the concept of belief, or at best have only a poor\ngrasp of the concept of belief. In particular, they don’t\nappreciate that beliefs can misrepresent reality. (Not everyone\naccepts that the false belief task reveals a conceptual deficit:\nvarious authors have argued that the task reveals a deficit of\nperformance rather competence. For a judicious\nreview of some of this literature see Goldman 2006, Section 4.3.) The\nMaxi experiment set off an avalanche of research aimed at discovering\nexactly how and when mindreading develops in young children. (Useful\nreferences for this literature are Astington, Harris & Olson 1988;\nWellman 1990; and Baron-Cohen, Tager-Flusberg & Cohen 2000.) A\ndebate between empiricists and nativists quickly emerged, strongly\nreminiscent of the empiricism versus nativism debate about the\ndevelopment of grammar. \nOne of the most important defenders of empiricism about folk\npsychology is the developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik (Gopnik\n& Wellman 1994; Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997; Gopnik, Meltzoff &\nKuhl 1999). Gopnik and her co-workers begin with a bold empirical\nconjecture—that the cognitive mechanisms which drive the\nchild’s development of folk psychology are exactly those\nmechanisms which drive the adult scientist’s development of\nscientific theories. This view has been dubbed the “child as\nlittle scientist view”. In support of this conjecture, Gopnik\nappeals to the history of science. Drawing on the work of Thomas Kuhn\n(1962), she identifies a pattern in the way scientists respond to\nanomalous observations. Gopnik argues that when scientists are\nconfronted by an anomaly they are initially inclined to dismiss it as\nnoise or some other form of aberration. If the anomaly cannot easily\nbe handled in this fashion, ad hoc conjectures are added to the\noriginal theory to deal with it. If counterevidence continues to\naccumulate, new theories are developed which are unencumbered by the\ngrowing excrescence of ad hoc conjectures. Very often, though, the new\ntheory is applied only to the more recalcitrant anomalies. Finally,\nthe new theory is applied across the domain and becomes very widely\naccepted. (See Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997: 39–41. See the entry\non\n Thomas Kuhn.) \nGopnik argues that the pattern of scientific progress just sketched is\nrecapitulated in the child’s acquisition of folk psychology,\nthus supporting her claim that the mechanisms used by the child to\nacquire folk psychology are the same as those used by the adult to\nmake scientific discoveries. (See Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997: Ch.5.)\nGopnik’s view is open to a number of objections. To begin with,\nit is not at all clear that the pattern of scientific progress Gopnik\nidentifies is universal. For example, the history of geological\nscience seems to provide an example where two competing research\nprograms—vulcanism and neptunism—merged into a single,\nwidely accepted paradigm. If Gopnik’s historical claims are\nmistaken then the pattern of conceptual development she observes in\nyoung children does not support the claim that the child deploys the\nsame mechanisms as the adult scientist. Second, it has been argued\nthat Gopnik’s view is at odds with the apparent universality of\nthe development of folk psychology: the vast majority of children pass\nthrough similar developmental stages to arrive at the same theory of\nhuman psychology, and do so on a common developmental timetable.\nSurely individual child-scientists beavering away in isolation would\npass through different developmental stages to arrive at divergent\ntheories of human psychology, and do so on distinct developmental\ntimetables (Carruthers 1996b: 23). The claim that there is a universal\ndevelopmental time table for the acquisition of folk psychology has\nnot gone unopposed. Some author’s have argued for the existence\nof considerable cross-cultural variation in the development of\nmindreading. See for example Lillard 1997; 1998; Nisbett 2003 and\nVinden 1996; 1999; 2002. \nNativists take the (purported) existence of a near-universal\ncompetence arrived at via a near-universal developmental pathway as\nevidence that the development of folk psychology is very strongly\ninfluenced by the child’s genes: the species-wide developmental\npattern is explained by our species-wide genetic inheritance\n(Carruthers 1996b: 23). They also offer a poverty of stimulus argument\nto the same conclusion. Children as young five are highly competent\nmindreaders and so must possess an extensive array of psychological\nconcepts and a rich body of information about human psychology. They\ncould not, though, have acquired those concepts and that information\nfrom their environment—their environment simply does not provide\nsufficient learning opportunities. Consequently, a considerable amount\nof folk psychology must be innate. (See for example Scholl &\nLeslie 1999.) A great deal of work is required, however, to sustain an\nargument of this nature. The proponent of any poverty of stimulus\nargument must demonstrate that the stimulus is impoverished relative\nto the mature competence. That in turn requires measuring the\ninformation content of the environment and comparing it with the\ninformation demands of the competence. In the case of folk psychology,\nwe lack an accurate measure of the information demands of the\ncompetence because crucial questions about the nature of mature\nmindreading remain unresolved. For example, Daniel Hutto has suggested\nthat many cases of successful behavior prediction rely not on a\nsophisticated theory of mind but on simple generalizations (Hutto\n2008: 6). Consider a case where John predicts that Betty will stop at\na red traffic signal. Perhaps John arrived at his prediction by\nreasoning as follows. \nTherefore, \nHowever, John might arrive at his prediction in quite a different way.\nHe might simply rely on the following generalization: most drivers\nstop at red traffic signals. Hutto suspects that the latter\nexplanation is the right one (a similar observation is made in Goldman\n1987). More generally, Hutto endorses a kind of deflationism about\nmindreading: he thinks that philosophers and psychologists have\nexaggerated the amount of folk psychologizing that occurs. If it could\nbe demonstrated that a great deal of mindreading rests not on folk\npsychologizing but on the deployment of simple generalizations, then\nwe would have to reduce our estimate of the information demands of\nmindreading. Such a reduction would in turn weaken the plausibility of\nthe poverty of stimulus argument. (See Hutto 2008: 181–6;\nSterelny 2003: 214–8.) \nSo far we have seen that we are not presently in a position to\naccurately measure the information demands of the human mindreading\ncompetence. In addition, we are only beginning to appreciate the\ninformational richness of the child’s learning environment. Kim\nSterelny (2003: Ch. 8) has placed great stress on what he calls\n“epistemic niche construction”. Animals can modify their\nenvironments to generate new information, make old information more\nsalient, and reduce cognitive demands. Sometimes these environmental\nmodifications endure long enough to enhance the fitness of the next\ngeneration. In particular, parents may modify their child’s\nenvironment in ways which facilitate their acquisition of folk\npsychological concepts and information (Sterelny 2003: 221–5).\nHutto has suggested that one way in which this might occur is by story\ntelling (Hutto 2008). As Hutto observes, many stories make apparent\nthe links between the characters’ environment, mental states and\nbehavior, and so may facilitate the child’s understanding of\nthose links. If Sterelny and Hutto are right, the child’s\nlearning environment is richer than we might have supposed, and the\npoverty of stimulus argument for folk psychology is correspondingly\nweakened. \nSince the 1950s, social psychologists have explored the ways in which\nhumans think about and describe behavior and personality. Fritz Heider\n(1958) marked an important distinction between intentional and\nunintentional behavior, and argued that everyday explanations of\nintentional behavior are importantly different from those of\nunintentional behavior. In particular, explanations of an\nagent’s intentional behavior very often appeal to the\nagent’s reasons. Subsequent work in the field, however,\ntended to draw a fundamental distinction between “person”\nand “situation” causes of behavior. Person causes are\nlocated within the agent; situation causes are located in the\nagent’s environment. Bertram Malle has noted that the\nperson/situation distinction is importantly different from the\nintentional/unintentional one (2004, especially Section 1.1). The\nproximate causes of intentional behavior—the agent’s\nreasons—are indeed internal to the agent; however, the proximate\ncauses of some unintentional behaviors are also internal to\nthe agent. For example, screaming in response to a terrifying stimulus\nis unintentional and yet its proximate cause—fear—is\ninternal. So the distinction between behavior due to person causes and\nthat due to situation causes cuts across the distinction between\nbehavior caused by reasons and behavior caused by other factors. \nWe can see the person-situation distinction at work in Harold\nKelley’s theory of attribution (Kelley 1967). A theory of\nattribution is a theory of how ordinary people assign causes to events\nsuch as behaviors and mental states (understood broadly to include\ncharacter traits). For ease of expression, I shall focus on cases in\nwhich the aim is to explain a person’s behavior. Kelley\nelaborates the person-situation distinction by distinguishing between\ntwo kinds of potential situational causes: the object towards which\nthe behavior is directed and the circumstances in which the behavior\noccurs. Consider a case in which person \\(P\\) performs an action \\(A\\)\ntowards an object \\(O\\) in circumstance \\(C\\): John kissed Betty at\nthe party. The causal attributions we make depend on our assessment of\nthe following three questions. \nKelley predicted that John’s behavior would be attribute to a\nproperty of John, a property of Betty, or a property of the party\naccording to the following table: \nKelley’s prediction has been experimentally confirmed by a range\nof studies (see Von Eckardt 1997 for details). \nPerhaps because the category of person causes fails to distinguish\nbetween reasons and other internal causes, social psychologists in the\n1960s and 1970s paid little attention to reasons. Rather, much of the\nfocus was on character traits. Research during this period explored\nimportant correlations between judgments of appearance and judgments\nof character trait, and between judgments of one character trait and\nanother. For example, participants who judge that a person is\nattractive on the basis of a photo (appearance) are also likely to\njudge that he or she is kindly (trait) (Berscheid & Walster 1974).\nAgain, if a person is judged to be talkative (trait), they are also\nlikely to be judged to be adventurous (trait) (Norman 1963). As\nBarbara Von Eckardt has observed, these kinds of folk psychological\ninferences have been almost entirely ignored in the philosophy of mind\n(Von Eckardt 1994 and 1997). \nWhilst the person-situation distinction has underpinned important\nresearch in the social psychology of mindreading, it has not been\nuniversally endorsed. Lee Ross (1977: 176) invites us to consider the\nfollowing pair of explanations: \nThe cause cited in explanation (1) would standardly be coded as\nsituational; that in explanation (2) as personal. However, most people\nare inclined to say that Jack and Jill’s respective house\npurchases were motivated by the same reason. This\nstrongly suggests that the linguistic structure of explanations is a\npoor guide to the causal antecedents of behavior. \nOver the last decade, Malle has urged a return to Heider’s\noriginal insight, which marked an important distinction between\nintentional and unintentional behavior (see especially Malle 2004).\nMalle’s research strongly supports the claim that people\ndistinguish between intentional and unintentional behavior. For\nexample, Malle and Knobe (1997) gave subjects descriptions of 20\nbehaviors, and asked them to rate how intentional the behaviors were\non an eight point scale \\((0 =\\) “not at all”; \\(7 =\\)\n“completely”). (Half the subjects were given a definition\nof intentionality; the other half had to rely on their untutored\nconception of intentionality.) There was considerable agreement\namongst all the subjects as to which of the described behaviors were\nintentional and which were not. \nWithin the category of intentional behaviors, Malle has identified\nthree different modes (his term) of explanations. \n(See Malle 2004, Ch. 4.) Notice the centrality of reasons in all these\nmodes of explanation. Reason explanations and causal history of reason\nexplanations are obviously concerned with the agent’s reasons.\nEnabling factor explanations also involve the agent’s reasons\nsince they concern the factors which render the agent’s reasons\nefficacious. In contrast, explanations of unintentional behaviors\ndon’t appeal to the agent’s reasons. Unintentional\nbehaviors include overt behaviors over which the agent has no control\n(slipping on an icy step) and emotional expressions such as blushing.\nIn these cases the explanations people offer resemble the kinds of\nexplanations they offer for the behavior of inanimate objects (Malle\n2004: 111). \nIn addition to identifying a variety of explanatory modes people adopt\ntowards intentional behavior, Malle also identifies the features of\nthe explanatory situation which drive the selection of one explanatory\nmode rather than another. Two examples of Malle’s work in this\narea are as follows (Malle 2004, Section 5.2). The action is difficult to perform v. the action is easy to\nperform. Difficult actions (eg Jill’s riding a unicycle)\nare usually explained by appealing to enabling factors (eg She\npracticed a lot). In contrast, if the action is easy to produce (eg\nJill went for a walk), we tend to produce either reason explanations\n(eg She wanted to keep fit) or causal history of reason explanations\n(eg Her trainer told her that walking is an ideal way to keep\nfit). The explanation is produced by the agent v. the explanation is\nproduced by an observer. Actors tend to produce explanations of\ntheir own behavior which stress their beliefs. For example, consider\nJack who wrote a letter to the mayor protesting against the\ncity’s housing policy. Jack explains his action by saying that\nhe thought the mayor would listen. In contrast, observers\ntend to produce explanations which stress the agent’s desires.\nJill, who has observed Jack’s letter writing, explains\nJack’s action by saying that he wanted to change the\npolicy. \nThere is more to an explanation of intentional behavior than its mode.\nJill did not explain Jack’s letter writing by merely saying that\nhe had a desire; she said that he wanted to change the\npolicy. Reasons are propositional attitudes, and normally reason\nexplanations specify the propositions involved as well as the\nattitudes. How do folk psychologists identify the propositions of an\nagent’s attitudes when offering reason causes? Malle suggests a\nnumber of cognitive processes which perform this task. One of his\ncentral claims is that propositional contents are inferred from\nspecific or generic information about the agent (Malle 2004: 140).\nConsider again Jill’s explanation of Jack’s writing to the\nmayor: He wrote to the mayor because he wanted to change the\ncity’s housing policy. Jill might attribute this particular\ndesire to Jack because she has often heard Jack talk disparagingly\nabout the city’s current policy. However, there must be\ninferential processes which enable Jill to (a) locate information\nrelevant to explaining Jack’s action and (b) pass from the\nbelief that Jack objects to the current policy to the conclusion that\nJack wrote the letter because he wanted to change the current policy.\nAccording to the theory-theory, these inferential processes involve a\ntheory which maps the complex relations between stimuli, mental states\nand behavior; that is, the inferences involve folk psychology. So the\naccount of propositional attitude attribution is incomplete until we\nhave a detailed—and empirically validated—account of folk\npsychology. What is required here is a response to item C in the list\nof empirical issues given in Part 2.1: What is the content of folk\npsychology? What states and properties does it quantify over, and what\nregularities does in postulate? (See Von Eckardt 1994.) It’s\nfair to say that, at present, we lack detailed answers to these\nquestions. \nAs noted above, many proponents of the theory-theory take folk\npsychology to be akin to a scientific theory. In addition, they\ntypically embrace the deductive-normative approach to scientific\nexplanation (Hempel and Oppenheim, 1948). On this view, explaining\nphenomenon \\(P\\) requires deriving \\(P\\) from a set of sentences\n\\(S\\), where \\(S\\) includes a law. For example, let \\(P\\) be\n“The ball accelerated at 5ms\\(^{-2}\\) second”. \\(P\\) can\nbe derived from Newton’s second law (Force = mass \\(\\times\\)\nacceleration) and the additional information that the ball’s\nmass is 2kg and the force is 10N. That is, Newton’s second law,\ntogether with the additional information, explain why the ball\naccelerated at 5m per second per second. \nUnderstood on deductive-nomological approach, folk psychological\nexplanations involve at least one folk psychological law plus\ninformation specific to the situation. For example, Sally’s\navoiding the snake would be explained by attributing to Sally a fear\nof snakes and appealing to the law “People avoid things they are\nafraid of”. (See for example Churchland, 1970; 1981.) \nThere is, however, an alternative approach to scientific explanation\naccording to which at least some scientific theorising involves models\nin a specific sense I will describe momentarily. If this is right,\ntheory-theorists who endorse the idea that mindreading is akin to\nscientific explanation cannot assume that mindreading involves\ndeploying psychological laws. Mindreading might involve building and\nutilising a model rather than theories as traditionally conceived\n(Maibom, 2003 and Godfrey-Smith, 2005). I regard this approach as a\nspecial case of the theory-theory. \nA model in the relevant sense is a set of hypothetical structures that\nare broadly similar to each other and that are constructed from a\ncommon set of elements. For example, the one-locus model of natural\nselection consists of a number of hypothetical structures composed of\nelements such as fitness and genotype, all of which conform to a basic\ngeneral pattern (Godfrey-Smith 2005). Often the structures take the\nform of equations, but this need not be the case. \nModels serve various ends. At one extreme a scientist may construe the\nmodel as nothing more than a predictive device; at the other she may\nconstrue it as accurately describing the causal structure of the\ntarget system. That is, models admit both instrumentalist and realist\nconstruals. \nMaibom (2003) and Godfrey-Smith (2005) propose that folk psychology is\na model; that is, a set of hypothetical structures built from a common\nset of elements including beliefs, desires, actions, emotions and so\nforth. Godfrey-Smith’s fundamental insight is that the folk\npsychological model can be elaborated in various ways to serve\ndifferent purposes in different circumstances. In some circumstances\nthe model is treated as a prediction device: What will Fred do when he\ndiscovers the cafe is closed? In others it might be used to arrive at\nexplanations of action: Why did Fred go to the cafe? In still others\nthe model is elaborated to yield explanations that appeal to both\nproximate and distal causes of behavior. \nAs noted above, models can be construed both instrumentally and\nrealistically, and folk psychology is no exception. The folk\npsychological model allows multiple construals, ranging from\ninstrumentalism through to “industrial strength realism”.\n(The latter expression is Dennett’s (1991).) The model also\nadmits other kinds of elaborations. For example, degrees of belief and\ndesire can be allowed, and rationality constraints imposed. These\nrecondite theories of human action are hypothetical structures that\nshare the same basic structure, and involve the same set of elements,\nas more commonplace structures of the folk psychological model. \nIn a series of influential papers, David Lewis (1966, 1970, 1972,\n1994) defended a particular approach to the semantics of theoretical\nterms, applied that approach to the everyday psychological vocabulary\n(eg “belief” and “desire”), and thereby obtain\na functionalist theory of mental states. Whilst Lewis does not give an\nexplicit definition of the term “folk psychology”, an\naccount of folk psychology naturally emerges from his approach. \nOn Lewis’s view, theoretical terms get their meaning from the\nrole they play in the theory in which they are used; they are, says\nLewis, “definable functionally, by reference to their causal\nroles” (Lewis 1972: 204). Lewis begins with a theory, \\(T\\),\nwhich includes both new terms introduced by \\(T\\) and old terms\nalready understood before \\(T\\) emerged. The new terms are called\n“theoretical terms” or “\\(T\\)-terms” for\nshort. The label “theoretical term” is merely intended to\nindicate that the terms were introduced by \\(T\\) rather than by, say,\nostension or by some theory which pre-dates \\(T\\). The old terms are\ncalled “\\(O\\)-terms” for short. (Lewis stresses that the\n\\(O\\)-terms are not necessarily observational terms, “whatever\nthose maybe” (1972: 205).) \\(T\\) can be expressed as a single\nsentence—perhaps as a long conjunction: \n\n\\[\nT[t_1 \\ldots t_n],\n\\]\n\n where\n“\\(t_1 \\ldots t_n\\)” stands for all the \\(T\\)-terms in\n\\(T\\). (The \\(O\\)-terms have been suppressed to reduce clutter.) If we\nsystematically replace the \\(T\\)-terms with free variables, \\(x_1\n\\ldots x_n\\), and prefix an existential quantifier binding the\n\\(n\\)-tuple \\(x_1 \\ldots x_n\\), we obtain the Ramsey sentence\nfor \\(T\\): \n\n\\[\n\\exists(x_1 \\ldots x_n)T(x_1 \\ldots x_n).\n\\]\n\n  \nThe Ramsey sentence says that there exists an n-tuple of entities\nwhich realizes \\(T\\); that is, \\(T\\) has at least one realization.\nLewis is concerned to rule out the possibility of multiple\nrealizations of T. It is, he claims, implicit in the stating of a\ntheory that it has a unique realization; if a theory is multiply\nrealized then it is false and its \\(T\\)-terms fail to refer (Lewis\n1972: 205). He therefore adopts the modified Ramsey sentence\n\n\\[\n\\exists !(x_1 \\ldots x_n)T(x_1 \\ldots x_n),\n\\]\n\n which says that there exists a unique \\(n\\)-tuple of\nentities that realizes \\(T\\). \nThe Carnap sentence is a conditional with the Ramsey sentence\nas antecedent and \\(T\\) as its consequent: \n\n\\[\n\\exists(x_1 \\ldots x_n)T(x_1 \\ldots x_n) \\rightarrow T[t_1 \\ldots t_n].\n\\]\n\n  \nThe Carnap sentence says that if \\(T\\) is realized, the \\(t\\)-terms\nname the corresponding entities of some realization of \\(T\\). Given\nLewis’s aversion to multiple realization, he prefers the\nmodified Carnap sentence which is a conditional with the\nmodified Ramsey sentence as antecedent and \\(T\\) as the\nconsequent: \nThe modified Carnap sentence says that if \\(T\\) is uniquely realized,\nthe \\(t\\)-terms name the corresponding entities of the unique\nrealization of \\(T\\). To cover those cases in which \\(T\\) is not\nuniquely realized, either because it is multiply realized or not\nrealized at all, Lewis adds an additional conditional: \nThis conditional says that, if \\(T\\) is not uniquely realized, then\n\\(t_1 \\ldots t_n\\) name nothing. Taken together, the last two\nconditionals are equivalent to a series of sentences which define each\n\\(T\\)-term strictly in \\(O\\)-terms: \nWe have now obtained an explicit definition for each \\(T\\)-term.\nMoreover, says Lewis, the definitions are functional\ndefinitions: “The \\(t\\)-terms have been defined as the occupants\nof the causal roles specified by the theory \\(T\\); as the entities,\nwhatever those maybe, that bear certain causal relations to one\nanother and to the referents of the \\(O\\)-terms” (Lewis 1972:\n207). These definitions were implicit in the original theory \\(T\\) in\nthe sense that no additional content has been added to \\(T\\) in their\nderivation. (Lewis observes that the definitions do in fact contain\nadditional content, for their derivation assumes that \\(T\\) is\nuniquely realized. He claims, though, that the assumption of\nuniqueness was made implicitly when \\(T\\) was stated. See the remarks\nabout uniqueness scattered through out Section I of Lewis 1972.)\nLet’s now turn to the way Lewis applies his theory of\ntheoretical terms to the everyday psychological vocabulary. \nLewis begins by imagining the set of all the everyday, commonsense\nplatitudes about mental states. He treats this set of platitudes as a\nterm-introducing psychological theory, with the \\(T\\)-terms being the\nnames of the commonsense psychological states—beliefs, desires,\npains, hungers, etc—and the \\(O\\)-terms being terms drawn from\nthe non-psychological part of the everyday English vocabulary. The\nformal method sketched above yields explicit definitions of the\n\\(T\\)-terms. These definitions are functionalist in that they describe\nthe causal roles in which the named entities participate:\n“pain” names the state which occupies so-and-so causal\nrole. (Lewis 1966 (fn 6) distinguishes between pain and the\nattribute of having pain. Pain is the state which plays the\npain-role, and which state plays the pain-role may differ from world\nto world. The attribute of having pain is the having of a\nstate—whatever state that might be—which plays the\npain-role.) \nClearly, we need an account of the platitudes. Which everyday claims\nabout mental states count as part of the term-introducing theory?\nHere’s Lewis (1972: 207–8. See also Lewis 1966: 100): \nCollect all the platitudes you can think of regarding the causal\nrelations of mental states, sensory stimuli, and motor responses.\nPerhaps we can think of them as having the form: \nWhen someone is in so-and-so combination of mental states and receives\nsensory stimuli of so-and-so kind, he tends with so-and-so probability\nto be caused thereby to go into so-and-so mental states and produce\nso-and-so motor responses. \nAlso add all the platitudes to the effect that one mental state falls\nunder another—“toothache is a kind of pain” and the\nlike. Perhaps there are platitudes of other forms as well. Include\nonly platitudes which are common knowledge among us—everyone\nknows them, everyone knows that everyone knows them, and so on. \nLewis uses the explicit functional definitions of the commonsense\npsychological terms he has obtained as premises in an argument for\nphysicalism about mental states (Lewis 1972: 204): \nFrom (1) and (2) by transitivity we obtain: \nPremise (1) is a functional definition of \\(M\\) obtained by the\nRamsey-Carnap-Lewis method sketched above. Premise (2) is\noverwhelmingly supported by physiology. (In Lewis 1966, the second\npremise is more general: the occupant of the causal role is identified\nwith a physical state. Lewis then defends the second premise\nby endorsing the explanatory adequacy of physics.) So Lewis argues\nstraightforwardly from functionalism to physicalism. \nWith this picture in place, it is worth asking what precisely folk\npsychology is on Lewis’s approach. To my knowledge, Lewis never\nexplicitly defines the term. However, when giving the semantics of the\neveryday psychological vocabulary, he treats the conjunction of\ncommonsense platitudes about mental states as a term-introducing\ntheory, so it is natural to identify folk psychology with that\nconjunction. Alternatively, we could think of folk psychology as a\nsystematization of the set of platitudes. \nIt is important to stress that Lewis’s position has not been\nwithout its detractors. In particular, many philosophers of language\nhave objected to Lewis’s semantic theory. In the 1960s and 1970s\nan alternative approach to semantics was introduced by David Kaplan\n(1968), Keith Donellan (1970), Hilary Putnam (1975) and Saul Kripke\n(1980). This approach separates the meaning of a theoretical term from\nthe role it plays in the theories in which it is found; that is, it\nseparates meaning from use. These alternative conceptions of meaning\nare broadly compatible with of Lewis’s metaphysical conclusions;\nfor example, they are compatible with Lewis’s physicalism.\nHowever, they are incompatible with the way Lewis obtains his\nconclusions. \nSetting aside questions of semantics, note that Lewis is hostage to\nempirical fortune in ways he does not acknowledge. Lewis’s\nclaims about the platitudes are empirical claims—they are claims\nabout what is commonly believed about mental states and as such can\nonly properly be investigated by careful scientific research. There is\nno evidence that Lewis undertook the appropriate studies. Moreover, it\nis very likely that Lewis’s own intuitions about mental states\nwere influenced by his theoretical stance, and consequently there is\nlittle reason to think that Lewis’s own intuitions are a good\nguide to what people typically believe about the mind. \nNotice that Lewis only recognizes two kinds of platitudes: those that\nexpress causal relations between mental states, stimuli and behavior,\nand those that indicate when one type of mental state is contained by\nanother. He admits that there maybe “platitudes of other forms\nas well” (Lewis 1972: 207–8), but this is disingenuous\nbecause his overall functionalist conclusion requires that all\nplatitudes take one of the two forms he identifies. Thus the\nfunctionalist conclusion could not be obtained if there were\nplatitudes expressing the view that mental states are substances which\nhave their causal powers non-essentially, or which lack causal powers\naltogether. It may turn out, for example, that the folk conceive of\npain as an essentially experiential state with non-essential causal\nconnections to stimuli and behavior. Lewis is simply assuming that\ncommonsense is resolutely committed to the idea that mental states are\ncharacterized by causal role; that is, the functionalist conclusion\ndrives the characterization of the platitudes. No doubt Lewis has\nphilosophical arguments for denying that mental states are substances\nwhich have their causal powers non-essentially, or substances that\nlack causal powers altogether. But that is beside the present point.\nLewis’s intention was to capture what the folk think about\nmental states, not what the philosophical literati think\nabout mental states. Lewis also assumes that the platitudes form a\nlargely coherent set. He can handle minor inconsistencies because he\nproposes to form not a grand conjunction of all the platitudes, but a\ngrand disjunction of conjunctions of most of the platitudes. However,\nhe is still assuming that consistent sets containing most of the\nplatitudes can be obtained. This may or may not be the case, and we\nwill only find out by doing the relevant empirical research. \nThere is some evidence that Lewis recognized these difficulties\nhimself. In his “Reduction of Mind” he remarks that\n“Pace Lewis, 1972, p. 256, eliciting the general\nprinciples of folk psychology is no mere matter of gathering\nplatitudes” (1994: 416). He also remarks that folk psychology\n“is common knowledge among us; but it is tacit, as our\ngrammatical knowledge is” (1994: 416). These remakes are\nconsistent with his adopting some version of the mindreading sense of\nfolk psychology (see section 2 above); however, they are too cryptic\nfor us to establish exactly what Lewis’s final position was. \nEliminativists have argued that there are no beliefs and no desires\n(see for example Churchland 1981; Stich 1983). One prominent argument\nfor eliminativism begins with folk psychology: Therefore, \nIt is not immediately obvious that this argument is valid, for we may\nhave a range of reasons for accepting the existence of beliefs and\ndesires—reasons unaffected by the truth or falsity of folk\npsychology (see Kitcher 1984; Von Eckardt 1994). Moreover, in light of\nthe proceeding discussion it is clear that the first two premises are\nambiguous. As we have seen, the term “folk psychology” is\nused in at least two different ways in the philosophical and\npsychological literatures. Consequently, the argument just sketched\nhas at least two interpretations, and may be sound on one but not on\nthe other (Stich & Ravenscroft 1992). Similar remarks apply to an\nanti-eliminativist argument advanced by early simulation theorists\nsuch as Robert Gordon (1986) and Alvin Goldman (1989). On their view,\nmindreading does not involve a representation of folk psychology in\nthe mindreader’s brain, and consequently we have no reason to\nthink that folk psychology exists. They then argue that, since there\nis no such thing as folk psychology, the question of the existence or\notherwise of its posits simply does not arise. However, the first\npremise of this argument needs to be stated more carefully. If\nsimulation theory (as conceived by its early proponents) is true, then\nthere is no such thing as folk psychology on the mindreading sense\nof that term. But that is entirely compatible with the existence\nof folk psychology on the platitude sense of the term. (For\nuseful discussions of eliminativism see Kitcher 1984; Horgan &\nWoodward 1985; Von Eckardt 1994; and the entry on\n eliminative materialism.) \nFurther reading.
