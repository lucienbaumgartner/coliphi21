Maximal greatness (or perfection)\nincludes omnipotence. According to traditional Western theism, God is\nmaximally great (or perfect), and therefore is omnipotent. Omnipotence\nseems puzzling, even paradoxical, to many philosophers. They wonder,\nfor example, whether God can create a spherical cube, or make a stone\nso massive that he cannot move it. Is there a consistent analysis of\nomnipotence? What are the implications of such an analysis for the\nnature of God?\n\nPhilosophical reflection upon the notion of omnipotence raises many\npuzzling questions about whether or not a consistent notion of\nomnipotence places limitations on the power of an omnipotent agent.\nCould an omnipotent agent create a stone so massive that that agent\ncould not move it? Paradoxically, it appears that however this\nquestion is answered, an omnipotent agent turns out not to be\nall-powerful. Could such an agent have the power to create or overturn\nnecessary truths of logic and mathematics? Could an agent of this kind\nbring about or alter the past? Is the notion of an omnipotent agent\nother than God an intelligible one? Could two omnipotent\nagents coexist? If there are states of affairs that an omnipotent\nagent is powerless to bring about, then how is the notion of\nomnipotence intelligibly to be defined? Moreover, an obstacle to\ntraditional Western theism arises if it is impossible for God to be\nmorally perfect and omnipotent. If an omnipotent God is powerless to\ndo evil, then how can he be omnipotent? Rational theology seeks an\nanalysis of the concept of omnipotence that resolves the puzzles and\napparent paradoxes that surround this concept. If the notion of\nomnipotence were found to be unintelligible, or incompatible with\nmoral perfection, then traditional Western theism would be false. \nAccording to some philosophers, omnipotence should be understood in\nterms of the power to perform certain tasks, for instance, to\nkill oneself, to make \\(2+2=4\\), or to make oneself non-omniscient.\nHowever, in recent philosophical discussion, omnipotence has been\nanalyzed in terms of the power to bring about certain possible\nstates of affairs, understood as propositional entities which\neither obtain or fail to obtain (Rosenkrantz & Hoffman 1980; Flint\n& Freddoso 1983; and Wierenga 1989). Because we believe that it\ncan yield an adequate analysis of omnipotence, we take this latter\napproach in what follows. \nOne sense of ‘omnipotence’ is, literally, that of having\nthe power to bring about any state of affairs whatsoever,\nincluding necessary and impossible states of affairs. Descartes seems\nto have had such a notion (Meditations, Section 1). Yet,\nAquinas and Maimonides held the view that this sense of\n‘omnipotence’ is incoherent. Their view can be defended as\nfollows. It is not possible for an agent to bring about an\nimpossible state of affairs (e.g., that there is a\nshapeless cube), since if it were, it would be possible for an\nimpossible state of affairs to obtain, which is a contradiction (see\nAquinas, Summa Theologiae, Ia, 25, 3; and Maimonides,\nGuide for the Perplexed, Part I, Ch. 15). Nor is it possible\nfor an agent to bring about a necessary state of affairs\n(e.g., that all cubes are shaped). It is possible for an\nagent, \\(a\\), to bring about a necessary state of affairs,\n\\(s\\), only if possibly, (1) \\(a\\) brings about \\(s\\),\nand (2) if \\(a\\) had not acted, then \\(s\\) would have failed\nto obtain. Because a necessary state of affairs obtains whether or not\nanyone acts, (2) is false. As a consequence, it is impossible for an\nagent to bring about either a necessary or an impossible state of\naffairs. Many philosophers accept the principle that if an agent has\nthe power to bring about a state of affairs, then this\nentails that, possibly, the agent brings about that state of\naffairs. If this principle is correct, then the foregoing\nabsolute sense of ‘omnipotence’ is incoherent.\nAmong contemporary philosophers, Earl Conee (1991) rejects this\nprinciple in order to defend the view that an omnipotent being would\nhave the power to bring about any state of affairs whatsoever. \nA second sense of ‘omnipotence’ is that of\nmaximal power, meaning just that no being could\nexceed the overall power of an omnipotent being. It does not follow\nthat a maximally powerful being can bring about any state of\naffairs, since, as observed above, bringing about some such states of\naffairs is impossible. Nor does it follow that a being with maximal\npower can bring about whatever any other agent can bring\nabout. If \\(a\\) can bring about \\(s\\), and \\(b\\)\ncannot, it does not follow that \\(b\\) is not overall\nmore powerful than \\(a\\), since it could be that \\(b\\) can\nbring about more states of affairs than \\(a\\) can, rather than\nthe other way around. For the remainder of this entry the discussion\nconcentrates on this comparative sense of\n‘omnipotence’ as maximal power. Within the context of that\ndiscussion, it will be assumed that it is not possible for an\nagent to have the power to bring about any state of affairs\nwhatsoever. \nThat a being is omnipotent just provided that its overall power is\nnot possibly exceeded by any being may be adopted as the most\ngeneral definition of omnipotence in this sense (Hoffman &\nRosenkrantz 2010). Still, the availability of a more fine-grained and\ninformative analysis, directly applicable to the full range of problem\ncases, is highly desirable. A number of prominent proposals for such a\nmore fine-grained and informative analysis of omnipotence will be\ndiscussed later.  \nPower should be distinguished from ability. Power is\nability plus opportunity: a being which has maximal ability but which\nis prevented by circumstances from exercising those abilities would\nnot be omnipotent. Nothing could prevent an omnipotent agent from\nexercising its powers, if it were to endeavor to do so. \nIn the light of the foregoing, is it possible that there be a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents? Among contemporary\nphilosophers of religion, Richard Swinburne (2008) holds that a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents is possible. \nIf a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents were even possible,\nthen possibly, at a time, \\(t\\), some omnipotent agent,\n\\(x\\), while retaining its omnipotence, endeavors to move a\nfeather, and at \\(t\\), another omnipotent agent, \\(y\\),\nwhile retaining its omnipotence, endeavors to keep that feather\nmotionless. Intuitively, in this case, neither \\(x\\) nor\n\\(y\\) would affect the feather as to its motion or rest. Thus, in\nthis case, at \\(t\\), \\(x\\) would be powerless to move the\nfeather, and at \\(t\\), \\(y\\) would be powerless to keep the\nfeather motionless! But it is absurd to suppose that an omnipotent\nagent could lack the power to move a feather or the power to keep it\nmotionless. Therefore, neither \\(x\\) nor \\(y\\) is\nomnipotent. This line of reasoning appears to reduce the notion of a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents to absurdity. If such a\nreductio ad absurdum is sound, then a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent agents is impossible. \nIt might be replied that while neither of the omnipotent agents in\nquestion brings about what it endeavors to bring about, each of them\ncan do so, since each of them has the ability to do\nso; they fail to bring about what they endeavor to bring about only\nbecause they lack the opportunity to do so. But earlier\nobservations about the difference between power and ability and how\neach of them is related to omnipotence entail that omnipotence should\nbe understood in terms of the ability plus opportunity sense\nof ‘can’. If those earlier observations are correct, then,\nsince neither of the omnipotent agents under discussion can\ndo [in the ability plus opportunity sense] what it endeavors to do,\nthe possible reply under discussion does not succeed. \nOr it might be replied that the possible pair(s) of coexistent\nomnipotent agents would necessarily avoid stalemates of the\nforegoing sort in virtue of the members of each pair resembling one\nanother in some respect. This reply seems suspiciously ad\nhoc. It appears that the members of any possible pair of\ngenetically identical human twins could be stalemated, e.g., in an\narm-wrestling match. Why would not the same be true of a pair of\nsimilar coexistent omnipotent agents? It might be answered that each\nof the members of any possible pair of coexistent omnipotent agents\nwould be necessarily omniscient and necessarily morally perfect.\nMoreover, if two omnipotent agents are necessarily\nomniscient, they won’t disagree about any\nfact, and if they are necessarily morally perfect, they\nwon’t disagree about what is morally required\nor about whether they want so to act. It might then be\ninferred that any states of affairs that a pair of coexistent\nomnipotent agents would endeavor to bring about at a given time are\ncompatible. In the literature, the controversial social\ntrinitarianism of Richard Swinburne (2008), implies that the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are a trio of coexistent\nomnipotent agents each of whom is necessarily omniscient and\nnecessarily morally perfect. \nHowever, one might object to the preceding reply on the grounds that\nif there is a pair of coexistent necessarily omniscient and\nnecessarily morally perfect omnipotent agents, then there is a pair of\nincompatible contingent states of affairs each of which is\nmorally optional for these agents, that is, neither morally\nprohibited nor morally required for them. The objection then proceeds\nas follows. It may be assumed that that the feather moves at\nt and that the feather remains motionless at t are a\npair of states of affairs of the sort in question. Apparently, also,\npossibly, under such circumstances, the state of affairs that the\nomnipotent agents in question are stalemated in their endeavors to\naffect the feather as to its motion or rest at t is morally\noptional for those agents. Analogously, in an arm-wrestling match\nbetween \\(A_1 \\amp A_2\\),\npossibly, the states of affairs that \\(A_1\\) wins\nthe match, that \\(A_2\\) wins the match, and\nthat \\(A_1 \\amp A_2\\) are stalemated in the\nmatch are morally optional for \\(A_1\\) and\n\\(A_2\\). In the light of the foregoing observations, it\nappears that if it is possible that there are omnipotent agents of the\nsort in question, then possibly, one of them endeavors to make the\nfeather move at \\(t\\), while the other endeavors to keep it\nmotionless at \\(t\\), even given their hypothesized necessary\nareas of epistemic and moral agreement. The foregoing defense of\nthe possibility of a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents is\npersuasive only if there is a cogent reply to this objection. \nWould it strengthen such a defense to further require that the\ncoexistent omnipotent agents are necessarily aesthetically\nperfect, and hence, won’t disagree about what\nis aesthetically required or about whether they want so to\nact? It appears not. After all, there appear to be incompatible,\ncontingent, aesthetically optional states of affairs, i.e.,\nstates of affairs which are neither aesthetically required nor\naesthetically prohibited for some agent, and considerations parallel\nto those adduced above apply. Moreover, it is not clear that\nfutile striving necessarily has negative aesthetic\nvalue, witness, e.g., Camus’s The Myth of Sisyphus, and\nin any case, it can be argued plausibly that the equipoise of\nopposing forces possibly has positive aesthetic value,\nimplying that opposed volitional activities of coexistent omnipotent\nbeings would not necessarily be futile. \nFurther doubts about the possibility of a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent beings are raised by considerations outlined below which\nseem to show that if some possible world is maximally good,\nin other words, is a best possible world, then no\npossible world is [uniquely] the best possible world, and\nlikewise with respect to a possible world that is second best, third\nbest, and so on. \nHere it is assumed that if there is a best possible world, then there\nis at least one such possible world containing contingently existing\nindividual substantial individuals. A parallel assumption is made\nabout any possible world good enough to be actualized by an\nomnipotent, omniscient, morally perfect, aesthetically perfect being,\ne.g., by a maximally great divinity such as God. But, with respect to\nany possible world containing contingently existing substantial\nindividuals, it appears that there is another possible world\nexactly resembling it but populated by different\ncontingently existing substantial individuals. It further appears that\nthe value of one of these worlds is equal to the value of another of\nthese worlds. So, it appears that if one of these possible worlds is\nbest, second best, third best, etc., then there is another possible\nworld of the ordinal rank in question. \nMoreover, different possible goods combined in different possible ways\nmay constitute different, logically independent, possible total goods\nof the same value. The following simple example illustrates this\npoint. Let it be assumed that the pleasure which would be produced by\nJohn’s eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight and the\npleasure that would be produced by John’s eating a garlic pizza\nfor dinner tonight are logically independent possible goods of the\nsame value. All other things being equal, a possible world containing\nJohn’s eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight and\nJohn’s not eating a garlic pizza tonight, and a possible world\ncontaining John’s eating a garlic pizza for dinner tonight and\nJohn’s not eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight,\nconstitute different possible goods of the same value. Generalizing\nfrom examples of this kind, it appears that if some possible world is\nbest, second best, third best, and so on, then there are\nother possible worlds, not exactly resembling them,\nwhich are best, second best, third best, and so on. \nSo, for any possible pair of coexistent God-like omnipotent agents, it\nappears that one member of that pair could endeavor to\nactualize a different, equally good, world than the other member\nof that pair, even given their hypothesized necessary epistemic,\nmoral, and aesthetic perfection. In the light of the reductio ad\nabsurdum presented earlier, it appears to follow that such pairs\nare impossible. \nLeibniz argued that there is a uniquely optimal possible world by\nappealing to the Principle of Sufficient Reason and the\nIdentity of Indiscernibles, notoriously concluding that the\nactual world is the best of all possible worlds. Among\ncontemporary philosophers, both the Principle of Sufficient\nReason and the Identity of Indiscernibles are\ncontroversial. \nAnother possible defense of the possibility of a plurality of\ncoexistent omnipotent agents appeals to quantum mechanics. Quantum\nentanglement seems to be a unique physical phenomenon whereby\nconcurrent activities of diverse contingently existing substantial\nindividuals are directly coordinated in virtue of a necessary linkage\nof some sort between those substantial individuals. By drawing an\nanalogy with this phenomenon, one might argue that there could be\ncoexistent omnipotent agents who necessarily avoid stalemates. Quantum\nmechanics implies that there exist pairs of entangled micro-particles\nsuch that it is causally necessary that one member of the pair is\nspin up if and only if the other member of the pair is\nspin up, independently of the locations of those\nmicro-particles. Albert Einstein skeptically described the theoretical\nphenomenon of entanglement as “spukhafte Fernwirkung,”\nthat is, as “spooky action at a distance.” Nowadays,\nhowever, entanglement is an experimentally confirmed part of physics.\nArguably, by analogy with entanglement, if a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent agents is possible, then there could be\n“entangled” omnipotent agents, \\(A_1\\) and\n\\(A_2\\), such that it is metaphysically necessary that\n\\(A_1\\) endeavors to bring about a certain state of\naffairs if and only if \\(A_2\\) endeavors to bring about\nthe same state of affairs. But quantum mechanics further implies that\nthere are entangled pairs of micro-particles such that it is causally\nnecessary that one member of the pair is spin up if and only\nif the other member of the pair is spin down. The properties\nof being spin up and being spin down are contraries.\nThus, if the analogy with quantum entanglement is taken seriously,\nthen by parity of reasoning, one should conclude that if a plurality\nof necessarily cooperating coexistent omnipotent agents is possible,\nthen possibly, there are “entangled” omnipotent\nagents, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), such that\nit is metaphysically necessary that \\(A_1\\) endeavors\nto act in some way if and only if \\(A_2\\) endeavors to\nact in a contrary way. Given this conclusion, and in the\nlight of the reductio ad absurdum of the possibility of a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents presented earlier, an\nargument in favor of such a possibility by analogy with quantum\nentanglement undermines itself, thereby reinforcing that\nreductio. So, one cannot credibly defend the metaphysical\npossibility of a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents by drawing\nan analogy with the phenomenon of quantum entanglement. \nFinally, could one credibly defend such a metaphysical possibility via\nthe hypothesis that it is metaphysically possible for there to be a\nplurality of necessarily indiscernible omnipotent God-like beings (in\nthe Leibnizian sense of indiscernible)? Because a plurality\nof necessarily indiscernible objects is of dubious\nintelligibility, such a defense would not be credible. Doubts about\nthe intelligibility of such a plurality arise because of perplexities\nconcerning the individuation and separation of any pair of necessarily\nindiscernible objects, and because positing the existence of a\nplurality of such objects is metaphysically extravagant and\ngratuitous. Indeed it seems that there is just as much reason to posit\nindefinitely many objects of the sort in question as there is to posit\na pair of them, whereas the intelligibility of a necessarily\nself-indiscernible object is not in doubt. A representative\nexample of a hypothetical plurality of necessarily indiscernible\nobjects is a plurality of necessarily coincident geometrical\npoints. In addition to the perplexities concerning the individuation\nand separation of any pair of such points, the assumption that it is\nmetaphysically possible for there to be a plurality of necessarily\ncoincident points is metaphysically frivolous. Post-Scholastic\nridicule of the sort that was directed at the alleged ontological\nexcesses of the Schoolmen, e.g., the query “How many angels may\nfit upon the point of a needle?”, is quite appropriately\ndirected at metaphysical hypotheses of this sort. For these reasons,\nthe intelligibility of a plurality of necessarily coincident\ngeometrical points is suspect; the same is true of the intelligibility\nof a plurality of necessarily indiscernible omnipotent God-like\nbeings. \nCould an agent be accidentally omnipotent? At first glance, this\nappears possible, but there is the following argument for the opposite\nview. On the assumption that God exists, he has necessary existence,\nis essentially not temporally limited, and is essentially omnipotent.\nBut there could not be two coexistent omnipotent agents. Thus, on the\nassumption that God exists, an accidentally omnipotent being is\nimpossible. \nThis argument against the possibility of accidental omnipotence\npresupposes traditional Western theism. However, traditional Western\ntheism is highly controversial, and neutrality about whether\nGod exists has some advantages. If one is neutral about whether God\nexists, then omnipotence should not be assumed to be\nattributable only to the God of traditional Western theism or\nonly to an essentially omnipotent being. \nThe intelligibility of the notion of omnipotence has been challenged\nby the so-called paradox or riddle of the stone. Can an omnipotent\nagent, Jane, bring it about that there is a stone of some mass, \\(m\\),\nwhich Jane cannot move? If the answer is ‘yes’, then there\nis a state of affairs that Jane cannot bring about, namely,\n(S1) that a stone of mass \\(m\\) moves. On the other hand, if\nthe answer is ‘no’, then there is another state of affairs\nthat Jane cannot bring about, namely, (S2) that there is a stone\nof mass \\(m\\) which Jane cannot move. Thus, it seems that whether\nor not Jane can make the stone in question, there is some possible\nstate of affairs that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about. And this\nappears to be paradoxical. \nA first resolution of the paradox comes into play when Jane is an\nessentially omnipotent agent. In that case, the state of\naffairs of Jane’s being non-omnipotent is impossible. Therefore,\nJane cannot bring it about that she is not omnipotent. Since,\nnecessarily, an omnipotent agent can move any stone, no matter how\nmassive, (S2) is impossible. But, as we have seen, an omnipotent agent\nis not required to be able to bring about an impossible state of\naffairs. \nIf, on the other hand, Jane is an accidentally omnipotent\nagent, both (S1) and (S2) are possible, and it is\npossible for some omnipotent agent to bring it about that (S1) obtains\nat one time, and that (S2) obtains at a different time. Thus,\nthere is a second solution to the paradox. In this case, Jane’s\nbeing non-omnipotent is a possible state of affairs; thus, we may\nassume that it is possible for Jane to bring it about that\nshe is non-omnipotent. So, Jane can create and move a stone,\n\\(s\\), of mass, \\(m\\), while omnipotent, and\nsubsequently bring it about that she is not omnipotent and\npowerless to move \\(s\\). As a consequence, Jane can bring about\nboth (S1) and (S2), but only if they obtain at different times.  \nIt might now be conjectured that omnipotence can be analyzed simply as\nthe power to bring it about that any contingent state of\naffairs obtains. However, the following list of contingent states of\naffairs shows that there can be contingent states of affairs that an\nomnipotent agent is powerless to bring about, and hence that this\nsimple analysis is inadequate: \nNote that (a) is a past state of affairs. Presumably, it is not\npossible for an efficient cause to occur later than its\neffect. However, an agent’s bringing about a state of affairs is\na kind of efficient causation. Therefore, it is not possible for an\nagent to bring about anything that is in the past. In other\nwords, it is impossible for any agent to have power over what\nis past. Hence, no agent, not even an omnipotent one, can bring it\nabout that (a) obtains. Likewise, despite the fact that (b) can be\nbrought about prior to \\(t\\), the impossibility of an\nagent’s having power over what is past implies that after\nt even an omnipotent agent cannot bring it about that (b)\nobtains. In the case of (c), prior to Parmenides’s first\nlecture, an omnipotent agent can bring about (c). But once Parmenides\nhas lectured, even an omnipotent agent cannot bring it about that (c)\nobtains. As for (d), prior to the Amazon’s third flooding, an\nomnipotent agent can bring it about that (d) obtains, while after the\nAmazon’s third flooding, even an omnipotent agent cannot bring\nit about that (d) obtains. (e) introduces a special difficulty.\nAlthough it is obvious that (e) could not be brought about by\nan omnipotent agent, it can be argued plausibly that it is\npossible for a non-omnipotent agent to bring about (e) by causing a\nsnowflake to fall, provided that no omnipotent agent\never\n exists.[1]\n But, as we argued earlier, a maximally powerful being need not have\nthe power to bring about every state of affairs that any other being\ncould. Lastly, while if the libertarian theory of free will is\ncorrect, an omnipotent agent (who is, of course, other than\nPlato) cannot bring about (f), apparently a non-omnipotent agent,\nnamely, Plato, can bring it about that (f) obtains. \nConsequently, a satisfactory analysis of omnipotence ought not to\nrequire that an omnipotent agent have the power to bring about (a),\n(b), (c), (d), (e), or (f), if it is assumed, arguendo, in\nthe case of (f), that libertarianism is true. \nBecause of the wide disparity among contingent states of affairs,\n(a)–(f), one might despair of finding an analysis of omnipotence that\nboth deals satisfactorily with all of these states of affairs and\nimplies that an omnipotent being has, intuitively speaking, sufficient\npower. Is such pessimism warranted, or is omnipotence analyzable? \nThere are at least two approaches to analyzing omnipotence that hold\nout some hope of success. The first utilizes the notion of an\nunrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs, and the second\nutilizes the notion of two worlds sharing their histories up to a\ntime. Although these approaches to analyzing omnipotence differ\nin important ways, they are in broad agreement on the leading idea\nthat maximal power has logical and temporal limitiations, including\nthe limitation that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about, i.e.,\ncause, another agent’s free decision in the libertarian sense.\nIn the following two sections, some recent instances of these\napproaches are set forth and compared. \nOne attempt to analyze omnipotence in terms of unrestricted\nrepeatability is the account of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz. According to\ntheir approach, by identifying certain features of (a)–(f), we\ncan find a feature that none of them possesses, and in terms of which\nan analysis of omnipotence can be stated. To begin, unless it is\npossible for some agent to bring about a given state of\naffairs, an omnipotent agent ought not to be required to be able to\nbring about that state of affairs. But (a) is not possibly brought\nabout by any agent. \nNext, while (b) and (c) are possibly brought about by some agent, they\nare not repeatable: it is not possible for either one of them\nto obtain, subsequently fail to obtain, and then obtain again. Note\nthat if, because (a) is not possibly brought about by someone, an\nomnipotent agent is not required to be able to bring about (a), then\nfor the same reason, that agent is also not required to be able to\nbring about impossible or necessary states of affairs. Moreover, if,\nbecause (b) and (c) are not repeatable, an omnipotent agent is not\nrequired to bring about (b) or (c), then for the same reason, that\nagent is also not required to be able to bring about impossible or\nnecessary states of affairs. These reasons for not requiring an\nomnipotent agent to have the power to bring about impossible or\nnecessary states of affairs cohere with our earlier independent\narguments for these restrictions. \nThird, while (d) is repeatable, it is not\nunrestrictedly repeatable, that is, it cannot obtain, then\nfail to obtain, then obtain again, and so on, eternally. \nFourth, while (e) is unrestrictedly repeatable, it is a\ncomplex state of affairs, namely, a conjunctive\nstate of affairs whose second conjunct is not repeatable.\nThese examples suggest a hypothesis about repeatability and its\nrelation to power, namely, that an omnipotent agent should\nnot be required to have the power to bring about\neither a state of affairs that is not unrestrictedly\nrepeatable, or a conjunctive state of affairs one of whose\nconjuncts is not unrestrictedly repeatable. \nLastly, although (f) is unrestrictedly repeatable, (f) is\nanother type of complex state of affairs. In particular, it is\nidentifiable with or analyzable as a conjunctive state of affairs.\nThis state of affairs has three conjuncts, the second of which is not\npossibly brought about by anyone. The conjunctive state of affairs in\nquestion can be informally expressed as follows: Plato decides to\nwrite a dialogue; and there is no antecedent sufficient\ncausal condition of Plato’s deciding to write a dialogue; and\nthere is no concurrent sufficient causal condition of Plato’s\ndeciding to write a dialogue. Because it is impossible for an agent to\nhave power over what is past, the second conjunct of this\nstate of affairs is not possibly brought about by anyone. Thus, an\nomnipotent agent ought not to be required to have the power to bring\nabout a state of affairs that is identifiable with or analyzable as a\nconjunctive state of affairs one of whose conjuncts is not possibly\nbrought about by anyone. \nAccording to the account of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz, incoporating\nthese ideas, omnipotence can be analyzed in terms of the following\nthree definitions. \nFor example, any period of time with a duration of 7 seconds is a\nsufficient interval for the state of affairs that a ball rolls for\n7 seconds. \nFor instance, the state of affairs that a ball rolls for 7\nseconds is unrestrictedly repeatable. \nIn (D3), \\(x\\) ranges over agents, and \\(s\\) over\nstates of affairs that satisfy the following condition: \nIn applying (D3) to states of affairs like (e) and (f) it\nshould be observed that a conjunct of a conjunctive state of\naffairs is a part of such a complex state of\n affairs.[4] \nAs intended, (D3) does not require an omnipotent agent to have\nthe power to bring about either impossible or necessary states of\naffairs, or states of affairs such as (a)–(f). Furthermore,\n(D3) does not unduly limit the power of an omnipotent agent,\nsince an agent’s bringing about a state of affairs can always be\n“cashed out” in terms of that agent’s bringing about\nan unrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs that it is possible for\nsome agent to bring about. That is, necessarily, for any state of\naffairs, \\(s\\), if an agent, \\(a\\), brings about \\(s\\),\nthen either \\(s\\) is an unrestrictedly repeatable state of\naffairs which it is possible for some agent to bring about, or else\n\\(a\\) brings about \\(s by\\) bringing about\n\\(q\\), where \\(q\\) is an unrestrictedly repeatable state of\naffairs which it is possible for some agent to bring about. For\ninstance, an omnipotent agent can bring about the state of affairs,\nthat in one hour, Parmenides lectures for the first time, by\nbringing about the state of affairs, that in one\nhour, Parmenides lectures, when this lecture is\nParmenides’s first. And although the former state of affairs is\na nonrepeatable one that (D3) does not require an\nomnipotent agent to be able to bring about, the latter state of\naffairs is an unrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs that\n(D3) does require an omnipotent agent to be able to\nbring about. \nThe alternative approach to analyzing omnipotence in terms of two\nworlds sharing their histories up to a time is exemplified by the\naccounts of Flint and Freddoso, and Wierenga. As we shall see,\nalthough these two accounts are similar, they differ in certain\nsignificant respects. \nFlint and Freddoso’s account of what it is for an agent\n\\(S\\) at a time \\(t\\) to be omnipotent in a possible world\n\\(W\\) is formulated as follows. \n\\(S\\) is omnipotent at \\(t\\) in \\(W\\) if and only if for any state of\naffairs \\(p\\) and world-type-for-\\(S\\) \\(Ls\\) such that \\(p\\) is not a\nmember of \\(Ls\\), if there is a world \\(W^*\\) such that  \nThe notion of a world-type-for-\\(S\\) \\(Ls\\) is to be\nunderstood in the following way. A world-type is “a set\nwhich is such that for any counterfactual of freedom, i.e.,\nany proposition which can be expressed by a sentence of the form\n‘If individual essence \\(P\\) were instantiated in\ncircumstances \\(C\\) at time \\(t\\) and its instantiation were\nleft free with respect to action \\(A\\), the instantiation of\n\\(P\\) would freely do \\(A\\)’—either that\ncounterfactual or its negation is a member of the set” (Flint\n& Freddoso 1983, p. 96). It may also be stipulated “that for\nany two members of the set, the conjunction of those two members is a\nmember of the set as well” (Flint & Freddoso 1983, pp.\n96–97). Moreover, “a world-type is true just in\ncase every proposition which is a member of it is true” (Flint\n& Freddoso 1983, p. 97). In addition, it is presupposed that\n“for any free agent \\(x\\), there will be a set of all and\nonly those true counterfactuals of freedom (or true negations of such\ncounterfactuals) over whose truth-value \\(x\\) has no\ncontrol” (Flint & Freddoso 1983, p. 97). A set of this kind\nis referred to as the world-type-for-x. Finally,\n‘\\(Lx\\)’ designates the\ntrue-world-type-for-\\(x\\). \nThe notion of actualization employed in this account of omnipotence\ncalls for some explanation. If an agent, \\(S\\), brings about a\nstate of affairs, \\(p\\), then \\(S\\) actualizes \\(p\\).\nHowever, this account presupposes that an agent may [weakly]\nactualize another agent’s making a free decision\nwithout bringing about or causing that decision. In\nparticular, it is assumed that an agent may weakly actualize a\ndecision that is free in the libertarian sense by bringing about the\nantecedent of a true “counterfactual of freedom.” \nThe basic idea of this account of omnipotence is that an agent is\nomnipotent just when he can actualize any state of affairs that it is\npossible for someone to actualize, except for certain\n“counterfactuals of freedom”, their consequents, and\ncertain states of affairs that are “accidentally\nimpossible” because of the past. \nWith respect to so-called counterfactuals of freedom, this account\npresupposes that some of them, for example, \nIf Jessica were offered the grant, then she would freely decide to\naccept it,\n \nare true. Some philosophers hold the contrary view that a\nsubjunctive conditional of this kind is necessarily\nfalse. Why do these philosophers reject the claim that some\n“counterfactuals of freedom” are true? Presumably, what\ndistinguishes a subjunctive conditional from a corresponding material\nconditional is that only the former expresses a strong or necessary\nconnection of some sort between the conditions specified by the\nantecedent and the consequent. Seemingly, the only kinds of strong or\nnecessary connections available in this case are relations [broadly\nspeaking] of either causation or entailment.\nConsequently, it appears that the subjunctive conditional under\ndiscussion is necessarily false, since if Jessica freely\ndecides to accept the grant [in the relevant libertarian sense], then\nher making that decision is neither caused nor\nentailed by her being offered the grant. If the foregoing\nline of reasoning is correct, then the notion of a true\n“counterfactual of freedom” is incoherent. Since Flint and\nFreddoso’s account of omnipotence presupposes that there are\nsuch “counterfactuals of freedom,” it can be argued that\nthis account is incoherent. \nMoreover, it can be argued that a state of affairs discussed earlier\nprovides a counter-example to Flint and Freddoso’s account of\nomnipotence, namely: \nA non-omnipotent agent can bring about or actualize (e) by bringing it\nabout that a snowflake falls when in fact no omnipotent agent ever\nexists. But, it is clear that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about\nor actualize (e). For although an omnipotent agent can bring it about\nthat a snowflake falls, surely, an omnipotent agent cannot bring it\nabout that no omnipotent ever exists, nor would this conjunct\nof (e) obtain if there were an omnipotent agent. Moreover, we may\nassume that there are possible worlds, \\(W\\) and \\(W^*\\),\nsuch that \\(W\\) and \\(W^*\\) share the same history up to a\ntime \\(t\\), no omnipotent agent ever exists in \\(W^*\\), and a\ncontingently omnipotent agent, Oscar, is omnipotent for the first time\nat \\(t\\) in \\(W\\). We may also assume that \\(W^*\\) is a\nworld in which at \\(t\\) some non-omnipotent agent actualizes (e).\nOn the other hand, evidently, if in \\(W\\), Oscar is omnipotent at\n\\(t\\), then at \\(t\\) Oscar cannot actualize (e). Note that\nsince the second conjunct of (e) is not unrestrictedly repeatable,\nthis is consistent with Hoffman and Rosenkrantz’s account of\nomnipotence; their account does not require an omnipotent agent to be\nable to bring about a conjunctive state of affairs one of whose\nconjuncts is not unrestrictedly repeatable. On the other hand, Flint\nand Freddoso’s account of omnipotence implies that in\n\\(W\\), at \\(t\\) Oscar has the power to actualize (e). This\nimplication holds for the following reasons. First, (e) is not a\nmember of a world-type-for-Oscar, inasmuch as (e) is neither a\n“counterfactual of freedom,” the negation of one, nor a\nconjunction of such “counterfactuals of freedom.” Second,\nwe may assume that a world-type-for-Oscar is true in both \\(W^*\\)\nand \\(W\\), since the assumption that an agent is not omnipotent\nin one possible world, and is omnipotent for a time in another\npossible world, does not necessitate any difference in the world-type\nfor that agent which is true in those worlds. Third, it is possible\nfor someone at \\(t\\) to actualize (e) in a world, \\(W^*\\),\nthat has the same history up to \\(t\\) as\n \\(W\\).[5]\n Thus, arguably, Flint and Freddoso’s account of omnipotence\nrequires that in \\(W\\) an omnipotent agent, Oscar, at \\(t\\)\nhas the power to actualize (e), when Oscar lacks this power. If this\nis right, then their account does not provide a logically necessary\ncondition on\n omnipotence.[6] \nA counter-example of this kind assumes that an analysis of omnipotence\nshould allow for the possibility of an omnipotent agent other than\nGod. Given this assumption, (e) seems to provide a counter-example to\nFlint and Freddoso’s account of omnipotence, but not to the\naccount of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz. \nLet us now turn to Wierenga’s account of omnipotence. The basic\nidea of Wierenga’s account of omnipotence is that an agent is\nomnipotent if and only if he can do anything that it is possible for\nhim to do, given the past. According to this account, we can analyze\nwhat it is for an agent, \\(A\\), to be omnipotent at \\(t\\) in\na world \\(W\\) in terms of what it is possible for A to\nstrongly actualize at \\(t\\) in worlds having the same history as\n\\(W\\) up to \\(t\\). \nWierenga’s account of omnipotence, like Flint and\nFreddoso’s, relies on the intuitive idea that two possible\nworlds can share the same past or history up to a certain point in\ntime, and then diverge. According to Wierenga’s account, two\nworlds of this kind share an initial segment, where\n\\(S (W, t)\\) is an initial segment of a\npossible world \\(W\\) up to a time \\(t\\) (Wierenga 1989, pp.\n18–20). Unlike Flint and Freddoso’s account,\nWierenga’s account is not stated in terms of what an agent can\nactualize, but rather in terms of the narrower notion of what an agent\ncan strongly actualize. An agent, \\(A\\), strongly\nactualizes just those states of affairs that \\(A\\) brings about\ndirectly or those actions that \\(A\\) does not do\nby doing something else (Wierenga 1989, pp. 20–23). Of\ncourse, an agent may actualize a state of affairs indirectly\nby strongly actualizing another state of affairs.\nWierenga’s account of omnipotence is formulated as follows. \nThis account of omnipotence may be vulnerable to a counter-example of\nthe following kind. Arguably, there could be an agent, \\(x\\),\nsuch that: \\(x\\) has a wide range of powers, \\(x\\) is\nessentially limited to these powers, and \\(x\\) essentially lacks\na power, \\(P\\), which an omnipotent agent ought to possess. Of\ncourse, \\(x\\) would not be omnipotent. Yet, Wierenga’s\naccount of omnipotence paradoxically implies that \\(x\\) would be\nomnipotent. Hence, it can be argued that Wierenga’s account does\nnot provide a logically sufficient condition for omnipotence. The\nassumption that there could be a non-omnipotent agent that is\nessentially limited in its powers can be defended as follows. An\nomnipotent agent has the power to overrule (or supersede) any law of\nnature (a mere physical necessity). For example, God\nhas the power to overrule the law of gravity by bringing it about that\na mountain floats in midair without any physical cause. Yet, arguably,\nit is possible for there to be a non-omnipotent agent who essentially\nlacks the power to overrule any law of nature. For example, it can be\nargued that there could be a physical or material agent who is\nessentially subject to certain laws of nature. Surely, such\nan agent would lack the power to overrule any law of nature, and so\nwould not be omnipotent. \nA similar, though weaker, sort of objection concerns McEar, a\nhypothetical agent who essentially has the power to do only\none thing, namely, scratch his ear. It may be objected that\nWierenga’s analysis of omnipotence falsely implies that McEar\nwould be omnipotent. But it might be replied that an agent such as\nMcEar is impossible. It can be cogently argued that, necessarily, if\nMcEar has the power to scratch his ear, then he also has the\npower to move a part of his body to scratch his ear, for instance, his\narm (Wierenga 1989, pp. 28–29). So, it appears that there could\nnot be an agent that has the power to do only one thing. In reply to\nthe stronger sort of objection discussed earlier, it may be suggested\nthat, necessarily, for any power, if an agent lacks that\npower, then an omnipotent being could give that agent that power\n(Wierenga 1989, p. 29). The difficulty with such a reply is that there\ncould be a non-omnipotent agent who essentially lacks the\npower to overrule any law of nature, and hence that not even an\nomnipotent agent could give this non-omnipotent agent that power. \nIt has been argued that the traditional God has incompatible\nattributes, namely, necessary existence, essential omnipotence,\nessential omniscience, and essential moral perfection (Pike\n 1969).[7]\n The contention has been that it is impossible for God to have the\npower to bring about evil, while non-omnipotent (and morally\nimperfect) beings may have this power. The precise form of such an\nargument varies depending on what precisely the relation between God\nand evil is assumed to be. However, generally speaking, it is argued\nthat divine moral perfection and omnipotence are incompatible because\ndivine omnipotence entails that God has the power to bring about evil,\nwhereas divine moral perfection entails that God is powerless to bring\nabout evil. \nOne can respond to arguments of this kind as follows. Assume that if\nGod exists, then this is a best possible\n world.[8]\n In that case, if God exists, there could not be an evil unless it\nwere necessary for some greater good, in which case any state of\naffairs containing evil incompatible with there being a maximally good\nworld is impossible. But it be may be assumed that it is not\npossible for any agent to bring about an impossible state of\naffairs. Thus, if God exists, any moral evil, that is, any evil\nbrought about by anyone, and any natural evil, or any evil which has\nan impersonal, natural cause, must be necessary for some greater\ngood. \nSuppose that God exists and that some other person, for example, Cain,\nbrings it about that an evil, \\(E\\), exists. There are two\npossibilities that need to be considered here. The first is that\nCain’s decisions and actions are causally determined, as are all\noccurrences in the created universe. Then, given our assumptions,\nsince Cain’s bringing it about that \\(E\\) exists is\nnecessary for some good which more than compensates for\n\\(E\\)’s existence, it is consistent with God’s moral\nperfection that God [remotely] brings it about that Cain brings it\nabout that \\(E\\) exists. \nThe second possibility is that Cain’s decision to do evil is\nuncaused by anything other than Cain and free in the libertarian\nsense. In that case, God did not [remotely cause Cain freely\nto] bring it about that \\(E\\) exists, while [let us assume] Cain\ndid freely bring it about that \\(E\\) exists. If so, then\nit must be the case that God’s creating Cain and permitting Cain\nfreely to do what he chooses to do [in the context of the entire\ncreation] brings about more good than his not creating Cain\nand thus not permitting him freely to do what he chooses to\ndo. It might be objected that if Cain can bring about a state of\naffairs that God cannot, namely, that E exists, then God is\nnot omnipotent. But, as we have seen, an agent’s being\nomnipotent does not require of that agent that it be able to bring\nabout every state of affairs which any other agent\ncan bring about. It does, of course, require that an\nomnipotent agent have more power than any other agent. And God, of\ncourse, would have more power than Cain, even though Cain\ncould bring about something that God could not. For there are many\nmore states of affairs that God could bring about and that Cain could\nnot, than vice versa. At this point, it might further be\nobjected that an omnipotent agent, one that was morally imperfect, who\ncould bring it about that \\(E\\) exists, as well as all\nthe other states of affairs that God could bring about, would be more\npowerful than God. But recall that if God exists, then he exists\neternally in every possible world. Recall, too, that apparently there\ncannot be more than one omnipotent agent. Thus, it appears that if God\nexists, then an omnipotent agent who is morally imperfect is\nimpossible. Thus, this second objection is based on an\nassumption that seems to be impossible, namely, that if God exists\nthere could exist another omnipotent agent who is morally imperfect\nand who is therefore more powerful than God. \nOf course, if God exists, then any evil state of affairs, \\(s\\),\nwhich is incompatible with a maximally good world is\nimpossible. And if \\(s\\) is impossible, then neither God\nnor any other agent has the power to bring it about that \\(s\\)\nobtains. God would lack the power to bring it about that \\(s\\)\nobtains because of his moral perfection, and any created agent would\nlack the power to bring it about that \\(s\\) obtains either\nbecause (i) God would not create an agent who had the power to bring\nit about that \\(s\\) obtains, or (ii) God would not permit any\ncreated agent to bring it about that \\(s\\) obtains. Thus, to the\nextent indicated, if God’s attributes impose moral restrictions\non the nature of the universe and on what he can bring about, then\nthey impose parallel restrictions on what any other agents can bring\nabout. \nThe foregoing line of reasoning implies that God’s moral\nperfection and omnipotence are not\n incompatible.[9] \nThis argument about God and the possibility of evil has been disputed\nby theists such as Alvin Plantinga, who do not hold that God’s\nexistence implies the existence of a maximally good world, but do hold\nthat God seeks to create as good a world as he\n can.[10]\n Theists such as Plantinga allow for there to be evil that is\nunnecessary for any greater good that outweighs it. An evil\nof this kind involves free decisions of non-divine agents, which God\ndoes not prevent, but which these other agents can prevent. Plantinga\ncontends that God is not wrong to permit an evil of this kind, since\nGod cannot bring about a vital good, the existence of free human\nagents, without there being such an evil. Alternatively, it might be\nargued that God does no wrong in this sort of case, because he does\nnot know how to do better (knowledge of the future free actions of\ncreated agents being impossible). However, as an omnipotent God is\nnot required to have power over the free decisions of\nnon-divine agents, it follows that on these views, his omnipotence and\nmoral perfection are compatible, roughly to the extent indicated\nearlier in our discussion of the view that God’s existence\nimplies a maximally good world. Of course, nothing that has been said\nhere answers the question of how much, if any, evil is compatible with\nthe existence of the traditional God. This question is central to the\nproblem of evil for theism.","contact.mail":"j_hoffma@uncg.edu","contact.domain":"uncg.edu"},{"date.published":"2002-05-21","date.changed":"2017-06-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/omnipotence/","author1":"Joshua Hoffman","author2":"Gary Rosenkrantz","entry":"omnipotence","body.text":"\n\n\nOmnipotence is maximal power. Maximal greatness (or perfection)\nincludes omnipotence. According to traditional Western theism, God is\nmaximally great (or perfect), and therefore is omnipotent. Omnipotence\nseems puzzling, even paradoxical, to many philosophers. They wonder,\nfor example, whether God can create a spherical cube, or make a stone\nso massive that he cannot move it. Is there a consistent analysis of\nomnipotence? What are the implications of such an analysis for the\nnature of God?\n\nPhilosophical reflection upon the notion of omnipotence raises many\npuzzling questions about whether or not a consistent notion of\nomnipotence places limitations on the power of an omnipotent agent.\nCould an omnipotent agent create a stone so massive that that agent\ncould not move it? Paradoxically, it appears that however this\nquestion is answered, an omnipotent agent turns out not to be\nall-powerful. Could such an agent have the power to create or overturn\nnecessary truths of logic and mathematics? Could an agent of this kind\nbring about or alter the past? Is the notion of an omnipotent agent\nother than God an intelligible one? Could two omnipotent\nagents coexist? If there are states of affairs that an omnipotent\nagent is powerless to bring about, then how is the notion of\nomnipotence intelligibly to be defined? Moreover, an obstacle to\ntraditional Western theism arises if it is impossible for God to be\nmorally perfect and omnipotent. If an omnipotent God is powerless to\ndo evil, then how can he be omnipotent? Rational theology seeks an\nanalysis of the concept of omnipotence that resolves the puzzles and\napparent paradoxes that surround this concept. If the notion of\nomnipotence were found to be unintelligible, or incompatible with\nmoral perfection, then traditional Western theism would be false. \nAccording to some philosophers, omnipotence should be understood in\nterms of the power to perform certain tasks, for instance, to\nkill oneself, to make \\(2+2=4\\), or to make oneself non-omniscient.\nHowever, in recent philosophical discussion, omnipotence has been\nanalyzed in terms of the power to bring about certain possible\nstates of affairs, understood as propositional entities which\neither obtain or fail to obtain (Rosenkrantz & Hoffman 1980; Flint\n& Freddoso 1983; and Wierenga 1989). Because we believe that it\ncan yield an adequate analysis of omnipotence, we take this latter\napproach in what follows. \nOne sense of ‘omnipotence’ is, literally, that of having\nthe power to bring about any state of affairs whatsoever,\nincluding necessary and impossible states of affairs. Descartes seems\nto have had such a notion (Meditations, Section 1). Yet,\nAquinas and Maimonides held the view that this sense of\n‘omnipotence’ is incoherent. Their view can be defended as\nfollows. It is not possible for an agent to bring about an\nimpossible state of affairs (e.g., that there is a\nshapeless cube), since if it were, it would be possible for an\nimpossible state of affairs to obtain, which is a contradiction (see\nAquinas, Summa Theologiae, Ia, 25, 3; and Maimonides,\nGuide for the Perplexed, Part I, Ch. 15). Nor is it possible\nfor an agent to bring about a necessary state of affairs\n(e.g., that all cubes are shaped). It is possible for an\nagent, \\(a\\), to bring about a necessary state of affairs,\n\\(s\\), only if possibly, (1) \\(a\\) brings about \\(s\\),\nand (2) if \\(a\\) had not acted, then \\(s\\) would have failed\nto obtain. Because a necessary state of affairs obtains whether or not\nanyone acts, (2) is false. As a consequence, it is impossible for an\nagent to bring about either a necessary or an impossible state of\naffairs. Many philosophers accept the principle that if an agent has\nthe power to bring about a state of affairs, then this\nentails that, possibly, the agent brings about that state of\naffairs. If this principle is correct, then the foregoing\nabsolute sense of ‘omnipotence’ is incoherent.\nAmong contemporary philosophers, Earl Conee (1991) rejects this\nprinciple in order to defend the view that an omnipotent being would\nhave the power to bring about any state of affairs whatsoever. \nA second sense of ‘omnipotence’ is that of\nmaximal power, meaning just that no being could\nexceed the overall power of an omnipotent being. It does not follow\nthat a maximally powerful being can bring about any state of\naffairs, since, as observed above, bringing about some such states of\naffairs is impossible. Nor does it follow that a being with maximal\npower can bring about whatever any other agent can bring\nabout. If \\(a\\) can bring about \\(s\\), and \\(b\\)\ncannot, it does not follow that \\(b\\) is not overall\nmore powerful than \\(a\\), since it could be that \\(b\\) can\nbring about more states of affairs than \\(a\\) can, rather than\nthe other way around. For the remainder of this entry the discussion\nconcentrates on this comparative sense of\n‘omnipotence’ as maximal power. Within the context of that\ndiscussion, it will be assumed that it is not possible for an\nagent to have the power to bring about any state of affairs\nwhatsoever. \nThat a being is omnipotent just provided that its overall power is\nnot possibly exceeded by any being may be adopted as the most\ngeneral definition of omnipotence in this sense (Hoffman &\nRosenkrantz 2010). Still, the availability of a more fine-grained and\ninformative analysis, directly applicable to the full range of problem\ncases, is highly desirable. A number of prominent proposals for such a\nmore fine-grained and informative analysis of omnipotence will be\ndiscussed later.  \nPower should be distinguished from ability. Power is\nability plus opportunity: a being which has maximal ability but which\nis prevented by circumstances from exercising those abilities would\nnot be omnipotent. Nothing could prevent an omnipotent agent from\nexercising its powers, if it were to endeavor to do so. \nIn the light of the foregoing, is it possible that there be a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents? Among contemporary\nphilosophers of religion, Richard Swinburne (2008) holds that a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents is possible. \nIf a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents were even possible,\nthen possibly, at a time, \\(t\\), some omnipotent agent,\n\\(x\\), while retaining its omnipotence, endeavors to move a\nfeather, and at \\(t\\), another omnipotent agent, \\(y\\),\nwhile retaining its omnipotence, endeavors to keep that feather\nmotionless. Intuitively, in this case, neither \\(x\\) nor\n\\(y\\) would affect the feather as to its motion or rest. Thus, in\nthis case, at \\(t\\), \\(x\\) would be powerless to move the\nfeather, and at \\(t\\), \\(y\\) would be powerless to keep the\nfeather motionless! But it is absurd to suppose that an omnipotent\nagent could lack the power to move a feather or the power to keep it\nmotionless. Therefore, neither \\(x\\) nor \\(y\\) is\nomnipotent. This line of reasoning appears to reduce the notion of a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents to absurdity. If such a\nreductio ad absurdum is sound, then a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent agents is impossible. \nIt might be replied that while neither of the omnipotent agents in\nquestion brings about what it endeavors to bring about, each of them\ncan do so, since each of them has the ability to do\nso; they fail to bring about what they endeavor to bring about only\nbecause they lack the opportunity to do so. But earlier\nobservations about the difference between power and ability and how\neach of them is related to omnipotence entail that omnipotence should\nbe understood in terms of the ability plus opportunity sense\nof ‘can’. If those earlier observations are correct, then,\nsince neither of the omnipotent agents under discussion can\ndo [in the ability plus opportunity sense] what it endeavors to do,\nthe possible reply under discussion does not succeed. \nOr it might be replied that the possible pair(s) of coexistent\nomnipotent agents would necessarily avoid stalemates of the\nforegoing sort in virtue of the members of each pair resembling one\nanother in some respect. This reply seems suspiciously ad\nhoc. It appears that the members of any possible pair of\ngenetically identical human twins could be stalemated, e.g., in an\narm-wrestling match. Why would not the same be true of a pair of\nsimilar coexistent omnipotent agents? It might be answered that each\nof the members of any possible pair of coexistent omnipotent agents\nwould be necessarily omniscient and necessarily morally perfect.\nMoreover, if two omnipotent agents are necessarily\nomniscient, they won’t disagree about any\nfact, and if they are necessarily morally perfect, they\nwon’t disagree about what is morally required\nor about whether they want so to act. It might then be\ninferred that any states of affairs that a pair of coexistent\nomnipotent agents would endeavor to bring about at a given time are\ncompatible. In the literature, the controversial social\ntrinitarianism of Richard Swinburne (2008), implies that the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are a trio of coexistent\nomnipotent agents each of whom is necessarily omniscient and\nnecessarily morally perfect. \nHowever, one might object to the preceding reply on the grounds that\nif there is a pair of coexistent necessarily omniscient and\nnecessarily morally perfect omnipotent agents, then there is a pair of\nincompatible contingent states of affairs each of which is\nmorally optional for these agents, that is, neither morally\nprohibited nor morally required for them. The objection then proceeds\nas follows. It may be assumed that that the feather moves at\nt and that the feather remains motionless at t are a\npair of states of affairs of the sort in question. Apparently, also,\npossibly, under such circumstances, the state of affairs that the\nomnipotent agents in question are stalemated in their endeavors to\naffect the feather as to its motion or rest at t is morally\noptional for those agents. Analogously, in an arm-wrestling match\nbetween \\(A_1 \\amp A_2\\),\npossibly, the states of affairs that \\(A_1\\) wins\nthe match, that \\(A_2\\) wins the match, and\nthat \\(A_1 \\amp A_2\\) are stalemated in the\nmatch are morally optional for \\(A_1\\) and\n\\(A_2\\). In the light of the foregoing observations, it\nappears that if it is possible that there are omnipotent agents of the\nsort in question, then possibly, one of them endeavors to make the\nfeather move at \\(t\\), while the other endeavors to keep it\nmotionless at \\(t\\), even given their hypothesized necessary\nareas of epistemic and moral agreement. The foregoing defense of\nthe possibility of a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents is\npersuasive only if there is a cogent reply to this objection. \nWould it strengthen such a defense to further require that the\ncoexistent omnipotent agents are necessarily aesthetically\nperfect, and hence, won’t disagree about what\nis aesthetically required or about whether they want so to\nact? It appears not. After all, there appear to be incompatible,\ncontingent, aesthetically optional states of affairs, i.e.,\nstates of affairs which are neither aesthetically required nor\naesthetically prohibited for some agent, and considerations parallel\nto those adduced above apply. Moreover, it is not clear that\nfutile striving necessarily has negative aesthetic\nvalue, witness, e.g., Camus’s The Myth of Sisyphus, and\nin any case, it can be argued plausibly that the equipoise of\nopposing forces possibly has positive aesthetic value,\nimplying that opposed volitional activities of coexistent omnipotent\nbeings would not necessarily be futile. \nFurther doubts about the possibility of a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent beings are raised by considerations outlined below which\nseem to show that if some possible world is maximally good,\nin other words, is a best possible world, then no\npossible world is [uniquely] the best possible world, and\nlikewise with respect to a possible world that is second best, third\nbest, and so on. \nHere it is assumed that if there is a best possible world, then there\nis at least one such possible world containing contingently existing\nindividual substantial individuals. A parallel assumption is made\nabout any possible world good enough to be actualized by an\nomnipotent, omniscient, morally perfect, aesthetically perfect being,\ne.g., by a maximally great divinity such as God. But, with respect to\nany possible world containing contingently existing substantial\nindividuals, it appears that there is another possible world\nexactly resembling it but populated by different\ncontingently existing substantial individuals. It further appears that\nthe value of one of these worlds is equal to the value of another of\nthese worlds. So, it appears that if one of these possible worlds is\nbest, second best, third best, etc., then there is another possible\nworld of the ordinal rank in question. \nMoreover, different possible goods combined in different possible ways\nmay constitute different, logically independent, possible total goods\nof the same value. The following simple example illustrates this\npoint. Let it be assumed that the pleasure which would be produced by\nJohn’s eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight and the\npleasure that would be produced by John’s eating a garlic pizza\nfor dinner tonight are logically independent possible goods of the\nsame value. All other things being equal, a possible world containing\nJohn’s eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight and\nJohn’s not eating a garlic pizza tonight, and a possible world\ncontaining John’s eating a garlic pizza for dinner tonight and\nJohn’s not eating a mushroom pizza for dinner tonight,\nconstitute different possible goods of the same value. Generalizing\nfrom examples of this kind, it appears that if some possible world is\nbest, second best, third best, and so on, then there are\nother possible worlds, not exactly resembling them,\nwhich are best, second best, third best, and so on. \nSo, for any possible pair of coexistent God-like omnipotent agents, it\nappears that one member of that pair could endeavor to\nactualize a different, equally good, world than the other member\nof that pair, even given their hypothesized necessary epistemic,\nmoral, and aesthetic perfection. In the light of the reductio ad\nabsurdum presented earlier, it appears to follow that such pairs\nare impossible. \nLeibniz argued that there is a uniquely optimal possible world by\nappealing to the Principle of Sufficient Reason and the\nIdentity of Indiscernibles, notoriously concluding that the\nactual world is the best of all possible worlds. Among\ncontemporary philosophers, both the Principle of Sufficient\nReason and the Identity of Indiscernibles are\ncontroversial. \nAnother possible defense of the possibility of a plurality of\ncoexistent omnipotent agents appeals to quantum mechanics. Quantum\nentanglement seems to be a unique physical phenomenon whereby\nconcurrent activities of diverse contingently existing substantial\nindividuals are directly coordinated in virtue of a necessary linkage\nof some sort between those substantial individuals. By drawing an\nanalogy with this phenomenon, one might argue that there could be\ncoexistent omnipotent agents who necessarily avoid stalemates. Quantum\nmechanics implies that there exist pairs of entangled micro-particles\nsuch that it is causally necessary that one member of the pair is\nspin up if and only if the other member of the pair is\nspin up, independently of the locations of those\nmicro-particles. Albert Einstein skeptically described the theoretical\nphenomenon of entanglement as “spukhafte Fernwirkung,”\nthat is, as “spooky action at a distance.” Nowadays,\nhowever, entanglement is an experimentally confirmed part of physics.\nArguably, by analogy with entanglement, if a plurality of coexistent\nomnipotent agents is possible, then there could be\n“entangled” omnipotent agents, \\(A_1\\) and\n\\(A_2\\), such that it is metaphysically necessary that\n\\(A_1\\) endeavors to bring about a certain state of\naffairs if and only if \\(A_2\\) endeavors to bring about\nthe same state of affairs. But quantum mechanics further implies that\nthere are entangled pairs of micro-particles such that it is causally\nnecessary that one member of the pair is spin up if and only\nif the other member of the pair is spin down. The properties\nof being spin up and being spin down are contraries.\nThus, if the analogy with quantum entanglement is taken seriously,\nthen by parity of reasoning, one should conclude that if a plurality\nof necessarily cooperating coexistent omnipotent agents is possible,\nthen possibly, there are “entangled” omnipotent\nagents, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), such that\nit is metaphysically necessary that \\(A_1\\) endeavors\nto act in some way if and only if \\(A_2\\) endeavors to\nact in a contrary way. Given this conclusion, and in the\nlight of the reductio ad absurdum of the possibility of a\nplurality of coexistent omnipotent agents presented earlier, an\nargument in favor of such a possibility by analogy with quantum\nentanglement undermines itself, thereby reinforcing that\nreductio. So, one cannot credibly defend the metaphysical\npossibility of a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents by drawing\nan analogy with the phenomenon of quantum entanglement. \nFinally, could one credibly defend such a metaphysical possibility via\nthe hypothesis that it is metaphysically possible for there to be a\nplurality of necessarily indiscernible omnipotent God-like beings (in\nthe Leibnizian sense of indiscernible)? Because a plurality\nof necessarily indiscernible objects is of dubious\nintelligibility, such a defense would not be credible. Doubts about\nthe intelligibility of such a plurality arise because of perplexities\nconcerning the individuation and separation of any pair of necessarily\nindiscernible objects, and because positing the existence of a\nplurality of such objects is metaphysically extravagant and\ngratuitous. Indeed it seems that there is just as much reason to posit\nindefinitely many objects of the sort in question as there is to posit\na pair of them, whereas the intelligibility of a necessarily\nself-indiscernible object is not in doubt. A representative\nexample of a hypothetical plurality of necessarily indiscernible\nobjects is a plurality of necessarily coincident geometrical\npoints. In addition to the perplexities concerning the individuation\nand separation of any pair of such points, the assumption that it is\nmetaphysically possible for there to be a plurality of necessarily\ncoincident points is metaphysically frivolous. Post-Scholastic\nridicule of the sort that was directed at the alleged ontological\nexcesses of the Schoolmen, e.g., the query “How many angels may\nfit upon the point of a needle?”, is quite appropriately\ndirected at metaphysical hypotheses of this sort. For these reasons,\nthe intelligibility of a plurality of necessarily coincident\ngeometrical points is suspect; the same is true of the intelligibility\nof a plurality of necessarily indiscernible omnipotent God-like\nbeings. \nCould an agent be accidentally omnipotent? At first glance, this\nappears possible, but there is the following argument for the opposite\nview. On the assumption that God exists, he has necessary existence,\nis essentially not temporally limited, and is essentially omnipotent.\nBut there could not be two coexistent omnipotent agents. Thus, on the\nassumption that God exists, an accidentally omnipotent being is\nimpossible. \nThis argument against the possibility of accidental omnipotence\npresupposes traditional Western theism. However, traditional Western\ntheism is highly controversial, and neutrality about whether\nGod exists has some advantages. If one is neutral about whether God\nexists, then omnipotence should not be assumed to be\nattributable only to the God of traditional Western theism or\nonly to an essentially omnipotent being. \nThe intelligibility of the notion of omnipotence has been challenged\nby the so-called paradox or riddle of the stone. Can an omnipotent\nagent, Jane, bring it about that there is a stone of some mass, \\(m\\),\nwhich Jane cannot move? If the answer is ‘yes’, then there\nis a state of affairs that Jane cannot bring about, namely,\n(S1) that a stone of mass \\(m\\) moves. On the other hand, if\nthe answer is ‘no’, then there is another state of affairs\nthat Jane cannot bring about, namely, (S2) that there is a stone\nof mass \\(m\\) which Jane cannot move. Thus, it seems that whether\nor not Jane can make the stone in question, there is some possible\nstate of affairs that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about. And this\nappears to be paradoxical. \nA first resolution of the paradox comes into play when Jane is an\nessentially omnipotent agent. In that case, the state of\naffairs of Jane’s being non-omnipotent is impossible. Therefore,\nJane cannot bring it about that she is not omnipotent. Since,\nnecessarily, an omnipotent agent can move any stone, no matter how\nmassive, (S2) is impossible. But, as we have seen, an omnipotent agent\nis not required to be able to bring about an impossible state of\naffairs. \nIf, on the other hand, Jane is an accidentally omnipotent\nagent, both (S1) and (S2) are possible, and it is\npossible for some omnipotent agent to bring it about that (S1) obtains\nat one time, and that (S2) obtains at a different time. Thus,\nthere is a second solution to the paradox. In this case, Jane’s\nbeing non-omnipotent is a possible state of affairs; thus, we may\nassume that it is possible for Jane to bring it about that\nshe is non-omnipotent. So, Jane can create and move a stone,\n\\(s\\), of mass, \\(m\\), while omnipotent, and\nsubsequently bring it about that she is not omnipotent and\npowerless to move \\(s\\). As a consequence, Jane can bring about\nboth (S1) and (S2), but only if they obtain at different times.  \nIt might now be conjectured that omnipotence can be analyzed simply as\nthe power to bring it about that any contingent state of\naffairs obtains. However, the following list of contingent states of\naffairs shows that there can be contingent states of affairs that an\nomnipotent agent is powerless to bring about, and hence that this\nsimple analysis is inadequate: \nNote that (a) is a past state of affairs. Presumably, it is not\npossible for an efficient cause to occur later than its\neffect. However, an agent’s bringing about a state of affairs is\na kind of efficient causation. Therefore, it is not possible for an\nagent to bring about anything that is in the past. In other\nwords, it is impossible for any agent to have power over what\nis past. Hence, no agent, not even an omnipotent one, can bring it\nabout that (a) obtains. Likewise, despite the fact that (b) can be\nbrought about prior to \\(t\\), the impossibility of an\nagent’s having power over what is past implies that after\nt even an omnipotent agent cannot bring it about that (b)\nobtains. In the case of (c), prior to Parmenides’s first\nlecture, an omnipotent agent can bring about (c). But once Parmenides\nhas lectured, even an omnipotent agent cannot bring it about that (c)\nobtains. As for (d), prior to the Amazon’s third flooding, an\nomnipotent agent can bring it about that (d) obtains, while after the\nAmazon’s third flooding, even an omnipotent agent cannot bring\nit about that (d) obtains. (e) introduces a special difficulty.\nAlthough it is obvious that (e) could not be brought about by\nan omnipotent agent, it can be argued plausibly that it is\npossible for a non-omnipotent agent to bring about (e) by causing a\nsnowflake to fall, provided that no omnipotent agent\never\n exists.[1]\n But, as we argued earlier, a maximally powerful being need not have\nthe power to bring about every state of affairs that any other being\ncould. Lastly, while if the libertarian theory of free will is\ncorrect, an omnipotent agent (who is, of course, other than\nPlato) cannot bring about (f), apparently a non-omnipotent agent,\nnamely, Plato, can bring it about that (f) obtains. \nConsequently, a satisfactory analysis of omnipotence ought not to\nrequire that an omnipotent agent have the power to bring about (a),\n(b), (c), (d), (e), or (f), if it is assumed, arguendo, in\nthe case of (f), that libertarianism is true. \nBecause of the wide disparity among contingent states of affairs,\n(a)–(f), one might despair of finding an analysis of omnipotence that\nboth deals satisfactorily with all of these states of affairs and\nimplies that an omnipotent being has, intuitively speaking, sufficient\npower. Is such pessimism warranted, or is omnipotence analyzable? \nThere are at least two approaches to analyzing omnipotence that hold\nout some hope of success. The first utilizes the notion of an\nunrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs, and the second\nutilizes the notion of two worlds sharing their histories up to a\ntime. Although these approaches to analyzing omnipotence differ\nin important ways, they are in broad agreement on the leading idea\nthat maximal power has logical and temporal limitiations, including\nthe limitation that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about, i.e.,\ncause, another agent’s free decision in the libertarian sense.\nIn the following two sections, some recent instances of these\napproaches are set forth and compared. \nOne attempt to analyze omnipotence in terms of unrestricted\nrepeatability is the account of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz. According to\ntheir approach, by identifying certain features of (a)–(f), we\ncan find a feature that none of them possesses, and in terms of which\nan analysis of omnipotence can be stated. To begin, unless it is\npossible for some agent to bring about a given state of\naffairs, an omnipotent agent ought not to be required to be able to\nbring about that state of affairs. But (a) is not possibly brought\nabout by any agent. \nNext, while (b) and (c) are possibly brought about by some agent, they\nare not repeatable: it is not possible for either one of them\nto obtain, subsequently fail to obtain, and then obtain again. Note\nthat if, because (a) is not possibly brought about by someone, an\nomnipotent agent is not required to be able to bring about (a), then\nfor the same reason, that agent is also not required to be able to\nbring about impossible or necessary states of affairs. Moreover, if,\nbecause (b) and (c) are not repeatable, an omnipotent agent is not\nrequired to bring about (b) or (c), then for the same reason, that\nagent is also not required to be able to bring about impossible or\nnecessary states of affairs. These reasons for not requiring an\nomnipotent agent to have the power to bring about impossible or\nnecessary states of affairs cohere with our earlier independent\narguments for these restrictions. \nThird, while (d) is repeatable, it is not\nunrestrictedly repeatable, that is, it cannot obtain, then\nfail to obtain, then obtain again, and so on, eternally. \nFourth, while (e) is unrestrictedly repeatable, it is a\ncomplex state of affairs, namely, a conjunctive\nstate of affairs whose second conjunct is not repeatable.\nThese examples suggest a hypothesis about repeatability and its\nrelation to power, namely, that an omnipotent agent should\nnot be required to have the power to bring about\neither a state of affairs that is not unrestrictedly\nrepeatable, or a conjunctive state of affairs one of whose\nconjuncts is not unrestrictedly repeatable. \nLastly, although (f) is unrestrictedly repeatable, (f) is\nanother type of complex state of affairs. In particular, it is\nidentifiable with or analyzable as a conjunctive state of affairs.\nThis state of affairs has three conjuncts, the second of which is not\npossibly brought about by anyone. The conjunctive state of affairs in\nquestion can be informally expressed as follows: Plato decides to\nwrite a dialogue; and there is no antecedent sufficient\ncausal condition of Plato’s deciding to write a dialogue; and\nthere is no concurrent sufficient causal condition of Plato’s\ndeciding to write a dialogue. Because it is impossible for an agent to\nhave power over what is past, the second conjunct of this\nstate of affairs is not possibly brought about by anyone. Thus, an\nomnipotent agent ought not to be required to have the power to bring\nabout a state of affairs that is identifiable with or analyzable as a\nconjunctive state of affairs one of whose conjuncts is not possibly\nbrought about by anyone. \nAccording to the account of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz, incoporating\nthese ideas, omnipotence can be analyzed in terms of the following\nthree definitions. \nFor example, any period of time with a duration of 7 seconds is a\nsufficient interval for the state of affairs that a ball rolls for\n7 seconds. \nFor instance, the state of affairs that a ball rolls for 7\nseconds is unrestrictedly repeatable. \nIn (D3), \\(x\\) ranges over agents, and \\(s\\) over\nstates of affairs that satisfy the following condition: \nIn applying (D3) to states of affairs like (e) and (f) it\nshould be observed that a conjunct of a conjunctive state of\naffairs is a part of such a complex state of\n affairs.[4] \nAs intended, (D3) does not require an omnipotent agent to have\nthe power to bring about either impossible or necessary states of\naffairs, or states of affairs such as (a)–(f). Furthermore,\n(D3) does not unduly limit the power of an omnipotent agent,\nsince an agent’s bringing about a state of affairs can always be\n“cashed out” in terms of that agent’s bringing about\nan unrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs that it is possible for\nsome agent to bring about. That is, necessarily, for any state of\naffairs, \\(s\\), if an agent, \\(a\\), brings about \\(s\\),\nthen either \\(s\\) is an unrestrictedly repeatable state of\naffairs which it is possible for some agent to bring about, or else\n\\(a\\) brings about \\(s by\\) bringing about\n\\(q\\), where \\(q\\) is an unrestrictedly repeatable state of\naffairs which it is possible for some agent to bring about. For\ninstance, an omnipotent agent can bring about the state of affairs,\nthat in one hour, Parmenides lectures for the first time, by\nbringing about the state of affairs, that in one\nhour, Parmenides lectures, when this lecture is\nParmenides’s first. And although the former state of affairs is\na nonrepeatable one that (D3) does not require an\nomnipotent agent to be able to bring about, the latter state of\naffairs is an unrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs that\n(D3) does require an omnipotent agent to be able to\nbring about. \nThe alternative approach to analyzing omnipotence in terms of two\nworlds sharing their histories up to a time is exemplified by the\naccounts of Flint and Freddoso, and Wierenga. As we shall see,\nalthough these two accounts are similar, they differ in certain\nsignificant respects. \nFlint and Freddoso’s account of what it is for an agent\n\\(S\\) at a time \\(t\\) to be omnipotent in a possible world\n\\(W\\) is formulated as follows. \n\\(S\\) is omnipotent at \\(t\\) in \\(W\\) if and only if for any state of\naffairs \\(p\\) and world-type-for-\\(S\\) \\(Ls\\) such that \\(p\\) is not a\nmember of \\(Ls\\), if there is a world \\(W^*\\) such that  \nThe notion of a world-type-for-\\(S\\) \\(Ls\\) is to be\nunderstood in the following way. A world-type is “a set\nwhich is such that for any counterfactual of freedom, i.e.,\nany proposition which can be expressed by a sentence of the form\n‘If individual essence \\(P\\) were instantiated in\ncircumstances \\(C\\) at time \\(t\\) and its instantiation were\nleft free with respect to action \\(A\\), the instantiation of\n\\(P\\) would freely do \\(A\\)’—either that\ncounterfactual or its negation is a member of the set” (Flint\n& Freddoso 1983, p. 96). It may also be stipulated “that for\nany two members of the set, the conjunction of those two members is a\nmember of the set as well” (Flint & Freddoso 1983, pp.\n96–97). Moreover, “a world-type is true just in\ncase every proposition which is a member of it is true” (Flint\n& Freddoso 1983, p. 97). In addition, it is presupposed that\n“for any free agent \\(x\\), there will be a set of all and\nonly those true counterfactuals of freedom (or true negations of such\ncounterfactuals) over whose truth-value \\(x\\) has no\ncontrol” (Flint & Freddoso 1983, p. 97). A set of this kind\nis referred to as the world-type-for-x. Finally,\n‘\\(Lx\\)’ designates the\ntrue-world-type-for-\\(x\\). \nThe notion of actualization employed in this account of omnipotence\ncalls for some explanation. If an agent, \\(S\\), brings about a\nstate of affairs, \\(p\\), then \\(S\\) actualizes \\(p\\).\nHowever, this account presupposes that an agent may [weakly]\nactualize another agent’s making a free decision\nwithout bringing about or causing that decision. In\nparticular, it is assumed that an agent may weakly actualize a\ndecision that is free in the libertarian sense by bringing about the\nantecedent of a true “counterfactual of freedom.” \nThe basic idea of this account of omnipotence is that an agent is\nomnipotent just when he can actualize any state of affairs that it is\npossible for someone to actualize, except for certain\n“counterfactuals of freedom”, their consequents, and\ncertain states of affairs that are “accidentally\nimpossible” because of the past. \nWith respect to so-called counterfactuals of freedom, this account\npresupposes that some of them, for example, \nIf Jessica were offered the grant, then she would freely decide to\naccept it,\n \nare true. Some philosophers hold the contrary view that a\nsubjunctive conditional of this kind is necessarily\nfalse. Why do these philosophers reject the claim that some\n“counterfactuals of freedom” are true? Presumably, what\ndistinguishes a subjunctive conditional from a corresponding material\nconditional is that only the former expresses a strong or necessary\nconnection of some sort between the conditions specified by the\nantecedent and the consequent. Seemingly, the only kinds of strong or\nnecessary connections available in this case are relations [broadly\nspeaking] of either causation or entailment.\nConsequently, it appears that the subjunctive conditional under\ndiscussion is necessarily false, since if Jessica freely\ndecides to accept the grant [in the relevant libertarian sense], then\nher making that decision is neither caused nor\nentailed by her being offered the grant. If the foregoing\nline of reasoning is correct, then the notion of a true\n“counterfactual of freedom” is incoherent. Since Flint and\nFreddoso’s account of omnipotence presupposes that there are\nsuch “counterfactuals of freedom,” it can be argued that\nthis account is incoherent. \nMoreover, it can be argued that a state of affairs discussed earlier\nprovides a counter-example to Flint and Freddoso’s account of\nomnipotence, namely: \nA non-omnipotent agent can bring about or actualize (e) by bringing it\nabout that a snowflake falls when in fact no omnipotent agent ever\nexists. But, it is clear that an omnipotent agent cannot bring about\nor actualize (e). For although an omnipotent agent can bring it about\nthat a snowflake falls, surely, an omnipotent agent cannot bring it\nabout that no omnipotent ever exists, nor would this conjunct\nof (e) obtain if there were an omnipotent agent. Moreover, we may\nassume that there are possible worlds, \\(W\\) and \\(W^*\\),\nsuch that \\(W\\) and \\(W^*\\) share the same history up to a\ntime \\(t\\), no omnipotent agent ever exists in \\(W^*\\), and a\ncontingently omnipotent agent, Oscar, is omnipotent for the first time\nat \\(t\\) in \\(W\\). We may also assume that \\(W^*\\) is a\nworld in which at \\(t\\) some non-omnipotent agent actualizes (e).\nOn the other hand, evidently, if in \\(W\\), Oscar is omnipotent at\n\\(t\\), then at \\(t\\) Oscar cannot actualize (e). Note that\nsince the second conjunct of (e) is not unrestrictedly repeatable,\nthis is consistent with Hoffman and Rosenkrantz’s account of\nomnipotence; their account does not require an omnipotent agent to be\nable to bring about a conjunctive state of affairs one of whose\nconjuncts is not unrestrictedly repeatable. On the other hand, Flint\nand Freddoso’s account of omnipotence implies that in\n\\(W\\), at \\(t\\) Oscar has the power to actualize (e). This\nimplication holds for the following reasons. First, (e) is not a\nmember of a world-type-for-Oscar, inasmuch as (e) is neither a\n“counterfactual of freedom,” the negation of one, nor a\nconjunction of such “counterfactuals of freedom.” Second,\nwe may assume that a world-type-for-Oscar is true in both \\(W^*\\)\nand \\(W\\), since the assumption that an agent is not omnipotent\nin one possible world, and is omnipotent for a time in another\npossible world, does not necessitate any difference in the world-type\nfor that agent which is true in those worlds. Third, it is possible\nfor someone at \\(t\\) to actualize (e) in a world, \\(W^*\\),\nthat has the same history up to \\(t\\) as\n \\(W\\).[5]\n Thus, arguably, Flint and Freddoso’s account of omnipotence\nrequires that in \\(W\\) an omnipotent agent, Oscar, at \\(t\\)\nhas the power to actualize (e), when Oscar lacks this power. If this\nis right, then their account does not provide a logically necessary\ncondition on\n omnipotence.[6] \nA counter-example of this kind assumes that an analysis of omnipotence\nshould allow for the possibility of an omnipotent agent other than\nGod. Given this assumption, (e) seems to provide a counter-example to\nFlint and Freddoso’s account of omnipotence, but not to the\naccount of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz. \nLet us now turn to Wierenga’s account of omnipotence. The basic\nidea of Wierenga’s account of omnipotence is that an agent is\nomnipotent if and only if he can do anything that it is possible for\nhim to do, given the past. According to this account, we can analyze\nwhat it is for an agent, \\(A\\), to be omnipotent at \\(t\\) in\na world \\(W\\) in terms of what it is possible for A to\nstrongly actualize at \\(t\\) in worlds having the same history as\n\\(W\\) up to \\(t\\). \nWierenga’s account of omnipotence, like Flint and\nFreddoso’s, relies on the intuitive idea that two possible\nworlds can share the same past or history up to a certain point in\ntime, and then diverge. According to Wierenga’s account, two\nworlds of this kind share an initial segment, where\n\\(S (W, t)\\) is an initial segment of a\npossible world \\(W\\) up to a time \\(t\\) (Wierenga 1989, pp.\n18–20). Unlike Flint and Freddoso’s account,\nWierenga’s account is not stated in terms of what an agent can\nactualize, but rather in terms of the narrower notion of what an agent\ncan strongly actualize. An agent, \\(A\\), strongly\nactualizes just those states of affairs that \\(A\\) brings about\ndirectly or those actions that \\(A\\) does not do\nby doing something else (Wierenga 1989, pp. 20–23). Of\ncourse, an agent may actualize a state of affairs indirectly\nby strongly actualizing another state of affairs.\nWierenga’s account of omnipotence is formulated as follows. \nThis account of omnipotence may be vulnerable to a counter-example of\nthe following kind. Arguably, there could be an agent, \\(x\\),\nsuch that: \\(x\\) has a wide range of powers, \\(x\\) is\nessentially limited to these powers, and \\(x\\) essentially lacks\na power, \\(P\\), which an omnipotent agent ought to possess. Of\ncourse, \\(x\\) would not be omnipotent. Yet, Wierenga’s\naccount of omnipotence paradoxically implies that \\(x\\) would be\nomnipotent. Hence, it can be argued that Wierenga’s account does\nnot provide a logically sufficient condition for omnipotence. The\nassumption that there could be a non-omnipotent agent that is\nessentially limited in its powers can be defended as follows. An\nomnipotent agent has the power to overrule (or supersede) any law of\nnature (a mere physical necessity). For example, God\nhas the power to overrule the law of gravity by bringing it about that\na mountain floats in midair without any physical cause. Yet, arguably,\nit is possible for there to be a non-omnipotent agent who essentially\nlacks the power to overrule any law of nature. For example, it can be\nargued that there could be a physical or material agent who is\nessentially subject to certain laws of nature. Surely, such\nan agent would lack the power to overrule any law of nature, and so\nwould not be omnipotent. \nA similar, though weaker, sort of objection concerns McEar, a\nhypothetical agent who essentially has the power to do only\none thing, namely, scratch his ear. It may be objected that\nWierenga’s analysis of omnipotence falsely implies that McEar\nwould be omnipotent. But it might be replied that an agent such as\nMcEar is impossible. It can be cogently argued that, necessarily, if\nMcEar has the power to scratch his ear, then he also has the\npower to move a part of his body to scratch his ear, for instance, his\narm (Wierenga 1989, pp. 28–29). So, it appears that there could\nnot be an agent that has the power to do only one thing. In reply to\nthe stronger sort of objection discussed earlier, it may be suggested\nthat, necessarily, for any power, if an agent lacks that\npower, then an omnipotent being could give that agent that power\n(Wierenga 1989, p. 29). The difficulty with such a reply is that there\ncould be a non-omnipotent agent who essentially lacks the\npower to overrule any law of nature, and hence that not even an\nomnipotent agent could give this non-omnipotent agent that power. \nIt has been argued that the traditional God has incompatible\nattributes, namely, necessary existence, essential omnipotence,\nessential omniscience, and essential moral perfection (Pike\n 1969).[7]\n The contention has been that it is impossible for God to have the\npower to bring about evil, while non-omnipotent (and morally\nimperfect) beings may have this power. The precise form of such an\nargument varies depending on what precisely the relation between God\nand evil is assumed to be. However, generally speaking, it is argued\nthat divine moral perfection and omnipotence are incompatible because\ndivine omnipotence entails that God has the power to bring about evil,\nwhereas divine moral perfection entails that God is powerless to bring\nabout evil. \nOne can respond to arguments of this kind as follows. Assume that if\nGod exists, then this is a best possible\n world.[8]\n In that case, if God exists, there could not be an evil unless it\nwere necessary for some greater good, in which case any state of\naffairs containing evil incompatible with there being a maximally good\nworld is impossible. But it be may be assumed that it is not\npossible for any agent to bring about an impossible state of\naffairs. Thus, if God exists, any moral evil, that is, any evil\nbrought about by anyone, and any natural evil, or any evil which has\nan impersonal, natural cause, must be necessary for some greater\ngood. \nSuppose that God exists and that some other person, for example, Cain,\nbrings it about that an evil, \\(E\\), exists. There are two\npossibilities that need to be considered here. The first is that\nCain’s decisions and actions are causally determined, as are all\noccurrences in the created universe. Then, given our assumptions,\nsince Cain’s bringing it about that \\(E\\) exists is\nnecessary for some good which more than compensates for\n\\(E\\)’s existence, it is consistent with God’s moral\nperfection that God [remotely] brings it about that Cain brings it\nabout that \\(E\\) exists. \nThe second possibility is that Cain’s decision to do evil is\nuncaused by anything other than Cain and free in the libertarian\nsense. In that case, God did not [remotely cause Cain freely\nto] bring it about that \\(E\\) exists, while [let us assume] Cain\ndid freely bring it about that \\(E\\) exists. If so, then\nit must be the case that God’s creating Cain and permitting Cain\nfreely to do what he chooses to do [in the context of the entire\ncreation] brings about more good than his not creating Cain\nand thus not permitting him freely to do what he chooses to\ndo. It might be objected that if Cain can bring about a state of\naffairs that God cannot, namely, that E exists, then God is\nnot omnipotent. But, as we have seen, an agent’s being\nomnipotent does not require of that agent that it be able to bring\nabout every state of affairs which any other agent\ncan bring about. It does, of course, require that an\nomnipotent agent have more power than any other agent. And God, of\ncourse, would have more power than Cain, even though Cain\ncould bring about something that God could not. For there are many\nmore states of affairs that God could bring about and that Cain could\nnot, than vice versa. At this point, it might further be\nobjected that an omnipotent agent, one that was morally imperfect, who\ncould bring it about that \\(E\\) exists, as well as all\nthe other states of affairs that God could bring about, would be more\npowerful than God. But recall that if God exists, then he exists\neternally in every possible world. Recall, too, that apparently there\ncannot be more than one omnipotent agent. Thus, it appears that if God\nexists, then an omnipotent agent who is morally imperfect is\nimpossible. Thus, this second objection is based on an\nassumption that seems to be impossible, namely, that if God exists\nthere could exist another omnipotent agent who is morally imperfect\nand who is therefore more powerful than God. \nOf course, if God exists, then any evil state of affairs, \\(s\\),\nwhich is incompatible with a maximally good world is\nimpossible. And if \\(s\\) is impossible, then neither God\nnor any other agent has the power to bring it about that \\(s\\)\nobtains. God would lack the power to bring it about that \\(s\\)\nobtains because of his moral perfection, and any created agent would\nlack the power to bring it about that \\(s\\) obtains either\nbecause (i) God would not create an agent who had the power to bring\nit about that \\(s\\) obtains, or (ii) God would not permit any\ncreated agent to bring it about that \\(s\\) obtains. Thus, to the\nextent indicated, if God’s attributes impose moral restrictions\non the nature of the universe and on what he can bring about, then\nthey impose parallel restrictions on what any other agents can bring\nabout. \nThe foregoing line of reasoning implies that God’s moral\nperfection and omnipotence are not\n incompatible.[9] \nThis argument about God and the possibility of evil has been disputed\nby theists such as Alvin Plantinga, who do not hold that God’s\nexistence implies the existence of a maximally good world, but do hold\nthat God seeks to create as good a world as he\n can.[10]\n Theists such as Plantinga allow for there to be evil that is\nunnecessary for any greater good that outweighs it. An evil\nof this kind involves free decisions of non-divine agents, which God\ndoes not prevent, but which these other agents can prevent. Plantinga\ncontends that God is not wrong to permit an evil of this kind, since\nGod cannot bring about a vital good, the existence of free human\nagents, without there being such an evil. Alternatively, it might be\nargued that God does no wrong in this sort of case, because he does\nnot know how to do better (knowledge of the future free actions of\ncreated agents being impossible). However, as an omnipotent God is\nnot required to have power over the free decisions of\nnon-divine agents, it follows that on these views, his omnipotence and\nmoral perfection are compatible, roughly to the extent indicated\nearlier in our discussion of the view that God’s existence\nimplies a maximally good world. Of course, nothing that has been said\nhere answers the question of how much, if any, evil is compatible with\nthe existence of the traditional God. This question is central to the\nproblem of evil for theism.","contact.mail":"g_rosenk@uncg.edu","contact.domain":"uncg.edu"}]
