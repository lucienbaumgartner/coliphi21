The behavior, in particular,\nof individual organisms.  Not of social groups.  Not of cultures. But\nof persons and animals. \n\n\n\nIn this entry I consider different types of behaviorism. I outline\nreasons for and against being a behaviorist. I consider contributions\nof behaviorism to the study of behavior. Special attention is given to\nthe so-called “radical behaviorism” of B. F. Skinner\n(1904–90). Skinner is given special (not exclusive) attention\nbecause he is the behaviorist who has received the most attention from\nphilosophers, fellow scientists and the public at large. General\nlessons can also be learned from Skinner about the conduct of\nbehavioral science in general.  The entry describes those lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne has to be careful with “ism” words. They often have both loose and\nstrict meanings.  And sometimes multiple meanings of each\ntype. ‘Behaviorism’ is no exception.  Loosely speaking,\nbehaviorism is an attitude – a way of conceiving of empirical\nconstraints on psychological state attribution.  Strictly speaking,\nbehaviorism is a doctrine – a way of doing psychological or\nbehavioral science itself. \n\nWilfred Sellars (1912–89), the distinguished philosopher, noted\nthat a person may qualify as a behaviorist, loosely or attitudinally\nspeaking, if they insist on confirming “hypotheses about\npsychological events in terms of behavioral criteria” (1963,\np. 22).  A behaviorist, so understood, is someone who demands\nbehavioral evidence for any psychological hypothesis.  For such a\nperson, there is no knowable difference between two states of mind\n(beliefs, desires, etc.) unless there is a demonstrable difference in\nthe behavior associated with each state.  Consider the current belief\nof a person that it is raining. If there is no difference in his or\nher behavior between believing that it is raining and believing that\nit is not raining, there is no grounds for attributing the one belief\nrather than the other.  The attribution is empirically empty or\nunconstrained.  \n\nArguably, there is nothing truly exciting about behaviorism loosely\nunderstood. It enthrones behavioral evidence, an arguably inescapable\npremise not just in psychological science but in ordinary discourse\nabout mind and behavior. Just how behavioral evidence should be\n‘enthroned’ (especially in science) may be debated. But enthronement\nitself is not in question. \nNot so behaviorism the doctrine. It has been widely and vigorously\ndebated.  This entry is about the doctrine, not the attitude.\nBehaviorism, the doctrine, has caused considerable excitation among\nboth advocates and critics.  In a manner of speaking, it is a\ndoctrine, or family of doctrines, about how to enthrone behavior not\njust in the science of psychology but in the metaphysics of human and\nanimal behavior. \n\nBehaviorism, the doctrine, is committed in its fullest and most\ncomplete sense to the truth of the following three sets of claims. \n\nThe three sets of claims are logically distinct. Moreover, taken\nindependently, each helps to form a type of\nbehaviorism. “Methodological” behaviorism is committed to\nthe truth of (1). “Psychological” behaviorism is committed\nto the truth of (2). “Analytical” behaviorism (also known\nas “philosophical” or “logical” behaviorism)\nis committed to the truth of the sub-statement in (3) that mental\nterms or concepts can and should be translated into behavioral\nconcepts. \n\nOther nomenclature is sometimes used to classify behaviorisms.\nGeorges Rey (1997, p. 96), for example, classifies behaviorisms as\nmethodological, analytical, and radical, where “radical”\nis Rey’s term for what I am classifying as psychological\nbehaviorism. I reserve the term “radical” for the\npsychological behaviorism of B. F. Skinner.  Skinner employs the\nexpression “radical behaviorism” to describe his brand of\nbehaviorism or his philosophy of behaviorism (see Skinner 1974,\np. 18). In the classification scheme used in this entry, radical\nbehaviorism is a sub-type of psychological behaviorism, primarily,\nalthough it combines all three types of behaviorism (methodological,\nanalytical, and psychological). \n\nMethodological behaviorism is a normative theory about the scientific\nconduct of psychology. It claims that psychology should concern itself\nwith the behavior of organisms (human and nonhuman\nanimals). Psychology should not concern itself with mental states or\nevents or with constructing internal information processing accounts\nof behavior.  According to methodological behaviorism, reference to\nmental states, such as an animal’s beliefs or desires, adds nothing to\nwhat psychology can and should understand about the sources of\nbehavior.  Mental states are private entities which, given the\nnecessary publicity of science, do not form proper objects of\nempirical study.  Methodological behaviorism is a dominant theme in\nthe writings of John Watson (1878–1958). \n\nPsychological behaviorism is a research program within psychology.  It\npurports to explain human and animal behavior in terms of external\nphysical stimuli, responses, learning histories, and (for certain\ntypes of behavior) reinforcements. Psychological behaviorism is\npresent in the work of Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936), Edward Thorndike\n(1874–1949), as well as Watson. Its fullest and most influential\nexpression is B. F.  Skinner’s work on schedules of\nreinforcement. \n\nTo illustrate, consider a hungry rat in an experimental\nchamber. If a particular movement, such as pressing a lever when a\nlight is on, is followed by the presentation of food, then the\nlikelihood of the rat’s pressing the lever when hungry, again, and the\nlight is on, is increased. Such presentations are reinforcements, such\nlights are (discriminative) stimuli, such lever pressings are\nresponses, and such trials or associations are learning histories. \n\nAnalytical or logical behaviorism is a theory within philosophy about\nthe meaning or semantics of mental terms or concepts. It says that the\nvery idea of a mental state or condition is the idea of a behavioral\ndisposition or family of behavioral tendencies, evident in how a\nperson behaves in one situation rather than another. When we attribute\na belief, for example, to someone, we are not saying that he or she is\nin a particular internal state or condition. Instead, we are\ncharacterizing the person in terms of what he or she might do in\nparticular situations or environmental interactions. Analytical\nbehaviorism may be found in the work of Gilbert Ryle (1900–76) and the\nlater work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–51) (if perhaps not without\ncontroversy in interpretation, in Wittgenstein’s case).  More\nrecently, the philosopher-psychologist U. T. Place (1924-2000)\nadvocated a brand of analytical behaviorism restricted to intentional\nor representational states of mind, such as beliefs, which Place took\nto constitute a type, although not the only type, of mentality (see\nGraham and Valentine 2004). Arguably, a version of analytical or\nlogical behaviorism may also be found in the work of Daniel Dennett on\nthe ascription of states of consciousness via a method he calls\n‘heterophenomenology’ (Dennett 2005, pp. 25–56). (See also\nMelser 2004.)  \n\nEach of methodological, psychological, and analytical behaviorism has\nhistorical foundations. Analytical behaviorism traces its historical\nroots to the philosophical movement known as Logical Positivism (see\nSmith 1986). Logical positivism proposes that the meaning of\nstatements used in science must be understood in terms of experimental\nconditions or observations that verify their truth. This positivist\ndoctrine is known as “verificationism.” In psychology,\nverificationism underpins or grounds analytical behaviorism, namely,\nthe claim that mental concepts refer to behavioral tendencies and so\nmust be translated into behavioral terms. \n\nAnalytical behaviorism helps to avoid a metaphysical position known as substance dualism. Substance\ndualism is the doctrine that mental states take place in a special,\nnon-physical mental substance (the immaterial mind). By contrast, for\nanalytical behaviorism, the belief that I have as I arrive on time for\na 2pm dental appointment, namely, that I have a 2pm appointment, is\nnot the property of a mental substance. Believing is a family of\ntendencies of my body.  In addition, for an analytical behaviorist, we\ncannot identify the belief about my arrival independently of that\narrival or other members of this family of tendencies. So, we also\ncannot treat it as the cause of the arrival.  Cause and effect are, as\nHume taught, conceptually distinct existences.  Believing that I have\na 2pm appointment is not distinct from my arrival and so cannot be part\nof the causal foundations of arrival. \n\nPsychological behaviorism’s historical roots consist, in part, in the\nclassical associationism of the British Empiricists, foremost John\nLocke (1632–1704) and David Hume (1711–76). According to classical\nassociationism, intelligent behavior is the product of associative\nlearning. As a result of associations or pairings between perceptual\nexperiences or stimulations on the one hand, and ideas or thoughts on\nthe other, persons and animals acquire knowledge of their environment\nand how to act. Associations enable creatures to discover the causal\nstructure of the world. Association is most helpfully viewed as the\nacquisition of knowledge about relations between events. Intelligence\nin behavior is a mark of such knowledge. \n\nClassical associationism relied on introspectible entities, such as\nperceptual experiences or stimulations as the first links in\nassociations, and thoughts or ideas as the second links. Psychological\nbehaviorism, motivated by experimental interests, claims that to\nunderstand the origins of behavior, reference to stimulations\n(experiences) should be replaced by reference to stimuli (physical\nevents in the environment), and that reference to thoughts or ideas\nshould be eliminated or displaced in favor of reference to responses\n(overt behavior, motor movement). Psychological behaviorism is associationism without\nappeal to inner mental events. \n\nDon’t human beings talk of introspectible entities, thoughts,\nfeelings, and so on, even if these are not recognized by behaviorism\nor best understood as behavioral tendencies? Psychological\nbehaviorists regard the practice of talking about one’s own states of\nmind, and of introspectively reporting those states, as potentially\nuseful data in psychological experiments, but as not presupposing the\nmetaphysical subjectivity or non-physical presence of those\nstates. There are different sorts of causes behind introspective\nreports, and psychological behaviorists take these and other elements\nof introspection to be amenable to behavioral analysis.  (For\nadditional discussion, see Section 5 of this entry). (See, for\ncomparison, Dennett’s method of heterophenomenology; Dennett 1991,\npp. 72–81) \n\nThe task of psychological behaviorism is to specify types of\nassociation, understand how environmental events control behavior,\ndiscover and elucidate causal regularities or laws or functional\nrelations which govern the formation of associations, and predict how\nbehavior will change as the environment changes. The word\n“conditioning” is commonly used to specify the process\ninvolved in acquiring new associations. Animals in so-called\n“operant” conditioning experiments are not learning to,\nfor example, press levers. Instead, they are learning about the\nrelationship between events in their environment, for example, that a\nparticular behavior, pressing the lever in the presences of a light, causes food to appear. \n\nIn its historical foundations, methodological behaviorism shares with\nanalytical behaviorism the influence of positivism. One of the main\ngoals of positivism was to unify psychology with natural science.\nWatson wrote that “psychology as a behaviorist views it is a\npurely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its\ntheoretical goal is … prediction and control” (1913,\np. 158). Watson also wrote of the purpose of psychology as follows:\n“To predict, given the stimulus, what reaction will take place;\nor, given the reaction, state what the situation or stimulus is that\nhas caused the reaction” (1930, p.  11). \n\nThough logically distinct, methodological, psychological, and\nanalytical behaviorisms are sometimes found in one behaviorism. Skinner’s\nradical behaviorism combines all three forms of behaviorism. It\nfollows analytical strictures (at least loosely) in paraphrasing\nmental terms behaviorally, when or if they cannot be eliminated from\nexplanatory discourse. In Verbal Behavior (1957) and elsewhere,\nSkinner tries to show how mental terms can be given behavioral\ninterpretations. In About Behaviorism (1974) he says that when mental\nterminology cannot be eliminated it can be “translated into\nbehavior” (p. 18, Skinner brackets the expression with his own\ndouble quotes). \n\nRadical behaviorism is concerned with the behavior of organisms, not\nwith internal processing (if treated or described differently from overt behavior). So, it is a form of methodological\nbehaviorism. Finally, radical behaviorism understands behavior as a\nreflection of frequency effects among stimuli, which means that it is\na form of psychological behaviorism. \n\nBehaviorism of one sort or another was an immensely popular research\nprogram or methodological commitment among students of behavior from\nabout the third decade of the twentieth century through its middle\ndecades, at least until the beginnings of the cognitive science\nrevolution.  Cognitive science began to mature roughly from 1960 until 1985 (see Bechtel, Abrahamsen, and Graham, 1998, pp. 15–17). In\naddition to Ryle and Wittgenstein, philosophers with sympathies for\nbehaviorism included Carnap (1932–33), Hempel (1949), and Quine\n(1960). Quine, for example, took a behaviorist approach to the study\nof language. Quine claimed that the notion of psychological or mental\nactivity has no place in a scientific account of either the origins or\nthe meaning of speech. To talk in a scientifically disciplined manner\nabout the meaning of an utterance is to talk about stimuli for the\nutterance, its so-called “stimulus meaning”. Hempel (1949)\nclaimed that “all psychological statements that are meaningful\n… are translatable into statements that do not involve\npsychological concepts,” but only concepts for physical behavior\n(p. 18). \n\nAmong psychologists behaviorism was even more popular than among\nphilosophers. In addition to Pavlov, Skinner, Thorndike, and Watson,\nthe list of behaviorists among psychologists included, among others,\nE.  C. Tolman (1886–1959), C. L. Hull (1884–52), and\nE. R. Guthrie (1886–1959). Tolman, for example, wrote that\n“everything important in psychology … can be investigated\nin essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis\nof the determiners of rat behavior at a choice point in a maze”\n(1938, p. 34). \n\nBehaviorists created journals, organized societies, and founded\npsychology graduate programs reflective of behaviorism. Behaviorists\norganized themselves into different types of research clusters, whose\ndifferences stemmed from such factors as varying approaches to\nconditioning and experimentation. Some clusters were named as follows:\n“the experimental analysis of behavior”, “behavior\nanalysis”, “functional analysis”, and, of course,\n“radical behaviorism”. These labels sometimes were\nresponsible for the titles of behaviorism’s leading societies and\njournals, including the Society for the Advancement of Behavior\nAnalysis (SABA), and the Journal of\nthe Experimental Analysis of Behavior (begun in 1958) as well as the\nJournal of Applied Behavior Analysis (begun in 1968). \n\nBehaviorism generated a type of therapy, known as behavior therapy\n(see Rimm and Masters 1974; Erwin 1978). It developed behavior\nmanagement techniques for autistic children (see Lovaas and Newsom\n1976) and token economies for the management of chronic schizophrenics\n(see Stahl and Leitenberg 1976). It fueled discussions of how best to\nunderstand the behavior of nonhuman animals and of the relevance of\nlaboratory study to the natural environmental occurrence of animal behavior (see\nSchwartz and Lacey 1982). \n\nBehaviorism stumbled upon various critical difficulties with some of\nits commitments. One difficulty is confusion about the effects of\nreinforcement on behavior (see Gallistel 1990). In its original sense,\na stimulus such as food is a reinforcer only if its presentation\nincreases the frequency of a response in a type of associative\nconditioning known as operant conditioning. A problem with this\ndefinition is that it defines reinforcers as stimuli that change\nbehavior. The presentation of food, however, may have no observable\neffect on response frequency with respect to food even in cases in\nwhich an animal is food deprived or hungry. Rather, response frequency can be\nassociated with an animal’s ability to identify and remember temporal\nor spatial properties of the circumstances in which a stimulus (say,\nfood) is presented. This and other difficulties prompted changes in\nbehaviorism’s commitments and new directions of research. One\nalternative direction has been the study of the role of short term\nmemory in contributing to reinforcement effects on the so-called\ntrajectory of behavior (see Killeen 1994). \n\nAnother stumbling block, in the case of analytical behaviorism, is the\nfact that the behavioral sentences that are intended to offer the\nbehavioral paraphrases of mental terms almost always use mental terms\nthemselves (see Chisholm 1957). In the example of my belief that I\nhave a 2pm dental appointment, one must also speak of my desire to\narrive at 2pm, otherwise the behavior of arriving at 2pm could not\ncount as believing that I have a 2pm appointment. The term\n“desire” is a mental term. Critics of analytical behaviorism have charged that we\ncan never escape from using mental terms in the characterization of\nthe meaning of mental terms. This suggests that mental discourse\ncannot be displaced by behavioral discourse. At least it cannot be\ndisplaced term-by-term. Perhaps analytical behaviorists need to\nparaphrase a whole swarm of mental terms at once so as to recognize\nthe presumption that the attribution of any one such mental term\npresupposes the application of others (see Rey 1997, p. 154–5).  Why would anyone be a behaviorist? There are three main reasons\n(see also Zuriff 1985). \n\nThe first reason is epistemic or evidential. Warrant or evidence for\nsaying, at least in the third person case, that an animal or person is\nin a certain mental state, for example, possesses a certain belief, is\ngrounded in behavior, understood as observable behavior. Moreover, the\nconceptual space or step between the claim that behavior warrants the\nattribution of belief and the claim that believing consists in\nbehavior itself is a short and in some ways appealing step. If we\nlook, for example, at how people are taught to use mental concepts and\nterms—terms like “believe”, “desire”,\nand so on—conditions of use appear inseparably connected with\nbehavioral tendencies in certain circumstances.  If mental state\nattribution bears a special connection with behavior, it is tempting\nto say that mentality just consists in behavioral tendencies. \n\nThe second reason can be expressed as follows: One major difference\nbetween mentalistic (mental states in-the-head) and associationist or\nconditioning accounts of behavior is that mentalistic accounts tend to\nhave a strong nativist bent. This is true even though there may be\nnothing inherently nativist about mentalistic accounts (see Cowie\n1998). \n\nMentalistic accounts tend to assume, and sometimes even explicitly to\nembrace (see Fodor 1981), the hypothesis that the mind possesses at\nbirth or innately a set of procedures or internally represented\nprocessing rules which are deployed when learning or acquiring new\nresponses. Behaviorism, by contrast, is anti-nativist. Behaviorism,\ntherefore, appeals to theorists who deny that there are innate rules\nby which organisms learn. To Skinner and Watson organisms learn\nwithout being innately or pre-experientially provided with implicit\nprocedures by which to learn. Learning does not consist, at least\ninitially, in rule-governed behavior. Learning is what organisms do in\nresponse to stimuli.  For a behaviorist an organism learns, as it\nwere, from its successes and mistakes. “Rules,” says\nSkinner (1984a), “are derived from contingencies, which specify\ndiscriminative stimuli, responses, and consequences”\n(p. 583). (See also Dennett 1978). \n\nMuch contemporary work in cognitive science on the set of models known\nas connectionist or parallel distributed processing (PDP) models seems\nto share behaviorism’s anti-nativism about learning. PDP model building takes an\napproach to learning which is response oriented rather than\nrule-governed and this is because, like behaviorism, it has roots in\nassociationism (see Bechtel 1985; compare Graham 1991 with Maloney\n1991). Whether PDP models ultimately are or must be anti-nativist\ndepends upon what counts as native or innate rules (Bechtel and\nAbrahamsen 1991, pp. 103–105).\n  \n\nThe third reason for behaviorism’s appeal, popular at least\nhistorically, is related to its disdain for reference to inner mental\nor mentalistic information processing as explanatory causes of behavior. The\ndisdain is most vigorously exemplified in the work of\nSkinner. Skinner’s skepticism about explanatory references to mental\ninnerness may be described as follows. \n\nSuppose we try to explain the public behavior of a person by\ndescribing how they represent,conceptualize or think about their situation.  Suppose\nthey conceive or think of their situation in a certain\nway, not as bare, as filled with items without attributes, but as things, as\ntrees, as people, as walruses, walls, and wallets.  Suppose, we also say, a\nperson never merely interacts with their environment; but rather\ninteracts with their environment as they perceive, see, or represent\nit. So, for example, thinking of something as a wallet, a person\nreaches for it.  Perceiving something as a walrus, they back away from\nit. Classifying something as a wall, they don’t bump into it. So understood,\nbehavior is endogenously produced movement, viz. behavior that has its\ncausal origin within the person who thinks of or represents their situation in a\ncertain way. \n\nSkinner would object to such claims.  He would object not because he\nbelieves that the eye is innocent or that inner or endogenous activity\ndoes not occur.  He would object because he believes that behavior\nmust be explained in terms that do not themselves presuppose the very\nthing that is explained. The outside (public)\nbehavior of a person is not accounted for by referring to the inside\n(inner processing, cognitive activity) behavior of the person (say,\nhis or her classifying or analyzing their environment) if, therein,\nthe behavior of the person ultmately is unexplained. “The\nobjection,” wrote Skinner, “to inner states is not that\nthey do not exist, but that they are not relevant in a functional\nanalysis” (Skinner 1953, p. 35). ‘Not relevant’\nmeans, for Skinner, explanatorily circular or regressive. \n\nSkinner charges that since mental activity is a form of behavior\n(albeit inner), the only non-regressive, non-circular way to explain\nbehavior is to appeal to something non-behavioral. This non-behavioral\nsomething is environmental stimuli and an organism’s interactions\nwith, and reinforcement from, the environment. \n\nSo, the third reason for behaviorism’s appeal is that it tries to\navoid (what it claims is) circular, regressive explanations of behavior. It aims to\nrefrain from accounting for one type of behavior (overt) in terms of\nanother type of behavior (covert), all the while, in some sense,\nleaving behavior unexplained. \n\nIt should be noted that Skinner’s views about explanation and the\npurported circularity of explanation by reference to inner processing\nare both extreme and scientifically contestable, and that many who\nhave self-identified as behaviorists including Guthrie, Tolman, and\nHull, or continue to work within the tradition, broadly understood,\nincluding Killeen (1987) and Rescorla (1990), take exception to much\nthat Skinner has said about explanatory references to innerness. Also Skinner himself is not always clear about his aversion to innerness. Skinner’s derisive attitude towards explanatory references to mental innerness stems, in part, not just\nfrom fears of explanatory circularity but from his conviction that if\nthe language of psychology is permitted to refer to internal\nprocessing, this goes some way towards permitting talk of immaterial\nmental substances, agents endowed with contra-causal free will, and\nlittle persons (homunculi) within bodies. Each of these Skinner takes\nto be incompatible with a scientific worldview (see Skinner 1971; see\nalso Day 1976). Finally, it must be noted that Skinner’s aversion to\nexplanatory references to innerness is not an aversion to inner mental\nstates or processes per se. He readily admits that private thoughts and so on exist.\nSkinner countenances talk of inner events but only provided that their innerness is\ntreated in the same manner as public behavior or overt responses. An adequate\nscience of behavior, he claims, must describe events taking place\nwithin the skin of the organism as part of behavior itself (see\nSkinner 1976). “So far as I am concerned,” he wrote in\n1984 in a special issue of Behavioral and Brain Sciences devoted to\nhis work, “whatever happens when we inspect a public stimulus is\nin every respect similar to what happens when we introspect a private\none” (Skinner 1984b, p. 575; compare Graham 1984,\npp. 558–9). \n\nSkinner does not have much to say about just how inner (covert, private)\nbehavior (like thinking, classifying, and analyzing) can be described\nin the same manner as public or overt behavior.  But his idea is\nroughly as follows.  Just as we may describe overt behavior or motor\nmovement in terms of concepts like stimulus, response, conditioning,\nreinforcement, and so on, so we may deploy the very same terms in\ndescribing inner or covert behavior.  One thought or line of thought may reinforce\nanother thought.  An act of analysis may serve as a stimulus for an\neffort at classification.  And so on.  Purely ‘mentalistic’ activities\nmay be at least roughly parsed in terms of behavioral concepts —\na topic to be revisited later in the entry (in the 7th Section).  \n\nSkinner is the only major figure in the history of behaviorism to\noffer a socio-political world view based on his commitment to\nbehaviorism.  Skinner constructed a theory as well as narrative\npicture in Walden Two (1948) of what an ideal human society would be\nlike if designed according to behaviorist principles (see also Skinner\n1971). Skinner’s social worldview illustrates his aversions to\nfree will, to homunculi, and to dualism as well as his positive reasons for\nclaiming that a person’s history of environmental interactions\ncontrols his or her behavior. \n\nOne possible feature of human behavior which Skinner deliberately\nrejects is that people freely or creatively make their own environments (see\nChomsky 1971, Black 1973). Skinner protests that “it is in the nature of\nan experimental analysis of human behavior that it should strip away\nthe functions previously assigned to a free or autonomous person and transfer them\none by one to the controlling environment” (1971, p. 198). \n\nCritics have raised several objections to the Skinnerian social\npicture. One of the most persuasive, and certainly one of the most\nfrequent, adverts to Skinner’s vision of the ideal human society. It\nis a question asked of the fictional founder of Walden Two, Frazier,\nby the philosopher Castle. It is the question of what is the best\nsocial or communal mode of existence for a human being. Frazier’s, and therein\nSkinner’s, response to this question is both too general and\nincomplete.  Frazier/Skinner praises the values of health,\nfriendship, relaxation, rest, and so forth. However, these values are\nhardly the detailed basis of a social system. \n\nThere is a notorious difficulty in social theory of specifying the\nappropriate level of detail at which a blueprint for a new and ideal\nsociety must be presented (see Arnold 1990, pp. 4–10). Skinner\nidentifies the behavioristic principles and learning incentives that\nhe hopes will reduce systematic injustices in social systems. He also\ndescribes a few practices (concerning child rearing and the like) that\nare intended to contribute to human happiness. However, he offers only\nthe haziest descriptions of the daily lives of Walden Two citizens and\nno suggestions for how best to resolve disputes about alternative ways\nof life that are prima facie consistent with behaviorist principles\n(see Kane 1996, p. 203). He gives little or no serious attention to\nthe crucial general problem of inter-personal conflict resolution and\nto the role of institutional arrangements in resolving conflicts. \n\nIn an essay which appeared in The Behavior Analyst (1985), nearly\nforty years after the publication of Walden Two, Skinner, in the guise\nof Frazier, tried to clarify his characterization of ideal human\ncircumstances. He wrote that in the ideal human society “people\njust naturally do the things they need to do to maintain themselves\n… and treat each other well, and they just naturally do a\nhundred other things they enjoy doing because they do not have to do\nthem” (p. 9).  However, of course, doing a hundred things humans\nenjoy doing means only that Walden Two is vaguely defined, not that\nits culturally instituted habits and the character of its institutions\nmerit emulation. \n\nThe incompleteness of Skinner’s description of the ideal human society\nor life is so widely acknowledged that one might wonder if actual\nexperiments in Walden Two living could lend useful detail to his\nblueprint. More than one such social experiment has been\nconducted. Perhaps the most interesting (in part because the community\nhas evolved away from its Skinnerian roots) is the Twin Oaks\nCommunity in Virginia in the U.S.A., which can be indirectly explored\nvia the Internet (see Other Internet Resources). \n\nBehaviorism is dismissed by\ncognitive scientists developing intricate internal information\nprocessing models of cognition. Its laboratory routines or experimental regimens are neglected by cognitive ethologists and ecological psychologists convinced that\nits methods are irrelevant to studying how animals and persons behave\nin their natural and social environment. Its traditional relative\nindifference towards neuroscience and deference to environmental\ncontingencies is rejected by neuroscientists sure that direct study of\nthe brain is the only way to understand the truly proximate causes of behavior. \n\nBut by no means has behaviorism disappeared. Robust elements of\nbehaviorism survive in both behavior therapy and laboratory-based\nanimal learning theory (of which more below). In the metaphysics of\nmind, too, behavioristic themes survive in the approach to mind known\nas Functionalism. Functionalism defines states of mind as states that\nplay causal-functional roles in animals or systems in which\nthey occur. Paul Churchland writes of Functionalism as follows:\n“The essential or defining feature of any type of mental states\nis the set of causal relations it bears to … bodily\nbehavior” (1984, p. 36).  This functionalist notion is similar\nto the behaviorist idea that reference to behavior and to\nstimulus/response relations enters centrally and essentially into any\naccount of what it means for a creature to behave or to be subject, in\nthe scheme of analytical or logical behaviorism, to the attribution of\nmental states.  \n\nFans of the so-called and now widely discussed Extended Mind\nHypothesis (EMH) also share a kinship with behaviorism or at least\nwith Skinner. The defining hypothesis of EMH is that “mental”\nrepresentation is a matter that spills out from the brain or head into\nthe world and cultural environment (Levy 2007).  Representations are\nthings external to the head or which bear special individuating\nrelationships with external devices or forms of cultural activity.\nSkinner’s misgivings about depicting the power of mental\nrepresentation as something confined to the head (brain, inner mind)\nare at least loosely akin to EMH’s shift to depict representationality\nas environmentally extended. \nElements, however, are elements. Behaviorism is no longer a\ndominating research program.   \nWhy has the influence of behaviorism declined?  The deepest and\nmost complex reason for behaviorism’s decline in influence is its\ncommitment to the thesis that behavior can be explained without\nreference to non-behavioral and inner mental (cognitive,\nrepresentational, or interpretative) activity.  Behavior, for Skinner,\ncan be explained just by reference to its “functional”\n(Skinner’s term) relation to or co-variation with the environment and\nto the animal’s history of environmental interaction.\nNeurophysiological and neurobiological conditions, for Skinner,\nsustain or implement these functional or causal relations.  But they\ndo not serve as ultimate or independent sources or explanations of\nbehavior.  Behavior, Skinner (1953) wrote, cannot be accounted for\n“while staying wholly inside [an animal]; eventually we must\nturn to forces operating upon the organism from without.”\n“Unless there is a weak spot in our causal chain so that the\nsecond [neurological] link is not lawfully determined by the first\n[environmental stimuli], or the third [behavior] by the second, the\nfirst and third links must be lawfully related.” (p. 35)\n“Valid information about the second link may throw light on this\nrelationship but can in no way alter it.” (ibid.)  It is\n“external variables of which behavior is a function.”\n(ibid.)  \n\nSkinner was no triumphalist about neuroscience.  Neuroscience, for\nhim, more or less just identifies organismic physical processes that\nunderlie animal/environment interactions.  Therein, it rides\nevidential or epistemic piggyback on radical behaviorism’s prior\ndescription of those interactions.  “The organism”, he\nsays, “is not empty, and it cannot adequately be treated simply\nas a black box” (1976, p. 233).  “Something is done today\nwhich affects the behavior of the organism tomorrow” (p. 233).\nNeuroscience describes inside-the-box mechanisms that permit today’s\nreinforcing stimulus to affect tomorrow’s behavior.  The neural box is\nnot empty, but it is unable, except in cases of malfunction or\nbreakdown, to disengage the animal from past patterns of behavior that\nhave been reinforced.  It cannot exercise independent or\nnon-environmentally countervailing authority over behavior. \n\nFor many critics of behaviorism it seems obvious that, at a minimum,\nthe occurrence and character of behavior (especially human behavior)\ndoes not depend primarily upon an individual’s reinforcement history,\nalthough that is a factor, but on the fact that the environment or\nlearning history is represented by an individual and how (the manner\nin which) it is represented.  The fact that the environment is\nrepresented by me constrains or informs the functional or causal relations that\nhold between my behavior and the environment and may, from an\nanti-behaviorist perspective, partially disengage my behavior from its\nconditioning or reinforcement history.  No matter, for example, how\ntirelessly and repeatedly I have been reinforced for pointing to or\neating ice cream, such a history is impotent if I just don’t see a\npotential stimulus as ice cream or represent it to myself as ice cream\nor if I desire to hide the fact that something is ice cream from\nothers.  My conditioning history, narrowly understood as unrepresented\nby me, is behaviorally less important than the environment or my\nlearning history as represented or interpreted by me. \n\nSimilarly, for many critics of behaviorism, if representationality\ncomes between environment and behavior, this implies that Skinner is\ntoo restrictive or limited in his attitude towards the role of\nbrain mechanisms in producing or controlling behavior.\nThe brain is no mere passive memory bank of behavior/environment\ninteractions (see Roediger and Goff 1998).  The central nervous\nsystem, which otherwise sustains my reinforcement history, contains\nsystems or neurocomputational sub-systems that implement or encode\nwhatever representational content or meaning the environment has for me.  It is\nalso an active interpretation machine or semantic engine, often\ncritically performing environmentally untethered and behavior\ncontrolling tasks.  Such talk of representation or interpretation,\nhowever, is a perspective from which behaviorism—most certainly\nin Skinner— wishes and tries to depart. \n\nOne defining aspiration of traditional behaviorism is that it tried to\nfree psychology from having to theorize about how animals and persons\nrepresent (internally, in the head) their environment. This effort at\nfreedom was important, historically, because it seemed that\nbehavior/environment connections are a lot clearer and more manageable\nexperimentally than internal representations.  Unfortunately, for\nbehaviorism, it’s hard to imagine a more restrictive rule for\npsychology than one which prohibits hypotheses about representational\nstorage and processing. Stephen Stich, for example, complains against\nSkinner that “we now have an enormous collection of experimental\ndata which, it would seem, simply cannot be made sense of unless we\npostulate something like” information processing mechanisms in\nthe heads of organisms (1998, p. 649). \n\nA second reason for rejecting behaviorism is that some features of\nmentality—some elements, in particular, of the conscious mental life of\npersons—have characteristic ‘qualia’ or\npresentationally immediate or phenomenal qualities. To be in pain, for\nexample, is not merely to produce appropriate pain behavior under the\nright environmental circumstances, but it is to experience a\n‘like-thisness’ to the pain (as something dull or sharp,\nperhaps). A purely behaviorist creature, a ‘zombie’, as it\nwere, may engage in pain behavior, including beneath the skin pain\nresponses, yet completely lack whatever is qualitatively distinctive\nof and proper to pain (its painfulness). (See also Graham 1998,\npp. 47–51 and Graham and Horgan 2000.  On the scope of the phenomenal\nin human mentality, see Graham, Horgan, and Tienson 2009). \n\nThe philosopher-psychologist U. T. Place, although otherwise\nsympathetic to the application of behaviorist ideas to matters of mind,\nargued that phenomenal qualia cannot be analyzed in behaviorist terms. He claimed\nthat qualia are neither behavior nor dispositions to\nbehave. “They make themselves felt,” he said, “from\nthe very moment that the experience of whose qualia they are”\ncomes into existence (2000, p. 191; reprinted in Graham and Valentine\n2004). They are instantaneous features of processes or events rather\nthan dispositions manifested over time. Qualitative mental events\n(such as sensations, perceptual experiences, and so on), for Place,\nundergird dispositions to behave rather than count as\ndispositions. Indeed, it is tempting to postulate that the qualitative\naspects of mentality affect non-qualitative elements of internal\nprocessing, and that they, for example, contribute to arousal,\nattention, and receptivity to associative conditioning. \n\nThe third reason for rejecting behaviorism is connected with Noam\nChomsky. Chomsky has been one of behaviorism’s most successful and\ndamaging critics. In a review of Skinner’s book on verbal behavior\n(see above), Chomsky (1959) charged that behaviorist models of\nlanguage learning cannot explain various facts about language\nacquisition, such as the rapid acquisition of language by young\nchildren, which is sometimes referred to as the phenomenon of\n“lexical explosion.” A child’s linguistic abilities appear\nto be radically underdetermined by the evidence of verbal behavior\noffered to the child in the short period in which he or she expresses\nthose abilities. By the age of four or five (normal) children have an\nalmost limitless capacity to understand and produce sentences which\nthey have never heard before. Chomsky also argued that it seems\nplainly untrue that language learning depends on the application of\ndetailed reinforcement.  A child does not, as an English speaker in the\npresence of a house, utter “house” repeatedly in the\npresence of reinforcing elders.  Language as such seems to be learned\nwithout, in a sense, being explicitly taught or taught in detail, and\nbehaviorism doesn’t offer an account of how this could be so.\nChomsky’s own speculations about the psychological realities\nunderlying language development include the hypothesis that the rules\nor principles underlying linguistic behavior are abstract (applying to\nall human languages) and innate (part of our native psychological\nendowment as human beings).  When put to the test of uttering a\ngrammatical sentence, a person, for Chomsky, has a virtually infinite\nnumber of possible responses available, and the only way in which to\nunderstand this virtually infinite generative capacity is to suppose\nthat a person possesses a powerful and abstract innate grammar\n(underlying whatever competence he or she may have in one or more\nparticular natural languages). \n\nThe problem to which Chomsky refers, which is the problem of\nbehavioral competence and thus performance outstripping individual\nlearning histories, goes beyond merely the issue of linguistic\nbehavior in young children.  It appears to be a fundamental fact about\nhuman beings that our behavior and behavioral capacities often surpass\nthe limitations of individual reinforcement histories. Our history\nof reinforcement is often too impoverished to determine uniquely what\nwe do or how we do it. Much learning, therefore, seems to require\npre-existing or innate representational structures or principled\nconstraints within which learning occurs. (See also Brewer 1974, but\ncompare with Bates et al. 1998 and Cowie 1998). \n\nIs the case against behaviorism definitive? Decisive? Paul Meehl noted\ndecades ago that theories in psychology seem to disappear not under\nthe force of decisive refutation but rather because researchers lose\ninterest in their theoretical orientations (Meehl 1978). One\nimplication of Meehl’s thesis is that a once popular\n“Ism”, not having been decisively refuted, may restore\nsome of its former prominence if it mutates or transforms itself so as\nto incorporate responses to criticisms. What may this mean for\nbehaviorism? It may mean that some version of the doctrine might\nrebound. \n\nSkinner claimed that neural activities subserve or underlie\nbehavior/environment relations and that the organism’s contribution to\nthese relations does not reduce to neurophysiological properties.  But\nthis does not mean that behaviorism cannot gain useful alliance with\nneuroscience.  Reference to brain structures (neurobiology,\nneurochemistry, and so on) may help in explaining behavior even if\nsuch references do not ultimately displace reference to environmental\ncontingencies in a behaviorist account. \n\nSuch is a lesson of animal modeling in which behaviorist themes still\nenjoy currency.  Animal models of addiction, habit and instrumental\nlearning are particularly noteworthy because they bring behavioral\nresearch into closer contact than did traditional psychological\nbehaviorism with research on the brain mechanisms underlying\nreinforcement, especially positive reinforcement (West 2006,\npp. 91–108).  One result of this contact is the discovery that\nsensitized neural systems responsible for heightened reinforcement\nvalue or strength can be dissociated from the hedonic utility or\npleasurable quality of reinforcement (see Robinson and Berridge\n2003). The power of a stimulus to reinforce behavior may be\nindependent of whether it is a source or cause of pleasure. Focus on brain\nmechanisms underlying reinforcement also forms the centerpiece of one\nof the most active research programs in current neuroscience,\nso-called neuroeconomics, which weds study of the brain’s reward\nsystems with models of valuation and economic decision making (see\nMontague and Berns 2002; Nestler and Malenka 2004; Ross et al\n2008). Behaviorism may do well to purchase some of neuroeconomic’s\nconceptual currency, especially since some advocates of the program\nsee themselves as behaviorists in spirit if not stereotypical letter\nand honor the work of a number of theorists in the behavioristic\ntradition of the experimental analysis of behavior, such as George\nAinslie, Richard Herrnstein and Howard Rachlin, on how patterns of\nbehavior relate to patterns of reward or reinforcement (see Ross et\nal. 2008, especially p. 10). One important assumption in neuroeconomics is that\nfull explanations of organism/environmental interactions will combine\nfacts about such things as reinforcement schedules with appeal to\nneurocomputational modeling and to the neurochemistry and neurobiology\nof reinforcement.  \n\nOther potential sources of renewal?  The continued popularity of\nbehavior therapy is noteworthy because it offers a potential domain of\ntesting application for the regimen of behaviorism.\nEarly versions of behavior therapy sought to apply restricted results from\nSkinnerian or Pavlovian conditioning paradigms to human behavior\nproblems. No minds should be spoken of; just behavior—stimuli,\nresponses, and reinforcement. Therapy shapes behavior not\nthought. Successive generations of behavior therapy have relaxed those\nconceptual restrictions.  Advocates refer to themselves as cognitive\nbehavior therapists (e.g. Mahoney, 1974; Meichenbaum, 1977).  Clients’\nbehavior problems are described by referring to their beliefs,\ndesires, intentions, memories, and so on.  Even the language of\nself-reflexive thought and belief (so-called\n‘meta-cognition’) figures in some accounts of behavioral\ndifficulties and interventions (Wells 2000).  One goal of such\nlanguage is to encourage clients to monitor and self-reinforce their\nown behavior. Self-reinforcement is an essential feature of behavioral\nself-control (Rachlin 2000; Ainslie 2001). \n\nIt may be wondered whether cognitive behavior therapy is consistent\nwith behaviorist doctrine.  Much depends on how beliefs and desires\nare understood.  If beliefs and desires are understood as states that\nsomehow spill out into the environment and are individuated in terms\nof their non-mentalistic, behavior-like role in organism/environment interactions,\nthis would be consistent with traditional behaviorist doctrine. It\nwould reflect the principle of logical or analytical behaviorism that\nif mental terms are to be used in the description and explanation of\nbehavior, they must be defined or paraphrased in non-mental behavioral\nterms.  Prospects for belief/desire individuation in non-mental,\nenvironmentally externalist terms may look doubtful, especially in\ncases of conscious attitudes(see Horgan, Tienson and Graham 2006). But\nthe topic of the forms and limits of behavior therapy and the range of\nits plausible application is open for continued further\nexploration.  \n\nIn 1977 Willard Day, a behavioral psychologist and founding editor of\nthe journal Behaviorism (which now is known as Behavior and\nPhilosophy), published Skinner’s “Why I am not a cognitive\npsychologist” (Skinner 1977). Skinner began the paper by stating\nthat “the variables of which human behavior is a function lie in\nthe environment” (p. 1). Skinner ended by remarking that\n“cognitive constructs give … a misleading account of\nwhat” is inside a human being (p. 10) \n\nMore than a decade earlier, in 1966 Carl Hempel had announced his defection\nfrom behaviorism: \n\nHempel had come to believe that it is a mistake to imagine that human\nbehavior can be understood exclusively in non-mental, behavioristic\nterms. \n\nContemporary psychology and philosophy largely share Hempel’s\nconviction that the explanation of behavior cannot omit invoking a\ncreature’s representation of its world. Psychology must use\npsychological terms. Behavior without cognition is blind.\nPsychological theorizing without reference to internal cognitive\nprocessing is explanatorily impaired.  To say this, of course, is not\nto a priori preclude that behaviorism will recover some of its\nprominence. Just how to conceive of cognitive processing (even where\nto locate it) remains a heated subject of debate (see Melser 2004; see\nalso Levy 2007, pp. 29–64). But if behaviorism is to recover some of\nits prominence, this recovery may require a reformulation of its\ndoctrines that is attune to developments (like that of neuroeconomics)\nin neuroscience as well as in novel therapeutic orientations. \n\nSkinner’s vantage point on or special contribution to behaviorism mates the science of behavior\nwith the language of organism/environment interactions.  But we humans don’t\njust run and mate and walk and eat in this or that environment.  We think, classify, analyze, imagine, and\ntheorize. In addition to our outer behavior, we have highly complex\ninner lives, wherein we are active, often imaginatively, in our heads,\nall the while often remaining as stuck as posts, as still as stones.\nCall our inner life ‘behavior’ if one wants, but this piece of linguistic\nstipulation does not mean that the probability or occurrence of inner\nevents is shaped by the same environmental contingencies as overt\nbehavior or bodily movements.  It does not mean that understanding a\nsentence or composing an entry for this encyclopedia consist of the same general modes of discriminatory responses as\nlearning how to move one’s body in pursuit of a food source.  How the Inner\nRepresentational World of mind maps into the Country of Behaviorism remains\nthe “ism’s” still incompletely charted territory.
