Like\n Russell’s paradox, it can take\n the form of a paradox of\nset theory or the theory of properties. But it can also take the form\nof a semantic paradox, closely akin to the \n  Liar paradox.\nCurry’s paradox differs from both Russell’s paradox and\nthe Liar paradox in that it doesn’t essentially involve the\nnotion of negation. Common truth-theoretic versions involve a sentence\nthat says of itself that if it is true then an arbitrarily chosen\nclaim is true, or—to use a more sinister instance—says of\nitself that if it is true then every falsity is true. The paradox is\nthat the existence of such a sentence appears to imply the truth of\nthe arbitrarily chosen claim, or—in the more sinister\ninstance—of every falsity. In this entry, we show how the\nvarious Curry paradoxes can be constructed, examine the space of\navailable solutions, and explain some ways Curry’s paradox is\nsignificant and poses distinctive challenges.\n\nSuppose that your friend tells you: “If what I’m saying\nusing this very sentence is true, then time is infinite”. It\nturns out that there is a short and seemingly compelling argument for\nthe following conclusion: \nMany hold that (P) is beyond belief (and, in that sense, paradoxical),\neven if time is indeed infinite. Or, if that isn’t bad enough,\nconsider another version, this time involving a claim known to be\nfalse. Let your friend say instead: “If what I’m saying\nusing this very sentence is true, then all numbers are prime”.\nNow, mutatis mutandis, the same short and seemingly\ncompelling argument yields (Q): \nHere is the argument for\n (P).\n Let \\(k\\) be the self-referential sentence your friend uttered,\nsimplified somewhat so that it reads “If \\(k\\) is true then time\nis infinite”. In view of what \\(k\\) says, we know this much: \nBut, of course, we also have \nUnder the supposition that \\(k\\) is true, we have thus derived a\nconditional together with its antecedent. Using modus ponens\nwithin the scope of the supposition, we now derive the\nconditional’s consequent under that same supposition: \nThe rule of conditional proof now entitles us to affirm a conditional\nwith our supposition as antecedent: \nBut, since (4) just is \\(k\\) itself, we thus have \nFinally, putting (4) and (5) together by modus ponens, we\nget \nWe seem to have established that time is infinite using no assumptions\nbeyond the existence of the self-referential sentence \\(k\\), along with\nthe seemingly obvious principles about truth that took us to (1) and\nalso from (4) to (5). And the same goes for\n (Q),\n since we could have used the same form of argument to reach the false\nconclusion that all numbers are prime. \nOne challenge posed by Curry’s paradox is to pinpoint what goes\nwrong in the foregoing informal argument for\n (P),\n (Q) or the like. But starting with Curry’s initial\npresentation in Curry 1942b (see the supplementary document on \n Curry on Curry’s Paradox), discussion\nof Curry’s paradox has usually had a different focus. It has\nconcerned various formal systems —most often set theories or\ntheories of truth. In this setting what poses the paradox is a proof\nthat the system has a particular feature. Typically, the feature at\nissue is triviality. A theory is said to be trivial, or\nabsolutely inconsistent, when it affirms every claim that is\nexpressible in the language of the\n theory.[2] \nAn argument establishing that a particular formal theory is trivial\nwill pose a problem if either of the following is the case: (i) we\nwish to use the formal theory in our inquiries, as we use set theory\nwhen doing mathematics, or (ii) we wish to use the formal theory in\norder to model features of language or thought, in particular the\nclaims to which some speakers or thinkers are committed. Either way,\nthe target theory’s triviality would show that it is inadequate\nfor its intended purpose. So this is a second challenge posed by\nCurry’s paradox. \nTo spell out the sense in which Curry’s paradox constrains\ntheories we need to say what a Curry sentence is. Informally,\na Curry sentence is a sentence that is equivalent, by the lights of\nsome theory, to a conditional with itself as antecedent. For\nexample, one might think of the argument of\n section 1.1\n as appealing to an informal theory of truth. Then the sentence\n“\\(k\\) is true” serves as a Curry sentence for that\ntheory. That is because, given what our informal theory tells us about\nwhat \\(k\\)’s truth involves, “\\(k\\) is true” should\nbe equivalent to “If \\(k\\) is true, then time is infinite”\n(since this conditional is \\(k\\) itself). \nIn what follows, the notation \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is used\nto say that theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) contains sentence \\(\\alpha\\), and\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is used to say that \\(\\alpha\\)\nfollows from the premises collected in \\(\\Gamma\\) according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) (i.e., according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)’s\nconsequence relation\n \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}}\\)).[3]\n Except in\n section 4.2.1,\n however, we will be concerned only with claims about what follows\naccording to the theory from a single premise, i.e., claims expressed by \nsentences of form\n\\(\\gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\). (We rely on context to make clear \nwhere such a sentence is being used and where it is only being mentioned.) \nTwo sentences (in the language\nof theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)) will be called intersubstitutable\naccording to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) provided the truth of any claim of the\nform \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is unaffected by\nsubstitutions of one for the other within \\(\\alpha\\) or within any of\nthe sentences in \\(\\Gamma\\). Finally, we assume that the language\ncontains a connective \\({\\rightarrow}\\) that serves, in some suitable\nsense, as a conditional. For purposes of the following definition, we\ndon’t place any specific requirements on the behavior of this\nconditional. We can now define the notion of a Curry sentence for\na sentence-theory pair. \nDefinition 1 (Curry sentence) Let \\(\\pi\\) be a\nsentence of the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). A Curry sentence for\n\\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is any sentence \\(\\kappa\\) such that\n\\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\kappa {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) are intersubstitutable\naccording to\n \\(\\mathcal{T}\\).[4] \nThe various versions of Curry’s paradox arise from the existence\nof arguments in favor of the following very general claim. (These\narguments, which rest on assumptions about the conditional\n\\({\\rightarrow}\\), will be discussed in detail in\n section 3.) \nTroubling Claim For every theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), and\nany sentence \\(\\pi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), if there is a\nCurry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). \nAn argument that appears to establish the Troubling Claim will count\nas paradoxical provided there is also compelling reason to believe\nthat this claim is false. A counterexample to the Troubling Claim\nwould be any theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and sentence \\(\\pi\\) such that\nthere is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) but it is\nnot the case that \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). \nAs noted above, Curry’s paradox is often understood as a\nchallenge to the existence of nontrivial theories. Given the Troubling\nClaim, a theory will be trivial whenever a Curry sentence can be\nformulated for any sentence in the language of the theory.\nIndeed, triviality follows from a weaker condition, which the\nfollowing definition makes explicit. \nDefinition 2 (Curry-complete theory) A theory\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is Curry-complete provided that for every sentence\n\\(\\pi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), there is some \\(\\pi'\\)\nsuch that (i) there is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi'\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and (ii) if \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi'\\) then\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). \nWhile one instance of \\(\\pi'\\) satisfying the condition (ii) would be\n\\(\\pi\\) itself, another instance would be an “explosive”\nsentence \\(\\bot\\) that is contained in a theory only if every\nsentence is contained in the\n theory.[5] \nThe Troubling Claim now has an immediate consequence: a Curry-complete\ntheory must contain every sentence in its language. \nTroubling Corollary Every Curry-complete theory is\ntrivial. \nAgain, any argument that appears to establish the Troubling Corollary\nwill count as paradoxical provided that there is compelling reason to\nbelieve that there are nontrivial theories (indeed true theories) that are\nCurry-complete. \nFor the remainder of this entry, Curry’s paradox will be\nunderstood as imposing a paradoxical constraint on theories, namely\nthe one stated by the above Troubling Corollary. Presenting a version\nof Curry’s paradox, understood this way, involves doing two\nthings: \narguing that \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is Curry-complete, for some apparently\nnontrivial target theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), and \ngiving an argument for the Troubling\n Claim.[6] \nSections\n 2\n and\n 3\n discuss these two tasks in that order. For now, the basic idea can be\nconveyed using the example of the self-referential sentence \\(k\\) that\nreads “If \\(k\\) is true then time is infinite”. First,\ngiven our understanding of truth, we recognize that the sentence\n“\\(k\\) is true” is intersubstitutable with “If \\(k\\)\nis true, then time is infinite”. Second, the informal argument\nof\n section 1.1\n derives a paradoxical conclusion from this equivalence. Readers\nchiefly interested in the logical principles involved in that argument\nand related ones, and the options for resisting such arguments, may\nwish to turn to\n section 3. \nAs it is standardly presented today, Curry’s paradox afflicts\n“naive” truth theories (those featuring a\n“transparent” truth predicate) and “naive” set\ntheories (those featuring unrestricted set abstraction). This section\nwill explain how each kind of theory can give rise to Curry sentences.\nWe start, however, with a version that concerns theories of\n properties, a version that more closely resembles\nCurry’s formulation. (The supplementary document\n Curry on Curry’s Paradox\n briefly characterizes the targets of Curry’s own versions of\nthe paradox.) \nA theory of properties features unrestricted property\nabstraction provided that for any condition statable in the\nlanguage of the theory, there exists a property that (according to the\ntheory) is exemplified by precisely the things that meet this\ncondition. Consider a theory \\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\) formulated in a\nlanguage with a property abstraction device \\([x: \\phi x]\\) and an\nexemplification relation \\(\\epsilon\\). For example, if \\(\\phi(t)\\)\nsays that the object which the term \\(t\\) stands for is triangular,\n\\(t \\ \\epsilon \\ [x: \\phi x]\\) says that this object exemplifies the\nproperty of triangularity. Then, given unrestricted property\nabstraction, we should have the following principle. \n(Property) For every open sentence \\(\\phi\\) with one\nfree variable, and every term \\(t\\), the sentences \\(t \\ \\epsilon \\\n[x: \\phi x]\\) and \\(\\phi t\\) are intersubstitutable according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\). \nIn effect, Curry (1942b) sketches two\n“methods of constructing” Curry sentences using his\ncounterpart of (Property). He says that the first is “based on\nthe Russell paradox”, while the second is “based on the\nEpimenides paradox”. Although both methods are\nproperty-theoretic, the first method yields a precursor of\nset-theoretic versions of Curry’s paradox, while the second\nyields a precursor of truth-theoretic versions. \nThe version of Russell’s paradox which Curry’s\nfirst method resembles is the one that concerns property\nexemplification. Its topic is the property of being such that one\nfails to exemplify oneself. We obtain a property-theoretic Curry\nsentence by considering instead the property of being such that\none exemplifies oneself only if time is infinite. Say that we\nintroduce the name \\(h\\) for that property, by stipulating \\(h =_{def}\n[x: x \\ \\epsilon \\ x {\\rightarrow}\\pi]\\), where the sentence \\(\\pi\\)\nsays that time is\n infinite.[7]\n Applying the principle\n (Property)\n to the sentence \\(h \\ \\epsilon \\ h\\), we find: \n\\(h \\ \\epsilon \\ h\\) and \\(h \\ \\epsilon \\ h {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\). \nIn other words, \\(h \\ \\epsilon \\ h\\) is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\)\nand \\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\). \nCurry’s first method subsequently gave rise to set-theoretic\nCurry sentences. A theory of sets features unrestricted set\nabstraction provided that for any condition statable in the\nlanguage of the theory, there exists a set that (according to the\ntheory) contains all and only the things that meet this condition. Let\n\\(\\mathcal{T_S}\\) be our theory of sets, formulated in a language that\nexpresses set abstraction using \\(\\{ x: \\phi x\\}\\) and set membership\nusing \\(\\in\\). Then the counterpart of\n (Property)\n is \n(Set) For every open sentence \\(\\phi\\) with one free\nvariable, and every term \\(t\\), the sentences \\(t \\in \\{ x: \\phi x\\}\\)\nand \\(\\phi t\\) are intersubstitutable according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T_S}\\). \nTo obtain a set-theoretic Curry sentence, consider the set consisting\nof anything that is a member of itself only if time is infinite. Say\nthat we introduce the name \\(c\\) for that set, by stipulating \\(c\n=_{def} \\{ x: x \\in x {\\rightarrow}\\pi \\}\\). Applying the principle\n (Set)\n to the sentence \\(c \\in c\\), we find: \n\\(c \\in c\\) and \\(c \\in c {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) are intersubstitutable\naccording to \\(\\mathcal{T_S}\\). \nIn other words, \\(c \\in c\\) is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{T_S}\\). \nThe set-theoretic version of Curry’s paradox was introduced in\nFitch\n 1952[8]\n and is also presented in Moh 1954 and\nPrior 1955. \nDespite his remark about the “Epimenides paradox”, a form\nof the Liar paradox, Curry’s second method is a variant\nof a related semantic paradox, Grelling’s\n paradox.[9]\n In its original form, Grelling’s paradox considers a property\npossessed by many words, namely the property a word has when it\nfails to exemplify the property it stands for (Grelling\n& Nelson 1908). For example, the\nword “offensiveness” has that property: it fails to\nexemplify the property it stands for, since it isn’t offensive\n(see entry on\n paradoxes and contemporary logic).\n In effect, Curry considers instead the property a word has provided\nit exemplifies the property it stands for only if time is\ninfinite. Now suppose that our theory introduces a name \\(u\\) for\nthis property. Curry then shows how to construct a sentence that\n(speaking informally) says that the name \\(u\\) exemplifies the\nproperty it stands for. He shows that this sentence will serve as a\nCurry sentence for a theory of properties and the denotation of\n names.[10] \nThough this method of obtaining a Curry sentence is based on a\nsemantic feature of expressions, it still relies on property\nabstraction. Nonetheless, it can be viewed as a precursor to a wholly\nsemantic version. (Rather than consider the above-introduced property,\none could consider the predicate “applies to itself only if time\nis infinite”.) Accordingly, as Geach\n(1955) and Löb (1955) were\nthe first to show, Curry sentences can be obtained using semantic\nprinciples alone, without any reliance on property abstraction. Their\nroute corresponds to the informal argument, in\n section 1.1,\n involving the self-referential sentence \\(k\\) that reads “If\n\\(k\\) is true then time is infinite.” \nFor this purpose, let \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\) be a theory of truth, where\n\\(T\\) is the truth predicate. Assume the “transparency”\nprinciple \n(Truth) For every sentence \\(\\alpha\\), the sentences\n\\(T\\langle \\alpha \\rangle\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) are intersubstitutable\naccording to \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\). \nTo obtain a Curry sentence using this principle, assume there is a\nsentence \\(\\xi\\) that is \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\n {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\).[11]\n Then it follows immediately from (Truth) that \n\\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) and \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\)\nare intersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\). \nIn other words, \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) is a Curry sentence for\n\\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\). \nGeach notes that the semantic paradox that results from a sentence\nlike \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) resembles “the Curry paradox in\nset theory”. Löb, who doesn’t mention Curry’s\nwork, credits the paradox to a referee’s observation about the\nproof of what is now known as Löb’s theorem concerning\nprovability (see entry on\n Gödel’s incompleteness theorems).\n The referee, now known to have been Leon Henkin (Halbach\n& Visser 2014: 257), suggested\nthat the method Löb used in his proof “leads to a\nnew derivation of paradoxes in natural language”, namely the\ninformal argument of\n section 1.1\n above.[12] \nSuppose that we have used one of the above methods to show, for some\ntheory of truth, sets, or properties, that the theory is\nCurry-complete (in virtue, say, of containing a Curry sentence for\neach sentence of the language, or for an explosive sentence). To\nconclude that the theory in question is trivial, it now suffices to\ngive an argument for the Troubling Claim. This is the claim that for\nevery theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), if there is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\)\nand \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). Such an\nargument will make use of assumptions about the logical behavior of\nthe conditional \\({\\rightarrow}\\) mentioned in\n Definition 1.\n Assuming the Troubling Claim must be resisted, this accordingly\nplaces constraints on the behavior of this conditional. \nTo start, here is a very general limitative result, a close variant of\nthe Lemma in Curry\n 1942b.[13] \nCurry-Paradox Lemma Suppose that theory\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and sentence \\(\\pi\\) are such that (i) there is a\nCurry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), (ii) all instances of\nthe identity rule (Id) \\(\\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) hold,\nand (iii) the conditional \\({\\rightarrow}\\) satisfies both of the\nfollowing principles: \nThen \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). \nHere MP is a version of modus ponens, and Cont is a principle\nof contraction: two occurrences of the sentence \\(\\alpha\\)\nare “contracted” into one. (We will soon encounter related\nprinciples that are more commonly referred to as\n contraction.[14]) The\nCurry-Paradox Lemma entails that any Curry-complete theory must\nviolate one or more of Id, MP or Cont on pain of triviality. \nTo prove the Lemma one shows that Id, MP and Cont, together with the\n“Curry-intersubstitutivity” of \\(\\kappa\\) with \\(\\kappa\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\), suffice to establish \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\).\nThe following derivation resembles the informal argument of\n section 1.1.\n That argument also included a subargument for the principle Cont,\nwhich will be examined below. \n\n Section 4\n will discuss ways in which each of the two principles concerning\n\\({\\rightarrow}\\) assumed in the Curry-Paradox Lemma might be\njustified or rejected. \nThere are counterparts of the Curry-Paradox Lemma that invoke\nalternative sets of logical principles (see, e.g., Rogerson\n& Restall 2004 and Bimbó\n2006). Probably the most common\nversion replaces the rules Id and Cont with corresponding\nlaws: \nThe derivation now goes as follows: \nA second common counterpart of the Curry-Paradox Lemma is due to Meyer,\nRoutley, and Dunn\n (1979).[15]\n It uses two principles concerning conjunction: the law form of\nmodus ponens and the idempotency of conjunction. \nThis time the derivation goes as follows: \nFormulating the Curry-Paradox Lemma using Cont, rather than ContL or\nMPL, will make it easier to call attention (in the next section) to\nsignificant differences within the class of responses that reject both\nof the latter\n principles.[16] \nResponses to Curry’s paradox can be divided into two classes,\nbased on whether they accept the Troubling Corollary that all\nCurry-complete theories are trivial. \nCurry-incompleteness responses accept the Troubling\nCorollary. However, they deny that the target theories of properties,\nsets or truth are Curry-complete. Curry-incompleteness responses can,\nand usually do, embrace classical logic. \nCurry-completeness responses reject the Troubling Corollary;\nthey insist that there can be nontrivial Curry-complete theories. Any\nsuch theory must violate one or more of the logical principles assumed\nin the Curry-Paradox Lemma. Since classical logic validates those\nprinciples, these responses invoke a non-classical\n logic.[17] \nThere is also the option of advocating a Curry-incompleteness response\nto Curry paradoxes arising in one domain, say set theory, while\nadvocating a Curry-completeness response to Curry paradoxes arising in\nanother domain, say property theory (e.g.,\nField 2008; Beall 2009). \nExamples of prominent theories of truth that supply\nCurry-incompleteness responses to Curry’s paradox include\nTarski’s hierarchical theory, the \n  revision theory of truth\n (Gupta & Belnap 1993) and the\ncontextualist approaches (Burge\n1979, Simmons 1993, and \nGlanzberg 2001, 2004). These theories all\nrestrict the “naive” transparency principle\n (Truth).\n For an overview, see the entry on the \n  Liar paradox. In the\ncontext of set theory Curry-incompleteness responses include\nRussellian type theories and various theories that restrict the\n“naive” set abstraction principle\n (Set).\n See the entries on\n Russell’s paradox\n and\n alternative axiomatic set theories. \nIn general, the considerations relevant to evaluating most\nCurry-incompleteness responses don’t appear to be specific to\nCurry’s paradox, but pertain equally to the Liar paradox (in the\ntruth-theoretic domain) and Russell’s paradox (in the set- and\nproperty-theoretic\n domains).[18]\n For that reason the rest of this entry will focus on Curry-completeness\nresponses, though\n section 6.3\n briefly returns to the distinction in the context of so-called\nvalidity Curry paradoxes. \nCurry-completeness responses to Curry’s paradox hold that there\nare theories that are Curry-complete yet nontrivial; such a theory\nmust violate one or more of the logical principles assumed in the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma. Since the rule Id has generally been left\nunquestioned (but see French 2016 and Nicolai\n& Rossi forthcoming), this has meant denying that the\nconditional \\({\\rightarrow}\\) of a nontrivial Curry-complete theory\nsatisfies both MP and Cont. Accordingly, responses have fallen into\ntwo categories. \nEach category of Curry-completeness responses can in turn be\nsubdivided according to how it blocks purported derivations of Cont\nand MP. \nThe principle Cont that is rejected by contraction-free responses\nfollows from two standard principles. These are single-premise\nconditional proof and a slightly more general version of modus\nponens, involving at most one premise \\(\\gamma\\): \nContraction-free responses must thus reject one or the other of these\ntwo principles for the conditional of a nontrivial Curry-complete\ntheory. Accordingly, two subcategories of theorists in category (I)\ncan be identified: \nThe reason why responses in category (Ib) only count as\nweakly contraction-free is that, as steps 1-3 show, they\naccept the contraction principle according to which if \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\\) then \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\\). \nProponents of strongly contraction-free responses hold that MP′\ndoesn’t properly express the relevant form of modus\nponens. They typically present their own form of that rule\n in a “substructural” framework, specifically one that lets us\ndistinguish between what follows from a premise taken once\nand what follows from the same premise taken twice. (See entry on\n substructural logics.)\nAccordingly, MP′ needs to be replaced by \nand the rule of “structural contraction” needs to be\nrejected: \nIt is because they reject structural contraction that strongly contraction-free \napproaches can claim to preserve\nmodus ponens despite rejecting MP′ (see Shapiro 2011, Zardini 2013, and Ripley 2015a). \nStrongly contraction-free responses also need to block a derivation of\nMP′ using a pair of principles involving conjunction: \nAvoiding this derivation of MP′ requires denying that there is a\nconjunction \\(\\wedge\\) that obeys both MP′\\(_{\\wedge}\\) and\nIdem\\(_{\\wedge}\\). According to many strongly contraction-free\nresponses (e.g., Mares & Paoli 2014;\nZardini 2011), one kind of conjunction—the\n“multiplicative” kind, or “fusion”—obeys MP′\\(_{\\wedge}\\)\nbut not Idem\\(_{\\wedge}\\), whereas another kind—the\n“additive” kind—obeys Idem\\(_{\\wedge}\\) but not\nMP′\\(_{\\wedge}\\) (see entry on\n linear logic,\n and Ripley 2015a).\nIf the substructural framework discussed above is used, the failure of MP′\\(_{\\wedge}\\) amounts to the fact that for additive conjunction, \n\\(\\gamma, \\delta \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\\) is not equivalent to \\(\\gamma \\wedge \\delta \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\\). \nAs for weakly contraction-free responses, the failure of CP has\nsometimes been motivated using “worlds” semantics of the\nsort that involve a distinction between logically possible\nand impossible worlds (e.g., Beall\n2009; Nolan 2016). To refute CP we need the truth of \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_\\mathcal{T} \\beta\\) and the falsity of \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\n\\alpha{\\rightarrow}\\beta\\). On the target “worlds”\napproaches \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) is defined as truth preservation\nover a proper subset of worlds (in a model), namely, the\n“possible worlds” of the model. Hence, for \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_\\mathcal{T} \\beta\\) to be true is for there to be no possible\nworld (in any model) at which \\(\\alpha\\) is true and \\(\\beta\\) untrue.\nIn turn, to refute \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\alpha{\\rightarrow}\\beta\\) we\nneed a possible world at which \\(\\alpha{\\rightarrow}\\beta\\) is untrue.\nHow does that happen? Because connectives are defined in a way that\ntakes account of all (types of) worlds in the model (possible\nand, if there be any, impossible) there’s an option for\n\\(\\alpha{\\rightarrow}\\beta\\) to be untrue at a possible world in\nvirtue of \\(\\alpha\\) being true and \\(\\beta\\) being untrue at an\nimpossible world. And that’s just what happens on the\ntarget approaches. (Exactly how one defines the truth-at-a-world and\nfalsity-at-a-world conditions for the arrow depends on the exact\n“worlds” approach at issue.) \nDetachment-free responses must block a straightforward derivation of\nMP based on a principle of transitivity together with the converse of single-premise\nconditional proof: \nThere are two subcategories of theorists in category (II): \nThe reason why responses in category (IIb) are only weakly\ndetachment-free is that CCP, which these responses accept, can be\nregarded as a kind of detachment principle for the conditional. \nOne strategy for replying to the charge that detachment-free responses\nare counterintuitive has been to appeal to a connection between\nconsequence and our acceptance and rejection of sentences. According\nto this connection, whenever it is the case that \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\\), this means (or at least implies) that it\nis incoherent by the lights of theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) to accept\n\\(\\alpha\\) while rejecting \\(\\beta\\) (see\nRestall 2005). Now suppose that, by the lights of a theory\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\), it is incoherent to reject \\(\\alpha\\) and it is also\nincoherent to accept \\(\\alpha\\) while rejecting \\(\\beta\\). Then,\nRipley (2013) argues, there need be nothing incoherent by the theory’s\nlights about rejecting \\(\\beta\\), as long as one doesn’t also\naccept \\(\\alpha\\). There is thus room to give up Trans and adopt a\nweakly detachment-free response to Curry’s paradox.\nBeall’s defense of the strongly detachment-free approach rests\non related considerations. He argues, in effect, that a principle\nweaker than CCP can play the relevant role in constraining the\ncombinations of acceptance and rejection of sentences including\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\\). \nThe approaches to Curry’s paradox just distinguished \nfind fault with different inferences and sub-conclusions of the informal paradoxical argument in \n section 1.1.\nA strongly contraction-free response corresponds to blocking step (3)\nof that argument, since it rejects MP′.  A weakly\ncontraction-free response instead blocks step (4), since it rejects\nCP. Neither kind of detachment-free response will accept the reasoning\nin step (3). Since they accept Cont, detachment-free responses allow\nus to derive the conclusion of (4), whence weakly\ndetachment-free responses further allow us to derive the conclusion of\n(3) by CCP.  However, both kinds of detachment-free response find\nfault with the final move by MP to (6). \nIn this section, we explain some distinctive lessons that can be\nlearned by considering Curry’s paradox. For discussion of the\nkinds of significance that versions of Curry’s paradox share\nwith related paradoxes, see the entries on\n Russell’s paradox\n and the\n Liar paradox. \nStarting with Church (1942), Moh\n(1954), Geach\n(1955), Löb (1955) and Prior\n(1955), discussion of Curry’s\nparadox has emphasized that it differs from Russell’s paradox,\nand the Liar paradox, in that it doesn’t “involv[e]\nnegation essentially” (Anderson 1975:\n 128).[19]\n One reason the negation-free status of Curry’s paradox matters\nis that it renders the paradox resistant to some resolutions that\nmight be adequate for such “negation paradoxes”. \nGeach argues that Curry’s paradox poses a problem for any\nproponents of naive truth theory or naive set theory who, faced with\nnegation paradoxes, \nmight … hope to avoid [these paradoxes] by using a logical system\nin which ‘\\(p\\) if and only if not-\\(p\\)’ were a theorem\nfor some interpretations of ‘\\(p\\)’ without our being able\nto infer thence any arbitrary statement…. (Geach\n1955: 71) \nThe problem, he says, is that Curry’s paradox “cannot be\nresolved merely by adopting a system that contains a queer sort of\nnegation”. Rather, “if we want to retain the naive view of\ntruth, or the naive view of classes …, then we must modify the\nelementary rules of inference relating to ‘if’”\n(1955: 72). Geach’s view of the\nsignificance of Curry’s paradox is closely echoed by Meyer,\nRoutley, and Dunn (1979: 127). They\nconclude that Curry’s paradox frustrates those who had\n“hoped that weakening classical negation principles” would\nresolve Russell’s\n paradox.[20] \nIn short, the point is that there are non-classical logics with weak\nnegation principles that resolve Russell’s paradox and the Liar,\nyet remain vulnerable to Curry’s paradox. These are logics with\nthe following features: \nWhile it is unclear which logics Geach may have had in mind, there are\nindeed non-classical logics that meet these two conditions. Theories\nbased on these logics accordingly remain vulnerable to Curry’s\nparadox. \nMeyer, Routley, and Dunn (1979) call\nattention to one class of logics that meet conditions (a) and (b).\nThey are among the \n  paraconsistent logics, which are logics\naccording to which a sentence together with its negation will \nnot entail any arbitrary sentence. Paraconsistent logics can be used to obtain\ntheories that resolve Russell’s paradox, and the Liar, by\nembracing negation inconsistency without succumbing to triviality. \nAccording to such a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), sentences \\(\\lambda\\) and\n\\(\\lnot\\lambda\\) can be intersubstitutable, as long as both \\(\\vdash\n_{\\mathcal{T}} \\lambda\\) and \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot \\lambda\\).\nSuch theories are “glutty”, in the sense that they affirm\nsome sentence together with its negation (see entry on\n dialetheism).\n Yet a number of prominent paraconsistent logics can’t serve as\nthe basis for Curry-complete theories on pain of triviality. Such\nlogics are sometimes said to fail to be “Curry\nparaconsistent” (Slaney\n 1989).[21] \nMany of the non-classical logics that have been proposed to underwrite\nresponses to Russell’s paradox and the Liar paradox are\nparacomplete logics, logics that reject the law of excluded\nmiddle. These logics make possible “gappy” theories. In\nparticular, where \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\lnot\\lambda\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to such a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), it will\nfail to be the case that \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\lambda \\lor \\lnot\n\\lambda\\). Some of these paracomplete logics likewise meet conditions\n(a) and (b). \nOne example is the logic Ł\\(_{3}\\) based on the three-valued\ntruth-tables of Łukasiewicz (see, e.g.,\nPriest 2008). Since it meets condition (a), Ł\\(_{3}\\)\noffers a possible response to Russell’s paradox and the\nLiar—in particular, a gappy response. Yet consider the\niterated conditional \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}(\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\beta)\\), which we abbreviate as \\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow\n\\beta\\). Suppose that a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and an\nŁ\\(_{3}\\)-based theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is redefined to be any\nsentence \\(\\kappa\\) intersubstitutable with \\(\\kappa \\Rightarrow\n\\pi\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) will meet all the conditions of the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma, as was first noted by Moh\n(1954). Hence, as long as there is a \\(\\kappa\\) that is\nintersubstitutable with \\(\\kappa \\Rightarrow \\pi\\) according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). Consequently\nŁ\\(_{3}\\) won’t underwrite a response to Curry’s\n paradox.[22] \nTo summarize: Curry’s paradox stands in the way of some\notherwise available avenues for resolving semantic paradoxes by means\nof glutty or gappy theories. As a result, the need to evade\nCurry’s paradox has played a significant role in the development\nof non-classical logics (e.g., Priest 2006;\nField 2008). \nThe negation-free status of Curry’s paradox matters for a second\nreason. Prior makes the following important point: \nWe can … say not only that Curry’s paradox does not\ninvolve negation but that even Russell’s paradox presupposes\nonly those properties of negation which it shares with implication.\n(Prior 1955:\n 180)[23] \nWhat he has in mind is that Russell’s paradox and Curry’s\nparadox can be understood as resulting from the same general\nstructure, which can be instantiated either using negation or\nusing a\n conditional.[24] \nThe general structure can be made explicit by defining a type of unary\nconnective that gives rise to Curry’s paradox, and showing how\nthis type is exemplified both by negation and by a unary\nconnective defined in terms of a conditional. \nDefinition 3 (Curry connective)\n Let \\(\\pi\\) be a sentence in the language of\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). The unary connective \\(\\odot\\) is a Curry\nconnective for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) provided it satisfies two\nprinciples: \nGeneralized Curry-Paradox Lemma Suppose that\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is such that Id holds and that for some pair of\nsentences \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mu\\), (i) \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\odot\\mu\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and (ii) \\(\\odot\\) is\na Curry connective for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). In that case\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}}\n \\pi\\).[25] \nProof:  \nThe Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma can now be instantiated in two\ndifferent ways, so as to yield either Curry’s paradox or a\nnegation paradox: \nTo obtain Curry’s paradox, let the unary connective \\(\\odot\\) be\nsuch that \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\), and let\n\\(\\mu\\) be a sentence intersubstitutable with \\(\\mu\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Then P1 amounts to\nthe instance of MP used in our derivation of the Curry-Paradox Lemma,\nwhile P2 is nothing other than our rule Cont. \nTo obtain a negation paradox, let \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) be \\(\\lnot\\alpha\\),\nand let \\(\\mu\\) be a sentence intersubstitutable with \\(\\lnot\\mu\\)\naccording to\n \\(\\mathcal{T}\\).[26]\n Then P1 amounts to an instance of ex contradictione\nquodlibet (or “explosion”), while P2 is a\nreductio principle. \nPrior’s point is that the features of negation that are relevant\nto Russell’s paradox or the Liar paradox are exhausted by\nits status as a Curry connective. This makes clear why these\nparadoxes do not depend on features of negation, such as excluded\nmiddle or double negation elimination, that fail to hold in\nnonclassical theories where negation remains a Curry connective (e.g.,\nin intuitionistic theories, where ECQ and Red both\n hold).[27] \nMoreover, a Curry connective need not be very negation-like at all. It\nmay fail to be even a minimal negation (see entry on\n negation),\n since it need not obey the law of double introduction: \nFor example, suppose that \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is \\(\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\). Then in order for \\(\\odot\\) to obey DI, it would\nhave to be the case that \\(\\alpha \\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} (\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi) {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\). That principle is violated by a\nnumber of non-classical theories for which \\(\\odot\\), when defined\nthis way, does qualify as a Curry\n connective.[28] \nTo summarize: Curry’s paradox points to a general structure\ninstantiated by a wide range of paradoxes. This structure\ndoesn’t itself involve negation, but it is also displayed by\nparadoxes that (unlike Curry’s paradox) do essentially involve\nnegation, such as Russell’s paradox and the Liar paradox. \nThe issue of which paradoxes display a common structure becomes\nimportant in light of the “principle of uniform solution”\ninfluentially advocated by Priest\n(1994). According to this principle, paradoxes that belong to\nthe “same kind” should receive the “same kind of\nsolution”. Suppose that we delimit one kind of paradox as\nfollows: \nDefinition 4 (Generalized Curry paradox) We have a\ngeneralized Curry paradox in any case where the assumptions stated in\nthe Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma appear to hold. \nAssuming one accepts the principle of uniform solution, the question\nbecomes what counts as proposing a uniform solution to all generalized\nCurry paradoxes. In particular, does it suffice to show, for every\ninstance of the kind thus delimited, that what appears to be a Curry\nconnective in fact fails to be one? It would seem that this should\nindeed be enough. It’s unclear why uniformity should\nadditionally require that all seeming Curry connectives fail to\nqualify as such in virtue of violating the same\ncondition. For instance, suppose that negation and our unary\nconnective defined using \\({\\rightarrow}\\) both appear to satisfy the\ngeneralized principle P2, in the former case because \\({\\lnot}\\)\nappears to obey Red and in the latter case because \\({\\rightarrow}\\)\nappears to obey Cont. Unless these two appearances share a common\nsource (e.g., an implicit reliance on structural contraction, as\nclaimed by Zardini 2011), there need be nothing objectionably\nnon-uniform about taking one appearance at face value while dismissing\nthe other as deceptive. (For discussion of the philosophical issue\nhere, applied to a different class of paradoxes, see the exchange in\nSmith 2000 and Priest 2000.) \nIf that is right, the desideratum that generalized Curry paradoxes be\nresolved uniformly needn’t discriminate between the various\nlogically revisionary solutions that have been pursued. These include\nthe following three options: One might hold that it is principle P1 alone that fails when\n\\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is instantiated as \\(\\lnot\\alpha\\) (to get a negation\nparadox), whereas it is P2 alone that fails when \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is\ninstantiated as \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) (to get a Curry paradox).\nOn this approach, ECQ and Cont fail, while Red and MP hold (Priest\n1994, 2006). One might hold that P2 alone fails for both instantiations of\n\\(\\odot\\). On this approach, Red and Cont fail, while ECQ and MP hold\n(Field 2008; Zardini 2011). \nOne might hold that P1 alone fails for both instantiations of\n\\(\\odot\\). On this approach, ECQ and MP fail, while Red and Cont hold\n(Beall 2015; Ripley 2013). \nThus, for example, Priest’s own approach would count as\nresolving Curry’s paradox and the Liar paradox uniformly qua\nexamples of generalized Curry paradox. This would be the case\ndespite the fact that Priest evaluates Liar sentences as both true and\nfalse, whereas he rejects the claim that Curry sentences are true. \nIn any event, Curry’s paradox raises challenges in connection\nwith the issue of what type of uniformity should be required of\nsolutions to various paradoxes (see also Zardini 2015). Priest himself calls attention to a\nkind of paradox narrower than the generalized Curry paradoxes, a kind\nwhose instances include the negation paradoxes but exclude\nCurry’s paradox. This kind is picked out by Priest’s\n“Inclosure Schema” (2002);\nsee the entry on\n self-reference.\n One ongoing dispute is about whether there might be a version of\nCurry’s paradox that counts as an “inclosure\nparadox”, though it resists Priest’s uniform dialetheic\nsolution to such paradoxes (see the exchange in Beall\n2014b, Weber et\nal. 2014, and Beall 2014a, as\nwell as Pleitz 2015). \nThe last decade (as of the date of this version of this entry) has\nwitnessed a boom in attention to Curry paradoxes, and perhaps\nespecially to what have been called validity Curry or\nv-Curry paradoxes (Whittle 2004;\nShapiro 2011; Beall & Murzi\n 2013).[29]\n V-Curry involves Curry sentences that specifically invoke a\ntheory’s consequence or “validity” relation, by\nusing either a conditional or a predicate that purports to express\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)’s relation \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) in the\nlanguage of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) itself. \nFor one form of v-Curry paradox, let the conditional mentioned in the\ndefinition of a Curry sentence\n (Definition 1)\n be a consequence connective \\({\\Rightarrow}\\). A sentence\nwith \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) as its major operator is to be interpreted\nthus: “That \\(p\\) entails (according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)) that\n\\(q\\)”. \nWe now immediately obtain property-theoretic, set-theoretic or\ntruth-theoretic versions of Curry’s paradox, provided only that\n\\({\\Rightarrow}\\) meets the conditions MP and Cont of the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma.  \nWhat makes this instance of the Curry-Paradox\nLemma particularly troublesome is that it poses an obstacle to one\ncommon response to Curry’s paradox, namely the weakly\ncontraction-free response discussed in\n section 4.2.1.\n That response depended on rejecting the rule CP of single-premise\nconditional proof, one direction of the single-premise\n“deduction theorem”. But this is a rule that has seemed\ndifficult to resist for a consequence connective (Shapiro\n2011; Weber 2014; Zardini 2013). If\n\\(\\beta\\) is a consequence of \\(\\alpha\\) according to the consequence\nrelation of theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), where this theory has\n\\({\\Rightarrow}\\) as its own consequence connective, then\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) must surely contain the consequence claim \\(\\alpha\n{\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\). Likewise, this variety of Curry paradox poses an\nobstacle for detachment-free responses, which\nrequire rejecting the rule MP. If a theory with its own consequence\nconnective contains both \\(\\alpha\\) and the consequence conditional\n\\(\\alpha {\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\), then it must surely contain \\(\\beta\\)\nas well. Or so, at least, it has seemed. Admittedly, the proponent of a weakly detachment-free response will argue that MP for \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) illicitly builds in transitivity (see section 4.2.2).\nStill, what seems inescapable is the converse of CP, the rule CCP that is the other direction of the single-premise deduction theorem. If a theory contains the consequence conditional \\(\\alpha {\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\), then surely \\(\\beta\\) follows from \\(\\alpha\\) according to the theory. That would still rule out a strongly detachment-free response. \nA second form of v-Curry paradox arises for a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_V\\)\nwhose subject-matter includes the single-premise consequence relation\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\\) that obtains, according to that very\ntheory, between sentences in its\n language.[30]\n Let this relation be expressed by the predicate \\(Val(x,y)\\), and\nassume further that there is a sentence \\(\\chi\\) that is either\n\\(Val(\\langle\\chi\\rangle, \\langle\\pi\\rangle)\\), or is at least intersubstitutable with the latter according to \\(\\mathcal{T}_V\\). One form of v-Curry\nparadox employs two principles governing \\(Val\\), which we call\n“validity detachment” and “validity proof”\nfollowing Beall & Murzi (2013). \nUsing these principles, we get the following quick argument for\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\). \nAs applied to this predicate form of v-Curry, a weakly\ncontraction-free response would resist the “contraction”\nfrom step 2 to step 4 by rejecting the rule VP, and a\ndetachment-free response would reject VD, even in the zero-premise form used at step 6. Again, though, both\nVP and zero-premise VD have seemed inescapable in view of the intended\ninterpretation of the predicate \\(Val\\) (Beall\n& Murzi 2013; Murzi 2014; Murzi & Shapiro 2015; Priest 2015;\nZardini 2014).[31] \n Finally, even if VD is rejected as illicitly involving transitivity, what seems inescapable is the converse of VP. If so, that would at least rule out a strongly detachment-free response. \nAn arguably more powerful version of v-Curry reasoning is presented by\nShapiro (2013) and Field\n(2017: 7). This reasoning can take either\nconnective or predicate form, but it doesn’t depend on CP or VP.\nHere we give the predicate form using \\(Val\\). As above, we first\nderive that \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\) using VD. In view of the\nmeaning of \\(Val\\), the conclusion that \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\n\\pi\\) shows that \\(Val(\\langle\\chi\\rangle, \\langle\\pi\\rangle)\\) is\ntrue, i.e., that \\(\\chi\\) is true. But if \\(\\chi\\) is true and \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\n\\pi\\), then it would seem\n\\(\\pi\\) must also be true. Since weakly detachment-free\n(nontransitive) responses to v-Curry do allow the derivation of \\(\\chi\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\), this reasoning poses an objection to\nsuch responses as well. \nIf, in fact, v-Curry paradoxes aren’t amenable to weakly\ncontraction-free or strongly detachment-free responses, then (assuming the rule Id is retained) the\nspace of Curry-complete responses is restricted to strongly\ncontraction-free and weakly detachment-free responses.\nThe former responses, as explained in\n section 4.2.1,\n are typically presented by reformulating modus ponens (or detachment for the validity predicate) in a substructural deduction system and rejecting the structural contraction rule sCont. The\nlatter responses, as explained in\n section 4.2.2,\n reject the structural principle of transitivity. For this reason,\nv-Curry paradoxes have sometimes been taken to motivate\nsubstructural consequence relations (e.g.,\nBarrio et al. forthcoming; Beall & Murzi\n2013; Ripley 2015a; Shapiro 2011, 2015).[32] \nThe lively and wide-ranging debate on v-Curry paradoxes has resulted\nin genuine progress in our understanding of Curry paradoxes. In the\nend, what has become clear is that while v-Curry paradoxes may invite\ndifferent resolutions from non-v-Curry paradoxes, they remain within\nthe same mold as generalized Curry paradoxes. In particular, in the\ngeneral template of\n section 5.2\n one may take \\(\\odot\\) to express (either as a predicate or as a\nconnective) consequence in light of \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) itself.\nThis is the heart of v-Curry. Inasmuch as there are (many) different\n(formal) consequence relations definable over our language (e.g.,\nlogical consequence in virtue of logical vocabulary, epistemic\nconsequence in virtue of logical-plus-epistemic vocabulary, and so on)\nthere are thereby many different v-Curry paradoxes that may arise.\nStill, the space of solutions to these paradoxes is the space of\nsolutions to the generalized Curry paradoxes canvassed in this\nentry. \nThere remain, however, at least two reasons v-Curry paradoxes merit\nseparate attention.  First, as noted above, two categories of\nCurry-complete solutions — the weakly contraction-free and\nstrongly detachment-free options — have appeared especially\nproblematic in the case of v-Curry paradoxes. Second, suppose that one\ntreats an ordinary Curry paradox (property-theoretic, set-theoretic or\nsemantic) in a Curry-complete fashion. There may still be reason to\ntreat the corresponding (connective or predicate) v-Curry paradox in a\nCurry-incomplete fashion, perhaps in virtue of seeing a theory’s\nconsequence relation as essentially beyond capture by any connective\nor predicate in the language of the theory (see, e.g., Myhill 1975;\nWhittle 2004). Thus, a “non-uniform” solution to ordinary\nCurry paradoxes and their v-Curry counterparts may — once\nagain — be a motivated\nnon-uniformity.[33]","contact.mail":"lionel.shapiro@uconn.edu","contact.domain":"uconn.edu"},{"date.published":"2017-09-06","date.changed":"2018-01-19","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/curry-paradox/","author1":"Lionel Shapiro","author1.info":"http://shapiro.philosophy.uconn.edu","author2.info":"http://entailments.net","entry":"curry-paradox","body.text":"\n\n\n“Curry’s paradox”, as the term is used by\nphilosophers today, refers to a wide variety of paradoxes of\n self-reference or circularity\n that trace their modern\nancestry to Curry (1942b) and Löb\n (1955).[1]\n The common characteristic of these so-called Curry paradoxes is the\nway they exploit a notion of implication, entailment or consequence,\neither in the form of a connective or in the form of a predicate.\nCurry’s paradox arises in a number of different domains. Like\n Russell’s paradox, it can take\n the form of a paradox of\nset theory or the theory of properties. But it can also take the form\nof a semantic paradox, closely akin to the \n  Liar paradox.\nCurry’s paradox differs from both Russell’s paradox and\nthe Liar paradox in that it doesn’t essentially involve the\nnotion of negation. Common truth-theoretic versions involve a sentence\nthat says of itself that if it is true then an arbitrarily chosen\nclaim is true, or—to use a more sinister instance—says of\nitself that if it is true then every falsity is true. The paradox is\nthat the existence of such a sentence appears to imply the truth of\nthe arbitrarily chosen claim, or—in the more sinister\ninstance—of every falsity. In this entry, we show how the\nvarious Curry paradoxes can be constructed, examine the space of\navailable solutions, and explain some ways Curry’s paradox is\nsignificant and poses distinctive challenges.\n\nSuppose that your friend tells you: “If what I’m saying\nusing this very sentence is true, then time is infinite”. It\nturns out that there is a short and seemingly compelling argument for\nthe following conclusion: \nMany hold that (P) is beyond belief (and, in that sense, paradoxical),\neven if time is indeed infinite. Or, if that isn’t bad enough,\nconsider another version, this time involving a claim known to be\nfalse. Let your friend say instead: “If what I’m saying\nusing this very sentence is true, then all numbers are prime”.\nNow, mutatis mutandis, the same short and seemingly\ncompelling argument yields (Q): \nHere is the argument for\n (P).\n Let \\(k\\) be the self-referential sentence your friend uttered,\nsimplified somewhat so that it reads “If \\(k\\) is true then time\nis infinite”. In view of what \\(k\\) says, we know this much: \nBut, of course, we also have \nUnder the supposition that \\(k\\) is true, we have thus derived a\nconditional together with its antecedent. Using modus ponens\nwithin the scope of the supposition, we now derive the\nconditional’s consequent under that same supposition: \nThe rule of conditional proof now entitles us to affirm a conditional\nwith our supposition as antecedent: \nBut, since (4) just is \\(k\\) itself, we thus have \nFinally, putting (4) and (5) together by modus ponens, we\nget \nWe seem to have established that time is infinite using no assumptions\nbeyond the existence of the self-referential sentence \\(k\\), along with\nthe seemingly obvious principles about truth that took us to (1) and\nalso from (4) to (5). And the same goes for\n (Q),\n since we could have used the same form of argument to reach the false\nconclusion that all numbers are prime. \nOne challenge posed by Curry’s paradox is to pinpoint what goes\nwrong in the foregoing informal argument for\n (P),\n (Q) or the like. But starting with Curry’s initial\npresentation in Curry 1942b (see the supplementary document on \n Curry on Curry’s Paradox), discussion\nof Curry’s paradox has usually had a different focus. It has\nconcerned various formal systems —most often set theories or\ntheories of truth. In this setting what poses the paradox is a proof\nthat the system has a particular feature. Typically, the feature at\nissue is triviality. A theory is said to be trivial, or\nabsolutely inconsistent, when it affirms every claim that is\nexpressible in the language of the\n theory.[2] \nAn argument establishing that a particular formal theory is trivial\nwill pose a problem if either of the following is the case: (i) we\nwish to use the formal theory in our inquiries, as we use set theory\nwhen doing mathematics, or (ii) we wish to use the formal theory in\norder to model features of language or thought, in particular the\nclaims to which some speakers or thinkers are committed. Either way,\nthe target theory’s triviality would show that it is inadequate\nfor its intended purpose. So this is a second challenge posed by\nCurry’s paradox. \nTo spell out the sense in which Curry’s paradox constrains\ntheories we need to say what a Curry sentence is. Informally,\na Curry sentence is a sentence that is equivalent, by the lights of\nsome theory, to a conditional with itself as antecedent. For\nexample, one might think of the argument of\n section 1.1\n as appealing to an informal theory of truth. Then the sentence\n“\\(k\\) is true” serves as a Curry sentence for that\ntheory. That is because, given what our informal theory tells us about\nwhat \\(k\\)’s truth involves, “\\(k\\) is true” should\nbe equivalent to “If \\(k\\) is true, then time is infinite”\n(since this conditional is \\(k\\) itself). \nIn what follows, the notation \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is used\nto say that theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) contains sentence \\(\\alpha\\), and\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is used to say that \\(\\alpha\\)\nfollows from the premises collected in \\(\\Gamma\\) according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) (i.e., according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)’s\nconsequence relation\n \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}}\\)).[3]\n Except in\n section 4.2.1,\n however, we will be concerned only with claims about what follows\naccording to the theory from a single premise, i.e., claims expressed by \nsentences of form\n\\(\\gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\). (We rely on context to make clear \nwhere such a sentence is being used and where it is only being mentioned.) \nTwo sentences (in the language\nof theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)) will be called intersubstitutable\naccording to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) provided the truth of any claim of the\nform \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) is unaffected by\nsubstitutions of one for the other within \\(\\alpha\\) or within any of\nthe sentences in \\(\\Gamma\\). Finally, we assume that the language\ncontains a connective \\({\\rightarrow}\\) that serves, in some suitable\nsense, as a conditional. For purposes of the following definition, we\ndon’t place any specific requirements on the behavior of this\nconditional. We can now define the notion of a Curry sentence for\na sentence-theory pair. \nDefinition 1 (Curry sentence) Let \\(\\pi\\) be a\nsentence of the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). A Curry sentence for\n\\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is any sentence \\(\\kappa\\) such that\n\\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\kappa {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) are intersubstitutable\naccording to\n \\(\\mathcal{T}\\).[4] \nThe various versions of Curry’s paradox arise from the existence\nof arguments in favor of the following very general claim. (These\narguments, which rest on assumptions about the conditional\n\\({\\rightarrow}\\), will be discussed in detail in\n section 3.) \nTroubling Claim For every theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), and\nany sentence \\(\\pi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), if there is a\nCurry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). \nAn argument that appears to establish the Troubling Claim will count\nas paradoxical provided there is also compelling reason to believe\nthat this claim is false. A counterexample to the Troubling Claim\nwould be any theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and sentence \\(\\pi\\) such that\nthere is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) but it is\nnot the case that \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). \nAs noted above, Curry’s paradox is often understood as a\nchallenge to the existence of nontrivial theories. Given the Troubling\nClaim, a theory will be trivial whenever a Curry sentence can be\nformulated for any sentence in the language of the theory.\nIndeed, triviality follows from a weaker condition, which the\nfollowing definition makes explicit. \nDefinition 2 (Curry-complete theory) A theory\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is Curry-complete provided that for every sentence\n\\(\\pi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), there is some \\(\\pi'\\)\nsuch that (i) there is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi'\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and (ii) if \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi'\\) then\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). \nWhile one instance of \\(\\pi'\\) satisfying the condition (ii) would be\n\\(\\pi\\) itself, another instance would be an “explosive”\nsentence \\(\\bot\\) that is contained in a theory only if every\nsentence is contained in the\n theory.[5] \nThe Troubling Claim now has an immediate consequence: a Curry-complete\ntheory must contain every sentence in its language. \nTroubling Corollary Every Curry-complete theory is\ntrivial. \nAgain, any argument that appears to establish the Troubling Corollary\nwill count as paradoxical provided that there is compelling reason to\nbelieve that there are nontrivial theories (indeed true theories) that are\nCurry-complete. \nFor the remainder of this entry, Curry’s paradox will be\nunderstood as imposing a paradoxical constraint on theories, namely\nthe one stated by the above Troubling Corollary. Presenting a version\nof Curry’s paradox, understood this way, involves doing two\nthings: \narguing that \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is Curry-complete, for some apparently\nnontrivial target theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), and \ngiving an argument for the Troubling\n Claim.[6] \nSections\n 2\n and\n 3\n discuss these two tasks in that order. For now, the basic idea can be\nconveyed using the example of the self-referential sentence \\(k\\) that\nreads “If \\(k\\) is true then time is infinite”. First,\ngiven our understanding of truth, we recognize that the sentence\n“\\(k\\) is true” is intersubstitutable with “If \\(k\\)\nis true, then time is infinite”. Second, the informal argument\nof\n section 1.1\n derives a paradoxical conclusion from this equivalence. Readers\nchiefly interested in the logical principles involved in that argument\nand related ones, and the options for resisting such arguments, may\nwish to turn to\n section 3. \nAs it is standardly presented today, Curry’s paradox afflicts\n“naive” truth theories (those featuring a\n“transparent” truth predicate) and “naive” set\ntheories (those featuring unrestricted set abstraction). This section\nwill explain how each kind of theory can give rise to Curry sentences.\nWe start, however, with a version that concerns theories of\n properties, a version that more closely resembles\nCurry’s formulation. (The supplementary document\n Curry on Curry’s Paradox\n briefly characterizes the targets of Curry’s own versions of\nthe paradox.) \nA theory of properties features unrestricted property\nabstraction provided that for any condition statable in the\nlanguage of the theory, there exists a property that (according to the\ntheory) is exemplified by precisely the things that meet this\ncondition. Consider a theory \\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\) formulated in a\nlanguage with a property abstraction device \\([x: \\phi x]\\) and an\nexemplification relation \\(\\epsilon\\). For example, if \\(\\phi(t)\\)\nsays that the object which the term \\(t\\) stands for is triangular,\n\\(t \\ \\epsilon \\ [x: \\phi x]\\) says that this object exemplifies the\nproperty of triangularity. Then, given unrestricted property\nabstraction, we should have the following principle. \n(Property) For every open sentence \\(\\phi\\) with one\nfree variable, and every term \\(t\\), the sentences \\(t \\ \\epsilon \\\n[x: \\phi x]\\) and \\(\\phi t\\) are intersubstitutable according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\). \nIn effect, Curry (1942b) sketches two\n“methods of constructing” Curry sentences using his\ncounterpart of (Property). He says that the first is “based on\nthe Russell paradox”, while the second is “based on the\nEpimenides paradox”. Although both methods are\nproperty-theoretic, the first method yields a precursor of\nset-theoretic versions of Curry’s paradox, while the second\nyields a precursor of truth-theoretic versions. \nThe version of Russell’s paradox which Curry’s\nfirst method resembles is the one that concerns property\nexemplification. Its topic is the property of being such that one\nfails to exemplify oneself. We obtain a property-theoretic Curry\nsentence by considering instead the property of being such that\none exemplifies oneself only if time is infinite. Say that we\nintroduce the name \\(h\\) for that property, by stipulating \\(h =_{def}\n[x: x \\ \\epsilon \\ x {\\rightarrow}\\pi]\\), where the sentence \\(\\pi\\)\nsays that time is\n infinite.[7]\n Applying the principle\n (Property)\n to the sentence \\(h \\ \\epsilon \\ h\\), we find: \n\\(h \\ \\epsilon \\ h\\) and \\(h \\ \\epsilon \\ h {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\). \nIn other words, \\(h \\ \\epsilon \\ h\\) is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\)\nand \\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\). \nCurry’s first method subsequently gave rise to set-theoretic\nCurry sentences. A theory of sets features unrestricted set\nabstraction provided that for any condition statable in the\nlanguage of the theory, there exists a set that (according to the\ntheory) contains all and only the things that meet this condition. Let\n\\(\\mathcal{T_S}\\) be our theory of sets, formulated in a language that\nexpresses set abstraction using \\(\\{ x: \\phi x\\}\\) and set membership\nusing \\(\\in\\). Then the counterpart of\n (Property)\n is \n(Set) For every open sentence \\(\\phi\\) with one free\nvariable, and every term \\(t\\), the sentences \\(t \\in \\{ x: \\phi x\\}\\)\nand \\(\\phi t\\) are intersubstitutable according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T_S}\\). \nTo obtain a set-theoretic Curry sentence, consider the set consisting\nof anything that is a member of itself only if time is infinite. Say\nthat we introduce the name \\(c\\) for that set, by stipulating \\(c\n=_{def} \\{ x: x \\in x {\\rightarrow}\\pi \\}\\). Applying the principle\n (Set)\n to the sentence \\(c \\in c\\), we find: \n\\(c \\in c\\) and \\(c \\in c {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) are intersubstitutable\naccording to \\(\\mathcal{T_S}\\). \nIn other words, \\(c \\in c\\) is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{T_S}\\). \nThe set-theoretic version of Curry’s paradox was introduced in\nFitch\n 1952[8]\n and is also presented in Moh 1954 and\nPrior 1955. \nDespite his remark about the “Epimenides paradox”, a form\nof the Liar paradox, Curry’s second method is a variant\nof a related semantic paradox, Grelling’s\n paradox.[9]\n In its original form, Grelling’s paradox considers a property\npossessed by many words, namely the property a word has when it\nfails to exemplify the property it stands for (Grelling\n& Nelson 1908). For example, the\nword “offensiveness” has that property: it fails to\nexemplify the property it stands for, since it isn’t offensive\n(see entry on\n paradoxes and contemporary logic).\n In effect, Curry considers instead the property a word has provided\nit exemplifies the property it stands for only if time is\ninfinite. Now suppose that our theory introduces a name \\(u\\) for\nthis property. Curry then shows how to construct a sentence that\n(speaking informally) says that the name \\(u\\) exemplifies the\nproperty it stands for. He shows that this sentence will serve as a\nCurry sentence for a theory of properties and the denotation of\n names.[10] \nThough this method of obtaining a Curry sentence is based on a\nsemantic feature of expressions, it still relies on property\nabstraction. Nonetheless, it can be viewed as a precursor to a wholly\nsemantic version. (Rather than consider the above-introduced property,\none could consider the predicate “applies to itself only if time\nis infinite”.) Accordingly, as Geach\n(1955) and Löb (1955) were\nthe first to show, Curry sentences can be obtained using semantic\nprinciples alone, without any reliance on property abstraction. Their\nroute corresponds to the informal argument, in\n section 1.1,\n involving the self-referential sentence \\(k\\) that reads “If\n\\(k\\) is true then time is infinite.” \nFor this purpose, let \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\) be a theory of truth, where\n\\(T\\) is the truth predicate. Assume the “transparency”\nprinciple \n(Truth) For every sentence \\(\\alpha\\), the sentences\n\\(T\\langle \\alpha \\rangle\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) are intersubstitutable\naccording to \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\). \nTo obtain a Curry sentence using this principle, assume there is a\nsentence \\(\\xi\\) that is \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\n {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\).[11]\n Then it follows immediately from (Truth) that \n\\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) and \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\)\nare intersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\). \nIn other words, \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) is a Curry sentence for\n\\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T_T}\\). \nGeach notes that the semantic paradox that results from a sentence\nlike \\(T\\langle \\xi \\rangle\\) resembles “the Curry paradox in\nset theory”. Löb, who doesn’t mention Curry’s\nwork, credits the paradox to a referee’s observation about the\nproof of what is now known as Löb’s theorem concerning\nprovability (see entry on\n Gödel’s incompleteness theorems).\n The referee, now known to have been Leon Henkin (Halbach\n& Visser 2014: 257), suggested\nthat the method Löb used in his proof “leads to a\nnew derivation of paradoxes in natural language”, namely the\ninformal argument of\n section 1.1\n above.[12] \nSuppose that we have used one of the above methods to show, for some\ntheory of truth, sets, or properties, that the theory is\nCurry-complete (in virtue, say, of containing a Curry sentence for\neach sentence of the language, or for an explosive sentence). To\nconclude that the theory in question is trivial, it now suffices to\ngive an argument for the Troubling Claim. This is the claim that for\nevery theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), if there is a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\)\nand \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). Such an\nargument will make use of assumptions about the logical behavior of\nthe conditional \\({\\rightarrow}\\) mentioned in\n Definition 1.\n Assuming the Troubling Claim must be resisted, this accordingly\nplaces constraints on the behavior of this conditional. \nTo start, here is a very general limitative result, a close variant of\nthe Lemma in Curry\n 1942b.[13] \nCurry-Paradox Lemma Suppose that theory\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and sentence \\(\\pi\\) are such that (i) there is a\nCurry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), (ii) all instances of\nthe identity rule (Id) \\(\\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\) hold,\nand (iii) the conditional \\({\\rightarrow}\\) satisfies both of the\nfollowing principles: \nThen \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). \nHere MP is a version of modus ponens, and Cont is a principle\nof contraction: two occurrences of the sentence \\(\\alpha\\)\nare “contracted” into one. (We will soon encounter related\nprinciples that are more commonly referred to as\n contraction.[14]) The\nCurry-Paradox Lemma entails that any Curry-complete theory must\nviolate one or more of Id, MP or Cont on pain of triviality. \nTo prove the Lemma one shows that Id, MP and Cont, together with the\n“Curry-intersubstitutivity” of \\(\\kappa\\) with \\(\\kappa\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\), suffice to establish \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\).\nThe following derivation resembles the informal argument of\n section 1.1.\n That argument also included a subargument for the principle Cont,\nwhich will be examined below. \n\n Section 4\n will discuss ways in which each of the two principles concerning\n\\({\\rightarrow}\\) assumed in the Curry-Paradox Lemma might be\njustified or rejected. \nThere are counterparts of the Curry-Paradox Lemma that invoke\nalternative sets of logical principles (see, e.g., Rogerson\n& Restall 2004 and Bimbó\n2006). Probably the most common\nversion replaces the rules Id and Cont with corresponding\nlaws: \nThe derivation now goes as follows: \nA second common counterpart of the Curry-Paradox Lemma is due to Meyer,\nRoutley, and Dunn\n (1979).[15]\n It uses two principles concerning conjunction: the law form of\nmodus ponens and the idempotency of conjunction. \nThis time the derivation goes as follows: \nFormulating the Curry-Paradox Lemma using Cont, rather than ContL or\nMPL, will make it easier to call attention (in the next section) to\nsignificant differences within the class of responses that reject both\nof the latter\n principles.[16] \nResponses to Curry’s paradox can be divided into two classes,\nbased on whether they accept the Troubling Corollary that all\nCurry-complete theories are trivial. \nCurry-incompleteness responses accept the Troubling\nCorollary. However, they deny that the target theories of properties,\nsets or truth are Curry-complete. Curry-incompleteness responses can,\nand usually do, embrace classical logic. \nCurry-completeness responses reject the Troubling Corollary;\nthey insist that there can be nontrivial Curry-complete theories. Any\nsuch theory must violate one or more of the logical principles assumed\nin the Curry-Paradox Lemma. Since classical logic validates those\nprinciples, these responses invoke a non-classical\n logic.[17] \nThere is also the option of advocating a Curry-incompleteness response\nto Curry paradoxes arising in one domain, say set theory, while\nadvocating a Curry-completeness response to Curry paradoxes arising in\nanother domain, say property theory (e.g.,\nField 2008; Beall 2009). \nExamples of prominent theories of truth that supply\nCurry-incompleteness responses to Curry’s paradox include\nTarski’s hierarchical theory, the \n  revision theory of truth\n (Gupta & Belnap 1993) and the\ncontextualist approaches (Burge\n1979, Simmons 1993, and \nGlanzberg 2001, 2004). These theories all\nrestrict the “naive” transparency principle\n (Truth).\n For an overview, see the entry on the \n  Liar paradox. In the\ncontext of set theory Curry-incompleteness responses include\nRussellian type theories and various theories that restrict the\n“naive” set abstraction principle\n (Set).\n See the entries on\n Russell’s paradox\n and\n alternative axiomatic set theories. \nIn general, the considerations relevant to evaluating most\nCurry-incompleteness responses don’t appear to be specific to\nCurry’s paradox, but pertain equally to the Liar paradox (in the\ntruth-theoretic domain) and Russell’s paradox (in the set- and\nproperty-theoretic\n domains).[18]\n For that reason the rest of this entry will focus on Curry-completeness\nresponses, though\n section 6.3\n briefly returns to the distinction in the context of so-called\nvalidity Curry paradoxes. \nCurry-completeness responses to Curry’s paradox hold that there\nare theories that are Curry-complete yet nontrivial; such a theory\nmust violate one or more of the logical principles assumed in the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma. Since the rule Id has generally been left\nunquestioned (but see French 2016 and Nicolai\n& Rossi forthcoming), this has meant denying that the\nconditional \\({\\rightarrow}\\) of a nontrivial Curry-complete theory\nsatisfies both MP and Cont. Accordingly, responses have fallen into\ntwo categories. \nEach category of Curry-completeness responses can in turn be\nsubdivided according to how it blocks purported derivations of Cont\nand MP. \nThe principle Cont that is rejected by contraction-free responses\nfollows from two standard principles. These are single-premise\nconditional proof and a slightly more general version of modus\nponens, involving at most one premise \\(\\gamma\\): \nContraction-free responses must thus reject one or the other of these\ntwo principles for the conditional of a nontrivial Curry-complete\ntheory. Accordingly, two subcategories of theorists in category (I)\ncan be identified: \nThe reason why responses in category (Ib) only count as\nweakly contraction-free is that, as steps 1-3 show, they\naccept the contraction principle according to which if \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\\) then \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\\). \nProponents of strongly contraction-free responses hold that MP′\ndoesn’t properly express the relevant form of modus\nponens. They typically present their own form of that rule\n in a “substructural” framework, specifically one that lets us\ndistinguish between what follows from a premise taken once\nand what follows from the same premise taken twice. (See entry on\n substructural logics.)\nAccordingly, MP′ needs to be replaced by \nand the rule of “structural contraction” needs to be\nrejected: \nIt is because they reject structural contraction that strongly contraction-free \napproaches can claim to preserve\nmodus ponens despite rejecting MP′ (see Shapiro 2011, Zardini 2013, and Ripley 2015a). \nStrongly contraction-free responses also need to block a derivation of\nMP′ using a pair of principles involving conjunction: \nAvoiding this derivation of MP′ requires denying that there is a\nconjunction \\(\\wedge\\) that obeys both MP′\\(_{\\wedge}\\) and\nIdem\\(_{\\wedge}\\). According to many strongly contraction-free\nresponses (e.g., Mares & Paoli 2014;\nZardini 2011), one kind of conjunction—the\n“multiplicative” kind, or “fusion”—obeys MP′\\(_{\\wedge}\\)\nbut not Idem\\(_{\\wedge}\\), whereas another kind—the\n“additive” kind—obeys Idem\\(_{\\wedge}\\) but not\nMP′\\(_{\\wedge}\\) (see entry on\n linear logic,\n and Ripley 2015a).\nIf the substructural framework discussed above is used, the failure of MP′\\(_{\\wedge}\\) amounts to the fact that for additive conjunction, \n\\(\\gamma, \\delta \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\\) is not equivalent to \\(\\gamma \\wedge \\delta \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\\). \nAs for weakly contraction-free responses, the failure of CP has\nsometimes been motivated using “worlds” semantics of the\nsort that involve a distinction between logically possible\nand impossible worlds (e.g., Beall\n2009; Nolan 2016). To refute CP we need the truth of \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_\\mathcal{T} \\beta\\) and the falsity of \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\n\\alpha{\\rightarrow}\\beta\\). On the target “worlds”\napproaches \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) is defined as truth preservation\nover a proper subset of worlds (in a model), namely, the\n“possible worlds” of the model. Hence, for \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_\\mathcal{T} \\beta\\) to be true is for there to be no possible\nworld (in any model) at which \\(\\alpha\\) is true and \\(\\beta\\) untrue.\nIn turn, to refute \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\alpha{\\rightarrow}\\beta\\) we\nneed a possible world at which \\(\\alpha{\\rightarrow}\\beta\\) is untrue.\nHow does that happen? Because connectives are defined in a way that\ntakes account of all (types of) worlds in the model (possible\nand, if there be any, impossible) there’s an option for\n\\(\\alpha{\\rightarrow}\\beta\\) to be untrue at a possible world in\nvirtue of \\(\\alpha\\) being true and \\(\\beta\\) being untrue at an\nimpossible world. And that’s just what happens on the\ntarget approaches. (Exactly how one defines the truth-at-a-world and\nfalsity-at-a-world conditions for the arrow depends on the exact\n“worlds” approach at issue.) \nDetachment-free responses must block a straightforward derivation of\nMP based on a principle of transitivity together with the converse of single-premise\nconditional proof: \nThere are two subcategories of theorists in category (II): \nThe reason why responses in category (IIb) are only weakly\ndetachment-free is that CCP, which these responses accept, can be\nregarded as a kind of detachment principle for the conditional. \nOne strategy for replying to the charge that detachment-free responses\nare counterintuitive has been to appeal to a connection between\nconsequence and our acceptance and rejection of sentences. According\nto this connection, whenever it is the case that \\(\\alpha\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\\), this means (or at least implies) that it\nis incoherent by the lights of theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) to accept\n\\(\\alpha\\) while rejecting \\(\\beta\\) (see\nRestall 2005). Now suppose that, by the lights of a theory\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\), it is incoherent to reject \\(\\alpha\\) and it is also\nincoherent to accept \\(\\alpha\\) while rejecting \\(\\beta\\). Then,\nRipley (2013) argues, there need be nothing incoherent by the theory’s\nlights about rejecting \\(\\beta\\), as long as one doesn’t also\naccept \\(\\alpha\\). There is thus room to give up Trans and adopt a\nweakly detachment-free response to Curry’s paradox.\nBeall’s defense of the strongly detachment-free approach rests\non related considerations. He argues, in effect, that a principle\nweaker than CCP can play the relevant role in constraining the\ncombinations of acceptance and rejection of sentences including\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\\). \nThe approaches to Curry’s paradox just distinguished \nfind fault with different inferences and sub-conclusions of the informal paradoxical argument in \n section 1.1.\nA strongly contraction-free response corresponds to blocking step (3)\nof that argument, since it rejects MP′.  A weakly\ncontraction-free response instead blocks step (4), since it rejects\nCP. Neither kind of detachment-free response will accept the reasoning\nin step (3). Since they accept Cont, detachment-free responses allow\nus to derive the conclusion of (4), whence weakly\ndetachment-free responses further allow us to derive the conclusion of\n(3) by CCP.  However, both kinds of detachment-free response find\nfault with the final move by MP to (6). \nIn this section, we explain some distinctive lessons that can be\nlearned by considering Curry’s paradox. For discussion of the\nkinds of significance that versions of Curry’s paradox share\nwith related paradoxes, see the entries on\n Russell’s paradox\n and the\n Liar paradox. \nStarting with Church (1942), Moh\n(1954), Geach\n(1955), Löb (1955) and Prior\n(1955), discussion of Curry’s\nparadox has emphasized that it differs from Russell’s paradox,\nand the Liar paradox, in that it doesn’t “involv[e]\nnegation essentially” (Anderson 1975:\n 128).[19]\n One reason the negation-free status of Curry’s paradox matters\nis that it renders the paradox resistant to some resolutions that\nmight be adequate for such “negation paradoxes”. \nGeach argues that Curry’s paradox poses a problem for any\nproponents of naive truth theory or naive set theory who, faced with\nnegation paradoxes, \nmight … hope to avoid [these paradoxes] by using a logical system\nin which ‘\\(p\\) if and only if not-\\(p\\)’ were a theorem\nfor some interpretations of ‘\\(p\\)’ without our being able\nto infer thence any arbitrary statement…. (Geach\n1955: 71) \nThe problem, he says, is that Curry’s paradox “cannot be\nresolved merely by adopting a system that contains a queer sort of\nnegation”. Rather, “if we want to retain the naive view of\ntruth, or the naive view of classes …, then we must modify the\nelementary rules of inference relating to ‘if’”\n(1955: 72). Geach’s view of the\nsignificance of Curry’s paradox is closely echoed by Meyer,\nRoutley, and Dunn (1979: 127). They\nconclude that Curry’s paradox frustrates those who had\n“hoped that weakening classical negation principles” would\nresolve Russell’s\n paradox.[20] \nIn short, the point is that there are non-classical logics with weak\nnegation principles that resolve Russell’s paradox and the Liar,\nyet remain vulnerable to Curry’s paradox. These are logics with\nthe following features: \nWhile it is unclear which logics Geach may have had in mind, there are\nindeed non-classical logics that meet these two conditions. Theories\nbased on these logics accordingly remain vulnerable to Curry’s\nparadox. \nMeyer, Routley, and Dunn (1979) call\nattention to one class of logics that meet conditions (a) and (b).\nThey are among the \n  paraconsistent logics, which are logics\naccording to which a sentence together with its negation will \nnot entail any arbitrary sentence. Paraconsistent logics can be used to obtain\ntheories that resolve Russell’s paradox, and the Liar, by\nembracing negation inconsistency without succumbing to triviality. \nAccording to such a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), sentences \\(\\lambda\\) and\n\\(\\lnot\\lambda\\) can be intersubstitutable, as long as both \\(\\vdash\n_{\\mathcal{T}} \\lambda\\) and \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot \\lambda\\).\nSuch theories are “glutty”, in the sense that they affirm\nsome sentence together with its negation (see entry on\n dialetheism).\n Yet a number of prominent paraconsistent logics can’t serve as\nthe basis for Curry-complete theories on pain of triviality. Such\nlogics are sometimes said to fail to be “Curry\nparaconsistent” (Slaney\n 1989).[21] \nMany of the non-classical logics that have been proposed to underwrite\nresponses to Russell’s paradox and the Liar paradox are\nparacomplete logics, logics that reject the law of excluded\nmiddle. These logics make possible “gappy” theories. In\nparticular, where \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\lnot\\lambda\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to such a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), it will\nfail to be the case that \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\lambda \\lor \\lnot\n\\lambda\\). Some of these paracomplete logics likewise meet conditions\n(a) and (b). \nOne example is the logic Ł\\(_{3}\\) based on the three-valued\ntruth-tables of Łukasiewicz (see, e.g.,\nPriest 2008). Since it meets condition (a), Ł\\(_{3}\\)\noffers a possible response to Russell’s paradox and the\nLiar—in particular, a gappy response. Yet consider the\niterated conditional \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}(\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\beta)\\), which we abbreviate as \\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow\n\\beta\\). Suppose that a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and an\nŁ\\(_{3}\\)-based theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is redefined to be any\nsentence \\(\\kappa\\) intersubstitutable with \\(\\kappa \\Rightarrow\n\\pi\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) will meet all the conditions of the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma, as was first noted by Moh\n(1954). Hence, as long as there is a \\(\\kappa\\) that is\nintersubstitutable with \\(\\kappa \\Rightarrow \\pi\\) according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). Consequently\nŁ\\(_{3}\\) won’t underwrite a response to Curry’s\n paradox.[22] \nTo summarize: Curry’s paradox stands in the way of some\notherwise available avenues for resolving semantic paradoxes by means\nof glutty or gappy theories. As a result, the need to evade\nCurry’s paradox has played a significant role in the development\nof non-classical logics (e.g., Priest 2006;\nField 2008). \nThe negation-free status of Curry’s paradox matters for a second\nreason. Prior makes the following important point: \nWe can … say not only that Curry’s paradox does not\ninvolve negation but that even Russell’s paradox presupposes\nonly those properties of negation which it shares with implication.\n(Prior 1955:\n 180)[23] \nWhat he has in mind is that Russell’s paradox and Curry’s\nparadox can be understood as resulting from the same general\nstructure, which can be instantiated either using negation or\nusing a\n conditional.[24] \nThe general structure can be made explicit by defining a type of unary\nconnective that gives rise to Curry’s paradox, and showing how\nthis type is exemplified both by negation and by a unary\nconnective defined in terms of a conditional. \nDefinition 3 (Curry connective)\n Let \\(\\pi\\) be a sentence in the language of\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). The unary connective \\(\\odot\\) is a Curry\nconnective for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) provided it satisfies two\nprinciples: \nGeneralized Curry-Paradox Lemma Suppose that\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is such that Id holds and that for some pair of\nsentences \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mu\\), (i) \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\odot\\mu\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and (ii) \\(\\odot\\) is\na Curry connective for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). In that case\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}}\n \\pi\\).[25] \nProof:  \nThe Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma can now be instantiated in two\ndifferent ways, so as to yield either Curry’s paradox or a\nnegation paradox: \nTo obtain Curry’s paradox, let the unary connective \\(\\odot\\) be\nsuch that \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\), and let\n\\(\\mu\\) be a sentence intersubstitutable with \\(\\mu\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Then P1 amounts to\nthe instance of MP used in our derivation of the Curry-Paradox Lemma,\nwhile P2 is nothing other than our rule Cont. \nTo obtain a negation paradox, let \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) be \\(\\lnot\\alpha\\),\nand let \\(\\mu\\) be a sentence intersubstitutable with \\(\\lnot\\mu\\)\naccording to\n \\(\\mathcal{T}\\).[26]\n Then P1 amounts to an instance of ex contradictione\nquodlibet (or “explosion”), while P2 is a\nreductio principle. \nPrior’s point is that the features of negation that are relevant\nto Russell’s paradox or the Liar paradox are exhausted by\nits status as a Curry connective. This makes clear why these\nparadoxes do not depend on features of negation, such as excluded\nmiddle or double negation elimination, that fail to hold in\nnonclassical theories where negation remains a Curry connective (e.g.,\nin intuitionistic theories, where ECQ and Red both\n hold).[27] \nMoreover, a Curry connective need not be very negation-like at all. It\nmay fail to be even a minimal negation (see entry on\n negation),\n since it need not obey the law of double introduction: \nFor example, suppose that \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is \\(\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\). Then in order for \\(\\odot\\) to obey DI, it would\nhave to be the case that \\(\\alpha \\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} (\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi) {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\). That principle is violated by a\nnumber of non-classical theories for which \\(\\odot\\), when defined\nthis way, does qualify as a Curry\n connective.[28] \nTo summarize: Curry’s paradox points to a general structure\ninstantiated by a wide range of paradoxes. This structure\ndoesn’t itself involve negation, but it is also displayed by\nparadoxes that (unlike Curry’s paradox) do essentially involve\nnegation, such as Russell’s paradox and the Liar paradox. \nThe issue of which paradoxes display a common structure becomes\nimportant in light of the “principle of uniform solution”\ninfluentially advocated by Priest\n(1994). According to this principle, paradoxes that belong to\nthe “same kind” should receive the “same kind of\nsolution”. Suppose that we delimit one kind of paradox as\nfollows: \nDefinition 4 (Generalized Curry paradox) We have a\ngeneralized Curry paradox in any case where the assumptions stated in\nthe Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma appear to hold. \nAssuming one accepts the principle of uniform solution, the question\nbecomes what counts as proposing a uniform solution to all generalized\nCurry paradoxes. In particular, does it suffice to show, for every\ninstance of the kind thus delimited, that what appears to be a Curry\nconnective in fact fails to be one? It would seem that this should\nindeed be enough. It’s unclear why uniformity should\nadditionally require that all seeming Curry connectives fail to\nqualify as such in virtue of violating the same\ncondition. For instance, suppose that negation and our unary\nconnective defined using \\({\\rightarrow}\\) both appear to satisfy the\ngeneralized principle P2, in the former case because \\({\\lnot}\\)\nappears to obey Red and in the latter case because \\({\\rightarrow}\\)\nappears to obey Cont. Unless these two appearances share a common\nsource (e.g., an implicit reliance on structural contraction, as\nclaimed by Zardini 2011), there need be nothing objectionably\nnon-uniform about taking one appearance at face value while dismissing\nthe other as deceptive. (For discussion of the philosophical issue\nhere, applied to a different class of paradoxes, see the exchange in\nSmith 2000 and Priest 2000.) \nIf that is right, the desideratum that generalized Curry paradoxes be\nresolved uniformly needn’t discriminate between the various\nlogically revisionary solutions that have been pursued. These include\nthe following three options: One might hold that it is principle P1 alone that fails when\n\\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is instantiated as \\(\\lnot\\alpha\\) (to get a negation\nparadox), whereas it is P2 alone that fails when \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is\ninstantiated as \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) (to get a Curry paradox).\nOn this approach, ECQ and Cont fail, while Red and MP hold (Priest\n1994, 2006). One might hold that P2 alone fails for both instantiations of\n\\(\\odot\\). On this approach, Red and Cont fail, while ECQ and MP hold\n(Field 2008; Zardini 2011). \nOne might hold that P1 alone fails for both instantiations of\n\\(\\odot\\). On this approach, ECQ and MP fail, while Red and Cont hold\n(Beall 2015; Ripley 2013). \nThus, for example, Priest’s own approach would count as\nresolving Curry’s paradox and the Liar paradox uniformly qua\nexamples of generalized Curry paradox. This would be the case\ndespite the fact that Priest evaluates Liar sentences as both true and\nfalse, whereas he rejects the claim that Curry sentences are true. \nIn any event, Curry’s paradox raises challenges in connection\nwith the issue of what type of uniformity should be required of\nsolutions to various paradoxes (see also Zardini 2015). Priest himself calls attention to a\nkind of paradox narrower than the generalized Curry paradoxes, a kind\nwhose instances include the negation paradoxes but exclude\nCurry’s paradox. This kind is picked out by Priest’s\n“Inclosure Schema” (2002);\nsee the entry on\n self-reference.\n One ongoing dispute is about whether there might be a version of\nCurry’s paradox that counts as an “inclosure\nparadox”, though it resists Priest’s uniform dialetheic\nsolution to such paradoxes (see the exchange in Beall\n2014b, Weber et\nal. 2014, and Beall 2014a, as\nwell as Pleitz 2015). \nThe last decade (as of the date of this version of this entry) has\nwitnessed a boom in attention to Curry paradoxes, and perhaps\nespecially to what have been called validity Curry or\nv-Curry paradoxes (Whittle 2004;\nShapiro 2011; Beall & Murzi\n 2013).[29]\n V-Curry involves Curry sentences that specifically invoke a\ntheory’s consequence or “validity” relation, by\nusing either a conditional or a predicate that purports to express\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)’s relation \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) in the\nlanguage of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) itself. \nFor one form of v-Curry paradox, let the conditional mentioned in the\ndefinition of a Curry sentence\n (Definition 1)\n be a consequence connective \\({\\Rightarrow}\\). A sentence\nwith \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) as its major operator is to be interpreted\nthus: “That \\(p\\) entails (according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)) that\n\\(q\\)”. \nWe now immediately obtain property-theoretic, set-theoretic or\ntruth-theoretic versions of Curry’s paradox, provided only that\n\\({\\Rightarrow}\\) meets the conditions MP and Cont of the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma.  \nWhat makes this instance of the Curry-Paradox\nLemma particularly troublesome is that it poses an obstacle to one\ncommon response to Curry’s paradox, namely the weakly\ncontraction-free response discussed in\n section 4.2.1.\n That response depended on rejecting the rule CP of single-premise\nconditional proof, one direction of the single-premise\n“deduction theorem”. But this is a rule that has seemed\ndifficult to resist for a consequence connective (Shapiro\n2011; Weber 2014; Zardini 2013). If\n\\(\\beta\\) is a consequence of \\(\\alpha\\) according to the consequence\nrelation of theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), where this theory has\n\\({\\Rightarrow}\\) as its own consequence connective, then\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) must surely contain the consequence claim \\(\\alpha\n{\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\). Likewise, this variety of Curry paradox poses an\nobstacle for detachment-free responses, which\nrequire rejecting the rule MP. If a theory with its own consequence\nconnective contains both \\(\\alpha\\) and the consequence conditional\n\\(\\alpha {\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\), then it must surely contain \\(\\beta\\)\nas well. Or so, at least, it has seemed. Admittedly, the proponent of a weakly detachment-free response will argue that MP for \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) illicitly builds in transitivity (see section 4.2.2).\nStill, what seems inescapable is the converse of CP, the rule CCP that is the other direction of the single-premise deduction theorem. If a theory contains the consequence conditional \\(\\alpha {\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\), then surely \\(\\beta\\) follows from \\(\\alpha\\) according to the theory. That would still rule out a strongly detachment-free response. \nA second form of v-Curry paradox arises for a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_V\\)\nwhose subject-matter includes the single-premise consequence relation\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\\) that obtains, according to that very\ntheory, between sentences in its\n language.[30]\n Let this relation be expressed by the predicate \\(Val(x,y)\\), and\nassume further that there is a sentence \\(\\chi\\) that is either\n\\(Val(\\langle\\chi\\rangle, \\langle\\pi\\rangle)\\), or is at least intersubstitutable with the latter according to \\(\\mathcal{T}_V\\). One form of v-Curry\nparadox employs two principles governing \\(Val\\), which we call\n“validity detachment” and “validity proof”\nfollowing Beall & Murzi (2013). \nUsing these principles, we get the following quick argument for\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\). \nAs applied to this predicate form of v-Curry, a weakly\ncontraction-free response would resist the “contraction”\nfrom step 2 to step 4 by rejecting the rule VP, and a\ndetachment-free response would reject VD, even in the zero-premise form used at step 6. Again, though, both\nVP and zero-premise VD have seemed inescapable in view of the intended\ninterpretation of the predicate \\(Val\\) (Beall\n& Murzi 2013; Murzi 2014; Murzi & Shapiro 2015; Priest 2015;\nZardini 2014).[31] \n Finally, even if VD is rejected as illicitly involving transitivity, what seems inescapable is the converse of VP. If so, that would at least rule out a strongly detachment-free response. \nAn arguably more powerful version of v-Curry reasoning is presented by\nShapiro (2013) and Field\n(2017: 7). This reasoning can take either\nconnective or predicate form, but it doesn’t depend on CP or VP.\nHere we give the predicate form using \\(Val\\). As above, we first\nderive that \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\) using VD. In view of the\nmeaning of \\(Val\\), the conclusion that \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\n\\pi\\) shows that \\(Val(\\langle\\chi\\rangle, \\langle\\pi\\rangle)\\) is\ntrue, i.e., that \\(\\chi\\) is true. But if \\(\\chi\\) is true and \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\n\\pi\\), then it would seem\n\\(\\pi\\) must also be true. Since weakly detachment-free\n(nontransitive) responses to v-Curry do allow the derivation of \\(\\chi\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\), this reasoning poses an objection to\nsuch responses as well. \nIf, in fact, v-Curry paradoxes aren’t amenable to weakly\ncontraction-free or strongly detachment-free responses, then (assuming the rule Id is retained) the\nspace of Curry-complete responses is restricted to strongly\ncontraction-free and weakly detachment-free responses.\nThe former responses, as explained in\n section 4.2.1,\n are typically presented by reformulating modus ponens (or detachment for the validity predicate) in a substructural deduction system and rejecting the structural contraction rule sCont. The\nlatter responses, as explained in\n section 4.2.2,\n reject the structural principle of transitivity. For this reason,\nv-Curry paradoxes have sometimes been taken to motivate\nsubstructural consequence relations (e.g.,\nBarrio et al. forthcoming; Beall & Murzi\n2013; Ripley 2015a; Shapiro 2011, 2015).[32] \nThe lively and wide-ranging debate on v-Curry paradoxes has resulted\nin genuine progress in our understanding of Curry paradoxes. In the\nend, what has become clear is that while v-Curry paradoxes may invite\ndifferent resolutions from non-v-Curry paradoxes, they remain within\nthe same mold as generalized Curry paradoxes. In particular, in the\ngeneral template of\n section 5.2\n one may take \\(\\odot\\) to express (either as a predicate or as a\nconnective) consequence in light of \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) itself.\nThis is the heart of v-Curry. Inasmuch as there are (many) different\n(formal) consequence relations definable over our language (e.g.,\nlogical consequence in virtue of logical vocabulary, epistemic\nconsequence in virtue of logical-plus-epistemic vocabulary, and so on)\nthere are thereby many different v-Curry paradoxes that may arise.\nStill, the space of solutions to these paradoxes is the space of\nsolutions to the generalized Curry paradoxes canvassed in this\nentry. \nThere remain, however, at least two reasons v-Curry paradoxes merit\nseparate attention.  First, as noted above, two categories of\nCurry-complete solutions — the weakly contraction-free and\nstrongly detachment-free options — have appeared especially\nproblematic in the case of v-Curry paradoxes. Second, suppose that one\ntreats an ordinary Curry paradox (property-theoretic, set-theoretic or\nsemantic) in a Curry-complete fashion. There may still be reason to\ntreat the corresponding (connective or predicate) v-Curry paradox in a\nCurry-incomplete fashion, perhaps in virtue of seeing a theory’s\nconsequence relation as essentially beyond capture by any connective\nor predicate in the language of the theory (see, e.g., Myhill 1975;\nWhittle 2004). Thus, a “non-uniform” solution to ordinary\nCurry paradoxes and their v-Curry counterparts may — once\nagain — be a motivated\nnon-uniformity.[33]","contact.mail":"jc.beall@uconn.edu","contact.domain":"uconn.edu"}]
