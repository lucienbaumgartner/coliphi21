Typical levels of organization that\none finds in the literature include the atomic, molecular, cellular,\ntissue, organ, organismal, group, population, community, ecosystem,\nlandscape, and biosphere levels. References to levels of organization\nand related hierarchical depictions of nature are prominent in the\nlife sciences and their philosophical study, and appear not only in\nintroductory textbooks and lectures, but also in cutting-edge research\narticles and reviews. In philosophy, perennial debates such as\nreduction, emergence, mechanistic explanation, interdisciplinary\nrelations, natural selection, and many other topics, also rely\nsubstantially on the notion.\n\n\nYet, in spite of the ubiquity of the notion, levels of organization\nhave received little explicit attention in biology or its philosophy.\nUsually they appear in the background as an implicit conceptual\nframework that is associated with vague intuitions. Attempts at\nproviding general and broadly applicable definitions of levels of\norganization have not met wide acceptance. In recent years, several\nauthors have put forward localized and minimalistic accounts of\nlevels, and others have raised doubts about the usefulness of the\nnotion as a whole. \n\n\nThere are many kinds of ‘levels’ that one may find in\nphilosophy, science, and everyday life—the term is notoriously\nambiguous. Besides levels of organization, there are levels of\nabstraction, realization, being, analysis, processing, theory,\nscience, complexity, and many others. In this article, the focus will\nbe on levels of organization and debates associated with them, and\nother kinds of levels will only be discussed when they are relevant to\nthis main topic.\n\nWhen levels of organization are understood as belonging to the broader\ncategory of hierarchical depictions of nature, their history can be\ntraced all the way back to the early days of western science and\nphilosophy. Aristotle suggested that living things could be arranged\nin a graded scale, starting from plants at the bottom and ending with\nhumans at the top. This idea was further developed in Neoplatonism,\nand in Medieval times, it transformed into the idea of “the\nGreat Chain of Being” (Lovejoy 1936). This Scala\nNaturae conveyed a hierarchical conception of the world as\nmodeled after the perfection of the Deity: at the top, there is God,\nand at lower rungs, angels, humans, animals, plants, and so on. After\nthe scientific revolution, more scientific classifications of nature\nstarted to appear, the most famous ones being Linneaus’\ntaxonomical system and Auguste Comte’s hierarchy of the sciences\n(Comte 1842 [1853]). \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, several notions of\n“levels” began to circulate in the philosophical and\nscientific literature. Prominent among these was the idea of\n“levels of existence” (alternatively: “being”;\n“complexity”) developed by philosophers Samuel Alexander\n(1920: 3, 45) and Charles Dunbar Broad (1925), which figured\nprominently in the emergentist and emergent evolution literature of\nthe 1920’s (Sellars 1926; McLaughlin 1992; Stephan 1999). This\nintroduced a number of themes that have become germane to general\nlevels-language. These themes include level-specific laws (Broad 1925:\n77; cf. Woodger 1929) and the idea that ‘levels’ exhibit a\ntendency in nature towards increasing complexity (Sellars 1917: 224;\ncf. Needham 1937), Although most of these themes were severely\nunderdeveloped and divorced from the cutting-edge work in the life\nsciences happening at the time (Needham 1937: 242 ff. 4), this\ntradition has been an influential historical source for explicating\nlevels language in philosophy of mind (see the entries on\n emergent properties\n and\n supervenience;\n McLaughlin 1992; Beckermann et al. 1992; Kim 1999, 2002). \nThe roots of the contemporary notion of levels of organization and the\nassociated hierarchical thinking are best linked to the efforts of\norganicist biologists of the early-mid 20th century (for\nprimers on the organicist movement, see Peterson 2014; Nicholson and\nGawne 2015). Particularly important to the introduction and\ndevelopment of the levels concept were Joseph Woodger (1929, 1930),\nLudwig von Bertalanffy (1928 [1933], 1932), and Joseph Needham (1936,\n1937). These individuals were in turn influenced by Alfred North\nWhitehead’s philosophy (see, e.g., Whitehead 1929; Needham\n1941). \nOrganicism (alternatively “organismal” or\n“organismic” biology) did not designate a clearly-defined\ngroup of people, but rather a loosely-threaded confluence of\nscientists and philosophers distributed among many disciplines and\nacross Europe and the Americas. The organicists (like the\nemergentists) were in part responding to the dispute between the\nmechanists and the neovitalists of the early 20th century.\nThe mechanists held that biological phenomena were “nothing over\nand above” their physico-chemical components, meaning that\nbiological phenomena can in principle, and eventually will, be\nexhaustively accounted for in chemical or physical terms (Loeb 1912,\n1916). They also argued that biological phenomena, though seemingly\ncomplex, are fundamentally similar to machines (Loeb 1912, 1916; see\nalso Allen 2005: 264; Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010: 17];\nNicholson 2012: 160). Neovitalists such as Hans Driesch and Henri\nBergson rejected these ideas, arguing that living things cannot be\nexplained solely based on their physico-chemical components, and that\nbiological phenomena therefore must involve non-physical forces or\nentities. The organicists sought to offer a “third way”\ninto the mechanist-vitalist dispute that served as a middle ground\nbetween the austerity of the mechanists and the extravagance of the\nneovitalists (Peterson 2014: 286; Nicholson & Gawne 2015:\n358). \nThree major tenets of organicism were particularly congenial to the\ndevelopment of the levels concept. Firstly, the central preoccupation\nof organicist thought with organization laid down a\nfoundation for levels thinking (cf. Nicholson & Gawne 2015: 364).\nFor the organicists, organization marked the decisive feature for\ndemarcating living phenomena from non-living physico-chemical\nphenomena (e.g., Woodger 1929: 290–1; von Bertalanffy 1928\n[1933: 48]; Needham 1936: ch. 1). Unlike the neovitalists, however,\nthe organicists (particularly during the 1930’s) did not hold\norganization to be inscrutable, but rather an important explanandum of\nbiological study (Nicholson & Gawne 2015: 365). Moreover, living\norganisms exhibited a hierarchical ordering among their\ndistinct parts (Woodger 1930: 8; von Bertalanffy 1932: 83; Needham\n1936: ch. 5; see also Nicholson & Gawne 2015: 366). This combined\nnicely with the focus on organization as the major explanandum of\nbiology in that the series of elements that compose different\norganisms required specific and contextualized treatment. This in turn\ncomplemented another main tenet of the organicists, namely the\nautonomy of biology as a natural science and its phenomena from\nphysico-chemical phenomena (cf. Nicholson & Gawne 2015:\n366–7). \nThe levels concept proved to be a linchpin of these main tenets.\nJoseph Woodger, combining these features, thus expresses the basic\nthinking behind levels of organization: \nTwo principal factors appear to have been responsible for the failure\nto take organization seriously in biology. First there is the vague\nbelief that only atoms and molecules are ‘real’, and\nsecondly the incautious use of the notion of chemical composition.\nAlso the biological entities are found to be composite in the same\nsense, and moreover, some of the relata in the relation of composition\nin the physico-chemical objects are also relata in the biological\nobjects. But the analysis of organisms as carried out by\nbiologists reveal other relata in mutual relation of\ncomposition in a different sense, i.e., not in\nchemical composition, e.g., the organism is analysable\ninto organ-systems, organs, tissues, cells and cell-parts. There is a\nhierarchy of composing parts or relata in a hierarchy of organizing\nrelations. These relations and relata can only be studied at\ntheir own levels (cf. the quartz crystal) and not simply in\nterms of the lower levels. (Woodger 1929: 292–293,\nemphasis modified; cf. Bertalanffy 1932: 100–101; Needham 1937\n[1943: 234]) \nUnlike the emergentists’ “levels of existence,” the\nhierarchical view of the world expounded by the organicists emphasized\ndifferentiating the many distinct classes of matter’s\npossible forms to accommodate the diversity in biological entities.\nThis in turn led them to posit many more levels in the world than the\nfour ‘super levels’ of the emergentists (the physical the\nchemical, the vital, and the mental), and also implied an increase in\ncomplexity as more levels of organization were brought to bear on\ntreating living systems. Woodger again remarks: \nIf the parts [of an organism] were homogeneous then we should be able\nto call them units and there would only be one level of organization.\nBut if each part were itself composed of parts forming in each an\norganized system, then clearly we should have two levels of\norganization and if the composing sub-parts of the first organization\nwere intrinsically only numerically different we could speak of two\nhomogeneous levels of organization. If, however, the sub-parts were\nintrinsically different then the first-order parts would be different\nand we should have a heterogeneous type of organization. By carrying\nout this process of subdivision further we could obtain very complex\ntypes of organization exhibiting a hierarchy of successive levels. And\nif now we consider one of the higher living organisms it is evident at\nonce that its organization will belong to one of these heterogeneous\nhierarchical types. (Woodger 1929: 298) \nThis idea that levels of organization of organization form\n“nested” compositional hierarchies where there are wholes\nat higher levels and their components at lower levels, and the\ncomponents themselves can be further decomposed into parts, remains\none of the core features of the notion of levels of organization up to\nthis day. \nIn the aftermath of organicism, development of the levels concept\nsplintered into different intellectual trajectories, with little\noverall theoretical or conceptual coherence. One direction of\ndevelopment flowed through the framework of general systems theory\n(von Bertalanffy 1950, 1968), and particularly through so-called\nhierarchy theory (Whyte et al. 1969; Weiss 1971; Pattee 1973). General\nsystems theory sought to construct isomorphisms between laws of\ndifferent scientific fields based on their generic system properties\n(von Bertalanffy 1950: 136), but nonetheless continued to emphasize\nthe hierarchical structure of systems (von Bertalanffy 1968). ‘Levels of organization’ in\nthis tradition was ultimately given secondary consideration to the\narticulation of system-generic properties and laws. Similarly, in\nhierarchy theory, ‘levels’ tend to be treated as\nderivative of the more general notion of a hierarchy, or the ordering\nof a system into nested subsystems (Simon 1962 [1996: 184–5];\nsee also Weiss 1971). Hierarchy and levels alike continued to be\ntreated as generic structures of systems of all stripes (see also\nAllen & Starr 1982; O’Neill et al. 1986). However, one important\ndistinction to come out of this tradition was the distinction between\nlevels of composition and levels of control (Simon 1962; Pattee 1973).\nThe former speaks to the nested compositionality typically identified\nwith levels of organization, while the latter refers to the idea that\nhigher levels impose constraints on the processes at lower levels, for\nexample by limiting the degrees of freedom of the system at a lower\nlevel (Pattee 1973: 85). \nOther early attempts at clarifying the concept of levels were carried\nout by individual researchers working alone on similar or related\nissues, such as reduction or multilevel selection. Mario Bunge (1960,\n1977), Marjorie Grene (1969, 1987), and William Wimsatt (1976a, 1981, 1994) each\ndeveloped several ground-laying observations concerning levels. Bunge\n(1960) remarks on the plethora of meanings the term can possess, then\noffers a long taxonomy of nine different meanings of the term\n“levels”, ranging from the innocuous (levels as degrees or\nquantity, as in ‘levels of stress’) to the sense of nature\nbeing ordered into an evolutionary series, with several corollary\nsenses of levels falling between (such as degrees of complexity). In\nhis 1977 paper, Bunge goes further, offering a set-theoretic treatment\nof levels, and claiming that the leveled structure of the natural\nworld is what renders natural phenomena intelligible to us (Bunge\n1977: R82). Grene (1969) also remarks on the polysemic nature of the\nterm “hierarchy”, noting that ‘levels’ has\ndistinct uses in different fields of sciences. Grene later (1987)\ndistinguishes between two notions of hierarchy, one falling under a\nmixed notion of levels as composition and control, respectively, and\nthe other exemplifying phylogenetic ranks. Wimsatt’s work will\nbe considered in more detail below in section 2.3. \nA recurring motif in the literature on levels of organization is to\nlament the haphazard or unreflective way in which terms such as\n‘hierarchy’ or ‘levels’ are applied, and to\ncall for more precise analyses (e.g., Beckner 1974; Bunge 1977; Grene\n1987; Korn 2002; Valentine & May 1996). However, surprisingly few\nphilosophers or scientists have taken up the challenge of developing a\nsubstantial theory or account of levels of organization. In this\nsection, we discuss three major accounts put forward in philosophy of\nscience to clarify or posit what exactly levels of organization are.\nThese are Paul Oppenheim and Hilary Putnam’s\n“layer-cake” account, the mechanist account developed and\nadvocated by Carl Craver (2007: ch. 5, 2015) and William Bechtel\n(2008: ch. 4), and William Wimsatt’s “local maxima”\naccount (1976a, 1994). After\nthese, we also go through recent skeptical approaches to the idea of\nlevels of organization. \nThe two most visible accounts in philosophy of science, the\n“layer-cake” and “mechanistic” accounts, mark\npolarized visions for the levels concept. The layer-cake account\ncomprises a comprehensive conception that posits exhaustive stepwise\ncompositional relations between all constituents of nature and strict\ncorrespondence between each putative level and a primary scientific\ndiscipline that studies the constituents occupying that level. The\nmechanistic account proposes a contextualized conception of\nontological levels in nature that are defined in terms of constitutive\nparthood within a mechanism (Craver 2007: 188–189; Kaplan 2015:\n20). The third account, Wimsatt’s “local maxima”\naccount, has arguably received less mainstream attention in\nphilosophy, and posits a more overarching framework for\nconceptualizing levels in science, covering both epistemic and\nontological aspects. Though general, Wimsatt’s account is not\ncomprehensive, admitting exceptions and multiple distinct criteria for\ncharacterizing levels that are congenial to both local and global\nconceptions. \nIn the classic paper “The Unity of Science as a Working\nHypothesis” (1958; see also the entry\n the unity of science),\n Oppenheim and Putnam (hereafter O&P) put forward a system of\nlevels that became very influential, and is still implicitly present\nin most references to levels. This “layer-cake” model\ncomprises three components. First, their conception of levels was\ncomprehensive, meaning they wished to subsume all instances\nof where one could talk of ‘levels’ into their account.\nSecond, O&P posited that levels are related via compositional\nrelations that are structured in a stepwise fashion. That is,\nall constituents of the objects of study of one branch of science, or,\nthe branch’s “universe of discourse,” are\nexhaustively related as wholes to the parts located at the next\nadjacent lower level, and as themselves parts to the constituents\noccurring at the next adjacent higher level. This component is\nprobably most responsible for the “layer-cake” moniker,\nwhich continues to appear in discussions of levels even today.\nFinally, O&P presumed a strict correspondence between the\nconstituents comprising a level and the predicates and theories linked\nwith these constituents, meaning that levels of science neatly map\nonto levels of nature, so that for each level in nature there is\ncorresponding science or theory and vice versa (Craver 2007:\n174–175; Brigandt 2010: 304–305). \nO&P’s usage of ‘levels’ can be broken down into\ntwo roles within their framework. The first concerns their use of\n‘levels’ in their explication of reduction, i.e.,\nmicroreduction, which in turn aided in articulating their thesis of\nunity of science. O&P’s conception of reduction spans three\ncomplementary notions: \nKemeny-Oppenheim reduction is understood as an indirect\nrelation between a reducing theory (or branch of science) T1 and\nreduced theory (or branch) T2 relative to a set of observational data\nsuch that (a) both theories contain different vocabulary, (b) T1\nexplains least as much observational data as T2, but (c) T1 also\n“explains more” than T2 (1958: 5). The notion of a\npotential microreducer supplements this by capturing the\npart-whole coordination between the natural entities constituting the\nuniverses of discourse of different scientific theories or branches\nvia exhaustive material compositional relations (1958: 6). This\nessentially provides an empirical mapping between the two scientific\nbranches. Microreduction then combines these two, and thus\namounts to a Kemeny-Oppenheim reduction between two scientific\ntheories plus the fact that T1 is at a lower compositional level than\nT2. \nIn this framework, O&P suggest ordering the branches of sciences\nso that the major potential reductions standing between the current\nsituation and unified science can be identified. For this purpose,\nthey propose six “reductive levels” (1958: 9): Social\ngroups; (Multicellular) living things; Cells; Molecules; Atoms;\nElementary particles. The branch of science with the things of a given\nlevel as its universe of discourse is a potential microreducer of a\nbranch with the things of the next higher level as its universe of\ndiscourse (O&P 1958: 9). \nO&P’s second use of levels concerns the justificatory role\nthe concept plays for their framework. This role is anticipated by\nO&P’s ideas of microreduction and potential microreducer,\nand requires positing ‘levels’ as existing independent of\nthe other elements of their framework. More precisely: The O&P\naccount of reduction essentially assumes the existence of certain\nempirical facts captured by potential microreducers, which are then\naccounted for, i.e., justified, by postulating the existence of\n‘levels’. O&P considered this dual\nepistemic-ontological importance of ‘levels’ to be a\nsignificant contribution provided by their layer-cake account apart\nfrom its role in explicating microreduction. Speaking to the epistemic\nordering of the sciences, they say: \nThe idea of reductive levels employed in our discussion suggests what\nmay plausibly be regarded as a natural order of sciences. For\nthis purpose, it suffices to take as ‘fundamental\ndisciplines’ the branches corresponding to our levels. It is\nunderstandable that many of the well-known orderings of things have a\nrough similarity to our reductive levels, and that corresponding\norderings of sciences are more or less similar to our order of 6\n‘fundamental disciplines’. (O&P 1958: 28, emphasis\nadded) \nThis shows that O&P assumed that the structure of the sciences\nfollows the structure of nature. Though they acknowledge the numerous\nprecedents to this hierarchical ordering of the sciences (e.g.,\nComte’s pyramid of the sciences, 1958: 28), O&P considered\ntheir layer-cake account to be superior to these other\n“intuitive” senses of the order of sciences, since the\nexistence of levels themselves are grounded in the stepwise,\ncompositional continuity of nature:  \n[I]t does not seem to have been realized that these orderings are\n‘natural’ in a deeper sense, of being based on the\nrelation of potential micro-reducer obtaining between the branches of\nscience. (1958: 28) \nThe problems with the layer-cake account have been well-documented\n(Craver 2007: 172–6; Eronen 2015; Kim 2002; Potochnik &\nMcGill 2012; Rueger & McGivern 2010). For one thing, if we look at\ncontemporary science, the strict correspondence between levels and\nscientific fields breaks down immediately: Fields such as cognitive\nneuroscience span multiple levels, and the level of multicellular\norganisms is studied by a plethora of different scientific disciplines\n(Craver 2005; Bechtel 2008: 145). Likewise, the exhaustive stepwise\ncondition on compositional relations between natural constituents,\nrequiring that entities at one level are composed of only entities at\nthe next lower level, is largely a caricature (e.g., Kim 2002): think\nof blood, nominally a tissue-level phenomenon, which is directly\ncomposed by molecular constituents such as vitamins and water without\nadjacent-level constituents, e.g., cells, playing any intermediary\nrole (Brooks 2017). Finally, and most importantly, the layer-cake\naccount aspires to a comprehensive notion of ‘levels’ that\nis wildly at odds with the way that ‘levels’ is actually\nused in science. Scientists often operate with a much more limited\ndefinition of the levels concept that either (a) is restricted to a\nspecific and local context (see section 2.2) or (b) makes room for\nexceptions to what ‘levels’ expresses. Many biological\nsources in fact are completely aware that levels do not capture a\ncompletely uniform reality, and sometimes remark on important\nexceptions to the rules that are laid down by the levels concept. This\nis most prominently seen when referring to “organisms” in\na piecemeal way so as to capture both multicellular and unicellular\nforms of life (Mader 2010: 2). \nThe account of “levels of mechanisms” introduced by Bill\nBechtel (2008) and Carl Craver (2007) has recently become the standard\nview of levels in philosophy of neuroscience. The context of this\naccount is the paradigm of “new mechanism” that currently\ndominates philosophy of neuroscience and large parts of philosophy of\nscience more generally (see the entry\n mechanisms in science).\n In levels of mechanisms, there are mechanisms at higher levels and\ntheir components at lower levels. The mechanistic account proposes a\ncontextualized conception (as opposed to the comprehensive conception\nof the layer-cake) that articulates levels in terms of constitutive\nparthood within a mechanism (Craver 2007: 188–189; Kaplan 2015:\n20; see also Cummins 1975 for an early expression of this idea). This\napproach offers several advantages over the layer-cake account: For\none thing, it abandons the goal of providing a global or comprehensive\nunderstanding of levels that applies homogeneously to all systems in\nnature. Instead, the aim is to construe levels in a scientifically\ninformed manner whereby level demarcations only make sense on\ncase-based grounds (see also Love 2012 for a local approach to levels\nthat is not explicitly tied to the notion of a mechanism). The\nmechanistic account also completely eschews any tidy correspondence\nbetween the structure of the natural world and the structure of the\nnatural sciences: Levels of mechanisms are levels in nature,\nand there is no straightforward mapping from these levels to theories\nor fields of science (Craver 2007: 176). Finally, the mechanistic\naccount of levels supports a positive account of pluralistic,\nmultilevel explanation that emerges as a powerful alternative to\naccounts of reductionism in biology (Craver 2005; cf. Brigandt 2010:\n297). \nMore specifically, levels of mechanisms have been defined as\nfollows: \nIn levels of mechanisms, the relata are behaving mechanisms at higher\nlevels and their components at lower levels. … The interlevel\nrelationship is as follows: X’s Φ-ing is at a lower\nmechanistic level than Ψ-ing if and only if X’s Φ-ing is\na component in the mechanism for S’s Ψ-ing. Lower level\ncomponents are organized together to form higher-level components.\n(Craver 2007: 189) \nWithin a mechanism, the relevant parts are … working\nparts—the parts that perform the operations that enable the\nmechanism to realize the phenomenon of interest. These may be of\ndifferent sizes, but they are distinguished by the fact that they\nfigure in the functioning of the mechanism. It is the set of working\nparts that are organized and whose operations are coordinated to\nrealize the phenomenon of interest that constitute a level. (Bechtel\n2008: 146) \nSo far, these characterizations suggest that there are just two\nlevels, the level of the mechanism and the level of its components.\nHowever, when we take into account that a component can also be\nmechanism in itself, this picture is expanded into a multilevel\nhierarchy: The components of that nested mechanism then form a third\nlevel, which is two levels lower than the overall mechanism (Bechtel\n2008: 147). This mechanistic decomposition can be repeated as many\ntimes as necessary; there is no a priori limit to the number of levels\nin a mechanism.  \nThe standard example of levels of mechanisms is the case of spatial\nmemory and long-term potentiation (LTP; Craver 2007: 165–170).\nIn the spatial memory mechanism, four levels of mechanisms can be\nidentified: the level of spatial memory, the level of spatial map\nformation, the cellular-electrophysiological level, and finally the\nmolecular level. In this hierarchy, entities at each lower level are\ncomponents in the higher-level mechanism. For example, an NMDA\nreceptor at the molecular level is a component of the LTP mechanism at\nthe cellular level, and the LTP mechanism is in turn a component of\nthe hippocampal mechanism of memory consolidation (at the level of\nspatial map formation). The hippocampal mechanism of memory\nconsolidation then contributes to the overall mechanism at the level\nof spatial memory, which is the highest level and includes things such\nas the mouse performing behavioral tasks (e.g., navigating a water\nmaze). \nLevels of mechanisms share some key features with the more standard\naccounts of levels of organization: They are by definition\ncompositional, entities at higher levels are typically larger than\nentities at lower levels, and levels of mechanisms can potentially\namount to local peaks of regularity and predictability (Craver 2007:\n190; see next section). However, levels of mechanisms are far more\nlimited and minimalistic than any other extant approaches to levels of\norganization. First of all, as already mentioned, levels of mechanisms\ncan only be identified on a case-by-case basis, and different\nmechanisms can have entirely different levels. For example, the set of\nlevels in the mechanism of protein folding is very different from the\nlevels in the spatial memory mechanism. \nMoreover, even within one mechanism, the question whether two items\nare at the same or different levels often has no well-defined answer.\nThis is due to the fact that levels are defined solely in terms of\ndirect part-whole (or component-mechanism) relationships. For example,\nNMDA receptors and synaptic vesicles are components of the cellular\nLTP mechanisms, and thus can be said to be at the same level. The\ncomponents of NMDA receptors in turn include things such as glutamate\nbinding sites and glutamate ions, whereas the components of synaptic\nvesicles include things such as transport proteins. However, as\nglutamate binding sites and transport proteins are neither components\nof one another nor direct components in the same (sub)mechanism, they\nare neither at the same level nor at different levels (Bechtel 2008:\n147). The question how they are related levels-wise has no answer in\nthe mechanistic framework. What this means is that even within a\nspecific mechanism, levels of mechanisms do not form horizontal layers\nthat span across the mechanism, but rather small islands or spotlights\nformed by the working parts of a (sub)mechanism. Another implication\nis that even identical things (e.g., NMDA molecules) in the same\nmechanism are often not at the same level (Eronen 2013). Recently\nCraver (2015) has argued that the whole idea of being “at the\nsame level” is in fact unimportant or even meaningless in the\ncontext of levels of mechanisms; it is sufficient that there is a\nclear sense in which mechanisms are at a higher level relative to\ntheir components (and the components are at a lower level relative to\nthe mechanism as a whole), and this does not require that the\ncomponents or mechanisms also form horizontal levels.  \nA further problem that the mechanistic account shares with the\nlayer-cake account is that it is embedded within a conceptual\nframework where ‘levels’ are defined in terms of other\ntechnical terms that are more foundational in that framework (Brooks\n2017). For instance, the layer-cake account was originally embedded in\nOppenheim and Putnam’s overarching project of arguing for the\nunity of science, and their understanding of ‘levels’ was\noriginally in part conceived to explicate how microreduction works.\nThe mechanistic account for its part is embedded within the New\nMechanism’s program of explicating mechanistic explanation and\nmechanisms; since “levels of mechanisms” largely overlap\nwith technical terms that define what a mechanism is, it is a\nlegitimate question what distinct notion of ‘levels’\nresults at all that is not directly derivable from the notion of a\nmechanism (cf. Eronen 2013). \nIn this light, it is clear that levels of mechanisms are only\ndistantly related to earlier attempts at elucidating levels in the\nlife sciences, and have many features that we intuitively would not\nassociate with the idea of levels (Eronen 2013, 2015). However, there\nis no doubt that the relationships of mechanistic composition that\nlevels of mechanisms track are as such crucially important for\nunderstanding and explaining biological organization. \nMarie Kaiser (2015) seeks to recover a more general notion of\n‘levels’ along the lines of the mechanistic account in a\nway that escapes the account’s restrictiveness. Kaiser’s\nfocus here is to relax the conditions under which we consider\nsomething a level (2015: 183–185): First, instead of defining\nlevels in terms of working components of mechanisms, she suggests to\nthink of levels in terms of (biological) part-whole relations\ngenerally, that is, in a way that is not derived from the\ndefinition of a mechanism. Second, Kaiser suggests that a level can\nalso include things that belong to the same “general biological\nkind” as some parts of the higher-level system in question\n(2015: 183–185): In this way, levels expand beyond the\nboundaries of an organism or mechanism. How this approach avoids the\nproblems of general levels of organization discussed below (section\n2.4) has not been explicitly spelled out. For further attempts at\nexpanding or developing the notion of levels of mechanisms, see\nBertolaso & Buzzoni (2017) and Harbecke (2015). \nBoth the layer-cake and the mechanistic approach to levels aim at\ndefining levels in the sense of giving at least necessary conditions\nfor what constitutes a level. William Wimsatt (1976a, 1994) takes a different approach\nand sets out to characterize the key features that levels of\norganization typically (but not necessarily) exhibit across different\ninstances. His aim is to delineate major structural or organizational\nfeatures of nature, of which levels of organization are the most\nsalient ones. First, levels are compositional and form nested\nhierarchical structures, so that wholes at lower levels function as\nparts at higher levels. Second, levels of organization are a  \ndeep, non-arbitrary, and extremely important feature of the\nontological architecture of our natural world, and almost certainly of\nany world which could produce, and be inhabited or understood by,\nintelligent beings. (Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 203])  \nIn other words, Wimsatt considers levels to be units that “cut\nnature at its joints” (1976a: 237). \nA further feature of levels of organization is that they are  \nconstituted by families of entities usually of comparable size and\ndynamical properties, which characteristically interact primarily with\none another. (Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 204])  \nA helpful metaphor that Wimsatt uses to illustrate this is that we can\nthink of theories or models of specific levels as sieves of different\nsizes that sift out things with the appropriate size and dynamical\nproperties (Wimsatt 1976a: 237). Thus, theories at the levels of\norganisms sift out roughly organism-sized things that are capable of\nreproduction and primarily interact with each other. \nFinally, and perhaps most importantly,  \n[l]evels of organization can be thought of as local maxima of\nregularity and predictability in the phase space of alternative modes\nof organization of matter. (1976a: 209; see also 1976a: 238)  \nThis point is “the closest that [Wimsatt] will come to a\ndefinition” (1976a: 209), and requires some explanation. The\nidea is roughly that patterns and regularities that can be used as a\nbasis for prediction and explanation are found clustered around\ncertain scales, and such clusters indicate levels of organization.\nThus, if we plot regularity and predictability against (size) scale,\nthen levels of organization will appear as peaks in the plot (see\nFigure). The entities that we find at these “local maxima”\nwill exhibit stable regularities in virtue of the criteria (size,\nrate, dynamic properties, etc.) with which they are grouped into\nlevels, and these regularities can also serve as the basis for\nreliable predictability. Moreover, levels of organization comprise\n“the most probable states of matter” (1976a:\n239), meaning that if we could vary the initial conditions, under a\nrange of conditions natural selection or other selection processes\nwould result in the same levels (Wimsatt 1976a: 238–239). For\nexample, if the level of molecules is a level of organization in\nWimsatt’s sense, then there should be a peak in regularity and\npredictability at the scale(s) where molecules are located, and\nmolecules should be the most probable mode of organization of matter\nunder a range of conditions.  \nFigure. Wimsatt, created in 1973; used\nwith permission. \nWimsatt points out many other features that levels may have: For\nexample, processes at higher levels tend to happen at slower rates\nthan processes at lower levels, higher level properties are typically\nmultiply realized by lower level properties, and higher-level causal\nrelationships are dynamically autonomous in the sense of being largely\nindependent of what happens at lower-levels. What differentiates\ndifferent levels will also vary between instances, and may include\npart-whole distinctions, the magnitudes of forces by which things\ninteract, or, pragmatically, considerations of size of different\nconstituents. Importantly, Wimsatt also argues that in contexts where\npart-whole relationships become too complex, such as in the\norganization of biological systems, levels of organization break down,\nand in these cases a more appropriate organizational notion is\n“perspective” (Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 227]). Perspectives are\n(incomplete) accounts of systems based on a set of variables, and in\ncontrast to levels, need not have any part-whole structure. For\nexample, we can approach organisms from anatomical, physiological or\ngenetic perspectives, each perspective coming with a proprietary set of\nvariables. \nBy including so many caveats and possible but unnecessary\ncharacteristics of levels, Wimsatt makes his account extremely\nversatile and wide in scope, but at the same time open to charges of\nvagueness or inconsistency (cf. Craver 2007: 182–183). It\ncontains a multitude of criteria that levels could but do not\nnecessarily have to satisfy, so that almost any set of entities that\nare in some respect similar to one another could be said to form a\nlevel. Moreover, the individual criteria as such also raise many\nquestions. For example, how should we understand the “local\nmaxima of regularity and predictability”? What kinds of\nregularities should we include—only causal generalizations, or\nalso regularities describing associational or compositional relations\n(Craver 2007: 182–183)? How do we count or\nestimate the number of regularities on a given scale? How do these\npeaks match with the other proposed criteria, such as the part-whole\norganization of levels? \nThese worries are to some extent alleviated by taking into account an\nimportant background idea in Wimsatt’s approach: Levels of\norganization and the entities that occupy them should be\nrobust, meaning that they should be detectable, measurable,\nderivable, definable, and so on, in a variety of independent\nways (1981 [2007: 63–4]; 1994 [2007: 210]). In other words, they\nshould exhibit redundancy between independent means of accessing,\ndetecting or defining them, and therefore should not depend on any\nsingle criterion or defining feature. Thus, if levels of organization\nare robust, the choice of criteria, or the problems of some individual\ncriterion, will not be crucial. However, the extent to which there are\nsuch robust levels of organization in nature remains an open\nquestion. \nDespite the familiarity of scientists and philosophers with the levels\nconcept, calls for its dismissal or de-emphasis in the scientific\nlexicon are increasingly common (Eronen 2013, 2015; Guttman 1976;\nLadyman & Ross 2007;\nPotochnik & McGill 2012; Rueger & McGivern 2010; Thalos 2013;\nfor rebuttals see also DiFrisco 2017; Brooks 2017). For one thing,\nnature may simply be too messy to fit any layer-cake style picture.\nConsider as an illustration the putative level of\n“organisms.” Blue whales and yeast cells are both clearly\norganisms and thus should nominally be located at this level, but each\ncomprises radically different kinds of entities with radically\ndifferent properties (Potochnik & McGill 2012). This may still be\npalatable, but when we consider the next lower level, namely the one\nindicated by the components of these organisms, the picture of levels\nas neat horizontal layers breaks down completely. The components of\nblue whales include things such as organs, tissues and cells, whereas\nyeast cells are composed of things like the cell membrane, nucleus and\nmitochondria (cf. Potochnik & McGill 2012). Furthermore, the whale\nis in part composed of various symbionts, including gut bacteria. Such\nsymbionts are at the same time components of the whale and organisms\nin themselves. Thus, the components of different kinds organisms do\nnot form any homogeneous “level”. \nThese problems are not just due to the difficulties of defining what\nan organism is. Similar issues arise when we consider the components\nof cells, such as the cell membrane and mitochondria—their\nsubcomponents (e.g, lipid molecules and the outer mitochondrial\nmembrane respectively) also exhibit too much heterogeneity to form a\nneat “level” (cf. Eronen 2013). Moreover, the same kinds\nof things can be parts in very different higher-level wholes: For\nexample, hydrogen ions can be free-standing components in the\noxidative phosphorylation mechanism that involves the cell membrane as\na component, but they can also be components of the lipid molecules\nthat make up the cell membranes (Bechtel 2008: 147). \nMore generally, Potochnik and McGill (2012) argue that\n‘levels’ imposes a radically false, rigid uniformity onto\nnature: \nThe basic idea [behind ‘levels’] is that\nhigher-level entities are composed of (and only of)\nlower-level entities, but the prevalent concept of hierarchical\norganization involves stronger claims as well. The compositional\nhierarchy is often taken to involve stratification into discrete\nand universal levels of organization. It is also often assumed\nthat levels are nested, that is, that an entity at any level is\ncomposed of aggregated entities at the next lower level.\n(Potochnik & McGill 2012: 121; emphasis added) \nThis identifies these problem with the “basic idea” of the\nlevels concept itself. They continue: \nIndeed, the very notion of stratified levels depends on not\nonly the ubiquity, but also the uniformity, of part-whole composition.\nFor strata to emerge, atoms must always compose molecules, populations\nmust always compose communities, and so forth. But the uniformity of\ncomposition needed for stratified levels simply does not\nexist. (2012: 126; emphasis added; see also Guttman 1976: 113;\nThalos 2013: 10) \nThis comprehensive, uniform rigidity in turn undermines other features\nattributed to levels of organization. One of these features is the\nsupposed epistemic merit (or fault) inherently exhibited by natural\nconstituents due to their position at a particular level (Potochnik\n& McGill 2012. 129–30). For instance, reductionists\nfrequently argue that molecular-level explanations are generally more\nsecure, more fundamental, or otherwise superior to explanations citing\nhigher-level structures like chromosomes or cells (and conversely,\nanti-reductionists claim that higher-level constituents are often\nnecessary for producing adequate explanations). However, as has been\npointed out by many authors, blanket attributions of significance like\nthese are deeply misleading (e.g., Wimsatt 1976a; Jackson & Pettit\n1992; cf. Potochnik & McGill 2012: 129; Noble 2012: 56; Craver\n2007: 191). One reason for this is that particular levels exhibit\nepistemic merit only in regard to what is being investigated. As such,\nwhat is taken to be the relevant level will shift depending on what\nstructures or processes comprise the focus of scientists’\ninvestigative tasks, and hence no level will have inherent or\nprincipled epistemic superiority. Moreover, epistemic products like\nexplanations and theories in biology rarely exhibit a monolevel\nstructure, but rather include multiple levels simultaneously (e.g.,\nSchaffner 1993: 97–8, 387; Mitchell 2003: 147; Craver 2007). \nThe basic conclusion that Potochnik and McGill and other levels\nskeptics draw from this is the following. The levels concept precludes\na sophisticated discussion of philosophical and scientific issues by\nimposing an overly simplistic representation of science and nature.\nSo, although perhaps no one would deny the attractiveness of\n‘levels’ in seeking to make complex natural systems\ntractable to analysis, depicting these systems using the concept seems\nto do far more harm than good. Burton S. Guttman is very clear on\nthis, stating that “if it is stated in any but the sloppiest and\nmost general terms, [the concept of levels] is a useless and even\nmisleading concept” (Guttman 1976: 112). Similarly, Miriam\nThalos emphasizes “the conceit of levels” and argues that\n“the notion of levels provides no useful philosophical ideas\nwhatever” (Thalos 2013: 13). \nThis levels-skepticism has also a more constructive side. Several\nauthors have suggested replacing or reinterpreting levels talk in\nterms of other concepts, most importantly scale (Eronen 2013, 2015;\nNoble 2012; Potochnik & McGill 2012; see also P.S. Churchland\n& Sejnowski 1992; McCauley 2009; Rueger & McGivern 2010). The\nmotivation behind this is that the problems associated with levels of\norganization can be avoided if more well-defined notions are applied\ninstead. For instance, the notion of scale arguably does not\nlead to the same kinds of problems as the idea of levels of\norganization. All that it is needed for arranging things on a scale is\nmeasuring some quantitative property of those things. Scales also have\nthe advantage of being entirely continuous, while levels require\nplacing things at distinct and discrete positions in the hierarchy\n(Eronen 2015; Potochnik & McGill 2012). The scale that is the most\nobviously relevant one in this context is the size scale, which is\nbased on how big things are: Organisms are usually (though not always)\nbigger than cells, which are bigger than molecules, which are bigger\nthan atoms, and so on. However, also the time scale (the rate at which\nprocesses occur) is crucially important for understanding biological\norganization (Simon 1962; DiFrisco 2017): Interactions between\norganisms (e.g., sexual reproduction) take place at much slower rates\nthan interactions between cells (e.g., synaptic communication), which\nagain are slower than interactions between molecules (e.g., receptor\nbinding). \nThis “deflationary” approach (Eronen 2013, 2015), where\nlevels are reduced or deflated to more well-defined concepts, is also\nconsistent with the idea that at some scales we may find peaks of\nregularity or predictability (Wimsatt 1994), or clusters of causal\nrelationships (Potochnik & McGill 2012). However, to what extent\nsuch peaks or clusters can be discerned in biological systems is an\nopen question. It also remains to be seen whether the deflationary\napproach is sufficient for accounting for the role of levels of\norganization in biological theories and explanations. \nLevels of organization figure into a number of perennial debates in\nphilosophy of science. Here we go through three broad topics where\nlevels traditionally have and continue to play a prominent role:\nReduction, antireductionism and pluralism, and downward causation.\nWithin these topics, we focus on issues and theories that directly\ninvolve levels. \nAs we saw above, Oppenheim and Putnam introduced their highly\ninfluential view of levels in the context of the reductive unity of\nscience. Since then, levels have also continued to play an important\nrole in debates on reductionism (see the entry\n reductionism in biology).\n Questions of reductionism are often explicitly formulated in terms of\nlevels: Do higher level properties, theories, or explanations reduce\nto lower level ones? \nIn the classical Nagelian account (Nagel 1961), reduction amounts to\nderiving a theory that is to be reduced from a more fundamental\nreducing theory on the basis of two conditions: deducibility and\nconnectability (see the entry\n scientific reduction).\n The standard example is the reduction of thermodynamics to\nstatistical mechanics. Nagel thought that from the laws of statistical\nmechanics one can derive the laws of thermodynamics (deducibility),\nwith the help of “bridge principles” that connect the\nterms of these two theories (connectability; Nagel 1961: ch. 11;\nSchaffner 1967). Nagel’s original approach to reduction has been\ncriticized from many angles, but in the present context, the most\nrelevant criticism is that the classical model ignores the distinction\nbetween interlevel and intralevel reductions in\nscience (Wimsatt 1976a, 1976b; McCauley 1996). Intralevel (or\nsuccessional) settings involve competing theories within a particular\nscience and within a particular level, for example the phlogiston\ntheory and the caloric theory of heat. Interlevel settings, on the\nother hand, involve theories at different levels of organization that\nthereby have differing explananda, terminology and methodology: for\nexample, cognitive psychology and molecular neuroscience.\nNagel’s model in its classic form treats these different\ncontexts equally. Other shortcomings of the Nagelian account are that\nit only applies to (formalized) theories, ignoring other products of\nscience, and that it fails to incorporate the fact that the reducing\ntheory often corrects the reduced theory (see, e.g., Walter &\nEronen 2011). For these and many other reasons, it is widely agreed\nthat the Nagelian model fails to reconstruct reductive relations as\nthey appear in actual science (Wimsatt 1976b, 1979), and that the model in\nits original form is inapplicable to actual biological cases (Kaiser\n2012). \nProblems of the Nagelian model led to the development of alternative\naccounts based on the same basic idea, which actively incorporated the\nidea of levels into their framework (Hooker 1981; P.S. Churchland\n1986; Schaffner 1993; Bickle 1998, 2003). This culminated in the\n“New Wave” model of reduction, where intertheoretic\nrelations form a continuum ranging from complete elimination to\nretentive Nagel-style reduction (Bickle 1998). For a summary of this\nmodel, see the entry\n scientific reduction\n §2.6. In the present context, what is noteworthy is that the\ncases that inspire the eliminativist aspirations of the New Wave model\nencompass only intralevel, i.e., successive, relations, while\nthe conclusions they draw concern cases of the interlevel kind\n(particularly the relationship between psychology and neuroscience;\nMcCauley 1996). Historical cases of elimination, such as the\nreplacement of the phlogiston theory with the caloric theory of heat,\nhave arguably all been cases where a theory is replaced by a successor\nat roughly the same level of organization. Theories at different\nlevels of organization can coevolve and exert selective pressures on\neach other’s terminology, practices, explanations, and such\n(Wimsatt 1976b [2007: 252]; P.S. Churchland 1986: 363, 373), but this\nrarely if ever results in elimination or replacement of one of the\ntheories. \nOther accounts of reduction also countenance the levels concept,\nalbeit in different ways. In his “ruthless” account of\nreductionism, Bickle (2003) abandons the idea of reduction progressing\nstepwise from level to level, and argues that cellular and molecular\nneuroscience can directly replace psychology. If one can intervene\nonto the molecular level to change variables at the behavioral level,\nthen, Bickle contends, one has discovered the “genuine”\ncausal mechanism for those variables (Bickle 2003). Here ‘levels’\nfigure into ruthless reductionism as useful fictions, where\nintermediary levels such as tissues, organs, and the like provide a\nscaffolding for emerging molecular-level explanations. These\nintermediary levels exhibit “merely” heuristic value, but\nonly in the service of constructing behavior-to-molecules reductions\n(Bickle 2003: 130). \nMore recently, Hüttemann and Love (2011) note that part-whole\nreduction in particular has become a widely-endorsed alternative to\nthe Nagelian framework (see also Brigandt 2013: 77). In documenting\nsome of the facets that this form of reduction has acquired in the\nintervening years, they put forward as two aspects of reductive\nexplanation compositionality and causality\n(Hüttemann & Love 2011: 4). In reductive contexts, both are\nexpressed in levels-laden language. Compositionality, for instance, is\ncouched in ‘levels’ in that the very notions of part and\nwhole in biological contexts correspond to respectively lower- and\nhigher-level status (cf. Kaiser 2015: 192; Winther 2006). This is\nreflected in the issues they raise for identifying and evaluating\nreductive explanations as reductive. One of these,\n“intrinsicality”, refers to the constraint of a part that\nit always be contained within, or inherent to, the whole to which it\nbelongs (Hüttemann & Love 2011: 9–10).\n‘Levels’ offers one way of straightforwardly capturing\nthis feature of part-whole relations (cf. 2011: 5). Another feature is\n“fundamentality,” which  \ncorresponds to the assumption that higher levels of organization are\nreduced to lower levels of organization: parts are taken as more\nfundamental than the compound. (2011: 5–6)  \nAs these features are applied to evaluate whether an explanation is\njustifiably considered “reductive” or not, by extension\n‘levels’ can be seen here as contributing to the criteria\nof adequacy to the conceptual issue of reduction. Kaiser (2015) goes\nfurther than this approach in claiming that a “lower-level\ncharacter” is a necessary condition for an explanation to even\nbe considered reductive (2015: 188). \nThe idea of levels has also figured prominently into arguments for\nantireductionism and pluralism. In his classic treatise, Philip\nKitcher (1984) elevates the level concept to a centerpiece of the\nantireductionist position. According to Kitcher, the reductionist\naspiration of reducing classical Mendelian to molecular genetics will\nnot pan out because molecular constituents do not capture the causal\nrelations between Mendelian constituents (e.g., chromosomes) and\nheritable traits. The reason for this is that the cytological\nprocesses that form the basis for Mendelian patterns of heredity (such\nas meiosis) form a natural kind that cannot be delineated at the\nmolecular level (1984: 349; Brigandt 2013: 76). Importantly, Kitcher\ngrounds this in the structure of the world as captured by the levels\nconcept:  \nAnti-reductionism construes the current division of biology not simply\nas a temporary feature of our science stemming from our cognitive\nimperfections but as the reflection of levels of organization in\nnature. (1984: 371, emphasis modified; Rosenberg 1985: 119, makes\na similar statement)  \nElevating the levels concept even further, Kitcher makes levels\n(albeit a layer-cake variety of the term) part of the conception of\nantireductionism itself, concluding that  \nto the extent that we can make sense of the present explanatory\nstructure within biology—that division of the field into\nsubfields corresponding to levels of organization in nature—we\ncan also understand the antireductionist doctrine. (Kitcher 1984:\n373) \nIn a more recent defense of antireductionism, Robert McCauley (1996,\n2007) expands on Wimsatt’s intra-interlevel distinction to plea\nfor a multilevel explanatory pluralism between higher- and lower-level\ntheories. McCauley targets the New Wave model where intertheory\nrelations result in a spectrum of consequences, ranging from identity\nto elimination, for higher-level theories (P.M. Churchland 1979; P.M.\nChurchland and P.S. Churchland 1990; and later Bickle 1998). He argues\nthat a single spectrum of reductive consequences misrepresents the\nnature of intertheory coevolution. Intralevel reductions, focusing on\nreduction in terms of replacement, do not capture the historical\ndynamics involved in evaluating interlevel cases, and elimination is\nvirtually nonexistent in interlevel cases. Moreover, eliminating or\nreducing higher-level theories would also undermine the status of\nthe higher-level’s scientific institutions. As this rarely\nhappens, and attributing epistemic, ontological, or methodological\nsuperiority to the lower levels is at best a claim that needs to be\nsubstantiated, reductions appear to be wildly at odds with actual\nscientific practice. Instead, we observe intertheory coevolution,\nwhich proceeds by exploiting the ontological, explanatory, and\nmethodological resources that each theory brings to the table.\nHigher-level theories can offer lower-level theories criteria for\nexternal coherency, novel problem solving strategies, and serve as\nevidentiary sources for lower-level scientific efforts (McCauley 1996:\n32, 35). \nOther arguments for pluralism also take their start from levels of\norganization. Sandra Mitchell (2003), for instance, argues that since\nbiological systems are typically multilevel, this dissipates locating\ncauses within the system from one single level into multiple\ninteracting causes that are simultaneously in effect at the different\nlevels (2003: 147; 2009: 114–5). Mitchell argues on this basis\nfor a broader integrative pluralism that takes itself to be\nsuggested by the multilevel and multicomponential “ontology of\ncomplex systems” (2009: 109). The basic idea of integrative\npluralism falls out of the fact that biological systems evolve in a\ncontingent manner (2003: 58), thus setting the stage for multilevel\nevolutionary scenarios (2003: 24, 31). This in turn highlights the\npreponderance of ‘emergent properties’ in biological\nsystems, which appear at novel levels of organization out of the\ninteractions of simpler components. Both of these factors inflate the\noverall number of explanatory sources that could contribute to\nexplaining a given phenomenon (2003: 6; 2009: 8). Consequently,\ndiscovering unilateral causes for complex phenomena will not be\nforthcoming (2003: 160). Likewise, Ingo Brigandt (2010, 2013) emphasizes the pursuance of\ninvestigation at multiple levels of organization as a fact about\nscientific practice (2010: 303), but also as cause to articulate the\nlocalized significance of explanatory contributions to particular\nproblems, as in the case of evo-devo explanations (2010: 303).  \nThis kind of multilevel pluralism is also defended by the supporters\nof the New Mechanism (Bechtel 2008; Craver 2005, 2007; Brigandt 2010:\n297). As McCauley (2007) points out, mechanistic explanation can be\nseen as explanatory pluralism “writ small”: In each\nlocalized mechanistic context, several levels (understood as levels of\nmechanisms) are needed to fully explain the phenomenon (see, however,\nFazekas and Kertész (2011) and Soom (2012), who argue that the\ncommitments of New Mechanism are incompatible with robust\nantireductionism). \nLevels of organization have traditionally provided the framework for\nthe debate on downward causation, where the question is whether\nhigher-level entities or properties can exert causal influence on\nlower-level ones (e.g., Bechtel 2008; Campbell 1974; Emmeche et al.\n1997, 2000; Kim 1992, 1999; Craver & Bechtel 2007). The idea of\ndownward causation is closely connected to emergentism, and is often\nseen as one of its core tenets (Emmeche et al. 1997, 2000; Kim 1999).\nExamples of putative downward causation include psychological states\ncausing physical behavior, the activity of an organism causing changes\nin the tissues and cells of that organism, and cell-level processes\nsuch as synaptic communication causing molecular changes. Downward\ncausation seems prima facie to be common or even ubiquitous\nin experiments and explanations in the life sciences (Craver &\nBechtel 2007; Love 2012). However, in contemporary philosophy,\ndownward causation is often approached with skepticism. If it is\nunderstood as higher-level things or properties exerting some kind of\nphysically measurable influence on lower-level things, there seems to\nbe no evidence for it (McLaughlin 1992). Downward causation also faces\nmetaphysical difficulties, most importantly the much-debated\ncausal exclusion argument (e.g., Kim 1992, 1999, 2005). To\nput it very roughly, the core of this argument is that if we accept\nthe plausible assumption that all physical occurrences must have\nsufficient physical causes, it is not clear how there could be room\nfor additional higher-level causes of lower-level physical effects.\nFor more on causal exclusion and downward causation, see the entries\n mental causation\n and\n emergent properties. \nAlthough the discussion on downward causation relies heavily on the\nnotion of levels, this notion itself has not received much explicit\nattention. However, recently the account of levels of mechanisms has\nbeen put to use to provide a new take on the issue (Bechtel 2008;\nCraver & Bechtel 2007; Craver 2015). The idea is that genuine\ntop-down or downward causation does not exist; there are just normal\nsame-level causal relationships that sometimes have\n“mechanistically mediated” effects downward in the\nmechanism. What is meant by “mechanistically mediated” is\nthat changes in the higher levels of the mechanism immediately result\nin changes in the lower levels of the mechanisms due to the\nconstitutive relationship between the higher-level mechanism and its\nlower-level components. Mechanistically mediated effects may have the\ninitial appearance of downward causation, but the relationship between\nthe mechanism and its components is constitutive, not causal, and\ntherefore mechanistically mediated effects are not causal. \nTo clarify this, consider the example of Hal’s glucose\nmetabolism (Craver & Bechtel 2007: 559–560). Hal is playing\ntennis, and as he keeps running around and swinging the racket, the\ncells in Hal’s body start taking in and using more glucose. It\nseems that the cause of the increase in Hal’s glucose metabolism\nat the cellular level is Hal playing tennis, which suggests causation\nfrom a higher level (the level of the whole organism playing tennis)\nto a lower level (the cellular level). However, in the framework of\nCraver and Bechtel described above, what is really going on is just\nregular same-level causal relationships at the cellular level: Nerve\nsignals to the muscle cells cause a cascade of events that results in\nincreased glucose metabolism. Hal’s tennis playing activity is\npartly constituted by these cellular mechanisms, and this\nconstitutive relationship is responsible for the illusion of downward\ncausation. As Hal starts to play, there are changes in these\nmechanisms, but only in virtue of them partly making up the tennis\nplaying activity. \nThis approach is appealing, but faces several challenges. First, it\nhas been argued that there are no clear methods of distinguishing\nbetween causal and constitutive relationships in mechanisms (e.g.,\nLeuridan 2011); if this is correct, there seems to be no reason to\nposit that “mechanistically mediated” effects are\nnon-causal. Second, the idea of “normal” intralevel\ncausation is problematic in the framework of levels of mechanisms\n(Eronen 2013). As we have seen in section 2.2, the idea of\n“being at the same level” has little if any significance\nin this framework, so same-level causation cannot be the default or\nnormal type of causation. The idea seems to be rather that there is no\ncausation from a mechanism as a whole to the components of that same\nmechanism, but this is just one specific form of putative downward\ncausation, and how other forms should be treated is left open in this\naccount (Eronen 2013). Third, it is not clear whether higher-level\ncausal processes in mechanisms can be distinct from causal processes\nat lower levels of the mechanism—if not, there are no\nhigher-level causal processes that could have mechanistically mediated\neffects downwards in the mechanism to begin with (Fazekas &\nKertész 2011). \nA different way of approaching downward causation in biology is to\nexplicate it in terms of higher-level constraints or boundary\nconditions. The idea is that the behavior of lower-level things is\nconstrained by the higher-level whole that they are a part of, and\ntherefore explaining the behavior of these lower-level things is not\npossible exclusively at the lower level, but requires appealing to\nhigher-level factors (e.g., Bishop 2008; Campbell 1974; Emmeche et al.\n1997, 2000; Kistler 2009; Noble 2012; Sperry 1969). In a classic\narticle, Donald Campbell expressed this idea as follows:\n“processes at the lower levels of a hierarchy are restrained by\nand act in conformity to the laws of the higher level” (Campbell\n1974: 180). For example, explaining protein folding (at the level of\nmolecules) seems to require appealing to factors in the environment at\nthe cellular level, such as the presence of chaperones (Love\n2012). \nIt is widely agreed that downward or top-down explanation of this kind\nis required in science. The controversial and unsettled question is\nwhether these cases also involve causation in a substantial sense, or\nwhether it would be more appropriate to just designate them as some\nform of downward determination or explanation (see, e.g., Hulswit\n2005). It should also be noted that both this approach and that of\nCraver and Bechtel are largely silent on the issue of downward\ncausation understood as causation across levels of organization or\nscales in a broader sense, for example, between a nerve cell and\nmolecules that are not part of that same nerve cell, or between\npsychological states and behavior. \nBesides the more philosophical debates discussed above, levels of\norganization also play an important conceptual role in biological\nresearch and theory. Interestingly, this growing body of literature on\nlevels in evolutionary biology is almost entirely disconnected from\nthe debates on levels in philosophy of science discussed above. \nA prominent example is the issue of levels of selection. In this\ndebate, the hierarchical organization of nature into levels is an\nimportant background assumption, as the aim is to find out at which\nlevel(s) of the biological hierarchy natural selection is taking place\n(Griesemer 2000; Okasha 2006). Although Darwin’s original\naccount was focused on evolution at the level of organisms, arguably\nthe conditions for natural selection can be formulated abstractly\nwithout referring to any specific kinds of entities, which allows for\nnatural selection to operate at any level where the conditions are\nsatisfied (Griesemer 2000; Lewontin 1970). Since the 1970s, the debate\non levels of selection has kept on growing and extending to different\nareas, though no precise consensus has been reached. Positions range\nfrom the gene-centered view, where natural selection is taken to\noperate almost exclusively at the level of genes (e.g., Dawkins 1976;\nWilliams 1966), to the pluralistic multilevel selection theory, which\nallows for natural selection to operate on any level of the biological\nhierarchy where we find the right kind of units (e.g., Sober &\nWilson 1998; Wilson & Wilson 2008). \nOne branch of the levels of selection debate that is particularly\ninteresting from the point of view of levels of organization is the\nissue of evolutionary transitions. Here the focus is on the\nemergence of new levels of organization through evolutionary\nprocesses (Buss 1987: ch. 5; Griesemer 2000; Maynard Smith &\nSzathmáry 1995; Okasha 2006). The background idea is that the\ncomplex hierarchical organization of nature that we observe today must\nitself be a result of evolution, and therefore requires an\nevolutionary explanation. For example, somehow prokaryotes evolved to\neukaryotic cells, single-celled organisms evolved to multicellular\norganisms, individual animals evolved to colonies, and so on. In their\nhighly influential book, Maynard Smith and Szathmáry (1995)\nproposed that the characteristic feature of major evolutionary\ntransitions is that entities that were capable of replicating\nindependently before the transitions are only capable of replicating\nas parts of higher-level wholes after the transitions (see also Buss\n1987). For example, after a single-celled organism has evolved into a\nmulticellular organism, the cells of the organism can no longer\nreplicate independently of the organism as a whole. For more on levels\nof selection and evolutionary transitions, see Okasha (2006) and the\nentry\n units and levels of selection. \nIn these debates, the notion of levels of organization is typically\nused as a primitive term that is assumed to be clear enough and is\ntherefore left undefined (Griesemer 2005). A notable exception is\nOkasha (2006), who puts forward a proposal for understanding levels of\norganization in natural selection, building on earlier work by McShea\n(2001). The starting point is the part-whole relationship, which is\nthe standard definitive feature of levels of organization, but taken\nalone is insufficient for defining levels of organization: A big heap\nof sand is made up of smaller heaps of sands, but does not constitute\na higher level of organization. Therefore, Okasha (2006) and McShea\n(2001) propose two further conditions: The parts that form\nhigher-level wholes must interact with each other, and they\nmust be homologous with organisms in a free-living state. For\nexample, the cells that compose organisms interact with each other and\nare homologous to free-living unicellular organisms, and therefore\nconstitute a level of organization. On the other hand, candidates such\nas heaps of sand are ruled out, as they do not significantly interact\nwith each other, nor are they homologous to free-living organisms. \nAnother context in biology where the nature of levels has received\nexplicit attention is the “hierarchy theory of evolution”\ndeveloped by Niles Eldredge and colleagues (Eldredge et al. 2016, Vrba\n& Eldredge 1984). In this theoretical framework, levels and\nhierarchies are taken to be fundamentally important ontological\nfeatures of nature:  \nBiological evolutionary theory is ontologically committed to the\nexistence of nested hierarchies in nature and attempts to explain\nnatural phenomena as a product of complex dynamics of real\nhierarchical systems. (Tëmkin & Eldredge 2015: 184)  \nIn the hierarchy theory of evolution, a distinction is made between\ntwo types of hierarchies and the corresponding levels (Eldredge\n1996; Vrba & Eldredge\n1984): The ecological and the genealogical\nhierarchy. In both kinds of hierarchies, higher-level things are\nformed through specific interactions among lower-level things. In the\necological hierarchy, these interactions are exchanges of matter and\nenergy, such as consuming and gathering resources, and in this\nhierarchy, we find things such as cells, organisms, avatars and\necosystems. In the genealogical hierarchy, the defining activity\nthrough which levels are formed is the transmission of information\nthrough replication, and the hierarchy includes things such as cells,\norganisms, demes and species. Note that cells and organisms appear in\nboth hierarchies, but in the ecological hierarchy they are seen as\ninteractors, whereas in the genealogical hierarchy they are seen as\nreplicators. \nBesides these theoretical debates, levels of organization also play an\nimportant role in textbooks and other introductory texts in biology\n(e.g., Begon, Townshend & Harper 2006; Lobo 2008; Mader 2010;\nO’Neill et al. 1986). Depictions of levels are ubiquitous in\nbiological textbooks, often appearing in the first few pages and with\na prominent ‘centerfold’ illustration. In this capacity,\nthe levels concept serves as an organizational principle that aids in\nimparting basic knowledge of the study of biology to novice scientists\nearly in their training. Some of the ideas that the levels concept is\nused to introduce to students include (i) the apparent preponderance\nof emergence in living systems, (ii) reductive and non-reductive\napproaches to analyzing biological phenomena (oftentimes with an\nantireductionist gloss), and (iii) the context-sensitivity of posing\nbiological problems. Apart from these introductory uses, levels are\nalso used throughout textbooks to introduce the basic layout of\nmultiple ideas and important phenomena that are themselves ubiquitous\nto different areas of biological study. The hierarchical structure of\nproteins, being comprised of primary, secondary, tertiary, and\nquaternary structures is one important instance. Interestingly,\ntextbooks vary between global and local treatments of levels. On the\none hand, centerfold depictions often represent the canonical levels\nof organization in biology; the series of\natoms-molecules-organelles-cells-tissues-organs-organisms-populations-communities-ecosystems-biosphere make up the basic idea of levels in\nthese contexts. On the other hand, depictions like protein structure\nare strongly localized to only two classes of macromolecules (nucleic\nacids and proteins), while excluding others (lipids, sugars) (Love\n2012: 117). \nAlthough ‘levels of organization’ has been a key concept\nin biology and its philosophy since the early 20th century,\nthere is still no consensus on the nature and significance of the\nconcept. In different areas of philosophy and biology, we find\nstrongly varying ideas of levels, and none of the accounts put forward\nhas received wide acceptance. At the moment, the mechanistic approach\nis perhaps the most promising and acclaimed account, but as we have\nseen, it may be too minimalistic to fulfill the role that levels of\norganization continue to play in biological theorizing. We have also\nnoted that there is a curious disconnect between the tradition ranging\nfrom Oppenheim and Putman to Bechtel, Craver and Wimsatt on the one\nhand, and the discussions of levels in evolutionary biology (e.g.,\nEldredge, McShea, Okasha) on the other. One important aim for future\nresearch would be to bridge this gap.","contact.mail":"markusilkka@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2018-02-05","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levels-org-biology/","author1":"Markus I.

Typical levels of organization that\none finds in the literature include the atomic, molecular, cellular,\ntissue, organ, organismal, group, population, community, ecosystem,\nlandscape, and biosphere levels. References to levels of organization\nand related hierarchical depictions of nature are prominent in the\nlife sciences and their philosophical study, and appear not only in\nintroductory textbooks and lectures, but also in cutting-edge research\narticles and reviews. In philosophy, perennial debates such as\nreduction, emergence, mechanistic explanation, interdisciplinary\nrelations, natural selection, and many other topics, also rely\nsubstantially on the notion.\n\n\nYet, in spite of the ubiquity of the notion, levels of organization\nhave received little explicit attention in biology or its philosophy.\nUsually they appear in the background as an implicit conceptual\nframework that is associated with vague intuitions. Attempts at\nproviding general and broadly applicable definitions of levels of\norganization have not met wide acceptance. In recent years, several\nauthors have put forward localized and minimalistic accounts of\nlevels, and others have raised doubts about the usefulness of the\nnotion as a whole. \n\n\nThere are many kinds of ‘levels’ that one may find in\nphilosophy, science, and everyday life—the term is notoriously\nambiguous. Besides levels of organization, there are levels of\nabstraction, realization, being, analysis, processing, theory,\nscience, complexity, and many others. In this article, the focus will\nbe on levels of organization and debates associated with them, and\nother kinds of levels will only be discussed when they are relevant to\nthis main topic.\n\nWhen levels of organization are understood as belonging to the broader\ncategory of hierarchical depictions of nature, their history can be\ntraced all the way back to the early days of western science and\nphilosophy. Aristotle suggested that living things could be arranged\nin a graded scale, starting from plants at the bottom and ending with\nhumans at the top. This idea was further developed in Neoplatonism,\nand in Medieval times, it transformed into the idea of “the\nGreat Chain of Being” (Lovejoy 1936). This Scala\nNaturae conveyed a hierarchical conception of the world as\nmodeled after the perfection of the Deity: at the top, there is God,\nand at lower rungs, angels, humans, animals, plants, and so on. After\nthe scientific revolution, more scientific classifications of nature\nstarted to appear, the most famous ones being Linneaus’\ntaxonomical system and Auguste Comte’s hierarchy of the sciences\n(Comte 1842 [1853]). \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, several notions of\n“levels” began to circulate in the philosophical and\nscientific literature. Prominent among these was the idea of\n“levels of existence” (alternatively: “being”;\n“complexity”) developed by philosophers Samuel Alexander\n(1920: 3, 45) and Charles Dunbar Broad (1925), which figured\nprominently in the emergentist and emergent evolution literature of\nthe 1920’s (Sellars 1926; McLaughlin 1992; Stephan 1999). This\nintroduced a number of themes that have become germane to general\nlevels-language. These themes include level-specific laws (Broad 1925:\n77; cf. Woodger 1929) and the idea that ‘levels’ exhibit a\ntendency in nature towards increasing complexity (Sellars 1917: 224;\ncf. Needham 1937), Although most of these themes were severely\nunderdeveloped and divorced from the cutting-edge work in the life\nsciences happening at the time (Needham 1937: 242 ff. 4), this\ntradition has been an influential historical source for explicating\nlevels language in philosophy of mind (see the entries on\n emergent properties\n and\n supervenience;\n McLaughlin 1992; Beckermann et al. 1992; Kim 1999, 2002). \nThe roots of the contemporary notion of levels of organization and the\nassociated hierarchical thinking are best linked to the efforts of\norganicist biologists of the early-mid 20th century (for\nprimers on the organicist movement, see Peterson 2014; Nicholson and\nGawne 2015). Particularly important to the introduction and\ndevelopment of the levels concept were Joseph Woodger (1929, 1930),\nLudwig von Bertalanffy (1928 [1933], 1932), and Joseph Needham (1936,\n1937). These individuals were in turn influenced by Alfred North\nWhitehead’s philosophy (see, e.g., Whitehead 1929; Needham\n1941). \nOrganicism (alternatively “organismal” or\n“organismic” biology) did not designate a clearly-defined\ngroup of people, but rather a loosely-threaded confluence of\nscientists and philosophers distributed among many disciplines and\nacross Europe and the Americas. The organicists (like the\nemergentists) were in part responding to the dispute between the\nmechanists and the neovitalists of the early 20th century.\nThe mechanists held that biological phenomena were “nothing over\nand above” their physico-chemical components, meaning that\nbiological phenomena can in principle, and eventually will, be\nexhaustively accounted for in chemical or physical terms (Loeb 1912,\n1916). They also argued that biological phenomena, though seemingly\ncomplex, are fundamentally similar to machines (Loeb 1912, 1916; see\nalso Allen 2005: 264; Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010: 17];\nNicholson 2012: 160). Neovitalists such as Hans Driesch and Henri\nBergson rejected these ideas, arguing that living things cannot be\nexplained solely based on their physico-chemical components, and that\nbiological phenomena therefore must involve non-physical forces or\nentities. The organicists sought to offer a “third way”\ninto the mechanist-vitalist dispute that served as a middle ground\nbetween the austerity of the mechanists and the extravagance of the\nneovitalists (Peterson 2014: 286; Nicholson & Gawne 2015:\n358). \nThree major tenets of organicism were particularly congenial to the\ndevelopment of the levels concept. Firstly, the central preoccupation\nof organicist thought with organization laid down a\nfoundation for levels thinking (cf. Nicholson & Gawne 2015: 364).\nFor the organicists, organization marked the decisive feature for\ndemarcating living phenomena from non-living physico-chemical\nphenomena (e.g., Woodger 1929: 290–1; von Bertalanffy 1928\n[1933: 48]; Needham 1936: ch. 1). Unlike the neovitalists, however,\nthe organicists (particularly during the 1930’s) did not hold\norganization to be inscrutable, but rather an important explanandum of\nbiological study (Nicholson & Gawne 2015: 365). Moreover, living\norganisms exhibited a hierarchical ordering among their\ndistinct parts (Woodger 1930: 8; von Bertalanffy 1932: 83; Needham\n1936: ch. 5; see also Nicholson & Gawne 2015: 366). This combined\nnicely with the focus on organization as the major explanandum of\nbiology in that the series of elements that compose different\norganisms required specific and contextualized treatment. This in turn\ncomplemented another main tenet of the organicists, namely the\nautonomy of biology as a natural science and its phenomena from\nphysico-chemical phenomena (cf. Nicholson & Gawne 2015:\n366–7). \nThe levels concept proved to be a linchpin of these main tenets.\nJoseph Woodger, combining these features, thus expresses the basic\nthinking behind levels of organization: \nTwo principal factors appear to have been responsible for the failure\nto take organization seriously in biology. First there is the vague\nbelief that only atoms and molecules are ‘real’, and\nsecondly the incautious use of the notion of chemical composition.\nAlso the biological entities are found to be composite in the same\nsense, and moreover, some of the relata in the relation of composition\nin the physico-chemical objects are also relata in the biological\nobjects. But the analysis of organisms as carried out by\nbiologists reveal other relata in mutual relation of\ncomposition in a different sense, i.e., not in\nchemical composition, e.g., the organism is analysable\ninto organ-systems, organs, tissues, cells and cell-parts. There is a\nhierarchy of composing parts or relata in a hierarchy of organizing\nrelations. These relations and relata can only be studied at\ntheir own levels (cf. the quartz crystal) and not simply in\nterms of the lower levels. (Woodger 1929: 292–293,\nemphasis modified; cf. Bertalanffy 1932: 100–101; Needham 1937\n[1943: 234]) \nUnlike the emergentists’ “levels of existence,” the\nhierarchical view of the world expounded by the organicists emphasized\ndifferentiating the many distinct classes of matter’s\npossible forms to accommodate the diversity in biological entities.\nThis in turn led them to posit many more levels in the world than the\nfour ‘super levels’ of the emergentists (the physical the\nchemical, the vital, and the mental), and also implied an increase in\ncomplexity as more levels of organization were brought to bear on\ntreating living systems. Woodger again remarks: \nIf the parts [of an organism] were homogeneous then we should be able\nto call them units and there would only be one level of organization.\nBut if each part were itself composed of parts forming in each an\norganized system, then clearly we should have two levels of\norganization and if the composing sub-parts of the first organization\nwere intrinsically only numerically different we could speak of two\nhomogeneous levels of organization. If, however, the sub-parts were\nintrinsically different then the first-order parts would be different\nand we should have a heterogeneous type of organization. By carrying\nout this process of subdivision further we could obtain very complex\ntypes of organization exhibiting a hierarchy of successive levels. And\nif now we consider one of the higher living organisms it is evident at\nonce that its organization will belong to one of these heterogeneous\nhierarchical types. (Woodger 1929: 298) \nThis idea that levels of organization of organization form\n“nested” compositional hierarchies where there are wholes\nat higher levels and their components at lower levels, and the\ncomponents themselves can be further decomposed into parts, remains\none of the core features of the notion of levels of organization up to\nthis day. \nIn the aftermath of organicism, development of the levels concept\nsplintered into different intellectual trajectories, with little\noverall theoretical or conceptual coherence. One direction of\ndevelopment flowed through the framework of general systems theory\n(von Bertalanffy 1950, 1968), and particularly through so-called\nhierarchy theory (Whyte et al. 1969; Weiss 1971; Pattee 1973). General\nsystems theory sought to construct isomorphisms between laws of\ndifferent scientific fields based on their generic system properties\n(von Bertalanffy 1950: 136), but nonetheless continued to emphasize\nthe hierarchical structure of systems (von Bertalanffy 1968). ‘Levels of organization’ in\nthis tradition was ultimately given secondary consideration to the\narticulation of system-generic properties and laws. Similarly, in\nhierarchy theory, ‘levels’ tend to be treated as\nderivative of the more general notion of a hierarchy, or the ordering\nof a system into nested subsystems (Simon 1962 [1996: 184–5];\nsee also Weiss 1971). Hierarchy and levels alike continued to be\ntreated as generic structures of systems of all stripes (see also\nAllen & Starr 1982; O’Neill et al. 1986). However, one important\ndistinction to come out of this tradition was the distinction between\nlevels of composition and levels of control (Simon 1962; Pattee 1973).\nThe former speaks to the nested compositionality typically identified\nwith levels of organization, while the latter refers to the idea that\nhigher levels impose constraints on the processes at lower levels, for\nexample by limiting the degrees of freedom of the system at a lower\nlevel (Pattee 1973: 85). \nOther early attempts at clarifying the concept of levels were carried\nout by individual researchers working alone on similar or related\nissues, such as reduction or multilevel selection. Mario Bunge (1960,\n1977), Marjorie Grene (1969, 1987), and William Wimsatt (1976a, 1981, 1994) each\ndeveloped several ground-laying observations concerning levels. Bunge\n(1960) remarks on the plethora of meanings the term can possess, then\noffers a long taxonomy of nine different meanings of the term\n“levels”, ranging from the innocuous (levels as degrees or\nquantity, as in ‘levels of stress’) to the sense of nature\nbeing ordered into an evolutionary series, with several corollary\nsenses of levels falling between (such as degrees of complexity). In\nhis 1977 paper, Bunge goes further, offering a set-theoretic treatment\nof levels, and claiming that the leveled structure of the natural\nworld is what renders natural phenomena intelligible to us (Bunge\n1977: R82). Grene (1969) also remarks on the polysemic nature of the\nterm “hierarchy”, noting that ‘levels’ has\ndistinct uses in different fields of sciences. Grene later (1987)\ndistinguishes between two notions of hierarchy, one falling under a\nmixed notion of levels as composition and control, respectively, and\nthe other exemplifying phylogenetic ranks. Wimsatt’s work will\nbe considered in more detail below in section 2.3. \nA recurring motif in the literature on levels of organization is to\nlament the haphazard or unreflective way in which terms such as\n‘hierarchy’ or ‘levels’ are applied, and to\ncall for more precise analyses (e.g., Beckner 1974; Bunge 1977; Grene\n1987; Korn 2002; Valentine & May 1996). However, surprisingly few\nphilosophers or scientists have taken up the challenge of developing a\nsubstantial theory or account of levels of organization. In this\nsection, we discuss three major accounts put forward in philosophy of\nscience to clarify or posit what exactly levels of organization are.\nThese are Paul Oppenheim and Hilary Putnam’s\n“layer-cake” account, the mechanist account developed and\nadvocated by Carl Craver (2007: ch. 5, 2015) and William Bechtel\n(2008: ch. 4), and William Wimsatt’s “local maxima”\naccount (1976a, 1994). After\nthese, we also go through recent skeptical approaches to the idea of\nlevels of organization. \nThe two most visible accounts in philosophy of science, the\n“layer-cake” and “mechanistic” accounts, mark\npolarized visions for the levels concept. The layer-cake account\ncomprises a comprehensive conception that posits exhaustive stepwise\ncompositional relations between all constituents of nature and strict\ncorrespondence between each putative level and a primary scientific\ndiscipline that studies the constituents occupying that level. The\nmechanistic account proposes a contextualized conception of\nontological levels in nature that are defined in terms of constitutive\nparthood within a mechanism (Craver 2007: 188–189; Kaplan 2015:\n20). The third account, Wimsatt’s “local maxima”\naccount, has arguably received less mainstream attention in\nphilosophy, and posits a more overarching framework for\nconceptualizing levels in science, covering both epistemic and\nontological aspects. Though general, Wimsatt’s account is not\ncomprehensive, admitting exceptions and multiple distinct criteria for\ncharacterizing levels that are congenial to both local and global\nconceptions. \nIn the classic paper “The Unity of Science as a Working\nHypothesis” (1958; see also the entry\n the unity of science),\n Oppenheim and Putnam (hereafter O&P) put forward a system of\nlevels that became very influential, and is still implicitly present\nin most references to levels. This “layer-cake” model\ncomprises three components. First, their conception of levels was\ncomprehensive, meaning they wished to subsume all instances\nof where one could talk of ‘levels’ into their account.\nSecond, O&P posited that levels are related via compositional\nrelations that are structured in a stepwise fashion. That is,\nall constituents of the objects of study of one branch of science, or,\nthe branch’s “universe of discourse,” are\nexhaustively related as wholes to the parts located at the next\nadjacent lower level, and as themselves parts to the constituents\noccurring at the next adjacent higher level. This component is\nprobably most responsible for the “layer-cake” moniker,\nwhich continues to appear in discussions of levels even today.\nFinally, O&P presumed a strict correspondence between the\nconstituents comprising a level and the predicates and theories linked\nwith these constituents, meaning that levels of science neatly map\nonto levels of nature, so that for each level in nature there is\ncorresponding science or theory and vice versa (Craver 2007:\n174–175; Brigandt 2010: 304–305). \nO&P’s usage of ‘levels’ can be broken down into\ntwo roles within their framework. The first concerns their use of\n‘levels’ in their explication of reduction, i.e.,\nmicroreduction, which in turn aided in articulating their thesis of\nunity of science. O&P’s conception of reduction spans three\ncomplementary notions: \nKemeny-Oppenheim reduction is understood as an indirect\nrelation between a reducing theory (or branch of science) T1 and\nreduced theory (or branch) T2 relative to a set of observational data\nsuch that (a) both theories contain different vocabulary, (b) T1\nexplains least as much observational data as T2, but (c) T1 also\n“explains more” than T2 (1958: 5). The notion of a\npotential microreducer supplements this by capturing the\npart-whole coordination between the natural entities constituting the\nuniverses of discourse of different scientific theories or branches\nvia exhaustive material compositional relations (1958: 6). This\nessentially provides an empirical mapping between the two scientific\nbranches. Microreduction then combines these two, and thus\namounts to a Kemeny-Oppenheim reduction between two scientific\ntheories plus the fact that T1 is at a lower compositional level than\nT2. \nIn this framework, O&P suggest ordering the branches of sciences\nso that the major potential reductions standing between the current\nsituation and unified science can be identified. For this purpose,\nthey propose six “reductive levels” (1958: 9): Social\ngroups; (Multicellular) living things; Cells; Molecules; Atoms;\nElementary particles. The branch of science with the things of a given\nlevel as its universe of discourse is a potential microreducer of a\nbranch with the things of the next higher level as its universe of\ndiscourse (O&P 1958: 9). \nO&P’s second use of levels concerns the justificatory role\nthe concept plays for their framework. This role is anticipated by\nO&P’s ideas of microreduction and potential microreducer,\nand requires positing ‘levels’ as existing independent of\nthe other elements of their framework. More precisely: The O&P\naccount of reduction essentially assumes the existence of certain\nempirical facts captured by potential microreducers, which are then\naccounted for, i.e., justified, by postulating the existence of\n‘levels’. O&P considered this dual\nepistemic-ontological importance of ‘levels’ to be a\nsignificant contribution provided by their layer-cake account apart\nfrom its role in explicating microreduction. Speaking to the epistemic\nordering of the sciences, they say: \nThe idea of reductive levels employed in our discussion suggests what\nmay plausibly be regarded as a natural order of sciences. For\nthis purpose, it suffices to take as ‘fundamental\ndisciplines’ the branches corresponding to our levels. It is\nunderstandable that many of the well-known orderings of things have a\nrough similarity to our reductive levels, and that corresponding\norderings of sciences are more or less similar to our order of 6\n‘fundamental disciplines’. (O&P 1958: 28, emphasis\nadded) \nThis shows that O&P assumed that the structure of the sciences\nfollows the structure of nature. Though they acknowledge the numerous\nprecedents to this hierarchical ordering of the sciences (e.g.,\nComte’s pyramid of the sciences, 1958: 28), O&P considered\ntheir layer-cake account to be superior to these other\n“intuitive” senses of the order of sciences, since the\nexistence of levels themselves are grounded in the stepwise,\ncompositional continuity of nature:  \n[I]t does not seem to have been realized that these orderings are\n‘natural’ in a deeper sense, of being based on the\nrelation of potential micro-reducer obtaining between the branches of\nscience. (1958: 28) \nThe problems with the layer-cake account have been well-documented\n(Craver 2007: 172–6; Eronen 2015; Kim 2002; Potochnik &\nMcGill 2012; Rueger & McGivern 2010). For one thing, if we look at\ncontemporary science, the strict correspondence between levels and\nscientific fields breaks down immediately: Fields such as cognitive\nneuroscience span multiple levels, and the level of multicellular\norganisms is studied by a plethora of different scientific disciplines\n(Craver 2005; Bechtel 2008: 145). Likewise, the exhaustive stepwise\ncondition on compositional relations between natural constituents,\nrequiring that entities at one level are composed of only entities at\nthe next lower level, is largely a caricature (e.g., Kim 2002): think\nof blood, nominally a tissue-level phenomenon, which is directly\ncomposed by molecular constituents such as vitamins and water without\nadjacent-level constituents, e.g., cells, playing any intermediary\nrole (Brooks 2017). Finally, and most importantly, the layer-cake\naccount aspires to a comprehensive notion of ‘levels’ that\nis wildly at odds with the way that ‘levels’ is actually\nused in science. Scientists often operate with a much more limited\ndefinition of the levels concept that either (a) is restricted to a\nspecific and local context (see section 2.2) or (b) makes room for\nexceptions to what ‘levels’ expresses. Many biological\nsources in fact are completely aware that levels do not capture a\ncompletely uniform reality, and sometimes remark on important\nexceptions to the rules that are laid down by the levels concept. This\nis most prominently seen when referring to “organisms” in\na piecemeal way so as to capture both multicellular and unicellular\nforms of life (Mader 2010: 2). \nThe account of “levels of mechanisms” introduced by Bill\nBechtel (2008) and Carl Craver (2007) has recently become the standard\nview of levels in philosophy of neuroscience. The context of this\naccount is the paradigm of “new mechanism” that currently\ndominates philosophy of neuroscience and large parts of philosophy of\nscience more generally (see the entry\n mechanisms in science).\n In levels of mechanisms, there are mechanisms at higher levels and\ntheir components at lower levels. The mechanistic account proposes a\ncontextualized conception (as opposed to the comprehensive conception\nof the layer-cake) that articulates levels in terms of constitutive\nparthood within a mechanism (Craver 2007: 188–189; Kaplan 2015:\n20; see also Cummins 1975 for an early expression of this idea). This\napproach offers several advantages over the layer-cake account: For\none thing, it abandons the goal of providing a global or comprehensive\nunderstanding of levels that applies homogeneously to all systems in\nnature. Instead, the aim is to construe levels in a scientifically\ninformed manner whereby level demarcations only make sense on\ncase-based grounds (see also Love 2012 for a local approach to levels\nthat is not explicitly tied to the notion of a mechanism). The\nmechanistic account also completely eschews any tidy correspondence\nbetween the structure of the natural world and the structure of the\nnatural sciences: Levels of mechanisms are levels in nature,\nand there is no straightforward mapping from these levels to theories\nor fields of science (Craver 2007: 176). Finally, the mechanistic\naccount of levels supports a positive account of pluralistic,\nmultilevel explanation that emerges as a powerful alternative to\naccounts of reductionism in biology (Craver 2005; cf. Brigandt 2010:\n297). \nMore specifically, levels of mechanisms have been defined as\nfollows: \nIn levels of mechanisms, the relata are behaving mechanisms at higher\nlevels and their components at lower levels. … The interlevel\nrelationship is as follows: X’s Φ-ing is at a lower\nmechanistic level than Ψ-ing if and only if X’s Φ-ing is\na component in the mechanism for S’s Ψ-ing. Lower level\ncomponents are organized together to form higher-level components.\n(Craver 2007: 189) \nWithin a mechanism, the relevant parts are … working\nparts—the parts that perform the operations that enable the\nmechanism to realize the phenomenon of interest. These may be of\ndifferent sizes, but they are distinguished by the fact that they\nfigure in the functioning of the mechanism. It is the set of working\nparts that are organized and whose operations are coordinated to\nrealize the phenomenon of interest that constitute a level. (Bechtel\n2008: 146) \nSo far, these characterizations suggest that there are just two\nlevels, the level of the mechanism and the level of its components.\nHowever, when we take into account that a component can also be\nmechanism in itself, this picture is expanded into a multilevel\nhierarchy: The components of that nested mechanism then form a third\nlevel, which is two levels lower than the overall mechanism (Bechtel\n2008: 147). This mechanistic decomposition can be repeated as many\ntimes as necessary; there is no a priori limit to the number of levels\nin a mechanism.  \nThe standard example of levels of mechanisms is the case of spatial\nmemory and long-term potentiation (LTP; Craver 2007: 165–170).\nIn the spatial memory mechanism, four levels of mechanisms can be\nidentified: the level of spatial memory, the level of spatial map\nformation, the cellular-electrophysiological level, and finally the\nmolecular level. In this hierarchy, entities at each lower level are\ncomponents in the higher-level mechanism. For example, an NMDA\nreceptor at the molecular level is a component of the LTP mechanism at\nthe cellular level, and the LTP mechanism is in turn a component of\nthe hippocampal mechanism of memory consolidation (at the level of\nspatial map formation). The hippocampal mechanism of memory\nconsolidation then contributes to the overall mechanism at the level\nof spatial memory, which is the highest level and includes things such\nas the mouse performing behavioral tasks (e.g., navigating a water\nmaze). \nLevels of mechanisms share some key features with the more standard\naccounts of levels of organization: They are by definition\ncompositional, entities at higher levels are typically larger than\nentities at lower levels, and levels of mechanisms can potentially\namount to local peaks of regularity and predictability (Craver 2007:\n190; see next section). However, levels of mechanisms are far more\nlimited and minimalistic than any other extant approaches to levels of\norganization. First of all, as already mentioned, levels of mechanisms\ncan only be identified on a case-by-case basis, and different\nmechanisms can have entirely different levels. For example, the set of\nlevels in the mechanism of protein folding is very different from the\nlevels in the spatial memory mechanism. \nMoreover, even within one mechanism, the question whether two items\nare at the same or different levels often has no well-defined answer.\nThis is due to the fact that levels are defined solely in terms of\ndirect part-whole (or component-mechanism) relationships. For example,\nNMDA receptors and synaptic vesicles are components of the cellular\nLTP mechanisms, and thus can be said to be at the same level. The\ncomponents of NMDA receptors in turn include things such as glutamate\nbinding sites and glutamate ions, whereas the components of synaptic\nvesicles include things such as transport proteins. However, as\nglutamate binding sites and transport proteins are neither components\nof one another nor direct components in the same (sub)mechanism, they\nare neither at the same level nor at different levels (Bechtel 2008:\n147). The question how they are related levels-wise has no answer in\nthe mechanistic framework. What this means is that even within a\nspecific mechanism, levels of mechanisms do not form horizontal layers\nthat span across the mechanism, but rather small islands or spotlights\nformed by the working parts of a (sub)mechanism. Another implication\nis that even identical things (e.g., NMDA molecules) in the same\nmechanism are often not at the same level (Eronen 2013). Recently\nCraver (2015) has argued that the whole idea of being “at the\nsame level” is in fact unimportant or even meaningless in the\ncontext of levels of mechanisms; it is sufficient that there is a\nclear sense in which mechanisms are at a higher level relative to\ntheir components (and the components are at a lower level relative to\nthe mechanism as a whole), and this does not require that the\ncomponents or mechanisms also form horizontal levels.  \nA further problem that the mechanistic account shares with the\nlayer-cake account is that it is embedded within a conceptual\nframework where ‘levels’ are defined in terms of other\ntechnical terms that are more foundational in that framework (Brooks\n2017). For instance, the layer-cake account was originally embedded in\nOppenheim and Putnam’s overarching project of arguing for the\nunity of science, and their understanding of ‘levels’ was\noriginally in part conceived to explicate how microreduction works.\nThe mechanistic account for its part is embedded within the New\nMechanism’s program of explicating mechanistic explanation and\nmechanisms; since “levels of mechanisms” largely overlap\nwith technical terms that define what a mechanism is, it is a\nlegitimate question what distinct notion of ‘levels’\nresults at all that is not directly derivable from the notion of a\nmechanism (cf. Eronen 2013). \nIn this light, it is clear that levels of mechanisms are only\ndistantly related to earlier attempts at elucidating levels in the\nlife sciences, and have many features that we intuitively would not\nassociate with the idea of levels (Eronen 2013, 2015). However, there\nis no doubt that the relationships of mechanistic composition that\nlevels of mechanisms track are as such crucially important for\nunderstanding and explaining biological organization. \nMarie Kaiser (2015) seeks to recover a more general notion of\n‘levels’ along the lines of the mechanistic account in a\nway that escapes the account’s restrictiveness. Kaiser’s\nfocus here is to relax the conditions under which we consider\nsomething a level (2015: 183–185): First, instead of defining\nlevels in terms of working components of mechanisms, she suggests to\nthink of levels in terms of (biological) part-whole relations\ngenerally, that is, in a way that is not derived from the\ndefinition of a mechanism. Second, Kaiser suggests that a level can\nalso include things that belong to the same “general biological\nkind” as some parts of the higher-level system in question\n(2015: 183–185): In this way, levels expand beyond the\nboundaries of an organism or mechanism. How this approach avoids the\nproblems of general levels of organization discussed below (section\n2.4) has not been explicitly spelled out. For further attempts at\nexpanding or developing the notion of levels of mechanisms, see\nBertolaso & Buzzoni (2017) and Harbecke (2015). \nBoth the layer-cake and the mechanistic approach to levels aim at\ndefining levels in the sense of giving at least necessary conditions\nfor what constitutes a level. William Wimsatt (1976a, 1994) takes a different approach\nand sets out to characterize the key features that levels of\norganization typically (but not necessarily) exhibit across different\ninstances. His aim is to delineate major structural or organizational\nfeatures of nature, of which levels of organization are the most\nsalient ones. First, levels are compositional and form nested\nhierarchical structures, so that wholes at lower levels function as\nparts at higher levels. Second, levels of organization are a  \ndeep, non-arbitrary, and extremely important feature of the\nontological architecture of our natural world, and almost certainly of\nany world which could produce, and be inhabited or understood by,\nintelligent beings. (Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 203])  \nIn other words, Wimsatt considers levels to be units that “cut\nnature at its joints” (1976a: 237). \nA further feature of levels of organization is that they are  \nconstituted by families of entities usually of comparable size and\ndynamical properties, which characteristically interact primarily with\none another. (Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 204])  \nA helpful metaphor that Wimsatt uses to illustrate this is that we can\nthink of theories or models of specific levels as sieves of different\nsizes that sift out things with the appropriate size and dynamical\nproperties (Wimsatt 1976a: 237). Thus, theories at the levels of\norganisms sift out roughly organism-sized things that are capable of\nreproduction and primarily interact with each other. \nFinally, and perhaps most importantly,  \n[l]evels of organization can be thought of as local maxima of\nregularity and predictability in the phase space of alternative modes\nof organization of matter. (1976a: 209; see also 1976a: 238)  \nThis point is “the closest that [Wimsatt] will come to a\ndefinition” (1976a: 209), and requires some explanation. The\nidea is roughly that patterns and regularities that can be used as a\nbasis for prediction and explanation are found clustered around\ncertain scales, and such clusters indicate levels of organization.\nThus, if we plot regularity and predictability against (size) scale,\nthen levels of organization will appear as peaks in the plot (see\nFigure). The entities that we find at these “local maxima”\nwill exhibit stable regularities in virtue of the criteria (size,\nrate, dynamic properties, etc.) with which they are grouped into\nlevels, and these regularities can also serve as the basis for\nreliable predictability. Moreover, levels of organization comprise\n“the most probable states of matter” (1976a:\n239), meaning that if we could vary the initial conditions, under a\nrange of conditions natural selection or other selection processes\nwould result in the same levels (Wimsatt 1976a: 238–239). For\nexample, if the level of molecules is a level of organization in\nWimsatt’s sense, then there should be a peak in regularity and\npredictability at the scale(s) where molecules are located, and\nmolecules should be the most probable mode of organization of matter\nunder a range of conditions.  \nFigure. Wimsatt, created in 1973; used\nwith permission. \nWimsatt points out many other features that levels may have: For\nexample, processes at higher levels tend to happen at slower rates\nthan processes at lower levels, higher level properties are typically\nmultiply realized by lower level properties, and higher-level causal\nrelationships are dynamically autonomous in the sense of being largely\nindependent of what happens at lower-levels. What differentiates\ndifferent levels will also vary between instances, and may include\npart-whole distinctions, the magnitudes of forces by which things\ninteract, or, pragmatically, considerations of size of different\nconstituents. Importantly, Wimsatt also argues that in contexts where\npart-whole relationships become too complex, such as in the\norganization of biological systems, levels of organization break down,\nand in these cases a more appropriate organizational notion is\n“perspective” (Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 227]). Perspectives are\n(incomplete) accounts of systems based on a set of variables, and in\ncontrast to levels, need not have any part-whole structure. For\nexample, we can approach organisms from anatomical, physiological or\ngenetic perspectives, each perspective coming with a proprietary set of\nvariables. \nBy including so many caveats and possible but unnecessary\ncharacteristics of levels, Wimsatt makes his account extremely\nversatile and wide in scope, but at the same time open to charges of\nvagueness or inconsistency (cf. Craver 2007: 182–183). It\ncontains a multitude of criteria that levels could but do not\nnecessarily have to satisfy, so that almost any set of entities that\nare in some respect similar to one another could be said to form a\nlevel. Moreover, the individual criteria as such also raise many\nquestions. For example, how should we understand the “local\nmaxima of regularity and predictability”? What kinds of\nregularities should we include—only causal generalizations, or\nalso regularities describing associational or compositional relations\n(Craver 2007: 182–183)? How do we count or\nestimate the number of regularities on a given scale? How do these\npeaks match with the other proposed criteria, such as the part-whole\norganization of levels? \nThese worries are to some extent alleviated by taking into account an\nimportant background idea in Wimsatt’s approach: Levels of\norganization and the entities that occupy them should be\nrobust, meaning that they should be detectable, measurable,\nderivable, definable, and so on, in a variety of independent\nways (1981 [2007: 63–4]; 1994 [2007: 210]). In other words, they\nshould exhibit redundancy between independent means of accessing,\ndetecting or defining them, and therefore should not depend on any\nsingle criterion or defining feature. Thus, if levels of organization\nare robust, the choice of criteria, or the problems of some individual\ncriterion, will not be crucial. However, the extent to which there are\nsuch robust levels of organization in nature remains an open\nquestion. \nDespite the familiarity of scientists and philosophers with the levels\nconcept, calls for its dismissal or de-emphasis in the scientific\nlexicon are increasingly common (Eronen 2013, 2015; Guttman 1976;\nLadyman & Ross 2007;\nPotochnik & McGill 2012; Rueger & McGivern 2010; Thalos 2013;\nfor rebuttals see also DiFrisco 2017; Brooks 2017). For one thing,\nnature may simply be too messy to fit any layer-cake style picture.\nConsider as an illustration the putative level of\n“organisms.” Blue whales and yeast cells are both clearly\norganisms and thus should nominally be located at this level, but each\ncomprises radically different kinds of entities with radically\ndifferent properties (Potochnik & McGill 2012). This may still be\npalatable, but when we consider the next lower level, namely the one\nindicated by the components of these organisms, the picture of levels\nas neat horizontal layers breaks down completely. The components of\nblue whales include things such as organs, tissues and cells, whereas\nyeast cells are composed of things like the cell membrane, nucleus and\nmitochondria (cf. Potochnik & McGill 2012). Furthermore, the whale\nis in part composed of various symbionts, including gut bacteria. Such\nsymbionts are at the same time components of the whale and organisms\nin themselves. Thus, the components of different kinds organisms do\nnot form any homogeneous “level”. \nThese problems are not just due to the difficulties of defining what\nan organism is. Similar issues arise when we consider the components\nof cells, such as the cell membrane and mitochondria—their\nsubcomponents (e.g, lipid molecules and the outer mitochondrial\nmembrane respectively) also exhibit too much heterogeneity to form a\nneat “level” (cf. Eronen 2013). Moreover, the same kinds\nof things can be parts in very different higher-level wholes: For\nexample, hydrogen ions can be free-standing components in the\noxidative phosphorylation mechanism that involves the cell membrane as\na component, but they can also be components of the lipid molecules\nthat make up the cell membranes (Bechtel 2008: 147). \nMore generally, Potochnik and McGill (2012) argue that\n‘levels’ imposes a radically false, rigid uniformity onto\nnature: \nThe basic idea [behind ‘levels’] is that\nhigher-level entities are composed of (and only of)\nlower-level entities, but the prevalent concept of hierarchical\norganization involves stronger claims as well. The compositional\nhierarchy is often taken to involve stratification into discrete\nand universal levels of organization. It is also often assumed\nthat levels are nested, that is, that an entity at any level is\ncomposed of aggregated entities at the next lower level.\n(Potochnik & McGill 2012: 121; emphasis added) \nThis identifies these problem with the “basic idea” of the\nlevels concept itself. They continue: \nIndeed, the very notion of stratified levels depends on not\nonly the ubiquity, but also the uniformity, of part-whole composition.\nFor strata to emerge, atoms must always compose molecules, populations\nmust always compose communities, and so forth. But the uniformity of\ncomposition needed for stratified levels simply does not\nexist. (2012: 126; emphasis added; see also Guttman 1976: 113;\nThalos 2013: 10) \nThis comprehensive, uniform rigidity in turn undermines other features\nattributed to levels of organization. One of these features is the\nsupposed epistemic merit (or fault) inherently exhibited by natural\nconstituents due to their position at a particular level (Potochnik\n& McGill 2012. 129–30). For instance, reductionists\nfrequently argue that molecular-level explanations are generally more\nsecure, more fundamental, or otherwise superior to explanations citing\nhigher-level structures like chromosomes or cells (and conversely,\nanti-reductionists claim that higher-level constituents are often\nnecessary for producing adequate explanations). However, as has been\npointed out by many authors, blanket attributions of significance like\nthese are deeply misleading (e.g., Wimsatt 1976a; Jackson & Pettit\n1992; cf. Potochnik & McGill 2012: 129; Noble 2012: 56; Craver\n2007: 191). One reason for this is that particular levels exhibit\nepistemic merit only in regard to what is being investigated. As such,\nwhat is taken to be the relevant level will shift depending on what\nstructures or processes comprise the focus of scientists’\ninvestigative tasks, and hence no level will have inherent or\nprincipled epistemic superiority. Moreover, epistemic products like\nexplanations and theories in biology rarely exhibit a monolevel\nstructure, but rather include multiple levels simultaneously (e.g.,\nSchaffner 1993: 97–8, 387; Mitchell 2003: 147; Craver 2007). \nThe basic conclusion that Potochnik and McGill and other levels\nskeptics draw from this is the following. The levels concept precludes\na sophisticated discussion of philosophical and scientific issues by\nimposing an overly simplistic representation of science and nature.\nSo, although perhaps no one would deny the attractiveness of\n‘levels’ in seeking to make complex natural systems\ntractable to analysis, depicting these systems using the concept seems\nto do far more harm than good. Burton S. Guttman is very clear on\nthis, stating that “if it is stated in any but the sloppiest and\nmost general terms, [the concept of levels] is a useless and even\nmisleading concept” (Guttman 1976: 112). Similarly, Miriam\nThalos emphasizes “the conceit of levels” and argues that\n“the notion of levels provides no useful philosophical ideas\nwhatever” (Thalos 2013: 13). \nThis levels-skepticism has also a more constructive side. Several\nauthors have suggested replacing or reinterpreting levels talk in\nterms of other concepts, most importantly scale (Eronen 2013, 2015;\nNoble 2012; Potochnik & McGill 2012; see also P.S. Churchland\n& Sejnowski 1992; McCauley 2009; Rueger & McGivern 2010). The\nmotivation behind this is that the problems associated with levels of\norganization can be avoided if more well-defined notions are applied\ninstead. For instance, the notion of scale arguably does not\nlead to the same kinds of problems as the idea of levels of\norganization. All that it is needed for arranging things on a scale is\nmeasuring some quantitative property of those things. Scales also have\nthe advantage of being entirely continuous, while levels require\nplacing things at distinct and discrete positions in the hierarchy\n(Eronen 2015; Potochnik & McGill 2012). The scale that is the most\nobviously relevant one in this context is the size scale, which is\nbased on how big things are: Organisms are usually (though not always)\nbigger than cells, which are bigger than molecules, which are bigger\nthan atoms, and so on. However, also the time scale (the rate at which\nprocesses occur) is crucially important for understanding biological\norganization (Simon 1962; DiFrisco 2017): Interactions between\norganisms (e.g., sexual reproduction) take place at much slower rates\nthan interactions between cells (e.g., synaptic communication), which\nagain are slower than interactions between molecules (e.g., receptor\nbinding). \nThis “deflationary” approach (Eronen 2013, 2015), where\nlevels are reduced or deflated to more well-defined concepts, is also\nconsistent with the idea that at some scales we may find peaks of\nregularity or predictability (Wimsatt 1994), or clusters of causal\nrelationships (Potochnik & McGill 2012). However, to what extent\nsuch peaks or clusters can be discerned in biological systems is an\nopen question. It also remains to be seen whether the deflationary\napproach is sufficient for accounting for the role of levels of\norganization in biological theories and explanations. \nLevels of organization figure into a number of perennial debates in\nphilosophy of science. Here we go through three broad topics where\nlevels traditionally have and continue to play a prominent role:\nReduction, antireductionism and pluralism, and downward causation.\nWithin these topics, we focus on issues and theories that directly\ninvolve levels. \nAs we saw above, Oppenheim and Putnam introduced their highly\ninfluential view of levels in the context of the reductive unity of\nscience. Since then, levels have also continued to play an important\nrole in debates on reductionism (see the entry\n reductionism in biology).\n Questions of reductionism are often explicitly formulated in terms of\nlevels: Do higher level properties, theories, or explanations reduce\nto lower level ones? \nIn the classical Nagelian account (Nagel 1961), reduction amounts to\nderiving a theory that is to be reduced from a more fundamental\nreducing theory on the basis of two conditions: deducibility and\nconnectability (see the entry\n scientific reduction).\n The standard example is the reduction of thermodynamics to\nstatistical mechanics. Nagel thought that from the laws of statistical\nmechanics one can derive the laws of thermodynamics (deducibility),\nwith the help of “bridge principles” that connect the\nterms of these two theories (connectability; Nagel 1961: ch. 11;\nSchaffner 1967). Nagel’s original approach to reduction has been\ncriticized from many angles, but in the present context, the most\nrelevant criticism is that the classical model ignores the distinction\nbetween interlevel and intralevel reductions in\nscience (Wimsatt 1976a, 1976b; McCauley 1996). Intralevel (or\nsuccessional) settings involve competing theories within a particular\nscience and within a particular level, for example the phlogiston\ntheory and the caloric theory of heat. Interlevel settings, on the\nother hand, involve theories at different levels of organization that\nthereby have differing explananda, terminology and methodology: for\nexample, cognitive psychology and molecular neuroscience.\nNagel’s model in its classic form treats these different\ncontexts equally. Other shortcomings of the Nagelian account are that\nit only applies to (formalized) theories, ignoring other products of\nscience, and that it fails to incorporate the fact that the reducing\ntheory often corrects the reduced theory (see, e.g., Walter &\nEronen 2011). For these and many other reasons, it is widely agreed\nthat the Nagelian model fails to reconstruct reductive relations as\nthey appear in actual science (Wimsatt 1976b, 1979), and that the model in\nits original form is inapplicable to actual biological cases (Kaiser\n2012). \nProblems of the Nagelian model led to the development of alternative\naccounts based on the same basic idea, which actively incorporated the\nidea of levels into their framework (Hooker 1981; P.S. Churchland\n1986; Schaffner 1993; Bickle 1998, 2003). This culminated in the\n“New Wave” model of reduction, where intertheoretic\nrelations form a continuum ranging from complete elimination to\nretentive Nagel-style reduction (Bickle 1998). For a summary of this\nmodel, see the entry\n scientific reduction\n §2.6. In the present context, what is noteworthy is that the\ncases that inspire the eliminativist aspirations of the New Wave model\nencompass only intralevel, i.e., successive, relations, while\nthe conclusions they draw concern cases of the interlevel kind\n(particularly the relationship between psychology and neuroscience;\nMcCauley 1996). Historical cases of elimination, such as the\nreplacement of the phlogiston theory with the caloric theory of heat,\nhave arguably all been cases where a theory is replaced by a successor\nat roughly the same level of organization. Theories at different\nlevels of organization can coevolve and exert selective pressures on\neach other’s terminology, practices, explanations, and such\n(Wimsatt 1976b [2007: 252]; P.S. Churchland 1986: 363, 373), but this\nrarely if ever results in elimination or replacement of one of the\ntheories. \nOther accounts of reduction also countenance the levels concept,\nalbeit in different ways. In his “ruthless” account of\nreductionism, Bickle (2003) abandons the idea of reduction progressing\nstepwise from level to level, and argues that cellular and molecular\nneuroscience can directly replace psychology. If one can intervene\nonto the molecular level to change variables at the behavioral level,\nthen, Bickle contends, one has discovered the “genuine”\ncausal mechanism for those variables (Bickle 2003). Here ‘levels’\nfigure into ruthless reductionism as useful fictions, where\nintermediary levels such as tissues, organs, and the like provide a\nscaffolding for emerging molecular-level explanations. These\nintermediary levels exhibit “merely” heuristic value, but\nonly in the service of constructing behavior-to-molecules reductions\n(Bickle 2003: 130). \nMore recently, Hüttemann and Love (2011) note that part-whole\nreduction in particular has become a widely-endorsed alternative to\nthe Nagelian framework (see also Brigandt 2013: 77). In documenting\nsome of the facets that this form of reduction has acquired in the\nintervening years, they put forward as two aspects of reductive\nexplanation compositionality and causality\n(Hüttemann & Love 2011: 4). In reductive contexts, both are\nexpressed in levels-laden language. Compositionality, for instance, is\ncouched in ‘levels’ in that the very notions of part and\nwhole in biological contexts correspond to respectively lower- and\nhigher-level status (cf. Kaiser 2015: 192; Winther 2006). This is\nreflected in the issues they raise for identifying and evaluating\nreductive explanations as reductive. One of these,\n“intrinsicality”, refers to the constraint of a part that\nit always be contained within, or inherent to, the whole to which it\nbelongs (Hüttemann & Love 2011: 9–10).\n‘Levels’ offers one way of straightforwardly capturing\nthis feature of part-whole relations (cf. 2011: 5). Another feature is\n“fundamentality,” which  \ncorresponds to the assumption that higher levels of organization are\nreduced to lower levels of organization: parts are taken as more\nfundamental than the compound. (2011: 5–6)  \nAs these features are applied to evaluate whether an explanation is\njustifiably considered “reductive” or not, by extension\n‘levels’ can be seen here as contributing to the criteria\nof adequacy to the conceptual issue of reduction. Kaiser (2015) goes\nfurther than this approach in claiming that a “lower-level\ncharacter” is a necessary condition for an explanation to even\nbe considered reductive (2015: 188). \nThe idea of levels has also figured prominently into arguments for\nantireductionism and pluralism. In his classic treatise, Philip\nKitcher (1984) elevates the level concept to a centerpiece of the\nantireductionist position. According to Kitcher, the reductionist\naspiration of reducing classical Mendelian to molecular genetics will\nnot pan out because molecular constituents do not capture the causal\nrelations between Mendelian constituents (e.g., chromosomes) and\nheritable traits. The reason for this is that the cytological\nprocesses that form the basis for Mendelian patterns of heredity (such\nas meiosis) form a natural kind that cannot be delineated at the\nmolecular level (1984: 349; Brigandt 2013: 76). Importantly, Kitcher\ngrounds this in the structure of the world as captured by the levels\nconcept:  \nAnti-reductionism construes the current division of biology not simply\nas a temporary feature of our science stemming from our cognitive\nimperfections but as the reflection of levels of organization in\nnature. (1984: 371, emphasis modified; Rosenberg 1985: 119, makes\na similar statement)  \nElevating the levels concept even further, Kitcher makes levels\n(albeit a layer-cake variety of the term) part of the conception of\nantireductionism itself, concluding that  \nto the extent that we can make sense of the present explanatory\nstructure within biology—that division of the field into\nsubfields corresponding to levels of organization in nature—we\ncan also understand the antireductionist doctrine. (Kitcher 1984:\n373) \nIn a more recent defense of antireductionism, Robert McCauley (1996,\n2007) expands on Wimsatt’s intra-interlevel distinction to plea\nfor a multilevel explanatory pluralism between higher- and lower-level\ntheories. McCauley targets the New Wave model where intertheory\nrelations result in a spectrum of consequences, ranging from identity\nto elimination, for higher-level theories (P.M. Churchland 1979; P.M.\nChurchland and P.S. Churchland 1990; and later Bickle 1998). He argues\nthat a single spectrum of reductive consequences misrepresents the\nnature of intertheory coevolution. Intralevel reductions, focusing on\nreduction in terms of replacement, do not capture the historical\ndynamics involved in evaluating interlevel cases, and elimination is\nvirtually nonexistent in interlevel cases. Moreover, eliminating or\nreducing higher-level theories would also undermine the status of\nthe higher-level’s scientific institutions. As this rarely\nhappens, and attributing epistemic, ontological, or methodological\nsuperiority to the lower levels is at best a claim that needs to be\nsubstantiated, reductions appear to be wildly at odds with actual\nscientific practice. Instead, we observe intertheory coevolution,\nwhich proceeds by exploiting the ontological, explanatory, and\nmethodological resources that each theory brings to the table.\nHigher-level theories can offer lower-level theories criteria for\nexternal coherency, novel problem solving strategies, and serve as\nevidentiary sources for lower-level scientific efforts (McCauley 1996:\n32, 35). \nOther arguments for pluralism also take their start from levels of\norganization. Sandra Mitchell (2003), for instance, argues that since\nbiological systems are typically multilevel, this dissipates locating\ncauses within the system from one single level into multiple\ninteracting causes that are simultaneously in effect at the different\nlevels (2003: 147; 2009: 114–5). Mitchell argues on this basis\nfor a broader integrative pluralism that takes itself to be\nsuggested by the multilevel and multicomponential “ontology of\ncomplex systems” (2009: 109). The basic idea of integrative\npluralism falls out of the fact that biological systems evolve in a\ncontingent manner (2003: 58), thus setting the stage for multilevel\nevolutionary scenarios (2003: 24, 31). This in turn highlights the\npreponderance of ‘emergent properties’ in biological\nsystems, which appear at novel levels of organization out of the\ninteractions of simpler components. Both of these factors inflate the\noverall number of explanatory sources that could contribute to\nexplaining a given phenomenon (2003: 6; 2009: 8). Consequently,\ndiscovering unilateral causes for complex phenomena will not be\nforthcoming (2003: 160). Likewise, Ingo Brigandt (2010, 2013) emphasizes the pursuance of\ninvestigation at multiple levels of organization as a fact about\nscientific practice (2010: 303), but also as cause to articulate the\nlocalized significance of explanatory contributions to particular\nproblems, as in the case of evo-devo explanations (2010: 303).  \nThis kind of multilevel pluralism is also defended by the supporters\nof the New Mechanism (Bechtel 2008; Craver 2005, 2007; Brigandt 2010:\n297). As McCauley (2007) points out, mechanistic explanation can be\nseen as explanatory pluralism “writ small”: In each\nlocalized mechanistic context, several levels (understood as levels of\nmechanisms) are needed to fully explain the phenomenon (see, however,\nFazekas and Kertész (2011) and Soom (2012), who argue that the\ncommitments of New Mechanism are incompatible with robust\nantireductionism). \nLevels of organization have traditionally provided the framework for\nthe debate on downward causation, where the question is whether\nhigher-level entities or properties can exert causal influence on\nlower-level ones (e.g., Bechtel 2008; Campbell 1974; Emmeche et al.\n1997, 2000; Kim 1992, 1999; Craver & Bechtel 2007). The idea of\ndownward causation is closely connected to emergentism, and is often\nseen as one of its core tenets (Emmeche et al. 1997, 2000; Kim 1999).\nExamples of putative downward causation include psychological states\ncausing physical behavior, the activity of an organism causing changes\nin the tissues and cells of that organism, and cell-level processes\nsuch as synaptic communication causing molecular changes. Downward\ncausation seems prima facie to be common or even ubiquitous\nin experiments and explanations in the life sciences (Craver &\nBechtel 2007; Love 2012). However, in contemporary philosophy,\ndownward causation is often approached with skepticism. If it is\nunderstood as higher-level things or properties exerting some kind of\nphysically measurable influence on lower-level things, there seems to\nbe no evidence for it (McLaughlin 1992). Downward causation also faces\nmetaphysical difficulties, most importantly the much-debated\ncausal exclusion argument (e.g., Kim 1992, 1999, 2005). To\nput it very roughly, the core of this argument is that if we accept\nthe plausible assumption that all physical occurrences must have\nsufficient physical causes, it is not clear how there could be room\nfor additional higher-level causes of lower-level physical effects.\nFor more on causal exclusion and downward causation, see the entries\n mental causation\n and\n emergent properties. \nAlthough the discussion on downward causation relies heavily on the\nnotion of levels, this notion itself has not received much explicit\nattention. However, recently the account of levels of mechanisms has\nbeen put to use to provide a new take on the issue (Bechtel 2008;\nCraver & Bechtel 2007; Craver 2015). The idea is that genuine\ntop-down or downward causation does not exist; there are just normal\nsame-level causal relationships that sometimes have\n“mechanistically mediated” effects downward in the\nmechanism. What is meant by “mechanistically mediated” is\nthat changes in the higher levels of the mechanism immediately result\nin changes in the lower levels of the mechanisms due to the\nconstitutive relationship between the higher-level mechanism and its\nlower-level components. Mechanistically mediated effects may have the\ninitial appearance of downward causation, but the relationship between\nthe mechanism and its components is constitutive, not causal, and\ntherefore mechanistically mediated effects are not causal. \nTo clarify this, consider the example of Hal’s glucose\nmetabolism (Craver & Bechtel 2007: 559–560). Hal is playing\ntennis, and as he keeps running around and swinging the racket, the\ncells in Hal’s body start taking in and using more glucose. It\nseems that the cause of the increase in Hal’s glucose metabolism\nat the cellular level is Hal playing tennis, which suggests causation\nfrom a higher level (the level of the whole organism playing tennis)\nto a lower level (the cellular level). However, in the framework of\nCraver and Bechtel described above, what is really going on is just\nregular same-level causal relationships at the cellular level: Nerve\nsignals to the muscle cells cause a cascade of events that results in\nincreased glucose metabolism. Hal’s tennis playing activity is\npartly constituted by these cellular mechanisms, and this\nconstitutive relationship is responsible for the illusion of downward\ncausation. As Hal starts to play, there are changes in these\nmechanisms, but only in virtue of them partly making up the tennis\nplaying activity. \nThis approach is appealing, but faces several challenges. First, it\nhas been argued that there are no clear methods of distinguishing\nbetween causal and constitutive relationships in mechanisms (e.g.,\nLeuridan 2011); if this is correct, there seems to be no reason to\nposit that “mechanistically mediated” effects are\nnon-causal. Second, the idea of “normal” intralevel\ncausation is problematic in the framework of levels of mechanisms\n(Eronen 2013). As we have seen in section 2.2, the idea of\n“being at the same level” has little if any significance\nin this framework, so same-level causation cannot be the default or\nnormal type of causation. The idea seems to be rather that there is no\ncausation from a mechanism as a whole to the components of that same\nmechanism, but this is just one specific form of putative downward\ncausation, and how other forms should be treated is left open in this\naccount (Eronen 2013). Third, it is not clear whether higher-level\ncausal processes in mechanisms can be distinct from causal processes\nat lower levels of the mechanism—if not, there are no\nhigher-level causal processes that could have mechanistically mediated\neffects downwards in the mechanism to begin with (Fazekas &\nKertész 2011). \nA different way of approaching downward causation in biology is to\nexplicate it in terms of higher-level constraints or boundary\nconditions. The idea is that the behavior of lower-level things is\nconstrained by the higher-level whole that they are a part of, and\ntherefore explaining the behavior of these lower-level things is not\npossible exclusively at the lower level, but requires appealing to\nhigher-level factors (e.g., Bishop 2008; Campbell 1974; Emmeche et al.\n1997, 2000; Kistler 2009; Noble 2012; Sperry 1969). In a classic\narticle, Donald Campbell expressed this idea as follows:\n“processes at the lower levels of a hierarchy are restrained by\nand act in conformity to the laws of the higher level” (Campbell\n1974: 180). For example, explaining protein folding (at the level of\nmolecules) seems to require appealing to factors in the environment at\nthe cellular level, such as the presence of chaperones (Love\n2012). \nIt is widely agreed that downward or top-down explanation of this kind\nis required in science. The controversial and unsettled question is\nwhether these cases also involve causation in a substantial sense, or\nwhether it would be more appropriate to just designate them as some\nform of downward determination or explanation (see, e.g., Hulswit\n2005). It should also be noted that both this approach and that of\nCraver and Bechtel are largely silent on the issue of downward\ncausation understood as causation across levels of organization or\nscales in a broader sense, for example, between a nerve cell and\nmolecules that are not part of that same nerve cell, or between\npsychological states and behavior. \nBesides the more philosophical debates discussed above, levels of\norganization also play an important conceptual role in biological\nresearch and theory. Interestingly, this growing body of literature on\nlevels in evolutionary biology is almost entirely disconnected from\nthe debates on levels in philosophy of science discussed above. \nA prominent example is the issue of levels of selection. In this\ndebate, the hierarchical organization of nature into levels is an\nimportant background assumption, as the aim is to find out at which\nlevel(s) of the biological hierarchy natural selection is taking place\n(Griesemer 2000; Okasha 2006). Although Darwin’s original\naccount was focused on evolution at the level of organisms, arguably\nthe conditions for natural selection can be formulated abstractly\nwithout referring to any specific kinds of entities, which allows for\nnatural selection to operate at any level where the conditions are\nsatisfied (Griesemer 2000; Lewontin 1970). Since the 1970s, the debate\non levels of selection has kept on growing and extending to different\nareas, though no precise consensus has been reached. Positions range\nfrom the gene-centered view, where natural selection is taken to\noperate almost exclusively at the level of genes (e.g., Dawkins 1976;\nWilliams 1966), to the pluralistic multilevel selection theory, which\nallows for natural selection to operate on any level of the biological\nhierarchy where we find the right kind of units (e.g., Sober &\nWilson 1998; Wilson & Wilson 2008). \nOne branch of the levels of selection debate that is particularly\ninteresting from the point of view of levels of organization is the\nissue of evolutionary transitions. Here the focus is on the\nemergence of new levels of organization through evolutionary\nprocesses (Buss 1987: ch. 5; Griesemer 2000; Maynard Smith &\nSzathmáry 1995; Okasha 2006). The background idea is that the\ncomplex hierarchical organization of nature that we observe today must\nitself be a result of evolution, and therefore requires an\nevolutionary explanation. For example, somehow prokaryotes evolved to\neukaryotic cells, single-celled organisms evolved to multicellular\norganisms, individual animals evolved to colonies, and so on. In their\nhighly influential book, Maynard Smith and Szathmáry (1995)\nproposed that the characteristic feature of major evolutionary\ntransitions is that entities that were capable of replicating\nindependently before the transitions are only capable of replicating\nas parts of higher-level wholes after the transitions (see also Buss\n1987). For example, after a single-celled organism has evolved into a\nmulticellular organism, the cells of the organism can no longer\nreplicate independently of the organism as a whole. For more on levels\nof selection and evolutionary transitions, see Okasha (2006) and the\nentry\n units and levels of selection. \nIn these debates, the notion of levels of organization is typically\nused as a primitive term that is assumed to be clear enough and is\ntherefore left undefined (Griesemer 2005). A notable exception is\nOkasha (2006), who puts forward a proposal for understanding levels of\norganization in natural selection, building on earlier work by McShea\n(2001). The starting point is the part-whole relationship, which is\nthe standard definitive feature of levels of organization, but taken\nalone is insufficient for defining levels of organization: A big heap\nof sand is made up of smaller heaps of sands, but does not constitute\na higher level of organization. Therefore, Okasha (2006) and McShea\n(2001) propose two further conditions: The parts that form\nhigher-level wholes must interact with each other, and they\nmust be homologous with organisms in a free-living state. For\nexample, the cells that compose organisms interact with each other and\nare homologous to free-living unicellular organisms, and therefore\nconstitute a level of organization. On the other hand, candidates such\nas heaps of sand are ruled out, as they do not significantly interact\nwith each other, nor are they homologous to free-living organisms. \nAnother context in biology where the nature of levels has received\nexplicit attention is the “hierarchy theory of evolution”\ndeveloped by Niles Eldredge and colleagues (Eldredge et al. 2016, Vrba\n& Eldredge 1984). In this theoretical framework, levels and\nhierarchies are taken to be fundamentally important ontological\nfeatures of nature:  \nBiological evolutionary theory is ontologically committed to the\nexistence of nested hierarchies in nature and attempts to explain\nnatural phenomena as a product of complex dynamics of real\nhierarchical systems. (Tëmkin & Eldredge 2015: 184)  \nIn the hierarchy theory of evolution, a distinction is made between\ntwo types of hierarchies and the corresponding levels (Eldredge\n1996; Vrba & Eldredge\n1984): The ecological and the genealogical\nhierarchy. In both kinds of hierarchies, higher-level things are\nformed through specific interactions among lower-level things. In the\necological hierarchy, these interactions are exchanges of matter and\nenergy, such as consuming and gathering resources, and in this\nhierarchy, we find things such as cells, organisms, avatars and\necosystems. In the genealogical hierarchy, the defining activity\nthrough which levels are formed is the transmission of information\nthrough replication, and the hierarchy includes things such as cells,\norganisms, demes and species. Note that cells and organisms appear in\nboth hierarchies, but in the ecological hierarchy they are seen as\ninteractors, whereas in the genealogical hierarchy they are seen as\nreplicators. \nBesides these theoretical debates, levels of organization also play an\nimportant role in textbooks and other introductory texts in biology\n(e.g., Begon, Townshend & Harper 2006; Lobo 2008; Mader 2010;\nO’Neill et al. 1986). Depictions of levels are ubiquitous in\nbiological textbooks, often appearing in the first few pages and with\na prominent ‘centerfold’ illustration. In this capacity,\nthe levels concept serves as an organizational principle that aids in\nimparting basic knowledge of the study of biology to novice scientists\nearly in their training. Some of the ideas that the levels concept is\nused to introduce to students include (i) the apparent preponderance\nof emergence in living systems, (ii) reductive and non-reductive\napproaches to analyzing biological phenomena (oftentimes with an\nantireductionist gloss), and (iii) the context-sensitivity of posing\nbiological problems. Apart from these introductory uses, levels are\nalso used throughout textbooks to introduce the basic layout of\nmultiple ideas and important phenomena that are themselves ubiquitous\nto different areas of biological study. The hierarchical structure of\nproteins, being comprised of primary, secondary, tertiary, and\nquaternary structures is one important instance. Interestingly,\ntextbooks vary between global and local treatments of levels. On the\none hand, centerfold depictions often represent the canonical levels\nof organization in biology; the series of\natoms-molecules-organelles-cells-tissues-organs-organisms-populations-communities-ecosystems-biosphere make up the basic idea of levels in\nthese contexts. On the other hand, depictions like protein structure\nare strongly localized to only two classes of macromolecules (nucleic\nacids and proteins), while excluding others (lipids, sugars) (Love\n2012: 117). \nAlthough ‘levels of organization’ has been a key concept\nin biology and its philosophy since the early 20th century,\nthere is still no consensus on the nature and significance of the\nconcept. In different areas of philosophy and biology, we find\nstrongly varying ideas of levels, and none of the accounts put forward\nhas received wide acceptance. At the moment, the mechanistic approach\nis perhaps the most promising and acclaimed account, but as we have\nseen, it may be too minimalistic to fulfill the role that levels of\norganization continue to play in biological theorizing. We have also\nnoted that there is a curious disconnect between the tradition ranging\nfrom Oppenheim and Putman to Bechtel, Craver and Wimsatt on the one\nhand, and the discussions of levels in evolutionary biology (e.g.,\nEldredge, McShea, Okasha) on the other. One important aim for future\nresearch would be to bridge this gap.","contact.mail":"daniel.stephen.brooks@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
