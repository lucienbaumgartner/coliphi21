Contemporary mathematics serves as a model for\nhis philosophy of science and provides some important techniques, e.g.,\nas used in his logic. Throughout the corpus, he constructs mathematical\narguments for various theses, especially in the physical writings, but\nalso in the biology and ethics. Finally, Aristotle's philosophy of\nmathematics provides an important alternative to platonism. In this\nregard, there has been a revival of interest in recent years because of\nits affinity to physicalism and fictionalisms based on physicalism.\nHowever, his philosophy of mathematics may better be understood as a\nphilosophy of exact or mathematical sciences. \n\n\n\n\nThis article will explore the influence of mathematical sciences on\nAristotle's metaphysics and philosophy of science and will illustrate\nhis use of mathematics.\n\n\n\nThe late fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E. saw many important\ndevelopments in Greek mathematics, including the organization of basic\ntreatises or elements and developments in conceptions of proof, number\ntheory, proportion theory, sophisticated uses of constructions\n(including spherical spirals and conic sections), and the application\nof geometry and arithmetic in the formation of other sciences,\nespecially astronomy, mechanics, optics, and harmonics. The authors of\nsuch treatises also began the process of creating effective methods of\nconceiving and presenting technical work, including the use of letters\nto identify parts of diagrams, the use of abstract quantities marked by\nletters in proofs instead of actual numerical values, and the use of\nproofs. We cannot know whether Aristotle influenced the authors of\ntechnical treatises or merely reflects current trends. \n\nIn this context, Plato's Academy was fertile ground for controversy\nconcerning how we are to know mathematics (the sorts of principles, the\nnature of proofs, etc.) and what the objects known must be if the\nscience is to be true and not vacuous. Aristotle's treatments of\nmathematics reflect this diversity. Nonetheless, Aristotle's reputation\nas a mathematician and philosopher of mathematical sciences has often\nwaxed and waned. \n\nIn fact, Aristotle's treatises display some of the technically most\ndifficult mathematics to be found in any philosopher before the\nGreco-Roman Age. His technical failures involve conceptually difficult\nareas involving infinite lines and non-homogenous magnitudes. \n\nCommentators on Aristotle from the 2nd century on tended to\ninterpret Aristotle's mathematical objects as mental objects, which\nmade Aristotle more compatible with neo-Platonism. Later the\nmechanistic movement in the late Renaissance treated Aristotle as\ndivorcing mathematics from physical sciences in order to drive a deeper\nwedge between their views and his. Because of this, it has been very\neasy to discount Aristotle as subscribing to a version of psychologism\nin mathematics. These tendencies contribute to the common view that\nAristotle's views mathematics are marginal to his thought. More\nrecently, however, some sympathetic readers have seen Aristotle as\nexpressing a fictionalist version of physicalism, the view that the\nobjects of mathematics are fictional entities grounded in physical\nobjects. To the extent that this view is regarded as a plausible view\nabout mathematics, Aristotle has regained his position. \n\nThere are two important senses in which Aristotle never presents a\nphilosophy of mathematics. Aristotle considers geometry and arithmetic,\nthe two sciences which we might say constitute ancient mathematics, as\nmerely the two most important mathematical sciences. His explanations\nof mathematics always include optics, mathematical astronomy,\nharmonics, etc. Secondly, Aristotle, so far as we know, never devoted a\ntreatise to philosophy of mathematics. Even Metaphysics xiii\nand xiv, the two books devoted primarily to discussions of the nature\nof mathematical objects, are really concerned with diffusing Platonist\npositions that there are immutable and eternal substances over and\nbeyond sensible substances and Pythagorean positions that identify\nnumbers with sensible substances. \n\nAristotle's discussions on the best format for a deductive science in\nthe Posterior Analytics reflect the practice of contemporary\nmathematics as taught and practiced in Plato's Academy, discussions\nthere about the nature of mathematical sciences, and Aristotle's own\ndiscoveries in logic. Aristotle has two separate concerns. One evolves\nfrom his argument that there must be first, unprovable principles for\nany science, in order to avoid both circularity and infinite regresses.\nThe other evolves from his view that demonstrations must be\nexplanatory. (See subsections A, B, and C of §6, Demonstrations\nand Demonstrative Sciences, of the entry\n Aristotle's logic.) \n\nAristotle distinguishes (Posterior Analytics i.2) Two sorts\nof starting points for demonstration, axioms and\nposits. \n\nAristotle divides posits (thesis) into two\ntypes, definitions and hypotheses: \n\nA hypothesis (hupothesis) asserts one\npart of a contradiction, e.g., that something is or is not. \n\nA definition (horismos) does not assert\neither part of a contradiction (or perhaps is without the assertion of\nexistence or non-existence). \n\nSince a definition does not assert or deny, Aristotle probably\nintends us to understand definitions as stipulations or as defining\nexpressions which are equivalent in some way to the defined term. The\ndefinition of unit as ‘indivisible in quantity’ will not\npresuppose that units do or do not exist. Hence, the syllogistic\npremise, ‘A unit is indivisibile in quantity,’ if taken as\npresupposing the existence of units, will not be a definition in this\nsense. Later, of course, Aristotle will allow for many other kinds of\ndefinitions. \n\nThere are many views as to what Aristotle's hypotheses are: (i)\nexistence claims, (ii) any true assumption within a science, and (iii)\nthe stipulation of objects at the beginning of a typical proof in Greek\nmathematics. Examples might be, ‘Let A be a unit,’\n(where the object is stipulated to be a unit) or, more\ncharacteristically of Greek mathematics, ‘Let there be a line\nAB’ (where a line is stipulated to exist, namely\nAB). In fact, all these interpretations may have a modicum of\nwhat Aristotle means. In that case, Aristotle implies that any\nassumption within a science that asserts or denies something is a\nhypothesis. However, he singles out existence claims. How do existence\nclaims work in Aristotle's conceptions of science? From\nPhysics iv, we have claims such as ‘There is\nplace,’ and ‘There is no void.’ However, the examples\nthat Aristotle uses in the Posterior Analytics are claims such\nas that the genus exists, or specifically that there are units, or that\nthere are points and lines. Aristotle also points out that sometimes\nthe hypothesis of the genus is omitted as too obvious. Only by\ncomparing these general claims with their use in Aristotelian\nmathematics can we get a sense of what Aristotle means. Aristotle\nintends us to understand that prior to the demonstrations in a\nscientific treatise, the treatise should state starting propositions.\nThese include general claims broader than the science, definitions\nwhich are stated as stipulations and not as assertions, and a claim\nthat the basic entities ‘exist’. What counts as an\nacceptable existence claim is relative to the actual science. The\nopening of a proof, ‘Let there be a line AB,’ is\nan application of the basic hypothesis of the science. Since Aristotle\nregards such proofs through particular lines as general proofs, the\nopening claim is actually to be understood as standing for the general\nclaim that there are lines. This is how the hypothesis is used as a\npremise. The stipulation, ‘Let there be a triangle\nABC,’ would not be a hypothesis on this interpretation,\nsince he holds that the existence of triangles is to be proved, so that\nthis instantiates a derived proposition. \n\nA science consists of a genus (genos),\nwhat the science is about, and a collection of attributes, what the\nscience says about the genus. The genus or kind is both defined and\nhypothesized to exist. From his examples (points and lines for\ngeometry), it would seem that the genus is to be understood loosely as\nthe fundamental entities in the science. The attributes are defined but\nare not hypothesized as existing. One must prove that the attributes\nbelong to various members of the genus. For example, one must prove\nthat triangles exist, e.g., that some [constructible] figures are\ntriangles. \n\nIf we take very seriously the common view that Aristotle claims that\nevery immediate premise of a demonstration expresses something about an\nexisting entity, then one may well wonder how the principles of\ndemonstration, axioms and posits, can be premises of demonstrations.\nExistence claims and stipulations do not express something about an\nexisting entity. Since Aristotle calls the axioms, ‘those from\nwhich (demonstration arises),’ some have suggested that the\naxioms alone form the premises for a science and that a proof in any\nscience arises by placing genus terms and their definitions in the\naxioms and then substituting terms like ‘triangle’ for\ntheir definitions when they arise in proofs. However, besides pointing\nto the inadequacy of the axioms for this job, it may be objected that\nAristotle also calls the principles of demonstration immediate\nstatements protaseis), i.e., axioms and posits. Another\npossibility is that he regards even stipulations and existence claims\nas premises, as well as other hypotheses, but treats the axioms as\nsomehow more fundamentally the source of proofs. In this case, he has a\nlooser conception of what counts as a premise than many readers would\nexpect. In any case, if his proof theory is to work at all, he must\nallow many more immediate premises than one would find in the\nintroduction to a standard text of ancient Greek mathematics. \n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document: \n\nIn the Posterior Analytics i.4, Aristotle also develops\nthree notions crucial to his theory of scientific claims: ‘of\nevery’, ‘per se’ (kath’ hauto) or ‘in\nvirtue of itself’ (in four ways) and ‘universally’\n(katholou). Although his exposition of these notions is\ntailored to his proof theory, the notions are designed also to\ncharacterize the basic features of any scientific claim, where the\nprincipal examples come mostly from mathematics. (See §6\nDemonstrations and Demonstrative Sciences of the entry on\n Aristotle's logic.) \n\nA is per se1 with respect to\nB iff ‘A’ is in the account which gives\nthe essence of B. Note that Aristotle does not say that\nA belongs to all B (e.g., ‘hair’ occurs\nin the definition of bald, but ‘having hair’ does not\nbelong to a bald person), yet it is presupposed by the use Aristotle\nmakes of it. Aristotle allows that there are immediate statements of\nthe form, A belongs to no B. Mathematical examples:\n‘line’ is in the definition of triangle,\n‘point’ is in the definition of line. \n\nA is per se2 with respect to\nB iff ‘B’ is in the account which gives the\nessence of A and A belongs to B.\nMathematical examples: straight and circular-arc belong to line, odd\nand even to number. Some commentators have held that it is the\ndisjunction which belongs per se2 (e.g., straight or\ncircular-arc belongs per se2 to all lines); others that the\nexamples are that each predicate belongs per se2 to the\nsubject (e.g., straight belongs per se2 to (some) line).\nHowever, Aristotle should know that not all lines are straight or\ncircular. \n\nA is per se3 iff ‘A’\nindicates ‘a this’ (tode ti), i.e.,\n‘A’ refers to just what A\nis. At Post. An.  i.22, Aristotle identifies the per\nse3 with substance, the rock bottom of a syllogistic\nchain. However, one might well ask whether there must be an analogous\nnotion within a science. If so, A would be per se3\nif A is a basic entity in a given science, an instance of the\nkind studied by the science. If so, the per se3 items in\narithmetic would be units. \n\nA is per se4 with respect to\nB iff A belongs to B on account of\nA. Either no mathematical example is given or the examples are\n(depending on how we read the text): straight or curved belongs to line\nand odd or even belongs to number, but these may be cases of per\nse2. The non-mathematical example is: in getting its throat\ncut it dies in virtue of the throat-cutting. \n\nA belongs to B universally iff\nA belongs to all B and A belongs\nto B per se (in virtue of B) and qua itself\n(qua B). Here the notion of ‘per se’ seems to be\nslightly different from those previously mentioned (it has been\nsuggested that the sense is per se4), but, in any case, is\nsaid to be equivalent to ‘qua itself’.  Perhaps we need a\nfifth notion of per se. \n\nB has/is A per se5\n(i.e., in virtue of B) iff A belongs to B\nqua B, i.e., there is no higher genus or kind C of\nB such that A belongs to C and so to\nB in virtue of belonging to C. Again, Aristotle does\nnot mark out per se5 as a separate notion, so that the\nnotion may be subsumed under per se4. Note that unlike per\nse1 and per se2, per se5 is in virtue\nof the subject of the predication. \n\nThe idea here seems to be that: \n\nAn alternative (stronger?) interpretation is that: \n\nAristotle describes the property that a triangle has angles equal to\ntwo right angles as being per se5 (= per se4) and\nuniversal, but also the property of ‘having internal angles equal\nto two right angles’ as per se accidens\n(kath’ hauto sembebêkôs) of triangle. It is\ncommonly thought that these are somehow essential\naccidents. Since these follow from per se properties by\nnecessity, it seems strange to call them accidents at all. Sometimes,\nhowever, it is more appropriate to think of accidents as concomitants,\nthe result of different demonstrative chains. Alternatively, Aristotle\nfrequently uses the same word to indicate consequences. In that case,\nthey should be called per se consequences. \n\nIt should be noted that the proof theory of Aristotle requires that\nall predicates in demonstrations be either per se1 or per\nse2. What is neither per se1 nor per\nse2 is accidental. Hence, per se4 (or per\nse5 if it is a separate notion), and per se accidens should\nbe reducible to these notions in any case. \n\nBecause of the formal success of his logical theory, Aristotle also\nconsiders most mathematical proofs as having the form of a\nuniversal affirmative syllogism, namely Barbara. (See\nthe section on The Syllogistic in the entry on\n Aristotle's logic.)\n This means\nthat most mathematical theorems are one thing A said of\nanother C and that every mathematical demonstration has a\nmiddle term B which explains the connection between A\nand C. Aristotle provides several examples of such triads of\nterms in mathematics, e.g., two right angles-angles about a\npoint-triangle, or right angle-half two right angles-angle in a\nsemicircle. It has long been noted by commentators that mathematical\nproofs work with a particular case through universal instantiation\n(ekthesis) and then universalize to the general claim, and\nthat not all propositions have the form: A is said of\nB, e.g., Elements 1 1, “To construct an\nequilateral triangle on a given line.” A more modern objection is\nthat the formal theory of the syllogism as presented in Prior Analytics\n1 1, 3-7 is woefully inadequate to express a theory involving\nconditionals and many-many relations, as is the case with all ancient\nmathematics. Nonetheless, Aristotle does think that most mathematical\nproofs actually do have this form. Those that wouldn't would certainly\nbe negative propositions and possibly existential propositions. (We\nsimply do not know enough about how Aristotle conceived of the logical\nform of existential propositions.) From a careful reading of the rest\nof the Prior Analytics, it becomes clear that Aristotle has a\nflexible notion of “one thing said of another” and that he\nregards standard mathematical proofs as really being in a universal\nform, which we express for purposes of comprehension as particular.  \n\nA science is defined by the genus or kind it studies and by a group of\nspecifiable properties which belong to that kind. Secondly, the\nproperties studied within a science are defined in terms of the genus\nof the science (per se2). Hence, it follows that it will\ncommonly be impossible to prove one thing using a different science.\nFor one would have to prove that a property within one genus applies to\na completely different genus. Hence, every science is\nautonomous. Aristotle makes this claim, however, in\nthe context of his rejection of Plato's view that sciences are\nsubordinate to knowledge of the Good. What he actually claims is much more\nmodest. If one genus comes under another genus, it will be possible, in\nsome cases incumbent, to prove that a property belongs to a genus by\nusing a theorem from another science. In such a case the one science is\nsaid to be under (subalternate with) the other\nscience.  \n\nHere are the sciences along with their relations which Aristotle\nmentions in the Analytics: \n\nAristotle treats the science at the lowest level, descriptions of\nthe rainbow, astronomical phenomena, and acoustical harmonics, as\ndescriptive, providing the fact that something is the case, but not the\nexplanation, which is provided by the higher science. It is very easy\nto speculate how Aristotle would fill in the relations in the table;\ne.g., would he put stereometry below geometry, as Plato does in\nRep. vii? Similarly, the explanatory relation between\nmathematical optics and geometry is not the same as the relation of\noptics to empirical optics. This example of the rainbow seems to refer\nto the argument in Meteorology iii.5, where the observed fact\nthat rainbows are never more than a semicircle (true in flat lands) is\nexplained by a proof in optics that is thoroughly geometrical in\ncharacter. Once the basic set-up and principle of reflection is\nprovided, the rest is geometrical. \n\nA different situation obtains when one science is not under another\nscience, but some of the properties come from the other science.\nAristotle's example is the fact that that round wounds heal more slowly\n[than slashes]. The medical property depends on the area of the wound\nand its perimeter. \n\nAristotle's point about autonomy is that a theorem in arithmetic\n(even less a theorem in harmonics) cannot be used to prove something in\ngeometry. Here, arithmetic is probably understood as the number theory\nfound in Euclid, Elements vii-ix, and not mere calculation of\nnumbers, which, of course, is used in geometry. This allows the\nanti-Platonic point that theorems about the beautiful and theorems in\nmathematics have nothing to do with one another, even if some theorems\nare beautiful. \n\nElsewhere (esp. Physics ii.2 and Metaphysics\nxiii.3), Aristotle provides different accounts of the relations between\nmathematical sciences. \n\nAristotle's principal concern in discussing ontological issues in\nmathematics is to avoid various versions of platonism. Aristotle\nshares with Plato the view that there are objects of understanding,\nthat these must be universal and not particular and that they have to\nsatisfy certain “Parmenidean” conditions, such as being\nunchanging and eternal. However, Aristotle rejects the view of Plato\nthat objects of understanding are separate from particulars. This is a\ngeneral problem in Aristotle's metaphysics. However, in the case of\nmathematical objects, there are three important difficulties. First,\nif physical objects are the objects of mathematical understanding and\nsatisfy the standard definitions of line, circle, etc., then it is\narguable that they manifestly fail in two ways (cf. Met. iii\n2 997b25-8a19):  \n\nAlthough these two problems are distinct, Aristotle may hold that\nthis failure is at least partly responsible for the failure of\nmathematical objects to have the mathematical properties we study.\nPlatonic Forms fail in a third way. \n\nA fourth problem is not explicitly stated by Aristotle, but is\nclearly a presupposition of his discussion. \n\nTo solve the problems of separation and precision, contemporary\nphilosophers such as Speusippus and possibly Plato posited a universe\nof mathematical entities which are perfect instances of mathematical\nproperties, adequately multiple for any theorem we wish to prove, and\nseparate from the physical or perceptible world. Aristotle calls them\nmathematicals or intermediates,\nbecause they are intermediate between the Forms and physical objects,\nin as much as they are perfect, eternal, and unchanging like the Forms,\nbut multiple like physical objects (cf., for example, Met. i.6\n987b14-18, iii 2, xiii.1-2). This solution is the ancestor of many\nversions of platonism in mathematics. \n\nAristotle's rejection of intermediates involves showing that their\nadvocates are committed to an unwieldy multiplicity of mathematical\nuniverses, at least one corresponding to each mathematical science,\nwhether kinematics, astronomy, or geometry. However, he also sets out\nto show that such ontologies are not merely pleonastic, but also that\nan alternative account can be given free of all the difficulties\nmentioned. In other words, Aristotle's strategy is best seen as\ndiffusing some versions of platonism. \n\nAristotle also rejects a compromise as merely compounding this\ndifficulty, the view that either Forms or intermediates are immanent in\nthings (separate but coextensive), since these different worlds will\nnow have to exist bundled together. \n\nThe account here of Aristotle on the status of mathematical objects\nwill center on five concepts, which Aristotle uses in his discussions:\n‘abstraction’ or ‘taking away’ or\n‘removal’ or ‘subtraction’\n(aphairesis), ‘precision’\n(akribeia), ‘as separated’\n(hôs kekhôrismenon),\n‘qua’ or ‘in the respect that’\n(hêi), and ‘intelligible\nmatter’ (noêtikê hylê).\nPrincipal sources are the Posterior Analytics, De\nAnima iii.6-8, Metaphysics iii.2, vi.1, vii.10-11, ix.9,\nx.1-2, xi.2-3, 7, xiii.1-3, Physics ii.2.  \n\nAristotle occasionally refers to mathematical objects as things by,\nin, from, or through removal (in different works Aristotle uses\ndifferent expressions: ta aphairesei, ta en\naphairesei, ta ex aphaireseôs, ta di’\naphaireseôs). It is also clear that this usage relates to\nlogical discussions in the Topics of definitions where one can\nspeak of adding a term or deleting a term from an expression and seeing\nwhat one gets as a result. Our principal task is to explain what this\nlogical/psychological removal is and how it solves the four puzzles.\nAristotle starts with the class of perceptible or physical\nmagnitudes. The examination of these is a part of physics (cf.\nPhysics iii.4). The ontological status of these does not\nconcern him, but we may suppose that they consitute the category of\nquantities: the bodies, surfaces, edges, corners, places, and times,\nsounds, etc. of physical substances (Categories 6). \n\nIn the Analytics, where the notion of matter is absent,\nAristotle begins with a particular geometrical perceptible figure. What\nis removed is its particularity and all that comes with this, including\nits being perceptible. What is left then is a universal of some sort.\nAristotle also does not seem to think in this work that there is any\nconflict between the plurality problem and thinking of all terms in a\nmathematical deduction as universals. However, since he allows that a\nterm can be a very complex expression, it can designate a rich complex\nfor which there would probably be no corresponding Form in a Platonic\ntheory. \n\nElsewhere, Aristotle usually seems to mean that the attributes not a\npart of the science are removed. What is left may be particular, a\nquasi-fictional entity. It is the status of this entity which leads to\nmuch controversy. Is it a representation in the soul or is it the\nperceptible object treated in a special way? Ancient and medieval\nreaders tended to take the former approach in their interpretation of\nAristotle, that the object left is a stripped down representation with\nonly the required properties. (Cf. Mueller (1990) and neo-Platonic\nfoundations for these interpretations of mathematics, such as Proclus\nin his commentary on Euclid.) \n\nMost modern readers, perhaps influenced by the critiques of Berkeley\nand Hume against the first position and certainly less committed to\nneo-Platonism, take the second approach. The objects studied by\nmathematical sciences are perceptible objects treated in a special\nway, as a perceived representation, whether as a diagram in the sand\nor an image in the imagination. Furthermore, perhaps as a response to\nFrege's devastating critique of psychologism and Husserl's first\nattempt at a psychological account of arithmetic, some have suggested\nthat Aristotle has no need for a special faculty of\nabstracting. Rather the mind is able to consider the perceived object\nwithout some of its properties, such as being perceived, being made of\nsand, marble, bronze, etc. However, this is analogous to the logical\nmanipulation of definitions, by considering terms with or without\ncertain additions. Hence, Aristotle will sometimes call the material\nobject, the mathematical object by adding on. As a convenience, the\nmind conceives of this as if the object were just that. On this view,\nabstraction is no more and no less psychological than inference. \n\nConceptually, we might think of the process as the mind rearranging\nthe ontological structure of the object. As a substantial artifact,\nwhat-it-is, the sand box has certain properties essentially. The figure\ndrawn may be incidental to what-it-is, i.e., an accident. In treating\nthe object as the figure drawn, being made of sand is incidental to it.\nHence, ‘things by removal’ may be one way of explaining\nperceptible magnitudes qua lengths. This is the concept which\ndoes most of the work for Aristotle. \n\nIn his discussions of precision, Aristotle states that those\nsciences which have more properties removed are more precise.\nArithemetic, about units, is more precise than geometry, since a point\nis a unit having position. A science of kinematics (geometry of moving\nmagnitudes) where all motion is uniform motions is more precise than a\nscience that includes non-uniform motions in addition, and a science of\nnon-moving magnitudes (geometry) is more precise than one with moving\nmagnitudes. However, one might infer that ‘precision’ here\nmeans nothing more than ‘clarity’ (or perhaps\n‘refinement’, with all its ambiguity). Does this concept of\n‘precision’ provide a framework for solving the problem of\nprecision? \n\nAristotle solves the separability problem with a kind of\nfictionalism. The language and practice of mathematicians is legitimate\nbecause we are able to conceive of perceptible magnitudes in ways that\nthey are not. The only basic realities for Aristotle remain substances,\nhowever we are to conceive them. A primary characteristic of substances\nis that they are separate. Yet we are able to speak of a triangle, a\nfinite surface, merely the limit of a body, and hence not separate, as\nif it were separate (hôs kekhôrismenon). It is a\nsubject in our science (in our discourse in the science). The mental\nand logical mechanism by which we accomplish this is the core of\nAristotle's strategy in diffusing platonisms. \n\nThe word Aristotle uses is commonly translated with the English word\n‘qua’ which itself translates the Latin relative\npronoun ‘qua’, but with one important grammatical\ndifference. The English adverb is normally followed by a noun\nphrase. \n\nAs a relative adverbial pronoun in the dative case, the Greek word\ncaptures all possible meanings of the dative, including,\n‘where’, ‘in the manner that’,\n‘by-means-of-the-fact-that’, or\n‘in-the-respect-that’. Some have suggested translating it\nwith the word ‘because’, although it is arguable that the\nEnglish word at best intersects with the appropriate Greek meaning\n(perhaps ‘just or precisely because’ works better. Hence,\n‘X qua Y’ should be understood\nas elliptic for: \n\nor  \n\nHere ‘X’ is normally a noun phrase referring to\nan entity in any ordinary way, e.g., arithmetic studies Leopold\nqua unit, this man qua unit, this musician\nqua unit. \n\nIn the context of a scientific claim, ‘X\nby-means-of-the-fact-that or in-the-respect-that X is\nY is F’ maintains that ‘Y is\nF’ is a theorem, where Y is the most universal\nor appropriate subject for F, and that X is\nF in virtue of the fact that X is Y. For\nexample, Figure ABC qua triangle has internal angles equal to\ntwo right angles, but qua right triangle has sides\nAB2 + BC2 = AB2. \n\nIn the case where we examine or study an object X\nqua Y or X in-the-respect-that X is\nY, we study the consequences that follow from something's\nbeing an Y. In other words, Y determines the logical\nspace of what we study. If X is a bronze triangle (a\nperceptible magnitude), to study X qua bronze will be\nto examine bronze and the properties that accrue to something that is\nbronze. To study X qua triangle is to study the\nproperties that accrue to a triangle. Unless it follows from\nsomething's being a triangle that it must be bronze, the property of\nbeing bronze will not appear in one's examination. \n\nNote that there is no necessity that ‘qua’\noperators be of the form ‘qua Y’, where\nY is a noun phrase. For example, Aristotle says (De\nanima iii.4.429b25-6) that two things affect and are affected\n“qua something in common belongs to both.”\nSimilarly, as evidence that ‘qua’ does not in\nthese contexts always mean ‘because’ (usually, the context\nis too ambiguous to precisely decide whether it means\n‘because’ or ‘in the respect that’), consider\nNicomachean Ethics i.3.1102b8-9, “Sleep is an inactivity\nof the soul qua it is called good or bad,” but certainly\nnot because it is. \n\nWith only one or two possible exceptions, it seems that whenever\nAristotle speaks of F(X) qua\nG(X), G(X) must be true. We can\nstudy a perceptible triangle qua triangle because it is a\ntriangle. For convenience, we can call this principle\nqua-realism. \n\nThe Account of Mathematical Objects with\n‘Qua’. We begin with perceptible\nmagnitudes. These are volumes, surfaces, edges, and corners. They\nchange in position and size. They are made of some material and are the\nquantities of substances and their interactions. The volumes, surfaces,\nand edges have shape. Times and corners do not. Different sciences\ntreat different perceptible magnitudes qua different\nthings. \n\nMoreover, since there are many perceptible magnitudes, there will be\nenough, qua line, to prove any theorem that involves lines.\nThe plurality problem is trivially solved. \n\nThe separability problem is solved because if we examine X\nqua Y, we will talk about Y as if it is a\nseparate entity, as a subject, and will pay no attention to the way in\nwhich we captured Y through a description\n‘X’, in the sense that only the residue of the\nqua-filter are studied. The science will speak of Y.\nThis too will not interfere with mathematical practice and so will not\nviolate non-revisionism. \n\nIn Metaphysics vi.1, Aristotle argues that physics concerns\nthings which have change, but are substances, that at least some of the\nthings that mathematics is about do not change and are eternal but are\nnot substances (exceptions would probably include stars and spheres in\nmathematical astronomy and bodies in mathematical kinematics), while\nfirst philosophy or theology is about things which are substances but\ndo not change and are eternal. We can now characterize the way in which\nmathematical objects are eternal and lack change. Namely, generation\nand change are not among the predicates studied by geometry or\narithmetic. Hence, it is correct to say that qua lines,\nperceptible lines lack generation, destruction, and change (with\nappropriate provisos for kinematics and mathematical astronomy). \n\nWhether the precision problem is also solved and how it is solved is\nmore controversial. On the ancient and medieval interpretation, the\nproblem of precision is solved by allowing mental representations to be\nas precise as one chooses. The contemporary interpretation of\nconsidering Aristotle's mathematical objects as physical object treated\nin a special way has a more difficult task. There are five ways in\nwhich Aristotle may attempt to solve the precision problem. \n\nOur difficulty is that while Aristotle raises the problem of\nprecision, he does not explicitly explain his solution to it. \n\nPerceptible magnitudes have perceptible matter. A bronze sphere is a\nperceptible magnitude. For solving the plurality problem, Aristotle\nneeds to have many triangles with the same form. Since perceptible\nmatter is not part of the object considered (in abstraction or\nremoval), he needs to have a notion of matter which is the matter of\nthe object: bronze sphere MINUS bronze (perceptible matter). Since this\nobject must be a composite individual to distinguish it from other\nindividuals with the same form, it will have matter. He calls such\nmatter intelligible or mathematical matter. Aristotle has at least four\ndifferent conceptions of intelligible matter in the middle books of the\nMetaphysics, Physics iv, and De anima i:  \n\n(1) and (3) are compatible; (2) may be a separate notion having more\nto do with the unity of definition and seems incompatible with (4);\nAristotle treats (3) and (4) as the same notion. Since Aristotle's\nconcern in discussing (4) is with the nature of the parts of\ndefinitions and not with questions of extended matter, it is unclear\nwhether the non-definitional parts are potential extended parts or\nmerely forms of extended parts, although the former seems more\nplausible. \n\nAncillary to his discussions of being qua being and theology\n(Metaphysics vi.1, xi.7), Aristotle suggests an analogy with\nmathematics. If the analogy is that there is a super-science of\nmathematics coverying all continuous magnitudes and discrete\nquantities, such as numbers, then we should expect that Greek\nmathematicians conceived of a general mathematical subject as a\nprecursor of algebra, Descartes' mathesis universalis (universal\nlearning/mathematics), and mathematical logic.  \n\nAristotle reports (Posterior Analytics. i.5, cf.\nMetaphysics xiii.2) that whereas mathematicians proved\ntheorems such as a : b = c : d\n=> a : c = b : d (alternando)\nseparately for number, lines, planes, and solids, now there is one\nsingle general or universal proof for all (see Section 3). The\ndiscovery of universal proofs is usually associated with Eudoxus'\ntheory of proportion. For Aristotle this creates a problem since a\nscience concerns a genus or kind, but also there seems to be no kind\ncomprising number and magnitude. Some scholars have proposed that a\nuniversal science of ‘posology’ (a science of quantity)\ntakes the whole category of quantity as its subject. \n\nAristotle seems more reticent, describing the proofs as concerning\nlines, etc., qua having such and such increment (An. Post.\nii.17). He seems to identify such a super-mathematics\n(Metaphysics vi.1, xi.7), but seems to imply that it does not\ntake a determinate kind as its subject. Another possibility is that the\ncommon science has theorems which apply by analogy to the different\nmathematical kinds. \n\nElsewhere (Metaphysics xi.4), where Aristotle builds an\nanalogy with the science of being qua being, he seems to suggest that\nuniversal proofs of quantities (here too including numbers) concern\ncontinuous quantity (unlike the similar passage in Metaphysics\niv.3). If so and if this is by Aristotle, it would correspond to the\ngeneral theory of proportions as it comes down to us. One may well\nwonder if scholars have been led astray by a hyperbole about universal\nproofs. \n\nIronically, extant Greek mathematics shows no traces of an\nAristotelian universal mathematics. The theory of ratio for magnitudes\nin Euclid, Elements v is completely separate from the\ntreatment of ratio for number in Elements vii and parts of\nviii, none of which appeals to v, even though almost all of the proofs\nof v could apply straightforwardly to numbers. For example, Euclid\nprovides separate definitions of proportion (v def. 5, and vii def.\n20). Compare the rule above (alternando),which is proved at v.16, while\nthe rule follows trivially for numbers from the commutivity of\nmultiplication and vii.19: ad = bc ⇔ a\n: b = c : d. \n\nIn Plato's Academy, some philosophers suggested that lines are composed\nof indivisible magnitude, whether a finite number (a line of\nindivisible lines) or a infinite number (a line of infinite points).\nAristotle builds a theory of continuity and infinite divisibility of\ngeometrical objects. Aristotle denies both conceptions. Yet, he needs\nto give an account of continuous magnitudes that is also free from\nparadoxes that these theories attempted to avoid. The elements of his\naccount may be found principally in Physics iv.1-5 and v.1 and\nvi. Aristotle's account pertains to perceptible magnitudes. However, it\nis clear that he understands this to apply to magnitudes in mathematics\nas well.  \n\nAristotle has many objections to thinking of a line as composed of\nactual points (likewise, a plane of lines, etc.), including: \n\nTo say that a line is comprised of an infinity of potential points\nis no more than to say that a line may be divided (with a line-cutter,\nwith the mind, etc.) anywhere on it, that any potential point may be\nbrought to actuality. The continuity of a line consists in the fact\nthat any actualized point within the line will hold together the line\nsegments on each side. Otherwise, it makes no sense to speak of a\npotential point actually holding two potential lines together. \n\nSuppose I have a line AB and cut it at C. The\nlines AC and CB are distinct. Is C one point\nor two? \n\nThis merely means that we can treat it once or twice or as many times\nas we choose. Note that Aristotle says the same thing about a\ncontinuous proportion. in a : b = b :\nc, b is one magnitude in being, but is used as two.  \n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document: \n\nGreek mathematicians tend to conceive of number (arithmos) as\na plurality of units. Perhaps a better translation, without our deeply\nentrenched notions, would be ‘count’. Their conception\ninvolves:  \n\nFor Aristotle and his contemporaries there are several fundamental\nproblems in understanding number and arithmetic: \n\nAristotle does not seem bothered by: \n\nAristotle presents three Academic solutions to these problems. Units\nare comparable if they can be counted together (such as the ten cows in\nthe field). Units are not comparable, if it is conceptually impossible\nto count them together (a less intuitive notion).  \n\nAristotle reports that some Academics opted for a version of\nIncomparable or Comparable/Incomparable Units to solve the unity\nproblem and introduced comparable units as the objects of mathematical\ntheorems, e.g., given some comparable units, they are even if they can\nbe divided in half, into two concatenations corresponding to\n(participating in) the same Form-number. \n\nGreeks used an Egyptian system of fractions. With the exception of 2/3,\nall fractions are proper parts which modern readers will see as unit\nfractions: 1/n. For example, 2/5 is 1/3 1/15 (that is, the sum of 1/3\nand 1/15). Additionally, Greeks used systems of measure, as we do, with\nunits of measure being divided up into more refined units of measure. 1\nfoot is 16 finger-widths (inches). Hence, one can always eliminate\nfractions by going, as we do, to a more refined measure (1, 1/2, 1/4\nfeet or 1 foot 12 inches). This feature of measure may be reflected in\nPlato's observation (Rep. vii) that in arithmetic, one can\nalways eliminate parts of units.  \n\nSince Aristotle (esp. Metaphysics x.1-2) treats measurement under his\ndiscussions of units (and hence number), it turns out that the\nprecision problem becomes a problem of sorting out precise units of\nmeasure. Hence, in the case discrete quantities, such as cows, the unit\nis very precise, one cow. In the case of continuous quantities, the\nmost precise unit of time is the time it takes for the fixed stars (the\nfastest things in the universe) to move the smallest perceptible\ndistance. But a point or indivisible with position removed or a cow qua\nunit, i.e., a mathematical unit, is precise.  \n\nAristotle's treatment of time (Physics iv.10-14) includes some\nobservations about numbers which come closest to being an account of\nnumber. Aristotle defines time as the number or count of change and\nthen proceeds to distinguish two senses of number, what is counted\n(e.g., ten cows as measured by the cow-unit, or ten feet as measured by\nthe foot-unit) and that by which we count. Time is number in the first\nsense, not as so-many changes, but as so-much change as measured by a\nunit of change. Aristotle clarifies the distinction between what is\ncounted (or is countable) and that by which we count. These five black\ncats (number as what is counted) are different from these five brown\ncats, but their number (that by which we count) is the same.  \n\nBut what are the numbers by which we count? Aristotle says nothing, but\nwe may speculate that the five by which we count is the single formal\nexplanation of what makes the five black cats five and what makes the\nfive brown cats five. Hence, Aristotle probably subscribes to an\nAristotelian version of the distinction between intermediate and\nForm-numbers.  \n\nAristotle's discussion of time also gives us some insight into the\nunity problem. What gives the five black cats unity is just that they\ncan be treated as a unity. From this it follows for Aristotle that\nthere can be no number without mind. Nothing is countable unless there\nexists a counter. \n\nIt is often supposed, for Aristotle, mathematical explanation plays no\nrole in the study of nature, especially in biology. This conception is,\nmost of all, a product of anti-scholastics of the late Renaissance, who\nsought to draw the greatest chasm between their own mechanism and\nscholasticism. Mathematics plays a vital role in both. The principal\nway in which mathematics enters into biological explanation is through\nhypothetical necessity:  \n\nZ may be a constraint determined by a mathematical fact.\nFor example, animals by nature do not have an odd number of feet. For\nif one had an odd number of feet, it would walk awkardly or the feet\nwould have to be of different lengths (De incessuanimalium 9).\nTo see this, imagine an isosceles triangle with a altitude drawn. \n\nAristotle famously rejects the infinite in mathematics and in\nphysics, with some notable exceptions. He defines it thus: \n\nImplicit in this notion is an unending series of magnitudes, which will\nbe achieved either by dividing a magnitude (the infinite by division)\nor by adding a magnitude to it (the infinite by addition). This is why\nhe conceives of the infinite as pertaining to material explanation, as\nit is indeterminate and involves potential cutting or joining (cf.\nSection 7.5).  \n\nAristotle argues that in the case of magnitudes, an infinitely large\nmagnitude and an infinitely small magnitude cannot exist. In fact, he\nthinks that universe is finite in size. He also agrees with Anaxagoras,\nthat given any magnitude, it is possible to take a smaller. Hence, he\nallows that there are infinite magnitudes in a different sense. Since\nit is always possible to divide a magnitude, the series of division is\nunending and so is infinite. This is a potential, but never actual\ninfinite. For each division potentially exists. Similarly, since it is\nalways possible to add to a finite magnitude that is smaller than the\nwhole universe continually smaller magnitudes, there is a potential\ninfinite in addition. That series too need never end. For example, if I\nadd to some magnitude a foot board, and then less than a half a foot,\nand then less than a fourth, and so forth, the total amount added will never\nexceed two feet. Aristotle claims that the mathematician never needs\nany other notion of the infinite. \n\nHowever, since Aristotle believes that the universe has no beginning\nand is eternal, it follows that in the past there have been an infinite\nnumber of days. Hence, his rejection of the actual infinite in the case\nof magnitude does not seem to extend to the concept of time. \n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document: \n\nAs philosophers usually do, Aristotle cites simple or familiar examples\nfrom contemporary mathematics, although we should keep in mind that\neven basic geometry such as we find in Euclid's Elements would\nhave been advanced studies. The average education in mathematics would\nhave been basic arithmetical operations (possibly called\nlogistikê) and metrological geometry (given certain\ndimensions of a figure, to find other dimensions), such as were also\ntaught in Egypt. Aristotle does allude to this sort of mathematics on\noccasion, but most of his examples come from the sort of mathematics\nwhich we have come to associate with Greece, the constructing of\nfigures from given figures and rules, and the proving that figures have\ncertain properties, and the ‘discovery’ of numbers with\ncertain properties or proving that certain classes of numbers have\ncertain properties. If we attend carefully to his examples, we can even\nsee an emerging picture of elementary geometry as taught in the\nAcademy. In the supplement are provided twenty-five of his favorite\npropositions (the list is not exhaustive).  \n\nAristotle also makes some mathematical claims that are genuinely\nproblematic. Was he ignorant of contemporary work? Why does he ignore\nsome of the great problems of his time? Is there any reason why\nAristotle should be expected, for example to refer to conic sections?\nNonetheless, Aristotle does engage in some original and difficult\nmathematics. Certainly, in this Aristotle was more an active\nmathematician than his mentor, Plato. \n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document: \n\nThe standard English translation is given first, and, where\nappropirate, other more idiomatic translations.
