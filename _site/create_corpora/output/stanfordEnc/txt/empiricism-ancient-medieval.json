This article will begin by outlining three different\nforms of empiricism. It will examine the Presocratic and Hippocratic\norigins of the empiricist attitude, and discuss its development in the\nwork of Aristotle, the Hellenistic medical writers, sceptics, and\nEpicureans. It will then examine the combination of Aristotelian and\nAugustinian views in the work of thirteenth and fourteenth-century\nthinkers, the connection between the study of magic and empiricism, the\neclipse of the doctrine of divine illumination, and the gradual\ndownplaying of the role of the intellect in the acquisition of\nknowledge.\n\n\nWhy study these ancient thinkers? To those who hold that “no\nconception can be properly understood except through its\nhistory” (Comte 1934: 2), the answer will seem obvious. But even\nthose who prefer to engage in philosophical reflection, rather than\nstudying its history, may find these thinkers illuminating.\nEmpiricists have always had difficulty giving an account of key\naspects of both everyday and scientific knowledge. They have found it\nhard to explain how we could know about logical and mathematical\ntruths, causal relations, and (more generally) the modal structure of\nthe world (how things could be). Insofar as we are still faced with\nthese questions, we may be able to learn from the answers our\npredecessors gave.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three questions raised by the title of this entry. The first\nis whether it is anachronistic. Is empiricism not a modern position?\nCan we attribute it to ancient and medieval thinkers? The charge of\nanachronism would, perhaps, be warranted if empiricism referred to a\nsingle set of beliefs. As we shall see, however, the term covers a\nvariety of views regarding knowledge\n (sect. 2).\n Even among modern thinkers, the empiricism of John Locke\n(1632–1704) is not identical with that of Francis Bacon\n(1561–1626), and neither bears much resemblance to the\nempiricism of Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970), A. J. Ayer\n(1910–1989), or Hans Reichenbach (1891–1953). Yet all\nthese thinkers have an attitude in common: they share a desire to keep\nfactual claims (in the sense of claims regarding contingent matters)\nclosely related to the deliverances of the senses. That desire has\nancient roots. Modern empiricism was not a creatio e nihilo.\nIt represented a revival of attitudes found already in the ancient\nworld and the form in which it was expressed was dependent on late\nmedieval developments. \nA second question has to do with the article’s association of\nancient and medieval views. The philosophers discussed here are\nseparated by a thousand years. Why bring them together? This question\nis more easily answered. The intellectual renaissance of the twelfth\nand thirteenth centuries involved a revival of the work of the\nancients. In the field of philosophy this took the form of a\nrediscovery of the works of Aristotle (384–322 BCE), by way of\nLatin translations from Arabic sources and Greek texts from the\nByzantine world. Indeed much of the philosophical writing of this\nperiod was done by way of commentaries on Aristotle. Medieval\nphilosophers were also influenced by writers from a later age, such as\nPlotinus (205–270 CE), Dionysius the Areopagite (5th–6th\ncentury CE), and St Augustine (354–430 CE). But these writers\nwere themselves influenced by Aristotle’s predecessor, Plato\n(427–347 BCE). So in this respect, too, medieval philosophy has\nancient roots. \nA third question has to do with the scope of the discussion. As will\nalready be clear, the tradition of philosophy being discussed here is\nthat which began in the Greek city states of the sixth and fifth\ncenturies BCE. But empiricist views are found within other traditions.\nThe closest parallels are to be found among the Lokāyata\n(Cārvāka), one of the nāstika (non-orthodox)\nschools of Indian philosophy that existed in the sixth and seventh\ncenturies CE. These are reported to have held that sensory perception\nis the only reliable means of knowledge and to have rejected the\nvalidity of inferences to unobservable entities (Chatterjee &\nDatta 2004: 54–59).\nThe Buddha (ca. 485–405 BCE) could be said to be an empiricist,\ninsofar as he based his dharma (teaching) on experience\nrather than authority or reason. But the Buddhist idea of experience\nis broader than that held by most empiricists (Jayatilleke 1963:\n463–64 [para. 793]). The twelve āyatanas (sensory\ndomains) of Buddhist tradition include the mind as well as the bodily\nsenses and meditation is thought capable of producing higher forms of\nknowledge (the abhijñās) that are independent of\nsensory perception. Finally, we can find discussions of sense\nperception within classical Chinese philosophy. Mozi (Mo Tzu, ca.\n480–392 BCE), for instance, ranked everyday experience among the\nthree criteria of reliable knowledge (Mozi 35.3), while the\nmore sceptical Xunzi (Hsün Tzu, ca. 312–210 BCE) pointed\nout how easily the senses are deceived (Xunzi 21.8). But\nwhile it would be interesting to explore these traditions, empiricism\ndoes not play as central a role in any of them as it does in the\nhistory of Western philosophy.  \nThe question of scope also arises when it comes to the subject matter\nof the article, which is empiricism as a doctrine rather than as a\npractice. From the very beginning of what the Greeks called “the\ninvestigation of nature” (hē peri phuseōs\nhistoria), there have been those who studied the natural world by\nmeans of careful observation. There were medical writers who observed\nand recorded symptoms, astronomers who observed the movements of the\nheavens, and students of music who placed their ears “close [to\ntheir instruments] as though trying to hear what their neighbours were\nsaying” (Plato Rep. 531a6–7). These people were\nsurely empiricists in practice. But such figures will be of interest\nto us only if they also reflected on what they were doing, developing\nsecond-order beliefs about knowledge. It is these second-order beliefs\nthat will be the focus of the present study. \n“Names of philosophical positions,” wrote W. V. O. Quine,\n“are a necessary evil” (1995: 251). This is certainly the\ncase with the term “empiricism”: while it is difficult\nsimply to abandon it, it can be misleading. Among historians of\nearly modern philosophy, for instance, the traditional distinction\nbetween empiricists and rationalists has fallen out of favour, on the\ngrounds that there are few thinkers who can be clearly assigned to\neither category (Norton 1981; Loeb 1981: 25–75). The problem\nhere, however, is not the category of empiricism, but its use as a\n“pigeon-hole” into which one tries to place individual\nthinkers. Empiricism need not be a global doctrine: a thinker may be\nan empiricist in one domain but not in another. It is possible, for\ninstance, to be an empiricist about knowledge of the natural world,\nbut a rationalist with regard to a particular area of mathematics\n(Markie 2015: sect. 1.2). So it is not surprising that individual\nthinkers are hard to categorize. But empiricism is also an umbrella\nterm: it covers a variety of views regarding knowledge. Even with\nregard to the one domain, a thinker may be an empiricist in one sense,\nbut not in another. So if we are to use the category, we need to\ndistinguish the different forms empiricism can take.  \nThe first is what we may call explanatory empiricism, which\ndenies the validity of inferences from observable phenomena to causes\nthat cannot themselves be observed. Perhaps the best known modern\nexample is that of the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach\n(1838–1916). At least for most of his life, Mach rejected the\ntheory of atoms as an example of “hypothetico-fictive\nphysics” (Mach 1992: 136) and would respond to believers in\natoms with the words, Habn S’eins gsehn? (Have you seen\none?) (Meyer 1992: 151). (For a slightly different view of\nMach’s atomism, see Banks 2003: 12–14.) A more recent\nexample is the “constructive empiricism” of Bas van\nFraassen, which holds that the aim of science is to produce theories\nthat are empirically adequate, a theory being empirically adequate if\n“what it says about the observable things and events in this\nworld, is true” (van Fraassen 1980: 12). This view also rules\nout inferences to unobservable entities (van Fraassen 1980: 72). While\nthis may sound like a modern position, it was held by the first people\nto call themselves “empiricists,” namely a group of\nancient medical writers, who rejected inferences based on reasoning\nrather than the observed association of phenomena (sect. 3.3).\n  \nA second form of empiricism is summed up by the Latin slogan nihil\nest in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu (nothing is in\nthe intellect which was not first in the senses). We can think of this\nas a genetic empiricism (Lowe 1995: 189), which makes claims\nabout the origins of our ideas. It takes two forms. The first of these\nis what we may call tabula rasa (blank slate) empiricism,\nwhich denies the existence of innate ideas or principles of reasoning,\nholding that both our factual knowledge and the concepts we employ in\ndescribing the world are drawn from experience. The locus\nclassicus for an empiricism of this kind is the work of John\nLocke, who famously suggested that the mind is originally “white\npaper, void of all characters, without any ideas” (Locke\nEssay 2.1.2). But it also takes the form of what we\nmay describe as a cognitive empiricism. This denies that we\nhave intellectual powers or capacities giving access to factual\nknowledge independently of experience. \nCognitive empiricism may seem implicit in the tabula rasa\nprinciple that “nothing is in the intellect which was not first\nin the senses.” But the two positions are not identical, for one\ncan deny that we have innate ideas or principles while also holding\nthat the mind shapes what the senses provide. As G. W. Leibniz\n(1646–1716) would later remark, “nothing is in the\nintellect which was not first in the senses, except for: the intellect\nitself [nisi intellectus ipse]” (Leibniz NE\n1.2). There are two contributions the intellect could make.\nIt could predispose us to understand what we perceive in certain ways.\n(The “affordances” spoken of by James Gibson [1986:\n127–43] can be thought of as dispositions of this kind.) Or it\nmay have the capacity to receive a belief-forming influence from an\nexternal source, one not mediated by the senses. (For a medieval\nversion of this idea, see\n sect. 4.2.)\n A thorough-going cognitive empiricism would deny the existence of\neither innate dispositions or non-sensory influences in the formation\nof beliefs. It would hold that the mind forms its beliefs by\n“selecting, combining, or otherwise manipulating simple ideas of\nsensation” (Kahn 1981: 407). \nA final form of empiricism is what we may call justificatory\nempiricism. In its strongest form, an empiricism of this kind is\nindifferent as to the origins of our ideas and can tolerate inferences\nto unobservable entities. It merely insists that wherever our ideas\ncome from and whatever they claim, they cannot be regarded as\njustified until they have been successfully tested against experience.\nWithin twentieth-century philosophy, this position is associated with\na sharp distinction between the “context of discovery” and\nthe “context of justification” (Reichenbach 1938:\n6–7), with justificatory empiricists focusing on the latter. For\nKarl Popper (1902–1994), for instance, the question of how a\ntheory is discovered is irrelevant to its epistemic status; what\nmatters is whether that theory has explanatory power and has withstood\nsevere testing (Popper 1935 [2002: 7–8]). On the face of it, this does\nseem a recent position. Perhaps no philosopher before Popper would\nhave regarded the origins of an idea as entirely irrelevant to its\nstanding. But there are hints of it in the work of some ancient and\nmedieval thinkers, who held that factual claims arrived at by\ndeductive reasoning lack credibility if they have not also been tested\nagainst experience. \nThe discussion that follows shall employ these categories in order to\nanalyse the thought of ancient and medieval philosophers. Once again,\nthis may be thought to run the risk of anachronism, insofar as such\ncategories are not themselves ancient. Although one school of ancient\nthinkers did identify themselves as empiricists, no ancient or\nmedieval philosophers made these particular distinctions. But this is\nnot a fatal objection. We should not distort the thinking of ancient\nor medieval philosophers by forcing it into modern categories, as into\na Procrustean bed. Nor should we write intellectual history in a\n“Whiggish” fashion, interested only in those features of\nancient thought that anticipate our own. But as Allen Wood once\nremarked (a little too paradoxically), “people can mean things\nthey can’t think, and therefore … must be able to express\nthoughts they can’t have” (A. Wood 2002: 227). When it\ncomes to ancient and medieval philosophers, our modern categories can\nhelp highlight aspects of their thought they themselves may have been\nunaware of. \nIf we think of empiricism as an attitude, rather than a clearly\nformulated doctrine, then it dates from the very beginnings of Western\nphilosophy, in the work of the Presocratics. Some care is needed\nhere, since we know of the Presocratics only through quotations and\nreports, found in authors who in some cases lived centuries later and\nwho themselves had philosophical axes to grind. One of our major\nsources, for instance, is Aristotle. But Aristotle was not trying to\ncompile an historical account; he was attempting to construct his own\nsystem and he sometimes reshaped his predecessors’ views with this\ngoal in mind (Cherniss 1935: 347). Judging from the quotations and\nreports we do have, it would be difficult to describe the Presocratics\nas empiricists in practice. On the contrary, their claims about the\nnatural world are notoriously sweeping and vague: it is far from clear\nhow they could be tested against experience (Barnes 1982: 48). Some of\nthe Presocratics, however, expressed sentiments that anticipate the\ndoctrinal empiricisms of later times. \nOf particular note are some sayings attributed to the Ionian\nphilosopher Heraclitus (fl. ca. 500 BCE). One fragment reads, “The things of which there is sight, hearing, experience, [these] I\nprefer” (DK 22B55; Graham 2010: 149). Although\nthe contrast here may be between knowledge by experience and knowledge\nby hearsay (Kahn 1979: 106), it does suggest a confidence in knowledge\nof the former kind. It is, however, balanced by another saying, which\nnotes that “poor witnesses for men are the eyes and ears of\nthose who have barbarian souls” (DK 22B107;\nGraham 2010: 149). Whereas the senses can provide knowledge, what they\noffer needs to be correctly understood. Empedocles (ca. 495–435\nBCE), too, while emphasizing the limits of human understanding,\nencourages his hearers to “understand each thing in the way in\nwhich it is clear [noei d’hēi dēlon\nhekaston],” gleaning what knowledge they can from the\nsenses (DK 31B3; Graham 2010: 343). \nEmpedocles’s saying can be understood as a response to the work\nof the Eleatic philosophers, such as Parmenides (ca. 515–445\nBCE) and Melissus of Samos (fl. ca. 440 BCE). Parmenides\nrelied on a priori arguments to reach conclusions that flew\nin the face of experience, while his follower Melissus argued for the\nunreliability of sense perception on the grounds that its deliverances\nwere contradicted by reason (Barnes 1982: 298–302). Such\nteachings offered a challenge to the early scientific tradition\nestablished by Thales of Miletus (fl. ca. 585 BCE), for they\nsuggested that “the phenomena which science attempts to\nunderstand … are figments of our deceptive senses”\n(Barnes 1982: 305). If there was to be a scientific tradition, it\nrequired a defence of sense perception over against pure reason. \nEmpiricist sentiments are also found in the work of some early medical\nwriters. These go beyond a simple defence of sense perception to\nexpress a suspicion of theories that go beyond what can be observed.\nWe find, perhaps, a hint of this attitude in the work of Alcmaeon of\nCroton (fl. ca. 500 BCE), to whom the following fragment is\nattributed: “Concerning things unseen the gods see clearly, but\nso far as men may conjecture… ” (DK\n24B1; Kirk, Raven, & Schofield 1983: 339). It would be wrong to\nread a body of empiricist doctrine into so cryptic a remark. But it\nmay indicate the beginning of a contrast, not only between what the\ngods know and men may know (a commonplace of ancient Greek thought),\nbut between knowledge that can be obtained by observation and\nknowledge of “the unseen.” The limits of human knowledge,\nit suggests, are marked by the limits of what can be observed. \nThis contrast is certainly found in some of the works attributed to\nHippocrates (ca. 460–370 BCE). The author of one Hippocratic\ntreatise argues against those who practice medicine on the basis of\nsome general principle or postulate (hupothesis). Medicine,\nhe suggests, does not require a general theory “about human\nnature [ho ti estin anthrōpos],” of the kind\noffered by Empedocles and other philosophers (AM 20.1). Such general principles may be required when dealing with with\nmatters that are “obscure and dubious,” such as “the\nthings in the sky or under the earth” (AM 1.3).\nBut medicine differs from such speculative sciences, since its\nconclusions can be confirmed by experience. Of particular note here is\nthe phrase “the things in the sky or under the earth,”\nwhich picks out the main areas of early Ionian science (Barnes 1982:\n139; cf. Plato Ap. 18b8–9). \nAt first sight, this looks like an early expression of explanatory\nempiricism: a refusal to make inferences to things that cannot be\nobserved. But even leaving aside the fact that “the things in\nthe sky” are not strictly unobservable, the same work also also\nspeaks of discovering facts about what is inside the body “from\nevident things outside [the body]” (AM 22.3).\nIn particular, it argues, we can draw conclusions about the\nbody’s internal organs by noting the behaviour of different\nkinds of observable objects: those that are solid, stretched, spongy,\nporous, and so on. (The reasoning here is by way of analogy, a common\npractice among the earliest Greek thinkers [Lloyd 1992: 254–55;\nAllen 2001: 10–11].) This seems inconsistent with explanatory\nempiricism, since it justifies inferences from what can be observed to\nwhat is (at least in practice) unobservable. \nTalk of discovering what is unseen from what is evident calls to mind\nthe maxim attributed to Anaxagoras (ca. 500–428 BCE):\n“Appearances are a vision of the invisible”\n(DK 59B21a; Graham 2010: 309). Not only was this\nprinciple employed in the Hippocratic writings, but it was said to\nhave been endorsed by Democritus (ca. 460–371 BCE) (Sextus\nM VII 1.140). For all his scepticism regarding sense\nperception (DK 68B6–10; Graham 2010:\n592–95), Democritus seemed to think it had an evidential role\n(Asmis 1984: 345). In particular, he apparently believed it could\nconfirm the atomist theory which Leucippus (fl. ca.\n450–420 BCE) had originated and he himself had embraced. There\nis, however, a difficulty here, as Democritus himself may have\nrealized, for in one report he has the senses utter the following:\n“Wretched mind, after taking from us your evidence, do you\noverthrow us? Our fall will be your defeat!”\n(DK 68B125; Graham 2010: 597). The problem here is\nthat while one can cite observable facts (such as the fact of motion)\nin support of atomism, that doctrine in turn suggests that appearances\nare deceptive (Barnes 1982: 559–64). As another fragment reads,\n“by convention color, by convention sweet, by convention bitter,\nbut in reality atoms and void” (DK 68B9, 125;\nGraham 2010: 597). At first sight, anyway, the atomist doctrine seems\nself-defeating. \nWhat we find, then, in the work of some of the earliest Greek\nphilosophers is not only the first outline of empiricist doctrines; we\nalso find hints of the difficulties such doctrines would encounter.\nBut to find a clearer statement of empiricist ideas, we must turn to\nthe work of Aristotle. \nWas Aristotle an empiricist? The question is not an easy one to\nanswer. Aristotle discussed a variety of ways in which human beings\ncan achieve a grasp of reality. In one place, for instance, he\noutlines five ways in which “the soul possesses the truth by way\nof affirmation or denial” (EN 1139b15–17). These\nare art or craft (technē), scientific knowledge\n(epistēmē), practical wisdom\n(phronēsis), philosophical wisdom (sophia), and\nintellect (nous). But he did not construct a systematic\nepistemology and it is not clear we could construct a consistent one\nfrom his surviving works. \nAristotle did, however, believe the senses to be reliable, and that we\nmust rely on their deliverances for our knowledge of the world. He\nwas, as one recent author puts it, “the great defender of the\nmanifest image in the classical world” (Kalderon 2015: 203; cf.\nSellars 1991: 4–5). Although Aristotle had insisted that\n“not everything that appears is true” (Met.\n1010b2–3), he also distinguished between appearances (ta\nphainomena) and sensations (aisthēseis). Each of\nthe senses has its own proper objects (such as color, in the case of\nsight) and our grasp of these is “is [always] true or [at least]\nadmits the lowest degree of falsehood” (DA\n428b18–19; cf. 428a11). It is when we make judgements about\nthese that we can fall into error (DA 430a27–28;\nKalderon 2015: 68–70). Aristotle also insists that “no one\ncan learn anything at all in the absence of sense” and that even\nwhen we are not actively perceiving, our thinking remains dependent on\nsensory images (DA 432a7–9). Insofar as it insists on\nboth the reliability of the senses and their essential role in the\ngaining of knowledge, Aristotle’s view is broadly\nempiricist. \nTo gain a better understand of the nature and limits of\nAristotle’s empiricism, we must once again make some\ndistinctions. Aristotle can be classed as a tabula rasa\nempiricist, for he rejects the claim that we have innate ideas or\nprinciples of reasoning. He is also, arguably, an explanatory\nempiricist, although in a different sense from that found among later\nmedical writers and sceptics. We can regard him as a modest kind of\njustificatory empiricist, who believes that scientific\ntheorizing is answerable to what can be observed. But it is less clear\nthat he can be said to be a cognitive empiricist, given the\nrole of intellectual insight in his account of scientific\nexplanation. \nWith regard to tabula rasa empiricism, Aristotle rejects the\ndoctrine of innate ideas found in the work of Plato (427–347\nBCE). He strongly denies, for instance, that we have innate knowledge\nof the principles of scientific demonstration (APo.\n100a; Met. 993a). This aspect of Aristotle’s empiricism\ncan be illustrated by his attitude to mathematics. For Plato,\nmathematical objects resemble the Forms—some may in fact be\nForms (Shapiro 2000: 54–55)—which occupy a timeless realm\ndistinct from that of the objects of sense perception (Rep.\n510c1–511b2). They are known, therefore, either by recollection\n(anamnēsis) or by a kind of direct intellectual\nintuition. Along with his rejection of innate ideas, Aristotle also\nrejects this conception of mathematical objects. What the\nmathematician grasps are real features of perceptible objects, but\nregarded in a particular way (Lear 1982: 168, 184). They are regarded\nmerely “as” (hēi) having quantity and being\ncontinuous or as objects of enumeration (Phys.\n193b22–194a10; Met. 1061a28–1061b3,\n1077b19–1078a4, 1078a22–28). \nIs Aristotle an explanatory empiricist? Aristotle does accept the need\nfor inferences from what can be observed to facts that are not\nimmediately evident (Asmis 1984: 212–17). As he writes,\n“to gain light on things imperceptible we must use the evidence\nof perceptible things” (EN 1104a13–14). It\nfollows that something perceived can serve as a sign of something that\nwe would not otherwise know. Roughness of the tongue, for example, is\na sign (sēmeion) of fever (DS 462b26–32);\nthe large size of hailstones is a sign (sēmeion) they\nhave been formed close to the earth (Meteor.\n348a33–36). But while knowledge of signs constitutes evidence,\nit does not, in themselves, represent scientific knowledge. Scientific\nknowledge is knowledge not just of facts, but of their causes. Even if\nthe association between sign and signified is without exception, so\nthat one can infer the latter from the former, such an inference is\nnot the same as offering an explanation. It may be, for instance, that\nfever is a reliable sign of illness (Rhet. 1357b18–19):\nall those with fever have an underlying medical condition. But this\ndoes not yet constitute an explanation. Clearly, the fever does not\nexplain the illness. While a particular illness could explain the\nfever, an explanatory inference of this kind would go in the other\ndirection: it would take us from the illness to the fever, showing the\nlatter to be a necessary consequence of the former. A sign, in other\nwords, can establish only what Aristotle calls “the fact”\n(to hoti); showing a correlation between sign and signified\ndoes not, in itself, establish the “reasoned fact” (to\ndioti) (Madden 1952: 372; cf. APo. 78a23). \nNote, too, that the category of explanatory empiricism suggests a\nparticular view of scientific explanation. It suggests that the causal\nfactors to which an explanation appeals will be hidden aspect of the\nnatural world, facts which lie “beneath,” as it were, the\nobservable reality of things. An explanatory empiricist denies we can\nknow such facts. Aristotle is cautious regarding our ability to know\nabout matters that cannot be directly observed. As he writes, when it\ncomes to “matters inaccessible to the senses,” it is\nsufficient if our investigation arrives at a possible cause\n(Meteor. 344a5–7). But Aristotle would also deny that\nwe need knowledge of what is unobservable in order to have a\nsatisfactory explanation. The causes invoked by an Aristotelian\nscience are not occult or hidden. On the contrary, the explanatory\nproperties of things are open to view. It follows that the arguments\nthat constitute a scientific explanation are not inferences from an\nobservable fact to an unobservable cause, such as the behavior of\nDemocritean atoms. They are demonstrative arguments referring to\nactive powers whose operations can be directly perceived. Even when a\nparticular event (such as the formation of hailstones) cannot be\ndirectly perceived, a plausible explanation will be one that appeals\nto observable phenomena (such as the way objects are made smooth by\nfriction). One apparent exception is found in Aristotle’s\nexplanation of the movement of the outermost heavenly sphere. This\nposits a different kind of explanatory principle: a divine substance\nor being (ousia) which is “eternal and unmoved and\nseparated from perceptible things” (Met. 1073a4–5).\nFor the most part, however, Aristotle’s scientific explanations\ninvoke perceptible realities. \nWhat about justificatory empiricism? It seems that no ancient or\nmedieval thinker would have endorsed a strong form of justificatory\nempiricism, which holds that the origins of a theory are irrelevant to\nits epistemic status. But many did insist that all scientific\ntheorizing was answerable to experience. Aristotle was one of them. As\nhe remarks, “we should accept what is evident to the senses\nrather than [mere] reasoning,” and reasoning only if it agrees\nwith the observed facts (GA 760b29–33). He had little\nsympathy with the idea that the natural world could be explained in an\nentirely a priori fashion, as Plato sometimes suggests (e.g.\nRep. 530b7–8, 531c1–5). He criticizes, for\ninstance, the Pythagoreans for forcing their observations of the\nheavens to accord with theory, rather than seeking theories that\naccount for what can be seen to occur (DC 293a25–27).\nAristotle is particularly dismissive of the Eleatic philosophers, who\nin their reasoning “transcended sense perception and disregarded\nit on the grounds of following the argument.” He notes that\nwhile their opinions are supported by reason, it would be\n“almost madness to believe them, when one considers the\nfacts” (GC 325a18–20). The facts in question are\nthose revealed by the senses. \nIf there is a feature of Aristotle’s thought that casts doubt on\nhis empiricism, it is the account of scientific reasoning found in his\nPosterior Analytics. That account is deductive: it involves a\nderivation of the fact to be explained from first principles, the\nlatter being “true, primary, immediate, better known than and\nprior to the conclusion, the latter being related to them as effect to\ncause” (APo. 71b20–24). There has been much\ndebate regarding the role of such demonstrations. But the most\nplausible view is that they are not, for Aristotle, a means of making\nscientific discoveries; they are the way in which such discoveries\nshould be presented (Barnes 1994, xii). Indeed Aristotle expressly\ndenies we can discover explanatory principles by way of demonstration,\nholding that such demonstrations serve merely to make them clear\n(APo. 93b16–18). This view seems consistent with\nAristotle’s practice in his own scientific writings, as well as\nthe methodological remarks found in his biological works. He argues,\nfor instance, that when studying animals “we ought first to take\nthe phenomena that are observed in each group, and then go on to state\ntheir causes” (PA 640a15). While we should not confuse\nAristotle’s empiricism with that of Francis Bacon (Harari 2004:\n35), even his theorizing can be said to begin with what is\nobserved. \nIt remains true, however, that Aristotle’s ideal presentation of\na scientific explanation is that of a demonstration from first\nprinciples. Only such a demonstration, he believes, would make clear\nthe necessary connection that constitutes a causal relation. While he\nrecognizes that this ideal is not always attainable, it remains a\ndesideratum. So how does one arrive at those principles? It\nis here that Aristotle’s empiricism seems on shaky ground. The\nactive properties to which scientific demonstrations appeal are\nuniversals: they are properties common to all beings of a particular\nkind which constitute them as beings of that kind. Aristotle rejects\nthe idea that such universal properties exist extra rem,\nindependently of the individuals that embody them. So in order to\narrive at the principles of scientific explanation we need to\nrecognize the identity of kind among the forms of particular objects\nand thus the universal that is embodied in each of them (Owens 1966:\n168). The process by which we come to grasp the universals required\nfor scientific explanations is known as epagōgē\n(APo. 99b15–100b15), a term commonly (but unhelpfully)\ntranslated as “induction.” \nWhat Aristotle means by this term is notoriously unclear; indeed there\nis some debate about whether he uses it consistently (Ross 1949:\n50; Harari 2004:\n33–34). But it is possible to make some general comments.\nAristotle customarily distinguishes induction from syllogistic\nreasoning, in the sense of demonstration. As he writes in one place,\n“all our beliefs come either through demonstration [dia\nsullogismou] or from induction [ex\nepagōgēs]” (APr. 68b13). The general\ncontrast here is that while “demonstration proceeds from\nuniversals to particulars,” induction takes one “from\nparticulars to universals” (Ross 1949: 47; cf. Top.\n195a13–14). The latter, of course, is precisely what is required\nto discover the principles of scientific explanation. What is unclear,\nhowever, is how we can move from particulars to universals. \nAristotle denies (as we have seen) that the principles of a scientific\ndemonstration are themselves to be reached by way of demonstration (APo. 72b19–20; 93b16–18). But a demonstration\n(sullogismos) is a strong form of argument, in which\nconclusions follow necessarily from the premises (APr.\n24b18–20). So some weaker form of reasoning could be involved,\nsuch as “induction” in our modern sense: a generalization\nover a collection of particulars. The latter gives rise to the\nnotorious “problem of induction” (sect. 4.2),\n of which Aristotle shows some awareness (Top.\n131b19–36): how can any limited range of observations justify a\nuniversal claim? But even leaving this aside, there is a serious\nobjection to understanding Aristotle’s\nepagōgē in this way. The most such a generalization\ncould show that all individuals of a certain class have certain\ncharacteristics (APo. 92a37–92b2): that all swans are\nwhite, for instance. It could not tell us that this characteristic is\nessential, one of the features that constitutes a swan as a swan.\nAristotle also suggests that each of the principles of scientific\nexplanation is in some sense self-evident: it “commands belief\nof itself” (kath’heautēn einai pistēn)\n(Top. 100b19–22). This seems to exclude the idea that\nthese principles are reached by any process of reasoning.\nEpagōgē is, therefore, best regarded as “an\nimmediate apprehension of essences or forms” (Harari 2004: 34)\nthat occurs in the very process of perceiving particular individuals\nof a given kind. \nThere is a problem here for anyone who wants to regard Aristotle as an\nempiricist. While his epagōgē certainly draws on\nthe deliverances of the senses, and could not operate without them, it\nseems to go beyond what the senses could reveal. For Aristotle, as we\nhave seen, sensation is reliable when it comes to its proper objects:\ncolours, sounds, tastes, smells, and tangible properties. But there is\na gap between sensing such properties and perceiving the\ncharacteristics that are essential to objects of a particular kind\n(Taylor 1990: 127–28). Even if we can reliably synthesize the\nproper objects of perception into the objects of everyday experience\n(tables, trees, and so on), it requires a further step to decide which\nproperties belong necessarily to such objects. (For a less pessimistic\nview of the powers of epagōgē, see Barnes 1994: 267–71.) \nIf this is true, it is not clear what conclusion we should draw. One\npossible conclusion is that Aristotle is not a cognitive empiricist,\nsince at a key point he relies on a rationalist, indeed\n“super-rationalist” view of cognition, one in which the\n(active) intellect “has nothing to learn from experience”\n(Kahn 1981: 410–11; cf.\n sect. 4.3).\n Experience would provide merely the occasion on which the necessary\ninsight is gained. A second possible conclusion is that while\nAristotle’s theory of knowledge was thoroughly\nempiricist, it was doomed to failure. The reliance on experience he\nadvocated could not lead to the kind of insights he required\n(Gaukroger 1978: 124). A third possible conclusion is that his\nposition transcends the distinction between empiricism and\nrationalism, epagōgē being “a form of\nperceptive insight” that enables one to see the intelligible\naspect of what is grasped by the senses (Ziguras 2013: 96). But\nhowever we assess Aristotle’s views, the question they raised\nwould return, to haunt the work of the medievals. \nFor further examples of ancient empiricist doctrine we can turn to the\nmedical writers and sceptics of the Hellenistic age (a roughly\n300-year period following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE)\nand the teachings of Epicurus (ca. 341–270 BCE) and his\nfollowers. The medical writers and sceptics offer a sophisticated form\nof explanatory empiricism, while the Epicureans offer a strong view of\nthe reliability of sense perception coupled with a cautious acceptance\nof inferences to what is “not evident,” such as the\nexistence and activity of atoms. \nThe first people to describe themselves as empiricists\n(empeirikoi) were a group of medical writers of the\nHellenistic period. We know of these thinkers only indirectly, through\nthe work of other ancient writers, in particular Galen of Pergamon\n(129–ca. 200 CE). As medical practitioners, their primary\nconcerns were practical: finding the correct method of diagnosis and\ntreatment. But in discussing these matters they put forward some\ngeneral epistemological claims, developing the empiricist tendencies\nalready found in the Hippocratic writings (sect. 3.1).\n In particular, they set themselves in opposition to those whom they\ncalled “rationalists” (logikoi) or\n“dogmatists” (dogmatikoi). What set them apart\nwas a refusal to posit causes beyond those that can be observed. \nIn spelling out their position the empiricists distinguished between\ntwo styles of inference. What they rejected was the variety of\nreasoning they called “analogism” (analogismos),\nwhich “starts from what is apparent but ends up with what is\nentirely unclear” (Galen SB ch. 5). In its place they\nadvocated what they called “epilogism”\n(epilogimos), which deals “solely with what is\napparent,” but can be used “to discover what is currently\nunseen” (Galen SB ch. 5). The idea here is that while the\ncause that is inferred may be currently hidden, the inference is based\non an association that is, at other times, directly observable.\nEpilogismos, the empiricists argued, is a form of reasoning\nused by all human beings, which leads to a consensus, while\nanalogismos leads to disagreement and conclusions that can be\nneither confirmed nor denied (Galen ME ch. 24). \nWhile we know of the medical empiricists only indirectly, we do have\nfirst-hand access to the thought of another group of explanatory\nempiricists, namely the sceptics of the Pyrrhonian school as\nrepresented by the writings of Sextus Empiricus (ca. 150–225\nCE). (The empiricus title suggests that he, too, was\nassociated with the medical writers.) Worth noting, first of all, is\nSextus’s presentation of the problem of induction\n(epagōgē). This assumes that\nepagōgē is simply a process of enumerative\ninduction. As we have already seen\n (sect. 3.2),\n this is unlikely to be what Aristotle understood by the term, but given this understanding of induction,\nSextus is quick to point out its inadequacy. Those who follow this\nprocedure must survey “all the particulars or some of\nthem.” If they survey only some, the induction will be\ninsecure, since it may be that some of the omitted particulars lack\nthe feature in question. But if they try to survey all, “they\nwill labour at an impossible task, since the particulars are infinite\nand indefinite” (Sextus PH 2.204). The argument is not\nstrictly sound, since there are cases in which we know (or believe we\nknow) all the instances. An example offered by John Buridan\n(1295–1358) was that of a proposition regarding all the (six)\nplanets (SD 6.1.5). But the question would remain a\nlive one for any would-be empiricist. \nDoes this scepticism rule out any kind of general knowledge? The\nsceptics, of course, are not interested in developing general laws or\nprinciples. If they do discuss scientific matters, it is only to show\nthat for any one theory, a contrary but equally persuasive theory can\nbe developed (Sextus PH 1.18). But they do not deny that for\npractical purposes we can rely on the observed association of\nparticular kinds of events. Of importance here is Sextus’s\ndistinction between two types of sign: the “commemorative”\nor “recollective” (hypomynēstikon) and the\n“indicative” (endeiktikon). An indicative sign is\nthought to signify some reality that has not directly been observed.\nIt does so on account of what Sextus calls “its proper nature\nand constitution” (Sextus PH 2.101). The idea here\nseems to be that of a necessary connection between the sign and what\nit indicates, known by reason rather than by experience. The inference\nfrom movement to the possession of a soul, for example, makes use of\nan indicative sign, for the soul can never be directly observed. In\nSextus’s view, inferences of this kind cannot be justified. Sextus\nis, however, happy to endorse the use of commemorative signs, which\nare based on nothing more than the past experience of the association\nof two kinds of phenomena. Smoke, for instance, is a commemorative\nsign of fire; a scar is a commemorative sign that the bearer has\nreceived a wound (Sextus PH 2.102). \nWhile we may think of these as two forms of inference, Sextus denied\nthat reliance on commemorative signs involves any inference at all,\nsince it does not involve making a judgement. He argued that if it did\ninvolve an inference, you would expect those who had no knowledge of\nlogic to be less skilled in this respect. But, as he writes,\n“illiterate helmsmen and farmers with no experience of\ndialectical principles are expert judges of signs [akrōs\nsēmeiountai]”, being able to predict (in one case) a\ncoming storm or calm weather and (in the other) a good or a poor\nharvest (Sextus M VII 2.270). Indeed, even non-human animals\ngain knowledge in this way. As Sextus writes, “the dog, when it\ntracks an animal by its footprints, is actually using signs\n[sēmeioutai],” but it is not making inferences. In\nSextus’s words, “it does not formulate the judgement\n‘if this is a footprint, a beast is here’” (Sextus\nM VII 2.271). This deflationary view may be what allows\nSextus to reconcile a reliance on commemorative signs with his\nscepticism. \nThe aim of the ancient sceptics was not to achieve knowledge of\nnature; it was to attain “tranquillity in matters of\nopinion” (kata doxan ataraxia) (Sextus PH\n1.15). Something similar may be said about the Epicureans. Their\nmovement can be regarded as a “secular religion” (Milton\n2002: 182), which aimed to achieve a knowlege of nature only insofar\nas this promoted peace of mind. (For a more vigorous defence of the\nscientific credentials of Epicureanism, see Asmis 1984.) But even if\nthis is true, the writings of Epicurus and his followers do embody a\ndistinctive form of empiricism. It is, first of all, a tabula\nrasa empiricism, holding that the evidence of the senses is\n“the base and foundation” of all our knowledge (Sextus M\nVII 1.216). But it differs from some other forms of empiricism\nboth in regarding as infallible the immediate deliverances of\nperception and allowing for the mind to be affected by external\nobjects in ways independent of the five senses. Epicurean empiricism\nis also more tolerant than that of the medical writers and sceptics,\nsince it accepts inferences to unobservable causes. It is not, in\nother words, an explanatory empiricism. Indeed this seems to be the\nreason why the more sceptical Sextus counts Epicureans among the\n“dogmatists” (PH 1.3). \nIn a work entitled On the Criterion or The Canon (Peri\nkritēriou ē kanōn), Epicurus is said to have\nargued that all sensations (aisthēseis) are reliable,\nthere being nothing that can refute them (Diogenes Laërtius [DL]\n10.31). Sextus sums up this Epicurean doctrine as the view that\n“all sensed things … are true and existent” (Sextus\nM VII 2.9). On the face of it, this seems an untenable\nposition. Do our senses not deceive us? Do we not see sticks as bent\nwhere they enter water or a distant large object as small? There are\ntwo responses an Epicurean would make. The first is to make a clear\ndistinction (comparable to that made by Aristotle\n [sect. 3.2])\n between our sensations and the opinions we form on the basis of what\nwe sense. When it comes to our opinions, Epicurus held that\n“some them are true and others are false, since they are\njudgements of ours concerning what appears, and we judge sometimes\nrightly and sometimes wrongly” (Sextus M VII 1.210).\nWhen we make mistakes, in other words, it is not the senses that are\nto blame. Secondly, the senses are verdical because the impressions\nthey form are not “purely private mental phenomena”\n(O’Keefe 2010: 100). They are brought about by the objects of\nwhich they testify, which emit a continuous flow of images or\nsimulacra (eidōla) from their surfaces\n(Epicurus Ep. Hdt. 46–51). On this view, the senses are\nreliably informative, faithfully reflecting the objects that produced\nthem, even if we later attribute to them a false propositional\ncontent. \nEpicurean empiricism is, however, a relatively tolerant form of\nempiricism. It is tolerant, first of all, insofar as it does not\nrestrict perception to what is received by way of the five senses.\nEpicurus and his followers seem to have regarded the mind itself as a\nkind of “supersense” (DeWitt 1954: 207–9), capable\nof receiving eidōla on its own account. (This doctrine\nbears some resemblance to one of the Buddhist beliefs mentioned earlier [sect. 1].)\n The Epicurean writer Lucretius (ca. 95–54 BCE), for instance,\nclaims that some of the simulacra thrown off by objects are\nexceedingly fine, such that they can penetrate the body and affect the\nmind independently of the five senses. This allows him to account for\nthe images we see in dreams, which accurately reflect aspects of the\nworld, although in a manner that deceives us (Lucretius RN\n4.722–31, 5.1168–71). \nEpicurean empiricism is also more tolerant insofar as it allows for\nexplanatory inferences to unobservable entities. More precisely,\nEpicurus speaks of two kinds of inferences from what is perceived to\nwhat is currently unobserved. The first is an inference to “that\nwhich awaits confirmation” (to prosmenon); the second\nis an inference to “that which is non-evident” (to\nadēlon) (Epicurus Ep. Hdt. 38.10). Reflecting on\nthe views of Epicureans and other “dogmatists,” Sextus\nmakes a similar distinction (PH 2.97–98). He speaks,\nfirstly, of an inference to something that is “for the\nmoment” (pros kairon) non-evident, but which will\nbecome evident in due course. His example is the city of Athens, which\n(assuming I am not at Athens) will become evident to me if I travel\nthere. This corresponds to Epicurus’s “that which awaits\nconfirmation” (DL 10.34). But Sextus also speaks of entities\nthat are “non-evident by nature” (ta … phusei\nadēla), whose existence and activity, he writes, some\n“dogmatists” regard as knowable by inference. One of his\nexamples is the Epicurean (and Democritean) belief in atoms moving in\nthe void (Sextus M VII 2.319). This corresponds to\nEpicurus’s “that which is non-evident.” Note that\nSextus adds to these two a third category: that of matters which are\n“altogether non-evident” (ta kathapax adēla)\n(PH 2.97), which even dogmatists agreed could never be known\nby any kind of inference, his example being whether the number of\nstars is odd or even. \nWhat kinds of inference (on the Epicurean view) could be used to\nsupported belief in unobservable entities? In the case of entities\nunobservable only “for the moment,” the answer is clear.\nOne can make a conjecture and then test it when the entity in question\nbecomes observable (Sextus M VII 1.212). But in the case of\nthings that are “non-evident by nature,” only indirect\nconfirmation is possible. Epicurus’s view seems to have been\nthat a hypothesis consistent with experience—one that is not\n“witnessed against”—can and should be accepted\n(Sextus M VII 1.216). But of course two or more hypotheses\nmay survive this test. Remarkably, Epicurus and his followers seem to\nhave held that in these circumstances they can all be accepted, not\njust as possible, but as true, being realized at some time or in some\nplace (Allen 2004: 95; cf. Lucretius RN 5.526–33).\nWhile this may have seemed plausible in a universe infinite in extent\nand unlimited in time, it leaves open the question of which of these\nexplanations applies to the particular case we are interested in.\nEpicurus seems to have held that we should not always expect to be\nable to answer this question (Ep. Pyth. 86). Nor do we need\nto do so; the knowledge that an event has some natural explanation is\nsufficient to free us from a superstitious fear of the gods (Ep.\nPyth. 87). \nIt is hardly surprising, given the influence of Christianity, that\nneither ancient scepticism nor Epicureanism found much of a following\namong medieval thinkers. But the attitudes associated with the medical\nempiricism of late antiquity did not entirely disappear: we find at\nleast hints of these among late medieval writers. A striking example\nis the polemical work Antipocras by Nicholas of Poland\n(fl. 1278). While himself an educated man, trained within the\nscholastic tradition and assocated with the medical school at\nMontpellier, Nicholas advocated a medical practice based on\nexperience, praising the knowledge of common people over against that\nof the scholars. This may have been a reaction to the more theoretical\nstyle of medicine developing at Montpellier as a result of the\ndiscovery of works by Galen and some Arab writers (Eamon & Keil\n1987: 195). But for evidence of more general empiricist doctrines, we\nmust turn to the followers of Aristotle. \nThe medieval followers of Aristotle shared his confidence in the\nreliability of the senses. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), for\nexample, follows Aristotle in holding that sensation is not deceived\nwith regard to its proper objects, such as colours and sounds\n(ST 1a 17.3), provided that the sense organs are functioning\nproperly and in the right circumstances (Pasnau 2002:\n188–89). \nDid medieval philosophers embrace a tabula rasa empiricism?\nThe Latin phrase characterizing an empiricism of this\nkind—nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in\nsensu—was something of a commonplace. It is found (in\nvariant forms) in the work of Bonaventure (1221–1274), where it\nis attributed to Aristotle, Aquinas, Matthew of Aquasparta (ca.\n1240–1302), and Duns Scotus (1266–1308) (Cranefield 1970:\n78–79). Not all accepted the idea, as we shall see, but\nAristotelians generally took it for granted. Aquinas follows Aristotle\n(DA 432a7–9) in holding that all the objects of our\nunderstanding “have their being in the objects of\nperception,” rather than in some separated, Platonic realm. It\nfollows that “without sense perception no one can either learn\nanything new, nor understand matters already learned.” Even when\nwe are thinking about something we already know, our thought is always\naccompanied by an image (a “phantasm”), which is a\nlikeness of something that can be perceived (Aquinas In DA\n3.13 [para. 791]). \nBut even when they speak of the mind as a tabula rasa, we\nshould not attribute to medieval writers the kind of genetic\nempiricism later found in the work of John Locke. The blank tablet of\nwhich medievals speak, following Aristotle (DA 430a1), is\nwhat they called the “passive” or “potential”\nintellect, which was only one element in the process of cognition\n (sect. 4.3).\n When it comes to the larger picture, medieval philosophers will often\ncombine the Aristotelian idea that all knowledge comes through the\nsenses with Augustinian views, which speak of divine illumination\n (sect. 4.2)\n or innate knowledge. Even Aquinas held that we have a kind of innate\ncapacity, ultimately given by God, to grasp the first principles of\nscientific knowledge (Pasnau 2002: 307–8). This is probably best\nthought of as a kind of a dispositional innatism: we are\ndisposed to form certain ideas when presented with the right kind of\nexperience. At times Aquinas seems to go further. He writes, for\ninstance, that our knowledge arises “partly from within and\npartly from without” and that there is some truth in the idea\nthat “we already know that which we learn” (Aquinas\nDV 10.6). But what he seems to mean here is that the\nprinciples we employ in forming our beliefs are implicit in the\nstructure of the mind and its operations (Allers 1942: 58) (see\n sect. 4.3).\n Other writers approach the tabula rasa idea from the other\ndirection, beginning with a clear commitment to innate knowledge.\nRoger Bacon (1215–1292), for instance, suggests that the human\nsoul is created with the species (aspects or forms) of all\nthings within it, which seems a strongly Augustinian conception of\nknowledge. But since the soul’s union with the body hinders our\naccess to this knowledge, the human mind (as potential intellect) can\nbe described as a “blank slate” (tabula nuda or\nrasa) (Bacon In Phys. pp. 7, 9; R. Wood 2007: 54). A\nsimilar view is found in the work of Robert Grosseteste (ca.\n1165–1253), who also combines a modified Augustinian belief in\ndivine illumination\n (sect. 4.2)\n with the Aristotelian idea that we gain knowledge of scientific\nprinciples from experience (van Dyke 2009: 688–89). \nWhile these look like puzzling combinations of empiricist and\nnon-empiricist views, their rationale will become clear shortly\n (sect. 4.3).\n But alongside this qualified genetic empiricism, we also find\nexpressions of a justificatory empiricism. In particular, the work of\nRoger Bacon sets out two forms of justificatory empiricism, both of\nwhich fall under the heading of what he calls scientia\nexperimentalis. The first involves confirming well-founded\ndeliverances of reason by “trying them out,” as it were,\nfor oneself (Hackett 2015: sect. 5.4.3). Bacon’s rationale for\nurging this kind of testing is that arguments alone are insufficient\nto convince us of the truth of any practical matter.\n“Reasoning,” he writes, \ndraws a conclusion and forces us to grant it, but it does not confirm\nit nor remove doubt so that the mind may rest in the knowledge of the\ntruth, unless this is found by way of experience. … For if a\nman … should prove by way of adequate arguments that fire burns\nand harms and destroys things, still the mind of the hearer would not\nrest on this account nor would such a person avoid fire before he had\nplaced his hand or some combustible material in fire, so that he might\ntest by experience [ut per experientiam probaret] what the\nargument had taught. (Bacon OM 6.1) \nIt follows (in a phrase for which Bacon has become famous) that\n“without experience nothing can be sufficiently known”\n(sine experientia nihil sufficienter sciri potest)\n(OM 6.1). \nA second form of justificatory empiricism holds that some beliefs can\nbe defended only by reference to experience, there being no\narguments from prior principles that can be adduced in their support.\nThese include, first of all, matters within the domain of the other\nsciences which mere reasoning could never have revealed, such as the\npractical discoveries made by alchemists (Bacon OM 6, 2a\nprae.). But there are also matters that fall outside the domain of any\nspeculative science, fields of inquiry in which scientia\nexperimentalis “by its own power investigates the secrets\nof nature” (Bacon OM 6, 3a prae.). To appreciate what\nthis kind of investigation entailed, we need to understand the class\nof phenomena to which it applied: that of the secrets of nature. \nThe domain of natural philosophy was “the common course of\nnature” (Biard 2001: 79, 80): it dealt with what occurred (in\nAristotle’s phrase) “either always or for the most\npart” (ē tou aei ē tou hōs epi to polu)\n(Met. 1207a21–22). But there existed phenomena that\nfell outside this domain, namely miracles and marvels. Miracles, in\nthe strict sense, were supernatural occurrences, which fell in the\ndomain of theology. But marvellous phenomena were often thought of as\n“preternatural,” that is to say, as brought about by\noccult but natural properties and powers (Daston 1991: 95–100).\nSuch powers included the influence exercised by the heavenly bodies on\nearthly affairs, as well as mysterious properties of sublunary\nentities, such as the lodestone. These powers were occult in the sense\nof being hidden. But they were also mysterious in that their workings\nwere not explicable in terms of what Aristotelians believed to be the\nfour simple substances (earth, air, fire, and water) and their\nassociated primary qualities (the hot and the cold, the moist and the\ndry) (Pasnau 2011: 44). It is for this reason that they could not be\nproved to exist by demonstrative arguments, but could be known only by\nexperience. This gave rise to a particular form of empiricism\nassociated with the study of “natural magic.” \nAn example can be found in the work of an author already mentioned:\nNicholas of Poland, the radical medical empiricist of Montpellier. In\nhis Antipocras Nicholas claims that although the presence of\na divinely given power in the most humble of objects cannot be proven\nby reason, it “is made evident by its effect” (hoc\npatet effectu) (Nicholas of Poland Ant. ll.\n202–3). In this respect Nicholas seems to have been influenced\nby another work more closely associated with magic, the De\nmirabilibus mundi. This states that there are “certain\neffects manifest to the senses to which we can assign no\nreason,” as well as effects known only by way of reason. The\nmarvellous powers of natural objects belong to the former category,\nwhich are known by way of practical experience (per\nexperientiam) (Ps-Albertus PA-DM para. 49–50).\nWhile this work was falsely attributed to Albert the Great (ca.\n1200–1280), Albert himself adopts a similar line when defending\nthe mysterious powers of certain stones: these, too, are known\n“most convincingly by experience,” although they lack a\nscientific explanation (A-DM 2.1.1). \nWhen medieval writers speak of knowing matters per\nexperientiam (by experience), they are understanding the term experientia very broadly. The same may be said of the term experimentalis, so that the phrase\nscientia experimentalis should be translated as\n“experiential knowledge” rather than “experimental science.”\nAlthough Bacon’s scientia experimentalis did include\npractical procedures (experimenta), as were used in alchemy,\nas well as the use of instruments (as in the study of optics and\nastronomy), it also included simple observation as well as reliance on\nsecond-hand reports of dubious value. (We are still a long way from\nthe motto of the seventeenth-century Royal Society: nullius in\nverba, “take no man’s word for it.”) Nor is\nthere any consistent link with quantification. In only a few fields,\nsuch as astronomy, are the procedures employed by natural philosophers\nassociated with careful measurement. In the century following\nBacon’s work, we do find the development of what we may call\n“quantified concepts,” particularly in the study of local\nmotion. We find this, in particular, in the work of the Oxford\ncalculatores associated with Merton College, who are perhaps best known for their formulation of the “mean speed theorem.” This was\nthe idea that  \na uniform acceleration produces the same … distance travelled\nin a given time, as a uniform velocity equal to the instantaneous\nvelocity at the middle instance of the time of acceleration. (Crombie\n1961: 153)  \nBut while such developments mark a break with the Aristotelian\ntradition of a purely qualitative physics, they remain largely\ntheoretical. While the discussions giving rise to the mean speed\ntheorem emerged from everyday observations of falling bodies, the\ntheorem itself was proven arithmetically and geometrically (Clagett\n1959: 256, 259–60). The principles developed were not\n“operationalized,” that is to say, expressed in forms that\nwould allow for experimental testing (Clagett 1959: 206). Their\nexperimental testing had to await Galileo’s inclined plane\nexperiments (Crombie 1961: 153–54). \nThis broad understanding of experience is evident, too, in medieval\nconceptions of the origin and scope of perceptual knowledge. With\nregard to the origins of such knowledge, later empiricists would focus\nalmost exclusively on the five “exterior senses.” But\nmedieval authors, following Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā;\n980–1037), commonly list up to five “interior\nsenses” (Bates 2010: 138–39) alongside the exterior ones.\nAquinas reduces these to four: the common sense, the imagination, the\nvis aestimativa (or cogitativa), and the sense\nmemory (Aquinas ST 1a 78.4). The work of these interior\nsenses involves an active role in shaping our perceptions, even those\nof our physical environment. The mind, in other words, is not entirely\npassive, even at its basic levels of operation. The vis\naestimativa, for instance, refers to the power that even\nnon-rational creatures have of making judgements about what is\ndangerous or useful: it shapes our perceptions by adding an evaluative\ncomponent. (There is something analogous here to James Gibson’s\ntheory of “affordances”\n [sect. 2.2].) \nWith regard to the scope of experience, this was generally thought to\ninclude knowledge of our own interior acts. That we have some kind of\nimmediate access to such knowledge was “one of the truisms of\nAugustinian thought” (Leff 1975: 28). Its mechanism was\nunclear—Scotus says simply that we know these things “by\nway of a certain sense, that is, an interior perception”\n(quodam sensu, id est, perceptione interiore) (Scotus\nOrd. IV d. 43, q. 2)—but its existence was not in\ndoubt. As an anonymous scribe wrote in the margin of one of\nOckham’s manuscripts, the idea that “there is nothing in\nthe intellect unless it was formerly in the senses” applies to\n“external objects, not to its own acts” (Leff 1975: 28\nn.116). In Bacon’s work, this focus on inner experience is taken\na step further, insofar as his conception of experience embraces not\nonly our everyday mental states, but also spiritual states up to and\nincluding “raptures” in which people have visions of\nthings “of which it is not lawful for human beings to\nspeak” (Bacon OM 6.2). These are experiences brought\nabout by the grace of God, rather than any purely natural process of\ncognition. \nWe have seen that medieval thought included a qualified form of\ntabula rasa empiricism and a distinctive form of\njustificatory empiricism, coupled with a broad undersanding of\n“experience.” There is no need to dwell on explanatory\nempiricism, for insofar as medieval natural philosophy was influenced\nby Aristotle it shared his view of scientific explanations. For the\nmost part these did not invoke unobservable entities, such as atoms,\nbut manifest powers of the entities we can perceive\n (sect. 3.2).\n Medieval thinkers did not deny that we could know about unobservable\nentities. God, after all, was an unobservable entity, and thinkers\nsuch as Aquinas thought that “natural reason” could know\nsomething about God, albeit by way of analogy. (William of Ockham [ca.\n1285–1347] would later downplay the extent of such knowledge,\nwithout dismissing it altogether [Leff 1975: 382–98].) But there\nwere limits to what we could know about the unobservable features of the natural world (Hutchison 1982: 235–36). Aquinas, for\ninstance, appears to endorse Aristotle’s view that when it comes\nto matters that are “not manifest to the senses”\n(immanifesta sensui) we should not demand “a certain\nand necessary demonstration”; a merely possible explanation may\nbe the best we can achieve (Aquinas In Meteor. 1.7 [lect.\n11]). One could regard this as a modest kind of explanatory\nempiricism. But the focus here will be on a different question, namely\nwhether any medievals were cognitive empiricists, denying that we have\nintellectual powers or capacities giving access to factual knowledge\nindependently of experience.  \nFollowers of St Augustine shared Plato’s doubts about the\ncapacity of sense perception, in particular about its ability to give\nrise to scientific knowledge. Such knowledge, they held, did not arise\nfrom sense perception alone; it required a further input, provided by\nGod himself: a divine illumination. This can be a difficult idea for a\nmodern reader to grasp, since it is easily confused with another\nbelief, which has to do with a supernatural source of knowledge\naccessed by faith. The two are analogous, insofar as they both involve\na divine initiative. The act of faith requires a divine initiative\n“on the volitional side,” to enable us to accept\npropositions as divinely revealed. The doctrine of divine illumination\nalso speaks of a divine initiative, but that initiative is directly\ncognitive rather than volitional (Pasnau 2015: sect. 1). It holds that\ndivine illumination is required for a number of apparently ordinary\ncognitive activities, which are engaged in by believers and\nnon-believers alike. \nWhile this doctrine has theological roots, it was also motivated by\ntwo features of human knowledge. The first has to do with those\nprinciples of thought that appear to be necessarily, not contingently,\ntrue. These include mathematical truths and principles such as that of\nnon-contradiction or sufficient reason. While such principles are\nessential to thought, it is difficult to see how they could be derived\nfrom sense perception. (Aristotle had provided an empiricist account\nof the origin of mathematical ideas\n [sect. 3.2],\n but this was, and remains, contested.) A second motivation was\nrelated to the Aristotelian ideal of science. Scientia, as we\nhave seen, involved a grasp of the essential properties of perceived\nobjects. But this, too, involves a kind of insight that can seem to\nlie beyond the capacity of the senses\n (sect. 3.2).\n Advocates of divine illumination argued that these kinds of knowledge\nwere possible only because the human mind has access to the mind of\nGod. More precisely, it was possible only because God bathed the human\nmind in his own, uncreated light. This allowed it not only to grasp\nnecessary truths, but to understand the essences of created beings by\nreference to their exemplars in the divine mind. \nThe development of medieval empiricism involved a rejection of this\ndoctrine. It is already opposed by Aquinas, who holds that that the\nhuman mind requires a special divine illumination only for those\nmatters that entirely exceed its natural powers, which are known by\ndivine revelation (Aquinas ST 1a 2ae 109.1). But the most\nvigorous rejection of the doctrine is to be found in the work of Duns\nScotus, who opposes the (modified) illuminationist teaching found in\nthe work of Henry of Ghent (ca. 1217–1293). \nHenry’s version of the illuminationist doctrine was already\ninfluenced by Aristotelian thought (Marrone 1985: 145; 2011: 24),\nwhich in this context took the form of a desire to attribute as much\nas possible to the power of the human mind. But Henry was reluctant to\nattribute all we know to our unaided powers. In particular, he made a\ndistinction between knowing what is true (id quod verum est)\nabout an object and knowing its truth (eius veritatem). The\nfirst is a very basic level of knowledge, existing even in non-human\nanimals. It does grasp its object as a something distinct from the\nknower, but fails to grasp its essential characteristics. Such\nknowledge is not sufficient for science, which requires a grasp of\nwhat the object truly is (quid sit in rei veritate) (Henry of\nGhent Summa 1.2). The latter kind of knowledge requires\naccess to the exemplar of the object in the divine mind, something\nonly God can give. \nIt is this idea that Duns Scotus opposes. He would not, of course,\nhave opposed the idea that the human mind was created by God and thus\nowes all its powers to God. (Scotus was, after all, a theologian.) But he did deny\nthat scientific knowledge involved a special divine illumination. His\nargument proceeds in two stages. He insists, first of all, that\nHenry’s restrictions on the powers of the human mind, rather\nthan leading to scientific certainty, lead inevitably to scepticism.\nIf the human mind is naturally incapable of grasping these truths,\nthen no amount of divine light will help it. He then argues that there\nare four kinds of naturally attainable knowledge that give rise to the\ncertainty required for science. There is, first of all, knowledge of\n“matters knowable in an unqualified sense,” such as the\nfact that a triangle has three angles equal to two right angles. The\nsecond is knowledge of “matters knowable through\nexperience,” such as that the moon is eclipsed. The third is\nknowledge of “our own actions,” such as the fact that I am\nawake. The fourth is knowledge of “matters we are currently\naware of through the senses,” such as that the object in front\nof me is white (Scotus Ord. I dist. 3, pars 1, qu. 4,\nadnot.). \nPerhaps the most critical of these is knowledge through experience,\nfor it relates to the way we grasp the principles of scientific\nexplanation. Scotus’s suggestion is that we can know these\nprinciples through repeated exposure to particular instances. As he\nwrites,  \neven though a person does not experience every single individual, but\nonly a great many, nor does he experience them at all times, but only\nfrequently, still be knows infallibly that it is always this way and\nholds for all instances. He knows this in virtue of this proposition\nreposing in his soul: “Whatever occurs in a great many instances\nby a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that\ncause.” (Scotus Ord. I dist. 3, pars 1, qu. 4) \nScotus seems to regard this proposition as self-evidently true. But as\nNicholas of Autrecourt (1299–1369) would point out, it merely\nbegs the question (Thijssen 1987: 249). In any case, Nicholas writes,\nif Scotus means by a cause “that which brought an effect in a\ngreat many instances in the past and will do so in the future,”\nthen there is a problem. For “even if something has brought\nabout an effect in a great many instances, it is still not certain it\nwill continue to do so” (Nicholas of Autrecourt EO ll.\n44–47; Thijssen 1987: 249 n. 44). So we cannot, with certainty,\nform general statements on the basis of the kind of observations to\nwhich Scotus appeals. (This is, of course, the very problem of\ninduction to which Sextus Empiricus had referred\n [sect. 3.3].)\n Even if we could formulate such general statements, we could not be\ncertain that they embody causal claims. \nWe shall come back to this question\n (sect. 4.3),\n which was made more pressing by the nominalism of Scotus’s\nsuccessor, William of Ockham. But even if Scotus had no satisfactory\nalternative to the doctrine of divine illumination, that doctrine was\nsoon eclipsed. By the mid-fourteenth century, it seems to have been no\nlonger considered a viable option. While the idea did not entirely\ndisappear—it re-emerges, for instance, in the work of Nicolas\nMalebranche (1638–1715)—its rejection by late medieval\nthinkers marked an important step on the road to a more thorough-going\nempiricism.  \nAdvocates of the doctrine of divine illumination would not count as\ncognitive empiricists, for they held that the mind has access to a\nsource of knowledge that is independent of the senses. What about\nthose who rejected this doctrine? In many cases it is also difficult\nto regard them as cognitive empiricists, because of the remarkable\npower they continued to attribute to the mind: that of grasping the\nuniversals embedded in the singular objects of sense perception. What\nwe see in the work of William of Ockham is a downgrading of this\npower, which goes hand-in-hand with a rethinking of the idea of\nuniversals. Ockham’s work thus laid the foundations on which\nearly modern empiricists would build. \nThe power of the mind to grasp universals was traditionally attributed\nto what was called the “agent intellect,” the intellect as\nactive or productive. The idea of the agent (or active) intellect is\none of the most complex and contested aspects of medieval\nepistemology. It has its origins in some cryptic remarks made by\nAristotle (DA 430a10–19), in which he distinguishes\nbetween two aspects of the mind. There is the mind as “that\nwhich becomes all things” (nous tōi panta\nginesthai) and there is the mind as “that which makes all\nthings” (ho … tōi panta poiein). Behind\nthese descriptions is the idea that the mind “becomes” the\nobject of its knowledge, in the sense of taking on its intelligible\nform without the matter in which it was originally embodied. The mind\nas passive—as that which becomes all things—stands in\nrelation to the mind that makes all things in the same way that prime\nmatter, which is pure potential, stands in relation to its shaping\nprinciple. Aristotle describes the mind as active or\nproductive—the nous poiētikos, to use a phrase\ncoined by his commentators—in terms that suggest something\nimmaterial: it is “separable, unmixed, and impassible.”\nThis may be because it is not so much a substance, as an operation or\nfunction; indeed Aristotle describes the nous poiētikos\nas “by nature activity” (tēi ousiai …\nenergeia). \nAs that last interpretive remark suggests, this passage demands\ncommentary and commentators disagreed about how it was to be\nunderstood. (For a classic survey, see Brentano 1992.) Broadly\nspeaking, there were two views. The first held that the agent\nintellect was separate from each human mind, such that the\nintelligible forms “flow” from this immaterial entity into\nthe mind to produce an act of understanding. This was the view held,\nin two quite different forms, by Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna) and Ibn\nRushd (Averroës) (1126–1198). Such a view implies that\nthere is only one agent intellect, common to all human beings, which\nmay or may not be identified with God himself. (When it is identified\nwith God, this view closely resembles the Augustinian doctrine of\ndivine illumination.) The alternative idea, vigorously defended by\nAquinas, held that both the agent intellect and the potential\nintellect are aspects of the human mind. Even among those who held\nthat latter view, there were different ways in which the agent\nintellect was thought to produce knowledge. In some versions of the\ndoctrine (such as Aquinas’s) the agent intellect was thought to\nabstract the intelligible forms from the images produced by the\nsenses. In other versions, the input of the senses was little more\nthan the occasion on which the agent intellect drew on its own innate\nresources, in the process of which the mind could be thought of as\nenlightened by God. Thomas of York (d. ca. 1260), for instance spoke\nopenly in this context of innate ideas and of a knowledge that came\n“from above and not from the senses” (Bowman 1973:\n265). \nThe second of these views, in particular, seems incompatible with both\na tabula rasa and a cognitive empiricism. So it is not\nsurprising that the development of a more thoroughgoing cognitive\nempiricism went hand-in-hand with with an effective abandonment of the\nidea of the agent intellect. \nThe work of the agent intellect had seemed essential because of a\nwidely held view regarding the object of knowledge. This held that\nwhile the senses deal with particular individuals, the intellect can\ngrasp only their universal properties. As Aquinas writes, citing\nAristotle (APo. 87b37–39), “sense has to do with\nparticulars, whereas intellect has to do with universals”\n(sensus particularium, intellectus … universalium)\n(Aquinas In DA 2.5 [sect. 284]). (The idea that the intellect\nhas direct knowledge only of universals seems distinctively\nAristotelian; it was not shared by other ancient philosophical schools\n[Normore 2007: 114].) Aquinas’s reason for holding this view is\nthat the intellect, as an immaterial substance, cannot directly grasp\nmaterial singulars. Intellectual knowledge therefore requires the work\nof the agent intellect, abstracting the immaterial intelligible forms\nfrom the perceptible forms grasped by the senses. We do, of course,\nknow singular objects, for all the objects of sensation are,\nultimately, singulars. But in Aquinas’s view, the intellect\nknows these objects only indirectly, by directing its attention back\nto the images yielded by the senses and linking these with the\nassociated general concept (Aquinas ST 1a 86.1). \nWilliam of Ockham, on the other hand, holds what Aquinas expressly\ndenies: that “the singular object is that which is first known,\nin a manner simple and proper to itself” (Ockham Quodl.\nI qu. 13). He holds, too, that the immateriality of the intellect is\nno barrier to this, since the relation involved is a merely\nintentional one (Ockham Ord. I dist. 3, qu. 6; In\nPhys. 1.1 [sect. 2]). Ockham, however, goes further in denying the\nvery existence of universals. All Aristotelians, of course, denied\nthat universals exist extra rem (distinct from singular\nobjects). But Christian Aristotelians such as Aquinas continued to\nregard the similarities between individuals of a given kind as the\nproduct of a common idea, which existed ante rem (before the\nexistence of particular objects) in the mind of God (Aquinas\nST 1a 15.2). As aspects of the divine mind, these were\nthought to share in the divine nature. Indeed they were nothing less\nthan “the divine essence as imitable outside itself”\n(Klocker 1980: 357). This gave the natural kinds discoverable by\nscience a metaphysical grounding. While paying lip service to the\nAugustinian notion of ideas in the divine mind, Ockham reduced these\nto the ideas God has of individual objects in the act of creating\nthem. These ideas refer, in the first instance, to the creatures\nthemselves: the only reason for positing them is that when God creates\nhe knows what he is doing (Deus est rationabiliter operans)\n(Ockham Ord. I dist. 35, qu. 5). It follows, as Ockham\nwrites, that \nno universal … exists in any way outside the mind and anything\nthat can be predicated of many is by its nature in the mind either\npsychologically [subiective] or logically\n[obiective], and … no universal is of the essence or\nnature [de essentia seu quidditate] of any substance. (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2, qu. 8) \nThis means that the features that unite entities of a kind, which are\nexpressed in the general propositions of science, no longer have a metaphysical foundation. While this view is generally\ndescribed as “nominalist,” it is more accurately\ncharacterized as “conceptualist,” since the\n“names” to which universals were reduced were nomina\nmentalia (mental names), or (as we would say) concepts (Maurer\n1999: 63–64). But with this qualification in mind, we can\ncontinue to refer to it as “nominalist.” \nWhat implications does this have for the idea of the agent intellect?\nDespite his nominalism, Ockham continues to believe that there are\nreal similarities lying behind our classificatory schemes, rejecting\nthe idea that these are entirely matters of convention (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2 qu. 8). But although real similarities exist,\nthey are not expressions of common essences or natures. Coupled with\nthe idea that the mind has an immediate grasp of singular objects, it\nfollows that a special faculty was not longer required in order to\nabstract the universal from the particular. It was enough for the mind\nto be able to identify similarities among particular individuals.\n(Note that the status of these similarities then became a problem,\nwhich Ockham may never satisfactorily have resolved [Goddu 1984:\n92–93].) So it comes as no surprise to discover that Ockham\ndenies any real distinction between the agent intellect and the\npotential intellect. “The same intellect,” he writes,\nsimply “has different names” (Ockham Ord. I dist.\n3, qu. 6). Since there was now no distinctive task for the agent\nintellect to perform, Ockham could wield his famous razor to abandon\nthe idea that it represented a distinct power of the mind (Ockham\nRep. II qu. 20). \nThere is another dimension to the empiricism of this period, which is\na new emphasis on experience as a means of discovering causal\nrelations. Any Aristotelian, of course, would have agreed that we know\nof causal relations by means of experience. But what we find in the\nwork of Scotus and Ockham is a particular focus on this idea, coupled\nwith descriptions of how one may isolate particular causes. Historians\nhave long associated this with a renewed emphasis on God’s\nabsolute power and the idea that the order of the world depends\nentirely on his will, which makes that order radically contingent and\ndiscoverable only a posteriori (Foster 1934: 464–65;\nHenry 2009: 88). It is, however, difficult to find a contemporary\nexpression of this idea and it has recently been contested\n(Harrison 2002: 63–64). Nor should one overstate the degree of\nnovelty in the thought of Scotus and Ockham. Grosseteste had already\noutlined the idea of a controlled experiment (Lewis 2013: sect. 11),\nnoting that we can come to know that scammony (convulvulus\nscammonia) purges red bile by administering it “after all\nother causes purging red bile have been isolated and excluded”\n(Grosseteste In APo. 1.15; Crombie 1953: 74).\n\nIt is true,\nhowever, that more detailed accounts of how to isolate causal\nrelations are found only in the late thirteenth and fourteenth\ncenturies. Scotus outlined several such methods (Vos 2006:\n312–19), all of which involved separating out possible causes\nand testing them by seeing in which cases the effect follows. At one\npoint, for example, Scotus writes:  \nHow, from perceptible effects, does one arrive at knowledge of the\ncause? I respond, by dividing thus: in [a situation of type] A are\npresent [factors] B, C, D, if you wish to know which of D, B, or C is\na cause, consider the case where you find B without C. If then D\nfollows B and not C, then in [a situation of type] A, B is the cause\nof D. (Scotus In Met. I qu. 4)  \nOckham picks up on this idea. He does not deny that we can know of\nsome causes by simple reasoning, on the basis of self-evident or\nwell-established metaphysical principles. We can know, for instance,\nthat the will causes its own acts (Ockham Ord. I dist. 1, qu.\n3) or that there exists a first conserving cause of this world (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2, qu. 10]). But when it comes to the discovery\nof causes within the natural world, we must rely on observation. If a\ncausal agent is of a very specific kind (in Ockham’s terms,\nknown by way of its species specialissima), just one\nobservation will suffice. A single observation of a particular kind of\nherb curing a particular illness, for example, can safely be\ngeneralized. It can be generalized on the basis of the principle that\n“all agents of the most specific kind will bring about effects\nof the same nature” (Ockham Ord. I prol. qu. 2). If\nthe suspected cause is of a more generic kind, then many instances\nwill be needed (Ockham Ord. I prol. qu. 2). But in either\ncase, the process is thoroughly empirical: it involves the isolation\nof causal factors by way of experience. As Ockham writes, \nalthough I do not intend to make any general claim about the nature of\nimmediate [secondary] causes, I shall say what suffices for something\nto be an immediate cause, namely that when it is present there occurs\nthe effect, and when it is not present … the effect does not\noccur. And everything that has this character with respect to another\nis the cause of that other … That this is sufficient for one\nthing to be the cause of another, seems manifest. Because if not,\nthere remains no way of knowing something to be the cause of something\nelse. (Ockham Ord. I dist. 45, qu. 1) \nIt is tempting to see this as a reduction of the idea of causation to\nthat of the regular association of kinds of events. One could even\nargue that such a view would be a logical consequence of Ockham's\nnominalism (Klocker 1980: 351). But Ockham’s point here seems to\nbe epistemological, not metaphysical: this is how we discover a cause\n(Adams 1979: 23). It follows that the only kind of cause we can\ndiscover is that which produces a novel (and therefore observable)\neffect. Without such an effect, there would (once again) be no way of\nknowing something to be a cause (Ockham Sum. II 3). Coupled\nwith the effective abandonment of the idea of the agent intellect,\nthis brings us very close to a thoroughgoing cognitive empiricism. \nThose sympathetic to empiricism may be inclined to portray this\nhistory as a progress from darkness to light. But a moment’s\nreflection suggests it deserves a more cautious evaluation. These\nancient and medieval thinkers certainly laid the foundations on which\nearly modern and modern empiricists would build. But they also\nbequeathed a series of problems, some of which have never been\nsatisfactorily resolved. \nThere are, first of all, the problems faced by the Epicureans, who\nwere genetic but not explanatory empiricists, favouring the atomist\ntheory of Leucippus and Democritus. As Democritus seems to have\nrealized, while the atomist doctrine can be supported by observable\nfacts (such as the fact of motion), once formulated it seems to\nundercut a belief in the reliability of such observations. At the very\nleast, it suggests a distinction between what would later be called\n“primary” and “secondary” qualities, narrowing\nthe range of the kind of experiences to which natural philosophers\nwould appeal. \nThe Epicureans also seem to have come up against another enduring\nproblem: that of the underdetermination of theory by data. If the\nsenses cannot directly “bear witness” to the existence of\nwhat cannot be observed, being able only to bear witness against it,\nthere may be a number of apparently equally acceptable hypotheses\nabout the unobservable. One could argue, as Epicureans seem to have\ndone, that these should all be regarded as true, in the sense of being\nrealized somewhere and at some time. But this seems unsatisfactory\nwhen it comes to explaining particular events. \nMore broadly, there is the problem of just what experience can show.\nCan experience be a source of mathematical or logical knowledge? Can\nit reveal the causal relations that are traditionally regarded as the\ngoal of science? Aristotle, as we saw, seems to have held that the\nmind has the power of identifying the causal powers that belong to\nparticular kinds of entities. But it was never clear that experience\nalone could achieve such an insight. Medieval discussions of the\n“agent intellect” tended to regard it as an external\npower, or, at least, a human faculty that participates in a divine\nlight. Thinkers such as Henry of Ghent went further, embracing the\nAugustinian idea that an act of divine illumination is required on\neach occasion we attain such insights. Under the impact of\nAristotelian naturalism this idea was abandoned, but without (it must\nbe said) any clear alternative. \nLater empiricists could (and did) follow Ockham in denying that there\nare universals to be discovered; they professed to be undisturbed by\nthe fact that we cannot grasp the “real essences” of the\nobjects we perceive (Locke Essay 3.6.9). But the problems of\nempiricism did not go away. Even one of the empiricist’s\nfavorite ideas—the “covering law” account of\nscientific explanation—assumes we can arrive at true\ngeneralizations, propositions that apply to all members of a\nparticular class. But for those who take Ockham’s nominalism to\nits logical conclusion, a law of nature can be nothing more than a\ncontingently true proposition. Since the similarities that fix class\nmembership have no metaphysical grounding, not being based on a shared\nnature, we cannot know the truth of the law by any kind of rational\ninsight. The only way of testing such a proposition is by observation.\nIt is at this point that there arises the “problem of\ninduction,” first discussed by Sextus Empiricus and picked up by\nNicholas of Autrecourt. \nThe problems, however, go beyond that of induction. If laws of nature\nare to be distinguished from accidental generalizations, they must be\nthought to embody modal knowledge, particularly as this relates to\ncontrary-to-fact conditionals (Armstrong 1978: 274). Epicurus seems to\nhave somewhat naïvely believed that “in grasping the\nphenomena, we grasp how things can and must be” (Allen 2004:\n98). But it is far from clear how observation could lead to such\ninsights. If Epicurus was naïve in this respect, the same could\nbe said of many modern empiricists. \nThis article began with the observation that we should not approach\nancient thinkers in a “Whiggish” fashion; nor should we\nforce their thought into modern categories. But what this history\nshows is that there is no need to do so. Once we understand what these\nthinkers were saying, we can see that many of their questions remain\nwhat medievals called quaestiones disputatae, with which we\nare still grappling.","contact.mail":"gregory.dawes@otago.ac.nz","contact.domain":"otago.ac.nz"}]
