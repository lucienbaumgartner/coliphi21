It not only presents the backbone of Aristotle’s own\nphilosophical theorizing but has exerted an unparalleled influence on\nthe systems of many of the greatest philosophers in the western\ntradition. The set of doctrines in the Categories, which I\nwill henceforth call categorialism, provides the framework of\ninquiry for a wide variety of Aristotle’s philosophical\ninvestigations, ranging from his discussions of time and change in the\nPhysics to the science of being qua being in the\nMetaphysics, and even extending to his rejection of Platonic\nethics in the Nicomachean Ethics. Looking beyond his own\nworks, Aristotle’s categorialism has engaged the attention of such\ndiverse philosophers as Plotinus, Porphyry, Aquinas, Descartes,\nSpinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Brentano, and\nHeidegger (to mention just a few), who have variously embraced,\ndefended, modified or rejected its central contentions. All, in their\ndifferent ways, have thought it necessary to come to terms with\nfeatures of Aristotle’s categorial scheme.\n\n\nPlainly, the enterprise of categorialism inaugurated by Aristotle runs\ndeep in the philosophical psyche. Even so, despite its wide-reaching\ninfluence — and, indeed owing to that influence — any\nattempt to describe categorialism faces a significant difficulty:\nexperts disagree on many of its most important and fundamental\naspects. Each of the following questions has received markedly\ndifferent answers from highly respected scholars and philosophers.\nWhat do the categories classify? What theory of predication underlies\nAristotle’s scheme? What is the relationship between categorialism and\nhylemorphism, Aristotle’s other major ontological theory? Where does\nmatter fit, if at all, in the categorial scheme? When did Aristotle\nwrite the Categories? Did Aristotle write the\nCategories? Is the list of kinds in the Categories\nAristotle’s considered list, or does he modify his views elsewhere? Is\nAristotle’s view of substance in the Categories consistent\nwith his view of substance in the Metaphysics? Is there some\nmethod that Aristotle used in order to generate his list of\ncategories? Is Aristotle’s categorialism philosophically defensible in\nwhole or in part? If only in part, which part of categorialism is\nphilosophically defensible?\n\n\nGiven the divergence of expert opinion about even the most basic\naspects of Aristotle’s Categories, it is inevitable that an\nattempt to give a neutral account of the basic positions it contains\nwill be seen as wrong-headed, perhaps drastically so, by some scholars\nor other. One could attempt to address this problem by commenting on\nevery scholarly debate and opinion, but such a project would fail to\nbring to life the most striking features of Aristotelian\ncategorialism. In what follows, therefore, I shall take a different\nroute. I first present a natural, though perhaps overly simplified,\ninterpretation of the main structures in Aristotle’s categorial\nscheme, while pausing en route to note some especially\ncontroversial points. I then go on to discuss one important scholarly\nand philosophical debate about the categories, namely the question of\nwhether there is some systematic procedure by which Aristotle\ngenerated his famous list. The debate is of interest in large part\nbecause it concerns one of the most fundamental metaphysical topics:\nwhat is the correct system of categories? I am not ultimately\nconcerned to present the correct interpretation of\nAristotle’s Categories. Rather, I only hope to provide a\nuseful introduction to the content of this endlessly fascinating\nwork.\n\nThe Categories divides naturally into three distinct parts\n— what have come to be known as the Pre-Predicamenta\n(chs.1–4), the Predicamenta (chs. 5–9), and the\nPost-Predicamenta (chs. 10-15). (These section titles reflect\nthe traditional Latin title of the entire work, the\nPredicamenta.) In the Pre-Predicamenta, Aristotle\ndiscusses a number of semantic relations (1a1–16), gives a\ndivision of beings (τἃ ὄντα), into four\nkinds (1a20–1b9), and then presents his canonical list of ten\ncategories (1b25–2a4). In the Predicamenta, Aristotle\ndiscusses in detail the categories of substance (2a12–4b19),\nquantity (4b20–6a36), relatives (6a37–8b24), and quality\n(8b25–11a39), and provides a cursory treatment of the other\ncategories (11b1–14). And finally, in the\nPost-Predicamenta, he discusses a number of concepts relating\nto modes of opposition (11b15–14A25), priority and simultaneity\n(14a26–15a13), motion (15a14–15b17), and ends with a brief\ndiscussion of having (15b18–31). There is considerable debate\nabout whether Aristotle thought all three parts belong to a single\nwork, and if he did, why he thought they are all needed for the work\nto be a unified whole. There is nonetheless widespread agreement that\nat the very heart of the Categories are two systems of\nclassification, one given in the Pre-Predicamenta, and the\nother in the Predicamenta. \nAristotle’s first system of classification is of beings, (τὰ\nὄντα) (1a20). The division proceeds by way of two\nconcepts: (1) said-of and (2) present-in. Any being, according to\nAristotle, is either said-of another or is not said-of another.\nLikewise, any being is either present-in another or is not present-in\nanother. Because these are technical notions, one would expect\nAristotle to have defined them. Unfortunately, he does not define the\nsaid-of relation; and his definition of the present-in relation is\neither circular or rests on an undefined concept of being in. He says:\n‘By “present in a subject” I mean what is in\nsomething, not as a part, and cannot exist separately from what it is\nin’ (1a24–5). Notice that the word ‘in’ occurs\nin this definition of present-in. So, either ‘in’ means\nthe same as ‘present-in’, in which case the definition is\ncircular; or ‘in’ is itself in need of a definition, which\nAristotle does not give. Hence, Aristotle’s first system of\nclassification rests on technical concepts whose precise\ncharacterization is not settled by anything Aristotle says. \nDespite the lack of helpful definitions of these two concepts, there\nis a fairly straightforward, though certainly not uncontroversial,\ncharacterization of them that many scholars have adopted. By focusing\non Aristotle’s illustrations, most scholars conclude that beings that\nare said-of others are universals, while those that are not said-of\nothers are particulars. Beings that are present-in others are\naccidental, while those that are not present-in others are\nnon-accidental. Now, non-accidental beings that are universals are\nmost naturally described as essential, while non-accidental beings\nthat are particulars are best described simply as non-accidental. If\nwe put these possibilities together, we arrive at the following\nfour-fold system of classification: (1) accidental universals; (2)\nessential universals; (3) accidental particulars; (4) non-accidental\nparticulars, or what Aristotle calls primary substances. This\nsystem maps readily onto Aristotle’s own terminology, given at 1a20:\n(1) Said-of and present-in: accidental universals; (2) Said-of and not\npresent-in: essential universals; (3) Not said-of and present-in:\naccidental particulars; and (4) Not said-of and not present-in:\nprimary substances. A brief discussion of each of these classes should\nsuffice to bring out their general character. \nThe pride of place in this classificatory scheme, according to\nAristotle, goes to those entities that are neither said-of nor\npresent-in anything. Such entities, Aristotle says, are primary\nsubstances (2a11). Although he only gives a negative characterization\nof primary substances in the Categories — they are\nneither said-of nor present-in — the examples\nof them that he provides allow us to form a more robust conception of\nwhat a primary substance is supposed to be. His favorite examples are\nan individual man and a horse (1a20, 2a11). So, it is natural to\ninterpret him as thinking that among primary substances are concrete\nparticulars that are members of natural kinds. Whether in the\nCategories Aristotle intended to restrict the class of\nprimary substances to just members of natural kinds turns out to be\namong the more controversial topics in Aristotle scholarship. But at\nthe very least, he seems to think that members of natural kinds\npresent enough of a paradigmatic case that he can use them as\nexamples. \nNow, given the above interpretation of the said-of and present-in\nrelation, a primary substance is a particular that is non-accidental.\nIt must be admitted that it is difficult to say exactly what it means\nto say that a particular is non-accidental. In highlighting the fact\nthat primary substances are not the sorts of beings that can be\naccidents, Aristotle seems to be indicating both that they are not\npredicated of anything accidentally and that they are not entities\nthat are manifestly temporary, accidentally characterized, or\nartificially unified, such as Socrates-seated-in-a-chair. Similarly,\nby treating them as not said-of anything, Aristotle draws attention to\nthe fact that primary substances are not predicated of anything\neither. Rather, they are themselves essential unities, and indeed not\npredicable at all. Beyond these few remarks, however, it is difficult\nto say exactly, given only what is made explicit in the\nPre-predicamenta what a primary substance is. But this, one might\nargue, is appropriate for a metaphysically fundamental entity —\nwe can say of it what it is not, but because it is so basic, we lack\nthe vocabulary to say in an informative way what it is. And indeed,\nAristotle thinks that primary substances are fundamental in this way\nsince he thinks that all other entities bear some type of asymmetric\ndependence relation to primary substances (2a34–2b6). \nIf we continue to understand the said-of and present-in distinctions\nas I have characterized them, we will also find that Aristotle thinks\nthat in addition to particulars in the category of substance there are\naccidental, or what we can now call non-substantial,\nparticulars. Aristotle’s example of such an entity is an individual\npiece of grammatical knowledge (1a25). Perhaps a more intuitive\nexample is the particular whiteness that some object has. If there are\nnon-substantial particulars, then Socrates’ whiteness is a numerically\ndistinct particular from Plato’s whiteness. Contemporary\nmetaphysicians might call such entities tropes, and such a label is\nacceptable as long as one is careful not to expect Aristotle’s theory\nto resemble too much contemporary trope theories. In the first\ninstance, if Aristotle does accept the existence of non-substantial\nparticulars, he certainly does not think that they can exist apart\nfrom primary substances — indeed, it is most natural to\ninterpret Aristotle on this point as thinking that a non-substantial\nparticular is a dependent entity, individuated only by reference to\nprimary s substance that it is present in. Hence, Socrates’ whiteness\ncannot exist without Socrates. Moreover, thinking of such entities as\nstanding in a primitive relation of resemblance to one another is\nquite foreign to Aristotle’s way of thinking. Nonetheless, if the\npresent interpretation is correct, Aristotle did accept what are\nappropriately called particularized properties. \nReturning, then, to those beings that are not-present in other beings,\nAristotle thinks that in addition to primary substances, which are\nparticulars, there are secondary substances, which are universals\n(2a11-a18). His example of such an entity is man (1a21), which,\naccording to the present interpretation, is a universal in the\ncategory of substance. If we again accept the distinctions in question\nas I have drawn them, we should interpret secondary substances as\nessential characteristics of primary substances. Moreover, because\nprimary substances seem to be members of natural kinds, it is natural\nto interpret secondary substances as the kinds to which primary\nsubstances belong. If that is so, then Aristotle thinks that not only\nare primary substances members of natural kinds but that they are\nessentially characterized by the kinds to which they belong. \nFinally, a being is both said-of and present-in a primary substance if\nit is an accidental universal. Aristotle’s example of such an entity\nis knowledge; but again, whiteness provides a somewhat more intuitive\nexample. The universal whiteness is said-of many primary substances\nbut is only accidental to them. \nThe way in which I have characterized the concepts of said-of and\npresent-in is, as I have said, natural and relatively straightforward.\nMoreover, it was by far the orthodox interpretation amongst\nAristotle’s Medieval interpreters. I would be remiss, however, were I\nnot to mention the recent debate started by G.E.L. Owen about the\nsaid-of/present-in distinction (Owen, 1965a). According to Owen,\nAristotle did not accept the existence of non-substantial particulars.\nInstead, Owen argues, a being that is not said-of but present-in\nprimary substances is an accidental universal of the lowest possible\ngenerality. Hence, Owen denies that the said-of/not-said-of\ndistinction is one between universals and particulars. I shall not\ndiscuss Owen’s interpretation but shall simply note that it has\nspawned a huge deal of scholarly attention. The interested reader can\nfind a discussion of these issues here: \nAfter providing his first system of classification, Aristotle turns to\nthe predicamenta and presents a second, which ends up\noccupying him for much of the remainder of the Categories.\nAristotle divides what he calls ta legomena (τἃ\nλεγόμενα), i.e.\nthings that are said, into ten distinct kinds (1b25). Things\nthat are said according to Aristotle, are words (De Int\n16a3), and so it is natural to interpret his second system as a\nclassification of words. And because the English word\n‘category’ comes from the Greek word for\npredicate, one might naturally think of the second system as\na classification of distinct types of linguistic predicates. There is,\nhowever, considerable debate about the subject matter of the second\nsystem of classification. \nThere are three reasons to think that Aristotle is not primarily\ninterested in words but rather in the objects in the world to which\nwords correspond. First, his locution ta legomena is in fact\nambiguous, as between ‘things said’—where these\nmight or might not be words—and ‘things spoken\nof’—where these are more naturally taken to be things\nreferred to by means of words. Second, Aristotle’s examples of items\nbelonging to the various categories are generally extra-linguistic.\nFor instance, his examples of substances are an individual man and a\nhorse. Third, Aristotle explicitly accepts a doctrine of meaning\naccording to which words conventionally signify concepts, and concepts\nnaturally signify objects in the world (De Int 16a3). So,\neven if he is in some sense classifying words, it is natural to view\nhis classification as ultimately driven by concerns about objects in\nthe world to which our words correspond. \nThose scholars dissatisfied with the linguistic interpretation of\nAristotle’s second system of classification have moved in one of\nseveral directions. Some have interpreted Aristotle as classifying\nconcepts. The objections raised against the linguistic interpretation,\nhowever, can again be raised against the concept interpretation as\nwell. Other scholars have interpreted Aristotle as classifying\nextra-linguistic and extra-conceptual reality. Finally, some scholars\nhave synthesized the linguistic and extra-linguistic interpretations\nby interpreting Aristotle as classifying linguistic predicates in\nso far as they are related to the world in semantically\nsignificant ways. Although I think that this latter interpretation is\nprobably the one that best withstands close textual scrutiny, the\ngeneral character of the second system of classification is most\neasily seen by focusing on the extra-linguistic interpretation. So, in\nwhat follows, I shall simplify matters by talking as if Aristotle’s\nfirst classificatory system is really a classification of\nextra-linguistic items; and I shall note places at which such an\ninterpretation faces difficulties. \nWhat then is Aristotle’s second classificatory system? Quite simply,\nit is a list of the highest kinds, which are also known as\ncategories. That there are highest kinds (or perhaps that\nthere is one single highest kind) can be motivated by noticing the\nfact that the ordinary objects of our experience fall into classes of\nincreasing generality. Consider, for instance, a maple tree. It is in\nthe first instance a maple and so belongs in a class with all and only\nother maples. It is also, however, a tree and so belongs in a broader\nclass, namely the class of trees, whose extension is wider than the\nclass of maples. Continuing on, it is also a living thing and so\nbelongs in a class whose extension is wider still than the class of\ntrees. And so on. Now, once this basic pattern is before us, we can\nask the following question: does this increase in generality go on ad\ninfinitum or does it end at a class that is the most general possible?\nDoes it end, in other words, at a highest kind? \nIt might seem that the answer to this question is obvious: of course\nthere is a highest kind — being. After all, someone might argue,\neverything exists. So the class that contains all and only beings must\nbe the class with the greatest possible extension. In the\nMetaphysics, however, Aristotle argues that being is not a\ngenus (998b23, 1059b31). According to Aristotle, every genus must be\ndifferentiated by some differentia that falls outside that genus.\nHence, if being were a genus, it would have to be differentiated by a\ndifferentia that fell outside of it. In other words, being would have\nto be differentiated by some non-being, which, according to Aristotle,\nis a metaphysical absurdity. Although he does not explicitly make this\nclaim, Aristotle’s argument, if cogent, would generalize to any\nproposal for a single highest kind. Hence, he does not think that\nthere is one single highest kind. Instead, he thinks that there are\nten: (1) substance; (2) quantity; (3) quality; (4) relatives; (5)\nsomewhere; (6) sometime; (7) being in a position; (8) having; (9)\nacting; and (10) being acted upon (1b25–2a4). I shall discuss\nthe first four of these kinds in detail in a moment. But doing so will\ntake us into matters that, while interesting, nonetheless distract\nfrom the general nature of the scheme. So I will first discuss some of\nthe general structures inherent in Aristotle’s second system of\nclassification, and then proceed to a more detailed discussion. \nIn addition to positing ten highest kinds, Aristotle also has views\nabout the structure of such kinds. Each kind is differentiated into\nspecies by some set of differentiae. In fact, the essence of any\nspecies, according to Aristotle, consists in its genus and the\ndifferentia that together with that genus defines the species. (It is\nfor this reason that the highest kinds are, strictly speaking,\nindefinable — because there is no genus above a highest kind,\none cannot define it in terms of its genus and a differentia.) Some of\nthe species in various categories are also genera — they are, in\nother words, differentiated into further species. But at some point,\nthere is a lowest species that is not further differentiated. Under\nthese species, we can suppose, fall the particulars that belong to\nthat species. \nNow, if we accept the characterization of said-of and present-in that\nI have given, we can see that Aristotle’s two classificatory systems\ncan, so to speak, be laid on top of each other. The resulting\nstructure would look something like the following. \nSome features of this system are worth pointing out. First, as I have\nalready noted, Aristotle gives pride of place in this scheme to\nprimary substances. He says that were primary substances not to exist\nthen no other entity would exist (2b6). As a result, Aristotle’s\ncategorialism is firmly anti-Platonic. Whereas Plato treated the\nabstract as more real than material particulars, in the\nCategories Aristotle takes material particulars as\nontological bedrock — to the extent that being a primary\nsubstance makes something more real than anything else, entities such\nas Socrates and a horse are the most real entities in Aristotle’s\nworldview. Moreover, among secondary substances, those at a lower\nlevel of generality are what Aristotle calls ‘prior in\nsubstance’ than those at a higher level (2b7). So, for instance,\nhuman is prior in substance than body. Whether this is to be\ninterpreted in terms of the greater reality of the kind human\nis an open question. Nonetheless, Aristotle’s equating an increase in\ngenerality with a decrease in substantiality is at least in spirit\nstrongly anti-Platonic. \nThere is one other interesting general feature of this scheme that is\nworth pointing out before looking at its details. Aristotle’s\nrejection of the view that being is a genus and his subsequent\nacceptance of ten distinct highest kinds leads to a doctrine\nconcerning being itself that is at the center of Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics. (It should be noted, however, that there is\ngenuine disagreement over the extent to which Aristotle accepted the\ndoctrine of being that appears in the Metaphysics when he\nwrote the Categories.) According to Aristotle, some words do\nnot express a genus but instead are what he calls pros hen\nhomonyms — that is, homonyms related to one thing (pros\nhen), variously called cases of ‘focal meaning’ or\n‘focal connection’ or ‘core-dependent\nhomonymy’ in the literature on this topic (1003a35 ff.). Such\nwords are applicable to various items in the world in virtue of the\nfact that those items all bear some type of relation to some one thing\nor type of thing. An example of such a homonym, according to\nAristotle, is ‘healthy’. A regimen, he says, is healthy\nbecause it is productive of health; urine is healthy because it is\nindicative of health; and Socrates is healthy because he has health.\nIn this case, a regimen, urine, and Socrates are all called\n‘healthy’ not because they stand under some one genus,\nnamely healthy things, but instead because they all bear some relation\nto health. Similarly, according to Aristotle, things in the world are\nnot beings because they stand under some genus, being, but rather\nbecause they all stand in a relation to the primary being, which in\nthe Categories he says is substance. This explains in part\nwhy he says in the Metaphysics that in order to study being\none must study substance (1004a32, 1028a10–1028b8). \nIt must be admitted, I think, that when stated in the abstract there\nis a certain beauty about the structure of Aristotle’s two\nclassificatory schemes. Aristotle’s system, however, begins to look\nsomewhat awkward when his list of highest kinds is scrutinized. Some\nof the categories are natural, but others seem much less so. As a\nresult, philosophers have proposed changes to Aristotle’s list,\narguing that various categories should be eliminated, and scholars\nhave suggested that Aristotle’s categories are not merely the highest\nkinds but rather represent various complex relations between words and\ndifferent aspects of the world. A brief discussion of the first four\ncategories, which are the only ones that Aristotle discusses at\nlength, should bring out both the interest of Aristotle’s list as well\nas some of its peculiarities. \nThe most fundamental category is substance. We have already seen that\naccording to Aristotle substances divide into primary and secondary\nsubstances. Although Aristotle does not discuss the different kinds of\nsecondary substances in the Categories, various remarks he\nmakes throughout his corpus suggest that he would divide secondary\nsubstances into at least the following kinds (DA 412a17,\n413a21, 414a35, Meta. 1069a30, NE 1098a4): \nThis genus/species hierarchy is far from complete — Aristotle’s\nbiological treatises contain a remarkably rich taxonomy of animals\nthat is neither captured nor indeed obviously commensurate with the\ndivision into irrational and rational animals— but it does\nnicely illustrate the general structure of Aristotle’s categories. The\nlowest species in this taxonomy give way to kinds of increasing\ngenerality until the highest kind, substance is reached. Moreover,\nthere is something rather intuitive about the idea that members of\nnatural kinds are a fundamental type of entity in the world and hence\nthat there is a system of kinds of increasing generality to which each\nsuch entity belongs. Of course, someone might think that some kind\nstands above substance. But it is not clear what such a kind would be\nexcept being, or perhaps the even more general kind thing;\nand as I have already said, not only does Aristotle reject the idea\nthat being is a genus, but it is difficult to see what the relevant\nsense of thing is, if this is not simply another word for\nsubstance. \nThe second category Aristotle discusses in the Categories is\nquantity, and in the chapter devoted to quantity Aristotle actually\ndivides quantity into distinct species. In fact, he gives two\ndivisions; but for the sake of illustrating the general nature of the\ncategory, discussing the first division he gives should suffice.\nAccording to Aristotle, quantity divides into continuous and discrete\nquantities; continuous quantity divides into line, surface, body,\ntime, and place; and discrete quantity divides into number and speech\n(4b20–23). Hence, we have the following genus/species\nstructure: \nLike substance, quantity seems like a reasonable candidate for a\nhighest kind — quantities exist; quantities are not substances;\nsubstances are not quantities, and it is not clear what kind would\nstand above quantity. So, Aristotle’s decision to make quantity a\nhighest kind appears well motivated. Aristotle’s treatment of\nquantity, however, does raise some difficult questions. \nPerhaps the most interesting question concerns the fact that some of\nthe species in quantity appear to be quantified things rather than\nquantities themselves. Consider, for instance, body. In its most\nnatural sense, ‘body’ signifies bodies, which are not\nquantities but rather things with quantities. The same is true of\nline, surface, place, and arguably speech. Of course, there are\nquantities naturally associated with some of these species. For\ninstance, length, breadth, and depth are associated with line, body,\nand surface. But Aristotle does not list these as the species under\nquantity. So, in the first instance, we can ask: does Aristotle intend\nhis division of Quantity to be a division of quantities or quantified\nthings? \nThe difficulties involved in Aristotle’s list of species in the\ncategory of quantity can be made more precise by noting that in\nseveral places he seems to commit himself to the view that body is a\nspecies in the category of substance (Top. 130b2, DC\n2681–3, DA 434b12, Meta. 1079a31, 1069b38).\nAnd as I have drawn the genus-species structure in the category of\nsubstance above, body is one of the two species immediately under\nsubstance. Yet body also appears as a species under the species\nContinuous Quantity. The difficulty arises because Aristotle is\ncommitted to the view that no species can occur in both the category\nof substance and in some other category. For, he thinks that a species\nin substance is said-of primary substances while species in the other\ncategories are not said-of primary substances. Hence, any species in\nboth substance and some accidental category would be said-of and not\nsaid-of primary substance. Aristotle’s list of species in the Category\nof Quantity is thus not merely puzzling but seems to commit Aristotle\nto a contradiction. So, a second question about Aristotle’s category\nof quantity naturally suggests itself: how can body be a species in\nboth the category of quantity and the category of substance? (Studtman\n2002) \nA number of other questions about Quantity could be asked. For\ninstance, Aristotle’s treatment of quantity in the\nMetaphysics includes species not present in his treatment in\nthe Categories (Meta. 1020a7–34), which raises\nquestions as to the extent to which the set of doctrines in the\nCategories coheres with the doctrines in his other physical\nand metaphysical works. Furthermore, questions about Aristotle’s views\nabout the nature of some of the species in quantity arise. So, for\ninstance, to what does Aristotle think the species number corresponds?\nHe surely does not think that numbers exist apart from the material\nworld. But then what exactly does Aristotle think a number is? All we\nget for an answer from the Categories is that number is a\ndiscrete quantity. But such an answer hardly provides much of an\nunderstanding as to what Aristotle has precisely in mind. Moreover,\nwhy does Aristotle include speech as a species in the category of\nquantity? Speech hardly seems like a natural candidate for this\ncategory. Perhaps, Aristotle has in mind the quantities of vowels and\nsyllables of Greek words. But, if anything, speech would seem to be\nsome kind of vocal sound, which arguably is a kind of affection. Each\nof these questions is interesting and worth pursuing. I shall not,\nhowever, offer any answers to them here. Rather, I hope only to have\nillustrated how deeply intriguing and yet difficult to pin down fully\nAristotle’s Categories is. \nAfter quantity, Aristotle discusses the category of relatives, which\nboth interpretively and philosophically raises even more difficulties\nthan his discussion of quantity. A contemporary philosopher might\nnaturally think that this category contains what we would nowadays\ncall ‘relations’. But this would be a mistake. The name\nfor the category is ta pros ti (τὰ\nπρός τι), which literally means\n‘things toward something’. In other words, Aristotle seems\nto be classifying not relations but rather things in the world in so\nfar as they are toward something else. It would seem, however, that\nfor Aristotle things are toward something else insofar as a relational\npredicate applies to them. Aristotle says: Things are called\n‘relative’ if as such they are said to be of\nsomething else or to be somehow referred to something else. So, for\ninstance, the greater, as such, is said to be of something\nelse, for it is said to be greater than something (6a36). \nPerhaps the most straightforward reading of Aristotle’s discussion is\nthe following. He noticed that certain predicates in language are\nlogically incomplete — they are not used in simple\nsubject/predicate sentences of the form ‘a is\nF’ but rather require some type of completion. To say\n‘three is greater’ is to say something that is incomplete\n— to complete it requires saying what three is greater than.\nNonetheless, Aristotle accepted a doctrine according to which\nproperties in the world always inhere in a single subject. In other\nwords, although Aristotle countenanced relational predicates, and\nthough he certainly thought that objects in the world are related to\nother objects, he did not accept relations as a genuine type of\nentity. So, Aristotle’s category of relatives is a kind of halfway\nhouse between the linguistic side of relations, namely relational\npredicates, and the ontological side, namely relations themselves. \nFor our purposes, we need not determine how to best interpret\nAristotle’s theory of relatives, but can rather consider some issues\nthat Aristotle’s discussion raises. First, anyone who is comfortable\nwith relational properties will no doubt find Aristotle’s discussion\nsomewhat confused. Although Aristotle does discuss important features\nof relational predicates, for instance, that relational predicates\ninvolve a kind of reciprocal reference (6b28), his fundamental stance,\naccording to which all properties in the world are non-relational,\nwill appear wrongheaded. Second, Aristotle’s category of relatives\nraises interpretive issues, in particular the issue concerning what\nexactly his categorical scheme is meant to classify. As in the case of\nquantity, Aristotle seems to be focusing on things that are related\nrather than relations themselves. Indeed, this is evident from the\nname of the category. \nThis latter fact, namely that in his discussion of relatives Aristotle\nseems focused on related things rather than relations, places pressure\non the easy characterization of the categories that I discussed\npreviously, namely that each category is a distinct type of\nextra-linguistic entity. If that easy characterization were correct,\nAristotle should have countenanced some type of entity corresponding\nto relatives as a highest kind. But he did not. Hence, it is tempting\nto shift to an interpretation according to which Aristotle is after\nall focused on linguistically characterized items. And perhaps he\nthinks that the world contains just a few basic types of entity and\nthat different types of predicates apply to the world in virtue of\ncomplex semantic relations to just those types of entity. As it turns\nout, many commentators have interpreted him in this way. But their\ninterpretations face their own difficulties. To raise just one, we can\nask: what are the basic entities in the world if not just those that\nfall under the various categories? Perhaps there is a way to answer\nthis question on Aristotle’s behalf, but the answer is not clearly\ncontained in his texts. So again we are once again forced to admit\njust how difficult it is to pin down a precise interpretation of\nAristotle’s work. \nAfter relatives, Aristotle discusses the category of quality. Unlike\nquantity and relatives, quality does not present any obvious\ndifficulties for the interpretation according to which the\nCategories classify basic types of entity. Aristotle divides\nquality as follows (8b26–10a11): \nEach of these species looks like an extra-linguistic type of entity,\nand none of the species appears to be a species in another category.\nHence, any difficulties with Aristotle’s treatment of quality concern\nthe appropriateness of the divisions he makes rather than the extent\nto which the category fits into a larger interpretation of the\ncategorial scheme. But, as with just about everything in Aristotle’s\nscheme, the divisions he makes among qualities have been severely\ncriticized. J.L. Ackrill, for instance, criticizes Aristotle as\nfollows: \nAckrill finds Aristotle’s division of quality at best unmotivated. And\nAckrill, it would seem, is being polite. Montgomery Furth has said:\n‘I shall largely dispense with questions like…the\nrationale (if there be one) for comprehending into a single category\nthe monstrous motley horde yclept Quality…’ (Furth\n1988). \nIt must be admitted, that Aristotle’s list of the species in quality\nis at first blush a bit odd. For instance, why should we consider any\nof the species listed as falling directly under quality? Indeed, when\nAristotle lists the species, he does not follow his usual procedure\nand provide the differentiae that distinguish them. If there are such\ndifferentiae, we should expect that habits and dispositions, for\ninstance, can be defined as such and such a quality. The same would of\ncourse be true for the other qualities. But not only does Aristotle\nnot provide these differentiae, but it is also difficult to see what\nthey might be. To appreciate the difficulty, one need only ask: what\ndifferentia can be added to quality so as to define shape? \nTo be fair, Aristotle’s category of quality has had its defenders. In\nfact, some of those defenders have gone so far as to provide something\nof a deduction of the species in the category from various\nmetaphysical principles. Aquinas, for instance, says the following\nabout the category in his Summa Theologiae: \nNow the mode of determination of the subject to accidental being may\nbe taken in regard to the very nature of the subject, or in regard to\naction, and passion resulting from its natural principles, which are\nmatter and form; or again in regard to quantity. If we take the mode\nor determination of the subject in regard to quantity, we shall then\nhave the fourth species of quality. And because quantity, considered\nin itself, is devoid of movement, and does not imply the notion of\ngood or evil, so it does not concern the fourth species of quality\nwhether a thing be well or ill disposed, nor quickly or slowly\ntransitory. \nBut the mode of determination of the subject, in regard to action or\npassion, is considered in the second and third species of quality. And\ntherefore in both, we take into account whether a thing be done with\nease or difficulty; whether it be transitory or lasting. But in them,\nwe do not consider anything pertaining to the notion of good or evil:\nbecause movements and passions have not the aspect of an end, whereas\ngood and evil are said in respect of an end. \nOn the other hand, the mode or determination of the subject, in regard\nto the nature of the thing, belongs to the first species of quality,\nwhich is habit and disposition: for the Philosopher says\n(Phys. vii, text. 17), when speaking of habits of the soul\nand of the body, that they are “dispositions of the perfect to\nthe best; and by perfect I mean that which is disposed in accordance\nwith its nature.” And since the form itself and the nature of a\nthing is the end and the cause why a thing is made (Phys. ii,\ntext. 25), therefore in the first species we consider both evil and\ngood, and also changeableness, whether easy or difficult; inasmuch as\na certain nature is the end of generation and movement. (Aquinas,\nSumma Theologica, Part I-II, Q. 49, Art. 2) \nAquinas seems to see the species in the category of quality as\nunfolding systematically from some basic metaphysical principles.\nWhether Aquinas’s derivation of the species in the category of quality\nis plausible or whether some other derivation that stems from\nAristotelian principles can be given has become the subject of recent\nscholarship (Kahm 2016, Studtmann 2003a). Although the issue may seem\na local one pertaining only to Aristotle’s category of quality, it is\nin fact relevant to the larger issue, which I will discuss shortly, of\nAristotle’s method of deriving the categories generally. A systematic\nderivation of Aristotle’s category of quality would give credence to\nthe claim that Aristotle’s categorial scheme as a whole admits of some\nkind of systematic derivation. \nIt may seem odd to quote Aquinas at such length in an essay devoted to\nAristotle’s categories, but I have done so for two reasons. First, as\nAckrill’s and Furth’s comments illustrate, Aristotle’s scheme has been\nseverely criticized by scholars and philosophers alike. Aquinas’s\ncomments about quality, however, show that in the hands of a truly\ntalented interpreter — and there certainly has been no\ninterpreter of Aristotle greater than Aquinas — many of the\ncriticisms can be met. Second, and more importantly, the attention\nthat Aquinas gives to the category of quality is indicative of one of\nthe most important facts about Aristotle’s categories, namely its\nprofound historical importance in the development of metaphysical\nspeculation. Whether philosophers have agreed or disagreed with\nAristotle’s categorial scheme, his categorialism has played a\nsignificant instrumental role — it has provided in the millennia\nsince its appearance the starting point for a great deal of\nmetaphysical inquiry. In this respect, it can be compared to the\nquantifier in Twentieth-century metaphysics. Whether or not the\nquantifier is of philosophical interest, it is hard to imagine\ntwentieth-century analytical metaphysics without it. So, to the extent\nthat interest in the history of philosophy lies in the way in which\nideas have had an influence from generation to generation, Aristotle’s\ncategorial scheme is worth studying not only for the doctrines it\ncontains but also for the interest that other philosophers have taken\nin it and the philosophy that they produced by using it as a\nspringboard. (See the entry on\n Commentators on Aristotle.) \nIt is a tradition that scholars are increasingly attending to. Much of\nthe recent scholarship concerning Aristotle’s Categories has\neither been translations of commentaries or discussions that stem from\nthem. \nAfter quality, Aristotle’s discussion of individual categories becomes\nvery sparse. He devotes a few comments to the categories of action and\npassion (11b1) and then has a brief discussion of one of the odder\ncategories, having, at the end of the work (15b17–35). \nThe bulk of the remaining discussion, which is known as the\nPost-Predicamenta, is directed at concepts involving some\nkind of opposition, the concepts of priority, posteriorty,\nsimultaneity, and change. Although the latter part of the\nCategories is interesting, it is not clear that it is\nintegral to either of Aristotle’s classificatory schemes. Moreover,\nhis discussion there is largely superseded by his discussion of the\nsame concepts in the Metaphysics. Hence, instead of\ndiscussing the Post-Predicamenta in detail, I shall at this\npoint turn to a topic about Aristotle’s categories that is of\nfundamental philosophical and interpretive interest: how did Aristotle\narrive at his list of categories? \nThe issue concerning the origin of the categories can be raised by\nasking the most difficult question there is about any philosophical\nposition: why think that it is correct? Why, in other words, should we\nthink that Aristotle’s list of highest kinds contains all and only the\nhighest kinds there are? \nOne might, of course, reject the idea that there are some\nmetaphysically privileged kinds in the world. But here it is important\nto distinguish between internal and external questions concerning a\nsystem of categories. We can approach category theory externally in\nwhich case we would ask questions about the status of any system of\ncategories. So, for instance, we could ask whether any system of\ncategories must exhibit some kind of dependency on the mind, language,\nconceptual schemes, or whatever. Realists will answer this question in\nthe negative, and idealists of one stripe or another in the\naffirmative. In addition, we can ask about our epistemic access to the\nultimate categories in the world. And we can adopt positions ranging\nfrom a radical skepticism about our access to categories to a kind of\ninfallibilism about such access. \nIf, on the other hand, we approach category theory from an internal\nperspective, we will assume some answer to the external questions and\nthen go on to ask about the correctness of the system of categories\nunder those assumptions. So, for instance, we might adopt a realist\nperspective and hence assume that there is some correct metaphysically\nprivileged list of mind and language independent highest kinds as well\nas a correct account of the relations between them. And we can then\ntry to determine what that list is. Now, Aristotle certainly belongs\nto this latter tradition of speculation about categories: he assumes\nrather than defends a posture of realism with respect to the\nmetaphysical structures in the world. It is thus appropriate to assume\nrealism along with him and then inquire into the question of which\ncategories there might be. \nOne way of approaching this question is to ask whether there is some\nprincipled procedure by which Aristotle generated his list of\ncategories. For, if there is, then one could presumably assess his\nlist of highest kinds by assessing the procedure by which he generated\nit. Unfortunately, with the exception of some suggestive remarks in\nthe Topics, Aristotle does not indicate how he generated his\nscheme. Without some procedure by which one can generate his list,\nhowever, Aristotle’s categories arguably lack any justification. The\nissue is, of course, complicated by the fact that his list might be\njustified without some procedure to generate it — perhaps we can\nuse a combination of metaphysical intuition and philosophical\nargumentation to convince ourselves that Aristotle’s list is complete.\nNonetheless, without some procedure of generation Aristotle’s\ncategories at least appear in an uneasy light. And as a matter of\nhistorical fact, the lack of any justification for his list of highest\nkinds has been the source of some famous criticisms. Kant, for\ninstance, just prior to the articulation of his own categorial scheme,\nsays: \nAccording to Kant, Aristotle’s list of categories was the result of an\nunsystematic, albeit a brilliant, bit of philosophical brainstorming.\nHence, it cannot stand firm as a correct set of categories. \nAs it turns out, although Kant did not know of any procedure by which\nAristotle might have generated his list of categories, scholars have\ngiven a number of proposals. The proposals can be classified into four\ntypes, which I shall call: (1) The Question Approach; (2)\nThe Grammatical Approach; (3) The Modal Approach;\n(4) The Medieval Derivational Approach. \nJ.L. Ackrill (1963) is the most prominent defender of the Question\nApproach. He takes as evidence for his interpretation Aristotle’s\nremarks in Topics I 9. Ackrill claims that there are two\ndifferent ways to generate the categories, each of which involves\nasking questions. According to the first method, we are to ask a\nsingle question — what is it? — of as many things as we\ncan. So, for instance, we can ask of Socrates, what is Socrates? And\nwe can answer — Socrates is a human. We can then direct the same\nquestion to the answer we have given: what is a human? And we can\nanswer: a human is an animal. Eventually, this process of question\nasking will lead us to some highest kind, in this case, Substance. If,\non the other hand, we had begun asking that same question of Socrates’\ncolor, say his whiteness, we would eventually have ended at the\nhighest kind quality. When carried out completely, Ackrill claims,\nthis procedure will yield the ten distinct and irreducible kinds that\nare Aristotle’s categories. According to the second method of\nquestioning, we are to ask as many different questions as we can about\na single primary substance. So, for instance, we might ask — how\ntall is Socrates? Where is Socrates? What is Socrates? And in\nanswering these questions, we will respond five feet, in the Agora,\nHuman. We will then realize that our answers to our various questions\ngroup into ten irreducible kinds. \nOf all the proposals that scholars have given, Ackrill’s is the most\nsupported by Aristotle’s texts, though the evidence he cites is far\nfrom conclusive. But from a philosophical point of view, the question\nmethod suffers from some serious problems. First, it is far from clear\nthat either method actually produces Aristotle’s list. Suppose, for\ninstance, I employ the second method and ask: does Socrates like\nPlato? The answer, let us grant, is ‘yes’. But where does\nthat answer belong in the categorical scheme? Ackrill might respond by\nforcing the question to be one that is not answered with\n‘yes’ or ‘no’. But we can still ask the\nquestion: is Socrates present-in or not present-in something else? The\nanswer, of course, is: not present-in; but where in Aristotle’s list\nof categories does not present-in belong? It is indeed hard to see.\nSimilar problems face the first method. Suppose I were to ask: what is\nSocrates’ whiteness? I might respond by saying ‘a\nparticular’. Again, where does being a particular belong in\nAristotle’s list of categories. Of course, particulars are part of the\nfour-fold system of classification that Aristotle articulates. But we\nare not at the moment concerned with that scheme. Indeed, to advert to\nthat scheme in the present context is simply to re-open the question\nof the relations between the two main systems of classification in the\nCategories. \nEven if Ackrill can find some plausible route from questions to\nAristotle’s categories, the methods he proposes still seem\nunsatisfactory for the simple reason that they depend far too much on\nour question-asking inclinations. It may be that the questions that we\nin fact ask will yield Aristotle’s categories, but what we should want\nto know is whether we are asking the right questions. Unless we can be\nconfident that our questions are tracking the metaphysical structures\nof the world, we should be unimpressed by the fact that they yield any\nset of categories. But to know whether our questions are tracking the\nmetaphysical structures of the world requires us to have some way of\nestablishing the correctness of the categorial scheme. Clearly, at\nthis point, we are in a circle that is too small to be of much help.\nMaybe all metaphysical theorizing is at some level laden with\ncircularity, but circles this small are generally unacceptable to a\nmetaphysician. \nAccording to the grammatical approach, which traces to Trendelenburg\n(1846) and has most recently been defended by Michael Baumer (1993),\nAristotle generated his list by paying attention to the structures\ninherent in language. On the assumption that the metaphysical\nstructure of the world mirrors the structures in language, we should\nbe able to find the basic metaphysical structures by examining our\nlanguage. This approach is quite involved but for our purposes can be\nillustrated with a few examples. The distinction between substance and\nthe rest of the categories, for instance, is built into the\nsubject-predicate structure of our language. Consider, for instance,\nthe two sentences: (1) Socrates is a human; and (2) Socrates is white.\nFirst, we see that each sentence has a subject, namely\n‘Socrates’. Corresponding to that subject, one might\nthink, is an entity of some kind, namely a primary substance.\nMoreover, the first sentence contains what might be called an\nindividuating predicate — it is a predicate of the form,\na such and such, rather than of the form, such and such. So,\none might think, there are predicates that attribute to primary\nsubstances properties the having of which suffices for that substance\nto be an individual of some kind. On the other hand, the second\nsentence contains a non-individuating predicate. So by examining the\ndetails of the predicates in our language, we have some grounds for\ndistinguishing between the category of substance and the accidental\ncategories. \nThe grammatical approach certainly does have some virtues. First, we\nhave ample evidence that Aristotle was sensitive to language and the\nstructures inherent in it. So it would not be all that surprising were\nhe led by his sensitivity to linguistic structures to his list of\ncategories. Moreover, some of the peculiarities of his list are nicely\nexplained in this way. Two of the highest kinds are action and\npassion. In Physics III 3, however, Aristotle argues that in\nthe world there is only motion and that the distinction between action\nand passion lies in the way in which one is considering the motion. So\nwhy should there be two distinct categories, namely action, and\npassion, rather than just one, namely motion? Well, the grammatical\napproach offers an explanation: in language, we differentiate between\nactive and passive verbs. Hence, there are two distinct categories,\nnot just one. \nDespite these virtues, the grammatical approach faces a difficult\nquestion: why think that the structures we find in language reflect\nthe metaphysical structures of the world? For instance, it may simply\nbe a historical accident that our language contains individuating and\nnon-individuating predicates. Likewise, it may be a historical\naccident that there are active and passive verbs in our language. Of\ncourse, this type of objection, when pushed to its limits, leads to\none of the more difficult philosophical questions, namely how can we\nbe sure that the structures of our representations are in any way\nrelated to what some might call the basic metaphysical structures and\nto what others might call the things in themselves? But one might hold\nout hope that some justification for a categorial scheme could be\ngiven that did not rest entirely on the unjustified assertion of some\ndeep correspondence between linguistic and metaphysical\nstructures. \nThe Modal Approach, which traces to Bonitz (1853) and has most\nrecently been defended by Julius Moravscik (1967), avoids the defects\nof both the previous two approaches. As Moravscik formulates this\nview, the categories are those types of entities to which any sensible\nparticular must be related. He says: \nIn virtue of its explicitly modal nature, the Modal Approach avoids\nthe defects of the previous two approaches. Whereas the first two\napproaches ultimately rely on some connection between metaphysical\nstructures and what appear to be merely contingent features of either\nour question asking proclivities or the structures inherent in our\nlanguage, the Modal Approach eliminates contingency altogether. \nDespite its explicitly modal character, the Modal Approach does face a\ndifficulty similar to the one faced by the Question Approach. It might\nturn out that employing the approach yields exactly the list of\nAristotle’s categories, but then again it might not. So, for instance,\nevery material particular must be related to a particular. But there\nis no category of particulars. There are, of course, beings that are\nnot said-of other beings. But not being said-of is not one of\nAristotle’s categories. Moreover, must not every material particular\nbe related to matter? But matter is not a highest kind. Indeed, it is\nfar from clear where matter belongs in the categories. So, even if the\nModal Approach is a good one for generating some list of kinds, it is\nnot obvious that it is a good approach for generating Aristotle’s list\nof kinds. This problem could of course be alleviated somewhat if\ninstead of merely appealing to modal structures as such, one could\nappeal to modal structures that arguably Aristotle would have thought\nare part of the very fabric of the world. Then one would at least have\nan explanation as to why Aristotle derived the list he in fact\nderived, even if one is inclined to reject Aristotle’s list. \nThe last approach to the categories, namely the Medieval derivational\napproach, goes some way in the direction suggested but not taken by\nMoravscik’s Modal Approach. There is a rich tradition of commentators\nincluding Radulphus Brito, Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and most\nrecently their modern heir Franz Brentano, who provide precisely the\nkind of derivation for Aristotle’s categorial scheme found wanting by\nKant. According to the commentators in this tradition, Aristotle’s\nhighest kinds are capable of a systematic and arguably entirely a\npriori derivation. The following quotation from Brentano captures\nnicely the philosophical import of such derivations. \nBrentano’s enthusiasm about the possibility of deriving Aristotle’s\ncategories is perhaps unjustified, but the idea that an a\npriori proof of the completeness of Aristotle’s categories is\ncertainly an intriguing one. \nPerhaps the best representative of this type of interpretation occurs\nin Aquinas’s commentaries on Aristotle’s Metaphysics. All of\nAquinas’s derivation deserves considerable attention, but for our\npurposes, it will suffice to quote just a portion of it so as to bring\nout its general character as well as one of its more interesting\naspects. \nThis passage illustrates the tenor of the Medieval derivational\napproach. Aquinas articulates what appear to be principled\nmetaphysical principles concerning the way in which a predicate can\nbe, in his words, ‘taken as being in a subject’. There are\ntwo such ways: (1) essentially and absolutely; or (2) essentially and\nnot absolutely but with reference to something else. The latter way\ncorresponds to the category of relatives; the former, to the\ncategories of quality and quantity. Aquinas then divides the former\nway of being in a subject in terms of form and matter. He claims,\nstrikingly, that the category of quality flows from form and\nthat the category of quantity flows from matter. \nInspecting all of Aquinas’s derivation to determine its cogency is far\ntoo large a project to undertake here. I have quoted the portion above\nto show the way in which the Medieval derivational approach augments\nin an interesting way Moravscik’s Modal Approach. The Modal Approach,\nI argued, would gain some plausibility if there were some way of\nseeing Aristotle’s own attitudes about the modal structures in the\nmaterial world somehow determining the generation of the categories.\nBy invoking a combination of a priori sounding semantic\nprinciples and theses about the relationship between form and quality\nand matter and quantity, Aquinas has gone some way toward doing this.\nAristotle is certainly committed to the claim that form and matter are\ntwo of the absolutely fundamental aspects of the material world.\nIndeed, he argues in the Physics that form and matter are\nnecessary for the existence of motion, which, he thinks, essentially\ncharacterizes bodies. \nIf the Medieval Derivational Approach is correct, Aristotle’s\ncategories ultimately trace to the ways in which form, matter, and\nperhaps motion relate to substances and the predicates that apply to\nthem. Whether the derivations can withstand philosophical scrutiny is\nof course an important question, one that I will not pursue here,\nthough I will say that Brentano was probably a bit too enthusiastic\nabout the prospects for an entirely satisfactory a priori\nproof of the completeness of Aristotle’s categories. Moreover, the\nMedieval interpretations face the charge that they are an\nover-interpretation of Aristotle. Aristotle simply does not provide in\nhis surviving writings the sort of conceptual connections that\nunderlie the Medieval derivations. So perhaps the Medievals have\nsuccumbed to the temptation to read into Aristotle’s system\nconnections that Aristotle did not accept. Indeed, from a\ntwentieth-century perspective, the Medieval derivations look very\nstrange. It is commonplace in contemporary Aristotle scholarship to\nview the Categories as an early work and to think that\nAristotle had not developed his theory of form and matter until later\nin his career. If this general approach is correct, the claim that the\ncategorial scheme can somehow be derived at least in part from form\nand matter appears implausible. \nAs should be clear from this brief discussion, providing a complete\nderivation of Aristotle’s categorical scheme would be a difficult,\nindeed perhaps impossible, task. After all, someone might conclude\nthat Aristotle’s categorial scheme was either in part or in whole\nmistaken. Minimally, the task is a daunting one. But of course, the\ndifficulty in establishing its ultimate correctness is not peculiar to\nAristotle’s categorial scheme. Indeed, it should not be at all\nsurprising that the difficulties that have beset metaphysical\nspeculation in the Western tradition can be seen in such a stark and\nprovocative fashion in one of the great founding works of that very\ntradition. In fact, it is in part due to such difficulties that\nexternal questions about categorial and other metaphysical structures\narise. Such difficulties understandably lead to questions about the\nlegitimacy of category theory and metaphysical speculation in general.\nUnfortunately, the history of metaphysical speculation has shown that\nit is no less difficult to establish answers to external than to\ninternal questions about category theory. That acknowledged it is\nnoteworthy that questions of both sorts owe their first formulations,\nultimately, to the categorialism of Aristotle’s seminal work, the\nCategories. \nTwo trends in recent philosophical scholarship are of special note.\nThese engage Aristotle’s categorialism in different ways. The first\nconsiders it directly, as a topic of investigation in its own right;\nsee Shields (ed.) 2012. The second treats it more indirectly, either\nby considering issues in Aristotle’s philosophy on which his\ncategorialism bears or, more generally, by advancing the tradition his\ncategorialism inaugurated; see Haaparanta and Koskinen (eds.)\n2012. \nIn Shields (ed.) 2012, we find an argument that Aristotle’s\ncategorialism and his hylomorphism can be systematically unified\n(Studtmann 2012). The role of the famous phrase—Being Qua\nBeing—in Aristotle’s thought is thoroughly examined, first\nby way of the many criticisms of Aristotle’s views and second by\nway of interpretation of Aristotle’s famous slogan that can\nwithstand philosophical scrutiny (Shields 2012). The ontology of the\nCategories is examined with a critical lens sharpened by a number of\ncontemporary debates (Loux 2012a). \nHaaparanta and Koskinen (eds.) 2012 begins with Michael Loux’s\n(2012b) examination of a thesis that structures Aristotle’s\ncategorialism, namely that being is said in many ways (pollachôs\nlegomenon). Many commentators have thought such a thesis to be deeply\nproblematic. Loux agrees in part with such a sentiment, arguing that\nthe thesis makes univocal but transcategorial reference impossible,\nthereby rendering a statement of the thesis that being is said in many\nways impossible as well. Loux, however, finds a way to salvage the\nAristotelian thesis by denying the claim that it is about the meaning\nor sense of universal terms. The volume continues with discussions\nthat become increasingly remote in time but which therefore show the\nlasting influence of his categorialism. Kukkonen (2012), Knuttilla\n(2012), and Normore (2012) discuss in separate essays the influence\nAristotle’s categories on aspects of Medieval philosophy. And by\nthe latter part of the volume, the essays begin to focus on other\nphilosophers, e.g., Hegel, Pierce, Bolzano, and Meinong, each of whom\navowedly manifests a clear and deep debt to Aristotle and his\ncategorialism. \n ","contact.mail":"pastudtmann@davidson.edu","contact.domain":"davidson.edu"}]
