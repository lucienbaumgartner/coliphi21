Insofar as the concept of power is central to each of\nthese theoretical tasks, power is clearly a central concept for\nfeminist theory as well. And yet, curiously, it is one that is not\noften explicitly discussed in feminist work (exceptions include Allen\n1998, 1999, Caputi 2013, Hartsock 1983 and 1996, Yeatmann 1997, and\nYoung 1992). This poses a challenge for assessing feminist\nperspectives on power, as those perspectives must first be\nreconstructed from discussions of other topics. Nevertheless, it is\npossible to identify three main ways in which feminists have\nconceptualized power: as a resource to be (re)distributed, as\ndomination, and as empowerment. After a brief discussion of\ntheoretical debates amongst social and political theorists over how to\ndefine the concept of power, this entry will survey each of these\nfeminist conceptions.\n\nIn social and political theory, power is often regarded as an\nessentially contested concept (see Lukes 1974 and 2005, and Connolly\n1983). Although this claim is itself contested (see Haugaard 2010;\nMorriss 2002, 199–206 and Wartenberg 1990, 12–17), there\nis no doubt that the literature on power is marked by deep,\nwidespread, and seemingly intractable disagreements over how the term\npower should be understood. \nOne such disagreement pits those who define power as getting someone\nelse to do what you want them to do, that is, as an exercise of\npower-over, against those who define it as an ability or a capacity to\nact, that is, as a power-to do something. The classic formulation of\nthe former definition is offered by Max Weber, who defines power as\n“the probability that one actor within a social relationship\nwill be in a position to carry out his own will despite\nresistance…” (1978, 53). Similarly, Robert Dahl offers\nwhat he calls an “intuitive idea of power” according to\nwhich “A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do\nsomething that B would not otherwise do” (1957, 202–03).\nDahl’s definition sparked a vigorous debate that continued until the\nmid-1970s, but even Dahl’s best-known critics seemed to agree with his\nbasic definition of power as an exercise of power-over (see Bachrach\nand Baratz 1962 and Lukes 1974). As Steven Lukes notes, Dahl’s\none-dimensional view of power, Bachrach and Baratz’s two-dimensional\nview, and his own three-dimensional view are all variations of\n“the same underlying conception of power, according to which A\nexercises power over B when A affects B in a manner contrary to B’s\ninterests” (1974, 30). Similarly, but from a very different\ntheoretical background, Michel Foucault’s highly influential analysis\npresupposes that power is a kind of power-over; and he puts it,\n“if we speak of the structures or the mechanisms of power, it is\nonly insofar as we suppose that certain persons exercise power over\nothers” (1983, 217). Notice that there are two salient features\nof this definition of power: power is understood in terms of\npower-over relations, and it is defined in terms of its actual\nexercise. \nClassic articulations of the latter definition of power (as power-to)\nare offered by Thomas Hobbes — power is a person’s\n“present means…to obtain some future apparent Good”\n(Hobbes 1985 (1641), 150) — and Hannah Arendt — power is\n“the human ability not just to act but to act in concert”\n(1970, 44). Arguing in favor of this way of conceptualizing power,\nHanna Pitkin notes that power is related etymologically to the French\nword pouvoir and the Latin potere, both of which mean to be able.\n“That suggests,” she writes, “that power is a\nsomething — anything — which makes or renders somebody\nable to do, capable of doing something. Power is capacity, potential,\nability, or wherewithal” (1972, 276). Similarly, Peter Morriss\n(2002) and Lukes (2005) define power as a dispositional concept,\nmeaning, as Lukes puts it, that power “is a potentiality, not an\nactuality — indeed a potentiality that may never be\nactualized” (2005, 69). (This statement amounts to a significant\nrevision of Lukes’s earlier analysis of power, in which he argued\nagainst defining power as power-to on the grounds that such a\ndefinition obscures “the conflictual aspect of power — the\nfact that it is exercised over people” and thus fails to address\nwhat we care about most when we decide to study power (1974, 31). For\nhelpful discussion of whether Lukes’s recent embrace of the\ndispositional conception of power is compatible with his other\ntheoretical commitments, see Haugaard (2010)). Some of the theorists\nwho analyze power as power-to leave power-over entirely out of their\nanalysis. For example, Arendt distinguishes power sharply from\nauthority, strength, force, and violence, and offers a normative\naccount in which power is understood as an end in itself (1970). As\nJürgen Habermas has argued, this has the effect of screening any\nand all strategic understandings of power (where power is understood\nin the Weberian sense as imposing one’s will on another) out of her\nanalysis (Habermas 1994). (Although Arendt defines power as a\ncapacity, she also maintains that “power springs up between men\nwhen they act together and vanishes the moment they disperse”\n(1958, 200); hence, it is not clear whether she fully accepts a\ndispositional view of power). Others suggest that both aspects of\npower are important, but then focus their attention on either\npower-over (e.g., Connolly 1993) or power-to (e.g., Morriss 2002).\nStill others define power-over as a particular type of capacity,\nnamely, the capacity to impose one’s will on others; on this view,\npower-over is a derivative form of power-to (Allen 1999, Lukes 2005).\nHowever, others have argued power-over and power-to refer to\nfundamentally different meanings of the word “power” and\nthat it is a mistake to try to develop an account of power that\nintegrates these two concepts (Pitkin 1972, Wartenberg 1990). \nAnother way of carving up the philosophical literature on power is to\ndistinguish between action-theoretical conceptions of power —\nthat is, those that define power in terms of either the actions or the\ndispositional abilities of particular actors — and broader\nsystemic or constitutive conceptions of power — that is, those\nthat view power as systematically structuring possibilities for\naction, or, more strongly, as constituting actors and the social world\nin which they act. On this way of distinguishing various conceptions\nof power, Hobbes and Weber are on the same side, since both of them\nunderstand power in primarily instrumentalist, individualist, and\naction-theoretical terms (Saar 2010, 10). The systemic conception, by\ncontrast, views power as “the ways in which given social systems\nconfer differentials of dispositional power on agents, thus\nstructuring their possibilities for action” (Haugaard 2010, 425;\nsee Clegg 1989). The systemic conception thus highlights the ways in\nwhich broad historical, political, economic, cultural, and social\nforces enable some individuals to exercise power over others, or\ninculcate certain abilities and dispositions in some actors but not in\nothers. Saar argues, however, that the systemic conception of power\nshould be understood not as an alternative to the action-theoretical\nconception of power, but rather as a more complex and sophisticated\nvariant of that model. For, as he says, its “basic scenario\nremains individualistic at the methodological level: power operates on\nindividuals as individuals, in the form of a ‘bringing to action’ or\nexternal determination” (Saar 2010, 14). \nThe constitutive conception of power, by contrast, focuses on the\nfundamentally transindividual and relational ways in which individuals\nand the social worlds they inhabit are themselves constituted by power\nrelations. The roots of this constitutive conception can be traced\nback to Spinoza (2002a and 2002b), and also found in the work of more\ncontemporary theorists such as Arendt and Foucault. Here it is\nimportant to note that Foucault’s work on power contains both\naction-theoretical and constitutive strands. The former strand is\nevident in his claim, cited above, that “if we speak of the\nstructures or the mechanisms of power, it is only insofar as we\nsuppose that certain persons exercise power over others”\n(Foucault 1983, 217), whereas the latter strand is evident in his\ndefinition of power as “the multiplicity of force relations\nimmanent in the sphere in which they operate and which constitute\ntheir own organization; as the processes which, through ceaseless\nstruggles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses\nthem;…thus forming a chain or system” (Foucault 1979,\n92). \nWhat accounts for the highly contested nature of the concept of power?\nOne explanation is that how we conceptualize power is shaped by the\npolitical and theoretical interests that we bring to the study of\npower (Lukes 1986, Said 1986). For example, democratic theorists are\ninterested in different things when they study power than are social\nmovement theorists or critical race theorists or postcolonial\ntheorists, and so on. On this view, a specific conceptualization of\npower could be more or less useful depending on the specific\ndisciplinary or theoretical context in which it is deployed, where\nusefulness is evaluated in terms of how well it “accomplishes\nthe task the theorists set for themselves” (Haugaard 2010, 426).\nOn this view, if we suppose that feminists who are interested in power\nare interested in understanding and critiquing gender-based relations\nof domination and subordination as these intersect with other axes of\noppression and thinking about how such relations can be transformed\nthrough individual and collective resistance, then we would conclude\nthat specific conceptions of power should be evaluated in terms of how\nwell they enable feminists to fulfill those aims. \nLukes suggests another, more radical, explanation for the essentially\ncontested nature of the concept of power: our conceptions of power\nare, according to him, themselves shaped by power relations. As he\nputs it, “how we think about power may serve to reproduce and\nreinforce power structures and relations, or alternatively it may\nchallenge and subvert them. It may contribute to their continued\nfunctioning, or it may unmask their principles of operation, whose\neffectiveness is increased by their being hidden from view. To the\nextent that this is so, conceptual and methodological questions are\ninescapably political and so what ‘power’ means is\n‘essentially contested’…” (Lukes 2005, 63).\nThe thought that conceptions of power are themselves shaped by power\nrelations is behind the claim, made by many feminists, that the\ninfluential conception of power as power-over is itself a product of\nmale domination (for further discussion, see section 4 below). \nThose who conceptualize power as a resource understand it as a\npositive social good that is currently unequally distributed amongst\nwomen and men. For feminists who understand power in this way, the\ngoal is to redistribute this resource so that women will have power\nequal to men. Implicit in this view is the assumption that power is\n“a kind of stuff that can be possessed by individuals in greater\nor lesser amounts” (Young 1990, 31). \nThe conception of power as a resource can be found in the work of some\nliberal feminists (Mill 1970, Okin 1989). For example, in Justice,\nGender, and the Family, Susan Moller Okin argues that the\ncontemporary gender-structured family unjustly distributes the\nbenefits and burdens of familial life amongst husbands and wives. Okin\nincludes power on her list of benefits, which she calls\n“critical social goods.” As she puts it, “when we\nlook seriously at the distribution between husbands and wives of such\ncritical social goods as work (paid and unpaid), power, prestige,\nself-esteem, opportunities for self-development, and both physical and\neconomic security, we find socially constructed inequalities between\nthem, right down the list” (Okin, 1989, 136). Here, Okin seems\nto presuppose that power is a resource that is unequally and unjustly\ndistributed between men and women; hence, one of the goals of feminism\nwould be to redistribute this resource in more equitable ways. \nAlthough she doesn’t discuss Okin’s work explicitly, Iris Marion Young\nargues against this way of understanding power, which she refers to as\na distributive model of power. First, Young maintains that it is wrong\nto think of power as a kind of stuff that can be possessed; on her\nview, power is a relation, not a thing that can be distributed or\nredistributed. Second, she claims that the distributive model tends to\npresuppose a dyadic, atomistic understanding of power; as a result, it\nfails to illuminate the broader social, institutional and structural\ncontexts that shape individual relations of power. According to Young,\nthis makes the distributive model unhelpful for understanding the\nstructural features of domination. Third, the distributive model\nconceives of power statically, as a pattern of distribution, whereas\nYoung, following Foucault (1980), claims that power exists only in\naction, and thus must be understood dynamically, as existing in\nongoing processes or interactions. Finally, Young argues that the\ndistributive model of power tends to view domination as the\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few. According to Young,\nalthough this model might be appropriate for some forms of domination,\nit is not appropriate for the forms that domination takes in\ncontemporary industrial societies such as the United States (Young\n1990a, 31–33). On her view, in contemporary industrial\nsocieties, power is “widely dispersed and diffused” and\nyet it is nonetheless true that “social relations are tightly\ndefined by domination and oppression” (Young 1990a,\n32–33). \nYoung’s critique of the distributive model points toward an\nalternative way of conceptualizing power, one that understands power\nnot as a resource or critical social good, but instead views it as a\nrelation of domination. Although feminists have often used a variety\nof terms to refer to this kind of relation — including\n‘oppression’, ‘patriarchy’,\n‘subjection’, and so forth —the common thread in\nthese analyses is an understanding of power not only as power-over,\nbut as a specific kind of power-over relation, namely, one that is\nunjust or illegitimate. In what follows, I use the term\n‘domination’ simply to refer to such unjust or oppressive\npower-over relations. In the following section, I discuss the specific\nways in which feminists with different political and philosophical\ncommitments — influenced by phenomenology, radical feminism,\nsocialist feminism, intersectional feminism, post-structuralism, and\nanalytic philosophy — have conceptualized domination. \nThe locus classicus of feminist phenomenological approaches to\ntheorizing male domination is Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second\nSex. Beauvoir’s text provides a brilliant analysis of the\nsituation of women: the social, cultural, historical and economic\nconditions that define their existence. Beauvoir’s basic diagnosis of\nwomen’s situation relies on the distinction between being for-itself\n— self-conscious subjectivity that is capable of freedom and\ntranscendence — and being in-itself — the\nun-self-conscious things that are incapable of freedom and mired in\nimmanence. Beauvoir argues that whereas men have assumed the status of\nthe transcendent subject, women have been relegated to the status of\nthe immanent Other. As she puts it in a famous passage from the\nIntroduction to The Second Sex: “She is defined and\ndifferentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her;\nshe is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He\nis the Subject, he is the Absolute — she is the Other”\n(Beauvoir, xxii). This distinction — between man as Subject and\nwoman as Other — is the key to Beauvoir’s understanding of\ndomination or oppression. She writes, “every time transcendence\nfalls back into immanence, stagnation, there is a degradation of\nexistence into the ‘en-soi’ — the brutish life of\nsubjection to given conditions — and liberty into constraint and\ncontingence. This downfall represents a moral fault if the subject\nconsents to it; if it is inflicted upon him, it spells frustration and\noppression. In both cases it is an absolute evil” (Beauvoir,\nxxxv). Although Beauvoir suggests that women are partly responsible\nfor submitting to the status of the Other in order to avoid the\nanguish of authentic existence (hence, they are in bad faith) (see\nBeauvoir xxvii), she maintains that women are oppressed because they\nare compelled to assume the status of the Other, doomed to immanence\n(xxxv). Women’s situation is thus marked by a basic tension between\ntranscendence and immanence; as self-conscious human beings, they are\ncapable of transcendence, but they are compelled into immanence by\ncultural and social conditions that deny them that transcendence (see\nBeauvoir, chapter 21). \nMore recently, feminist phenomenologists have engaged critically with\nBeauvoir’s ground-breaking work, and, in so doing, have extended her\ninsights into power. For example, Iris Young argues that Beauvoir pays\nrelatively little attention to the role that female embodiment plays\nin women’s oppression (Young 1990b,142–3). Although Beauvoir\ndoes discuss women’s bodies in relation to their status as immanent\nOther, she tends to focus on women’s physiology, and how physiological\nfeatures such as menstruation and pregnancy tie women more closely to\nnature, thus, to immanence. In her essay, “Throwing Like a\nGirl,” Young draws on Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological\nanalysis of the lived body to analyze “the situatedness of the\nwoman’s actual bodily movement and orientation to its surroundings and\nits world” (Young 1990b, 143). She notes that girls and women\noften fail to use fully the spatial potential of their bodies (for\nexample, they throw like girls), they try not to take up too much\nspace, and they tend to approach physical activity tentatively and\nuncertainly (Young 1990b, 145–147). Young argues that feminine\nbodily comportment, movement, and spatial orientation exhibit the same\ntension between transcendence and immanence that Beauvoir diagnoses in\nThe Second Sex. “At the root of those\nmodalities,” Young writes, “is the fact that the woman\nlives her body as object as well as subject. The source of this is\nthat patriarchal society defines woman as object, as a mere body, and\nthat in sexist society women are in fact frequently regarded by others\nas objects and mere bodies” (Young 1990b, 155). And yet women\nare also subjects, and, thus, cannot think of themselves as mere\nbodily objects. As a result, woman “cannot be in unity with\nherself” (Young 1990b, 155). Young explores the tension between\ntranscendence and immanence and the lack of unity characteristic of\nfeminine subjectivity in more detail in several other essays that\nexplore pregnant embodiment, women’s experience with their clothes,\nand breasted experience (See Young 1990b, chapters 9–11). \nMuch important work in feminist phenomenology follows Young in drawing\ninspiration from Merleau-Ponty’s analyses of embodiment and\nintercorporeality (see Heinamaa 2003, Weiss 1999); like Young, these\nauthors use a Merleau-Pontyian approach to phenomenology to explore\nthe fundamental modalities of female embodiment or feminine bodily\ncomportment. Feminists have also mined the work of Edmund Husserl, the\nfounder of phenomenology, for useful resources for feminist\nphenomenology (Al-Saji 2010 and Oksala 2016). \nMore generally, Oksala’s recent work defends the importance of\nfeminist phenomenology as a exploration of gendered experience against\npoststructuralist critics who find such a project hopelessly\nessentialist. While Oksala acknowledges that essentialism is a danger\nfound in some work in feminist phenomenology – for example, she is\ncritical of Sonia Kruks (2001) for “considering ‘female experience’ as\nan irreducible given grounded in a female body” (Oksala 2016, 72) –\nshe also insists that a phenomenological analysis of experience is\ncrucial for feminism. As she puts it, “it is my contention that\nfeminist theory must ‘retrieve experience’, but this cannot mean\nreturning to a pre discursive female experience grounded in the\ncommonalities of women’s embodiment” (40). On her view, experience is\nalways constructed in such a way that it “reflects oppressive\ndiscourses and power relations” (43); and yet, experience and thought\nor discourse are not co-extensive. This means that there is always a\ngap between our personal experience and the linguistic representations\nthat we employ to make sense of that experience, and it is this gap\nthat provides the space for contestation and critique. Thus, Oksala\nconcludes, “experiences can contest discourses even if, or precisely\nbecause, they are conceptual through and through” (50). On Oksala’s\nview, experience plays a crucial role in reinforcing and reproducing\noppressive power relations, but radical reflection on our experience\nopens up a space for individual and collective resistance to and\ntransformation of those power relations. \nFor further feminist-phenomenological analyses of domination see\nBartky 1990, 2002, Bordo 1993, and Kruks 2001. For recent overviews of\nthe current state of the art in feminist phenomenology, see Fisher and\nEmbree 2000, and Heinamaa and Rodemeyer 2010. For a highly influential\narticulation of queer phenomenology, drawing on the work of Husserl,\nHeidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Fanon, see Ahmed (2006). For a\ncompelling phenomenological analysis of transgender, see Salamon\n(2010). \nUnlike liberal feminists, who view power as a positive social resource\nthat ought to be fairly distributed, and feminist phenomenologists,\nwho understand domination in terms of a tension between transcendence\nand immanence, radical feminists tend to understand power in terms of\ndyadic relations of dominance/subordination, often understood on\nanalogy with the relationship between master and slave. \nFor example, in the work of legal theorist Catharine MacKinnon,\ndomination is closely bound up with her understanding of gender\ndifference. According to MacKinnon, gender difference is simply the\nreified effect of domination. As she puts it, “difference is the\nvelvet glove on the iron fist of domination. The problem is not that\ndifferences are not valued; the problem is that they are defined by\npower” (MacKinnon 1989, 219). If gender difference is itself a\nfunction of domination, then the implication is that men are powerful\nand women are powerless by definition. As MacKinnon puts it,\n“women/men is a distinction not just of difference, but of power\nand powerlessness….Power/powerlessness is the sex\ndifference” (MacKinnon 1987, 123). (In this passage, MacKinnon\nglosses over the distinction, articulated by many second-wave\nfeminists, between sex — the biologically rooted traits that\nmake one male or female, traits that are often presumed to be natural\nand immutable — and gender — the socially and culturally\nrooted, hence contingent and mutable, traits, characteristics,\ndispositions, and practices that make one a woman or a man. This\npassage suggests that MacKinnon, like Judith Butler (1990) and other\ncritics of the sex/gender distinction, thinks that sex difference, no\nless than gender difference, is socially constructed and shaped by\nrelations of power.) If men are powerful and women powerless as such,\nthen male domination is, on this view, pervasive. Indeed, MacKinnon\nclaims that it is a basic “fact of male supremacy” that\n“no woman escapes the meaning of being a woman within a gendered\nsocial system, and sex inequality is not only pervasive but may be\nuniversal (in the sense of never having not been in some form”\n(MacKinnon 1989, 104–05). For MacKinnon, heterosexual\nintercourse is the paradigm of male domination; as she puts it,\n“the social relation between the sexes is organized so that men\nmay dominate and women must submit and this relation is sexual —\nin fact, is sex” (MacKinnon 1987, 3). As a result, she tends to\npresuppose a dyadic conception of domination, according to which\nindividual women are subject to the will of individual men. If male\ndomination is pervasive and women are powerless by definition, then it\nfollows that female power is “a contradiction in terms, socially\nspeaking” (MacKinnon 1987, 53). The claim that female power is a\ncontradiction in terms has led many feminists to criticize MacKinnon\non the grounds that she denies women’s agency and presents them as\nhelpless victims (for an exemplary version of this criticism, see\nButler 1997). \nMarilyn Frye likewise offers a radical feminist analysis of power that\nseems to presuppose a dyadic model of domination. Frye identifies\nseveral faces of power, one of the most important of which is access.\nAs Frye puts it, “total power is unconditional access; total\npowerlessness is being unconditionally accessible. The creation and\nmanipulation of power is constituted of the manipulation and control\nof access” (Frye 1983, 103). If access is one of the most\nimportant faces of power, then feminist separatism, insofar as it is a\nway of denying access to women’s bodies, emotional support, domestic\nlabor, and so forth, represents a profound challenge to male power.\nFor this reason, Frye maintains that all feminism that is worth the\nname entails some form of separatism. She also suggests that this is\nthe real reason that men get so upset by acts of separatism: “if\nyou are doing something that is so strictly forbidden by the\npatriarchs, you must be doing something right” (Frye 1983, 98).\nFrye frequently compares male domination to a master/slave\nrelationship (see, for example, 1983, 103–105), and she defines\noppression as “a system of interrelated barriers and forces\nwhich reduce, immobilize, and mold people who belong to a certain\ngroup, and effect their subordination to another group (individually\nto individuals of the other group, and as a group, to that\ngroup)” (Frye 1983, 33). In addition to access, Frye discusses\ndefinition as another, related, face of power. Frye claims that\n“the powerful normally determine what is said and sayable”\n(105). For example, “when the Secretary of Defense calls\nsomething a peace negotiation…then whatever it is that he\ncalled a peace negotiation is an instance of negotiating peace”\n(105). Under conditions of subordination, women typically do not have\nthe power to define the terms of their situation, but by controlling\naccess, Frye argues, they can begin to assert control over their own\nself-definition. Both of these — controlling access and\ndefinition — are ways of taking power. Although she does not go\nso far as MacKinnon does in claiming that female power is a\ncontradiction in terms, Frye does claim that “if there is one\nthing women are queasy about it is actually taking power” (Frye\n1983, 107). \nA similar dyadic conception of male domination can arguably be found\nin Carole Pateman’s The Sexual Contract (1988) (although in\nother respects Pateman’s work might be more accurately described as\nsocialist-feminist rather than radical-feminist). Like MacKinnon,\nPateman claims that gender difference is constituted by domination; as\nshe puts it, “the patriarchal construction of the difference\nbetween masculinity and femininity is the political difference between\nfreedom and subjection” (Pateman 1988, 207). She also claims\nthat male domination is pervasive, and she explicitly appeals to a\nmaster/subject model to understand it; as she puts it, “in\nmodern civil society all men are deemed good enough to be women’s\nmasters” (Pateman 1988, 219). In Pateman’s view, the social\ncontract that initiates civil society and provides for the legitimate\nexercise of political rights is also a sexual contract that\nestablishes what she calls “the law of male sex-right,”\nsecuring male sexual access to and dominance over women (1988, 182).\nAs Nancy Fraser has argued, on Pateman’s view, the sexual contract\n“institutes a series of male/female master/subject dyads”\n(Fraser 1993, 173). Fraser is highly critical of Pateman’s analysis,\nwhich she terms the “master/subject model,” a model that\npresents women’s subordination “first and foremost as the\ncondition of being subject to the direct command of an individual\nman” (1993, 173). The problem with this dyadic account of\nwomen’s subordination, according to Fraser, is that “gender\ninequality is today being transformed by a shift from dyadic relations\nof mastery and subjection to more impersonal structural mechanisms\nthat are lived through more fluid cultural forms” (1993, 180).\nFraser suggests that, in order to understand women’s subordination in\ncontemporary Western societies, feminists will have to move beyond the\nmaster/subject model to analyze how women’s subordination is secured\nthrough cultural norms, social practices, and other impersonal\nstructural mechanisms. (For Pateman’s response to Fraser’s criticism,\nsee Pateman and Mills (2007, 205–06)). \nAccording to the traditional Marxist account of power, domination is\nunderstood on the model of class exploitation; domination results from\nthe capitalist appropriation of the surplus value that is produced by\nthe workers. As many second wave feminist critics of Marx have pointed\nout, however, Marx’s categories are gender-blind (see, for example,\nFirestone 1970, Hartmann 1980, Hartsock 1983, Rubin 1976). Marx\nignores the ways in which class exploitation and gender subordination\nare intertwined; because he focuses solely on economic production,\nMarx overlooks women’s reproductive labor in the home and the\nexploitation of this labor in capitalist modes of production. As a\nresult of this gender-blindness, socialist feminists have argued that\nMarx’s analysis of class domination must be supplemented with a\nradical feminist critique of patriarchy in order to yield a\nsatisfactory account of women’s oppression; the resulting theory is\nreferred to as dual systems theory (see, for example, Eisenstein 1979,\nHartmann 1980). As Iris Young puts it, “dual systems theory says\nthat women’s oppression arises from two distinct and relatively\nautonomous systems. The system of male domination, most often called\n‘patriarchy’, produces the specific gender oppression of\nwomen; the system of the mode of production and class relations\nproduces the class oppression and work alienation of most women”\n(Young 1990b, 21). Although Young agrees with the aim of theorizing\nclass and gender domination in a single theory, she is critical of\ndual systems theory on the grounds that “it allows Marxism to\nretain in basically unchanged form its theory of economic and social\nrelations, on to which it merely grafts a theory of gender\nrelations” (Young 1990b, 24). Young calls instead for a more\nunified theory, a truly feminist historical materialism that would\noffer a critique of society and social relations of power as a\nwhole. \nIn a later essay, Young offers a more systematic analysis of\noppression, an analysis that is grounded in her earlier call for a\ncomprehensive socialist feminism. Young identifies five faces of\noppression: economic exploitation, socio-economic marginalization,\nlack of power or autonomy over one’s work, cultural imperialism, and\nsystematic violence (Young 1992, 183–193). The first three faces\nof oppression in this list expand on the Marxist account of economic\nexploitation, and the last two go beyond that account, bringing out\nother aspects of oppression that are not well explained in economic\nterms. According to Young, being subject to any one of these forms of\npower is sufficient to call a group oppressed, but most oppressed\ngroups in the United States experience more than one of these forms of\npower, and some experience all five (Young 1992, 194). She also claims\nthat this list is comprehensive, both in the sense that “covers\nall the groups said by new left social movements to be\noppressed” and that it “covers all the ways they are\noppressed” (Young 1992, 181; for critical discussion, see Allen\n2008b). \nNancy Hartsock offers a different vision of feminist historical\nmaterialism in her book Money, Sex, and Power: Toward a\nFeminist Historical Materialism (1983). In this book, Hartsock is\nconcerned with “(1) how relations of domination along lines of\ngender are constructed and maintained and (2) whether social\nunderstandings of domination itself have been distorted by men’s\ndomination of women” (Hartsock 1983, 1). Following Marx’s\nconception of ideology, Hartsock maintains that the prevailing ideas\nand theories of a time period are rooted in the material, economic\nrelations of that society. This applies, in her view, to theories of\npower as well. Thus, she criticizes theories of power in mainstream\npolitical science for presupposing a market model of economic\nrelations — a model that understands the economy primarily in\nterms of exchange, which is how it appears from the perspective of the\nruling class rather than in terms of production, which is how it\nappears from the perspective of the worker. She also argues that power\nand domination have consistently been associated with masculinity.\nBecause power has been understood from the position of the socially\ndominant — the ruling class and men — the feminist task,\naccording to Hartsock, is to reconceptualize power from a specifically\nfeminist standpoint, one that is rooted in women’s life experience,\nspecifically, their role in reproduction. Conceptualizing power from\nthis standpoint can, according to Hartsock, “point beyond\nunderstandings of power as power over others” (Hartsock 1983,\n12). (We’ll come back to this point in section 4). \nJust as socialist feminists tried to broaden the theoretical framework\nfor analyzing power so that it might encompass both class exploitation\nand women’s subordination, intersectional theorists have aimed to\nbroaden the framework even further. The goal of theories of\nintersectionality is to develop a single framework for analyzing power\nthat encompasses sexism, racism, class oppression, heterosexism, and\nother axes of oppression in their complex interconnections. The\nproject of intersectional feminism grew out of black feminism, which\nas scholars have recently noted, has a long tradition of examining the\ninterconnections between racism and sexism, stretching back to the\nwriting and activism of 19th century black feminists such as Maria W.\nStewart, Ida. B. Wells, Anna Julia Cooper, and Sojourner Truth (see\nGines 2014). Because these thinkers and activists did not use the term\nintersectionality, Gines characterizes their work as\nproto-intersectional, which she defines as follows: “identifying and\ncombating racism and sexism -- through activist organizing and\ncampaigning -- not only as separate categories impacting identity and\noppression, but also as systems of oppression that work together and\nmutually reinforce one another, presenting unique problems for black\nwomen who experience both, simultaneously and differently than white\nwomen and/or black men” (Gines 2014, 14). Other important antecedents\nto contemporary intersectionality theory include the Combahee River\nCollective’s notion of “interlocking systems of oppression” (CRC\n1977), Deborah King’s analysis of multiple jeopardy and multiple\nconsciousness (King 1988), and the work from the 1980s of black\nfeminists such as Audre Lorde, Angela Davis (1984), and bell hooks\n(1981).  \nIn other words, the concept of intersectionality has a long history\nand a complex genealogy (for an account of that genealogy, see Collins\n2011). But the contemporary discussion and use of the term\nintersectionality was sparked by the work of legal theorist Kimberle\nCrenshaw (Crenshaw 1991a and 1991b), specifically, by her critique of\nsingle-axis frameworks for understanding domination in the context of\nlegal discrimination. A single-axis framework treats race and gender\nas mutually exclusive categories of experience. In so doing, such a\nframework implicitly privileges the perspective of the most privileged\nmembers of oppressed groups — sex or class-privileged blacks in\nrace discrimination cases; race or class-privileged women in sex\ndiscrimination cases. Thus, a single-axis framework distorts the\nexperiences of black women, who are simultaneously subject to multiple\nand intersecting forms of subordination. As Crenshaw explains,\n“the intersection of racism and sexism factors into Black\nwomen’s lives in ways that cannot be captured wholly by looking at the\nrace or gender dimensions of those experiences separately”\n(Crenshaw 1991b, 1244). \nIn the twenty years since the publication of Crenshaw’s essays on\nintersectionality, this framework has become extraordinarily\ninfluential in women’s, gender, and sexuality studies. Indeed, it has\nbeen called “the most important contribution that women’s studies, in\nconjunction with other fields, has made so far” (McCall 2005, 1771).\nHowever, feminist philosophers have noted that this influence has yet\nto be felt within the mainstream of the discipline of philosophy,\nwhere “intersectionality is largely ignored as a philosophical theme\nor framework” (Goswami, O’Donovan and Yount 2014, 6). Moreover,\nintersectionality is not without its feminist critics.  \nSome proponents of intersectionality have suggested that the concept\nis limited in that it focuses primarily on the action-theoretical\nlevel. A full analysis of the intertwining of racial, gender, and\nclass-based subordination also requires, on this view, a systemic or\nmacro-level concept that corresponds to the concept of\nintersectionality. Echoing the Combahee River Collective (CRC 1977),\nPatricia Hill Collins proposes the term “interlocking systems of\noppression” to fulfill this role. As she explains, “the\nnotion of interlocking oppressions refers to the macro-level\nconnections linking systems of oppression such as race, class, and\ngender. This is the model describing the social structures that create\nsocial positions.Second, the notion of intersectionality describes\nmicro-level processes — namely, how each individual and group\noccupies a social position within interlocking structures of\noppression described by the metaphor of intersectionality. Together\nthey shape oppression” (Collins et al. 2002, 82). \nOther proponents of intersectionality have worried that discussions of\nintersectionality tend to focus too much on relations and sites of\noppression and subordination, without also taking into account\nrelations of privilege and dominance. As Jennifer Nash has argued,\nthis has led to “the question of whether all identities are\nintersectional or whether only multiply marginalized subjects have an\nintersectional identity” (Nash 2008, 9). Although some feminist\nscholars claim that intersectionality encompasses all subject\npositions, not just those that are marginalized or oppressed, Nash\ngoes on to note that “the overwhelming majority of intersectional\nscholarship has centred on the particular positions of multiply\nmarginalized subjects” (Nash 2008, 9-10). Nash argues that the\nover-emphasis on oppression in theories of intersectionality leads\ntheorists “to ignore the intimate connections between privilege and\noppression,” for example, by “ignor[ing] the ways in which subjects\nmight be both victimized by patriarchy and privileged by race” (Nash\n2008, 12). In response to this concern, philosophers such as Ann Garry\nhave offered a broader, more inclusive conception of intersectionality\nthat emphasizes both oppression and privilege (see Garry 2011).  \nRather than supplementing the notion of intersectionality with a\nmacro-level concept of interlocking systems of oppression or\nbroadening it to include relations of oppression and privilege, Naomi\nZack argues that feminists should move beyond it. Zack maintains that\nintersectionality undermines its own goal of making feminism more\ninclusive. It does this, on Zack’s view, by dividing women into\nsmaller and smaller groups, formed by specific intersections of race,\nclass, gender, sexuality, and so forth. As Zack puts it, “as a theory\nof women’s identity, intersectionality is not inclusive insofar as\nmembers of specific intersections of race and class create only\ntheir own feminisms” (Zack 2005, 2). Because it tends toward “the\nreification of intersections as incommensurable identities,” Zack\nmaintains that “intersectionality has not borne impressive political\nfruit” (Zack 2005, 18).  \nFrom a very different perspective, queer feminists Lynne Huffer and\nJasbir Puar have also criticized intersectionality as a theory of\nidentity. Unlike Zack, however, their concern is not with the\nproliferation of incommensurable identities but rather with the ways\nin which the notion of intersectionality remains, as Puar says,\n“primarily trapped within the logic of identity” (Puar 2012, 60). As\nHuffer puts the point: “the institutionalization of intersectionality\nas the only approach to gender and sexuality that takes\ndifference seriously masks intersectionality’s investment in a\nsubject-making form of power-knowledge that runs the risk of\nperpetuating precisely the problems intersectionality had hoped to\nalleviate” (Huffer 2013, 18).  \nFinally, Anna Carastathis has argued that the problem with\nintersectionality theory lies in its very success (Carastathis 2013\nand 2014). Intersectionality has been, on her view, too easily\nappropriated by white-dominated feminist theory, cut off from its\nroots in Black and women of color feminism, and incorporated into a\nself-congratulatory progressivist narrative according to which\n“intersectionality is celebrated as a methodological triumph over\n‘previous’ essentialist and exclusionary approaches to theorizing\nidentity and power relations” (Carastathis 2014, 59; for related\ncritiques, see Nash 2008 and Puar 2012). Carastathis cites Kimberle\nCrenshaw’s lament that intersectionality’s reach is wide but not very\ndeep, and suggests that this may be the result of aversive racism --\nthat is, a desire to assert or establish racial innocence, but without\nreally coming to terms with their own internalized racism -- on the\npart of white feminists (Carastathis, 2014, 68-69).  \nIn response to these sorts of criticisms of intersectionality, some\nscholars have attempted to reformulate the concept either as a family\nresemblance concept (Garry 2011) or by highlighting its provisionality\n(Carastathis, 2014). Others have argued for an expansion of the\nintersectional framework to better account for the experiences of\ndiasporic subjects (Sheth 2014) or for a rethinking of this framework\nin relation to a Deleuzian notion of assemblage (Puar 2007 and 2012).\n \nMost of the work on power done by post-structuralist feminists has\nbeen inspired by Foucault. In his middle period works (Foucault 1977,\n1978, and 1980), Foucault analyzes modern power as a mobile and\nconstantly shifting set of force relations that emerge from every\nsocial interaction and thus pervade the social body. As he puts it,\n“power is everywhere, not because it embraces everything, but\nbecause it comes from everywhere” (1978, 93). Foucault endeavors\nto offer a “micro-physics” of modern power (1977, 26), an\nanalysis that focuses not on the concentration of power in the hands\nof the sovereign or the state, but instead on how power flows through\nthe capillaries of the social body. Foucault criticizes previous\nanalyses of power (primarily Marxist and Freudian) for assuming that\npower is fundamentally repressive, a belief that he terms the\n“repressive hypothesis” (1978, 17–49). Although\nFoucault does not deny that power sometimes functions repressively\n(see 1978, 12), he maintains that it is primarily productive; as he\nputs it, “power produces; it produces reality; it produces\ndomains of objects and rituals of truth” (1977, 194). It also,\naccording to Foucault, produces subjects. As he puts it, “the\nindividual is not the vis-à-vis of power; it is, I believe, one\nof its prime effects” (1980, 98). According to Foucault, modern\npower subjects individuals, in both senses of the term; it\nsimultaneously creates them as subjects by subjecting them to power.\nAs we will see in a moment, Foucault’s account of subjection and his\naccount of power more generally have been extremely fruitful, but also\nquite controversial, for feminists interested in analyzing\ndomination. \nIt should come as no surprise that so many feminists have drawn on\nFoucault’s analysis of power. Foucault’s analysis of power has\narguably been the most influential discussion of the topic over the\nlast thirty years; even those theorists of power who are highly\ncritical of Foucault’s work acknowledge this influence (Lukes 2005\nand, in a somewhat backhanded way, Morriss 2002). Moreover, Foucault’s\nfocus on the local and capillary nature of modern power clearly\nresonates with feminist efforts to redefine the scope and bounds of\nthe political, efforts that are summed up by the slogan “the\npersonal is political.” At this point, the feminist work that\nhas been inspired by Foucault’s analysis of power is so extensive and\nvaried that it defies summarization (see, for example, Allen 1999 and\n2008a, Bartky 1990, Bordo 2003, Butler 1990, 1993, 1997, Diamond and\nQuinby (eds) 1988, Fraser 1989, Hekman (ed) 1996, Heyes 2007, McLaren\n2002, McNay 1992, McWhorter 1999, Sawicki 1990, and Young 1990). I\nwill concentrate on highlighting a few central issues from this rich\nand diverse body of scholarship. \nSeveral of the most prominent Foucaultian-feminist analyses of power\ndraw on his account of disciplinary power in order to critically\nanalyze normative femininity. In Discipline and Punish,\nFoucault analyzes the disciplinary practices that were developed in\nprisons, schools, and factories in the 18th century — including\nminute regulations of bodily movements, obsessively detailed time\nschedules, and surveillance techniques — and how these practices\nshape the bodies of prisoners, students and workers into docile bodies\n(1977, 135–169). In her highly influential essay, Sandra Bartky\ncriticizes Foucault for failing to notice that disciplinary practices\nare gendered and that, through such gendered discipline, women’s\nbodies are rendered more docile than the bodies of men (1990, 65).\nDrawing on and extending Foucault’s account of disciplinary power,\nBartky analyzes the disciplinary practices that engender specifically\nfeminine docile bodies — including dieting practices,\nlimitations on gestures and mobility, and bodily ornamentation. She\nalso expands Foucault’s analysis of the Panopticon, Jeremy Bentham’s\ndesign for the ideal prison, a building whose spatial arrangement was\ndesigned to compel the inmate to surveil himself, thus becoming, as\nFoucault famously put it, “the principle of his own\nsubjection” (1977, 203). With respect to gendered disciplinary\npractices such as dieting, restricting one’s movement so as to avoid\ntaking up too much space, and keeping one’s body properly hairless,\nattired, ornamented and made up, Bartky observes “it is women\nthemselves who practice this discipline on and against their own\nbodies….The woman who checks her make-up half a dozen times a\nday to see if her foundation has caked or her mascara run, who worries\nthat the wind or rain may spoil her hairdo, who looks frequently to\nsee if her stocking have bagged at the ankle, or who, feeling fat,\nmonitors everything she eats, has become, just as surely as the inmate\nin the Panopticon, a self-policing subject, a self committed to\nrelentless self-surveillance. This self-surveillance is a form of\nobedience to patriarchy” (1990, 80). \nAs Susan Bordo points out, this model of self-surveillance does not\nadequately illuminate all forms of female subordination — all\ntoo often women are actually compelled into submission by means of\nphysical force, economic coercion, or emotional manipulation.\nNevertheless, Bordo agrees with Bartky that “when it comes to\nthe politics of appearance, such ideas are apt and illuminating”\n(1993, 27). Bordo explains that, in her own work, Foucault’s analysis\nof disciplinary power has been “extremely helpful both to my\nanalysis of the contemporary disciplines of diet and exercise and to\nmy understanding of eating disorders as arising out of and reproducing\nnormative feminine practices of our culture, practices which train the\nfemale body in docility and obedience to cultural demands while at the\nsame time being experienced in terms of power and control”\n(ibid). Bordo also highlights and makes use of Foucault’s\nunderstanding of power relations as inherently unstable, as always\naccompanied by, even generating, resistance (see Foucault 1983).\n“So, for example, the woman who goes into a rigorous\nweight-training program in order to achieve the currently stylish look\nmay discover that her new muscles give her the self-confidence that\nenables her to assert herself more forcefully at work” (1993,\n28). \nWhereas Bartky and Bordo focus on Foucault’s account of disciplinary\npower, Judith Butler draws primarily on his analysis of subjection.\nFor example, in her early and massively influential book, Gender\nTrouble (1990), Butler notes that “Foucault points out that\njuridical systems of power produce the subjects they subsequently come\nto represent. Juridical notions of power appear to regulate political\nlife in purely negative terms…..But the subjects regulated by\nsuch structures are, by virtue of being subjected to them, formed,\ndefined, and reproduced in accordance with the requirements of those\nstructures” (1990, 2). The implication of this for feminists is,\naccording to Butler, that “feminist critique ought also to\nunderstand how the category of ‘women’, the subject of\nfeminism, is produced and restrained by the very structures of power\nthrough which emancipation is sought” (1990, 2). This\nFoucaultian insight into the nature of subjection — into the\nways in which becoming a subject means at the same time being\nsubjected to power relations — thus forms the basis for Butler’s\ntrenchant critique of the category of women, and for her call for a\nsubversive performance of the gender norms that govern the production\nof gender identity. In Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\nextends this analysis to consider the impact of subjection on the\nbodily materiality of the subject. As she puts is, “power\noperates for Foucault in the constitution of the very materiality of\nthe subject, in the principle which simultaneously forms and regulates\nthe ‘subject’ of subjectivation” (1993, 34). Thus,\nfor Butler, power understood as subjection is implicated in the\nprocess of determining which bodies come to matter, whose lives are\nlivable and whose deaths grievable. In The Psychic Life of\nPower (1997), Butler expands further on the Foucaultian notion of\nsubjection, bringing it into dialogue with a Freudian account of the\npsyche. In the introduction to that text, Butler notes that subjection\nis a paradoxical form of power. It has an element of domination and\nsubordination, to be sure, but, she writes, “if, following\nFoucault, we understand power as forming the subject as well, as\nproviding the very condition of its existence and the trajectory of\nits desire, then power is not simply what we oppose but also, in a\nstrong sense, what we depend on for our existence and what we harbor\nand preserve in the beings that we are” (1997, 2). Although\nButler credits Foucault with recognizing the fundamentally ambivalent\ncharacter of subjection, she also argues that he does not offer an\naccount of the specific mechanisms by which the subjected subject is\nformed. For this, Butler maintains, we need an analysis of the psychic\nform that power takes, for only such an analysis can illuminate the\npassionate attachment to power that is characteristic of\nsubjection. \nAlthough many feminists have found Foucault’s analysis of power\nextremely fruitful and productive, Foucault has also had his share of\nfeminist critics. In a very influential early assessment, Nancy Fraser\nargues that, although Foucault’s work offers some interesting\nempirical insights into the functioning of modern power, it is\n“normatively confused” (Fraser 1989, 31). In his writings\non power, Foucault seems to eschew normative categories, preferring\ninstead to describe the way that power functions in local practices\nand to argue for the appropriate methodology for studying power. He\neven seems to suggest that such normative notions as autonomy,\nlegitimacy, sovereignty, and so forth, are themselves effects of\nmodern power (this point has been contested recently in the literature\non Foucault; see Allen 2008a and Oksala 2005). Fraser claims that this\nattempt to remain normatively neutral or even critical of normativity\nis incompatible with the politically engaged character of Foucault’s\nwritings. Thus, for example, although Foucault claims that power is\nalways accompanied by resistance, Fraser argues that he cannot explain\nwhy domination ought to be resisted. As she puts it, “only with\nthe introduction of normative notions of some kind could Foucault\nbegin to answer such questions. Only with the introduction of\nnormative notions could he begin to tell us what is wrong with the\nmodern power/knowledge regime and why we ought to oppose it”\n(1989, 29). Other feminists have criticized the Foucaultian claim that\nthe subject is an effect of power. According to feminists such as\nLinda Martín Alcoff and Seyla Benhabib, such a claim implies a\ndenial of agency that is incompatible with the demands of feminism as\nan emancipatory social movement (Alcoff 1990, Benhabib 1992, and\nBenhabib et al. 1995; for a reply to this line of criticism, see Allen\n2008a chs. 2 and 3). Finally, Nancy Hartsock (1990 and 1996) calls\ninto question the usefulness of Foucault’s work as an analytical tool.\nHartsock makes two related arguments against Foucault. First, she\nargues that his analysis of power is not a theory for women because it\ndoes not examine power from the epistemological point of view of the\nsubordinated; in her view, Foucault analyzes power from the\nperspective of the colonizer, rather than the colonized (1990).\nSecond, Foucault’s analysis of power fails to adequately theorize\nstructural relations of inequality and domination that undergird\nwomen’s subordination; this is related to the first argument because\n“domination, viewed from above, is more likely to look like\nequality”(1996, 39; for a response to this critique, see Allen\n1996 and 1999). \nDespite these and other trenchant feminist critiques of Foucault (see,\nfor example, Hekman, ed. 1996 and Ramazanoglu, ed. 1993), his analysis\nof power continues to be an extremely useful resource for feminist\nconceptions of domination. For recent important feminist work that\ndraws on Foucault’s genealogical method to offer an intersectional\nanalysis of racism and gender or sexual oppression see Feder (2007)\nand McWhorter (2009). \nImportant contribution to the feminist literature on power have come\nfrom a very different methodological perspective than the\npost-structuralist/Foucaultian perspective discussed in the previous\nsection. For example, in her 2006 book, Analyzing Oppression,\nAnn Cudd draws on the framework of rational choice theory to analyze\noppression (for related work on rational choice theory and power, see\nDowding 2001 and 2009; for critical discussion, see Allen 2008c). \nCudd defines oppression in terms of four conditions: 1) the group\ncondition, which states that individuals are subjected to unjust\ntreatment because of their membership (or ascribed membership) in\ncertain social groups (Cudd 2006, 21); 2) the harm condition, which\nstipulates that individuals are systematically and unfairly harmed as\na result of such membership (Cudd 2006, 21); 3) the coercion\ncondition, which specifies that the harms that those individuals\nsuffer are brought about through unjustified coercion (Cudd 2006, 22);\nand 4) the privilege condition, which states that such coercive,\ngroup-based harms count as oppression only when there exist other\nsocial groups who derive a reciprocal privilege or benefit from that\nunjust harm (Cudd 2006, 22–23). Cudd then defines oppression as\n“an objective social phenomenon” characterized by these\nfour conditions (Cudd 2006, 23). \nAs Cudd sees it, the most difficult and interesting question that an\nanalysis of oppression must confront is the “endurance question:\nhow does oppression endure over time in spite of humans’ rough natural\nequality?” (Cudd 2006, 25). Any satisfactory answer to this\nquestion must draw on a combination of empirical, social-scientific\nresearch and normative philosophical theorizing, inasmuch as a theory\nof oppression is an explanatory theory of a normative concept (Cudd\n2006, 26). (That oppression is a normative — rather than a\npurely descriptive — concept is evident from the fact that it is\ndefined as an unjust or unfair set of power relations). Cudd argues\nthat social-theoretical frameworks such as functionalism,\npsychoanalysis, and evolutionary psychology are inadequate for\ntheorizing oppression (Cudd 2006, 39–45). Structural rational\nchoice theory, in her view, best meets reasonable criteria of\nexplanatory adequacy and therefore provides the best\nsocial-theoretical framework for analyzing oppression. By appealing to\na  structural  theory of rational choice, Cudd’s analysis of\noppression avoids relying on assumptions about the psychology of\nindividual agents. Rather, as Cudd puts it, “the structural\ntheory of rational choice assesses the objective social rewards and\npenalties that are consequent on” the interactions and social\nstatus of specific group members and “uses these assessments to\nimpute preferences and beliefs to individuals based purely on their\nsocial group memberships” (Cudd 2006, 45). But, as a structural\ntheory of rational choice, the framework assumes “that\nagents behave rationally in the sense that they choose actions that\nmaximize their (induced) expected utilities” (Cudd 2006, 46). In\nother words, structural rational choice theory models human actions as\n“(basically instrumentally rational) individual choice\nconstrained within socially structured payoffs” (Cudd 2006, 37).\nWhen utilized to analyze oppression, structural rational choice theory\nsuggests that the key to answering the endurance question lies in the\nfact that “the oppressed are co-opted through their own\nshort-run rational choices to reinforce the long-run oppression of\ntheir social group” (Cudd 2006, 21–22). \nSally Haslanger’s work on gender and racial oppression, like Cudd’s,\nis heavily informed by the tools of analytic philosophy, though\nHaslanger also situates her work within the tradition of Critical\nTheory (see Haslanger 2012, 22-30). Haslanger distinguishes between\ntwo kinds of cases of oppression: agent oppression, in which “a person\nor persons (the oppressor(s)) inflicts harm upon another (the\noppressed) wrongfully or unjustly” (314) and structural oppression, in\nwhich “the oppression is not an individual wrong but a\nsocial/political wrong; that is, it is a problem lying in our\ncollective arrangements, an injustice in our practices or\ninstitutions” (314). Having made this distinction, Haslanger then\nargues for a mixed analysis of oppression that does not attempt to\nreduce agent oppression to structural oppression or vice versa. The\ndanger of reducing structural oppression to agent oppression -- what\nHaslanger calls the individualistic approach to oppression -- is that\ndoing so fails to acknowledge that “sometimes structures themselves,\nnot individuals are the problem” (320). The danger of reducing agent\noppression to structural oppression -- what Haslanger calls the\ninstitutionalist approach -- is that such an approach “fails to\ndistinguish those who abuse their power to do wrong and those who are\nprivileged but do not exploit their power” (320). Haslanger’s mixed\napproach, by contrast, is “attentive simultaneously [and, we might\nadd, non-reductively] to both agents and structures” (11). \nHaslanger also connects her account of structural domination and\noppression to her analysis of gender. Haslanger offers what she calls\na “focal analysis” of gender, according to which the core of gender is\n“the pattern of social relations that constitute the social classes of\nmen as dominant and women as subordinate” (228). Other things -- such\nas norms, identities, symbols, etc -- are then gendered in relation to\nthose social relations. On her analysis, gender categories are defined\nin terms of how one is socially positioned with respect to a broad\ncomplex of oppressive relations between groups that are distinguished\nfrom one another by means of sexual difference (see 229-230). As\nHaslanger explains, the “background idea” informing this account of\ngender is “that women are oppressed, and that they are\noppressed as women” (231). \nBy claiming that women are oppressed as women, Haslanger reiterates an\nearlier claim made by radical feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon\n(see, for example, MacKinnon 1987, 56-57. Indeed, Haslanger’s analysis\nis heavily indebted to MacKinnon’s work (see Haslanger 2012,35-82),\nthough she does not endorse MacKinnon’s strong claims about the link\nbetween objectivity and masculinity, nor does she adopt a dyadic (or,\nto use Haslanger’s terminology, reductively agent focused)\nunderstanding of oppression. But, like MacKinnon, Haslanger believes\nthat “gender categories are defined relationally -- one is a woman (or\na man) by virtue of one’s position in a system of social relations”\n(58). This means that “one’s gender is an extrinsic property, and...it\nis not necessary that we each have the gender we now have, or that we\nhave any gender at all” (58). Since the social relations in terms of\nwhich gender categories are defined are relations of hierarchical\ndomination and structural oppression, “gender is, by definition,\nhierarchical: Those who function socially as men have power over those\nwho function socially as women” (61). As Haslanger admits, referencing\nthe sex/gender distinction, this does not mean that all males have\npower over all females -- but it does mean that females who are not\nsubordinated by males are not, strictly speaking, women, and vice\nversa. Moreover, as Haslanger notes, “MacKinnon’s account of gender,\nlike others that define gender hierarchically, has the consequence\nthat feminism aims to undermine the very distinction it depends upon.\nIf feminism is successful, there will no longer be a gender\ndistinction as such” because the complex of social relations of\ndomination and structural oppression that give gender its meaning will\nno longer exist (62). While endorsing MacKinnon’s radical conclusion\nwith respect to the currently existing gender categories of ‘man’ and\n‘woman’, Haslanger’s own account offers a somewhat more nuanced view\nthat allows for the future possibility of a kind of gender difference\nthat would not be predicted on gender dominance: “gender can be\nfruitfully understood as a higher order genus that includes not only\nthe hierarchical social positions of man and woman, but potentially\nother non-hierarchical social positions defined in part by reference\nto reproductive function. I believe gender as we know it takes\nhierarchical forms as men and women; but the theoretical move of\ntreating men and women as only two kinds of gender provides resources\nfor thinking about other (actual) genders, and the political\npossibility of constructing non-hierarchical genders” (235) \nUp to this point, much of this entry has focused, as does much of the\nfeminist literature on this topic, on power understood in terms of an\noppressive or unjust power-over relationship. I have used the term\n‘domination’ to refer to such relationships, though some of the\ntheorists discussed above prefer the terms ‘oppression’ or\n‘subjection’, and others refer to this phenomenon simply as ‘power’.\nHowever, a significant strand of feminist theorizing of power starts\nwith the contention that the conception of power as power-over,\ndomination, or control is implicitly masculinist. In order to avoid\nsuch masculinist connotations, many feminists from a variety of\ntheoretical backgrounds have argued for a reconceptualization of power\nas a capacity or ability, specifically, the capacity to empower or\ntransform oneself and others. Thus, these feminists have tended to\nunderstood power not as power-over but as power-to. (Wartenberg (1990)\nargues that this feminist understanding of power, which he calls\ntransformative power, is actually a type of power-over, albeit one\nthat is distinct from domination because it aims at empowering those\nover whom it is exercised. However, most of the feminists who embrace\nthis transformative or empowerment-based conception of power\nexplicitly define it as an ability or capacity and present it as an\nalternative to putatively masculine notions of power-over. Thus, in\nwhat follows, I will follow their usage rather than Wartenberg’s.) \nFor example, Jean Baker Miller claims that “women’s examination\nof power…can bring new understanding to the whole concept of\npower” (Miller 1992, 241). Miller rejects the definition of\npower as domination; instead, she defines it as “the capacity to\nproduce a change — that is, to move anything from point A or\nstate A to point B or state B” (Miller 1992, 241). Miller\nsuggests that power understood as domination is particularly\nmasculine; from women’s perspective, power is understood differently:\n“there is enormous validity in women’s not wanting to use power\nas it is presently conceived and used. Rather, women may want to be\npowerful in ways that simultaneously enhance, rather than diminish,\nthe power of others” (Miller 1992, 247–248). \nSimilarly, Virginia Held argues against the masculinist conception of\npower as “the power to cause others to submit to one’s will, the\npower that led men to seek hierarchical control and…contractual\nconstraints” (Held 1993, 136). Held views women’s unique\nexperiences as mothers and caregivers as the basis for new insights\ninto power; as she puts it, “the capacity to give birth and to\nnurture and empower could be the basis for new and more humanly\npromising conceptions than the ones that now prevail of power,\nempowerment, and growth” (Held 1993, 137). According to Held,\n“the power of a mothering person to empower others, to foster\ntransformative growth, is a different sort of power from that of a\nstronger sword or a dominant will” (Held 1993, 209). On Held’s\nview, a feminist analysis of society and politics leads to an\nunderstanding of power as the capacity to transform and empower\noneself and others. \nThis conception of power as transformative and empowering is also a\nprominent theme in lesbian feminism and ecofeminism. For example,\nSarah Lucia Hoagland is critical of the masculine conception of power\nwith its focus on “state authority, police and armed forces,\ncontrol of economic resources, control of technology, and hierarchy\nand chain of command” (Hoagland 1988, 114). Instead, Hoagland\ndefines power as “power-from-within” which she understands\nas “the power of ability, of choice and engagement. It is\ncreative; and hence it is an affecting and transforming power but not\na controlling power” (Hoagland 1988, 118). Similarly, Starhawk\nclaims that she is “on the side of the power that emerges from\nwithin, that is inherent in us as the power to grow is inherent in the\nseed” (Starhawk 1987, 8). For both Hoagland and Starhawk,\npower-from-within is a positive, life-affirming, and empowering force\nthat stands in stark contrast to power understood as domination,\ncontrol or imposing one’s will on another. \nA similar understanding of power can also be found in the work of the\nprominent French feminists Luce Irigaray and Hélène\nCixous. Irigaray, for example, urges feminists to question the\ndefinition of power in phallocratic cultures, for if feminists\n“aim simply for a change in the distribution of power, leaving\nintact the power structure itself, then they are resubjecting\nthemselves, deliberately or not, to a phallocratic order”\n(Irigaray 1985, 81), that is, to a discursive and cultural order that\nprivileges the masculine, represented by the phallus. If we wish to\nsubvert the phallocratic order, according to Irigaray, we will have to\nreject “a definition of power of the masculine type”\n(Irigaray 1985, 81). Some feminists interpret Irigaray’s work on\nsexual difference as suggesting an alternative conception of power as\ntransformative, a conception that is grounded in a specifically\nfeminine economy (see Irigaray 1981 and Kuykendall 1983). Similarly,\nCixous claims that “les pouvoirs de la femme” do not\nconsist in mastering or exercising power over others, but instead are\na form of “power over oneself” (Cixous 1977,\n483–84). \nAlong similar lines, Nancy Hartsock refers to the understanding of\npower “as energy and competence rather than dominance” as\n“the feminist theory of power” (Hartsock 1983, 224).\nHartsock argues that precursors of this theory can be found in the\nwork of some women who did not consider themselves to be feminists\n— most notably, Hannah Arendt, whose rejection of the\ncommand-obedience model of power and definition of ‘power’\nas “the human ability not just to act but to act in\nconcert” overlaps significantly with the feminist conception of\npower as empowerment (1970, 44). Arendt’s definition of\n‘power’ brings out another aspect of the definition of\n‘power’ as empowerment because of her focus on community\nor collective empowerment (on the relationship between power and\ncommunity, see Hartsock 1983, 1996). This aspect of empowerment is\nevident in Mary Parker Follett’s distinction between power-over and\npower-with; for Follett, power-with is a collective ability that is a\nfunction of relationships of reciprocity between members of a group\n(Follett 1942). Hartsock finds it significant that the theme of power\nas capacity or empowerment has been so prominent in the work of women\nwho have written about power. In her view, this points in the\ndirection of a feminist standpoint that “should allow us to\nunderstand why the masculine community constructed…power, as\ndomination, repression, and death, and why women’s accounts of power\ndiffer in specific and systematic ways from those put forward by\nmen….such a standpoint might allow us to put forward an\nunderstanding of power that points in more liberatory\ndirections” (Hartsock 1983, 226). \nMore recently, the notion of empowerment has been taken up widely by\nadvocates of “power feminism.” A reaction against a perceived\nover-emphasis on women’s victimization and oppression in feminism of\nthe 1980s, power feminism emerged in the 1990s in the writings of\nfeminists such as Camille Paglia, Katie Roiphe, Christina Hoff\nSommers, and Naomi Wolf. Although this movement has had more influence\nin mainstream media and culture than in academia -- indeed, in many\nways it can be read as a critique of academic feminism -- it has also\nsparked scholarly debate. As Mary Caputi argues in her recent book\nFeminism and Power: The Need for Critical Theory (2013), power\nfeminists reject not only the excessive focus on women’s victimization\nbut also the claim, made by earlier empowerment theorists, that women\nare “sensitive creatures given more to a caring, interconnected web of\nhuman relationships than to the rugged individualism espoused by men”\n(Caputi 2013, 4). In contrast, power feminists endorse a more\nindividualistic, self-assertive, even aggressive conception of\nempowerment, one that tends to define empowerment in terms of\nindividual choice with little concern for the contexts within which\nchoices are made or the options from which women are able to choose.\nCaputi argues that power feminism relies on and mimetically reproduces\na problematically masculinist conception of power, one “enthralled by\nthe display of ‘power over’ rather than ‘power with’...” (Kaput 2013,\nxv). As she puts it: “feminism must query the uncritical endorsement\nof an empowerment aligned with a masculinist will to power, and disown\nthe tough, sassy, self-assured but unthinking ‘feminist’”\n(Caputi 2013, 17). Because of its tendency to mimic an\nindividualistic, sovereign, and masculinist conception of power over,\npower feminism, according to Caputi, “does little, if anything, to\nrethink our conception of power” (Caputi 2013, 89). In order to prompt\nsuch a rethinking, Caputi turns to the resources of the early\nFrankfurt School of critical theory and to the work of Jacques\nDerrida.  \nSerene Khader’s Adaptive Preferences and Women’s Empowerment\noffers another recent rethinking of empowerment in feminist theory.\nFocusing on empowerment in the context of international development\npractice, Khader develops a deliberative perfectionist account of\nadaptive preferences. Rather than defining adaptive preferences in\nterms of autonomy deficits, Khader defines them as preferences\n“inconsistent with basic flourishing...that are formed under\nconditions nonconductive to basic flourishing and...that we believe\npeople might be persuaded to transform upon normative scrutiny of\ntheir preferences and exposure to conditions more conducive to\nflourishing” (Khader 2011, 42). The perfectionism in her account leads\nher to emphasize the distinction between merely adaptive preferences\n-- those formed through adaptation to existing social conditions --\nand what she calls “inappropriately adaptive preferences” (IAPs) --\npreferences that are adaptive to bad or oppressive social conditions\nand that are harmful to those who adopt them (52-53). She also insists\nthat IAPs are most often selective rather than global self-entitlement\ndeficits (109), which means that they impact individuals’ sense of\ntheir own worth or entitlement to certain goods not globally but\nrather in particular domains and contexts and in relation to certain\nspecific individuals or groups. This allows her to acknowledge the\npsychological effects of oppression working through the mechanism of\nIAPs without denying the possibility of agency on the part of the\noppressed.  \nKhader draws on her deliberative perfectionist account of IAPs to\ndiagnose and move beyond certain controversies over the notion of\nempowerment that have emerged in feminist development practice and\ntheorizing. As the concept of women’s empowerment has become central\nto international development practice, feminists have raised concerns\nabout the ideological effects of this shift. While acknowledging that\nthe language of empowerment in development practice can have\nideological effects, Khader addresses these concerns by providing a\nclearer conception of empowerment than the one implicit in the\ndevelopment literature and emphasizing what she understands as the\nnormative core of this concept, its relation to human flourishing. She\ndefines empowerment as the “process of overcoming one or many IAPs\nthrough processes that enhance some element of a person’s concept of\nself-entitlement and increase her capacity to pursue her own\nflourishing” (Khader 2011, 176). This definition of empowerment\nenables her to rethink certain dilemmas of empowerment that have\nemerged in development theory and practices. For example, many\ndevelopment practitioners define empowerment in terms of choice, and\nthen struggle to make sense of apparently self-subordinating choices.\nIf choice equals empowerment, then does this mean that the choice to\nsubordinate or disempower oneself is an instance of empowerment?\nKhader’s finely grained analysis provides an elegant way out of this\ndilemma by emphasizing the conditions under which choices are made and\nthe tradeoffs among different domains or aspects of flourishing that\nthese conditions may necessitate. Discussing a case of young women in\nTanzania who chose to undergo clitoridectomy after receiving\neducation about the practice aimed at empowering them, Khader writes:\n“Are the young women who choose clitoridectomy disempowered because\nthey have few options for unambiguously pursuing their flourishing or\nare they empowered because they have exercised agential capacities by\nmaking a choice? My analysis of IAP allows us to say both” (187). For\nKhader, empowerment is a messy, complex, and incremental concept. Her\nanalysis of empowerment enables us to see that “self-subordinating\nchoices can have selective empowering effects under disempowering\nconditions” (189). But the normative core of her account, its\ndeliberative perfectionism, insists that “a situation where one cannot\nseek one’s basic flourishing across multiple domains is a tragic one”\n(189).  \nAs I claimed in the introduction, and as I hope this entry shows, the\nconcept of power is central to a wide variety of debates in feminist\nphilosophy. Indeed, the very centrality of this concept to feminist\ntheorizing creates difficulties in writing an entry such as this one:\nsince the concept of power is operative on one way or another in\nalmost all work in feminist theory, it is extremely difficult to place\nlimits on the relevant sources. Throughout, I have tried to emphasize\nthose texts and debates in which the concept of power is a central\ntheme, even if only an implicit one. I have also tried to prioritize\nthose authors and texts that have been most influential within\nfeminist philosophy, as opposed to the wider terrain of feminist\ntheory or gender studies, though I acknowledge that this distinction\nis difficult to maintain and perhaps not always terribly useful.\nQuestionable as such framing choices may be, they do offer some much\nneeded help in delimiting the range of relevant sources and providing\nfocus and structure to the discussion.","contact.mail":"ara17@psu.edu","contact.domain":"psu.edu"}]
