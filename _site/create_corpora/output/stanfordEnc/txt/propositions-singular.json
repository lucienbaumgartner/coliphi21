This characterization assumes a structured view of\npropositions —\n  see propositions: structured.\nAlleged examples of singular propositions are the propositions [Mont\nBlanc is more than 4,000 meters high], [Socrates was wise], and [She\n(pointing at Susan) lives in New York]. A singular proposition is to\nbe contrasted with a general proposition, which is not about\nany particular individual, and a particularized proposition,\nwhich is about a particular individual but does not contain that\nindividual as a constituent. Examples of the first are the\npropositions [Most Americans favor tax cuts] and [Some music is\ngreat]; examples of the second are the propositions [The inventor of\nbifocals was bald] and [The tallest spy is a man]. A singular\nproposition is directly about an individual whereas a\nparticularized proposition is indirectly about an individual\nin virtue of that object satisfying a condition that is a constituent\nof the proposition — in our cases, the conditions\n‘x uniquely invented bifocals’ and\n‘x is a tallest spy’.\n\n\n\nThe acceptance or rejection of singular propositions lies at the\ncenter of many issues in semantics, the philosophy of language and\nmind, and metaphysics. In this essay, we shall look at some of the\narguments for singular propositions, discuss problems their existence\ngive rise to, and show how singular propositions are related to\ncertain questions in metaphysics.\n\n\nWe will assume without argument a propositionalist semantics,\naccording to which sentences (in context) are assigned propositions as\ncontents which are the primary bearers of truth values, bearers of\nmodal properties like contingency and necessity, and objects of the\npropositional attitudes like believing, hoping, and saying. We can\ndistinguish two broad classes of theories about\npropositions. Proponents of the first, Fregean view accept Frege's\ndistinction between sense and reference and proponents of the second,\nRussellian view do not. If Fregeanism is true, all thought about\nconcrete individuals is indirect, mediated by senses that are\nindependent of those individuals. (Some maintain that Frege recognized\nde re senses — senses whose existence and identity is\ndependent upon their reference — as the contents of proper names,\nin which case he would not have subscribed to a Fregean theory, as\ncharacterized above.  The supplementary document \n\ncontains further discussion.) The easiest way to get a grip on this is\nto think of senses as purely qualitative satisfaction conditions. Such\na condition determines an object in virtue of the qualities it\ninstantiates. According to Russellianism, on the other hand, we can\nthink about an individual directly; we can have a thought about an\nindividual by having that individual as an immediate constituent of\nthe thought. On the standard interpretation of Frege, individuals are\nnot constituents of propositions. Propositions are composed\nof senses, not individuals, and senses are individuated independently of any individual. If Fregeanism is true,\nthere are no singular propositions. If Russellianism is true, then\nsingular propositions play a crucial role in semantics and any complete theory of  thought. \n\nBefore discussing the reasons for and against singular propositions,\nwe begin with a brief discussion of the views of the historical Frege\nand Russell. The hope is that the discussion will provide a clearer\nunderstanding of the views outlined above.  \n\nGottlob Frege famously distinguished between an\nexpression's reference and its sense. (The classic source is Frege\n1892/1948. The distinction was first introduced a year earlier in\n(1891). It is commonly thought, and Frege asserts as much, that the\nsense-reference distinction was not present in (1879/1967). But this\nearly work does contain a seeming anticipation of the distinction, as\nwell as the same argument from the opening paragraphs of (1892/1948)\nagainst the metalinguistic solution promoted in (1879/1967), which is\nextremely puzzling. We don't try to resolve the interpretative issues\nhere.) We focus on proper names, although Frege maintained that the\nsense-reference distinction applied to all expressions, including\nsentences, where the reference of a sentence is a truth value and its\nsense a thought. The reference of the name ‘Mark Twain’ is\nthe man Mark Twain himself, while its sense is a mode of presentation\nor way of thinking of that object. \n\nFrege argued for the distinctness of sense from reference as\nfollows. Suppose, for reductio, that the sole semantic value of the\nname ‘Mark Twain’ were its reference. Then, as the name\n‘Samuel Clemens’ is coreferential, the two names would be\nidentical in their semantic values. Given a plausible\nassumption of compositionality, the sentences ‘Mark Twain was a\nfamous American author’ and ‘Samuel Clemens was a famous\nAmerican author’ would then express the same proposition. But that\nis counterintuitive. It seems that fully competent speakers can\nbelieve what the one expresses without believing what the other\nexpresses. (Imagine our agent had an American literature class,\nhaving read Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, in which\nbiographical facts were withheld. She will accept the first \nsentence and reject the second.) If this is so, then the two sentences\nexpress different propositions. And if they express different\npropositions, there must be some semantically relevant difference\nbetween the names ‘Mark Twain’ and ‘Samuel\nClemens’. As their references do not differ, sense is distinct\nfrom reference. \n\nAn expression's sense is intended to capture its cognitive\nvalue. The above argument is intended to show that \ncoreferential proper names can present the same object in different\nways and it can be a cognitive achievement to come to learn that the\nobject presented in those different ways is one and the\nsame. Reference alone, Frege persuasively argued, cannot capture\ncognitive value. Capturing the cognitive significance of an expression\nis a primary role senses played in Frege's system. But they also\nplayed several other roles as well: They are the primary bearers of\ntruth values, the indirect references of sentences and hence the\nobjects denoted by that clauses like ‘that Frege denied the\nexistence of singular propositions’, and the objects of\npropositional attitudes, most importantly. These roles give rise to\nthe following theses concerning the individuation of senses. \n\nAccept  For any pair of sentences,\ns1 and s2, if a competent\nspeaker can rationally, reflectively, and sincerely accept\ns1 while rejecting s2, then\ns1 and s2 have different\nsenses. \n\nAttitude \n For any pair of sentences, s1 and\ns2, and propositional attitude verb Vs, if\nthe truth of\n ⌈a\n Vs that\n s1⌉\n is consistent with the falsity of\n ⌈a\n Vs that \n s2⌉, then s1\nand s2 have different senses. \nFrege's case for the sense-reference distinction is also a case that\nsingular propositions are not the semantic contents of natural\nlanguage sentences and are not the objects of the propositional\nattitudes. Singular propositions are too coarse-grained to account for\nwhat a competent speaker understands in virtue of grasping the meaning\nof a sentence. But the content of a sentence is, intuitively, what an\nagent grasps when she understands a sentence and what she believes\nwhen she accepts it. Frege concluded that singular propositions are\nill-suited for the purposes of semantics and psychology, as they lead\nto violations of Accept and\nAttitude. (For further discussion, see the entry\n Frege.)  \n\nBertrand Russell's views of language and thought are\nimportantly different from Frege's. (Russell held many distinct\nviews. We focus here on the Russell roughly from 1905 through 1912.)\nFirst, Russell held an acquaintance-based theory, according to which\nsome thought about individuals is direct, in the sense of involving\nsingular propositions involving those very individuals. Second,\nwhereas Frege introduced senses to help solve the puzzles discussed\nabove, Russell employed logical analysis and his theory of definite\ndescriptions. We take each point in turn. \n\nRussell maintained that an agent must be acquainted with every\nconstituent of a thought that she is in a position to entertain. Call\nthis the Acquaintance Principle. (The principle makes an\nappearance in (1905), but the view behind the principle is\nworked out in (1910) and (1912).) Russell thought that we are\nacquainted only with our occurrent sense data and universals (and he\nsometimes included the self, when he wasn't feeling skeptical of\nawareness of the self as an entity). So, Russell maintained that the\nonly singular propositions we can grasp are ones with those items as\nconstituents. \n\nWe can trace the fundamental source of Russell's restrictivism about\nacquaintance to the claim that one is acquainted only with that for\nwhich misidentification is rationally impossible. If it is possible\nfor one to be presented with o twice over and\nrationally not realize it as the same object, then one is not\nacquainted with o; one's thoughts about\no are, in that case, indirect. This line of reasoning\nrelies on the Fregean claim that identity confusions are to be\nexplained in terms of differences in thought constituents. Our English\nstudent's confusion regarding Mark Twain is thus to be explained in\nterms of different thoughts and hence different thought constituents\ncorresponding to the different ways of thinking about the man Mark\nTwain associated with the expressions ‘Mark Twain’ and\n‘Samuel Clemens’. This — that cases of\nmisidentification always involve differences in thought contents\n— marks an important point of agreement between Frege and\nRussell. \n\nNeo-Russellians are more permissive about the objects of acquaintance,\nincluding extra-mental particulars in this class. David Kaplan's\npioneering work (1977/1989) is typically the starting point, although\nRussell himself started out with such a position, maintaining, for\nexample, that Mont Blanc itself is a constituent of the thought that\nMont Blanc has snowfields. Neo-Russellians must deny the Fregean claim\nthat whenever misidentification is rationally possible, there is a\ndifference in thought constituents. They might still agree with\nFregean intuitions about the truth and falsity of propositional\nattitude ascribing sentences — agreeing, for example, that\n‘Peter believes that Mark Twain was a famous American\nauthor’ is true while ‘Peter believes that Samuel Clemens\nwas a famous American author’ is false — claiming that\nthis does not require a difference at the level of thought\nconstituents, following, for example, Mark Crimmins and John Perry\n(1989) or Mark Richard (1990). Such neo-Russellians claim that the\ntruth or falsity of a belief attitude ascribing sentence involves more\nthan just the agent of the report having among her beliefs the\nproposition expressed by the sentence embedded in the reporting\nsentence. Alternatively, the neo-Russellian might deny the Fregean\nintuitions about the truth and falsity of propositional attitude\nascribing sentences, following, for example, Nathan Salmon (1986) in\naccounting for those intuitions in nonsemantic terms. (For further\ndiscussion, see propositional\nattitude reports.)  Either way, however, given that\nmisidentification of extra-mental particulars is obviously possible,\nthe permissive theory of acquaintance requires denying the claim that\nall cases of misidentification involve differences in thought\nconstituents. \n\nWe have seen how Russell's adherence to the Acquaintance Principle\ntogether with his adoption of a Fregean attitude towards\nmisidentification led him to deny that we can think directly about\nextra-mental particulars. Russell admitted that there is an\nextra-mental reality filled with extra-mental particulars that we can\nand do think about. Like Frege, all such thought, Russell insisted, is\nindirect. But Russell did not follow Frege in introducing senses as\nthe mediators between individuals and our thought about them. Rather,\nRussell appealed to logical analysis through his theory of\ndescriptions. For Russell, all thought about extra-mental particulars\nis descriptive. In (1910), the canonical form such thought\ntook is the following: The thing that caused THIS\n[demonstratively referring to one's occurrent sense datum] is\nsuch-and-such, which is singular with respect to the sense datum\ndemonstrated. We can work up to this by seeing how Russell contrasted\nthree thoughts about Bismarck to the effect that he unified Germany\n(1910, 114–17). First, assuming acquaintance with the self, there is\nBismarck's own thought about himself. This thought is singular with\nrespect to Bismarck, having as its content the singular proposition\n[Bismarck unified Germany]. “But if a person who knew Bismarck\nmade a judgment about him, the case is different. What this person was\nacquainted with were certain sense data which he connected (rightly,\nwe will suppose) with Bismarck's body” (114). No human but\nBismarck, then, can grasp this singular proposition. Someone that has\nperceived Bismarck, say, Wilhelm II, has a thought with the following\nform, where BOB is the sense datum the agent has in virtue of his\nperception of Bismarck. \nThis proposition is particularized with respect to Bismarck, but\ndirect and thus singular only with respect to the occurrent sense\ndatum being demonstratively referred to. Finally, contrast this\njudgment with someone who has never perceived Bismarck but has only\nheard about him indirectly. Such agents cannot relate Bismarck\ndirectly to their sense data because, unlike Wilhelm, none of their\nsense data are caused by Bismarck's body. Hence, they must either\nthink of him purely qualitatively — as, say, the first\nChancellor of the German Empire, treating the German Empire\nas if it were a purely qualitative condition — or more\nindirectly, as the person written about in the books causing these\nsense data, thought standing in front of the books that are the source\nof the agents' thoughts about Bismarck.  \n\nFor Russell, sense data are the direct objects of thought in terms of\nwhich we think about extra-mental reality under descriptions relating,\ntypically causally, those bits of reality to the directly referred to\nsense data. (It is worth noting that the basic idea does not require\nRussell's theory of perception. For example, John Searle, in (1983),\nhas a similar view according to which we think immediately about\nexperiences, which are not analyzed in terms of the mind's being\npresented with sense data. We then think of extra-mental objects as\nthe causes of such and such occurrent experiences.) For Russell, while\nthere are thoughts about particulars that are wholly qualitative and\nwholly general, the paradigm form our thought about external reality\ntakes is ultimately grounded in acquaintance, albeit acquaintance with\nsense data as opposed to extra-mental reality itself. This is in stark\ncontrast to the canonical form such thought takes in Frege's system,\nin which there is no direct reference to any individuals, including\nsense data, and all thought is entirely indirect. (For further\ndiscussion, see the entries\n Bertrand Russell,\n knowledge by acquaintance vs. description, and\n descriptions.)  \nRussell rejected Frege's distinction between sense and reference\nand attempted to solve the problems motivating that distinction\nthrough logical analysis and scope distinctions. The resulting view is\none on which the proposition expressed by a sentence like ‘The\ninventor of bifocals was bald’ has neither a Fregean sense nor\nthe referent of the subject-position term as a constituent. Instead,\nRussell had propositional functions — functions from objects to\npropositions — in place of senses.  Yet at the bottom level such\na view seems to require singular propositions, which are the basic or\natomic propositions upon which the complex propositions are\nbuilt. Frege's atomic propositions are composed of senses while\nRussell's require individuals.  The first argument in favor of singular propositions we shall\nexamine is based on Saul Kripke's modal argument in\n(1970/1980). Kripke presented the argument as an argument that proper\nnames like ‘Nixon’ are not synonymous with ordinary\ndefinite descriptions like ‘the first US president from\nCalifornia’, rather than an argument for singular propositions,\nthe existence of which he never endorsed in print. David Kaplan, in\n(1977/1989, 512–13), however, used the argument to conclude that\ndemonstratives are directly referential expressions and hence express\nsingular propositions. The argument can be presented as follows.  \n Suppose that David is standing at a table with Charles to his immediate\nleft and Paul to his immediate right. Paul lives in New Jersey and Charles lives\nin Illinois. David points to the person on his right and utters\nsentence (1) below at time t. \nDavid has said something about Paul. Call the proposition David has\nexpressed p. p is distinct from the\npropositions expressed by the following sentences. \nBoth of the latter propositions are about Paul indirectly, in virtue\nof the properties he contingently has (namely, being to David's right\nat t and being demonstrated at t by David,\nrespectively). Now consider a counterfactual circumstance in which\nPaul and Charles have switched places but in which everything else\nabout them remained the same, consistent with this switch, and, in\nparticular, in which Paul still lived in New Jersey and Charles in\nIllinois. p is true at this circumstance, as Paul\nlives in New Jersey, while the propositions expressed by (2) and (3)\nare false at this circumstance, as Charles is both to David's right\nand demonstrated by David and he doesn't live in New Jersey. So,\np is distinct from the propositions expressed by (2)\nand (3). \n\nIt is important to be clear that we are concerned with the truth\nvalues of the propositions expressed by (1)-(3) at a described\ncounterfactual situation, not what propositions those sentences would\nhave expressed in those circumstances. (1) would have expressed a\ndifferent proposition, a proposition about Charles and so false, were\nDavid to have uttered it in the described situation. But our claim is\nthat the proposition expressed by David's actual utterance of (1) is\ntrue at the described counterfactual circumstance, while the\npropositions (actually) expressed by (2) and (3) are false at that\ncircumstance. \n Since p differs in truth value in the described\ncounterfactual circumstance from the propositions expressed by (2) and\n(3), it follows that p is distinct from the\npropositions expressed by (2) and (3). This is because, as\npropositions are the objects that are true or false in counterfactual\ncircumstances, if p =\np*, then p and p*\nhave the same truth value in all counterfactual circumstances. These\nconsiderations suggest that the proposition expressed by David's\nutterance of (1) is about Paul directly and hence that\np is a singular proposition. Any\nproposition that is about Paul indirectly, in virtue of qualities that\nhe contingently instantiates, will be subject to a similar argument. \n\nThere are two main responses to the modal argument in the\nliterature. The first involves a denial of the principle that, if\np = p*, then p and\np* have the same truth value in all counterfactual\ncircumstances. Michael Dummett (1991) and Jason Stanley (1997a/b;\n2002) have developed this response by denying that propositions are\nthe bearers of modal properties. Dummett distinguishes senses from\nwhat he calls ingredient senses. Senses give the contents of\nexpressions, are the bearers of truth and falsity, and are the objects\nof the attitudes. Ingredient senses, on the other hand, are the\nbearers of modal properties like being necessarily or contingently\ntrue or false and being true or false at a world. Because propositions\nare not the bearers of modal properties, Dummett and Stanley can\naccept that (1) is true with respect to our counterfactual situation\nwhile (2) and (3) are false even though the proposition expressed by\n(1) is the same as the proposition expressed by either (2) or (3). (It\nmay be possible to get the same results without denying that\npropositions are the bearers of modal properties by offering a\nnonstandard semantics of modal adverbs like ‘necessarily’\nand ‘contingently’ according to which they ascribe\nproperties — the property of being true in every/some world, say\n— to propositions but are sensitive to more than just the\nproposition they operate on. One model for this is the way\n‘so-called’ functions in a sentence like ‘Superman\nis so-called for his super powers’. To our knowledge such a\ntheory has yet to be worked out in detail, but we have no doubt that\nit could be.) \n\nThe second response involves moving from contingent properties like\nthose involved in (2) and (3) to necessary properties, and in\nparticular to what, following Plantinga in (1974), we will call an\nindividual essence, which is a property that, necessarily, if\nx exists, then it has that property and, necessarily, only\nx has. The property being on David's right is not an\nindividual essence of Paul, as Paul might have existed without having\nhad it and Charles might have had it instead. But it is easy to turn\nsuch contingent properties into necessary ones by\nrigidifiying them. Paul necessarily has the property of\nactually being on David's right. For any world\nw, Paul has that rigidified property in\nw just in case in the actual world Paul has the\n(contingent) property of being on David's right. And, if Paul is the\nonly person to have that property in the actual world, then the\nrigidified property is not only a necessary property of Paul but also\nan individual essence of Paul. Such a property “tracks”\nPaul across every possible world. Consider then the propositions\nexpressed by (4) and (5). \n As far as the modal argument goes, these propositions can be\nidentified with p, as, for every world\nw, they have exactly the same truth value at\nw as p intuitively has at w. \n We do not claim that either response is ultimately\nsatisfying. Indeed, we are satisfied by neither. But their presence\ndoes show that the modal argument fails to bring out the real\ndifficulties with descriptivism and the fundamental need for singular\npropositions.  David Kaplan, in (1977/1989), and John Perry, in (1977), (1979), \n(1980a/b), and (2001), argued that an adequate theory of indexicality requires\nsingular propositions. An indexical is an expression whose content is\nnot fixed by its linguistic meaning alone but requires\nextra-linguistic contextual supplementation. Take, for example, the\nsentence ‘I am happy’, considered in isolation from any\nparticular utterance or specifications of who is uttering it at what\ntime. The question of whether or not it is true is hardly\nsensible. That question makes sense only when we either consider an\nutterance of the sentence or provide the specification of at least an\nagent as speaker. (We remain neutral on the issue whether utterances\nof sentences are the primary bearers of semantic values or sentences\nin context.) Both Kaplan and Perry argue that a Fregean account of\nindexical expressions like ‘I’, ‘today’, and\n‘here’ and demonstrative expressions like\n‘he’, ‘this’, and ‘there’ is\ninadequate. We focus here on Perry's view. \n Perry argued against the Fregean claim that there is a single entity\n— sense — that answers to the three principles of sense\nindividuation presented in section 1. He argued that this\nidentification leads to several problems when applied to\nindexicals. Perry's position is that one entity answers to\nAccept and a distinct entity answers\nto Truth and Attitude. More\ngenerally, Perry argued that an adequate account of indexicals and\ndemonstratives in thought and language requires that we have one\nentity serving as cognitive values and a distinct entity serving as\nthe contents of thoughts and sentences and bearers of truth value. The\nmistake of the Fregean is to think that there is a single item that\ncan do all of the work. \n Consider the following sentence. \n (6) doesn't express a complete proposition on its own because\n‘today’ does not have a complete sense on its own. Suppose\nthat George held exactly one job, which he quit on 1 Aug 2000. (6) is\nthen true as uttered on 1 Aug 2000 and false as uttered on any other\nday. Perry considers three Fregean accounts of the sense expressed by\na use of ‘today’ in (6) and argues that they all\nfail. The first identifies the sense of ‘today’ with\nits role or character; the second identifies it with an equivalence\nclass of ordinary Fregean senses; and the third involves looking to\nthe beliefs of the speaker for its sense. \n We begin with the first, according to which the sense of a use of\n‘today’ is its role. This account, in effect, denies that\n‘today’ is an indexical. This is because the role of an\nexpression is the rule that takes one from a particular utterance of\nthe expression to its content on that use, which is the same across\nall uses. An expression's role is related to its linguistic\nmeaning. The role of ‘today’ is a rule that takes one from\na given use to the day of that use and the role of ‘I’ is a\nrule that takes one from a given use to the speaker of that use. So,\nif the sense of ‘today’ were its role, the same thought\nwould be expressed by every utterances of (6), regardless of the day\nof occurrence. But, as we have seen, different utterances of (6) have\ndifferent truth values. But then, by Truth, those\nutterances express different thoughts. Furthermore, the account\nviolates Accept, as it is possible to rationally take\ndifferential attitudes towards different utterances of (6). The sense\nof a use of ‘today’,then, is not its role. \n\nAccording to the second Fregean account, the sense of a use of an\nindexical like ‘today’ is the class of referentially\nequivalent ordinary Fregean senses. The equivalence class of thoughts\nfor an utterance of (6) on 1 Aug 2000 is the class of thoughts\ncomposed of the (incomplete) sense of ‘George quit his\njob’ and any completing sense that determines 1 Aug\n2000. Referential equivalence classes function much like singular\npropositions, in that they do not place any restrictions on the way in\nwhich the agent conceives of the referent of the thought. This makes\nthem poor candidates for accounting for the cognitive value of a\nsentence, as they lead to violations of\nAccept. Consider the following case, derived from a\ncase of Perry's. Suppose that you are sitting in a large harbor city\nand see the bow of a ship, with the name ‘Enterprise’\nclearly in view, sticking out behind a building. You also see the\nstern of a ship, with no name, sticking out behind another building\ntwo blocks away. The water view is obstructed by buildings for the\nintervening blocks. You might then accept your companion's\nutterance of the sentence ‘This is the Enterprise’,\npointing at the bow of the ship, but reject her utterance of the\nsentence ‘This is the Enterprise’, pointing at the stern\nof the ship. Associated with both utterances is the same equivalence\nclass of Fregean senses, as both uses of ‘this’ refer to\nthe same ship. But, because you competently accept the one and not the\nother, by Accept, different senses are expressed. We\nget the same results for (6) by considering someone who is confused\nabout what day it is. She might then accept an utterance of (6) on 1\nAugust 2000 while rejecting an utterance of ‘George quit his job\non 1 August 2000’, without a change of mind and despite the fact\nthat the same equivalence class is associated with both. If the sense\nof a use of ‘today’ is intended to capture that use's\ncognitive significance, as it clearly should on a Fregean account, we\nshould reject this second account. \n\nThe failings of the first two accounts as plausible Fregean accounts\nof (6) are fairly evident. The third Fregean account turns to the\nattitudes of the speaker to determine the sense of a given use of an\nindexical. Perry presented the key idea as follows. \n  Perry required that the descriptions D should be\nnonindexical.  Perry then presented three arguments against this\nsuggestion. (Kaplan developed similar arguments against what he calls\nthe Fregean theory of demonstratives in (1977/1989).) \n\nThe first objection is the irrelevancy of belief\nobjection. Believing that you live in that time and possessing\naccurate descriptive information of the medieval age does not make\nyour uses of ‘today’ about 1 August 1204, even though that\nis the date that best fits your conception of the date of your\nutterance. Uses of ‘today’ are about whatever day they\noccur on, whatever descriptions one associate with one's uses of the\nexpression and however one conceives of the day of one's\nutterance. But if the sense of a use of a ‘today’ were\ndetermined by the beliefs of the speaker, and if sense determines\nreference, then it would seem that your utterance is about 1204. So,\nthe beliefs of the speaker are irrelevant to the day an utterance of\n‘today’ is about.   This objection works best with “automatic” or\n“pure” indexicals like ‘today’ and\n‘I’ rather than “non-automatic” indexicals or\n“true” demonstratives like ‘she’ and\n‘this’, which require an associated demonstration to refer\nin context. This is because the reference of a use of a true\ndemonstrative is at least arguably determined in part by the speaker's\nbeliefs and audience-directed intentions, whereas the reference of a\npure indexical is settled by objective, attitude-independent factors\nof the occasion of utterance, like who is speaking when and\nwhere. (There is a debate about whether or not speaker beliefs and\nintentions are relevant even to true demonstratives. See Bach 1992,\nBertolet 1993, and Reimer 1991a/b and 1992.) \n\nWe noted above that Perry assumed that the descriptive beliefs that\ndetermine the sense of a use of ‘today’ themselves are not\nindexical. Lifting this ban removes some of the sting from the\nirrelevancy of belief objection. For consider the agent's belief that\nshe would express by saying, ‘‘Today is the day of this\nvery utterance.’’ While the purely qualitative descriptive\nconditions a speaker believes the day of her speech satisfies may be\nsatisfied by a different day, it is much less clear that the above\ndescriptive condition is satisfied by the wrong day. (It is also\nharder to imagine a nonproblematic case where the agent is confused\nabout whether or not the day referred to by her use of\n‘today’ satisfies this description.) But there are at\nleast two problems with the Fregean appealing to such\ndescriptions. The first is that it is unclear that ordinary agents\nactually have such beliefs when they competently utter a sentence like\n(6). It is also questionable whether all speakers who competently use\n‘today’ have the concepts of an utterance. If\nthey do not, then they are in a position to believe what is expressed\nby an utterance of ‘Today is fine’ without believing what\nis expressed by an utterance of ‘The day of this utterance is\nfine’, in which case, by Accept, the two\nsentence express different propositions. Second, even if they did, the\nsame question of the sense of the use of ‘this’ would\narise once again, with all of the problems Perry raises for the sense\nof (6). There is no room, in Frege's system, for irreducibly indexical\nthoughts, as Frege is clear that thoughts are true or false\nabsolutely, which an irreducibly indexical thought could not\nbe (just as the sentence ‘I am happy’ is not itself true\nor false absolutely). Insofar as the Fregean claims that truth is an\nabsolute property of thoughts, she must explicate the indexicality of\nlanguage and judgments using only nonindexical propositions or\nthoughts. (A proponent of a broadly Fregean view might claim that the\ntruth or falsity of a thought (and not just a sentence) is relative to\na sequence of parameters like a person, place, time, etc.. She could\nthen claim that the thought expressed by an utterance of (6) is itself\nirreducibly indexical and is only true or false relative to an\nassignment of parameters and in particular to a day.) \n\nPerry's second objection is the nonnecessity of belief\nobjection. This objection turns on the fact that a speaker can\nrefer to the time at which she is speaking with her use of\n‘today’ even though she lacks any adequate purely\nqualitative conception of what day it is. Consider the case of Rip Van\nWinkle. “When he awakes on October 20, 1823, and says with\nconviction ‘Today is October 20, 1803,’ the fact that he\nis sure he is right does not make him right, as it would if the\nthought expressed were determined by the sense he associated with\n‘today’” (1977, 12). (The case of Rip Van Winkle is\nvery rich. For further discussion, see Evans 1981/1985, Kaplan\n1977/1989 (538), and Perry 1997.) Van Winkle need not have a correct\nconception of the day of his utterance to be talking and thinking\nabout that day with his use of ‘today’. It suffices to\nsimply be located on that day and say, ‘‘Today is\nfine,’’ knowing the general rule of how uses of\n‘today’ function. A similar point can be made about\n‘I’, using a case of a person suffering complete amnesia,\nwho intuitively still speaks of herself when she says, ‘‘I\nam alive’’, despite lacking true beliefs of identifying\nbiographical information, and ‘here’, using a case of a\nperson who is completely confused about where she is. As was the case\nwith Perry's first objection, however, the nonnecessity of belief\nobjection is less persuasive with true demonstratives, where some kind\nof correct conception of the intended reference is arguably needed to\ndemonstrate it. \nIn his response to Perry, Gareth Evans (1981/1985) claimed that\nretaining indexical beliefs across changes in circumstance requires\nkeeping track of the objects those beliefs are about. So, for example,\nto believe the same thing today that I believed yesterday when I\nuttered (yesterday) the sentence ‘Today is fine’ requires\nmore than simply competently uttering today the sentence\n‘Yesterday was fine’. I must in addition, Evans claimed,\nhave kept track of the day and so properly registered the change in\nday. This makes belief necessary for retention of indexical beliefs,\neven beliefs expressed by sentences with pure indexicals. As Van\nWinkle does not successfully track the twenty some years between his\nfalling asleep and waking up, he does not retain the temporally\nindexical beliefs he had the night he fell asleep. Evans is less\nclear, however, that a proper conception of the day is necessary for\nformation (as opposed to retention) of a temporally\nindexical belief, which is what Perry's second objection denies. Does\nVan Winkle not think a thought about 1823 when he awakes and thinks to\nhimself, ‘Today is fine’?) Furthermore, the tracking\ncondition has consequences that seem contrary to key tenets of\nFregeanism. Losing track of time isn't something that is always\ninternally accessible. Rip Van Winkle and his less well-known brother\nKip, both of whom went to sleep after a fine day in October 1803. Kip\nwoke up 10 hours later and, recalling the previous day, thought to\nhimself, ‘Yesterday was fine’; Rip slept an additional 20\nyears and woke with memories of what he took to be the previous day\nand thought to himself, ‘Yesterday was fine’, being\nunaware of the additional passage of time. Because “everything\nis all the same” as far as Kip and Rip are concerned upon\nwaking, there is some pressure to say that their beliefs have the same\ncontent, assuming belief contents are intended to capture how the\nagent conceives the world, which is the motivation behind a principle\nlike Accept. (There is equally strong pressure to say\nthat they believe different things, as Kip's belief is true and Rip's\nfalse. But that is not generated from Accept but\nTruth and Perry's point is that, for important cases,\nthose principles pull in opposite directions.) \n\nPerry's third objection is the nonsufficiency of\nbelief. Consider the case of Hume and Heimson. Heimson believes\nthat he is Hume. But Heimson isn't just crazy, but also well informed\nabout every aspect of Hume's life. Still, Hume says something true\nwhen he utters the sentence ‘I wrote the\nTreatise’ and Heimson says something false. If so,\nthen, by Truth, they say different things, despite\nthe similarity in their qualitative descriptive beliefs. Even though\nHeimson's descriptive beliefs about who he is best fit Hume, still his\nself-thoughts are about Heimson and not Hume. The Fregean cannot,\nPerry claims, account for this. \n\nPerry assumed that Fregean thoughts are generally accessible, as they\nare entirely composed of logical operations and purely qualitative\nconditions. But then the thought Hume grasps when he thinks to himself\n‘‘I wrote the Treatise’’ is a thought\navailable for Heimson to grasp as well. (This assumption of general\naccessibility is at odds with what Frege says in his late work\n(1918/1956), where he claims that “everyone is presented to\nhimself in a particular and primitive way, in which he is presented to\nno-one else” (298). In his discussion of Dr. Lauben, Frege\ndenies that all thoughts are generally accessible and that the thought\nDr. Lauben grasps when he thinks to himself, ‘‘I am\ncold,’’ for example, is a thought that can be expressed by\nany sentence with a proper name. It is important to realize that this\nlimited accessibility thesis Frege held in later work is distinct from\nthe view alluded to above according to which a thought is irreducibly\nindexical. The former view is consistent with Dr. Lauben's thought\nbeing absolutely true or false, whereas the latter view is not. Frege\ndid not always hold this limited accessibility view, however. In an\nearlier, unpublished work intended as a logic textbook he writes:  Frege here seems to be claiming that the thought you have when you\nsay to yourself, ‘‘I am cold,’’ is a thought\nsomeone else can express by pointing at you and saying,\n‘‘S/he is cold,’’ which is exactly what he\ndenied in (1918/1956). Furthermore, although Frege only posits private\nsenses only for ‘I’, the worries that drove him to this\nview can be raised with other indexicals like ‘here’,\n‘today’, and ‘now’. It becomes less and less\nplausible to posit context-bound senses for each place, day, and\nmoment. In any event, the move to such perspective-bound thoughts has\nnot been generally accepted, even by followers of Frege.)  \n\nAny generally accessible, absolutely true or false thought, Perry\nargued, will violate Accept. For suppose that there\nwere a purely qualitative descriptive condition F\nHume associated with his use of ‘I’ that gives its sense;\nsay, the condition expressed by the expression ‘the philosopher\nwho argued against the rationality of induction’. It would seem\nthat, insofar as Hume forgot (or never knew) that he himself is\nuniquely F but retained his ability to think of\nhimself with the expression ‘I’, it is possible for him to\ncompetently, reflectively, and sincerely accept the sentence ‘I\nwrote the Treatise’ while not accepting ‘The\nF wrote the Treatise’. No such purely\nqualitative, generally accessible proposition, Perry concluded, is\nequivalent in cognitive significance to Hume's thought that he himself\nwrote the Treatise. But Fregeanism entails that there is such\na thought. So Fregeanism is false. \n\nSo far we have focused on Perry's case against Fregean accounts of\nindexicals in thought and language. Let's move briefly to Perry's\npositive, anti-Fregean view of indexicality. Perry's views have gone\nthrough important and often drastic changes from his early views in\n(1977) and (1979) to his later views in his (2001), which we shall not try to\nsort out here, focusing primarily on the earlier view. A view broadly\nsimilar to Perry's early view is developed in Kaplan 1977/1989,\nwhere Kaplan distinguishes content and character, claiming that the\nlatter captures the cognitive significance of an expression and the\nformer is the bearer of truth value and the object of the\npropositional attitudes, often being a singular proposition. Perry\ninitially (1977) distinguished “thoughts” and\n“senses,” but later (1979) and (1980a/b) made the same\ndistinction in terms of belief contents and belief states. (Perry also\ninitially identified the “thought” associated with an\nexpression with its role, which is proven false by cases like the\nEnterprise case discussed above. If an expression's role is identified\nwith its linguistic meaning, then the two occurrences of\n‘this’ surely have the same role. The two utterances of\n‘this’ have distinct associated demonstrations, but\ndemonstrations are not part of linguistic meaning.) The core idea is\nthat an adequate account of indexicality in thought and language\ninvolves two distinct items, one that is roughly characterized by\nTruth and Attitude —\npropositions — and the other that is roughly characterized by\nAccept and is intended to capture the\n“cognitive significance” of an expression and through\nwhich propositions are grasped. The former is, in the case of\nindexical beliefs, a singular proposition. This distinction, Perry\nclaimed, is the key to solving the problems with self-locating beliefs\nthat we have discussed above; it is the Fregean's identification of\nthe items that answer to Accept,\nTruth, and Attitude that leads to\nthe problems surveyed above. \n\nLet's apply the view to the case of Heimson. What, on Perry's view,\ndistinguishes Hume from Heimson? Both Hume and Heimson are in the same\nfirst-person belief state when they say to themselves,\n‘‘I wrote the Treatise.’’\nFurthermore, the belief content Hume has when he is in that belief\nstate — namely, the singular proposition [Hume wrote the\nTreatise] — is a belief content readily available for\nHeimson to entertain as well. However, only Hume can grasp that belief\ncontent by being in a first-person belief state. When Heimson is in a\nfirst-person belief state, he grasps the distinct singular proposition\n[Heimson wrote the Treatise] and when Heimson grasps the\nsingular proposition [Hume wrote the Treatise], it is only in\nvirtue of being in a third-person belief state. Perry is thus able to\naccount for the similarities between Heimson and Hume (they are in the\nsame belief state) and what is distinctive of Hume (only he grasps the\nsingular proposition [Hume wrote the Treatise] when in a\nfirst-person belief state).  Belief states are important because they are involved in\nexplaining, predicting, and rationalizing behavior. Perry provided a\nhost of memorable cases that make this point. Here's one. Consider two\npeople who both utter to themselves the sentence ‘I am being\nattacked by a bear’. All other things being equal, both people\nwill act in similar ways. There is a common explanation of their\nbehaviors only in terms of their shared belief states, as they\napprehend distinct propositions, each believing a proposition about\nhimself. Furthermore, it is crucial to how our agents act that they\ngrasp the relevant singular proposition in a first-person way and not,\nsay, as one would if one saw one's own reflection in a mirror with the\nreflection of a bear sneaking up without realizing that the person\nbeing seen is oneself. So, explanation, prediction, and\nrationalization are all sensitive to belief states. To quote Perry on\nthis point: \nBut belief states are not contents; they are not true or false and\nthey are not what we express when we utter a sentence. We must thus\nalso recognize belief contents as distinct elements. (For further\ndiscussion of the issues raised in this section, see the entries\n indexicals and\n propositional attitude reports.) \nPeter Strawson's reduplication argument, developed in (1959,\n20–22), can be construed as an argument for singular\npropositions. Strawson used the argument to support the related thesis\nthat demonstrative identification is fundamental to our\nability to identify and hence refer to, in speech and thought,\nindividuals. Demonstrative identification of o is\nenabled by one sensibly discriminating o from other\nindividuals. So one can demonstratively identify only individuals that\none has perceived. But one can think about other individuals as\nwell. These further individuals, then, must be descriptively\nidentified. Individuals that one identifies demonstratively are\ndirectly identified and not identified in virtue of their satisfies\nqualities by which the agent conceives the object, as individuals\ndescriptively identified are. (This distinction is reminiscent of\nRussell's distinction between thought by acquaintance and thought by\ndescription. We compare Russell and Strawson in more detail below.)\nStrawson's notion of demonstrative identification is thus closely\nrelated to the notions of direct reference and singular\npropositions. \n\nA reduplication universe is one in which the same set of qualities are\ndistributed in the same pattern across two regions. There are both\ntemporal and spatial versions of reduplication. We shall focus on the\nspatial version, as Strawson does. Suppose that Sally lives in a\nreduplication universe. Sally is standing in front of Bill, thinking\nthat he has a stain on his shirt. In another region of the universe\nthere is a qualitatively identical set of circumstances. So, there is\nSally*, who is just like Sally, standing in front of Bill*, who is\njust like Bill, thinking that he has a stain on his shirt. For any\npurely qualitative condition Bill satisfies, Bill* satisfies it\ntoo. Nonetheless it seems highly intuitive that Sally is thinking\nabout Bill and not Bill* (and Sally* is thinking about Bill* and not\nBill); after all, it is Bill and not Bill* that she is standing in\nfront of and who is the obvious source of her judgment. \n\nSuppose that all forms of identification were descriptive, so that\nidentifying an object required qualitatively discerning it from all\nothers. Then, as Sally cannot discern Bill from Bill* in wholly\nqualitative terms, her thought is not determinately about Bill rather\nthan Bill*. But intuitively her thoughts are about Bill, in virtue of\nthe fact that she is in perceptual contact with Bill rather than\nBill*. This is even more clear when we consider Sally's thought about\nherself. When Sally says to herself, ‘‘I am\nhungry’’, she is thinking of herself and not Sally*. But\nif her thought about herself were in terms of purely qualitative\nconditions, then she would be unable to think determinately of herself\ninstead of Sally*. So, she must be capable of an alternative form of\nthought and identification that is distinct from and does not\npresuppose descriptive identification. Call this form of\nidentification demonstrative identification.  We have argued\nthat it is distinct from and does not depend upon descriptive\nidentification. \n\nThe argument we have presented above presupposes that Sally and Sally*\nand Bill and Bill* are numerically distinct but qualitatively\nindiscernible pairs of objects. Although many find this to be a\ngenuine possibility, thanks in large part to Max Black (1952)\nand Robert Adams (1979), there is a long tradition that\nsubscribes to the Identity of Indiscernibles (PII), according to\nwhich, for any objects x and y, if, for every\nquality F, x is F if and only if y\nis F (i.e., if x and y are qualitatively\nindiscernible), then x=y. But the argument can be\ndeveloped in such a way that it does not presuppose the falsity of\nPII. Let there be a quality that Bill and Bill* lacks. Then the\ndistinctness of Bill from Bill* is consistent with PII. But now let\nSally (and thus Sally*) be unaware of Bill's (and Bill*'s)\ninstantiating that quality. As long as Bill and Bill* are\nqualitatively indiscernible as far as Sally is concerned and\nyet intuitively Sally is thinking of Bill and not Bill*, the above\nargument for the irreducibility of demonstrative identification to\ndescriptive identification goes through, even if it is not possible\nfor there to be distinct objects with all the same qualities. \n\nSo far we have argued that demonstrative identification is not\nreducible to descriptive identification. But Strawson makes the\nstronger claim that, in the reduplication universe, descriptive\nidentification depends on demonstrative identification. To get this\nstronger claim consider an object that Sally has never perceived but\ncan intuitively think about — say, Bill's mother. Strawson\nclaims that considering this case proves false the claim “that\nwhere the particular to be identified cannot be directly located\n[i.e., cannot be demonstratively identified because it cannot be\nperceptually discriminated], its identification must rest ultimately\non description in purely general [i.e., qualitative] terms”\n(1959, 21). Bill's mother (call her Morgan) is\nqualitatively indiscernible from Bill*'s mother. So Sally is unable to\ndistinguish in purely qualitative terms Morgan from every other object\nin the universe. But intuitively she can nonetheless think of\nher. This is because Sally can demonstratively identify Bill and thus\nhave thoughts determinately about Bill as opposed to his qualitative\ntwin Bill* and then think of Morgan under the descriptive condition\nBill's mother. As Bill is directly given, this is a condition\nthat Morgan and not her qualitative twin Morgan* satisfies. Thus\nSally's ability to descriptively identify objects in the universe is\nultimately grounded in her ability to demonstrative identify some\nstock of objects, identifying other objects in virtue of the unique\nrelations they bear to members of that stock. Strawson argues that the\ngeneral way of relating objects one has not perceived to those\ndemonstratively identified is by way of spatio-temporal\nrelations. (See (1959, 22) in particular, but much of the discussion\nthat follows in chapter 1 is aimed at establishing the Kantian claim\nthat spatio-temporal relations are the privileged set of relations for\nenabling identification of particulars.) \n\nLet's grant that to have a thought determinately about an individual\nin a reduplication universe requires possessing an irreducible,\nfundamental form of demonstrative identification. What bearing does\nthat have on thought about individuals in nonreduplication universes\nand in particular thought about individuals in our universe, which we\ntake, rightly we can suppose, to be a nonreduplication\nuniverse. Although Strawson does not argue in this way, the following\nseems compelling. Grant that our universe is in fact not a\nreduplication universe. But it could have been. Had there been, in\nsome distant part of the universe, a qualitative duplicate of me and\nmy surroundings, my thought would not have taken a different form than\nit actually has. But the considerations above show that, had we been\nliving in a reduplication universe, then demonstrative identification\nwould have been irreducible and fundamental. But then it is actually\nirreducible and fundamental. \n\nWe end this section by briefly comparing Strawson's view with\nRussell's and the contemporary neo-Russellian's views. We have seen\nthat, for Russell, like Strawson, demonstrative identification plays a\ncrucial role, in the form of acquaintance. But unlike Strawson,\nRussell denies that we demonstratively identify extra-mental\nindividuals. Russell can deliver the intuitively correct results that\nSally's thoughts are determinately about Bill and not Bill*, even\nthough she is not, on Russell's view, able to demonstratively identify\nBill. This is because Sally can demonstratively identify her sense\ndata that are caused by Bill and not Bill*. On Russell's view, Sally\ndescriptively identifies even Bill, but the descriptive condition she\nemploys contains direct reference to her occurrent sense data. She is\nthus able to form a descriptive (although not purely qualitative)\ncondition that Bill satisfies and Bill* does not. For this reason,\nRussell is better able to handle the reduplication argument than the\nFregean. \n\nBoth Strawson and Russell claimed that thought about particulars is\nultimately grounded on direct reference. But they disagree about what\nwe can directly refer to, with Strawson claiming that it includes\nperceived objects in the external world and Russell that it only\nincludes mental particulars. It is important to note, however, that as\nfar as the reduplication argument is concerned, this difference is of\nlittle consequence. As long as there is a stock of individuals that\nare thought of directly and not in terms of purely qualitative\nconditions that can serve as the anchors in terms of which the\nqualitatively indiscernible objects can then be discerned, the\nintuition that Sally is thinking determinately of Bill and not Bill*\nis respected.  Strawson maintained that an agent can demonstratively identify\nonly objects that she has perceived. Neo-Russellians typically go a\nstep further, claiming that an agent can think directly about objects\nshe has not perceived in virtue of standing in the appropriate\ncommunicative chains ending in the object. So, even though you have\nnever perceived Plato, we will safely suppose, you can nevertheless\nthink directly about Plato in virtue of your standing in a\ncommunicative chain that ultimately traces back to perceptions (on the\npart of other agents in the communicative chain) of Plato. (For a\nrepresentative of this view, see Bach's (1994, chapter 2).) Some\nneo-Russellians go even further and maintain that there needn't be any\nperceptual contact at all with an object to think about it\ndirectly. (See, for example, Kaplan 1975b, where he defends the thesis\nthat the dthat-operator can transform any designating expression into\na directly referential term, competence with which enables an agent to\nthink about the designation of the original term directly. Hence, Le\nVerrier was able to think about Neptune directly despite the lack of\nperceptual contact with the planet (we will suppose) in virtue of his\ncompetence with the expression ‘dthat[the cause of the\nperturbations in Uranus's orbit]’. See also Robin Jeshion's\n(2002) for a similar view, in that she too thinks perceptual contact\nwith an object is not necessary for thinking of that object directly,\nalthough she does not appeal to Kaplan's dthat-operator. (For more on\nthese topics, see the papers collected in Jeshion 2010.) \n\nWe thus have a spectrum of views that agree that there is direct\nreference to individual in thought and language but disagree about its\nscope, from Russell's restrictive view of direct reference, according\nto which an agent can only think directly about her occurrent sense\ndata, to the liberal view of direct reference held by Kaplan and\nJeshion, according to which objects that have never been perceived can\nbe thought about directly. All of these views respect the intuition\nthat Sally's thoughts are determinately about Bill and not\nBill*. Thus, while the reduplication argument makes a powerful case\nthat there is some direct reference and hence that singular\nproposition are necessary for an adequate account of reference to\nindividuals in thought and language, it does not settle the further\nissue of how much of our thought is direct and involves the grasping\nof singular propositions and what is thought by description. That is,\nwhile the reduplication argument might settle that there are singular\npropositions, we must appeal to different considerations, like those\ninvolved in the argument from indexicals and demonstratives, to\nresolve the further issue of what individuals can be constituents of\nsingular propositions and under what conditions. \nIn sections 2–4, we discussed three sets of argument for the thesis\nthat there are singular propositions. The first, the modal argument,\nwas broadly linguistic in nature and the other two, the arguments from\nindexicals and reduplication, were pyschological. But singular\npropositions also give rise to a number of important metaphysical\nproblems, in addition to those involving propositional attitudes and\napparent substitution failures already discussed. We end this essay by\ndiscussing two related problems: Modal problems and temporal\nproblems. \n\nConsider the following proposition.   (The number designates the proposition actually expressed by\n‘George Bush does not exist’, not the sentence itself.)\nWhile (7) is false, it might have been true. But suppose (7) is a\nsingular proposition, involving George Bush as a constituent. Then\nthere are problems, given the following two principles. \nBoth principles are highly plausible. (P1) is plausible because\nbeing true is a property and there must be something that has\na property in order for that property to be instantiated. So, had it\nbeen that a given proposition were true, then there must have been\nsomething — namely, that proposition — that would have had\nthe property of being true. (P2) states the intuitive truth conditions\nof (7), being an instance of the modalized propositional equivalent of\nthe Tarski truth-schema s is true iff s. But these\nprinciples seem to entail that, if (7) is a singular proposition, then\nit is not possibly true. For suppose it were. Then there is a world\nw in which (7) is true. By (P1), (7) exists in\nw. But then all of its constituents exists in\nw as well, as a complex does not exist in a world\nunless all of its constituents exist in that world. But then George\nBush exists in w. So, by (P2), (7) is not true in\nw, which contradicts our original assumption that it\nis true in w. So, either (7) is not a singular\nproposition or it is not possibly true. \n\nThe basic structure of this argument derives from Alvin Plantinga's\nargument from his (1983) against what he called\nexistentialism, the thesis that all individual essences are\ndependent upon the individuals that instantiate them. Plantinga\nconcluded that a singular proposition about o can\nexist even though o does not exist. (See in\nparticular (1983, 8–9), where he argued that the notion of\nconstituency is too confused to allow us to conclude that the\nconstituent of a singular proposition must exist in a world for that\nproposition to exist in that world.) Plantinga also argued that the\nproperty being identical to o can exist\nwithout o, even though that property is constructed\nby λ-abstraction from the proposition [o\nis identical to o]. Plantinga would have been much\nbetter served, we believe, by denying that propositions like (7) are\nsingular propositions, on the grounds that, if they were, they would\nnot be possibly true. Instead, propositions like (7) contain\nindividual essences as constituents. (Plantinga should not conceive of\nan individual essence as constructs form an individual identity\nproperty, as that property is dependent on the individual that\ninstantiates it. Instead, an individual essence is either a primitive\nproperty stipulated to be necessarily related to the individual whose\nessence it is or would have been that can nonetheless exist\nunexemplified or the rigidification of some condition that the\nindividual uniquely satisfies, following Plantinga's response to the\nmodal argument above in section 2.) Let H be such an\nindividual essence of Bush. Then (7) is true just in case\nH is uninstantiated, the proposition [Bush is\npresident] is true just in case H and the property\nbeing president are coinstantiated, etc.. The pay-off\nis that (7)'s being true in a possible world does not violate (P1) and\n(P2), as there are possible worlds in which Bush's individual essence\nexists but is unexemplified. \n\nThere are several responses to Plantinga's argument, differing in\ntheir metaphysical underpinnings. The first involves the possibilist's\nthesis that there are individuals that are not actual. (See Lewis's\n(1986).) In that case, what exists in a world does not exhaust what\nexists simpliciter. Bush is around to serve as a constituent of a\nproposition, even with respect to worlds in which he does not exist,\nbecause he exists simpliciter by existing in other worlds. The\npossibilist can thus claim that the truth of (P1) does not entail\nthat, if p is true in w, then\np exists in w; rather, it only\nentails that p and all its constituents\nexists. \n\nMatters are more difficult if one is an actualist, subscribing to the\nthesis that absolutely everything is actual. Then, if one accepts the\nexistence of singular propositions, one has two options. First, one\nmight deny that propositions like (7) are possibly true, accepting\nthat necessarily everything necessarily exists, as Bernard Linsky and\nEdward Zalta, in their (1994) and Timothy Williamson, in his\n(2001), do. This position is only as plausible as the\nexplanation on offer of the intuitive contingency of ordinary objects\nlike Bush. If being and existence are necessary properties, then some\ncontingent property must be offered in place that can be used to\nexplain the intuition that (7) might have been true. Linsky and Zalta\nclaim that being concrete is a contingent property. They\nclaim that Bush might have been nonconcrete and that, when we consider\na world in which he is nonconcrete, we are inclined to say that he\ndoes not exist there. Although the virtues of this view are many, not\nthe least of which is the simple and straightforward modal logic it\nvalidates, we are very reluctant to accept that concreteness is a\ncontingent property.  \n\nFinally, if one insists that propositions like (7) are singular\npropositions that are possibly true, then one must claim that (7) is\ntrue at worlds in which it does not exist, thus denying (P1). (Examples include \nAdams 1981, Deutsch 1994, Fine 1977 and\n1985, Fitch 1996, and Menzel 1991 and 1993.) A proposition\np is true in a world w just\nin case, were w actual, then p would\nhave been true. Call this inner truth. (P1) is true for inner\ntruth and there are no singular negative existential propositions like\n(7) that are true in any possible worlds. But there is another notion\nof truth with respect to a possible world that is associated with\ngenuine necessity and contingency. Adams describes this notions as\nfollows. \nThe world-story corresponding to a possibility where George Bush does\nnot exist does not, then, contain (7) as a member. Instead, (7) is\ntrue with respect to the possibility that world-story describes in\nvirtue of the world-story omitting mention of Bush altogether. From\nthe perspective of the actual world, and with its resources, we can\nsay that (7) is true at that possibility, even though, from the\nperspective of the possibility itself, there is complete silence about\nGeorge Bush. Call this outer truth. \nThe intuitive possible truth of (7) is an example of one side of our\nintuitions of the contingency of existence, being an example of the\npossible nonexistence of a thing that actually exists. An example of\nthe other side of those intuitions concerns the possible existence of\nsomething that does not actually exist. As a matter of fact, Natalie\nPortman and George Bush did not have any children together and so,\ngiven plausible essentialists intuitions, nothing that actually exists\ncould have been their child. But they could have had a child. Had\ncertain contingent happenings occurred, then there would have been a\nperson parented by Portman and Bush. So, (8) below is intuitively\ntrue. \nThe possibilist maintains that what actually exists is a proper subset\nof what exists. So, while nothing in the domain of the actual world\ncould have been Portman and Bush's child, there are things in the most\ninclusive domain of quantification, which includes merely possible\nindividuals, that are parented by Portman and Bush in some possible\nworlds. On Plantinga's view, there is an uninstantiated individual\nessence that could have been instantiated and, had it been\ninstantiated, it would have been instantiated by something that was\nparented by Portman and Bush. On Linsky and Zalta's view, there is a\nnonconcrete individual that could have been concrete and, had it been\nconcrete, it would have been parented by Portman and Bush. All three\nviews, then, seem to easily account for the truth of something close\nto (8). (The last view must offer a slight revision of (8): While a\nnonconcrete individual actually exists and could have been parented by\nPortman and Bush, nothing that is actually concrete could have been\nparented by Portman and Bush.) Proponents of the last view considered\nabove, however, do not countenance merely possible individuals,\nuninstantiated individual essences, nor contingently nonconcrete\nindividuals. Instead they must give a different account of the second\nside of our intuitions that what exists is contingent.  \n\nFollowing Adams 1981, proponents of our final view can claim that the\nactually existing quantified proposition [There is someone parented by\nPortman and Bush] is a member of a world-story corresponding to the\npossibility in which Portman and Bush have a child together, but no\natomic proposition of the form [o is parented by\nPortman and Bush] is a member of that set, as there is no such\nproposition that could have been true. (If there were such an atomic\nproposition, then there would be something that could have been\nparented by Portman and Bush, which there is not.) So, there are\nquantified propositions that are true at a possible world\nw even though there are no witnesses of those\npropositions — i.e., no corresponding singular propositions\n— true at w. This requires abandoning a general\nanalysis of the truth of quantified propositions to the truth of\natomic propositions. The best that a proponent of this account can say\nis that, had one of the possibilities in question been actual, then\nthere would have been such a singular proposition and so there would\nhave been a witness to the possibly true quantified proposition. But,\nas things actually are, the quantified proposition could have been\ntrue even though there is no singular proposition that could have been\ntrue.\n \n\nNone of the solutions considered in this section are without their\nproblems. The possibilist recognizes a distinction between existing\nand actually existing that requires a bloated ontology. Plantinga's\nsolution requires mysterious entities — individual essences that\ncould exist unexemplified and thus that are individuated independently\nof the individuals that instantiate them. Linsky and Zalta's solution\nruns contrary to the robust intuition that what individuals there\nhappen to be is a contingent matter and requires that ordinary\nexistents could exist as nonconcrete objects. And the final solution\nrequires a distinction between how matters stand in a possible world\nor from the perspective of that possible world and how matters stand\nat that world, which many find mysterious and claim to require an\nunpalatable form of realism about possible worlds. The account also\nrequires complicating one's quantified modal logic, as it entails that\nthere are theorems of classical quantificational logic (for example,\n∃x(a=x)) that are contingent, requiring either a\nrevision of classical quantificational logic, and a movement to a free\nlogic, in which case those problematic classical theorems are no\nlonger theorems, or a restriction on the standard Rule of\nNecessitation of standard modal logic, in which case there are\ncontingent logical truths. (For a more detailed discussion of the\nissues raised in this section, see the entry actualism.)  Singular propositions are a combination of the abstract and\nconcrete, which leads to problems. The modal problem arises because,\non the one hand, there are reasons to think that all propositions, as\nabstract objects, exist necessarily, but, on the other hand, it is\nhighly intuitive that ordinary individuals might not have existed and\nothers could have existed, in which case the singular propositions\ncontaining them as constituents exist contingently. The solutions to\nthis problem discussed above involve denying that there are singular\npropositions, denying that ordinary objects are contingent existents,\nor denying that propositions are necessary existents. The temporal\nproblems we shall consider in this section arise because ordinary\nindividuals change over time, including coming into and going out of\nexistence. Propositions, on the other hand, are usually taken to be\neternal objects — things that do not change over time and exist\nat all times. \n\nConsider the following proposition.  \n(9) seems like a true singular proposition, as Socrates died long\nago. How then is (9) true, as its constituent Socrates does not exist\nand so it does not exist? This is clearly the temporal analog of the\nmodal problem discussed in the previous section. Moreover, if (9) is a\nsingular proposition, then what is the constituent of (9) like? How\nold is it? Is it sitting or standing? It seems absurd to say that the\nage of a constituent of a proposition is thus and so and that it is\nsitting and not standing, yet if Socrates himself is a constituent of\n(9), then he must be a determinate age and must be in a determinate\nposition; no person exists without being a determinate age and being\nin a position. Our second set of questions also have modal analogs and\nit may help clarify the issues to present them before exploring\nanswers to the temporal problems.  \nBush in fact has two arms, but he might have had only one. But then if\nBush himself is a constituent of the proposition that Bush has two\narms, he must either have exactly two arms or exactly one arm, it\nwould seem, as no person exists without having a determinate number of\narms. But neither answer seems satisfying. This issue is related to\nproblems of temporary and accidental intrinsics. (See his (1986,\nchapter 4).)  In the next two sub-sections we consider each set of issues in\nturn. \nIn section 5 we considered the modal version of the first set of\nissues and saw how one's account is connected to\nlarger issues in the metaphysics of modality. Similarly, one's\naccount of the temporal problems is connected to larger issues in the\nmetaphysics of time. Recall the possibilist solution from section\n5. The temporal analog of possibilism is eternalism, according to\nwhich what exists at a time is but a proper subset of what exists\nsimpliciter. (Works that defend eternalism include Heller 1990,\nLewis 1986, Mellor 1981 and 1998, Quine 1963, Sider 1997 and 2001,\nSmart 1955, and Williams 1951.) The eternalist maintains that,\nalthough Socrates does not presently exist, he does exist simpliciter\nand so is available to be the constituent of (9), even at times at\nwhich he does not exist. (9) is true, then, because Socrates is in the\ndomain of a past time but not in the domain of the present time.  \n\nPresentism is the temporal analog of actualism. Presentists maintain\nthat absolutely everything is present; entities, like Socrates, that\ndo not presently exist, simply do not exist. (Works that defend\npresentism include Crisp 2002, 2005, and 2007a/b, Hinchliff 1988 and\n1996, Markosian 2003, Prior 1959, 1962, 1965, 1970, and 1977, and\nZimmerman 1996 and 1998a/b.) Presentists have a hard row to hoe in\naccounting for the apparent truth of (9). In the previous section we\noutlined three actualist accounts of (7) and (8). Each has a temporal\nanalog that can be applied to (9).  \nFirst, the presentist might appeal to Plantingian individual essences,\nclaiming that (9) is not a singular proposition containing Socrates\nhimself as a constituent, as there is no such entity, but rather a\nproposition with Socrates's individual essence as a constituent. (9)\nis then true because that individual essence was instantiated in the\npast but is no longer instantiated.  \nSecond, the presentist might claim that Socrates does exist, albeit as\na nonconcrete object, adopting the temporal analog of the view held by\nLinsky and Zalta. Then, although (9) is false, if the predicate\n‘x exists’ is regimented as\n∃y(y=x), a related proposition concerning Socrates's\nconcreteness is true. Socrates was concrete and now, while he still\nexists, is nonconcrete. (This view carries a commitment to the claim\nthat a concrete object becomes nonconcrete and that a\nnonconcrete object becomes concrete, which is even more\nproblematic than the claim that concreteness is a contingent\nproperty.) \nThird, the presentist might follow Adams and distinguish a\nproposition's being true in a time from its being true\nat a time. Consider first a negative existential about a\ncurrently existing object. It is true that George Bush did not exist\nin 1820 because the singular proposition [George Bush exists] is false\nat 1820. The proposition is not true in 1820, because it did not exist\nwhen 1820 was present, as its constituent Bush did not exist\nthen. (9), however, is a negative existential about a past object that\nno longer exists. It is, then, more analogous to (8) from above,\nillustrating the second half of our intuitions that existence is\ncontingent, than to (7). (8) has a quantificational form on its\nsurface, while (9) appears to be singular. This difference makes is\nquestionable whether appeal to the truth in/truth at distinction can\nbe used by the presentist to develop an account of (9)'s truth and\nthus whether there is a viable presentist analog to Adams's actualist\nview.  \nTo see why, focus on the first conjunct of (9): ‘Socrates\nexisted’. This appears to have the form\nP∃x(s=x), where P is the past-tense\noperator ‘it was the case that’. But that carries a\ncommitment to the wholly past object Socrates, contrary to\npresentism. The presentist must, then, reinterpret (9) so that it does\nnot involve a proposition singular with respect to Socrates, even one\nembedded in the scope of tense operators. This is problematic, as it\nentails that the sentences ‘George Bush was sitting’ and\n‘Socrates was sitting’ express propositions with radically\ndifferent forms, despite their evident surface grammatical\nsimilarity. \nFinally, there is a fourth presentist solution worth discussing, which\nalso has a modal analog not discussed in the previous section. One\nmight insist that, although Socrates does not exist, Socrates is\nnonetheless a constituent of reality, in the range of the most\nunrestricted of quantifiers and available as a constituent of singular\npropositions. This is because there are entities that do not\nexist. This form of Meinongian presentism, according to which\neverything that exists at all presently exists, although\nthere are things that do not presently exist and so do not exist at\nall, has been defended by Mark Hinchliff (Hinchliff 1988; 1996). Many\nfind the distinction between being and existing obscure and the\nMeinongian metaphysics incredible, but the view promises a solution to\nthe problems similar to possibilist and contingent concreteness\nsolutions but with an alternative metaphysics. (For further discussion\nof eternalism and presentism, see the entries spacetime: being and becoming in modern\nphysics and time. For discussion of\nMeinongianism, see existence and nonexistent objects.) \n\nWe raised two questions concerning (9). We discussed the first in\nsection 6.1 and we now turn to the second. In order to better focus\nattention on the second issues, we switch to an apparent singular\nproposition about a presently existing object, setting aside the\nissues connected with the problems of section 6.1. \nBush changes his position, sitting at t and standing at\nt'. Then (10) is true at t and false at\nt'. (Not all would agree that the proposition, as opposed to\ntensed sentence, varies its truth value across time. We discuss this\nbelow.) Suppose that (10) is a singular proposition with Bush as a\nconstituent. What is that constituent like? No answer seems to\nsatisfy. By the law of excluded middle, either it satisfies the\ncondition ‘x is sitting’ or it doesn't. If it\ndoes, then why is (10) false, as it is at t'; if it doesn't,\nthen it why is (10) true, as it is at t? It also seems\nstrange to think of that (10) itself as changing in its constituents\nacross time, as one and the same proposition is being\nevaluated at the different times. \n\nOne's answers to these questions depends on one's views on the nature\nof persistence through time and change. Broadly speaking, there are\ntwo realist views of change: Perdurantism (or four-dimensionalism or\nthe doctrine of temporal parts), which reduces persisting objects to\nmore fundamental, momentary objects, and endurantism (or\nthree-dimensionalism), which takes persisting objects as primitive,\nmaintaining that a persisting object is “wholly present”\nat each time it exists (see Crisp and Smith 2005 for an interesting\nattempt to articulate this notion). Proponents of the perdurantism\ninclude Armstrong 1980, Heller 1990, Jubien 1993, Lewis 1971, \n1976, 1986, and 1988, Quine 1960 and 1963, Robinson 1982, Russell\n1927, Smart 1955 and 1972, Taylor 1955, and Williams 1951, among\nothers. Versions of endurantism are defended in Chisholm 1976,\nForbes 1987, Geach 1966 and 1967, Haslanger 1985, 1989a/b, and 2003,\nHinchliff 1988 and 1996, Johnston 1983 and 1987, Lowe 1987, 1988, and\n1998, Mellor 1981 and 1998, Thomson 1983, van Inwagen 1990 and 2000,\nWiggins 1968, 1980, and 2001, and Zimmerman 1996 and 1998a/b, among\nothers. (There are important differences between the versions of\nendurantism defended in these works, related to whether or not\n“tense is taken seriously”, presentism is accepted or\nrejected, whether or not seemingly monadic properties like\nbeing age 64 are treated as relations between\nindividuals and times, and whether or not the instantiation relation\nbetween individuals and properties is claimed to obtain only relative\nto a time. See the entries identity over\ntime and temporal parts for\nfurther discussion.) \n\nPerdurantists maintain that a persisting object is a sum of momentary\ntemporal parts. An object persists through an interval of time by\nhaving numerically distinct temporal parts existing at each moment in\nthat interval. An object undergoes a change in its qualities across\ntime by having numerically distinct temporal parts with contrary\nqualities. A close cousin of perdurantism is the stage view, defended\nin Hawley 2001 and Sider 1996, 1997, 2000, and 2001, according to\nwhich the subject of temporal predication is a momentary temporal\npart. Whereas perdurantists claim that a name like ‘Bush’\ndesignates a sum of temporal parts, stage theorists maintain that it\ndesignates a momentary object. A past tense predication like\n‘x was sitting’ is true of that momentary stage\ns, assuming this a case of the simple past tense, just in\ncase there is an earlier temporal part that bears the counterpart\nrelation to s that satisfies the condition ‘x\nis sitting’ (and similarly for future tense predications). If\nsingular propositions are the contents of those sentences, then it is\nnatural to claim that different propositions, with different temporal\nparts as constituents, are expressed by utterances of the sentence\n‘Bush is sitting’ at different times. There are, then, two\ndistinct propositions corresponding to (10).  \n(S-102) Bush-at-t' is sitting. \n(S-101) is false simpliciter, being false both at\nt and t', while (S-102) is true\nsimpliciter. In general, then, the constituent of a singular\nproposition is a temporary object. \nProponents of perdurantism and the stage view have natural answers to\nour questions about the subject constituent of singular propositions like\n(10). Perdurantists can claim that the subject constituent of (10) is a sum of\ntemporal parts. (10) is true at t because the part of that\nsum that directly exists at t has the property of sitting;\n(10) is false at t' because the part of that sum that\ndirectly exists at t' has the property of not sitting. Stage\ntheorists can claim that there are a host of distinct propositions\ncorresponding to (10), each with a distinct momentary stage as subject\nconstituent in whatever state the object is in at the time of its\nexistence. Momentary objects have their properties absolutely. So,\nBush-at-t is simply sitting, although it will be not\nsitting in virtue of there being a numerically distinct momentary\nobject that is not sitting that is the first's later\ncounterpart. Bush-at-t' is simply not sitting, although it\nwas sitting in virtue of its earlier counterpart's\nproperties. \nThese accounts of the constituents of singular propositions concerning\nan object's changing properties presuppose theories of qualitative\nchange incompatible with the intuition that a persisting object\ndirectly bears each of its changing qualities at each time it exists,\nnot inheriting those qualities from the properties of numerically\ndistinct objects. Endurantists take this intuition as a\ncenterpiece. One and the numerically same object, endurantists\nmaintain, exists at different times and directly bearers the qualities\nthe persisting object possesses at any time. The endurantist must,\nthen, develop alternative answers to our questions about (10). \n\nOn one version of endurantism, relationalism, seemingly monadic\nproperties like sitting and not sitting are really time indexed\nproperties like sitting-at-t and not sitting-at-t',\nwhich are properties that an object simply has, instantiating them (or\nnot, as the case may be) absolutely. Unlike the original unindexed\nproperties of sitting and not sitting, these two indexed properties\nare not contraries and so there is no problem saying that one and the\nsame object simply has both of them. Like the stage theorist, the\nrelationalist claims that there are in fact a multitude of distinct\npropositions related to (10), like the following. \n(R-102) Bush is sitting-at-t'. \n\n(R-101) and (R-102) have absolute truth values,\nthe first being true simpliciter and the second false simpliciter. An\nutterance of the sentence ‘Bush is sitting’ on t\nexpresses (R-101) while an utterance of that sentence on\nt' expresses the distinct proposition\n(R-102). This much is analogous to the stage\ntheorist's account. But unlike the stage theorist, the relationalist claims\nthat there is a single object that directly bears the properties in\nquestion, the time index qualifying the property and not the subject\nof predication. So, there is a single common subject constituent to\nall of the distinct (R-10) propositions.  \n\nThe stage theorist and relationalist both reject the claim that a\npersisting object directly bears each of contrary properties it has\nwhen it undergoes a change in qualities, the stage theorist rejecting\nthat the same object directly bears the qualities at the different\ntimes and the relationalist denying that the properties are genuinely\ncontrary. Some claim that rejecting either of the claims is tantamount\nto rejecting the very notion of a thing's changing its qualities\nthrough time. A proponent of the final version of endurantism, a\ndynamic relativist, insists that one and the same object, Bush\nhimself, in the case of (10), directly bears the genuinely contrary\nproperties of sitting and not sitting. The relativist avoids\ncontradiction by claiming that an object doesn't simply have (or lack)\na property simpliciter but has (or lacks) a property relative to a\ntime. Bush has, relative to t, the property of sitting and\nlacks, relative to t', the property of not sitting. A\nproponent of this view rejects the idea that there is a single,\nfundamental, coherent way things are that transcends how things are at\na time. While there are several distinct dynamic accounts worth\ndistinguishing, what unites them all is the idea that, at the most\nfundamental level, a temporally neutral proposition like (10) is true\nat one time and false at another. A proponent of this view should be\nparticularly troubled by our question about the constituent of\n(10). While (10) is true at t and false at t', the\ntime relativization does not affect anything intrinsic to the\nproposition itself; both Bush and the property remain the same when\nthe proposition is evaluated at these different times. But then what\nis the subject constituent of (10) and what is its connection to the\nproperty of sitting?\n \nThere are two competing theories to consider. According to the bundle\ntheory, an individual is a bundle of properties. According to the\nsubstance theory, an individual is an entity distinct from its\nproperties in which those properties inhere.   One attractions of the bundle theory is its promise of explaining\npredication in terms of membership, where the object identified with a\nbundle B of properties instantiates a property\nF just in case F is among\nB. This, however, works against a relativist invoking\nthe bundle theory to answer our second problem. Suppose that the the\nsubject constituent of a singular proposition is a bundle of\nproperties. What properties are in the bundle? If the object undergoes\na change, then is (i) exactly one member of the pair of contrary\nproperties among that bundle, (ii) both properties, or is the bundle\n(iii) incomplete, containing neither of the pair? (Recall, the\nrelativist claims that it is the same proposition that is true at one\ntime and false at another and so nothing intrinsic to the proposition\nalters; it must, then, be the same bundle of properties that is the\nobject constituent in both cases.) None of the options seem\nappealing.   Suppose that, corresponding to (i), the constituent of (10)\nincludes exactly one of the contrary properties of sitting and not\nsitting: say, not sitting. Then it is hard to see how (10) is true, as\nit is at t, given that the object constituent is a bundle of\nproperties including the property of not sitting. Suppose that,\ncorresponding to (ii), both properties are among the bundle. Then it\nis hard to see how Bush exists, given that he is an inconsistent\nbundle of properties. Finally, suppose that, corresponding to (iii),\nthe bundle of properties identified with the object constituent of\n(10) contains neither of its changing contrary properties sitting nor\nnot sitting. Then, given the bundle theorist's offered theory of\npredication, (10) is not true, even at t.   \n\nConsider now the substance theory. The relativist proponent of the\nsubstance theory might claim that the object constituent of (10) is a\nbare particular, independent of all its properties in which all those\nproperties inhere. (10) can then be said to vary its truth value\nacross time, being true at t and false at t',\nwithout more ado, as the constituent of (10) neither includes nor\nexcludes sitting. (See the entry substance\nfor further discussion.) \n\nMany reject the substance theory because they think it entails that\nsomething could exist without any properties whatsoever.  While\nsubstance theorists do claim that the basic bearers of properties are\nindependent of those properties, being the entities in which\nproperties are, in the first instance, instantiated, it does not\nfollow from this that there is something that can exist without any\nproperties at all. To see why, distinguish, first, an object's\ntemporary properties (i.e., the properties it has at some times of its\nexistence and not at others) from its permanent properties. As far as\nthe problem of temporal qualitative variation goes, the constituent of\na singular proposition with o as a constituent need\nnot exclude its permanent properties and so need not be a completely\nbare particular, as the object instantiates those permanent properties\nwhenever it exists. \n\nNot all permanent properties are necessary. The property of having\nbeen conceived in Provo is a permanent property of Susan but\ncontingent, as her mother could have been elsewhere when Susan was\nconceived. In response to the modal version of our second problem, a\nsubstance theorist should claim that the constituents of singular\npropositions are independent of their contingent properties but\ninvolve their necessary properties. Where F is a\nnecessary property of o and G a\ncontingent, temporary property of o, the singular\nproposition [o is F] is true at evey\nindex while the proposition [o is G]\nis true at some times and worlds and false at\nothers. o is thus independent of its contingent but\nnot necessary properties. The substance theorist can insist, then that\nthe object constituent of (10) is not a property-less bare particular,\nbut instead an entity clad in its necessary properties. \nFinally, many substance theorists, following Aristotle, have found it\nnatural to distinguish necessary from essential properties, claiming\nthat there are some necessary properties that are accidental. For\nexample, everything necessarily has the property of being\nself-identical, but that property is a poor candidate as an essential\nproperty. A thing's essence provides its definition, answering the\nWhat is it? question. Being told that the thing is\nself-identical does not provide much by way of an answer to that\nquestion, as it does not offer grounds for distinguishing the thing in\nquestion from other things. Contrast this with the general essence of\nbeing human. Being told of some particular that it is a human does\nprovide insight into what the thing is. And the property being\nidentical to o is a good candidate for a singular\nessence. While the latter property does not so much ground the\nidentity and diversity of o as simply presuppose it,\nit is a property cognitive grasp of which constitutes an understanding\nof what o is.   A temporary, contingent singular proposition like (10) is true at\nsome indices and false at others, while a necessary singular\nproposition, like the proposition [Bush is such that 2+2=4], has the\nsame truth value at every index. Essentialist singular propositions,\nlike the proposition [Bush is human], also have the same truth value\nat every index, but, unlike mere necessary propositions, are\nintrinsically true, in the sense that an adequate account of the\nsubject position constituent, and so a full understanding of what that\nentity is involves conceiving of it as having that property, \nprovides one with the grounds to recognize it as true without further\nlogical operation or inference. An individual and its essential\nproperties may still be conceptually distinct entities for the\nsubstance theorist, the substance theorist can still claim that an\nindividual is nonetheless tightly connected to some of its\nproperties. The substance theorist can thus does not need to conceive\nof the object constituents of singular propositions as bare\nparticulars. There are compelling reasons to countenance singular propositions\nas the contents of some sentences of natural language and our\nattitudes. But singular propositions give rise to metaphysical\ndifficulties, as propositions have traditionally been taken to be\nnecessary, permanent existents, but ordinary objects are\nnot. Solutions to these difficulties require stances on general issues\nin the metaphysics of modality and time. In this essay we have\nsurveyed some of the reasons for accepting singular propositions,\nexamined the metaphysical difficulties they create, and distinguished\nseveral strategies for solving those difficulties.","contact.mail":"mnelson@ucr.edu","contact.domain":"ucr.edu"}]
