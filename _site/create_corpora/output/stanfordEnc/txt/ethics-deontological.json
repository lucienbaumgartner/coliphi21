In\ncontemporary moral philosophy, deontology is one of those kinds of\nnormative theories regarding which choices are morally required,\nforbidden, or permitted. In other words, deontology falls within the\ndomain of moral theories that guide and assess our choices of what we\nought to do (deontic theories), in contrast to those that guide and\nassess what kind of person we are and should be (aretaic [virtue]\ntheories). And within the domain of moral theories that assess our\nchoices, deontologists—those who subscribe to deontological\ntheories of morality—stand in opposition to\nconsequentialists.\n\nBecause deontological theories are best understood in contrast to\nconsequentialist ones, a brief look at consequentialism and a survey\nof the problems with it that motivate its deontological opponents,\nprovides a helpful prelude to taking up deontological theories\nthemselves. Consequentialists hold that choices—acts and/or\nintentions—are to be morally assessed solely by the states of\naffairs they bring about. Consequentialists thus must specify\ninitially the states of affairs that are intrinsically\nvaluable—often called, collectively, “the Good.”\nThey then are in a position to assert that whatever choices increase\nthe Good, that is, bring about more of it, are the choices that it is\nmorally right to make and to execute. (The Good in that sense is said\nto be prior to “the Right.”) \nConsequentialists can and do differ widely in terms of specifying the\nGood. Some consequentialists are monists about the Good. Utilitarians,\nfor example, identify the Good with pleasure, happiness, desire\nsatisfaction, or “welfare” in some other sense. Other\nconsequentialists are pluralists regarding the Good. Some of such\npluralists believe that how the Good is distributed among persons (or\nall sentient beings) is itself partly constitutive of the Good,\nwhereas conventional utilitarians merely add or average each\nperson’s share of the Good to achieve the Good’s\nmaximization. \nMoreover, there are some consequentialists who hold that the doing or\nrefraining from doing, of certain kinds of acts are themselves\nintrinsically valuable states of affairs constitutive of the Good. An\nexample of this is the positing of rights not being violated, or\nduties being kept, as part of the Good to be maximized—the\nso-called “utilitarianism of rights” (Nozick 1974). \nNone of these pluralist positions erase the difference between\nconsequentialism and deontology. For the essence of consequentialism\nis still present in such positions: an action would be right only\ninsofar as it maximizes these Good-making states of affairs being\ncaused to exist. \nHowever much consequentialists differ about what the Good consists in,\nthey all agree that the morally right choices are those that increase\n(either directly or indirectly) the Good. Moreover, consequentialists\ngenerally agree that the Good is “agent-neutral” (Parfit\n1984; Nagel 1986). That is, valuable states of affairs are states of\naffairs that all agents have reason to achieve without regard to\nwhether such states of affairs are achieved through the exercise of\none’s own agency or not. \nConsequentialism is frequently criticized on a number of grounds. Two\nof these are particularly apt for revealing the temptations motivating\nthe alternative approach to deontic ethics that is deontology. The two\ncriticisms pertinent here are that consequentialism is, on the one\nhand, overly demanding, and, on the other hand, that it is not\ndemanding enough. The criticism regarding extreme demandingness runs\nlike this: for consequentialists, there is no realm of moral\npermissions, no realm of going beyond one’s moral duty\n(supererogation), no realm of moral indifference. All acts are\nseemingly either required or forbidden. And there also seems to be no\nspace for the consequentialist in which to show partiality to one’s\nown projects or to one’s family, friends, and countrymen, leading some\ncritics of consequentialism to deem it a profoundly alienating and\nperhaps self-effacing moral theory (Williams 1973). \nOn the other hand, consequentialism is also criticized for what it\nseemingly permits. It seemingly demands (and thus, of course, permits)\nthat in certain circumstances innocents be killed, beaten, lied to, or\ndeprived of material goods to produce greater benefits for others.\nConsequences—and only consequences—can conceivably justify\nany kind of act, for it does not matter how harmful it is to\nsome so long as it is more beneficial to others. \nA well-worn example of this over-permissiveness of consequentialism is\nthat of a case standardly called, Transplant. A surgeon has five\npatients dying of organ failure and one healthy patient whose organs\ncan save the five. In the right circumstances, surgeon will be\npermitted (and indeed required) by consequentialism to kill the\nhealthy patient to obtain his organs, assuming there are no relevant\nconsequences other than the saving of the five and the death of the\none. Likewise, consequentialism will permit (in a case that we shall\ncall, Fat Man) that a fat man be pushed in front of a runaway trolley\nif his being crushed by the trolley will halt its advance towards five\nworkers trapped on the track. We shall return to these examples later\non. \nConsequentialists are of course not bereft of replies to these two\ncriticisms. Some retreat from maximizing the Good to\n“satisficing”—that is, making the achievement of\nonly a certain level of the Good mandatory (Slote 1984). This move\nopens up some space for personal projects and relationships, as well\nas a realm of the morally permissible. It is not clear, however, that\nsatisficing is adequately motivated, except to avoid the problems of\nmaximizing. Nor is it clear that the level of mandatory satisficing\ncan be nonarbitrarily specified, or that satisficing will not require\ndeontological constraints to protect satisficers from maximizers. \nAnother move is to introduce a positive/negative duty distinction\nwithin consequentialism. On this view, our (negative) duty is not to\nmake the world worse by actions having bad consequences; lacking is a\ncorresponding (positive) duty to make the world better by actions\nhaving good consequences (Bentham 1789 (1948); Quinton 2007). We thus\nhave a consequentialist duty not to kill the one in Transplant or in\nFat Man; and there is no counterbalancing duty to save five that\noverrides this. Yet as with the satisficing move, it is unclear how a\nconsistent consequentialist can motivate this restriction on all-out\noptimization of the Good. \nYet another idea popular with consequentialists is to move from\nconsequentialism as a theory that directly assesses acts to\nconsequentialism as a theory that directly assesses\nrules—or character-trait inculcation—and assesses\nacts only indirectly by reference to such rules (or character-traits)\n(Alexander 1985). Its proponents contend that indirect\nconsequentialism can avoid the criticisms of direct (act)\nconsequentialism because it will not legitimate egregious violations\nof ordinary moral standards—e.g., the killing of the innocent to\nbring about some better state of affairs—nor will it be overly\ndemanding and thus alienating each of us from our own projects. \nThe relevance here of these defensive maneuvers by consequentialists\nis their common attempt to mimic the intuitively plausible aspects of\na non-consequentialist, deontological approach to ethics. For as we\nshall now explore, the strengths of deontological approaches lie: (1)\nin their categorical prohibition of actions like the killing of\ninnocents, even when good consequences are in the offing; and (2) in\ntheir permission to each of us to pursue our own projects free of any\nconstant demand that we shape those projects so as to make everyone\nelse well off. \nHaving now briefly taken a look at deontologists’ foil,\nconsequentialist theories of right action, we turn now to examine\ndeontological theories. In contrast to consequentialist theories,\ndeontological theories judge the morality of choices by criteria\ndifferent from the states of affairs those choices bring about. The\nmost familiar forms of deontology, and also the forms presenting the\ngreatest contrast to consequentialism, hold that some choices cannot\nbe justified by their effects—that no matter how morally good\ntheir consequences, some choices are morally forbidden. On such\nfamiliar deontological accounts of morality, agents cannot make\ncertain wrongful choices even if by doing so the number of those exact\nkinds of wrongful choices will be minimized (because other agents will\nbe prevented from engaging in similar wrongful choices). For such\ndeontologists, what makes a choice right is its conformity with a\nmoral norm. Such norms are to be simply obeyed by each moral agent;\nsuch norm-keepings are not to be maximized by each agent. In this\nsense, for such deontologists, the Right is said to have priority over\nthe Good. If an act is not in accord with the Right, it may not be\nundertaken, no matter the Good that it might produce (including even a\nGood consisting of acts in accordance with the Right). \nAnalogously, deontologists typically supplement non-consequentialist\nobligations with non-consequentialist permissions (Scheffler 1982).\nThat is, certain actions can be right even though not maximizing of\ngood consequences, for the rightness of such actions consists in their\ninstantiating certain norms (here, of permission and not of\nobligation). Such actions are permitted, not just in the weak sense\nthat there is no obligation not to do them, but also in the strong\nsense that one is permitted to do them even though they are productive\nof less good consequences than their alternatives (Moore 2008). Such\nstrongly permitted actions include actions one is obligated to do, but\n(importantly) also included are actions one is not obligated to do. It\nis this last feature of such actions that warrants their separate\nmention for deontologists. \nThe most traditional mode of taxonomizing deontological theories is to\ndivide them between agent-centered versus victim-centered (or\n“patient-centered”) theories (Scheffler 1988; Kamm 2007).\nConsider first agent-centered deontological theories. According to\nagent-centered theories, we each have both permissions and obligations\nthat give us agent-relative reasons for action. An agent-relative\nreason is an objective reason, just as are agent neutral reasons;\nneither is to be confused with either the relativistic reasons of a\nrelativist meta-ethics, nor with the subjective reasons that form the\nnerve of psychological explanations of human action (Nagel 1986). An\nagent-relative reason is so-called because it is a reason relative to\nthe agent whose reason it is; it need not (although it may) constitute\na reason for anyone else. Thus, an agent-relative obligation\nis an obligation for a particular agent to take or refrain from taking\nsome action; and because it is agent-relative, the obligation does not\nnecessarily give anyone else a reason to support that action. Each\nparent, for example, is commonly thought to have such special\nobligations to his/her child, obligations not shared by anyone else.\nLikewise, an agent-relative permission is a permission for\nsome agent to do some act even though others may not be permitted to\naid that agent in the doing of his permitted action. Each parent, to\nrevert to the same example, is commonly thought to be permitted (at\nthe least) to save his own child even at the cost of not saving two\nother children to whom he has no special relation. Agent-centered\ntheories and the agent-relative reasons on which they are based not\nonly enjoin each of us to do or not to do certain things; they also\ninstruct me to treat my friends, my family,\nmy promisees in certain ways because they are mine,\neven if by neglecting them I could do more for others’ friends,\nfamilies, and promisees. \nAt the heart of agent-centered theories (with their agent-relative\nreasons) is the idea of agency. The moral plausibility of\nagent-centered theories is rooted here. The idea is that morality is\nintensely personal, in the sense that we are each enjoined to keep our\nown moral house in order. Our categorical obligations are not to focus\non how our actions cause or enable other agents to do evil; the focus\nof our categorical obligations is to keep our own agency free of moral\ntaint. \nEach agent’s distinctive moral concern with his/her own agency puts\nsome pressure on agent-centered theories to clarify how and when our\nagency is or is not involved in various situations. Agent-centered\ntheories famously divide between those that emphasize the role of\nintention or other mental states in constituting the morally important\nkind of agency, and those that emphasize the actions of agents as\nplaying such a role. There are also agent-centered theories that\nemphasize both intentions and actions equally in constituting the\nmorally relevant agency of persons. \nOn the first of these three agent-relative views, it is most commonly\nasserted that it is our intended ends and intended means that most\ncrucially define our agency. Such intentions mark out what it is we\nset out to achieve through our actions. If we intend something bad as\nan end, or even as a means to some more beneficent end, we are said to\nhave “set ourselves at evil,” something we are\ncategorically forbidden to do (Aquinas Summa Theologica). \nThree items usefully contrasted with such intentions are\nbelief, risk, and cause. If we predict that\nan act of ours will result in evil, such prediction is a cognitive\nstate (of belief); it is not a conative state of intention to bring\nabout such a result, either as an end in itself or as a means to some\nother end. In this case, our agency is involved only to the extent\nthat we have shown ourselves as being willing to tolerate evil results\nflowing from our acts; but we have not set out to achieve such evil by\nour acts. Likewise, a risking and/or causing of some evil result is\ndistinct from any intention to achieve it. We can intend such a\nresult, and we can even execute such an intention so that it becomes a\ntrying, without in fact either causing or even risking it. (It is,\nhowever, true that we must believe we are risking the result\nto some extent, however minimal, for the result to be what we intend\nto bring about by our act.) Also, we can cause or risk such results\nwithout intending them. For example, we can intend to kill and even\ntry to kill someone without killing him; and we can kill him without\nintending or trying to kill him, as when we kill accidentally.\nIntending thus does not collapse into risking, causing, or predicting;\nand on the version of agent-centered deontology here considered, it is\nintending (or perhaps trying) alone that marks the involvement of our\nagency in a way so as to bring agent-centered obligations and\npermissions into play. \nDeontologists of this stripe are committed to something like the\ndoctrine of double effect, a long-established doctrine of Catholic\ntheology (Woodward 2001). The Doctrine in its most familiar form\nasserts that we are categorically forbidden to intend evils such as\nkilling the innocent or torturing others, even though doing such acts\nwould minimize the doing of like acts by others (or even ourselves) in\nthe future. By contrast, if we only risk, cause, or predict that our\nacts will have consequences making them acts of killing or of torture,\nthen we might be able to justify the doing of such acts by the\nkilling/torture-minimizing consequences of such actions. Whether such\ndistinctions are plausible is standardly taken to measure the\nplausibility of an intention-focused version of the agent-centered\nversion of deontology. \nThere are other versions of mental-state focused agent relativity that\ndo not focus on intentions (Hurd 1994). Some of these versions focus\non predictive belief as much as on intention (at least when the belief\nis of a high degree of certainty). Other versions focus on intended\nends (“motives”) alone. Still others focus on the\ndeliberative processes that precede the formation of intentions, so\nthat even to contemplate the doing of an evil act impermissibly\ninvokes our agency (Anscombe 1958; Geach 1969; Nagel 1979). But\nintention-focused versions are the most familiar versions of so-called\n“inner wickedness” versions of agent-centered\ndeontology. \nThe second kind of agent-centered deontology is one focused on\nactions, not mental states. Such a view can concede that all human\nactions must originate with some kind of mental state, often styled a\nvolition or a willing; such a view can even concede that volitions or\nwillings are an intention of a certain kind (Moore 1993, Ch. 6).\nIndeed, such source of human actions in willing is what plausibly\nconnects actions to the agency that is of moral concern on the\nagent-centered version of deontology. Yet to will the movement of a\nfinger on a trigger is distinct from an intention to kill a person by\nthat finger movement. The act view of agency is thus distinct from the\nintentions (or other mental state) view of agency. \nOn this view, our agent-relative obligations and permissions have as\ntheir content certain kinds of actions: we are obligated not to\nkill innocents for example. The killing of an innocent of\ncourse requires that there be a death of such innocent, but there is\nno agency involved in mere events such as deaths. Needed for there to\nbe a killing are two other items. One we remarked on before:\nthe action of the putative agent must have its source in a willing.\nBut the other maker of agency here is more interesting for present\npurposes: the willing must cause the death of the innocent\nfor an act to be a killing of such innocent. Much (on this\nview) is loaded into the requirement of causation. \nFirst, causings of evils like deaths of innocents are\ncommonly distinguished from omissions to prevent such deaths.\nHolding a baby’s head under water until it drowns is a killing; seeing\na baby lying face down in a puddle and doing nothing to save it when\none could do so easily is a failure to prevent its death. Our\ncategorical obligations are usually negative in content: we are not to\nkill the baby. We may have an obligation to save it, but this will not\nbe an agent-relative obligation, on the view here considered, unless\nwe have some special relationship to the baby. \nSecond, causings are distinguished from allowings.\nIn a narrow sense of the word we will here stipulate, one\nallows a death to occur when: (1) one’s action merely removes\na defense the victim otherwise would have had against death; and (2)\nsuch removal returns the victim to some morally appropriate baseline\n(Kamm 1994, 1996; MacMahan 2003). Thus, mercy-killings, or euthanasia,\nare outside of our deontological obligations (and thus eligible for\njustification by good consequences) so long as one’s act: (1) only\nremoves a defense against death that the agent herself had earlier\nprovided, such as disconnecting medical equipment that is keeping the\npatient alive when that disconnecting is done by the medical personnel\nthat attached the patient to the equipment originally; and (2) the\nequipment could justifiably have been hooked up to another patient,\nwhere it could do some good, had the doctors known at the time of\nconnection what they know at the time of disconnection. \nThird, one is said not to cause an evil such as a death when\none’s acts merely enable (or aid) some other agent to cause\nsuch evil (Hart and Honore 1985). Thus, one is not categorically\nforbidden to drive the terrorists to where they can kill the policeman\n(if the alternative is death of one’s family), even though one would\nbe categorically forbidden to kill the policeman oneself (even where\nthe alternative is death of one’s family) (Moore 2008). Nor is one\ncategorically forbidden to select which of a group of villagers shall\nbe unjustly executed by another who is pursuing his own purposes\n(Williams 1973). \nFourth, one is said not to cause an evil such as a death when\none merely redirects a presently existing threat to many so that it\nnow threatens only one (or a few) (Thomson 1985). In the time-honored\nexample of the run-away trolley (Trolley), one may turn a trolley so\nthat it runs over one trapped workman so as to save five workmen\ntrapped on the other track, even though it is not permissible for an\nagent to have initiated the movement of the trolley towards the one to\nsave five (Foot 1967; Thomson 1985). \nFifth, our agency is said not to be involved in mere\naccelerations of evils about to happen anyway, as opposed to\ncausing such evils by doing acts necessary for such evils to\noccur (G. Williams 1961; Brody 1996). Thus, when a victim is about to\nfall to his death anyway, dragging a rescuer with him too, the rescuer\nmay cut the rope connecting them. Rescuer is accelerating, but not\ncausing, the death that was about to occur anyway. \nAll of these last five distinctions have been suggested to be part and\nparcel of another centuries-old Catholic doctrine, that of the\ndoctrine of doing and allowing (see the entry on\n doing vs. allowing harm)\n (Moore 2008; Kamm 1994; Foot 1967; Quinn 1989). According to this\ndoctrine, one may not cause death, for that would be a\nkilling, a “doing;” but one may fail to prevent death,\nallow (in the narrow sense) death to occur, enable another to cause\ndeath, redirect a life-threatening item from many to one, or\naccelerate a death about to happen anyway, if good enough consequences\nare in the offing. As with the Doctrine of Double Effect, how\nplausible one finds these applications of the doctrine of doing and\nallowing will determine how plausible one finds this cause-based view\nof human agency. \nA third kind of agent-centered deontology can be obtained by simply\nconjoining the other two agent-centered views (Hurd 1994). This view\nwould be that agency in the relevant sense requires both intending and\ncausing (i.e., acting) (Moore 2008). On this view, our agent-relative\nobligations do not focus on causings or intentions separately; rather,\nthe content of such obligations is focused on intended\ncausings. For example, our deontological obligation with respect\nto human life is neither an obligation not to kill nor an obligation\nnot to intend to kill; rather, it is an obligation not to\nmurder, that is, to kill in execution of an intention to\nkill. \nBy requiring both intention and causings to constitute human agency,\nthis third view avoids the seeming overbreadth of our obligations if\neither intention or action alone marked such agency. Suppose our\nagent-relative obligation were not to do some action such as\nkill an innocent –is that obligation breached by a merely\nnegligent killing, so that we deserve the serious blame of having\nbreached such a categorical norm (Hurd 1994)? (Of course, one might be\nsomewhat blameworthy on consequentialist grounds (Hurd 1995), or\nperhaps not blameworthy at all (Moore and Hurd 2011).) Alternatively,\nsuppose our agent-relative obligation were not to intend to\nkill—does that mean we could not justify forming such an\nintention when good consequences would be the result, and\nwhen we are sure we cannot act so as to fulfill such intention (Hurd\n1994)? If our agent-relative obligation is neither of these alone, but\nis rather, that we are not to kill in execution of an intention to\nkill, both such instances of seeming overbreadth in the reach of our\nobligations, are avoided. \nWhichever of these three agent-centered theories one finds most\nplausible, they each suffer from some common problems. A fundamental\nworry is the moral unattractiveness of the focus on self that is the\nnerve of any agent-centered deontology. The importance of each\nperson’s agency to himself/herself has a narcissistic flavor to it\nthat seems unattractive to many. It seemingly justifies each of us\nkeeping our own moral house in order even at the expense of the world\nbecoming much worse. The worry is not that agent-centered deontology\nis just another form of egoism, according to which the content of\none’s duties exclusively concern oneself; even so, the character of\nagent-relative duties is such that they betoken an emphasis on self\nthat is unattractive in the same way that such emphasis makes egoism\nunattractive. Secondly, many find the distinctions invited by the\nDoctrine of Double Effect and the (five versions of the) Doctrine of\nDoing and Allowing to be either morally unattractive or conceptually\nincoherent. Such critics find the differences between\nintending/foreseeing, causing/omitting, causing/allowing,\ncausing/enabling, causing/redirecting, causing/accelerating to be\nmorally insignificant. (On act/omission (Rachels 1975); on\ndoing/allowing (Kagan 1989); on intending/foreseeing (Bennett 1981;\nDavis 1984).) They urge, for example, that failing to prevent a death\none could easily prevent is as blameworthy as causing a death, so that\na morality that radically distinguishes the two is implausible.\nAlternatively, such critics urge on conceptual grounds that no clear\ndistinctions can be drawn in these matters, that foreseeing with\ncertainty is indistinguishable from intending (Bennett 1981), that\nomitting is one kind of causing (Schaffer 2012), and so forth. \nThirdly, there is the worry about “avoision.” By casting\nour categorical obligations in such agent-centered terms, one invites\na kind of manipulation that is legalistic and Jesuitical, what Leo\nKatz dubs “avoision” (Katz 1996). Some think, for example,\nthat one can transform a prohibited intention into a permissible\npredictive belief (and thus escape intention-focused forms of\nagent-relative duty) by the simple expedient of finding some other end\nwith which to motivate the action in question. \nSuch criticisms of the agent-centered view of deontology drive most\nwho accept their force away from deontology entirely and to some form\nof consequentialism. Alternatively, some of such critics are driven to\npatient-centered deontology, which we discuss immediately below. Yet\nstill other of such critics attempt to articulate yet a fourth form of\nagent-centered deontology. This might be called the “control\ntheory of agency.” On this view, our agency is invoked whenever\nour choices could have made a difference. This cuts across the\nintention/foresight, act/omission, and doing/allowing distinctions,\nbecause in all cases we controlled what happened through our\nchoices (Frey 1995). Yet as an account of deontology, this seems\nworrisomely broad. It disallows consequentialist justifications\nwhenever: we foresee the death of an innocent; we omit to save, where\nour saving would have made a difference and we knew it; where we\nremove a life-saving device, knowing the patient will die. If\ndeontological norms are so broad in content as to cover all these\nforeseeings, omittings, and allowings, then good consequences (such as\na net saving of innocent lives) are ineligible to justify them. This\nmakes for a wildly counterintuitive deontology: surely I can, for\nexample, justify not throwing the rope to one (and thus omit to save\nhim) in order to save two others equally in need. This breadth of\nobligation also makes for a conflict-ridden deontology: by refusing to\ncabin our categorical obligations by the distinctions of the Doctrine\nof Double Effect and the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing, situations of\nconflict between our stringent obligations proliferate in a\ntroublesome way (Anscombe 1962). \nA second group of deontological moral theories can be classified, as\npatient-centered, as distinguished from the\nagent-centered version of deontology just considered. These\ntheories are rights-based rather than duty-based; and some versions\npurport to be quite agent-neutral in the reasons they give moral\nagents. \nAll patient-centered deontological theories are properly characterized\nas theories premised on people’s rights. An illustrative version\nposits, as its core right, the right against being used only as means\nfor producing good consequences without one’s consent. Such a\ncore right is not to be confused with more discrete rights, such as\nthe right against being killed, or being killed intentionally. It is a\nright against being used by another for the user’s or\nothers’ benefit.  More specifically, this version of\npatient-centered deontological theories proscribes the using\nof another’s body, labor, and talent without the latter’s\nconsent. One finds this notion expressed, albeit in different ways, in\nthe work of the so-called Right Libertarians (e.g., Robert Nozick,\nEric Mack), but also in the works of the Left-Libertarians as well\n(e.g., Michael Otsuka, Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne) (Nozick 1974;\nMack 2000; Steiner 1994; Vallentyne and Steiner 2000; Vallentyne,\nSteiner, and Otsuka 2005). On this view, the scope of strong moral\nduties—those that are the correlatives of others’\nrights—is jurisdictionally limited and does not extend to\nresources for producing the Good that would not exist in the absence\nof those intruded upon—that is, their bodies, labors, and\ntalents. In addition to the Libertarians, others whose views include\nthis prohibition on using others include Quinn, Kamm, Alexander,\nFerzan, Gauthier, and Walen (Quinn 1989; Kamm 1996; Alexander 2016;\nAlexander and Ferzan 2009, 2012; Gauthier 1986; Walen 2014, 2016). \nJust as do agent-centered theories, so too do patient-centered\ntheories (such as that forbidding the using of another) seek to\nexplain common intuitions about such classic hypothetical cases as\nTrolley and Transplant (or Fat Man) (Thomson 1985). In Trolley, a\nrunaway trolley will kill five workers unless diverted to a siding\nwhere it will kill one worker. Most people regard it as permissible\nand perhaps mandatory to switch the trolley to the siding. By\ncontrast, in Transplant, where a surgeon can kill one healthy patient\nand transplant his organs to five dying patients, thereby saving their\nlives, the universal reaction is condemnation. (The same is\nby-and-large true in Fat Man, where the runaway trolley cannot be\nswitched off the main track but can be stopped before reaching the\nfive workers by pushing a fat man into its path, resulting in his\ndeath.) \nThe injunction against using arguably accounts for these contrasting\nreactions. After all, in each example, one life is sacrificed to save\nfive. Yet there appears to be a difference in the means through which\nthe net four lives are saved. In Transplant (and Fat Man), the doomed\nperson is used to benefit the others. They could not be saved in the\nabsence of his body. In Trolley, on the other hand, the doomed victim\nis not used. The workers would be saved whether or not he is present\non the second track. \nNotice, too, that this patient-centered libertarian version of\ndeontology handles Trolley, Transplant et al. differently from how\nthey are handled by agent-centered versions. The latter focus on the\nagent’s mental state or on whether the agent acted or caused the\nvictim’s harm. The patient-centered theory focuses instead on\nwhether the victim’s body, labor, or talents were the means by\nwhich the justifying results were produced. So one who realizes that\nby switching the trolley he can save five trapped workers and place\nonly one in mortal danger—and that the danger to the latter is\nnot the means by which the former will be saved—acts permissibly\non the patient-centered view if he switches the trolley even if he\ndoes so with the intention of killing the one worker. Switching\nthe trolley is causally sufficient to bring about the consequences\nthat justify the act—the saving of net four\nworkers—and it is so even in the absence of the one\nworker’s body, labor, or talents. (The five would be saved\nif the one escaped, was never on the track, or did not exist.) By\ncontrast, on the intent and intended action versions of agent-centered\ntheories, the one who switches the trolley does not act\npermissibly if he acts with the intention to harm the one\nworker. (This could be the case, for example, when the one who\nswitches the trolley does so to kill the one whom he hates, only\nknowing that he will thereby save the other five workmen.) On the\npatient-centered version, if an act is otherwise morally justifiable\nby virtue of its balance of good and bad consequences, and the good\nconsequences are achieved without the necessity of using\nanyone’s body, labor, or talents without that person’s\nconsent as the means by which they are achieved, then it is morally\nimmaterial (to the permissibility of the act but not to\nthe culpability of the actor) whether someone undertakes that\nact with the intention to achieve its bad consequences. (This is true,\nof course, only so long as the concept of using does not\nimplicitly refer to the intention of the user) (Alexander 2016).  And\nin assessing the culpability of risky conduct, any good consequences\nmust be discounted, not only by the perceived risk that they will not\noccur, but also by the perceived risk that they will be brought about\nby a using; for any such consequences, however good they otherwise\nare, cannot be considered in determining the permissibility and,\nderivatively, the culpability of acts (Alexander 2016). \nPatient-centered deontologists handle differently other stock examples\nof the agent-centered deontologist. Take the acceleration cases as an\nexample. When all will die in a lifeboat unless one is killed and\neaten; when Siamese twins are conjoined such that both will die unless\nthe organs of one are given to the other via an operation that kills\nthe first; when all of a group of soldiers will die unless the body of\none is used to hold down the enemy barbed wire, allowing the rest to\nsave themselves; when a group of villagers will all be shot by a\nblood-thirsty tyrant unless they select one of their numbers to slake\nthe tyrants lust for death—in all such cases, the\ncausing/accelerating-distinguishing agent-centered deontologists would\npermit the killing but the usings-focused patient-centered\ndeontologist would not. (For the latter, all killings are merely\naccelerations of death.) \nThe restriction of deontological duties to usings of another\nraises a sticky problem for those patient-centered deontological\ntheories that are based on the core right against using: how can they\naccount for the prima facie wrongs of killing, injuring, and\nso forth when done not to use others as means, but for some other\npurpose or for no purpose at all? The answer is that such\npatient-centered deontological constraints must be supplemented by\nconsequentialist-derived moral norms to give an adequate account of\nmorality. Killing, injuring, and so forth will usually be\nunjustifiable on a consequentialist calculus, especially if everyone’s\ninterests are given equal regard. It is when killing and injuring are\notherwise justifiable that the deontological constraint against using\nhas its normative bite over and against what is already prohibited by\nconsequentialism. (This narrowness of patient-centered deontology\nmakes it counterintuitive to agent-centered deontologists, who regard\nprohibitions on killing of the innocent, etc., as paradigmatically\ndeontological.) \nThe patient-centered version of deontology is aptly labeled\nlibertarian in that it is not plausible to conceive of not being aided\nas being used by the one not aiding. Using is an action, not a failure\nto act. More generally, it is counterintuitive to many to think that\nany of us have a right to be aided. For if there were a\nstrong (that is, enforceable or coercible) duty to aid others, such\nthat, for example, A had a duty to aid X,\nY, and Z; and if A could more effectively\naid X, Y, and Z by coercing B and\nC to aid them (as is their duty), then A\nwould have a duty to “use” B and C in\nthis way. For these reasons, any positive duties will not be\nrights-based ones on the view here considered; they will be\nconsequentially-justified duties that can be trumped by the right not\nto be coerced to perform them. \nPatient-centered deontological theories are often conceived in\nagent-neutral reason-giving terms. John has a right to the exclusive\nuse of his body, labor, and talents, and such a right gives everyone\nequal reason to do actions respecting it. But this aspect of\npatient-centered deontological theories gives rise to a particularly\nvirulent form of the so-called paradox of deontology (Scheffler 1988;\nHeuer 2011)—that if respecting Mary’s and Susan’s\nrights is as important morally as is protecting John’s rights,\nthen why isn’t violating John’s rights permissible (or\neven obligatory) when doing so is necessary to protect Mary’s\nand Susan’s rights from being violated by others?\nPatient-centered deontological theories might arguably do better if\nthey abandoned their pretense of being agent-neutral. They could\nconceive of rights as giving agent-relative reasons to each actor to\nrefrain from doing actions violative of such rights. Take the core\nright against being used without one’s consent hypothesized\nearlier. The correlative duty is not to use another without his\nconsent. If such duty is agent-relative, then the rights-based\ndeontologist (no less than the agent-centered deontologist) has the\nconceptual resources to answer the paradox of deontology. That is,\neach of us may not use John, even when such using of John would\nminimize usings of John by others in the future. Such duties are\npersonal to each of us in that we may not justify our violating such a\nduty now by preventing others’ similar violations in the\nfuture. Such personal duties are agent-centered in the sense that the\nagency of each person is central to the duties of each person, so that\nyour using of another now cannot be traded off against other\npossible usings at other times by other people. \nPatient-centered deontologies are thus arguably better construed to be\nagent-relative in the reasons they give. Even so construed, such\ndeontologies join agent-centered deontologies in facing the moral\n(rather than the conceptual) versions of the paradox of deontology.\nFor a critic of either form of deontology might respond to the\ncategorical prohibition about using others as follows: If usings are\nbad, then are not more usings worse than fewer? And if so, then is it\nnot odd to condemn acts that produce better states of affairs than\nwould occur in their absence? Deontologists of either stripe can just\ndeny that wrong acts on their account of wrongness can be translated\ninto bad states of affairs. Two wrong acts are not “worse”\nthan one. Such wrongs cannot be summed into anything of normative\nsignificance. After all, the victim of a rights-violating using may\nsuffer less harm than others might have suffered had his rights not\nbeen violated; yet one cannot, without begging the question against\ndeontological constraints, argue that therefore no constraint should\nblock minimizing harm. That is, the deontologist might reject the\ncomparability of states of affairs that involve violations and those\nthat do not. Similarly, the deontologist may reject the comparability\nof states of affairs that involve more or fewer rights-violations\n(Brook 2007). The deontologist might attempt to back this assertion by\nrelying upon the separateness of persons. Wrongs are only wrongs to\npersons. A wrong to Y and a wrong to Z cannot be\nadded to make some greater wrong because there is no person who\nsuffers this greater wrong (cf. Taurek 1977). \nThis solution to the paradox of deontology, may seem attractive, but\nit comes at a high cost. In Trolley, for example, where there is\nneither agency nor using in the relevant senses and thus no bar to\nswitching, one cannot claim that it is better to switch and save the\nfive. For if the deaths of the five cannot be summed, their deaths are\nnot worse than the death of the one worker on the siding. Although\nthere is no deontological bar to switching, neither is the saving of a\nnet four lives a reason to switch. Worse yet, were the trolley heading\nfor the one worker rather than the five, there would be no reason not\nto switch the trolley, so a net loss of four lives is no reason not to\nswitch the trolley. If the numbers don’t count, they seemingly don’t\ncount either way. \nThe problem of how to account for the significance of numbers without\ngiving up deontology and adopting consequentialism, and without\nresurrecting the paradox of deontology, is one that a number of\ndeontologists are now working to solve (e.g., Kamm 1996; Scanlon 2003;\nOtsuka 2006, Hsieh et al. 2006). Until it is solved, it will remain a\nhuge thorn in the deontologist’s side. \nSomewhat orthogonal to the distinction between agent-centered versus\npatient-centered deontological theories are contractualist\ndeontological theories. Morally wrong acts are, on such accounts,\nthose acts that would be forbidden by principles that people in a\nsuitably described social contract would accept (e.g., Rawls 1971;\nGauthier 1986), or that would be forbidden only by principles that\nsuch people could not “reasonably reject” (e.g., Scanlon\n2003). \nIn deontology, as elsewhere in ethics, is not entirely clear whether a\ncontractualist account is really normative as opposed to metaethical.\nIf such account is a first order normative account, it is probably\nbest construed as a patient-centered deontology; for the central\nobligation would be to do onto others only that to which they have\nconsented. But so construed, modern contractualist accounts would\nshare the problems that have long bedeviled historical social contract\ntheories: how plausible is it that the “moral magic” of\nconsent is the first principle of morality? And how much of what is\ncommonly regarded as permissible to do to people can (in any realistic\nsense of the word) be said to be actually consented to by them,\nexpressly or even implicitly? \nIn fact modern contractualisms look meta-ethical, and not normative.\nThomas Scanlon’s contractualism, for example, which posits at its core\nthose norms of action that we can justify to each other, is best\nconstrued as an ontological and epistemological account of moral\nnotions. The same may be said of David Gauthier’s contractualism. Yet\nso construed, metaethical contractualism as a method for deriving\nmoral norms does not necessarily lead to deontology as a first order\nethics. John Harsanyi, for example, argues that parties to the social\ncontract would choose utilitarianism over the principles John Rawls\nargues would be chosen (Harsanyi 1973). Nor is it clear that\nmeta-ethical contractualism, when it does generate a deontological\nethic, favors either an agent centered or a patient centered version\nof such an ethic. \nIf any philosopher is regarded as central to deontological moral\ntheories, it is surely Immanuel Kant. Indeed, each of the branches of\ndeontological ethics—the agent-centered, the patient-centered,\nand the contractualist—can lay claim to being Kantian. \nThe agent-centered deontologist can cite Kant’s locating the moral\nquality of acts in the principles or maxims on which the agent acts\nand not primarily in those acts’ effects on others. For Kant, the only\nthing unqualifiedly good is a good will (Kant 1785). The\npatient-centered deontologist can, of course, cite Kant’s injunction\nagainst using others as mere means to one’s end (Kant 1785). And the\ncontractualist can cite, as Kant’s contractualist element, Kant’s\ninsistence that the maxims on which one acts be capable of being\nwilled as a universal law—willed by all rational agents (Kant\n1785). (See generally the entry on\n Kant.) \nHaving canvassed the two main types of deontological theories\n(together with a contractualist variation of each), it is time to\nassess deontological morality more generally. On the one hand,\ndeontological morality, in contrast to consequentialism, leaves space\nfor agents to give special concern to their families, friends, and\nprojects. At least that is so if the deontological morality contains\nno strong duty of general beneficence, or, if it does, it places a cap\non that duty’s demands. Deontological morality, therefore, avoids the\noverly demanding and alienating aspects of consequentialism and\naccords more with conventional notions of our moral duties. \nLikewise, deontological moralities, unlike most views of\nconsequentialism, leave space for the supererogatory. A deontologist\ncan do more that is morally praiseworthy than morality demands. A\nconsequentialist cannot, assuming none of the consequentialists’\ndefensive maneuvers earlier referenced work. For such a pure or simple\nconsequentialist, if one’s act is not morally demanded, it is morally\nwrong and forbidden. Whereas for the deontologist, there are acts that\nare neither morally wrong nor demanded, some—but only\nsome—of which are morally praiseworthy. \nAs we have seen, deontological theories all possess the strong\nadvantage of being able to account for strong, widely shared moral\nintuitions about our duties better than can consequentialism. The\ncontrasting reactions to Trolley, Fat Man, Transplant, and other\nexamples earlier given, are illustrative of this. \nFinally, deontological theories, unlike consequentialist ones, have\nthe potential for explaining why certain people have moral standing to\ncomplain about and hold to account those who breach moral duties. For\nthe moral duties typically thought to be deontological in\ncharacter—unlike, say, duties regarding the\nenvironment—are duties to particular people, not duties\nto bring about states of affairs that no particular person has an\nindividual right to have realized. \nOn the other hand, deontological theories have their own weak spots.\nThe most glaring one is the seeming irrationality of our having duties\nor permissions to make the world morally worse. Deontologists need\ntheir own, non-consequentialist model of rationality, one that is a\nviable alternative to the intuitively plausible,\n“act-to-produce-the-best-consequences” model of\nrationality that motivates consequentialist theories. Until this is\ndone, deontology will always be paradoxical. There are several\ndistinct hurdles that the deontologist must overcome. \nOne hurdle is to confront the apparent fact that careful reflection\nabout the degrees of wrongdoing that are possible under any single\nmoral norm does not make it easy to see deontological morality as\nconsisting of general, canonically-formulated texts (conformity to\nwhich could then be said to constitute the distrinct form of practical\nrationality unique to deontological ethics); rather, such apparently\nsimple texts as, “thou shalt not murder,” look more like\nmere epistemic aids summarizing a much more nuanced and detailed (and\nthus less text-like) moral reality (Hurd and Moore\nforthcoming). \nA second hurdle is to find an answer to the inevitable question of\nauthority, assuming that there are such general texts. If it is\nrational to conform one’s behavior and one’s choices to certain\ngeneral texts, as deontology claims, it is always in point to demand\nthe reasons making such texts authoritative for one’s\ndecisions. Deferring one’s own best judgment to the judgment enshrined\nin some text is always prima facie paradoxical (see the entry on\n authority)\n and deontologists like everybody else need to justify such deference.\nHopefully they can do so other than by reference to some person-like\nbut omniscient Deity as the supposed source of such texts, because\nmany deontologists cannot accept such theism (Moore 1995). Moreover,\neven for those with theistic commitments, they may prefer to join\nKant’s insistence that ethics proceed from reason alone, even in a\ntheistic world. \nThe third hurdle exists even if the first two are crossed\nadequately. This hurdle is to deal with the seeming demand of\ndeontological ethics that on occasion one’s categorical obligations\nrequire one to preserve the purity of one’s own moral agency at the\ncost of having one’s actions make the world be in a morally worse\nstate of affairs—at least, “worse” in the agent-neutral sense of\nthe word used by consequentialists. Patient-centered versions of\ndeontology cannot easily escape this problem, as we have shown. It is\nnot even clear that they have the conceptual resources to make agency\nimportant enough to escape this moral paradox. Yet even agent-centered\nversions face this paradox; having the conceptual resources (of agency\nand agent-relative reasons) is not the same as making it plausible\njust how a secular, objective morality can allow each person’s agency\nto be so uniquely crucial to that person. \nMoreover, it is crucial for deontologists to deal with the conflicts\nthat seem to exist between certain duties, and between certain rights.\nFor more information, please see the entry on\n moral dilemmas.\n Kant’s bold proclamation that “a conflict of duties is\ninconceivable” (Kant 1780, p. 25) is the conclusion\nwanted, but reasons for believing it are difficult to produce. The\nintending/foreseeing, doing/allowing, causing/aiding, and related\ndistinctions certainly reduce potential conflicts for the\nagent-centered versions of deontology; whether they can totally\neliminate such conflicts is a yet unresolved question. \nOne well known approach to deal with the possibility of conflict\nbetween deontological duties is to reduce the categorical force of\nsuch duties to that of only “prima facie” duties\n(Ross 1930, 1939). This idea is that conflict between merely prima\nfacie duties is unproblematic so long as it does not infect what\none is categorically obligated to do, which is what overall, concrete\nduties mandate. Like other softenings of the categorical force of\ndeontological obligation we mention briefly below (threshold\ndeontology, mixed views), the prima facie duty view is in\nsome danger of collapsing into a kind of consequentialism. This\ndepends on whether “prima facie” is read\nepistemically or not, and on (1) whether any good consequences are\neligible to justify breach of prima facie duties; (2) whether\nonly such consequences over some threshold can do so; or (3) whether\nonly threatened breach of other deontological duties can do so. \nThirdly, there is the manipulability worry mentioned before with\nrespect to agent-centered versions of deontology. To the extent\npotential conflict is eliminated by resort to the Doctrine of Double\nEffect, the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing, and so forth (and it is\nnot clear to what extent patient-centered versions rely on these\ndoctrines and distinctions to mitigate potential conflict), then a\npotential for “avoision” is opened up. Such avoision is\nthe manipulation of means (using omissions, foresight, risk,\nallowings, aidings, acceleratings, redirectings, etc.) to achieve\npermissibly what otherwise deontological morality would forbid (see\nKatz 1996). Avoision is an undesirable feature of any ethical system\nthat allows such strategic manipulation of its doctrines. \nFourth, there is what might be called the paradox of relative\nstringency. There is an aura of paradox in asserting that all\ndeontological duties are categorical—to be done no matter the\nconsequences—and yet asserting that some of such duties are more\nstringent than others. A common thought is that “there cannot be\ndegrees of wrongness with intrinsically wrong acts…”\n(Frey 1995, p. 78, n.3; also Hurka 2019). Yet relative\nstringency—“degrees of wrongness”—seems forced\nupon the deontologist by one if not two considerations. First, duties\nof differential stringency can be weighed against one another if there\nis conflict between them, so that a conflict-resolving, overall duty\nbecomes possible if duties can be more or less stringent. Second, when\nwe punish for the wrongs consisting in our violation of deontological\nduties, we (rightly) do not punish all violations equally. The greater\nthe wrong, the greater the punishment deserved; and relative\nstringency of duty violated (or importance of rights) seems the best\nway of making sense of greater versus lesser wrongs (Hurd and Moore\nforthcoming). \nFifth, there are situations—unfortunately not all of them\nthought experiments—where compliance with deontological norms\nwill bring about disastrous consequences. To take a stock example of\nmuch current discussion, suppose that unless A violates the\ndeontological duty not to torture an innocent person (B),\nten, or a thousand, or a million other innocent people will die\nbecause of a hidden nuclear device. If A is forbidden by\ndeontological morality from torturing B, many would regard\nthat as a reductio ad absurdum of deontology. \nDeontologists have six possible ways of dealing with such “moral\ncatastrophes” (although only two of these are very plausible).\nFirst, they can just bite the bullet and declare that sometimes doing\nwhat is morally right will have tragic results but that allowing such\ntragic results to occur is still the right thing to do. Complying with\nmoral norms will surely be difficult on those occasions, but the moral\nnorms apply nonetheless with full force, overriding all other\nconsiderations. We might call this the Kantian response, after Kant’s\nfamous hyperbole: “Better the whole people should perish,”\nthan that injustice be done (Kant 1780, p. 100). One might also\ncall this the absolutist conception of deontology, because such a view\nmaintains that conformity to norms has absolute force and not merely\ngreat weight. \nThis first response to “moral catastrophes,” which is to\nignore them, might be further justified by denying that moral\ncatastrophes, such as a million deaths, are really a million times\nmore catastrophic than one death. This is the so-called\n“aggregation” problem, which we alluded to in\n section 2.2\n in discussing the paradox of deontological constraints. John Taurek\nfamously argued that it is a mistake to assume harms to two persons\nare twice as bad as a comparable harm to one person. For each of the\ntwo suffers only his own harm and not the harm of the other (Taurek\n1977). Taurek’s argument can be employed to deny the existence of\nmoral catastrophes and thus the worry about them that deontologists\nwould otherwise have. Robert Nozick also stresses the separateness of\npersons and therefore urges that there is no entity that suffers\ndouble the harm when each of two persons is harmed (Nozick 1974). (Of\ncourse, Nozick, perhaps inconsistently, also acknowledges the\nexistence of moral catastrophes.) Most deontologists reject Taurek’s\nradical conclusion that we need not be morally more obligated to avert\nharm to the many than to avert harm to the few; but they do accept the\nnotion that harms should not be aggregated. Deontologists’ approaches\nto the nonaggregation problem when the choice is between saving the\nmany and saving the few are: (1) save the many so as to acknowledge\nthe importance of each of the extra persons; (2) conduct a weighted\ncoin flip; (3) flip a coin; or (4) save anyone you want (a denial of\nmoral catastrophes) (Broome 1998; Doggett 2013; Doucet 2013; Dougherty\n2013; Halstead 2016: Henning 2015; Hirose 2007, 2015; Hsieh et al.\n2006; Huseby 2011; Kamm 1993; Rasmussen 2012; Saunders 2009; Scanlon\n2003; Suikkanen 2004; Timmerman 2004; Wasserman and Strudler\n2003). \nThe second plausible response is for the deontologist to abandon\nKantian absolutism for what is usually called “threshold\ndeontology.” A threshold deontologist holds that deontological\nnorms govern up to a point despite adverse consequences; but when the\nconsequences become so dire that they cross the stipulated threshold,\nconsequentialism takes over (Moore 1997, ch. 17). A\nmay not torture B to save the lives of two others, but he may\ndo so to save a thousand lives if the “threshold” is\nhigher than two lives but lower than a thousand. \nThere are two varieties of threshold deontology that are worth\ndistinguishing. On the simple version, there is some fixed threshold\nof awfulness beyond which morality’s categorical norms no longer have\ntheir overriding force. Such a threshold is fixed in the sense that it\ndoes not vary with the stringency of the categorical duty being\nviolated. The alternative is what might be called “sliding scale\nthreshold deontology.” On this version, the threshold varies in\nproportion to the degree of wrong being done—the wrongness of\nstepping on a snail has a lower threshold (over which the wrong can be\njustified) than does the wrong of stepping on a baby. \nThreshold deontology (of either stripe) is an attempt to save\ndeontological morality from the charge of fanaticism. It is similar to\nthe “prima facie duty” version of deontology\ndeveloped to deal with the problem of conflicting duties, yet\nthreshold deontology is usually interpreted with such a high threshold\nthat it more closely mimics the outcomes reached by a\n“pure,” absolutist kind of deontology. Threshold\ndeontology faces several theoretical difficulties. Foremost among them\nis giving a theoretically tenable account of the location of such a\nthreshold, either absolutely or on a sliding scale (Alexander 2000;\nEllis 1992; Moore 2019; Arneson 2019; Cole 2019; Alexander 2019). Why\nis the threshold for torture of the innocent at one thousand lives,\nsay, as opposed to nine hundred or two thousand? Another problem is\nthat whatever the threshold, as the dire consequences approach it,\ncounter-intuitive results appear to follow. For example, it may be\npermissible, if we are one-life-at-risk short of the threshold, to\npull one more person into danger who will then be saved, along with\nthe others at risk, by killing an innocent person (Alexander 2000).\nThirdly, there is some uncertainty about how one is to reason after\nthe threshold has been reached: are we to calculate at the margin on\nstraight consequentialist grounds, use an agent-weighted mode of\nsumming, or do something else? A fourth problem is that threshold\ndeontology threatens to collapse into a kind of consequentialism.\nIndeed, it can be perhaps shown that the sliding scale version of\nthreshold deontology is extensionally equivalent to an agency-weighted\nform of consequentialism (Sen 1982). \nThe remaining four strategies for dealing with the problem of dire\nconsequence cases all have the flavor of evasion by the deontologist.\nConsider first the famous view of Elizabeth Anscombe: such cases (real\nor imagined) can never present themselves to the consciousness of a\ntruly moral agent because such agent will realize it is immoral to\neven think about violating moral norms in order to avert disaster\n(Anscombe 1958; Geach 1969; Nagel 1979). Such rhetorical excesses\nshould be seen for what they are, a peculiar way of stating Kantian\nabsolutism motivated by an impatience with the question. \nAnother response by deontologists, this one most famously associated\nwith Bernard Williams, shares some of the “don’t think about\nit” features of the Anscombean response. According to Williams\n(1973), situations of moral horror are simply “beyond\nmorality,” and even beyond reason. (This view is reminiscent of\nthe ancient view of natural necessity, revived by Sir Francis Bacon,\nthat such cases are beyond human law and can only be judged by the\nnatural law of instinct.) Williams tells us that in such cases we just\nact. Interestingly, Williams contemplates that such\n“existentialist” decision-making will result in our doing\nwhat we have to do in such cases—for example, we torture the\ninnocent to prevent nuclear holocaust. \nSurely this is an unhappy view of the power and reach of human law,\nmorality, or reason. Indeed, Williams (like Bacon and Cicero before\nhim) thinks there is an answer to what should be done, albeit an\nanswer very different than Anscombe’s. But both views share the\nweakness of thinking that morality and even reason runs out on us when\nthe going gets tough. \nYet another strategy is to divorce completely the moral appraisals of\nacts from the blameworthiness or praiseworthiness of the agents who\nundertake them, even when those agents are fully cognizant of the\nmoral appraisals. So, for example, if A tortures innocent\nB to save a thousand others, one can hold that A’s\nact is morally wrong but also that A is morally praiseworthy\nfor having done it. \nDeontology does have to grapple with how to mesh deontic judgments of\nwrongness with “hypological” (Zimmerman 2002) judgments of\nblameworthiness (Alexander 2004). Yet it would be an oddly cohering\nmorality that condemned an act as wrong yet praised the doer of it.\nDeontic and hypological judgments ought to have more to do with each\nother than that. Moreover, it is unclear what action-guiding potential\nsuch an oddly cohered morality would have: should an agent facing such\na choice avoid doing wrong, or should he go for the praise? \nThe last possible strategy for the deontologist in order to deal with\ndire consequences, other than by denying their existence, as per\nTaurek, is to distinguish moral reasons from all-things-considered\nreasons and to argue that whereas moral reasons dictate obedience to\ndeontological norms even at the cost of catastrophic consequences,\nall-things-considered reasons dictate otherwise. (This is one reading\nof Bernard William’s famous discussion of moral luck, where non-moral\nreasons seemingly can trump moral reasons (Williams 1975, 1981); this\nis also a strategy some consequentialists (e.g., Portmore 2003) seize\nas well in order to handle the demandingness and alienation problems\nendemic to consequentialism.) But like the preceding strategy, this\none seems desperate. Why should one even care that moral reasons align\nwith deontology if the important reasons, the all-things-considered\nreasons that actually govern decisions, align with\nconsequentialism? \nThe perceived weaknesses of deontological theories have led some to\nconsider how to eliminate or at least reduce those weaknesses while\npreserving deontology’s advantages. One way to do this is to embrace\nboth consequentialism and deontology, combining them into some kind of\na mixed theory. Given the differing notions of rationality underlying\neach kind of theory, this is easier said than done. After all, one\ncannot simply weigh agent-relative reasons against agent-neutral\nreasons, without stripping the former sorts of reasons of their\ndistinctive character. \nA time-honored way of reconciling opposing theories is to allocate\nthem to different jurisdictions. Tom Nagel’s reconciliation of the two\ntheories is a version of this, inasmuch as he allocates the\nagent-neutral reasons of consequentialism to our\n“objective” viewpoint, whereas the agent-relative reasons\nof deontology are seen as part of our inherent subjectivity (Nagel\n1986). Yet Nagel’s allocations are non-exclusive; the same situation\ncan be seen from either subjective or objective viewpoints, meaning\nthat it is mysterious how we are to combine them into some overall\nview. \nA less mysterious way of combining deontology with consequentialism is\nto assign to each a jurisdiction that is exclusive of the other. One\npossibility here is to regard the agent-neutral reasons of\nconsequentialism as a kind of default rationality/morality in the\nsense that when an agent-relative permission or obligation applies, it\ngoverns, but in the considerable logical space where neither applies,\nconsequentialism holds sway (Moore 2008). Remembering that for the\nthreshold deontologist, consequentialist reasons may still determine\nright action even in areas governed by agent-relative obligations or\npermissions, once the level of bad consequences crosses the relevant\nthreshold (Moore 2012). \nIn contrast to mixed theories, deontologists who seek to keep their\ndeontology pure hope to expand agent-relative reasons to cover all of\nmorality and yet to mimic the advantages of consequentialism. Doing\nthis holds out the promise of denying sense to the otherwise damning\nquestion, how could it be moral to make (or allow) the world to be\nworse (for they deny that there is any states-of-affairs\n“worseness” in terms of which to frame such a question)\n(Foot 1985). To make this plausible, one needs to expand the coverage\nof agent-relative reasons to cover what is now plausibly a matter of\nconsequentialist reasons, such as positive duties to strangers.\nMoreover, deontologists taking this route need a content to the\npermissive and obligating norms of deontology that allows them to\nmimic the outcomes making consequentialism attractive. This requires a\npicture of morality’s norms that is extremely detailed in content, so\nthat what looks like a consequentialist balance can be generated by a\ncomplex series of norms with extremely detailed priority rules and\nexception clauses (Richardson 1990). Few consequentialists will\nbelieve that this is a viable enterprise. \nThe mirror image of the pure deontologist just described is the\nindirect or two-level consequentialist. For this view too seeks to\nappropriate the strengths of both deontology and consequentialism, not\nby embracing both, but by showing that an appropriately defined\nversion of one can do for both. The indirect consequentialist, of\ncourse, seeks to do this from the side of consequentialism alone. \nYet as many have argued (Lyons 1965; Alexander 1985), indirect\nconsequentialism collapses either into: blind and irrational\nrule-worship (“why follow the rules when not doing so produces\nbetter consequences?”); direct consequentialism (“acts in\nconformity to the rules rather miraculously produce better\nconsequences in the long run”); or nonpublicizability\n(“ordinary folks should be instructed to follow the rules but\nshould not be told of the ultimate consequentialist basis for doing\nso, lest they depart from the rules mistakenly believing better\nconsequences will result”). For more information, please see the\nentry on\n rule consequentialism.\n Nor can the indirect consequentialist adequately explain why those\nwho violate the indirect consequentialist’s rules have\n“wronged” those who might be harmed as a result, that is,\nwhy the latter have a personal complaint against the former. (This is\ntrue irrespective of whether the rule-violation produces good\nconsequences; but it is especially so when good consequences result\nfrom the rule-violation.) The bottom line is that if deontology has\nintuitive advantages over consequentialism, it is far from obvious\nwhether those advantages can be captured by moving to indirect\nconsequentialism, even if there is a version of indirect\nconsequentialism that could avoid the dire consequences problem that\nbedevils deontological theories. \nRecently, deontologists have begun to ask how an actor should evaluate\ncourses of action in which it is uncertain whether a deontological\nconstraint will be violated. For example, should one detonate dynamite\nin a mining operation if there is a chance that the explosion will\ncause the Fat Man to tumble into the path of the trolley that would\notherwise kill five? (Assume that were the chance the same that the\nexplosion would instead divert the trolley in Trolley, killing one but\nsaving five, the detonation would be permissible.) Or should one take\na drive to observe the scenery if there is a slightly increased chance\nthat, because of the possibility of traffic, doing so will cause one\nto miss a lunch one had promised to attend? Whether deontological\nconstraints focus on agents’ intentions or beliefs, or whether they\nfocus on agents’ counting positively in their deliberations others’\nuse as means, how should the uncertainty of outcomes be taken into\naccount by deontologists? This question has been addressed by Aboodi,\nBorer, and Enoch (2008); Alexander (2016; 2018); Lazar (2015; 2017a,\n2017b, 2018); Smith (2014); Tarsney (2018); and Tomlin (2019). \nDeontological theories are normative theories. They do not presuppose\nany particular position on moral ontology or on moral epistemology.\nPresumably, a deontologist can be a moral realist of either the\nnatural (moral properties are identical to natural properties) or\nnonnatural (moral properties are not themselves natural properties\neven if they are nonreductively related to natural properties)\nvariety. Or a deontologist can be an expressivist, a constructivist, a\ntranscendentalist, a conventionalist, or a Divine command theorist\nregarding the nature of morality. Likewise, a deontologist can claim\nthat we know the content of deontological morality by direct\nintuition, by Kantian reflection on our normative situation, or by\nreaching reflective equilibrium between our particular moral judgments\nand the theories we construct to explain them (theories of\nintuitions). \nNonetheless, although deontological theories can be agnostic regarding\nmetaethics, some metaethical accounts seem less hospitable than others\nto deontology. For example, the stock furniture of deontological\nnormative ethics—rights, duties, permissions—fits uneasily\nin the realist-naturalist’s corner of the metaethical universe. (Which\nis why many naturalists, if they are moral realists in their\nmeta-ethics, are consequentialists in their ethics.) Nonnatural\nrealism, conventionalism, transcendentalism, and Divine command seem\nmore hospitable metaethical homes for deontology. (For example, the\nparadox of deontology above discussed may seem more tractable if\nmorality is a matter of personal directives of a Supreme Commander to\neach of his human subordinates.) If these rough connections hold, then\nweaknesses with those metaethical accounts most hospitable to\ndeontology will weaken deontology as a normative theory of action.\nSome deontologists have thus argued that these connections need not\nhold and that a naturalist-realist meta-ethics can ground a\ndeontological ethics (Moore 2004).","contact.mail":"larrya@sandiego.edu","contact.domain":"sandiego.edu"},{"date.published":"2007-11-21","date.changed":"2020-10-30","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/","author1":"Larry Alexander","author2":"Michael Moore","author1.info":"https://www.sandiego.edu/law/faculty/profiles/bio.php?ID=681","entry":"ethics-deontological","body.text":"\n\n\nThe word deontology derives from the Greek words for duty\n(deon) and science (or study) of (logos). In\ncontemporary moral philosophy, deontology is one of those kinds of\nnormative theories regarding which choices are morally required,\nforbidden, or permitted. In other words, deontology falls within the\ndomain of moral theories that guide and assess our choices of what we\nought to do (deontic theories), in contrast to those that guide and\nassess what kind of person we are and should be (aretaic [virtue]\ntheories). And within the domain of moral theories that assess our\nchoices, deontologists—those who subscribe to deontological\ntheories of morality—stand in opposition to\nconsequentialists.\n\nBecause deontological theories are best understood in contrast to\nconsequentialist ones, a brief look at consequentialism and a survey\nof the problems with it that motivate its deontological opponents,\nprovides a helpful prelude to taking up deontological theories\nthemselves. Consequentialists hold that choices—acts and/or\nintentions—are to be morally assessed solely by the states of\naffairs they bring about. Consequentialists thus must specify\ninitially the states of affairs that are intrinsically\nvaluable—often called, collectively, “the Good.”\nThey then are in a position to assert that whatever choices increase\nthe Good, that is, bring about more of it, are the choices that it is\nmorally right to make and to execute. (The Good in that sense is said\nto be prior to “the Right.”) \nConsequentialists can and do differ widely in terms of specifying the\nGood. Some consequentialists are monists about the Good. Utilitarians,\nfor example, identify the Good with pleasure, happiness, desire\nsatisfaction, or “welfare” in some other sense. Other\nconsequentialists are pluralists regarding the Good. Some of such\npluralists believe that how the Good is distributed among persons (or\nall sentient beings) is itself partly constitutive of the Good,\nwhereas conventional utilitarians merely add or average each\nperson’s share of the Good to achieve the Good’s\nmaximization. \nMoreover, there are some consequentialists who hold that the doing or\nrefraining from doing, of certain kinds of acts are themselves\nintrinsically valuable states of affairs constitutive of the Good. An\nexample of this is the positing of rights not being violated, or\nduties being kept, as part of the Good to be maximized—the\nso-called “utilitarianism of rights” (Nozick 1974). \nNone of these pluralist positions erase the difference between\nconsequentialism and deontology. For the essence of consequentialism\nis still present in such positions: an action would be right only\ninsofar as it maximizes these Good-making states of affairs being\ncaused to exist. \nHowever much consequentialists differ about what the Good consists in,\nthey all agree that the morally right choices are those that increase\n(either directly or indirectly) the Good. Moreover, consequentialists\ngenerally agree that the Good is “agent-neutral” (Parfit\n1984; Nagel 1986). That is, valuable states of affairs are states of\naffairs that all agents have reason to achieve without regard to\nwhether such states of affairs are achieved through the exercise of\none’s own agency or not. \nConsequentialism is frequently criticized on a number of grounds. Two\nof these are particularly apt for revealing the temptations motivating\nthe alternative approach to deontic ethics that is deontology. The two\ncriticisms pertinent here are that consequentialism is, on the one\nhand, overly demanding, and, on the other hand, that it is not\ndemanding enough. The criticism regarding extreme demandingness runs\nlike this: for consequentialists, there is no realm of moral\npermissions, no realm of going beyond one’s moral duty\n(supererogation), no realm of moral indifference. All acts are\nseemingly either required or forbidden. And there also seems to be no\nspace for the consequentialist in which to show partiality to one’s\nown projects or to one’s family, friends, and countrymen, leading some\ncritics of consequentialism to deem it a profoundly alienating and\nperhaps self-effacing moral theory (Williams 1973). \nOn the other hand, consequentialism is also criticized for what it\nseemingly permits. It seemingly demands (and thus, of course, permits)\nthat in certain circumstances innocents be killed, beaten, lied to, or\ndeprived of material goods to produce greater benefits for others.\nConsequences—and only consequences—can conceivably justify\nany kind of act, for it does not matter how harmful it is to\nsome so long as it is more beneficial to others. \nA well-worn example of this over-permissiveness of consequentialism is\nthat of a case standardly called, Transplant. A surgeon has five\npatients dying of organ failure and one healthy patient whose organs\ncan save the five. In the right circumstances, surgeon will be\npermitted (and indeed required) by consequentialism to kill the\nhealthy patient to obtain his organs, assuming there are no relevant\nconsequences other than the saving of the five and the death of the\none. Likewise, consequentialism will permit (in a case that we shall\ncall, Fat Man) that a fat man be pushed in front of a runaway trolley\nif his being crushed by the trolley will halt its advance towards five\nworkers trapped on the track. We shall return to these examples later\non. \nConsequentialists are of course not bereft of replies to these two\ncriticisms. Some retreat from maximizing the Good to\n“satisficing”—that is, making the achievement of\nonly a certain level of the Good mandatory (Slote 1984). This move\nopens up some space for personal projects and relationships, as well\nas a realm of the morally permissible. It is not clear, however, that\nsatisficing is adequately motivated, except to avoid the problems of\nmaximizing. Nor is it clear that the level of mandatory satisficing\ncan be nonarbitrarily specified, or that satisficing will not require\ndeontological constraints to protect satisficers from maximizers. \nAnother move is to introduce a positive/negative duty distinction\nwithin consequentialism. On this view, our (negative) duty is not to\nmake the world worse by actions having bad consequences; lacking is a\ncorresponding (positive) duty to make the world better by actions\nhaving good consequences (Bentham 1789 (1948); Quinton 2007). We thus\nhave a consequentialist duty not to kill the one in Transplant or in\nFat Man; and there is no counterbalancing duty to save five that\noverrides this. Yet as with the satisficing move, it is unclear how a\nconsistent consequentialist can motivate this restriction on all-out\noptimization of the Good. \nYet another idea popular with consequentialists is to move from\nconsequentialism as a theory that directly assesses acts to\nconsequentialism as a theory that directly assesses\nrules—or character-trait inculcation—and assesses\nacts only indirectly by reference to such rules (or character-traits)\n(Alexander 1985). Its proponents contend that indirect\nconsequentialism can avoid the criticisms of direct (act)\nconsequentialism because it will not legitimate egregious violations\nof ordinary moral standards—e.g., the killing of the innocent to\nbring about some better state of affairs—nor will it be overly\ndemanding and thus alienating each of us from our own projects. \nThe relevance here of these defensive maneuvers by consequentialists\nis their common attempt to mimic the intuitively plausible aspects of\na non-consequentialist, deontological approach to ethics. For as we\nshall now explore, the strengths of deontological approaches lie: (1)\nin their categorical prohibition of actions like the killing of\ninnocents, even when good consequences are in the offing; and (2) in\ntheir permission to each of us to pursue our own projects free of any\nconstant demand that we shape those projects so as to make everyone\nelse well off. \nHaving now briefly taken a look at deontologists’ foil,\nconsequentialist theories of right action, we turn now to examine\ndeontological theories. In contrast to consequentialist theories,\ndeontological theories judge the morality of choices by criteria\ndifferent from the states of affairs those choices bring about. The\nmost familiar forms of deontology, and also the forms presenting the\ngreatest contrast to consequentialism, hold that some choices cannot\nbe justified by their effects—that no matter how morally good\ntheir consequences, some choices are morally forbidden. On such\nfamiliar deontological accounts of morality, agents cannot make\ncertain wrongful choices even if by doing so the number of those exact\nkinds of wrongful choices will be minimized (because other agents will\nbe prevented from engaging in similar wrongful choices). For such\ndeontologists, what makes a choice right is its conformity with a\nmoral norm. Such norms are to be simply obeyed by each moral agent;\nsuch norm-keepings are not to be maximized by each agent. In this\nsense, for such deontologists, the Right is said to have priority over\nthe Good. If an act is not in accord with the Right, it may not be\nundertaken, no matter the Good that it might produce (including even a\nGood consisting of acts in accordance with the Right). \nAnalogously, deontologists typically supplement non-consequentialist\nobligations with non-consequentialist permissions (Scheffler 1982).\nThat is, certain actions can be right even though not maximizing of\ngood consequences, for the rightness of such actions consists in their\ninstantiating certain norms (here, of permission and not of\nobligation). Such actions are permitted, not just in the weak sense\nthat there is no obligation not to do them, but also in the strong\nsense that one is permitted to do them even though they are productive\nof less good consequences than their alternatives (Moore 2008). Such\nstrongly permitted actions include actions one is obligated to do, but\n(importantly) also included are actions one is not obligated to do. It\nis this last feature of such actions that warrants their separate\nmention for deontologists. \nThe most traditional mode of taxonomizing deontological theories is to\ndivide them between agent-centered versus victim-centered (or\n“patient-centered”) theories (Scheffler 1988; Kamm 2007).\nConsider first agent-centered deontological theories. According to\nagent-centered theories, we each have both permissions and obligations\nthat give us agent-relative reasons for action. An agent-relative\nreason is an objective reason, just as are agent neutral reasons;\nneither is to be confused with either the relativistic reasons of a\nrelativist meta-ethics, nor with the subjective reasons that form the\nnerve of psychological explanations of human action (Nagel 1986). An\nagent-relative reason is so-called because it is a reason relative to\nthe agent whose reason it is; it need not (although it may) constitute\na reason for anyone else. Thus, an agent-relative obligation\nis an obligation for a particular agent to take or refrain from taking\nsome action; and because it is agent-relative, the obligation does not\nnecessarily give anyone else a reason to support that action. Each\nparent, for example, is commonly thought to have such special\nobligations to his/her child, obligations not shared by anyone else.\nLikewise, an agent-relative permission is a permission for\nsome agent to do some act even though others may not be permitted to\naid that agent in the doing of his permitted action. Each parent, to\nrevert to the same example, is commonly thought to be permitted (at\nthe least) to save his own child even at the cost of not saving two\nother children to whom he has no special relation. Agent-centered\ntheories and the agent-relative reasons on which they are based not\nonly enjoin each of us to do or not to do certain things; they also\ninstruct me to treat my friends, my family,\nmy promisees in certain ways because they are mine,\neven if by neglecting them I could do more for others’ friends,\nfamilies, and promisees. \nAt the heart of agent-centered theories (with their agent-relative\nreasons) is the idea of agency. The moral plausibility of\nagent-centered theories is rooted here. The idea is that morality is\nintensely personal, in the sense that we are each enjoined to keep our\nown moral house in order. Our categorical obligations are not to focus\non how our actions cause or enable other agents to do evil; the focus\nof our categorical obligations is to keep our own agency free of moral\ntaint. \nEach agent’s distinctive moral concern with his/her own agency puts\nsome pressure on agent-centered theories to clarify how and when our\nagency is or is not involved in various situations. Agent-centered\ntheories famously divide between those that emphasize the role of\nintention or other mental states in constituting the morally important\nkind of agency, and those that emphasize the actions of agents as\nplaying such a role. There are also agent-centered theories that\nemphasize both intentions and actions equally in constituting the\nmorally relevant agency of persons. \nOn the first of these three agent-relative views, it is most commonly\nasserted that it is our intended ends and intended means that most\ncrucially define our agency. Such intentions mark out what it is we\nset out to achieve through our actions. If we intend something bad as\nan end, or even as a means to some more beneficent end, we are said to\nhave “set ourselves at evil,” something we are\ncategorically forbidden to do (Aquinas Summa Theologica). \nThree items usefully contrasted with such intentions are\nbelief, risk, and cause. If we predict that\nan act of ours will result in evil, such prediction is a cognitive\nstate (of belief); it is not a conative state of intention to bring\nabout such a result, either as an end in itself or as a means to some\nother end. In this case, our agency is involved only to the extent\nthat we have shown ourselves as being willing to tolerate evil results\nflowing from our acts; but we have not set out to achieve such evil by\nour acts. Likewise, a risking and/or causing of some evil result is\ndistinct from any intention to achieve it. We can intend such a\nresult, and we can even execute such an intention so that it becomes a\ntrying, without in fact either causing or even risking it. (It is,\nhowever, true that we must believe we are risking the result\nto some extent, however minimal, for the result to be what we intend\nto bring about by our act.) Also, we can cause or risk such results\nwithout intending them. For example, we can intend to kill and even\ntry to kill someone without killing him; and we can kill him without\nintending or trying to kill him, as when we kill accidentally.\nIntending thus does not collapse into risking, causing, or predicting;\nand on the version of agent-centered deontology here considered, it is\nintending (or perhaps trying) alone that marks the involvement of our\nagency in a way so as to bring agent-centered obligations and\npermissions into play. \nDeontologists of this stripe are committed to something like the\ndoctrine of double effect, a long-established doctrine of Catholic\ntheology (Woodward 2001). The Doctrine in its most familiar form\nasserts that we are categorically forbidden to intend evils such as\nkilling the innocent or torturing others, even though doing such acts\nwould minimize the doing of like acts by others (or even ourselves) in\nthe future. By contrast, if we only risk, cause, or predict that our\nacts will have consequences making them acts of killing or of torture,\nthen we might be able to justify the doing of such acts by the\nkilling/torture-minimizing consequences of such actions. Whether such\ndistinctions are plausible is standardly taken to measure the\nplausibility of an intention-focused version of the agent-centered\nversion of deontology. \nThere are other versions of mental-state focused agent relativity that\ndo not focus on intentions (Hurd 1994). Some of these versions focus\non predictive belief as much as on intention (at least when the belief\nis of a high degree of certainty). Other versions focus on intended\nends (“motives”) alone. Still others focus on the\ndeliberative processes that precede the formation of intentions, so\nthat even to contemplate the doing of an evil act impermissibly\ninvokes our agency (Anscombe 1958; Geach 1969; Nagel 1979). But\nintention-focused versions are the most familiar versions of so-called\n“inner wickedness” versions of agent-centered\ndeontology. \nThe second kind of agent-centered deontology is one focused on\nactions, not mental states. Such a view can concede that all human\nactions must originate with some kind of mental state, often styled a\nvolition or a willing; such a view can even concede that volitions or\nwillings are an intention of a certain kind (Moore 1993, Ch. 6).\nIndeed, such source of human actions in willing is what plausibly\nconnects actions to the agency that is of moral concern on the\nagent-centered version of deontology. Yet to will the movement of a\nfinger on a trigger is distinct from an intention to kill a person by\nthat finger movement. The act view of agency is thus distinct from the\nintentions (or other mental state) view of agency. \nOn this view, our agent-relative obligations and permissions have as\ntheir content certain kinds of actions: we are obligated not to\nkill innocents for example. The killing of an innocent of\ncourse requires that there be a death of such innocent, but there is\nno agency involved in mere events such as deaths. Needed for there to\nbe a killing are two other items. One we remarked on before:\nthe action of the putative agent must have its source in a willing.\nBut the other maker of agency here is more interesting for present\npurposes: the willing must cause the death of the innocent\nfor an act to be a killing of such innocent. Much (on this\nview) is loaded into the requirement of causation. \nFirst, causings of evils like deaths of innocents are\ncommonly distinguished from omissions to prevent such deaths.\nHolding a baby’s head under water until it drowns is a killing; seeing\na baby lying face down in a puddle and doing nothing to save it when\none could do so easily is a failure to prevent its death. Our\ncategorical obligations are usually negative in content: we are not to\nkill the baby. We may have an obligation to save it, but this will not\nbe an agent-relative obligation, on the view here considered, unless\nwe have some special relationship to the baby. \nSecond, causings are distinguished from allowings.\nIn a narrow sense of the word we will here stipulate, one\nallows a death to occur when: (1) one’s action merely removes\na defense the victim otherwise would have had against death; and (2)\nsuch removal returns the victim to some morally appropriate baseline\n(Kamm 1994, 1996; MacMahan 2003). Thus, mercy-killings, or euthanasia,\nare outside of our deontological obligations (and thus eligible for\njustification by good consequences) so long as one’s act: (1) only\nremoves a defense against death that the agent herself had earlier\nprovided, such as disconnecting medical equipment that is keeping the\npatient alive when that disconnecting is done by the medical personnel\nthat attached the patient to the equipment originally; and (2) the\nequipment could justifiably have been hooked up to another patient,\nwhere it could do some good, had the doctors known at the time of\nconnection what they know at the time of disconnection. \nThird, one is said not to cause an evil such as a death when\none’s acts merely enable (or aid) some other agent to cause\nsuch evil (Hart and Honore 1985). Thus, one is not categorically\nforbidden to drive the terrorists to where they can kill the policeman\n(if the alternative is death of one’s family), even though one would\nbe categorically forbidden to kill the policeman oneself (even where\nthe alternative is death of one’s family) (Moore 2008). Nor is one\ncategorically forbidden to select which of a group of villagers shall\nbe unjustly executed by another who is pursuing his own purposes\n(Williams 1973). \nFourth, one is said not to cause an evil such as a death when\none merely redirects a presently existing threat to many so that it\nnow threatens only one (or a few) (Thomson 1985). In the time-honored\nexample of the run-away trolley (Trolley), one may turn a trolley so\nthat it runs over one trapped workman so as to save five workmen\ntrapped on the other track, even though it is not permissible for an\nagent to have initiated the movement of the trolley towards the one to\nsave five (Foot 1967; Thomson 1985). \nFifth, our agency is said not to be involved in mere\naccelerations of evils about to happen anyway, as opposed to\ncausing such evils by doing acts necessary for such evils to\noccur (G. Williams 1961; Brody 1996). Thus, when a victim is about to\nfall to his death anyway, dragging a rescuer with him too, the rescuer\nmay cut the rope connecting them. Rescuer is accelerating, but not\ncausing, the death that was about to occur anyway. \nAll of these last five distinctions have been suggested to be part and\nparcel of another centuries-old Catholic doctrine, that of the\ndoctrine of doing and allowing (see the entry on\n doing vs. allowing harm)\n (Moore 2008; Kamm 1994; Foot 1967; Quinn 1989). According to this\ndoctrine, one may not cause death, for that would be a\nkilling, a “doing;” but one may fail to prevent death,\nallow (in the narrow sense) death to occur, enable another to cause\ndeath, redirect a life-threatening item from many to one, or\naccelerate a death about to happen anyway, if good enough consequences\nare in the offing. As with the Doctrine of Double Effect, how\nplausible one finds these applications of the doctrine of doing and\nallowing will determine how plausible one finds this cause-based view\nof human agency. \nA third kind of agent-centered deontology can be obtained by simply\nconjoining the other two agent-centered views (Hurd 1994). This view\nwould be that agency in the relevant sense requires both intending and\ncausing (i.e., acting) (Moore 2008). On this view, our agent-relative\nobligations do not focus on causings or intentions separately; rather,\nthe content of such obligations is focused on intended\ncausings. For example, our deontological obligation with respect\nto human life is neither an obligation not to kill nor an obligation\nnot to intend to kill; rather, it is an obligation not to\nmurder, that is, to kill in execution of an intention to\nkill. \nBy requiring both intention and causings to constitute human agency,\nthis third view avoids the seeming overbreadth of our obligations if\neither intention or action alone marked such agency. Suppose our\nagent-relative obligation were not to do some action such as\nkill an innocent –is that obligation breached by a merely\nnegligent killing, so that we deserve the serious blame of having\nbreached such a categorical norm (Hurd 1994)? (Of course, one might be\nsomewhat blameworthy on consequentialist grounds (Hurd 1995), or\nperhaps not blameworthy at all (Moore and Hurd 2011).) Alternatively,\nsuppose our agent-relative obligation were not to intend to\nkill—does that mean we could not justify forming such an\nintention when good consequences would be the result, and\nwhen we are sure we cannot act so as to fulfill such intention (Hurd\n1994)? If our agent-relative obligation is neither of these alone, but\nis rather, that we are not to kill in execution of an intention to\nkill, both such instances of seeming overbreadth in the reach of our\nobligations, are avoided. \nWhichever of these three agent-centered theories one finds most\nplausible, they each suffer from some common problems. A fundamental\nworry is the moral unattractiveness of the focus on self that is the\nnerve of any agent-centered deontology. The importance of each\nperson’s agency to himself/herself has a narcissistic flavor to it\nthat seems unattractive to many. It seemingly justifies each of us\nkeeping our own moral house in order even at the expense of the world\nbecoming much worse. The worry is not that agent-centered deontology\nis just another form of egoism, according to which the content of\none’s duties exclusively concern oneself; even so, the character of\nagent-relative duties is such that they betoken an emphasis on self\nthat is unattractive in the same way that such emphasis makes egoism\nunattractive. Secondly, many find the distinctions invited by the\nDoctrine of Double Effect and the (five versions of the) Doctrine of\nDoing and Allowing to be either morally unattractive or conceptually\nincoherent. Such critics find the differences between\nintending/foreseeing, causing/omitting, causing/allowing,\ncausing/enabling, causing/redirecting, causing/accelerating to be\nmorally insignificant. (On act/omission (Rachels 1975); on\ndoing/allowing (Kagan 1989); on intending/foreseeing (Bennett 1981;\nDavis 1984).) They urge, for example, that failing to prevent a death\none could easily prevent is as blameworthy as causing a death, so that\na morality that radically distinguishes the two is implausible.\nAlternatively, such critics urge on conceptual grounds that no clear\ndistinctions can be drawn in these matters, that foreseeing with\ncertainty is indistinguishable from intending (Bennett 1981), that\nomitting is one kind of causing (Schaffer 2012), and so forth. \nThirdly, there is the worry about “avoision.” By casting\nour categorical obligations in such agent-centered terms, one invites\na kind of manipulation that is legalistic and Jesuitical, what Leo\nKatz dubs “avoision” (Katz 1996). Some think, for example,\nthat one can transform a prohibited intention into a permissible\npredictive belief (and thus escape intention-focused forms of\nagent-relative duty) by the simple expedient of finding some other end\nwith which to motivate the action in question. \nSuch criticisms of the agent-centered view of deontology drive most\nwho accept their force away from deontology entirely and to some form\nof consequentialism. Alternatively, some of such critics are driven to\npatient-centered deontology, which we discuss immediately below. Yet\nstill other of such critics attempt to articulate yet a fourth form of\nagent-centered deontology. This might be called the “control\ntheory of agency.” On this view, our agency is invoked whenever\nour choices could have made a difference. This cuts across the\nintention/foresight, act/omission, and doing/allowing distinctions,\nbecause in all cases we controlled what happened through our\nchoices (Frey 1995). Yet as an account of deontology, this seems\nworrisomely broad. It disallows consequentialist justifications\nwhenever: we foresee the death of an innocent; we omit to save, where\nour saving would have made a difference and we knew it; where we\nremove a life-saving device, knowing the patient will die. If\ndeontological norms are so broad in content as to cover all these\nforeseeings, omittings, and allowings, then good consequences (such as\na net saving of innocent lives) are ineligible to justify them. This\nmakes for a wildly counterintuitive deontology: surely I can, for\nexample, justify not throwing the rope to one (and thus omit to save\nhim) in order to save two others equally in need. This breadth of\nobligation also makes for a conflict-ridden deontology: by refusing to\ncabin our categorical obligations by the distinctions of the Doctrine\nof Double Effect and the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing, situations of\nconflict between our stringent obligations proliferate in a\ntroublesome way (Anscombe 1962). \nA second group of deontological moral theories can be classified, as\npatient-centered, as distinguished from the\nagent-centered version of deontology just considered. These\ntheories are rights-based rather than duty-based; and some versions\npurport to be quite agent-neutral in the reasons they give moral\nagents. \nAll patient-centered deontological theories are properly characterized\nas theories premised on people’s rights. An illustrative version\nposits, as its core right, the right against being used only as means\nfor producing good consequences without one’s consent. Such a\ncore right is not to be confused with more discrete rights, such as\nthe right against being killed, or being killed intentionally. It is a\nright against being used by another for the user’s or\nothers’ benefit.  More specifically, this version of\npatient-centered deontological theories proscribes the using\nof another’s body, labor, and talent without the latter’s\nconsent. One finds this notion expressed, albeit in different ways, in\nthe work of the so-called Right Libertarians (e.g., Robert Nozick,\nEric Mack), but also in the works of the Left-Libertarians as well\n(e.g., Michael Otsuka, Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne) (Nozick 1974;\nMack 2000; Steiner 1994; Vallentyne and Steiner 2000; Vallentyne,\nSteiner, and Otsuka 2005). On this view, the scope of strong moral\nduties—those that are the correlatives of others’\nrights—is jurisdictionally limited and does not extend to\nresources for producing the Good that would not exist in the absence\nof those intruded upon—that is, their bodies, labors, and\ntalents. In addition to the Libertarians, others whose views include\nthis prohibition on using others include Quinn, Kamm, Alexander,\nFerzan, Gauthier, and Walen (Quinn 1989; Kamm 1996; Alexander 2016;\nAlexander and Ferzan 2009, 2012; Gauthier 1986; Walen 2014, 2016). \nJust as do agent-centered theories, so too do patient-centered\ntheories (such as that forbidding the using of another) seek to\nexplain common intuitions about such classic hypothetical cases as\nTrolley and Transplant (or Fat Man) (Thomson 1985). In Trolley, a\nrunaway trolley will kill five workers unless diverted to a siding\nwhere it will kill one worker. Most people regard it as permissible\nand perhaps mandatory to switch the trolley to the siding. By\ncontrast, in Transplant, where a surgeon can kill one healthy patient\nand transplant his organs to five dying patients, thereby saving their\nlives, the universal reaction is condemnation. (The same is\nby-and-large true in Fat Man, where the runaway trolley cannot be\nswitched off the main track but can be stopped before reaching the\nfive workers by pushing a fat man into its path, resulting in his\ndeath.) \nThe injunction against using arguably accounts for these contrasting\nreactions. After all, in each example, one life is sacrificed to save\nfive. Yet there appears to be a difference in the means through which\nthe net four lives are saved. In Transplant (and Fat Man), the doomed\nperson is used to benefit the others. They could not be saved in the\nabsence of his body. In Trolley, on the other hand, the doomed victim\nis not used. The workers would be saved whether or not he is present\non the second track. \nNotice, too, that this patient-centered libertarian version of\ndeontology handles Trolley, Transplant et al. differently from how\nthey are handled by agent-centered versions. The latter focus on the\nagent’s mental state or on whether the agent acted or caused the\nvictim’s harm. The patient-centered theory focuses instead on\nwhether the victim’s body, labor, or talents were the means by\nwhich the justifying results were produced. So one who realizes that\nby switching the trolley he can save five trapped workers and place\nonly one in mortal danger—and that the danger to the latter is\nnot the means by which the former will be saved—acts permissibly\non the patient-centered view if he switches the trolley even if he\ndoes so with the intention of killing the one worker. Switching\nthe trolley is causally sufficient to bring about the consequences\nthat justify the act—the saving of net four\nworkers—and it is so even in the absence of the one\nworker’s body, labor, or talents. (The five would be saved\nif the one escaped, was never on the track, or did not exist.) By\ncontrast, on the intent and intended action versions of agent-centered\ntheories, the one who switches the trolley does not act\npermissibly if he acts with the intention to harm the one\nworker. (This could be the case, for example, when the one who\nswitches the trolley does so to kill the one whom he hates, only\nknowing that he will thereby save the other five workmen.) On the\npatient-centered version, if an act is otherwise morally justifiable\nby virtue of its balance of good and bad consequences, and the good\nconsequences are achieved without the necessity of using\nanyone’s body, labor, or talents without that person’s\nconsent as the means by which they are achieved, then it is morally\nimmaterial (to the permissibility of the act but not to\nthe culpability of the actor) whether someone undertakes that\nact with the intention to achieve its bad consequences. (This is true,\nof course, only so long as the concept of using does not\nimplicitly refer to the intention of the user) (Alexander 2016).  And\nin assessing the culpability of risky conduct, any good consequences\nmust be discounted, not only by the perceived risk that they will not\noccur, but also by the perceived risk that they will be brought about\nby a using; for any such consequences, however good they otherwise\nare, cannot be considered in determining the permissibility and,\nderivatively, the culpability of acts (Alexander 2016). \nPatient-centered deontologists handle differently other stock examples\nof the agent-centered deontologist. Take the acceleration cases as an\nexample. When all will die in a lifeboat unless one is killed and\neaten; when Siamese twins are conjoined such that both will die unless\nthe organs of one are given to the other via an operation that kills\nthe first; when all of a group of soldiers will die unless the body of\none is used to hold down the enemy barbed wire, allowing the rest to\nsave themselves; when a group of villagers will all be shot by a\nblood-thirsty tyrant unless they select one of their numbers to slake\nthe tyrants lust for death—in all such cases, the\ncausing/accelerating-distinguishing agent-centered deontologists would\npermit the killing but the usings-focused patient-centered\ndeontologist would not. (For the latter, all killings are merely\naccelerations of death.) \nThe restriction of deontological duties to usings of another\nraises a sticky problem for those patient-centered deontological\ntheories that are based on the core right against using: how can they\naccount for the prima facie wrongs of killing, injuring, and\nso forth when done not to use others as means, but for some other\npurpose or for no purpose at all? The answer is that such\npatient-centered deontological constraints must be supplemented by\nconsequentialist-derived moral norms to give an adequate account of\nmorality. Killing, injuring, and so forth will usually be\nunjustifiable on a consequentialist calculus, especially if everyone’s\ninterests are given equal regard. It is when killing and injuring are\notherwise justifiable that the deontological constraint against using\nhas its normative bite over and against what is already prohibited by\nconsequentialism. (This narrowness of patient-centered deontology\nmakes it counterintuitive to agent-centered deontologists, who regard\nprohibitions on killing of the innocent, etc., as paradigmatically\ndeontological.) \nThe patient-centered version of deontology is aptly labeled\nlibertarian in that it is not plausible to conceive of not being aided\nas being used by the one not aiding. Using is an action, not a failure\nto act. More generally, it is counterintuitive to many to think that\nany of us have a right to be aided. For if there were a\nstrong (that is, enforceable or coercible) duty to aid others, such\nthat, for example, A had a duty to aid X,\nY, and Z; and if A could more effectively\naid X, Y, and Z by coercing B and\nC to aid them (as is their duty), then A\nwould have a duty to “use” B and C in\nthis way. For these reasons, any positive duties will not be\nrights-based ones on the view here considered; they will be\nconsequentially-justified duties that can be trumped by the right not\nto be coerced to perform them. \nPatient-centered deontological theories are often conceived in\nagent-neutral reason-giving terms. John has a right to the exclusive\nuse of his body, labor, and talents, and such a right gives everyone\nequal reason to do actions respecting it. But this aspect of\npatient-centered deontological theories gives rise to a particularly\nvirulent form of the so-called paradox of deontology (Scheffler 1988;\nHeuer 2011)—that if respecting Mary’s and Susan’s\nrights is as important morally as is protecting John’s rights,\nthen why isn’t violating John’s rights permissible (or\neven obligatory) when doing so is necessary to protect Mary’s\nand Susan’s rights from being violated by others?\nPatient-centered deontological theories might arguably do better if\nthey abandoned their pretense of being agent-neutral. They could\nconceive of rights as giving agent-relative reasons to each actor to\nrefrain from doing actions violative of such rights. Take the core\nright against being used without one’s consent hypothesized\nearlier. The correlative duty is not to use another without his\nconsent. If such duty is agent-relative, then the rights-based\ndeontologist (no less than the agent-centered deontologist) has the\nconceptual resources to answer the paradox of deontology. That is,\neach of us may not use John, even when such using of John would\nminimize usings of John by others in the future. Such duties are\npersonal to each of us in that we may not justify our violating such a\nduty now by preventing others’ similar violations in the\nfuture. Such personal duties are agent-centered in the sense that the\nagency of each person is central to the duties of each person, so that\nyour using of another now cannot be traded off against other\npossible usings at other times by other people. \nPatient-centered deontologies are thus arguably better construed to be\nagent-relative in the reasons they give. Even so construed, such\ndeontologies join agent-centered deontologies in facing the moral\n(rather than the conceptual) versions of the paradox of deontology.\nFor a critic of either form of deontology might respond to the\ncategorical prohibition about using others as follows: If usings are\nbad, then are not more usings worse than fewer? And if so, then is it\nnot odd to condemn acts that produce better states of affairs than\nwould occur in their absence? Deontologists of either stripe can just\ndeny that wrong acts on their account of wrongness can be translated\ninto bad states of affairs. Two wrong acts are not “worse”\nthan one. Such wrongs cannot be summed into anything of normative\nsignificance. After all, the victim of a rights-violating using may\nsuffer less harm than others might have suffered had his rights not\nbeen violated; yet one cannot, without begging the question against\ndeontological constraints, argue that therefore no constraint should\nblock minimizing harm. That is, the deontologist might reject the\ncomparability of states of affairs that involve violations and those\nthat do not. Similarly, the deontologist may reject the comparability\nof states of affairs that involve more or fewer rights-violations\n(Brook 2007). The deontologist might attempt to back this assertion by\nrelying upon the separateness of persons. Wrongs are only wrongs to\npersons. A wrong to Y and a wrong to Z cannot be\nadded to make some greater wrong because there is no person who\nsuffers this greater wrong (cf. Taurek 1977). \nThis solution to the paradox of deontology, may seem attractive, but\nit comes at a high cost. In Trolley, for example, where there is\nneither agency nor using in the relevant senses and thus no bar to\nswitching, one cannot claim that it is better to switch and save the\nfive. For if the deaths of the five cannot be summed, their deaths are\nnot worse than the death of the one worker on the siding. Although\nthere is no deontological bar to switching, neither is the saving of a\nnet four lives a reason to switch. Worse yet, were the trolley heading\nfor the one worker rather than the five, there would be no reason not\nto switch the trolley, so a net loss of four lives is no reason not to\nswitch the trolley. If the numbers don’t count, they seemingly don’t\ncount either way. \nThe problem of how to account for the significance of numbers without\ngiving up deontology and adopting consequentialism, and without\nresurrecting the paradox of deontology, is one that a number of\ndeontologists are now working to solve (e.g., Kamm 1996; Scanlon 2003;\nOtsuka 2006, Hsieh et al. 2006). Until it is solved, it will remain a\nhuge thorn in the deontologist’s side. \nSomewhat orthogonal to the distinction between agent-centered versus\npatient-centered deontological theories are contractualist\ndeontological theories. Morally wrong acts are, on such accounts,\nthose acts that would be forbidden by principles that people in a\nsuitably described social contract would accept (e.g., Rawls 1971;\nGauthier 1986), or that would be forbidden only by principles that\nsuch people could not “reasonably reject” (e.g., Scanlon\n2003). \nIn deontology, as elsewhere in ethics, is not entirely clear whether a\ncontractualist account is really normative as opposed to metaethical.\nIf such account is a first order normative account, it is probably\nbest construed as a patient-centered deontology; for the central\nobligation would be to do onto others only that to which they have\nconsented. But so construed, modern contractualist accounts would\nshare the problems that have long bedeviled historical social contract\ntheories: how plausible is it that the “moral magic” of\nconsent is the first principle of morality? And how much of what is\ncommonly regarded as permissible to do to people can (in any realistic\nsense of the word) be said to be actually consented to by them,\nexpressly or even implicitly? \nIn fact modern contractualisms look meta-ethical, and not normative.\nThomas Scanlon’s contractualism, for example, which posits at its core\nthose norms of action that we can justify to each other, is best\nconstrued as an ontological and epistemological account of moral\nnotions. The same may be said of David Gauthier’s contractualism. Yet\nso construed, metaethical contractualism as a method for deriving\nmoral norms does not necessarily lead to deontology as a first order\nethics. John Harsanyi, for example, argues that parties to the social\ncontract would choose utilitarianism over the principles John Rawls\nargues would be chosen (Harsanyi 1973). Nor is it clear that\nmeta-ethical contractualism, when it does generate a deontological\nethic, favors either an agent centered or a patient centered version\nof such an ethic. \nIf any philosopher is regarded as central to deontological moral\ntheories, it is surely Immanuel Kant. Indeed, each of the branches of\ndeontological ethics—the agent-centered, the patient-centered,\nand the contractualist—can lay claim to being Kantian. \nThe agent-centered deontologist can cite Kant’s locating the moral\nquality of acts in the principles or maxims on which the agent acts\nand not primarily in those acts’ effects on others. For Kant, the only\nthing unqualifiedly good is a good will (Kant 1785). The\npatient-centered deontologist can, of course, cite Kant’s injunction\nagainst using others as mere means to one’s end (Kant 1785). And the\ncontractualist can cite, as Kant’s contractualist element, Kant’s\ninsistence that the maxims on which one acts be capable of being\nwilled as a universal law—willed by all rational agents (Kant\n1785). (See generally the entry on\n Kant.) \nHaving canvassed the two main types of deontological theories\n(together with a contractualist variation of each), it is time to\nassess deontological morality more generally. On the one hand,\ndeontological morality, in contrast to consequentialism, leaves space\nfor agents to give special concern to their families, friends, and\nprojects. At least that is so if the deontological morality contains\nno strong duty of general beneficence, or, if it does, it places a cap\non that duty’s demands. Deontological morality, therefore, avoids the\noverly demanding and alienating aspects of consequentialism and\naccords more with conventional notions of our moral duties. \nLikewise, deontological moralities, unlike most views of\nconsequentialism, leave space for the supererogatory. A deontologist\ncan do more that is morally praiseworthy than morality demands. A\nconsequentialist cannot, assuming none of the consequentialists’\ndefensive maneuvers earlier referenced work. For such a pure or simple\nconsequentialist, if one’s act is not morally demanded, it is morally\nwrong and forbidden. Whereas for the deontologist, there are acts that\nare neither morally wrong nor demanded, some—but only\nsome—of which are morally praiseworthy. \nAs we have seen, deontological theories all possess the strong\nadvantage of being able to account for strong, widely shared moral\nintuitions about our duties better than can consequentialism. The\ncontrasting reactions to Trolley, Fat Man, Transplant, and other\nexamples earlier given, are illustrative of this. \nFinally, deontological theories, unlike consequentialist ones, have\nthe potential for explaining why certain people have moral standing to\ncomplain about and hold to account those who breach moral duties. For\nthe moral duties typically thought to be deontological in\ncharacter—unlike, say, duties regarding the\nenvironment—are duties to particular people, not duties\nto bring about states of affairs that no particular person has an\nindividual right to have realized. \nOn the other hand, deontological theories have their own weak spots.\nThe most glaring one is the seeming irrationality of our having duties\nor permissions to make the world morally worse. Deontologists need\ntheir own, non-consequentialist model of rationality, one that is a\nviable alternative to the intuitively plausible,\n“act-to-produce-the-best-consequences” model of\nrationality that motivates consequentialist theories. Until this is\ndone, deontology will always be paradoxical. There are several\ndistinct hurdles that the deontologist must overcome. \nOne hurdle is to confront the apparent fact that careful reflection\nabout the degrees of wrongdoing that are possible under any single\nmoral norm does not make it easy to see deontological morality as\nconsisting of general, canonically-formulated texts (conformity to\nwhich could then be said to constitute the distrinct form of practical\nrationality unique to deontological ethics); rather, such apparently\nsimple texts as, “thou shalt not murder,” look more like\nmere epistemic aids summarizing a much more nuanced and detailed (and\nthus less text-like) moral reality (Hurd and Moore\nforthcoming). \nA second hurdle is to find an answer to the inevitable question of\nauthority, assuming that there are such general texts. If it is\nrational to conform one’s behavior and one’s choices to certain\ngeneral texts, as deontology claims, it is always in point to demand\nthe reasons making such texts authoritative for one’s\ndecisions. Deferring one’s own best judgment to the judgment enshrined\nin some text is always prima facie paradoxical (see the entry on\n authority)\n and deontologists like everybody else need to justify such deference.\nHopefully they can do so other than by reference to some person-like\nbut omniscient Deity as the supposed source of such texts, because\nmany deontologists cannot accept such theism (Moore 1995). Moreover,\neven for those with theistic commitments, they may prefer to join\nKant’s insistence that ethics proceed from reason alone, even in a\ntheistic world. \nThe third hurdle exists even if the first two are crossed\nadequately. This hurdle is to deal with the seeming demand of\ndeontological ethics that on occasion one’s categorical obligations\nrequire one to preserve the purity of one’s own moral agency at the\ncost of having one’s actions make the world be in a morally worse\nstate of affairs—at least, “worse” in the agent-neutral sense of\nthe word used by consequentialists. Patient-centered versions of\ndeontology cannot easily escape this problem, as we have shown. It is\nnot even clear that they have the conceptual resources to make agency\nimportant enough to escape this moral paradox. Yet even agent-centered\nversions face this paradox; having the conceptual resources (of agency\nand agent-relative reasons) is not the same as making it plausible\njust how a secular, objective morality can allow each person’s agency\nto be so uniquely crucial to that person. \nMoreover, it is crucial for deontologists to deal with the conflicts\nthat seem to exist between certain duties, and between certain rights.\nFor more information, please see the entry on\n moral dilemmas.\n Kant’s bold proclamation that “a conflict of duties is\ninconceivable” (Kant 1780, p. 25) is the conclusion\nwanted, but reasons for believing it are difficult to produce. The\nintending/foreseeing, doing/allowing, causing/aiding, and related\ndistinctions certainly reduce potential conflicts for the\nagent-centered versions of deontology; whether they can totally\neliminate such conflicts is a yet unresolved question. \nOne well known approach to deal with the possibility of conflict\nbetween deontological duties is to reduce the categorical force of\nsuch duties to that of only “prima facie” duties\n(Ross 1930, 1939). This idea is that conflict between merely prima\nfacie duties is unproblematic so long as it does not infect what\none is categorically obligated to do, which is what overall, concrete\nduties mandate. Like other softenings of the categorical force of\ndeontological obligation we mention briefly below (threshold\ndeontology, mixed views), the prima facie duty view is in\nsome danger of collapsing into a kind of consequentialism. This\ndepends on whether “prima facie” is read\nepistemically or not, and on (1) whether any good consequences are\neligible to justify breach of prima facie duties; (2) whether\nonly such consequences over some threshold can do so; or (3) whether\nonly threatened breach of other deontological duties can do so. \nThirdly, there is the manipulability worry mentioned before with\nrespect to agent-centered versions of deontology. To the extent\npotential conflict is eliminated by resort to the Doctrine of Double\nEffect, the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing, and so forth (and it is\nnot clear to what extent patient-centered versions rely on these\ndoctrines and distinctions to mitigate potential conflict), then a\npotential for “avoision” is opened up. Such avoision is\nthe manipulation of means (using omissions, foresight, risk,\nallowings, aidings, acceleratings, redirectings, etc.) to achieve\npermissibly what otherwise deontological morality would forbid (see\nKatz 1996). Avoision is an undesirable feature of any ethical system\nthat allows such strategic manipulation of its doctrines. \nFourth, there is what might be called the paradox of relative\nstringency. There is an aura of paradox in asserting that all\ndeontological duties are categorical—to be done no matter the\nconsequences—and yet asserting that some of such duties are more\nstringent than others. A common thought is that “there cannot be\ndegrees of wrongness with intrinsically wrong acts…”\n(Frey 1995, p. 78, n.3; also Hurka 2019). Yet relative\nstringency—“degrees of wrongness”—seems forced\nupon the deontologist by one if not two considerations. First, duties\nof differential stringency can be weighed against one another if there\nis conflict between them, so that a conflict-resolving, overall duty\nbecomes possible if duties can be more or less stringent. Second, when\nwe punish for the wrongs consisting in our violation of deontological\nduties, we (rightly) do not punish all violations equally. The greater\nthe wrong, the greater the punishment deserved; and relative\nstringency of duty violated (or importance of rights) seems the best\nway of making sense of greater versus lesser wrongs (Hurd and Moore\nforthcoming). \nFifth, there are situations—unfortunately not all of them\nthought experiments—where compliance with deontological norms\nwill bring about disastrous consequences. To take a stock example of\nmuch current discussion, suppose that unless A violates the\ndeontological duty not to torture an innocent person (B),\nten, or a thousand, or a million other innocent people will die\nbecause of a hidden nuclear device. If A is forbidden by\ndeontological morality from torturing B, many would regard\nthat as a reductio ad absurdum of deontology. \nDeontologists have six possible ways of dealing with such “moral\ncatastrophes” (although only two of these are very plausible).\nFirst, they can just bite the bullet and declare that sometimes doing\nwhat is morally right will have tragic results but that allowing such\ntragic results to occur is still the right thing to do. Complying with\nmoral norms will surely be difficult on those occasions, but the moral\nnorms apply nonetheless with full force, overriding all other\nconsiderations. We might call this the Kantian response, after Kant’s\nfamous hyperbole: “Better the whole people should perish,”\nthan that injustice be done (Kant 1780, p. 100). One might also\ncall this the absolutist conception of deontology, because such a view\nmaintains that conformity to norms has absolute force and not merely\ngreat weight. \nThis first response to “moral catastrophes,” which is to\nignore them, might be further justified by denying that moral\ncatastrophes, such as a million deaths, are really a million times\nmore catastrophic than one death. This is the so-called\n“aggregation” problem, which we alluded to in\n section 2.2\n in discussing the paradox of deontological constraints. John Taurek\nfamously argued that it is a mistake to assume harms to two persons\nare twice as bad as a comparable harm to one person. For each of the\ntwo suffers only his own harm and not the harm of the other (Taurek\n1977). Taurek’s argument can be employed to deny the existence of\nmoral catastrophes and thus the worry about them that deontologists\nwould otherwise have. Robert Nozick also stresses the separateness of\npersons and therefore urges that there is no entity that suffers\ndouble the harm when each of two persons is harmed (Nozick 1974). (Of\ncourse, Nozick, perhaps inconsistently, also acknowledges the\nexistence of moral catastrophes.) Most deontologists reject Taurek’s\nradical conclusion that we need not be morally more obligated to avert\nharm to the many than to avert harm to the few; but they do accept the\nnotion that harms should not be aggregated. Deontologists’ approaches\nto the nonaggregation problem when the choice is between saving the\nmany and saving the few are: (1) save the many so as to acknowledge\nthe importance of each of the extra persons; (2) conduct a weighted\ncoin flip; (3) flip a coin; or (4) save anyone you want (a denial of\nmoral catastrophes) (Broome 1998; Doggett 2013; Doucet 2013; Dougherty\n2013; Halstead 2016: Henning 2015; Hirose 2007, 2015; Hsieh et al.\n2006; Huseby 2011; Kamm 1993; Rasmussen 2012; Saunders 2009; Scanlon\n2003; Suikkanen 2004; Timmerman 2004; Wasserman and Strudler\n2003). \nThe second plausible response is for the deontologist to abandon\nKantian absolutism for what is usually called “threshold\ndeontology.” A threshold deontologist holds that deontological\nnorms govern up to a point despite adverse consequences; but when the\nconsequences become so dire that they cross the stipulated threshold,\nconsequentialism takes over (Moore 1997, ch. 17). A\nmay not torture B to save the lives of two others, but he may\ndo so to save a thousand lives if the “threshold” is\nhigher than two lives but lower than a thousand. \nThere are two varieties of threshold deontology that are worth\ndistinguishing. On the simple version, there is some fixed threshold\nof awfulness beyond which morality’s categorical norms no longer have\ntheir overriding force. Such a threshold is fixed in the sense that it\ndoes not vary with the stringency of the categorical duty being\nviolated. The alternative is what might be called “sliding scale\nthreshold deontology.” On this version, the threshold varies in\nproportion to the degree of wrong being done—the wrongness of\nstepping on a snail has a lower threshold (over which the wrong can be\njustified) than does the wrong of stepping on a baby. \nThreshold deontology (of either stripe) is an attempt to save\ndeontological morality from the charge of fanaticism. It is similar to\nthe “prima facie duty” version of deontology\ndeveloped to deal with the problem of conflicting duties, yet\nthreshold deontology is usually interpreted with such a high threshold\nthat it more closely mimics the outcomes reached by a\n“pure,” absolutist kind of deontology. Threshold\ndeontology faces several theoretical difficulties. Foremost among them\nis giving a theoretically tenable account of the location of such a\nthreshold, either absolutely or on a sliding scale (Alexander 2000;\nEllis 1992; Moore 2019; Arneson 2019; Cole 2019; Alexander 2019). Why\nis the threshold for torture of the innocent at one thousand lives,\nsay, as opposed to nine hundred or two thousand? Another problem is\nthat whatever the threshold, as the dire consequences approach it,\ncounter-intuitive results appear to follow. For example, it may be\npermissible, if we are one-life-at-risk short of the threshold, to\npull one more person into danger who will then be saved, along with\nthe others at risk, by killing an innocent person (Alexander 2000).\nThirdly, there is some uncertainty about how one is to reason after\nthe threshold has been reached: are we to calculate at the margin on\nstraight consequentialist grounds, use an agent-weighted mode of\nsumming, or do something else? A fourth problem is that threshold\ndeontology threatens to collapse into a kind of consequentialism.\nIndeed, it can be perhaps shown that the sliding scale version of\nthreshold deontology is extensionally equivalent to an agency-weighted\nform of consequentialism (Sen 1982). \nThe remaining four strategies for dealing with the problem of dire\nconsequence cases all have the flavor of evasion by the deontologist.\nConsider first the famous view of Elizabeth Anscombe: such cases (real\nor imagined) can never present themselves to the consciousness of a\ntruly moral agent because such agent will realize it is immoral to\neven think about violating moral norms in order to avert disaster\n(Anscombe 1958; Geach 1969; Nagel 1979). Such rhetorical excesses\nshould be seen for what they are, a peculiar way of stating Kantian\nabsolutism motivated by an impatience with the question. \nAnother response by deontologists, this one most famously associated\nwith Bernard Williams, shares some of the “don’t think about\nit” features of the Anscombean response. According to Williams\n(1973), situations of moral horror are simply “beyond\nmorality,” and even beyond reason. (This view is reminiscent of\nthe ancient view of natural necessity, revived by Sir Francis Bacon,\nthat such cases are beyond human law and can only be judged by the\nnatural law of instinct.) Williams tells us that in such cases we just\nact. Interestingly, Williams contemplates that such\n“existentialist” decision-making will result in our doing\nwhat we have to do in such cases—for example, we torture the\ninnocent to prevent nuclear holocaust. \nSurely this is an unhappy view of the power and reach of human law,\nmorality, or reason. Indeed, Williams (like Bacon and Cicero before\nhim) thinks there is an answer to what should be done, albeit an\nanswer very different than Anscombe’s. But both views share the\nweakness of thinking that morality and even reason runs out on us when\nthe going gets tough. \nYet another strategy is to divorce completely the moral appraisals of\nacts from the blameworthiness or praiseworthiness of the agents who\nundertake them, even when those agents are fully cognizant of the\nmoral appraisals. So, for example, if A tortures innocent\nB to save a thousand others, one can hold that A’s\nact is morally wrong but also that A is morally praiseworthy\nfor having done it. \nDeontology does have to grapple with how to mesh deontic judgments of\nwrongness with “hypological” (Zimmerman 2002) judgments of\nblameworthiness (Alexander 2004). Yet it would be an oddly cohering\nmorality that condemned an act as wrong yet praised the doer of it.\nDeontic and hypological judgments ought to have more to do with each\nother than that. Moreover, it is unclear what action-guiding potential\nsuch an oddly cohered morality would have: should an agent facing such\na choice avoid doing wrong, or should he go for the praise? \nThe last possible strategy for the deontologist in order to deal with\ndire consequences, other than by denying their existence, as per\nTaurek, is to distinguish moral reasons from all-things-considered\nreasons and to argue that whereas moral reasons dictate obedience to\ndeontological norms even at the cost of catastrophic consequences,\nall-things-considered reasons dictate otherwise. (This is one reading\nof Bernard William’s famous discussion of moral luck, where non-moral\nreasons seemingly can trump moral reasons (Williams 1975, 1981); this\nis also a strategy some consequentialists (e.g., Portmore 2003) seize\nas well in order to handle the demandingness and alienation problems\nendemic to consequentialism.) But like the preceding strategy, this\none seems desperate. Why should one even care that moral reasons align\nwith deontology if the important reasons, the all-things-considered\nreasons that actually govern decisions, align with\nconsequentialism? \nThe perceived weaknesses of deontological theories have led some to\nconsider how to eliminate or at least reduce those weaknesses while\npreserving deontology’s advantages. One way to do this is to embrace\nboth consequentialism and deontology, combining them into some kind of\na mixed theory. Given the differing notions of rationality underlying\neach kind of theory, this is easier said than done. After all, one\ncannot simply weigh agent-relative reasons against agent-neutral\nreasons, without stripping the former sorts of reasons of their\ndistinctive character. \nA time-honored way of reconciling opposing theories is to allocate\nthem to different jurisdictions. Tom Nagel’s reconciliation of the two\ntheories is a version of this, inasmuch as he allocates the\nagent-neutral reasons of consequentialism to our\n“objective” viewpoint, whereas the agent-relative reasons\nof deontology are seen as part of our inherent subjectivity (Nagel\n1986). Yet Nagel’s allocations are non-exclusive; the same situation\ncan be seen from either subjective or objective viewpoints, meaning\nthat it is mysterious how we are to combine them into some overall\nview. \nA less mysterious way of combining deontology with consequentialism is\nto assign to each a jurisdiction that is exclusive of the other. One\npossibility here is to regard the agent-neutral reasons of\nconsequentialism as a kind of default rationality/morality in the\nsense that when an agent-relative permission or obligation applies, it\ngoverns, but in the considerable logical space where neither applies,\nconsequentialism holds sway (Moore 2008). Remembering that for the\nthreshold deontologist, consequentialist reasons may still determine\nright action even in areas governed by agent-relative obligations or\npermissions, once the level of bad consequences crosses the relevant\nthreshold (Moore 2012). \nIn contrast to mixed theories, deontologists who seek to keep their\ndeontology pure hope to expand agent-relative reasons to cover all of\nmorality and yet to mimic the advantages of consequentialism. Doing\nthis holds out the promise of denying sense to the otherwise damning\nquestion, how could it be moral to make (or allow) the world to be\nworse (for they deny that there is any states-of-affairs\n“worseness” in terms of which to frame such a question)\n(Foot 1985). To make this plausible, one needs to expand the coverage\nof agent-relative reasons to cover what is now plausibly a matter of\nconsequentialist reasons, such as positive duties to strangers.\nMoreover, deontologists taking this route need a content to the\npermissive and obligating norms of deontology that allows them to\nmimic the outcomes making consequentialism attractive. This requires a\npicture of morality’s norms that is extremely detailed in content, so\nthat what looks like a consequentialist balance can be generated by a\ncomplex series of norms with extremely detailed priority rules and\nexception clauses (Richardson 1990). Few consequentialists will\nbelieve that this is a viable enterprise. \nThe mirror image of the pure deontologist just described is the\nindirect or two-level consequentialist. For this view too seeks to\nappropriate the strengths of both deontology and consequentialism, not\nby embracing both, but by showing that an appropriately defined\nversion of one can do for both. The indirect consequentialist, of\ncourse, seeks to do this from the side of consequentialism alone. \nYet as many have argued (Lyons 1965; Alexander 1985), indirect\nconsequentialism collapses either into: blind and irrational\nrule-worship (“why follow the rules when not doing so produces\nbetter consequences?”); direct consequentialism (“acts in\nconformity to the rules rather miraculously produce better\nconsequences in the long run”); or nonpublicizability\n(“ordinary folks should be instructed to follow the rules but\nshould not be told of the ultimate consequentialist basis for doing\nso, lest they depart from the rules mistakenly believing better\nconsequences will result”). For more information, please see the\nentry on\n rule consequentialism.\n Nor can the indirect consequentialist adequately explain why those\nwho violate the indirect consequentialist’s rules have\n“wronged” those who might be harmed as a result, that is,\nwhy the latter have a personal complaint against the former. (This is\ntrue irrespective of whether the rule-violation produces good\nconsequences; but it is especially so when good consequences result\nfrom the rule-violation.) The bottom line is that if deontology has\nintuitive advantages over consequentialism, it is far from obvious\nwhether those advantages can be captured by moving to indirect\nconsequentialism, even if there is a version of indirect\nconsequentialism that could avoid the dire consequences problem that\nbedevils deontological theories. \nRecently, deontologists have begun to ask how an actor should evaluate\ncourses of action in which it is uncertain whether a deontological\nconstraint will be violated. For example, should one detonate dynamite\nin a mining operation if there is a chance that the explosion will\ncause the Fat Man to tumble into the path of the trolley that would\notherwise kill five? (Assume that were the chance the same that the\nexplosion would instead divert the trolley in Trolley, killing one but\nsaving five, the detonation would be permissible.) Or should one take\na drive to observe the scenery if there is a slightly increased chance\nthat, because of the possibility of traffic, doing so will cause one\nto miss a lunch one had promised to attend? Whether deontological\nconstraints focus on agents’ intentions or beliefs, or whether they\nfocus on agents’ counting positively in their deliberations others’\nuse as means, how should the uncertainty of outcomes be taken into\naccount by deontologists? This question has been addressed by Aboodi,\nBorer, and Enoch (2008); Alexander (2016; 2018); Lazar (2015; 2017a,\n2017b, 2018); Smith (2014); Tarsney (2018); and Tomlin (2019). \nDeontological theories are normative theories. They do not presuppose\nany particular position on moral ontology or on moral epistemology.\nPresumably, a deontologist can be a moral realist of either the\nnatural (moral properties are identical to natural properties) or\nnonnatural (moral properties are not themselves natural properties\neven if they are nonreductively related to natural properties)\nvariety. Or a deontologist can be an expressivist, a constructivist, a\ntranscendentalist, a conventionalist, or a Divine command theorist\nregarding the nature of morality. Likewise, a deontologist can claim\nthat we know the content of deontological morality by direct\nintuition, by Kantian reflection on our normative situation, or by\nreaching reflective equilibrium between our particular moral judgments\nand the theories we construct to explain them (theories of\nintuitions). \nNonetheless, although deontological theories can be agnostic regarding\nmetaethics, some metaethical accounts seem less hospitable than others\nto deontology. For example, the stock furniture of deontological\nnormative ethics—rights, duties, permissions—fits uneasily\nin the realist-naturalist’s corner of the metaethical universe. (Which\nis why many naturalists, if they are moral realists in their\nmeta-ethics, are consequentialists in their ethics.) Nonnatural\nrealism, conventionalism, transcendentalism, and Divine command seem\nmore hospitable metaethical homes for deontology. (For example, the\nparadox of deontology above discussed may seem more tractable if\nmorality is a matter of personal directives of a Supreme Commander to\neach of his human subordinates.) If these rough connections hold, then\nweaknesses with those metaethical accounts most hospitable to\ndeontology will weaken deontology as a normative theory of action.\nSome deontologists have thus argued that these connections need not\nhold and that a naturalist-realist meta-ethics can ground a\ndeontological ethics (Moore 2004).","contact.mail":"micmoore@illinois.edu","contact.domain":"illinois.edu"}]
