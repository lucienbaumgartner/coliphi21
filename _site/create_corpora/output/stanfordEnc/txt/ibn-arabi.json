Salman Bashier (2012) has\neven argued that “the story of Islamic philosophy” depicts\nan initial rationalistic phase and culminates with an\n“illuminative phase” best represented by Ibn\n‘Arabî. Most Western scholarship and much of the later\nIslamic tradition have classified Ibn ‘Arabî as a\n“Sufi”, though he himself did not; his works cover the\nwhole gamut of Islamic sciences, not least Koran commentary, Hadith\n(sayings of Muhammad), jurisprudence, principles of jurisprudence,\ntheology, philosophy, and mysticism. Unlike al-Ghazâlî,\nwhose range of work is similar to his, he did not usually write in\nspecific genres, but tended rather to integrate and synthesize the\nsciences in the context of thematic works, ranging in length from one\nor two folios to several thousand pages. Nor did he depart from the\nhighest level of discourse, or repeat himself in different works. The\nlater Sufi tradition called him al-Shaykh al-Akbar, the\nGreatest Master, a title that was understood to mean that no one else\nhas been or will be able to unpack the multi-layered significance of\nthe sources of the Islamic tradition with such detail and\nprofundity.\n\n\nIbn ‘Arabî’s writings remained unknown in the West\nuntil modern times, but they spread throughout the Islamic world\nwithin a century of his death. The early Orientalists, with one or two\nexceptions, paid little attention to him because he had no discernable\ninfluence in Europe. His works, moreover, are notoriously difficult,\nmaking it easy to dismiss him as a “mystic” or a\n“pantheist” without trying to read him. Not until books by\nHenry Corbin (1958) and Toshihiko Izutsu (1966) was he recognized as\nan extraordinarily broad-ranging and highly original thinker with much\nto contribute to the world of philosophy. These two scholars, however,\nlimited their attention almost entirely to one of his short works,\nFusûs al-hikam (“The Ringstones of the\nWisdoms”). Although Ringstones was the focus of a long\ntradition of commentary, it represents but a tiny fraction of what he\noffers in his massive al-Futûhât al-makkiyya\n(“The Meccan Openings”). More recently, scholars have\nbegun to look at this work (which will fill an estimated 15,000 pages\nin its modern edition), but relatively little of it has been\ntranslated into Western languages and what has been translated is\nstill in need of further explanation, interpretation, and\ncontextualization in the history of philosophy (for a stab at the\nlast, see Ebstein 2013).\n\n\nSeveral scholars have pointed to parallels between Ibn\n‘Arabî and figures like Eckhart and Cusanus (Sells 1994,\nShah-Kazemi 2006, Smirnov 1993, Dobie 2009), and others have suggested\nthat he anticipates trends in physics (Yousef 2007) or modern\nphilosophy (Almond 2004, Coates 2002, Dobie 2007). The most serious\nattempt to fit him into the history of Western philosophy argues that\nhis notion of barzakh (see section 3.4) offers a viable\nsolution to the problem of defining the indefinable, which has dogged\nepistemology from the time of Aristotle and led to the despair of\nmodern philosophers like Rorty (Bashier 2004). Other scholars have\ncompared him to Eastern thinkers like Shankara, Zhuangzi, and\nDôgen (Shah-Kazemi 2006, Izutsu 1966, Izutsu 1977). Nor were the\nsimilarities to Eastern thought lost on premodern scholars; during the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Muslims of China established\na Chinese-language school (the Han Kitab) that drew from Ibn\n‘Arabî’s legacy and presented the Islamic worldview\nin terms drawn from Confucian thought (Murata et al. 2008).\nImplications of his thought for contemporary concerns have been\naddressed by a diverse array of scholars and devotees in the\nJournal of the Muhyiddin Ibn ‘Arabi Society, which has\nbeen published since 1983. All the attention he has been receiving,\nand specifically from scholars and thinkers labelled\n“perennialists,” has led some to question the validity of\nthe modern lenses through which he is often read (Lipton 2018). What\nfollows is an outline of some of the topics he addresses.\n\nIbn ‘Arabî referred to himself with fuller versions of his\nname, such as Abû ‘Abdallâh Muhammad ibn\n‘Alî ibn al-‘Arabî al-Tâ’î\nal-Hâtimî (the last three names indicating his noble Arab\nlineage). He was born in Murcia in 1165 to the family of a minor\nofficial and received the standard education of a literatus, without\nany special attention to religious topics. In his early teens he\nunderwent a visionary conversion “at the hands of Jesus”\n(albeit the Jesus of the Koran), and this resulted in an\n“opening” (futûh) of his soul toward the\ndivine realm. Shortly thereafter, in about 1180, his father took him\nto meet his friend Averroes. Ibn ‘Arabî recounts an\nelliptical conversation in which he explained to the philosopher the\nlimits of rational perception. Corbin has taken this event as a\nsymbolic parting of ways between Islam and the West: with the help of\nLatin Averroism, Western thinkers were soon to pursue an exclusively\nrationalistic path leading “to the conflict between theology and\nphilosophy, between faith and knowledge, between symbol and\nhistory” (Corbin 1969, 13). In contrast, Muslim intellectuals\ntended rather to ignore Averroes, though Avicenna, Suhrawardî,\nand other philosophers continued to be read, annotated, and improved\nupon. At the same time, no one could fail to notice Ibn\n‘Arabî’s challenge to merely rational understanding,\nand many Muslim philosophers followed paths that undertook the\nharmonization of reason, mystical intuition, and revelation. \nIbn ‘Arabî studied the Islamic sciences with numerous\nteachers in Andalus and North Africa. In 1201 he left the Muslim West\nto perform the pilgrimage to Mecca and did not return. He traveled\nextensively in Iraq and Anatolia, finally settling down in Damascus in\n1223, where he trained disciples and wrote prolifically until his\ndeath in November 1240. \nAmong his several hundred books and treatises, Ringstones\nand Openings are the most famous. Ringstones became\nthe standard text to transmit his teachings and, during the next six\ncenturies, was the object of more than a hundred commentaries. Among\nhis many talented disciples, the most influential was his stepson Sadr\nal-Dîn Qûnawî (1210–74), who began the process\nof systematizing his teachings and elucidating his perspective in\nconversation with contemporary philosophy, even initiating a\ncorrespondence with Nasîr al-Dîn al-Tûsî, the\nimportant reviver of Avicenna (Qûnawî,\nal-Murâsalât). \nQûnawî differentiates Ibn ‘Arabî’s\nposition from that of falsafa and scholastic theology (Kalam)\nby calling it mashrab al-tahqîq, “the school of\nrealization”. Tahqîq is indeed the cornerstone of\nIbn ‘Arabî’s vast corpus, so it is important to have\na sense of what it means. The word is derived from the same root as\nhaqq and haqîqa, key terms in all the\nsciences. Haqq means true, real, right, worthy, and\nappropriate (in modern times, it is used to speak of human\n“rights”); haqîqa means reality and truth.\nThe Koran uses haqq, the conceptual opposite of\nbâtil (false, vain, unreal, inappropriate), in a\nvariety of senses, not least as a divine name, “the Real, the\nTrue”, and to designate the content of revelation (the Koran and\nearlier scriptures). Haqîqa is not a Koranic term, but\nit was used in the Hadith literature and given special attention in\nphilosophy. Tahqîq or “realization” means\nto speak, affirm, and actualize haqq and\nhaqîqa—truth, reality, rightness,\nappropriateness. Ibn ‘Arabî finds its role in human\nbecoming encapsulated in the Prophet’s saying, “Everything\nhas a haqq, so give to each that has a haqq its\nhaqq”. In other words, everything in the universe,\nsociety, and the soul has a rightness and an appropriateness, and the\nhuman task vis-à-vis each thing is to act rightly and\nappropriately; or, everything has rights, and people have the\nresponsibility (that is, the haqq “against them”,\n‘alayhim) to observe those rights. \nAnother hadith explains that the primary haqq, upon which all\nother haqqs are based, is that “There is no god but\nGod”, which is to say that there is nothing truly real but the\nReal, there is nothing truly right but the Right. In Islamic theology,\nunderstanding this notion is called tawhîd or\n“the acknowledgement of [divine] unity” and is considered\nthe first of the three principles of faith; tawhîd also\nunderlies the standpoints of the philosophers, even if some of them\nseldom spoke of God per se, preferring terms like the First, the Good,\nand the Necessary. This particular hadith tells us that God’s\nhaqq against people (that is, their responsibility toward\nhim) is for them to acknowledge tawhîd, and, if they do\nso, their right against God (his responsibility toward them) is for\nthem to receive everlasting happiness,\nsa‘âda—the term philosophers used to\ntranslate eudaimonia. \nFrom earliest times, Muslim philosophers recognized that\nhaqq—truth, reality, rightness—was basic to the\nquest for wisdom and the happiness of the soul. Already\nal-Kindî, at the beginning of his most famous work, On First\nPhilosophy, writes that the goal of the philosopher is to reach\nhaqq and to practice haqq. Scholars translate the\nword here and in similar contexts as “truth”, but doing so\nsuggests that the issue was logical and epistemological, when in fact\nit was ontological and existential; for the philosophers, the goal of\nthe quest for wisdom was transformation of the soul, and that could\nnot be achieved simply by logic and argumentation.\nAl-Kindî’s statement is in fact an early definition of\ntahqîq, and the term itself became common in\nphilosophical texts, though it seldom has the same urgency that it has\nin Ibn ‘Arabî’s works. For him it is the guiding\nprinciple of all knowledge and activity and the highest goal to which\na human soul can aspire. It means knowing the truth and reality of the\ncosmos, the soul, and human affairs on the basis of the Supreme\nReality, al-Haqq; knowing the Supreme Reality inasmuch as it\nreveals itself in the haqqs of all things; and acting in\nkeeping with these haqqs at every moment and in every\nsituation. In short, the “realizers”\n(muhaqqiqûn) are those who fully actualize the\nspiritual, cosmic, and divine potential of the soul (Chittick 2005,\nchap. 5). \nSome of the implications of tahqîq can be understood\nwhen it is contrasted with its conceptual opposite,\ntaqlîd, which means imitation or following authority.\nKnowledge can be divided into two sorts, which in Arabic were often\ncalled naqlî, transmitted, and\n‘aqlî, intellectual; or\nhusûlî, acquired, and\nhudûrî, presential. Transmitted knowledge is\neverything that one can learn only by imitating others, like language,\nculture, scripture, history, law, and science. Intellectual knowledge\nis what one comes to know by realizing its truth within oneself, like\nmathematics and metaphysics, even if these are initially learned by\nimitation. Mullâ Sadrâ calls intellectual knowledge\n“non-instrumental” (al-ghayr al-âlî),\nbecause it accrues to the soul not by the instruments of sense\nperception, imagination, and rational argumentation, but by the\nsoul’s conformity with reason or intelligence\n(‘aql), which, in its fullest reality, is nothing but\nthe shining light of the Real. In short, Ibn ‘Arabî, like\nmany of the Islamic philosophers, holds that real knowledge cannot\ncome from imitating others, but must be discovered by realization,\nwhich is the actualization of the soul’s potential. Ibn\n‘Arabî differs from most philosophers in maintaining that\nfull realization can only be achieved by following in the footsteps of\nthe prophets. \nIt is difficult to overestimate the importance of the Koran as Ibn\n‘Arabî’s source of inspiration (Chodkiewicz 1993a).\nFar more than either the theologians or the philosophers, he dedicated\nhis efforts to absorbing God’s word and being absorbed by it,\nand his writings are suffused with quotations and terminology from the\ntext. As the divine speech (kalâm), the Koran is\nunderstood as nonmanifest and indistinct from the Divine Essence,\nthough it becomes manifest in recitation and writing. God’s\nspeech reveals itself not only in scripture, but also in the universe\nand the soul. The homologies among cosmos, soul, and scripture follow\neasily on the Koran’s imagery. In several verses it speaks of\nGod’s creative act as his command “Be!”, and it\nalludes to the individual creatures as his words\n(kalimât). The identity of speech and creativity is\nalso seen in the Koran’s frequent use of the term\n“sign” (âya) to designate the phenomena of\nthe universe, the interior events of the soul, and its own verses. In\neffect, when God speaks—and he speaks because the Infinite Real\ncannot but display its qualities and characteristics—he voices\nthree books, each of which is made up of signs/verses. As Ibn\n‘Arabî says of the cosmos, “It is all letters,\nwords, chapters, and verses, so it is the Great Koran” (Ibn\n‘Arabî, al-Futûhât, 1911 edition,\n4:167.22). \nIn one of his best known explications of the nature of things, Ibn\nal-‘Arabî looks at God’s creativity as an analogue\nof human speech. Just as we create words and sentences in the\nsubstratum of breath, so God creates the universe by articulating\nwords in the Breath of the All-Merciful (nafas\nal-rahmân), which is the deployment of existence\n(inbisât al-wujûd); indeed, existence itself is\nsynonymous with mercy (rahma). His most elaborate\ncosmological scheme (among several) depicts the basic levels of cosmic\ndeployment as corresponding with the twenty-eight letters of the\nArabic alphabet, each representing a specific modality of articulated\nexistence (Burckhardt 1977, Chittick 1998). \nThe pivotal importance of the written Koran rests on the fact that it\nvoices the divine names and the signs/verses in human language,\nthereby providing the key to deciphering the other two books. By\ninterpreting the Koran, we also interpret the cosmos and ourselves.\nIbn ‘Arabî typically begins any discussion with a verse or\ntwo, and he then proceeds to draw out meanings that have a bearing on\nwhatever the context may be. He insists that readings must conform to\nthe Arabic language as spoken by the original recipients of the Book,\nbut more often than not he offers surprising and highly original\ninterpretations. On close examination, these are seen to be consistent\nwith the language, even when they fly in the face of common sense. It\nis precisely his ability to stick to the transmitted sources and\nsimultaneously bring out new meanings—which, once expressed,\nseem almost self-evident—that has convinced the later tradition\nof his exceptional mastery. He tells us that the author of the Koran\nintends every meaning understood by every reader, and he reminds us\nthat human authors cannot have the same intention. Moreover, he tells\nus that if someone re-reads a Koranic verse and sees exactly the same\nmeaning that he saw the previous time, he has not read it\n“properly”—that is, in keeping with the\nhaqq of the divine speech—for the meanings disclosed in\nthe Three Books are never repeated. \nGod’s words, like our own spoken words, dissipate quickly, so he\nrenews them constantly, “at every breath” (ma‘\nal-anfâs). This is to say that “everything other than\nGod” (the standard definition of the cosmos) is re-created at\neach instant (tajdîd al-khalq\nfi’l-ânât) and all things undergo constant\nchange. The notion that “There is no repetition in [God’s]\nself-disclosure” (lâ takrâr\nfi’l-tajallî) is a basic principle of Ibn\n‘Arabî’s thought. He sees it as a straightforward\napplication of tawhîd. By acknowledging the unity of\nthe Real, we recognize that it is one and unique in its every act,\nwhich means that each created thing and each moment of each thing is\none and unique; nothing can ever be repeated precisely because of each\nthing’s uniqueness and the divine infinity. \nIbn ‘Arabî’s basic project is to map out the\npossibilities of human becoming, to clarify the distinction between\nhaqq and bâtil—truth and falsehood,\nreality and unreality, right and wrong—and to point his readers\ntoward perfection, that is, realization of the Real “to the\nextent of human capacity” (‘alâ qadr tâqat\nal-bashar), as the philosophers liked to put it. This in turn\nrequires becoming characterized by the divine names (al-takhalluq\nbi asmâ’ Allâh), a process discussed by\nal-Ghazâlî among others and called by Avicenna\nal-ta’alluh, being like unto God, or deiformity. God\ncreated human beings in the form of the name Allah itself, which is\ncalled “the all-comprehensive name” (al-ism\nal-jâmi‘), because it is the referent of all other\ndivine names. Realization is then the process of actualizing knowledge\nof the Three Books and bringing the soul into perfect harmony with the\nReal, a harmony that becomes apparent in the transformation of\ncharacter and the flowering of virtue. The science of\n“ethics” (akhlâq, pl. of khuluq,\ncharacter) does not concern itself simply with knowledge of right\nbehavior, but aims rather at understanding the soul’s rootedness\nin the divine names and mapping out the path of becoming characterized\nby them. The Koran sets up Muhammad as the perfect model here with the\nwords it directs at him, “You have a magnificent character\n[khuluq ‘azîm]” (68:4). This can be nothing\nbut the full realization of the divine speech, “the magnificent\nKoran” (al-qur’ân al-‘azîm,\n15:87). According to Ibn ‘Arabî, this is why\nMuhammad’s wife ‘Â’isha said about him,\n“His character was the Koran.” \nThe Koran often speaks of God’s “names”\n(asmâ’), and it mentions a good number of\nthem—not “ninety-nine”, as is traditionally said,\nbut anywhere between seventy and twice as many, depending on the\ncriteria used in counting. The names, which are often called\n“attributes” (sifât), provide the points of\nreference for Islamic theology. Ibn ‘Arabî distinguishes\nbetween “the names of the names” (asmâ’\nal-asmâ’), which are the names voiced in human\nlanguage, and the names in themselves, which are realities in divinis.\nTheologians wrote many books listing the names and explaining their\nsignificance for God, the cosmos, and the human soul. Ibn\n‘Arabî devoted a book-length chapter of the\nOpenings specifically to them, and he composed an independent\ntreatise summarizing their role in human becoming (Ibn\n‘Arabî, Kitâb kashf\nal-ma‘nâ). \nNames are basic to the quest for deiformity because the Real in\nitself, in its very Essence (dhât), is known only to\nitself. “Others” (ghayr), which are the\nsigns/verses written out in the Three Books, know the Essence only\ninasmuch as it reveals itself to them. In other words, although\neverything is a “face” (wajh) of\nGod—“Wherever you turn, there is God’s face”\n(Koran 2:115)—to make distinctions among the omnipresent faces\nwe need to know their names and recognize their haqqs. \nThe word used to designate the Essence, al-dhât, is a\npronoun meaning “possessor of”. Originally it was an\nabbreviation for dhât al-asmâ’, “the\npossessor of the names”; hence the synonymous term,\nal-musammâ, “the Named”. The Koran refers\nto the Essence as “He” (huwa), which alerts us\nonly to the fact that something is there. The word can just as well be\ntranslated as “It”, of course, because the Essence is\nbeyond gender, but Arabic grammar classifies all nouns and pronouns as\neither masculine or feminine (indeed, when speaking of the Essence,\nIbn ‘Arabî and others use the pronoun hiya,\n“She”, because dhât is feminine, and they\nsometimes explain why the Essence is more properly feminine than\nmasculine; Murata 1992, 196–99). What we know from the names is\nthat “He/She” is merciful, knowing, alive, and so on, but\nin itself the Essence remains unknown. Each name designates a specific\nquality that becomes manifest the moment there is talk of the Real\n(al-haqq) and creation (al-khalq). Hence Ibn\n‘Arabî says that the divine names can properly be called\nrelations (nisab). \nThe unique characteristics of human beings derive from their ability\nto name things, which in turn results from the fact that they alone\nwere created in the form of the all-comprehensive name. A proof-text\nis the verse, “God taught Adam the names, all of them”\n(Koran 2:30). This means not only the names of the\nparticulars—God’s signs in the Three Books—but also\nthe names of the universals, which the Koran calls God’s\n“most beautiful names” (al-asmâ’\nal-husnâ). Human beings in any case have the potential to\nknow all names, but not the Essence named by the names. About that one\ncan only know “that it is” (the fact of its existence),\nnot “what it is” (its quiddity). Inasmuch as the names\ncorrespond to the Essence, their meanings remain unknown, so they are\nsimply markers of transcendence or “incomparability”\n(tanzîh). Inasmuch as they denote an added quality,\nsuch as mercy, knowledge, life, forgiveness, or vengeance, they\nindicate God’s immanence or “similarity”\n(tashbîh). In short, Ibn ‘Arabî’s\ntheological vision combines the apophatic and kataphatic\napproaches. \nForemost among the technical terms of philosophy that Ibn\n‘Arabî employs is wujûd, existence or\nbeing, a word that had come to the center of philosophical discourse\nwith Avicenna. In its Koranic and everyday Arabic sense,\nwujûd means to find, come across, become conscious of,\nenjoy, be ecstatic. It was used to designate existence because what\nexists is what is found and experienced. For Ibn ‘Arabî,\nthe act of finding—that is, perception, awareness, and\nconsciousness—is never absent from the fact of being found. If\non the one hand he speaks of wujûd in the standard\nAvicennan language of necessity and possibility, he simultaneously\ntalks of it—in terms long established by the Sufi\ntradition—as the fullness of divine presence and human\nconsciousness that is achieved in realization (Dobie 2007). \nAmong the Koranic divine names is “Light”\n(al-nûr), for God is “the light of the heavens\nand the earth” (24:35). Naming God “Light” is\ntantamount to naming him Being, for, as Qûnawî explains,\n“True Light brings about perception but is not perceived”,\njust as True Being brings about manifestation and finding but is\nneither manifest nor found. Qûnawî continues by saying\nthat True Light is “identical with the Essence of the Real in\nrespect of Its disengagement from relations and attributions”\n(Qûnawî, al-Fukûk, 225). In other words,\nTrue Light is Nondelimited Being (al-wujûd al-mutlaq),\nand it discloses itself as delimited being (al-wujûd\nal-muqayyad). It is precisely this Light that brings about\nfinding, awareness, and perception. Just as there is no true being but\nGod, so also there is no true finder but God and nothing truly found\nbut God. As Ibn ‘Arabî explains: \nIbn ‘Arabî has typically been called the founder of the\ndoctrine of wahdat al-wujûd, the Oneness of Being or\nthe Unity of Existence, but this is misleading, for he never uses the\nexpression. Passages in his writings that approximate it have no\nspecial significance, nor are they out of place in the general trend\nof contemporary philosophy and theology, both of which affirmed the\nunity of the Necessary Being. Why wahdat al-wujûd was\nsingled out to typify Ibn ‘Arabî’s position is not\nclear. Part of the reason is that he highlights tawhîd\nas his guiding principle and gives wujûd a special\nprominence in his vocabulary. It was utterly obvious to him that there\nis no Real Being but God and that everything other than God is unreal\nbeing; this is another way of saying what Avicenna says, that all\nthings are possible or contingent save the Necessary Being. In short,\nIbn ‘Arabî, and even more so his followers like\nQûnawî, focused on the Real Wujûd as the\none, unique reality from which all other reality derives. On the rare\noccasions when his immediate followers used the expression wahdat\nal-wujûd, they did not give it a technical sense. The first\nauthor to say that Ibn ‘Arabî believed in wahdat\nal-wujûd seems to have been the Hanbalite polemicist Ibn\nTaymiyya (d. 1328), who called it worse than unbelief. According to\nhim, it means that no distinction can be drawn between God and the\nworld. His attack set in motion a long controversy over the term,\noften with little or no attempt to define it. At least seven different\nmeanings were ascribed to it in the later literature, and Orientalists\nfollowed suit, declaring that Ibn ‘Arabî invented the\ndoctrine, and then interpreting it negatively (à la Ibn\nTaymiyya) or, less commonly, positively (à la ‘Abd\nal-Rahmân Jâmî [d. 1492], the first of Ibn\n‘Arabî’s defenders to embrace the expression)\n(Chittick, 1994b). \nTo call Real Being “one” is to speak of the unity of the\nEssence. In other terms, it is to say that Being—Light in\nitself—is nondelimited (mutlaq), that is, infinite and\nabsolute, undefined and indefinable, indistinct and indistinguishable.\nIn contrast, everything other than Being—every existent thing\n(mawjûd)—is distinct, defined, and limited. The\nReal is incomparable and transcendent, but it discloses itself\n(tajallî) in all things, so it is also similar and\nimmanent. It possesses such utter nondelimitation that it is not\ndelimited by nondelimitation. “God possesses Nondelimited Being,\nbut no delimitation prevents Him from delimitation. On the contrary,\nHe possesses all delimitations, so He is nondelimited\ndelimitation” (Ibn ‘Arabî,\nal-Futûhât, 1911 edition, 3:162.23). \nImagination (khayâl), as Corbin has shown, plays a\nmajor role in Ibn ‘Arabî’s writings. In the\nOpenings, for example, he says about it, “After the\nknowledge of the divine names and of self-disclosure and its\nall-pervadingness, no pillar of knowledge is more complete” (Ibn\n‘Arabî, al-Futûhât, 1911 edition,\n2:309.17). He frequently criticizes philosophers and theologians for\ntheir failure to acknowledge its cognitive significance. In his view,\n‘aql or reason, a word that derives from the same root\nas ‘iqâl, fetter, can only delimit, define, and\nanalyze. It perceives difference and distinction, and quickly grasps\nthe divine transcendence and incomparability. In contrast, properly\ndisciplined imagination has the capacity to perceive God’s\nself-disclosure in all Three Books. The symbolic and mythic language\nof scripture, like the constantly shifting and never-repeated\nself-disclosures that are cosmos and soul, cannot be interpreted away\nwith reason’s strictures. What Corbin calls “creative\nimagination” (a term that does not have an exact equivalent in\nIbn ‘Arabî’s vocabulary) must complement rational\nperception. \nIn Koranic terms, the locus of awareness and consciousness is the\nheart (qalb), a word that has the verbal sense of fluctuation\nand transmutation (taqallub). According to Ibn\n‘Arabî, the heart has two eyes, reason and imagination,\nand the dominance of either distorts perception and awareness. The\nrational path of philosophers and theologians needs to be complemented\nby the mystical intuition of the Sufis, the “unveiling”\n(kashf) that allows for imaginal—not\n“imaginary”—vision. The heart, which in itself is\nunitary consciousness, must become attuned to its own fluctuation, at\none beat seeing God’s incomparability with the eye of reason, at\nthe next seeing his similarity with the eye of imagination. Its two\nvisions are prefigured in the two primary names of the Scripture,\nal-qur’ân, “that which brings\ntogether”, and al-furqân, “that which\ndifferentiates”. These two demarcate the contours of ontology\nand epistemology. The first alludes to the unifying oneness of Being\n(perceived by imagination), and the second to the differentiating\nmanyness of knowledge and discernment (perceived by reason). The Real,\nas Ibn ‘Arabî often says, is the One/the Many\n(al-wâhid al-kathîr), that is, One in Essence and\nmany in names, the names being the principles of all multiplicity,\nlimitation, and definition. In effect, with the eye of imagination,\nthe heart sees Being present in all things, and with the eye of reason\nit discerns its transcendence and the diversity of the divine\nfaces. \nWhen Ibn ‘Arabî talks about imagination as one of the\nheart’s two eyes, he is using the language that philosophers\nestablished in speaking of the soul’s faculties. But he is more\nconcerned with imagination’s ontological status, about which the\nearly philosophers had little to say. Here his use of\nkhayâl accords with its everyday meaning, which is\ncloser to image than imagination. It was employed to designate mirror\nimages, shadows, scarecrows, and everything that appears in dreams and\nvisions; in this sense it is synonymous with the term\nmithâl, which was often preferred by later authors. Ibn\n‘Arabî stresses that an image brings together two sides\nand unites them as one; it is both the same as and different from the\ntwo. A mirror image is both the mirror and the object that it\nreflects, or, it is neither the mirror nor the object. A dream is both\nthe soul and what is seen, or, it is neither the soul nor what is\nseen. By nature images are/are not. In the eye of reason, a notion is\neither true or false. Imagination perceives notions as images and\nrecognizes that they are simultaneously true and false, or neither\ntrue nor false. The implications for ontology become clear when we\nlook at the three “worlds of imagination”. \nIn the broadest sense of the term, imagination/image designates\neverything other than God, the entire cosmos inasmuch as it is\ncontingent and evanescent. This is what Ibn ‘Arabî calls\n“Nondelimited Imagination” (al-khayâl\nal-mutlaq). Each of the infinite words articulated in the\nAll-Merciful Breath discloses Being in a limited form. Everything\nwithout exception is both God’s face (wajh), revealing\ncertain divine names, and God’s veil (hijâb),\nconcealing other names. Inasmuch as a thing exists, it can be nothing\nbut that which is, the Real Being; inasmuch as it does not exist, it\nmust be other than the Real. Each thing, in Ibn\n‘Arabî’s most succinct expression, is He/not He\n(huwa/lâ huwa)—Real/unreal, Being/nonexistence,\nFace/veil. “In reality, the ‘other’ is affirmed/not\naffirmed, He/not He” (Ibn ‘Arabî,\nal-Futûhât, 1911 edition, 2:501.4). \nIn a narrower sense of the word, imagination denotes what Corbin calls\nthe mundus imaginalis (‘âlam\nal-khayâl). Like most traditions, Islam conceives of the\ncosmos as a hierarchy of worlds, usually two or three; the Koran\ncontrasts the Unseen (ghayb) with the Visible\n(shahâda), and these are typically called the world of\nspirits and the world of bodies, or, in philosophical terms, the\nintelligible and the sensible realms. The Koran also speaks of\n“heaven, earth, and everything in between”, and one of Ibn\n‘Arabî’s contributions was to bring out the full\nimplications of the in-between realm, which in one respect is unseen,\nspiritual, and intelligible, and in another respect visible,\ncorporeal, and sensible. This is precisely the mundus\nimaginalis, where spiritual beings are corporealized, as when\nGabriel appeared in human form to the Virgin Mary; and where corporeal\nbeings are spiritualized, as when bodily pleasure or pain is\nexperienced in the posthumous realms. The mundus imaginalis\nis a real, external realm in the Cosmic Book, more real than the\nvisible, sensible, physical realm, but less real than the invisible,\nintelligible, spiritual realm. Only its actual existence can account\nfor angelic and demonic apparitions, bodily resurrection, visionary\nexperience, and other nonphysical yet sensory phenomena that\nphilosophers typically explain away. Ibn ‘Arabî’s\nforegrounding of the in-between realm was one of several factors that\nprevented Islamic philosophy from falling into the trap of a mind/body\ndichotomy or a dualistic worldview. \nThe third world of imagination belongs to the microcosmic human book,\nin which it is identical with the soul or self (nafs), which\nis the meeting place of spirit (rûh) and body\n(jism). Human experience is always imaginal or soulish\n(nafsânî), which is to say that it is\nsimultaneously spiritual and bodily. Human becoming wavers between\nspirit and body, light and darkness, wakefulness and sleep, knowledge\nand ignorance, virtue and vice. Only because the soul dwells in an\nin-between realm can it choose to strive for transformation and\nrealization. Only as an imaginal reality can it travel\n“up” toward the luminosity of the spirit or\n“down” toward the darkness of matter. \nIn discussing the ontological role of image/imagination, Ibn\n‘Arabî often uses the term barzakh (isthmus,\nbarrier, limit), which in the Koran is that which stands between the\nsweet and salty seas (25:53, 55:20) and prevents the deceased soul\nfrom returning to the world (23:100). Generally, theologians\nunderstood it to be the “location” of the soul after death\nand before the Day of Resurrection. Ibn ‘Arabî employs the\nterm to designate anything that simultaneously divides and brings\ntogether two things, without itself having two sides, like the\n“line” that separates sunlight and shade. He uses the term\nSupreme Barzakh (al-barzakh al-a‘lâ) as a synonym\nfor Nondelimited Imagination. It is, in other words, the cosmos, the\nrealm of possible things, which in themselves are neither necessary\nnor impossible, neither infinite nor finite. Or, it is the Breath of\nthe All-Merciful, which is neither Nondelimited Being nor articulated\nwords. \nThe divine names designate the universal qualities that suffuse\nexistence, such as life, knowledge, desire, power, speech, generosity,\nand justice (these often being called “the seven leaders”\namong the names). These qualities are found in everything, because\nthey pertain to the very Essence of the Real and accompany its\nself-disclosure. They remain largely nonmanifest, however, because\neach thing has its own preparedness (isti‘dâd) or\nreceptivity (qâbiliyya), and none can display the Real\nper se. Although each thing is a face, each is also a veil; He/not\nHe. \nWhat then determines the measure of preparedness? This goes back to a\nthing’s “reality” (haqîqa), its\n“whatness” or “quiddity”\n(mâhiyya). This is determined not by our definitions,\nbut by God’s knowledge, because he knows the thing always and\nforever, whether or not it exists in the cosmos. Ibn\n‘Arabî commonly refers to the realities simply as\n“things” (ashyâ’, pl. of\nshay’) or “entities”\n(a‘yân, pl. of ‘ayn). They do not\nexist in themselves, because nothing truly exists but the Real Being,\nso they are “the nonexistents”\n(al-ma‘dûmât). In philosophical terms, they\nare “possible” (mumkin), so they may or may not\ncome to exist, in contrast to the Real Being, which is necessary\n(wâjib), so it cannot not exist. \nWhat exactly are things? They are the concomitants\n(lawâzim) of Being, or the potentialities of\nmanifestation latent in Infinite Possibility, or the never-ending\ndelimitations of the Nondelimited. If a thing is found in the cosmos,\nit is a specific self-disclosure of Real Being, a face of God, a word\narticulated in the All-Merciful Breath, a color made visible by the\nradiance of Light. Inasmuch as things appear, they display Being and\nits attributes; inasmuch as their receptivity is delimited and\ndefined, they act as veils. Each is a barzakh, an imaginal\nthing, simultaneously an image of Being and an image of\nnothingness. \nThe philosophers and theologians commonly debated God’s\nknowledge of the particulars. The Koran says repeatedly that God knows\neverything. “Not a leaf falls”, it says, “but God\nknows it” (6:59). Ibn ‘Arabî holds that God’s\nknowledge of both universals and particulars pertains to the Essence\nand does not change. God knows the falling leaf always and forever,\nand when it is time for it to fall, he says to it, “Fall!”\nSo also are all things: “His only command, when He desires a\nthing, is to say to it ‘Be!’, and it comes to be”\n(Koran 36:82). \nIn themselves the known things are nonexistent (like ideas that have\nno existence outside our minds), but when God issues the\n“engendering command” (al-amr\nal-takwînî)—the word “Be!”\n(kun)—they enter into being (kawn). Ibn\n‘Arabî calls the thingness of the things in the divine\nknowledge “the thingness of fixity” (shay’iyyat\nal-thubût), because the things in themselves never change.\nDespite appearances, the engendering command does not remove them from\ntheir fixity, for nothing becomes manifest but Being, though delimited\nand defined by the thingness of the things. The common example is\nlight: When it shines through a piece of colored glass, it appears as\ncolored, but light alone is manifest. \nMost famously, Ibn ‘Arabî discusses the things known to\nGod as “fixed entities” (a‘yân\nthâbita). Early translators opted for expressions like\nimmutable or permanent “archetypes” or\n“essences”, without noting that there is no difference in\nwhatness between “fixed entities” and “existent\nentities” (a‘yân mawjûda). The fixed\nentities are the things inasmuch as they are nonexistent in themselves\nbut known to God; the existent entities are the exact same things\ninasmuch as they have been given a certain imaginal or delimited\nexistence by the engendering command. The fixed entities are not the\n“archetypes” of the existent entities but are rather\nidentical (‘ayn) with them; nor are they\n“essences”, if by this is meant anything other than the\nentities’ specific whatness. \nBy having recourse to the fixity of entities in the divine knowledge,\nIbn ‘Arabî is able to say that the dispute between\ntheologians and philosophers over the eternity of the world goes back\nto their perception of the entities. Those who maintain that the world\nis eternal have understood that “the Real is never qualified by\nfirst not seeing the cosmos, then seeing it. On the contrary, He never\nceases seeing it.” Those who maintain that the world is\nqualified by new arrival (hudûth) “consider the\nexistence of the cosmos in relation to its own entity”, which is\nnonexistent. Hence they understand that it must have come into\nexistence (Ibn ‘Arabî, al-Futûhât,\n1911 edition, 2:666.35). \nFollowers of Ibn ‘Arabî sometimes distinguished between\ndivine names and entities by calling the former “universal\nnames” and the latter “particular names”. Ibn\n‘Arabî observes theological norms when he declares that\nthe divine names are “conditional”\n(tawqîfî), which is to say that we should call\nGod only by those names that he himself uses in scripture. Ibn\n‘Arabî also acknowledges, however, that every single thing\nis a divine name, because each designates the Nondelimited in respect\nof a certain delimitation. In this sense, each thing, each entity, is\na “specific face” (wajh khâss) of God that\ndifferentiates it from every other thing. After quoting the prophetic\nsaying that God has “ninety-nine” names, Ibn\n‘Arabî explains that these names designate the\n“mothers” of the names, which give birth to all the rest.\nHe continues: \nIbn al-‘Arabî calls the word shay’, thing,\n“one of the most indefinite of the indefinites” (min\nankar al-nakirât), because it can refer to anything\nwhatsoever, existent or nonexistent, real or unreal. Nonetheless, he\ntells us that he avoids using it in reference to God because God does\nnot use it to name himself. He does call God an entity, however,\nespecially in the phrase “the One Entity”\n(al-‘ayn al-wâhida), typically in contexts that\nbring to mind what the later tradition sometimes called the doctrine\nof the Oneness of Being. For example: \nIbn ‘Arabî does in fact refer to God as a thing in one\npassage of an early work, and this has caught the attention of several\nobservers, because he mentions there “the third thing”, a\nnotion that seems to throw light on his whole approach (Takeshita\n1982, Bashier 2004). At first he seems to be talking in the standard\nAvicennan language of necessity and possibility, but then he brings up\nthe notion of barzakh to explain how these two can be\ninterrelated. Things, he says, can be divided into three sorts. The\nfirst sort is qualified by wujûd in its very essence,\nand this is the Necessary Being, God, who is nondelimited in existence\n(mutlaq al-wujûd) and who bestows existence on all\nthings. The second sort is existent (mawjûd) through\nGod, namely delimited existence (al-wujûd al-muqayyad),\nwhich is the cosmos, everything other than God. “As for the\nThird Thing”, he writes: \nGiven the detailed description of the Third Thing provided in the full\npassage, it is clear that Ibn ‘Arabî is discussing\nNondelimited Imagination as the Supreme Barzakh. The Third Thing,\nhowever, never became established as a technical term, in contrast to\nthe synonym that he mentions in this same passage, the Reality of\nRealities, also called the Universal Reality and the Muhammadan\nReality. Reality (haqîqa), as already noted, is used to\nmean entity, quiddity, thing, and possible thing, though it is\ncommonly used more broadly as well. Thus God’s Koranic names are\ncalled realities, but not entities or things. \nBy mentioning “universal” realities in talking about the\nThird Thing, Ibn ‘Arabî means the divine names and\nattributes, which become manifest through the particular realities,\nthe entities. He has in view a version of the Tree of Porphyry, though\nhe never uses the expression: Each individual (leaf) is a member of a\nspecies (twig), which in turn belongs to a genus (branch), and so on,\nuntil all are eventually subsumed under the genus of the genera, the\nReality of Realities. This Reality is neither the Necessary Being nor\nthe cosmos. In God it is the divine knowledge of all things, and as\nsuch is eternal; in the cosmos, it is the ever-changing totality that\nis temporal creation. Drawing from terminology he uses elsewhere, his\nfollowers call this Reality in God “the Most Holy\nEffusion” (al-fayd al-aqdas), and they define it as\nGod’s self-disclosure to himself in himself, or the\nself-knowledge by which he knows every concomitant of his own\ninfinity. They contrast it with “the Holy Effusion”\n(al-fayd al-muqaddas), the creative act that brings all\nrealities and entities into manifestation. \nQûnawî gave currency to a technical term,\nta‘ayyun or “entification”, that plays a\nmajor role in discussions of the Reality of Realities among Ibn\n‘Arabî’s followers. The word is derived from\n‘ayn, entity, and it means to become an entity. Given\nthat an entity is a thing, one might translate it as\n“reification”, not in the sense of a human cognitive\nprocess, however, but as a designation for the manner in which\nNondelimited Being becomes determined, limited, defined, and\n“thingish” in the process of disclosing itself as\neverything other than God. Thus all things are entifications or\ndelimitations or determinations of the Nondelimited Real, which is\nthen called “the Nonentification” (al-lâ\nta‘ayyun). As for the Reality of Realities, it is the First\nEntification, because all other entifications follow in its wake. \nIn her lengthy, though far from complete, study of Ibn\n‘Arabî’s technical terms, Su‘âd\nal-Hakîm mentions forty synonyms for the Reality of Realities,\nall under the heading al-insân al-kâmil,\n“the Perfect Man”. This notion, which can perhaps best be\nunderstood in Western terms as the Divine Logos through which all\nthings are created, stands at the center of Ibn\n‘Arabî’s worldview and integrates all its disparate\ndimensions. Hakîm does not mention the Third Thing as one of the\nsynonyms, but the continuation of the passage in which Ibn\n‘Arabî speaks of it does make clear that the Reality of\nRealities is indeed the reality (or the fixed entity) of the Perfect\nMan: \nAfter tawhîd, the remaining two principles of Islamic\nfaith are prophecy (nubuwwa) and the Return\n(ma‘âd), a word that is often translated loosely\nas eschatology. For both philosophers and Sufis, discussion of\nprophecy focused on human deiformity, and the issues they raised led\ntheologians and jurists to accuse them of claiming to be greater than\nthe prophets; Ibn ‘Arabî in particular was the center of a\nlong controversy over the relative merits of prophet and saint\n(Chodkiewicz 1993b). \nBoth schools of thought also had a great deal to say about the Return,\nwhich was viewed in two respects: compulsory and voluntary. From the\nstandpoint of the compulsory Return, the cosmos unfolds following its\nown ineluctable laws, and human beings go back to God in a series of\nstages that mirror the stages of cosmogenesis. From the standpoint of\nthe voluntary Return, free will allows human beings to play a role in\ndetermining the trajectory of their own becoming. To a certain degree\nthey are co-creators of their own souls and the posthumous realms,\nwhich are experienced in karmic terms, that is, as the result of a\nchain of causality set in motion by their own individual\nunderstandings, character traits, and activities. Ibn\n‘Arabî marks a watershed in the discussion of both sorts\nof Return, not least because his explications of the mundus\nimaginalis allowed him to provide rational arguments for issues\nlike bodily resurrection that, according to Avicenna, could not be\nunderstood by reason but can only be accepted on the basis of faith\n(Avicenna, al-Shifâ’, 347–48; Avicenna,\nal-Najât, 3:291). Ibn ‘Arabî’s leads\nwere expanded on by later thinkers, most exhaustively by Mullâ\nSadrâ in the fourth book of his magnum opus, al-Asfâr\nal-arba‘a, on the topic of the soul and its unfolding\n(Mullâ Sadrâ 2008). \nWhen the theologians discussed the Return, they tried to prove the\naccuracy of the Koranic depictions of the Day of Resurrection, hell,\nand paradise, mainly by appealing to the authority of God’s\nword. They had little to say about the actual nature of the soul, the\nstructure of the cosmos, or the ontological status of the posthumous\nrealms. In contrast, both philosophers and Sufis were intensely\ninterested in these issues, as well as in the complementary question\nof the Origin (mabda’). Origin and Return became major\nthemes in both schools of thought, but, in contrast to the\nphilosophers, Sufis highlighted the exemplary role of Muhammad. Thus,\nfor example, they drew a favorite image from a Koranic verse related\nto the Prophet’s “night journey”\n(isrâ’, also called the\nmi‘râj or “ladder”), when he was\ntaken up through and beyond the heavens to encounter God: “He\nwas two-bows’-length away, or closer” (53:9). In Arabic\nthe word qaws or bow, like Latin arcus, also means\nthe arc of a circle, so the two bows can be understood as two arcs.\nThese came to be called “the descending arc” (al-qaws\nal-nuzûlî), that is, the path of increasing\ndelimitation and darkness that leads away from the Origin, and\n“the ascending arc” (al-qaws\nal-su‘ûdî), the ever-increasing disengagement\n(tajarrud) and luminosity of the soul on the path of the\nReturn. \nIt was noted that one of Ibn ‘Arabî’s cosmological\nschemes describes the universe in terms of twenty-eight letters that\narticulate words in the All-Merciful Breath. Twenty-one of these\nletters correspond to stages of the descending arc, which reaches its\nlowest point with the four elements. The remaining letters designate\nthe stages of the ascending arc, beginning with minerals, going on to\nplants, animals, angels, and jinn, and then on to man, the\ntwenty-seventh letter. The twenty-eighth and final letter designates\n“the levels, stations, and stages”, that is, the invisible\ndegrees of perfection achieved by the unfolding of human souls on the\npath of the Return. \nThe decisive difference between animals and humans lies not in speech\nor rationality, but rather in the fact that man was created in the\nform of God per se, that is, God as designated by the\nall-comprehensive name. Everything else was created under the care of\nless comprehensive names. Adam’s divine form is God’s\nall-inclusive face, the Reality of Realities that embraces the full\nrange of possible entifications of Nondelimited Being. The human\nmicrocosm has the potential to realize—that is, to actualize the\nreality of—everything present in the Book of the Cosmos and the\nBook of Scripture. Just as the visible, corporeal world came into\nmanifestation by way of several stages of entification, beginning with\nthe Reality of Realities and descending by way of the invisible worlds\nuntil it reached the minerals, so also the “levels, stations,\nand stages” come into existence through the on-going\nself-disclosure of Real Being in the invisible realms of the ascending\narc and reach their fruition when they return to the Origin. It is at\nthat point that the circle of existence is completed, the dividing\nline disappears, and the imaginal distinction between Real and\ncreation is effaced. As Ibn ‘Arabî writes: \nHuman embodiment at the visible level represents an essential stage in\nthe manifestation of the Reality of Realities, but realization of that\nReality takes place within the soul, that is, on the imaginal and\nspiritual levels. The possibilities of manifestation represented by\nplants and animals are relatively limited; external appearance reveals\ntheir secrets to observers, and no one confuses a cabbage with a\ncarrot, or a horse with a donkey. But such is not the case with human\nbeings, whose external uniformity conceals an unlimited inner\ndiversity. The imaginal and spiritual contours of human souls, their\nawareness and character traits, can never be judged by the\nbody’s appearance; human virtue and vice pertain to unseen\nrealms. Culture, art, literature, politics, science, technology, and\nother peculiarly human accomplishments are the soul’s\nexteriorizations. Ibn ‘Arabî is not concerned, however,\nwith every human possibility, because the paths that lead away from\nthe full and balanced realization of the divine form are legion.\nRather, he wants to delineate the broad contours of the perfections of\ndeiformity, for it is these that lead to harmony with the Real in the\nposthumous realms. Even on this level, however, it is impossible even\nto enumerate these perfections, given that, as he tells us, their\narchetypes number 124,000, in keeping with the number of prophets from\nthe time of Adam. \nIbn ‘Arabî often addresses the cosmic uniqueness of human\nbeings in terms of the command (amr), an important Koranic\nterm that has a strong bearing on the way in which theologians and\nphilosophers addressed the issue of determinism and free will, or\nnature and nurture. It was said earlier that the “engendering\ncommand” (al-amr al-takwînî) is the\ncreative word “Be!” (kun) and that it turns\nnonexistent entities into existent entities. God addresses this\ncommand to all existent things without exception, and everything is\nobedient to it. It provides no way to distinguish between right and\nwrong, good and evil, better and worse, because all things are exactly\nwhat they must be. Everything manifests the Real, al-Haqq,\nand each is a specific face of God with its own haqq. From\nthis standpoint, nothing in the cosmos is\nbâtil—false, vain, or wrong. \nThe fact is, however, that human beings, created in the form of\nGod’s all-comprehensive name, are always faced with choices.\nRational investigation is handicapped in its ability to choose the\ngood over the bad, the right over the wrong, the beautiful over the\nugly, the haqq over the bâtil, because,\nwithout outside help, it cannot transcend the evanescent images that\nmake up the appearance of the cosmos. It has no access to the ultimate\ncriteria whereby the haqq of things—their reality,\ntruth, rightness, and appropriateness vis-à-vis the\nReal—can be discerned. In other words, the cosmic and human\nbooks cannot be interpreted rightly (bi’l-haqq) without\nguidance (hudâ) from the Real (al-haqq), the\nauthor of the engendering command. Guidance is precisely the function\nof the prophets, by means of whom God issues commandments and\nprohibitions. This act of issuing is called “the prescriptive\ncommand” (al-amr al-taklîfî), because it\nsets down principles and directives that need to be followed in order\nto discern the haqqs of things and act appropriately. \nThe engendering command brings the cosmos into existence, but the\ndivine attributes demand much more than life, awareness, desire,\npower, and other qualities that are presupposed by the existence of\nminerals, plants, and animals. Among the ontological possibilities\nactually present in the Essence and actually manifest in the universe\nare mercy, love, compassion, forgiveness, justice, fairness, wisdom,\nand many other moral and ethical traits whose significance only\nbecomes clear in human activity and interactions. All these are\nontological qualities, but, in order for them to become fully\nmanifest, the engendering command must give rise to the prescriptive\ncommand, which instructs people in the haqq of love, mercy,\nbeneficence, kindness, and other traits. Becoming rightly\ncharacterized by the divine names does not happen simply by the\nnatural course of events; it calls for the engagement of the will.\nOnly by choosing the haqq over the bâtil,\nright over wrong, good over evil, can people realize the full\npossibilities of their own deiformity. \nBy making guidance available, the prescriptive command also provides\nthe possibility of error and misguidance. It is the occasion, in other\nwords, for the actualization of various possibilities of being and\nbecoming that are demanded by divine attributes such as severity,\nwrath, pride, and vengeance, not to speak of forgiveness and pardon.\nIn any case, human beings, through their own freedom, play a role in\nactualizing possibilities of the Divine Infinity that otherwise would\nhave no raison d’être, paradise and hell being the most\nsalient examples. Distinguishing between the two commands allows us to\ngrasp the difference between fact and value, between what is and what\nought to be. But these are two sides of the same self-disclosure of\nBeing. By issuing commands and prohibitions, the Real introduces\ncausal factors that force human beings to assume responsibility for\nwhat they will become on the moral and spiritual levels. This is why\nIbn ‘Arabî says that people are “compelled to be\nfree” (majbûr fî ikhtiyârihim). The\ndegree to which they conform to the letter and spirit of the\nprescriptive command determines “the levels, stations, and\nstages” that they will reach in the ascending arc of the Return;\nposthumously, their levels and stages will become differentiated in\nthe ascending levels of paradise and the descending levels of hell.\nWithout human (or analogous, all-comprehensive, free beings), an\ninfinity of ontological possibilities would not find their\nactualization. As Ibn ‘Arabî puts it, “If not for\nus, the next world would never become differentiated from this\nworld” (Ibn ‘Arabî, al-Futûhât,\n1911 edition, 3:253.21). \nLike the philosophers, Ibn ‘Arabî sees the human soul as\nan unlimited potential and understands the goal of life to lie in the\nactualization of that potential. Avicenna sums up the philosophical\nview in a passage found in two of his major works: \nIbn ‘Arabî agrees with this general picture, but he\nconsiders it barren, because it fails to take into account those\ndimensions of reality—the vast majority of dimensions, as he\nsees it—that do not properly belong to the world of\nintellection; all the intermediary realms, not to speak of the\nsensible realm itself, are essentially imaginal, not intelligible. He\ninsists, in fact, that “Imagination is the widest known\nthing” because “it exercises its properties through its\nreality over every thing and non-thing. It gives form to absolute\nnonexistence, the impossible, the Necessary, and possibility; it makes\nexistence nonexistent and nonexistence existent” (Ibn\n‘Arabî, al-Futûhât, 1911 edition,\n1:306.17, 306.6). \nIn several passages, Ibn ‘Arabî describes the ascent of\nthe soul on the ladder (mi‘râj) to God. One of\nthese is Chapter 167 of the Openings, called “On the true\nknowledge of the alchemy of happiness”. Here he contrasts the\nparallel ladders of a philosopher and a prophet’s follower. In\neach stage, the follower meets what Muhammad met in his Night Journey,\nbut the philosopher finds only what his knowledge of the natural world\nallows him to find; in short, when seekers pass through the ascending\nrealms of the mundus imaginalis, they gain what accords with\ntheir own cognitive preparation. In the first heaven, for example, the\nfollower meets the prophet Adam, whom God had “taught all the\nnames”, and he benefits from Adam’s omniscience, but the\nphilosopher meets only the moon. In each successive level, the\nfollower encounters a prophet and assimilates his knowledge, but the\nphilosopher finds the celestial spheres (Ibn ‘Arabî,\nal-Futûhât, Chapter 167, 1997, 2019). It is worth\nnoting that Avicenna himself had written an interpretation of\nMuhammad’s night journey in philosophical terms that runs\nparallel to what Ibn ‘Arabî ascribes to the philosopher\nhere, but the text was in Persian, so Ibn ‘Arabî would not\nhave seen it (Heath 1992). \nEach of “the levels, stations, and stages” represents an\nactualization of a potential deiformity, or an instance of becoming\ncharacterized by one or more divine names. Each divine attribute and\neach prophetic archetype sets up a “station”\n(maqâm) in which human beings can stand and from which\nthey can observe the nature of things. There are countless stations of\nknowledge and spiritual perfection, and each bestows specific\ncharacter traits and points of view. Ibn ‘Arabî often\ntells us that such-and-such a chapter of the Openings\npertains to the standpoint of Moses, or Jesus, or Abraham. In the same\nway, he divides Ringstones into twenty-seven chapters, each\nof which is dedicated to a prophet or sage who is presented as a word\nor logos (kalima) embodying the wisdom (hikma) of a\nspecific divine name. His ultimate purpose in describing the various\nstandpoints is to highlight the Station of No Station (maqâm\nlâ maqâm), also called “the Muhammadan\nStation”. This is full realization of the Reality of Realities;\nit embraces all stations and standpoints without being determined and\ndefined by any of them. “The people of perfection have realized\nall stations and states and passed beyond these to the station above\nboth majesty and beauty, so they have no attribute and no\ndescription” (Ibn ‘Arabî,\nal-Futûhât, 1911 edition, 2:133.19). \nPerfect Man, standing in the Station of No Station, is in effect the\nhuman analogue of Nondelimited Being, which assumes every delimitation\nwithout itself becoming limited. Qûnawî sometimes calls\nthis station “the point at the center of the circle of\nexistence” because it has no dimensions in itself, but all of\nmanifest reality is arranged in reference to it. He also explains it\nin terms of the contrast between Being and quiddity (i.e., fixed\nentity). Everyone other than Perfect Man has a specific whatness,\ndistinguishing him from everyone else, which is to say that each\nperson stands in a defined “level, station, and stage”.\nPerfect Man, however, manifests the Real per se, so his whatness is\nidentical with Being, not with this or that. Qûnawî\nwrites: \nAs the model of human possibility, Perfect Man represents the\nindividual who has traversed the circle of existence, reached the\nstation of Two-Bows’ Length, and returned to his origin, the\nReality of Realities. Standing in the Station of No Station, he is\nHe/not He, Eternal/newly arrived, Infinite/finite. He alone functions\nas God’s “vicegerent” (khalîfa) or\nrepresentative, the intermediary between God and creation, which is\nprecisely the role for which Adam was created (Koran 2:30).\nQûnawî writes: \nTo put this in another way, Perfect Man is the spirit that animates\nthe cosmos. This is the theme that begins the first chapter of Ibn\n‘Arabî’s Ringstones, which explains the\nmanner in which Adam—the human being—manifests the wisdom\nof the all-comprehensive name. In a parallel way, he writes in the\nOpenings: \nIbn ‘Arabî’s followers often summarized the notion\nof Perfect Man by having recourse to a scheme that came to be known as\n“the Five Divine Presences” (al-hadarât\nal-ilâhiyyat al-khams). Ibn ‘Arabî uses\npresence (hadra) to designate any realm in which Being (i.e.,\nfinding and being found) becomes manifest under the auspices of a\ngeneral quality; in this sense it is roughly synonymous with world\n(‘âlam) or level (martaba). In one\npassage, for example, he explains that the cosmos is made up of two\nworlds or two presences, that of the Unseen and that of the Visible,\n“though a third presence is born between the two from their\nhaving come together”, and that is the world of imagination (Ibn\n‘Arabî, al-Futûhât, 1911 edition,\n3:42.5). Most commonly, as in his chapter on the divine names in\nOpenings, he uses presence to designate a name’s realm\nof influence and then describes various ways in which the properties\nand traces of the name are displayed in the cosmos and human beings;\none might say that he is describing how things participate in Platonic\nideas. The most inclusive of these presences is the\n“divine” (al-hadrat al-ilâhiyya), that is,\nthe realm that comes under the sway of the all-comprehensive name.\nConcerning it Ibn ‘Arabî writes, “There is nothing\nin Being/existence [wujûd] but the Divine Presence,\nwhich is His Essence, His attributes, and His acts” (Ibn\n‘Arabî, al-Futûhât, 1911 edition,\n2:114.14). \nQûnawî seems to have been the first to speak of “the\nFive Divine Presences”, and the expression soon became\ncommonplace, though several different schemes were proposed. He uses\nthe expression to explain how the Reality of Realities, or the First\nEntification, embraces all entifications and thereby becomes manifest\nin five basic realms. The first presence is the Reality of Realities\nin divinis, embracing the divine knowledge of the cosmos. The second,\nthird, and fourth presences are the same three worlds about which Ibn\n‘Arabî spoke: the unseen (spiritual), the imaginal, and\nthe visible (corporeal). The fifth presence is Perfect Man in his\nall-comprehensive deployment, embracing the other four presences in a\nsynthetic whole: his fixed entity is identical with the Reality of\nRealities, his spirit with the unseen world, his soul with the\nimaginal world, and his body with the visible realm (Chittick 1984).\nIn this way of conceiving of man, the role that the Logos plays in\ngiving birth to the cosmos is clear. Qûnawî puts it in a\nnutshell: Perfect Man is “the perfected human reality of the\nEssence, one of whose levels is the Godhead\n[al-ulûhiyya]; all existent things are the loci of\nmanifestation for his differentiated qualities and properties”\n(Qûnawî, al-Nafahât, 66–67).","contact.mail":"wchittick@notes.cc.sunysb.edu","contact.domain":"notes.cc.sunysb.edu"}]
