This entry focusses on the nature of faith,\nalthough issues about the justifiability of faith are also\nimplicated.\n\n\n‘Faith’is a broad term, appearing in locutions that\nexpress a range of different concepts. At its most general\n‘faith’ means much the same as ‘trust’. This\nentry is specifically concerned, however, with the notion of\nreligious faith—or, rather (and this qualification is\nimportant), the kind of faith exemplified in religious faith.\nPhilosophical accounts are almost exclusively about theistic\nreligious faith—faith in God—and they generally, though\nnot exclusively, deal with faith as understood within the Christian\nbranch of the Abrahamic traditions. But, although the theistic\nreligious context settles what kind of faith is of interest, the\nquestion arises whether faith of that same general kind also\nbelongs to other, non-theistic, religious contexts, or to contexts not\nusually thought of as religious at all. Arguably, it may be apt to\nspeak of the faith of a humanist, or even an atheist, using the same\ngeneral sense of ‘faith’ as applies to the theist\ncase.\n\n\nThe present discussion focuses on theistic religious faith as a\nparadigm of the kind of faith that is of interest, though the question\nof faith outside this context is taken up in the final Section (11).\nPhilosophical reflection on theistic religious faith has produced\ndifferent accounts or models of its nature. This entry suggests that\nthere are several key components that may feature, with varying\nemphases, in models of faith—in particular, the\naffective, the cognitive, the evaluative\nand the practical (or, as some may say, the\nvolitional). It suggests also that there is a variety of\ndifferent principles according to which models of faith may be\ncategorized, including\n\nhow the model relates faith as a state to the active components\nassociated with faith;\n\nwhether the model takes the object of faith to be exclusively\npropositional or not;\n\nthe type of epistemology with which the model is associated—\nwhether it is broadly ‘evidentialist’ or\n‘fideist’;\n\nwhether the model is necessarily restricted to theistic religious\nfaith, or may extend beyond it.\n\nThere is no single ‘established’ terminology for different\nmodels of faith. A brief initial characterisation of the principal\nmodels of faith and their nomenclature as they feature in this\ndiscussion may nevertheless be helpful—they are:\n\nthe ‘purely affective’ model: faith as a\nfeeling of existential confidence\n\nthe ‘special knowledge’ model: faith as\nknowledge of specific truths, revealed by God\n\nthe ‘belief’ model: faith as belief\nthat God exists (where the object of belief is a certain\nproposition)\n\nthe ‘trust’ model: faith as believing\nin (in the sense of trusting in) God (where the object of\nbelief or trust is not a proposition, but God\n‘himself’)\n\nthe ‘doxastic venture’ model: faith as\npractical commitment beyond the evidence to one’s belief that God\nexists\n\n‘sub-’ and ‘non-doxastic venture’\nmodels: faith as practical commitment to a relevant positively\nevaluated truth-claim, yet without belief\n\nthe ‘hope’ model: faith as hoping—or\nacting in the hope that—the God who saves exists.\n\nThe entry proceeds dialectically, with later sections presupposing the\nearlier discussion.\n\nWhile philosophical reflection on faith of the kind exemplified in\nreligious faith might ideally hope to yield an agreed definition in\nterms of sufficient and necessary conditions that articulate the\nnature of faith, the present discussion proceeds by identifying key\ncomponents that recur in different accounts of religious faith. It\nalso aims to identify a focal range of issues on which different\nstances are taken by different accounts. There is a plurality of\nexisting philosophical understandings or models of faith of the\nreligious kind. This discussion therefore aims to set out\ndialectically an organisation of this plurality, while also giving\nindications of the reasons there may be for preferring particular\nmodels over others. Since ‘religion’ itself may well be a\n‘family resemblance’ universal, essentialism about faith\nof the religious kind might be misplaced. Nevertheless, the concept of\nfaith as found in the Abrahamic, theist, religious traditions is\nwidely regarded as unified enough for an inquiry into its nature to\nmake sense, even if a successful real definition is too much to expect\n(this kind of faith might conceivably be a conceptual primitive, for\nexample). \nNote that some philosophers approach the target of religious faith by\nfirst classifying and analysing ordinary language uses of the term\n‘faith’ and locutions in which that term occurs. See, for\nrecent examples, Audi 2011 (Chapter 3, Section I), who identifies\nseven different kinds of faith, and Howard-Snyder (2013b), who\nattempts a general analysis of ‘propositional’\nfaith— i.e., faith that p is true, where p is a relevant\nproposition. The present discussion, however, deals directly with the\ntarget notion of the kind of faith exemplified in religious\nfaith, assuming the background of a working grasp of the notion\nas deployed in religious forms of life, and specifically in those\nbelonging to the theist traditions. Insights from the analysis of\nfaith understood more broadly may, nevertheless, be important in\nconstructing models of faith of the religious kind, as will emerge\nbelow in the discussion of religious faith as a kind of trust (Section\n6). \nThe notion of religious faith as the possession of a whole people is\nfamiliar, and arguably theologically primary in the theist traditions.\nPhilosophical accounts of theistic faith typically focus, however, on\nwhat it is for an individual person to ‘have faith’ or be\n‘a person of faith’. An initial broad distinction is\nbetween thinking of faith just as a person’s state and\nthinking of it as also involving a person’s act, action or\nactivity. Faith may be a state one is in, or comes to be in; it\nmay also essentially involve something one does. An adequate account\nof faith, perhaps, needs to encompass both. In the Christian context\nfaith is understood both as a gift of God and also as requiring a\nhuman response of assent and trust, so that their faith is something\nwith respect to which people are both receptive and active. \nThere is, however, some tension in understanding faith both as a gift\nto be received and as essentially involving a venture to be willed and\nenacted. A philosophical account of faith may be expected to\nilluminate this apparent paradox. One principle for classifying models\nof faith is according to the extent to which they recognise an active\ncomponent in faith itself, and the way they identify that active\ncomponent and its relation to faith’s other components. It is helpful\nto consider the components of faith (variously recognised and\nemphasised in different models of faith) as falling into three broad\ncategories: the affective, the cognitive and the\npractical. There are also evaluative components in\nfaith—these may appear as implicated in the affective and/or the\ncognitive components, according to one’s preferred meta-theory of\nvalue. \nOne component of faith is a certain kind of affective psychological\nstate—namely, a state of feeling confident and trusting. Some\nphilosophers hold that faith is to be identified simply with such a\nstate: see, for example, Clegg (1979, 229) who suggests that this may\nhave been Wittgenstein’s understanding. Faith in this sense—as\none’s overall ‘default’ attitude on life—provides a\nvaluable foundation for flourishing: its loss is recognised as the\npsychic calamity of ‘losing one’s faith’. But if\nfoundational existential confidence is to feature in a model of faith\nof the kind exemplified by theists, more needs to be added about the\nkind of confidence involved. Theistic faith is essentially faith\nin God. In general, faith of the kind exemplified by theistic\nfaith must have some intentional object. It may thus be\nargued that an adequate model of this kind of faith cannot reduce to\nsomething purely affective: some broadly cognitive\ncomponent is also required. \nWhat kind of cognitive component belongs to faith, then? One model\nidentifies faith as knowledge of specific truths, revealed by\nGod. Such a model has received prominent recent defence in the work of\nAlvin Plantinga, who proposes a model of faith which he takes to\nfollow in the tradition of the reformers, principally John Calvin (see\nPlantinga 2000, 168-86). Calvin defines faith thus: ‘a firm and\ncertain knowledge of God’s benevolence towards us, founded upon the\ntruth of the freely given promise in Christ, both revealed to our\nminds and sealed upon our hearts through the Holy Spirit’ (John\nCalvin, Institutes III, ii, 7, 551, quoted by Plantinga\n(2000, 244)). \nAppeal to a special cognitive faculty \n‘Reformed’ epistemologists have appealed to an externalist\nepistemology in order to maintain that theistic belief may be\njustified even though its truth is no more than basically\nevident to the believer—that is, its truth is not rationally\ninferable from other, more basic, beliefs, but is found to be\nimmediately evident in the believer’s experience (see Plantinga and\nWolterstorff 1983, Alston 1991, Plantinga 2000). On Plantinga’s\nversion, theistic beliefs count as knowledge because they are produced\nby the operation of a special cognitive faculty whose functional\ndesign fits it for the purpose of generating true beliefs about God.\nPlantinga calls this the sensus divinitatis, using a term of\nCalvin’s. (For discussion of the extent to which Plantinga’s use\nof this term conforms to Calvin’s own usage see Jeffreys 1997\nand Helm 1998.) This quasi-perceptual faculty meets functional\ncriteria as a mechanism that confers ‘warrant’ (where\nwarrant is whatever must be added to true belief to yield knowledge)\nand, granted theism’s truth, it yields knowledge because God designs\nit just for that purpose. In defence of specifically Christian belief,\nPlantinga argues that the same warrant-conferring status belongs to\nthe operation of the Holy Spirit in making the great truths of the\nGospel directly known to the believer. \nThe welcome certainty of faith \nThis appeal to a God-given ‘higher’ cognitive faculty is\nfound (in the early 12th Century) in al-Ghazâlî’s\nDeliverance from Error, where it provides the key to the\n‘Sufi’ resolution of his religious crisis and his\nsceptical doubts about the deliverances of sense perception and\nunassisted human reason. Faith is thus understood as a kind of\nknowledge attended by a certainty that excludes doubt. But faith will\nnot be exclusively cognitive, if, as in Calvin’s definition,\nfaith-knowledge is not only ‘revealed to our minds’ but\nalso ‘sealed upon our hearts’. For, on this model faith\nwill also have an affective/evaluative component that includes a\nwelcoming of the knowledge received. \nPractical aspects of faith on the‘special knowledge’\nmodel \nThis model of faith as special knowledge, certain and welcome,\nexhibits faith as essentially something to be received. Nevertheless,\nthe model may admit a practical component, since an active response is\nrequired for reception of the divine gift. Such a practical component\nis implied by the real possibility that faith may be resisted: indeed,\nChristians may hold that in our sinful state we will inevitably offer\na resistance to faith that may be overcome only by God’s grace. It is,\nhowever, a further step for persons of faith to put their revealed\nknowledge into practice by trusting their lives to God and seeking to\nobey his will. On this ‘special knowledge’ model of faith,\nhowever, this activity counts as ‘acting out’ one’s faith\nrather than as a part of faith itself. Persons of faith thus act\n‘in’, ‘through’ or ‘by’ faith:\nbut, on this model, their faith itself is the welcomed revealed\nknowledge on which they act. \nFaith seems to involve some kind of venture, even if talk of\na ‘leap of faith’ may not be wholly apt. It is thus widely\nheld that faith goes beyond what is ordinarily reasonable, in\nthe sense that it involves accepting what cannot be established as\ntrue through the proper exercise of our naturally endowed human\ncognitive faculties—and this may be held to be an essential\nfeature of faith. As Kant famously reports, in the Preface to the\nSecond Edition of his Critique of Pure Reason: ‘I have\n… found it necessary to deny knowledge, in order to\nmake room for faith’ (Kant 1787/1933, 29). As well,\nhowever, theist philosophers typically desire to show that faith is\nnot ‘contrary to reason’. On models of faith that take a\ncognitive component as central, and construe faith’s object as\npropositional, reasonable faith arguably needs to conform to an\nevidentialist principle, generally thought essential to\nrationality, requiring belief commitments to accord with the extent of\nthe support for their truth given by one’s total available evidence.\nFaith’s venturesomeness is thus in tension with its reasonableness,\nand models of faith differ in the way they negotiate this tension by\ntaking a particular stance on ‘faith and reason’. Another\nclassificatory principle, then, is in terms of the type of\nepistemology of faith each particular model generates. \nThe epistemology of the ‘special knowledge’\nmodel \nThe ‘special knowledge’ model of faith generates an\nepistemology under which, although ordinary cognitive faculties and\nsources of evidence do not yield certain knowledge of theistic truths,\nthere is a ‘higher’ cognitive faculty that neatly makes up\nthe deficit. This model seems thus to secure the rationality of faith:\nif faith consists in beliefs that have the status of knowledge, surely\nfaith cannot fail to be rational. And, once the deliverances of the\nspecial cognitive faculty are included amongst the believer’s basic\nexperiential evidence, the evidential requirement on reasonable belief\nis surely satisfied. (Note that Plantinga originally expressed his\ndefence of ‘properly basic’ theistic belief in terms of\nthe rationality of believing in God ‘without any evidence or\nargument at all’ (Plantinga 1983, 17). He does respect the\nevidential requirement, however, holding that this requirement may be\nfully met through what is basically, non-inferentially, evident in the\nbeliever’s experience. Hence Plantinga’s insistence that\nhis Reformed epistemology is not fideistic (Plantinga 2000, 263).) \nReflective faith and the question of entitlement \nThe above considerations may aspire to win the high ground in the\n‘faith and reason’ debate for the ‘special\nknowledge’ model. It is not clear, however, that this aspiration\ncan finally be met. From the perspective of reflective persons of\nfaith (or would-be faith), the question of entitlement\narises: are they rationally, epistemically—even,\nmorally—entitled to adopt or continue in their faith? This\nquestion will be existentially important, since faith will not count\nas of the kind exemplified by religious faith unless its commitments\nmake a significant difference to how one lives one’s life. Reflective\nbelievers who are aware of the many options for faith, and the\npossibility of misguided and even harmful faith-commitments, will wish\nto be satisfied that they are justified in their faith. The\ntheist traditions hold a deep fear of idolatry—of giving one’s\n‘ultimate concern’ (Tillich 1957/2001) to an object\nunworthy of it. The desire to be assured of entitlement to faith is\nthus not merely externally imposed by commitment to philosophical\ncritical values: it is a demand internal to the integrity of theistic\nfaith itself. Arguably, believers must even take seriously the\npossibility that the God they have been worshipping is not, after all,\nthe true God (Johnston 2009). But, for this concern to be met, there\nwill need to be conditions sufficient for justified faith that are\n‘internalist’—that is, conditions whose obtaining\nis, at least indirectly if not directly, accessible to believers\nthemselves. Those conditions are widely assumed to include an\nevidentialist requirement that faith is justified only if the truth of\nits cognitive content is adequately supported by the available\nevidence. \nThe ‘knowledge’ model as leaving the question of\nentitlement unanswered \nIt may be argued, however, that, if the ‘special\nknowledge’ model is correct, those who seek to meet an\nevidentialist requirement will be unable to satisfy themselves of\ntheir entitlement to their faith. Theistic truths may be directly\nrevealed, and experienced as immediately evident, yet, on reflection,\none may doubt whether such experiences are genuinely revelatory since\ncompeting ‘naturalist’ interpretations of those\nexperiences seem available. It may be true, as Plantinga’s Reformed\nepistemology maintains, that if God exists such experiences\nmeet externalist criteria for conveying knowledge, even though the\ntruth of the beliefs concerned remains open to reflective\n‘internalist’ doubt. On an externalist account, that is,\none might lack independent evidence sufficient to confirm that one has\nknowledge that God exists while in fact possessing that very\nknowledge. And one might thus refute an objector who claims that\nwithout adequate evidence one cannot genuinely know. But this\nconsideration is still insufficient to secure entitlement to theistic\nfaith—if, as may be argued, that entitlement requires that\none has evidence adequate to justify commitment to the truth\nthat God exists. For, one has such evidence only conditionally on\nGod’s existence—but it is precisely entitlement to believe\nthat God exists that is at issue (Kenny 1992, 71; Bishop and Aijaz\n2004). For a wider discussion of the possibility of religious\nknowledge that, inter alia, endorses the present point, see\nZagzebski 2010. \nIf faith is not ‘a firm and certain knowledge’ of\ntheistic truths, then a model of faith as having a propositional\nobject may be retained by identifying faith with a certain kind of\nbelief. The relevant kind will be belief with theological\ncontent—that God exists, is benevolent towards us, has a plan of\nsalvation, etc.—where this belief is also held with sufficient\nfirmness and conviction. Richard Swinburne labels this the\n‘Thomist view’ of faith, and expresses it thus: ‘The\nperson of religious faith is the person who has the theoretical\nconviction that there is a God.’ (Swinburne 2005, 138).\n(Aquinas’s own understanding of faith is more complex than this\nformulation suggests, however, as will be noted shortly.) \nThe rationality of faith on this model will rest on the rationality of\nthe firmly held theological beliefs in which it consists. As Swinburne\nnotes, if such beliefs are founded on evidence that renders their\ntruth sufficiently more probable than not, then the beliefs concerned\nmay amount to knowledge on a contemporary ‘justified true\nbelief’ fallibilist epistemology, even though they fall short of\nknowledge on Aquinas’s own criteria, which require that what is known\nbe ‘seen’ (i.e., fully and directly comprehended)\n(Summa Theologiae 2a2ae 1, 4 & 5 (O’Brien 1974, 27)). In\nany case, the reasonableness of faith on this model of faith as belief\ndepends on the beliefs concerned being adequately evidentially\njustified. \nSome argue that the truth of theism is ‘evidentially\nambiguous’—that is, that our total available evidence is\nequally viably interpreted from both a theist and a naturalist/atheist\nperspective (Hick 1966 and 1989; Davis 1978; Penelhum 1995; McKim\n2001). This thesis of evidential ambiguity may be supported as the\nbest explanation of the diversity of belief on religious matters,\nand/or of the persistence of the debate about theism, with\nphilosophers of equal acumen and integrity engaged on either side. Or\nthe ambiguity may be considered systematic—for example, on the\ngrounds that both natural theological and natural atheological\narguments fail because they are deeply circular, resting on implicit\nassumptions acceptable only to those already thinking within the\nrelevant perspective. (In relation to Swinburne’s Bayesian natural\ntheology, in particular, this objection surfaces in criticism of\nassumptions about how to set the prior probabilities implicated in\ncalculations of, for example, theism’s probability on the evidence of\nthe ‘fine-tuning’ of the Universe’s basic physical\nconstants, or of the probability, on all our evidence, of the truth of\nthe Resurrection.) If the ambiguity thesis is correct,\nthen—assuming evidentialism—firmly held theistic belief\nwill fail to be reasonable. \nOn this model of faith as belief, all that characterises faith apart\nfrom its theological content is the firmness or conviction with which\nfaith-propositions are held true. Firm belief in the truth of a\nscientific proposition, for example, fails to count as faith\nonly through lacking the right kind of content. This model\ntherefore shares with the ‘special knowledge’ model in\ntaking its theological content as essential to what makes theistic\nfaith faith, and so rejects the suggestion that faith of the\nsame sort as found in the theist religious traditions might also be\nfound elsewhere. \nFurthermore, in taking faith to consist in belief that theological\npropositions are true, this model invites the assumption that\ntheological convictions belong in the same category of factual claims\nas scientific theoretical hypotheses with which they accordingly\ncompete. That assumption will lead those who think that theological\nclaims are not reasonably accepted on the evidence to regard\nfaith as worthless and intellectually dishonourable—at best,\n‘a degenerating research programme’ (Lakatos 1970). (On\nthis negative assessment of faith’s evidential support, persons of\nfaith come perilously close to the schoolboy’s definition mentioned by\nWilliam James: ‘Faith is when you believe something that you\nknow ain’t true’ (James 1896/1956, 29). Or, if believers readily\nabandon theological explanations whenever competing scientific ones\nsucceed, their God gets reduced to ‘the God of the gaps’.)\nThese misgivings about the model of faith as firmly held factual\ntheological belief dissolve, of course, if success attends the project\nof showing that particular theological claims count as factual\nhypotheses well supported by the total available evidence. Those who\ndoubt that this condition is or can be met may, however, look towards\na model of faith that understands faith’s cognitive content as playing\nsome other role than that of an explanatory hypothesis of the same\nkind as a scientific explanatory hypothesis. \nAquinas’s account of faith \nThough firmly held theological belief is central to it, Aquinas’s\nunderstanding of faith is more complicated and nuanced than the view\nthat faith is ‘the theoretical conviction that God\nexists’. Aquinas holds that faith is ‘midway between\nknowledge and opinion’ (Summa Theologiae 2a2ae 1, 2\n(O’Brien 1974, 11)). Faith resembles knowledge, Aquinas thinks, in so\nfar as faith carries conviction. But that conviction is not well\ndescribed as ‘theoretical’, if that description suggests\nthat faith has a solely propositional object. For Aquinas,\nfaith denotes the believer’s fundamental orientation towards the\ndivine. So ‘from the perspective of the reality believed\nin’, Aquinas says, ‘the object of faith is something\nnon-composite’ (non-propositional)—namely God\nhimself. Nevertheless, grasping the truth of propositions is\nessential to faith, because ‘from the perspective of the one\nbelieving … the object of faith is something composite in\nthe form of a proposition’ (Summa Theologiae, 2a2ae, 1,\n2 (O’Brien 1974, 11 & 13), my emphases). \nA further problem with describing as Thomist a model of faith simply\nas firm belief in the truth of theological propositions is that\nAquinas takes as central an act of ‘inner assent’\n(Summa Theologiae, 2a2ae, 2, 1 (O’Brien 1974, 59–65)).\nThis is problematic because, (i) in its dominant contemporary\ntechnical usage belief is taken to be a mental (intentional)\nstate—a propositional attitude, namely, the attitude\ntowards the relevant proposition that it is true; (ii) belief in this\ncontemporary sense is widely agreed not to be under volitional\ncontrol—not directly, anyway; yet (iii) Aquinas holds that the\nassent given in faith is under the control of the will. Aquinas need\nnot, however, be construed as accepting ‘believing at\nwill’, provided we allow that inner assent may be an act without\nbeing an intentional action. Assent may be construed as something that\nhas to be elicited yet terminates a process that is subject to the\nwill—a process of inquiry, deliberation or pondering that does\ninvolve mental actions, or, in the case of faith, a process of divine\ngrace that can proceed only if it is not blocked by the will. \nMost importantly, however, Aquinas says that assent is given to the\npropositional articles of faith because their truth is revealed by\nGod, and on the authority of the putative source of this\nrevelation. Terence Penelhum puts it like this: ‘Thomas tells us\nthat although what one assents to in faith includes many items not\nostensibly about God himself, one assents to them, in faith, because\nthey are revealed by God … It is because they come from him and\nbecause they lead to him that the will disposes the intellect to\naccept them’ (Penelhum 1989, 122: see Summa Theologiae,\n2a2ae, 1, 1 & 2 (O’Brien 1974, 5–15)). So Aquinas’s model of\nfaith is of believing (assenting to) propositional truth-claims on\nthe basis of testimony carrying divine authority. John Locke\nfollows the same model: ‘Faith … is the assent to any\nproposition … upon the credit of the proposer, as coming from\nGod, in some extraordinary way of communication’ (Locke\n1698/1924, 355; compare also Alston 1996, 15). \nThe unanswered question of entitlement—again \nFaith as assent to truths on the basis of an authoritative source of\ndivine revelation is possible, though, only for those who already\nbelieve that God exists and is revealed through the relevant\nsources. Might such faith, then, have to rest on a prior\nfaith—faith that God exists and that this is his\nmessenger or vehicle of communication? Those foundational claims, it\nmight be maintained, are held true on the grounds of adequately\nsupporting evidence, such as putatively provided by arguments of\nnatural theology and the claimed evidence for miraculous endorsement\nof a prophet’s authority. Faith might then have a purely rational\nfoundation. But this could hardly be so for every person of\nfaith, since not everyone who believes will have access to the\nrelevant evidence or be able to assess it properly. Besides, and more\nimportantly, although Aquinas allows that rational assessment of the\navailable evidence may lead a person to faith, he does not think that\nsuch an assessment could ever elicit assent itself—only\ndemonstration could achieve that and so high a level of proof is not\nhere available (see O’Brien, 1974, footnote 2b, 58–9). Aquinas’s\nview is thus that all believers stand in need of God’s grace:\n‘the assent of faith, which is its principal act … has as\nits cause God, moving us inwardly through grace’ ((Summa\nTheologiae, 2a2ae 6, 1 (O’Brien 1974, 167)). It follows, then,\nthat, on Aquinas’s view, believing that God exists and is revealed in\nspecific ways is itself a matter of faith, and not a purely\nrationally evidentially secured prolegomenon to it. \nAquinas’s model of faith thus shares with the ‘special\nknowledge’ model the problem that it leaves unanswered the\nreflective believer’s concern about entitlement. Attempting to settle\nthat concern by meeting the evidential requirement leads to\ncircularity: believers are to accept theological truths on divine\nauthority, yet the truth that there is such an\nauthority (historically mediated as the relevant tradition\nmaintains) is amongst those very truths that are to be accepted on\ndivine authority—indeed, it is the crucial one. As Descartes\nputs it in the Dedication to his Meditations, ‘although\nit is absolutely true that we must believe there is a God, because we\nare so taught in the Holy Scriptures, and, on the other hand, that we\nmust believe the Holy Scriptures because they come from God …,\nwe nevertheless could not place this argument before infidels, who\nmight accuse us of reasoning in a circle’ (Haldane and Ross\n1967, 133). Thus, although they differ on the question whether the\nfirm beliefs of faith count as knowledge, both Aquinas and Calvin\nunderstand faith as essentially involving accepting the truth of\npropositions as revealed through willingly receiving God’s\ngracious gift of that very revelation. The question remains how\naccepting this gift could be epistemically rational. The externalist\naccount of how Christian beliefs may have epistemic worth proposed in\nPlantinga’s model of faith (named ‘the A/C’ model\nbecause its sources are supposedly found in Aquinas as well as Calvin)\noffers some help with the required explanation, but (as noted in the\nfinal paragraph of Section 4 above) may arguably not by itself be\nsufficient.  \nRevelation—and its philosophical critique \nThe justifiability of belief that God exists is a typically focal\nissue in the Philosophy of Religion. Yet the theist traditions always\nmake a foundational claim about an authoritative source, or sources,\nof revealed truth. What is salient is not just believing that God\nexists; it is believing that God exists and is revealed thus\nand so (in great historical acts, in prophets, in scriptures, in\nwisdom handed down, etc.). The reasonableness of theism is therefore\nas much a matter of the reasonableness of an epistemology of\nrevelation as it is of a metaphysics of perfect being. The question of\nhow God may be expected to make himself known has gained prominence\nthrough recent discussion of the argument for atheism from\n‘divine hiddenness’ (Schellenberg 1993; Howard-Snyder and\nMoser 2002). That argument holds that a loving God would make his\nexistence clear to the non-resistant—but this claim is open to\nquestion. Perhaps God provides only ‘secret’ evidence of\nhis existence, purposely overturning the expectations of our\n‘cognitive idolatry’ in order to transform our egocentric\nself-reliance (Moser 2008); besides, there may be significant\nconstraints logically inherent in the very possibility of unambiguous\ndivine revelation to finite minds (King 2008). \nSimilarly, accounts of theistic faith will be open to critique when\nthey make assumptions about the mechanisms of revelation. In\nparticular, the model of faith as assent to propositions as revealed\nholds that, since God’s grace is required for that assent, when grace\nis effective the whole ‘package deal’ of propositional\nrevealed truth is accepted. This yields the notion of\n‘the Faith’, as the body of theological truths to\nbe accepted by ‘the faithful’, and it becomes a sign of\nresistance to divine grace to ‘pick and choose’ only some\ntruths, as heretics do (Greek: hairesis, choice; see\nSumma Theologiae 2a2ae 5, 3 (O’Brien 1974, 157–61)).\nFor heresy to be judged, however, some human authority must assume it\npossesses the full doctrinal revelation, with God’s grace operating\nwithout resistance in its own case. Whether that assumption can ever\nbe sufficiently well founded to justify condemning and purging others\nis an important question, whose neglect may be seriously harmful, as\nwe are reminded by the fact that the phrase for ‘act of\nfaith’ in Portuguese—auto-da-fé—came\nto mean the public burning of a heretic. \nBut the deeper assumption made by this model of faith as belief (as,\ntoo, by the ‘special knowledge’ model) is that God’s\nself-revelation is primarily the revelation of the truth of\npropositions articulated in human language (compare Swinburne 1992).\nAlternative understandings of revelation are available, however. In\nparticular, it may be held that it is primarily the divine\npresence itself that is revealed—the reality, not merely a\nrepresentation of it. Propositional articulations of what is revealed\nmay still be essential, but they need to be accepted as at a remove\nfrom the object of revelation itself, and therefore as limited. The\ndevelopment of propositional articulations expressing the nature and\nwill of the self-revealing God—the doctrines of ‘the\nFaith’—will, of course, be understood as a process under\nprovidential grace. It is often assumed that that process can achieve\n‘closure’ in a completed set of infallibly known creedal\npropositions. But this assumption about how divine inspiration\noperates may be contested, both on the theological grounds that it\nreflects the all-too-human desire to gain control over God’s\nself-revelation (to ‘pin God down once and for all’), and\non the wider epistemological grounds that any attempt to grasp\nindependent reality in human language will be in principle fallible\nand subject to revision in the light of future experience. \nNot all models of faith however, identify it as primarily a matter of\nknowing or believing a proposition or a set of them. What is most\ncentral to theistic faith may seem better expressed as believing\nin God, rather than as believing that God exists.\nThe Christian creeds begin ‘Credo in unum Deum\n…’—and it is arguable that in this context\n‘belief in’ is neither merely an idiomatic variant on, nor\nreducible to, ‘belief that’ (Price 1965). It may thus be\nheld that theists’ acceptance of propositional truths as divinely\nrevealed rests on believing in God—and it is this\n‘believing in’, or ‘having faith in’, which\nis, fundamentally, the nature of faith. Noting that, while faith is\nheld to be a virtue, believing as such is not, Wilfred Cantwell Smith\nargues that ‘faith is not belief’, ‘but something of\na quite different order’ (Smith 1979, 128), requiring\n‘assent’ ‘in the dynamic and personal sense of\nrallying to [what one takes to be the truth] with delight and\nengagement’ (142). Our considerations now shift, then, from\n‘propositional’-attitude-focussed models of faith to\n‘operational’ models, to borrow terminology from\nJ.L.Schellenberg (2005, 126). \nWhat does ‘operational’ ‘faith in’\nGod amount to? What is it to believe in, or have faith in, God beyond,\nor even independently of, believing that God exists? To have faith in\nGod is to make a practical commitment—the kind involved\nin trusting God, or, trusting in God. (The root\nmeaning of the Greek pistis, ‘faith’, is\n‘trust’.) This, then, is a fiducial model\n—a model of faith as trust, understood not simply as an\naffective state of confidence, but as an action. On a\nfiducial model, faith’s active, practical, component takes central\nplace, though a cognitive component may be presupposed by it. The\nfiducial model is widely identified as characteristically Protestant.\nSwinburne, for example, calls it the ‘Lutheran’ model, and\ndefines it thus: ‘the person of faith does not merely believe\nthat there is a God (and believe certain propositions about\nhim)—he trusts Him and commits himself to Him’ (2005,\n142). Yet, as noted earlier, Aquinas too takes the ultimate object of\nfaith to be God, ‘the first reality’, and, furthermore,\nunderstands ‘formed’ faith as trusting commitment to God,\nmotivated by, and directed towards, love of God as one’s true end (see\nSumma Theologiae 2a2ae, 4, 3; O’Brien 1974, 123–7). It\nis true that Aquinas allows that the devils have faith in a certain\nsense—but this ‘faith’ amounts only to their belief\nthat what the Church teaches is the truth, arrived at not by grace but\n‘forced from them’ reluctantly by ‘the acumen of\ntheir natural intelligence’ (Summa Theologiae 2a2ae, 5,\n2; O’Brien 1974, 155 & 157). Aquinas’s account of\n‘saving’ faith is thus also a fiducial model. \nThe venture of trust \nAs noted at the outset, there is a usage of ‘faith’ for\nwhich ‘having/placing faith in’ is (near enough)\nsynonymous with ‘trusting’ or ‘trusting in’.\nIf, moreover, faith of the religious kind is itself a type of trust,\nthen we may expect our understanding of religious faith to profit from\nan analysis of trust in general. It is therefore worth considering\nwhat follows about the nature of faith of the sort exemplified in\ntheistic faith from holding it to be a kind of trust. \nConceptually fundamental to trust is the notion of a person (or\npersons)—the truster—trusting in some agent or\nagency—the trustee—for some (assumedly)\nfavourable outcome (though what the trustee is trusted for is often\nonly implicit in the context). Trust involves a venture; so\ntoo—it is widely agreed—does faith. So, if faith is trust,\nthe venture of faith might be presumed to be the type of venture\nimplicated in trust. A venture is an action that places the agent and\noutcomes of concern to the agent significantly beyond the agent’s own\ncontrol. Trust implies venture. When we trust we commit ourselves to\nanother’s control, accepting—and, when necessary, co-operating\nas ‘patient’—with the decisions of the trustee.\nVenturing in trust is usually assumed to be essentially\nrisky, making oneself vulnerable to adverse outcomes or betrayal.\n(Swinburne makes the point this way: ‘To trust someone is to act\non the assumption that she will do for you what she knows that you\nwant or need, when the evidence gives some reason for supposing that\nshe may not and where there will be bad consequences if the assumption\nis false’ (2005, 143). Annette Baier makes no requirement for\nevidence that the trustee may prove untrustworthy, but nevertheless\ntakes trust to involve ‘accepted vulnerability to another’s\npossible but not expected ill will (or lack of good will)\ntoward one’ (Baier 1986, 235, my emphasis).) Accordingly, it\nseems sensible to hold that one should trust only with good reason.\nBut if, as is plausible, good reason to trust requires sufficient\nevidence of the trustee’s trustworthiness, reasonable trust appears\nboth to have its venturesomeness diminished and, at the same time, to\nbecome more difficult to achieve than we normally suppose. For we\noften lack adequate—or even, any—evidence of a trustee’s\ntrustworthiness in advance of our venture, yet in many such cases we\nsuppose that our trust is reasonable. But, if adequate evidence of\ntrustworthiness is not required for reasonable trust, how is\nreasonable trust different from ‘blind’ trust? \nThis problem might be avoided by arguing that the question of when one\nmay rationally trust another may be resolved by a decision theoretic\ncalculation, factoring in the extent to which one’s evidence supports\nthe potential trustee’s trustworthiness and the utilities or\ndisutilities of the possible outcomes. It may thus on occasion be\npractically rational to trust a person whose likelihood of\ntrustworthiness is low, if a sufficiently valuable outcome may be\nachieved only by so doing. (An unlikely rescuer may rationally be\ntrusted if the only one available.) But this approach misses something\nimportant in social intercourse, where we generally count it a virtue\nto be ready to trust others without such prior calculation. Such\nopenness may still be broadly rational, however, given our\nlong shared experience that willingness to trust others usually does\nelicit trustworthy behaviour: accordingly, though I may have little or\nno direct evidence that this particular fellow citizen of\nmine will prove trustworthy if I turn to her in a sudden predicament,\nI may have good evidence for the general reliability of\nothers in my community. \nNevertheless, it can sometimes be reasonable to act decisively on the\nassumption that people will be worthy of trust in quite particular\nrespects without having evidence for their trustworthiness sufficient\nto justify such decisiveness (see, for example, Adams 1987). And this\nseems to be because, in such cases, (i) what has to be decided is\nall or nothing—whether to trust or\nnot—so that tentatively committing oneself in practice to\nthe trustworthiness of the trustee only to the partial degree\nsupported by one’s evidence is not a separate option; and (ii) at the\npoint where the decision has to be made it is impossible that\nthere should be evidence that justifies more than modest partial\nbelief—impossible that evidence should justify decisive\ncommitment to the trustee’s trustworthiness. Such cases provide a\nparticularly interesting class of exceptions to the general\nevidentialist requirement to commit in practice to the truth of a\nproposition only as justified by one’s evidence. They are interesting\nbecause they do not involve non-epistemic considerations overriding\nepistemic ones, as is the case with some readily recognisable types of\nexception to trust-evidentialism—for example, cases where being\nin an established relationship with someone obliges one to trust\ncontrary to the weight of one’s evidence; or cases of\n‘educative’ or ‘therapeutic’ trust, where\nothers are trusted in order to develop or restore their\ntrustworthiness. In the target cases, the epistemic concern to grasp\ntruth and avoid falsehood is not overridden: they are cases\nwhere one may benefit from acting on the truth that a person is\ntrustworthy only if one first commits oneself to the person’s\ntrustworthiness beyond the possible support of\nevidence—though once the venture is made conclusive evidence of\ntrustworthiness may happily soon accumulate. \nOn a model that takes religious faith to consist fundamentally in an\nact of trust, the analogy with the venture of interpersonal trust is\nsuggestive. When one person trusts another there seems typically to be\nboth a doxastic and a fiducial aspect—there is the\nperson’s belief as to the other’s trustworthiness and also\nan active commitment or ‘entrusting’ to the other. Paul\nHelm proposes that religious faith similarly has importantly distinct\ndoxastic and fiducial aspects: in addition to belief about God’s\nexistence and trustworthiness for salvation held with a degree of\nstrength proportional to the believer’s evidence, persons of\nfaith must also entrust themselves to the one on whom they rely (Helm\n2000). \nYet there are also significant differences between the trusting\ninvolved in theistic faith and that involved in interpersonal trust.\nFor one thing, venturing in trust would seem not to carry real risk if\nGod really is the trustee. ‘A mother’s tender care’\nmay cease ‘toward the child she bare’:\nshe may be forgetful, ‘yet will I remember\nthee, for mine is an unchanging love’, as the William Cowper\nhymn has the Lord declare (see Isaiah 49:15). Given the existence of\nthe God of unchanging love, one trusts in ultimately perfect safety.\nBut the venture of actually entrusting oneself to God seems to begin\nwith the challenge of being able to accept that, indeed, there is such\na God. While some affirm that many people have sufficient evidence to\njustify this claim, others, as already noted, hold that everyone has\nto confront the evidential ambiguity of foundational theistic claims.\nFor those who think that God’s existence as the one who saves\ncannot be settled intellectually on the basis of the available\nevidence, the venture involved in trusting in God (if such there be)\nmay seem to include a doxastic venture: the one who trusts\nalready ventures, somehow beyond or independently of the available\nevidence, in his or her very believing that God exists and\nmay be relied on for salvation. Trusting in God seems to\npresuppose, in other words, taking it on trust that God\nexists. But, if so, the question whether, and under what conditions,\none may be entitled to such an evidence-transcending venture becomes\npressing. \nTheological non-realism \nOne way to relieve this pressure is to offer a non-realist\nanalysis of theological claims. Trusting God will then not entail any\ncommitment to reality’s being a certain way. Rather, on\narguably the most sophisticated kind of non-realist view, theological\nbeliefs arise because living ‘trustingly’ comes to be\nexpressed and reinforced through a culturally constructed fiction\nabout God and his great saving acts. This existential confidence may\nthen be described, using the language of the fiction, as\n‘trusting God’ (Cupitt 1980, Geering 1994). On such a\nnon-realist account, the model of faith as trust brackets the\ncognitive component of faith, and risks becoming, in effect, a model\nof faith as purely a certain kind of affective state. But, in any\ncase, non-realist models will be rejected by those who take faith to\nhave a cognitive component that functions as a grasping—or\nwould-be grasping—of how things really are. \nDefending doxastic venture by analogy with interpersonal\ntrust? \nEven if faith does involve (under realist assumptions) a venture in\nbelief itself, the justifiability of such a venture might yet be\nthought defensible by analogy with interpersonal situations where it\nis justifiable decisively to trust another beyond one’s evidence.\nReflecting on that proposal discloses further points of disanalogy,\nhowever. In cases of interpersonal trust a venture is often needed in\ninitially taking the trustee to be trustworthy, but evidence\nwill inevitably later emerge which will either confirm or disconfirm\nthe truth of that claim—and trust may, and rationally should, be\nwithdrawn if the news is bad. Furthermore, interpersonal trust does\nnot require actually believing that the trustee is worthy of\ntrust, only that one decisively takes this to be true (i.e., acts on\nthe assumption of its truth) when one comes to act. People of theistic\nfaith, however, typically do believe that God exists and may\nbe trusted for salvation, and, if—as we are here\nassuming—acting on this belief ventures beyond evidential\nsupport, then it is a venture that persists and is not confined to\ninitial commitment only. Psychologically, no doubt, continuing to\njourney in theistic faith may reinforce one’s commitment. These\nreinforcing experiences, which often involve faith renewed in the face\nof apparent failures of divine love, do not, however, possess\nthe uncontroversial status of evidence that independently and\ninter-subjectively confirms the initial venture. \nDoxastic venture without doxastic voluntarism \nMany dismiss the idea that one may venture in one’s very believing\nthat God exists as committing a category error: ventures are\nvoluntary, but propositional belief is not directly under voluntary\ncontrol. Trusting God, however, entails practical commitment to\nthe truth of theological faith-propositions—and commitment\nto the truth of a proposition in one’s practical reasoning may\nbe under direct voluntary control. \nIt is one thing to be in the mental state of holding that the\nproposition that p is true; it is another to take it to be true\nthat p in one’s practical reasoning (although these typically\ngo together, since to hold that p is true is to be\ndisposed to take it to be true that p in practical\nreasoning whenever the question whether p becomes salient).\nPractical commitment to a faith-proposition’s truth therefore\ncould be a venture: there is no category error in allowing\nthis possibility. Doxastic venturing —venturing in\nbelieving— is thus not a matter of willing oneself to believe\nwithout adequate evidential support; rather it is a matter of taking\nan already held belief to be true in one’s practical\nreasoning even though (as one may oneself recognise) its truth lacks\nsuch support. \nThe psychological possibility of doxastic venture \nSome philosophers have argued, however, that one cannot (in full\nreflective awareness, anyway) believe that p while accepting\nthat one has insufficient evidence for p’s truth (Adler 2002).\nThe counterclaim that this is possible is defended by William James,\nin his controversial 1896 lecture, ‘The Will to Believe’\n(James 1896/1956). James agrees that belief cannot be directly willed\nand must be otherwise causally evoked (he later came to wish that he\nhas used ‘The Right to Believe’ as his lecture’s title).\nJames observes, however, that many beliefs have causes that do not\nconstitute or imply an evidential grounding of their truth. James\nlabels such causes ‘passional’—again, a potentially\nmisleading term, since its intended referents include much more than\nemotional causes of belief. In particular, beliefs may be caused by\n‘the circumpressure of one’s caste or set’, of which one’s\ninherited religious tradition is a paradigm case (James 1896/1956, 9).\nJames is thus able to explain the psychological possibility of\ndoxastic venture: one already has a ‘passionally’ caused\nbelief, which one then takes to be true in practical reasoning despite\nits lack of adequate evidential grounding (compare Creel 1994, who\nsimilarly describes ‘faith’ as a ‘non-evidential\ndoxastic passion’). \nNote that a doxastic venture model of theistic faith reconciles faith\nas gift with faith’s active components: the action is taking a\nfaith-proposition to be true in practical reasoning; the gift provides\nthe motivational resources for so doing, namely a firm belief in the\ntruth of the faith-proposition, despite its lack of adequate\nevidential support. (In the next section, the possibility is\nconsidered that the gift of these motivational resources might not\namount to actual belief.) It is also worth noting that those who find\nthe focus on the individual something of a deficiency in analytical\naccounts of faith (Eklund 2015) may perceive in James’s account\nsome acknowledgment of the social aspect of faith. Arguably, the\nstandard ‘passional’ or ‘non-evidential’ cause\nof religious belief is cultural immersion within an historical\nfaith-tradition. The motivational resources for faith-commitment may\nthus be an essentially social possession. \nExamples of doxastic venture models \nOn the doxastic venture model, faith involves full practical\ncommitment to a faith’s proposition’s truth, despite the recognition\nthat this is not ‘objectively’ justified on the evidence.\nKierkegaard’s Concluding Unscientific Postcript definition of\nfaith as ‘an objective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation\nprocess of the most passionate inwardness’ (Kierkegaard\n1846/1968, 180) is an example of a doxastic venture model. So too is\nPaul Tillich’s account of faith as ‘the state of being\nultimately concerned’, since the claim of the object of one’s\nultimate concern to ‘promise total fulfilment even if all other\nclaims have to be subjected to it or rejected in its name’\ncannot in principle be established on the basis of the evidence.\n(Tillich, 1957/2001, 1 and 21). \nAquinas’s model of faith, though widely thought of as conforming to an\nevidential requirement on belief, may arguably be open to\ninterpretation as a doxastic venture model. As noted in Section 5,\nAquinas holds that the available evidence, though it supports the\ntruth of foundational faith-propositions, does not provide what\nAquinas counts as sufficient (i.e., demonstrative) support to justify\ninner assent (in addition to references to the Summa\nTheologiae given previously, see 2a2ae. 2, 1 (O’Brien 1974, 63);\nand compare also Penelhum 1989, 120). Now, whether practical\ncommitment to the truth of a given faith-proposition does or does not\nventure beyond adequate evidential support will be relative to\nassumptions about (a) where the level of evidential support required\nfor ‘adequacy’ should be set, and (b) just how firm and\ndecisive propositional faith-commitment needs to be. On some such\nassumptions, for example those made by Bayesians, the support provided\nby the evidence Aquinas adduces—or, by a suitable contemporary\nupgrading of that evidence, such as that provided in the works of\nRichard Swinburne—may be considered enough to make reasonable a\nsufficiently high degree of belief (or credence) in the truth of\ntheistic faith-propositions so that believers need not venture beyond\nthe support of their evidence. Interpreting Aquinas’s model of faith\nas conforming to evidentialism may thus be viable. Nevertheless,\nAquinas’s own assumptions on these matters may leave him closer to\nKierkegaard and Tillich than is commonly thought (consider Summa\nTheologiae 2a2ae 4, 1 and, once again, 2a2ae 6, 1 (O’Brien 1974,\n117–9 & 167)). \nThe special role of faith-propositions \nBayesians might argue that there is no occasion for faith as doxastic\nventure since, once practical commitment to the truth of propositions\nis recognised as a matter of degree, whatever the state of the\navailable evidence relating to a given proposition, there will always\n(given initial credences) be a rational credence properly associated\nwith that evidence, and hence there are no possible circumstances\nwhere ‘the evidence does not decide’. Note, however, Lara\nBuchak’s (2012) discussion of ways in which Bayesians might\nunderstand faith as going beyond the evidence, and her own proposal\nthat faith-ventures essentially include an additional\npractical commitment, which may be rational under certain conditions,\nnot to inquire further into evidence relevant to the truth of the\npropositions concerned. \nIf the domain of faith is, as Stephen Evans puts it, ‘the\nassumptions, convictions and attitudes which the believer brings\nto the evidence for and against religious truth’ (Evans\n1985, 178), and faith’s cognitive component offers a ‘total\ninterpretation’ of the world of our experience (Hick 1966, 154),\nthen (foundational) faith-propositions function as\n‘highest-order framing principles’ which\nnecessarily cannot have their truth settled by appeal to the\nforce of a body of independent evidence (Bishop 2007a, 139–44).\nTaking such a faith-proposition to be true, then, is not something\nthat comes in degrees: either one ‘buys into’ the overall\nworldview a (foundational) faith-proposition proposes, or one does\nnot. Such a choice is existentially important, and settling it raises\nanxiety about exercising a responsibility that cannot—without\n‘bad faith’—be transferred onto the relatively\nimpersonal function of one’s reason, since a venture beyond any\nrational certification is required. The doxastic venture model may\nthus be regarded as capturing the spiritual challenge of faith more\nsatisfactorily than do models that understand faith as conforming to\nevidentialism. This is because, on the doxastic venture model, faith\ninvolves a deeper surrender of self-reliant control, not only in\ntrusting God, but in accepting at the level of practical commitment\nthat there is a God—indeed, this God—who is to be\ntrusted. \nDoxastic venture models of faith and epistemic concern \nDoxastic venture in relation to faith-propositions can be justifiable,\nof course, only if there are legitimate exceptions to the\nevidentialist requirement to take a proposition to be true just to the\nextent of its evidential support—and only if the legitimate\nexceptions include the kind of case involved in religious, theistic,\nfaith-commitment. \nA possible view of theistic faith-commitment is that it is wholly\nindependent of the epistemic concern that cares about evidential\nsupport. On this view, faith reveals its authenticity most clearly\nwhen it takes faith-propositions to be true contrary to the\nweight of the evidence. This view is widely described as\n‘fideist’, but ought more fairly to be called\narational fideism, or, where commitment contrary to the\nevidence is positively favoured, irrational or\ncounter-rational fideism. Despite its popular attribution\nboth to the church father Tertullian and to ‘the father of\nexistentialism’, Kierkegaard, counter-rational fideism does not\nseem to have been espoused by any significant theist philosophers\n(passages in Tertullian and Kierkegaard that appear to endorse this\nposition may be interpreted as emphasising that Christian faith\nrequires accepting, not logical contradiction, but\n‘contradiction’ of our ‘natural’ expectations,\nwholly overturned in the revelation that the power of divine love is\ntriumphant in the Crucified One). \nSerious philosophical defence of a doxastic venture model of faith\nthus implies a supra-rational fideism, for which epistemic\nconcern is not overridden and for which, therefore, it is a constraint\non faith-commitment that it not accept what is known, or\njustifiably believed on the evidence, to be false. Rather, faith\ncommits itself only beyond, and not against, the\nevidence—and it does so out of epistemic concern to\ngrasp truth on matters of vital existential importance. The thought\nthat one may be entitled to commit to an existentially momentous\ntruth-claim in principle undecidable on the evidence when forced to\ndecide either to do so or not is what motivates William James’s\n‘justification of faith’ in ‘The Will to\nBelieve’ (James 1896/1956). If such faith is to be justified,\nits cognitive content will (on realist assumptions) have to cohere\nwith our best evidence-based theories about the real world. Faith may\nextend our scientific grasp of the real, but may not counter it.\nWhether the desire to grasp more truth about the real than science can\nsupply is a noble aspiration or a dangerous delusion is at the heart\nof the debate about entitlement to faith on this supra-rational\nfideist doxastic venture model. \nA discussion of the debate between the moderate, Jamesian,\nsupra-rational fideist and the evidentialist is beyond this entry’s\nscope. Still, it is worth remarking that those who think that faith\nunderstood as doxastic venture may be justified face the challenge of\nproviding the tools for weeding out intuitively distorted and\nunjustifiable forms of faith. On the other side, those evidentialists\nwho reject doxastic venture as impermissible have to consider whether\ntaking a stance on the nature of reality beyond anything science can\neven in principle confirm may not, in the end, be unavoidable, and\npotentially implicated in the commitments required for science itself\n(see Bishop 2007a, Chapters 8 and 9). For a useful recent collection\nof articles on the wider theme of the relation of religious faith to\nintellectual virtue, see Callahan and O’Connor 2014. \nSome accounts allow that faith centrally involves practical commitment\nventuring beyond evidential support, yet do not require (or, even,\npermit) that the venturer actually believes the\nfaith-proposition assumed to be true. Such accounts may be described\nas proposing a ‘sub-’ or ‘non-doxastic\nventure’ model of faith. F.R.Tennant holds a view of this kind:\nhe takes faith to be the adoption of a line of conduct not warranted\nby present facts, that involves experimenting with the possible or\nideal, venturing into the unknown and taking the risk of\ndisappointment and defeat. Faith is not an attempt to will something\ninto existence but rather treating hoped for and unseen things as\nif they were real and then acting accordingly (Tennant 1943/1989\np.104). Swinburne refers to this as the ‘pragmatist’ model\nof faith (Swinburne 2005, 147–8; Swinburne 2001, 211; compare\nalso Golding 1990, 2003). \nWilliam Alston (1996) suggests that faith may involve an active\n‘acceptance’ rather than purely receptive belief. A\nclearly sub-doxastic venture model results if acceptance is understood\non Jonathan Cohen’s account under which to accept that p\nis ‘to have or adopt a policy of deeming, positing, or\npostulating that p—i.e. of including that proposition\n… among one’s premisses for deciding what to do or think in a\nparticular context, whether or not one feels it to be true that\np’ (Cohen 1992, 4, my emphasis). The firmness of\nfaith-commitment is then just the firmness of one’s\n‘resolve to use [faith-claims] as a basis for one’s\nthought, attitude and behaviour’ (Alston 1996, 17): there is no\nfirm assurance of their truth. Decisive commitment in the\nabsence of such assurance may nevertheless be possible, motivated (as\nSwinburne suggested in the first edition of his Faith and\nReason) by the evaluative belief that ‘unless\n[faith-propositions are true], that which is most worthwhile is not to\nbe had’ (Swinburne, 1981, 117). (A faith venture that lacks\nbelief in the faith-proposition to which commitment is made need not,\nand probably could not, lack doxastic components altogether, as this\nsuggestion of Swinburne’s indicates.) \nAndrei Buckareff (2005) and J.L.Schellenberg (2005, 138-9) propose\nnon-doxastic venture models of propositional faith, with Schellenberg\nemphasising the positive evaluation that persons of faith make of the\ntruth-claim to which they commit themselves. In response to Daniel\nHoward-Snyder (2013) Schellenberg allows that faith may in some\ninstances involve belief while still maintaining that\n‘non-doxastic religious faith … will turn out to be a\nparticularly important way of having religious faith as we head into\nthe future’ (2013, 262). Bishop (2005), in response to\nBuckareff, also agrees that authentic faith need not always be a\nspecifically doxastic venture. There may, then, be an emerging\nconsensus amongst proponents of venture models that faith, at its\ncore, consists in suitably motivated persistent practical commitment\n‘beyond the evidence’ to the positively evaluated truth of\nfoundational faith-claims which may, but need not, actually be\nbelieved to be true. \nRobert Audi (2011) has also defended a non-doxastic account of faith,\ncontrasting ‘fiducial faith’ and ‘doxastic\nfaith’, and arguing that authentic religious faith need only\namount to the former. Audi’s account is not strictly a\n‘venture’ model, however, since he does not take\ncommitment beyond the support of adequate evidence to be essential.\nAudi’s account suggests that religious faith is sui\ngeneris, but capable of being understood through its relations\nwith other psychological states and actions, such as beliefs,\nevaluations and practical commitments. Rational assessment of\nreligious faith, Audi thinks, must avoid treating it as implying\nbelief, while recognising that greater confidence attaches to it than\nto religious hope. For another version of a non-doxastic account of\nfaith, as a person’s ‘affective orientation or\nstance’, see Jonathan Kvanvig (2013). \nSome philosophers have suggested that the epistemological challenges\nfaced by accounts of faith as involving belief beyond the evidence may\nbe avoided by construing theist commitment as hope. Theist hope seems\nnot to be mere tenacity (‘clinging to one’s hopes’)\n(Taylor 1961), but a more complex attitude. James Muyskens suggests,\nfor example, that one who hopes ‘keep[s] his life open or fluid\nwith respect to [a faith-proposition] p—where (a) neither\np nor not-p is certain for him, (b) he wants p\nand (c) he sees p as constructively connected with his own\nwell-being and/or concept of himself as a person’ (1979, 35).\nMuyskens contrasts hope with faith (understood as belief), arguing\nthat a religion of hope is both epistemically and religiously superior\nto a religion of faith. But faith is not generally understood as\ncompeting with hope (Creel 1993), and some philosophers\nidentify faith with hoping that the claims of faith are true\n(Pojman 1986; 2003). Hope as such is an attitude rather than an active\ncommitment, and, as Audi observes, it contrasts with the attitude of\nfaith at least in this respect, namely, that surprise makes little\nsense as a response to discovering that the object of one’s\nfaith is indeed the case, whereas there need be nothing inappropriate\nin surprise at the fulfilment of one’s hopes (see Audi 2011,\n74). \nA more adequate model of faith as hope, then, may rather take faith to\nbe acting in, or from, hope. Such a model then comes close to\na sub-doxastic venture model of faith, differing only in so far as\nacting from hope that God exists differs from taking this claim to be\ntrue (albeit without belief) in one’s practical reasoning—but\nthis difference may be undetectable at the level of behavioural\noutcomes. A model of faith as acting in hope also shares with the\ndoxastic and sub-doxastic venture models in leaving out the affective\ncertitude that is widely thought to characterise faith (Tennant\n1943/1989, 112). \nAll these three models, then —doxastic venture, sub-doxastic\nventure and venture in hope— fit the view that faith is\nconsistent with doubt, and, indeed, impossible without doubt of some\nkind, though they allow that persons of faith may give firm and\nsustained commitment to the truth of faith-propositions in practice.\nThe ‘certainty’ of faith on these models seems more a\nmatter of the certainty that persons of faith find themselves\nconferring on the foundational claims of their faith, rather\nthan a matter of discovering in themselves a certain knowledge or\nintellectual conviction of the truth of these claims. It is possible,\nthen, on these accounts of faith, to be a committed person of faith\nand also an ‘agnostic’ in Thomas Huxley’s original\nsense of someone who does not claim as knowledge what he or she\nnevertheless commits to as a foundational practical orientation to\nreality. \nFaith is traditionally regarded as one of the\n‘theological’ virtues. If a virtue is a ‘disposition\nof character which instantiates or promotes responsiveness to one or\nmore basic goods’, then theistic faith qualifies since it is\n‘a responsiveness to practical hope and truth’, provided\ntheistic faith-claims are indeed true (Chappell 1996, 27). Faith will\nnot, however, be a virtue as such, if it is accepted that\nfaith can be misplaced or, even, ‘demonic’, directed upon\na ‘false ultimate’ (Tillich 1957/2001, 21). To be\nvirtuous, faith must be faith in a worthy object: it is faith in\nGod that is the theological virtue. More generally, faith is\nvirtuous only when it is faith to which one is entitled. An account of\nthe conditions under which faith is permissible is thus the key to an\nethics of faith. \nOn models of faith as a (special) kind of knowledge, or as firmly held\nbelief, it may seem puzzling how faith could be a virtue—unless\nsome implicit practical component emerges when such models are further\nexplicated, or, alternatively, a case may be made for the claim that\nwhat is involuntary may nevertheless be praiseworthy, with theistic\nfaith as a case in point (Adams 1987). Furthermore, as already\nsuggested (Sections 4 & 5 above), models of faith as knowledge or\nbelief fail to provide non-circular conditions sufficient for\nentitlement, unless the truth of faith-propositions is established by\nindependent argument and evidence. Fiducial models of faith seem more\nattuned to exhibiting faith as a virtue, though a defence of the\ntrustworthiness of the one who is trusted for salvation may be\nrequired. Doxastic (and sub-doxastic) venture models of faith can\nvindicate faith as a virtue, provided they provide robust entitlement\nconditions, to ensure that not just any ‘leap of faith’ is\npermissible. The Jamesian account already mentioned (Section 7) aims\nto meet this need. James’s own view of what suffices to justify a\nfaith-venture arguably needs an ethical supplement: both the\nnon-evidential motivation for the venture and its content must be\nmorally acceptable (Bishop 2007a, 163–6). \nIf faith of the religious kind is to count as virtuous, it seems there\nmust be a suitable degree of persistence and steadfastness in the\ncommitment made. Persons of religious faith are faithful to the object\nof their commitment, though the salient kind of faithfulness may be a\nmatter of the continual renewal of faith rather than of maintaining it\nunchanged. (See Audi 2014 for a discussion of faith and faithfulness\nin relation to virtue. Audi defends faithfulness as, like courage, an\n‘adjunctive’ virtue, and argues that being ‘a person\nof faith’ counts as a ‘virtue of personality’.) \nFaith is only one of the Christian theological virtues, of course, the\nothers being hope and charity (or love, agape): and St Paul\nfamously affirms that the greatest of these is love (I Cor. 13:13).\nThe question thus arises how these three virtues are related. One\nsuggestion is that faith is taking it to be true that there are\ngrounds for the hope that love is supreme—not simply in the\nsense that love constitutes the ideal of the supreme good, but in the\nsense that living in accordance with this ideal constitutes an\nultimate salvation, fulfilment or consummation that is, in reality,\nvictorious over all that may undermine it (in a word, over evil). The\nsupremacy of love is linked to the supremacy of the divine itself,\nsince love is the essential nature of the divine. What is hoped for,\nand what faith assures us is properly hoped for, is a sharing\nin the divine itself, loving as God loves (see Brian Davies on\nAquinas, 2002). On this understanding, reducing faith to a kind of\nhope (Section 9 above) would eradicate an important relation between\nthe two—namely that people of faith take reality to be such that\ntheir hope (for salvation, the triumph of the good) is well founded,\nand not merely an attractive fantasy or inspiring ideal. \nWhat is the potential scope of faith? On some models, the kind of\nfaith exemplified by theistic faith is found only there. On both the\n‘special knowledge’ and the ‘belief’ models,\nfaith is intrinsically linked to theological content—indeed to\northodox Christian theological content, specifiable as one\nunified set of doctrines conveyed to receptive human minds by the\noperation of divine grace. Both the doxastic and sub-doxastic venture\nmodels, however, allow for the possibility that authentic faith may be\nvariously realised, and be directed upon different, and mutually\nincompatible, intentional objects. This pluralism is an important\nfeature of accounts of faith in the American pragmatist tradition.\nJohn Dewey strongly rejected the notion of faith as a special kind of\nknowledge (Dewey 1934, 20), as did William James, whose\n‘justification of faith’ rests on a\npermissibility thesis, under which varied and conflicting\nfaith-commitments may equally have a place in the ‘intellectual\nrepublic’ (James 1896/1956, 30). \nBoth Dewey and James defend models of faith with a view to advancing\nthe idea that authentic religious faith may be found outside what is\ngenerally supposed to be theological orthodoxy. Furthermore, they\nsuggest that ‘un-orthodox’ faith may be more\nauthentic than ‘orthodox’ faith. ‘The faith that is\nreligious’, says Dewey, ‘[I should describe as] the\nunification of the self through allegiance to inclusive ideal ends,\nwhich imagination presents to us and to which the human will responds\nas worthy of controlling our desires and choices’ (1934, 33).\nAnd James: ‘Religion says essentially two things: First, she\nsays that the best things are the more eternal things, the overlapping\nthings, the things in the universe that throw the last stone, so to\nspeak, and say the final word…. [and] the second affirmation of\nreligion is that we are better off now if we believe her first\naffirmation to be true’ (James 1896/1956, 25–6). While\nsome of what Dewey and James say about justifiable faith may appear\nnon-realist, in fact they both preserve the idea that religious faith\naspires to grasp, beyond the evidence, vital truth about reality.\nDewey holds that religious belief grounds hope because it takes\nsomething to be true about the real world ‘which carr[ies] one\nthrough periods of darkness and despair to such an extent that they\nlose their usual depressive character’ (1934, 14–5). \nA general—i.e., non-theologically specific—account of the\nreligious kind of faith may have potential as a tool for criticising\nphilosophical formulations of the specific content of religious faith.\nThe conditions for permissible faith-venture may exclude\nfaith in God under certain inadequate conceptions of who or what God\nis. Arguably, the ‘personal omniGod’ of much contemporary\nphilosophy of religion is just such an inadequate conception (Bishop\n2007b). An understanding of what faith is, then, may motivate radical\nexplorations into the concept of God as held in the theistic\ntraditions (Bishop 1998; Johnston 2009; Bishop and Perszyk 2014). \nCan there be faith without adherence to any theistic tradition? Those\nwho agree with F.R.Tennant that ‘faith is an outcome of the\ninborn propensity to self-conservation and self-betterment which is a\npart of human nature, and is no more a miraculously superadded\nendowment than is sensation or understanding’ (1943/1989, 111)\nwill consider that this must be a possibility. Tennant himself\nsuggests that ‘much of the belief which underlies\nknowledge’—and he has scientific knowledge in mind—\n‘is the outcome of faith which ventures beyond the apprehension\nand treatment of data to supposition, imagination and creation of\nideal objects, and justifies its audacity and irrationality (in\naccounting them to be also real) by practical actualization’\n(1943/1989, 100). Faith in this sense, however, may not seem quite on\na par with faith of the religious kind. True, scientists must act\nas if their ‘ideal objects’ are real in putting\ntheir theories to the empirical test; but they will ‘account\nthem to be also real’ only when these tests do provide\nconfirmation in accordance with the applicable inter-subjective\nnorms. \nIf faith is understood as commitment beyond independent objective\ncertification to the truth of some overall interpretation of\nexperience and reality, then all who commit themselves (with\nsufficient steadfastness) to such a Weltanschauung or\nworldview will be people of faith. Faith of this kind may be\nreligious, and it may be religious without being theistic, of course,\nas in classical Buddhism or Taoism. Some have argued that faith is a\nhuman universal: Cantwell Smith, for example, describes it as ‘a\nplanetary human characteristic [involving the] capacity to perceive,\nto symbolize, and live loyally and richly in terms of, a transcendent\ndimension to [human] life’ (1979, 140-141). There may also,\narguably, be non-religious faith: for example ‘scientific\natheists’, or ‘naturalists’, may be making a\nfaith-venture when they take there to be no more to reality than is in\nprinciple discoverable by the natural sciences. The suggestion that\natheism rests on a faith-venture will, however, be resisted by those\nwho maintain ‘the presumption of atheism’ (Flew, 1976): it\ntakes no leap to hold the default position. \nAn atheist’s faith-venture may, in any case, seem oddly so described\non the grounds that it provides no basis for practical hope or trust.\nProviding such a basis may plausibly be thought necessary for\nfaith— the truth to which the venturer commits must be\nexistentially important in this way. (Note James’s requirement that\nfaith-commitment is permissible only for resolving a ‘genuine\noption’, where a genuine option has inter alia to be\n‘momentous’, that is, existentially significant and\npressing (James 1896/1956, 3–4).) Some hold that the truth\naccepted by faith must be a ‘saving’ truth—a\nsolution to a deep problems about the human situation. Their view is\nthus that faith is essentially religious, and they\naccordingly enter into argument as to which religion offers the best\nsolution to the human problem (see, for example, Yandell 1990, 1999).\nJ.L.Schellenberg (2009) argues that the only kind of religious faith\nthat could be justified (if any is) is a sceptical\n‘ultimism’, in which one ‘assents’ to and\ntreats as real an imaginatively grasped conception of a\nmetaphysically, axiologically and soteriologically ultimate\nreality. \nSome may nevertheless argue that an existentially vital faith that\ngrounds hope can belong within a wholly secular context—that is,\nwithout counting in any recognisable sense as ‘religious’.\nCantwell Smith claims, for example, that ‘the Graeco-Roman\nheritage .. and its fecundating role in Western life [can] be seen as\none of the major spiritual traditions of our world’ (1979, 139).\nAnnette Baier suggests that ‘the secular equivalent of faith in\nGod, which we need in morality as well as in science or knowledge\nacquisition, is faith in the human community and its evolving\nprocedures—in the prospects for many-handed cognitive ambitions\nand moral hopes’ (Baier 1980, 133). More broadly, some maintain\nthat a meaningful spirituality is consistent with a non-religious\natheist naturalism, and include something akin to faith as essential\nto spirituality. For example, Robert Solomon takes spirituality to\nmean ‘the grand and thoughtful passions of life’, and\nholds that ‘a life lived in accordance with those\npassions’ entails choosing to see the world as ‘benign and\nlife [as] meaningful’, with the tragic not to be denied but\naccepted (Solomon 2002, 6 & 51).","contact.mail":"jc.bishop@auckland.ac.nz","contact.domain":"auckland.ac.nz"}]
