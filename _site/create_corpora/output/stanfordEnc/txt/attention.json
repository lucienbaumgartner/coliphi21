The nature of this selectivity is one of the principal points\nof disagreement between the extant theories of attention. Some of the\nmost influential theories treat the selectivity of attention as\nresulting from limitations in the brain’s capacity to process\nthe complex properties of multiple perceptual stimuli. Other theories\ntake the selectivity of attention to be the result of limitations in\nthe thinking subject’s capacity to consciously entertain\nmultiple trains of thought. A third group of theories account for\nattention’s selectivity in ways that need not make any reference\nto limitations in capacity. These latter theories relate the\nselectivity of attention to the selectivity required to maintain a\nsingle coherent course of action, to the weighting of sensory\ninformation in accordance with its expected precision, or to\ncompetition between mutually inhibitory streams of processing. \n\n\nThe instances of attention differ along several dimensions of\nvariation. In some of its instances attention is a perceptual\nphenomenon. In other instances it is a phenomenon related to\naction. In some instances the selectivity of attention is\nvoluntary. In other instances it is driven, quite independently of the\nsubject’s volition, by the high salience of attention-grabbing\nitems in the perceptual field. The difficulty of giving a unified\ntheory of attention that applies to attention’s voluntary and\ninvoluntary instances, and to its perceptual and enactive instances,\nmakes attention a topic of philosophical interest in its own right.\n\n\n\nAttention is also a topic of philosophical interest because of its\napparent relations to a number of other philosophically puzzling\nphenomena. There are empirical and theoretical considerations\nsuggesting that attention is closely related to\nconsciousness, and there are controversies over whether this\nrelationship of consciousness to attention is one of necessity, or\nsufficiency (or both or neither). There are also controversies –\nthought to be important to the viability of representationism about\nconsciousness – over the ways in which the phenomenal character\nof a conscious experience can be modulated by attention. Different\nconsiderations link attention to demonstrative reference, to\nthe development of an understanding of other minds, and to\nthe exercise of the will. Some work in the tradition of\nvirtue ethics takes attention to be morally important, since\nthere are at least some virtues that require one to attend\nappropriately. \n\n\nThe controversies concerning attention’s relation to these other\nphenomena often include debates about the philosophical significance\nof theories that have been developed through the empirical study of\nattention at the neuropsychological level, and at the cognitive\nlevel.\n\n\nIn the early modern period a variety of explanatory roles were\nassigned to attention by a number of different writers.\nDescartes’ Meditations provides one prominent example.\nThe result of Descartes’ First Meditation—that everything\ncan be doubted—is in apparent tension with the Third\nMeditation’s claim that clear and distinct ideas are beyond\ndoubt. Descartes introduces a claim about attention to resolve the\napparent conflict. He claims, in reply to the seventh set of\nobjections, that it is only when we pay attention to them that clear\nand distinct ideas provide a place where doubt does not take hold: \nThis passage is usually cited for the point that it makes about\nmemory, but the picture that Descartes is here outlining is also one\nin which attention has an important epistemic role to play: clarity\nand distinctness realize their epistemic potential only when attention\nis paid to the ideas that have them. Those ideas can be doubted, as,\nin accordance with the policy of the First Meditation they must be,\nbut that doubt cannot be maintained by a properly attentive thinker.\nThe crucial first move in Descartes’ epistemology—the move\nfrom radical doubt to certainty about the truth of particular clear\nand distinct ideas—is, therefore, a transition that is mediated\nby attention.  \nA quite different explanatory role is assigned to attention in Bishop\nBerkeley’s Principles of Human Knowledge, although here\nagain we find that it is in order to remove an epistemological glitch\nthat the notion of attention is brought in. In the Introduction to\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge Berkeley rejects Locke’s\nclaim that there exist such things as Abstract Ideas. But Berkeley\nretains Locke’s commitment to the core empiricist claim that the\nthinking of thoughts is always a matter of handling ideas received\nfrom experience. This would seem to lead to the conclusion that it is\nnot possible to think about abstractia, but Berkeley realizes that\nthat conclusion is unacceptable. It is, as he says, perfectly possible\nto think about the properties of triangles in general.  \nIn the second edition of the Principles Berkeley added a\ncouple of sentences to the Introduction that make it clear that it is\nattention and, in particular, the withholding of attention, that is\nsupposed to explain the possibility of thinking about abstractia\nwithout the need to postulate Abstract Ideas. These added sentences\ntell us that: \nIn these sentences Berkeley is not attempting to elaborate a theory of\nattention. He says nothing more about the idea that attention might\nenable thought about abstractia. It is nonetheless clear that he\nrequires attention to play an important role in his picture of the\nmind. \nBerkeley’s idea that attention and abstraction are linked was\ntaken up in the second half of the nineteenth century by William\nHamilton. Hamilton did not, however, think that the link between\nattention and abstraction provided the starting point for an\nexplanation of attention, nor of abstraction. That is because he took\nit that the relationship between the two phenomena was too intimate to\nbe explanatory. He writes that:  \nDescartes and Berkeley treat attention very briefly, but each assigns\nattention to a particular explanatory role. Locke’s treatment of\nattention is also brief, but he has his own theory of the explanatory\nrole that attention plays, and he goes further than either Descartes\nor Berkeley in giving us a positive account of what attention is. The\naccount is given as part of the catalogue of ‘Modes of\nThinking’ that Locke sets out towards the beginning of Chapter\nNineteen of Book Two of the Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding: \nIn addition to providing these quick theories of\n‘reverie’, ‘attention’ and ‘intention or\nstudy’, the very same sentence of Locke’s Essay\nprovides theories of ‘remembrance’,\n‘recollection’, ‘contemplation’,\n‘sleep’, ‘dreaming’ and ‘ecstasy’.\nIt is significant that Locke’s account of attention is given so\nbriefly, and that it goes by as part of a crowd of theories of these\nvarious other mental phenomena. Locke is not here engaging in an\nuncharacteristically slapdash piece of rapid-fire theorizing. His\nintention in going through this catalogue is to establish that these\nare topics for which no new substantive theory is needed. These are,\nin Locke’s theory, simply ‘modes of thinking’:\n‘reverie’, ‘study’ etc. are not names for\nindependent phenomena, existing in their own right. Instead they are\nthe various names that thinking is given when it takes place in\nvarious ways.  \nOne consequence of Locke’s treatment of attention as a mode of\nthinking is that, once we have a theory of thinking before us, we need\nno further theory to account for how attention, contemplation, study,\netc. are possible. (Just as, to use the classic example of\n‘modes’, we need no substantive independent theory, once\nwe have a theory of walking, to explain how limping, pacing or ambling\nare possible.) We need to say something in giving an analysis\nof the nature of modes, but—once the thing-to-be-modified has\nbeen accounted for—the thing that we say can be something brief,\nalong the lines indicated by Locke. We do not need to give a theory\nthat postulates any substances or processes specific to the\nexplanation of attention. \nLocke’s modal view of attention has the consequence that no very\nsubstantive theory of attention is needed once our theory of thinking\nis in place. It also entails, and for the same reason, that attention\ncannot figure in the explanation of how thinking itself is possible\n(for any explanation in which it did figure would be analogous to an\nexplanation of walking that takes strolling to already be possible; it\nwould get its explanatory priorities backwards).  \nLocke viewed attention as an explanatorily slight phenomenon—a\nmode of thought that is not in need of much explanation, nor capable\nof providing much. Theories of attention moved away from that view\nover the course of the eighteenth century. Attention was increasingly\ntreated as a phenomenon with explanatory work to do, and so as a\nphenomenon for which a substantive independent theory needed to be\ngiven. The attempt to provide such a theory got properly underway in\n1738, when Christian Wolff’s textbook on psychology was the\nfirst to devote a whole chapter to the topic of attention (see\nHatfield, 1995, for an excellent discussion). \nDuring this period the explanatory remit for theories of attention\nbroadened in two directions. The first move was away from the idea\nthat attention acts on already-received ideas and towards the idea\nthat attention is involved in the initial reception of those ideas.\nLocke had characterized attention as the registration of\nalready-received ideas into memory. But by 1769, when Henry Home Kames\nadded the appendix of ‘Terms Defined or Explained’ to his\nElements of Criticism, attention’s role as a regulator\nof cognitive input was regarded as definitive of it: \nAs well as beginning to assign to attention a role in the explanation\nof the reception of ideas, eighteenth century theories also moved\ntowards including a role for attention in the production of\nbehaviour. This is particularly clear in Dugald\nStewart’s 1792 Elements of the Philosophy of the Human\nMind. Stewart retains Locke’s view that attention has an\nessential role to play in determining which things get stored in\nmemory. He adds to that view the claim that attention has a role in\ndetermining which particular memories get recalled, writing that\n“Some attention [is] necessary for any act of memory\nwhatever.” (1792, 53). Stewart also claims that attention has a\nrole in the explanation of the development and deployment of at least\nsome skilled behaviours. The example that Stewart gives here is that\nof ‘the dexterity of jugglers’ which, he says,\n“merits a greater degree of attention from philosophers than it\nhas yet attracted” (62).  \nIn the century between Locke’s Essay and\nStewart’s Elements, then, attention ceases to be seen\nmerely as a certain mode of idea-handling, and comes to be seen as a\nphenomenon in need of its own explanation, and with a role to play in\nthe explanation of perception, in the explanation of memory (both in\nits storage and in its recall), and in the explanation of skilled\naction.  \nIn the century after Stewart’s Elements the diversity\namong the phenomena that attention was expected to explain continued\nto grow, and it continued to include phenomena from across the\npsychological spectrum from perception, to thought, to action. By the\nend of the nineteenth century, in what was a crucial period in the\ndevelopment of scientific psychology, there were some psychologists,\nsuch as E.B. Titchener, who took the role of attention in perception\nand in ‘sensory clearness’ to be its most essential\nfeature (see Titchener, 1908, 1910); others, such as Alexander Bain,\nwho thought that the essential feature of attention was its role in\naction, (Bain, 1888); and a third group, of whom G.F. Stout was the\nmost prominent example, who argued that the primary job for a theory\nof attention was to explain attention’s role in reflective\nthought (see Stout, 1891).  \nAs a result of this diversity in their conceptions of\nattention’s explanatory remit (and as a result of the lack of an\nestablished methodology for empirical psychology) the debates between\nexponents of these various psychological theories of attention got\nthemselves into what was acknowledged to be a ‘chaotic\nstate’ (Pillsbury, 1906).  \nThe diversity of explanatory roles assigned to attention in the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries meant that theorizing about\nattention at the end of the nineteenth century was in a chaotic state.\nThe ambition for theorists of attention writing at the end of the\nnineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries was to get\nthis chaos into order. The theories of attention proposed in this\nperiod therefore tended to take the form of attempts to reveal\nattention as something less mysterious and less complex than earlier\nwriters had supposed. This ambition to give a ‘nothing\nbut…’ reduction of attention can be seen in the most\ninfluential work from this period: William James’ The\nPrinciples of Psychology (1890). \nOne aspect of James’ approach is to play down the more complex\nperceptual aspects of attention. His chapter on attention includes a\ndiscussion of experiments into what we now call\n‘subitizing’—that is, into the ability to perceive\nthe cardinality of small stimulus sets without needing to count their\nmembers—but James writes of these experiments that it “is\nobvious that such observations decide nothing at all about our\nattention, properly so called” (407). \nAlthough James plays down attention’s role in complex perceptual\nphenomena, he does assign attention to an important explanatory role\nin the production of behaviour. He claims, for example, that\n‘Volition is nothing but attention’ (424). But when James\nmakes such claims it is as part of a general project that seeks always\nto be deflationary where possible. When James associates attention\nwith volition it is as a way of suggesting how volition could be given\na deflationary treatment, not as a way of inflating attention’s\nexplanatory role. \nThis deflationary approach to attention’s explanatory remit\nmeans that, when it comes to giving an account of the ‘intimate\nnature of the attention process’, James can identify two fairly\nsimple processes which, he claims, ‘probably coexist in all our\nconcrete attentive acts’. and which ‘possibly form in\ncombination a complete reply’ to the question of\nattention’s ‘intimate nature’ (1890, 411). The\nprocesses that James identifies are: \nThe first of these processes is reasonably familiar. By ‘the\naccommodation or adjustment of the sensory organs’ James means\nsuch processes as pointing one’s ears in the right direction,\nbringing one’s eyes into focus, taking a sniff, and so on. \nJames’s talk of ‘anticipatory preparation’ of\n‘ideation centres’ is a little less clear, but the point\nis again a quite straightforward one. What James has in mind here is\nsimply imagination. His claim is that when attention does not\ninvolve adjusting one’s sense organs it consists in imagining\nthe things or actions that one is attending to, or looking for. \nJames illustrates his claim about attention’s link to\nimagination with an example from Hermann von Helmholtz. The example is\nan important one for James, and it illustrates some important features\nof attention that subsequent theorists have tended to neglect. The\nexample involves the variety of attention that needs to be paid when\ntrying to discern the overtones in a note played on the piano.\nHelmholtz asks us to sit at the piano and to play a G, then, imagining\nthe sound that we have just heard, to play a low C. Doing this, it is\nclaimed, enables one to hear that G is discernibly there (as the third\novertone) within the sound produced when C is played.\nHelmholtz’s claim, which James endorses, is that the kind of\nattention that is paid when listening for an overtone is constituted\nby the imagining of what that overtone would sound like. James goes\nonto claim that there is a wide range of cases in which paying\nattention to what one is doing consists in this same sort of\npreparatory imaginative engagement. \nHere, as in his more frequently discussed treatment of emotion, it is\ndistinctive of James’s approach that he tries to account for a\nlarge-scale personal-level psychological phenomenon in a realist but\nsomewhat revisionary way, so as to be able to give his account using\nrelatively simple and unmysterious explanatory resources. An\nalternative deflationary approach—one which James explicitly\ncontrasted with his own—is the approach taken in 1886 by F.H.\nBradley.  \nBradley advocated a view according to which attention is not the sort\nof phenomenon for which an independent and substantive theory can or\nneeds to be given. Bradley does not develop this point in much detail,\nand it is a point on which he would later change his mind, but in his\n1886 article, ‘Is there a special activity of attention?’,\nBradley was concerned with arguing that a project such as\nJames’s one of identifying particular processes as the\nattention-constituting ones was wrongheaded. He claims that no\nparticular attention-processes can be identified since: \nAlthough Bradley does not use the Lockean vocabulary, (and although\nJames himself does not seem to have taken Bradley in this way)\nBradley’s position here has much in common with Locke’s\nclaim that attention is a mode. Bradley’s position,\nlike Locke’s, is that what is essential to an instance of\nattention is not the matter of which processes are taking\nplace, but the facts about how the things that happen happen.\nHe therefore takes the ennumeration of processes to be the wrong form\nfor a theory of attention to take. \nOther writers who were contemporary with Bradley and James took\ndifferent approaches to the project of giving a deflationary\nexplanation of attention. In Theodule Ribot’s 1888 book La\nPsychologie De L’Attention the attempt to explain attention\ntook an approach that we would now classify as behaviourist. In 1888\nbehaviourism had not yet been established as a general approach in\nphilosophical or psychological theories of the mind, but Ribot’s\nsuggestion that attention’s behavioural manifestations are\nessential to it is nonetheless recognizable as an early articulation\nof behaviourism in a strong form:  \nA somewhat more moderate version of this behaviour-centred approach\nwas taken by Alexander Bain, who identified attention, not with its\nbehavioural manifestations themselves, but with truncated versions of\nthe motor-control processes that typically bring about those\nbehavioural manifestations: processes ‘stopping short of the\nactual movement performed by the organ’ (Bain, 1888, 371). Much\nas Ribot’s view can be seen as an early version of behaviourism,\nBain’s view can be seen as an early version of the motor-based\napproaches to attention that can be found in the literature of the\npresent century (see\n Section 2.8\n below). \nThe variety among the deflationary explanatory approaches that\ncharacterized the theories of attention offered in the nineteenth\ncentury gave way in the early twentieth century to a period in which\none such explanatory tactic was dominant: the tactic of behaviourism.\nBehaviourists tended to neglect attention, but they did not ignore it\nentirely. John Dashiell’s 1928 Fundamentals of Objective\nPsychology, for example, is a behaviourist work that attempts to\naccount for attention “as a form of posturing” (Ch. 10,\n§3). The project of identifying a behaviour with which to explain\nattention was, nonetheless, an understandably unpopular one. As\nGilbert Ryle notes, it is not only attention, but also ‘heed\nconcepts’ more generally, that resist simple behaviourist\nanalysis:  \nIn the middle of the twentieth century behaviourism’s dominance\nwaned, cognitive psychology established itself, and a new theoretical\napproach to the explanation of attention was developed. These three\ndevelopments were intimately related to one another. Instrumental to\nall three was the publication in 1958 of Donald Broadbent’s\nPerception and Communication.  \nThe year prior to Perception and Communication’s\npublication had seen B.F. Skinner’s attempt, in Verbal\nBehaviour (1957), to apply a behaviourist explanatory approach to\ndistinctively human aspects of cognition. Skinner’s project in\nthat book failed, and Noam Chomsky’s famous 1959 review of the\nbook made its failure conspicuous. Chomsky’s own work in\nSyntactic Structures (1957) went some way towards\nestablishing the new cognitive paradigm for psychology by showing how\ninternal processing could be theorized by describing transformations\non representations in abstraction from the question of how those\nrepresentations were realized. Donald Broadbent’s distinctive\ncontribution to the overthrow of behaviourism was to show how the move\nfrom behavioural data to the postulation of a particular cognitive\narchitecture could be disciplined by the then-new strategy of\nimporting into psychology the intellectual resources used in thinking\nabout information technology. The year in which Broadbent’s book\nwas published was an important year for the development of such\ntechnologies, being the year in which (inter alia) the integrated\ncircuit chip was invented (see Mole, 2012). It was also the year in\nwhich Subscriber Trunk Dialling was introduced to UK telephone\nexchanges. The technology of the telephone exchange was what most\nnaturally suggested itself as a metaphor for attention at the time\nwhen Broadbent was writing.  \nTowards the end of Perception and Communication Broadbent\nexplicitly sets out the claim that the theoretical resources developed\nin thinking about the transmission of information through telephone\nexchanges provide the basis for an alternative to behaviourism. He\nalso attacks the positivistic methodological principles that had given\nmany behaviourists their motivation. But the central lesson from\nBroadbent’s work, so far as the theory of attention goes, is a\nlesson that he takes to be independent of this attack on behaviourism\nand its positivistic foundations. At an early stage in Perception\nand Communication Broadbent remarks that:  \nThis introduction of the notion of capacity limitations into\ndiscussions of perception and attention was, as Broadbent here\npredicted, hugely and permanently influential. \nBroadbent claimed not only that the human brain is subject to capacity\nlimitations of the sort that communications engineers had learnt to\ntheorize, he claimed also that these limitations are clustered so that\nthere is a single bottleneck in capacity that is especially critical\nto the brain’s handling of perceptual information. This\nbottleneck was said to occur at the junction of two systems operating\nin series; the first system having a large capacity for information\nprocessing, and operating automatically on all of the stimuli with\nwhich the subject is presented; the second having a much smaller\ncapacity, and so needing to be deployed selectively.  \nThose who followed Broadbent took it that the bottleneck that results\nfrom the connection of these two systems corresponds to attention in\nthe sense that, when a representation of a stimulus passes through\nthat bottleneck, the stimulus ipso facto counts as one to\nwhich attention is paid. \nBroadbent himself was cautious about presenting his claims about\ncapacity-bottlenecks as a theory of attention. The word\n‘attention’ occurs rarely in Perception and\nCommunication. Broadbent’s later book, Decision and\nStress (1971), does describe his earlier experiments as\n‘studies of attention’, but here too Broadbent prefers to\ntalk about the phenomenon observed in the lab as ‘selective\nperception’ (chapter V) or ‘vigilance’ (chapters II\nand III). In an article from 1982, entitled, ‘Task Combination\nand Selective Intake of Information’, he admits that: “The\ntopic of this paper is one that is often termed\n‘attention’, and it may seem unduly artificial to have\ngiven it a more cumbrous title.” But he goes on to reassert his\nqualms:  \nWhen Broadbent does use the word ‘attention’ it is mostly\nin discussions of attention shifting. His view, at least in\nhis early work, seems to have been that where there is a bottleneck in\nour information processing capacity there need to be additional\nmechanisms that control how our limited capacity resources will be\ndeployed. These additional mechanisms of bottleneck-control\nseem to have been what Broadbent thought of as the attention\nmechanisms. He never took himself to have given a theory of them, only\nto have given a theory of where they would be needed. Nor were these\nmechanisms the topic that was at issue in the debates about attention\nthat Broadbent prompted. Those debates were concerned with questions\nabout the nature and location of the bottleneck itself, not about the\nfactors that determine what, on any particular occasion, gets to pass\nthrough it. \nIn the decades following Broadbent a great many psychologists devoted\nthemselves to the task of locating the attentional bottleneck that he\nhad postulated. Almost all psychologists writing at this time were\nguided to some degree by Broadbent’s\ntwo-serial-systems-and-a-bottleneck picture of perceptual processing.\nThe question of whether a given task is attention demanding was\ntherefore understood to depend on the question of whether the\nperformance of that task requires the engagement of the small-capacity\nsystem that comes after the bottleneck of attention, and so research\ninto the attention-related demands of particular tasks became another\nway by which to approach the issue of where the attentional bottleneck\nis located. Broadbent’s two-systems-and-a-bottleneck model was\nfrequently questioned, but for most research into attention in the\nsecond half of the twentieth century it was very much the orthodox\nview. This has now changed. In psychology’s current paradigm,\nonly a few aspects of Broadbent’s picture remain orthodox. \nPsychologists attempting to produce a theory of attention in the\nnineteen sixties and seventies were highly influenced by Donald\nBroadbent’s picture of attention as corresponding to a\nbottleneck in information processing capacity resulting from the\nconnection of two seperate perceptual processing systems. The first\npiece of business for these psychologists was to locate this\nattentional bottleneck by determining which sorts of processing are\ndone by the large capacity, pre-bottleneck system, and which by the\nsmall capacity, post-bottleneck system. Debates between these\npsychologists gave rise to various theories in which the selectivity\nof attention was characterized with a claim about the location of this\nbottleneck. \nBroadbent’s own account of the distribution of processing\nbetween the pre-attentional system and the post-attentional system\ndefines the ‘early selection’ theory of attention. He\nclaimed that only very simple properties are detected by the large\ncapacity system, and that any semantic properties, or properties\nrelating to the particular identity of a stimulus, are\ndetected only after representations of the stimulus have passed\nthrough the attentional-bottleneck and into the smaller capacity\nsystem.  \nThe personal-level consequences of this early selection theory are\nthat we can recognize what things are and what they mean only if we\nare paying attention to them, but can detect the simple physical\nproperties of things even when paying no attention to them. The theory\ncan be thought of as a communication-theoretic rendering of two\nintuitive ideas. The first is that one has no immediate control over\none’s awareness of simple features of one’s environment,\nsuch as the fact that there are people talking in the next room.\nWhatever one is paying attention to, one will continue to hear some\nchatter to be going on, if any is. The second idea is that the details\nof things—such as the semantic content of that chatter—can\nbe detected only for the one or two things to which one is paying\nattention: If one wants to know what the chatter is about, one has to\nlisten.  \nThe early selection theory also entails, more problematically, that\nthe semantic properties of an unattended item must remain\nunrepresented in the nervous system, and so it entails that those\nproperties can have no psychological effects. According to this view\nthe semantic features of unattended items cannot explain why those\nitems attract attention to themselves, on the occasions when they do.\nIt was to this aspect of the theory that its opponents most frequently\nobjected. \nThe chief rivals of Broadbent’s early selection theory were the\n‘late selectionists’, who claimed that all (or almost all)\nperceivable properties are detected automatically, by a large capacity\nsystem that operates on all of the stimuli with which the subject is\npresented. According to this late selection theory of attention the\nconsequences of passing through the bottleneck of attention into the\npost-attentive small capacity system are only (1) that the subject\ncomes to be conscious of the contents that the large capacity system\nhas already succeeded in encoding and (2) that those contents come to\nbe stored in working memory (Deutsch and Deutsch, 1963). \nAlthough it was originally proposed against the background of\nBroadbent’s now superseded theoretical framework, it would be\ntoo quick to dismiss the late selection theory as an obsolete one. The\ntheory has much in common with some plausible and empirically\nwell-supported views found in the current literature. Jesse Prinz, for\nexample, shares the late selectionists’ view that\nattention’s primary role is not in managing limited perceptual\nprocessing resources, but in projecting already-processed\nrepresentations to working memory. Prinz’s view, varying a theme\nfrom the work of Stanislas Dehaene, is that this projection to working\nmemory is what makes it the case that the content represented comes to\nconscious awareness. (Prinz, 2005, 2012, Dehaene et al.,\n2006).  \nIt should be noted that Prinz’s main philosophical business is\nwith the explanation of consciousness. Objections have been\nraised as to whether the process of projection to working\nmemory—which Prinz refers to as\n‘attention’—can adequately account for the various\nthings that attention does (Wu, 2014, §6.3.2). If it cannot then\nPrinz is willing to allow that this process is not the sole referent\nof the English word ‘attention’, writing that ‘other\nresearchers may choose to define attention differently’, and\nthat ‘those who disagree with my analysis of attention could\nsimply drop the term “attention”’ (Prinz, 2012, p.\n95). \nThe central component of the late-selection theory, as it was\noriginally understood, was that the effect of withdrawing attention\nfrom a stimulus is to make it the case that the stimulus is processed\nwithout the subject’s awareness, rather than not being processed\nat all. This component of the view has, to some extent, been\nvindicated. The claim that unattended stimuli are subjected to some\nprocessing of which the subject lacks awareness, including some\nprocessing of those stimuli’s semantic properties, is now\nuncontroversial. Since we know that the semantic properties of\nunattended stimuli can, for example, produce negative priming effects\n(Tipper and Driver, 1988), we know that unattended stimuli are\nprocessed in a way that allows at least some of their semantic\nproperties to be encoded. The semantic properties of unattended items\nhave such effects despite the fact that subjects are typically unaware\nof what those properties are.  \nThe traditional late selection theory is right in taking it that\ninattention can lead to properties being encoded without our\nawareness, rather than not being encoded at all, but that theory is\nalso committed to the claim that attention’s only\neffects are in determining what gets remembered and experienced, and\nso that the direction of attention has no effects on the initial\nperceptual processing to which stimuli are subjected. These claims we\nnow know to be false. An important experiment by O’Connor et\nal. used fMRI to compare neural activity in subjects who, in\nvarious task conditions, were presented with high and low contrast\ncheckerboard patterns in one or other half of the visual field\n(O’Connor et al. 2002). In some conditions the subjects\nhad to perform a task involving these checkerboard patterns. In other\nconditions the patterns were irrelevant to the task that the subjects\nwere performing (and in a third condition no pattern was presented,\nbut the subjects were attending to the screen in anticipation of a\npattern that was about to be presented). The results of these\ncomparisons revealed that even in the first parts of neural circuitry\nthrough which information from the retina passes, on its way to the\nvisual cortex—the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei—there is a\ndifference in the baserate of neural activity, and a difference in the\nresponse that stimuli elicit, depending on what the subject is\nattending to. These findings indicate that attention’s effects\nare not limited to cortical loci that are upstream from a late process\nof attentional selection. They therefore refute any version of the\nlate-selection theory according to which the selectivity of attention\nis entirely a ‘late process’, occurring after initial\nperceptual encoding is complete. \nThe findings of O’Connor et al. create fewer problems for\nsome recent theories in which elements of the late selection view are\nretained. Nilli Lavie and her collaborators have proposed one such\ntheory, which attempts to combine some aspects of the late selection\ntheory with some aspects of its early selectionist rival. According to\nLavie’s ‘load theory’, attention does\ncorrespond to a capacity bottleneck—much as Broadbent\nthought—but the differing demands of the task that is at hand\nlead to differences as to when that bottleneck restricts the\nprocessing of a stimulus: in conditions of where the processing\ndemands of perception are high the bottleneck will operate at an early\nstage, with the result that unattended stimuli will be processed\nrather little; in conditions where the processing load of perception\nis lower it will operate at a later stage, with the result that\nunattended stimuli will be processed rather more (Lavie & Tsal,\n1994, Lavie et al. 2004). This load theory predicts that\nperipheral stimuli will elicit less neural activation, and will be\nless distracting, when the subject’s task is a perceptually\ndemanding one. The theory’s predictions have been borne out by\nbehavioural and neurological observations (Lavie, 2005). Its\ntheoretical apparatus has provided a useful framework for the\nphilosophical treatment of attention’s relationship to\nconsciousness (Hine, 2010). It is perhaps for reasons of fashion that\nfew psychologists have been persuaded to follow Lavie’s\nrehabilitation of the Broadbentian framework’s basic terms.  \nOther recently proposed theories also retain the idea that attentional\nselectivity is the result of capacity limitations, but do so while\nretreating further than Lavie does from the picture of attention that\nBroadbent introduced. These theories reject the terms of the debate\nbetween early and late selectionists because they reject the idea that\nthe capacity limitations responsible for attention are clustered into\na single bottleneck. In some cases this is because the selectivity of\nattention is taken to be the result of multiple bottlenecks\nin processing capacity (see, e.g., Johnston and McCann, 2006). In\nother cases it is because the current theorists see capacity\nlimitations as occurring throughout the processing stream, and not as\nclustered into bottlenecks at all (see Driver, 2001, for a suggestion\nalong these lines, and Allport, Antonis & Reynolds, 1972, for an\nearlier indication of it).  \nThe early and late selection theories dominated discussions of\nattention in the decades following Broadbent’s seminal work, but\nby the beginning of the nineteen nineties it had become clear that the\ndebate between advocates of the early selection theory and advocates\nof the late selection theory had become fruitless. Those debates were\ntherefore taken to have been predicated on some sort of mistaken\nassumption. Several diagnoses have been proposed as to what that\nmistaken assumption might have been. Little consensus has been reached\nas to which of these diagnoses is correct, with the result that some\ntheorists—such as those discussed at the end of the preceding\nsection—retain ideas from the early and late selection theories,\nwhile others regard this as a wrong-headedly retrograde step. \nOne diagnosis is that the early/late debate was fruitless because the\nterms ‘early’ and ‘late’ are themselves\nproblematic. If perceptual processing occurs in a parallel processing\narchitecture without any prevailing direction of information flow then\nthere is no sense in labeling one part of that architecture as earlier\nor later than any other. If the attentional bottleneck is located in a\nsystem that has such an architecture then it may be this that explains\nwhy there was no satisfactory answer to the question of whether\nattentional selection is early or late. It was with this thought in\nmind that several writers suggested that the failure of the debate\nbetween early and late selection theories was owing to the fact that\nthat debate requires us to make an assumption about the\nlinearity of the processing stream in which selection occurs\n(see, e.g., Prinz and Hommel, 2002, 3). This is a thought that needs\nto be treated with care. \nThe claim that it was a problematic assumption about linearity that\nled the early/late selection debate into fruitlessness received its\nmost influential treatment in an important paper by Alan Allport\n(Allport, 1992). Allport identifies several problematic assumptions\nthat the early/late selection debate requires. His characterization of\nwhat he takes to be the problematic assumption about linearity is as\nthe claim that: \nThis assumption about linearity does not seem, on the face of it, to\nbe a problematic one. There is nothing to be objected to in the claim\nthat the situations in which we encounter a written word and come to\nbe in a position to know what that word means are situations in which\nour sensory transducers respond firstly to simple nonsemantic\nproperties of the word. In order for creatures like us to detect the\nsemantic properties of written words, it is necessary for our\ninformation processing systems to first encode some information about\nthe simple spatial properties of the lines on the page. This\ninformation does then get passed on to subsequent processing stages in\nwhich more complex properties, concerned with semantics and stimulus\nidentity, get processed. If this sort of linearity is what Allport was\ntaking issue with then it seems he must have been mistaken, since\nthere is nothing problematic about the idea that there is this much\nlinearity in the processing that any given stimulus is subjected to.\n \nNor is there anything unscientific about that idea. It continues to be\nentirely normal for neuroscientists to refer to the processing that\ntakes place in occipital brain areas as ‘early’ and the\nprocessing in frontal areas as ‘late’. In a much-cited\nreview of neuroimaging work on attention Sabine Kastner and Leslie\nUngerleider, for example, speak of:  \nThe orthodox view expressed by Kastner and Ungerleider is subject to\ndiffering interpretations. Those who think that perception and\ncognition are best thought of as arising from a hierarchical Bayesian\nprocess might reject the idea that information progresses through the\nnervous system in a bottom-up fashion, with the detection of simple\nproperties happening at an early stage, and the detection of more\ncomplex properties happening at a later one. Current advocates of such\nhierarchical Bayesian theories place great emphasis on the idea that\nthe prior hypotheses required by a Bayesian inference can be generated\nin a top-down fashion, and can then be tested against incoming signals\nwhich contain information only about the ways in which the predictions\ngenerated by these hypotheses are in error (Hohwy, 2013). Such\ntheories break from the tradition of thinking about the information\nflow in the brain as being largely one-way, but they retain the idea\nthat information is organized into a structure with earlier and later\nstages, with these stages now being understood as corresponding to the\nmore or less abstract layers in an hierarchically organized Bayesian\ninference. They therefore retain the idea that there are earlier and\nlater stages in the processing of any given stimulus, while rejecting\nthe idea that there is one predominant direction of information flow\nin the brain. Since this much linearity remains in our current\nthinking about the architecture of perceptual processing, we cannot\ncoherently blame an assumption about this much linearity for the\ntroubles that led to the fruitlessness of the debate between early and\nlate selectionists.  \nThat is not to say that the early/late selection debate was entirely\nfree of problematic assumptions relating to linearity—only that\npsychology has not yet settled upon a satisfactory account of the way\nin which assumptions about linearity led the early/late debate into\ntrouble.  \nOne reason why assumptions about linearity may have been problematic\nis that when, following Broadbent, we think about hierarchical\nperceptual processing while bearing in mind the communications\nengineer’s concerns about capacity limitations, it then becomes\nnatural to make additional assumptions about the way in which this\nhierarchically organized architecture supports personal-level\ncognition. The early/late debate’s problems are more plausibly\nblamed on these additional assumptions, rather than on any assumptions\nabout hierarchical organization per se. Given that some\nphysical properties of a thing must first be represented in order for\nthe semantic properties of that thing to be detected by the subject,\nit is natural for the communications engineer to suppose that no\nfurther representation of these physical properties needs to be\ngenerated in order for the subject to become aware of them, so that a\nsubject who is experiencing the semantic properties of a stimulus must\nhave been through a process that already gives him an experience of\nthat stimulus’s simple spatial properties. This additional\nsupposition would be a mistake. In fact, the brain represents the\nphysical properties of stimuli in multiple, parallel, somewhat\noverlapping systems, only some of which put the subject in a position\nto think about the properties that they represent. In order to get to\na representation of the meaning of the word on a page, the\nsubject’s brain must represent that word’s physical\nproperties, but it turns out that the brain’s representation of\nthese physical properties need not put the subject in a position to\nform thoughts about them. The subject’s access to those\nproperties might require that they be represented all over again, in\nsome parallel system. From the point of view introduced by Broadbent\n– that of a communications engineer who is concerned with the\nmanagement of limited capacity channels – this seems strangely\nprofligate. It is this—not an assumption about linearity per\nse, but an assumption about the linearity of the processes that\nsupport personal level thinking—that created problems for the\nearly/late debate.  \nOnce the problematic assumption about linearity has been made precise,\nhowever, we see that it cannot be satisfactory to credit the entire\ncollapse of the early/late debate to this assumption. The falsity of\nthe assumption about the linearity of the processes supporting\npersonal-level awareness does not undermine the very idea that the\nearly/late debate is a meaningful one. The problems it creates are\nlargely methodological. The falsity of that assumption means that one\ncannot make an inference from a lack of personal-level awareness of\nsome content to the absence of representations encoding that content.\nIt also means that Broadbent was wrong to suppose that the\npsychological effects of unattended stimuli can only depend on those\nproperties of which the inattentive subject can be aware. But these\nare methodological problems. They do not, by themselves, imply that\nthe debate between the early selection theory and the late selection\ntheory must have been misconceived. The situation that we find\nourselves in is, then, a somewhat unhappy one. Everybody agrees that\nthere was something misconceived about the debate between the two\ntheories of attention that dominated the decades following\nBroadbent’s reintroduction of attention to the psychological\nagenda. The ongoing influence of Broadbent’s selection theory,\nand of the early/late debate, is often noted and sometimes lamented\n(Driver, 2001, 56). But nobody is clear about whether the elements of\nthose theories that are retained in current theorizing are problematic\nones.  \nIn the early nineteen eighties, Anne Treisman and her collaborators\nidentified the existence of ‘the binding problem’, and\ndescribed a process that could solve that problem. Treisman proposed\nthat attention be identified with this process. This proposal is known\nas the Feature Integration Theory of attention. The theory has been\nhugely influential, not only as a theory of attention, but also as the\nframework that introduced and regimented research into the\nindependently interesting question of the binding problem (for more on\nwhich, see\n ‘The Unity of Consciousness’\n esp.\n §2.2).\n  \nTreisman describes the way in which the binding problem arises like\nthis:  \nWe can illustrate this problem with an example. Suppose we have a\nsubject who is presented with a red tomato and a green apple, both at\nthe same time. This visual input is, as Treisman says, initially\nbroken up for specialized distributed processing—so, for\nexample, one part of the brain is responsible for detecting the shapes\nof things, a different part is responsible for detecting their\ncolours. The shape-detecting centres represent the fact that a\ntomato-shaped thing is present, and they represent the fact that an\napple-shaped thing is present. The colour-detecting centres represent\nthe fact that a red thing is present, and the fact that a green thing\nis present. But the subject, if he is a normal human, knows more than\nis implied by these four facts: He knows that the red thing is the\ntomato-shaped thing and the green thing the apple-shaped thing. To\nknow this he must have a way of ‘binding’ the\nrepresentation of red in the colour centre with the representation of\nthe tomato shape in the shape centre. The binding problem is the\nproblem of knowing how to put together the properties that are\ndetected in seperate specialized detection centres. \nTreisman’s proposed solution exploits the fact that\nspatial representations are ubiquitous, and the idea that\nthere is only one thing to be seen in any one place at any one time.\nIf the centre for detecting colours detects red at place one\nand green at place two, and if the centre for detecting shape\ndetects a tomato shape at place one and an apple shape at\nplace two, then, given the principle that there is a maximum of\none visible object per place per time, the binding problem can be\nsolved. Treisman therefore proposes that we achieve a correctly bound\nrepresentation by moving a variously sized ‘window’ from\none location in the perceptual scene to another. This window blocks\nout the information from all but a single location, and all the\nfeatures found at that location can then be ‘bound’ as\nbeing features of the same object. The area covered by the window\nwithin which features are bound is taken to correspond to the region\nto which attention is being paid. \nThere is more than one way to understand the explanatory import of\nTreisman’s claim that the window of attention corresponds to the\nwindow within which features are bound. Treisman’s early work\npresents that claim as an attempt to identify the processes of\nattention (by telling us that they are the processes of feature\nintegration). In her later work the explanation being offered is no\nlonger simply one in which it is attention that occupies the role of\nexplanadum and the binding processes that occupy the role of\nexplanans. Her later claim is that solving the binding problem is one\nrole for the kind of selectivity that attention enables. \nIn some work the Feature Integration Theory has been pressed into the\nservice of more ambitious explanatory goals. The theory plays an\nimportant role in John Campbell’s 2002 attempt, in Reference\nand Consciousness, to use attention to explain how the reference\nof demonstrative expressions gets fixed by their producers and\nunderstood by their consumers (see section\n 3.2).\n Treisman herself suggests, albeit tentatively, that descendants of\nthe Feature Integration Theory may provide part of the explanation for\n“the bound, unitary, interpreted, personal view of the world of\nsubjective experience” (Treisman, 2003, 111). She goes on to\nsuggest, again tentatively, that the sort of explanation that such a\ntheory provides “should give us all the information there is\nabout the conditions that create consciousness” (op\ncit). \nOpposed to those who think that a theory of feature binding will be a\nlarge component in our theory of attention, or of the unity of\nconsciousness, or of anything else, are a number of philosophers (and\na smaller number of psychologists) who deny that feature binding\ncreates a problem that needs serious cognitive apparatus to solve it.\nSuch claims have been made for various reasons. They are generally\nmade as part of large-scale revisionary proposals for the conceptual\nframework of cognitive neuroscience. Kevin O’Regan and Alva\nNoë’s rejection of the binding problem ‘as, in\nessence, a pseudo-problem’ (O’Regan and Noë, 2001,\n967) comes as part of their general attack on the idea that perception\nrequires the representation of the thing perceived. Vincent Di Lollo\nhas suggested that the assumptions about neural coding that generate\nthe binding problem have been superceded, with the result that the\nbinding problem is an ill-defined one (Di Lollo, 2012). And M.R.\nBennett and P.M.S. Hacker, in their book-length critique of the\nphilosophical foundations of neuroscience, claim that the notions of\nrepresentation and information that enjoy currency in neuroscience are\nsubject to various confusions, and that these confusions lead to it\nbeing ‘widespread’ for neuroscientists to make\n“confused statements of the so-called binding problem”\n(Bennett and Hacker, 2003, 14). These debates about the status of the\nbinding problem (reviewed by Plate, 2007) turn on foundational issues\nfor the cognitive sciences generally. They have ceased to be\nspecifically concerned with the explanation of attention.  \nThe view that the function of attention is the management of\nlimitations in the brain’s information processing capacity has\nbeen an orthodox one among psychologists since Donald Broadbent\nintroduced it in the nineteen fifties, but it has sometimes been\ncalled into question. The theories of attention that have been\nproposed by philosophers have tended not to endorse any\nstraightforward version of the capacity-limitation view, and there are\nempirical reasons to think that the simplest versions of such a view\nare mistaken. In the nineteen seventies Ulric Neisser and his\ncollaborators carried out a series of experiments showing that, when\nappropriately trained, a subject can perform two attention-involving\ntasks concurrently, without much interference between them (Hirst\net al., 1980, Neisser, 1976). Neisser interpreted these\nexperiments as suggesting that, insofar as there is a bottleneck that\nattention is needed to manage, it must often be a bottleneck in\nbehavioural coordination, rather than in information processing\ncapacity. Simple bodily limitations are what prevent us from looking\nin two directions at one time, or from throwing a ball and writing\nwith the same hand. Neisser’s suggestion was that in many cases\ncognitive processing was selective, not as a result of limitations in\nprocessing capacity, but only in so far as such bodily limitations\nrequired it to be. \nIn two papers from 1987, authored individually but published in the\nsame volume, Odmar Neumann and Alan Allport developed a similar idea.\nWhereas Neisser emphasized the constraints that are imposed on\ncognition by the need to manage a single body, Neumann and Allport\nboth emphasized the constraints that are placed on cognition by the\nneed to maintain a coherent course of action. They describe their\nposition as a ‘selection-for-action’ theory.  \nIf we think of ‘action’ as here referring to bodily\nbehaviour then the selection-for-action theory is very similar to\nNeisser’s view. But Neumann and Allport’s point retains\nits force if we extend the notion of action to include deliberate\nmental activities, such as puzzle-solving, for which no bodily\nlimitations are in play. There is here an “analogy between\npractical and theoretical and activity”, which was noted in an\n1891 paper by G. F. Stout:  \nAs Stout and the later generations of action-oriented theorists\nindicate, the need to select among several possible sources of\ninformation, and to select among several possible things that might be\ndone with the information that has then been selected, is a\ncharacteristic of almost all deliberately executed thoughts and\nactions, whether those actions are bodily or intellectual. This\nubiquitous need for selectivity has most recently been emphasized in a\nseries of works by Wayne Wu, where it is referred to as the\n“many many problem”(Wu, 2011a, 2014).  \nIn Wu’s handling of it, the idea that Neumann and Allport\nemphasized becomes part of a larger attempt to understand the\nessential connections between attention and agency (Wu, 2011b). For\nWu, attention’s role in action is more fundamental than its role\nin perception. Stout is not the only precedent for this idea. The same\nconnection was noted by William James when he claimed that\n“Volition is nothing but attention.”, (see Section\n 1.5,\n above). As with these earlier authors, Wu’s point is not just\nthat, by treating attention as a purely perceptual phenomenon, we\nignore many of its other instances. Instead Wu wants to suggest that\nany division we might attempt to draw between perceptual attention and\nthe attentional selectivity required by agency would be an artificial\none. Even the involuntary capture of attention by perceptually salient\nstimuli should, Wu thinks, be understood as involving a kind of\nreadiness to act on the things to which we involuntarily attend\n(op cit, §3). Wu’s selection-for-action theory of\nattention is therefore intended as a step towards a unification of our\nphilosophical account of ourselves as agents and our philosophical\naccount of ourselves as perceivers. \nAccording to selection-for-action type views the function of attention\nis not the management of capacity limitations. It is, instead, the\nmanagement of capacity excess. It is because we can process\nmultiple stimuli that we can be distracted by them, and because we can\nbe distracted by them, not because we cannot process them, that we\nneed mechanisms of attention to provide selectivity and focus.\nAttention, on this view, serves to lend coherence to, and to prevent\ninterference between, the activity of several components in a system\nthat has the capacity to handle far more stimuli than those pertaining\nto the subject’s current task. Such a view contrasts sharply\nwith Broadbent’s conception of attentional selectivity as\ncapacity-bottleneck management.  \nIn the tradition that is perpetuated by Wu, the selectivity of\nattention is understood as providing a solution to one particular\nproblem, created by the fact that there are multiple courses of action\nthat might be taken at any time, with the taking of any one of these\nactions requiring the others to be suppressed. The solving of this\nparticular problem is not the only cognitive need that could be served\nby an operation of selectivity, even in a mind without bottlenecks of\nprocessing capacity. The selection-for-action is therefore not the\nonly alternative to Broadbent’s theory. Other functions for\nattentional selectivity might also be proposed.\nAlternatively—rather than electing any one of these functions of\ncognitive selectivity as being the function that is essentially served\nby attention—we might instead characterize attention as a quite\ngeneral process of selectivity, recruitable on any of the various\noccasions when one thing needs to prioritized over another; whether\nthis prioritization is required by the presence of a processing\nbottleneck, required in order for a particular action-plan to be\nexecuted, or required for some quite different reason. The recent work\nof Sebastian Watzl develops the idea that attention might be such a\nnon-specific process of prioritization (Watzl, 2017). \nIn Watzl’s treatment of it, this idea places particular emphasis\non the fact that, just as a binary ‘is greater than’\nrelation can introduce a partial ordering on a set, so a set of binary\nprioritizations can be considered in sum, as introducing a\nprioritization structure on the several items that together constitute\none’s mental life. For Watzl, attention is the process by which\none’s life comes to have such a structure. \nWatzl also claims that a mind which lacked such a structure would\ntherefore be lacking a particular perspective on the world, and so\nwould not be the mind of a creature with the subjective point of view\nthat is characteristic of conscious experiences. From this he derives\nthe claim that every conscious creature is attentive. Carolyn Jennings\nhas suggested that certain kinds of highly engaged expert performance\nmay be a counterexample to this (Jennings, 2015). \nThe idea that there might be reasons for attentional selection that\nhave nothing to do with processing bottlenecks has also been a theme\nin the work of psychologists hoping to understand perception as a\nprocess of Bayesian inference (Friston et al. 2006,\nSummerfield & Egner, 2013), and in the work of those philosophers\nwho have been influenced by them (Hohwy, 2013; Clark, 2013, 2017).\n \nIn what has come to be the most developed version of this Bayesian\napproach to the mind (Hohwy, 2013, Clark, 2013), cognition as a whole\nis understood to be a process of Bayesian updating, in which a\nhierarchically-organized series of hypotheses is constantly being\ntested, with each hypothesis being updated in the light of evidence\ncoming from the level below. Advocates of this theory attempt to find\nroom within this hierarchical framework for all aspects of cognition,\nincluding perception, thought, and action. A central claim of this\ntheory is that the information that gets passed up through this\nhierarchy is encoded in the form of signals representing the\nerrors in the predictions that are made by the hypotheses at\nthe hierarchy’s next level up, with the content of one’s\nexperience at any time being given by whichever hypothesis makes the\nleast erroneous predictions. (Different versions of the theory use\ndifferent techniques to calculate the relative size of these\nprediction errors.) Given their commitment to prediction-error coding,\na central claim of these theories is that the role of our sensory\nencounter with the world is to provide information about the way in\nwhich our prior hypotheses get things wrong: instead of providing us\nwith the information that it has started to rain, our senses provide\nonly the information that it is more rainy than we had expected.  \nAdvocates of this theory claim that it “allows us to see\nattention in a new light and to provide alternative conceptualizations\nof its functional role in our overall mental economy” (Hohwy,\n2014, p. 191). According to these ‘alternative\nconceptions’, attention adjusts the weighting of incoming\nprediction error signals, in accordance with their expected\nprecision (Hohwy, 2012). ‘Precision’ is\nunderstood here in a sense that contrasts precision with accuracy.\n‘Accuracy’, in the intended sense, is a measure of the\ndifference between the value indicated by a signal and the actual\nvalue, whereas ‘precision’ is a measure of the random\nfluctuation in that signal, even when the actual input is held\nconstant. A miscalibrated instrument might, in this sense, be highly\nprecise, without being especially accurate. \nVarious empirical results make it plausible that the brain takes\naccount of expected precisions, when processing perceptual signals. In\nthe ventriloquist illusion, for example, it is plausible that\nexpectations of precision play a role: It is because vision is\nexpected to give a more precise indication of location than audition\nthat sounds are heard to come from the location where their source is\napparently seen. Other considerations make it equally plausible that\nattention plays a role in accommodating the variations in these\nexpected precisions, as we move from one context to another. If we\nexpect that the signal from vision is likely to be a noisy\none—perhaps because a thick fog has started to\ndescend—then we may place more weight than usual on the\ninformation that is present in the signal coming from audition. It\nseems likely that there is a role for attention in bringing about this\nchange of weighting. It is more controversial to claim, as the\nadvocates of this theory do, that “attention is nothing but\nprecision optimization in hierarchical inference.” (Hohwy, 1014,\np.244, citing Feldman & Friston, 2010). Ransom et al.\nhave suggested that, by taking attention always to be\nprecision optimization, this theory struggles to account for certain\nforms of voluntary attention (Ransom et al. 2017).\n Clark has suggested that this challenge can be met if the\nsources of voluntary attention are identified with beliefs, rather\nthan desires (Clark, 2017). \nLike the precision-optimization theories that have been advocated by\nHohwy and Clark, from within the framework of the prediction-error\ncoding theory, the Coherence theories advocated by Neisser, Neumann,\nAllport, and Wu have also suggested that there are functions\nfor attention other than the management of limitations in processing\ncapacity. Despite the availability of these non-Broadbentian\nconceptions of attention’s function, the Broadbentian idea that\nattention’s selectivity serves to manage limitations in\nprocessing capacity continues to be regarded by many psychologists as\nincontrovertible. The claim that “Because the visual system does\nnot have the capacity to process all inputs simultaneously, there must\nexist attentional processes that help the visual system select some\ninputs” continues to be treated as a platitude of the sort that\ncan be used as an uncontroversial opening sentence when introducing\none’s research. (The example just given comes from the beginning\nof Vecera (2000), but many more examples of the same claim can easily\nbe found.)  \nFor those who reject this platitude, and think that the function of\nattention is something other than the management of limitations in\nprocessing capacity, it is natural to think that the\nmechanisms of attentional selection will be something other\nthan capacity bottlenecks.  \nThe clearest non-bottleneck mechanisms for achieving selectivity are\ncompetitions. Since well organized competitions can always\nselect one winner, however good and however numerous the competitors,\nthe selectivity of a competitive mechanism need not have anything to\ndo with bottlenecks, or with any other limitations of processing\ncapacity.  \nCompetition based mechanisms for achieving selectivity come in at\nleast two varieties: In a simple race mechanism each of the\ncompetitors independently completes a process that is comparable,\nalong some dimension of variation, with the processes completed by the\nother competitors. The competitor that achieves the highest value on\nthe relevant dimension of variation is selected as the winner. In a\nstruggle the competitors do not just get on with their own\nprocessing in the hope that they will do it better than each of the\nother competitors. Instead the active suppression of other competitors\nis a part of the process that each competitor carries out. Simple race\nmodels of attention have been proposed (Shibuya and Bundesen, 1988,\nBundesen, 1987) but our best current theories supplement the simple\nrace mechanism with some components of mutual struggle, or with\nadditional processes of top-down control (see Bundesen and Habekost,\n2008).  \nOne suggestion for a supplemented-competition mechanism for\nattentional selectivity is the biased-competition model, elaborated in\nseveral works by Robert Desimone, John Duncan and John Reynolds. The\nbiased-competition model accounts for various attention-involving\neffects, at the personal and at the sub-personal level, as being\neffects that arise from numerous struggles between the different\nstimuli that fall within the variously sized receptive fields of\nneurons throughout the perceptual processing hierarchy. Each one of\nthese struggles is hypothesized as being biased, although not settled\noutright, by a top-down attention-specific signal (Desimone and\nDuncan, 1995, Reynolds and Desimone, 2001). \nWe have said that competitions are selective in ways that do not\ninvolve limitations in capacity, and that competition-based theories\nof attention’s underlying mechanisms are therefore natural\naccompaniments to selection-for-action type views of attention’s\nfunction (Section\n 2.3),\n and perhaps of other views that involve a break from the Broadbentian\nview, according to which the function of attention is the management\nof capacity limitations. Competition views of attention’s\nmechanisms do not, however, require us to take a non-Broadbentian view\nof attention’s function. Although the biased competition view\nsits naturally with a non-Broadbentian view of attention’s\nfunction, Reynolds and Desimone continue to introduce the biased\ncompetition theory as an attempt to understand attention in\nrecognizably Broadbentian terms, writing that: \nSome advocates of the biased competition view emphasize the particular\nimportance of the top-down biasing signals that the theory postulates\n(e.g. Beck and Kastner, 2009, p. 1156), taking the source of\nthese signals to be the true locus of attentional selection. Others\nhave suggested that the biased competition theory is better understood\nas a theory that refuses to identify any such locus, and that it\nshould instead be read (as suggested in Duncan’s original\npresentation of the theory, (Duncan 1996)) as attributing the\nselectivity of attention to the totality of an integrated competition,\ninvolving processes of various sorts at various levels, any part of\nwhich can bias any other (Mole, 2011, §6.7, 2015).  \nWhen it is understood in this second way the biased-competition theory\naccords with the proposal that attention should be taken to have a\nmetaphysical status analogous to that of unison in an orchestra.\nAccording to this view it is always a mistake to identify any one\nprocess as the attention process (or any set of processes as the\nattention processes); attention requires the unified activity of\nwhichever processes happen to be relevant to the subject’s task,\nbut it does not require any particular processes to be taking\nplace. Such a view has been advocated in work by Christopher Mole, who\ndubs it the ‘Cognitive Unison Theory’. Metaphysically\nspeaking, such a theory can be understood as a revival of John Locke\nand F.H. Bradley’s view that attention is a mode of thinking\n(see\n Section 1.3\n above), and phenomenologically the view has a precedent in\nRibot’s suggestion that attention be identified with\n‘monoideism’ (Ribot, 1889, p. 10). It also draws on an\nidea that was sketched in a 1964 monograph by Alan White. \nBecause operating in unison requires an absence of task-irrelevant\nprocessing, the most straightforward version of the unison theory\nentails that attention is a rare achievement, with most cases of\nattentiveness involving what is, strictly speaking, only partial or\ndivided attention. Mole (like Ribot) accepts this implication. Work by\nPhilipp Koralus has suggested that a view along these lines could give\na more satisfactory treatment of divided attention if the attentive\npursuit of a task were understood to share certain formal properties\nwith the answering of a question (Koralus, 2014). This\ncharacterization of attention as “the means by which we answer\nquestions about the environment” has been argued for on\nphenomenological and epistemological grounds, by Naomi Eilan (Eilan,\n1998). (Eilan credits the thought to Rowland Stout, whose treatment of\nit can be found in Chapter 9 §5 of Stout 2006.) Koralus draws on\nHamblin’s 1958 semantics of questions to provide a formal model\nof such questioning (Hamblin, 1958). \nWhereas bottleneck metaphors have traditionally guided the\ntheories that attempt to locate the cognitive resources that operate\nonly on attended stimuli, it has been spotlight metaphors\nthat have guided the theories that attempt to say which features of a\nstimulus determine whether attention is being paid to that stimulus at\nany given moment. The idea suggested by the spotlight metaphor is that\na stimulus’s location ultimately determines whether or\nnot that stimulus receives attention: the point here is not to deny\nthat one can pay attention to something on account of it being\nbrightly coloured, or on account of it being interesting. The point\nis, instead, that one pays attention to brightly coloured things by\ndirecting one’s attention to the location of those things. \nOne can easily see why the spotlight metaphor is appealing. If we are\npresented with an array of differently coloured shapes, appearing and\ndisappearing in various places, then there will be various attention\ndemanding tasks that we might perform regarding that array. Some tasks\nmight require us to attend to whatever is going on at the top of the\nscreen, others might require us to attend to all the red shapes, or to\nall the triangles, or to something else. Some of these ways of\nattending seem to be more basic than others. It seems, for example,\nthat attending to things in the top part of the screen might be a\nprimitive task, whereas attending to the triangles could not be\nprimitive in the same way: we cannot simply attend to the\ntriangles. If we want to attend to the triangles, we need first to\nwork out where the triangles are. If, on the other hand, we\nwant to attend to the things in the top part of the screen we do not\nneed to work out whether they are triangles. It is therefore plausible\nthat when we attend to the triangles we do so by attending to\ntheir locations. In this sense attending on the basis of location\nseems to be more basic than attending on the basis of shape. \nThe idea that attending to a location is more basic than attending to\na shape might tempt one to think that attending on the basis of\nlocation is absolutely basic, so that attention is always and only\nallocated on the basis of location. If that were right then a theory\nof the spatial allocation of attention—a theory about the moving\nand focusing of an ‘attentional spotlight’—would be\na large and central component in an account of how attention works.\nThis would be good news for those who want to give a single unified\ntheory of attention, and it would be good news for the scientific\nproject of explaining attention more generally, since\nattention’s spotlight-like behaviours are some of its best\nunderstood aspects (see Logan, 1996). \nThere are reasons to think that location does play a special role in\nthe allocation of attention, as the spotlight metaphor suggests. But\nthe role of location in the allocation of attention is probably not as\nstraightforward as would be required by the most parsimonious of\nspotlight-based theories. Location does have a special role to play in\nthe allocation of attention, but (1) location is not the only property\nto have such a role, and (2) the role of location is more complicated\nthan a simple spotlight metaphor suggests. \nEmpirical debates about the direction of the spotlight of attention\nhave focussed mostly on the second of these points. An important\nsource of data here is case studies contrasting the different patterns\nof attention failure that are shown by different unilateral neglect\npatients. Such studies suggest that various frames of reference are\ninvolved in the spatial allocation of attention (Behrmann and Tipper,\n1999). This indicates that there is no single map of\nlocations determining which items get attention: attention is\nsometimes allocated on the basis of location in egocentric space,\nsometimes on the basis of location in more complex frames of reference\n(a point that was among those raised by Allport, in his influential\ncritique of the Broadbentian debates (see Allport, 1992, p. 197)). \nThere are also some well-known experimental effects suggesting that\nattention is allocated, not on the basis of straightforward spatial\ncoordinates, but in ways that are constrained by the distribution of\nobjects in space. The classic work in this area is John\nDuncan’s demonstration that attention shifts more readily\nbetween two locations that fall within the bounds of a single object\nthan between equidistant locations that are separated by an object\nboundary (Duncan, 1984). Equally important here are findings from\nexperiments using three-dimensional stimuli, and using virtual\nthree-dimensional displays. These studies suggest that subjects are\nunable to differentially attend to depths in an empty space, but that\nsubjects can shift their attention forwards and backward (to a place\nin front of or behind the point that their eyes are fixating) when the\nrelevant locations are ones in which there are objects (see Yantis,\n1998).  \nThese converging sources of data indicate that the spotlight of\nattention is not allocated simply on the basis of coordinates in any\nsingle spatial frame of reference. That is an important finding for\nthose attempting to localize mechanisms for the allocation of\nattention within the brain (since different brain areas differ in\ntheir mapping of space, and in their representation of spatial\ninformation about the objects within it). It has been influential in\nleading psychologists to turn away from simple spotlight metaphors. It\nshould be noted, however, that these findings do not threaten the core\nof the idea that was suggested by the spotlight metaphor: The facts\nabout what a person is attending to might still supervene on the facts\nabout where that person is attending, even if quite numerous\nand sometimes complex factors are responsible for determining which\nlocation that is. \nOther effects are somewhat more damaging for a pure spotlight view,\nalthough they stop short of refuting it entirely. The\nmore-than-merely-spatial complexity of the way in which attention is\nallocated has been nicely demonstrated in a series of experiments by\nDwight Kravitz and Marlene Behrmann (Kravitz and Behrmann, 2011). The\nsubjects in these experiments have their attention cued by a brief\nstimulus that is presented at one end of a shape that is shown on a\ncomputer screen. This shape might be a simple rectangle, a rectangle\nwith bulbous ends, or a more complex ‘H’ or\n‘h’ shape. It is presented alongside another shape, which\nin some cases has the same shape and colour, and in some cases is\ndifferent. The resulting allocation of attention is then probed by\nmeasuring the reaction times to stimuli that are presented on and near\nthese objects. Kravitz and Behrmann find that all the different\nproperties of their stimuli interact to determine the way in\nwhich attention is allocated to the screen on which these stimuli\nappear. Most strikingly of all, they find a difference in the\nallocation of attention between the case in which the shapes on the\nscreen are an upper and a lower case ‘H’, and the case in\nwhich the shapes are an upper case H and number 4, even though this\nnumber 4 shape is exactly the same as the lower case h, but presented\nupside down. Such findings suggest that attention, even when triggered\nby a simple spatial cue, is not allocated merely on the basis of\nlocation, but also on the basis of shape, colour, and arbitrary\nlearned meaning.  \nThe discovery that attention can preferentially modulate the\nprocessing of stimuli on account of their colours, shapes, and\nmeanings does not prevent us from maintaining that the location of a\nstimulus has a special role to play in the process by which attention\nis allocated to it. More than one line of research in psychology has\nsought to identify some one representation in the brain in which items\nare encoded in a way that determines the extent to which attention\nwill be allocated to them. In the longest established of these lines\nof research—beginning with the work of Koch and Ullman\n(1985)—this representation has been taken to be a map,\nin some quite literal sense of ‘map’: the representation\nis taken to be one in which every location in some region is\nrepresented, and the representation of these locations is taken to be\nin some format that immediately encodes the spatial relations between\nthem. Every object that is represented is taken to represented as\nbeing at some location, and the properties assigned to these located\nobjects are taken to determine the likelihood that attention will be\npaid to the location that the objects occupy. According to the theory\nthat postulates these ‘salience maps’, location does play\na unique role in determining the way in which attention is allocated,\ndespite the fact that other properties contribute to that allocation.\n \nIn more recent treatments of this idea (Pessoa, 2013) such maps are\ntaken to include representations, not merely of the objective\nproperties that give an item salience, but also of subjective\nproperties, such as emotional-valence and\ncurrent-motivational-relevance. The more we think of these maps as\nbeing augmented with additional, non-spatial information, the less\nspotlight-like the allocation of attention represented in them will\nseem to be, but, provided the representation in question is still\nunderstood to be map-like, location can still be understood to have an\nimportant role (and perhaps even a uniquely important one).  \nDebates about the role of such maps, and about the variety of\nsubjective and objective properties that are represented within them,\nmay have some wide-ranging philosophical consequences, concerning more\nthan just the aptness of the spotlight metaphor. Aaron Henry has\nsuggested that the viability of some recent philosophical theories\ndepends on the outcome of these debates. Since the recent\nphilosophical theories of attention have tended to emphasize the role\nof agency in attention, they face potential counterexamples from\ninstances of involuntary attention. Henry suggests that the threat of\nsuch counterexamples can be defused if the mechanisms of involuntary\nattention capture are understood to involve attention being allocated\non the basis of a map in which the agent’s priorities for action\nare represented (Henry, 2017). \nAlthough the psychological debates about salience maps are ongoing, an\nargument against pure spotlight views can also be made on more\ntraditional, phenomenological grounds. A pure spotlight theory,\naccording to which attention is always allocated on the basis of\nlocation, seems unable to account for the sort of case that Hermann\nvon Helmholtz and William James were concerned with (see section\n 1.5).\n There is, as their example suggests, a difference between attending\nto the pitch of a note and attending to its timbre, or to its\novertones. This difference in attention does not seem to correspond to\na difference in the location attended. Nor does a purely location\nbased theory of attention allocation seem able to account for the sort\nattention that one must pay in order to perform a time-based task,\nsuch as finding out which of a group of shapes appears on screen for\nlongest. Such temporal aspects of attention have tended to be\nneglected, but they are emerging as an important topic in psychology\n(see the papers collected in Nobre and Coull, 2010). Some\nphilosophical work has been devoted to their exploration (see\nPhillips, 2011). \nSince some shifts of attention are not shifts in the location\nattended, a theory of the factors that determine which locations a\nsubject is attending to cannot tell us the whole story about the\nallocation of attention. It might nonetheless be a central component\nin a theory of some of attention’s forms (see Wright and Ward,\n2008). \nWork in which electrodes are used in vivo to stimulate areas\nof the macaque brain known to be associated with eye-movement\ncoordination has provided compelling evidence for the existence of an\nanatomical overlap between brain areas involved in eye-movement\ncontrol and those involved in determining which stimuli elicit the\nstrongest responses in visual cortex. There is evidence that this\nanatomical fact has some functional significance. One suggestive\nfinding is that the links between frontal eye-movement control areas\nand attention-like effects in occipital visual areas are spatially\nspecific: An electrode that is placed so that it elicits an eye\nmovement to a particular part of the visual field when activated at\none level will, if activated at a lower level, elicit changes in\nneural responsiveness that are exactly similar to the changes seen\nwhen attention is shifted to that same location (Moore and Armstrong,\n2003, Armstrong and Moore, 2007). \nThese facts are suggestive of a ‘motor theory’ of\nattention, according to which the processes underpinning attention\nare, in at least some cases, truncated versions of the processes\nunderpinning the coordination of movements of sensory orientation. \nThe central idea of such a motor theory is that “the program for\norienting attention either overtly or covertly is the same, but in the\nlatter case the eyes are blocked at a certain peripheral stage”\n(Rizzolatti et al, 1987, 37).  Advocates of motor\ntheories (such as Moore, Armstrong and Fallah, 2003) have\ncharacterised their work as a revival of the picture that Alexander\nBain proposed at the end of the nineteenth century. Bain (as we saw in\nSection\n 1.5,\n above) identified attention with truncated versions of the\nmotor-control processes that typically bring about attention’s\nbehavioural manifestations — processes “stopping short of\nthe actual movement performed by the organ” (Bain, 1888,\n371). \nThese versions of the motor theory should be distinguished from\ntheories that regard attention and motor control as intimately linked,\nbut that place no emphasis on the fact that the motor control\nprocesses that have been implicated in attention are processes that\ncontrol the movement of sensory organs. In these theories\n(which are natural but not obligatory concomitants of the\n‘selection-for-action’ views discussed in\n section 2.5)\n attention stands in an intimate relation to motor control more\ngenerally. One line of experimental evidence in support of such a\nconnection comes from work by Heiner Deubel and his collaborators, in\nwhich various changes to the way in which an object figures in action\nare shown to have an attention-indicating influence on the perceptual\ndiscrimination of stimuli that are presented on or near that object.\nIn one striking example of this Deubel and Schneider found that the\nway in which attention is allocated to the space around a 6.5cm wooden\nX shape depended on whether the subject was reaching with her left\nhand to grasp the shape by the top-left and bottom right arms, or\nreaching with her right hand to grasp the shape by the arms at its\ntop-right and bottom left (Deubel & Schneider, 2004). In each case\nattention was allocated not only to the shape, but to the\nto-be-gripped parts of it. For other evidence of interactions between\nattention and action-targeting, see (Tipper, Howard, and Houghton,\n1998).  \nMotor theories and other action-based theories give a plausible\naccount of some of attention’s instances, but they have\nlimitations that prevent them form applying with full generality:\nSince movement of the eyes, or of the limbs, is always movement to\na location motor theories will struggle to account for the\nallocation of attention on the basis of anything other than location.\nThey therefore face the limitations that we saw when considering pure\nspotlight theories, of being unable to account for shifts in attention\nthat do not correspond to differences in the location attended. Nor is\nit clear how motor theories should be applied to spatial attention in\nthose sensory modalities where the orientation of the sense organs is\nless straightforward than it is in the visual case. The motor theory\ndoes, nonetheless, provide a plausible and well-supported account of\nthe location based variety of visual attention displayed in typical\nattention-lab experiments.  \nThe success of motor theories in accounting for the sorts of attention\nthat are found in some typical attention-lab experiments can be given\neither an optimistic or a pesimistic interpretation. The optimistic\ninterpretation sees the motor theory as providing a successful account\nof the processing underpinning some of attention’s simpler and\nmore central varieties. The pessimistic interpretation sees the motor\ntheory as revealing a problem with our usual experimental paradigms.\nIn typical laboratory tasks subjects direct their attention to\ndifferent parts of their visual field while keeping their eyes fixated\non a central spot. The behavioural signatures of attention in such\ntasks are usually reductions in reaction time to the attended stimuli.\nThe neural correlates of these behavioural signatures are certain\nbiases as to which stimuli most strongly drive the neural circuitry\nthat processes them. The central finding of the motor-theorists is\nthat these neural and behavioural effects can result from attenuated\nversions of the activity responsible for directing eye movements. The\npessimistic interpretation of this finding is as revealing that the\nsigns that were traditionally taken to indicate the direction of\nattention are actually no more than consequences of the truncated\neye-movements that our experimental paradigms induce. If that is right\nthen the phenomenon studied in attention labs may not be the\npsychologically important one that it has been taken for. \nThe question of whether attention is necessary for consciousness can\nbe answered in various ways. One answer is given by those who think\nthat lots of unattended items appear in consciousness. A different\nanswer is given by those who think that only some unattended items\nfigure in consciousness. A third answer is given if we think that\nunattended items figure in consciousness only in special\ncircumstances. There is some evidence that, independently of any\nphilosophical commitments, people differ as to which of these views\nthey find plausible (Schwitzgebel, 2007). There are also views in\nwhich attention is necessary for consciousness in the sense that every\nconscious creature must be an attentive one. Such views need not\nentail that attention to an object is necessary for consciousness of\nthat object. \nAt one extreme end of this spectrum is the view according to which\nattention is strictly necessary for consciousness, so that the things\nto which we are not paying attention do not figure in our\nconsciousness at all. A number of psychologists endorse this view\n(e.g. Cohen et al. 2012), as do some philosophers (e.g.\nPrinz, 2012, Carruthers, 2015, Montemayor & Haladjian, 2015).\nThere is some historical precedent for this view in James’s\nremark, at the beginning of his chapter on attention, that “my\nexperience is what I agree to attend to”(James, 1890, ch. 11),\nand in Kames’ remark that “Attention is requisite even to\nthe simple act of seeing” (see Sect\n 1.4,\n above). \nThe evidence that is proffered in support of the view that attention\nis strictly necessary for consciousness comes from a range of\nexperiments showing the surprising extent to which subjects are\nignorant of the items to which they have paid no attention. In Mack\nand Rock’s ‘inattentional blindness’ paradigm, for\nexample, subjects who are given an attention demanding task pertaining\nto a stimulus in one part of the visual field frequently fail to\nnotice shapes or words that are flashed up elsewhere (Mack & Rock,\n1998). In Rensink et al.’s ‘change\nblindness’ paradigm subjects need to see an alternating pair of\npictures between ten and twenty times before they can identify a large\nbut narratively inconsequential difference between them (Rensink\net al., 1997, Rensink, 2002). In the most memorable of these\nexperiments a large number of subjects fail to notice the central\nappearance of a man in a gorilla suit when their attention is taken up\nwith the business of counting the number of passes made by one of two\nteams in a concurrent basketball-type game (Simons & Chabdris,\n1999). \nNo single one of these experiments can establish the claim that\nattention is always necessary for consciousness—that claim is a\nuniversally quantified one, and is not entailed by any one of its\ninstances. Nor is it clear that what we see in these experiments\nreally are instances in which unattended objects drop out of\nconsciousness altogether. The subject’s ignorance of the\ngorilla’s appearance, for example, is compatible with its being\nthe case that the presence of the gorilla does make a\nphenomenal difference for the inattentive subject. To explain the\nsubject’s ignorance we need only say that any phenomenal\ndifference that the unattended gorilla makes is a difference that the\nsubject is unable to use in answering the experimenter’s\nquestion about whether anything strange happened in the scene. It may\nbe that it is a phenomenal difference that is epistemically unusable\nbecause it is immediately forgotten (see Wolfe, 1998) or it may,\nalternatively, be a difference that is unusable because it is too\nunstructured and inchoate to be epistemically mobilizable. In that\ncase the effect of inattention would be inattentional\nagnosia, rather than inattentional blindness (see\nSimons, 2000). \nAbsolute amnesia for unattended items, or thoroughgoing agnosia for\nthem, may be indistinguishable from inattentional blindness, both\nbehaviourally and from the point of view of retrospective\nintrospection. For that reason it is not a straightforward matter for\nthe advocates of any of these interpretations of the inattentional\nblindness and change blindness effects to rule out the alternative\ninterpretations. Subpersonal sources of data (such as experiments\nusing neuroimaging) may be the only sources of data that we have to go\non. (See Rees, et al. 1999 for an example in which fMRI data\nis used to argue against the amnesia interpretation of inattentional\nblindness effects involving written words). \nIt is only narratively insignificant differences that go unnoticed in\nthe change-blindness paradigm. The change blindness effects might\ntherefore be taken as showing, not that there is no consciousness in\nthe absence of attention, but that there is consciousness in\nthe absence of attention, the contents of which are restricted to the\nscene’s overall gist. There are difficulties in adjudicating\nbetween these two interpretations experimentally. When the features of\ngist do seem to be perceived, in the apparent absence of attention,\nthe defender of the claim that attention is necessary for\nconsciousness may reply by claiming that attention is paid to\nthese items, either in a dispersed, non-focal way (Prettyman, 2013),\nor because these features are briefly and involuntarily\nattention-catching (Prinz, 2012, p. 119). Without an experimental\noperationalization of complete inattention, these rival\ninterpretations cannot be ruled out, with the result that empirical\ndebates about the extent of consciousness beyond attention are\ncurrently in something of deadlock, with experimenters being able to\nclaim only to have demonstrated perception in the ‘near\nabsence’ of attention (Li et al., 2002, Reddy et\nal., 2004, Reddy et al., 2006), and so providing only weak\nsupport to the hypothesis that attention and consciousness are\ndissociable (Koch & Tsuchiya, 2007). \nThe methodological puzzle that we face when trying to settle the\ndispute between different interpretations of the inattentional\nblindness effects raises the question of whether our commonsense\nbeliefs about the conscious status of unattended items are well\nfounded. Such beliefs seem to vary from person to person\n(Schwitzgebel, 2007), and to vary with certain features of the context\nin which they are probed (De Brigard, 2010). To the extent that we\nfind it natural to suppose that unattended items do figure in\nconsciousness, this may simply being owing to a version of the\n‘refrigerator-light illusion’: If our reason for believing\nthat we are conscious of the things to which we pay no attention is a\nreason that depends on our finding that we are conscious of those\nthings whenever we check on them, then that belief is on shaky ground.\nA checking procedure cannot provide us with good evidence about the\nstatus of unattended items since the act of checking is itself an act\nthat involves a shift in attention to the things checked. \nSince a direct checking procedure is ruled out we need a more\ntheory-driven way of assessing the dispute between those who claim\nthat the consequence of not attending to an item is that the item\ndrops out of conscious experience and those who claim that inattention\nsimply puts the subject in a poor epistemic position vis-à-vis\nthe unattended items. The current state of our theories is such that\nit would be premature to try to settle this dispute by an inference to\nthe best explanation since neither side of the dispute has a theory of\nthe attention/consciousness relation that has been worked out to a\ndegree that would allow the different explanations to be compared. We\ncan, however, see some of the considerations that the two sides in\nthis debate might invoke. Those who endorse the idea that attention is\nnecessary for consciousness can point to the fact that this view\naccords well with theories in which attention features prominently in\nthe explanation of consciousness (e.g. Prinz, 2005, 2012). They may\nalso be able to develop arguments based on theories of the way in\nwhich consciousness and attention evolved (Montemayor & Haladjian,\n2015). Those who prefer the epistemic-deficit interpretation of the\ninattentional blindness effects (Mole, 2011, §7.3.7) can point to\nthe fact that that interpretation flows naturally from the view\naccording to which attention to an item provides the sort of\nacquaintance that is needed for the use of a demonstrative concept\nthat refers to that item (a view advocated by Campbell, 2002, and\ndiscussed in section\n 3.2\n below): If attention to the gorilla is necessary for the forming of a\ndemonstrative-involving thought (such as ‘That’s a\ngorilla’) then there is an immediate explanation, consistent\nwith the idea that unattended items nonetheless feature in the\nsubject’s consciousness, for the fact that inattentive subjects\nare unable to answer questions such as ‘Was there a\ngorilla?’.  \nThe difficulty in the case of the unnoticed gorilla is to discern\nwhether unattended items are present to consciousness, but not as\nindividuated items to which a demonstrative reference could be\ndirected, or whether those unattended items are instead absent from\nconsciousness altogether. Part of this difficulty originates in the\nfact that, although most people give no attention to the gorilla, they\ncould attend to him, and would have done so if anything had prompted\nthem to do so. More data may be available, both to introspection and\nto laboratory measurement, in cases where our failure to attend has\nsome more systemic explanation. Ned Block has suggested that one such\ncase is found in our perception of peripheral stimuli, when these are\nsubject to the phenomenon of ‘identity crowding’ (Block,\n2013a). An individual ‘T’ or ‘F’ can be seen\nreasonably clearly, even when presented in a peripheral part of the\nvisual field. But if additional characters are presented alongside\nthis individual character, then the properties of these charaacters\nare prone to perceptul confusion. Attention seems to bind together\nproperties from all of the characters in the vicinity of the one\nindividual that we are trying to pick out. It therefore seems that, in\nthe perceptual periphery, attention cannot be directed onto a region\nthat fits an individual character tightly. Due to this\n‘crowding’ effect, individual letters or shapes become\nimpossible to individuate from the others with which they are\nclustered, when they fall in parts of the visual field that are\noutside of the high-definition centre. The properties of objects that\nare crowded in this way can nonetheless be seen, and the fact that\nseveral items are present can be reliably reported. On the basis of\nempirical and introspective considerations, Block claims that, even in\ncases where the crowded characters share all of their features with\nthe others by which they are crowded, these crowded characters are\nconsciously discriminated from their surroundings. He claims that\nthese characters figure as objects in consciousness. Since attention\ncannot be allocated to anything more fine-grained than the crowd of\nwhich these characters are a part, these characters are not objects to\nwhich attention is paid. Block therefore takes ‘identity\ncrowding’ to give counterexamples to the claim that we are\nconscious of objects only when paying attention to them.  \nHis claim that the crowded character figures in consciousness as an\nindividuated objects, rather than as a part of some feature-rich\ntexture, has been contested (Taylor, 2013, Richards, 2013). In\nresponse, Block has suggested that an inference the best explanation\nof several related phenomena favours his interpretation of the effect\n(Block, 2013b). \nInference to the best explanation is always a hazardous business,\nespecially in the vicinity of an explantory gap. In the interpretation\nof identity crowding, as in the interpretation of inattentional\nblindness, the inescapability of abductive considerations suggests\nthat our answer to the question about whether attention is necessary\nfor consciousness may have to wait until we have a better\nunderstanding of the relation of attention to demonstrative reference\n(of the sort that is involved in thinking ‘That’s a\ngorilla’), and of attention’s role in epistemology more\ngenerally. \nIn addition to disputes about whether we are conscious of\nonly those things to which we attend there are also disputes\nabout whether we are conscious of everything to which we\nattend. If we were then a complete theory of attention might be given\nby giving an account of the way in which attention modulates\nconsciousness. \nDeclan Smithies has argued in favour of a position according to which\neverything that is attended to is consciously attended to. He claims\nthat all instances of attention must be consciousness-involving, on\nthe grounds that (1) all such instances must have a connection with\ntheir subject’s ‘rational-access’ to the contents of\nher experience, and (2) there is no connection to rationality in the\ncase of processing that is wholly unconscious. Smithies’ view\nis, therefore, that attention is essentially involved in the\n‘rational-access’ of consciously experienced contents\n(Smithies, 2011). The nature of any such connection between attention\nto experience and the justificatory force of that experience is itself\na source of ongoing controversy: Johannes Roesller has argued that\nMcDowell’s theory of perceptual experience’s reason-giving\nforce cannot account for the role played by attention in experience\n(Roessler, 2011); Susanna Siegel and Nicholas Silins have claimed that\nthe doxastic influence of an experience can be an instance of rational\naccess even when the experience is not attended (Siegel & Silins,\n2014); Terry Horgan and Matjaž Potrč have argued that the\njustification of beliefs by experience must outrun both the contents\nof attention and the contents of consciousness (Horgan and Potrč\n2011). Here, as above, one’s understanding of attention and\none’s understanding of epistemology constrain one another, and\nmay provide a theory-driven route to theses about the possibility of\nunconscious attentiveness. \nThe claim that all attention is conscious attention sits uneasily with\ncertain empirical results indicating that those psychological\nprocesses that are responsible for the effects that are usually taken\nto be signatures of attention are processes that do not require\nconsciousness for their operation. In an experiment by Yi Jiang et\nal., (2006), for example, subjects are presented with\nattention-attracting stimuli in such a way that, thanks to an\narrangement of mirrors, these stimuli are given to just one eye.\nBecause a more vivid stimulus is presented to the other eye, and\nbecause this more vivid stimulus wins the competition for\nconsciousness that occurs in such cases of binocular rivalry, subjects\ndo not consciously experience the less vivid stimulus. The\nunconsciously processed stimuli in these experiments include erotic\nphotographs. These unseen erotic photographs do seem to elicit shifts\nof attention, as evidenced by the fact that the consciously\nexperienced stimuli presented in the same location as these unseen\nattention-grabbers are more accurately responded to in an attention\ndemanding task (involving detecting the orientation of gabor-patches).\nOne striking finding from Jiang et al.’s experiments is\nthat the way in which the unseen photographs attract and repel the\nattention depends on the sexual orientation of the experimental\nparticipants.  \nA natural interpretation of these experiments is as showing that the\nerotic pictures capture the subject’s attention, despite the\nfact that the subject has no conscious experience of them. This\nsuggests—although it does not conclusively demonstrate\n—that one may be attending to a thing without being conscious of\nit. The same conclusion is suggested by a quite different set of\nexperiments involving blindsighted subjects. In these experiments we\nsee that, even though the blindsighted subject has no experience of\ncues presented in his scotoma, those cues can elicit the same\nfacilitation of processing and reduction of reaction times that are\nusually taken to be the signatures of attention (Kentridge &\nHeywood, 2001, Kentridge et al., 2004).  \nOne complaint against both these lines of evidence is that they do not\nenable us to distinguish between attention to a thing and attention\nthat is merely directed to a part of space, and so cannot demonstrate\nattention to a thing in the absence of consciousness of it\n(Mole, 2008a). Research by Liam Norman, Charles Heywood and Robert\nKentridge goes some way to addressing this complaint. Norman, Heywood\nand Kentridge present normal subjects with a screen showing an array\nof small, rapidly flickering Gabor patches. Objects the boundaries of\nwhich were defined by changes in the orientations of these patches are\nnot consciously experienced: Subjects merely see the whole screen as a\nflickering array of patches. Cues that direct the attention of these\nsubjects nonetheless do seem to draw attention to these unseen\nobjects, as indicated by differences in the response times to items\nthat are subsequently presented in and outside of their boundaries\n(Norman, Heywood & Kentridge, 2013). \nSuch experiments show that there is an influence operating between\nunconscious processing and the direction of attention, and perhaps\nindicate that attention can be paid to objects that make no showing in\nconscious experience (Mole, 2014a). They therefore place a limit on\nthe closeness of the relationship that can be claimed to exist between\nattention and consciousness.  \nThe disputes about whether attention is sufficient for consciousness,\nnecessary for consciousness, or both, are related to questions about\nattention’s metaphysics. The claim that attention is not\nsufficient for consciousness is typically made as part of a defence of\nthe idea that attention and consciousness are underpinned by two\ndistinct brain processes (see, e.g., Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007). The\nclaim that attention is sufficient for consciousness but not necessary\nfor it is required by those who, like Locke (see Section\n 1.3),\n think that attention is a mode of conscious thinking without any\nparticular process that serves as its underpinning. The claim that\nattention is sufficient for consciousness and necessary for it is\nrequired by those who think that the process by which things come to\nconsciousness is identical to the process by which attention is\nallocated (Prinz, 2005, 2011).  \nWhether or not one thinks that attention is always responsible for\nbringing things into our consciousness, there are good reasons to\nthink that changes in the direction of our attention can make some\ndifference to the character of conscious experience. Phenomenologists\nand Gestalt psychologists have characterized this difference in\nvarious ways, with Maurice Merleau-Ponty emphasizing the way in which\nattention can configure the figure ground structure of space\n(Merleau-Ponty, 1962, Chp.3–4), and Aron Gurwitsch (Gurwitsch,\n1964) elaborating a theory in which the configuration given by\nattention has a more complex, three-part structure (explained in\nArvidson, 2006). In the second half of his 2017 book, Sebastian Watzl\ndevelops a similar suggestion, on the basis of his claim that the role\nof attention is to impose a priority structure on our mental lives\n(see above\n §2.4),\n (Watzl, 2011, 2017). \nThere is currently some dispute about whether the differences made by\nshifts of attention can be adequately characterized as differences in\nthe content of the attended experience. If, as Watzl\ncontends, they cannot, then phenomena of attention create a serious\ndifficulty for any fully general attempts to explain the character of\nconscious experience by reference to the contents represented in it\n(Chalmers, 2004), although such explanations might still be viable in\ncircumscribed domains (Speaks, 2010). \nA series of studies by Marisa Carrasco and her collaborators have\nexamined the influence of attention on the character of conscious\nexperience. These have revealed that the phenomenal differences\nproduced by shifts of attention include differences of perceived\nbrightness, contrast, and saturation of colours, but do not include\ndifferences of hue (Carrasco, Ling & Read, 2004, Fuller &\nCarrasco, 2006). Ned Block has suggested that these perceived\ndifferences should not be thought of as differences in the\ncontent of experience, since to characterize them in that way\nwould be to take it that attending to an item creates an illusion as\nto its brightness, contrast, etc.; a result which he takes to be\nimplausible. He therefore takes Carrasco’s findings as\nindicating an aspect of experience that cannot be accounted for with a\ntheory of that experience’s content (Block 2010).  \nThere have been similar disputes, transacted on the basis of more\nintrospective considerations, concerning the effects of attention on\nthe perception of ambiguous figures. In response to some\nconsiderations that were first raised by Fiona Macpherson (Macpherson,\n2006), Bence Nanay has suggested that the effects of attention on the\nperception of such figures can be explained by those who maintain that\nevery difference in consciousness is a difference of content (Nanay,\n2010, 2011). His contention is that the effects of attention on the\ncharacter of conscious experience be understood as including a\nmodulation of the specificity of an experience’s content, in\nwhich the representations of determinable properties are made more or\nless determinate. The issues here are similar to those concerning the\nway in which blur should be thought to enter into visual experience\n(see “Representational Theories of Conciousness” esp.\n §4.4). \nConsciousness is one philosophically puzzling mental phenomenon that\nhas been thought to be related to attention in ways that may prove to\nbe explanatorily revealing. Demonstrative reference is\nanother. One advocate of the idea that attention contributes to the\nexplanation of demonstrative reference is John Campbell, who writes\nthat:  \nA similar idea was explored in the manuscript on Theory of Knowledge\nthat Bertrand Russell abandoned (under the influence of Wittgenstein)\nin the summer in 1913. In that work Russell gives the following\nstatement of the idea that reference to particulars requires attention\nto them:  \nIn support of the Russellian claim that there is an explanatory\nrelation between attention and demonstrative reference, Campbell\ndevelops two lines of thought. \nThe first line of thought comes from reflection on examples concerning\nthe requirements that have to be met in order to understand\ndemonstrative expressions in conversational contexts where one of the\nparticipants in the conversation uses expressions such as ‘that\nwoman’, but where various women are present, all of whom are\npossible referents for this demonstrative. Knowing which women is\nmeant, according to Campbell, requires attending to the woman in\nquestion and knowing that it is to her that the speaker was attending.\nThis is intended to show more than just that the direction of the\nspeaker’s attention is a possible source of evidence for what\nthat speaker means. It is intended as showing that attention and\nreference stand in a particularly intimate relationship—a\nrelationship that Campbell characterizes by saying that\n‘knowledge of the reference of a demonstrative is provided by\nconscious attention to the object’ (p. 22). \nThe second line of thought that Campbell develops in support of the\nview that attention explains demonstrative reference is a line of\nthought pertaining to deductive arguments in which the premises refer\nto items that are picked out by demonstratives: Arguments such as\n‘(1) That is F. (2) That is G. Therefore (3) That is F and\nG’. Campbell’s thought here is that such arguments depend\nfor their validity on there being no possibility of equivocating on\nthe meaning of ‘that’, as it occurs in the two separate\npremises. Such arguments can only figure in rationally-entitling\nreasoning so long as there is a single fixing of the referent of\n‘that’ in both premises. This reference fixing, Campbell\nthinks, is achieved if and only if there is no redirection of\nattention between the premises. Again this is intended to show more\nthan just that there is some causal or evidential relation between\nattending and referring. It is intended to show that the role played\nby attention in fixing the reference of a demonstrative is analogous\nto the role played by a Fregean Sense in fixing the reference of a\nproper name (Campbell, 2002, Chapter 5). \nThe explanatory approach that Campbell advocates, and that Russell\nconsidered, has traditionally been thought to suffer from a problem of\ncircularity. This problem was urged by Peter Geach in Mental\nActs (1957). Geach considers the suggestion that we can use\nattention to explain our ability to make reference to the things that\nwe perceive, but thinks that no such suggestion can provide a genuine\nexplanation of reference because: \nGeach’s threat of circularity can be avoided if an independently\ngiven theory of how attention is constituted can be shown to\nilluminate the way in which reference is fixed by it. Imogen Dickie\nhas attempted to show just this. In a 2011 paper Dickie shows that\ncognitive psychology provides us with a theory of the role played by\nattention in tracking objects over time. She suggests that such a\ntheory can be used to account for the way in which attending to an\nobject removes any knowledge-defeating component of luck from our\ninferences involving it, and so establishes the attended object as a\npossible topic of demonstrative thoughts (Dickie, 2011, 2015). This\ntreatment of attention exemplifies some of the central themes in\nDickie’s more general attempt to explain how thoughts come to be\nabout ordinary objects (and so how singular terms come to refer to\nthose objects). The explanation that she offers is one in which a\nthought comes to be about a thing when the justificatory practices in\nwhich that thought figures are anchored to the object in question (in\na sense of ‘anchoring’ that Dickie spells out in detail\n(Dickie, 2015)).  \nWhether or not a theory of attention can be turned into a non-circular\nexplanation of reference, the idea that attention and reference are\nrelated does seem to be an idea that casts light on what goes on when\nwe understand referring expressions. Campbell’s examples suggest\nthat what we attend to and what we refer to are often the same, and\nthere is some empirical evidence, coming from developmental\npsychology, indicating that attention-related abilities play a crucial\nrole in the infant’s development of an understanding of its\ncaregiver’s demonstrative use (see\n Section3.3).\n The lesson that has been drawn from this work in developmental\npsychology is not only about the comprehension of linguistic\nexpressions.  It is also a lesson about our grasp on directly\nreferring thoughts. The idea – here as in the work of Dickie and\nCampbell – is not only that attention contributes to our\nproduction and comprehension of linguistic expressions that have\nparticular referents, but that it also contributes to the\nestablishment of those referents as the contents of our thoughts.  \nThere are empirical results, coming from developmental psychology,\nwhich are suggestive of an intimate link between the development of\nvarious abilities related to attention and the development of various\ncapacities that are involved in understanding the mental states that\nare being expressed in interactions between the infant and caregiver.\n \nAn ability to appreciate what others are attending to appears to be a\ncrucial stage in the normal infant’s development towards\nunderstanding of the fact that its caregivers’ utterances have\nreferential intentions behind them. More generally, the development of\ncapacities for attention are important milestones in some\ndistinctively human aspects of infant development (Moore and Dunham,\n1995). There is a distinctive developmental pathway in which normal\nhuman infants develop an ability and a willingness to attend to the\nmother, an ability and willingness to attend to the thing that she is\nattending to, and then, most importantly, an ability and willingness\nto enter into episodes in which there is a third object that mother\nand child are attending to jointly, with mutual understanding\nof the fact that their attention is shared (Reddy, 2010, Trevarthen,\n2011). In these episodes infants and caregivers employ complex cues,\ninvolving speech, gaze-following, and pointing. \nThere is good evidence that the child’s progression along this\npathway is intimately related to the develop of abilities to respond\nappropriately to the mental states of others, and to the development\nof the ability to acquire new vocabulary on the basis of an\nunderstanding of what the words used by its mother refer to. A recent\nlongitudinal study suggests that the earlier stages in this pathway\nare predictive of the age at which infants reach the later ones\n– thereby providing some evidence for the hypothesis that this\nsequence is a causal one – with the mastery at 12 months of\npointing as a means to direct the attention of others being predictive\nof false belief understanding at the age of 50 months, even when\nfactors relating to temperament and language are factored out (Sodian\n& Kristen-Antonow, 2015). Another source of evidence comes from\nthe fact that the arrested development of these attention-involving\nabilities is a revealing marker of the impairments suffered by\nautistic children (Kanner, 1943, Hobson & Hobson, 2011), and from\nthe fact that a lack of such abilities is perhaps related to\nlimitations in the mental-state attribution abilities of non-human\nprimates, although this last claim is more controversial (Call &\nTomasello, 2005). \nSome progress has been made towards extracting philosophical lessons\nfrom the empirical work indicating that attention has an explanatory\nrole to play here (see, for several examples, the papers collected in\nEilan, et al. 2005, Seemann 2011). One of the points at which\nphilosophical difficulties arise is in characterizing the\nsharedness of the attention that is implicated in this\ndevelopmental trajectory. Christopher Peacocke has argued that the way\nin which joint attention episodes are shared involves a kind of\nreciprocal recognition of the other’s recognition of one’s\nown attention, and so that it involves a kind of mutual openness that\nis analogous to the openness of ‘common knowledge’, as\nthat notion figures in philosophical analyses of communication and\nconvention (See\n ‘Convention’).\n Since joint attention is achieved by young children, its achievement\ncannot plausibly be thought to make any sophisticated intellectual\ndemands. Peacocke therefore argues that awareness of reciprocated\nopenness must be more fundamental than the intellectual achievement of\ncommon knowledge, and should instead be understood as a variety of\nperceptual awareness that makes common knowledge possible\n(Peacocke, 2005). John Campbell shares Peacocke’s view of joint\nattention as being a perceptual phenomenon, as opposed to a phenomenon\nthat is achieved when one’s perception is reflected on in a\ncertain way, but Campbell differs from Peacocke in taking the person\nwith whom attention is shared to be fellow subject of the\njoint experience, not an object who figures in the content of\nthe experience that each joint-attender individually has (Campbell,\n2002, Ch. 8).  \nThe apparent links between attention and demonstrative reference (see\nsection\n 3.2)\n and attention and knowledge of other minds (see section\n 3.3)\n might be special instances of a more general connection between\nattention and the making of epistemic moves. A general connection of\nthat sort may have been what Descartes had in mind when he suggested\nthat attention to clear and distinct ideas is a necessary condition\nfor those ideas to realize their special epistemic potential (see\nSection\n 1.1).\n It might also be what Stewart had in mind when he suggested that\n“Some attention [is] necessary for any act of memory\nwhatever” (see Section\n 1.4).\n Kant’s anthropological writings also cast attention in a\ncrucial epistemic role, as explaining the control that one can exert\nover representations in thought and in imagination, where this perhaps\nincludes the kind of imagination that Kant thinks is involved in\nmaking one’s experiences into experiences of an objective\nspatiotemporal world (Merrittt & Valaris, 2017). \nAlthough these philosophers have tended to frame the idea in a way\nthat reflects their other theoretical commitments, some version of the\nidea that attention is always involved in the making of epistemic\nmoves can be made pre-theoretically plausible. The inattentional\nblindness experiments, in which subjects are visually presented with\nlarge changes while attending to something else, show that inattentive\nsubjects can fail to notice all sorts of perceivable things that\nattentive subjects find obvious. Something exactly similar seems to be\ntrue in the a priori domain. Just as no item is so large, so central,\nand so well lit that no conscious and sighted observer could miss it,\nso there is no step in reasoning that is so simple, so compelling and\nso obvious that every thinker, whether attentive or inattentive, can\nbe expected to recognise it. The inattentional blindness effects show\nthat there are attentional demands that a thinker has to meet before\nhis perceptual encounter with things can provide knowledge of them. It\nis plausible that there are similar attentional demands that have to\nbe met before the thinker’s grasp of a thought gives her a\njustified belief in the thought’s consequences. \nIn both the a priori case and the perceptual case the acquisition of\nknowledge seems to require attention, and in both cases this\nrequirement seems to be a practical one. It may be that\nknowledge of some propositions is required if one’s experience\nwith a gorilla is to provide one with knowledge of the gorilla’s\npresence. The propositions here would be of a sort that could serve as\na major premise in an inference by which one’s perceptual\nexperience was interpreted, but the requirement on gaining knowledge\nfrom experience cannot be that one must be bearing such propositions\nin mind. The same is true in the a priori domain. What is required\nbefore an a priori entitlement can be recognized cannot be that one\nhas to entertain some prior knowledge of a proposition from which the\nentitlement can be deduced. To suppose that such occurent\npropositional knowledge is what is necessary for such moves would be\nto embark on the regress set by Lewis Carroll’s tortoise to\nAchilles (Carroll, 1895). What epistemic move-making requires is not\nknowledge of a proposition. The thing that it requires is the right\nsort of active attention. \nThe attentional requirements that have to be met before one can\nacquire knowledge from experience or recognize an a priori entitlement\nare not requirements merely for alertness. They are not captured\nmerely by saying that, in order to gain knowledge, the thinker has to\npay some attention to the relevant ideas. A thinker may be\nattending to a syllogism, but, if he is attending to its rhythm, he\nmay still be unable to see that the conclusion follows. A non-question\nbegging characterisation of the attentional requirements of knowledge\nacquisition in general would be an important contribution to\nepistemology. Current work on attention, focussing as it does on\nattention as a perceptual phenomenon, may only give us a part of the\ngeneral theory that we need. Work on purely intellectual forms of\nattention continues to be scarce. \nAttention’s involvement in voluntary action is a lot\nharder to study in a controlled way than is its involvement in\nperception. The theories of attention emerging from experimental\npsychology have, as a result, focussed almost exclusively on\nattention’s perceptual instances. In this respect they contrast\nwith theories that were developed in the period before psychology and\nphilosophy split, in which the action-involving aspects of attention\nwere much more prominent. William James, for example, suggests in the\nPrinciples of Psychology that ‘volition is nothing but\nattention’ (James, 1890 p. 424), and at one time (in what might\nbe read as an anticipation of the competition based theories discussed\n above§2.6)\n he proposed that “Attention, belief, affirmation, and motor\nvolition, are […] four names for an identical process,\nincidental to the conflict of ideas alone, the survival of one in\nspite of the opposition of the others.” (1880). \nThe issues surrounding attention’s relationship to the\nvoluntariness of action are parallel to some of the issues surrounding\nattention’s relationship to the consciousness of perception. It\nseems natural to think that attention is necessary for finely tuned\nbehaviours, much as it seems necessary for the perception of fine\ndetail. But it does not seem natural to think that we must be paying\nattention to the execution of every act that we voluntarily perform,\nany more than it seem natural to suppose that we must pay attention in\norder to be perceiving anything at all. A case could therefore be\nmade, on commonsense grounds, for claiming that attention figures in\nthe production of some but not all voluntary behaviours. One can\nimagine this view being challenged by a theorist who claimed that\nattention is necessary for any action to be voluntary, arguing that\nthere is an illusion (analogous to the refrigerator light illusion)\nthat gives us the mistaken impression that our inattentive acts are\nvoluntary too. As in the case of attention and consciousness there is\nan epistemological puzzle about the sort of evidence that could settle\nthis issue. This may be a topic for future research. \nAttention might also have a role to play in other philosophically\ninteresting phenomena. This has been underexplored, particular with\nregard to the role of attention in ethics. Simone Weil suggests that\nattention has an absolutely central role in ethics, and in value\ntheory more broadly, writing that: \nWeil’s claims about attention’s import were developed in\nthe work of Iris Murdoch, who suggests that there are some forms of\nattention that play an essential role in the exercise of the virtues\n(Murdoch, 1970, see Mole, 2006). More recently they have been taken up\nby Dorothea Debus, who places particular emphasis on Weil’s\nclaim that it is full attention to which Weil attributes such\ncardinal value (Debus, 2015). Nicolas Bommarito has developed an\naccount of modesty as a just such a ‘virtue of attention’,\narguing that this avoids epistemic difficulties that other accounts of\nmodesty face, if they characterize modesty as requiring false beliefs\nabout the extent of one’s strengths (Bommarito, 2013).","contact.mail":"cmole@mail.ubc.ca","contact.domain":"mail.ubc.ca"}]
