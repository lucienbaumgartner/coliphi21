In fact, there is an extensive literature that offers many\ndifferent definitions of this elusive concept. [Classic treatments of\nthe concept of political representations within this literature\ninclude Pennock and Chapman 1968; Pitkin, 1967 and Schwartz, 1988.]\nHanna Pitkin (1967) provides, perhaps, one of the most straightforward\ndefinitions: to represent is simply to “make present\nagain.” On this definition, political representation is the\nactivity of making citizens’ voices, opinions, and perspectives\n“present” in public policy making processes. Political\nrepresentation occurs when political actors speak, advocate,\nsymbolize, and act on the behalf of others in the political arena. In\nshort, political representation is a kind of political assistance.\nThis seemingly straightforward definition, however, is not adequate as\nit stands. For it leaves the concept of political representation\nunderspecified. Indeed, as we will see, the concept of political\nrepresentation has multiple and competing dimensions: our common\nunderstanding of political representation is one that contains\ndifferent, and conflicting, conceptions of how political\nrepresentatives should represent and so holds representatives to\nstandards that are mutually incompatible. In leaving these dimensions\nunderspecified, this definition fails to capture this paradoxical\ncharacter of the concept.\n\n\nThis encyclopedia entry has three main goals. The first is to provide\na general overview of the meaning of political representation,\nidentifying the key components of this concept. The second is to\nhighlight several important advances that have been made by the\ncontemporary literature on political representation. These advances\npoint to new forms of political representation, ones that are not\nlimited to the relationship between formal representatives and their\nconstituents. The third goal is to reveal several persistent problems\nwith theories of political representation and thereby to propose some\nfuture areas of research.\n\nPolitical representation, on almost any account, will exhibit the\nfollowing five components: \nTheories of political representation often begin by specifying the\nterms for the first four components. For instance, democratic\ntheorists often limit the types of representatives being discussed to\nformal representatives — that is, to representatives who hold\nelected offices. One reason that the concept of representation remains\nelusive is that theories of representation often apply only to\nparticular kinds of political actors within a particular context. How\nindividuals represent an electoral district is treated as distinct\nfrom how social movements, judicial bodies, or informal organizations\nrepresent. Consequently, it is unclear how different forms of\nrepresentation relate to each other. Andrew Rehfeld (2006) has offered\na general theory of representation which simply identifies\nrepresentation by reference to a relevant audience accepting a person\nas its representative. One consequence of Rehfeld’s general\napproach to representation is that it allows for undemocratic cases of\nrepresentation.  \nHowever, Rehfeld’s general theory of representation does not\nspecify what representative do or should do in order to be recognized\nas a representative. And what exactly representatives do has\nbeen a hotly contested issue. In particular, a controversy has raged\nover whether representatives should act as delegates or\ntrustees. \nHistorically, the theoretical literature on political representation\nhas focused on whether representatives should act as\ndelegates or as trustees. Representatives who are\ndelegates simply follow the expressed preferences of their\nconstituents. James Madison (1787–8) describes representative\ngovernment as “the delegation of the government...to a small\nnumber of citizens elected by the rest.” Madison recognized that\n“Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm.”\nConsequently, Madison suggests having a diverse and large population\nas a way to decrease the problems with bad representation. In other\nwords, the preferences of the represented can partially safeguard\nagainst the problems of faction. \nIn contrast, trustees are representatives who follow their own\nunderstanding of the best action to pursue. Edmund Burke (1790) is\nfamous for arguing that \nThe delegate and the trustee conception of political representation\nplace competing and contradictory demands on the behavior of\nrepresentatives. [For a discussion of the similarities and differences\nbetween Madison’s and Burke’s conception of\nrepresentation, see Pitkin 1967, 191–192.] Delegate conceptions\nof representation require representatives to follow their\nconstituents’ preferences, while trustee conceptions require\nrepresentatives to follow their own judgment about the proper course\nof action. Any adequate theory of representation must grapple with\nthese contradictory demands. \nFamously, Hanna Pitkin argues that theorists should not try to\nreconcile the paradoxical nature of the concept of representation.\nRather, they should aim to preserve this paradox by recommending that\ncitizens safeguard the autonomy of both the representative and of\nthose being represented. The autonomy of the representative is\npreserved by allowing them to make decisions based on his or her\nunderstanding of the represented’s interests (the trustee\nconception of representation). The autonomy of those being represented\nis preserved by having the preferences of the represented influence\nevaluations of representatives (the delegate conception of\nrepresentation). Representatives must act in ways that safeguard the\ncapacity of the represented to authorize and to hold their\nrepresentatives accountable and uphold the capacity of the\nrepresentative to act independently of the wishes of the\nrepresented. \nObjective interests are the key for determining whether the autonomy\nof representative and the autonomy of the represented have been\nbreached. However, Pitkin never adequately specifies how we are to\nidentify constituents’ objective interests. At points, she\nimplies that constituents should have some say in what are their\nobjective interests, but ultimately she merely shifts her focus away\nfrom this paradox to the recommendation that representatives should be\nevaluated on the basis of the reasons they give for disobeying the\npreferences of their constituents. For Pitkin, assessments about\nrepresentatives will depend on the issue at hand and the political\nenvironment in which a representative acts. To understand the multiple\nand conflicting standards within the concept of representation is to\nreveal the futility of holding all representatives to some fixed set\nof guidelines. In this way, Pitkin concludes that standards for\nevaluating representatives defy generalizations. Moreover,\nindividuals, especially democratic citizens, are likely to disagree\ndeeply about what representatives should be doing. \nPitkin offers one of the most comprehensive discussions of the concept\nof political representation, attending to its contradictory character\nin her The Concept of Representation. This classic discussion\nof the concept of representation is one of the most influential and\noft-cited works in the literature on political representation. (For a\ndiscussion of her influence, see Dovi 2016). Adopting a\nWittgensteinian approach to language, Pitkin maintains that in order\nto understand the concept of political representation, one must\nconsider the different ways in which the term is used. Each of these\ndifferent uses of the term provides a different view of the concept.\nPitkin compares the concept of representation to “ a rather\ncomplicated, convoluted, three–dimensional structure in the\nmiddle of a dark enclosure.” Political theorists provide\n“flash-bulb photographs of the structure taken from different\nangles” [1967, 10]. More specifically, political theorists have\nprovided four main views of the concept of representation.\nUnfortunately, Pitkin never explains how these different views of\npolitical representation fit together. At times, she implies that the\nconcept of representation is unified. At other times, she emphasizes\nthe conflicts between these different views, e.g. how descriptive\nrepresentation is opposed to accountability. Drawing on her flash-bulb\nmetaphor, Pitkin argues that one must know the context in which the\nconcept of representation is placed in order to determine its meaning.\nFor Pitkin, the contemporary usage of the term\n“representation” can signficantly change its meaning. \nFor Pitkin, disagreements about representation can be partially\nreconciled by clarifying which view of representation is being\ninvoked. Pitkin identifies at least four different views of\nrepresentation: formalistic representation, descriptive\nrepresentation, symbolic representation, and substantive\nrepresentation. (For a brief description of each of these views, see\nchart below.) Each view provides a different approach for examining\nrepresentation. The different views of representation can also provide\ndifferent standards for assessing representatives. So disagreements\nabout what representatives ought to be doing are aggravated by the\nfact that people adopt the wrong view of representation or misapply\nthe standards of representation. Pitkin has in many ways set the terms\nof contemporary discussions about representation by providing this\nschematic overview of the concept of political representation. \nBrief Description. The institutional arrangements\nthat precede and initiate representation. Formal representation has\ntwo dimensions: authorization and accountability. \nMain Research Question. What is the institutional\nposition of a representative? \nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives.\nNone. \nBrief Description. The means by which a\nrepresentative obtains his or her standing, status, position or\noffice. \nMain Research Questions. What is the process by which\na representative gains power (e.g., elections) and what are the ways\nin which a representative can enforce his or her decisions? \nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives. No\nstandards for assessing how well a representative behaves. One can\nmerely assess whether a representative legitimately holds his or her\nposition. \nBrief Description. The ability of constituents to\npunish their representative for failing to act in accordance\nwith their wishes (e.g. voting an elected official out of office) or\nthe responsiveness of the representative to the\nconstituents. \nMain Research Question. What are the sanctioning\nmechanisms available to constituents? Is the representative responsive\ntowards his or her constituents’ preferences? \nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives. No\nstandards for assessing how well a representative behaves. One can\nmerely determine whether a representative can be sanctioned or has\nbeen responsive. \nBrief Description. The ways that a representative\n“stands for” the represented — that is, the meaning\nthat a representative has for those being represented. \nMain Research Question. What kind of response is\ninvoked by the representative in those being represented? \nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives.\nRepresentatives are assessed by the degree of acceptance that the\nrepresentative has among the represented. \nBrief Description. The extent to which a\nrepresentative resembles those being represented. \nMain Research Question. Does the representative look\nlike, have common interests with, or share certain experiences with\nthe represented? \nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives.\nAssess the representative by the accuracy of the resemblance between\nthe representative and the represented. \nBrief Description. The activity of\nrepresentatives—that is, the actions taken on behalf of, in the\ninterest of, as an agent of, and as a substitute for the\nrepresented. \nMain Research Question. Does the representative\nadvance the policy preferences that serve the interests of the\nrepresented? \nImplicit Standards for Evaluating Representatives.\nAssess a representative by the extent to which policy outcomes\nadvanced by a representative serve “the best interests” of\ntheir constituents. \nOne cannot overestimate the extent to which Pitkin has shaped\ncontemporary understandings of political representation, especially\namong political scientists. For example, her claim that descriptive\nrepresentation opposes accountability is often the starting point for\ncontemporary discussions about whether marginalized groups need\nrepresentatives from their groups. \nSimilarly, Pitkin’s conclusions about the paradoxical nature of\npolitical representation support the tendency among contemporary\ntheorists and political scientists to focus on formal procedures of\nauthorization and accountability (formalistic representation). In\nparticular, there has been a lot of theoretical attention paid to the\nproper design of representative institutions (e.g. Amy 1996; Barber,\n2001; Christiano 1996; Guinier 1994). This focus is certainly\nunderstandable, since one way to resolve the disputes about what\nrepresentatives should be doing is to “let the people\ndecide.” In other words, establishing fair procedures for\nreconciling conflicts provides democratic citizens one way to settle\nconflicts about the proper behavior of representatives. In this way,\ntheoretical discussions of political representation tend to depict\npolitical representation as primarily a principal-agent relationship.\nThe emphasis on elections also explains why discussions about the\nconcept of political representation frequently collapse into\ndiscussions of democracy. Political representation is understood as a\nway of 1) establishing the legitimacy of democratic institutions and\n2) creating institutional incentives for governments to be responsive\nto citizens. \nDavid Plotke (1997) has noted that this emphasis on mechanisms of\nauthorization and accountability was especially useful in the context\nof the Cold War. For this understanding of political representation\n(specifically, its demarcation from participatory democracy) was\nuseful for distinguishing Western democracies from Communist\ncountries. Those political systems that held competitive elections\nwere considered to be democratic (Schumpeter 1976). Plotke questions\nwhether such a distinction continues to be useful. Plotke recommends\nthat we broaden the scope of our understanding of political\nrepresentation to encompass interest representation and thereby return\nto debating what is the proper activity of representatives.\nPlotke’s insight into why traditional understandings of\npolitical representation resonated prior to the end of the Cold War\nsuggests that modern understandings of political representation are to\nsome extent contingent on political realities. For this reason, those\nwho attempt to define political representation should recognize how\nchanging political realities can affect contemporary understandings of\npolitical representation. Again, following Pitkin, ideas about\npolitical representation appear contingent on existing political\npractices of representation. Our understandings of representation are\ninextricably shaped by the manner in which people are currently being\nrepresented. For an informative discussion of the history of\nrepresentation, see Monica Brito Vieira and David Runican’s\nRepresentation. \nAs mentioned earlier, theoretical discussions of political\nrepresentation have focused mainly on the formal procedures of\nauthorization and accountability within nation states, that is, on\nwhat Pitkin called formalistic representation. However, such a focus\nis no longer satisfactory due to international and domestic political\ntransformations. [For an extensive discussion of international and\ndomestic transformations, see Mark Warren and Dario Castioglione\n(2004).] Increasingly international, transnational and\nnon-governmental actors play an important role in advancing public\npolicies on behalf of democratic citizens—that is, acting as\nrepresentatives for those citizens. Such actors “speak\nfor,” “act for” and can even “stand for”\nindividuals within a nation-state. It is no longer desirable to limit\none’s understanding of political representation to elected\nofficials within the nation-state. After all, increasingly state\n“contract out” important responsibilities to non-state\nactors, e.g. environmental regulation. As a result, elected officials\ndo not necessarily possess “the capacity to act,” the\ncapacity that Pitkin uses to identify who is a representative. So, as\nthe powers of nation-state have been disseminated to international and\ntransnational actors, elected representatives are not necessarily the\nagents who determine how policies are implemented. Given these\nchanges, the traditional focus of political representation, that is,\non elections within nation-states, is insufficient for understanding\nhow public policies are being made and implemented. The complexity of\nmodern representative processes and the multiple locations of\npolitical power suggest that contemporary notions of accountability\nare inadequate. Grant and Keohane (2005) have recently updated notions\nof accountability, suggesting that the scope of political\nrepresentation needs to be expanded in order to reflect contemporary\nrealities in the international arena. Michael Saward (2009) has\nproposed an innovative type of criteria that should be used for\nevaluating non-elective representative claims. John Dryzek and Simon\nNiemayer(2008) has proposed an alternative conception of\nrepresentation, what he calls discursive representation, to reflect\nthe fact that transnational actors represent discourses, not real\npeople. By discourses, they mean “a set of categories and\nconcepts embodying specific assumptions, judgments, contentions,\ndispositions, and capabilities.” The concept of discursive\nrepresentation can potentially redeem the promise of deliberative\ndemocracy when the deliberative participation of all affected by a\ncollective decision is infeasible.  \nDomestic transformations also reveal the need to update contemporary\nunderstandings of political representation. Associational life —\nsocial movements, interest groups, and civic associations—is\nincreasingly recognized as important for the survival of\nrepresentative democracies. The extent to which interest groups write\npublic policies or play a central role in implementing and regulating\npolicies is the extent to which the division between formal and\ninformal representation has been blurred. The fluid relationship\nbetween the career paths of formal and informal representatives also\nsuggests that contemporary realities do not justify focusing mainly on\nformal representatives. Mark Warren’s concept of citizen\nrepresentatives (2008) opens up a theoretical framework for exploring\nhow citizens represent themselves and serve in representative\ncapacities.  \nGiven these changes, it is necessary to revisit our conceptual\nunderstanding of political representation, specifically of democratic\nrepresentation. For as Jane Mansbridge has recently noted, normative\nunderstandings of representation have not kept up with recent\nempirical research and contemporary democratic practices. In her\nimportant article “Rethinking Representation” Mansbridge\nidentifies four forms of representation in modern democracies:\npromissory, anticipatory, gyroscopic and surrogacy. Promissory\nrepresentation is a form of representation in which representatives\nare to be evaluated by the promises they make to constituents during\ncampaigns. Promissory representation strongly resembles Pitkin’s\ndiscussion of formalistic representation. For both are primarily\nconcerned with the ways that constituents give their consent to the\nauthority of a representative. Drawing on recent empirical work,\nMansbridge argues for the existence of three additional forms of\nrepresentation. In anticipatory representation, representatives focus\non what they think their constituents will reward in the next election\nand not on what they promised during the campaign of the previous\nelection. Thus, anticipatory representation challenges those who\nunderstand accountability as primarily a retrospective activity. In\ngyroscopic representation, representatives “look within”\nto derive from their own experience conceptions of interest and\nprinciples to serve as a basis for their action. Finally, surrogate\nrepresentation occurs when a legislator represents constituents\noutside of their districts. For Mansbridge, each of these different\nforms of representation generates a different normative criterion by\nwhich representatives should be assessed. All four forms of\nrepresentation, then, are ways that democratic citizens can be\nlegitimately represented within a democratic regime. Yet none of the\nlatter three forms representation operates through the formal\nmechanisms of authorization and accountability. Recently, Mansbridge\n(2009) has gone further by suggesting that political science has\nfocused too much on the sanctions model of accountability and that\nanother model, what she calls the selection model, can be more\neffective at soliciting the desired behavior from representatives.\nAccording to Mansbridge, a sanction model of accountability presumes\nthat the representative has different interests from the represented\nand that the represented should not only monitor but reward the good\nrepresentative and punish the bad. In contrast, the selection model of\naccountability presumes that representatives have self-motivated and\nexogenous reasons for carrying out the represented’s wishes. In\nthis way, Mansbridge broadens our understanding of accountability to\nallow for good representation to occur outside of formal sanctioning\nmechanisms. \nMansbridge’s rethinking of the meaning of representation holds\nan important insight for contemporary discussions of democratic\nrepresentation. By specifying the different forms of representation\nwithin a democratic polity, Mansbridge teaches us that we should refer\nto the multiple forms of democratic representation.\nDemocratic representation should not be conceived as a monolithic\nconcept. Moreover, what is abundantly clear is that democratic\nrepresentation should no longer be treated as consisting simply in a\nrelationship between elected officials and constituents within her\nvoting district. Political representation should no longer be\nunderstood as a simple principal-agent relationship. Andrew Rehfeld\nhas gone farther, maintaining that political representation should no\nlonger be territorially based. In other words, Rehfeld (2005) argues\nthat constituencies, e.g. electoral districts, should not be\nconstructed based on where citizens live. \nLisa Disch (2011) also complicates our understanding of democratic\nrepresentation as a principal-agent relationship by uncovering a\ndilemma that arises between expectations of democratic responsiveness\nto constituents and recent empirical findings regarding the context\ndependency of individual constituents’ preferences. In response\nto this dilemma, Disch proposes a mobilization conception of political\nrepresentation and develops a systemic understanding of reflexivity as\nthe measure of its legitimacy. \nBy far, one of the most important shifts in the literature on\nrepresentation has been the “constructivist turn.”\nConstructivist approaches to representation emphasize the\nrepresentative’s role in creating and framing the identities and\nclaims of the represented. Here Michael Saward’s The\nRepresentative Claim is exemplary. For Saward, representation\nentails a series of relationships: “A maker of representations\n(M) puts forward a subject (S) which stands for an object (O) which is\nrelated to a referent (R) and is offered to an audience (A)”\n(2006, 302). Instead of presuming a pre-existing set of interests of\nthe represented that representatives “bring into” the\npolitical arena, Saward stresses how representative claim-making is a\n“deeply culturally inflected practice.” Saward explicitly\ndenies that theorists can know what are the interests of the\nrepresented. For this reason, the represented should have the ultimate\nsay in judging the claims of the representative. The task of the\nrepresentative is to create claims that will resonate with appropriate\naudiences. \nSaward therefore does not evaluate representatives by the extent to\nwhich they advance the preferences or interests of the represented.\nInstead he focuses on the institutional and collective conditions in\nwhich claim-making takes place. The constructivist turn examines the\nconditions for claim-making, not the activities of particular\nrepresentatives. \nSaward’s “constructivist turn” has generated a new\nresearch direction for both political theorists and empirical\nscientists. For example, Lisa Disch (2015) considers whether the\nconstructivist turn is a “normative dead” end, that is,\nwhether the epistemological commitments of constructivism that deny\nthe ability to identify interests will undermine the normative\ncommitments to democratic politics. Disch offers an alternative\napproach, what she calls “the citizen standpoint”. This\nstandpoint does not mean taking at face value whomever or whatever\ncitizens regard as representing them. Rather, it is “an\nepistemological and political achievement that does not exist\nspontaneously but develops out of the activism of political movements\ntogether with the critical theories and transformative empirical\nresearch to which they give rise” (2015, 493). (For other\ncritical engagements with Saward’s work, see Schaap et al, 2012\nand Nässtrom, 2011).  \nThere have been a number of important advances in theorizing the\nconcept of political representation. In particular, these advances\ncall into question the traditional way of thinking of political\nrepresentation as a principal-agent relationship. Most notably,\nMelissa Williams’ recent work has recommended reenvisioning the\nactivity of representation in light of the experiences of historically\ndisadvantaged groups. In particular, she recommends understanding\nrepresentation as “mediation.” In particular, Williams\n(1998, 8) identifies three different dimensions of political life that\nrepresentatives must “mediate:” the dynamics of\nlegislative decision-making, the nature of legislator-constituent\nrelations, and the basis for aggregating citizens into representable\nconstituencies. She explains each aspect by using a corresponding\ntheme (voice, trust, and memory) and by drawing on the experiences of\nmarginalized groups in the United States. For example, drawing on the\nexperiences of American women trying to gain equal citizenship,\nWilliams argues that historically disadvantaged groups need a\n“voice” in legislative decision-making. The “heavily\ndeliberative” quality of legislative institutions requires the\npresence of individuals who have direct access to historically\nexcluded perspectives. \nIn addition, Williams explains how representatives need to mediate the\nrepresentative-constituent relationship in order to build\n“trust.” For Williams, trust is the cornerstone for\ndemocratic accountability. Relying on the experiences of\nAfrican-Americans, Williams shows the consistent patterns of betrayal\nof African-Americans by privileged white citizens that give them good\nreason for distrusting white representatives and the institutions\nthemselves. For Williams, relationships of distrust can be “at\nleast partially mended if the disadvantaged group is represented by\nits own members”(1998, 14). Finally, representation involves\nmediating how groups are defined. The boundaries of groups according\nto Williams are partially established by past experiences — what\nWilliams calls “memory.” Having certain shared patterns of\nmarginalization justifies certain institutional mechanisms to\nguarantee presence. \nWilliams offers her understanding of representation as mediation as a\nsupplement to what she regards as the traditional conception of\nliberal representation. Williams identifies two strands in liberal\nrepresentation. The first strand she describes as the “ideal of\nfair representation as an outcome of free and open elections in which\nevery citizen has an equally weighted vote” (1998, 57). The\nsecond strand is interest-group pluralism, which Williams describes as\nthe “theory of the organization of shared social interests with\nthe purpose of securing the equitable representation … of those\ngroups in public policies” (ibid.). Together, the two\nstrands provide a coherent approach for achieving fair representation,\nbut the traditional conception of liberal representation as made up of\nsimply these two strands is inadequate. In particular, Williams\ncriticizes the traditional conception of liberal representation for\nfailing to take into account the injustices experienced by\nmarginalized groups in the United States. Thus, Williams expands\naccounts of political representation beyond the question of\ninstitutional design and thus, in effect, challenges those who\nunderstand representation as simply a matter of formal procedures of\nauthorization and accountability. \nAnother way of reenvisioning representation was offered by Nadia\nUrbinati (2000, 2002). Urbinati argues for understanding\nrepresentation as advocacy. For Urbinati, the point\nof representation should not be the aggregation of interests, but the\npreservation of disagreements necessary for preserving liberty.\nUrbinati identifies two main features of advocacy: 1) the\nrepresentative’s passionate link to the electors’ cause\nand 2) the representative’s relative autonomy of judgment.\nUrbinati emphasizes the importance of the former for motivating\nrepresentatives to deliberate with each other and their constituents.\nFor Urbinati the benefit of conceptualizing representation as advocacy\nis that it improves our understanding of deliberative democracy. In\nparticular, it avoids a common mistake made by many contemporary\ndeliberative democrats: focusing on the formal procedures of\ndeliberation at the expense of examining the sources of inequality\nwithin civil society, e.g. the family. One benefit of Urbinati’s\nunderstanding of representation is its emphasis on the importance of\nopinion and consent formation. In particular, her agonistic conception\nof representation highlights the importance of disagreements and\nrhetoric to the procedures, practices, and ethos of democracy. Her\naccount expands the scope of theoretical discussions of representation\naway from formal procedures of authorization to the deliberative and\nexpressive dimensions of representative institutions. In this way, her\nagonistic understanding of representation provides a theoretical tool\nto those who wish to explain how non-state actors\n“represent.” \nOther conceptual advancements have helped clarify the meaning of\nparticular aspects of representation. For instance, Andrew Rehfeld\n(2009) has argued that we need to disaggregate the delegate/trustee\ndistinction. Rehfeld highlights how representatives can be delegates\nand trustees in at least three different ways. For this reason, we\nshould replace the traditional delegate/trustee distinction with three\ndistinctions (aims, source of judgment, and responsiveness). By\ncollapsing these three different ways of being delegates and trustees,\npolitical theorists and political scientists overlook the ways in\nwhich representatives are often partial delegates and partial\ntrustees. \nOther political theorists have asked us to rethink central aspects of\nour understanding of democratic representation. In Inclusion and\nDemocracy Iris Marion Young asks us to rethink the importance of\ndescriptive representation. Young stresses that attempts to include\nmore voices in the political arena can suppress other voices. She\nillustrates this point using the example of a Latino representative\nwho might inadvertently represent straight Latinos at the expense of\ngay and lesbian Latinos (1986, 350). For Young, the suppression of\ndifferences is a problem for all representation (1986, 351).\nRepresentatives of large districts or of small communities must\nnegotiate the difficulty of one person representing many. Because such\na difficulty is constitutive of representation, it is unreasonable to\nassume that representation should be characterized by a\n“relationship of identity.” The legitimacy of a\nrepresentative is not primarily a function of his or her similarities\nto the represented. For Young, the representative should not be\ntreated as a substitute for the represented. Consequently, Young\nrecommends reconceptualizing representation as a differentiated\nrelationship (2000, 125–127; 1986, 357). There are two main\nbenefits of Young’s understanding of representation. First, her\nunderstanding of representation encourages us to recognize the\ndiversity of those being represented. Second, her analysis of\nrepresentation emphasizes the importance of recognizing how\nrepresentative institutions include as well as they exclude.\nDemocratic citizens need to remain vigilant about the ways in which\nproviding representation for some groups comes at the expense of\nexcluding others. Building on Young’s insight, Suzanne Dovi\n(2009) has argued that we should not conceptualize representation\nsimply in terms of how we bring marginalized groups into democratic\npolitics; rather, democratic representation can require limiting the\ninfluence of overrepresented privileged groups. \nMoreover, based on this way of understanding political representation,\nYoung provides an alterative account of democratic representation.\nSpecifically, she envisions democratic representation as a dynamic\nprocess, one that moves between moments of authorization and moments\nof accountability (2000, 129). It is the movement between these\nmoments that makes the process “democratic.” This fluidity\nallows citizens to authorize their representatives and for\ntraces of that authorization to be evident in what the\nrepresentatives do and how representatives are held accountable. The\nappropriateness of any given representative is therefore partially\ndependent on future behavior as well as on his or her past\nrelationships. For this reason, Young maintains that evaluation of\nthis process must be continuously “deferred.” We must\nassess representation dynamically, that is, assess the whole ongoing\nprocesses of authorization and accountability of representatives.\nYoung’s discussion of the dynamic of representation emphasizes\nthe ways in which evaluations of representatives are incomplete,\nneeding to incorporate the extent to which democratic citizens need to\nsuspend their evaluations of representatives and the extent to which\nrepresentatives can face unanticipated issues. \nAnother insight about democratic representation that comes from the\nliterature on descriptive representation is the importance of\ncontingencies. Here the work of Jane Mansbridge on descriptive\nrepresentation has been particularly influential. Mansbridge\nrecommends that we evaluate descriptive representatives by contexts\nand certain functions. More specifically, Mansbridge (1999, 628)\nfocuses on four functions and their related contexts in which\ndisadvantaged groups would want to be represented by someone who\nbelongs to their group. Those four functions are “(1) adequate\ncommunication in contexts of mistrust, (2) innovative thinking in\ncontexts of uncrystallized, not fully articulated, interests, …\n(3) creating a social meaning of ‘ability to rule’ for\nmembers of a group in historical contexts where the ability has been\nseriously questioned and (4) increasing the polity’s de facto\nlegitimacy in contexts of past discrimination.” For Mansbridge,\ndescriptive representatives are needed when marginalized groups\ndistrust members of relatively more privileged groups and when\nmarginalized groups possess political preferences that have not been\nfully formed. The need for descriptive representation is contingent on\ncertain functions. \nMansbridge’s insight about the contingency of descriptive\nrepresentation suggests that at some point descriptive representatives\nmight not be necessary. However, she doesn’t specify how we are\nto know if interests have become crystallized or trust has formed to\nthe point that the need for descriptive representation would be\nobsolete. Thus, Mansbridge’s discussion of descriptive\nrepresentation suggests that standards for evaluating representatives\nare fluid and flexible. For an interesting discussion of the problems\nwith unified or fixed standards for evaluating Latino representatives,\nsee Christina Beltran’s The Trouble with Unity. \nMansbridge’s discussion of descriptive representation points to\nanother trend within the literature on political representation\n— namely, the trend to derive normative accounts of\nrepresentation from the representative’s function. Russell\nHardin (2004) captured this trend most clearly in his position that\n“if we wish to assess the morality of elected officials, we must\nunderstand their function as our representatives and then infer how\nthey can fulfill this function.” For Hardin, only an empirical\nexplanation of the role of a representative is necessary for\ndetermining what a representative should be doing. Following Hardin,\nSuzanne Dovi (2007) identifies three democratic standards for\nevaluating the performance of representatives: those of\nfair-mindedness, critical trust building, and good gate-keeping. In\nRuling Passions, Andrew Sabl (2002) links the proper behavior\nof representatives to their particular office. In particular, Sabl\nfocuses on three offices: senator, organizer and activist. He argues\nthat the same standards should not be used to evaluate these different\noffices. Rather, each office is responsible for promoting democratic\nconstancy, what Sabl understands as “the effective pursuit of\ninterest.” Sabl (2002) and Hardin (2004) exemplify the trend to\ntie the standards for evaluating political representatives to the\nactivity and office of those representatives. \nThere are three persistent problems associated with political\nrepresentation. Each of these problems identifies a future area of\ninvestigation. The first problem is the proper institutional design\nfor representative institutions within democratic polities. The\ntheoretical literature on political representation has paid a lot of\nattention to the institutional design of democracies. More\nspecifically, political theorists have recommended everything from\nproportional representation (e.g. Guinier, 1994 and Christiano, 1996)\nto citizen juries (Fishkin, 1995). However, with the growing number of\ndemocratic states, we are likely to witness more variation among the\ndifferent forms of political representation. In particular, it is\nimportant to be aware of how non-democratic and hybrid regimes can\nadopt representative institutions to consolidate their power over\ntheir citizens. There is likely to be much debate about the advantages\nand disadvantages of adopting representative institutions. \nThis leads to a second future line of inquiry — ways in which\ndemocratic citizens can be marginalized by representative\ninstitutions. This problem is articulated most clearly by\nYoung’s discussion of the difficulties arising from one person\nrepresenting many. Young suggests that representative institutions can\ninclude the opinions, perspectives and interests of some citizens at\nthe expense of marginalizing the opinions, perspectives and interests\nof others. Hence, a problem with institutional reforms aimed at\nincreasing the representation of historically disadvantaged groups is\nthat such reforms can and often do decrease the responsiveness of\nrepresentatives. For instance, the creation of black districts has\ncreated safe zones for black elected officials so that they are less\naccountable to their constituents. Any decrease in accountability is\nespecially worrisome given the ways citizens are vulnerable to their\nrepresentatives. Thus, one future line of research is examining the\nways that representative institutions marginalize the interests,\nopinions and perspectives of democratic citizens. \nIn particular, it is necessary for to acknowledge the biases of\nrepresentative institutions. While E. E. Schattschneider (1960) has\nlong noted the class bias of representative institutions, there is\nlittle discussion of how to improve the political representation of\nthe disaffected — that is, the political representation of those\ncitizens who do not have the will, the time, or political resources to\nparticipate in politics. The absence of such a discussion is\nparticularly apparent in the literature on descriptive representation,\nthe area that is most concerned with disadvantaged citizens. Anne\nPhillips (1995) raises the problems with the representation of the\npoor, e.g. the inability to define class, however, she argues for\nissues of class to be integrated into a politics of presence. Few\ntheorists have taken up Phillip’s gauntlet and articulated how\nthis integration of class and a politics of presence is to be done. Of\ncourse, some have recognized the ways in which interest groups,\nassociations, and individual representatives can betray the least well\noff (e.g. Strolovitch, 2004). And some (Dovi, 2003) have argued that\ndescriptive representatives need to be selected based on their\nrelationship to citizens who have been unjustly excluded and\nmarginalized by democratic politics. However, it is unclear how to\ncounteract the class bias that pervades domestic and international\nrepresentative institutions. It is necessary to specify the conditions\nunder which certain groups within a democratic polity require enhanced\nrepresentation. Recent empirical literature has suggested that the\nbenefits of having descriptive representatives is by no means\nstraightforward (Gay, 2002). \nA third and final area of research involves the relationship between\nrepresentation and democracy. Historically, representation was\nconsidered to be in opposition with democracy [See\nDahl (1989) for a historical overview of the concept of\nrepresentation]. When compared to the direct forms of democracy found\nin the ancient city-states, notably Athens, representative\ninstitutions appear to be poor substitutes for the ways that citizens\nactively ruled themselves. Barber (1984) has famously argued that\nrepresentative institutions were opposed to strong democracy. In\ncontrast, almost everyone now agrees that democratic political\ninstitutions are representative ones. \nBernard Manin (1997)reminds us that the Athenian Assembly, which often\nexemplifies direct forms of democracy, had only limited powers.\nAccording to Manin, the practice of selecting magistrates by lottery\nis what separates representative democracies from so-called direct\ndemocracies. Consequently, Manin argues that the methods of selecting\npublic officials are crucial to understanding what makes\nrepresentative governments democratic. He identifies four principles\ndistinctive of representative government: 1) Those who govern are\nappointed by election at regular intervals; 2) The decision-making of\nthose who govern retains a degree of independence from the wishes of\nthe electorate; 3) Those who are governed may give expression to their\nopinions and political wishes without these being subject to the\ncontrol of those who govern; and 4) Public decisions undergo the trial\nof debate (6). For Manin, historical democratic practices hold\nimportant lessons for determining whether representative institutions\nare democratic. \nWhile it is clear that representative institutions are vital\ninstitutional components of democratic institutions, much more needs\nto be said about the meaning of democratic representation. In\nparticular, it is important not to presume that all acts of\nrepresentation are equally democratic. After all, not all acts of\nrepresentation within a representative democracy are necessarily\ninstances of democratic representation. Henry Richardson (2002) has\nexplored the undemocratic ways that members of the bureaucracy can\nrepresent citizens. [For a more detailed discussion of non-democratic\nforms of representation, see Apter (1968). Michael Saward (2008) also\ndiscusses how existing systems of political representation do not\nnecessarily serve democracy.] Similarly, it is unclear whether a\nrepresentative who actively seeks to dismantle democratic institutions\nis representing democratically. Does democratic representation require\nrepresentatives to advance the preferences of democratic citizens or\ndoes it require a commitment to democratic institutions? At this\npoint, answers to such questions are unclear. What is certain is that\ndemocratic citizens are likely to disagree about what constitutes\ndemocratic representation. \nOne popular approach to addressing the different and conflicting\nstandards used to evaluate representatives within democratic polities,\nis to simply equate multiple standards with democratic ones. More\nspecifically, it is argued that democratic standards are pluralistic,\naccommodating the different standards possessed and used by democratic\ncitizens. Theorists who adopt this approach fail to specify the proper\nrelationship among these standards. For instance, it is unclear how\nthe standards that Mansbridge identifies in the four different forms\nof representation should relate to each other. Does it matter if\npromissory forms of representation are replaced by surrogate forms of\nrepresentation? A similar omission can be found in Pitkin: although\nPitkin specifies there is a unified relationship among the different\nviews of representation, she never describes how the different views\ninteract. This omission reflects the lacunae in the literature about\nhow formalistic representation relates to descriptive and substantive\nrepresentation. Without such a specification, it is not apparent how\ncitizens can determine if they have adequate powers of authorization\nand accountability. \nCurrently, it is not clear exactly what makes any given form of\nrepresentation consistent, let alone consonant, with democratic\nrepresentation. Is it the synergy among different forms or should we\nexamine descriptive representation in isolation to determine the ways\nthat it can undermine or enhance democratic representation? One\ntendency is to equate democratic representation simply with the\nexistence of fluid and multiple standards. While it is true that the\nfact of pluralism provides justification for democratic institutions\nas Christiano (1996) has argued, it should no longer presumed that all\nforms of representation are democratic since the actions of\nrepresentatives can be used to dissolve or weaken democratic\ninstitutions. The final research area is to articulate the\nrelationship between different forms of representation and ways that\nthese forms can undermine democratic representation.","contact.mail":"sdovi@email.arizona.edu","contact.domain":"email.arizona.edu"}]
