The concern that dominates Rousseau’s work is to find a way\nof preserving human freedom in a world where human beings are\nincreasingly dependent on one another for the satisfaction of their\nneeds. This concern has two dimensions: material and psychological, of\nwhich the latter has greater importance. In the modern world, human\nbeings come to derive their very sense of self from the opinion of\nothers, a fact which Rousseau sees as corrosive of freedom and\ndestructive of individual authenticity. In his mature work, he\nprincipally explores two routes to achieving and protecting freedom:\nthe first is a political one aimed at constructing political\ninstitutions that allow for the co-existence of free and equal citizens\nin a community where they themselves are sovereign; the second is a\nproject for child development and education that fosters autonomy and\navoids the development of the most destructive forms of self-interest.\nHowever, though Rousseau believes the co-existence of human beings in\nrelations of equality and freedom is possible, he is consistently and\noverwhelmingly pessimistic that humanity will escape from a dystopia of\nalienation, oppression, and unfreedom. In addition to his contributions\nto philosophy, Rousseau was active as a composer and a music theorist,\nas the pioneer of modern autobiography, as a novelist, and as a\nbotanist. Rousseau’s appreciation of the wonders of nature and his\nstress on the importance of feeling and emotion made him an important\ninfluence on and anticipator of the romantic movement. To a very large\nextent, the interests and concerns that mark his philosophical\nwork also inform these other activities, and Rousseau’s contributions in\nostensibly non-philosophical fields often serve to illuminate his\nphilosophical commitments and arguments.\n\n\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau was born in the independent Calvinist\ncity-state of Geneva in 1712, the son of Isaac Rousseau, a watchmaker,\nand Suzanne Bernard. Rousseau’s mother died nine days after his birth,\nwith the consequence that Rousseau was raised and educated by his\nfather until the age of ten. Isaac Rousseau was one of the small\nminority of Geneva’s residents who enjoyed the rank of citizen of\nGeneva, a status which Jean-Jacques was to inherit. According\nto Rousseau’s own subsequent accounts, the haphazard education that he\nreceived from his father included both the inculcation of republican\npatriotism and the reading of classical authors such as Plutarch\nwho dealt with the Roman republic.\nOn his father’s exile from the city to avoid arrest,\nJean-Jacques was put in the care of a pastor at nearby Bossey and\nsubsequently apprenticed to an engraver. Rousseau left the city\nat the age of sixteen and came under the influence of a Roman Catholic\nconvert noblewoman, Francoise-Louise de la Tour, Baronne de Warens. Mme\nde Warens arranged for Rousseau to travel to Turin, where he converted\nto Roman Catholicism in April 1728. Rousseau spent some time\nworking as a domestic servant in a noble household in Turin, and during this time\na shameful episode occurred in which he falsely accused a fellow\nservant of the theft of a ribbon. This act marked him deeply and he\nreturns to it in his autobiographical works. \n\nRousseau then spent a brief period training to become a Catholic\npriest before embarking on another brief career as an itinerant\nmusician, music copyist and teacher. In 1731 he returned to Mme de\nWarens at Chambéry and later briefly became her lover and\nthen her household manager. Rousseau remained with Mme de Warens\nthrough the rest of the 1730s, moving to Lyon in 1740 to take up a\nposition as a tutor. This appointment brought him within the orbit\nof both Condillac and d’Alembert and was his first contact\nwith major figures of the French Enlightenment. In\n1742 he travelled to Paris, having devised a plan for a new\nnumerically-based system of musical notation which he presented to the\nAcademy of Sciences. The system was rejected by the Academy, but in this\nperiod Rousseau met Denis Diderot. A brief spell as\nsecretary to the French Ambassador in Venice followed before Rousseau\nmoved to Paris on a more permanent basis from 1744, where he continued\nto work mainly on music and began to write contributions to the\nEncyclopédie of Diderot and d’Alembert. \n\nIn 1745 Rousseau met Thérèse Levasseur, a\nbarely literate laundry-maid who became his lover and, later, his wife.\nAccording to Rousseau’s own account, Thérèse\nbore him five children, all of whom were deposited at the foundling\nhospital shortly after birth, an almost certain sentence of death in\neighteenth-century France. Rousseau’s abandonment of his children was\nlater to be used against him by Voltaire. \n\nIn 1749, while walking to Vincennes to visit the briefly-imprisoned\nDiderot, Rousseau came across a newspaper announcement of an essay competition\norganized by the Academy of Dijon. The Academy sought submissions\non the theme of whether the development of the arts and sciences had\nimproved or corrupted public morals. Rousseau later claimed that he then and there experienced an epiphany which\nincluded the thought, central to his world view, that humankind is good\nby nature but is corrupted by society. Rousseau entered his\nDiscourse on the Sciences and Arts (conventionally known as\nthe First Discourse) for the competition and won first prize\nwith his contrarian thesis that social development, including of the\narts and sciences, is corrosive of both civic virtue and individual moral\ncharacter. The Discourse was published in 1750 and is mainly\nimportant because Rousseau used it to introduce themes that\nhe then developed further in his later work, especially the natural\nvirtue of the ordinary person and the moral corruption fostered by the\nurge to distinction and excellence. The First Discourse made\nRousseau famous and provoked a series\nof responses to which he in turn replied. \n\nMusic remained Rousseau’s primary interest in this period, and the\nyears 1752 and 1753 saw his most important contributions to the field.\nThe first of these was his opera Le Devin du Village (The\nVillage Soothsayer), which was an immediate success (and\nstayed in the repertoire for a century). The second was his\nparticipation in the “querelle des bouffons”, a controversy that\nfollowed the performance in Paris of Pergolesi’s La Serva\nPadrona by a visiting Italian company and which pitted the\npartisans of Italian music against those of the French style. Rousseau,\nwho had already developed a taste for Italian music during his stay in\nVenice, joined the dispute through his Letter on French Music\nand the controversy also informed his (unpublished) Essay on the Origin\nof Languages. Rousseau’s emphasis on the importance of melody and\nthe communication of emotion as central to the function of music was in\nopposition to the views of Rameau, who stressed harmony and the\nrelationship between music, mathematics, and physics. Rousseau went so\nfar as to declare the French language inherently unmusical, a view\napparently contradicted by his own practice in Le Devin. \n\nRousseau’s conversion to Catholicism had rendered him ineligible for\nhis hereditary status as Citizen of Geneva. In 1754 he regained this\ncitizenship by reconverting to Calvinism. In the following year he\npublished his Discourse on the Origins of Inequality, again in\nresponse to an essay competition from the Academy of Dijon. Though he\ndid not win the Academy’s prize a second time, the Second\nDiscourse is a far more accomplished work, and in it Rousseau begins to\ndevelop his theories of human social development and moral psychology.\nWith the Second Discourse, the distance\nbetween Rousseau and the Encyclopédiste\nmainstream of the French Enlightenment thought became clear. This rift\nwas cemented with his 1758 publication of the Letter to\nd’Alembert on the Theater, in which he denounced the idea that his\nnative city would benefit from the construction of a theater. In\nRousseau’s view theater, far from improving the population, tends to\nweaken their attachment to the life of the polis. \n\nThe years following the publication of the Second Discourse\nin 1755 were the most productive and important of Rousseau’s career. He\nwithdrew from Paris and, under the patronage of, first Mme d’Epinay and\nthen the Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg, worked on a novel, Julie,\nou La Nouvelle Héloïse, and then on\nEmile and The Social Contract. Julie appeared in 1761\nand was an immediate success. The novel is centred on a love triangle\nbetween Julie, her tutor Saint Preux and her husband Wolmar. The work\nis cast in epistolary form, and is an important supplementary source\nfor the interpretation of Rousseau’s social philosophy, containing, as\nit does, such elements as a vision of rural community and the presence\nof a manipulative genius who achieves the appearance of natural harmony\nthrough cunning artifice and who thus anticipates both the tutor in\nEmile and the legislator of The Social Contract. Both\nworks appeared in 1762, marking the high point of Rousseau’s\nintellectual achievement.  \n\nUnfortunately for Rousseau, the publication of these works led to personal catastrophe. Emile was condemned in Paris and both Emile and The Social Contract were condemned in Geneva on grounds of religious\nheterodoxy. Partly in response to this, Rousseau finally renounced his Genevan citizenship in May 1763. Rousseau was forced to flee to escape arrest, seeking refuge\nfirst in Switzerland and later, in January 1766, at the invitation\nof David Hume, travelling to England. \n\nRousseau’s stay in England was marked by increasing mental\ninstability and he became wrongly convinced that Hume was at the center of a\nplot against him. He spent fourteen months in Staffordshire where he\nworked on his autobiographical work, the Confessions, which\nalso contains evidence of his paranoia in its treatment of figures like\nDiderot and the German author Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm. \nHe returned to France in 1767 and then spent much of\nthe rest of his life working on autobiographical texts, completing the\nConfessions but also composing the Dialogues: Rousseau\nJudge of Jean-Jacques and The Reveries of the Solitary\nWalker. He also completed his Considerations on the Government\nof Poland in this period. In later life he further developed his\ninterest in botany (where his work proved influential in England via\nhis letters on the subject to the Duchess of Portland) and in music, as\nhe met and corresponded with the operatic composer Christoph Gluck. \nRousseau died in 1778. In 1794 the\nFrench revolutionaries transferred his remains to the\nPanthéon in Paris. \n\nRousseau repeatedly claims that a single idea is at the centre of\nhis world view, namely, that human beings are good by nature but are\nrendered corrupt by society. Unfortunately, despite the alleged\ncentrality of this claim, it is difficult to give it a clear and\nplausible interpretation. One obvious problem is present from the\nstart: since society, the alleged agent of corruption, is composed\nentirely of naturally good human beings, how can evil ever get a\nfoothold? It is also difficult to see what “natural goodness” might be.\nIn various places Rousseau clearly states that morality is not a\nnatural feature of human life, so in whatever sense it is that human\nbeings are good by nature, it is not the moral sense that the casual\nreader would ordinarily assume. In order, therefore, to address this\npuzzling central claim, it is best to look first at the details of\nRousseau’s moral psychology, especially as developed in the\nDiscourse on the Origins of Inequality and in Emile. \n\nRousseau attributes to all creatures an instinctual drive towards\nself-preservation. Human beings therefore have such a drive,\nwhich he terms amour de soi (self love). Amour de soi\ndirects us first to attend to our most basic biological needs for\nthings like food, shelter and warmth. Since, for Rousseau, humans, like\nother creatures, are part of the design of a benevolent creator, they\nare individually well-equipped with the means to satisfy their natural\nneeds. Alongside this basic drive for self-preservation,\nRousseau posits another passion which he terms\npitié (compassion). Pitié\ndirects us to attend to and relieve the suffering of others (including\nanimals) where we can do so without danger to our own\nself-preservation. In some of his writings, such as the Second\nDiscourse, pitié is an original drive that\nsits alongside amour de soi, whereas in others, such as\nEmile and the Essay on the Origin of Languages, it is\na development of amour de soi considered as the origin of all\npassions. \n\nIn the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Rousseau\nimagines a multi-stage evolution of humanity from the most primitive\ncondition to something like a modern complex society. Rousseau denies that this is a reconstruction of history as it actually was, and Frederick Neuhouser (2014) has argued that the evolutionary story is merely a philosophical device designed to separate the natural and the artificial elements of our psychology. At each step of\nthis imagined evolution human beings change their material and psychological\nrelations to one another and, correspondingly, their conception of\nthemselves, or what Rousseau calls the “sentiment of their\nexistence.” According to this narrative, humans live basically\nsolitary lives in the original state of the human race, since they do\nnot need one another to provide for their material needs. The human\nrace barely subsists in this condition, chance meetings between\nproto-humans are the occasions for copulation and reproduction,\nchild-care is minimal and brief in duration. If humans are naturally\ngood at this stage of human evolution, their goodness is merely a\nnegative and amounts to the absence of evil.  In this story, human\nbeings are distinguished from the other creatures with which they\nshare the primeval world only by two characteristics: freedom, and\nperfectibility. Freedom, in this context, is simply the ability not to\nbe governed solely by appetite; perfectibility is the capacity to\nlearn and thereby to find new and better means to satisfy\nneeds. Together, these characteristics give humans the potential to\nachieve self-consciousness, rationality, and morality. Nevertheless,\nit will turn out that such characteristics are more likely to condemn\nthem to a social world of deception, dissimulation, dependence,\noppression, and domination. \n\nAs human populations grow, simple but unstable forms of co-operation\nevolve around activities like hunting. According to Rousseau, the\ncentral transitional moment in human history occurs at a stage of\nsociety marked by small settled communities.  At this point a change,\nor rather a split, takes place in the natural drive humans have to\ncare for themselves: competition among humans to attract sexual\npartners leads them to consider their own attractiveness to others and\nhow that attractiveness compares to that of potential\nrivals. In Emile, where Rousseau is concerned with the\npsychological development of an individual in a modern society, he\nalso associates the genesis of amour propre with sexual\ncompetition and the moment, puberty, when the male adolescent starts\nto think of himself as a sexual being with rivals for the favours of\ngirls and women. \n\nRousseau’s term for this new type of self-interested drive,\nconcerned with comparative success or failure as a social being, is\namour propre (love of self, often rendered as pride or vanity\nin English translations). Amour propre makes a central\ninterest of each human being the need to be recognized by others as\nhaving value and to be treated with respect. The presentation of amour\npropre in the Second Discourse—and especially in his\nnote XV to that work—often suggests that Rousseau sees it as a\nwholly negative passion and the source of all evil. Interpretations of\namour propre centered on the Second Discourse\n(which, historically, are the most common ones (for example Charvet 1974)), often focus on the fact\nthat the need for recognition always has a comparative aspect, so that\nindividuals are not content merely that others acknowledge their value,\nbut also seek to be esteemed as superior to them. This aspect of our\nnature then creates conflict as people try to exact this recognition\nfrom others or react with anger and resentment when it is denied to\nthem. More recent readings of both the Second Discourse, and especially of\nEmile, have indicated that a more nuanced view is possible (Den 1988, Neuhouser 2008).\nAccording to these interpretations, amour propre is both the\ncause of humanity’s fall as well as the promise of its redemption because\nof the way in which it develops humans’ rational capacities and their sense\nof themselves as social creatures among others. Although Rousseau\nheld that the overwhelming tendency, socially and historically, is\nfor amour propre to take on toxic and self-defeating\n(‘inflamed’) forms, he also held that there are, at least in\nprinciple, ways of organizing social life and individual education\nthat allow it to take on a benign character. This project of containing and\nharnessing amour propre finds expression in both The\nSocial Contract and Emile. In some works, such as the\nSecond Discourse, Rousseau presents amour propre as a\npassion that is quite distinct from amour de soi. In others,\nincluding Emile, he presents it as a form that amour de\nsoi takes in a social environment. The latter is consistent with\nhis view in Emile that all the passions are\noutgrowths or developments of amour de soi. \n\nAlthough amour propre has its origins in sexual competition\nand comparison within small societies, it does not achieve its full\ntoxicity until it is combined with a growth in material interdependence\namong human beings. In the Discourse on Inequality, Rousseau\ntraces the growth of agriculture and metallurgy and the first\nestablishment of private property, together with the emergence of\ninequality between those who own land and those who do not. In an\nunequal society, human beings who need both the social good of recognition\nand such material goods as food, warmth, etc. become enmeshed in\nsocial relations that are inimical both to their freedom and to their\nsense of self worth. Subordinates need superiors in order to have\naccess to the means of life; superiors need subordinates to work\nfor them and also to give them the recognition they crave. In such a structure\nthere is a clear incentive for people to misrepresent their true\nbeliefs and desires in order to attain their ends. Thus,\neven those who receive the apparent love and adulation of their\ninferiors cannot thereby find satisfaction for their amour\npropre. This trope of misrepresentation and frustration receives\nits clearest treatment in Rousseau’s account of the figure of the\nEuropean minister, towards the end of the Discourse on\nInequality, a figure whose need to flatter others in order to\nsecure his own wants leads to his alienation from his own self. \n\nAmour de soi, amour propre and\npitié are not the full complement of passions in\nRousseau’s thinking. Once people have achieved consciousness of\nthemselves as social beings, morality also becomes possible and this\nrelies on the further faculty of conscience. The fullest accounts of\nRousseau’s conception of morality are found in the Lettres\nMorales and in sections of the Confession of Faith of the\nSavoyard Vicar, a part of Emile. In the most primitive\nforms of human existence, before the emergence of amour\npropre, pitié balances or restrains\nself-interest. It is, to that extent, akin to a moral sentiment such as\nHumean sympathy. But as something that is merely instinctual it lacks,\nfor Rousseau, a genuinely moral quality. Genuine morality, on the other\nhand, consists in the application of reason to human affairs and\nconduct. This requires the mental faculty that is the source of genuinely moral\nmotivation, namely conscience. Conscience impels us to the love of\njustice and morality in a quasi-aesthetic manner. As the appreciation\nof justice and the desire to act to further it, conscience is based on a rational\nappreciation of the well-orderedness of a benign God’s plan for the\nworld. However, in a world dominated by inflamed amour propre,\nthe normal pattern is not for a morality of reason to supplement or\nsupplant our natural proto-moral sympathies. Instead, the usual course\nof events in civil society is for reason and sympathy to\nbe displaced while humans’ enhanced capacity for reasoning is\nput at the service, not of morality, but of the impulse to dominate,\noppress and exploit. (For recent discussion of Rousseau on conscience and reason, see Neidleman, 2017, ch. 7.) \n\nA theme of both the Second Discourse and the Letter to\nd’Alembert is the way in which human beings can deceive themselves\nabout their own moral qualities. So, for example, theatre audiences\nderive enjoyment from the eliciting of their natural compassion by a\ntragic scene on the stage; then, convinced of their natural goodness,\nthey are freed to act viciously outside the theater. Philosophy, too, can\nserve as a resource for self-deception. It can give people reasons to ignore\nthe promptings of pitié or,\nas in Rousseau’s\nessay Principles of the Right of War, it can underpin legal codes (such as the\nlaw of war and peace) that the powerful may use to license\noppressive violence whilst deadening their natural feelings of\ncompassion. \n\nRousseau’s contributions to political philosophy are scattered among\nvarious works, most notable of which are the Discourse on the\nOrigins of Inequality, the Discourse on Political\nEconomy, The Social Contract, and Considerations on\nthe Government of Poland. However, many of his other works,\nboth major and minor, contain passages that amplify or illuminate the political\nideas in those works. His central doctrine in politics is that a state\ncan be legitimate only if it is guided by the “general will” of its\nmembers. This idea finds its most detailed treatment in The Social\nContract. \n\nIn The Social Contract, Rousseau sets out to answer what he\ntakes to be the fundamental question of politics, the reconciliation of\nthe freedom of the individual with the authority of the state. This\nreconciliation is necessary because human society has evolved to a\npoint where individuals can no longer supply their needs through their\nown unaided efforts, but rather must depend on the co-operation\nof others. The process whereby human needs expand and interdependence\ndeepens is set out in the Discourse on the Origins of\nInequality. In that work, the final moment of Rousseau’s\nconjectural history involves the emergence of endemic conflict among\nthe now-interdependent individuals and the argument that the Hobbesian\ninsecurity of this condition would lead all to consent to the establishment\nof state authority and law. In the Second Discourse, this\nestablishment amounts to the reinforcement of unequal and exploitative\nsocial relations that are now backed by law and state power. In an echo\nof Locke and an anticipation of Marx, Rousseau argues that this state\nwould, in effect, be a class state, guided by the common interest of\nthe rich and propertied and imposing unfreedom and subordination on the\npoor and weak. The propertyless consent to such an establishment\nbecause their immediate fear of a Hobbesian state of war leads them to\nfail to attend to the ways in which the new state will systematically\ndisadvantage them. \n\nThe Social Contract aims to set out an alternative to this\ndystopia, an alternative in which, Rousseau claims, each person will\nenjoy the protection of the common force whilst remaining as free as\nthey were in the state of nature. The key to this reconciliation is the\nidea of the general will: that is, the collective will of the citizen\nbody taken as a whole. The general will is the source of law and is\nwilled by each and every citizen. In obeying the law each citizen is\nthus subject to his or her own will, and consequently, according to Rousseau,\nremains free. \n\nRousseau’s account of the general will is marked by unclarities and\nambiguities that have attracted the interest of commentators since its first publication.\nThe principal tension is between a democratic conception,\nwhere the general will is simply what the citizens of the state\nhave decided together in their sovereign assembly, and an alternative\ninterpretation where the general will is the transcendent incarnation of\nthe citizens’ common interest that exists in abstraction from\nwhat any of them actually wants (Bertram 2012). Both views find some\nsupport in Rousseau’s texts, and both have been influential. Contemporary\nepistemic conceptions of democracy often make reference to\nRousseau’s discussion in Book 2 chapter 3 of of\nThe Social Contract. These accounts typically take\nCondorcet’s jury theorem as a starting point, where democratic\nprocedures are conceived of as a method for discovering the truth\nabout the public interest; they then interpret the general will as a\ndeliberative means of seeking outcomes that satisfy the preferences of\nindividuals and render the authority of the state legitimate (see for\nexample, Grofman and Feld 1988).  The tension between the\n“democratic” and the “transcendental”\nconceptions can be reduced if we take Rousseau to be arguing for the\nview that, under the right conditions and subject to the right\nprocedures, citizen legislators will be led to converge on laws that\ncorrespond to their common interest; however, where those conditions\nand procedures are absent, the state necessarily lacks legitimacy. On\nsuch a reading, Rousseau may be committed to something like an a\nposteriori philosophical anarchism. Such a view holds that it is\npossible, in principle, for a state to exercise legitimate authority\nover its citizens, but all actual states—and indeed all states\nthat we are likely to see in the modern era—will fail to meet\nthe conditions for legitimacy. \n\nRousseau argues that in order for the general will to be truly general\nit must come from all and apply to all. This thought has both\nsubstantive and formal aspects. Formally, Rousseau argues that the law\nmust be general in application and universal in scope. The law cannot\nname particular individuals and it must apply to everyone within the\nstate. Rousseau believes that this condition will lead citizens, though\nguided by a consideration of what is in their own private interest, to\nfavor laws that both secure the common interest impartially and that\nare not burdensome and intrusive. For this to be true, however, it has\nto be the case that the situation of citizens is substantially similar\nto one another. In a state where citizens enjoy a wide diversity of\nlifestyles and occupations, or where there is a great deal of cultural\ndiversity, or where there is a high degree of economic inequality, it\nwill not generally be the case that the impact of the laws will be the\nsame for everyone. In such cases it will often not be true that a\ncitizen can occupy the standpoint of the general will merely by\nimagining the impact of general and universal laws on his or her own case. \n\nIn The Social Contract Rousseau envisages three\ndifferent types or levels of will as being in play. First, individuals\nall have private wills corresponding to their own selfish interests as\nnatural individuals; second, each individual, insofar as he or she identifies\nwith the collective as a whole and assumes the identity of citizen,\nwills the general will of that collective as his or her own, setting aside\nselfish interest in favor of a set of laws that allow all to\ncoexist under conditions of equal freedom; third, and very\nproblematically, a person can identify with the corporate will of a\nsubset of the populace as a whole. The general will is therefore both a property of\nthe collective and a result of its deliberations, and a property of the\nindividual insofar as the individual identifies as a member of the\ncollective. In a well-ordered society, there is no tension between\nprivate and general will, as individuals accept that both justice and\ntheir individual self-interest require their submission to a law which\nsafeguards their freedom by protecting them from the private violence\nand personal domination that would otherwise hold sway. In practice,\nhowever, Rousseau believes that many societies will fail to have this\nwell-ordered character. One way in which they can fail is if private\nindividuals are insufficiently enlightened or virtuous and therefore\nrefuse to accept the restrictions on their own conduct which the\ncollective interest requires. Another mode of political failure arises\nwhere the political community is differentiated into factions (perhaps\nbased on a class division between rich and poor) and where one faction\ncan impose its collective will on the state as a whole. \n\nThe Social Contract harbors a further tension between\ntwo accounts of how the general will emerges and its relation to the\nprivate wills of citizens. Sometimes Rousseau favors a procedural story\naccording to which the individual contemplation of self interest\n(subject to the constraints of generality and universality and under\npropitious sociological background conditions such as rough equality\nand cultural\nsimilarity) will result in the emergence of the general will from the\nassembly of citizens (see Sreenivasan 2000). In this account of the emergence of the general\nwill, there seems to be no special need for citizens to have any\nspecifically moral qualities: the constraints on their choice should be\nenough. However, Rousseau also clearly believes that the mere contemplation\nof self interest would be inadequate to generate a general will.\nThis may partly concern issues of\ncompliance, since selfish citizens who can will the general will might\nstill not be moved to obey it. But Rousseau also seems to believe that\ncitizen virtue is a necessary condition for the emergence of the\ngeneral will in the first place. This presents him with a problem for\nwhich his figure of the legislator is one attempted solution. As a\nbeliever in the plasticity of human nature, Rousseau holds that good\nlaws make for good citizens. However, he also believes both that good\nlaws can only be willed by good citizens and that, in order to be\nlegitimate, they must be agreed upon by the assembly. This puts him in some\ndifficulty, as it is unlikely that the citizens who come together to\nform a new state will have the moral qualities required to will good\nlaws, shaped as those citizens will have been by unjust institutions.\nThe legislator or lawgiver therefore has the function of inspiring a\nsense of collective identity in the new citizens that allows them to\nidentify with the whole and be moved to support legislation\nthat will eventually transform them and their children into good\ncitizens. In this story, however, the new citizens at first lack the\ncapacity to discern the good reasons that support the new laws and the\nlawgiver has to persuade them by non-rational means to legislate in\ntheir own best interests. \n\nThe figure of the legislator is a puzzle. Like the tutor in\nEmile, the legislator has the role of manipulating the desires\nof his charges, giving them the illusion of free choice without its\nsubstance. Little wonder then that many critics have seen these\ncharacters in a somewhat sinister light. In both cases there is a\nmystery concerning where the educator figure comes from and how he\ncould have acquired the knowledge and virtue necessary to perform his\nrole. This, in turn, raises a problem of regress. If the legislator was\nformed by a just society, then who performed the legislator’s role for that\nsociety, and how was that legislator formed? How did the tutor acquire his\neducation if not from a tutor who, in turn, was educated according to\nRousseau’s program by an earlier tutor? \n\nWhat then of Rousseau’s key claim that freedom and authority are\nreconciled in his ideal republic through obedience to the general will?\nThis claim finds notorious and deliberately paradoxical expression in\nBook 1 chapter 7 of The Social Contract, where Rousseau writes\nof citizens being “forced to be free” when they are constrained to obey\nthe general will. The opening words of The Social Contract themselves\nrefer to freedom, with the famous saying that “Man is born free, but is\neverywhere in chains”. This ringing declaration, however, is almost\nimmediately followed by a note of paradox, as Rousseau declares that\nhe can make this subjection “in chains” legitimate. The\nthought that Rousseau’s commitment to freedom might not be all that it\nfirst appears is strengthened by other passages in the book, most\nnotably his declaration that those subject to the general will are\n“forced to be free.” The value of freedom or liberty is at the center\nof Rousseau’s concerns throughout his work. Since he uses the notion in\nseveral distinct ways, though, it is important to distinguish several\nuses of the term. First, we should note that Rousseau regards the\ncapacity for choice, and therefore the ability to act against instinct\nand inclination, as one of the features that distinguishes the human\nrace from animal species and makes truly moral action possible.\nIn the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality, for example, he\ncharacterizes animal species in essentially Cartesian terms, as\nmechanisms programmed to a fixed pattern of behavior. Human beings, on\nthe other hand are not tied to any particular mode of life and can\nreject the promptings of instinct. This makes possible both the\ndevelopment of the human species and also its fall from grace, since\nindividuals can ignore benign impulses (such as pitié) if\nthey wish to. The freedom to act contrary to the “mechanism of the\nsenses”, and the power of willing and choosing is, for Rousseau,\nsomething entirely outside the laws of the physical world and is\ntherefore not subject to scientific explanation. Rousseau also takes\nthis freedom to choose\nto act as the basis of all distinctively moral action.\nIn The Social Contract the connection between freedom of\nchoice and morality is central to his argument against despotic\ngovernment, where he writes that the renunciation of freedom is contrary\nto human nature and that to renounce freedom in favour of another\nperson’s authority is to “deprive one’s actions of all morality” (SC\n1.4). \n\nIn Book I chapter 8 of the The Social Contract, Rousseau\ntries to illuminate his claim that the formation of the legitimate\nstate involves no net loss of freedom, but in fact, he makes a\nslightly different claim. The new claim involves the idea of an exchange\nof one type of freedom (natural freedom) for another type (civil\nfreedom). Natural freedom involves an unlimited right to all things, an\nidea that is reminiscent of Hobbes’s “right of nature” in Leviathan.\nSince all human beings enjoy this liberty right to all things, it is\nclear that in a world occupied by many interdependent humans, the\npractical value of that liberty may be almost nonexistent.\nThis is because any\nindividual’s capacity to get what he or she wants will be limited by his or her\nphysical power and the competing physical power of others. \nFurther, inevitable conflict over scarce resources will pit individuals\nagainst each other, so that unhindered exercise of natural freedom will result\nin violence and uncertainty. The\nformation of the state, and the promulgation of laws willed by the\ngeneral will, transforms this condition. With sovereign power in place,\nindividuals are\nguaranteed a sphere of equal freedom under the law with protection for\ntheir own persons and security for their property. Provided that the\nlaw bearing equally on everyone is not meddlesome or intrusive (and\nRousseau believes it will not be, since no individual has a motive to\nlegislate burdensome laws) there will be a net\nbenefit compared to the pre-political state. \n\nRousseau makes a further claim in the same chapter of The Social Contract,\nnamely\nthat in conditions of civil society the citizen achieves “moral freedom,” by\nwhich he means obedience to a law that one has prescribed to oneself (for discussion see especially Neuhouser 1993).\nAlthough this latter claim is presented almost as an afterthought, it\nis the form of freedom most directly responsive to the challenge\nRousseau had set for himself two chapters earlier, which involved\nfinding “a form of association” in which each citizen would “obey only\nhimself.” Naturally, this raises the question of whether the citizen\ndoes in fact obey only himself when he obeys the general will. On the\nface of it, this claim looks difficult to reconcile with the fact of\nmajorities and minorities within a democratic state, since those\ncitizens who find themselves outvoted would seem to be\nconstrained by a decision with which they disagree. Rousseau’s solution\nto this puzzle is found much later, in Book 4 chapter 3 of The\nSocial Contract, where he argues that those who obey laws\nthey did not vote for remain bound by a will that is their own, since\nthe democratic process has enabled them to discover the content of a\ngeneral will in which that they share. Many commentators have not found this\nargument fully convincing. \n\nRousseau’s invocation of three types of freedom (natural, civil, and moral)\nin the text of\nThe Social Contract  can appear confusing. The picture is\nfurther complicated by the fact that he also relies on a fourth\nconception of freedom, related to civil freedom but distinct from it,\nwhich he nowhere names explicitly. This is “republican freedom” and\nconsists, not in my being subject to my own will, but rather in\nthe fact that the law protects me from being subject to the will\nof any other particular person in the manner of a slave or serf.\nTo find Rousseau’s explicit endorsement\nof this idea, we have to look not to The Social Contract, but\nrather to some of his unpublished notes. Yet the concept is clearly implicit in\nthe notorious “forced to be free” passage in Book 1 chapter 7, since he\nthere explains that when each citizen is constrained to obey the\ngeneral will, he is thereby provided with a guarantee against “all\npersonal dependence”. \n\nOne feature of Rousseau’s political philosophy that has\nproved least persuasive to later thinkers is his doctrine of\nsovereignty and representation, with his apparent rejection of\n“representative government”. At the center of Rousseau’s view in\nThe Social Contract is his rejection of the Hobbesian idea\nthat a people’s legislative will can be vested in some group or\nindividual that then acts with their authority but rules over them.\nInstead, he takes the view that to hand over one’s general right of\nruling oneself to another person or body constitutes a form a slavery,\nand that to recognize such an authority would amount to an abdication\nof moral agency. This hostility to the representation of sovereignty\nalso extends to the election of representatives to sovereign\nassemblies, even where those representatives are subject to periodic\nre-election. Even in that case, the assembly would be legislating on\na range of topics on which citizens have not deliberated. Laws passed by\nsuch assemblies would therefore bind citizens in terms that they have\nnot themselves agreed upon. Not only does the representation of\nsovereignty constitute, for Rousseau, a surrender of moral agency, the\nwidespread desire to be represented in the business of self-rule is a\nsymptom of moral decline and the loss of virtue. \n\nThe practical difficulties of direct self-rule by the entire citizen\nbody are obvious. Such arrangements are potentially onerous and must\nseverely limit the size of legitimate states. It is noteworthy that\nRousseau takes a different view in a text aimed at practical\npolitics: Considerations on the Government of\nPoland. Nevertheless, it is not entirely clear that the\nwidespread interpretation of Rousseau as rejecting all forms of\nrepresentative government is correct. One of the key distinctions\nin The Social Contract is between sovereign and\ngovernment. The sovereign, composed of the people as a whole,\npromulgates laws as an expression of its general will. The government\nis a more limited body that administers the state within the bounds\nset by the laws, and which issues decrees applying the laws in\nparticular cases. If the laws are conceived of as the people setting a\nconstitutional framework for society, with the government’s decrees\ncomprising the more normal business of “legislation,” then\nthe distance between a Rousseauian republic and a modern\nconstitutional democracy may be smaller than it at first\nappears. In effect, the institution of the sovereign may be\ninconsistent with a representative model, where the executive power of\nthe government can be understood as requiring it.  Such a picture\ngains credibility when the details of Rousseau’s views on government\nare examined. Although a variety of forms of government turn out to be\ntheoretically compatible with popular sovereignty, Rousseau is\nsceptical about the prospects for both democracy (where the people\nconduct the day to day running of the state and the application of the\nlaws) and monarchy. Instead, he favors some form of elective\naristocracy: in other words, he supports the idea that the day-to-day\nadministration should be in the hands of a subset of the population,\nelected by them according to merit. \n\nTwo important issues arise in relation to Rousseau’s account of\nrelations between sovereign and government. The first of these\nconcerns his political pessimism, even in the case of the\nbest-designed and most perfect republic. Just as any group has a\ncollective will as opposed to the individual private will of its\nmembers, so does the government. As the state becomes larger and more\ndiffuse, and as citizens become more distant from one another both\nspatially and emotionally, so the effective government of the republic\nwill need a proportionally smaller and more cohesive group of\nmagistrates. Rousseau thinks it almost inevitable that this group will\nend up usurping the legitimate sovereign power of the people and\nsubstituting its corporate will for the people’s general will. The\nsecond issue concerns how democratic Rousseau envisaged his republic\nto be. He sometimes suggests a picture in which the people would be\nsubject to elite domination by the government, since the magistrates\nwould reserve the business of agenda-setting for the assembly to\nthemselves. In other cases, he endorses a conception of a more fully\ndemocratic republic. (For competing views of this question see Fralin\n1978 and Cohen 2010.) \n\nAlthough Rousseau rejects Hobbes’s view of the sovereign as\nrepresenting or acting in the person of the subject, he has a similar\nview of what sovereignty is and its relation to the rights of the\nindividual. He rejects the idea that individuals associated together\nin a political community retain some natural rights over themselves\nand their property. Rather, such rights as individuals have over\nthemselves, land, and external objects, are a matter of sovereign\ncompetence and decision. Individual rights must be specified by the\nsovereign in ways that are compatible with the interests of all in a\njust polity, and Rousseau rejects the idea that such rights could be\ninsisted on as a check on the sovereign’s power. \n\nThe final full chapter of The Social Contract expounds\nRousseau’s doctrine of civil religion. Contemporary readers were\nscandalized by it, and particularly by its claim that true (original\nor early) Christianity is useless in fostering the spirit of\npatriotism and social solidarity necessary for a flourishing state. In\nmany ways the chapter represents a striking departure from the main\nthemes of the book. First, it is the only occasion where Rousseau\nprescribes the content of a law that a just republic must\nhave. Second, it amounts to his acceptance of the inevitability of\npluralism in matters of religion, and thus of religious toleration;\nthis is in some tension with his encouragement elsewhere of cultural\nhomogeneity as a propitious environment for the emergence of a general\nwill. Third, it represents a very concrete example of the limits of\nsovereign power: following Locke, Rousseau insists upon the inability\nof the sovereign to examine the private beliefs of citizens. The\ntenets of Rousseau’s civil religion include the affirmation of the\nexistence of a supreme being and of the afterlife, the principle that\nthe just will prosper and the wicked will be punished, and the claim\nthat the social contract and the laws are sacred.  In addition, the\ncivil religion requires the provision that all those willing to\ntolerate others should themselves be tolerated, but those who insist\nthat there is no salvation outside their particular church cannot be\ncitizens of the state. The structure of religious beliefs within the\njust state is that of an overlapping consensus: the dogmas of the\ncivil religion are such that they can be affirmed by adherents of a\nnumber of different faiths, both Christian and non-Christian. \n\nDespite Rousseau’s concern for religious toleration both in the\nchapter and elsewhere, modern readers have often been repelled by one\nstriking note of intolerance. Rousseau argues that those who cannot\naccept the dogmas can be banished from the state. This is because he\nbelieves that atheists, having no fear of divine punishment, cannot be\ntrusted by their fellow citizens to obey the law. He goes even further, to\nsuggest the death penalty for those who affirm the dogmas but later act\nas if they do not believe them. \n\nRousseau’s writings on language and languages are contained in\ntwo places, the unpublished Essay on the Origin of Languages\nand in a section of the Discourse on the Origins of\nInequality. In the Essay, Rousseau tells us that human\nbeings want to communicate as soon as they recognize that there are\nother beings like themselves. But he also raises the question of why\nlanguage, specifically, rather than gesture is needed for this purpose.\nThe answer, strangely enough, is that language permits the\ncommunication of the passions in a way that gesture does not, and that\nthe tone and stress of linguistic communication are crucial,\nrather than its content. This point enables Rousseau to make a close\nconnection between the purposes of speech and melody. Such vocabulary\nas there originally was, according to Rousseau, was merely figurative\nand words only acquire a literal meaning much later. Theories that\nlocate the origin of language in the need to reason together about\nmatters of fact are, according to Rousseau, deeply mistaken. While the\ncry of the other awakens our natural compassion and causes us to\nimagine the inner life of others, our purely physical needs have an\nanti-social tendency because they scatter human beings more widely\nacross the earth in search of subsistence. Although language and song\nhave a common origin in the need to communicate emotion, over time the\ntwo become separated, a process that becomes accelerated as a result of\nthe invention of writing. In the south, language stays closer to its\nnatural origins and southern languages retain their melodic and\nemotional quality (a fact that suits them for song and opera). Northern\nlanguages, by contrast, become oriented to more practical tasks and are\nbetter for practical and theoretical reasoning. \n\nIn Part I of the Second Discourse, Rousseau’s focus is slightly\ndifferent and occurs in the context of a polemic against philosophers\n(such as natural law theorists like Condillac) who attribute to primitive human beings\na developed capacity for abstract reasoning. Rousseau proposes need as\nthe cause of the development of language, but since language depends on\nconvention to assign arbitrary signs to objects, he puzzles about\nhow it could ever get started and how primitive people could\naccomplish the feat of giving names to universals. \n\nRousseau’s ideas about education are mainly expounded in\nEmile. In that work, he advances the idea of “negative\neducation”, which is a form of “child-centered” education. His\nessential idea is that education should be carried out, so far as\npossible, in harmony with the development of the child’s natural\ncapacities by a process of apparently autonomous discovery. This is in\ncontrast to a model of education where the teacher is a figure of\nauthority who conveys knowledge and skills according to a\npre-determined curriculum. Rousseau depends here on his thesis of\nnatural goodness, which he asserts at the beginning of the book, and\nhis educational scheme involves the protection and development of the\nchild’s natural goodness through various stages, along with the isolation of\nthe child from the domineering wills of others. Up to adolescence at\nleast, the educational program comprises a sequence of manipulations of\nthe environment by the tutor. The child is not told what to do or think\nbut is led to draw its own conclusions as a result of its own\nexplorations, the context for which has been carefully arranged. The\nfirst stage of the program starts in infancy, where Rousseau’s crucial\nconcern is to avoid conveying the idea that human relations are\nessentially ones of domination and subordination, an idea that can too\neasily by fostered in the infant by the conjunction of its own\ndependence on parental care and its power to get attention by crying.\nThough the young child must be protected from physical harm, Rousseau\nis keen that it gets used to the exercise of its bodily powers and he\ntherefore advises that the child be left as free as possible rather\nthan being confined or constrained. From the age of about twelve or so,\nthe program moves on to the acquisition of abstract skills and concepts.\nThis is not done with the use of books or formal lessons, but rather\nthrough practical experience. The third phase of education coincides\nwith puberty and early adulthood. The period of isolation comes to an\nend and the child starts to take an interest in others (particularly\nthe opposite sex), and in how he or she is regarded. At this stage\nthe great danger is that excessive amour propre will extend to\nexacting recognition from others, disregarding their worth, and demanding\nsubordination. The task of the tutor is to ensure that the pupil’s\nrelations with others are first mediated through the passion of\npitié (compassion) so that through the idea of\nthe suffering others, of care, and of gratitude, the pupil finds a secure place\nfor the recognition of his own moral worth where his amour\npropre is established on a non-competitive basis. The final period\nof education involves the tutor changing from a manipulator of the\nchild’s environment into the adult’s trusted advisor. The young and\nautonomous adult finds a spouse who can be another source of secure and\nnon-competitive recognition. This final phase also involves instruction\ninto the nature of the social world, including the doctrines of\nRousseau’s political philosophy. \n\nRousseau’s thinking has had a profound influence on later\nphilosophers and political theorists, although the tensions and\nambiguities in his work have meant that his ideas have been developed\nin radically incompatible and divergent ways. In modern political\nphilosophy, for example, it is possible to detect Rousseau as a source\nof inspiration for liberal theories, communitarian ideas, civic\nrepublicanism, and in theories of deliberative and participatory\ndemocracy. Hostile writers have portrayed Rousseau as a source of\ninspiration for the more authoritarian aspects of the French revolution\nand thence for aspects of fascism and communism. \n\nRousseau’s most important philosophical impact was on Immanuel Kant.\nA portrait of Rousseau was the only image on display in Kant’s house,\nand legend has it that the only time that Kant forgot to take his daily\nwalk was when reading Emile. Instances of direct influence\ninclude Kant’s idea of the categorical imperative, the third\nformulation of which in the Groundwork of the Metaphysic of\nMorals (the so-called formula of the kingdom of ends) recalls\nRousseau’s discussion of the general will in The Social\nContract. Ironically, Kant’s detachment of the idea of\nuniversal legislation from its context in the particularity of single\nsociety reverses Rousseau’s own approach, since Rousseau had, in\npreparatory work for The Social Contract rejected the idea of\na general will of the human race as that notion appeared in Diderot’s\narticle “Natural Right” in the Encyclopédie.\nRousseau’s influence can also be seen in Kant’s moral psychology,\nespecially in work such as Religion Within the Limits of Reason\nAlone, in Kant’s own thinking about conjectural history, and in\nhis writings on international justice which draw on Rousseau’s\nengagement with the work of the Abbé St. Pierre. \n\nThe cases of Hegel and Marx are more complex. Hegel’s direct\nreferences to Rousseau are often uncomplimentary. In\nthe Philosophy of Right, while praising Rousseau for the idea\nthat will is the basis of the state, he misrepresents the idea of the\ngeneral will as being merely the idea of the overlap between the\ncontingent wills of private individuals. In the Encyclopedia\nLogic he demonstrates an awareness that this was not Rousseau’s\nview. Hegel’s discussion of the master-slave dialectic and the problem\nof recognition in the Phenomenology of Spirit also draws on\nRousseau, in this case on the notion of amour propre and the\nways in which attempts to exact respect and recognition from others\ncan be self-defeating. Karl Marx’s concerns with alienation and\nexploitation have also been thought to bear some kind of relationship\nto Rousseau’s thinking on related topics. Here the evidence is more\nindirect, since the references to Rousseau in Marx’s work are few and\ninsubstantial. \n\nIn contemporary political philosophy, it is clear that the thinking\nof John Rawls, especially in A Theory of Justice reflects the\ninfluence of Rousseau. A good example of this is the way in which Rawls\nuses the device of the “original position” to put self-interested\nchoice at the service of the determination of the principles of\njustice. This exactly parallels Rousseau’s argument that citizens will\nbe drawn to select just laws as if from an impartial perspective,\nbecause the universality and generality of the law means that when\nconsidering their own interests they will select the measure that best\nreflects their own interests.","contact.mail":"c.bertram@bristol.ac.uk","contact.domain":"bristol.ac.uk"}]
