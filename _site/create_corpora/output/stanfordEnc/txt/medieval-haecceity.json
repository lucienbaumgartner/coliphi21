As understood\nby Scotus, a haecceity is not a bare particular in the sense of\nsomething underlying qualities. It is, rather, a\nnon-qualitative property of a substance or thing: it is a\n“thisness” (a haecceitas, from the Latin haec,\nmeaning “this”) as opposed to a “whatness” (a\nquidditas, from the Latin quid, meaning\n“what”). Furthermore, substances, on the sort of\nmetaphysics defended by Scotus, are basically collections of tightly\nunified properties, all but one of them qualitative; the one\nnon-qualitative property is the haecceity. In contrast to more modern\naccounts of the problem of individuation, Scotus holds that the\nhaecceity explains more than just the distinction of one substance\nfrom another. According to Scotus, the fact that individual substances\ncannot be instantiated — are indivisible or incommunicable, as\nScotus puts it — also requires explaining. In short a haecceity\nis supposed to explain individuality.\n\n\n The possible existence of such non-qualitative properties as\nexplanations of numerical distinction between substances can be made\nplausible by considering a famous counterexample to the identity of\nindiscernibles suggested by Max Black. A wants to defend\nthe principle, and B attack it, and B does so by\nproposing the following case: \n Clearly, if Leibniz's Law is understood — as Leibniz intended\n— to assert that any two individuals must differ in some qualitative\nor relational way, B's counterexample seems sufficient to refute\nit. But on the face of it there is an easy answer available to\nA. For A could assert that the two spheres differ in\nsome property neither qualitative nor relational: they could differ by\nhaecceity. This leaves intact a trivial reading of Leibniz\n(that if individual x is distinct from individual y,\nthen there must be some property had by x and not by y,\nor vice versa), and thus the obviously true version of the principle\nsecure. (Haecceities may not be the only way to preserve the principle\nagainst B's counterexample. But the solution gives some\nprima facie plausibility to the possibility of\nhaecceities.) \n Theories of haecceities may want to assign more or less ontological\nweight to haecceities, and, indeed, to properties in general. Medieval\naccounts of forms, properties, and predicates tend to make a\ndistinction between those predicates that involve some sort of\nontological commitment, and those that do not — that is to say,\nbetween those that signify some kind of metaphysical constituent of\nsubstances, and those that do not. In this context, the relevant\nmetaphysical constituents would for a medieval thinker most naturally\nbe understood as forms, corresponding to Aristotle's division of the\ncategories. A form F-ness of a substance or substrate x\nis a particular, naturally dependent on x, in virtue of which\nx is F. For Scotus, however, there is a further\ngroup of metaphysical constituents, labeled by him\n‘formalities’, or ‘realities’: not concrete\nthings (“res”) but abstract realities\n— abstract particulars — with some kind of real being,\nsuch that a subject of such formalities is inseparable from them, and\nthey from it. We could label an account of predicates that does not\ninvolve any commitment to such kinds of metaphysical constituents\n— whether forms or formalities — nominalist, and think of\nsuch a nominalist account of properties as something distinct from a\nnominalist account of universals. Nominalism on the question of\nuniversals does not require nominalism on the question of properties\nas such. Properties could, after all, be as particular as the\nsubstances of which they are properties. According to Scotus,\nhaecceities and essences are distinct real properties of\nsubstances. Scotus is not, in other words, a nominalist about these\nproperties. But such a realist account of these properties is not\nnecessary for my easy refutation of B; it would be possible\nto hold that there is no purely qualitative or relational criterion\nfor identity without holding that haecceities are metaphysical\ningredients of things. It is possible to argue that any medieval\nopponents of haecceities (in Scotus's robust sense) in fact covertly\naccept this weaker form of haecceitism — and thus that at least\npart of the debate between Scotus and his later opponents has to do\nwith the status of properties as such, rather than the question of\nindividuation. \nSo haecceities are bare particulars, but they are not supposed to\nunderlie properties. Some medieval Aristotelians hold that matter,\nconstrued as a substrate for forms and properties, individuates; and\nit would be possible to hold that the individuation of a substance is\nexplained by some bare particular that underlies properties. Scotus\nrejects the view that matter could be responsible for individuation,\non the grounds that we require too an explanation for the\nindividuation of (chunks of) matter (Scotus, Ordinatio II,\nd. 3, p. 1, qq. 5–6, n. 187 (Scotus [OO], 7:483; Spade (1994),\n106–107)). Neither would Scotus have been able to make any sense\nof a bare particular in the sense of a bare possessor of qualities, a\nview that would doubtless have struck him as inconsistent with\nessentialism (on this, see Park [1990]). But, as Scotus sees it, the\nmore nominalist view of haecceities is not available to him, and the\nreason is that he is a realist on the question of\nuniversals. Basically, the reality of shared natures entails, for\nScotus, that individuation is explained by some real property distinct\nfrom the nature. First, then, we have to provide an explanation of\nScotus's theory of common natures, followed, in a third section, by a\ndescription of the theory of haecceity and the relation of these two\ntheories to each other. \n Building on insights gained through the thirteenth century, Scotus\ndistinguishes two closely related issues in individuation: explaining\nhow a substance is such that it cannot be instantiated (explaining its\nindividuality, its “indivisibility in itself”), and\nexplaining how a substance is such that it is distinct from all other\nsubstances (explaining its “division from others”; on this\nsee Park [1988]). The first of these is on the face of it far more\ncomplex, and requires certain moves to be made in the theory of\nuniversals. For various complex historical reasons, medieval realists\ntend to suppose that common (shared) natures or essences are\nsomehow divided into their instantiations — as Scotus\nputs it, divided into “subjective parts.” It is not easy\nto explain precisely what this divisibility amounts to. Explaining\nboth divisibility and its opposite, Scotus states the problem of\nindividuation as follows: \nI have italicized the relevant portions here. A universal (a\ncommon nature, in Scotus's technical parlance) is\n“divided into several parts each of which is it.” As\nScotus sees it, individuality and numerical unity or singularity are\nco-extensive. Since the nature is not individual, it is not\nnumerically one thing: it has \"less-than-numerical\" unity: \nOn the one hand, the doctrine is not supposed to be obscure. The basic\nthought is that a common nature cannot be numerically singular —\nif it were, it would be a particular, and the distinction between\nuniversals and particulars would simply break down. (Of course,\nsomeone accepting the numerical identity of a universal in its various\ninstantiations could propose some other way to distinguish particulars\nand universals as subsets of the class of singular things.) The\nthought that numerical singularity could be proper to particulars does\nnot seem especially startling; Scotus's account of common natures is\nan attempt to develop the insight given that nominalism is\nfalse. Still, on the other hand, understanding exactly what Scotus has\nin mind here is not a straightforward matter (on this, see Cross\n[2003]). Clearly, the sense should be that the whole common nature is\nin each instantiation of it. But the whole common nature is not to be\nunderstood to be identically (numerically) the same in each\ninstantiation, as Scotus makes clear elsewhere, and as in any case we\nmight expect, given the part-whole language that Scotus uses in the\npassage just quoted. It seems as though there are both intensional and\nextensional aspects to the nature: intensionally, it is fully in each\ninstantiation, but extensionally the nature somehow becomes many on\ninstantiation. (Not just: comes to exist in many things, unless this\nbe construed to mean that the nature becomes many when it comes to\nexist in many things.) At least from an extensional point of view,\nthere is more to humanity than just what is found in me.  Another way\nof thinking about the relevant relation might be to think of natures\nas in some sense ‘content’, and each individual as the\n‘carrier’ of this content. The nature, as far as its\ncontent is concerned, is fully in each carrier of the content, but is\nmultiplied in its carriers (such that each carrier bears fully the\nsame content, and so the same one content becomes many in its\ncarriers, just as the content of a book is multiplied in its several\ncopies). \n Why should we accept this sort of account of universals? Scotus\ndefends it in the context of a rejection of a theory according to\nwhich the singularity of a nature requires no explanation other than\nthe nature itself.  The theory is in principle capable of development\nin one of two different directions, and Scotus seems to regard it as a\nmatter of indifference which of these two directions his opponent has\nin mind. One direction is nominalist: there could be individual\nnatures (of the same kind), and each such nature be of itself\nparticular. The other is extreme realist: there could be indivisible\nPlatonic universals, and each such universal be of itself numerically\nsingular. As Scotus sees it, the only way to explain both\ninstantiability and commonality of kind is to posit the existence of\nentities (viz. natures) that are divisible. It is the divisibility of\nthe nature that allows its instantiability, and the unity of the\nnature that explains commonality of kind. Platonism lacks\ninstantiability, and nominalism lacks an explanation for commonality\nof kind. Scotus makes the crucial claim about natures as follows:\n \nHere the premises speak of Scotus's “less than numerical\nunity,” the unity of something that is divisible into\nnumerically many subjective parts. Scotus provides a total of seven\narguments in favor of the minor premise — in favor, in other\nwords, of the position that there is something with\nless-than-numerical unity. Four of these appeal to Aristotelian\nauthority, and of these the third is most interesting:\n \nThe point here is that relations of similarity between two particulars\ncannot be self-explanatory; they must have some explanation (some\n“real foundation”) in the things that are similar. This is\namongst other things an argument against resemblance nominalism. But\nit is also supposed to be an argument against the view that a\nuniversal could be numerically identical in each instantiation. Since\nit is the universal that is supposed to explain the relation of\nsimilarity, positing that the universal is numerically identical in\neach instantiation might lead merely to the conclusion that the\nuniversal in each instantiation is similar to itself.  But\nthat is not what needs to be explained. (Despite the way he talks,\nScotus does not mean here to deny that similarity is a reflexive\nrelation; his view is that reflexivity is a property merely of what\nthe medievals labeled “rational relations,” and that the\nsimilarity that obtains between two distinct objects is not such a\nrational relation. The point is not worth dwelling on.) \n Of the arguments from reason (rather than from the authority of\nAristotle), one particularly focuses on a claim with which Ockham\nwill, a few years later, strongly disagree:  \n The obvious claim here is supposed to be that not all real diversity\nis numerical, and Scotus supports it by claiming that, if the only way\nin which things differed were numerical, then all things would be\nequally distinct. But there are degrees of distinction: Socrates and\nPlato are not distinguished in species, for example, as we can tell\nfrom our capacity to abstract. Unity and diversity here are\ninter-definable contradictories, so it is not the case that every real\nunity is numerical unity. Of course, Scotus is supposing that there\nare in some sense real (i.e. non-conventional) species. Clearly,\nScotus is trying to force a nominalist opponent into accepting\nconventionalism. His argument, if successful, will thus damage those\nnominalists — such as most medieval nominalists — who want\nto deny conventionalism. \n Much of the account of common natures can be found in nuce\nin Aquinas's De ente et essentia. But Scotus's account is\nusually thought to diverge from Aquinas's in at least one crucial\nway. According to both Scotus and Aquinas — following some\nsuggestions in Avicenna — it is possible to consider a nature in\nitself, abstracting both from its existence as a universal concept and\nas the particulars into which it is divided. (Hence Avicenna's famous\nslogan “equinity is just equinity”: Avicenna, Liber de\nscientia divina, V, c. 1 (Avicenna [LPP], 2:228–229).)\nAquinas is clear that this bare nature lacks numerical unity (see\nAquinas, De ente et essentia, c. 3 (Aquinas [DEE],\n24–25)). Aquinas does not believe, however, that the nature as\nthus described has any sort of being or existence — and it is on\nthis point that Scotus diverges from him. It is perhaps worth noting,\nin passing, that a plausible case can be made for tracing this\nmoderate sort of realism on the question of universals to the\nAristotelian tradition (specifically, Alexander of Aphrodisias: see\nTweedale [1993]). One might also argue, as his famous commentator\nCajetan did, that Aquinas would after all be willing to attribute some\nsort of unity and proportionally some sort of being to the absolutely\nconsidered nature, even if he denies to it numerical unity and the\ncorresponding actual, real existence. For Cajetan's exposition of the\nissue, carefully distinguishing Aquinas's from Scotus's position, and\nfor useful references to both authors, see Cajetan [CBE], c. 4\n(nn. 55–62), pp. 134–155.  Scotus, while clearly in this\nsame tradition, evidently considers the sort of account found in\nAquinas to be insufficient, and thus is far more clearly to be placed\nin the realist camp than Aquinas on this question. Thus, far from\nholding that the nature in itself lacks any kind of reality, Scotus\nholds that the primary reality of the nature belongs to the nature in\nitself. I have already quoted a passage in which Scotus correlates the\nnature's less than numerical unity with its primary entity or\nbeing. \nThe reason that the common nature — has some kind of existence\nor (as he puts it) entity is that the nature is supposed to be subject\nto the accidental modification of existing as this or that particular,\nand it is not possible for the subject of a real modification not\nitself to be real:\n \nSo in order to possess in itself this non-numerical unity, the nature\nmust have, in itself, some sort of being too, proportional to it (such\nthat the real entity of the nature is diminished in proportion to the\ndiminished real unity that it has). Scotus does not mean that the\nnature is some sort of universal ante rem; if there were no\ninstantiations, there would be no nature, but once there are\ninstantiations there is too some subject for instantiation (the\nnature), and this subject has some sort of being in itself. Indeed,\nthis subject is in some sense prior (but not temporally prior) to its\ninstantiations: while the identity of its instantiations depends on\nit, its identity does not depend on those of its instantiations. (It\nmakes no difference to the identity of human nature whether or not I\nexist, though the reality of human nature certainly requires that at\nleast one human being exist: see Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, q. 1, n. 34 (Scotus [OO], 7:404; Spade (1994), 64).) As\ninstantiated, the nature receives the (accidental) modification of\nbeing numerically many in numerically many things.   \n Common natures have non-numerical unity, and are thus in the relevant\nsense divisible. As Scotus sees it, the fundamental issue to be\nexplained by haecceity is that of indivisibility:\n \n The point is not just that an account of numerical singularity in\ngeneral is required (the “indeterminate unity by which anything in a\nspecies is said to be one in number”). What is required, rather, is an\naccount of the individuality of any given particular, and this account\nwill explain its being indivisible into subjective parts. (Scotus does\nnot use the term ‘haecceity’ [haecceitas] in the\nwork that I am using here — the\nOrdinatio.  He talks rather about the individual difference, or\nindividual entity. But he does elsewhere talk about this entity as a\nhaecceitas [a term of Scotus's own invention]: for the\nchange in terminology, see Dumont [1995]). \n Divisibility into subjective parts, of course, is on the face of it\nvery different from the question of division from all other things, so\nnicely exemplified in Black's example of the qualitatively identical\nspheres.  Scotus's assumption, however, is that both questions can be\nanswered in the same way. Thus Scotus supposes that the explanation\nfor distinction is the explanation for indivisibility, and the rough\noutline of what he is thinking looks as follows. The explanation for\ndistinction is primary, in the sense that what distinction needs is\nexplanation by items that are irreducibly numerically distinct from\neach other — as Scotus puts it, “primarily diverse” (primo\ndiversa), and have nothing real whatever in common: “they agree\nin nothing the same” (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1,\nqq. 5–6, n. 186 (Scotus [OO], 7:483; Spade (1994), 106)). (This\ndoes not entail that the things thus distinguished have nothing\nwhatever in common. Scotus’s point is that the haecceity is\nneeded as a constituent of a being that shares its nature with\nsomething else in the manner described in the previous section.)\nAccording to Scotus, numerical distinction — as opposed to (say)\nspecific distinction — entails that each of the things\ndistinguished has numerical singularity. And numerical singularity\nentails indivisibility (into subjective parts), for what allows a\ncommon nature to be divided (into subjective parts) is its possession\nof less-than-numerical unity.  \n The claim that the explanations for indivisibility and distinction\nare the same gains some plausibility from an analogy with the\ndistinction between different specific differences in relation to a\ngenus — an analogue that Scotus evidently regards as less\ncontroversial, and more familiar to his readers. A specific difference\ndistinguishes two different species of a genus from each other. But\nthe specific difference is — as all agree — likewise explanatory of\nthe impossibility of a species being divided into sub-species.  Scotus\nin fact uses at some length the analogy to a specific difference to\ntry to explicate his own theory of haecceity. A specific difference is\nsomething indivisible into further species, and, indeed, explanatory\nof a species's indivisibility into further species (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5–6, n. 177 (Scotus [OO],\n7:478; Spade (1994), 103–104)). Equally, an ultimate specific\ndifference is “primarily diverse” from any other, in the\nsense that such a specific difference “has a concept that is\nabsolutely simple” (and thus cannot even overlap with the\nconcept of any other such difference) (Scotus, Ordinatio II,\nd. 3, p. 1, qq. 5–6, n. 183 (Scotus [OO], 7:481; Spade (1994),\n105)). It does not seem overly puzzling that a specific difference\ncould perform these two functions: the absolute conceptual simplicity\nof any ultimate specific difference seems to entail both distinction\nfrom every other specific difference, and its indivisibility into any\nfurther species. And Scotus believes that these sorts of consideration\ncan help explicate the function of a haecceity relative to\nindividuation too. That is to say, he believes that something wholly\ndevoid of common (shared) conceptual content — a haecceity\n— can explain not only indivisibility into further particulars,\nbut also distinction from all other particulars\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5–6, n. 177\n(Scotus [OO], 7:478; Spade (1994), 103–104); n. 183 (Scotus\n[OO], 7:481; Spade (1994), 105)). \n So Scotus holds that the explanations for indivisibility and\ndistinction are the same. To understand why he supposes that this\nexplanation needs to be something real, we need to keep in mind his\ntheory of the reality of common natures, for the reality of common\nnatures is a premiss in Scotus’s defense of the existence of\nhaecceities. Since such natures are real, Scotus reasons, the\nhaecceities that tie such natures to individuals must be equally real\ntoo: \n And later Scotus notes that it “does not seem probable”\nthat the common nature has some kind of entity and yet that the\nindividuating feature does not. (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, qq. 5–6, n. 178 (Scotus [OO], 7:478–479;\nSpade (1994), 104)) \nScotus elsewhere considers the view of Henry of Ghent that the\nexplanation for individuation could be merely a negation. The point\nabout a negation is that it is not in any way real: it is not\na thing, or a real form or property of a thing. As Scotus sees it,\nclaiming that individuation could be by a negation is just a way of\nrestating the problem, not of proposing an explanatory solution to it\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 2, n. 49 (Scotus [OO],\n7:413; Spade (1994), 69)). In fact, Scotus takes himself to have not\nmerely an explanation for individuation, but also an explanation for\nidentity. The contrast with modern accounts of haecceities is thus\nquite sharp. In much modern literature, an item's haecceity is simply\nthe primitive property of being that item, or being identical with\nthat item. For Scotus, the haecceity is supposed to explain\nthat property. (See further discussion of this in section 6\nbelow.) \n Supposing that a haecceity is something real, where does it fit into\nthe range of things that exist? Is it, for example, a form, or\nsomething else?  According to Scotus, it is something like a form, and\nsometimes, indeed, he calls it such (while elsewhere denying the same\nclaim: on these insignificant terminological shifts, see Dumont\n[1995]). The reason is that a haecceity is clearly something like a\nproperty of a thing — hence like a form — but is at the same time\nwholly devoid of any correspondence to any conceptual contents. It is\nnot at all a qualitative feature of a thing — not at all a\n“quidditative” feature, in the technical vocabulary. As\nirreducibly particular, it shares no real feature in common with any\nother thing. This does not mean that haecceities cannot fall under\nthe extension of a concept. Being an individuating feature is\nnot a real property of a haecceity (it cannot be, since any haecceity\nis wholly simple, and shares no real features with any other thing);\nbut any concept of what a haecceity is certainly includes among its\ncomponents being an individuating feature. A concept of a\nhaecceity includes representations merely of logical, not real,\nfeatures of any haecceity. \n Scotus's position on the reality of both the nature and the\nhaecceity seems to raise a number of problems. Perhaps the most acute\n— a problem which Scotus himself raises — is this:\n \n This is what has come to be known as Ockham's problem (see King\n[1992], 51): how can the nature as instantiated retain its\nnon-numerical unity? Scotus's apparent solution is that the nature in\nitself has non-numerical unity, but that as existent in particulars it\nhas, in each particular, numerical unity.  Scotus thus — consistent\nwith his basic insight — believes that the nature has two different\nsorts of extramental existence: \n Numerical unity somehow inheres (over and over again) in the common\nnature (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5–6, n. 173\n(Scotus [OO], 7:477; Spade (1994), 103)), so that the nature is\nin itself non-numerically one, and denominatively\nnumerically one in any given instantiation.  Denominative predication\nobtains in the case that the predicate is true of the subject as the\nresult of the subject's possession of some further, accidental,\nfeature. Thus, qualifying the predication as “denominative” in this\nway does not make the predication any less real. Being accidentally\nnumerically one is a case of being numerically one, not of being\nnon-numerically one, and what Scotus is really trying to say is that\nthe nature in this particular is indeed really (though\naccidentally) numerically one. (Note that the denominative numerical\nsingularity of the nature in the particular is still compatible with\nthe common nature's being numerically one in some other particular,\nand this is because the nature in itself (not as in this or that\nparticular) is less-than-numerically one (Scotus, Ordinatio II,\nd. 3, p. 1, q. 1, n.  34 (Scotus [OO], 7:404-405; Spade (1994),\n64)). Being non-numerically one, then, is presumably compatible both\nwith being accidentally numerically one in any one instantiation, and\naccidentally numerically many in more than one instantiation.) \n Scotus explains his position by exploiting the analogy between a\nhaecceity or individual difference, and a specific difference:\n \n This gives us, in effect, three entities in addition to the common\nnature (the nature in itself): the nature-in-the-particular, the\nindividual difference or haecceity, and the particular itself. Setting\naside the common nature, since the nature-in-the-particular is simply\nan accidental modification of the common nature, Scotus holds that\nthere is some sort of distinction between all three of these entities:\nthe nature-in-the-particular and the haecceity are something like\ncomponents of the particular itself. These two components are\ndistinct, in the sense that one (the nature-in-the-particular) is\nmerely denominatively one, whereas the other (the haecceity) is per\nse and primarily one (that is to say, essentially one in such a\nway that there can be no further explanation for its unity). Scotus\nhere invokes his famous “formal” distinction. Clearly, the\nnature-in-the-particular and the haecceity are something like\n(necessary) properties or features of a particular. Scotus is, as we\nhave seen, a realist about these features (on the grounds that,\notherwise, they could perform no explanatory role of the kind they are\nsupposed to perform). And they clearly are not the same feature. So\nthere must be some kind of distinction between them. This distinction\ncannot be real: the features are not separable from each other any\nmore than they are separable from themselves; neither are they\nanything like discrete parts of some whole. They are, as Scotus puts\nit, “formally distinct”: \n The formal distinction in this context is fundamentally a way of\ndistinguishing the necessary properties of a particular substance, in\ncases where the natures of which the substances are instantiations are\nnot coextensive. Given this, what sort of relation “ties”\nthese two formally distinct components together? Scotus suggests that\nthis relation is real (i.e.  numerical) sameness, a kind of unity\nfalling short of absolute identity (Scotus, Ordinatio I,\nd. 2, p. 2, qq. 1–4, n. 403 (Scotus [OO], 2:356)). This sameness\nis presumably something rather like the relation of compresence found\nin Russell and others, though unlike compresence, real identity is not\nonly symmetrical but also transitive (see Tweedale [1999],\n2:463–464). Scotus is able to claim transitivity for the\nrelation of real sameness since, as we have seen, he believes that the\ncommon nature instantiated in two distinct particulars does not itself\nhave real (i.e. numerical) identity (see Tweedale [1999], 488). The\nhaeeceity and the nature in the particular can thus be really the same\nwithout different concrete particulars of the same kind being really\nthe same as each other. \nWhat should we say about the indiscernibility of identicals in these\nkinds of case (real identity, formal distinction)? Haecceities explain\nthe identity of the complete concrete objects that they compose. So\ncomplete concrete objects have self-identity. So too does each of the\nformalities that compose such a concrete object. But these formalities\nare discernible from each other. Real sameness falls short of absolute\nidentity. (I discuss some of these issues, and others related to the\nvarieties of distinction in Scotus, in Cross [2004].) \n Given the huge problems that such an account seems to raise, it is\nworth seeing just why Scotus believes he needs to accept\nit. Basically, his argument for haecceities depends on his view of\nindividuation as, fundamentally, a matter of explaining indivisibility\n(into subjective parts). Scotus defends haecceities by rejecting all\nalternative theories of individuation known to him. Rejecting\nqualitative theories is easy for the scholastics. Suppose that all\nthings of a given kind in some sense share the same nature. The nature\nas such cannot explain individuation. So the explanation must be\nsomehow non-essential. But non-essential qualitative or accidental\nfeatures of a thing are posterior to the thing itself, since although\nthe substance must have some accidental features, precisely which ones\nit has is a matter of historical chance (Scotus, Ordinatio II,\nd. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n.  87 (Scotus [OO], 7:432-433; Spade (1994),\n79)). Things are not identical with their life-stories (on this, see\nCross [1999b]). Indeed, Scotus goes so far as to suggest that the\naccidents of a substance — at least, its quantities, qualities, and\nrelations — are individuated by their own haecceities, something that\nis not often spotted in the commentaries (on this, see Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n. 89 (Scotus [OO], 7:434;\nSpade (1994), 79–80)). The great 17th century Scotist, John\nPoncius, extends this claim to cover even so-called propria,\nnecessary but non-defining properties: paradigmatically, a capacity to\nsmile in human beings (see Poncius, Disputatio Metaphysica VI,\nq. 9 [Poncius (1659), 138b]). \n But this far from exhausts the options, and Scotus considers a number\nof non-qualitative theories too. In addition to the two theories\ndiscussed above, to the effect that things just are individuals\n(either through the nature itself, or through the negation of\ndivision), he considers a view according to which existence\nindividuates, and two views according to which the explanation for\nindividuation is matter, respectively matter as such, and matter +\nextension.  Actual existence, perhaps a prima facie plausible\nnon-qualitative or non-essential feature of a thing, is rejected by\nScotus as an individuator on the grounds that existence as such — as\nopposed to the things that exist — does not seem to be different from\ncase to case: in itself, it seems wholly undifferentiated (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 3, n. 61 (Scotus [OO],\n7:418–419; Spade (1994), 72–73)).  Nothing about existence\nseems irreducibly particular in the way required. \n Perhaps the most interesting non-qualitative approach is the theory,\noften associated with Aquinas (but attacked by Scotus in the forms\npresented by Godfrey of Fontaines and Giles of Rome), that\nindividuation is by extended matter: by, as we might say,\nchunks of matter. Scotus's way of understanding the\nproblem of individuation becomes important in his rejection of this\ntheory. For his fundamental strategy against this sort of material\nindividuation is that such a theory, while it may be able to explain\nnumerical distinction, certainly cannot explain indivisibility: \n Scotus has other arguments too, most notably variants of the theme\nthat the same chunk of matter (matter + extension) seems to persist\nthrough substantial change, and thus not to be sufficient as an\naccount of individuation (see Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, q. 4, nn. 77–81 (Scotus [OO], 7:427–429; Spade\n(1994), 77)). Individuation on Scotus’s view is not,\nfundamentally, a case of instantiating forms in matter. \n Thus far, haecceity has been considered entirely in the context of a\nvery distinctive moderately realist theory of universals, one\naccording to which universals fail to be (numerically) identical in\nall their particulars. Thus, as Scotus presents it, one of the\nmotivations for positing haecceities — and perhaps the only one given\nthe variety of other possible accounts of individuation — is to\nexplain numerical indivisibility (the numerical identity of a\nparticular).  Modern accounts of universals do not on the whole accept\nthat universals have, in themselves, the strange kind of non-numerical\nidentity that Scotus supposes. Could haecceities have any relevance in\nthis sort of context?  Presumably haecceities would not be needed to\nexplain indivisibility, since everything — whether particular or\nuniversal — is indivisible in the required sense (numerically\nindivisible; numerically identical in anything in which it\nexists). Could haecceities be required to explain numerical\ndistinction (from every other particular, in the case of particulars,\nand from every other universal, in the case of universals)?\nHaecceities would not be required to explain the identity of a\nuniversal, since the identity of a universal can clearly be fixed\nalong merely qualitative lines. Haecceities could be required to\nexplain the identity of particulars (i.e. their distinction from all\nother particulars), provided that such identity can be explained\nneither qualitatively nor materially (as it is on most rival\naccounts). For example, one modern realist, Richard Swinburne, denies\nthat haecceities are required to individuate material substances\n(since matter can individuate these), but claims nevertheless that\nhaecceities are required to individuate immaterial substances, if such\nthere be (Swinburne [1994], 33–50). \n Scotus adopts such a realist theory of universals in one case — that\nof the Trinity. The divine essence cannot be divisible in the way that\na creaturely common nature is, since then — given that there are\nthree divine persons — there would be more than one God, more than\none instance of a nature divided into many. Generally, Scotus accepts\nthe standard view that the three divine persons are distinct by their\nrelations. But he is happy too to countenance the view that the three\ndivine persons could be distinct by non-relational properties (on\nthis, see conveniently Cross [1999a], 65–67).  Such properties could\npresumably be qualitative, provided that, as a matter of necessity, no\ndivine person shares precisely the same set of distinguishing\nfeatures. But they could be non-qualitative, and in this case Scotus\nwould have something analogous to a haecceity responsible for\ndistinguishing each divine person. (“Analogous to,” because\nthe relevant property would explain distinction but not\nindivisibility, on the grounds that the persons are exemplifications\nof an indivisible essence — of an essence that is numerically the\nsame in each of them. Indeed, Scotus holds that, in this context, it\nis not appropriate to think of the divine persons as individuals at\nall, in the sense that they are not instances of a divided nature.) In\nthis case, a non-qualitative property would be responsible for\nexplaining distinction, but not for explaining indivisibility. \n Acceptance of haecceities is a distinctive feature of the thought of\nmany followers of Scotus, though there are some sixteenth-century\nscholastics who accept haecceities without accepting many other\ndistinctively Scotist teachings.  Having said this, some early\nfollowers of Scotus reject haecceities and the theory of the common\nnature altogether, and of those who accept haecceities, some found the\ncorrect understanding of the nature of the distinction between an\nindividual's nature and its haecceity a troublesome matter. One\nof the earliest Scotists, Francis of Meyronnes, writing his commentary\non the Sentences around 1320, accepts the theory of the\nnon-numerical unity of common natures (In Sent. II, d. 34, q. 3\n[Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 157rbG]), and the claim that\nindividuation is by haecceity (In Sent. II, d. 34, q. 4\n[Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 157vaK-L]; I, d. 3, q. 4\n[Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 18raA]). But he holds that it\nis inappropriate to talk of a formal distinction in this context.\nFormal distinction obtains only between things that have some sort of\nquidditative content (In Sent. I, d.  8, q. 5 [(1520),\n48vbQ-49raB]). Haecceities have no such\nquidditative content (In Sent. I, d.  8, q. 5 [(1520),\n48rbG]), and thus cannot be formally distinct from their\nnature. Rather, a haecceity is modally distinct from its nature\n(In Sent.  II, d. 34, q. 3 [(1520), 157vaL]). A\nmodal distinction, according to Meyronnes, obtains between a thing and\nan intrinsic mode of that thing, where an intrinsic mode is something\nwhich “when added to a thing does not vary its formal definition\n… since it does not of itself imply any quiddity or formal\ndefinition” (In Sent. I, d. 42, q. 3 [(1520),\n120vaL; 120vbO]; see too In Sent. I,\nd. 8, q. 5 [(1520), 49rbE]). A haecceity does not affect a\nthing’s kind; it is thus an intrinsic mode of the thing. \n It may look as though this is just a terminological shift, but it is\nnot so in at least the following way: a modal distinction is a lesser\nkind of distinction than a formal distinction. Formal distinctions\nobtain between genus and specific difference; thus, the difference\nbetween species/nature and haecceity, for Meyronnes, is less than the\ndifference between genus and difference. Scotus, contrariwise, makes\nno such distinction between degrees of difference in this context (for\nthis contrast between the two thinkers, see Dumont [1987], 18). Still,\nwithout some principled way of spelling out degrees of difference,\nthis contrast between Scotus and Meyronnes amounts to nothing of any\nphilosophical interest. To this extent the difference between the two\nthinkers might as well be merely terminological, and Meyronnes needs\nto do more work if he is to make any significant philosophical point\nhere. \n Amongst baroque scholastics, the most notable adherent of haecceities\nis the Jesuit Peter Fonseca (1528–1599), whose monumental commentary\non Aristotle's Metaphysics (Fonseca [1599]) includes an\nextensive discussion of haecceities. (Fonseca, with something of a\nhumanist background, worries about the barbarous nature of Scotus's\nneologism, and suggests in passing that 'haeccity'\n[haeccitas] would have been a more comfortable formulation\n[In Met. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 1 (Fonseca [1599], vol. 2,\ncol. 381D)] — compare ‘quiddity.’) Like many of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth-century scholastics, Fonseca — most\nnotable for coming up with a theory of divine “middle knowledge” at\nmuch the same time as Molina — is not a follower of any one\nearlier philosopher, preferring to learn from any of his predecessors\non various points as he sees fit. According to Fonseca, \n Fonseca engages particularly with the rejection of haecceities in the\nThomist Cajetan (most notably in Cajetan's commentary on Aquinas's\nDe ente, c. 2, q. 5, nn. 33–36 (Cajetan [CBE],\n94–98)). Cajetan worries that haecceities need to be in some\nsense similar to each other — and specifically that the\nhaecceities of Socrates and Plato must be more similar than the\nhaecceities of Plato and some white patch (Cajetan, In de\nente, c. 2, q. 5, n. 36 (Cajetan [CBE], 97); see Fonseca, In\nMet. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2,\ncol. 185C-D]). According to Fonseca, haecceities are similar to each\nother without having anything real in common: they are thus primarily\ndiverse in the required sense, even though the haecceities of Socrates\nand Plato are more similar than the haecceities of Plato and some\nwhite patch (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca\n(1599), vol. 2, col. 185E-F]). More generally, Fonseca (rightly) holds\nthat exact similarity between two haecceities would entail that the\ntwo haecceities were numerically identical (Fonseca, In\nMet. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2,\ncol. 185B]). \n Fonseca is convinced of the reality of haecceities because he accepts\nthe view that common natures have in themselves a certain sort of\nunity prior to instantiation, although — more like Aquinas than\nScotus — he does not believe the nature as such to have any sort of\nreal existence other than as instantiated. Fonseca proposes that, in\norder to have real existence, something needs to be added to the\nnature — a haecceity (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect.\n4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 966A]). Again, Fonseca's discussion is\ninformed by the criticisms of Cajetan, though in this case the\nposition that Cajetan adopts on the question of the unity of\nthe common nature seems closer to the broadly Thomist and Scotist\ntradition than that proposed by Fonseca. In other words, Fonseca\nadopts an account of the common nature that seems quite distinct from\nthe closely related views of Aquinas and Scotus. To this extent,\nFonseca's account represents an acceptance of haecceities in the\ncontext of a theory of universals that is not really\nScotist. According to Cajetan, common natures in themselves have\n“formal” unity: indivisibility into further more specific kinds,\ncompatible with division into numerically many instances or subjective\nparts (Cajetan [CBE], nn. 134–155 [nn. 55–62]; see Fonseca, In\nMet. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 967B,\nD-E]). Fonseca agrees that the nature must have this formal unity — a\nunity that he identifies as Scotus's less-than-numerical unity\n(Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599),\nvol. 2, col. 968A]). But, in addition to this unity, he holds that the\nnature has a proper unity of its own that cannot be communicated to\nits instantiations. This unity is numerical, and belongs to the\nnature absolutely (unqualifiedly) (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 28,\nq. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 968A]). The reason is\nthat, if a nature lacked such additional unity, then it would not be\npossible to speak of (say) humanity as just one species. After all,\nthe formal unity of the nature is compatible with division into\nnumerically many instances; some other unity must be the basis for the\nassertion that humanity is not many natures or species (Fonseca, In\nMet. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 1 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2,\ncol. 959F]). The picture is admittedly not entirely clear, but\nFonseca's distinction of instantiable from non-instantiable unity is\npresumably supposed to explain how there can be some unity proper to\ncommon natures; this unity is distinguished from instantiable unity,\nand it is the existence of haecceities that explains how the\ninstantiable unity is in fact instantiated. \n Setting aside the complexities of a later thinker such as Fonseca,\nthe years immediately after Scotus saw something of a move towards a\nmore nominalist view on the question of universals — the view\n(on the understanding of ‘nominalism’ relevant here) that\nuniversals are just concepts. It is hard to make very firm\nclassifications on this point, since it seems fundamentally unclear\nwhether a position such as Aquinas's — which denies any\nextramental reality to common natures while accepting some sort of\n(extramental?)  non-numerical unity — should count as a form of\nnominalism or not. Amongst opponents of Scotus, the most common\nstrategy was to adopt the view that substances themselves are\nprimarily diverse, such that their distinction is not explained by any\nreal feature or property of them other than merely the substance\nitself. For example, according to Peter Auriol writing in the second\ndecade after Scotus' death, \n Rejection of Scotus's view was not confined to such manifest\nopponents of Scotus's system. Amongst the earliest students of\nScotus, various found his views on the haecceity and its formal\ndistinction from the nature unpalatable. William of Alnwick, the\nforemost of Scotus's students working through the second decade of\nthe fourteenth century, holds at least two different positions,\nneither the same as Scotus's. In an early disputed question on\nindividuation, William holds that natures are individual of themselves\n(Stella [1968], 363); later, in his Ordinatio on the\nSentences, William accepts something akin to Henry of\nGhent's position that individuation is by a negation, though\nadding the clarification that this negation represents nevertheless a\nperfection — it is better not to have the positive feature of\ndivisibility (Stella [1968], 630–631). The reason for the shift in\nview is an apprehension that the fact that natures can be multiplied\n(i.e. exemplified many times) entails that a nature cannot be\nself-individuating (Stella [1968], 628). But William cannot see how\nthe added feature could be anything positive, since he does not see\nhow an individual could be anything, necessarily, other than its\nnature (Stella [1968], 631). (Being e.g. human is sufficient for being\nan individual.) In both works, William objects to Scotus's view\nthat the common nature is somehow prior to its instantiations, on the\ngrounds that this priority entails that the common nature could exist\nwithout any of its instantiations (Stella [1968], 352, 625). This in\neffect amounts — in Scotist terms — to the claim that the nature is\nreally distinct, not just formally distinct, from any of its\ninstantiations. For Scotus, the mark of a formal distinction is\ninseparability: no individual is separable from its nature, and there\nis thus no more than a formal distinction in any individual between\nnature and haecceity. Ockham puts his finger on this misinterpretation\non the part of Alnwick: \n As Ockham rightly implies, this is not Scotus's view. A position\nnot dissimilar to William's earlier, nominalist, view can be\nfound in another prominent early student of Scotus's — Henry of\nHarclay (see Henninger [1994]; for Ockham's rejection of the way\nin which Harclay develops his nominalist theory, see Ockham,\nOrdinatio I, d. 2, q. 7, nn.  11–12, 63–82\n(William of Ockham [OT], 2:227, l. 15–p. 228,\nl. 20, p.  241, l. 21–p. 248, l. 21; Spade (1994),\n191–192, 200–204); see too Adams [1982]). \n Ockham himself, writing 1321–1323, raises an array of arguments\nagainst Scotus's position. Ockham, of course, was a thinker explicitly\ninfluenced by Scotus in all sorts of ways, while nevertheless\nrejecting the fundamental feature of Scotist metaphysics and\nsemantics, namely realism on the question of universals. Without\nexception, the arguments target one of the following two Scotist\npositions: the commonality of the nature, and the formal\ndistinction. As such, Ockham does not attack haecceities, though in so\nfar as Scotus's account of haecceities requires both his distinctive\naccount of the divisibility of a nature, and the formal distinction\nbetween nature and haecceity, Ockham's attacks will harm Scotus's\nhaecceities too. Ockham offers no fewer than four arguments against\ncommon natures with less than numerical unity (Ockham,\nOrdinatio I, d. 2, q. 6, nn. 51, 62, 78, 82 (William of\nOckham [OT], 2:181, ll.  8–13, p. 184, ll. 11–13, p. 189,\nll. 10–14, p. 190, ll. 18–22; Spade (1994), 161, 163, 166,\n167)). The key one is the second: humanity in Socrates and humanity in\nPlato are numerically distinct, and essentially so. So there is\nnothing in common between these humanities. Ockham's first and longest\nargument against Scotus takes issue with the formal\ndistinction. Against the formal distinction of really identical\nentities, Ockham persistently appeals to the indiscernibility of\nidenticals, arguing that the principle holds whatever its domain\n(i.e. whether ranging over properties or over substances, or both: see\nOckham, Ordinatio I, d.  2, q. 6, nn. 25–8, 83 (William\nof Ockham [OT], 2:173, l. 11–p. 174, l.  12,\np. 190, l. 23-p. 191, l. 4; Spade (1994), 118, 127)). As Marilyn Adams\nhas pointed out, this strategy of course begs the question against\nScotus (Adams [1982], 420).  Scotus's inclination is to restrict the\nindiscernibility of identicals to the domain of individual\nsubstances. \n Ockham's more parsimonious ontology is important in the attempt to\nunderstand the nature of the opposition to Scotus just\noutlined. Ockham is sometimes presented as though his distinctive\nposition on the question of individuation is simply the result of his\ndistinctive nominalist position on the question of universals. Thus\nArmand Maurer, in a generally very helpful account of Ockham's\nposition: \n This is not quite right. For while Ockham does not need an\nexplanation for indivisibility (since a tenet of Ockham's nominalism\non the question of universals is that nothing real is divisible into\nsubjective parts), he certainly needs an explanation for the\ndistinction of one substance from another, as Black's reflections on\nthe principle of the identity of indiscernibles forcefully show. In\nfact, Ockham claims that a substance is singular through\nitself (“se ipso”: Ockham, Ordinatio I,\nd. 2, q. 6, n. 105–107 (William of Ockham [OT],\n2:196, ll. 2–12; Spade (1994), 171)). And it seems to me that\nthis claim does indeed constitute an attempt at a solution to the\nproblem of distinction. For Ockham is a nominalist about many more\nproperties than Scotus is, as well as being a nominalist on the\nquestion of universals. Thus, Ockham believes that the set of those\npredicates that involve no ontological commitment (that is to say,\npredicates that do not signify anything extramental other than merely\nthe substance itself) includes the Aristotelian genus, specific\ndifference, and proprium (necessary but non-defining\nproperty) (see e.g. Moody [1935], 97-106, 145–51). Substances\nthemselves are primarily diverse according to Ockham — their\ndistinction from each other is not explained by anything other than\ntheir own self-identity, and ipso facto not by any\nqualitative or relational feature of themselves.  Self-identity is\nnot, however, a real feature of the substance in any sense distinct\nfrom itself or its nature. And this is the result not of Ockham's\nnominalism on the question of universals, but of his nominalism on the\nquestion of inseparable properties. And much the same seems true of\nthe other opponents of Scotus mentioned above. \n Ockham's position thus turns out to be a variety of haecceitism (in a\nmore modern sense of the word). Maintaining that substances are\nprimarily diverse does not amount to having no theory of\nindividuation. Indeed, it presumably entails that their diversity is\nnot explained by, say, qualitative distinction. Thus, Ockham holds\nthat two things, each per se singular, can be\n“precisely similar” to each other\n(Ockham, Ordinatio I, d. 2, q. 6, n. 108 (William of Ockham\n[OT], 2:196, l. 17; Spade (1994), 171)). And this seems to entail some\nform of haecceitism. The difference between this view and that of\nScotus is that the haecceity defended by Scotus is — in some\nminimal way — hypostatized.  Some modern accounts of\nhaecceities resemble Ockham's view more than Scotus's: the uniquely\ninstantiable, non-qualitative property of (say) being identical with\nSocrates — Socrates's haecceity (in the modern terminology)\n— does not carry the kind of ontological weight that Scotus (for\nexample) wants to place on haecceities as he understands them: \nNote, of course, that Scotus's account of the common nature also\nentails something stronger than Adams is proposing: indeed, it entails\nprecisely the sort of minimal hypostatization that Scotus\nadvocates. And the reason for this, of course, is Scotus's view that\nindividual substances cannot themselves be primarily diverse — a\nfact that is explained by his claim that common natures have some sort\nof unity in their instantiations: the nature in Socrates is\n(non-numerically) the same as the nature in Plato. Natures,\nfor Scotus, cannot be primarily diverse; substances must include more\nthan natures. But individual natures in Ockham's view can indeed be\nprimarily diverse, and this surely amounts to a form of haecceitism\n— nothing other than an individual nature's own self-identity\nexplains its distinction from all other such natures. Maintaining that\nindividual natures are primarily diverse amounts not to having no\ntheory of individuation, but to accepting a form of haecceitism that,\nlike Adams's, does not involve ontological commitment to the existence\nof real haecceities as distinct real constituents of things.","contact.mail":"richard.cross@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
