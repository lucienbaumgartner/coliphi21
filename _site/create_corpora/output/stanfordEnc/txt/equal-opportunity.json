The background\nassumption is that a society contains a hierarchy of more and less\ndesirable, superior and inferior positions. Or there may be several\nsuch hierarchies. In a caste society, the assignment of individuals to\nplaces in the social hierarchy is fixed by birth. The child acquires\nthe social status of his or her parents at least if their union is\nsocially sanctioned. Social mobility may be possible in a caste\nsociety, but the process whereby one is admitted to a different level\nof the hierarchy is open only to some individuals depending on their\ninitial ascriptive social status. In contrast, when equality of\nopportunity prevails, the assignment of individuals to places in the\nsocial hierarchy is determined by some form of competitive process,\nand all members of society are eligible to compete on equal terms.\nDifferent conceptions of equality of opportunity construe this idea of\ncompeting on equal terms variously.\n\nFormal equality of opportunity requires that positions and posts\nthat confer superior advantages should be open to all applicants.\nApplications are assessed on their merits, and the applicant deemed\nmost qualified according to appropriate criteria is offered the\nposition. Alternatively, applicants are winnowed by fair competition,\nand the winner or winners get the superior advantages. Formal equality of opportunity might obtain in a variety of social\nsettings. As defined here, this ideal does not presuppose that the\nproduction and distribution of goods and services are organized\nthrough a market economy with private ownership. For example, an\nautocratic society, in which economic life is organized by the\ncommands of the autocrat, could satisfy equality of opportunity to\nthis extent: the post of autocrat is open to all applicants, and\nselection is determined by the fitness of applicants for autocratic\nperformance as indicated by the comparative merits of their\napplications. Moreover, the autocrat might organize economic life and\ndistribute economic rewards by fair competitions. A communist society,\nin which political, social, and economic privileges accrue to\ncommunist party members, might conceivably be run in such a way that\ncommunist party membership is determined by competitive\nexamination. If the examination were set so that the person who earns\na top score is the best qualified for the post of party membership,\nand that person is offered party membership, formal equality of\nopportunity would be satisfied. The ideal of formal equality of opportunity is associated with the\nliberation of economic practices and institutions from guild\nprivileges and restrictions and with the development of competitive\nmarket economies. The slogan “careers open to talents”\nexpresses the aspiration to establish a world where government posts\ngo to the most qualified and economic opportunities may be seized by\nanyone independently of whether or not one's parents are of noble\nblood or cronies of the king. The ideal is opposed to nepotism, the\ndistribution of what should be public offices to one's relatives and\nfriends just because they are near and dear to the distributor and\nquite independently of their fitness for the post. In this entry for\nthe most part the terms “formal equality of opportunity”\nand “careers open to talents” are used interchangeably to\ndenote the same ideal. A market economy conforms to formal equality of opportunity only if\njobs offered by business firms are publicized in advance, so that\nanyone who might want to apply has a reasonable opportunity to do so.\nIn this setting formal equality of opportunity also requires that\napplications from anyone are accepted, applications are judged on\ntheir merits, and the most qualified according to criteria that are\nrelevant to job performance are offered positions. (A variant practice\nin which only current employees of a firm are eligible to apply to\nhigher-level jobs might be deemed to satisfy equal opportunity\nprovided entry-level jobs in the firm are open to all applicants.) In\naddition, equal opportunity in a market setting requires that the\nlending of money for investment purposes by banks should proceed by\naccepting applications from any interested party and deciding who\nshould get loans according to the expected profit of lending to one\nrather than another of the various applicants. Equality of opportunity\nalso requires that the access of economic firms to investment and\noperating capital by borrowing money through sales of bonds and\nthrough sales of shares in the ownership of the enterprise (stocks)\nshould occur through processes that give all firms and economic agents\nthe same opportunities for gain. More generally, equality of opportunity in the market setting\nrequires that firms and individuals deal with one another impartially\nas opportunities for gain. When formal equality of opportunity is\nsatisfied in a market setting, each participant regards all others as\npotential partners for interaction and selects partners for a deal or\na venture according to the extent to which interaction with those\nparticular individuals or firms promises to further one's morally\ninnocent economic goals. An alternative formulation would have it that\nwhen a market economy satisfies formal equality of opportunity, each\nmarket agent selects partners for interaction according to the extent\nto which interaction with those particular individuals or firms would\nfurther one's legally permitted goals. The ideal of formal equality of opportunity has limited scope. Its\nsphere of application is public life, not private life. Where to draw\nthis line between public and private for this purpose is itself an\nunsettled and controversial issue. Certainly decisions about whom to\ninvite to be a dinner guest, whom to regard as a potential date or\nmarriage partner, whom to cultivate with a view to forming a personal\nfriendship are not decisions that fall within the sphere of equality\nof opportunity. This is not to deny that such decisions can be made in\na way that reflects wrongful prejudice. This surely happens, and is\nmorally criticizable. But equality of opportunity as normally\nunderstood is a norm that regulates a political and civil society, a\ncommon life in which all members participate, rather than every aspect\nof the conduct of individual lives. However, this scope restriction is\nopen to challenge. The idea of equality of opportunity tends also to be limited in\nscope along another dimension. Its domains are political societies or\nnation-states taken one at a time. If all Austrian universities are\nopen to all Austrian youth and all Chinese universities are open to\nall Chinese youth, it is not ordinarily thought to be objectionable if\nAustrian universities are not open to Chinese and Chinese universities\nare not open to the Austrians. Thus limited in scope, formal equality\nof opportunity would be compatible with far greater educational\nopportunity being available to Austrian than to Chinese\nyouth. However, nothing prevents broadening the scope of application\nof equality of opportunity. For example, one might uphold the ideal of\na global marketplace in which all transactions conform to formal\nequality of opportunity applied world-wide. It should be noted that formal equality of opportunity so\nunderstood puts moral constraints on market decisions. Equality of\nopportunity is violated if investors decline to invest in a company\njust because its CEO is a black, or a woman, and they are prejudiced\nagainst blacks and women. If one operates a business and provides a\nproduct or service to the public for sale, formal equality of\nopportunity is violated if one refuses to sell to some class of\npotential customers on grounds that are whimsical (no sales to people\nwith brown hair, or wearing black shoes) or prejudiced (no sales to\npeople of some disfavored race, religion, or skin color). By the same\ntoken, the ideal of formal equal opportunity puts constraints on the\nbehavior of customers of firms and purchasers of goods and services as\nwell as constraints on would-be providers. If a Jewish individual\nstarts a business and people decline to purchase goods from her in\nvirtue of the fact that she is Jewish, formal equality of opportunity\nis violated. In the same way, to refuse to purchase a product on the\nground that its manufacture employed the labor of women in skilled\njobs violates formal equality of opportunity. Suppose the owner of a small business hires her family members or\nfriends instead of advertising job openings and picking among the\napplicants according to the merits of their applications. This might\nbe deemed a private matter and, for this reason, not a violation of\nformal equality of opportunity. However, if this same small business,\na restaurant, serves whites only and refuses to accept blacks,\nHispanics, and others as customers, this decision might well be deemed\nto lie in the public sphere and to constitute a violation of formal\nequality of opportunity. A perhaps controversial case of a type of\ndecision that might be thought to lie in the public or in the private\nsphere with respect to the application of equality of opportunity\nwould be decisions of business-oriented social clubs that are\ntraditionally exclusively male or white in their membership to\ncontinue to deny membership to nonwhites and nonmales who might seek\nadmission. Since valuable business contacts are made at these private\nsocial clubs, and business deals are sometimes made on the premises,\nthe exclusion of women and minorities from membership in them might be\ndeemed wrongfully discriminatory and a violation of equality of\nopportunity. Notice that selection among applicants for a job by a random\nprocedure that gives all applicants an identical chance of getting the\njob actually violates formal equality of opportunity as here\ninterpreted (on equal opportunity as a lottery procedure, see Rae et\nal. 1981). At least, if there are relevant standards of merit that\ncould be applied to the applicants and that would predict successful\njob performance, a lottery to select who gets the job would not\nqualify as selection according to merit. Only if all applicants are\nequally qualified or there is no feasible and cost-effective way to\ndistinguish among the applicants according to their merit would a\nlottery satisfy the ideal of equality of opportunity. The idea of being most qualified for a post is not transparently\nclear. One might hold that being qualified is meeting perfectionist\ncriteria of excellence that are internal to roles and crafts. A good\ncarpenter has the skills and other traits that render one competent at\nusing wood to build things. The position or post is associated with a\ngoal, and excellence is what enables nonaccidental successful pursuit\nof the goal. If a post is associated with several goals, there may be no\ndefinitive ranking of their relative importance, hence no definitive\nprecise notion of being more qualified than another candidate for the\npost. A good psychotherapist may help patients in several distinct\nways, so there may be only partial commensurability in rankings of\npsychotherapists. A post may be associated with quite different conflicting goals,\nsome problematic. Suppose a mediocre professional hockey player tends\nto become embroiled in brawls during games. His thuggish conduct\npleases fans, and raises ticket sale revenues. If the purpose of\nprofessional hockey is to create profits for hockey team owners, the\nmediocre hockey player may be more qualified for a position on the\nteam than better players. The carpenter with excellent skills and an\nunwillingness to do shoddy work may not be qualified for a job with\nthe construction firm whose profit-maximizing business strategy is to\nbuild cheap affordable houses. Similar issues can arise in the\nnonprofit sector. An international aid agency may do better to hire\nphotogenic young aid workers, who will attract favorable press\ncoverage, rather than workers more able to do the work that will help\nthe agency's intended beneficiaries. If airline business travelers prefer to be served by physically\nattractive women rather than attractive men or unattractive\nindividuals of either sex, a profit-seeking firm will regard being\nfemale and attractive as job qualifications (Yuracko 2004a). If white\nworkers rebel at being bossed around by a supervisor who is not\nwhite-skinned, being white-skinned may be a job qualification for the\nsupervisor post. One response to these examples is to identify the\nmost qualified applicant for a post as the one whose hiring will do\nmost to advance the morally legitimate purposes of the\nenterprise. This formulation allows the construction firm to consider\nthe excellent carpenter who insists on working to the highest\nstandards as unqualified and likely guides us to regard hiring the\nairline stewards and stewardesses as a difficult borderline case.\nThese verdicts are plausible. But notice that the firm that caters to\nthe racist prejudices of its workers has the morally innocent aim of\nmaking profits. One problem here is that the firm pursues its aim by\ncatering to wrongful desires, and indeed wrongful desires of just the\ntype that equal opportunity aims to overcome. In contrast, selecting a\nblack actor to play the lead role in Othello seems\nunproblematic, and so does selecting a female medical doctor to serve\nas a gynecologist for a clientele of women who feel more comfortable\nbeing treated by a woman rather than a man.  However, the latter\nexample is not beyond challenge. The judgment of the case may depend\non the underlying motivation of the customers, as seems probable if we\nintroduce variations of the example. We might imagine that the women\nwho prefer a female gynecologist simply dislike men as such. In an\nalternative scenario, imagine that the women clients feel more\ncomfortable being treated by a male gynecologist because they view the\ndoctor's role as involving a social authority that properly belongs to\nmales. Here there seem to be violations of formal equality of\nopportunity. A society could satisfy the careers open to talents ideal even\nthough the economy is overwhelmingly oriented to satisfying wrongful\nconsumer desires for unhealthy food and cruel sports spectacles, just\nso long as the desires being satisfied are not wrongful by virtue of\noffending against an element of the formal equality of opportunity\nideal. How to draw the line between desires that are offensive in this\nway and those that are not is a tricky matter. The desire of consumers\nnot to purchase products in which the labor of those deemed\nlower-caste individuals is embedded in any except menial roles is\nclearly on the wrong side of the line. The desire of elderly women to\nbe attended by female nurses is clearly not. Several factors may be in\nplay. One is that desires that express hostile attitudes against\npeople in virtue of their group membership are inherently inimical to\ncareers open to talents. Another is that desires that reflect accurate\nstatistical judgments are not inherently offensive to equal\nopportunity. Perhaps elderly women believe correctly that they are\nmore apt to receive sensitive, caring treatment from members of their\nown sex. Desires that arise in group-hierarchical culture and would\nnot have arisen in an equal opportunity society are arguably not just\non this basis reasonably deemed offensive to careers open. Another\nfactor that perhaps ought to guide classificatory judgments in this\narea is disparate impact (on which, see\n section 6.1). The formulation toward which this discussion points is that for\npurposes of determining whether formal equality of opportunity is\nsatisfied in given circumstances, any member of society must be\nallowed to apply for positions that confer advantage, applications\nmust be judged on their merits, and selection of applicants for the\nposition must proceed by selecting the top-ranked applicant first,\nthen successively lesser-ranked applicants, in order of their fitness\nfor the post as revealed by their applications. An application is\nmeritorious to the degree that it shows that selecting this individual\nwould better advance the morally legitimate aims of the enterprise by\nmeans that are not morally forbidden and specifically not wrongfully\ndiscriminatory than would selecting any other applicants. If an\napplicant would do better in a post by satisfying desires and choices\nof customers that are in violation of equality of opportunity, then\nhiring the applicant on that basis would also violate equality of\nopportunity (Wertheimer 1983). This formulation does not rule out some selection decisions that\nsome might want to classify as violations of formal equality of\nopportunity. Consider this example: Two lawyers apply for a job in a\nlaw firm. One is better at lawyering work but comes from a nonwealthy\nfamily background; the other is worse at lawyering work but comes from\na wealthy family, has many wealthy friends, and can be expected to\ndraw more wealthy clients and thus more revenue to the firm than her\nless connected fellow applicant. The wealthy applicant is chosen,\nbecause hiring her would do more for the firm's expected profits than\nhiring the other. The example illustrates that even if the ideal of\nformal equality of opportunity is uncontroversial if abstractly and\nvaguely stated, any detailed specification of the norm will be\ncontroversial. Another controversial selection criterion is age. Suppose that\nstate-funded openings for qualifying education for medical doctors are\nrestricted to applicants whose age does not exceed some stated\nmaximum. Or suppose there is a compulsory retirement age set by law\nfor certain occupations, or set by some individual business firms. Are\nsuch public or private policies wrongfully discriminatory so as to\nrender them violations of formal equality of opportunity? (On age\ndiscrimination, see also the discussion in\n section 2.3 of this entry.) Another controversial selection criterion is physical appearance\n(see Post 2000). In January 1992, the City Council of Santa Cruz,\nCalifornia, considered a proposed city ordinance that would have\nprohibited discrimination against individuals on the basis of physical\nappearance. In the context of employment, such an ordinance would rule\nout disfavoring an application for hiring or promotion on the ground\nthat the candidate is physically attractive or unattractive, and also\non the grounds that the candidate fails to conform to conventional\nstandards of dress or appearance. The proposed ordinance would have\nallowed an exception when physical appearance is a bona fide\noccupational qualification (BFOQ), when a certain appearance is\nrequired in order to carry out essential functions of the job.  Would\npassage of such an ordinance represent an advance or a setback for the\ncause of formal equality of opportunity or careers open to\ntalents? The candidate ordinance clearly overreaches by casting its net of\nprohibition too widely. A business might aim to attract customers by\npresenting a dressed-up or dressed-down tone, and refusing to follow\nthe appearance code for staff that is intended to achieve the desired\ntone should not be protected behavior under an antidiscrimination\nnorm, even if appearance does not qualify as an essential job\nfunction.  On the other hand, an appearance code can reinforce\nconventional beliefs that hinder disfavored groups from genuine equal\naccess to the workplace. Suppose an appearance code requires women to\nuse cosmetics and maintain their hair in expected styles while no\ncomparable requirements are imposed on men in the same job role.  How\nto draw boundary lines here is not easy to discern (see Yuracko\n2004a,b). Deborah Hellman proposes that wrongful discriminatory treatment\noccurs if and only if the discrimination demeans some of those who are\nbeing treated. In turn, to “demean is to treat someone in a way\nthat denies her equal moral worth.” Hellman elaborates:\n“To demean is not merely to insult but also to put down, to\ndiminish and denigrate” (Hellman 2008, at 29). Hellman's proposal offers a principled way of resolving disputed\nboundary lines between acceptable and unacceptable discrimination,\nwhich set the standard of formal equality of opportunity. In this\ntangled area of thought, the success of the proposal is hard to\njudge. One worry is that even if the proposal gives a sufficient\ncondition for wrongful discrimination, the proposal may fail as a\nnecessary condition. Suppose a society's employment practices are set\nby a religion that reveres women but dictates that their proper role\nis that of traditional homemaker, and that the only public sphere\nemployment suitable for women is temple prostitute (a highly regarded,\nindeed sacred calling). These practices of discrimination do not\ndemean women, but their this-worldly consequences are seriously\nharmful to women and arguably, in virtue of this fact, wrongly\ndiscriminatory. Another concern is that the proposal may fail as a\nsufficient condition as well. Suppose a society countenances giving\nlesser weight, in public and private decision making, to the interests\nof severely cognitively disabled individuals than to the nondisabled,\non the ground that these human individuals fail to have the rational\nagency capacities that qualify sentient beings as full persons. The\npractices of the society may demean the severely cognitively disabled\nwithout being wrongfully discriminatory. (On Hellman, and on wrongful\ndiscrimination generally, see Lippert-Rasmussen 2014, and on\ndiscrimination against the severely cognitively impaired, see McMahan\n1996).\n  Formal equality of opportunity (careers open to talents) as\ncharacterized so far could be satisfied in a society with guild\nrestrictions that are legally enforced, so long as the restricted\neconomic positions and roles are open to all applicants and\napplications are assessed on their merits. This feature of the\ncharacterization is open to objection. Consider a society in which no\none is allowed to practice law, medicine, college teaching,\nhaircutting and manicure provision, real estate, carpentry, plumbing,\ntaxicab driving, and so on without special schooling and a special\nstate-supplied license, few of which are available for distribution.\nEven if the procedures for certifying schools and selecting recipients\nfor licenses are impeccably fair and fairly administered, the system\nis subject to criticism on grounds of unfairness, and in particular,\ncriticizable for denying equal opportunity as between the officially\nlicensed provider of goods and services and the individual unlicensed\nto provide goods or services of that type who wants to sell them to\nwilling customers. It is possible that the restrictions on free trade just described\namount to state-established cartels. If so, there is a case for\nmaintaining that these restrictions constitute a denial of equality of\nopportunity in an intuitive sense and the definition of the term\nshould be revised to accommodate this judgment. It is also possible that the restrictions on free trade just\ndescribed are justifiable on the ground that consumers lack the\nknowledge and judgment appropriately to determine whether the\ncomplicated services being provided are worth their price and best\nsatisfy their preferences all things considered. If this is so, and if\nthe restrictions qualify as justifiable paternalism—restriction\nof people's liberty against their will for their own good—then\nthe restrictions would not plausibly be regarded as violating equality\nof opportunity rightly construed. Given that the restrictions could conceivably be sustaining\ncartels, one might hold that the notion of formal equality of\nopportunity should be reinterpreted to accommodate this\npossibility. An opposed view would urge that the examples of restraint\nof trade are objectionable, but not an offense against the ideal of\nequality of opportunity, rather an offense against the different ideal\nof free trade. In favor of holding cartel-establishing restraints on\nfree trade to be a violation of equality of opportunity is this\nconsideration. It is plausible to judge that if the king imposes\nunjustified restrictions on people's opportunities to interact with\neach other on mutually agreeable terms, that in itself counts as\nviolation of the ideal of careers open to talents or equal opportunity\nin the formal sense. Here is an alternative formulation of formal\nequality of opportunity that accommodates this judgment: Careers open\nto talents requires that individuals be free, under justified\nregulation, to buy and sell goods and services on mutually agreeable\nterms and that enterprises that confer positions of advantage select\nindividuals to fill these posts through competitions open to all, with\napplications assessed by relevant criteria of merit.  Promotions and\nadvancement of individuals in positions of advantage should be\nconducted in a similar meritocratic way.\n  Although whimsical hiring violates formal equality of opportunity\njust as much as discrimination against some applicants done because\nthe applicant is a member of a socially disfavored group, the latter\nis evidently a more serious violation of formal equality of\nopportunity.  Whereas being the object of discrimination because one\nbelongs to a group that has been targeted for oppressive treatment in\nthe past is likely to be a wound to one's sense of dignity and\nself-respect, being the victim of whimsical or idiosyncratic hiring\npractices is less likely to inflict a significant psychic wound over\nand above the loss of the job itself. Also, since whimsical\ndiscrimination is idiosyncratic, it will not lead to cumulative harm\nby causing anyone to be the object of economic discrimination time\nafter time (unless whimsical hiring were common and one were extremely\nunlucky). Also, in the context of a competitive market, there is the\npressure of market competition that punishes whimsical economic\ndecisions that lead to subpar economic performance, so one expects\nwhimsy to be a marginal economic phenomenon. Discrimination on the basis of group membership might under certain\nconditions be rational behavior on the part of economic agents and\nmight lead to efficient outcomes. Market competition would not tend to\ndrive out such discrimination. Consider stereotypes, rough\ngeneralizations about traits of groups. If a stereotype is\n“sufficiently” accurate, it can make sense to treat all\ngroup members the same for some purpose without investing resources in\ndetermining the actual traits possessed by individual group\nmembers. For example, if an employer seeking factory workers values\nsteady attendance at work, and absenteeism is known to be somewhat\nhigher among African-American youths than other youth, the employer\nmight simply set aside all applications from African-American youth\nand choose workers among the remainder of the applicant\npool. Discrimination that is cost-effective in this way and does not\ninvolve any misuse of available information is sometimes called\nstatistical discrimination.  The results for people who\nbecome the objects of statistical discrimination can obviously be\nbad. But this does not mean that statistical discrimination violates\nformal equality of opportunity.  Does it? As so far specified, formal equality of opportunity requires that\napplicants be assessed by appropriate criteria relevant to performance\non the post and that the most qualified candidate be offered the post.\nBut it would be excessively demanding to require that no expense be\nspared to discover, so far as is possible, which candidate is really\nmost qualified. If the general idea of formal equality of opportunity\nin a market setting is that all agents must be treated equally as\npotential means of gain, then those means of selecting candidates\nshould be required that maximize the hiring firm's prospects for gain\n(unless the firm's prospects register wrongfully discriminating\nbehavior by its customers or suppliers). Seen this way, statistical\ndiscrimination would not violate formal equality of opportunity. In some societies, the law of equal opportunity forbids statistical\ndiscrimination when the basis of the discrimination is race or\nsex. The employer must base hiring and promotion decisions on facts\nabout the individual applicants other than their being black or white,\nmale or female, or the like (even if basing decisions on accurate\nstereotypes is the most cost-effective way to proceed). The rationale\nfor this legal policy might be to ensure that historically invidious\nforms of discrimination are not continued by prohibiting forms of\ndiscrimination that are superficially similar and reminiscent of past\nevils. Formal equality of opportunity as characterized in this entry\nwould not rationalize this legal policy. Discrimination against members of a group might be based on\naversion to the group, which might exist quite independently of the\nactual characteristics of actual group members. For example, an\nemployer might simply dislike Catholics or Jews or women, and be\naverse to hiring them, or to hiring them for other than unskilled\nlow-paid jobs. One might suppose that if one has a taste for\ndiscrimination of this sort, one must incur costs if one acts on it\n(Becker 1971). If one refuses to hire Catholics or Jews or women even\nwhen they are most qualified, the product one offers for sale will be\nmore costly to produce as a result, and if the market for this product\nis competitive, one cannot raise the price at which one sells it but\nmust accept lesser profit than one would have obtained had one's\nhiring decisions been unprejudiced.  On this basis one might speculate\nthat competitive markets will tend to drive out such\ndiscrimination. However, if large numbers of people share a\ndiscriminatory social norm, one can see that the market will reward\ncompliance with the norm and punish noncompliance, so there will in\nthat case be no tendency for the market to squeeze out discriminatory\nbehavior. For example, if consumers will not purchase widgets that are\nmanufactured with the skilled labor of Catholics, Jews, or women, and\nif skilled Protestant male workers employed in the widget industry\nwill not cooperate with Catholics, Jews, or women if they are hired as\nskilled co-workers, the widget manufacturer who simply wishes to\nmaximize her profits will be led to comply with the social norm\nagainst the employment of the targeted groups in skilled jobs (Akerlof\n1976, 1980). Discrimination against people on the basis of their observable\ngroup traits is an enemy of equality of opportunity. This is a\ncommon-sense observation. If all discrimination were statistical\ndiscrimination, the common-sense observation would be true only to a\nvery limited degree. If observable group traits such as skin color or\nsex are correlated with traits that employers reasonably value, hiring\non the basis of the observable group traits can be rational from the\nstandpoint of the employer seeking both to hire qualified workers and\nminimize hiring search costs. Discrimination can also express and reinforce group status\nhierarchies. If possession of white skin confers status and attracts\nthe esteem of others, derogating nonwhite individuals can help to\nbuild and sustain a top position for whites in the skin color\nhierarchy. Discrimination can take the form of favoring whites in\nhiring and promotion decisions, but can also take the form of\nparticipating in caste rituals and practices that proclaim the\nsuperiority of whites over others. Discrimination of this sort aims to\npreserve caste subordination. A successful discriminatory regime\nproduces economic advantages for the dominant caste members, and also\nsweeping social advantages, so that sheer possession of white skin\nwill predict that one will enjoy better life prospects than those who\nlack white skin. Group status hierarchies are entrenched and sustained\nby social norms that dictate costly individual behaviors directed at\nfavoring fellow group members if one belongs to the superior group and\nat exhibiting deferential and submissive behavior if one belongs to a\ndisfavored group. Conformity to the norms is rewarded and deviations\npunished (McAdams 1995).  The stability of group status hierarchy regimes raises the\nquestion, what motivates individuals to follow the norms that sustain\nthe regime and to punish those who deviate even though following and\npunishing incur costs and often run against the individual's\nself-interest. Part of the answer appears to be that in an ongoing\nstatus hierarchy, people internalize the norms and esteem those who\nfollow the norms, and the desire for this esteem motivates one to\nconform. Expressing admiration of those who adhere to social norms one\naccepts is often not costly behavior for an individual, but rather a\npleasant activity. Moreover, we humans evidently have a native\ndisposition to be rule-following punishers, who tend to accept current\ndominant social norms and to desire to punish those who violate them\neven when doing so is disadvantageous for us (Bicchieri 2006: chapter\n3 and Henrich and Henrich 2006: chapters 7–8). The same generic\ntrait that leads us to be disposed to punish those who steal and lie\nand neglect their children can also lead us to be disposed to punish\nthose who challenge established group status hierarchy norms such as\nwhite supremacy.  State-enforced laws can help create and sustain such\na regime, as with Jim Crow segregation laws in the U.S. South in the\ntwentieth century, but discriminatory social norms can arise and\nthrive and confer benefits on dominant caste members in the absence of\nlegal enforcement. Group status hierarchy can form on the basis of any arbitrary\nobservable trait—skin color, supposed race, ethnicity, sex,\nheterosexual or nonheterosexual sexual behavior, age, and so\non—but a trait that is exploited for this purpose will not be\nregarded as arbitrary by those who uphold the hierarchy. If the basis\nof the status hierarchy is white skin color, white skin will be prized\nas inherently attractive and as a marker for other valuable qualities\nsuch as intelligence and virtue. Those who uphold the status hierarchy\ncan then see themselves not simply as advancing group self-interest\nbut as defending a desirable moral order. A status hierarchy then will\nbe ideological, based on false beliefs that serve some people's\ninterests. This thumbnail sketch of derogatory discrimination and group status\nhierarchy helps explain how and why public policy measures to enhance\nequality of opportunity tend to be controversial in complicated\nways. When a group status hierarchy is officially dismantled, people\nmay disagree widely on such questions as whether the underlying\nprejudiced attitudes have disappeared or have persisted in subtler and\nless overt forms.  The problem with formal equality of opportunity is that it is\nmerely formal. Imagine a society ruled by a hereditary warrior class\n(as in B. Williams 1962). Reformers bring about a change. From now on,\nmembership in the warrior class will not be drawn exclusively from the\nwealthy stratum of the society. Warriors will instead be selected on\nthe basis of a competitive examination in military prowess\nadministered to any young adult member of society who seeks admission\ninto this elite class. However, it turns out that only scions of the\nwealthy stratum pass the exam and become warriors. Everyone in society\nexcept the wealthy is poorly nourished, and being well nourished is a\nprerequisite for developing the military skills needed to succeed on\nthe competitive examination. In this setting, advocates for the\nnonwealthy strata of society might object that none but members of the\ntraditional wealthy elite have a chance to satisfy the eligibility\nrequirements for admission to the warrior class. Even if all are eligible to apply for a superior position and\napplications are judged fairly on their merits, one might hold that\ngenuine or substantive equality of opportunity requires that all have\na genuine opportunity to become qualified. In the example just\nsketched, this would mean that all members of society have the\nopportunity to develop the needed military skills. One can imagine the\nsociety taking a variety of steps to provide opportunities to\nall. Nutrition supplements are made available to those whose diet is\ninadequate.  Scholarships to military academies can be won by poor\nchildren. Warrior skills coaches are dispatched to every village. As\nmore is done to provide opportunities that enable ambitious and\ntalented youth from any social group to acquire proficiency at warrior\nskills, at some point the complaint that none but the wealthy have a\nchance to enter the warrior class begins to sound hollow. At some\npoint it might be held that sufficient or good enough opportunities to\nbecome qualified have been provided to all. The idea would be that\nsubstantive equality of opportunity prevails with respect to some\ndesirable position or ranked order of positions just in case all\nmembers of society are eligible to apply for the position,\napplications are fairly judged on their merits and the most\nmeritorious are selected, and sufficient opportunity to develop the\nqualifications needed for successful application is available to\nall. Further development of this proposal would give an account of what\nlevel of opportunity provision is “good enough.” Evidently\nthe level would be set by balancing the costs and benefits of greater\nprovision of opportunities versus the costs and benefits measured in\nterms of other values with which opportunity provision conflicts.  But\nwherever the “good enough” level of provision is set, it\ncould be that members of society still have unequal opportunities to\nbecome qualified for formal equality of opportunity contests.\nScholarships are provided for some poor children, but wealthy parents\ncan hire private fencing and jousting tutors. Some families own horses\nand can impart horse riding skills to their children, which gives them\na competitive advantage over others. And so on. Pursuing to the limit the idea of reducing the competitive\nadvantages that favorable circumstances confer on some individuals,\none arrives at the ideal that John Rawls has called “fair\nequality of opportunity” (Rawls 1999: section 12 and Rawls 2001:\nsection 13). Fair equality of opportunity (FEO) is satisfied in a\nsociety just in case any individuals who have the same native talent\nand the same ambition will have the same prospects of success in\ncompetitions that determine who gets positions that generate superior\nbenefits for their occupants.  In other words, if Smith and Jones have\nthe same native talent, and Smith is born of wealthy, educated parents\nof a socially favored ethnicity and Jones is born of poor, uneducated\nparents of a socially disfavored ethnicity, then if they develop the\nsame ambition to become scientists or Wall Street lawyers, they will\nhave the same prospects of becoming scientists or Wall Street lawyers\nif FEO prevails. Rawls writes that   assuming there\nis a distribution of natural assets, those who are at the same level\nof talent and ability, and have the same willingness to use them,\nshould have the same prospects of success regardless of their initial\nplace in the social system. (Rawls 1999: 63) It should be noted that the specification of FEO just given departs\nfrom the specification in Rawls 2001. There Rawls defines FEO so it\nrequires only that the socio-economic status into which one is born\nhas no impact on one's competitive prospects. There is also the issue\nto be discussed below, whether the rights of parents to raise their\nchildren as they choose take priority over FEO and constrain its\nfulfillment. The eminent Rawls interpreter Samuel Freeman roundly\ndeclares that even setting aside the family freedom issue, we should\nsee that all in all “Rawls does not understand FEO as requiring\nequal chances for the equally endowed” (Freeman 2007: 98). He\nsees FEO as instead demanding that all individuals especially\nincluding the disadvantaged should have opportunities to develop their\ntalents. What extent of opportunities? This formulation looks like\nweak tea. Rawls exegesis aside, the formulation that sees FEO as\nrequiring equal chances for the equally well endowed, a perfect\nmeritocracy if you will, is interesting, controversial, and resonates\nwith concerns about chances for mobility in the context of modern\nmarket economies. In the remainder of this entry, FEO refers to this\nbroader ideal. FEO articulates the ideal of a classless society of a sort. If the\nmark of a class society is that positions in the social hierarchy are\npassed along from generation to generation, then the society that\nsatisfies the FEO ideal is classless in so far as parents can pass\nalong advantages to their children only by genetic inheritance and by\nsocialization that instills ambition. (Notice that FEO so understood\nis violated if some individuals gain significant advantages by gift or\ninheritance. One could amend FEO so that it permits gift and\ninheritance, deemed private transactions, and imposes constraints only\non public sphere competitions.) Otherwise the advantages that well-off\nparents can confer on their children by providing better education and\nsocialization than others receive or by providing access to a social\nnetwork of well-off individuals are entirely eliminated or offset in\nthe FEO society. If wealthy parents provide high-quality day care and\nnursery school and private tutoring for their children, society\narranges public education practices so that children of nonwealthy\nparents get the same or equivalent advantages. In the same spirit, if\nsome parents, rich or poor, are more strongly motivated than others to\nhelp their children get ahead in life, these efforts are somehow\nexactly offset, so having the good luck to have especially concerned\nparents does not affect one's comparative life prospects. The end\nresult is that one can try to give one's own children a leg up in\nsocial competition, but whatever boost one provides will be met by a\nsimilar boost provided for other children whose native talent is the\nsame as that of one's own children. (In passing it should be noted\nthat when better-off parents provide various amounts of special boost\nfor their children, FEO taken strictly and literally requires that\nwhatever is the maximal special aid provided for individuals with a\ncertain genetic talent endowment and ambition, the equivalent of that\naid must also be provided to all other individuals, including\nindividuals of better-off parents who are getting less than the\nmaximal aid.) FEO as characterized here is a demanding ideal. What if FEO becomes\nimpossible to satisfy if inequalities in outcome become too extreme?\nIn that case FEO requires extinguishing any inequalities in outcome\namong members of one generation that would bring it about that FEO\ncannot be satisfied among members of subsequent generations.  In the\nRawlsian system of nested and hierarchically ordered principles, FEO\nhas less priority than the basic equal liberties principle.  If FEO\ncould be satisfied only by encroaching on free speech or the right to\nvote or other basic liberties, then according to Rawls it should give\nway. Up to conflict with equal basic liberties, FEO rules the\nroost.  FEO might be adopted in conjunction with formal equality of\nopportunity or by itself as a freestanding moral requirement. The\ndifference between FEO alone and FEO paired with formal equality of\nopportunity emerges when one pictures a society that satisfies FEO but\nnot formal equality of opportunity. A society might be composed\nequally of members of two hostile groups, who discriminate against\neach other at every opportunity. If the groups command the same amount\nof economic resources, it could happen that formal equality of\nopportunity is always violated, because in every context of\ninteraction people favor members of their own group regardless of\ntheir qualifications. If men discriminate against women, and women\nagainst men, these effects might counterbalance so that freestanding\nFEO is still satisfied. The following discussion of FEO for the most\npart interprets it as an inclusive doctrine containing formal equality\nof opportunity. Fair equality of opportunity can seem an inspiring ideal or a\nnightmarish vision reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984.  The\nideal of a classless society that has shed all trace of caste\nhierarchy is inspiring to many. But any scheme to implement FEO would\napparently require extensive meddling by government or some other\nagent of society in family life, and such meddling can appear\nnightmarish (Fishkin 1983). The negative response to the prospect of\nimplementation of FEO might not reflect rejection of the principle\nitself but merely a sense that this ideal should not be pursued\nwholeheartedly whatever the cost to other values. Equality of\nopportunity is typically advanced as a justice value, and the mark of\njustice norms is that they take priority over others. Even so,\nequality of opportunity might be one among several justice norms, and\nnot the top-rated. One might also question the assumption that the pursuit of FEO\ncould not proceed to a significant extent without invasive\ninterference in family life. For example, society could resolve to\ndevote far greater resources to the education of children of poor and\nuneducated parents than to the education of other children. This would\nbe done knowing that educated and wealthy parents will be inclined by\naffection for their children to give them special socialization and\neducation advantages and that these will roughly counterbalance the\nspecial state expenditures on disadvantaged children. Policies of this\nsort could be pursued without sending out state inspectors to monitor\nthe degree to which middle-class parents provide extra educational\nresources or informal props to self-efficacy and self-esteem that\nother children are not getting. Also, if the members of a society were\ncommitted to the ideal of FEO, they would not find reasonable and\ncost-effective measures to achieve it to be onerous. The issue\nbecomes, how great a value is FEO, and to what extent does its pursuit\nwarrant sacrifices in other values. FEO might be thought to conflict with the freedom of individuals to\nraise their own children as they choose. A parent (or someone else\nentrusted with the guardian role over a child) might want to impart\nhis culture and values to his children, and the result of parents with\ndifferent culture and values acting with that goal will predictably\nbring it about that children who have the same native talent and\nambition but are raised in different ways will have unequal chances of\ncompetitive success. Parents might want to encourage the development\nof their children's potential talents. If parents vary in how strongly\nthey are moved to act on this desire and in how effective they are at\nboosting their children's personal development, the result again will\nbe that individuals with the same native talent and the same ambition\nwill come to have unequal chances of competitive success, in violation\nof FEO. An alternative view on the conflict between family life and\nfulfillment of FEO is that the freedom to mate with anyone on mutually\nagreeable terms and raise children as one sees fit within broad limits\nis a basic liberty that takes priority over FEO. But a large question\nis now open: to what extent exactly is the fulfillment of FEO limited\nby the basic liberty of family freedom? Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift propose that it would be morally\nwrong to insist on complete fulfillment of FEO, because parents have\nlegitimate interests in helping their children to have good life\nprospects. There is a legitimate interest in acting for their\nchildren's sake, and also a legitimate interest, an important\nconstituent of the parent's good, in creatively expressing themselves\nin how they fulfill the parent role and in developing and sustaining\nspecial asymmetrical friendship bonds with their children that are\nunique to parent-child relations. As they put it, parents have a\n“nonfiduciary interest in being able to play a fiduciary\nrole” with respect to their children” (Brighouse and Swift\n2009: 54.). They work to distinguish inequality-promoting parental\nbehaviors such as reading bedtime stories to children that are\nessential to achieving the special values of parent-child relations\nand other inequality-promoting behaviors such as sending children to\nexpensive private schools that do not make essential contributions to\nparental relations and that might be discouraged or taxed or even\nprohibited without inflicting damage on parent-child relations. The assumption that achieving FEO would require limiting parents'\nfreedom to raise their children as they choose, so that if either\nparents have moral rights to this freedom or it is morally desirable\non other grounds to sustain it, we must accept less than complete\nfulfillment of FEO, has some plausibility but does not survive\nreflection. In principle, society could allow parents to act pretty\nmuch as they please and simultaneously maintain in place flexible\npolicies that adjust the social provision of aid to children so that\nwhatever parents do that would result in nonfulfillment of FEO if its\nimpact were left standing is entirely offset, so the end result is\nthat FEO is completely fulfilled. If wealthy parents give their\nchildren special tennis lessons and fancy tutorial assistance, social\nagencies increase aid to children whose parents do not or cannot\nlavish such resources on their upbringing, so the inequality-boosting\ntendency of the special parental provision is entirely nullified.  In\nprinciple no limits on parental freedom would be needed to achieve FEO\ncompletely (though limits on secret parental helps might need to be\ncurbed, and what might strike us as privacy-violating intrusions on\nfamily life to monitor effects of special parental provision would be\nneeded). This possible public policy stance sounds bizarre only\nbecause its costs would clearly be enormous, and arguably not worth\nthe moral gain in extra fulfillment of FEO they would achieve. The question then is raised, to what degree the fulfillment of FEO\nshould take priority, or rather take a back seat, when this moral aim\nconflicts with others that might be regarded as justice aims or on\nother grounds morally mandatory aims. Although FEO carries the idea of offsetting the advantages of being\nwell-born to its logical limit, it should be noted that by allowing\ndifferential ambition legitimately to affect individuals' life\nchances, FEO may not go far enough toward defining an ideal of genuine\nequal opportunity. The simple elimination of ambition from the FEO\nformula would be implausible. Let us stipulate that two individuals\nare equally ambitious with respect to some goal when they desire it\nwith equal fervor and are disposed to work equally hard to achieve\nit. If Sally desires to go to a selective college and works hard at\nher high school classes whereas equally talented Samantha does not\nhave the same strong desire and avoids doing her high school\nclasswork, no reasonable conception of substantive equality of\nopportunity is violated when Sally gains admission to an elite college\nand Samantha does not. The FEO ideal embodies a division of\nresponsibility between individual and society, with ambition falling\non the side of individual not social responsibility. But other cases are different and call in question this division of\nresponsibility. Suppose that FEO obtains in a society but\noverwhelmingly boys develop the ambition to pursue challenging and\nlucrative careers and girls overwhelmingly do not. The explanation is\nthat boys and girls alike are subjected to a rigid form of\nsocialization which instills ambition in boys and quashes it in girls.\nIn this case one might say that even though FEO is not violated when\nSam and Ben become lawyers and doctors and Sally and Samantha, equally\ntalented as Sam and Ben but far less ambitious, become homemakers and\ncheck-out clerks in convenience stores, genuine substantive equality\nof opportunity has not yet been achieved. In the society with rigid\nsex-stereotyped socialization, Sally and Samantha have not had a fair\nopportunity to develop the ambition that Ben and Sam have developed\nbecause only the latter benefited from the good luck of receiving\nfavorable socialization. One might modify FEO so that if two people\nhave the same native talent, but one ends up with lesser prospects of\nsuccess in competitions for positions of advantage because her\nambition has been reduced by prejudicial or discriminatory\nsocialization, then FEO is violated (on this issue, see Okin\n1991). (Again, to satisfy modified FEO one must either effectively\nprevent parents and other guardian figures from rearing their children\nin ways that distort ambition formation or effectively institute\nsocial policies that entirely offset this untoward influence on\nchildren's upbringing. Also, to fully implement modified FEO one would\nbe required either to eliminate diffuse social distortions operating\non ambition formation or effectively counteract them.) The idea of one person having the same native talent as another,\ninvoked in the statement of FEO, is unclear. Consider a simple\nexample.  Suppose we could install just one of two educational\nprograms in a two-person society consisting of Smith and Jones. One\nprovides more intensive education, the other a more relaxed\nschooling. Under the intensive regime, Jones ends up with higher\nearnings prospects, and under the relaxed regime, Smith ends up with\nhigher earnings prospects.  Which to choose? Equality of fair\nopportunity does not say. Or taken strictly, with the construal that\nthe capacity to respond to schooling is a talent, FEO requires only\nthat persons with identical dispositions to develop exactly the same\nskill level in any schooling and socialization regime qualify as\nhaving the same talent, and the proposal is silent about choices that\nwould produce different results for different individuals with\ndifferent talents in this strict sense.  Since in practice we only\ndiscover what talents people have by subjecting them to one or another\nschooling regime, FEO, which had looked severely strict, now looks to\nbe lax and undemanding. What must be added to FEO to respond to this\ndifficulty is some sensible continuity requirement, so that if two\nindividuals' capacities to develop skills through schooling are\n“close”, the developed skills they acquire (and ultimately\ntheir competitive success) should not be “too\ndissimilar.” Equal opportunity norms are linked to the ideal of a society in\nwhich wrongful discrimination does not occur. Regarding fair equality\nof opportunity, the linkage is not tight. What look to be wrongful discrimination and fulfillment of FEO\ncould coexist, if FEO is not construed as incorporating formal\nequality of opportunity but as a freestanding requirement. Suppose\nsociety is divided into mutually hostile racial and ethnic groups,\neach of which has roughly the same wealth, population, and social\npower.  Members of each group favor their own in economic decision\nmaking. The result is that the economy is divided into racial and\nethnic spheres of influence. People of Scandinavian ancestry dominate\nthe winter resort industry; people of Asian ancestry dominate the\nfinancial services industry, and so on. Formal equality of opportunity\nis routinely violated, because applicants of Scandinavian background\nare favored in winter resort hirings, applicants of Asian background\nare favored in competition for financial service posts, and so on. But\noverall, it happens to turn out that those with equal talent and equal\nambition have overall equal prospects for success in competitions for\npositions that confer advantages, so FEO is satisfied. (Either members\nfrom each group form only ambitions for success in the types of\nenterprises in which members of their particular group are dominant,\nor for each person with given talents, lack of opportunity in one\nrange of competitions for advantage is exactly offset by above-average\nopportunity is some other range of competitions for advantage, so each\nperson with the same talent and same ambition has the same prospects\nfor competitive success.)  The situation just described might seem\nunlikely to persist, but we might imagine government policy operating\nto sustain the conditions in which non-inclusive FEO is fulfilled even\nthough formal equality of opportunity is not. We might also imagine a more benign version of a society in which\nmembers of each separate and distinct group in society cluster\ntogether and favor each other in economic and social interactions. We\nwould then see industrial and occupational clumping: Those of Korean\ndescent might dominate the hotel industry, while those of Hispanic\ndescent might dominate construction; women might be more likely to be\nlawyers and doctors, men more likely to be business entrepreneurs, and\nso on. We might imagine that group members are not moved by prejudice\nor animus against members of other groups. Rather people find it more\ncomfortable to work with fellow group members rather than outsiders;\ntrust is easier to build and sustain within groups than across\nthem. We would expect opportunities to be vastly unequal across group\nlines when this situation obtains, but it is conceivable that this is\nnot so: suppose non-inclusive FEO is satisfied. The situation might be\none in which reasonable statistical discrimination is rampant: the\nfact that one is a woman is a good indicator one will prove to be a\ngood team member in a law firm consisting of women lawyers, and so\non. If this is so, the society exhibiting social group clustering in\neconomic cooperation might satisfy formal equality of opportunity as\nwell as non-inclusive FEO. Another possibility is that formal equality\nof opportunity is massively violated in this society, yet\nnon-inclusive FEO is satisfied. The example presses on our attention\nthe issue, which norm should take priority, have greater weight,\nformal equality of opportunity or non-inclusive FEO, when they come in\nconflict.\n  Equality of opportunity ideals apply to the process that selects\npolitical rulers and political decisions. Consider two conceptions of\ndemocratic equality. Formal democratic equality requires that all\nlong-term residents of a political society be eligible to become\ncitizens and that all citizens are eligible to vote and stand for\noffice in free and fair elections that pick law-makers for the\nsociety.  In addition, formal democratic equality requires that\ninfluential officials charged with executing the law should either be\n(1) elected in fair and free elections or (2) appointed by the\nlaw-makers or (3) appointed through some process that selects\napplicants according to their qualifications. As sketched, formal\ndemocratic equality could be satisfied in a society in which only\nwealthy individuals are in practice able to run for political office\nand only graduates of certain elite schools are able to have any\ninfluence at all on the policy decisions and laws enacted by the\ngovernment. One might then espouse a substantive ideal of democratic\nequality, which would be satisfied in a formally democratic society\njust in case any individuals with the same political talent and the\nsame ambition to influence public policy have the same prospect of\ninfluencing public policy choice (Rawls 1999, 2001; Christiano\n1996). Substantive democratic equality is akin to Rawlsian fair equality\nof opportunity in the sphere of politics. (Only “akin to”,\nbecause the former requires that those with equal developed political\ntalent and political ambition have the same prospects of political\ninfluence, whereas the latter requires equal prospects for those with\nequal native talent and equal ambition.) One can view recent political\ncontroversies regarding initiatives to limit the impact of lobbyists\nand wealthy political donors on the democratic political process\nthrough the lens of this ideal. A society might institute public\nfunding of political campaigns and restrictions on private donations\nto political campaigns in order to make progress toward approximating\nthe democratic equality ideal. Implementing the substantive ideal of democratic equality might\nconflict with other justice norms (Estlund 2000). Suppose that\nrestrictions on campaign financing and lobbying by interest groups\nreduce the influence of the wealthy on political policy choices, so\nthat democratic equality is more nearly fulfilled. It might be the\ncase that the now prohibited extra contributions of the wealthy would\nhave enhanced the quality of political deliberation and produced\nbetter informed and substantively more just political decisions and\nhence more just laws and public policies. If it was discovered that a\ntrade-off of this sort exists, one might believe that the pursuit of\nsubstantive democratic equality should be curtailed and that an\noptimal balance among the conflicting justice values should be\ndefined. Some might hold that the point of democratic politics is to\nproduce just laws and policies and substantively just outcomes\ngenerally and that substantive democratic equality should have no\nweight against this fundamental aim and should be pursued just to the\nextent it is a means to substantive justice. Fair equality of fair opportunity is a severe doctrine. Its\nrequirements extend far beyond the injunction to eschew public-sphere\ndiscrimination. How stringent the policy implications of FEO become\ndepends on the relative priority assigned to this principle as against\nother fundamental moral requirements. The question arises whether there is some plausible intermediate\nposition that renders equality of opportunity more demanding than\nformal equality of opportunity but less demanding than FEO. One such\nintermediate position already described combines formal equality of\nopportunity with the additional requirement that society provide good\nenough opportunities for all its members to develop their native\ntalents so as to become qualified for competitive positions. The idea\nhere would be that there is some threshold level of opportunity to\ndevelop one's native talents into skills to which all are\nentitled. The challenge for one attracted to this position would be to\ndevelop a theory of the “good enough.” Another possible intermediate position combines formal equality of\nopportunity with the requirement that present effects of past wrongful\nviolations of formal equality of opportunity should be fully offset.\nAccording to this conception of equal opportunity, if Catholics\nsuffered violations of formal equality of opportunity for many years\nin a nation in which Protestantism was the officially privileged\nstate-established religion, and these wrongful violations reduced the\nwealth of Catholics and their descendants, ceasing now to impose any\nfurther violations of formal equality of opportunity on Catholics does\nnot establish a regime of genuine equality of opportunity, since some\ncontinue to benefit, others to suffer, from past wrongs. But once\nrecompense is made for past wrongful discrimination, formal equality\nof opportunity suffices. An extension of this view would hold that the\neffects of all unjust policies and practices insofar as they affect\npeople's present opportunities to become qualified for competitions\nregulated by formal equality of opportunity should be undone (Buchanan\net al. 2000: chapter 3). A third possible intermediate position combines formal equality of\nopportunity with the requirement that state action should treat all\ncitizens equally and not confer arbitrary advantages on some along\nwith arbitrary disadvantages on others. On this view, even the\nsubstantive aspect of equality of opportunity is a deontological\nrequirement, a moral constraint on permissible action, not a\nspecification of a goal that morally ought to be achieved. Call this\nposition the deontological requirement interpretation of\nequality of opportunity. Unlike FEO, the deontological requirement\ndoes not hold that substantive equality of opportunity is violated if\nsome parents provide better educational opportunities for their\nchildren than other parents. The deontological requirement does not\nspecify that a society must establish a system of state-funded\neducation. But if the state does operate schools or provides funds to\ndefray the costs of some children's education, the state violates the\ndeontological requirement if its schools or disbursements of funds to\nparents earmarked for children do not operate in an evenhanded manner\nbut instead arbitrarily confer advantages on some over\nothers. Operating schools for Roman Catholics only or paying for the\nschool tuition only of children who attend Roman Catholic schools\nwould be clear cases of violation of the deontological\ninterpretation. A perhaps more controversial example would be the\noperation by the state of public schools funded by general tax\nrevenues that are formally open to all resident children but are\nphysically accessible only to children who can walk normally or set at\na level such that some severely retarded or otherwise cognitively\nimpaired children can gain no benefit from the instruction that is\nprovided. According to the deontological requirement of equal\ntreatment, these policies would be violations of equality of\nopportunity if and only if they arbitrarily advantage some children\nand disadvantage others. The equal treatment norm, strictly interpreted, is a significant\nconstraint on policy choice. Suppose equal treatment is interpreted as\nrequiring that a government service that is provided to some citizens\nshall be provided to all without discrimination against any group of\ncitizens. Next imagine that the government proposes to provide health\ncare coverage to all citizens and to ration coverage so as to maximize\nthe number of quality-adjusted years of life (QALYs) secured by health\ncare. Any scheme of this sort will recommend discrimination against\ndisabled citizens, in the sense that the scheme will tend to recommend\nprovision of treatment to an otherwise able person afflicted with some\nillness while recommending against treatment of a disabled person\nafflicted with a comparable case of the same illness (this\nrecommendation occurs whenever this course of action is\nQALY-maximizing) (Brock 2000). Virtually any distributive norm that\nrecommends raising or lowering the level of benefits to be provided\nfor individuals depending on a comparison of costs of provision to\nwell-being gains achieved for the recipient will conflict with equal\ntreatment interpreted as requiring no discrimination among citizens on\nsuch a basis. A problematic but illuminating case is age discrimination (Daniels\n1988, McKerlie 1989, 1999, 2013; Temkin 1993: chapter 8). A society\nmight establish a state policy that mandates transfers of resources\nfrom older to younger citizens, by using public funds to operate\nschools for the education of children. A society might also follow a\nhealth care policy that rations life-preserving care made available to\nthe very old in order to reduce the extent to which expensive medical\ntechnology extends the lifespans of very old people with reduced\nquality of life. In the same spirit, the society might tilt health\ncare policies toward saving the lives of very young people threatened\nwith premature death. In short, the society enacts coercive state\npolicies that favor the young over the old. Such a policy counts as\ndenial of equal treatment if the units to be treated equally are\npersons (of any age) at a given time. The policy is arguably\nconsistent with equal treatment if the units to be treated equally are\nindividuals over their whole lives. At least, this would be so if all\nindividuals lived through youth to the same old age. In the world in\nwhich everyone lived to old age, discrimination against the old would\nbe unlike discrimination in favor of Catholics and against\nProtestants, or in favor of men and against women, or in favor of\nwhites and against Hispanics. The exception to all these cases,\ndiscrimination against the old would be consistent with equal\ntreatment of each individual over the course of her life. If the\nunrealistic assumption that all live to the same old age is dropped,\nthen equal treatment with the units to be treated equally being\nindividuals over the course of their lives would seem to forbid any\nexpenditure at all on the health care of the old who have already\nreceived more than those who died at a young age. The example of age discrimination either discredits the equal\ntreatment norm or indicates that it cries out for further\ninterpretation. Surely some denials of literal equal treatment do not\nviolate any plausible equal opportunity norm. If the state provides\nhealth care coverage to all citizens, the sick will get treatment and\nthe well will get no treatment, but this is not an invidious\ninequality. One might say all equally are eligible for health care if\nthey need it. But in general, many seemingly morally acceptable state\npolicies will have different effects on different groups of citizens.\nIf a law is passed instituting policies to preserve the environment\nfor future generations, some present citizens will benefit, and some,\nsuch as loggers who have been working on old-growth redwoods, will\nlose. One might interpret the equal treatment norm as requiring that\nin the aggregate over the long haul, coercive state policies should\nbenefit roughly all citizens to an equal extent. (But why must\nbenefits in the long run be equal for all?) On this view,\nsociety acting through the state is not required to do anything to\noffset inequalities it has not caused (included in this set of\ninequalities are many that would be eliminated under a Rawlsian FEO\npolicy). But if the state acts in a way that affects people's life\nprospects, it should act in an evenhanded way that boosts everyone's\nlife prospects to roughly the same extent. Notice that the equal\ntreatment norm would be unproblematically satisfied by a state that\ndid nothing for its citizens. Also, if children of wealthy parents\nwill receive excellent education whatever the state does and will have\nfine life prospects that can be boosted only by a little bit by state\nprovision of education, then equal treatment would seem to require the\nstate to provide only small amounts of state-provided or state-funded\neducation with benefits spread so none get a significantly bigger\nboost than the children of the wealthy get from state aid. (But see\nPogge 1989: 44–46.) The variety of conceptions of equality of opportunity suggests the\ncomplexity of the task of assessing what are called “affirmative\naction” programs in societies that are marred by a history of\ncaste hierarchy and systematic discrimination that excludes some\ngroups in the population from any significant access to the fruits of\nsocial cooperation. Consider a stylized example. Suppose that in the U.S., whites have\nenjoyed superior social status, enforced by law and social custom, for\ndecades, going back to times in which blacks were enslaved. Now whites\non the average have greater wealth and education and blacks have less.\nSuppose that formal equality of opportunity is now proclaimed as the\nlaw of the land and embraced by popular morality. Still, most superior\npositions in society continue to go to whites. In this context a\nvariety of measures might be adopted with the aim of increasing the\neffective opportunities enjoyed by blacks. Special educational\nresources might be channeled to them. For a time, to unsettle the\nstatus quo in which whites enjoy the lion's share of social\nprivileges, quotas might be imposed by law or social custom. The quota\nrequires that special preference be given to blacks when employment\ndecisions are made until blacks and whites share in the superior\npositions and posts of society in proportion to their numbers. Affirmative action programs of this sort might be justified on the\nground that in a world where discrimination persists, coercive\nimposition of quotas helps here and now to bring about greater\nfulfillment of formal equality of opportunity. The quota might exert\nan effect that roughly counter-balances the opposite effect of\ncontinuing unacknowledged discrimination. Here is a stylized example\nthat illustrates how this could occur. Suppose that those responsible\nfor making hires are prejudiced, and this takes the form of (in\neffect) assigning extra points to white applicants. A white applicant\nwho merits 60 points on a 100 point scale gets assigned 70 points. If\nwe respond by legally requiring the assignment of 10 extra points to\nall nonwhite applicants, to offset the bias, the hiring officials\nmight unconsciously respond by boosting the scores of white applicants\nstill further, so that the tilt in favor of hiring whites remains\nintact. In these circumstances, if (a big if) the social planner can\nestimate what proportion of nonwhite applicants will be more qualified\nthan whites, a rigid quota that requires the hiring of a specified\nproportion of nonwhite to white applicants can bring about hiring\nresults that do better at achieving formal equality of opportunity\nthan either the policy of letting firms hire as they please or the\npolicy of requiring firms to favor nonwhite applicants by boosting the\nmerit ratings of their applications. Another, more likely scenario is that the two components of the\nRawlsian FEO might come into conflict in situations of persistent\ndisadvantage imposed on people on the basis of their supposed race or\nskin color. Suppose that educational opportunities for nonwhites,\ncompared to those provided for whites, are subpar. The result is that\nindividuals of different races with the same native talent and the\nsame ambition face very unequal prospects of competitive\nsuccess—greater if they are white, lesser if they are nonwhite.\nNow imagine that an affirmative action plan of reverse discrimination\nis put into effect. In violation of formal equality of opportunity,\nnonwhite applicants are favored over equally qualified\nwhites. Depending on the details of the affirmative action plan,\nespecially the extent to which the plan favors nonwhites over whites,\nthe result might be that while formal equality of opportunity is\nviolated, substantive equality of opportunity (those with the same\nnative talent and the same ambition have the same prospects of\ncompetitive success) is more nearly achieved than it would have been\nhad formal equality of opportunity been sustained. One might doubt that any good would come of attempts to achieve the\nsubstantive equality of opportunity component of FEO by violating\nformal equality of opportunity. Hiring the unqualified will bring it\nabout that they flounder in their posts, the jobs are less well done,\nsocial conflict increases, and society suffers. So one might\nspeculate. This dismal outcome might or might not come\nabout. Violating formal equality of opportunity to fulfill substantive\nequality need not dictate hiring the unqualified, just the less\nqualified. The affirmative action plan might be constrained by a rule\nthat forbids stretching the preference given to nonwhites to the point\nthat basic competence to perform the tasks associated with the post\nthat is being filled is lacking in those selected. In some cases,\nthose denied educational advantages but natively talented may if hired\nrespond with alacrity to the demands of the position in which they\nfind themselves, and learn on the job faster than might have been\nexpected. But whether the expected consequences generated by an\naffirmative action plan that violates formal equality of opportunity\nare bad, good, or neutral, there remains the violation of formal\nequality of opportunity, which some will view as in itself a grave\ninjustice.  Defenders of affirmative action programs that violate the careers\nopen to talents norm might respond in either of two ways to the\nconcern that \"Don't discriminate against applicants\non the basis of race, sex, creed, or color\" is a strict deontological\nrequirement, a constraint on just public policy.   \nOne response would be to uphold the substantive equality of\nopportunity component of Rawlsian FEO as itself a strict deontological\nrequirement and one that trumps careers open to talents. Another\nresponse would be to defend affirmative action on the ground that its\njudicious deployment would be likely to increase the extent to which\nFEO is fulfilled in the long run. Here the idea presumably would be\nthat the existence of quotas would unsettle expectations and lead to\nchanges in socialization and belief formation. The factual claims on\nwhich this type of justification rests might be disputed. But disputes\nmight also pit the two components of FEO, formal and substantive\nequality of opportunity, against each other. To settle such disputes\nwould require a definitive assessment of the conceptions of equality\nof opportunity and an authoritative determination of the weight that\nequality of opportunity on its various construals should have against\nother justice values. Does a society that embraces and fulfills equality of opportunity\n(rightly interpreted) necessarily provide social mobility? In a word,\nNo. To illustrate the point, consider a society whose population is\ndivided into deciles by household income (the income of adult partners\ncombined and of each adult living alone and as sole head of\nhousehold). Identify social mobility in this society with the chance\nthat any given individual will as an adult live in a household that\nplaces in a higher decile of household income than the one in which he\nwas placed as a child, along with the chance that he will end up in a\nlower decile. Social mobility in the society is high to the degree\nthat knowing an individual's decile of family origin is not predictive\nof his own decile and low to the degree that this information is\npredictive. A low degree of social mobility may be an indicator that the idea\nof careers open to talents is significantly violated. Children of poor\nfamilies are not eligible to apply for plummy positions, or if they\nare eligible and do apply, their applications are discounted, not\nfairly assessed on their merits with a guide to choosing who gets\noffered the positions. A low degree of social mobility might also be\nan indicator the society fails by a very wide margin to satisfy\nFEO. Of course learning that society fails to satisfy FEO would hardly\nbe a surprise: surely no modern society has ever done so.  But a\nsociety might be closer or further from satisfying FEO, and low social\nmobility might indicate that the society's divergence from FEO is very\nlarge indeed. But what might be so here is not necessarily so. A society could in\ntheory perfectly satisfy careers open to talents while the position in\nthe social hierarchy into which an individual is born entirely\ndetermines the prospects for becoming qualified for desirable\ncompetitive posts and being selected to fill them. A perhaps more\ninteresting possibility is that a society could perfectly satisfy FEO\nor some other version of substantive equality of opportunity and also\nexhibit a very low degree of social mobility or even none at all.  In\nthe illustrative example, this scenario unfolds if the family of\norigin income decile of every member of society perfectly predicts\nthat person's own family income. There are two ways, both of them disturbing and unsettling, by\nwhich a society of zero social mobility could simultaneously satisfy\nFEO. One is that the rank order of each person's genetically given\nnative talent endowment mirrors the rank order of each person's family\nof origin income. If there are 100 persons in the current generation\nof individuals and your native talent endowment is overall\n40th-best, your family of origin income is also\n40th-best, and the same holds for every other member of the\ncurrent generation. If any two people in society have the same native\ntalent endowment and the same ambition, they have the same prospects\nfor competitive success, and their family of origin incomes will also\nbe the same. Another possible mechanism is that ambition formation\ntracks family of origin income position (via some process that does\nnot itself violate FEO), so that no persons with the same native\ntalent endowment and different family of origin incomes have the same\nambition, so their having different prospects of competitive success\ndoes not violate FEO. There could also be social dynamics that involve\nmixes of the two ways to produce satisfaction of FEO along with zero\nsocial mobility. Many contemporary societies have made undeniable progress toward\nsatisfying careers open to talents, and some have at least moved\nforward by inches toward the distant goal of satisfaction of FEO. In\nthese societies one can detect seeds that could blossom into a highly\nmeritocratic society with no social mobility. Here is a stylized description of the recent history of affluent\nindustrialized societies. Social barriers to women's participation in\nthe labor market and in the full range of economic roles are gradually\ndismantled, and women do come to participate on more equal terms with\nmen. These developments increase the degree to which careers open to\ntalents and FEO are fulfilled. There is real progress. The twist is\nthat one might speculate that via assortative mating, over time those\nwith more native talent than others are more successful and have\nchildren who have more native talent than others and in turn are more\nsuccessful. In the long run, native talent endowment and family of\norigin social class position run together for all members of\nsociety. Even now, “The winners in the new economy are marrying\neach other and consolidating their gains”, a sociologist\ndescribing U.S. marriage trends comments (Cherlin 2010: 179; see also\nEsping-Anderson 2009: 59–70). Of course the couples described in this statement are consolidating\ntheir gains not simply by passing on their genes to their offspring\nbut also by investing resources in their children to give them a\nspecial boost over others in the social competitions they will face as\nadults. So the trend involves behavior that if unopposed produces\ncontinuous large violations of FEO. But notice that in theory a\nsorting of people with more favorable genetic endowment into higher\nincome classes could yield a situation in which the favorably endowed\nrich lavish resources on their children to enhance their competitive\nskills, so rich kids get far better education and socialization than\npoor kids, yet those with the same native talent potential and the\nsame ambition still end up with the same chances of competitive\nsuccess, so FEO is satisfied. In theory a perfect meritocracy\n(satisfying both careers open and non-inclusive FEO) can be a rigidly\nstratified class hierarchy with no movement of individuals from the\nsocial class of their birth. Even if the scenario just described in empirically far-fetched, its\nconceptual possibility raises questions about equal opportunity\nnorms. Should we view the envisaged triumph of meritocracy with\nequanimity or moral alarm? One response is that this line of thought\njust reinforces the point that these two equal opportunity norms do\nnot add up to a full theory of social justice. Maybe satisfaction of\nequal opportunity norms is necessary but not sufficient for social\njustice. Another response is that reflection on the idea of a\nmeritocracy drives home the point that the various norms of equal\nopportunity can in practice come into conflict with each other and\nwith other social justice ideals. To some extent our wholehearted\nembrace of equal opportunity may be supported by a tendency to imagine\nthat increasing fulfillment of equal opportunity goes hand in hand\nwith increasing fulfillment of several social justice desiderata. A\nhalo effect influences our judgment. A recognition of this bias in\njudgment prompts the question, how much if at all we ought to care\nabout equal opportunity norms for their own sakes, when their greater\nfulfillment comes at the cost of lesser fulfillment of other\nvalues. The relationships among the various values and norms jostling for\nposition here are complex. Notice that if our foremost concern were to\nestablish and sustain a society in which careers open to talents along\nwith the substantive equality component of FEO is satisfied and there\nis also a high level of social mobility, one strategy would be to ban\nassortative mating or enact policies that discourage\nit. “Assortative mating” simply refers to people choosing\nto cohabit with those who are like themselves along some favored\ndimensions of similarity. These dimensions might include race,\nreligion, national origin, level of education, inherited wealth,\nphysical attractiveness, charm, or marketable talent. The assortative\nmating that reduces social mobility involves sorting by factors that\ngive rise to unequal income, wealth, and status.  Although many might\ndislike the outcomes of such assortative mating, few would countenance\nrestrictions on individual liberty to date and marry in whatever way\npeople happen to come together by mutual consent. However, social\npolicies could alter people's incentives without directly restricting\ntheir liberty to date and mate as they choose. For example, highly\nprogressive taxation rates on income and wealth would reduce the\nfinancial gains that two well-off persons could achieve by getting\nmarried. The question also arises whether we should care about maintaining a\nhigh level of social mobility for its own sake, as opposed to caring\nabout other features of society with which social mobility might be\ncontingently associated and causally linked. For example, it might be\nthe case that establishing and sustaining a society of democratic\nequality in which all members share a fundamental equal status and\nrelate as equals might be incompatible with a skewed distribution of\nincome and wealth beyond some threshold level and with lack of social\nmobility below some threshold level. If so, then if we have good\nreason to care about democratic equality either for its own sake or\ninstrumentally we also have good reasons to care about increasing\nsocial mobility as its prerequisite.  There is a dimension of equality of opportunity not yet mentioned.\nImagine a warrior society in which only martial prowess and\naccomplishment confer status and reward. The society might perfectly\nconform both to formal and substantive equality of opportunity. Any\nadult member of society is encouraged to apply for any warrior post\nthat becomes open and all applications are assessed fairly on their\nmerits. The most qualified candidate is offered the post and, if she\nturns down the offer, the second-most-qualified receives an offer, and\nso on. Moreover, educational arrangements bring it about that any two\npersons in the society with the same ambition and native abilities\nwill have the same prospects of success in competition for warrior\nposts.  Despite fulfilling formal and substantive equality of\nopportunity, the society just sketched is deficient from the standard\nof equality of opportunity. To see this, consider that no talents and\naccomplishments except those of warriors are encouraged, developed,\nand rewarded. Those who have the ability to be artists, farmers,\nsingers, story-tellers, rock musicians, or anything else, are just out\nof luck. These people have a complaint that their abilities have no\nscope for expression. The example suggests that equality of opportunity prevails in a\nsociety only when all worthy human capacities are encouraged,\ndeveloped, and rewarded. The wider the range of worthy capacities and\nabilities that a society fosters, other things being equal, the\ngreater the extent to which it achieves equality of opportunity. The\nmore this condition is met in a society, the wider the scope it\nprovides for equality of opportunity (see Schaar 1967 and Galston\n1986).  Feminists have raised this concern with emphasis on its\napplication to the condition of women. A society could satisfy even\nstringent equal opportunity norms even though dominant males control\nresources and set the goals of institutions so that opportunities to\ndevelop capacities that men tend to favor are plentiful and\nopportunities to develop capacities that suit women are scarce. The wide-scope condition on an equality of opportunity ideal admits\nof stronger and weaker versions. On the strong version, all worthy\nhuman capacities must be equally encouraged, developed, and rewarded.\nOn the weakest version, each of these worthy human capacities must be\nencouraged, developed, and rewarded to some extent. One could concoct\nrequirements of intermediate strength. The strong version seems\ndemanding to a bizarre extreme, and illustrates the point that an\nequality of opportunity ideal only seems uncontroversial when left\nvague and unspecified. An alternative view of scope requirements would\nhold that certain social processes that restrict the scope of\nopportunity are unacceptable, but no particular extent of scope is\nmandatory for a society. The equality of opportunity ideals canvassed to this point have\nbeen designed mainly for application to the economic sphere of life\nbroadly construed. When opportunities are equal, people have equal\nopportunities to get ahead. However, it is not obviously the case that\nwhen people advance equal opportunity claims, the background ideal to\nwhich they are appealing is limited to any one sphere of social\nlife. Historic struggles have been waged to secure equal voting rights\nand equal rights to participate in the political process for\ndisenfranchised groups including women, those disfavored on racial\ngrounds, and members of lower-ranked castes. The vote can be used to\nadvance one's economic interests but its significance is not limited\nto that. Having the freedom to participate in political affairs on the\nsame terms as other members of society is an element in being a full\nmember of society equal in fundamental status to all others. At least two possible generalizations of equal opportunity norms\nare worth consideration. One generalization is to all public sphere\ninteractions. Another is to all interactions across the board, private\nas well as public. Public sphere formal equality of opportunity obtains in a society\nif and only if all public sphere institutions and practices and\nassociations are open to all members of society, with selection for\nespecially favorable treatment or appointment to any position in any\nsphere being made on a meritocratic basis. Anyone is eligible to apply\nfor favorable treatment or special appointment, applications are\njudged on their merits, according to relevant criteria of merit for\nthat particular institution, practice, or association, and selection\nproceeds in order of merit. Public sphere substantive equality of\nopportunity obtains if and only if formal public sphere equal\nopportunity obtains and in addition all members of society have some\nsubstantial opportunity to develop traits that would render them\nqualified for any public sphere positions they might seek. Public\nsphere fair equality of opportunity (FEO) obtains if and only if any\ntwo individuals with the same native talent potential for becoming\nqualified for any type of public sphere position and the same ambition\nto become qualified have identical prospects of success in the\ncompetition for such positions. What these wide equal opportunity norms require depends on how one\nshould draw the line between public and private spheres.  Institutions\nestablished and run by the state are in the public sphere, as are\nbusiness firms that seek to sell products and services to individuals\nor to other businesses. A club devoted to playing a sport or promoting\na hobby is in the public sphere, as is a league of such\nclubs. Friendships are in the private sphere. Dating and mating are in\nthe private sphere. Many aspects of family relations involving\nsocializing among family members are in the private sphere. Several\nfriends cooperating together on a project or activity are engaged in\nprivate sphere association, but establishing a club or association to\npromote a general purpose is engaging in the public sphere. The line\nbetween public and private for purposes of applying the public sphere\nequal opportunity norms will no doubt be blurry and indefinite, but\nthat does not per se drain the norms of content or\nsignificance. When wide formal equality of opportunity is satisfied in a society,\npeople receive equal treatment in the judicial system, in the sense\nthat one's likelihood of success in legal proceedings depends only on\nthe merits of one's case and not at all on other factors such as one's\nrace, creed, color, sex or sexual orientation, and so on. In criminal\nproceedings, juries are not more likely to convict or acquit a\ndefendant just because she is white or black or brown, Catholic or\nHindu or atheist, male or female, heterosexual or nonheterosexual, and\nso on. Nor are judges more or less likely to treat one as one ought to\nbe treated according to one's legal rights, depending on one's\nparticular group memberships. Consider the practice of racial profiling in police work (Risse and\nZeckhauser 2004). Suppose that police stop and frisk individuals who\nappear, by a variety of indicators, to be engaged in criminal\nactivity, and that among the indicators is the apparent race or\nethnicity of the individual. Does such a practice violate wide formal\nequality of opportunity? The policy might just reflect racial and\nethnic prejudice and animus on the part of those who control police\npractices, but might instead reflect statistical discrimination, if\nindividuals vary by apparent race or ethnicity in their proclivity to\ncriminal activity. In the latter case, racial profiling might not\nviolate wide formal equality of opportunity. If people engaged in\ncrime are more likely to target as victims members of their own social\ngroups, then failure to engage in racial profiling might bring it\nabout that being of one or another race or ethnicity makes it more\nlikely that one will be a victim of crime, and that fact might violate\nwide fair equality of opportunity.  When wide formal equality of opportunity is satisfied in a society,\npeople receive equal treatment at the hands of state administrative\nagencies and also in noncompetitive receipt of services from business\nfirms and nonprofit agencies. If you are in medical need, and have\npurchased the same medical insurance coverage, you do not receive\nbetter or worse care depending on how treatment providers are disposed\nto respond to your salient group memberships. Same goes if you are a\ncustomer in a restaurant, a client of a professional golf trainer, an\napplicant for a driver's license or for social security benefits to\nwhich one might be entitled, and so on.  A still wider interpretation of equal opportunity norms extends the\ndomain of equal opportunity to all domains both public and\nprivate. Call this universal equal opportunity.  Formal\nuniversal equal opportunity obtains in a society if and only if in any\nand all interactions among members of society, partners and\nparticipants for interaction are selected according to relevant\ncriteria, depending on the nature of the interaction proposed.\nSubstantive universal equal opportunity requires that all members of\nsociety have substantial opportunity to develop traits that would\nrender them eligible for any type of interaction they might seek, and\nuniversal fair equality of opportunity (FEO) is defined in a similar\nway. Universal equality of opportunity has some appeal (see\nLippert-Rasmussen 2014). Consider selection of friends and romantic\nmates and marriage partners. In present-day society, barriers of\nculture, social status, race, and class stand in the way of personal\nrelationships that might otherwise form. If I am white and Christian,\nand feel an inchoate aversion to blacks and Jews, I do not form\nfriendships with members of these groups, or such friendships with\nthem as I do strive to build are fraught and unstable. In the society\nof universal formal equality of opportunity, no one is moved by any\nsuch bias of discriminatory animus or prejudice; we all are\ncolor-blind and race-blind and ethnicity-blind and social status-blind\nand creed-blind in selecting participants in temporary and long-term\nschemes of interaction. If this universal freedom from prejudice and\ndistrust is common knowledge among members of society, or close to\nthat, one might plausibly conjecture that this common knowledge\nbecomes a basis of social solidarity and general civility. Objection: partners for friendship and romance are not selected\naccording to “relevant criteria for interaction”, or at\nleast, are not only selected by any selective process. One can simply\nbecome attracted to another person or group of persons from any\narbitrary cause, and establishing interaction in this arbitrary way is\nnot just appropriate for many kinds of informal interaction but is\nquintessentially appropriate. Reply to objection: For informal interaction, the relevant criteria\nfor selection may include brute attraction on any basis. For some\nforms of interaction, the only relevant criterion is brute attraction\non any basis. For such basically merit-free interactions, universal\nformal equality of opportunity still plays a regulatory role. The role\nconsists of ruling out as inappropriate brute attraction on\ndiscriminatory grounds. The way you wear your hat, the way you sing\noff-key, and virtually anything else may render you eligible for\nsomeone's affection, but not your skin color, your race, your ethnic\nbackground, your social or economic status, and so on. Notice that\nstatistical discrimination is not per se objectionable from\nthe standpoint of formal equality of opportunity, and this holds for\nthe wider extensions of equal opportunity as well. So selecting a\nfriend in part on the basis of accurate stereotypes (not prejudices)\nabout the traits of members of her salient social group, that may be\npredictive of likely successful and fruitful friendship, does not\nper se violate formal universal equality of\nopportunity. However, if someone's group membership traits are\npredictive of successful friendship with me because I have a brute or\nprejudiced aversion to members of certain salient social groups,\nhooking together for interaction on that basis offends against that\nwide equal opportunity norm. To sum up: Formal universal equality of\nopportunity is not inherently inappropriate for the assessment of\npeople's engagement in personal and private and intimate\ninteraction. Moreover, the norm would have substantive content in this\napplication, and restrain the types of interaction formation in which\npeople engage. The ideal is essentially the ideal of a social world in\nwhich people lack irrational prejudice and animus against members of\nother groups, and this ideal is just as attractive in private as in\npublic settings. Just as it would be morally wrong for me to decline\nto write a letter of recommendation for someone for a job because I\nharbor hostility to his racial makeup, it would be morally wrong for\nme to decline an offer of friendship from the same person just from\naversion to his racial makeup. State enforcement of universal formal equality of opportunity in\nits private sphere applications would almost certainly do more harm\nthan good. However, the fact that we do not want the police arresting\npeople who choose friends on some allegedly prejudiced basis does not\nrule out enforcement of this universal social norm. Enforcement of\nsocial norms including this one might be carried out effectively by\nenlightened public opinion expressing itself in attitudes and private\nsphere choices. One might hold that for a genuine social norm to be in\nplace in a society, there must be some enforcement mechanism in\nplace. The norm states what in some sense you ought to do, and what\nyou will be in some sense punished for not doing. Although informal enforcement of wide equal opportunity norms is\npossible, one might question the desirability of the ideals and the\nacceptability of their enforcement. Maybe any feasible social norm of\nthis sort would exercise too much regulatory control over matters that\nare best left to wide unencumbered individual freedom, and dampen too\nmuch that is merely idiosyncratic, eccentric, or just nondeliberative\nand spontaneous.  Equality of opportunity in its various guises would appear to be\napt for legal enforcement. Equal opportunity is proclaimed to be an\nessential plank in the edifice of social justice, and justice demands\nare obligatory not optional. The moral presumption is that justice\ndemands should be enforced, and in the absence of anarchy, the state\nhas the role of coercive enforcement of justice. In practice, in modern societies, the modes of legal enforcement\nare various, and pursued with varying degrees of commitment.  For\nexample, vigorous enforcement of prohibitions of violent assault\nacross a territory would contribute to the equal opportunity of women\nalong with men to move freely and with safety across the\nterritory. Here wide formal opportunity of opportunity is at\nstake. We might move in the direction of fair equality of opportunity by\nmaintaining public schools financed by general tax revenue.  Further\nmoves are possible. A state might require that local governments\nequalize spending per pupil across school districts of varying\nwealth. A state might mandate extra spending per pupil in low-income\nschool districts, with a view to offsetting extra resources provided\nto children with affluent and well-educated parents. A state might\nmandate mixing students from different neighborhoods in comprehensive\nschools so that children from low-income and high-income families are\nevenly spread across area schools. A state might ban privately\nfinanced schools at the primary and secondary level in order to\nprevent high-income parents from avoiding measures to promote equal\nopportunity in public schools. And so on. In the contemporary U.S.,\neven the first-mentioned of these FEO-promoting measures is\ncontroversial. As with almost any legal rule, the hope is that enforcing equal\nopportunity norms will not simply coerce people's behavior but will\ncontribute to changing the hearts and minds of men and women so that\nthe norms become internalized. Liberals propose free debate, along\nwith justified coercion of behavior, as the engine propelling this\nchange. Limits on freedom of expression might be proposed to the same\npurpose. Catharine MacKinnon observes that   it is\nimpossible for an individual to receive equality of opportunity when\nsurrounded by an atmosphere of group hate. (MacKinnon 1993)\n  In this spirit, section 319(2) of the Canadian\nCriminal Code states that   Every one who, by\ncommunicating statements, other than in private conversation,\nwillfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group\n  is guilty of a criminal offense, except that\nthere are exceptions for any statements that are true, good faith\nreligious argument, good faith contributions to public debate on\nmatters of public interest, and statements that call attention to\nhate-promoting conditions with a view to their removal.  Some other\nnations have similar provisions against hate speech. In the same vein, some feminists have argued that some of what used\nto be regarded as obscene materials should be reclassified as\npornography that constitutes a violation of the civil rights of women\nand counts as discrimination against them. The antifemale pornography\nthat these arguments target is sexually explicit material that\nportrays women as inferior or as apt for subordination or other forms\nof mistreatment. Some suggest that the publication and dissemination\nof this material impinges on the freedom of speech of women by\ncreating a social atmosphere in which their would-be contributions are\nnot taken seriously and not treated on their merits in public debate\nand in some cases cannot be understood (so some members of the public\nare effectively unable to make certain assertions) (Mackinnon 1987,\n1993; Langton 1993). The issues raised here can serve as illustration\nof the ways in which pressing an equal opportunity agenda might not\nonly unsettle traditional views about how to balance conflicting\npolitical values but might also transform our understanding of exactly\nwhat values are in play in such a balancing exercise. In modern societies, legal prohibitions and restrictions of\ndiscrimination clearly aim in some sense at establishing and\nsustaining equal opportunity. In what sense? Legal doctrines of\ndiscrimination are complex and differ from country to country. In many\njurisdictions the law distinguishes between disparate treatment and\ndisparate impact. For example, U.S. employment law forbids disparate treatment of\nprotected groups in an employer's decisions about hiring, promotion,\nand conditions and benefits of work. Disparate treatment includes\ndenying an applicant a position for which she is otherwise qualified\non the basis of her race. The law also regulates disparate impact, as\nfollows. If an employer uses a hiring procedure that has a disparate\nimpact on members of protected groups, defined by race, color,\nreligion, sex, and national origin, that fact establishes a prima\nfacie case. Disparate impact occurs if the proportion of\nprotected-category applicants who are hired is smaller than their\nproportion in the relevant labor pool. If the employer is sued, and a\nprima facie case is established, she can rebut the prima\nfacie case by showing that the hiring procedure in question is\njob-related and justified by business necessity, unless the government\nagency or individuals bringing suit can propose an alternative hiring\ntest that is just as good for the purpose and would not have disparate\nimpact. The comparable Canadian law requires that an employer make\n“reasonable accommodation, short of undue hardship” to\navoid disparate impact roughly as just described. The disparate treatment of U.S. employment law forbids statistical\ndiscrimination against members of protected groups. For example, an\nemployer might consider being prone to absenteeism a decisive\ndisqualification for a particular job, and have sound statistical\nevidence that women (who might have caretaking responsibilities that\nprevent them from coming to work) and blacks (who must rely on\nunreliable public transportation to arrive at the work site) are more\nlikely than white and Hispanic males to display absenteeism, and\nrestrict hiring to white and Hispanic males on this basis. The law\nrequires that an employer's decision to hire should be based on\nparticular evidence about individual candidates not statistical\ngeneralizations. Some have raised doubts about the justifiability of disparate\nimpact restrictions on employers. The claim is that disparate\ntreatment involves wrongful discrimination, an appropriate target of\nlegal prohibition. In contrast, disparate impact restriction targets a\nsupposed bad effect that arises from the aggregate of many innocent\nacts by business firms making employment decisions. If the point of\nthe law is to bring about a more just distribution of opportunities,\nthis should be done by public policy instruments that spread the\nburden of advancing this desirable social goal across all members of\nsociety in some fair manner. There is no basis for singling out the\ngroup of employers whose practices happen to result in disparate\nimpact and requiring them to shoulder the load for all of us.  Some go further and raise doubts about whether disparate impact\nlegal restrictions can be justified as seeking to promote (what should\nbe regarded as) a just distribution of opportunities. Further doubts\nconcern whether these laws, even if aimed at a genuine justice goal,\nare an effective means to any such goal. However, the contrast between laws that aim to advance a public\npolicy aim and laws that aim to prohibit or restrict wrongful conduct\nmay be ill drawn. Suppose that disparate impact laws amount to a mild\nform of affirmative action. The law requires that if an employer can\nchoose among several alternative employment practices, all roughly\nequally effective in advancing her business aims, she must choose the\none that does the most to advance the hiring and promotion of members\nof protected and under-represented groups. If the affirmative action\ngoals the law promotes are worthwhile, and disparate impact is a\nreasonably effective means of advancing them, then the individual\narguably does wrong by not cooperating in this social justice\ninitiative by conforming to law. The wrong does not consist in conduct\nthat can be characterized as immoral apart from the existence of the\nlaw, but is simply wrongful violation of a justified law. (An\nalternative view would be that if there was a widespread voluntary\npractice of accepting certain restrictions on conduct to advance a\nsocial justice goal, an individual who deviates from the practice\nwithout good reason would be unfairly failing to contribute her bit to\nthis justice-promoting practice and hence behaving wrongly.) This\ntrain of thought assumes that the scheme to advance the social justice\ngoal does not unfairly disadvantage an affected class of people, but\nthis constraint does not necessarily demand equal sharing of burdens\namong all members of society.  Sometimes the fact that one is uniquely\nwell placed to advance a worthy goal at small expense to oneself\nwarrants requiring one to absorb the costs of taking the necessary\nsteps. Affirmative action, as already noted in this entry, might serve\nseveral distinct equal opportunity goals. Affirmative action including\ndisparate impact restrictions might simply be a cost-effective means\nto squash disparate treatment that would otherwise escape legal\nconstraints. In a situation where disparate treatment exists but would\nbe hard to prove, disparate impact may be easier to prove. If so,\ndisparate impact laws would be aimed at increasing the degree to which\nthe ideal of careers open to talents is fulfilled. Affirmative action might in some circumstances involve imposing\ntemporary violations of careers open to talents in order to increase\nthe long-term fulfillment of this ideal. Affirmative action might\nserve as a form of redress for past wrongs, compensating victims of\nwrongful discrimination in the past for their losses. Affirmative\naction might be a means to advance fair equality of opportunity (FEO)\nor some other substantive ideal of equality of opportunity. Any or all of these proposed rationales might be challenged either\non the ground that the rationale itself is normatively objectionable\nor that the means used to advance it are unfair or unduly restrictive\nof liberty or the like.  The conceptions of equality of opportunity canvassed so far are\nintended to be components of a theory of justice, but not all of it or\neven the central core of it. The general idea is that on some\nunspecified basis, a social hierarchy with superior and inferior\npositions is justified. The question then arises, on what basis should\nindividuals gain access to superior positions (and be relegated to\ninferior positions)? Equality of opportunity is proposed as an answer\nor partial answer to that question. Equality of opportunity for access\nto superior positions might also be advanced as a condition that must\nbe satisfied (among others) if the social hierarchy itself is to be\nmorally acceptable. Equality of opportunity of a sort has also been proposed as an\nanswer to a quite different question. In this role equality of\nopportunity is conceived to be playing the central core role in a\ntheory of distributive justice. The central question of distributive\njustice might be formulated in this way: Under what conditions is the\ndistribution of liberties, opportunities, and goods that society makes\navailable to persons just or morally fair? The equality-of-opportunity\ndistributive justice theorist answers that the distribution is just\nonly if it satisfies the norm of equality of opportunity, which\nrequires that unchosen and uncourted inequalities should be eliminated\nand allows that when some individuals are worse off than others but\ncould have avoided this condition by taking care or by making choices\nthat would have been reasonable to make, given equal initial\nconditions and a fair framework for interaction, these inequalities\nmay be left standing. (This condition might be claimed to be\nsufficient for just distribution as well as necessary.) This\nconception of equal opportunity proposed as the central element of\ndistributive justice has been called the level playing field\nideal (Roemer 1995, 1998), and is also known as luck\negalitarianism (Cohen 1989, 2004, 2009; Mason 2006; Segall 2013;\nfor criticism, see Anderson 1999, 2010; Pogge 2000; Buchanan et\nal. 2000; Scheffler 2003, 2005; and Fleurbaey 1995, 2008; for a\nresponse, see Tan 2008, 2012). The term “luck\negalitarianism” was introduced by Elizabeth Anderson. The idea\nis that justice requires levelling the playing field by rendering\neveryone's opportunities equal in an appropriate sense, and then\nletting individual choices and their effects dictate further\noutcomes. If equality of opportunity is a constraint on acceptable social\nhierarchy, luck egalitarian equality of opportunity presses the\nconstraint so far as to subvert the idea of acceptable social\nhierarchy. When luck egalitarianism is fully satisfied, the only\ninequalities that are acceptable are such that those who get the short\nend of the stick could have become as well off as anyone else by\npursuing a course of action it would have been reasonable for them to\ntake and not impossible for them to take and not so difficult to\npursue that it would be unreasonable to hold them responsible for not\npursuing it. Hence one advocate characterizes luck egalitarianism as\n“socialist equality of opportunity” (Cohen 2009). Another way to mark the difference between formal and substantive\nequality of opportunity on the one hand and level-the-playing-field\n(luck egalitarian) equality of opportunity on the other is to note\nthat the former sets conditions on people fairly gaining advantageous\npositions in society but says nothing about the amount and kind of\nadvantages that should attach to these positions. In contrast, the\nlatter view when fully elaborated will specify both when and to what\nextent it is morally acceptable that some people are better off, enjoy\ngreater advantages, than others.  A complication is that one might conceivably formulate a version of\nluck egalitarianism so that it says that all those who try equally\nhard or are otherwise equally meritorious or virtuous—regardless\nof their native talent or talent potential—should have the same\nprospects of gaining especially advantageous or better than average\noutcomes, while leaving it entirely open what should be the spread\nbetween the best and worse outcomes available in the society.  This\nversion of luck egalitarianism would be a more demanding version of\nsubstantive equality of opportunity than FEO. In contrast, luck egalitarianism as\ncharacterized here specifies that people's condition should be equal\nunless those who get the short end of the stick are appropriately held\nresponsible for their condition. In addition to taking equality to be\nthe moral default position, a fully elaborated luck egalitarian\ndoctrine would specify the factors that determine, when inequality is\nwarranted, what degree of inequality is warranted. For example, the\nview might be that when inequalities are voluntarily courted or chosen\nvia fair interaction, whatever spread between worse off and better off\ndevelops is acceptable. A different elaboration would hold that when\npeople are unequally well off, each person's level of advantages\nenjoyed ought to be in proportion to her degree of deservingness as\nfixed by some standard of desert. Luck egalitarian equal opportunity theorists start by\ndistinguishing unchosen circumstances and individual choices. The\nformer are matters imposed on an individual in ways that she could not\nhave influenced or controlled; these matters are just given. It makes\nno sense to hold the individual responsible for anything that falls in\nthe category of circumstances. Prominent circumstances include the\nsocialization and early environment provided by one's parents or other\nguardians, one's genetic makeup, and the features of the world in\nwhich one finds oneself prior to any opportunity for responsible\nchoice. People face very unequal circumstances, but this inequality,\ndue to unchosen good or bad luck, should be eliminated: People's\ninitial circumstances should be made equal. But once individuals make\nchoices to lead their lives in one or another way starting from\ninitial equality, justice does not demand further compensation if\nrisks taken happen to turn out badly and in fact justice demands that\nfurther compensation should not occur. At least this is so if people\nare making choices under conditions of interaction that are fair and\nno sheer good or bad luck beyond anyone's power to foresee or control\nintervenes. “Fair conditions for interaction” may be taken\nto be an environment in which individuals are free to make deals on\nmutually agreeable terms and contracts are enforced, individuals are\nprohibited from deliberately harming each other by physical assault,\nextortion, coercion, fraud, theft of property and the like. Also,\nindividuals are either prevented from imposing the costs of their\nactivities on others who do not consent to be so involved or they are\nrequired to pay appropriate compensation for harm done that is\ntortious in this way.  Fair conditions of interaction also include an\ninitial equality of circumstances. Different luck egalitarian equality\nof opportunity theorists propose different conceptions of how to draw\nthe line between circumstances to be equalized and choices for which\nindividuals themselves are properly held responsible. They also\npropose different conceptions of how to assess circumstances for\npurposes of distributive justice and how to measure them so that one\ncan determine when one individual's circumstances overall are equal or\nunequal to another's. The most prominent and explicit luck egalitarian conception of\ndistributive justice is that advanced by Ronald Dworkin in two essays\npublished in 1981 (reprinted along with other essays in Dworkin 2000;\nsee also Arneson 1989; Cohen 1989; Nagel 1991; Temkin 1993; and Sen\n1992). Dworkin distinguishes brute luck that simple befalls an\nindividual and option luck, which is   a matter of\nhow deliberate and calculated gambles turn out—whether someone\ngains or loses through accepting an isolated risk he or she should\nhave anticipated and might have declined. (Dworkin 2000: 73)\n  According to Dworkin, egalitarian justice\nrequires correcting for brute luck inequalities but letting stand\ninequalities arising from option luck. But Dworkin's views in this\nconnection are intricate; he has himself repudiated the label\n“luck egalitarian” as suggesting an inaccurate\ninterpretation of his social justice views.  For further discussion of these conceptions of distributive\njustice, see the entries on affirmative action, egalitarianism,\nequality, and distributive justice in this Encyclopedia. Two lines of thought converge to support a conception of\ndistributive justice that may be regarded as luck egalitarian.  One\nresponds to conservative and libertarian critics of social justice\ndoctrines that demand that everyone's condition be equal in some\nway. Another suggests that the ethical view underlying formal equality\nor careers open to talents drives one to accept a presumption in favor\nof equality of condition provided that those holding the short end of\nthe stick have not made themselves responsible for this condition by\ntheir own conduct. A familiar conservative objection to the idea that justice demands\nthe maintenance of equality of condition across persons is that\nstarting from an equal position (or for that matter from any\ndistribution of advantages and disadvantages taken to be just),\nindividuals left free to choose will use their resources and\nopportunities in different ways, so that initial equality among free\npersons inevitably gives way to inequalities across persons.  Given\nequal money holdings, some will save and some will consume and some\nwill invest and produce, and soon people end up with very unequal\nmoney holdings. To sustain equality of condition one would have to do\none of two things: either restrict people's liberty by forbidding them\nto pursue their individual projects and plans in ways that lead to\ninequality, or continually redistribute resources from those with more\nto those with less, roughly from those who save and work (ants, in the\nfable) to those who consume and play (grasshoppers, in the same\nfable). Either of these policies would be morally unacceptable. So\npursuing sustained social equality is a fool's errand. The luck egalitarian responds that we should distinguish between\ninequalities for which people can and cannot reasonably be held\nresponsible. If people begin life with equal opportunities, against\nthe background of a fair framework for economic and personal\ninteraction and cooperation, and then use and abuse their\nopportunities in different ways, the resultant inequalities in their\ncondition do not call for redress. The egalitarian should uphold\nequality of opportunity not equality of outcome. A second line of thought also supports an equality of opportunity\nconception of distributive justice. This line of thought is\ndiscernible in chapter two of John Rawls's classic treatise on justice\n(Rawls 1999; see also Barry 1989: chapter 6). If we accept that people\nought to enjoy formal equality of opportunity or careers open to\ntalents, we should be concerned that morally arbitrary good and bad\nfortune can determine whether individuals have the opportunity to\ndevelop their potential talents and become qualified for positions\nthat confer special advantages and favorable life prospects. If we\naccept that this morally arbitrary good and bad fortune should not\ndetermine people's prospects, we are led to accept FEO. This\nsubstantive equal opportunity doctrine is satisfied when all those\nwith the same native talent and the same ambition have the same\nprospects of competitive success.  When FEO is satisfied, the luck beyond one's power to control of\nbeing born in a favorable or an unfavorable social environment does\nnot play any role in determining one's life prospects. The effects of\nunfavorable initial circumstances are entirely smoothed out by\nequalizing policies we institute. However, from the standpoint of\npreventing people's life prospects from being unduly influenced by\nmorally arbitrary factors entirely beyond their power to control,\nthere remains a residual unfairness even when FEO is completely\nsatisfied. In that circumstance, an individual's prospects for doing\nwell in public sphere interactions with others depend not just on her\nown ambition and effort but also on her native talent\nendowment—her genetic endowment considered as a potential for\ntalent development. But if anything just befalls a person and is\nbeyond her power to control, it is her native talent endowment. As\nRawls writes,   once we are troubled by the\ninfluence of either social contingencies or natural chance on the\ndetermination of distributive shares, we are bound, on reflection, to\nbe bothered by the influence of the other. (Rawls 1999:\n64) FEO demands that those with the same native talent and the same\nambition to exercise that talent toward competitive success should\nhave equal competitive prospects. The further assertion that the\nnatural lottery of talent potential is also morally arbitrary yields\nthe idea that those with the same ambition should have equal\nprospects. This idea needs interpretation. It can hardly be a\nplausible principle of justice that demands that social arrangements\nshould bring it about that slow runners have just the same chances of\nwinning foot races as fast runners with the same desire to win, or\nthat the medically incompetent and competent should have the same\nchances of becoming medical doctors and having successful careers in\nthat profession, and so on. The sensible thought here is that the\nbenefits that economic and social cooperation yield should go in equal\namounts to equally responsible and ambitious individuals regardless of\nthe social contingencies and natural chance factors that enable some\nto succeed more than others in competitive social life. This is\nroughly the luck egalitarian or level playing field conception of\nequality of opportunity, now proposed as the distributive justice\nstandard for assessing institutions and practices. Dworkin's contributions clarify and sharpen the idea of luck\negalitarianism just described and move the idea in a particular\ndirection. Suppose we ask, what fixes whether a distribution of\nbenefits or opportunities across people is equal? Dworkin urges that a\ndistribution is equal just in case people have equal resources to\npursue whatever aims and ambitions they might have. A distribution of\nmaterial resources across persons can be regarded as equal when no one\nwould prefer to have any one else's bundle. A hypothetical\nimplementation of this idea would involve imagining people assigned\nequal bidding resources and holding an auction to distribute the\nmaterial resources at hand, with the auction concluded only when no\none wishes to change her bid for any bit of the stuff being divided by\nauction.  Dworkin adds that the ideal of equality of resources should be\nconceived as operating over time, so that if Smith is assigned a\ncertain resource bundle including arable land and works the land so\nthat the resource bundle increases, one does not envy Smith's\naugmented bundle if one could have achieved the same augmentation with\nthe same work output but prefers not to sacrifice present consumption\nfor future profit in this way. Dworkin adds a further twist: he\naffirms that personal traits such as native charm and intelligence\npotential and physical strength should also be regarded as resources,\nso equality of resources demands compensation for shortfalls in\npersonal trait endowments. He suggests that the appropriate\ncompensation measure would consist of hypothetical insurance markets,\nin which individuals equally situated, knowing the disabilities they\nmight have and their incidence but not whether they themselves have\nthem or not, and knowing their personal traits but not what prices\ntheir use might fetch in market trading, have the opportunity to\npurchase insurance against the possibility of being afflicted with\ndisabilities or of having a trait endowment of low market value. This equality of resources ideal can be compared to an alternative\nequality of welfare approach that Dworkin rejects. Consider various\nexamples in which someone becomes worse off than others in some\nrespect and the question becomes whether level playing field justice\nrequires compensation to restore equality across people in that\nrespect. The measure used to assess people as better or worse off\ninteracts with notions of personal responsibility regarded as shaping\negalitarian requirements. Suppose one person subscribes to a religion\nthat requires expensive ritual displays by its adherents. In\nprinciple, the disadvantages in welfare that the religious adherent\nincurs would ground a claim for compensation from the standpoint of\nwelfarist egalitarian justice. If the believer has chosen his religion\nin such a way that he can reasonably be deemed responsible for this\nchoice, equal opportunity for welfare would not require equalizing\ncompensation, but if the believer cannot reasonably be regarded as\nresponsible for his religious commitment, equal opportunity for\nwelfare would demand equalizing compensation. For Dworkin, one cannot\ncoherently demand compensation for any aspect of one's aims and\ncommitments and tastes and ideals that one is glad to have. One cannot\nboth be happy to be motivated by an aim and also regard having that\naim as an affliction for which one should get compensation. This\nconstraint applies to religious commitment and also to expensive\ntaste. I cannot both be glad that I have a discerning taste in wine or\nopera performances and yet regard these expensive tastes as\nafflictions for which I should get equalizing compensation (Williams\n2002). In Dworkin's phrase, distribution should be ambition-insensitive but\nendowment-sensitive. You are not owed more from society by way of fair\nshares in virtue of the fact that your ambitions are large rather than\nsmall, demanding rather than undemanding, but you are owed more from\nsociety by way of fair shares in virtue of the fact that your initial\nresource holdings are scant or the fact that your native talent\nendowment is more meager than that of others. An objection lurks here. Dworkin distinguishes between my\ncircumstances, for which I am not reasonably held responsible, and my\nambitions, for which I am reasonably held responsible, and includes\nnative talent endowment among circumstances. But my native talent\nendowment may unfortunately leave me with poor value-forming and\nambition-forming and choice-making ability, so that shortfalls in my\ncondition that result from my acting on my ambitions may just express\na shortfall in my native talent endowment. So according to Dworkin I\nboth am and am not reasonably held responsible for my condition. The distinction between one's ambition and the rest of one's\ncircumstances as deployed by Dworkin draws a certain concern for\nindividual freedom and responsibility into the account of distributive\njustice. If we start from initial fair shares, and then you pursue\nfancy vegetable farming, risky but potentially lucrative, and I put my\nresources in a bank account, and you end up with a more intrinsically\nrewarding and lucrative work life than I manage to get, the\ndifferences in life outcomes at which we arrive are not inequalities\nthat register as unfair or as demanding equalizing compensation in\nDworkin's framework. Welfare or well-being inequalities across people\nare not a concern of social justice, in that framework. In Dworkin's later writings on distributive justice, hypothetical\ninsurance assumes a more prominent role than in his 1981\nessays. Dworkin had written that although the hypothetical ideal\nauction and insurance markets for talent and handicap cannot be\nimplemented, we ought to set in place institutional arrangements that\nwill mimic as closely as possible the results we calculate these ideal\nmechanisms would deliver. Later, a somewhat different thought becomes\ncentral. This is the idea that what we owe to one another by way of\nhealth care policy, unemployment compensation, other welfare state\narrangements, and inheritance tax and transfer schemes is set by what\nlevel of insurance coverage in each of these policy domains the\naverage member of the community would take under full knowledge of\nactual and expected circumstances modified by a veil of ignorance\nadjusted to be fair for each particular policy domain. To yield just\noutcomes, these imaginary insurance decisions should be made against\nthe backdrop of a fair framework for interaction including a free\nmarket economy based on private ownership of resources with\nappropriate contract law and tort law and regulation of\nexternalities. To appreciate the flavor of these proposals, notice\nthat the level of health care coverage the average member of the\ncommunity would purchase under the hypothetical conditions would vary\ndepending on what afflictions one might suffer, what medical care can\ndo to prevent or alleviate such conditions with expected available\nmedical technology, and what else one might do, and with what personal\nbenefit, with the money one is imagining having available to spend on\none's health insurance. The hunch that lies behind Dworkin's idea of\njustice as fair insurance is that the various factors that would\naffect the hypothetical insurance choices people would make are\nfactors relevant to the determination of what we owe one another by\nway of fair shares and that the hypothetical insurance construction\naccurately registers the determining weight they should have. Whatever the merits of Dworkin's ideal of distributive justice as\nfair insurance, it looks to be rejecting the idea of justice as luck\negalitarianism. Whereas the luck egalitarian holds that chosen and\ncourted inequalities do not qualify for compensation to restore\ninitial equality, Dworkin's hypothetical insurance schemes would allow\ncompensation for health woes triggered by voluntary behavior and\nunemployment compensation for the person who loses her job through her\nfaulty conduct (but for a contrary interpretation, see Ripstein 2007:\n100). Whether compensation ought to be carried out depends on what the\naverage member of the community would purchase under the imaginary\nconditions deemed to be fair. Moreover, whether compensation is owed\nto a particular individual does not depend on the particular values,\ndesires, risk preferences, aims and ambitions, and so on of the\nparticular individual, rather on what the average member of the\ncommunity would choose. The key divide for distributive justice is no\nlonger, in Dworkin's mature view, the divide between what lies within\nthe individual's power to control and what does not. Depending on how\none evaluates Dworkin's later views, one might regard the divergence\nbetween later Dworkin and luck egalitarian or level-playing-field\nequality of opportunity as either a criticism of the former or of the\nlatter (for criticisms of Dworkin's views from opposed perspectives,\nsee Anderson 1999; Scheffler 2003; Cohen 2004; and Fleurbaey 2008:\nchapters 6–10). The Dworkinian ideal of justice as fair insurance both incorporates\na particular notion of personal responsibility into distributive\njustice and displaces the identification of justice and equal\nopportunity. Provided society brings it about that you get the fair\ninsurance payout, and maintains a fair framework of interaction, how\nyou fare is your responsibility in the sense that others are under no\nobligation to eliminate shortfalls in advantage that might come about\nas the result of your own choices. The initial opportunities for\nindividuals that justice guarantees need not be equal across\nindividuals, because what anyone is owed is set by the insurance\ndecisions the average member of the community would make.  Bringing\nabout equal resources broadly understood among able and disabled\nindividuals would be incredibly costly, so choosing insurance in\nignorance of one's actual disability status, one would not choose a\ncoverage that would yield initial equality across able and disabled,\nDworkin supposes. Justice as fair insurance supposes that an ex ante\nperspective determines what we owe one another; fair shares are set by\nsimulated choices made in ignorance of what disabilities any one\nactually has and in ignorance of what payoffs one's risky choices will\nbring about. Some reject this ex ante perspective. If money\nwill be of more use to people in the event that they are able than it\nwill be in the event that they are disabled, people in the\nhypothetical insurance market might tend to choose insurance that pays\nout if they turn out to be able and requires them to pay in if they\nturn out to be disabled—but then distributive justice would\nrequire transfers from worse off people to better off people on the\nbasis not of any actual choices they make but on the basis of their\npresumed hypothetical choices—some find this a perverse result\n(on Dworkin and insurance, see Roemer 2002 and Fleurbaey 2008). If we assume that the parties involved in hypothetical insurance\nchoice know that in the aftermath of their choice they will live in a\nmarket economy with private ownership and that the insurance against\nmisfortune they are selecting will be implemented by general taxation\nof income and wealth and some form of redistribution, they will regard\nthemselves as in effect gambling on their prospects. If they turn out\nto be winners in the market economy they will do better with a low tax\nrate for redistributive purposes, and if they are losers in the market\neconomy they will do better with a higher tax rate and more\nredistribution. It is not clear why their preferences over this risk\nshould fix what count as fair shares in the theory of distributive\njustice. Stipulating with Dworkin that the preferences of the average\nmember of the community should be the determining preferences in this\nexercise does not clarify the issue. Let us set aside Dworkin's intricate revisionism and return to the\nbasic luck egalitarian project. To reiterate, the basic idea is that\njustice establishes a moral presumption in favor of equality in the\nadvantages people have (in different versions of the view the idea of\n“advantage” is variously interpreted). The presumption is\noverturned when people have the opportunity to be as well off as\nothers but make choices or behave in ways that (a) render them worse\noff than others and (b) make it the case that compensating them or\nameliorating their condition to restore equality of condition between\nthem and others is morally inappropriate or at least not a high\npriority moral desideratum. The b condition admits of two broadly\ndifferent construals. One is that when an individual behaves in a way\nthat renders him worse off than others, if some reasonable choice he\nmight have made or reasonable behavior he might have performed would\nhave lessened the probability that he would end up worse off, then\nthere is less egalitarian reason to eliminate this shortfall in his\nadvantage level. Another is that when an individual's faulty or\nundeserving choice or behavior renders him worse off than others,\nthere is no, or less, egalitarian reason to eliminate this shortfall\nin his advantage level. The difference between these construals\nbecomes evident if we imagine a person performing an heroic rescue,\nwhen she might reasonably and without blame have held back from\nrescue, and suffers misfortune as a result (Eyal 2007 and Temkin\n2011). The basic idea might be stated in the language of personal\nresponsibility. If some are worse off than others, under what\nconditions are those who are worse off appropriately held responsible\nfor their unequal condition in the sense that no one has any moral\nobligation (or responsibility) to make good their shortfall? The luck\negalitarian answer is that if your coming to be in a bad state\ncompared to others lay within your power to control, you bear\nresponsibility for your being in that state. The condition you are in\nis properly attributable to you. We then need an account of what\nrenders individuals responsible in these ways. If hard determinism is\ntrue, no one is ever responsible in the requisite way, and the luck\negalitarian equality of opportunity conception of distributive justice\ndictates equality of condition across persons. On other conceptions,\npeople can be responsible for their varying fortunes, when the right\nbackground is in place, and when this is so, equal opportunity can\ncoexist with inequality of outcome.\n  In other words, we should level the playing field on which\ncompetition for superior positions in the social hierarchy will\neventually take place. The playing field is leveled when unchosen\ncircumstances of individuals are equalized, so that individuals can\nreasonably be held responsible for their choices that determine their\neventual places in the social hierarchy. One might picture\nlevel-playing-field (LPF) equality of opportunity as operating in the\nsphere of education and socialization and health care to prepare young\npeople for adult status when responsible agency in a field of social\ncompetitions will be expressed. Opportunities are equalized when\nunchosen circumstances including native talents are counterbalanced so\nthat nothing but the quality of people's choices (to the degree they\ncan reasonably be held responsible for them) and their foreseeable\neffects determines their fate in social competitions. The effects of\nunchosen luck are to be eliminated. Consider educational policy from the standpoint of the LPF\nconception of equal opportunity. The aim of educational policy in this\nperspective would be to bring it about that individuals have equal\nopportunity for labor market and entrepreneurial success. If some\nindividuals enter school with greater potential for market success due\nto favorable genetic makeup and early childhood socialization, then\nextra educational resources should be expended on the unlucky so that\nso far as is possible, when all individuals leave school, all who\nexhibit equal ambition and perseverance in working toward chosen goals\nwill have the same prospects of lifetime economic success. Or perhaps\nwe had better say that educational resources are deployed so that\nanyone who works as hard as can reasonably be expected in school will\nleave school with the benchmark equal prospect of market success. One could consider health care policy from the same\nperspective. The object of the LPF equal opportunity advocate would be\nto design a health care policy that compensates individuals for bad\nluck in unchosen health care circumstances, offsetting adverse\nunchosen health conditions so that lifetime health prospects for all\nwho behave equally responsibly are the same. (Segall 2009). One difficulty this approach faces is to clarify the basis for\nholding people responsible for their choices and the extent to which\npeople will be held responsible for the effects of their choices that\nfall on themselves. John Roemer has developed a framework for\naddressing this difficulty. His idea is one that societies with\ndifferent notions of how much responsibility for choice to assign to\nindividuals could use to determine what equal opportunity would\nrequire given their favored notion of individual responsibility\n(Roemer 2002 and 2003; for criticism, see Risse 2002 and Hurley\n2003). Roemer proposes that the population be divided into types on the\nbasis of characteristics for which society deems individuals not\nreasonably to be held responsible. One then examines the distribution\nof a good such as education or health care or labor market\nsuccess. For each such good, there is assumed to be a single measure\nof effort for which individuals are to be held responsible. This might\nbe years of persevering in school, for example. If there are many\nindividuals in each type, one takes the effort distribution for the\ntype as a feature of the type and hence something for which the\nindividual should not be held responsible. What the individual is\ndeemed accountable for is the amount of effort she puts forth by\ncomparison with the effort put forth by others of her type. The\nRoemerian equality of opportunity norm regards those who are at the\nsame centile of effort for their type to have exercised a comparable\ndegree of responsibility. Ideally society should equalize outcomes for\neach centile of every type, but in general this will not be possible,\nso one seeks a logically possible approximation to this ideal and\nidentifies this as equality of opportunity. Roemer offers his account\nas an ecumenical proposal that a society could employ whatever its own\ncollective opinion as to what characteristics of individuals should be\ndeemed to be effectively beyond their power to control and hence to\nidentify relevant types for purposes of defining the requirements of\nequality of opportunity. Since Roemer does not offer a full theory of justice within which\nhis LPF version of equality of opportunity would be included, one\ncannot say what sort of social hierarchy he envisions, fair access to\nwhich is to be regulated by this level playing field conception of\nequality of opportunity. (He might be espousing a radical version of\nsubstantive equality of opportunity or instead uphold the background\nidea that equality of condition should be sustained unless\nconsiderations of personal responsibility provide reasons to deviate\nfrom it.) But a difficulty he himself notes raises a worry about the\nattractiveness of the approach (Roemer 1998: chapter 12). If society\nneeds excellent basketball players, ballet dancers, bankers, medical\nresearchers, nuclear scientists, and so on, then society needs to\ntrain the best individuals for those social roles, and if the social\nroles are valuable, no doubt special advantages and rewards should be\nattached to them. To say that “society needs” such elite\neducation is to speculate that with elite education all members of\nsociety can be made better off than they would be if elite education\nis foregone. But this means that many social justice principles will\nimply that the LPF conception of equal opportunity should not be\npursued because giving special advantages to people on the basis of\nunchosen circumstances such as their native possession of specially\nvalued talents works to everyone's advantage including especially the\nadvantage of the worse off fraction of society. However, Roemer can\nreply that one can uphold LPF equal opportunity as part of justice\nwithout insisting it is the entirety of justice. Justice might favor\nequality of opportunity and also favor more and better opportunities\nfor people rather than fewer and worse.  According to Immanuel Kant's doctrine of right, the existence of a\nstate is required to establish a condition of equal freedom for\nall. In this condition each is free to use her person and property in\nways consistent with everyone else's similar freedom. In the absence\nof a functioning coercive state that specifies who is entitled to what\nproperty, no one has determinate rights; there is no clear\n“mine” and “thine”. The state enforces a set\nof rules binding on all that partly establishes and partly constitutes\na condition of equal freedom. People are morally obligated to\ncooperate with others to create a state if no effective legal order\nexists and to cooperate to sustain an existing state that rules them,\neven a very defective state. The rightful condition of freedom that a functioning state sustains\nis the freedom to act for any innocent purpose one chooses with one's\nbody and whatever means one owns, along with the right not to be\nforced to act to serve the purposes of other people or to suffer one's\nproperty being used to serve the purposes of others.  Everyone has the\nsame freedom, and others acting freely may bring it about that one's\nopportunity to achieve one's desires may be sharply curtailed. Other\npeople's legitimate exercise of their freedom does not lessen your\nfreedom in the relevant sense, even if their choices put you at a\ndisadvantage or preclude your attaining any particular level of\nwelfare or well-being. For example, others might purchase all the food\nat the store, leaving you with no opportunity to buy any. No matter,\nfrom the Kantian perspective. So long as you are not subject to the\nwill of others, forced to serve their purposes in the absence of your\nvoluntary agreement to do so, your equal freedom is neither reduced\nnor compromised. Equal freedom for all sets limits to your subjecting yourself to\nthe will of others: an agreement to become the slave or serf of\nanother is void. Becoming utterly impoverished, so that one must beg\nor subject oneself to the will of another to survive, is also\nincompatible with equal freedom for all; so the state must establish\nsome public policies to keep the poor from falling into a state of\nutter dependence on others. The equal freedom that the state establishes and sustains is a\nformal freedom. Being equally free along with all fellow members of\nsociety does not guarantee that I have the option to achieve the\npurposes they can achieve or indeed any particular set of purposes at\nall. Others having lots of property and me having very little is\ncompatible with all of us enjoying equal freedom and none being a\nmaster of any other, controlling the will of some other person.  Nor\ndoes your having many more valuable options and fruitful courses of\naction available to choose than I have constitute any deprivation of\nmy right to equal freedom. Nor does your having the good fortune to be\nborn with a large endowment of talent potential and no disabilities\nand born into a nurturing family possessing lots of means while I have\nbad fortune in these respects amount to any erosion of the condition\nof equal freedom that a rightful legal order yields for us. The equal formal freedom that the rightful state sustains according\nto the Kantian doctrine can be regarded as a species of formal equal\nopportunity. If the Kantian doctrine of right can be defended, then we\nhave good grounds to uphold a version of formal equal opportunity\nwithout being under normative pressure of good reasons to go further\nand embrace any substantive equal opportunity doctrine. In a nutshell,\nthe Kantian claim will be that embracing more expansive notions of\nequal opportunity, substantive equal opportunity or the yet more\nexpansive luck egalitarian family of doctrines, will prove\nincompatible with maintaining formal equal freedom for all and with\nsustaining the condition in which no adult person is the master of any\nother (if substantive equality is sustained, then some people are\nbeing forced to use their persons and forced to suffer their property\nbeing used for the private purposes of others—a fundamental\nviolation of right). This may be one of those argumentative standoffs\nin which, as Brian Barry once remarked, one man's reductio ad\nabsurdum is another's Quod Erat Demonstrandum. (For\nKant's views on equal freedom and the doctrine of right, see Guyer\n2000 and Ripstein 2009). For more on Kantian moral and political\nphilosophy, see other entries in this Encyclopedia.  As characterized here, formal and substantive equality of\nopportunity ideals regulate the procedures by which individuals come\nto acquire especially advantageous positions. The scope of equality of\nopportunity is broader, the wider the range of worthy capacities and\nabilities that are fostered and rewarded in the society that satisfies\nthese equal opportunity ideals. Neither of these principles attempts to address the issue, what\nextent of inequality across the individuals in society and across the\nsocial positions that social arrangements establish or engender is\nmorally acceptable. Equality of opportunity would have no application\nif all social positions were equally advantageous and desirable. But\nequality of opportunity does not say whether the gap between the top\nrung of society and the bottom rung should be large or small. Equality\nof opportunity principles assert that if there is to be inequality in\nthe rewards and remuneration and status dispensed by social\narrangements, all members of society should have equal opportunity\nsuitably defined to gain the superior positions. (To reiterate, just\nin this respect luck egalitarianism takes a different stance.) The term “meritocracy” is sometimes used to refer to a\nsociety that fulfills formal and substantive equality of opportunity\nnorms. It should be noted that the term sometimes names a broader\nideal. A meritocracy in this broader sense is a society in which (a)\nequality of opportunity obtains and (b) rewards and remuneration\ngained by individuals are proportional to their individual desert. The\ndifference between narrow and broad meritocratic norms is that the\nlatter assert a standard for assessing social arrangements in so far\nas they attach rewards and remunerations to positions and fix the\nextent of social inequality. These arrangements should give\nindividuals what they deserve, and what they deserve is at least\npartly fixed independently of existing social arrangements and so can\nserve as a standard for criticizing them (see Daniels 1978; Sher 1987;\nScheffler 1992, 2000; and Miller 1999: chapters 7–9). According to the broad meritocracy ideal, a justification for\nequality of opportunity is that its fulfillment is necessary if it is\nto be the case that individuals genuinely get what they deserve. If\nequality of opportunity is violated, then either the less qualified\nare selected over the more qualified or not all individuals have equal\nchance to become qualified. Equality of opportunity is then either a\nmeans to meritocracy or partly constitutive of it. It should be noted that broad meritocracy might be upheld either as\na complete view of social justice or as one justice value to be\nbalanced against others. Theories of desert are various. Principles of desert can be\ncomparative or noncomparative. A comparative desert principle\nspecifies what makes people more or less deserving relative to one\nanother. A noncomparative desert principle associates a proper amount\nof recognition, remuneration, or reward with an individual's\nparticular level of deservingness. For example, the claim that medical\ndoctors and business executives are paid too much compared to what\nmanual workers get is a claim of comparative desert. The assertions\nthat no one deserves to starve and that those guilty of perpetrating\ntorture-murder deserve the death penalty are claims of noncomparative\ndesert. An individual is rightly regarded as deserving only on the\nbasis of some personal characteristic such as her traits or doings (on\nvarieties of desert principles, see Hurka 2003, and for a systematic\nexploration of desert, see Kagan 2012). Some hold that what makes any person fundamentally deserving of\ngood or bad fortune is her level of virtue or moral merit. Other\ntheorists hold that there are plural bases of desert that in different\nsettings establish what people deserve and what treatment society\nshould accord them (Sher 1987). On this view, desert comes in\ndifferent flavors. For example, deserving athletes should be cheered,\ndeserving poets should be appreciated for their insight and aesthetic\nmerit. This view provides a critical standard. If a society jeers at\nits good athletes and poets, it is deficient, and its practices should\nbe reformed so that the deserving are rewarded in due proportion. If economic desert or merit is regarded as measurable and the\ndesert theorist holds that in a just political economy, individuals\nare remunerated and rewarded in proportion to their level of desert,\njustice as deservingness becomes a candidate theory of justice. In\nprinciple, the view fixes what inequalities in people's conditions of\nlife are morally acceptable. Whereas the libertarian holds that social\njustice is achieved when Lockean rights are respected, and the\nRawlsian holds that justice in general requires that society be\narranged to maximize the primary social goods holdings of the least\nadvantaged, the desert theorist asserts that justice is\nmeritocracy. In a meritocracy, each individual has good fortune in\nproportion to her deservingness (Rawls 1999; Nozick 1974; Miller\n1999). The idea that individuals become economically deserving in so far\nas they are economically productive (as measured by what people are\nwilling to pay for their goods and services) comes under pressure from\ntwo directions. On the one side, a well-functioning competitive market\nis responsive to supply and demand. The ensemble of circumstances that\ndetermine supply and demand and hence what remuneration anyone gets\nfor her market activity varies capriciously in ways that confront\neconomic agents as sheer luck. For example, what equally hard-working\nand skilled auto workers will earn in Germany and China is affected\nenormously by different economic conditions in the two countries,\nincluding actions by other agents, their level of wealth, and so\non. There is no remotely sensible notion of individual desert that\nvaries with the benefits that people gain from their economic\nproduction. This is not any defect of markets; there is no reason to\nexpect them to somehow distribute benefits according to any\ncommon-sense norms of desert.  So if it was thought morally imperative that the ordinary operation\nof a market economy should proportion rewards to desert, we would have\nto entirely redesign and remake economic institutions with this end in\nview. But if one asks, why markets should be reformed so they reward\nthe deserving, the notion of desert in play here looks under scrutiny\nto be too insubstantial to justify the demanded changes. The thought\nthat people deserve in proportion to their meritorious doings runs up\nagainst the fact that all such accomplishments depend to an\nindeterminate extent on native talent and favorable early\nsocialization, sources of meritorious agency that are entirely beyond\nthe individual's power to control. This is not to say there is nothing\nin one's conscientious strivings for which one can take credit, but\nwhat one can take credit for is so intermingled with what simply falls\non one's plate as good or bad luck that the idea of rewarding desert\nin any fine-grained way is impractical. The idea that people become\neconomically deserving by being economically productive and should be\nremunerated according to their productivity is at odds with the\neffective functioning of actual markets. To try to revamp the economy\nso it rewards the truly deserving would be a fool's errand. (Rawls\n1999: sections 47 and 48; but see Miller 1999: chapters\n7–9). The ideal of a society in which people do not suffer disadvantage\nfrom discrimination on grounds of supposed race, ethnicity, religion,\nsex, sexual orientation is widely upheld as desirable in itself. For\nmany, the ideal is more compelling than any argument that might be\noffered to support it. However, what is objectionable is wrongful discrimination.\nDistinguishing wrongful from innocent discrimination is tricky\n(Alexander 1992). Statistical discrimination is not per se\nwrong. A black man may correctly perceive black skin to be roughly\ncorrelated with traits such as common experiences and outlook that he\nvalues in friends, and prefer blacks as friends on this basis. This is\nsurely not morally wrong. Nor would it be wrong to desire on the same\nbasis to be employed in a firm that employs mainly blacks. It might\nwell be the case, however, that acting on such a desire in concert\nwith others might have significant negative consequences for\nothers. Heterosexuals flocking together in the workplace might tend\nsharply to limit employment opportunities available to\nnonheterosexuals. On grounds of equal opportunity, then, law and\nsocial custom might be framed to restrict or prohibit acting on the\ndesire to club together with others whom one identifies as like\noneself in certain salient ways, even though this sort of\ndiscrimination is not deemed per se wrong. Formal and substantive equality of opportunity ideals require more\nthan avoidance of discrimination. These broader ideals might be\nregarded as morally valuable per se and unconditionally. They\nmight also be justified on instrumental grounds. For example, when\nwomen are excluded from the labor force, markets function less\nefficiently, and the ensemble of people's desires can in many settings\nbe satisfied more fully if equal opportunity for men and women is\nsecured. Since formal and substantive equality of opportunity norms are\nproposed as components of a moral theory of justified social\ninequality, the full justification of any candidate conception of\nequality of opportunity must be sought by way of examining the\njustification of the full theory of justice in which the candidate\nconception is to play a part. In much the same way, one examines a\ncomponent of a car, a candidate design for a carburetor for instance,\nby seeing how the component would function in the car and how well the\ncar with that component in place would perform. A conception of equality of opportunity, deemed to be morally\nvaluable per se, might be deemed so either as a deontological\nrequirement or as a valuable state of affairs to be promoted. A\ndeontological requirement specifies ways in which each agent should\nalways treat other people. An absolute deontological requirement\ndemands to be obeyed come what may, a less than absolute requirement\nmay be overridden if conformity to it produces an excessively bad\noutcome or conflicts with other deontological requirements that taken\ntogether have greater moral weight. Rawls himself says surprisingly little by way of justification of\nfair equality of opportunity. In his theory of justice, justice\nconcerns are nested in strict lexical priority relations. First\npriority is assigned to a principle that demands equal basic liberties\nsuch as freedom of speech for all. Second priority goes to fair\nequality of opportunity, which is interpreted as a prerequisite for\njustified inequalities in the distribution of social primary goods,\nbasic resources suitable for advancing a wide range of plans of\nlife. Inequalities in people's holdings of primary social goods must\n(a) be attached to positions and offices open to all according to fair\nequality of opportunity and (b) must work to the maximal advantage of\nthe least advantaged social group. In Rawls's system, (a) takes strict\nlexical priority over (b).  In broad terms, Rawls insists that fair\nequality of opportunity rules out improving the condition of the worst\noff by instituting practices that generate inequalities that fail to\nsatisfy FEO. One argument in support of the Rawlsian priority for FEO assumes\nthat FEO regulates opportunities for self-realization whereas the\nprinciple that demands maximization of the social primary goods\nholdings of the worst off regulates consumption activities. If we add\nthat self-realization should take strict lexical priority over mere\nconsumption activities in anyone's reasonable plan of life, we get an\nargument for the priority of FEO (Taylor 2004). Another argument\nstarts from the observation that Rawls says nothing about why FEO\nshould get less priority than the principle that protects basic\nliberties. This suggests a strategy for defending FEO: find arguments\nthat support the priority of the basic liberties, and explore to what\nextent they also support giving priority to FEO as well (Shiffrin\n2004). Following this strategy of argument, some have proposed that\nFEO protects the opportunity to contribute to social cooperation by\nengaging in challenging, meaningful work, and having this opportunity\nhelps one to fulfill one's basic moral interest in developing and\nexercising a sense of justice. Not by self-interest alone does man\nlive. Another consideration is that self-respect is of utmost\nimportance for any individual, so one should give priority to\nsustaining the social bases of self-respect, and a society that\nstrictly protects basic liberties and FEO sustains the social bases of\nself-respect. In reply: the arguments that purport to defend the priority of FEO\nlook vulnerable. Many goods, including free time apart from paid work\nand income, are useful for self-realization, so the assumed priority\nof self-realization does not support priority for FEO.  If\ninequalities in people's distributive shares work to advance the\ninterests of the worse off, there is good reason to accept them even\nif they violate FEO. Anyway consumption activities, even if generally\nless valuable than self-realization, have some value, so a lot of\nconsumption gains may outweigh a small bit of self-realization gains,\ncontrary to the claim of lexical priority for FEO. If meaningful work\nis a great good, crucial for human fulfillment, that consideration\narguably supports the justice requirement that all people have genuine\nopportunities to participate in meaningful work, not merely the right\nto equal chances for meaningful work for all with equal native talent\nand ambition that FEO entails. A complication here is that Rawls does not anyway insist on FEO\ncome what may, even though the heavens should fall. We should probably\nfollow Rawls on this point. An insistence on equality in Rawls is\nreally a insistence on a presumption of equality. He proposes equal\nbasic liberties for all, but allows that some restrictions of basic\nliberties might be needed to strengthen the system of basic liberties\nover time, and such restriction, even unequal restriction, is\nacceptable provided the lesser liberty is acceptable from the\nstandpoint of those who suffer the basic liberty deficit. In a similar\nway he proposes that social and economic inequalities are acceptable\nonly if attached to positions that are open to all under FEO, but\nallows that inequalities of opportunity ruled out by FEO can yet be\nacceptable provided they “enhance the opportunities of those\nwith lesser opportunity” (Rawls 1999: 266). The idea seems to be that allowing some socially advantaged persons\nto have greater chances of competitive success than equally natively\nendowed socially disadvantaged persons is unacceptable if the talented\nsocially disadvantaged are compensated just in terms of income and\nwealth. FEO is a constraint on allowable inequality. But suppose the\nprospects for competitive success, and so access to desirable\npositions and offices offering meaningful work, can be made unequal in\nsuch a way that those with the short end of the stick have more such\nopportunities than they would have if it were demanded that FEO must\nbe upheld even in this case. Here insistence on FEO might seem to be\nbiting off one's nose to spite one's face. Here Rawls says deviation\nfrom FEO is morally acceptable. Example: if we allow socially\nprivileged entrepreneurs access to competitive success in violation of\nFEO, they do things that stimulate employment growth, and those denied\nequal competitive opportunity end up with better competitive\nopportunity. Why not? This proposal raises several questions. One is whether an important\nmoral line can be drawn between denial of equal opportunity that\nmerely yields higher income and wealth and denial of equal opportunity\nthat yields better job opportunities for those denied the condition of\nFEO. After all, noble projects have material prerequisites, and the\nextra income I might get if unequal opportunity is permitted might be\ncrucial to my life fulfillment. Another worry is that the elaborate\nset of rules seems to give undue weight to the interests of those who\nare natively talented but socially disadvantaged as opposed to those\nwho are both socially and native-talent-wise disadvantaged. Suppose I\nam one of the latter truly disadvantaged types, and the contemplated\nrelaxation of FEO affects the competitive success prospects only of\nbetter-off individuals and promises mere income and wealth benefits to\npeople like me. Whether the relaxation of FEO is justifiable then\nhinges on what it does for the competitive success opportunities of\nthe better off people and not at all on the impending benefits to\nworse-off types. These questions are not posed as conversation stoppers. The\njustifiability of FEO seems to be a wide open question, yet to be\nanswered. Rawls's reticence does not show there is nothing cogent to\nbe said in defense of FEO or another norm in the wider family of\nsubstantive equality of opportunity norms. Sometimes it is said that\ninsistence on FEO preserves the status of all members of society as\nfree and equal persons, but this claim seems to presuppose that\ndropping or downgrading FEO would be unjustified. If dropping or\ndowngrading would be justified, free and equal persons could accept\nthis without forfeiting their status.  According to the Lockean libertarian, justice is done when each\nperson respects every other person's Lockean rights (see Nozick 1974). One's\nLockean rights roughly amount to the right to do whatever one chooses\nwith whatever one legitimately owns so long as one does not thereby\nharm others in certain ways that either violate or infringe their\nrights. The “certain ways” of harming are specified by a\nlist: no theft, fraud, breach of contract, extortion, coercion or\nforcing, assault, infliction of physical damage on persons or their\nproperty. Violations of rights are forbidden infringements.  One must\nnot violate anyone's rights, come what may.  Infringements of rights\ninclude violations and mere infringements. The latter may permissibly\nbe done provided compensation is paid to any victim who suffers harm\nas a result of having one's rights infringed. Each adult person is the\nfull rightful owner of herself, unless she has forfeited this right of\ndominion by grave misconduct or signed it away by exchange or free\ngift or waiver. The Lockean libertarian holds that a self-owning\nperson may appropriate unowned land and moveable parts of the earth\nand thereby become their full rightful owner; these rights may then be\ntransferred to others by gift or exchange or forfeited under certain\ncircumstances. The bearing of these claims on the moral validity of equal\nopportunity norms is supposed to arise from the consideration that if\none legitimately owns property, one is not morally bound to use it in\nways that satisfy equality of opportunity. If one owns a factory, one\nmay let it sit unused and allow no one to trespass on the premises, or\none may invite anyone one chooses to enter the premises and work in\nthe factory one owns on any mutually agreeable terms. One's Lockean\nrights fill the moral space that conceptions of equal opportunity are\nthought to occupy and as it were leave no room for them. Just as one\nmay choose to become friends with anyone on any mutually agreeable\nterms, rather than offer one's friendship to all who might wish it and\nto choose among applicants according to the merits of the\napplications, one may do the same with any property one owns.  Lockean\nproperty rights preclude its being the case that anyone is morally\nentitled to be treated according to equality of opportunity norms or\nthat anyone is morally obligated to treat anyone according to such\nnorms (unless one has signed a contract or promised to do so). The Lockean critique or rather counter-assertion of libertarian\nrights in the face of contrary claims that people have rights to equal\nopportunity applies to formal as well as to substantive equal\nopportunity ideals. According to the Lockean libertarian, a white male\nlandowner who wishes to hire laborers to work his fields may refuse to\nhire people of any religion, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, or\nthe like that he chooses to regard as a bar to employability. Or he\ncan decide to hire blacks and women and Hindus only for low-skill jobs\nand whites and men and Christians exclusively for skilled and\nmanagerial jobs. These decisions might be subject to appropriate moral\ncriticism.  What one has a moral right to do may nonetheless be\nmorally wrong. The claim that one has a moral right to do X\nimplies that others should not coercively interfere with one's doing\nX or violate any of one's rights to prevent one from doing\nX. The libertarian denies that anyone has a moral right in this\nsense to be treated in accordance with equal opportunity norms. This\nstricture applies to formal equality of opportunity and a\nfortiori to substantive equal opportunity and\nlevel-the-playing-field conceptions as well. The Lockean libertarian can also be viewed as proposing a\nminimalist conception of equal opportunity that should supersede the\nmore expansive notions of equal opportunity. The libertarian view is\nthat people's opportunities are equal in the relevant sense when each\nperson equally faces other possible interaction partners in a regime\nin which everyone's Lockean rights are respected. This requires that\nno state or government prohibit persons from transacting with others\non any mutually agreeable terms (that do not impose harms of certain\nsorts on nonconsenting others). Laws that coercively enforce Jim Crow\nracial exclusion (no blacks are legally permitted to work at skilled\njobs or enter learned professions or form certain sorts of\nentrepreneurial business partnerships and so on) would violate\nlibertarian equal opportunity so conceived. The Lockean libertarian proposes that everyone's Lockean rights\nshould be respected by everyone as inherently just and fair.\nRespecting Lockean rights is deemed morally valuable for its own sake,\nnot merely for the sake of good consequences it might bring about. One can also regard Lockean rights as instruments, morally valuable\nnot in themselves but for the consequences compliance with them brings\nabout. On this approach, to the extent that rigid adherence by\nindividuals or the government to Lockean rights would not produce the\nbest consequences, adherence should be selectively abandoned. Richard Epstein recommends something rather close to a regime of\nLockean libertarian rights on the ground that compliance with this\nregime of rights is utility maximizing (increases aggregate well-being\nof persons) over the long run (Epstein 1995: chapter 1). Epstein\nhimself is doubtful of interpersonal utility comparison, so he tends\nto favor policy moves that are Pareto improvements, improving\nsomeone's utility while reducing no one's. Still, one might\ncountenance interpersonal comparison and try to defend Lockean\nlibertarian rights on aggregative utility-maximizing grounds. The\nEpstein regime of rights is only a rough approximation of a strict\nLockean libertarian regime, for the former approves utility-promoting\ncurtailment of individual rights. For example, in an Epstein but not a\nstrict Lockean regime, a hiker caught in a blizzard in the mountains\nwho stumbles upon a privately owned cabin may trespass and use the\ncabin without prior permission of the owner provided compensation is\npaid for any damage done to the cabin and its provisions. But Epstein\nholds that enforcement of nondiscrimination norms and equality of\nopportunity would tend to lessen not promote people's long-run\nutility. As this formulation suggests, Epstein is concerned with the\nquestion, what rules and norms should be enforced by force of law. As\nagainst the simple rule that permits all and only deals that elicit\nthe voluntary consent of the participants, the rule forbidding\ndiscrimination is costly to administer and enforce, charges of\ndiscrimination being easy to make and difficult to prove. According to\nEpstein, competitive markets pressure people to do what is\ncost-effective, which generally means hiring the most qualified\napplicant and selling to any willing customer who is able to pay. The conjecture here is that over time competitive markets tend in a\nrough and ready way to come close enough to satisfying formal equality\nof opportunity. One might also postulate a tendency in competitive\nmarkets to move closer over time to satisfaction of FEO, but this\ntendency would be offset by, for example, the extra benefits of\ninteracting with socially well connected people as opposed to equally\nnatively talented people who lack lucrative social\nconnections. Moreover, training a talented socially disadvantaged\nperson so she becomes productive generates wide positive\nexternalities, and one does not expect a competitive market\nautomatically to deliver these in optimal qualities. Epstein is\ndoubtful that ham-fisted government regulation can (except in rare\ncases) in practice improve on the mix of benefits and losses a\ncompetitive market economy tends to deliver. In short, according to\nEpstein, by facilitating mutually profitable interactions among\nstrangers, the competitive market promotes a cultural atmosphere of\ntolerance and prosperity more effectively than governmental regulation\nwould do. One might object to the substantive and level playing field\nconceptions of equality of opportunity canvassed so far in this entry\non the ground that they all presuppose a world of individuals of given\ngenetic makeup. Given a population of individuals each with a\nparticular genetic makeup that fixes for that individual a profile of\nnative talent, the question for the equal opportunity theorist is what\nmust be done to or for such individuals if they are to be rightly\nregarded as enjoying equal opportunity. This framework of discussion\ntakes for granted that native talent differentials are an unalterable\nnatural fact. The objection is that what this framework presupposes\nmay not be so or may eventually not be so. Advances in biological\nknowledge suggest that at some time in the future people can by\ndeliberate choice alter the genetic makeup of their children or the\nchildren born in their society in order to eliminate unwanted traits\nand augment desired traits. The genetic influences on human traits\nwill become subject to human control. This might occur by using\ngenetic knowledge either to alter the genetic constitution of\nindividuals yet to be born or to provide therapeutic interventions on\nalready existing individuals to alter their genetic makeup. Along this\nline some argue that advances in genetic knowledge unsettle current\nmoral conceptions including conceptions of equal opportunity by\nfalsifying their factual presuppositions (Buchanan et al. 2000:\nchapters 3 and 7). Of course affecting the genetic makeup of children by deliberate\nchoice is not new. Assortative mating done with the hope that by\nselection of a mate with desirable traits one will affect the\nlikelihood that one's children will have similar desirable traits is a\nmeans of influencing the genetic makeup of individuals that does not\nrequire advanced genetic knowledge. What is new is the possible scope\nfor deliberate choice in the world of advanced genetic knowledge that\nis just now being glimpsed. At least, a question becomes more salient as genetic knowledge\nincreases: What does fairness require by way of care and due regard in\nthe design of individuals? What kinds of persons should be brought\ninto existence? Call the answers justice in conception. \nAlthough this question is of undoubted importance, it does not in any\nobvious way render equality of opportunity in its various guises a\nconsideration of no importance. In the future world with greater\ngenetic knowledge and techniques of control of human reproduction, a\npopulation of individuals will emerge, whether in ways that conform to\njustice in conception or in ways that offend it. Either way, the\ninstitutions and practices into which this population is born might\nbring about a caste hierarchy or a different sort of hierarchy that\nsatisfies equality of opportunity norms. Nothing said so far suggests\nthe difference between caste hierarchy and the society that eliminates\ncaste hierarchy is not morally significant. Recall that Fair Equality of Opportunity (FEO) requires social\narrangements that bring it about that any persons with the same native\ntalent and the same ambition will have roughly equivalent competitive\nprospects. Suppose there is enhanced technological capacity to alter\npeople's genetic makeup, and hence their native talents, now or in the\nfuture. This change might be thought to put pressure on the advocate\nof FEO to revise her principle to require equalization of native\ntalents so that all individuals with the same ambition will enjoy\nroughly equivalent prospects for competitive success (and why not\nconsider the proclivity to be ambitious a trait like another that\nmight be altered by social engineering in the service of a strong\nequal opportunity principle?). The issue here turns on what the\nfundamental underlying rationale for FEO is thought to be, or should\nbe thought to be. The problems posed by the existence of individuals with severe\ndisabilities might suggest an objection against formal and substantive\nconceptions of equality of opportunity or at least raise doubts about\ntheir ethical importance. Consider a society in which formal equality\nof opportunity and Rawlsian FEO are perfectly achieved. All posts and\npositions that confer superior advantages and benefits go to\nindividuals selected by fair competitions that satisfy both formal\nequality of opportunity and FEO. All of this is compatible with the\nexistence of a class of individuals who lack qualifications for any\npositions whatsoever. These individuals are effectively excluded from\nparticipation in society. The jobs and positions that confer superior\nrewards might require complex cognitive skills, and some cognitively\ndeficient individuals are incapable of performing these complex tasks.\nJobs might also require complex physical dexterity, which some\nphysically impaired individuals are incapable of developing. Despite\nperfectly conforming to demanding equality of opportunity norms, the\nsociety as so far described might appear to be unjust by too stingy\nprovision of opportunity to its least qualified members. Unease on this score is increased with the reflection that what\nqualifies a person as able or disabled (or for that matter as talented\nor untalented) is not simply a function of her natural attributes but\nis rather a function of the mesh between her natural attributes and\nthe traits that are valued by people given the organization of society\n(Buchanan et al. 2000: chapter 3 and 7; Wikler 1983). In a complex\ntechnological society, individuals are excluded from participation in\nits main activities who would be included in a different form of\nsociety. A person who could manage an ox cart might be unable to drive\na car and hence significantly handicapped in a social order that\nrelies on transportation by car. A person who could carry out valuable\ntasks in a hunter-gatherer society might be incapable of sophisticated\nmathematical and literacy skills required in a complex modern economy.\nThe question then arises, to what extent must society be organized so\nthat all of its members are able to participate as full members in the\nactivities that constitute a decent life in the society? For many, this question will trigger a belief that even a society\nthat perfectly implements equality of opportunity and in which\nsuperior positions always go to those who most merit them could not be\na substitute for a more complete theory of justice that addresses the\nissue, what sorts of social hierarchy are morally acceptable. Equality\nof opportunity is not the full story about social justice. It might\nalso turn out that reflection on the morality of inclusion might yield\nthe result that equality of opportunity is only a rather thin chapter\nin the story of social justice. A decent society might tolerate in the\nname of justice significant deviations from perfect equality of\nopportunity in order to achieve other justice values. For example,\ninclusion of people with low native talent might be achieved by\nchanneling extra educational resources to them and by subsidizing\ntheir hiring by private and public firms even at substantial cost to\nFEO and even to the less controversial careers open to talents. It might be useful to compare the concern about the morality of\ninclusion discussed in this section with the concern about the scope\nof equality of opportunity discussed in\n section 3. A society provides too little\nscope of opportunity if it provides insufficient ways for a wide range\nof worthy human talents to be recognized, developed, and exercised. A\nsociety fails to be sufficiently inclusive if in order to shape\ninstitutions and practices in order to increase the satisfactions they\noffer (or to achieve some other goal) it sets educational and\noccupational and related standards so high that some individuals are\nunfairly prevented from participating in any meaningful way in the\nactivities and practices valued by the society. A society could\nsatisfy appropriate scope demands but fail to be sufficiently\ninclusive, or it could be sufficiently inclusive but fail to satisfy\nappropriate scope demands. The luck egalitarian conception of equal opportunity has attracted\nthe criticism that distributive justice should not be interpreted as\ncalling for the elimination of inequalities between persons arising\nfrom natural endowments rather than social arrangements (Nagel 1997\nand Anderson 1999). On its face, this is a puzzling claim, because\nwhether being born with a propensity to be tall rather than short\nturns out to be an advantage or disadvantage depends on social\narrangements—on whether the individual gets adequate nutrition\nto grow tall, and on whether activities that are better performed by\ntall persons are valued in the society, and so on. The idea might be\nthat if having a native propensity to acquire a trait will give rise\nto advantage or disadvantage given ordinary upbringing and ordinary\nfree market arrangements, the propensity counts as a natural endowment\nadvantage On this view, luck egalitarianism goes wrong by\noverreaching, insisting on undoing unproblematic inequalities. Those who voice this criticism sometimes couple it with another:\nthat the equality that is morally compelling is equality of status as\na free and equal person in democratic society, not any sort of\ndistributive equality guaranteeing that all should have the same or be\ntreated the same. On this view, fair shares of resources need not\ninvolve initial equal opportunity for resources or welfare or any\nother sort of advantage. Rather, distributive justice requires that\nthe distribution of resources across members of society should not\nsubvert the status of all as free and equal. All should have\nopportunity to participate in democratic society on a footing of\nequality (Scheffler 2003, 2005; Anderson 1999); for\ncritical response, see Tan 2008). Moreover, the moral imperative of\nsustaining equal opportunity to be a full participating member of\nsociety is not dampened or extinguished when members of society behave\nin ways others regard as imprudent or unvirtuous or undeserving. Being\na responsible member of society might be a good thing but one's moral\nentitlement to equality of status is not conditional on good\nbehavior. In response: A society could satisfy the democratic equality ideal\n(sustaining equal opportunity for all to be participants in democratic\nsociety) even though some portion of its members ends up with meager\nprovision and meager material opportunities and squalid unfulfilling\nlives. Some might hold that distributive justice principles should\nregister such a condition as injustice. Also, while a reasonable\nconception of fair shares might require more than initial equal\nopportunity, and might require that individuals who start to make a\nmess of their lives be given second, third, or fourth chances, that\ndoes not gainsay the responsibility of individuals to use the\nopportunities they have judiciously and the imperative of integrating\na sensible norm of personal responsibility into sensible norms of\ndistributive justice. (See the entries on\n egalitarianism and on\n distributive justice.) Any doctrine that asserts that it is morally desirable or morally\nrequired per se or for its own sake that everyone should be\nequally well off attracts the leveling down objection. The objection\nis simply that if equality of condition is noninstrumentally morally\nvaluable, then it is morally better, in one respect, if those\ncurrently better off than others are made worse off (so long as they\ndo not fall below the average level), even if worsening the condition\nof these people brings about no gain or benefit for anyone\nelse—but it is implausible to hold that such leveling-down\nchanges in and of themselves improve the situation in any respect. The\nobjection applies to any ideal of equality of condition and also to\nany ideal of equality of treatment. Recall an ancient quip attributed\nto the philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser. Roughed up and arrested by the\npolice in the course of student protests at Columbia University, he\nwas asked whether he thought he had suffered unfair, unjust\ntreatment. He replied that the treatment unleashed by the police was\nunjust (because beating up innocent people is unjust) but not unfair\n(because “they were beating everybody”). The proponent of\nthe leveling down objection denies that it is in any respect better to\nbeat up more innocent people rather than fewer in order to achieve\nequality of treatment across innocent people. Applying to any view that says people should have the same or enjoy\nthe same condition or be treated the same, the leveling down objection\napplies to equality of opportunity views. As characterized in this\nentry, formal equality of opportunity just insists on no wrongful\ndiscrimination, but the leveling down objection denies that it would\nbe in any respect noninstrumentally morally better to discriminate\nequally across a group of people who do not merit this treatment as\nopposed to discriminating against some but not all in the group. The\nleveling down objection applies straightforwardly to FEO and to\nlevel-the-playing-field or luck egalitarian distributive justice\ndoctrines. (On the leveling down objection, see Parfit 2000; Holtug\n2010: chapter 7, and for criticism, Temkin 1993: chapter 9.) However,\nthis claim is just a suggestion in the absence of some proposed metric\nfor determining how to rank possible deviations from FEO and luck\negalitarian doctrines. The hunch to be confirmed is that for any\nplausible measure, the result will be that this version of equality\nwill say that there is something to be said in favor of moving close\nto equality (of opportunity) by making better offs worse off without\noffering any improvement in the condition of worse offs. The\ncounterclaim will be that there is no respect in which leveling down\nimproves the situation. Related to the leveling-down objection but distinct from it is the\nsuggestion that opportunities should be maximized, or maximined,\nrather than equalized. To illustrate the suggestion, consider a world\nin which formal equality of opportunity and Rawlsian fair equality of\nopportunity are perfectly fulfilled. In this situation, there will be\na certain number of opportunities that are regulated by these equal\nopportunity principles that are available to those who have the least\nof these opportunities. For simplicity suppose these opportunities\nconsist of places in attractive postsecondary colleges and\nuniversities and other schools (where the number of applicants for\nslots exceeds the number of available slots), employment opportunities\nconsisting of starting places in public and private firms and\npromotions in these enterprises, bank loans available for investment\npurposes including self-employment and starting a business, and\nlicenses provided by the state that are legally required for engaging\nin certain occupations. Issues will arise here as to how to\nindividuate and count opportunities; just suppose we can limit our\nattention to situations in which judgments that more or fewer\nopportunities are available to groups are uncontroversialy\nunproblematic. Now consider the hypothesis that if equal opportunity\nregulations were reduced or eliminated, opportunities overall would\nincrease, and in particular opportunities available to those who have\nthe fewest opportunities available would increase.  We should not be\nimpressed if the number of opportunities increases by multiplying the\nnumber of very bad opportunities available to people, so let it be\nstipulated that opportunities increase only if the lucrativeness of\nsome options, the nonpay desirable characteristics of some options,\nthe significant variety of equally good options, and the overall\ndesirability of options rated best by every individual, all\nincrease. The suggestion is that when this hypothesis holds, it would\nbe morally inappropriate to insist on maintenance of equal\nopportunity. One might propose amending an equal opportunity principle\nto allow deviations from it when deviations increase the regulated\nopportunities available to those who have the least such\nopportunities. Rawls allows deviations from his fair equality of\nopportunity norm when this condition is met. The suggestion that insistence on equal opportunity might reduce\nthe opportunities available to the worst off in this regard might\nprompt a broader rejection of equal opportunity principles. The\nrejectionist proposes dropping equal opportunity norms altogether in\nfavor of maximining competitive opportunities. A less egalitarian\ndevelopment of the suggestion would favor maximization of such\nopportunities rather than maximizing the opportunities available to\nthose who enjoy the least of them. The fact that both formal and substantive conceptions of equality\nof opportunity and the rival level playing field conception as well\nare proposed as ancillary requirements or supplements to a theory of\njustified social hierarchy poses a general issue concerning their\njustification. The setting in which equal opportunity is proposed is\none in which a theory of justified hierarchy is on hand. Equal\nopportunity asserts that the desirable positions in the social\nhierarchy should be accessible to all members of society according to\nthe equality of opportunity norm. But the social hierarchy itself is\njustified on some independent basis. Let us suppose that in general\nthe theory of justice holds that a social hierarchy is desirable to\nthe extent that it produces morally desirable consequences. The theory\nof justice identifies the morally desirable consequences that\ninstitutions and practices are to be arranged to promote. For example,\nin John Rawls's theory of justice, it is asserted that institutions\nand practices should be arranged so that the worst off are as well off\nover the long run as possible. More specifically, Rawls proposes that\ninequalities in social and economic benefits (other than basic civil\nliberties that are regulated by another principle) are just or fair if\nthey satisfy two conditions--they are attached to positions and\noffices open to all under fair equality of opportunity and they work\nto the maximal advantage of the worst off members of society. It might be the case that the inequalities that would maximize the\nadvantage level of the worst off would also as a matter of fact also\nsatisfy fair equality of opportunity. Still, one might ask if fair\nequality of opportunity is justified as a free-standing moral\nrequirement or as instrumental to the achievement of other justice\ngoals (for criticism of FEO as a free-standing requirement, see Pogge\n1989, chapter 4). To investigate the issue, one must look at possible\ncases in which the fair equality of opportunity norm constrains the\npursuit of other justice values (Arneson 1999, 2013). In some, perhaps many circumstances, FEO will be a nonbinding\nconstraint on the maximization of the primary social goods prospects\nfor the least advantaged. In such cases FEO either helps boost the\nadvantages of the least advantaged or is a nonfactor. But it may well\nbe that sometimes adherence to FEO requires us to forego hierarchy\nthat would work to the advantage of the worst off. In such cases, why\ninsist on FEO? For example, allowing the rich to buy a head start for\ntheir children, though it violates FEO, may cause many to try harder\nto become rich and might thereby greatly enhance economic effort to\nthe benefit of all. For another example, the resources needed to\npolice individual behavior so that FEO is even remotely close to\nsatisfied might well be enormous. These resources could instead be\ndiverted into public expenditure intelligently designed to improve the\ncondition of the worse off. There is a more general conflict in this area. One might not uphold\nthe maximizing of primary goods prospects for those in society who are\nworst off in this respect as a high-priority justice principle. One\nsource of doubt is the thought that the ultimate justice aim should be\npromoting genuinely good lives for people with good fairly\ndistributed. From this welfarist perspective, how big a pile of\nresources and opportunities society enables one to attain is not of\nfundamental moral importance; what matters is what one is enabled to\naccomplish and does accomplish with whatever resources and\nopportunities one gets. Another source of doubt is the thought that\nthe Rawlsian difference principle, the identification of distributive\njustice with maximizing the prospects of the very worst off (subject\nto the FEO constraint), is too extreme in the priority it assigns to\nachieving gains for the very worst off. The difference principle in\neffect says that one should prefer a penny more for the worst off when\nthat group has one member to the alternative of bringing about gains\nof any magnitude however large for any number of better than worst off\npersons however huge. Priority for the worse off plausibly takes a\nless extreme form. So in considering the plausibility of the fair\nequality of opportunity constraint on boosting the advantages of the\nworst off when enabling inequalities is the best means to helping the\nworst off, the difference principle should serve as a stand-in for\nwhatever broadly egalitarian distributive justice aims we take to be\nmost compelling. FEO does not become more acceptable if the Rawlsian\nprinciple to which FEO is attached as a constraint is deemed\nimplausible. So conflict between fair equality of opportunity and the\nRawlsian difference principle is merely illustrative of further\nconflict. For concreteness, suppose that the advantages for the worst off\nmembers of society could be maximized by a regime that combines\nlibertarian labor markets with high taxation of incomes and\nredistribution that enhances the quality of life of the worst off. But\nunder libertarian labor markets, neither formal nor substantive\nequality of opportunity is required. Instead contract at will\nprevails.  In this society, if markets come to operate more as\nnetworks of trade among people who know and trust one another than as\ntextbook exchange among strangers, networks might follow lines of\nfamily, clan, and ethnicity, so that even formal equality of\nopportunity is violated. In this setting, consider a white woman who\nis denied a promotion in her firm just because she is white and a\nwoman. She suffers a disadvantage, the denial of the promotion, merely\nbecause of features of herself that are either unalterable or that she\nshould not be expected to alter in order to gain fair access to\neconomic opportunity. But if the society that tolerates these\nviolations of equality of opportunity thereby maximizes the advantage\nlevel enjoyed by the worst off, then there is no way to alter social\nlaws and practices so as to render this woman and people who suffer\nsimilar disadvantage better off by enforcing careers open to talents\nwithout thereby making someone worse off than she and they are who is\nalso disadvantaged by features of herself that are beyond her power to\ncontrol. The person with small talent who finds herself in the worst-\noff class in a properly functioning society that rewards talent in\norder to stimulate economic productivity and ultimately the benefit\nlevel of the worst off might well regard herself as having a stronger\nclaim to consideration than the better off person with significant\ntalent who finds herself disadvantaged by the failure of society to\nenforce equality of opportunity when equal opportunity norms are not\neffective means to boost the long-run advantage of the least\nadvantaged.  In the situation envisaged, FEO assigns priority to helping a\nbetter off person in a certain respect: enable the person to have the\nsame prospects of competitive success as anyone else with the same\nnative talent and ambition. In contrast, priority to the worse off\nsays institute whatever policies will increase a function of aggregate\nwell-being that gives greater weight to achieving gains for a person,\nthe worse off she would otherwise be. The claim then will be that if\nthe weights are properly set, priority appropriately balances the\ndesirability of achieving benefits for better-off and worse-off\npeople. From this standpoint, FEO goes wrong in several ways—in\nprivileging resources over welfare outcomes, in failing to allow\ninequalities that advance priority-weighted well-being if the FEO\nconstraint cannot be satisfied, and in demanding that resources flow\nto better-off people, when required to fulfill the FEO constraint,\neven when those resources would do more priority-weighted good by\nbeing deployed elsewhere, such as to the worse off. Faced with this example, many will insist that equality of\nopportunity norms should prevail, or at least have some weight against\nother justice values. But one wonders if the underlying rationale for\nthis insistence is not the residual shadow of a meritocratic belief\nthat the person with superior native talent has a strong entitlement\nto gain any superior rewards that society dispenses if society does\nnot insist on strict equality of benefits for all. Why else adopt\nnorms that in the example above favor the talented woman disadvantaged\nthrough no fault of her own (because she is white and a woman) over\nthe worse off untalented person also disadvantaged through no fault of\nher own (because she had the bad luck of being born untalented)? The slogan “equality of opportunity” commands wide\nallegiance among the members of contemporary societies. Under\nscrutiny, equality of opportunity divides into several different\nideals, some of them being opposed rivals. It is controversial which\nof these ideals, if any, are morally acceptable, and which, if any,\nshould be coercively enforced as requirements of justice. (For a\nmoderately skeptical overview, see Cavanagh 2002.) Debates about the\nseemingly banal norm of equality of opportunity reveal profound\ndisagreements as to the nature of fair terms of cooperation in the\nmodern world.","contact.mail":"rarneson@ucsd.edu","contact.domain":"ucsd.edu"}]
