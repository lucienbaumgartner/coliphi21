In this article, we\nbegin with a brief general discussion of the relationship between\nphilosophy and Christian dogma, and then we turn our attention to\nthree of the most philosophically challenging Christian doctrines: the\ntrinity, the incarnation, and the atonement. We take these three as\nour focus because, unlike (for example) doctrines about providence or\nthe attributes of God, these are distinctive to Christian theology\nand, unlike (for example) the doctrine of original sin or the Real\nPresence of Christ in the eucharist, these have been the subject of a\ngreat deal of discussion over the past couple of decades.\n\n\n\nIn the history of Christian theology, philosophy has sometimes been seen as \na natural complement to theological reflection, whereas at other times \npractitioners of the two disciplines have regarded each other as \nmortal enemies. Some early Christian thinkers such as Tertullian were\nof the view that any intrusion of secular philosophical reason into \ntheological reflection was out of order. Thus, even if certain \ntheological claims seemed to fly in the face of the standards of \nreasoning defended by philosophers, the religious believer should not\nflinch. Other early Christian thinkers, such as St. Augustine of \nHippo, argued that philosophical reflection complemented theology, \nbut only when these philosophical reflections were firmly grounded in\na prior intellectual commitment to the underlying truth of the \nChristian faith. Thus, the legitimacy of philosophy was derived from \nthe legitimacy of the underlying faith commitments. \n\nInto the High Middle Ages, Augustine's views were widely defended. It\nwas during this time however that St. Thomas Aquinas offered yet\nanother model for the relationship between philosophy and theology.\nAccording to the Thomistic model, philosophy and theology are distinct\nenterprises, differing primarily in their intellectual starting\npoints. Philosophy takes as its data the deliverances of our natural\nmental faculties: what we see, hear, taste, touch, and smell. These\ndata can be accepted on the basis of the reliability of our natural\nfaculties with respect to the natural world. Theology, on the other\nhand takes as its starting point the divine revelations contained in\nthe Bible. These data can be accepted on the basis of divine\nauthority, in a way analogous to the way in which we accept, for\nexample, the claims made by a physics professor about the basic facts\nof physics. \n\nOn this way of seeing the two disciplines, if at least one of the \npremises of an argument is derived from revelation, the argument \nfalls in the domain of theology; otherwise it falls into philosophy's\ndomain. Since this way of thinking about philosophy and theology \nsharply demarcates the disciplines, it is possible in principle that \nthe conclusions reached by one might be contradicted by the other. \nAccording to advocates of this model, however, any such conflict must\nbe merely apparent. Since God both created the world which is \naccessible to philosophy and revealed the texts accessible to \ntheologians, the claims yielded by one cannot conflict with the \nclaims yielded by another unless the philosopher or theologian has \nmade some prior error. \n\nSince the deliverances of the two disciplines must then coincide,\nphilosophy can be put to the service of theology (and perhaps\nvice-versa). How might philosophy play this complementary role?\nFirst, philosophical reasoning might persuade some who do not accept\nthe authority of purported divine revelation of the claims contained\nin religious texts. Thus, an atheist who is unwilling to accept the\nauthority of religious texts might come to believe that God exists on\nthe basis of purely philosophical arguments. Second, distinctively\nphilosophical techniques might be brought to bear in helping the\ntheologian clear up imprecise or ambiguous theological claims. Thus,\nfor example, theology might provide us with information sufficient to\nconclude that Jesus Christ was a single person with two natures, one\nhuman and one divine, but leave us in the dark about exactly how this\nrelationship between divine and human natures is to be understood.\nThe philosopher can provide some assistance here, since, among other\nthings, he or she can help the theologian discern which models are\nlogically inconsistent and thus not viable candidates for\nunderstanding the relationship between the divine and human natures in\nChrist. \n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the vast majority of English\nlanguage philosophy—including philosophy of religion—went\non without much interaction with theology at all. While there are a\nnumber of complex reasons for this divorce, three are especially\nimportant.  \n\nThe first reason is that atheism was the predominant opinion among\nEnglish language philosophers throughout much of that century. A\nsecond, quite related reason is that philosophers in the twentieth\ncentury regarded theological language as either meaningless, or, at\nbest, subject to scrutiny only insofar as that language had a bearing\non religious practice. The former belief (i.e., that theological\nlanguage was meaningless) was inspired by a tenet of logical\npositivism, according to which any statement that lacks empirical\ncontent is meaningless. Since much theological language, for example,\nlanguage describing the doctrine of the Trinity, lacks empirical\ncontent, such language must be meaningless. The latter belief,\ninspired by Wittgenstein, holds that language itself only has meaning\nin specific practical contexts, and thus that religious language was\nnot aiming to express truths about the world which could be subjected\nto objective philosophical scrutiny.  \n\nA third reason is that a great many academic theologians also became\nskeptical of our ability to think and speak meaningfully about God;\nbut, rather than simply abandon traditional doctrines of Christianity,\nmany of them turned away from more “metaphysical” and\nquasi-scientific ways of doing theology, embracing instead a variety\nof alternative construals and developments of these\ndoctrines—including, but not limited to, metaphorical,\nexistentialist, and postmodern construals. This, we might add, seems\nto be one reason why the methodological rift between so-called\n“analytic” and “non-analytic” philosophers has\nto some extent been replicated as a rift between analytic philosophers\nof religion and their counterparts in theology. \n\nIn the last forty years, however, philosophers of religion have\nreturned to the business of theorizing about many of the traditional\ndoctrines of Christianity and have begun to apply the tools of\ncontemporary philosophy in ways that are somewhat more eclectic than\nwhat was envisioned under the Augustinian or Thomistic models. In\nkeeping with the recent academic trend, contemporary philosophers of\nreligion have been unwilling to maintain hard and fast distinctions\nbetween the two disciplines. As a result, it is often difficult in\nreading recent work to distinguish what the philosophers are doing\nfrom what the theologians (and philosophers) of past centuries\nregarded as strictly within the theological domain.  Indeed,\nphilosophers and theologians alike are now coming to use the term\n“analytic theology” to refer to theological work that aims\nto explore and unpack theological doctrines in a way that draws on the\nresources, methods, and relevant literature of contemporary analytic\nphilosophy.  The use of this term reflects the heretofore largely\nunacknowledged reality that the sort of work now being done under the\nlabel “philosophical theology” is as\nmuch theology as it is philosophical. \n\nIn what follows, we provide a brief survey of work on the three topics\nin contemporary philosophical theology that—aside from general\nissues concerning the nature, attributes, and providence of\nGod—have received the most attention from philosophers of\nreligion over the past quarter century. We thus leave aside such\nstaple topics in philosophy of religion as traditional arguments for\nthe existence of God, the problem of evil, the epistemology of\nreligious belief, the nature and function of religious language. We\nalso leave aside a variety of important but less-discussed topics in\nphilosophical theology, such as the nature of divine revelation and\nscripture, original sin, the authority of tradition, and the\nlike. (For discussions of work falling under some of these topics, see\nthe Related Entries section below, as well as the works under the\n“General” heading in the bibliography.) \n\nFrom the beginning, Christians have affirmed the claim that there is\none God, and three persons—Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit—each of whom is God. In 675 C.E., the Council of Toledo\nframed this doctrine as follows: \n\nCornelius Plantinga, Jr., reflecting on the Council of Toledo's\nformulation, remarks that it “possesses great puzzling\npower” (Plantinga 1989, 22). No doubt this is an\nunderstatement. The doctrine of the trinity is deeply puzzling, and it\nis so in a way that has led some of Christianity's critics to claim\nthat it is outright incoherent. Indeed, it looks like we can derive a\ncontradiction from the doctrine, as follows: The doctrine states that\nthere is exactly one God; that the Father is God, the Son is God, and\nthe Spirit is God; and that Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct. Now,\n‘is God’ either means ‘is identical God’ or\n‘is divine’.  Either way, however, we have a problem.  If\nthe Father is identical to God and the Son is identical to God, then\n(by the transitivity of identity) the Father is identical to the Son,\ncontrary to the doctrine.  On the other hand, if the Father is divine\nand the Son is divine and the Father is distinct from the Son, then\nthere are at least two divine persons—i.e., two Gods—also\ncontrary to the doctrine. Either way, then, the doctrine seems\nincoherent.  \n\nThis puzzle is sometimes called “the threeness-oneness\nproblem”, or “the logical problem of the\ntrinity”. At first blush, it might seem rather easy to solve.\nWhy not say, for example, that God is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\nin much the same way that Clark Kent is the mild-mannered friend of\nLois Lane, the biological son of Jor-El the Kryptonian, and the Man of\nSteel?  Or why not say that Father, Son, and Spirit count as one God\nin just the way that the various items in your shopping cart might\ncount as “one order”?  The answer, in short, is that the\nChristian tradition has set boundaries on how the doctrine is to be\nexplicated, and these sorts of models fall afoul of those\nboundaries. Two of the most salient “errors” to be avoided\nare modalism and tritheism.  In the words of the\nso-called Athanasian Creed, the doctrine of the trinity is to be\nunderstood without either “confounding the persons” or\n“dividing the substance”.  Modalism confounds the\npersons. It is the view that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are mere\nmanifestations, modes, or roles played by the one and only God. Ruling\nout modalism thus rules out analogies like the Superman analogy just\ngiven.  Tritheism divides the substance.  It is a bit tricky (because\ncontroversial) to say exactly what tritheism, or polytheism more\ngenerally, is. (For discussion, see Rea 2006.) But whatever else it\nmight be, it is certainly implied by the view that there are three\ndistinct divine substances. Assuming the items in your shopping cart\ncount as multiple distinct substances, then, the problem with the\nshopping cart analogy is that it suggests polytheism.  \n\nIn what follows, we will consider several more sophisticated models of\nthe trinity: the social model, the psychological model, and the\nconstitution model.  These do not exhaust the field of possible\nsolutions, but they are the ones to which the most attention has been\npaid in the recent literature. (For more detailed surveys, see Rea\n(2009) and, at book length, McCall (2011).) \n\nThroughout the gospels, the first two persons of the trinity are\nreferred to as ‘Father’ and ‘Son’. This\nsuggests the analogy of a family, or, more generally, a society. Thus,\nthe persons of the trinity might be thought of as one in just the way\nthat the members of a family are one: they are three individual human\nbeings, but taken together they are a single family. Since there is no\ncontradiction in thinking of a family as three and one in this way,\nthis analogy appears to solve the problem. Those who attempt to\nunderstand the trinity primarily in terms of this analogy are\ntypically called social trinitarians. This approach has been\n(controversially) associated with the Eastern Church, tracing its\nroots to the Cappadocian Fathers—Basil of Caesarea, his brother\nGregory of Nyssa, and their friend Gregory Nazianzen. (Until recently,\nit was fairly common to distinguish “Latin” or\n“Western” models of the Trinity from “Greek”\nor “Eastern” models.  Against this practice, see\nespecially Ayres 2004 and Barnes 1995b.)   \n\nCritics point out that if ‘familial unity’ is all there is\nto trinitarian oneness, and so all that is required for monotheism,\nthen it is hard to see why various polytheistic systems fail to count\nas versions of monotheism.  Consider, for example, the children of\nChronos in Greek mythology, of whom Zeus was the liberator.  These\nchildren included Zeus, Hera, Ares, and a variety of other Olympian\ndeities—all members of a divine family.  Nobody, however, thinks\nthat the fact that Zeus and his siblings (nor even, say, Zeus and his\nbegotten daughter Athena) count in any meaningful sense as one\ngod.  \nFor this reason, social trinitarians are often quick to note that\nthere are other relations that hold between members of the trinity\nthat contribute, along with their being members of a single divine\nfamily, to their counting as one God. Richard Swinburne, for example,\nhas defended a version of this view according to which the unity among\nthe divine persons is secured by several facts in conjunction with one\nanother.  First, the divine persons share all of the essential\ncharacteristics of divinity: omniscience, omnipotence, moral\nperfection, and so forth. Second, unlike the deities of familiar\npolytheistic systems, their wills are necessarily harmonious, so that\nthey can never come into conflict with one another. Third, they stand\nin a relationship of perfect love and necessary mutual\ninterdependence. On this sort of view, there is one God because the\ncommunity of divine persons is so closely interconnected that,\nalthough they are three distinct persons, they nonetheless function as\nif they were a single entity. One might think that if we were to\nconsider a group of three human persons who exhibited these\ncharacteristics of necessary unity, volitional harmony, and love, it\nwould likewise be hard to regard them as entirely distinct. And that\nis, of course, just the intuition that the view aims to elicit. \n\nStill, many regard the sort of unity just described as not strong\nenough to secure a respectable monotheism. Thus, some social\ntrinitarians have attempted to give other accounts of what unifies the\ndivine persons.  Perhaps the most popular such account is the\npart–whole model. C.S. Lewis's version of this analogy (Lewis\n1958, Bk IV, Ch 2) has it that God is “three Persons while\nremaining one Being, just as a cube is six squares while remaining one\ncube”. More recently, J. P. Moreland and William Lane Craig\n(2003) have argued that the relation between the persons of the\nTrinity can be thought of as analogous to the relation we might\nsuppose to obtain between the three dog-like beings that compose\nCerberus, the mythical guardian of the underworld. One might say that\neach of the three heads—or each of the three souls associated\nwith the heads—is a fully canine individual, and yet there is\nonly one being, Cerberus, with the full canine nature.  Three\n“persons” of a sort, and yet just one dog. \nThe Moreland & Craig proposal is clearly quite different from\nSwinburne's and, as should be obvious, it in no way invokes the\nanalogy of a family or a society.  At this point, therefore, it is\nnatural to wonder what exactly it is that makes both proposals count\nas versions of social trinitarianism.  Unfortunately, this is\na question to which self-proclaimed social trinitarians have not given\na very clear answer. Perhaps the most common answer is that\npart–whole models like Moreland & Craig's resemble society\nand family models simply by virtue of “starting with the\nthreeness in the Trinity and trying to explain the\noneness”. However, this answer is less than fully illuminating.\nWhat is needed is some characterization of the common core underlying\nthe diverse views that are generally regarded as versions of social\ntrinitarianism. The following two theses seem to capture that core:\n(i) the divine persons are not numerically the same substance, and\n(ii) monotheism does not require that there be exactly one divine\nsubstance—rather, it can be secured by the obtaining of\nrelations like the part—whole relation, or necessary mutual\ninterdependence, or some other sort of relation among numerically\ndistinct divine substances. Together, these two theses seem to express\nthe central idea underlying both the family analogy and the models\ndeveloped by Swinburne and Moreland & Craig. As explained earlier,\nthis core idea provides a solution to the problem of the trinity by\nshowing how one might deny the inference from ‘the Father is\ndivine, the Son is divine, and the Spirit is divine; and Father, Son,\nand Spirit are distinct from one another’ to the conclusion that\nthere is more than one God. \n\nStill, despite its attractions, many critics remain unsatisfied by the\nMoreland & Craig proposal. One of the more serious problems is\nthat it is inconsistent with the Nicene Creed.  The creed opens with\n“I believe in God, the Father Almighty”; but proponents of\nthe Moreland & Craig model cannot say this because, on their view,\nGod (analogous to Cerberus) is not the Father Almighty\n(analogous to one of the heads, or the soul of one of the heads).\nLikewise, the Creed says that Father and Son are consubstantial. This\nclaim is absolutely central to the doctrine of the trinity, and the\nnotion of consubstantiality lay at the very heart of the debates in\nthe 4th Century C.E. that shaped the Nicene Creed's expression of the\ndoctrine.  But the three souls, or centers of consciousness, of the\nheads of Cerberus are not in any sense consubstantial. If they are\nsubstances at all (which Moreland & Craig take them to be), they\nare three distinct substances.  \nOther versions of the part–whole model raise further worries.  A\ncube, for example, is a seventh thing in addition to its six sides;\nbut we do not want to say that God is a fourth thing in addition to\nits three parts.  The reason is that saying this forces a dilemma:\nEither God is a person, or God is not. If the former, then we have a\nquaternity rather than a trinity. If the latter, then we seem to\ncommit ourselves to claims that are decidedly anti-theistic: God\ndoesn't know anything (since only persons can be knowers); God doesn't\nlove anybody (since only persons can love); God is amoral (since only\npersons are part of the moral community); and so on. Bad news either\nway, then. Thus, many are motivated to seek other models. \n\nMany theologians have looked to features of the human mind or\n“psyche” to find models to help illuminate the doctrine of\nthe trinity. Historically, the use of psychological analogies is\nespecially associated with thinkers in the Latin-speaking West,\nparticularly from Augustine onward. Augustine himself suggested\nseveral important analogies, as did others in the medieval Latin\ntradition. However, since our focus in this article is on more\ncontemporary models, we will pass over these here and focus instead on\ntwo more recently developed psychological analogies. \n\nThomas V. Morris has suggested that we can find an analogy for the \ntrinity in the psychological condition known as multiple personality \ndisorder: just as a single human being can have multiple \npersonalities, so too a single God can exist in three persons \n(though, of course, in the case of God this is a cognitive virtue, \nnot a defect) (Morris 1986). Others—Trenton Merricks for \nexample—have suggested that we can conceive of the divine persons on \nanalogy with the separate spheres of consciousness that result from \ncommissurotomy(Merricks 2006). Commissurotomy is a \nprocedure, sometimes used to treat epilepsy, that involves cutting \nthe bundle of nerves (the corpus callosum) by which the two \nhemispheres of the brain communicate. Those who have undergone this \nprocedure typically function normally in daily life; but, under \ncertain kinds of experimental conditions, they display psychological \ncharacteristics that suggest that there are two distinct spheres of \nconsciousness associated with the two hemispheres of their brain. \nThus, according to this analogy, just as a single human can, in that \nway, have two distinct spheres of consciousness, so too a single \ndivine being can exist in three persons, each of which is a distinct \nsphere of consciousness. As with social trinitarianism, each of these analogies solves the\nproblem of the trinity by offering a way of denying the inference from\n‘the Father is divine, the Son is divine, and the Spirit is\ndivine; and Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct from one\nanother’ to the conclusion that there is more than one God.\nMoreover, both analogies seem to have this advantage over social\ntrinitarianism: both seem to present real-life cases in which a\nsingle rational substance is nonetheless “divided”\ninto multiple personalities or centers of consciousness. Precisely\nthis feature of the analogies, however, also raises the spectre of\nmodalism.  In the case of multiple personality disorder, there is no\nreal temptation to reify the distinct personalities, to treat them as\ndistinct person-like beings subsisting in or as a single\nsubstance. They are, rather, quite straightforwardly understandable as\ndistinct aspects of a single, albeit fragmented,\npsychological subject.  Similarly in the case of the commissurotomy\nanalogy. It is highly unnatural to treat the distinct centers of\nconsciousness as distinct persons; rather, it is most plausible to\ntreat them as mere aspects of a single subject. Note, too, that it is\nhard to see how the personalities and centers of consciousness that\nfigure into these analogies could be viewed as the same\nsubstance as one another, as the doctrine of the trinity requires\nus to say of the divine persons. Again, it is natural to see them\nmerely as distinct aspects of a single substance.  This, then, seems\nto be the primary objection that proponents of these sorts of\nanalogies need to overcome.  \n\nThe third and final solution to the problem of the trinity that we\nwant to explore invokes the notion of “relative sameness.”\nThis is the idea that things can be the same relative to one kind of\nthing, but distinct relative to another. More formally: \n\nIf this claim is true, then it is open to us to say that the Father, \nSon, and Holy Spirit are the same God but distinct \npersons. Notice, however, that this is all we need to make sense of \nthe trinity. If the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same God \n(and there are no other Gods), then there will be exactly one God; \nbut if they are also distinct persons (and there are only three of \nthem), then there will be three persons. \n\nThe main challenge for this solution is to show that the Relative\nSameness assumption is coherent, and to show that the doctrine of the\ntrinity can be stated in a way that is demonstrably consistent given\nthe assumption of relative identity. Peter van Inwagen's work on the\ntrinity (1988, 2003) has been mostly concerned with addressing this\nchallenge.  An additional, related challenge, however, is to provide\nsome further explanation or analogy that can help us to see what it\nmight mean to say that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit stand in\nthe relation of ‘relative sameness’. Initially, it is not\nat all clear what this might mean, for it seems that the statement\n‘x is the same F as y’ means\nnothing more or less than ‘x is\nan F, y is an F\nand x=y’, contrary to the assumption of\nRelative Sameness (above).  This challenge has been undertaken by\nMichael Rea and Jeffrey Brower (2005a, b; Brower 2004; Rea\n2009c). Their suggestion is that reflection on cases of material\nconstitution (e.g., statues and the lumps of matter that constitute\nthem) can help us to see how two things can be the same material\nobject but otherwise different entities. If this is\nright, then, by analogy, such reflection can also help us to see how\nFather, Son, and Holy Spirit can be the same God but three different\npersons. \n\nConsider Rodin's famous bronze statue, The Thinker. It is a\nsingle material object; but it can be truly described both as a statue\n(which is one kind of thing), and as a lump of bronze (which is\nanother kind of thing). A little reflection, moreover, reveals that\nthe statue is distinct from the lump of bronze. For example, if the\nstatue were melted down, we would no longer have both a lump and a\nstatue: the lump would remain (albeit in a different shape) but\nRodin's Thinker would no longer exist. This seems to show\nthat the lump is something distinct from the statue, since one thing\ncan exist apart from another only if they're distinct. If\nthis is right, then this is not a case in which one thing\nsimply appears in two different ways, or is referred to by\ntwo different labels.  It is, rather, a case in which two distinct\nthings occupy exactly the same region of space at the same time.\n \n\nMost of us readily accept the idea that distinct things,\nbroadly construed, can occupy the same place at the same time. The\nevent of your sitting, for example, occupies exactly the same place\nthat you do when you are seated.  But we are more reluctant to say\nthat distinct material objects occupy the same place at the\nsame time.  Philosophers have therefore suggested various ways of\nmaking sense of the phenomenon of material constitution. One way of\ndoing so is to say that the statue and the lump are the same\nmaterial object even though they are distinct relative to some\nother kind (e.g., hylomorphic compound). The advantage of\nthis idea is that it allows us to say that the statue and the lump\ncount as one material object, thus preserving the principle of one\nmaterial object to a place. The cost, however, is that we commit\nourselves to the initially puzzling idea that two distinct\nthings can be the same material object.  What, we might\nwonder, would it even mean for this to be true? But suppose we add\nthat all it means for one thing and another to be “the same\nmaterial object” is just for them to share all of their matter\nin common. It is hard to see why such a claim should be objectionable;\nand if it is right, then our problem is solved. The lump of bronze in\nour example is clearly distinct from The Thinker, since it\ncan exist without The Thinker; but it also clearly shares all\nthe same matter in common with The Thinker, and hence, on\nthis view, counts as the same material object. \n\nLikewise, then, we might say that all it means for one person and\nanother to be the same God is for them to do something analogous to\nsharing in common all of whatever is analogous to matter in divine\nbeings. On this view, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same\nGod but different persons in just the way a statue and its\nconstitutive lump are the same material object but different\nform-matter compounds. Of course, God is not material; so this\ncan only be an analogy. But still, it helps to provide an\nilluminating account of inter-trinitarian relations, and it does so in\na way that seems (at least initially) to avoid both modalism and\npolytheism.  Brower and Rea maintain that each person of the\ntrinity is a substance; thus, none is a mere aspect of a\nsubstance, and so modalism is avoided.  And yet they are the same\nsubstance; and so polytheism is avoided. \n\nThis account is not entirely free of difficulties however. It is\ntempting to see the view as simply playing a verbal trick: Brower and\nRea say that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are to be counted\nas one God; but since the divine Persons are fully distinct from one\nanother, it is natural to take the admonition to ‘count them as\none’ as nothing more than the proposal of a mere linguistic\nconvention.  Critics also object that this view does not directly\nanswer the question of how many material objects are present for any\ngiven region, lump, or chunk. Is there an objective way of deciding\nhow many objects are constituted by the lump of bronze that\ncomposes The Thinker? Are there only two things (statue and\nlump) or are there many more (paperweight, battering ram, etc.)? And\nif there are more, what determines how many there are? Unless we can\nanswer this question it is hard to know why the “divine\nmatter” constitutes exactly three persons (and not more). \n\nThe doctrine of the Incarnation holds that, at a time roughly two\nthousand years in the past, the second person of the trinity took on\nhimself a distinct, fully human nature. As a result, he was a single\nperson in full possession of two distinct natures, one human and one\ndivine. The Council of Chalcedon (451 C.E.) articulates the doctrine\nas follows: \n\nCritics have held this doctrine to be “impossible,\nself-contradictory, incoherent, absurd, and even\nunintelligible.” (Morris 1986: 18) The central difficulty for\nthe doctrine is that it seems to attribute to one person\ncharacteristics that are not logically compatible. For example, it\nseems on the one hand that human beings are necessarily created\nbeings, and that they are necessarily limited in power, presence,\nknowledge, and so on. On the other hand, divine beings are essentially\nthe opposite of all those things. Thus, it appears that one person\ncould bear both natures, human and divine, only if such a person could\nbe both limited and unlimited in various ways, created and uncreated,\nand so forth. And this is surely impossible. \n\nTwo main strategies have been pursued in an attempt to resolve this\napparent paradox. The first is the kenotic view. The second\nis the two-minds view.  We shall take each in turn. \nThe kenotic view (from the Greek kenosis meaning ’to \nempty’) finds its motivation in a New Testament passage which \nclaims that Christ Jesus  \nAccording to this view, in becoming incarnate, God the Son \nvoluntarily and temporarily laid aside some of his divine attributes \nin order to take on a human nature and thus his earthly mission. \n\nIf the kenotic view is correct, then (contrary to what theists are \nnormally inclined to think) properties like omnipotence, omniscience,\nand omnipresence are not essential to divinity: something can remain \ndivine even after putting some or all of those properties aside. The \nproblem, however, is that if these properties aren't essential to \ndivinity, then it is hard to see what would be essential. \nThe so-called ‘omni-properties’ seem to be constitutive \nof divinity; they are the properties in terms of which divinity is \ndefined. If we say that something can be divine while lacking those \nproperties, then we lose all grip on what it means to be divine.  \n\nOne might respond to this worry by saying that the only property that\nis essential to divine beings as such is the property being\ndivine. This reply, however, makes divinity out to be a\nprimitive, unanalyzable property. Critics like John Hick (1993: 73)\ncomplain that such a move makes divinity out to be unacceptably\nmysterious. Alternatively, one might simply deny that any\nproperties are necessary for divinity. It is widely held in the\nphilosophy of biology, for example, that there are no properties\npossession of which are jointly necessary andsufficient for membership\nin, say, the kind humanity.  Moreover, it is very hard to\nfind any interesting properties—apart from properties like\n‘having mass’ or ‘being an organism'—that are\neven merely necessary for being human. That is, it seems that for any\n(interesting) property you might think of as partly definitive of\nhumanity, there are or could be humans who lack that property. Thus,\nmany philosophers think that membership in the kind is determined\nsimply by family resemblance to paradigm examples of the\nkind. Something counts as human, in other words, if, and only if, it\nshares enough of the properties that are\ntypical of humanity. If we were to say the same thing about \ndivinity, there would be no in-principle objection to the idea that \nJesus counts as divine despite lacking omniscience or other \nproperties like, perhaps, omnipotence, omnipresence, or even perfect \ngoodness. One might just say that he is knowledgeable, powerful, and \ngood enough that, given his other attributes, he bears the \nright sort of family resemblance to the other members of the Godhead \nto count as divine. \n\nSome have offered more refined versions of the kenotic theory, arguing\nthat the basic view mischaracterizes the divine attributes.  According\nto these versions of the kenotic view, rather than attribute to God\nproperties like ommniscience, omipotence, and the like, we should\ninstead say that God has properties like the following: being\nomniscient-unless-temporarily-and-freely-choosing-to-be-otherwise,\nbeing\nomnipotent-unless-temporarily-and-freely-choosing-to-be-otherwise, and\nso forth. These latter sorts of properties can be retained without\ncontradiction even when certain powers are laid aside. In this way,\nthen, Jesus can divest himself of some of his powers to become fully\nhuman while still remaining fully divine. (Feenstra, 1989: 128–152)\nUnfortunately, however, this response only raises a further question,\nnamely: if Christ's incarnation required his temporarily surrendering\nomniscience, then his later exaltation must have involved continued\nnon-omniscience or the loss of his humanity. However, Christians have\ntypically argued that the exalted Christ is omniscient while retaining\nhis humanity. It is hard to see how this view can respond to such an\nobjection. (But for one response see Feenstra 2007: 539). \n\nMoving away from the standard version of the kenotic theory, some \nphilosophers and theologians endorse views according to which it only\nseems as if Christ lacked divine attributes like omniscience, \nomnipotence, and so on. Views according to which it simply seems to \nus (ordinary human beings) as if he lacks those attributes are called\n“krypsis” accounts of the incarnation. They are views according to \nwhich the apparent loss of divine attributes is only pretense or \nillusion. Among other things, this raises the concern that the \nincarnation is somehow a grand deception, thus casting doubt on \nChrist's moral perfection. More acceptable, then, are views according\nto which it somehow seems even to Christ himself as if \ncertain divine attributes which he actually possesses have been laid \naside. On this view, the loss of omniscience, omnipotence, and so on \nis only simulated. Christ retains all of the traditional divine \nattributes.  But from his point of view it is, nevertheless, as if \nthose attributes are gone. A view like this might be characterized as\npositing a “functional kenosis.” (Cf. Crisp 2007, Ch. 2.) \n\nOne concern that might be raised with respect to the doctrine of\nfunctional kenosis is that it is hard to see how a divine being could\npossibly simulate (to himself, without outright pretense) the loss of\nattributes like omniscience or omnipotence. But perhaps the resources\nfor addressing this worry are to be found in what is now widely seen\nas the main rival to the traditional kenotic theory: Thomas\nV. Morris's “two minds view.” \n\nMorris (1986) develops the two minds view in two steps, one defensive, the \nother constructive. First, Morris claims that the incoherence charge \nagainst the incarnation rests on a mistake. The critic assumes that, \nfor example, humans are essentially non-omniscient. But what are the \ngrounds for this assertion? Unless we think that we have some special\ndirect insight into the essential properties of human nature, our \ngrounds are that all of the human beings we have encountered have \nthat property. But this merely suffices to show that the property is \ncommon to humans, not that it is essential. As Morris points out, it \nmay be universally true that all human beings, for example, were born\nwithin ten miles of the surface of the earth, but this does not mean \nthat this is an essential property of human beings. An offspring of \nhuman parents born on the international space station would still be \nhuman. If this is right, the defender of the incarnation can reject \nthe critic's characterization of human nature, and thereby eliminate \nthe conflict between divine attributes and human nature so \ncharacterized. \n\nThis merely provides a way to fend off the critic, however, without \nsupplying any positive model for how the incarnation should be \nunderstood. In the second step, then, Morris proposes that we think \nabout the incarnation as the realization of one person with two \nminds: a human mind and a divine mind. If possession of a human mind \nand body is sufficient for something's being human, then \n“merging” the divine mind with a human mind and \nconjoining both to a human body will yield one person with two \nnatures. During his earthly life, Morris proposes, Jesus Christ had \ntwo minds, with consciousness centered in the human mind. This human \nmind had partial access to the contents of the divine mind, while God\nthe Son's divine mind had full access to the corresponding human \nmind. \n\nThe chief difficulty this view faces concerns the threat of\nNestorianism (the view, formally condemned by the Church, that there\nare two persons in the incarnate Christ).  It is natural simply to\nidentify persons with minds—or, at the very least, to assume\nthat the number of minds equals the number of persons.  If we go with\nsuch very natural assumptions, however, the two minds view leads\ndirectly to the view that the incarnation gives us two persons,\ncontrary to orthodoxy. Moreover, one might wonder whether taking the\ntwo minds model seriously leads us to the view that Christ suffers\nfrom something like multiple personality disorder.  In response to\nboth objections, however, one might note that contemporary psychology\nseems to provide resources which support the viability of the two\nminds model. As Morris points out elsewhere, the human mind is\nsometimes characterized as a system of somewhat autonomous\nsubsystems. The normal human mind, for example, includes (on these\ncharacterizations) both a conscious mind (the seat of awareness) and\nan unconscious mind. It does not really matter for present purposes\nwhether this psychological story is correct; the point is\njust that it seems coherent, and seems neither to involve multiple\npersonality nor to imply that what seems to be a single subject is, in\nreality, two distinct persons.  Morris proposes, then, that similar\nsorts of relations can be supposed to obtain between the divine and\nhuman mind of Christ. \nTraditional Christianity maintains that human beings are subject to\ndeath and eternal separation from God as a result of their sinfulness,\nbut that they can be saved from this condition somehow as a result of\nwhat we might refer to as “the work of Jesus”, which work\nincludes at least his suffering and death on the cross, and perhaps\nalso his sinless life, resurrection, and ascension.  The so-called\n‘theories of the atonement’ are theories about how the\nwork of Jesus contributes to human salvation. \n\nFirst, a brief note about terminology.  We have used the term\n‘theories of the atonement’ here because that is the term\nmost commonly used in the philosophical literature on this topic, and\nit is a term often enough used in theology as well. But it is not a\nneutral term. Rather, it already embodies a partial theory about what\nhuman salvation involves and about what the work of Christ\naccomplishes.  In particular, it presupposes that saving human beings\nfrom death and separation from God primarily involves atoning for\nsin rather than (say) delivering human beings from some kind of\nbondage, repairing human nature, or something else. In the New\nTestament we find various terms and phrases (in addition to\n‘salvation’) used to characterize or describe what the\nwork of Jesus accomplished on behalf of humanity—e.g.,\njustification, redemption or ransom, reconciliation, deliverance from\nsin, re-creation or rebirth, the offering of an atoning sacrifice,\nabundant life, and eternal life. Obviously these terms are not all\nsynonymous; so part of the task of an overall theology of\nsalvation—a soteriology—is to sort out the relations among\nthese various terms and phrases (is salvation simply to be identified\nwith eternal life, for example?), to determine which are to be taken\nliterally and which are mere metaphors, and to explain which\neffects have been brought about by Jesus' life, which by his death,\nwhich by his resurrection, and so on. In light of all this, some\ntheologians and philosophers deliberately avoid talking about\n‘theories of the atonement’ and talk instead about (e.g.)\n‘the theology of reconciliation’ or theories about\n‘the redemption’, etc. That said, however, we do not\nourselves intend to advocate on behalf of any particular\nterminology. Instead, we simply note the issue and move on, retaining\nthe language of ‘atonement’, but without intending to\nprejudge questions about what is primarily accomplished by the work of\nChrist. \nIn what follows, we shall discuss only three of the most well-known\nand widely discussed theories (or families of theories) about what the\nwork of Jesus accomplishes on behalf of human beings. All take the\nsuffering and death of Jesus to be an integral part of his work on our\nbehalf; but the first theory holds Jesus' resurrection and ascension\nalso to be absolutely central to that work, and the second theory\nholds his sinless life to be of near-equal importance.  Discussing\nthese theories under three separate headings as we do below may foster\nthe illusion that what we have are three mutually exclusive\nviews, each marking off a wholly distinct camp in the history of\nsoteriological theorizing, and each aiming to provide a full\naccounting of what Jesus' work contributes to human salvation from\ndeath and separation from God.  As we have already indicated, however,\na variety of terms and images are used in the Bible to characterize\nwhat Jesus accomplished and, in contrast with the doctrines of the\ntrinity and incarnation, we do not have for the doctrine of salvation\nan ecumenical conciliar prononouncement (i.e., a pronouncement from a\nChurch Council whose authority will be recognized by the Roman\nCatholic, Orthodox, and Protestant churches alike) that tells us how\nexactly we are to understand the images and events that are generally\nassociated with salvation. Consequently, it is no surprise that many\nthinkers appropriate imagery from more than one of the theories\ndescribed below (or others besides) to explain their understanding of\nthe nature and efficacy of Jesus' work. \n\nThe ransom theory, also known as the Christus Victor theory\nis generally regarded as the dominant theory of the Patristic period, and has been attributed to such early Church Fathers as Origen, Athanasius, and especially Gregory of Nyssa. (One might question, however, whether any of these theologians ever intended to offer the ransom story about to be described as a theory of the atonement, rather than simply an extended metaphor. What does seem clear, however, is that they at least intended to emphasize victory over sin, death, and so on as one of the principle salvific effects of the work of Christ.) The theory was revived more recently by Gustaf Aulén (1931), and was given popular expression in C.S. Lewis's The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.  \nThe ransom theory takes as its point of departure the idea that human beings are in a kind of bondage to sin, death, and the Devil. The basic view, familiar enough now from\nliterature and film, is that God and the Devil are in a sort of\ncompetition for souls, and the rules of the competition state that\nanyone stained by sin must die and then forever exist as the Devil's\nprisoner in hell. As the view is often developed, human sin gives the\nDevil a legitimate right to the possession of human souls. Thus, much\nas God loves us and would otherwise desire for us never to die and,\nfurthermore, to enjoy life in heaven with him, the sad fact is that\nwe, by our sins, have secured a much different destiny for\nourselves. \n\nBut here is where the work of Christ is supposed to come in. According\nto the ransom view, it would be unfitting for God simply to violate\nthe pre-ordained rules of the competition and snatch our souls out of\nthe Devil's grasp. But it is not at all unfitting for God to pay the\nDevil a ransom in exchange for our freedom. Christ's death is that\nransom. By living a sinless life and then dying like a sinner, Christ\npays a price that, in the eyes of all parties to the competition,\nearns back for God the right to our souls, and thus effects a great\ntriumph over the Devil, sin, and death.   \n\nThe moral exemplar theory, pioneered by Peter Abelard, holds that the\nwork of Christ is fundamentally aimed at bringing about moral and\nspiritual reform in the sinner—a kind of reform that is not\nfully possible apart from Christ's work. The Son of God became\nincarnate, on this view, in order to set this example and thus provide\na necessary condition for the moral reform that is, in turn, necessary\nfor the full restoration of the relationship between creature and\nCreator.  On this picture, Jesus' sinless life is as much a part of\nhis soteriologically relevant work as his suffering and death on the\ncross. \nThus far, it may sound as if the exemplar theory says\nthat all there is to the efficacy of Jesus' life and death\nfor salvation is the provision of a fine example for us to imitate.\nAccording to Philip L. Quinn (1993), however, to present the theory\nthis way is simply to caricature it.  According to Quinn, the dominant\nmotif in Abelard's exemplar theory is one according to which human\nmoral character is, in a very robust sense transformed by\nChrist's love.  He writes:  \nIn Quinn's hands, then, the exemplar theory is one according to which\nthe life and death of Christ do indeed provide an example for us to\nimitate--and an example that plays an important role in effecting the\ntransformation that will make us fit for fellowship with God.  But, in\ncontrast to the usual caricature of that theory, the exemplary nature\nof Christ's love does not exhaust its transformative power. \n\nSatisfaction theories start from the idea that human sin constitutes a\ngrave offense against God, the magnitude of which renders forgiveness\nand reconciliation morally impossible unless something is done either\nto satisfy the demands of justice or to compensate God for the wrong\ndone to him. These theories go on to note that human beings are\nabsolutely incapable on their own of compensating God for the wrong\nthey have done to him, and that the only way for them to satisfy the\ndemands of justice is to suffer death and eternal separation from\nGod. Thus, in order to avoid this fate, they are in dire need of\nhelp. Christ, through his death (and, on some versions, through his\nsinless life as well) has provided that help. The different versions\nof the satisfaction theory are differentiated by their claims about\nwhat sort of help the work of Christ has provided. Here we'll discuss\nthree versions: St. Anselm's debt-cancellation theory, the\npenal substitution theory defended by John Calvin and many others in\nthe reformed tradition, and the penitential substitution\ntheory, attributed to Thomas Aquinas and defended most recently by\nEleonore Stump and Richard Swinburne. \n\nAccording to Anselm, our sin puts us in a kind of debt toward God. As\nour creator, God is entitled to our submission and obedience. By \nsinning, we therefore fail to give God something that we owe him. \nThus, we deserve to be punished until we do give God what we\nowe him. Indeed, on Anselm's view, not only is it just for God to \npunish us; it is, other things being equal, unfitting for him \nnot to punish us. For as long as we are not giving God his \ndue, we are dishonoring him; and the dishonoring of God is maximally \nintolerable. By allowing us to get away with dishonoring him, then, \nGod would be tolerating what is maximally intolerable. Moreover,\nhe would be behaving in a way that leaves sinners and the sinless in \nsubstantially the same position before him, which, Anselm thinks, is \nunseemly. But, of course, once we have sinned, it is impossible for \nus to give God the perfect life that we owe him. So we are left in \nthe position of a debtor who cannot, under any circumstances, repay \nhis own debt and is therefore stuck in debtor's prison for the \nremainder of his existence. \n\nBy living a sinless life, however, Christ was in a different position \nbefore God. He was the one human being who gave God what God was \nowed. Thus, he deserved no punishment; he did not even deserve \ndeath. And yet he submitted to death anyway for the sake of obeying \nGod. In doing this, he gave God more than he owed God; and \nso, on Anselm's view, put God in the position of owing him \nsomething. According to Anselm, just as it would be unfitting for God\nnot to punish us, so too it would be unfitting for God not to \nreward Jesus. But Jesus, as God incarnate, has already at \nhis disposal everything he could possibly need or desire. So what \nreward could possibly be given to him? None, of course. But, Anselm \nargues, the reward can be transferred; and, under the circumstances, \nit would be unfitting for God not to transfer it. Thus, the reward \nthat Jesus claims is the cancellation of the collective debt of his \nfriends. This allows God to pay what he owes, and it allows him to \nsuffer no dishonor in failing to collect what is due him from us. \n\nAs should be clear, the notion of substitution isn't really a\npart of Anselm's theory of the atonement. (Contrary to the more common\nview in the liteature, Richard Cross (2001) doesn't even\ntake satisfaction to be part of Anselm's theory. Instead, he\ncharacterizes Anselm's view as a ‘merit’ theory. Perhaps\nhe is right—the question seems to turn on whether part of what\nGod the Father receives in the overall transaction with Jesus is a\nkind of compensation for the harm done by human sin.  Many take the\nanswer to be ‘yes’, and we shall not dispute that\nhere.) \nNevertheless, substitution is a central part of other satisfaction\ntheories. Thus, consider the penal substitution theory. According to\nthis theory, the just punishment for sin is death and separation from\nGod. Moreover, on this view, though God strongly desires for us not to\nreceive this punishment it would be unfitting for God simply to waive\nour punishment. But, as in the case of monetary fines, the punishment\ncan be paid by a willing substitute. Thus, out of love for us, God the\nFather sent the willing Son to be our substitute and to satisfy the\ndemands of justice on our behalf. \n\nRichard Swinburne's (1988, 1989) version of the satisfaction theory\nalso includes a substitutionary element. (See also Stump 1988. The\nviews defended by Stump and Swinburne are quite similar, and both\nattribute the same basic view to Aquinas. Here we focus on Swinburne's\ndevelopment of the view.)  According to Swinburne, in human\nrelationships, the process of making atonement for one's sin has four\nparts: apology, repentance, reparation (where possible), and (in case\nof serious wrongs) penance. Thus, suppose you angrily throw a brick\nthrough the window of a friend's house. Later, you come to seek\nforgiveness. In order to receive forgiveness, you will surely have to\napologize and repent—i.e., you will have to show regret and some\nsort of change of attitude toward your past behavior. You ought also\nto agree to fix the broken window. Depending on the circumstance,\nhowever, even this might not be enough. It might be that, in addition\nto apologizing, repenting, and making reparations, you ought to do\nsomething further to show that you are quite serious about your\napology and repentance. Perhaps, for example, you will send flowers\nevery day for a week; perhaps you will stand outside your friend's\nwindow with a portable stereo playing a meaningful song; perhaps you\nwill offer some other sort of gift or sacrifice.  This something\nfurther is penance. Importantly, penance isn't punishment:\nit's not a bit of suffering that you deserve to have inflicted upon\nyou by someone else for the purpose of retribution, rehabilitation,\ndeterrence, or compensation. Rather, it's a bit of suffering that you\nvoluntarily undergo or a sacrifice that you voluntarily make in order\nto repair your relationship with someone. \n\nAccording to Swinburne, the same four components are involved in our \nreconciliation with God. Apology and repentance we can do on our own,\nbut reparation and penance we cannot. We owe God a life of perfect \nobedience. By sinning we have made it impossible for God to get that \nfrom us. If, upon apologizing to God and repenting of our sins we \nwere thereafter to live a life of perfect obedience, we would only be\ngiving God what we already owe him; we would not thereby be giving \nback to him anything that we have taken away. Thus, our very best \nefforts would not suffice even to make reparations for what we have \ndone. There is nothing we can give God to compsensate him for his \nloss, and there is no extra gift we can give or extra sacrifice we \ncan make in order to do penance. \n\nAccording to Swinburne, it would be unfitting for God simply to \noverlook our sins, ignoring the need for reparation and penance. It \nwould also be unfitting for God to leave us in the helpless situation\nof being unable to reconcile ourselves to him. Thus, on his view, God\nsent Christ to earth so that Christ might willingly offer his own \nsinless life and death as restitution and penance for the sin of the \nworld. In this way, then, God helps us to make restitution and \npenance. We must apologize and repent on our own; we must also \nrecognize our own helplessness to make up for what we have done. But \nthen we can look to the life and death of Christ and offer that up to\nGod on our own behalf as reparation and penance. \n\nAlthough the Christus Victor theory is of historical importance and\nhas exerted a great deal of literary influence, it has been widely\nrejected since the middle ages, in no small part because it is hard to\ntake seriously the idea that God might be in competition with or have\nobligations toward another being (much less a being like the Devil) in\nthe ways described above. Critics object to the idea, which is\ntypically part of this view, that salvation involves a sort\nof transaction between God and the Devil; they object to the\nidea, present particularly in Gregory of Nyssa's version of the view,\nthat Christ's victory over the Devil comes partly through divine\ndeception (with Christ's divinity being hidden from the Devil until\nafter Christ's death, when he triumphantly rises from the grave); and\nthey sometimes also object to the reification and personification of\nthe forces of sin, death, and evil.  For this reason, the Abelardian\nand Anselmian views have been far and away the more popular theories\nfor the past millenium.  But each of these remaining theories faces\nits share of difficulties as well. \n\nPenal substitutionary theories, for example, maintain that it is\nmorally impossible for God simply to forgive our sins without exacting\nreparation or punishment. Some have argued that this entails that God\ndoes not forgive sin at all. (Stump, 1988: 61–5) Forgiveness involves\na refusal to demand full reparation and a willingness to let an\noffense go without punishment. Moreover, the penal substitution theory\nfaces the challenge of explaining how it could possibly be just to\nallow a substitute to bear someone else's punishment. As David Lewis\n(1997) notes, we do allow for penal substitution in the case of\nserious fines. But the idea of allowing a substitute to bear someone\nelse's death sentence (or similarly serious punishment)\nseems, on the face of it, to be morally repugnant. Indeed, the penal\nsubstitution model is seen by critics to be morally offensive on\nmultiple counts. Objectors claim that at the heart of the model is the\nimage of a wrathful deity who can be appeased by violent and bloody\nsacrifice, and who has made the violent death of his own incarnate Son\nthe necessary condition for showing love and forgiveness to his human\ncreatures. (Cf. Finlan 2005, 2007) On this score, Swinburne's theory\nof penitential substitution is on somewhat surer footing; but\none problem with Swinburne's view is that it is hard, ultimately, to\nsee what it would even mean to offer up another person's life and\ndeath as one's own reparation or penance. \n\nThe Anselmian version of the satisfaction theory does not quite\nencounter these difficulties. But, together with the moral exemplar\ntheory and various other versions of the satisfaction theory, it faces\na different sort of problem. Both views seem unable to account for the\nBiblical emphasis on the necessity of Christ's passion to remedy the\nproblems brought forth by sin. It is hard to see why Christ's death\nplays any essential role in establishing him as moral\nexemplar. Further, it is hard to see why it would be needed in order\nfor him to merit the sort of reward that Anselm thinks the Father owes\nhim. Given that Christ is a man, he owes it to the Father to live a\nsinless life; but why isn't the incarnation itself sufficiently\nsupererogatory to merit the debt-cancelling reward? Moreover, even if\nwe can discover some reason why Christ's death would be necessary\nunder these theories, it is hard to see why it would have to involve\nsuch horrible suffering. For purposes of meriting a reward or for\nserving as an exemplar, why would it not suffice for Christ to dwell\namong us, live a perfect human life resisting all earthly temptation,\nand then die a quiet death at home? Indeed, these theories seem unable\nto account even for the value in Christ's passion, much less its\nnecessity. There are, of course, responses to these objections in the\nliterature; and each of the theories just discussed has had able and\nprominent defenders within the past century.  Moreover, insofar as\nthere is no well-developed and formally recognized orthodoxy with\nrespect to these matters, those who remain unsatisfied with the\ntheories just described have populated the literature with a variety\nof alternative stories about the salvific efficacy of the work of\nJesus.  Thus, even more than the other two theological loci we have\ndiscussed in this article, the doctrine of salvation seems ripe for\nsubstantial further research."}]
