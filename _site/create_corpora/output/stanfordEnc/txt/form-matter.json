This doctrine has been dubbed\n“hylomorphism”, a portmanteau of the Greek words for\nmatter (hulê) and form (eidos or\nmorphê). Highly influential in the development of\nMedieval philosophy, Aristotle’s hylomorphism has also enjoyed\nsomething of a renaissance in contemporary metaphysics.\n\n\nWhile the basic idea of hylomorphism is easy to grasp, much remains\nunclear beneath the surface. Aristotle introduces matter and form, in\nthe Physics, to account for changes in the natural world,\nwhere he is particularly interested in explaining how substances come\ninto existence even though, as he maintains, there is no generation\nex nihilo, that is that nothing comes from nothing. In this\nconnection, he develops a general hylomorphic framework, which he then\nextends by putting it to work in a variety of contexts. For example,\nhe deploys it in his Metaphysics, where he argues that form\nis what unifies some matter into a single object, the compound of the\ntwo; he appeals to it in his De Anima, by treating soul and\nbody as a special case of form and matter and by analyzing perception\nas the reception of form without matter; and he suggests in the\nPolitics that a constitution is the form of a polis\nand the citizens its matter, partly on the grounds that the\nconstitution serves to unify the body politic.\n\n\nHylomorphism thus finds a range of applications across\nAristotle’s corpus. This entry focuses on its genesis and\ndevelopment in the Physics and Metaphysics, in order\nto characterize and assess its fundamental features and core\ncommitments. There is in any case already a considerable controversy\nat this basic level about what Aristotle means by matter and form:\nwhat precisely they are, how they are related to one another, how\nAristotle intends to marshal arguments in support of them, and how\nbest to deal with reasonable objections to their metaphysical\nconsequences. We will begin by examining how Aristotle introduces his\ntwin notions. Then we will move on to discuss some of the most\nimportant interpretative controversies: does Aristotle believe in\nso-called “prime” matter? Does matter or form serve as the\nprinciple of individuation in his metaphysics? Do natural forms\ninclude a specification of the kind of matter that anything of that\nform has to have?\n\n\nAristotle introduces his notions of matter and form in the first book\nof his Physics, his work on natural science. Natural science\nis concerned with things that change, and Aristotle divides changes\ninto two main types: there are accidental changes, which involve\nconcrete particulars, or “substances” (ousiai) in\nAristotle’s terminology, gaining or losing a property (see\nCategories 1–5, Physics i 7). For instance,\nthe changes whereby Socrates falls in a vat of dye and turns blue, or\nputs on a few pounds from excessive feasting during the Panathenaia,\ncount as accidental changes (in the categories of quality and\nquantity, respectively). Socrates, a substance, gains the property of\nbeing blue, or the property of weighing twelve stone. The other main\nkind of change is substantial change, whereby a substance comes into,\nor passes out of, existence. For example, when Socrates dies, or is\nborn (or perhaps conceived, or somewhere in between conception and\nbirth), a substantial change has taken place. \nMatter and form are required to account for this second kind of\nchange, if it is to conform to Aristotle’s general conceptual\nanalysis of change. In any change, he contends, there must be three\nthings: (1) something which underlies and persists through the change;\n(2) a “lack”, which is one of a pair of opposites, the\nother of which is (3) a form acquired during the course of the change\n(Physics i 7, 190a13–191a22). Thus, for example, in an\naccidental change, the underlying thing is the substance which\nacquires a new accidental property. For instance, when Socrates learns\nto play the flute, he transitions from a state of being unmusical (the\nlack) to a state of musicality (the form). But for us to be able to\nsay that there is something which has changed, there must be something\nwhich remains the same throughout the change, and in this case the\nobvious candidate is Socrates, who is one and the same person\nthroughout his musical training. \nIn accidental changes there is always a substance to underlie the\nchange, but this is not true for substantial changes, since these\ninvolve the coming to be or passing away of a substance (see the\namusing remark of Irving Copi, quoted at the start of the entry on\n identity over time). \n In these cases, the thing that underlies is the matter of the\nsubstance. When someone builds a house, it is the bricks which persist\nthrough the change. They transition from a state of not being a house\nto acquire the property of being a house. Aristotle often uses the\nexample of artefacts like houses, even though he does not regard them\nas substances properly-speaking (Metaphysics vii 17,\n1041b28–30), because their matter is more straightforward to\nidentify. Nevertheless, the same analysis holds in the case of\norganisms, which are the substances proper: when an organism is\ncreated or destroyed, when an acorn becomes an oak tree, or a human\ndies, there must be some matter which persists through the change. To\nsay otherwise would be to say that things can come to be out of, or\nvanish into, nothing, and Aristotle understandably agrees with his\npredecessor Parmenides that this is impossible (Physics i 8,\n191a23–b17). Aristotle’s metaphysics takes as its starting\npoints observed phenomena, and seeks to preserve common sense beliefs\nwhere possible. We never experience anything simply appearing or\ndisappearing at random. \nThe word “form” may misleadingly suggest that what is\nacquired in a case of substantial generation is simply a shape, and\nthis impression is reinforced by some of the examples that Aristotle\nuses, especially when focusing on artefacts: plausibly the form of a\nbronze statue just is its shape. When we consider organisms, however,\nit becomes apparent that having the right shape is not sufficient to\npossess the form. A thing’s form is its definition or\nessence—what it is to be a human being, for example. A statue\nmay be human-shaped, but it is not a human, because it cannot perform\nthe functions characteristic of humans: thinking, perceiving, moving,\ndesiring, eating and growing, etc. The connection between a\nthing’s form and its function emerges in Physics ii 3,\nwhere Aristotle distinguishes his four kinds of cause: material,\nformal, efficient, and final, and suggests a special connection\nbetween the formal and final cause. \nHere one needs to proceed cautiously, however, since it is sometimes\nsaid that Aristotle’s word “cause” (aitia)\nwould be better translated as “explanation” (or\n“explanatory factor”, to avoid the implication that they\nare linguistic items, as opposed to things-in-the-world). Certainly\nmodern philosophers tend to use “cause” in a narrower way,\nwhich approximates to Aristotle’s efficient cause.\nAristotle’s idea is that there are four kinds of thing that need\nto be mentioned in order to give a full account of the nature of an\nobject, each corresponding to a particular kind of question. We need\nto know what the thing is made of, and the answer to this question is\nthe thing’s matter—bricks, in the case of a house; bodily\norgans in the case of a human being. Next we need to know what the\nthing is, or how it is defined, and the answer to this is the\nthing’s form or essence. We also need to know what made the\nthing come into existence, who or what created it, and this is the\nthing’s efficient or “moving” cause. Lastly, we need\nto know what the thing is for, what its purpose or function\nis—the final cause. Now Aristotle observes that, although these\nare all distinct questions, in the case of the last three very often\nthe same thing will serve as the answer to all of them\n(Physics ii 7, 198a24–27). A house is defined as a\nshelter of a certain sort (De Anima i 1, 403b3–7;\nMetaphysics viii 3, 1043a29–36). That is what a house\nis, i.e., its formal cause, but it is also what a house is\nfor, its final cause, since houses, like all artefacts are\nfunctionally defined. Similarly, a human being is defined as something\nwhich lives a certain kind of rationally-directed life. But, on\nAristotle’s view, this is also what a human being is for. The\nhuman function is to live such a life (Nicomachean Ethics i\n7, 1097b22–1098a20; cf. De Anima ii 1, 412a6–22).\nAs for the efficient cause, it is qualitatively, although not\nnumerically, identical with the formal cause, at least in the organism\ncase, since human beings give birth to human beings, and the same goes\nfor all other living things. Thus, even though Aristotle admits four\ndifferent kinds of cause, in a sense it is only really matter and form\nthat play any ineliminable explanatory role in his system. \nIn fact, Aristotle does not simply focus on the case of artefacts\nbecause their pre-existing matter is easier to identify.\nThere is a particular issue here with the case of organisms, which\narises out of Aristotle’s insistence that a human being, for\ninstance, is composed of a rational soul, which is the form, and an\norganic body, which is the matter (for further discussion of this\nproblem, see Ackrill 1972/73). It is characteristic of the matter of\nartefacts that numerically the same stuff which makes up one object\ncan later be used as the matter of another: for instance, when one\nmelts down a bronze statue, and then molds it into some jewelry, it is\nthe same bit of bronze throughout. It is crucial that a thing’s\nmatter can survive such changes, if it is to play the role that\nAristotle needs it to play in cases of substantial generation and\ndestruction, as being the thing that underlies such changes. If an\nartefact’s matter only contingently has the form it has, the\nsame does not obviously seem true of organisms. Unlike in the case of\na house built from bricks, it does not seem as though one’s body\npredates one’s existence, and so can serve as the underlying\nthing in a case of substantial generation. One might think that at\nleast the body does exist after death, but in fact Aristotle would\ndisagree. Instead, he insists that a dead body is only\n“homonymously” called a body—that it is only\ndescribed as “a body” by extension, because it\nsuperficially resembles a living body (De Anima ii 1,\n412b10–25; Metaphysics vii 10, 1035b9–25). It is\nnot a real body, because it is incapable of performing the functions\nnormally associated with bodies, just as a statue’s eye, or an\neye in a painting, is not a real eye, because it is made of stone or\npaint, and thus cannot serve the function that genuine eyes exist\nfor—seeing (for further discussion, see the supplement to the\nentry on Aristotle’s psychology on\n a fundamental problem about hylomorphism). \nIt might seem that Aristotle is rather going against ordinary\nlinguistic usage here, since we in fact regularly do refer to dead\nbodies as “bodies”. Whether a dead body is really a body\nmight seem like a trivial linguistic issue, which can simply be\ndecided by fiat. The obvious way to resolve the problem might seem to\nbe simply to drop the insistence that the body cannot exist without\nbeing coupled to a living human soul. Allowing that a dead body\nremains the same body as its living counterpart will not help the\ndifficulty of what to say about the matter that predates the coming to\nbe of the organism, when there is no apparent body, living or dead.\nWhat is more, Aristotle is deeply committed to his position that the\nhuman body is essentially ensouled, because of his view that things\nare defined by their functions (Meteorologica iv 12,\n390a10–15; Generation of Animals ii 1,734b24–31).\nIt seems as though he believes that a human being’s matter must\nbe contingently alive, so that it can serve as the underlying thing\nthat remains when the human being comes into existence, but also that\nit must be essentially alive, because it is functionally defined. If\nso, he contradicts himself. \nThe best way to resolve this apparent contradiction in\nAristotle’s hylomorphism is to point out that an organism can\nhave more than one level of matter. Aristotle believes that all\nsensible substances can be analyzed into matter and form, but such an\nanalysis is not restricted to the things he calls substances. Matter\ncan itself be divided into matter and form: for instance, bricks are\nmade of clay, shaped into cuboid blocks. Again, clay has its own\nmatter—mud, say—and so on. Eventually, if one pursues this\nhierarchy of matter far enough downwards, Aristotle believes that one\nwill reach the four elements, earth, air, fire and water. He agrees\nwith Empedocles that everything in the sub-lunar world is ultimately\nmade up of different ratios of these four elements. Matter then should\nreally be understood as a relative notion—it is always the\nmatter of something. Aristotle distinguishes between a\nthing’s proximate matter, the stuff it is most immediately made\nof, and its less proximate matter, i.e., the matter of its matter, or\neven further down the hierarchy, culminating in its ultimate matter,\nthe elements. The organic body which is a human being’s\nproximate matter is essentially alive, but this need not apply to all\nof the other matter further down the chain. Aristotle distinguishes\nbetween homoiomerous and heteromerous parts (Parts of Animals\ni 1, 640b25–30). Homoiomerous parts are stuffs, like bronze or\nflesh, which Aristotle believes have no internal structure. Every part\nof a homoiomerous stuff is the same as every other part, containing\nthe same ratio of elements. This view of homoiomerous parts is\nconsistent with Aristotle’s denial of atomism; he believes that\nmatter, as well as space and time, are infinitely divisible. The\nbodily organs, hands, feet, eyes, hearts, etc., are heteromerous,\nsince they do have internal structure, with different parts of them\nmade up of different stuffs. A person’s hand, for instance, is\nmade of flesh, bones, blood and other such biological matter, which in\nturn are made of earth, air, fire and water. It may be that flesh too\nis functionally defined, so that dead flesh is only called\n“flesh” homonymously as well. Even if nothing biological\ncan exist when not alive, it seems clear that the elements at least\nmust be able to do so. Therefore there will be some, low-level matter\nto serve as the thing that underlies the coming to be and passing away\nof organisms, even though an organism’s proximate matter exists\nfor precisely as long as it does. \nOne obvious question pertains to how low such underlying levels might\ngo. In fact there is considerable controversy concerning how to\nconceive the bottom rung of Aristotle’s hierarchy of matter.\nAristotle believes that everything is made of earth, air, fire and\nwater. These elements are defined by their possession of one of each\nof the two fundamental pairs of opposites, hot/cold and wet/dry.\nAristotle also thinks that these elements can change into one another\n(On the Heavens iii 6, 305a14–35). If his analysis of\nchange is correct, when some water changes into some air, there must\nbe something underlying, some substrate, which persists through the\nchange, initially having the essential properties of water (being wet\nand cold, on Aristotle’s view) and then later those of air\n(being wet and hot). The thing that underlies this kind of change\ncannot be any of the elements, since it must be capable of possessing\nthe properties characteristic of each of the elements successively,\ncapable of being first cold and then hot, for example. The traditional\ninterpretation of Aristotle, which goes back as far as Augustine\n(De Genesi contra Manichaeos i 5–7) and Simplicius\n(On Aristotle’s Physics i 7), and is accepted by\nAquinas (De Principiis Naturae §13), holds that\nAristotle believes in something called “prime matter”,\nwhich is the matter of the elements, where each element is, then, a\ncompound of this matter and a form. This prime matter is usually\ndescribed as pure potentiality, just as, on the form side, the unmoved\nmovers are said by Aristotle to be pure actuality, form without any\nmatter (Metaphysics xii 6). What it means to call prime\nmatter “pure potentiality” is that it is capable of taking\non any form whatsoever, and thus is completely without any essential\nproperties of its own. It exists eternally, since, if it were capable\nof being created or destroyed, there would have to be some even lower\nmatter to underlie those changes. Because it is the matter of the\nelements, which are themselves present in all more complex bodies, it\nis omnipresent, and underlies not only elemental generation and\ndestruction, but all physical changes. As a completely indeterminate\nsubstratum, prime matter bears some similarities to what modern\nphilosophy has called a “bare particular” (see Sider\n2006), although, not being a particular, it may have more in common\nwith so-called “gunk” (see Sider 1993). \nA similar idea is to be found in Plato’s Timaeus,\n49–52, where, in addition to his Forms and the particulars which\ninstantiate them, he argues for the existence of a third category of\nthing, “a receptacle of all coming to be” (49a5–6):\n \nit must always be called by the same term. For it does not depart from\nits own character at all. It both continually receives all things, and\nhas never taken on a form similar to any of the things that enter it\nin any way. For it is laid down by nature as a recipient of\nimpressions for everything, being changed and formed variously by the\nthings that enter it, and because of them it appears different at\ndifferent times. (50b6–c4)  \nPlato also motivates his receptacle by appealing to the phenomenon of\nthe elements changing into one another, and, although he refers to it\nas “space” and not “matter”, the traditional\ninterpretation has it that, as he often does, Aristotle has adopted an\nidea first developed by his mentor. \nMore recently, opponents of attributing a doctrine of prime matter to\nAristotle have complained that there is insufficient evidence for his\nholding this kind of view, and that it is so philosophically\nunappealing that principles of charity militate against it as an\ninterpretation. Such scholars point out that Aristotle actually\ncriticizes Plato’s account from the Timaeus, in On\nGeneration and Corruption ii 1:  \nwhat Plato has written in the Timaeus is not based on any\nprecisely-articulated conception. For he has not stated clearly\nwhether his “Omnirecipient” exists in separation from the\nelements; nor does he make any use of it. (329a13–15)  \nAlthough Aristotle is clearly criticizing Plato here, it may be that\nhis point is simply that Plato was not sufficiently clear that prime\nmatter is never to be found existing apart from the elements, and that\nhe did not give good enough reasons for its introduction, not that he\nwas wrong to believe in it. \nIn this connection it is appropriate to note that Aristotle does in\nfact use the expressions “prime matter”\n(prôtê hulê) and “primary underlying\nthing” (prôton hupokeimenon) several times:\nPhysics i 9, 192a31, ii 1, 193a10 and 193a29;\nMetaphysics v 4, 1014b32 and 1015a7–10, v 6,\n1017a5–6, viii 4, 1044a23, ix 7, 1049a24–7; Generation\nof Animals i 20, 729a32. The mere fact that he uses the phrase is\ninconclusive, however, since, he makes it explicit that “prime\nmatter” can refer either to a thing’s proximate matter or\nto whatever ultimately makes it up:  \nNature is prime matter (and this in two ways, either prime in relation\nto the thing or prime in general; for example, in the case of bronze\nworks the bronze is prime in relation to them, but prime in general\nwould be perhaps water, if everything that can be melted is water).\n(1015a7–10)  \nHere Aristotle is referring to his predecessor Thales’ view that\neverything is ultimately made of water, which he in fact rejects. \nIn other passages too Aristotle seems to leave the question of whether\nor not there is prime matter deliberately open. In\nMetaphysics ix 7, he uses a conditional to talk about the\npossibility:  \nit seems that what we call not this, but that-en—for example, we\ncall the box not wood, but wooden, nor do we call the wood earth, but\nearthen, and again earth, if it is this way, we do not call something\nelse, but that-en—that is always potentially without\nqualification the next thing…But if there is something\nprimary, which is no longer called that-en with respect to something\nelse, this is prime matter. For example, if earth is airy, and air is\nnot fire but firey, fire is prime matter, being a this.\n(1049a18–22…24–27)  \nHere Aristotle uses the generic adjective “that-en”\n(ekeininon), a word that he coins, to mean made of\nthat material. If a material could not be so described, it\nwould be prime matter. Again, he shows himself aware of prime matter\nas a possibility, without wanting to commit to it here. \nAnother key passage where Aristotle has been thought to commit himself\nmore decisively to prime matter is Metaphysics vii 3. Here we\nare told:  \nBy “matter” I mean that which in itself is not called a\nsubstance nor a quantity nor anything else by which being is\ncategorized. For it is something of which each of these things is\npredicated, whose being is different from each of its predicates (for\nthe others are predicated of substance, and substance is predicated of\nmatter). Therefore this last is in itself neither substance nor\nquantity nor anything else. Nor is it the denials of any of these; for\neven denials belong to things accidentally. (1029a20–26)  \nAlthough the word “prime” does not occur here, Aristotle\nis evidently talking about prime matter. A natural way to read this\npassage is that he is saying there is a wholly indeterminate\nunderlying thing, which he calls “matter”, and it is not a\nsubstance. Those who wish to avoid attributing a doctrine of prime\nmatter to Aristotle must offer a different interpretation: that if we\nwere to make the mistake of regarding matter, as opposed to form, as\nsubstance, we would be committed (absurdly) to the existence of a\nwholly indeterminate underlying thing. \nIn addition to disputing the correct interpretation of these passages\nwhere Aristotle explicitly mentions prime matter, much of the debate\nhas centered around, on the one hand, whether what he says about\nchange really commits him to it, on the other, whether the idea is\nreally absurd. Some opponents of prime matter have argued that\nAristotle does not, after all, wish to insist that there is always\nsomething which persists through a change (see Charlton 1970,\nAppendix, and 1983). In particular, when one of the elements changes\ninto another, there is an underlying thing—the initial\nelement—but in this case it does not persist. They point out\nthat in the key passage of Physics i 7, where Aristotle gives\nhis account of change in general, he uses the expressions\n“underlying thing” and “thing that remains”.\nWhile readers have usually supposed that these terms are used\ninterchangeably to refer to the substance, in cases of accidental\nchange, and the matter in substantial changes, this assumption can be\nchallenged. In the elemental generation case, perhaps there is no\nthing that remains, just an initial elements that underlies. The worry\nabout this interpretation is whether it is consistent with\nAristotle’s belief that nothing can come to be out of nothing.\nIf there is no “thing that remains” in a case of elemental\ngeneration, how is an instance of water changing into air to be\ndistinguished from the supposedly impossible sort of change whereby\nsome water vanishes into nothing, and is instantly replaced by some\nair which has materialized out of nothing? \nThe main philosophical objections to prime matter are that it is, at\nbest, a mysterious entity that we cannot know anything about, since we\nnever perceive it directly, but only the things it underlies. Of\ncourse, there can be good theoretical reasons for believing in things\nthat we never actually see. No one has ever seen a quark, but we can\nstill know things about them, based on the kind of theoretical work\nthat they are required to perform. Still, Aristotle’s theory\nwill be more parsimonious, if he can manage without positing such\ntheoretical entities. At worst, prime matter is said to be outright\ncontradictory. It is supposed to be capable of taking on any form\nwhatsoever, and thus to have no essential properties of its own. The\nidea that it has no essential properties of its own seems to make it\ndifficult for us to characterize it positively in any way: how can it\nbe invisible, or eternal, or the ultimate bearer of properties, if\nthese are not properties that belong to it essentially? Moreover, if\nit is what ultimately underlies all properties, it seems that it must\nbe able to take on properties that are inconsistent with what we would\nlike to be able to think of as its own nature: when Socrates turns\nblue, there is also some prime matter that underlies him, which also\nturns blue. But how can prime matter be simultaneous invisible and\nblue? To get around these problems, it looks as though proponents of\nprime matter will have to distinguish between two different kinds of\nproperty that prime matter has, or perhaps two different ways in which\nit has properties. There are its essential properties, which define\nthe kind of entity that it is, and which it has permanently, and then\nthere are its accidental properties, which it gains and loses as it\nunderlies different sorts of thing. A worry about this solution is, if\none can distinguish between the prime matter and its essential\nproperties, this might suggest that there is a need for a further\nentity to act as the underlying thing for those properties, and then\nthis further entity would need to have its own nature, and something\nto underlie that nature, and so on. It seems best to try to avoid such\nan infinite regress by insisting that prime matter can underlie its\nown essential properties, without being a compound of those properties\nand some further matter. \nAnother reason that some scholars have thought that Aristotle needs\nsomething like prime matter is to serve as a so-called\n“principle of individuation”. While the predominant view\nhas been that this role is reserved for matter, other scholars have\nmaintained either that Aristotle means it to be form, or that he does\nnot see the need for a principle of individuation at all. Some of this\ncontroversy seems to have resulted from a failure to be clear about\nwhat a principle of individuation is, or what problem it is supposed\nto solve. \nTo see why this is so, one may focus on a controversy about\nindividuation which Popper sought to dissolve, by pointing out that it\nderived from a false opposition. This was a controversy begotten by a\ndisagreement between Anscombe and Lukasiewicz regarding the principle\nof individuation in Aristotle (see Anscombe et al. 1953). Popper\npoints out that their disagreement is only apparent, due to the fact\nthat they are answering different questions: Lukasiewicz insists that\nform should be counted as the “source of individuality”\nbecause it explains how a thing with many parts is a single individual\nand not a plurality, it accounts for the unity of individuals. He has\nin mind questions like “How do all these bricks constitute a\nsingle house?” or “What makes this collection of flesh and\nbones Socrates?”, and here Aristotle does indeed appear to make\nuse of form. On the other hand, Anscombe says that it is matter which\nmakes an individual the individual it is, numerically distinct from\nother individuals of the same (and other) species. Yet this is an\nissue about numerical distinctness rather than unity. It is perfectly\nconsistent to say that Socrates is one man because of his form, which\nunifies his matter into a single whole, and he is a numerically\ndistinct individual from Callias because his matter is numerically\ndistinct from Callias’ matter. \nIt has become conventional to call an answer to Lukasiewicz’s\nproblem a principle of unity, and an answer to Anscombe’s\nproblem a principle of individuation. The traditional view has been\nthat individuation is a metaphysical issue: what is it that makes one\nindividual different from another (of the same kind)? However, some\nscholars have argued that Aristotle at no point addresses this issue,\nbut is instead concerned with the epistemological question of how we\ntell one individual from another (see Charlton 1972). \nIt is worth considering why one might think that the metaphysical\nissue is not worth pursuing. The obvious reason is if one thought that\nthere was no answer to the question “what makes this individual\nnumerically distinct from that one?”—that nothing\nmakes them distinct, they just are. An advocate of this view\nmight point out that even if we accept that matter is what makes this\nindividual distinct from that one, we still have no answer to the\nquestion “what makes this portion of matter numerically distinct\nfrom that one?”. There will always be certain of these numerical\ndistinctness facts that remain unexplained on any theory. But if\nexplanation has to stop somewhere, why not stop at the beginning? Why\nnot just say that it is a bare fact that Socrates is numerically\ndistinct from Callias, and leave matter out of it? \nOne might think that one could respond to this argument by insisting\nthat there is an answer to the question what makes Socrates’\nmatter numerically distinct from Callias’ matter: it is the\nmatter itself. If matter can explain the distinctness of individual\nsubstances, why should it not also explain its own distinctness from\nother matter? Whether or not this move is legitimate will depend on\nwhich facts are and which facts are not in need of explanation but may\ncorrectly be assumed to be primitive. The problem is that “this\nmatter is distinct from that matter because it is this matter”\nseems to be a very similar sort of explanation to “Socrates is\ndistinct from Callias because he is Socrates”—both are\ncases of x explaining its own distinctness from y.\nEither both should count as adequate explanations or neither should.\nBut the advocate of matter as principle of individuation adopted this\nview precisely because she found this sort of explanation\nunsatisfactory, or not an explanation at all. Therefore this response\ndoes not seem to be open to her. \nIt seems that those who are committed to there being something which\naccounts for the numerical distinctness of individuals must say that\nthere is nothing that accounts for the numerical distinctness of the\ndistinctness-makers. The only alternative would be to introduce some\nfurther thing to account for their distinctness, and\nso on; but this results in an infinite regress, which, as well as\nbeing ontologically bloated, appears to be vicious, since we can never\ngrasp the full account of what makes Socrates and Callias distinct.\nBoth sides agree that explanation must stop somewhere, but they differ\nover where it is appropriate to stop: is it a basic, inexplicable fact\nthat Socrates is numerically distinct from Callias, or that their\nmatter is distinct? (See Markosian 2008, §8, for a contemporary\ndiscussion of this question.) At any rate, even if it is difficult to\nprove that there is an important metaphysical question here, the\ntraditional interpretation of Aristotle is that he thinks there\nis. \nThere are two main texts which have been thought to show Aristotle\nadvancing the view that matter is the principle of individuation:\nMetaphysics v 6, 1016b31–2, and vii 8, 1034a5–8.\nIn the first of these, we are told:  \nMoreover, some things are one in number, some in form, some in genus,\nsome by analogy; in number those whose matter is one…  \nAccording to the traditional interpretation, here we have the claim\nthat x and y are numerically identical (or “one in\nnumber”) if, and only if, they have the same matter (or the\nmatter of x is “one” with the matter of y).\nAn alternative reading takes this passage to be about unity rather\nthan individuation: Aristotle would be saying that x is\nnumerically one if and only if x’s matter is one, where a\nthing’s matter being “one” means that it is one\ncontinuous piece (of bone, for example). \nThe second important passage for detecting Aristotle’s views\nabout individuation comes at vii 8, 1034a5–8:  \nAnd when we have the whole, a form of such a kind in this flesh and in\nthese bones, this is Callias or Socrates; and they are different in\nvirtue of their matter (for that is different), but the same in form,\nfor their form is indivisible.  \nAccording to the traditional interpretation, these lines are saying\nthat Socrates and Callias are numerically distinct because of their\nmatter, not their form, and on the face of it this is the clearest\nexample of Aristotle affirming that matter is the principle of\nindividuation. We can adopt an alternative reading, however, if we\nsuppose that “different” means not numerically distinct,\nbut qualitatively different. In that case, the passage could be making\nan epistemological claim about how we discern Socrates and Callias:\nsuppose Callias is pale and Socrates dark; they are different, but not\ndifferent in form; they differ because of their matter, since pallor\nand darkness primarily qualify their skin, i.e., part of their\nbody. \nThere is a difficulty for the idea that matter can act as the\nprinciple of individuation, which arises out of the following problem\nthat can be raised for Aristotle’s hylomorphism (see Fine 1994).\nIt seems that two substances, e.g., Socrates and Callias, may have\nnumerically the same matter at different times; that it is possible\n(however unlikely) for all and only the particular elements that now\ncompose Socrates to end up composing Callias at some later date. In\nsuch a case, Socrates and Callias would have the same matter, albeit\nat different times. Moreover, both being human beings, they would have\nthe same form. But they themselves are compounds of matter and form,\nso if their matter and form are numerically the same, they must\nthemselves be numerically the same. \nPut schematically, the argument looks like this: \nOf course two different people cannot be numerically the same. So, if\nthe argument is valid, at least one of its premises must be false. \nOne possible rejoinder to this argument is that it turns on an\nequivocation in the meaning of “matter”. As we have seen,\nfor Aristotle matter comes in different levels. In the situation\nenvisaged Socrates and Callias would have the same remote or low-level\nmatter (the same elements) but they might still have different\nproximate matter, since the proximate matter of a human being is his\nbody. Since a substance is a compound of a substantial form and some\nproximate matter, we are not entitled to conclude that\nSocrates and Callias are the same. Although this may be an effective\nway of dealing with the initial problem, it can be restated so as to\navoid this objection that the argument equivocates on\n“matter”. Each level of matter is a compound of the matter\nat the level immediately below it and a form. If the proximate matter\nof two things is to be different, despite their lower-level matter\nbeing the same, the reason must be that the forms of the proximate\nmatters are different. We can redescribe the situation so that not\nonly are Socrates’ and Callias’ forms the same, but the\nforms of their bodies are also the same, and the forms of the matter\nof their bodies, and so on all the way down. Although it is unclear\nwhat in general is required for the matter of two things of the same\nform to have the same form, e.g., for Socrates’ and\nCallias’ bodies to have the same form, it seems reasonable to\nsuppose that it is sufficient for two things to have the same form\nthat they be qualitatively the same. So we can ensure that\nSocrates’ and Callias’ matters have the same form, if we\nsuppose that they are qualitatively the same. One might insist that no\ntwo things are qualitatively the same, but there is little reason to\nthink that Aristotle is committed to Leibniz’s doctrine of the\nidentity of indiscernibles. What is more, although strict qualitative\nidentity, i.e., having all the same non-relational and relational\nproperties, may require demanding metaphysical assumptions such as an\neternally cyclic universe, probably all that is required is that there\nbe no relevant qualitative difference between Socrates and\nCallias, where “relevant” means such as to result in them\nor their matter having different forms. While one might insist that\ntwo things must be qualitatively the same to have the same form, this\nalso does not seem to be Aristotle’s view. So if we tailor our\nexample to this requirement, we can thwart the charge of equivocation.\nThe argument then is valid, so we must choose one of its premises to\nreject. \nOne might try to reject the first premise of the argument, on the\ngrounds that a person’s matter is essential to them. We have\nseen that Aristotle plausibly does believe this about a person’s\nproximate matter—their body—since a dead body is\nonly homonymously a “body”. Nevertheless, he is committed\nto their more remote matter—the elements that make them up, for\ninstance—being capable of existing independently of them. He\nneeds there to be something to underlie the change whereby a substance\ncomes into or goes out of existence, to make it consistent with his\naccount of change in general in Physics i 7. There seems to\nbe no reason to deny that, when a tree, for instance, dies, the earth,\nair, fire and water that constituted it still exist in the dead stump.\nBut, if so, there seems no reason to think they could not leave the\nstump, and end up becoming the matter of some new tree. This is all\nthat is needed for the problem to arise. Prime matter, if it exists,\nwill not help: if the elements are allowed to escape the substances\nthat they underlie, it seems that the prime matter that underlies\nthem should also be capable of doing so. It is supposed to be\ncapable of underlying anything; so insisting that it is\nconfined to being the prime matter of a particular sort of thing makes\nno sense. \nA more promising option is to reject the second premise of the\nargument, that co-specific or relevantly similar things like Socrates\nand Callias must have a common form. This one might reject if one were\na believer in particular forms. The question of whether\nAristotle’s forms are particular or universal has garnered a\nhuge amount of scholarly attention (those in favour of particular\nforms include Sellars 1957, Frede 1978, and Irwin 1988; those in\nfavour of universal forms include Albritton 1957, Lewis 1991, and Loux\n1991). If Aristotle believed in universal forms, he could have\nconstructed particular forms out of some kind of indexed version of\nthe universal (e.g., an ordered pair of the universal form and the\nthing which had it); but that would make the identity of the\nparticular form dependent on that of the substance that had it. Since\nit is the substance’s form which is acting as principle of\nindividuation, if the common form premise is rejected, particular\nforms cannot be individuated by the substances that have them, on pain\nof circularity: what makes Socrates different from Callias is that\nthey have different forms; and what makes their forms different is\nthat one belongs to Socrates, the other to Callias. To play this role,\nparticular forms would have to be defined independently of the things\nthat have them. It would be a particular form which combines with a\nthing’s matter to make it the thing that it is. Some scholars\nfind this conception of particular forms problematic. \nA final reaction to the argument would be to reject the third premise,\nthe idea that anything enmattered is a compound of its matter and form\nat a given time. Certainly the most straightforward way of\nunderstanding hylomorphism is that the compound is compounded of the\nthing’s matter and form at a particular time, and the relation\nbetween the compound and the thing is identity. This way of\nunderstanding composition is not only problematic because it leads to\nthe problem currently under discussion: assuming that things can\nchange their matter, we might well also wonder (a) how just one of the\nmatters, which it has at a particular time, can yield the whole thing,\nand (b) how different matters at different times can yield the same\nthing. An alternative way to understand compounding would be to say\nthat a thing is the compound of its form and all the various matters\nthat it has at different times: \\(X = F(m_1, m_2, \\ldots m_n)\\), where\n\\(m_1\\ldots m_n\\) are \\(X\\)’s proximate matters in order of\ntemporal occurrence. This would solve worries (a) and (b) above, since\nnow all the different matter-slices are incorporated into the one\nobject. It does not obviously help with the problem at hand, however,\nsince, if it is possible for Socrates and Callias to have the same\nmatter at a time, there seems to be no barrier to them having exactly\nthe same sequence of matter-slices throughout their lives (provided\nthat they are not born at the same time, and live to exactly the same\nage). \nFinally, one could relativize the concept of a compound to a time:\nenmattered objects are absolutely identical to compounds, but a\ncompound is not absolutely a compound of matter and form, but only\nrelative to a particular time. \\(X = F_t(m)\\), where m is the\nproximate matter of X at t; or, combining this idea with\nthe previous one, \\(X = F_t(m_1\\ldots m_n)\\), where t is the period of\ntime for which X exists, and \\(m_1\\ldots m_n\\) are its matters\nin order of occurrence. This solution does deal with the problem\ndirectly, since Socrates and Callias can have the same form and\nmatter, and yet be different compounds because the times are\ndifferent. There may also be a modal version of the puzzle: Socrates\nis such that his matter and form could be identical with those of\nCallias at a certain time. This puzzle might be solved by also\nrelativizing compounds to worlds. \nThere is an exegetical problem with ascribing this final way of\nunderstanding composition to Aristotle, and that is that it apparently\nconflicts with the view that he expresses in Metaphysics viii\n6, 1045a7–10, and vii 17, 1041a26, that a form is what unifies a\ncompound. The problem is how to understand the role of the time in the\nunification of the compound by the form: it cannot be just another\nelement to be unified, for the time at which the matter exists does\nnot figure as a part of the resulting unity. If we try to make the\nform unify a given portion of matter into many different things,\ndepending on what time the unifying takes place at, we also run into\nthe difficulty that such a process no longer seems worthy of the title\n“unification”, since the result is many objects, not just\none. Indeed we can reformulate the problem without mentioning\ncomposition at all: if a common form must unify common matter into one\nand the same thing, and Socrates and Callias have the same form and\nthe same matter, they are one and the same. Since Aristotle (and many\nneo-Aristotelians) would surely be unwilling to give up the unifying\nrole of form, this does not look like a viable solution. \nWe have seen that there are some textual reasons to think Aristotle\nmakes matter his principle of individuation; but in fact particular\nforms are better suited to play this role. We need to distinguish\nbetween two different questions, one about unification, the other\nabout individuation: (i) what makes this giraffe (or this\ngiraffe-matter) one and the same giraffe (over time)? (ii) what makes\nthis giraffe distinct from that one? The first question seems to be\nthe one which Aristotle addresses in Metaphysics vii 17, and\ndoes not obviously require an answer that is unique to the giraffe in\nquestion. Giraffeness in general may well suffice. The answer to the\nsecond question, however, cannot be the universal species, since it is\ncommon to both giraffes, nor can it be their matter, since they could\n(albeit improbably) be composed of the numerically same stuff at\ndifferent times. It is not so obvious that Aristotle sees the need to\naddress the second question, but, if his forms are particular, not\nuniversal, he is in a good position to do so. \nAs we have seen, Aristotle introduces matter and form as contrasting\nnotions, distinct causes, which together make up every ordinary\nobject. It may come as a surprise, then, to find that he makes\ncomments which suggest that matter and form are more intimately\nintertwined than is obviously required by the manner of their\nintroduction. It is worth noting in this regard that he is eager to\ndistance himself from Plato’s theory of Forms, which exist quite\napart from the material world. He does so in part by insisting that\nhis own forms are somehow enmeshed in matter (Metaphysics vi\n1 and vii 11, and De Anima i 1). He also maintains that all\nnatural forms are like something which is snub, where something is\nsnub only if it is concavity-realized-in-a-nose (Physics ii\n2; cf. Sophistical Refutations 13 and 31). The purport seems\nto be that all natural forms are such that they are themselves somehow\nmaterial beings, or at least that one must mention matter in their\nspecification. Consequently, some scholars have been inclined to\nsuppose that a thing’s form itself contains a specification of\nthe matter which anything with that form has to have (see Balme 1984,\nCharles 2008, Peramatzis 2011). If so, rather than being contrasted\nwith matter, forms will be themselves somehow intrinsically material.\nOther scholars have been disinclined to draw this inference, not least\nbecause it seems to result in an unhappy conflation of the separate\nroles that matter and form are meant to play in Aristotle’s\nmetaphysics (see Frede 1990). \nThe passage in the Metaphysics where Aristotle most obviously\naddresses this question is vii 11. He begins the chapter by asking\n“what sorts of thing are parts of the form, and which are not,\nbut are parts of the compound” (1036a26–7). He first\ndiscusses the case of things which are realized in multiple different\nsorts of matter: a circle may be realized in bronze or stone; so it is\nclear that its matter, bronze or stone, is not part of the form of the\ncircle, since it is separate from them (1036a33–4). We are then\ntold that, in the case of things which are not seen to be separate,\nnothing prevents the same considerations from applying to them,\n“even if all the circles that had been seen were bronze”\n(1036b1). \nHaving considered the case of circles, Aristotle moves on to consider\nthe form of a man, and to ask of flesh and bones, “Are these too\nparts of the form and definition?” (1036b5). Some interpreters\nunderstand the next sentence to contain Aristotle’s answer:  \nIn truth no, they are the matter; but, because ‹the\nform› is not also in other ‹sorts of matter›, we\nare unable to separate them. (1036b5–7)  \nRendered thus, the text suggests that, as in the circle case, flesh\nand bones are not part of the form of man. However, other editors,\nespecially those friendly to matter-involving forms, print this\nsentence as a question, so that it reads  \nOr are they rather matter; but because ‹the form› is not\nalso in other ‹sorts of matter›, we are unable to\nseparate them?  \nThis second way of understanding the sentence, though it does not\nrequire it, leaves open the possibility that Aristotle’s answer\nwill be that, unlike in the circle case, flesh and bones are indeed\npart of the form of a man. Since punctuation marks are a later\ninvention, it is impossible to be certain which reading Aristotle\nintended. The sentence, as it stands, is inconclusive. \nWe might hope that Aristotle’s view about whether flesh and\nbones are part of the form of man will become clearer later in the\nchapter. Unfortunately, the relevant passage is also open to multiple\ninterpretations. The chapter goes on to describe how  \nsome people are in doubt even in the case of the circle and the\ntriangle, on the grounds that it is not right to define them in terms\nof lines and continuity, but that these too should all be spoken of in\nthe same way as flesh and bones of man and bronze and stone of statue.\n(1036b8–12)  \nPresumably these thinkers object to lines and continuity being parts\nof the definitions of circle and triangle on the grounds that they are\nmatter, comparing them to other sorts of matter that are obviously\ninadmissible in definitions. Aristotle criticizes this line of\nthought, which suggests that maybe he does think that certain sorts of\nmatter or at least matter-like concepts are admissible in definitions.\nHowever, the fact that he groups flesh and bones with bronze and stone\nas the sort of matter that is obviously inadmissible suggests that he\ndoes not think that they are parts of the form of man. \nThe impression so far is seemingly contradicted a bit later, when we\nare told:  \nAnd therefore to reduce everything in this way and to take away the\nmatter is futile: for surely some things are this ‹form›\nin this ‹matter› or these things is this state; and the\ncomparison in the case of animal, which Socrates the Younger used to\nmake, is not a good one; for it leads away from the truth, and makes\none think that it is possible for man to exist without his parts, as\nthe circle can without bronze. (1036b22–8)  \nHere Aristotle would seem to be referring back to the earlier\ncomparison between the flesh and bones of a man and the bronze or\nstone of a statue at 1036b11, and claiming that the comparison\nmisleadingly suggests that flesh and bones are not part of the form of\na man, when in fact they are. \nThat anyway is how those in favour of matter-involving forms take this\npassage, but there is another possible reading. Instead of failing to\nrealize that human beings, unlike circles, are essentially realized in\nflesh and bones, and as such these must be included in their form,\nSocrates the Younger’s mistake might have been his paying\ninsufficient attention to the fact that circles, being mathematical\nobjects, need not be instantiated in any specific kind of matter at\nall, whereas human beings always are. If this is the mistake that\nAristotle is identifying, this passage would not support any sort of\nmatter-involving forms, but only the view that natural forms, like the\nform of a man, are always instantiated in matter of certain sorts.\nEven if the forms were necessarily so instantiated, this would not\nrequire that the matter be included in the specification of the\nthing’s form. \nThere are other texts, which have been used to argue directly for the\nview that Aristotle embraces matter-involving forms: De Anima\ni 1, where Aristotle describes anger as desire for retaliation\nmanifested in boiling of the blood around the heart; or\nPhysics ii 2, where he says that natural forms are analogous\nto snubness, i.e., concavity realized in a nose. Defenders of pure\nforms can attempt to deal with these passages by distinguishing\nbetween a pure form, and a broader “definition”\n(logos, horos, horismos) which brings in\nother causes. \nAs well as purely textual arguments, several more philosophical\nmotivations have been proffered in favour of matter-involving forms.\nOne such argument relies on the fact that natural things, unlike\nmathematical ones, are subject to change. Only things with matter are\ncapable of change, and, if natural forms are to account for the\ncharacteristic changes undergone by natural compounds, the claim is\nthat they must themselves be matter-involving. For example, the\nproperty of falling downwards when unsupported is one had by all human\nbeings. Aristotle would explain this propensity as being due to their\nbeing made of a preponderance of the heavier elements, earth and\nwater. If the form of a human being is to account for this fact,\nplausibly it will have to make mention of the material constitution of\nhuman beings that results in this sort of characteristic\nbehaviour. \nIn assessing this argument, a lot seems to depend on how extensive an\nexplanatory role can be assigned to hypothetical necessity (cf.\nPhysics ii 9). All human beings have a tendency to fall,\nnecessarily, at least in a world with laws of physics like ours.\nHowever, it is not so clear whether this characteristic sort of change\nis one which must be explained by the form or essence of a human\nbeing, as opposed to his matter. After all, there are lots of other\nsorts of thing, both living and inanimate, which share this particular\ncharacteristic. Supposing there was a characteristic sort of change\npeculiar to all and only human beings, even then it is not obvious (a)\nthat this fact has to be explained by the essence of a human being,\nand (b) that its explanation will require the essence to be\nmatter-involving. To be sure, we would like some explanation of why\nthis sort of change is peculiar to this sort of creature, but it might\nsimply be a fact about the world that anything with an essence of this\nsort has to change in this sort of way, without that change being\nsomething that is specified within the essence itself. \nIn this connection it is important to notice that Aristotle recognizes\nthe existence of idia, that is of properties that apply to\nall and only instances of a given species, which an instance of that\nspecies has necessarily, but which are not part of its essence: e.g.,\nall and only human beings are capable of laughter (cf.\nCategories 5, 3a21, 4a10; Topics i 5,\n102a18–30, and v 5, 134a5–135b6). The essence of a human\nbeing is rationality, and the fact that we all (apparently) have a\nsense of humour follows from the essence together with how the world\nis. Many characteristic changes of organisms may be best explained in\na similar way: all ducks waddle, but waddling is not part of their\nfunction. Rather anything that fulfils the functional requirements of\na duck must (in a world like ours) walk inelegantly. \nThe question of whether or not Aristotelian forms are\n“essentially matter-involving” is further complicated by\nsome unclarity about what this description precisely amounts to. In\nparticular, it is unclear whether it is supposed to be a thing’s\nform, which is also its essence, which is matter-involving, or the\nessence of the form (or both). Aristotle identifies a thing’s\nform with its essence at Metaphysics vii 7, 1032b1–2:\n“by form I mean the essence of each thing and\n‹its› primary substance”. (He makes the same\nidentity claim at vii 10, 1035b32, cf. also viii 4, 1044a36.) With\nthis in mind, we can divide the possible views about matter-involving\nforms into the following four positions, with ascending degrees of\nmatter-involvement: \nA serious objection to position (4) is that it apparently leads to a\nvicious infinite regress: if a compound’s essence or form is\nitself a compound of matter and form, and this second form has an\nessence or form which is also a hylomorphic compound, etc., every\ncompound will have an infinite series of essences or forms associated\nwith it. Socrates is (essentially) a compound of matter and form, so\nis his form, so is its form, etc. Note that this regress only applies\nif all forms are held to be matter-involving. It does not afflict the\nmore moderate matter-involving position, (2), since it holds that the\nform of the compound is matter-involving, and hence has both material\nand formal parts, but that this second form, the form of the form, is\npure, and has itself as a form, e.g., the form of a computer may be\ncomputing functions in certain suitable matter, but the formal part of\nthat form (computing functions) would be pure. The regress is not\nmerely unattractively bloated and otiose. If a full explanation of\nwhat something is requires one to list an infinite series of forms,\nsuch explanations will not be viable for finite beings like us. \nA different way to avoid the regress which plagues (4) would be to\ndeny the assumption that anything that is matter-involving must be a\ncompound of matter and form. Form is matter-involving, but that is not\nto say that it has its own form or essence and its own matter. Form\nand matter are introduced to explain certain facts about ordinary\nobjects of perception, such as this man or this horse. Once those\nfacts have been accounted for, there is no need to look for the same\nexplanations of the theoretical entities which have been introduced to\nprovide the original explanation. This way out of the regress involves\ndenying that forms have essences, i.e., it reverts to position (3).\nThis position faces a number of textual obstacles. For instance, at\nthe beginning of De Anima i 1, Aristotle announces that\n“our aim is to grasp and understand [the soul’s] nature\nand essence, and secondly its properties” (402a7–8). In\nMetaphysics vii 11, he refers to the account (logos)\nof the essence (1037a22–3), and claims that “the account\nof the soul is [the account] of the man” (1037a28–9) (cf.\nalso Physics ii 2, 194a13). For these textual reasons it\nwould be preferable for a proponent of (3) to be able to say that\nforms do have essences or definitions in a sense, but they are\nidentical with these (as snubness = concavity in a nose). Their\nessences are not some further thing, distinct from them. \nThe difficulty with this is that it is not clear that the defender of\n(3) can claim that forms have definitions of any sort and still\nmaintain a doctrine that is distinct from both (2), on the one hand,\nand (4) on the other. Given that forms are definitions, they must have\na structure that approximates to that of a linguistic entity. Whatever\nelse one says about them then, it seems clear that they must be\ndivisible (in thought) into component parts, as complex predicates are\ndivisible into words. We may ask of these component parts whether or\nnot they are matter-involving, i.e., the question which the proponent\nof (3) answers in the affirmative with respect to the form or essence\nof the compound—does it have parts which correspond to material\nterms like “flesh” or “hand” or\n“matter”? If some parts of the form’s definition are\nmatter-involving, and others are not, this seems to make the\ndefinition in some sense a compound of material and formal parts. We\ncan then identify the formal parts, and ask if there is a definition\nof them, and, if the answer is “yes, a matter-involving\none”, we are stuck once again with the regress which afflicted\n(4). On the other hand, if no part of the form’s definition is\nmatter-involving, the proponent of (3) must hold that, while compounds\nhave essences which are matter-involving, these essences have\ndefinitions which are not, and this seems to make his view intolerably\nsimilar to (2). \nIt might seem as though it does not make much difference whether\nAristotle subscribes to position (1) or (2). According to (2), every\nphysical object has two forms associated with it: a matter-involving\none, which combines with the proximate matter to make up the compound,\nand a second form or essence of this matter-involving form, which is\nnot matter-involving. On position (1), a thing has only one form,\nwhich is “pure” in the sense that it contains no matter.\nHowever, the defender of pure forms must admit that there is also a\nbroader definition of a thing, which does include its matter, as well\nas its other causes. Superficially, the only difference seems to be\nwhether or not this “definition” gets to be classified as\na form, and this might appear to be a merely verbal disagreement. In\nfact, more is at stake here: although, “definition”,\n“form” and “essence” are often treated as\nthough they were interchangeable, a definition is strictly-speaking\nsomething linguistic, whereas an essence or form may have a structure\nthat corresponds to something linguistic, but it is still a thing in\nthe world. For example, the essence or form of a human being is a\nsoul. A commitment to two essences or forms per compound substance is\nan additional metaphysical commitment in a way that a broader\nlinguistic definition of a thing that mentions both its form and its\nmatter need not be. If important theoretical work cannot be found for\nmatter-involving forms, then, pure forms are the more ontologically\nparsimonious choice. \nIn any event, one can see that Aristotle’s initial contrast\nbetween matter and form grows quickly complex once hylomorphism leaves\nthe domain of change. Although introduced as contrastive notions\nsuited to explicate change and substantial generation in the absence\nof generation ex nihilo, any easy contrast between form and\nmatter turns out to be difficult to sustain once it finds employment\nin its further applications. Even so, as Aristotle implies, and as\nmany of his followers have affirmed, hylomorphism proves no less\nelastic than explanatorily powerful across a wide range of explanatory\nroles.","contact.mail":"thomasrossainsworth@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
