Part of the philosophical task in understanding personal love\nis to distinguish the various kinds of personal love. For example, the\nway in which I love my wife is seemingly very different from the way I\nlove my mother, my child, and my friend. This task has typically\nproceeded hand-in-hand with philosophical analyses of these kinds of\npersonal love, analyses that in part respond to various puzzles about\nlove. Can love be justified? If so, how? What is the value of personal\nlove? What impact does love have on the autonomy of both the lover and\nthe beloved?\n\nIn ordinary conversations, we often say things like the following: \nHowever, what is meant by ‘love’ differs from case to\ncase. (1) may be understood as meaning merely that I like this thing\nor activity very much. In (2) the implication is typically that I find\nengaging in a certain activity or being a certain kind of person to be\na part of my identity and so what makes my life worth living; I might\njust as well say that I value these. By contrast, (3) and (4)\nseem to indicate a mode of concern that cannot be neatly assimilated\nto anything else. Thus, we might understand the sort of love at issue\nin (4) to be, roughly, a matter of caring about another person as the\nperson she is, for her own sake. (Accordingly, (3) may be understood\nas a kind of deficient mode of the sort of love we typically reserve\nfor persons.) Philosophical accounts of love have focused primarily on\nthe sort of personal love at issue in (4); such personal love\nwill be the focus here. \nEven within personal love, philosophers from the ancient Greeks on\nhave traditionally distinguished three notions that can properly be\ncalled “love”: eros, agape, and\nphilia. It will be useful to distinguish these three and say\nsomething about how contemporary discussions typically blur these\ndistinctions (sometimes intentionally so) or use them for other\npurposes. \n‘Eros’ originally meant love in the sense of a\nkind of passionate desire for an object, typically sexual passion\n(Liddell et al., 1940). Nygren (1953a,b) describes eros as\nthe “‘love of desire,’ or acquisitive love”\nand therefore as egocentric (1953b, p. 89). Soble (1989b, 1990)\nsimilarly describes eros as “selfish” and as a\nresponse to the merits of the beloved—especially the\nbeloved’s goodness or beauty. What is evident in Soble’s\ndescription of eros is a shift away from the sexual: to love\nsomething in the “erosic” sense (to use the term Soble\ncoins) is to love it in a way that, by being responsive to its merits,\nis dependent on reasons. Such an understanding of eros is\nencouraged by Plato’s discussion in the Symposium, in\nwhich Socrates understands sexual desire to be a deficient response to\nphysical beauty in particular, a response which ought to be developed\ninto a response to the beauty of a person’s soul and,\nultimately, into a response to the form, Beauty. \nSoble’s intent in understanding eros to be a\nreason-dependent sort of love is to articulate a sharp contrast with\nagape, a sort of love that does not respond to the value of\nits object. ‘Agape’ has come, primarily through\nthe Christian tradition, to mean the sort of love God has for us\npersons, as well as our love for God and, by extension, of our love\nfor each other—a kind of brotherly love. In the paradigm case of\nGod’s love for us, agape is “spontaneous and\nunmotivated,” revealing not that we merit that love but that\nGod’s nature is love (Nygren 1953b, p. 85). Rather than\nresponding to antecedent value in its object, agape instead\nis supposed to create value in its object and therefore to\ninitiate our fellowship with God (pp. 87–88). Consequently,\nBadhwar (2003, p. 58) characterizes agape as\n“independent of the loved individual’s fundamental\ncharacteristics as the particular person she is”; and Soble\n(1990, p. 5) infers that agape, in contrast to eros,\nis therefore not reason dependent but is rationally\n“incomprehensible,” admitting at best of causal or\nhistorical\n explanations.[1] \nFinally, ‘philia’ originally meant a kind of\naffectionate regard or friendly feeling towards not just one’s\nfriends but also possibly towards family members, business partners,\nand one’s country at large (Liddell et al., 1940; Cooper, 1977).\nLike eros, philia is generally (but not universally)\nunderstood to be responsive to (good) qualities in one’s\nbeloved. This similarity between eros and philia has\nled Thomas (1987) to wonder whether the only difference between\nromantic love and friendship is the sexual involvement of the\nformer—and whether that is adequate to account for the real\ndifferences we experience. The distinction between eros and\nphilia becomes harder to draw with Soble’s attempt to\ndiminish the importance of the sexual in eros (1990). \nMaintaining the distinctions among eros, agape, and\nphilia becomes even more difficult when faced with\ncontemporary theories of love (including romantic love) and\nfriendship. For, as discussed below, some theories of romantic love\nunderstand it along the lines of the agape tradition as\ncreating value in the beloved (cf.\n Section 4.2),\n and other accounts of romantic love treat sexual activity as merely\nthe expression of what otherwise looks very much like friendship. \nGiven the focus here on personal love, Christian conceptions\nof God’s love for persons (and vice versa) will be\nomitted, and the distinction between eros and philia\nwill be blurred—as it typically is in contemporary accounts.\nInstead, the focus here will be on these contemporary understandings\nof love, including romantic love, understood as an attitude\nwe take towards other\n persons.[2] \nIn providing an account of love, philosophical analyses must be\ncareful to distinguish love from other positive attitudes we take\ntowards persons, such as liking. Intuitively, love differs from such\nattitudes as liking in terms of its “depth,” and the\nproblem is to elucidate the kind of “depth” we intuitively\nfind love to have. Some analyses do this in part by providing thin\nconceptions of what liking amounts to. Thus, Singer (1991) and Brown\n(1987) understand liking to be a matter of desiring, an attitude that\nat best involves its object having only instrumental (and not\nintrinsic) value. Yet this seems inadequate: surely there are\nattitudes towards persons intermediate between having a desire with a\nperson as its object and loving the person. I can care about a person\nfor her own sake and not merely instrumentally, and yet such caring\ndoes not on its own amount to (non-deficiently) loving her, for it\nseems I can care about my dog in exactly the same way, a kind of\ncaring which is insufficiently personal for love. \nIt is more common to distinguish loving from liking via the intuition\nthat the “depth” of love is to be explained in terms of a\nnotion of identification: to love someone is somehow to\nidentify yourself with him, whereas no such notion of\nidentification is involved in liking. As Nussbaum puts it, “The\nchoice between one potential love and another can feel, and be, like a\nchoice of a way of life, a decision to dedicate oneself to these\nvalues rather than these” (1990, p. 328); liking clearly does\nnot have this sort of “depth” (see also Helm 2010; Bagley\n2015). Whether love involves some kind of identification, and if so\nexactly how to understand such identification, is a central bone of\ncontention among the various analyses of love. In particular, Whiting\n(2013) argues that the appeal to a notion of identification distorts\nour understanding of the sort of motivation love can provide, for\ntaken literally it implies that love motivates through\nself-interest rather than through the\nbeloved’s interests. Thus, Whiting argues, central to\nlove is the possibility that love takes the lover “outside\nherself”, potentially forgetting herself in being moved directly\nby the interests of the beloved. (Of course, we need not take the\nnotion of identification literally in this way: in identifying with\none’s beloved, one might have a concern for one’s beloved\nthat is analogous to one’s concern for oneself; see\nHelm 2010.) \nAnother common way to distinguish love from other personal attitudes\nis in terms of a distinctive kind of evaluation, which itself can\naccount for love’s “depth.” Again, whether love\nessentially involves a distinctive kind of evaluation, and if so how\nto make sense of that evaluation, is hotly disputed. Closely related\nto questions of evaluation are questions of justification: can we\njustify loving or continuing to love a particular person, and if so,\nhow? For those who think the justification of love is possible, it is\ncommon to understand such justification in terms of evaluation, and\nthe answers here affect various accounts’ attempts to make sense\nof the kind of constancy or commitment love seems to involve, as well\nas the sense in which love is directed at particular individuals. \nIn what follows, theories of love are tentatively and hesitantly\nclassified into four types: love as union, love as robust concern,\nlove as valuing, and love as an emotion. It should be clear, however,\nthat particular theories classified under one type sometimes also\ninclude, without contradiction, ideas central to other types. The\ntypes identified here overlap to some extent, and in some cases\nclassifying particular theories may involve excessive pigeonholing.\n(Such cases are noted below.) Part of the classificatory problem is\nthat many accounts of love are quasi-reductionistic, understanding\nlove in terms of notions like affection, evaluation, attachment, etc.,\nwhich themselves never get analyzed. Even when these accounts eschew\nexplicitly reductionistic language, very often little attempt is made\nto show how one such “aspect” of love is conceptually\nconnected to others. As a result, there is no clear and obvious way to\nclassify particular theories, let alone identify what the relevant\nclasses should be. \n\n The\n union view claims that love consists in the formation of (or the\ndesire to form) some significant kind of union, a “we.” A\ncentral task for union theorists, therefore, is to spell out just what\nsuch a “we” comes to—whether it is literally a new\nentity in the world somehow composed of the lover and the beloved, or\nwhether it is merely metaphorical. Variants of this view perhaps go\nback to Aristotle (cf. Sherman 1993) and can also be found in\nMontaigne ([E]) and Hegel (1997); contemporary proponents\ninclude Solomon (1981, 1988), Scruton (1986), Nozick (1989), Fisher\n(1990), and Delaney (1996). \nScruton, writing in particular about romantic love, claims that love\nexists “just so soon as reciprocity becomes community: that is,\njust so soon as all distinction between my interests and your\ninterests is overcome” (1986, p. 230). The idea is that the\nunion is a union of concern, so that when I act out of that concern it\nis not for my sake alone or for your sake alone but for our\nsake. Fisher (1990) holds a similar, but somewhat more moderate view,\nclaiming that love is a partial fusion of the lovers’\ncares, concerns, emotional responses, and actions. What is striking\nabout both Scruton and Fisher is the claim that love requires the\nactual union of the lovers’ concerns, for it thus\nbecomes clear that they conceive of love not so much as an attitude we\ntake towards another but as a relationship: the distinction between\nyour interests and mine genuinely disappears only when we together\ncome to have shared cares, concerns, etc., and my merely having a\ncertain attitude towards you is not enough for love. This provides\ncontent to the notion of a “we” as the (metaphorical?)\nsubject of these shared cares and concerns, and as that for whose sake\nwe act. \nSolomon (1988) offers a union view as well, though one that tries\n“to make new sense out of ‘love’ through a literal\nrather than metaphoric sense of the ‘fusion’ of two\nsouls” (p. 24, cf. Solomon 1981; however, it is unclear exactly\nwhat he means by a “soul” here and so how love can be a\n“literal” fusion of two souls). What Solomon has in mind\nis the way in which, through love, the lovers redefine their\nidentities as persons in terms of the relationship: “Love is the\nconcentration and the intensive focus of mutual definition on a single\nindividual, subjecting virtually every personal aspect of one’s\nself to this process” (1988, p. 197). The result is that lovers\ncome to share the interests, roles, virtues, and so on that constitute\nwhat formerly was two individual identities but now has become a\nshared identity, and they do so in part by each allowing the other to\nplay an important role in defining his own identity. \nNozick (1989) offers a union view that differs from those of Scruton,\nFisher, and Solomon in that Nozick thinks that what is necessary for\nlove is merely the desire to form a “we,”\ntogether with the desire that your beloved reciprocates. Nonetheless,\nhe claims that this “we” is “a new entity in the\nworld…created by a new web of relationships between [the\nlovers] which makes them no longer separate” (p. 70). In\nspelling out this web of relationships, Nozick appeals to the lovers\n“pooling” not only their well-beings, in the sense that\nthe well-being of each is tied up with that of the other, but also\ntheir autonomy, in that “each transfers some previous rights to\nmake certain decisions unilaterally into a joint pool” (p. 71).\nIn addition, Nozick claims, the lovers each acquire a new identity as\na part of the “we,” a new identity constituted by their\n(a) wanting to be perceived publicly as a couple, (b) their attending\nto their pooled well-being, and (c) their accepting a “certain\nkind of division of labor” (p. 72): \nOpponents of the union view have seized on claims like this as\nexcessive: union theorists, they claim, take too literally the\nontological commitments of this notion of a “we.” This\nleads to two specific criticisms of the union view. The first is that\nunion views do away with individual autonomy. Autonomy, it seems,\ninvolves a kind of independence on the part of the autonomous agent,\nsuch that she is in control over not only what she does but also who\nshe is, as this is constituted by her interests, values, concerns,\netc. However, union views, by doing away with a clear distinction\nbetween your interests and mine, thereby undermine this sort of\nindependence and so undermine the autonomy of the lovers. If autonomy\nis a part of the individual’s good, then, on the union view,\nlove is to this extent bad; so much the worse for the union view\n(Singer 1994; Soble 1997). Moreover, Singer (1994) argues that a\nnecessary part of having your beloved be the object of your love is\nrespect for your beloved as the particular person she is, and this\nrequires respecting her autonomy. \nUnion theorists have responded to this objection in several ways.\nNozick (1989) seems to think of a loss of autonomy in love as a\ndesirable feature of the sort of union lovers can achieve. Fisher\n(1990), somewhat more reluctantly, claims that the loss of autonomy in\nlove is an acceptable consequence of love. Yet without further\nargument these claims seem like mere bullet biting. Solomon (1988, pp.\n64ff) describes this “tension” between union and autonomy\nas “the paradox of love.” However, this a view that Soble\n(1997) derides: merely to call it a paradox, as Solomon does, is not\nto face up to the problem. \nThe second criticism involves a substantive view concerning love. Part\nof what it is to love someone, these opponents say, is to have concern\nfor him for his sake. However, union views make such concern\nunintelligible and eliminate the possibility of both selfishness and\nself-sacrifice, for by doing away with the distinction between my\ninterests and your interests they have in effect turned your interests\ninto mine and vice versa (Soble 1997; see also Blum 1980,\n1993). Some advocates of union views see this as a point in their\nfavor: we need to explain how it is I can have concern for people\nother than myself, and the union view apparently does this by\nunderstanding your interests to be part of my own. And Delaney,\nresponding to an apparent tension between our desire to be loved\nunselfishly (for fear of otherwise being exploited) and our desire to\nbe loved for reasons (which presumably are attractive to our lover and\nhence have a kind of selfish basis), says (1996, p. 346): \nThe objection, however, lies precisely in this attempt to explain my\nconcern for my beloved egoistically. As Whiting (1991, p. 10) puts it,\nsuch an attempt “strikes me as unnecessary and potentially\nobjectionable colonization”: in love, I ought to be concerned\nwith my beloved for her sake, and not because I somehow get\nsomething out of it. (This can be true whether my concern with my\nbeloved is merely instrumental to my good or whether it is partly\nconstitutive of my good.) \nAlthough Whiting’s and Soble’s criticisms here succeed\nagainst the more radical advocates of the union view, they in part\nfail to acknowledge the kernel of truth to be gleaned from the idea of\nunion. Whiting’s way of formulating the second objection in\nterms of an unnecessary egoism in part points to a way out: we persons\nare in part social creatures, and love is one profound mode of that\nsociality. Indeed, part of the point of union accounts is to make\nsense of this social dimension: to make sense of a way in which we can\nsometimes identify ourselves with others not merely in becoming\ninterdependent with them (as Singer 1994, p. 165, suggests,\nunderstanding ‘interdependence’ to be a kind of reciprocal\nbenevolence and respect) but rather in making who we are as persons be\nconstituted in part by those we love (cf., e.g., Rorty 1986/1993;\nNussbaum 1990). \n\n Along\n these lines, Friedman (1998), taking her inspiration in part from\nDelaney (1996), argues that we should understand the sort of union at\nissue in love to be a kind of federation of selves: \nGiven that on this view the lovers do not give up their individual\nidentities, there is no principled reason why the union view cannot\nmake sense of the lover’s concern for her beloved for his\n sake.[4]\n Moreover, Friedman argues, once we construe union as federation, we\ncan see that autonomy is not a zero-sum game; rather, love can both\ndirectly enhance the autonomy of each and promote the growth of\nvarious skills, like realistic and critical self-evaluation, that\nfoster autonomy. \nNonetheless, this federation model is not without its\nproblems—problems that affect other versions of the union view\nas well. For if the federation (or the “we”, as on\nNozick’s view) is understood as a third entity, we need a\nclearer account than has been given of its ontological status and how\nit comes to be. Relevant here is the literature on shared intention\nand plural subjects. Gilbert (1989, 1996, 2000) has argued that we\nshould take quite seriously the existence of a plural subject as an\nentity over and above its constituent members. Others, such as Tuomela\n(1984, 1995), Searle (1990), and Bratman (1999) are more cautious,\ntreating such talk of “us” having an intention as\nmetaphorical. \nAs this criticism of the union view indicates, many find caring about\nyour beloved for her sake to be a part of what it is to love her. The\nrobust concern view of love takes this to be the central and defining\nfeature of love (cf. Taylor 1976; Newton-Smith 1989; Soble 1990, 1997;\nLaFollette 1996; Frankfurt 1999; White 2001). As Taylor puts it: \nIn conceiving of my love for you as constituted by my concern for you\nfor your sake, the robust concern view rejects the idea, central to\nthe union view, that love is to be understood in terms of the (literal\nor metaphorical) creation of a “we”: this concern for you\nis fundamentally my concern, even if it is for your sake and\nso not\n egoistic.[5] \nAt the heart of the robust concern view is the idea that love\n“is neither affective nor cognitive. It is volitional”\n(Frankfurt 1999, p. 129). Frankfurt continues: \nThis account analyzes caring about someone for her sake as a matter of\nbeing motivated in certain ways, in part as a response to what happens\nto one’s beloved. Of course, to understand love in terms of\ndesires is not to leave other emotional responses out in the cold, for\nthese emotions should be understood as consequences of desires. Thus,\njust as I can be emotionally crushed when one of my strong desires is\ndisappointed, so too I can be emotionally crushed when things\nsimilarly go badly for my beloved. In this way Frankfurt (1999)\ntacitly, and White (2001) more explicitly, acknowledge the way in\nwhich my caring for my beloved for her sake results in my identity\nbeing transformed through her influence insofar as I become vulnerable\nto things that happen to her. \nNot all robust concern theorists seem to accept this line, however; in\nparticular, Taylor (1976) and Soble (1990) seem to have a strongly\nindividualistic conception of persons that prevents my identity being\nbound up with my beloved in this sort of way, a kind of view that may\nseem to undermine the intuitive “depth” that love seems to\nhave. (For more on this point, see Rorty 1986/1993.) In the middle is\nStump (2006), who follows Aquinas in understanding love to involve not\nonly the desire for your beloved’s well-being but also a desire\nfor a certain kind of relationship with your beloved—as a parent\nor spouse or sibling or priest or friend, for example—a\nrelationship within which you share yourself with and connect yourself\nto your\n beloved.[6] \nOne source of worry about the robust concern view is that it involves\ntoo passive an understanding of one’s beloved (Ebels-Duggan\n2008). The thought is that on the robust concern view the lover merely\ntries to discover what the beloved’s well-being consists in and\nthen acts to promote that, potentially by thwarting the\nbeloved’s own efforts when the lover thinks those efforts would\nharm her well-being. This, however, would be disrespectful and\ndemeaning, not the sort of attitude that love is. What robust concern\nviews seem to miss, Ebels-Duggan suggests, is the way love involves\ninteracting agents, each with a capacity for autonomy the recognition\nand engagement with which is an essential part of love. In response,\nadvocates of the robust concern view might point out that promoting\nsomeone’s well-being normally requires promoting her autonomy\n(though they may maintain that this need not always be true: that\npaternalism towards a beloved can sometimes be justified and\nappropriate as an expression of one’s love). Moreover, we might\nplausibly think, it is only through the exercise of one’s\nautonomy that one can define one’s own well-being as a person,\nso that a lover’s failure to respect the beloved’s\nautonomy would be a failure to promote her well-being and therefore\nnot an expression of love, contrary to what Ebels-Duggan suggests.\nConsequently, it might seem, robust concern views can counter this\nobjection by offering an enriched conception of what it is to be a\nperson and so of the well-being of persons. \nAnother source of worry is that the robust concern view offers too\nthin a conception of love. By emphasizing robust concern, this view\nunderstands other features we think characteristic of love, such as\none’s emotional responsiveness to one’s beloved, to be the\neffects of that concern rather than constituents of it. Thus\nVelleman (1999) argues that robust concern views, by understanding\nlove merely as a matter of aiming at a particular end (viz., the\nwelfare of one’s beloved), understand love to be merely\nconative. However, he claims, love can have nothing to do with\ndesires, offering as a counterexample the possibility of loving a\ntroublemaking relation whom you do not want to be with, whose well\nbeing you do not want to promote, etc. Similarly, Badhwar (2003)\nargues that such a “teleological” view of love makes it\nmysterious how “we can continue to love someone long after death\nhas taken him beyond harm or benefit” (p. 46). Moreover Badhwar\nargues, if love is essentially a desire, then it implies that we lack\nsomething; yet love does not imply this and, indeed, can be felt most\nstrongly at times when we feel our lives most complete and lacking in\nnothing. Consequently, Velleman and Badhwar conclude, love need not\ninvolve any desire or concern for the well-being of one’s\nbeloved. \nThis conclusion, however, seems too hasty, for such examples can be\naccommodated within the robust concern view. Thus, the concern for\nyour relative in Velleman’s example can be understood to be\npresent but swamped by other, more powerful desires to avoid him.\nIndeed, keeping the idea that you want to some degree to benefit him,\nan idea Velleman rejects, seems to be essential to understanding the\nconceptual tension between loving someone and not wanting to help him,\na tension Velleman does not fully acknowledge. Similarly, continued\nlove for someone who has died can be understood on the robust concern\nview as parasitic on the former love you had for him when he was still\nalive: your desires to benefit him get transformed, through your\nsubsequent understanding of the impossibility of doing so, into\n wishes.[7]\n Finally, the idea of concern for your beloved’s well-being need\nnot imply the idea that you lack something, for such concern can be\nunderstood in terms of the disposition to be vigilant for occasions\nwhen you can come to his aid and consequently to have the relevant\noccurrent desires. All of this seems fully compatible with the robust\nconcern view. \nOne might also question whether Velleman and Badhwar make proper use\nof their examples of loving your meddlesome relation or someone who\nhas died. For although we can understand these as genuine cases of\nlove, they are nonetheless deficient cases and ought\ntherefore be understood as parasitic on the standard cases. Readily to\naccommodate such deficient cases of love into a philosophical analysis\nas being on a par with paradigm cases, and to do so without some\nspecial justification, is dubious. \nNonetheless, the robust concern view as it stands does not seem\nproperly able to account for the intuitive “depth” of love\nand so does not seem properly to distinguish loving from liking.\nAlthough, as noted above, the robust concern view can begin to make\nsome sense of the way in which the lover’s identity is altered\nby the beloved, it understands this only an effect of love,\nand not as a central part of what love consists\n in.[8] \nA third kind of view of love understands love to be a distinctive mode\nof valuing a person. As the distinction between eros and\nagape in\n Section 1\n indicates, there are at least two ways to construe this in terms of\nwhether the lover values the beloved because she is valuable, or\nwhether the beloved comes to be valuable to the lover as a result of\nher loving him. The former view, which understands the lover as\nappraising the value of the beloved in loving him, is the\ntopic of\n Section 4.1,\n whereas the latter view, which understands her as bestowing\nvalue on him, will be discussed in\n Section 4.2. \nVelleman (1999, 2008) offers an appraisal view of love, understanding\nlove to be fundamentally a matter of acknowledging and responding in a\ndistinctive way to the value of the beloved. (For a very different\nappraisal view of love, see Kolodny 2003.) Understanding this more\nfully requires understanding both the kind of value of the beloved to\nwhich one responds and the distinctive kind of response to such value\nthat love is. Nonetheless, it should be clear that what makes an\naccount be an appraisal view of love is not the mere fact that love is\nunderstood to involve appraisal; many other accounts do so, and it is\ntypical of robust concern accounts, for example (cf. the quote from\nTaylor\n above,\n Section 3). Rather, appraisal views are distinctive in\nunderstanding love to consist in that appraisal. \nIn articulating the kind of value love involves, Velleman, following\nKant, distinguishes dignity from price. To have a price, as\nthe economic metaphor suggests, is to have a value that can be\ncompared to the value of other things with prices, such that it is\nintelligible to exchange without loss items of the same value. By\ncontrast, to have dignity is to have a value such that\ncomparisons of relative value become meaningless. Material goods are\nnormally understood to have prices, but we persons have dignity: no\nsubstitution of one person for another can preserve exactly the same\nvalue, for something of incomparable worth would be lost (and gained)\nin such a substitution. \nOn this Kantian view, our dignity as persons consists in our rational\nnature: our capacity both to be actuated by reasons that we\nautonomously provide ourselves in setting our own ends and to respond\nappropriately to the intrinsic values we discover in the world.\nConsequently, one important way in which we exercise our rational\nnatures is to respond with respect to the dignity of other persons (a\ndignity that consists in part in their capacity for respect):\nrespect just is the required minimal response to the dignity\nof persons. What makes a response to a person be that of respect,\nVelleman claims, still following Kant, is that it “arrests our\nself-love” and thereby prevents us from treating him as a means\nto our ends (p. 360). \nGiven this, Velleman claims that love is similarly a response to the\ndignity of persons, and as such it is the dignity of the object of our\nlove that justifies that love. However, love and respect are different\nkinds of responses to the same value. For love arrests not our\nself-love but rather \nThis means that the concern, attraction, sympathy, etc. that we\nnormally associate with love are not constituents of love but are\nrather its normal effects, and love can remain without them (as in the\ncase of the love for a meddlesome relative one cannot stand being\naround). Moreover, this provides Velleman with a clear account of the\nintuitive “depth” of love: it is essentially a response to\npersons as such, and to say that you love your dog is therefore to be\nconfused. \nOf course, we do not respond with love to the dignity of every person\nwe meet, nor are we somehow required to: love, as the disarming of our\nemotional defenses in a way that makes us especially vulnerable to\nanother, is the optional maximal response to others’ dignity.\nWhat, then, explains the selectivity of love—why I love some\npeople and not others? The answer lies in the contingent fit between\nthe way some people behaviorally express their dignity as persons and\nthe way I happen to respond to those expressions by becoming\nemotionally vulnerable to them. The right sort of fit makes someone\n“lovable” by me (1999, p. 372), and my responding with\nlove in these cases is a matter of my “really seeing” this\nperson in a way that I fail to do with others who do not fit with me\nin this way. By ‘lovable’ here Velleman seems to mean\nable to be loved, not worthy of being loved, for\nnothing Velleman says here speaks to a question about the\njustification of my loving this person rather than that. Rather, what\nhe offers is an explanation of the selectivity of my love, an\nexplanation that as a matter of fact makes my response be that of love\nrather than mere respect. \nThis understanding of the selectivity of love as something that can be\nexplained but not justified is potentially troubling. For we\nordinarily think we can justify not only my loving you rather than\nsomeone else but also and more importantly the constancy of my love:\nmy continuing to love you even as you change in certain fundamental\nways (but not others). As Delaney (1996, p. 347) puts the worry about\nconstancy: \nThe issue here is not merely that we can offer explanations of the\nselectivity of my love, of why I do not love schmucks; rather, at\nissue is the discernment of love, of loving and continuing to\nlove for good reasons as well as of ceasing to love for good reasons.\nTo have these good reasons seems to involve attributing different\nvalues to you now rather than formerly or rather than to someone else,\nyet this is precisely what Velleman denies is the case in making the\ndistinction between love and respect the way he does. \nIt is also questionable whether Velleman can even explain the\nselectivity of love in terms of the “fit” between your\nexpressions and my sensitivities. For the relevant sensitivities on my\npart are emotional sensitivities: the lowering of my emotional\ndefenses and so becoming emotionally vulnerable to you. Thus, I become\nvulnerable to the harms (or goods) that befall you and so\nsympathetically feel your pain (or joy). Such emotions are themselves\nassessable for warrant, and now we can ask why my disappointment that\nyou lost the race is warranted, but my being disappointed that a mere\nstranger lost would not be warranted. The intuitive answer is that I\nlove you but not him. However, this answer is unavailable to Velleman,\nbecause he thinks that what makes my response to your dignity that of\nlove rather than respect is precisely that I feel such emotions, and\nto appeal to my love in explaining the emotions therefore seems\nviciously circular. \nAlthough these problems are specific to Velleman’s account, the\ndifficulty can be generalized to any appraisal account of love (such\nas that offered in Kolodny 2003). For if love is an appraisal, it\nneeds to be distinguished from other forms of appraisal, including our\nevaluative judgments. On the one hand, to try to distinguish love as\nan appraisal from other appraisals in terms of love’s having\ncertain effects on our emotional and motivational life (as on\nVelleman’s account) is unsatisfying because it ignores part of\nwhat needs to be explained: why the appraisal of love has these\neffects and yet judgments with the same evaluative content do not.\nIndeed, this question is crucial if we are to understand the intuitive\n“depth” of love, for without an answer to this question we\ndo not understand why love should have the kind of centrality in our\nlives it manifestly\n does.[9]\n On the other hand, to bundle this emotional component into the\nappraisal itself would be to turn the view into either the robust\nconcern view\n (Section 3)\n or a variant of the emotion view\n (Section 5.1). \nIn contrast to Velleman, Singer (1991, 1994, 2009) understands love to\nbe fundamentally a matter of bestowing value on the beloved. To\nbestow value on another is to project a kind of intrinsic\nvalue onto him. Indeed, this fact about love is supposed to\ndistinguish love from liking: “Love is an attitude with no clear\nobjective,” whereas liking is inherently teleological (1991, p.\n272). As such, there are no standards of correctness for bestowing\nsuch value, and this is how love differs from other personal attitudes\nlike gratitude, generosity, and condescension:\n“love…confers importance no matter what the\nobject is worth” (p. 273). Consequently, Singer thinks, love is\nnot an attitude that can be justified in any way. \nWhat is it, exactly, to bestow this kind of value on someone? It is,\nSinger says, a kind of attachment and commitment to the beloved, in\nwhich one comes to treat him as an end in himself and so to respond to\nhis ends, interests, concerns, etc. as having value for their own\nsake. This means in part that the bestowal of value reveals itself\n“by caring about the needs and interests of the beloved, by\nwishing to benefit or protect her, by delighting in her\nachievements,” etc. (p. 270). This sounds very much like the\nrobust concern view, yet the bestowal view differs in understanding\nsuch robust concern to be the effect of the bestowal of value\nthat is love rather than itself what constitutes love: in bestowing\nvalue on my beloved, I make him be valuable in such a way that I ought\nto respond with robust concern. \nFor it to be intelligible that I have bestowed value on someone, I\nmust therefore respond appropriately to him as valuable, and this\nrequires having some sense of what his well-being is and of what\naffects that well-being positively or negatively. Yet having this\nsense requires in turn knowing what his strengths and deficiencies\nare, and this is a matter of appraising him in various ways. Bestowal\nthus presupposes a kind of appraisal, as a way of “really\nseeing” the beloved and attending to him. Nonetheless, Singer\nclaims, it is the bestowal that is primary for understanding what love\nconsists in: the appraisal is required only so that the commitment to\none’s beloved and his value as thus bestowed has practical\nimport and is not “a blind submission to some unknown\nbeing” (1991, p. 272; see also Singer 1994, pp. 139ff). \nSinger is walking a tightrope in trying to make room for appraisal in\nhis account of love. Insofar as the account is fundamentally a\nbestowal account, Singer claims that love cannot be justified, that we\nbestow the relevant kind of value “gratuitously.” This\nsuggests that love is blind, that it does not matter what our beloved\nis like, which seems patently false. Singer tries to avoid this\nconclusion by appealing to the role of appraisal: it is only because\nwe appraise another as having certain virtues and vices that we come\nto bestow value on him. Yet the “because” here, since it\ncannot justify the bestowal, is at best a kind of contingent causal\nexplanation.\n [10]\n In this respect, Singer’s account of the selectivity of love is\nmuch the same as Velleman’s, and it is liable to the same\ncriticism: it makes unintelligible the way in which our love can be\ndiscerning for better or worse reasons. Indeed, this failure to make\nsense of the idea that love can be justified is a problem for any\nbestowal view. For either (a) a bestowal itself cannot be justified\n(as on Singer’s account), in which case the justification of\nlove is impossible, or (b) a bestowal can be justified, in which case\nit is hard to make sense of value as being bestowed rather than there\nantecedently in the object as the grounds of that\n“bestowal.” \nMore generally, a proponent of the bestowal view needs to be much\nclearer than Singer is in articulating precisely what a bestowal is.\nWhat is the value that I create in a bestowal, and how can my bestowal\ncreate it? On a crude Humean view, the answer might be that the value\nis something projected onto the world through my pro-attitudes, like\ndesire. Yet such a view would be inadequate, since the projected\nvalue, being relative to a particular individual, would do no\ntheoretical work, and the account would essentially be a variant of\nthe robust concern view. Moreover, in providing a bestowal account of\nlove, care is needed to distinguish love from other personal attitudes\nsuch as admiration and respect: do these other attitudes involve\nbestowal? If so, how does the bestowal in these cases differ from the\nbestowal of love? If not, why not, and what is so special about love\nthat requires a fundamentally different evaluative attitude than\nadmiration and respect? \nNonetheless, there is a kernel of truth in the bestowal view: there is\nsurely something right about the idea that love is creative and not\nmerely a response to antecedent value, and accounts of love that\nunderstand the kind of evaluation implicit in love merely in terms of\nappraisal seem to be missing something. Precisely what may be missed\nwill be discussed below in\n Section 6. \nPerhaps there is room for an understanding of love and its relation to\nvalue that is intermediate between appraisal and bestowal accounts.\nAfter all, if we think of appraisal as something like perception, a\nmatter of responding to what is out there in the world, and of\nbestowal as something like action, a matter of doing something and\ncreating something, we should recognize that the responsiveness\ncentral to appraisal may itself depend on our active, creative\nchoices. Thus, just as we must recognize that ordinary perception\ndepends on our actively directing our attention and deploying\nconcepts, interpretations, and even arguments in order to perceive\nthings accurately, so too we might think our vision of our\nbeloved’s valuable properties that is love also depends on our\nactively attending to and interpreting him. Something like this is\nJollimore’s view (2011). According to Jollimore, in loving\nsomeone we actively attend to his valuable properties in a way that we\ntake to provide us with reasons to treat him preferentially. Although\nwe may acknowledge that others might have such properties even to a\ngreater degree than our beloved does, we do not attend to and\nappreciate such properties in others in the same way we do those in\nour beloveds; indeed, we find our appreciation of our beloved’s\nvaluable properties to “silence” our similar appreciation\nof those in others. (In this way, Jollimore thinks, we can solve the\nproblem of fungibility, discussed below in\n Section 6.)\n Likewise, in perceiving our beloved’s actions and character, we\ndo so through the lens of such an appreciation, which will tend as to\n“silence” interpretations inconsistent with that\nappreciation. In this way, love involves finding one’s beloved\nto be valuable in a way that involves elements of both appraisal\n(insofar as one must thereby be responsive to valuable properties\none’s beloved really has) and bestowal (insofar as through\none’s attention and committed appreciation of these properties\nthey come to have special significance for one). \nOne might object that this conception of love as silencing the special\nvalue of others or to negative interpretations of our beloveds is\nirrational in a way that love is not. For, it might seem, such\n“silencing” is merely a matter of our blinding\nourselves to how things really are. Yet Jollimore claims that this\nsense in which love is blind is not objectionable, for (a) we can\nstill intellectually recognize the things that love’s vision\nsilences, and (b) there really is no impartial perspective we can take\non the values things have, and love is one appropriate sort of partial\nperspective from which the value of persons can be manifest.\nNonetheless, one might wonder about whether that perspective of love\nitself can be distorted and what the norms are in terms of which such\ndistortions are intelligible. Furthermore, it may seem that\nJollimore’s attempt to reconcile appraisal and bestowal fails to\nappreciate the underlying metaphysical difficulty: appraisal is a\nresponse to value that is antecedently there, whereas bestowal is the\ncreation of value that was not antecedently there. Consequently, it\nmight seem, appraisal and bestowal are mutually exclusive and cannot\nbe reconciled in the way Jollimore hopes. \nWhereas Jollimore tries to combine separate elements of appraisal and\nof bestowal in a single account, Helm (2010) and Bagley (2015) offer\naccounts that reject the metaphysical presupposition that values must\nbe either prior to love (as with appraisal) or posterior to love (as\nwith bestowal), instead understanding the love and the values to\nemerge simultaneously. Thus, Helm presents a detailed account of\nvaluing in terms of the emotions, arguing that while we can understand\nindividual emotions as appraisals, responding to values\nalready their in their objects, these values are bestowed on\nthose objects via broad, holistic patterns of emotions. How this\namounts to an account of love will be discussed in\n Section 5.2,\n below. Bagley (2015) instead appeals to a metaphor of improvisation,\narguing that just as jazz musicians jointly make determinate the\ncontent of their musical ideas through on-going processes of their\nexpression, so too lovers jointly engage in “deep\nimprovisation”, thereby working out of their values and\nidentities through the on-going process of living their lives\ntogether. These values are thus something the lovers jointly construct\nthrough the process of recognizing and responding to those very\nvalues. To love someone is thus to engage with them as partners in\nsuch “deep improvisation”. (This account is similar to\nHelm (2008, 2010)’s account of plural agency, which he uses to\nprovide an account of friendship and other loving relationships; see\nthe discussion of\n shared activity\n in the entry on\n friendship.) \nGiven these problems with the accounts of love as valuing, perhaps we\nshould turn to the emotions. For emotions just are responses to\nobjects that combine evaluation, motivation, and a kind of\nphenomenology, all central features of the attitude of love. \nMany accounts of love claim that it is an emotion; these include:\nWollheim 1984, Rorty 1986/1993, Brown 1987, Hamlyn 1989, Baier 1991,\nand Badhwar\n 2003.[11]\n Thus, Hamlyn (1989, p. 219) says: \nThe difficulty with this claim, as Rorty (1980) argues, is that the\nword, ‘emotion,’ does not seem to pick out a homogeneous\ncollection of mental states, and so various theories claiming that\nlove is an emotion mean very different things. Consequently, what are\nhere labeled “emotion views” are divided into those that\nunderstand love to be a particular kind of evaluative-cum-motivational\nresponse to an object, whether that response is merely occurrent or\ndispositional (‘emotions proper,’ see\n Section 5.1,\n below), and those that understand love to involve a collection of\nrelated and interconnected emotions proper (‘emotion\ncomplexes,’ see\n Section 5.2,\n below). \nAn emotion proper is a kind of\n“evaluative-cum-motivational response to an object”; what\ndoes this mean? Emotions are generally understood to have several\nobjects. The target of an emotion is that at which the\nemotion is directed: if I am afraid or angry at you, then you are the\ntarget. In responding to you with fear or anger, I am implicitly\nevaluating you in a particular way, and this evaluation—called\nthe formal object—is the kind of evaluation of the\ntarget that is distinctive of a particular emotion type. Thus, in\nfearing you, I implicitly evaluate you as somehow dangerous, whereas\nin being angry at you I implicitly evaluate you as somehow offensive.\nYet emotions are not merely evaluations of their targets; they in part\nmotivate us to behave in certain ways, both rationally (by motivating\naction to avoid the danger) and arationally (via certain\ncharacteristic expressions, such as slamming a door out of anger).\nMoreover, emotions are generally understood to involve a\nphenomenological component, though just how to understand the\ncharacteristic “feel” of an emotion and its relation to\nthe evaluation and motivation is hotly disputed. Finally, emotions are\ntypically understood to be passions: responses that we feel imposed on\nus as if from the outside, rather than anything we actively do. (For\nmore on the philosophy of emotions, see entry on\n emotion.) \nWhat then are we saying when we say that love is an emotion proper?\nAccording to Brown (1987, p. 14), emotions as occurrent mental states\nare “abnormal bodily changes caused by the agent’s\nevaluation or appraisal of some object or situation that the agent\nbelieves to be of concern to him or her.” He spells this out by\nsaying that in love, we “cherish” the person for having\n“a particular complex of instantiated qualities” that is\n“open-ended” so that we can continue to love the person\neven as she changes over time (pp. 106–7). These qualities,\nwhich include historical and relational qualities, are evaluated in\nlove as\n worthwhile.[12]\n All of this seems aimed at spelling out what love’s formal\nobject is, a task that is fundamental to understanding love as an\nemotion proper. Thus, Brown seems to say that love’s formal\nobject is just being worthwhile (or, given his examples, perhaps:\nworthwhile as a person), and he resists being any more specific than\nthis in order to preserve the open-endedness of love. Hamlyn (1989)\noffers a similar account, saying (p. 228): \nHamlyn goes on to suggest that love and hate might be primordial\nemotions, a kind of positive or negative “feeling\ntowards,” presupposed by all other\n emotions.[13] \nThe trouble with these accounts of love as an emotion proper is that\nthey provide too thin a conception of love. In Hamlyn’s case,\nlove is conceived as a fairly generic pro-attitude, rather than as the\nspecific kind of distinctively personal attitude discussed\nhere. In Brown’s case, spelling out the formal object of love as\nsimply being worthwhile (as a person) fails to distinguish love from\nother evaluative responses like admiration and respect. Part of the\nproblem seems to be the rather simple account of what an emotion is\nthat Brown and Hamlyn use as their starting point: if love is an\nemotion, then the understanding of what an emotion is must be enriched\nconsiderably to accommodate love. Yet it is not at all clear whether\nthe idea of an “emotion proper” can be adequately enriched\nso as to do so. \nThe emotion complex view, which understands love to be a complex\nemotional attitude towards another person, may initially seem to hold\nout great promise to overcome the problems of alternative types of\nviews. By articulating the emotional interconnections between persons,\nit could offer a satisfying account of the “depth” of love\nwithout the excesses of the union view and without the overly narrow\nteleological focus of the robust concern view; and because these\nemotional interconnections are themselves evaluations, it could offer\nan understanding of love as simultaneously evaluative, without needing\nto specify a single formal object of love. However, the devil is in\nthe details. \n\n Rorty\n (1986/1993) does not try to present a complete account of love;\nrather, she focuses on the idea that “relational psychological\nattitudes” which, like love, essentially involve emotional and\ndesiderative responses, exhibit historicity: “they\narise from, and are shaped by, dynamic interactions between a subject\nand an object” (p. 73). In part this means that what makes an\nattitude be one of love is not the presence of a state that we can\npoint to at a particular time within the lover; rather, love is to be\n“identified by a characteristic narrative history” (p.\n75). Moreover, Rorty argues, the historicity of love involves the\nlover’s being permanently transformed by loving who he does. \nBaier (1991), seeming to pick up on this understanding of love as\nexhibiting historicity, says (p. 444): \nTo a certain extent, such emotional interdependence involves feeling\nsympathetic emotions, so that, for example, I feel disappointed and\nfrustrated on behalf of my beloved when she fails, and joyful when she\nsucceeds. However, Baier insists, love is “more than just the\nduplication of the emotion of each in a sympathetic echo in the\nother” (p. 442); the emotional interdependence of the lovers\ninvolves also appropriate follow-up responses to the emotional\npredicaments of your beloved. Two examples Baier gives (pp.\n443–44) are a feeling of “mischievous delight” at\nyour beloved’s temporary bafflement, and amusement at her\nembarrassment. The idea is that in a loving relationship your beloved\ngives you permission to feel such emotions when no one else is\npermitted to do so, and a condition of her granting you that\npermission is that you feel these emotions “tenderly.”\nMoreover, you ought to respond emotionally to your beloved’s\nemotional responses to you: by feeling hurt when she is indifferent to\nyou, for example. All of these foster the sort of emotional\ninterdependence Baier is after—a kind of intimacy you have with\nyour beloved. \nBadhwar (2003, p. 46) similarly understands love to be a matter of\n“one’s overall emotional orientation towards a\nperson—the complex of perceptions, thoughts, and\nfeelings”; as such, love is a matter of having a certain\n“character structure.” Central to this complex emotional\norientation, Badhwar thinks, is what she calls the “look of\nlove”: “an ongoing [emotional] affirmation of the loved\nobject as worthy of existence…for her own sake” (p. 44),\nan affirmation that involves taking pleasure in your beloved’s\nwell-being. Moreover, Badhwar claims, the look of love also provides\nto the beloved reliable testimony concerning the quality of the\nbeloved’s character and actions (p. 57). \nThere is surely something very right about the idea that love, as an\nattitude central to deeply personal relationships, should not be\nunderstood as a state that can simply come and go. Rather, as the\nemotion complex view insists, the complexity of love is to be found in\nthe historical patterns of one’s emotional responsiveness to\none’s beloved—a pattern that also projects into the\nfuture. Indeed, as suggested above, the kind of emotional\ninterdependence that results from this complex pattern can seem to\naccount for the intuitive “depth” of love as fully\ninterwoven into one’s emotional sense of oneself. And it seems\nto make some headway in understanding the complex phenomenology of\nlove: love can at times be a matter of intense pleasure in the\npresence of one’s beloved, yet it can at other times involve\nfrustration, exasperation, anger, and hurt as a manifestation of the\ncomplexities and depth of the relationships it fosters. \nThis understanding of love as constituted by a history of emotional\ninterdependence enables emotion complex views to say something\ninteresting about the impact love has on the lover’s identity.\nThis is partly Rorty’s point (1986/1993) in her discussion of\nthe historicity of love\n (above).\n Thus, she argues, one important feature of such historicity is that\nlove is “dynamically permeable” in that the lover\nis continually “changed by loving” such that these changes\n“tend to ramify through a person’s character” (p.\n77). Through such dynamic permeability, love transforms the identity\nof the lover in a way that can sometimes foster the continuity of the\nlove, as each lover continually changes in response to the changes in\nthe\n other.[14]\n Indeed, Rorty concludes, love should be understood in terms of\n“a characteristic narrative history” (p. 75) that results\nfrom such dynamic permeability. It should be clear, however, that the\nmere fact of dynamic permeability need not result in the love’s\ncontinuing: nothing about the dynamics of a relationship requires that\nthe characteristic narrative history project into the future, and such\npermeability can therefore lead to the dissolution of the love. Love\nis therefore risky—indeed, all the more risky because of the way\nthe identity of the lover is defined in part through the love. The\nloss of a love can therefore make one feel no longer oneself in ways\npoignantly described by Nussbaum (1990). \nBy focusing on such emotionally complex histories, emotion complex\nviews differ from most alternative accounts of love. For alternative\naccounts tend to view love as a kind of attitude we take toward our\nbeloveds, something we can analyze simply in terms of our mental state\nat the\n moment.[15]\n By ignoring this historical dimension of love in providing an account\nof what love is, alternative accounts have a hard time providing\neither satisfying accounts of the sense in which our identities as\nperson are at stake in loving another or satisfactory solutions to\nproblems concerning how love is to be justified (cf.\n Section 6,\n especially the discussion of\n fungibility). \nNonetheless, some questions remain. If love is to be understood as an\nemotion complex, we need a much more explicit account of the pattern\nat issue here: what ties all of these emotional responses together\ninto a single thing, namely love? Baier and Badhwar seem content to\nprovide interesting and insightful examples of this pattern, but that\ndoes not seem to be enough. For example, what connects my amusement at\nmy beloved’s embarrassment to other emotions like my joy on his\nbehalf when he succeeds? Why shouldn’t my amusement at his\nembarrassment be understood instead as a somewhat cruel case of\nschadenfreude and so as antithetical to, and disconnected\nfrom, love? Moreover, as Naar (2013) notes, we need a principled\naccount of when such historical patterns are disrupted in such a way\nas to end the love and when they are not. Do I stop loving when, in\nthe midst of clinical depression, I lose my normal pattern of\nemotional concern? \nPresumably the answer requires returning to the historicity of love:\nit all depends on the historical details of the relationship my\nbeloved and I have forged. Some loves develop so that the intimacy\nwithin the relationship is such as to allow for tender, teasing\nresponses to each other, whereas other loves may not. The historical\ndetails, together with the lovers’ understanding of their\nrelationship, presumably determine which emotional responses belong to\nthe pattern constitutive of love and which do not. However, this\nanswer so far is inadequate: not just any historical relationship\ninvolving emotional interdependence is a loving relationship, and we\nneed a principled way of distinguishing loving relationships from\nother relational evaluative attitudes: precisely what is the\ncharacteristic narrative history that is characteristic of love? \nHelm (2009, 2010) tries to answer some of these questions in\npresenting an account of love as intimate identification. To love\nanother, Helm claims, is to care about him as the particular person he\nis and so, other things being equal, to value the things he values.\nInsofar as a person’s (structured) set of values—his sense\nof the kind of life worth his living—constitutes his\nidentity as a person, such sharing of values amounts to\nsharing his identity, which sounds very much like union accounts of\nlove. However, Helm is careful to understand such sharing of values as\nfor the sake of the beloved (as robust concern accounts insist), and\nhe spells this all out in terms of patterns of emotions. Thus, Helm\nclaims, all emotions have not only a target and a formal object (as\nindicated above), but also a focus: a background object the\nsubject cares about in terms of which the implicit evaluation of the\ntarget is made intelligible. (For example, if I am afraid of the\napproaching hailstorm, I thereby evaluate it as dangerous, and what\nexplains this evaluation is the way that hailstorm bears on my\nvegetable garden, which I care about; my garden, therefore, is the\nfocus of my fear.) Moreover, emotions normally come in patterns with a\ncommon focus: fearing the hailstorm is normally connected to other\nemotions as being relieved when it passes by harmlessly (or\ndisappointed or sad when it does not), being angry at the rabbits for\nkilling the spinach, delighted at the productivity of the tomato\nplants, etc. Helm argues that a projectible pattern of such emotions\nwith a common focus constitute caring about that focus. Consequently,\nwe might say along the lines of\n Section 4.3,\n while particular emotions appraise events in the world as having\ncertain evaluative properties, their having these properties is partly\nbestowed on them by the overall patterns of emotions. \nHelm identifies some emotions as person-focused emotions:\nemotions like pride and shame that essentially take persons as their\nfocuses, for these emotions implicitly evaluate in terms of the\ntarget’s bearing on the quality of life of the person that is\ntheir focus. To exhibit a pattern of such emotions focused on oneself\nand subfocused on being a mother, for example, is to care about the\nplace being a mother has in the kind of life you find worth\nliving—in your identity as a person; to care in this way is to\nvalue being a mother as a part of your concern for your own\nidentity. Likewise, to exhibit a projectible pattern of such emotions\nfocused on someone else and subfocused on his being a father is to\nvalue this as a part of your concern for his\nidentity—to value it for his sake. Such sharing of\nanother’s values for his sake, which, Helm argues, essentially\ninvolves trust, respect, and affection, amounts to intimate\nidentification with him, and such intimate identification just is\nlove. Thus, Helm tries to provide an account of love that is grounded\nin an explicit account of caring (and caring about something for the\nsake of someone else) that makes room for the intuitive\n“depth” of love through intimate identification. \nWhy do we love? It has been suggested above that any account of love\nneeds to be able to answer some such justificatory question. Although\nthe issue of the justification of love is important on its own, it is\nalso important for the implications it has for understanding more\nclearly the precise object of love: how can we make sense of the\nintuitions not only that we love the individuals themselves rather\nthan their properties, but also that my beloved is not\nfungible—that no one could simply take her place without loss.\nDifferent theories approach these questions in different ways, but, as\nwill become clear below, the question of justification is primary. \nOne way to understand the question of why we love is as asking for\nwhat the value of love is: what do we get out of it? One kind of\nanswer, which has its roots in Aristotle, is that having loving\nrelationships promotes self-knowledge insofar as your beloved acts as\na kind of mirror, reflecting your character back to you (Badhwar,\n2003, p. 58). Of course, this answer presupposes that we cannot\naccurately know ourselves in other ways: that left alone, our sense of\nourselves will be too imperfect, too biased, to help us grow and\nmature as persons. The metaphor of a mirror also suggests that our\nbeloveds will be in the relevant respects similar to us, so that\nmerely by observing them, we can come to know ourselves better in a\nway that is, if not free from bias, at least more objective than\notherwise. \nBrink (1999, pp. 264–65) argues that there are serious limits to\nthe value of such mirroring of one’s self in a beloved. For if\nthe aim is not just to know yourself better but to improve\nyourself, you ought also to interact with others who are not just like\nyourself: interacting with such diverse others can help you recognize\nalternative possibilities for how to live and so better assess the\nrelative merits of these possibilities. Whiting (2013) also emphasizes\nthe importance of our beloveds’ having an independent voice\ncapable of reflecting not who one now is but an ideal for who one is\nto be. Nonetheless, we need not take the metaphor of the mirror quite\nso literally; rather, our beloveds can reflect our selves not through\ntheir inherent similarity to us but rather through the interpretations\nthey offer of us, both explicitly and implicitly in their responses to\nus. This is what Badhwar calls the “epistemic\nsignificance” of\n love.[16] \nIn addition to this epistemic significance of love, LaFollette (1996,\nChapter 5) offers several other reasons why it is good to love,\nreasons derived in part from the psychological literature on love:\nlove increases our sense of well-being, it elevates our sense of\nself-worth, and it serves to develop our character. It also, we might\nadd, tends to lower stress and blood pressure and to increase health\nand longevity. Friedman (1993) argues that the kind of partiality\ntowards our beloveds that love involves is itself morally\nvaluable because it supports relationships—loving\nrelationships—that contribute “to human well-being,\nintegrity, and fulfillment in life” (p. 61). And Solomon (1988,\np. 155) claims: \nThis is because, Solomon suggests, in loving someone, I want myself to\nbe better so as to be worthy of his love for me. \nEach of these answers to the question of why we love understands it to\nbe asking about love quite generally, abstracted away from details of\nparticular relationships. It is also possible to understand the\nquestion as asking about particular loves. Here, there are several\nquestions that are relevant: \nThese are importantly different questions. Velleman (1999), for\nexample, thinks we can answer (1) by appealing to the fact that my\nbeloved is a person and so has a rational nature, yet he thinks (2)\nand (3) have no answers: the best we can do is offer causal\nexplanations for our loving particular people. (Setiya (2014)\nsimilarly thinks (1) has an answer, but points not to the rational\nnature of persons but rather to the other’s humanity,\nwhere such humanity differs from personhood in that not all humans\nneed have the requisite rational nature for personhood, and not all\npersons need be humans.) And, as will become clear\n below,\n the distinction between (2) and (3) will become important in\nresolving puzzles concerning whether our beloveds are fungible, though\nit should be clear that (3) potentially raises questions concerning\n personal identity\n (which will not be addressed here). \nIt is important not to misconstrue these justificatory questions.\n Thomas (1991),\n for example, rejects the idea that love can be justified:\n“there are no rational considerations whereby anyone can lay\nclaim to another’s love or insist that an individual’s\nlove for another is irrational” (p. 474). This is because,\nThomas claims (p. 471): \nHowever, as LaFollette (1996, p. 63) correctly points out, \nThat is, reasons for love are pro tanto: they are a part of\nthe overall reasons we have for acting, and it is up to us in\nexercising our capacity for agency to decide what on balance we have\nreason to do or even whether we shall act contrary to our reasons. To\nconstrue the notion of a reason for love as compelling us to love, as\nThomas does, is to misconstrue the place such reasons have within our\n agency.[17] \nMost philosophical discussions of the justification of love focus on\nquestion\n (1),\n thinking that answering this question will also, to the extent that\nwe can, answer question\n (2),\n which is typically not distinguished from\n (3).\n The answers given to these questions vary in a way that turns on how\nthe kind of evaluation implicit in love is construed. On the one hand,\nthose who understand the evaluation implicit in love to be a matter of\nthe bestowal of value (such as Telfer 1970–71; Friedman 1993;\nSinger 1994) typically claim that no justification can be given (cf.\n Section 4.2).\n As indicated above, this seems problematic, especially given the\nimportance love can have both in our lives and, especially, in shaping\nour identities as persons. To reject the idea that we can love for\nreasons may reduce the impact our agency can have in defining who we\nare. \nOn the other hand, those who understand the evaluation implicit in\nlove to be a matter of appraisal tend to answer the justificatory\nquestion by appeal to these valuable properties of the beloved. This\nacceptance of the idea that love can be justified leads to two\nfurther, related worries about the object of love. \n\n The\n first worry is raised by Vlastos (1981) in a discussion Plato’s\nand Aristotle’s accounts of love. Vlastos notes that these\naccounts focus on the properties of our beloveds: we are to\nlove people, they say, only because and insofar as they are\nobjectifications of the excellences. Consequently, he argues, in doing\nso they fail to distinguish “disinterested\naffection for the person we love” from\n“appreciation of the excellences instantiated by that\nperson” (p. 33). That is, Vlastos thinks that Plato and\nAristotle provide an account of love that is really a love of\nproperties rather than a love of persons—love of a type\nof person, rather than love of a particular person—thereby\nlosing what is distinctive about love as an essentially\npersonal attitude. This worry about Plato and Aristotle might\nseem to apply just as well to other accounts that justify love in\nterms of the properties of the person: insofar as we love the person\nfor the sake of her properties, it might seem that what we love is\nthose properties and not the person. Here it is surely insufficient to\nsay, as Solomon (1988, p. 154) does, “if love has its reasons,\nthen it is not the whole person that one loves but certain aspects of\nthat person—though the rest of the person comes along too, of\ncourse”: that final tagline fails to address the central\ndifficulty about what the object of love is and so about love as a\ndistinctly personal attitude. \nThe second worry concerns the fungibility of the object of love. To be\nfungible is to be replaceable by another relevantly similar\nobject without any loss of value. Thus, money is fungible: I can give\nyou two $5 bills in exchange for a $10 bill, and neither of us has\nlost anything. Is the object of love fungible? That is, can I simply\nswitch from loving one person to loving another relevantly similar\nperson without any loss? The worry about fungibility is commonly put\nthis way: if we accept that love can be justified by appealing to\nproperties of the beloved, then it may seem that in loving someone for\ncertain reasons, I love him not simply as the individual he is, but as\ninstantiating those properties. And this may imply that any other\nperson instantiating those same properties would do just as well: my\nbeloved would be fungible. Indeed, it may be that another person\nexhibits the properties that ground my love to a greater degree than\nmy current beloved does, and so it may seem that in such a case I have\nreason to “trade up”—to switch my love to the new,\nbetter person. However, it seems clear that the objects of our loves\nare not fungible: love seems to involve a deeply personal commitment\nto a particular person, a commitment that is antithetical to the idea\nthat our beloveds are fungible or to the idea that we ought to be\nwilling to trade up when\n possible.[18] \n\n In\n responding to these worries, Nozick (1989) appeals to the union view\nof love he endorses (see the section on\n Love as Union): \nSo it is because love involves forming a “we” that we must\nunderstand other persons and not properties to be the objects of love,\nand it is because my very identity as a person depends essentially on\nthat “we” that it is not possible to substitute without\nloss one object of my love for another. However, Badhwar (2003)\ncriticizes Nozick, saying that his response implies that once I love\nsomeone, I cannot abandon that love no matter who that person becomes;\nthis, she says, “cannot be understood as love at all rather than\naddiction” (p.\n 61).[19] \nInstead, Badhwar (1987) turns to her robust-concern account of love as\na concern for the beloved for his sake rather than\none’s own. Insofar as my love is disinterested —\nnot a means to antecedent ends of my own—it would be senseless\nto think that my beloved could be replaced by someone who is able to\nsatisfy my ends equally well or better. Consequently, my beloved is in\nthis way irreplaceable. However, this is only a partial response to\nthe worry about fungibility, as Badhwar herself seems to acknowledge.\nFor the concern over fungibility arises not merely for those cases in\nwhich we think of love as justified instrumentally, but also for those\ncases in which the love is justified by the intrinsic value of the\nproperties of my beloved. Confronted with cases like this, Badhwar\n(2003) concludes that the object of love is fungible after all (though\nshe insists that it is very unlikely in practice). (Soble (1990,\nChapter 13) draws similar conclusions.) \nNonetheless, Badhwar thinks that the object of love is\n“phenomenologically non-fungible” (2003, p. 63; see also\n1987, p. 14). By this she means that we experience our\nbeloveds to be irreplaceable: “loving and delighting in [one\nperson] are not completely commensurate with loving and delighting in\nanother” (1987, p. 14). Love can be such that we sometimes\ndesire to be with this particular person whom we love, not another\nwhom we also love, for our loves are qualitatively different. But why\nis this? It seems as though the typical reason I now want to spend\ntime with Amy rather than Bob is, for example, that Amy is funny but\nBob is not. I love Amy in part for her humor, and I love Bob for other\nreasons, and these qualitative differences between them is what makes\nthem not fungible. However, this reply does not address the worry\nabout the possibility of trading up: if Bob were to be at least as\nfunny (charming, kind, etc.) as Amy, why shouldn’t I dump her\nand spend all my time with him? \nA somewhat different approach is taken by Whiting (1991). In response\nto the first worry concerning the object of love, Whiting argues that\nVlastos offers a false dichotomy: having disinterested\naffection for someone—for her sake rather than my\nown—essentially involves an appreciation of her excellences as\nsuch. Indeed, Whiting says, my appreciation of these as excellences,\nand so the underlying commitment I have to their value, just\nis a disinterested commitment to her because these\nexcellences constitute her identity as the person she is. The person,\ntherefore, really is the object of love. Delaney (1996) takes the\ncomplementary tack of distinguishing between the object of\none’s love, which of course is the person, and the\ngrounds of the love, which are her properties: to say, as\nSolomon does, that we love someone for reasons is not at all to say\nthat we only love certain aspects of the person. Thus, Whiting’s\nrejection of Vlastos’ dichotomy can be read as saying that what\nmakes my attitude be one of disinterested affection—one\nof love—for the person is precisely that I am thereby responding\nto her excellences as the reasons for that\n affection.[20] \nOf course, more needs to be said about what it is that makes a\nparticular person be the object of love. Implicit in Whiting’s\naccount is an understanding of the way in which the object of my love\nis determined in part by the history of interactions I have with her:\nit is she, and not merely her properties (which might be instantiated\nin many different people), that I want to be with, it is she, and not\nmerely her properties, on whose behalf I am concerned when she suffers\nand whom I seek to comfort, etc. This addresses the first worry, but\nnot the second worry about fungibility, for the question still remains\nwhether she is the object of my love only as instantiating certain\nproperties, and so whether or not I have reason to “trade\nup.” \n\n To\n respond to the fungibility worry, Whiting and Delaney appeal\nexplicitly to the historical relationship. Thus, Whiting claims,\nalthough there may be a relatively large pool of people who have the\nkind of excellences of character that would justify my loving them,\nand so although there can be no answer to question\n (2)\n about why I come to love this rather than that person within this\npool, once I have come to love this person and so have developed a\nhistorical relation with her, this history of concern justifies my\ncontinuing to love this person rather than someone else (1991, p. 7).\nSimilarly, Delaney claims that love is grounded in\n“historical-relational properties” (1996, p. 346), so that\nI have reasons for continuing to love this person rather than\nswitching allegiances and loving someone else. In each case, the\nappeal to both such historical relations and the excellences of\ncharacter of my friend is intended to provide an answer to question\n (3),\n and this explains why the objects of love are not fungible. \nThere seems to be something very much right with this response.\nRelationships grounded in love are essentially personal, and it would\nbe odd to think of what justifies that love to be merely\nnon-relational properties of the beloved. Nonetheless, it is still\nunclear how the historical-relational propreties can provide any\nadditional justification for subsequent concern beyond that which is\nalready provided (as an answer to question\n (1))\n by appeal to the excellences of the beloved’s character (cf.\nBrink 1999). The mere fact that I have loved her in the past does not\nseem to justify my continuing to love her in the future. When\nwe imagine that she is going through a rough time and begins to lose\nthe virtues justifying my initial love for her, why shouldn’t I\ndump her and instead come to love someone new having all of those\nvirtues more fully? Intuitively (unless the change she undergoes makes\nher in some important sense no longer the same person she was), we\nthink I should not dump her, but the appeal to the mere fact that I\nloved her in the past is surely not enough. Yet what\nhistorical-relational properties could do the trick? (For an\ninteresting attempt at an answer, see Kolodny 2003.) \nIf we think that love can be justified, then it may seem that the\nappeal to particular historical facts about a loving relationship to\njustify that love is inadequate, for such idiosyncratic and subjective\nproperties might explain but cannot justify love.\nRather, it may seem, justification in general requires appealing to\nuniversal, objective properties. But such properties are ones that\nothers might share, which leads to the problem of fungibility.\nConsequently it may seem that love cannot be justified. In the face of\nthis predicament, accounts of love that understand love to be an\nattitude towards value that is intermediate between appraisal and\nbestowal, between recognizing already existing value and creating that\nvalue (see\n Section 4.3)\n might seem to offer a way out. For once we reject the thought that\nthe value of our beloveds must be either the precondition or the\nconsequence of our love, we have room to acknowledge that the deeply\npersonal, historically grounded, creative nature of love (central to\nbestowal accounts) and the understanding of love as responsive to\nvaluable properties of the beloved that can justify that love (central\nto appraisal accounts) are not mutually exclusive (Helm 2010; Bagley\n2015).","contact.mail":"bennett.helm@fandm.edu","contact.domain":"fandm.edu"}]
