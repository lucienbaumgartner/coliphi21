His works are not limited to education\nbut deal with a wide range of subjects including philosophy,\npsychology, politics, social reform and religion. Vives was not a\nsystematic writer, which makes it difficult to classify him as a\nphilosopher. His thought is eclectic and pragmatic, as well as\nhistorical, in its orientation. He took what he considered most valid\nfrom a variety of sources and combined these elements into a\nChristianized Aristotelianism.\n\nJuan Luis Vives was born in Valencia, Spain on March 6, 1493 (not\n1492, as is often found in the literature on him). His parents were\nJewish cloth merchants who had converted to Catholicism and who strove\nto live with the insecurities of their precarious situation. His\nfather, Luis Vives Valeriola (1453–1524), had been prosecuted in\n1477 for secretly practicing Judaism. A second trial took place in\n1522 and ended two years later when he was burned at the stake. His\nmother, Blanquina March (1473–1508), became a Christian in 1491,\none year before the decree expelling Jews from Spain. She died in 1508\nof the plague. Twenty years after her death, she was charged with\nhaving visited a clandestine synagogue. Her remains were exhumed and\npublicly burned. \nIn his youth, Vives attended the Estudio General of his hometown. In\n1509, he moved to Paris and enrolled as a freshman in the faculty of\narts. He was never to return to Spain. Vives began his studies at the\nCollège de Lisieux, where Juan Dolz had just started a\ntriennial course, but soon moved to the Collège de Beauvais,\nwhere he attended the lectures of Jan Dullaert (d.1513). From the fall\nof 1512, Vives started to attend the course of the Aragonese Gaspar\nLax (1487–1560) at the Collège de Montaigu. Through\nNicolas Bérault (c.1470–c.1545), who was an associate of\nGuillaume Budé (1467–1540) and taught at various colleges\nin Paris, Vives also came into contact with the Parisian humanist\ncircle. \nIn 1514, Vives left Paris without having taken any formal academic\ndegree and moved to the Low Countries. He settled in Bruges, where he\nwould spend most of his life. About this time, he was introduced to\nErasmus and appointed as tutor to the Flemish nobleman William of\nCroy. From 1517 until Croy’s premature death in 1521, Vives\nlived in Louvain and taught at the Collegium Trilingue, a humanist\nfoundation based on Erasmian educational principles. In this period he\nwrote ‘Fabula de homine’ (‘A Fable about\nMan,’ 1518), an early version of his views on the nature and\npurpose of mankind; De initiis, sectis et laudibus\nphilosophiae (On the Origins, Schools and Merits of\nPhilosophy, 1518), a short essay on the history of philosophy;\nIn pseudodialecticos (Against the\nPseudo-Dialecticians, 1519), a lively and trenchant attack on\nscholastic logic; as well as a critical edition, with an extensive\ncommentary, of Augustine’s De civitate Dei (City of\nGod, 1522), which was commissioned by Erasmus. \nFrom 1523 to 1528, Vives divided his time between England, which he\nvisited on six occasions, and Bruges, where he married Margarita\nValldaura in 1524. In England he attended the court of Henry VIII and\nCatherine of Aragon, and was tutor to their daughter, Mary. He also\nheld a lectureship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and associated\nwith English humanists such as Thomas More and Thomas Linacre. During\nthese years he published De institutione feminae Christianae\n(The Education of a Christian Woman, 1524), in which he set\nout pedagogical principles for the instruction of women; the extremely\npopular Introductio ad sapientiam (Introduction to\nWisdom, 1524), a short handbook of ethics, blending Stoicism and\nChristianity; and De subventione pauperum (On Assistance\nto the Poor, 1526), a program for the organization of public\nrelief, which he dedicated to the magistrates of Bruges. In 1528 he\nlost the favor of Henry VIII by siding with his fellow countrywoman\nCatherine of Aragon in the matter of the divorce. He was placed under\nhouse arrest for a time, before being allowed to return to Bruges. \nThe last twelve years of Vives’ life were his most productive,\nand it was in this period that he published several of the works for\nwhich he is best known today. These include De concordia et\ndiscordia in humano genere (On Concord and Discord in\nHumankind, 1529), a piece of social criticism emphasizing the\nvalue of peace and the absurdity of war; De disciplinis\n(On the Disciplines, 1531), an encyclopedic treatise\nproviding an extensive critique of the foundations of contemporary\neducation, as well as a program for its renewal; and De anima et\nvita (On the Soul and Life, 1538), a study of the soul\nand its interaction with the body, which also contains a penetrating\nanalysis of the emotions. De veritate fidei Christianae\n(On the Truth of the Christian Faith), the most thorough\ndiscussion of his religious views, was published posthumously in 1543.\nHe died in Bruges on May 6, 1540. \nVives’ career as a leading northern European humanist starts\nwith the publication in 1519 of In pseudodialecticos, a\nsatirical diatribe in which he voices his opposition to scholastic\nlogic on several counts. He follows in the footsteps of earlier\nhumanists such as Lorenzo Valla (1406–57) and Rudolph Agricola\n(1443–85), who set about to replace the scholastic curriculum,\nbased on syllogistic and disputation, with a treatment of logic\noriented toward the use of the topics, a technique of verbal\nassociation aiming at the invention and organization of material for\narguments, and persuasion. Vives’ severe censure of scholastic\nlogic derived from his own unhappy experience with the scholastic\ncurriculum at Paris. Therefore, as he himself emphasized, no one could\naccuse him of “condemning it because he did not understand\nit” (Opera omnia, 1964, III, 38; all quotations below\nare from this edition). Erasmus wrote to More that no one was better\nsuited for the battle against the dialecticians, in whose ranks he had\nserved for many years. \nThe main targets of Vives’ criticism are Peter of Spain’s\nSummule logicales, a work dating from the thirteenth century\nbut which still held an important place in the university curriculum,\nand the theory of the property of terms, a semantic theory dealing\nwith properties of linguistic expressions such as signification, i.e.,\nthe meaning of a word regardless of context, and supposition, i.e.,\nthe meaning of a word within the context of its use in a proposition.\nHe repudiates the use of technical jargon, accessible only to a narrow\ngroup of professionals, and maintains that if scholastic logicians\nmade an effort to speak plainly and according to common usage, many of\ntheir conundrums would disappear. Instead, they choose to fritter away\ntheir ingenuity on logically ambiguous propositions known as\nsophismata. Vives provides many examples of such\npropositions, which in his view make no sense whatever and are\ncertainly of no use. Many of these, such as “Some animal is not\nman, therefore some man is not animal” (III, 54), were standard\nscholastic examples. Others, such as “Only any non-donkey\nc of any man except Socrates and another c belonging\nto this same man begins contingently to be black” (III, 40), are\nintended as a mockery of the futile quibbling he associated with\nscholastic method. Since dialectic, like rhetoric and grammar, deals\nwith language, its rules should be adapted to the rules of ordinary\nlanguage; but with what language, he asks, have these propositions to\ndo? Moreover, dialectic should not be learned for its own sake, but as\na support for the other arts; therefore, no more effort should be\nspent on it than is absolutely necessary. Vives’ criticism is\nalso informed by ethical concerns and the demand for a method that\nwould be of use in everyday life rather than in academic disputations.\nIn contrast to the standard interpretation, it has been argued that\nIn pseudodialecticos is not a serious refutation of\nscholasticism, but rather a sophistical exercise replete with\nfallacious arguments, whose purpose is to teach a valuable lesson in\nscholastic dialectic challenging the reader to detect the many logical\nfallacies that it contains. According to this interpretation, In\npseudodialecticos offers no serious arguments against scholastic\nlogical theory or principles (see Perreiah, 2014, ch.4).  \nA more detailed criticism can be found in De disciplinis of\n1531. This encyclopedic treatise is divided into three parts: De\ncausis corruptarum artium (On the Causes of the Corruption of\nthe Arts), seven books devoted to a thoroughgoing critique of the\nfoundations of contemporary education; De tradendis\ndisciplinis (On Handing Down the Disciplines), five\nbooks in which Vives outlines his program for educational reform; and\nfive shorter treatises De artibus (On the Arts),\ndealing mainly with logic and metaphysics. These five treatises\ninclude De prima philosophia (On First Philosophy),\na compendium of Aristotelian physics and metaphysics from a Christian\npoint of view; De censura veri (On the Assessment of\nTruth), a discussion of the proposition and the forms of\nargumentation; De explanatione cuiusque essentiae (On the\nExplanation of Each Essence); De instrumento\nprobabilitatis (On the Instrument of Probability), which\ncontains a theory of knowledge, as well as a detailed account of\ndialectical invention; and De disputatione (On\nDisputation), in which he discusses non-formal proofs. In these\ntreatises, Vives not only continues the trends in humanist dialectic\ninitiated by Valla and Agricola, but also displays a familiarity with\nphilosophical technicalities that was unusual among humanists and that\nreveals the more traditionally Aristotelian aspects of his thought.\nHis appraisal of the Aristotelian corpus is summarised in Censura\nde Aristotelis operibus (Assessment of Aristotle’s\nWorks, 1538). A posthumously published treatise entitled\nDialectices libri quatuor (Four Books of Dialectic,\n1550) appears to be a youthful work that Vives evidently did not\nconsider suitable for publication. \nVives’ criticism of scholastic logic hinges on a profound\nanalysis of the arts of discourse. For him, the supremacy of the\nsermo communis (ordinary discourse) over the abstract\nlanguage of metaphysics is indisputable. Philosophy ought not to\ninvent the language and subject of its own specific investigation (VI,\n140). In De causis corruptarum artium, he writes:\n“enraged against nature, about which they know nothing, the\ndialecticians have constructed another one for themselves—that\nis to say, the nature of formalities, individual natures\n(ecceitates), realities, relations, Platonic ideas and other\nmonstrosities which cannot be understood even by those who have\ninvented them” (VI, 190–1). Instead of the formal language\nof the dialecticians, which he found completely unsuited to interpret\nreality, he proposes the less rigorous but more concrete universe of\neveryday communication, which answers all our practical needs and aims\nto provide a knowledge that is useful. \nVives was pessimistic about the possibility of attaining knowledge as\nunderstood in Aristotelian terms; and his thought anticipates the\nmoderate skepticism of early modern philosophers such as Francisco\nSanches (1551–1623) and Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655). Vives\nbelongs, like Francis Bacon (1561–1626), to the so-called\n“maker’s knowledge” tradition, which regards\nknowledge as a kind of making or as a capacity to make (see A.\nPérez-Ramos, Francis Bacon’s Idea of Science and the\nMaker’s Knowledge Tradition, Oxford and New York: Clarendon\nPress and Oxford University Press, 1988). He often insists on the\npractical nature of knowledge; for instance, in De causis\ncorruptarum artium, he maintains that peasants and artisans know\nnature far better than many philosophers (VI, 190). In Satellitium\nanimi (The Soul’s Escort, 1524), a collection of\naphorisms dedicated to Princess Mary, he points out that “man\nknows as far as he can make” (IV, 63). A central tenet of the\nmaker’s knowledge tradition is that man cannot gain access to\nnature’s intimate works, since these, as opera divina\n(divine works), are only known to God, their maker. \nAccording to Vives, things have two different layers: one external,\nconsisting in the sensible accidents of the thing, and another,\ninternal, and therefore hidden, which is the essence of the thing\n(III, 197). “The true and genuine essences of all things”,\nhe writes, “are not known by us in themselves. They hide\nconcealed in the innermost part of each thing where our mind, enclosed\nby the bulk of the body and the darkness of life, cannot\npenetrate” (III, 406–7). Vives subscribes to the\nAristotelian principle that all of our knowledge has its origin in\nperception. We cannot learn anything, he maintains, except through the\nsenses (III, 193 and 378). But he also maintains that the human mind\n“must realize that, since it is locked up in a dark prison and\nsurrounded by obscurity, it is prevented from understanding many\nthings and cannot clearly observe or know what it wants: neither the\nconcealed essence of material things, nor the quality and character of\nimmaterial things; nor can it, on account of the gloom of the body,\nuse its acuity and swiftness” (III, 329). In other words, since\nthe senses cannot grasp what is incorporeal or hidden, sense\nperception does not yield any knowledge of the essence of things but\nonly of their accidents. Vives’ view, however, is that sensory\nknowledge must nonetheless be transcended by means of reasoning. Yet,\naccording to him, the best that human reason can accomplish in this\nprocess is to provide a judgment grounded in all the available\nevidence, thereby increasing the probability of the conclusion. In his\nview, our knowledge of the essence of a thing is only an approximate\nguess based on the sensible operations of the thing in question (III,\n122). \nThe most reliable guide for human inquiry, he argues, is\nmankind’s natural propensity toward what is good and true. This\nlight of our mind, as he also calls it, is always, directly or\nindirectly, inclined toward what is good and true, and can be regarded\nas the beginning and origin of prudence and of all sciences and arts.\nThis natural propensity can be perfected if it is subjected to\nteaching and exercise, just as the seeds of plants grow better if they\nare cultivated by the industrious hands of a farmer. He found\nphilosophical grounds for this idea in Cicero’s report (see,\ne.g., De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods),\nI.43–5) of the Hellenistic theory of anticipationes\n(anticipations) and of naturales informationes (natural\nnotions), which we have not learned from teachers or custom, but are\ninstead derived and received from nature (III, 356–7). The\ntopics, which Vives conceives as a reflection of the ontological\norder, represent another valuable instrument for human inquiry. In his\nview, the topics are a set of universal aspects of things that help to\nbring order to the great variety of nature. As such, they play an\nimportant role as organizing principles of knowledge. They are like a\ngrid through which knowledge can be acquired and arguments formulated\n(see Nauta, 2015). Nevertheless, human knowledge can be nothing other\nthan a finite participation in creation. Because of the limitations\nthat characterize man’s fallen state, investigations into the\nrealm of nature can only lead to conjectures, and not to firm and\nindubitable knowledge, which we neither deserve nor need. In De\nprima philosophia, Vives writes: “human inquiry comes to\nconjectural conclusions, for we do not deserve certain knowledge\n(scientia), stained by sin as we are and hence burdened with\nthe great weight of the body; nor do we need it, for we see that man\nis ordained lord and master of everything in the sublunary\nworld” (III, 188). In his opinion, certainty is not a\nprerequisite for advances in science and philosophy; and as a\ncriterion for scientific progress and for the rational conduct of\nlife, he advocates a method consisting in sound judgment based on\nexperience. \nHistory, seen as the sum of all human experience, is therefore of\ngreat importance for all branches of learning. In De tradendis\ndisciplinis, Vives maintains that “history appears to\nsurpass all disciplines, since it either gives birth to or nourishes,\ndevelops [and] cultivates all arts” (VI, 291). In this sense,\nhistory is not primarily regarded as the memory of great deeds or the\nsource of useful examples, but as a process of development. In\nprinciple, every new generation is better equipped than the preceding\none, since it can derive advantage from all earlier experience:\n“It is therefore clear – he maintains – that if only\nwe apply our minds sufficiently, we can formulate better opinions\nabout matters of life and nature than could Aristotle, Plato, or any\nof the ancients” (VI, 6–7). According to Vives, the saying\n“we are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants” is plainly\nfalse. We are not dwarfs, nor were they giants. All humans are\ncomposed of the same structure (VI, 39). The idea of progress plays an\nessential role in Vives’ conception of intellectual history, and\nseveral of the cultural problems he deals with, such as the causes of\nthe corruption of the arts, are approached from an historical\nperspective. \nVives’ moral philosophy stems mainly from his Christian humanism\nand is aimed at the reform of both individuals and society. He often\nproclaims the superiority of Christian ethics over pagan wisdom (I,\n23; VI, 209–10). In De causis corruptarum artium, he\nargues at length that Aristotle’s ethics, on account of its\nworldly conception of happiness and virtue, is completely incompatible\nwith the Christianity: “we cannot serve both Christ and\nAristotle, whose teaching are diametrically opposed to each\nother” (VI, 218). He has more sympathy for Platonism and\nStoicism, which he believes are broadly in line with Christian\nmorality. In De initiis, sectis et laudibus philosophiae, he\neven asserts: “I do not think, in fact, that there is any truer\nChristian than the Stoic sage” (III, 17). \nIn Introductio ad sapientiam, inspired by the teaching of the\nStoics, he recommends self-knowledge as the first step toward virtue,\nwhich he regards as the culmination of human perfection. We should\nnot, in his judgment, call anything our own except our soul, in which\nlearning and virtue, or their opposites, are to be found. The body is\n“a bondslave of the soul” (mancipium animi),\nwhile such things as riches, power, nobility, honor, dignity, and\ntheir contraries, are completely external to man (I, 2; VI, 401). Vice\nfollows from a wrong judgment about the value of things:\n“Nothing – he writes – is more destructive in human\nlife than a corrupt judgment which gives no object its proper\nvalue” (I, 1). To be wise, however, is not only to have true\nopinions about things, but also to translate this knowledge into\naction by desiring honorable things and avoiding evil (I, 2). Wisdom\ntherefore requires the subordination of the passions to the control of\nthe intellect. \nVives holds that the best means to secure the reform of society is\nthrough the moral and practical training of the individual. In his\nview, there are two related paths which are necessary to develop our\nhumanity: education and action. Education is fundamental in order for\nus to rise above our animal instincts and realize our full potential\nas human beings. However, learning needs to be applied in every day\nlife, especially for the public good (see Verbeke, 2014). Man, by his\nown nature, is a social being: “Experience proves every day that\nman was created by God for society, both in this and in the eternal\nlife. For this reason God inspired in man an admirable disposition of\nbenevolence and good will toward other men” (VI, 222–3).\nIn the first book of De subventione pauperum, which consists\nof a theoretical discussion of the human condition, he stresses not\nonly our need for and dependency on others, but also our natural\ninclination to love and help one another. He regards the development\nof society as a distinctly human achievement, based on the ability to\nprofit from experience and turn knowledge to useful ends. Social\nproblems, such as poverty and war, are the result of emotional\ndisorders. During Vives’ lifetime, Europe experienced dissension\nand war between princes and within the church, as well as the\nincreased threat posed by Muslim expansion into Western Europe. He\naddressed the problem of political and religious disturbances in\nseveral works, which also deal with the psychological origins of\ndiscord, the proper conduct of all the offices of the commonweal, and\nthe theme of Christian harmony. His mayor political text on European\nwar and peace is De concordia et discordia in humano genere\nwhere he sets out the case for the origins of discord in society and\nhe aims to show how peace and concord can be fostered through\nknowledge of human nature, especially the emotions. According to him,\nthe virtue of the people can only be maintained and promoted in peace.\n“In war, as in a sick body, no member exercises its office\nproperly” (V, 180–1). Vives deplored the Italian war\nbetween France and Spain (1521–6), which, he felt, completely\nignored the rights of the suffering population, and accused Francis I\nand Charles V of irresponsibility and criminal ambition (VI, 480). In\nthese circumstances, he often referred to the notion of natural law,\nwhich, as he explains in his preface to Cicero’s De\nlegibus (On the Laws), has the same validity everywhere\nbecause it was impressed on the heart of every human being before\nbirth (V, 494). \nVives’ philosophical reflections on the human soul are mainly\nconcentrated in De anima et vita, published in 1538, which\nprovides the psychological underpinning for many of his educational\nideas and can be characterized as a prolegomenon to moral philosophy.\nHe attempts to reconcile the Aristotelian view of the soul as an\norganizing and animating principle with the Platonic conception of the\nsoul as an immaterial and immortal substance. He also pays close\nattention to physiology and, following the Galenic tradition,\nmaintains that our mental capacities depend on the temperament of our\nbody. \nThe structure of the treatise is indebted to the traditional approach\nof faculty psychology, in which the soul is said to be composed of a\nnumber of different faculties or powers, each directed toward a\ndifferent object and responsible for a distinct operation. The first\nbook covers the functions of the vegetative soul (nutrition, growth\nand reproduction), of the sensitive soul (the five external senses),\nand of the cogitative soul (the internal senses, i.e., a variety of\ncognitive faculties, including imagination, fantasy and the estimative\npower, which are located in the three ventricles of the brain, and\nwhose acts follows from the acts of the external senses). The second\nbook deals with the functions of the rational soul and its three\nfaculties (mind, will, and memory), as well as with topics stemming\nfrom Aristotle’s Parva naturalia, such as sleep,\ndreams, and longevity. The third and final book explores the emotions,\nwhich Vives, rejecting the Stoic view, regards as natural responses to\nthe way things appear to us and as essential constituents of human\nlife. \nHe defines the soul as “the principal agent inhabiting a body\nadapted to life (agens praecipuum, habitans in corpore apto ad\nvitam).” The soul is called an agent in the sense that it\nacts through instruments—e.g., heat, humors and spirits—by\nmeans of its own power. That it is the principal agent means that,\neven though its instruments act on the body, they do not operate by\nmeans of their own power but only through the power that they receive\nfrom the soul (III, 335–6). The organs governing our rational\nfunctions consist of fine and bright spirits exhaled from the\npericardial blood. Although the heart is the source and origin of all\nthe rational soul’s operations, the head is their workshop. In\nfact, the mind does not apprehend, nor is it affected, unless the\nspirits reach the brain (III, 365–6). \nThe enormous importance Vives attaches to the exploration of the\nemotions is reflected in the fact that he describes the branch of\nphilosophy that provides a remedy for the severe diseases of the soul\nnot only as “the foundation of all morality, private as well as\npublic” (III, 299–300), but also as “the supreme\nform of learning and knowledge” (I, 17). Emotions (affectus\nsive affectiones) are defined as “the acts of those\nfaculties which nature gave to our souls for the pursuit of good and\nthe avoidance of evil, by means of which we are led toward the good\nand we move away from or against evil”. He stresses that the\nterms “good” and “evil” in this definition\nmean, not what is in reality good or evil, but rather what each person\njudges to be good or evil (III, 422). Therefore, the more pure and\nelevated the judgment, the more it takes account of what is genuinely\ngood and true, admitting fewer and less intense emotions and becoming\ndisturbed more rarely. Immoderate and confused movements, on the other\nhand, are the result of ignorance, thoughtlessness, and false\njudgments, since we judge the good or evil to be greater than it\nreally is (III, 425). \nOne of the most distinctive features of Vives’ study of the\nhuman soul is the fundamental role that psychological inquiry came to\nplay in his reform program. His use of psychological principles in his\nwritings often surpasses that of previous authors in both scope and\ndetail. He applies these principles, for instance, not only to\nindividual conduct and education, but also to professional practice,\nsocial reform, and practical affairs in general. According to Vives,\npsychology is relevant to all disciplines. “The study of\nman’s soul”, he writes in De tradendis\ndisciplinis, “exercises a most helpful influence on all\nkinds of knowledge, because our knowledge is determined by the\nintelligence and comprehension of our minds, not by the things\nthemselves” (VI, 375). \nVives’ works, which went through hundreds of editions and were\ntranslated into several vernacular languages, continued to be widely\nread and extremely influential during the century after their\npublication. His critical attitude toward the Aristotelian orthodoxy\nof his day left a mark on several authors. Mario Nizolio\n(1488–1567) cites Vives numerous times in De veris\nprincipiis et vera ratione philosophandi contra pseudophilosophos\n(On the True Principles and True Method of Philosophizing against\nthe Pseudo-Philosophers, 1553), an attack on Aristotelian\ndialectic and metaphysics, which G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716)\nconsidered to be worth editing more than a hundred years later. In\nQuod nihil scitur (That Nothing is Known, 1581), one\nof the best systematic expositions of philosophical skepticism\nproduced during the sixteenth century, the Portuguese philosopher and\nmedical writer Francisco Sanches displays a familiarity with De\ndisciplinis, and there are indications that he might also have\nbeen acquainted with In pseudodialecticos. In\nExercitationes paradoxicae adversus Aristoteleos\n(Paradoxical Exercises against the Aristotelians, 1624), a\nskeptical attack on Aristotelianism, Pierre Gassendi says that reading\nVives gave him courage and helped him to free himself from the\ndogmatism of Peripatetic philosophy. \nPsychology was another area in which Vives enjoyed considerable\nsuccess. Philip Melanchthon (1497–1560) recommended De anima\net vita in the prefatory letter to his Commentarius de\nanima (Commentary on the Soul, 1540). Vives’\ninfluence on the naturalistic pedagogy of the Spaniard Juan Huarte de\nSan Juan (c.1529–1588), in his celebrated El examen de\ningenios para las ciencias (The Examination of Men’s\nWits, 1575), is undeniable. In his discussion of the passions of\nthe soul, the Jesuit Francisco Suárez (1548–1617) counted\nVives among his authorities, pointing out that the study of the\nemotions belongs to natural philosophy and medicine as well as to\nmoral philosophy. Vives’ treatise was also an important source\nof inspiration for Robert Burton (1577–1640), who, in The\nAnatomy of Melancholy (1621), repeatedly quotes from De anima\net vita. The reference to Vives by René Descartes\n(1596–1650) in Les Passions de l’âme (1649)\nsuggests that he had read the book. \nAlthough Vives is rarely mentioned in the scholarly literature on the\nScottish philosophy of “Common Sense,” the impact of his\nthought on leading exponents of the school was significant. William\nHamilton (1788–1856) praised Vives’ insights on memory and\nthe laws of association. In his “Contributions Towards a History\nof the Doctrine of Mental Suggestion or Association”, he quotes\nextensive portions of Vives’ account of memory and maintains\nthat the observations of “the Spanish Aristotelian”\ncomprise “nearly all of principal moment that has been said upon\nthis subject, either before or since”. Moreover, Vives’\nDialectices libri quatuor (1550) was one of the primary\nsources of Thomas Reid (1710–1796) in his “A Brief Account\nof Aristotle’s Logic” (1774). \nDuring the second half of the nineteenth century and the fist decades\nof the twentieth, Vives was read and studied by philosophers such as\nErnest Renan (1823–1892), Friedrich Albert Lange\n(1828–1875), Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911), Pierre Duhem\n(1861–1916), Ernst Cassirer (1874–1945), and José\nOrtega y Gasset (1883–1955). Lange regards him as one of the\nmost important reformers of philosophy of his time and a precursor of\nboth Bacon and Descartes. According to Ortega y Gasset, Vives’\nmethod, firmly based on experience, and his emphasis on the need to\nfound a new culture grounded, not in barren speculation, but in the\nusefulness of knowledge, anticipate some elements of the modern\nZeitgeist.","contact.mail":"lorenzo.casini@filosofi.uu.se","contact.domain":"filosofi.uu.se"}]
