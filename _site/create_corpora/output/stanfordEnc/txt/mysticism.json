Some philosophers have questioned the emphasis on experience\nin favor of examining the entire mystical complex (See Jantzen, 1994\nand 1995, and section 9 below, and Turner, 1996). Sarah Coakley has\nargued for replacing the datum for investigation from individual\nexperiential episodes to ongoing contemplative practices. (Coakley\n2009, and see Section 9).  Typically, mystics, theistic or not, see\ntheir mystical experience as part of a larger undertaking aimed at\nhuman transformation (See, for example, Teresa of Avila,\nLife, Chapter 19) and not as the terminus of their\nefforts. ‘Mysticism’ is best thought of as a constellation\nof distinctive practices, discourses, texts, institutions, traditions,\nand experiences aimed at human transformation, variously defined. This\nentry reports on mysticism and philosophy so will concentrate chiefly\non the topics philosophers have discussed concerning mystical\nexperience.\n\n\nBecause of its variable meanings, a\ndefinition of ‘mystical experience’ must be partly\nstipulative. Two, related, senses of ‘mystical experience’\nwill be presented, one a wide definition reflecting a more general\nusage, and the second a narrow definition suiting more specialized\ntreatments of mysticism in philosophy. \n\nIn the wide sense, let us say that a ‘mystical\nexperience,’ is: \n\nWe can further define the terms used in the definition, as\nfollows: The inclusion of ‘purportedly’ is to allow the\ndefinition to be accepted without acknowledging that mystics ever\nreally do experience realities or states of affairs in the way\ndescribed. A ‘super sense-perceptual experience’ includes\nperception-like content of a kind not appropriate to sense perception,\nsomatosensory modalities (including the means for sensing pain and body\ntemperature, and internally sensing body, limb, organ, and visceral\npositions and states), or standard introspection. Some mystics have\nreferred to a “spiritual” sense, corresponding to the\nperceptual senses, appropriate to a non-physical realm. A super\nsense-perceptual mode of experience may accompany sense perception (see\non “extrovertive” experience, Section 2.1). For example, a\nperson can have a super sense-perceptual experience while watching a\nsetting sun. The inclusion of the supersensory mode is what makes the\nexperience mystical. A ‘sub sense-perceptual experience’ is either devoid of\nphenomenological content altogether, or nearly so (see the notion of\n“pure conscious events,” in Sections 5 and 6), or consists\nof phenomenological content appropriate to sense perception, but\nlacking in the conceptualization typical of attentive sense perception\n(see below on “unconstructed experiences”). ‘Acquaintance’ of realities means the subject is\naware (putatively) of the presence of (one or more)\nrealities. ‘States of affairs’ includes, for example, the\nimpermanence of all reality and that God is the ground of the self.\n‘Acquaintance’ of states of affairs can come in two forms.\nIn one, a subject is aware of the presence of (one or more) realities\non which (one or more) states of affairs supervene. An example would be\nan awareness of God (a reality) affording an awareness of one’s utter\ndependence on God (a state of affairs). In its second form,\n‘acquaintance’ of states of affairs involves an insight\ndirectly, without supervening on acquaintance, of any reality. An\nexample would be coming to “see” the impermanence of all\nthat exists following an experience that eliminates all\nphenomenological content. \n\nIt is not necessary that at the\ntime of the experience the subject could tell herself, as it were,\nwhat realities or state of affairs were then being disclosed to her.\nThe realization may arise following the experience.  \n\nMystical experience is alleged to be “noetic,” involving\nknowledge of what a subject apprehends (see James, 1958). To what\nextent this knowledge is alleged to come from the experience alone will\nbe discussed below (Section 8.5). \n\nGenerally, philosophers have excluded purely para-sensual experiences\nsuch as religious visions and auditions from the mystical. The\ndefinition also excludes anomalous experiences such as out of body\nexperiences, telepathy, precognition, and clairvoyance. All of these\nare acquaintance with objects or qualities of a kind accessible to the\nsenses or to ordinary introspection, such as human thoughts and future\nphysical events. (A degree of vagueness enters the definition of\nmystical experience here because of what is to count as a\n“kind” of thing accessible to non-mystical\nexperience.) \n\nIn the wide sense, mystical experiences occur within the religious\ntraditions of at least Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Indian religions,\nBuddhism, and primal religions. In some of these traditions, the\nexperiences are allegedly of a supersensory reality, such as God or\nBrahman (or, in a few Buddhist traditions, Nirvana, as a reality (See\nTakeuchi, 1983, pp. 8–9). Many Buddhist traditions, however, make no\nclaim for an experience of a supersensory reality. Some cultivate\ninstead an experience of “unconstructed awareness,”\ninvolving an awareness of the world on an absolutely or relatively\nnon-conceptual level (see Griffiths, 1993). The unconstructed\nexperience is thought to grant insight, such as into the impermanent\nnature of all things. Buddhists refer to an experience of tathata or\nthe “thisness” of reality, accessible only by the absence\nof ordinary sense-perceptual cognition. These Buddhist experiences are\nsub sense-perceptual, and mystical, since thisness is claimed to be\ninaccessible to ordinary sense perception and the awareness of it to\nprovide knowledge about the true nature of reality. Some Buddhist\nexperiences, however, including some Zen experiences, would not count\nas mystical by our definition, involving no alleged acquaintance with\neither a reality or a state of affairs (see Suzuki, 1970). \n\nIn the narrow sense, more common among philosophers, ‘mystical\nexperience’ refers to a sub-class of mystical experience in the\nwide sense. Specifically it refers to: \n\nA unitive experience involves a phenomenological de-emphasis,\nblurring, or eradication of multiplicity, where the cognitive\nsignificance of the experience is deemed to lie precisely in that\nphenomenological feature. Examples are experiences of the oneness of\nall of nature, “union” with God, as in Christian\nmysticism, (see section 2.2.1), the Hindu experience that Atman is\nBrahman (that the self/soul is identical with the eternal, absolute\nbeing), the Buddhist unconstructed experience, devoid of all\nmultiplicity. (On “unitive” experiences see Smart 1958 and\n1978, and Wainwright, 1981, Chapter One.) Excluded from the narrow\ndefinition, though present in the wide one, are, for example, a\ndualistic experience of God, where subject and God remain strictly\ndistinct, without any blurring of the boundaries, a Jewish kabbalistic\nexperience of a single supernal sefirah, and shamanistic\nexperiences of spirits. These are not mystical in the narrow sense,\nbecause not unitive experiences in any degree. \n\nHereafter, ‘mystical experience’ will be used in the\nnarrow sense, unless otherwise noted. Correspondingly, the term\n‘mysticism’ will refer to practices, discourse, texts,\ninstitutions, and traditions associated with unitive experiences. \n\nCare should be taken not to confuse mystical experience with\n“religious experience.” The latter refers to any experience\nhaving content or significance appropriate to a religious context or\nthat has a “religious” flavor. This would include much of\nmystical experience, but also religious visions and auditions,\nnon-mystical Zen experiences, and various religious feelings, such as\nreligious awe and sublimity. Also included is what Friedrich\nSchleiermacher identified as the fundamental religious experience: the\nfeeling of “absolute dependence” (Schleiermacher,\n1963).  \n\nWe can call a numinous (from “numen” meaning\ndivine or spirit) experience, a non-unitive experience.Your garden-variety sense of\nGod’s (mere) “presence” would count as a numinous\nexperience. Numinous experiences contrast with religious experiences\nthat involve, for example, feelings but no alleged acquaintance with\nnon-sensory realities or states of affairs. \n\nRudolf Otto reserved the term “numinous experience” for\nexperiences allegedly of a reality perceived of as “wholly\nother” than the subject, producing a reaction of dread and\nfascination before an incomprehensible mystery (Otto, 1957). In the\nsense used here, Otto’s “numinous” experience is but one\nkind of numinous experience. \n\nMystical and religious experiences can be classified in various\nways, in addition to the built-in difference between mystical super\nsense-perceptual and sub sense-perceptual experiences. This section\nnotes some common classifications. \n\nWhen any experience includes sense-perceptual, somatosensory, or\nintrospective content, we may say it is an extrovertive\nexperience. There are, then, mystical extrovertive experiences, as in\none’s mystical consciousness of the unity of nature overlaid\nonto one’s sense perception of the world, as well as non-unitive\nnuminous extrovertive experiences, as when experiencing God’s\npresence when gazing at a snowflake. When not extrovertive, we may say\nan experience is introvertive. An experience of\n“nothingness” or “emptiness,” in some mystical\ntraditions, and an experience of God resulting from a disengagement\nfrom sense experience, would be examples of introvertive experiences\n(For further elaboration see section 4). \n\nA favorite distinction of Western philosophers is between dualistic\nand monistic experiences. A dualistic experience maintains a\ndistinction, however tenuous, between the subject and what is\ndisclosed. Thus, theistic experiences are ordinarily dualistic,\nretaining, at some level, a distinction between God and the\nmystic. Monistic experiences are the extreme of unitive experiences,\nin that they dissolve all duality. They are either experiences of the\nabsolute ontological oneness of everything, so that in a deep sense\nthe distinctions are illusory, or are pure conscious experiences.\n \n\n“Union” with God signifies a rich family of experiences\nrather than a single experience. “Union” involves a\nfalling away of the separation between a person and God, short of\nidentity.  Christian mystics have variously described union with the\nDivine. This includes Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153)\ndescribing unification as “mutuality of love,” Henry Suso\n(1295–1366) likening union with God to a drop of water falling\ninto wine, taking on the taste and color of the wine (Suso, 1953,\np. 185), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293–1381) describing union as\n“iron within the fire and the fire within the iron” (see\nPike, 1992, Chapter 2, and Mommaers, 2009). Generally, medieval\nChristian mysticism had at least three stages, variously described, in\nthe union-consciousness: quiet, essentially a prelude to the union\nwith God, full union, and rapture, the latter involving a feeling of\nbeing “carried away” beyond oneself (see Pike, 1992,\nChapter 1). \n\nTheistic mystics sometimes speak as though they have a consciousness\nof being fully absorbed into or even identical with God. Examples are\nthe Islamic Sufi mystic al-Husayn al-Hallaj (858–922) proclaiming,\n“I am God” (see Schimmel, 1975, Chapter 2), and the Jewish\nkabbalist, Isaac of Acre (b. 1291?), who wrote of the soul being\nabsorbed into God “as a jug of water into a running well.”\n(see Idel, 1988, p. 67.) Also, the Hasidic master, R. Shneur Zalman of\nLiady (1745–1812) wrote of a person as a drop of water in the\nocean of the Infinite with an illusory sense of individual\n“dropness.” And, the (heretical) Christian mystic, Meister\nEckhart (c. 1260–1327/8) made what looked very much like\nidentity-declarations (see McGinn, 2001 and Smith, 1997). It is still\ncontroversial, however, as to when such declarations are to be taken\nas identity assertions, with pantheistic or acosmic intentions, and\nwhen they are perhaps hyperbolic variations on descriptions of\nunion-type experiences. \n\nIn theurgic (from the Greek theourgia) mysticism a mystic\nintends to activate the divine in the mystical experience. (See Shaw,\n1995, p. 4.) Thus, a Christian mystic who intends to activate\nGod’s grace, is involved in theurgy. Nonetheless, while\ntypically theistic mystics claim experience of God’s activity,\nmany do not claim this to result from their own endeavors, while\nothers refrain from declaring the activation of the divine as the\npurpose of their mystical life. So they are not involved in theurgic\nactivity. The Jewish Kabbalah is the most prominent form of theurgic\nmysticism. In it, the mystic aims to bring about a modification in the\ninner life of the Godhead (see Idel, 1988). \n\nApophatic mysticism (from the Greek,\n“apophasis,” meaning negation or “saying\naway”) is contrasted with kataphatic mysticism (from\nthe Greek, “kataphasis,” meaning affirmation or\n“saying with”). Apophatic mysticism, put roughly, claims\nthat nothing positive can be said about objects or states of affairs\nwhich the mystic experiences.  These are absolutely indescribable, or\n“ineffable.” The next section deals with the topic of\nineffability. So, apophatic theology typically will be negative\ntheology, that we can say only what God is not.  Kataphatic mysticism\ndoes make claims about what the mystic experiences. Pertaining to God,\nthis means that God can be described by positive terms. Analytic\nphilosophers of mysticism have been working largely with kataphatic\nconceptions. (But for an exception see Alston 2005 in the Other\nInternet Resources.)  \n\nAn example of apophatic mysticism is in the classical Tao text,\nTao Te Ching, attributed to Lao Tsu (6th century\nB.C.E.), which begins with the words, “Even the finest teaching\nis not the Tao itself. Even the finest name is insufficient to define\nit. Without words, the Tao can be experienced, and without a name, it\ncan be known.” (Lao Tsu, 1984). Applied to God, apophatic\nmysticism maintains that the experience of God can be described only\nby saying what God is not. Pertaining to God, kataphatic mysticism\nsays that God can be described by positive terms. The two need not be\nexclusive but represent two stages, respectively, in mystical\ncontemplation. \n\nWilliam James, (James, 1958, 292–93) deemed\n“ineffability” or indescribability an essential mark of the\nmystical. It is not always clear, however, whether it is the experience\nor its alleged object, or both, that are to be ineffable. A logical\nproblem with ineffability was noted long ago by Augustine, “God\nshould not be said to be ineffable, for when this is said something is\nsaid. And a contradiction in terms is created, since if that is\nineffable which cannot be spoken, then that is not ineffable which is\ncalled ineffable” (Augustine, 1958, pp. 10–11). To say that\nX is ineffable is to say something about X,\nwhich contravenes ineffability. This problem has been raised anew by\nAlvin Plantinga (Plantinga, 1980, 23–25) and Keith Yandell \n(Yandell, 1975). \n\nSeveral responses to this problem are possible for the mystic. One is\nto avoid speech altogether and remain silent about what is revealed in\nexperience. Mystics, however, have not been very good at this. A\nsecond possibility is to say that an ineffable object has no\nphenomenological properties but has non-phenomenological properties\n(Jones, 2016). A third is to distinguish first-order from second-order\nattributions, where “ineffability” is a second-order term\nsolely about first-order terms. To say, then, that something is\n“ineffable” would be to assert that it could not be\ndescribed by any first-order terms, “ineffability” not\nbeing one of them. A third possibility is to say that\n“X is ineffable” is really a statement about the\nterm ‘X,’ saying about it that it fails\nto refer to any describable entity. A fourth possibility lies in the\nongoing negation of whatever is said about X, ad\ninfinitum, in an infinite\n“unsaying” or taking back of what has been said (See Sells,\n1994, Chapter 1). \n\nAn example of unsaying can be found in the endless negations in some\nMadyamika and Zen Buddhist meditative consciousness. Since the\ntruth about reality – as it is – lies outside of our\nconceptualizations of it, we cannot say that truth, only\nexperience it. Hence, when we say, “Reality is not\nreality,” that is, that reality as it is differs from what we\ntake it to be conceptually, we must also say that “Reality is not\n- not reality.” Otherwise we will have been caught in\nconceptualizing about reality (saying about it that it is not what our\nconceptualizations say it is). We must then immediately negate the\nlatter saying by saying that reality is neither not-reality nor not\nnot-reality. And so on. (See Thich Nhat Hanh, 1994, Chapter 5.) A\nsecond, theistic, example of this approach is in the negative theology\nof (Pseudo) Dionysius (c.500) for whom God was “a most\nincomprehensible absolute mystery,” about which we can only say\nwhat it is not. Such continuing negation points beyond discourse to\nexperience. \n\nA fifth possibility is William Alston’s observation that when mystics talk about ‘indescribability’ they refer to the\ndifficulty of describing in literal terms, rather than by metaphor,\nanalogy, and symbols.(Alston, 1991) \n\nThe sixth solution to ineffability would come from Richard Gale (1960)\nand Ninian Smart (1958, 69) each of whom have argued that\n‘ineffability’ is (merely) an honorific title marking the\nvalue and intensity of an experience for a mystic. Similarly, Wayne\nProudfoot argues that the ineffability-claim is not describing but\nprescribing that no language system shall be applicable to it, and so\nserves to create and maintain a protective sense of mystery\n(Proudfoot, 1985, 125–27). However, experiences of things\nineffable exist in art and music (see Gallope 2017), as well as in\neveryday experience. Think of the impossibility of describing the\ntaste of coffee to someone who has never tasted it. (King, 1988). This\ndiminishes the argument that ascriptions of ineffability are aimed at\nprotective strategies.\n  \n\nSome philosophers think that a stress on ineffability signifies an\nattempt to consign mysticism to the “irrational,” thus\nexcluding it from more sensible human pursuits. Grace Jantzen has\nadvanced a critique of the emphasis on ineffability as an attempt to\nremove mystical experiences from the realm of rational discourse,\nplacing them instead into the realm of the emotions (Jantzen, 1995, p.\n344). Others have staunchly defended the “rationality” of\nmysticism against charges of irrationalism (Staal, 1975). The issue of\nineffability is thus tied into questions of the epistemic value of\nmystical experiences, to be discussed below in section 8.  \n\nScholars of mysticism sometimes stress the “paradoxical”\nnature of mystical experiences. We can discern four relevant senses of\n‘paradoxical’: (1) According to its etymology,\n‘paradoxical’ refers to what is surprising or\n“contrary to expectation.” (2) Language can be\nintentionally ‘paradoxical’ in using a logically improper\nform of words to convey what is not intended to be logically absurd.\nThis may be for rhetorical effect or because of difficulty in\nconveying a thought without resort to linguistic tricks. (3) As in\nphilosophy, a ‘paradox’ can involve an unexpected logical\ncontradiction, as in the “Liar Paradox.” (4) Walter Stace\nsees paradoxality as a universal feature of mystical experiences,\nequating ‘paradoxality’ with an intended logical\ncontradiction (Stace, 1961, 212. See section 4 below). \n\nInsofar as mystical experience is out of the ordinary, and the unitive\nquality strange (for ordinary folk, at least), reports of them may\nvery well be surprising or contrary to expectation. (Mystics, though,\nmight in time find their experiences to be expected.) Hence, they may(\nbe paradoxical in sense (1). Reports of mystical experiences may be\nparadoxical also in sense (2), because at times mystical language does\nassume logically offensive forms, when actual absurdity may not be\nintended. However, paradox in this sense occurs less frequently in\nfirst-hand reports of mystical experiences and more in second-order\nmystical systems of thought (Moore, 1973, and Staal, 1975). \nThere is no good reason for thinking that reports of mystical\nexperience must imply logical absurdity, as in (3) or (4). As we have seen above, while\nthere do occur forms of expression that are contradictory, the\ncontradiction is often removed by the device of “unsaying”\nor canceling out, which propels the discourse into a non-discursive\nrealm. \n\nThe attempt to designate mystical experiences as paradoxical in\nsenses (3) and (4) may result from being too eager to take logically\ndeviant language at its most literal. For example, Zen Buddhism speaks\nof reaching a state of mind beyond both thought and\n“no-thought.” However, rather than referring to a middle\nstate, neither thought nor no-thought, often the intention is to point\nto a state of mind in which striving is absent, and labeling of mental\nactivities ceases. The mind of “no effort” strives neither\nfor thought nor for no-thought. No logical absurdity infects this\ndescription. In a different direction, Frits Staal has argued that\nparadoxical mystical language has been used systematically to make\nlogically respectable claims (Staal, 1975). While mystics use much\nliteral language in describing their experiences (see Alston, 1992,\n80–102), the literality need not extend to paradox in senses (3) or\n(4).  Philosophers have differed over the nature of mystical experiences\nregarding what extent mystical content is putatively\n“given” to the mystic or rather constructed by the mystic\nin accordance with the social-mystical tradition in which he or she is\nembedded. The next three sections present this debate among\nphilosophers of mysticism.  \n\nVarious philosophers, sometimes dubbed “perennialists,”\nhave attempted to identify common mystical experiences across cultures\nand traditions (see Huxley, 1945 and Schuon, 1975). Such a position has\noccurred in psychological studies as well (Taves and Asprem, 2017).\nWalter Stace’s perennialism has generated much discussion\n(Stace, 1960, 1961). Stace proposes two mystical experiences found\n“in all cultures, religions, periods, and social\nconditions.” He identifies a universal extrovertive\nexperience that “looks outward through the senses” to\napprehend the One or the Oneness of all in or through the multiplicity\nof the world, apprehending the “One” as an inner life or\nconsciousness of the world. The Oneness is experienced as a sacred\nobjective reality, in a feeling of “bliss” and\n“joy.” Stace’s universal extrovertive experience (or\nthe experienced reality, it is not always clear which) is paradoxical,\nand possibly ineffable (Stace, 1961, 79). \n\nSecondly, Stace identifies a universal, “monistic,”\nintrovertive experience that “looks inward into the\nmind,” to achieve “pure consciousness,” that is, an\nexperience phenomenologically not of anything (Stace, 1961, 86). Stace\ncalls this a “unitary consciousness.” Some have called\nthis a “Pure Conscious Event” or “PCE”\n(Forman, 1993b and 1999. See section 6 below). A PCE consists of an\n“emptying out” by a subject of all experiential content\nand phenomenological qualities, including concepts, thoughts, sense\nperception, and sensuous images. The subject allegedly remains with\n“pure” wakeful consciousness. Like his extrovertive\nexperience, Stace’s universal introvertive experience involves a\nblissful sense of sacred objectivity, and is paradoxical and possibly\nineffable. Stace considers the universal introvertive experience to be\na ripening of mystical awareness beyond the halfway house of the\nuniversal extrovertive consciousness. Jones (2018) argues for\nextrovertive experiences not being merely stunted introvertive ones,\nbut full experiences in their own right. Marshall (2005) has developed\na detailed phenomenology of extrovertive experiences.  \n\nStace assimilates theistic mystical experiences to his universal\nintrovertive experience by distinguishing between experience and\ninterpretation. The introvertive experience, says Stace, is the same\nacross cultures. Only interpretations differ. Theistic mystics are\npressured by their surroundings, says Stace, to put a theistic\ninterpretation on their introvertive experiences. Ninian Smart also\nmaintained the universality of the monistic experience, arguing that\ndescriptions of theistic mystical experiences reflect an interpretive\noverlay upon an experiential base common to both theistic and\nnon-theistic experiences (Smart, 1965).  The psychologist, Ralph\nHood, has argued extensively that psychometric studies provide\n“strong empirical support” for “the common core\nthesis” of mystical experience (Hood, 2006). \n\nStace has been strongly criticized for simplifying or distorting\nmystical reports (For a summary, see Moore, 1973,) and for failing to\nproperly describe the difference between extrovertive and introvertive\nexperiences (for example, Almond, 1982, chapter 4). For example, Pike\ncriticizes the Stace-Smart position because in Christian mysticism\nunion with God is divided into discernible phases, which find no basis\nin Christian theology. These phases, therefore, plausibly reflect\nexperience and not forced interpretation (Pike, 1992, Chapter 5). \n\nIn contrast to Stace, R. C. Zaehner identified three types of\nmystical consciousness: (1) a “panenhenic” extrovertive\nexperience, an experience of oneness of nature, one’s self included,\n(2) a “monistic” experience of an undifferentiated unity\ntranscending space and time, and (3) theistic experience where there is\na duality between subject and the object of the experience (Zaehner,\n1961). Zaehner thought that theistic experience was an advance over the\nmonistic, since the latter, he thought, expressed a self-centered\ninterest of the mystic to be included in the ultimate.  \n\nWilliam Wainwright has described four modes of mystical extrovertive\nexperience: a sense of the unity of nature, of nature as a living\npresence, a sense that everything transpiring in nature is in an\neternal present, and the Buddhist unconstructed experience. Wainwright,\nlike Zaehner, distinguishes two mystical introvertive experiences, one\nof pure empty consciousness, and theistic experience marked by an\nawareness of an object in “mutual love” (Wainwright, 1981,\nChapter 1). \n\nMuch philosophical disagreement has taken place over questions\nconcerning PCEs, allegedly an “emptying out” by a subject\nof all experiential content and phenomenological qualities, including\nconcepts, thoughts, sense perception, and sensuous images. Do such\nevents ever really occur, and if they do, how significant are they in\nmysticism? Defenders of PCEs depend on alleged references to pure\nconsciousness in the mystical literature. One striking example is the\nBuddhist philosopher, Paramaartha (499–569), who stated explicitly that\nall of our cognitions were “conditioned” by our concepts\nsave for the non-sensory “unconditioned” Buddhist\nexperience of emptiness (see Forman, 1989). Another example cited is\nfrom the writings of the Christian mystic Meister Eckhart that describe\na “forgetting” that abandons concepts and sense experience\nto sink into a mystical “oblivion” (Forman, 1993a). In\naddition, Robert Forman has testified to a PCE he himself endured,\ndescribing it as an empty consciousness from which one “need not\nawake” (Forman, 1993b). \n\nHere is a sampling of important criticisms of the defense of Pure\nConscious Events (PCEs): (1) Reports of PCEs found in the literature\nmay not be decisive in establishing the occurrence of PCEs. We should\nsuspect the phenomenon of “idealization” in these reports.\nIdealization occurs when an ideal goal is presented as achieved, when\nit wasn’t. Whether or not pure consciousness ever occurs, we should\nsuspect it might be presented as though it did because strived for\nby the mystic. (2) The PCE defenders exaggerate the centrality of\ncomplete emptying out in mysticism. It is questionable if it is central\nin the mainstream of Christian mysticism, for example, where typically\nthe mystic forgets all else only to better contemplate God. Typical is\nthe Christian mystic Jan Ruysbroeck who wrote that emptying oneself is\nbut a prelude to the mystical life of contemplating God through an act\nof Divine grace (Zaehner, 1961, 170–71). Likewise, the “shedding\nof corporeality” in early Hasidism was meant, for example, to\nenable the mystic to contemplate the unified supernal structure of the\ndivine sefirot. And the Zen master, Dogen (1200–1253), wrote\nabout “wrongly thinking that the nature of things will appear\nwhen the whole world we perceive is obliterated” (Dogen, 1986,\n39). (3) Accordingly, reports of “emptying out” and\n“forgetting” may refer only to an emptying of ordinary\nexperiential content, making room for an extraordinary content. This\naccords well with the conception of ayin (nothingness) in\nJewish mysticism, which is positively saturated with divine reality\n(Matt, 1997). Some have claimed that even for Meister Eckhart\n“emptying out” is having one’s mind on no object other than\nGod, rather than an absolute emptiness of content (Matt, 1997). (4)\nThe Islamic Sufi fana experience (“passing away”)\nis sometimes described as an unconscious state, and the Sufi might\nbecome purely unconscious upon finding God, in wajd (Schimmel,\n1975, 178–79). Therefore, an emptying out might sometimes simply be\npure unconsciousness. (5) Even if a subject honestly reports\non a pure conscious episode, there may have been conceptual events the\nsubject either repressed or experienced in a nebulous way (see\nWainwright, 1981, 117–119). These latter simply do not remain for\nmemory.  \n\nConstructivism stands against perennialism. ‘Constructivism’ underscores the conceptual\n“construction” of mystical experience. Let us call\n‘soft constructivism’ the view that there is no mystical\nexperience without at least some concepts, provided by one’s cultural\nconditioning, concepts being what “construct” an\nexperience. Let us call ‘hard constructivism’ the view\nthat a mystic’s specific cultural background massively constructs\n— determines, shapes, or influences — the nature of\nmystical experiences (See Hollenback, 1996, Jones, 1909, Introduction,\nand Katz, 1978 and 1983). On the assumption that mystical traditions\nare widely divergent, hard constructivism entails the denial of\nperennialism. Soft constructivism is strictly consistent with\nperennialism, however, since consistent with there being some\ntrans-cultural mystical experience involving concepts common across\nmystical traditions. Both hard and soft constructivist arguments have\nbeen mobilized against the existence of PCEs. \n\nHere is a sampling of soft constructivist arguments against PCE\ndefenders: (1) PCEs are impossible because of the “kind of\nbeings” that we are (Katz, 1978, 59). It is a fact about humans\nthat we can experience only with the aid of memory, language,\nexpectations, and conceptualizations. Therefore, we cannot have a\n“pure” awareness, empty of all content. (2) PCEs cannot be\n“experiences” (see Proudfoot, 1985, Chapter 4, and Bagger,\n1999, Chapter 4). We must distinguish, the claim goes, between an\n“event” and an “experience.” That X\nhas “an experience” E entails that X\nconceptualizes E. Hence, even if pure conscious events happen\nto occur, they do not count as “experiences” until the\nsubject conceptualizes them. At that moment, they cease to be\n“pure consciousness.” (3) A survey of mystical literature\nshows that typical mystical experiences are conceptual in nature and\nnot empty of concepts. (4) An epistemological objection: Subjects\ncould not know they had endured a PCE. They could not know this during\na PCE, because it is supposed to be empty of all conceptual content\n(Bagger, 1999, 102–3). A subject could not know this by remembering\nthe PCE, since there is supposed to be nothing to observe while it is\ngoing on, and hence nothing to remember. Neither could a subject\nsurmise that a PCE had transpired by remembering a\n“before” and an “after,” with an unaccounted\nfor middle. This would fail to distinguish a PCE from plain\nunconsciousness. Indeed, it seems to matter little whether a subject\nwho emerges with mystical insights underwent a PCE or was simply\nunconscious. (5) A second epistemological objection: Suppose a PCE has\noccurred and that a subject knows that, somehow. Still, there is a\nproblem of the relationship of a PCE to the subsequent claims to\nknowledge, such as when Eckhart purportedly grounds knowledge of the\nsoul and God as one, in a PCE (see Forman, 1993a). If in a PCE\nsubjects were empty of all experiential content, they could not claim\nto have had acquaintance of anything (Bagger, 1999, 102–3).  \n\nSeveral objections can be raised against the Soft Constructivist\nPosition: While our cultural sets shape our ordinary experience, there is\nno good reason why we could not enjoy experiences on a pre-conceptual\nlevel of awareness, especially through a regimen of training. Steven\nKatz, the author of this argument, notes our “most brutish,\ninfantile, and sensate levels” of experience when we were\ninfants (Katz, 1988, 755). It is hard to see why in principle we could\nnot retrieve such an unconceptualized level of experience. It makes little difference whether a PCE is called an\n“experience” or an “event.” A PCE occurs within\na wider experience of the subject, including the subject’s coming out\nof the PCE and assigning it meaning. Let this wider experience be the\n“experience” under discussion, rather than the PCE\nalone. Neuropsychological studies of mystical experience point to the\npossibility of events of pure consciousness. A theory by Eugene\nd’Aquili and Andrew Newberg (d’Aquili and Newberg, 1993 and 1999)\nclaims to account for PCEs by reference to occurrences in the brain\nthat cut off ordinary brain activity from consciousness. This theory,\nif upheld, would provide physiological support for episodes of pure\nconsciousness (for more on this theory see section 8.7.1.) There need be no problem about mystics knowing they had\nPCEs. If we accept a reliabilist account of knowledge, a belief is\nknowledge if produced by a reliable cognitive mechanism (perhaps with\nsome further conditions). In order to have knowledge, a person does\nnot have to be aware of and judge evidence, nor be cognizant of the\nreliability of the mechanism that produces the knowledge. Hence,\n“awakening” from (what is in fact) a PCE, if it produces\nthe belief that one has “awakened” from a PCE, could be a\nreliable cognitive mechanism sufficient for knowing one had had a PCE.\nIf we stick to an evidentialist conception of knowledge, mystics might\nbe able to have evidence they had endured a PCE, though not at the\nprecise time of its occurrence. Here’s how: (a) By hypothesis, a\nPCE is an event of conscious awareness. (b) A conscious event can have\nelements one does not note at the time, but recalls afterward. This is\nespecially possible when the recall immediately follows the event. (c)\nTherefore, it should be possible for a mystic who endures a PCE to\nrecall immediately afterward the very awareness that was present in\nthe PCE, even though that awareness was not an object of consciousness\nat the time of the PCE. Since the recall takes place just following a\nPCE, the entire complex becomes enfolded into one recognizable\n“experience” of the mystic, for which the mystic has\nevidence. Defenders of PCEs can champion their epistemological significance,\nalthough PCEs are not of anything. Recall that the noetic\nquality of a mystical experience can come from an acquaintance of\nstates of affairs involving an insight directly, without supervening on\nacquaintance of any reality (see Section 1.1, clause (5)). In addition,\nan experience is mystical as long as it allegedly grants such an\nacquaintance. Neither need the insight be exactly simultaneous with\nwhat makes the experience mystical. Hence, a person could undergo a\nPCE, which then granted acquaintance of states of affairs by a direct\ninsight. The PCE plus the insight would constitute a complex mystical\nexperience that afforded awareness of a state of affairs not otherwise\naccessible. \n\nHard Constructivism’s main argument against any perennialism, not\nonly against defenders of PCEs, may be presented as follows (Katz,\n1978): \n\nPremise (A): The conceptual scheme a mystic possesses massively\ndetermines, shapes, or influences the nature of the mystical\nexperience. \n\nPremise (B): Mystics of different mystical traditions possess\npervasively different conceptual schemes. \n\nConclusion: Therefore, there cannot be a common experience across\ncultural traditions. That is, perennialism is false. \n\nThe hard constructivist denies the distinction between experience and\ninterpretation, since our conceptual apparatus massively shapes our\nvery experience. Regarding Premise (B), Katz has edited a massive\nvolume with the aim of displaying the stark differences between\nmystical experiences of different traditions, due to\nlinguistic,cultural, religious, and sociological factors (Katz,\n2013). \nFirst cousin to this objection is the objection that theistic\nexperiences in particular are theory-laden, their interpretation as\ntheistic a result of being embedded in a propensity to think\ntheistically. That is why, allegedly, such experiences are rarely\nreported by those not already theists or in theistic communities. Such\nexperiences, then, are “polluted”by theory (Oppy, 2006,p. 350). \n\nThis section summarizes objections against hard constructivism that\nare not objections to soft constructivism as well. It seems quite possible for subjects in the first instance to apply\n“thin” descriptions to experiences, involving only a small\npart of their conceptual schemes. Only on second thought, perhaps, will\nthey elaborate on their experience in terms of the richness of their\nhome culture. This would be like a physician with a headache, who\nexperiences pain in the first instance just like ordinary folk and only\nsubsequently applies medical terminology to the headache (Compare King,\n1988). If so, there is a possibility of common first-instance mystical\nexperiences across cultures, contrary to Premise A. Premise A is thrown into further doubt by expressions of\nsurprise by mystics-in-training about what they experience (see\nGellman, 1997, 145–46 and Barnard, 1997, 127–130), as well\nas by heretical types of experience occurring with mystics\nacculturated in orthodox teachings, such as Meister Eckhart and Jacob\nBoehme (See Stoeber, 1992, 112–113).  These illustrate the\npossibility of getting out from under one’s mystical background to\nhave new experiences. Likewise, hard constructivism’s inherently\nconservative take on mysticism will struggle to explain\ntransformations within mystical traditions, and cannot easily account\nfor innovative geniuses within mystical traditions. George Wall has\nreplied regarding religious experience by pointing out how\nindividualistic such experiences can be. A person might have a Jesus\nexperience at one time and a Buddhist one at another time (Wall, 1995,\np. 302).  Two people walk together down the street and see an approaching\ndog. One experiences the dog as “Jones’s favorite black terrier\nthat came in second in last year’s competition,” while the other\nexperiences it as “a stray mutt that the dog-catchers should take\naway.” Because of the excessive conceptual differences in their\nexperiencing, the constructivist would have to insist that there was no\nworthwhile sense in which both dog-sighters had the same experience.\nHowever, there is an interesting sense in which they are having the\nsame experience: seeing that black dog at that place, at that time.\nSimilarly, there might exist an interesting commonality of experiences\nacross mystical traditions, most plausibly theistic ones, despite\nconceptual disparity. The conceptual differences might not be\nsufficient to deny this important commonality (see Wainwright, 1981,\n25). Specific cultural conditioning does not influence everyone to the\nsame degree and in the same way. Individuals have rich and varied\npersonal histories that influence their experiential lives in widely\ndiffering ways. Some accept cultural restraints gladly; others rebel\nagainst them; still others are blessed with a creative spirit, etc. A\n“fat people must drive fat cows” approach to mysticism\nfails to mirror the complex human phenomenon of acculturation. Mystical traditions characteristically involve disciplines aimed at\nloosening the hold of one’s conceptual scheme on subsequent experience.\nTechniques practiced for years promote a pronounced inhibition of\nordinary cognitive processes, sometimes called\n“deautomization” (Deikman, 1980). This plausibly restricts\nthe influence of one’s cultural background on one’s mystical\nexperiences, in turn making possible identical experiences across\nmystical traditions. The hard constructivist over-emphasizes the influence of\npre-mystical religious teaching on the mystic’s experience. Mystical\nexperiences can circle around and reinvent meaning for the doctrines.\nAn example is the Jewish Kabbalistic transformation of the notion of\nmitzvah (“commandment”) to that of\n“joining” or “connection” with God. Starting\nwith commandment, the mystic ends up with devekut,\n“clinging” to God. Hard Constructivism fails to account well for widely differing\nmystical understandings of the same religious text. For example, the\nHindu text, The Brahma Sutra, is monistic for Shankara\n(788–820), a “qualified dualism” for Ramanuja (c.\n1055–1137), and yet again a strict dualism, for Madhva\n(1199–1278) (see Radhakrishnan, Introduction, 1968). Likewise,\nthe teaching of emptiness in the Buddhist text the Prajnaparamita\nHrydaya Sutra (The Heart Sutra), receives quite\ndisparate unpacking in different streams of Buddhism. It’s plausible\nto conclude that distinct experiences were responsible, at least in\npart, for these differences. \n\nOn the one hand, talk about mystical experiences “the\nsame” across all mystical traditions should be taken with a\ntablespoon of salt, if scholars claim to have discovered them solely\nfrom isolated descriptions of experiences. It is difficult to assess\nthe nature of an experience without attending to how it\n“radiates” out into the structure of the local mystical\ntheory and life of which it is a part (See Idel, 1997). Nevertheless,\nit does seem possible to generalize about experiences “similar\nenough” to be philosophically interesting. \n“Inherentists” believe that there are experiences\ninherently religious or mystical. These experiences come with their\nreligious or mystical content built in as would redness be built in to\na sense experience.  Attributionists believe that there are no\ninherently religious or mystical experiences. There are only deemed\nreligious by the subject or a group. Among their ranks is to be\ncounted William James. A leading attributionist, Ann Taves, contends\nthat first people or groups will have experiences of what strikes them\nas being “special.” Only then, depending on various\nfactors will they attribute a religious or mystical meaning to them.\n(Taves, 2009) Some neuropsychological studies seem to support this\nposition. (Azari, et al, 2001). Taves is thus as much an\nanti-constructivist as she is anti-inherentist. The constructivist\nsees religious or mystical experiences to be constituted from the very\nstart by cultural conditioning. The attributionist denies this, in\nfavor of a tiered or “block-building” approach from\nexperiencing something “special” to a religious or\nmystical conclusion.  William Forgie has argued, as would an\nattributionist, that there could not be an experience “of\nGod,” if we understand experience “of X” to\nmean that it is phenomenologically given that the experience is\nof X (Forgie, 1984, 1994). Forgie argues that\nphenomenological content can consist of general features only, and not\nfeatures specifically identifying God as the object of experience. He\ncompares this to your seeing one of two identical twins. Which one of\nthe two you perceive cannot be a phenomenological given. Likewise,\nthat you experience precisely God and not something else cannot be\na phenomenological datum.  Nelson Pike argues, against\nForgie, that the individuation of an object can be a component of the\nphenomenological content of an experience, drawing on examples from\nsense perception (Pike 1992, Chapter 7). \n\nBoth philosophers restrict experiences of God to phenomenal content\nsomehow analogous to sense perception. This might be a\nmistake. Consider, for example, that God could appear to a person\nmystically, and at the same time transmit, telepathy-like, the thought\nthat this was God appearing. Imagine further that this thought had the\nflavor of being conveyed to one from the outside, rather than as\noriginating in the subject. The thought that “This is God\nappearing” would be part of the phenomenological content of the\nsubject’s present (complex) experience (though not part of the\nmystical mode of the experience as defined in section 1.1), and yet\nnot be the product of an interpretation by the subject.  \n\nIn his celebrated, The Varieties of Religious Experience\n(London 1925, p. 415), Williams James, asked, “Do mystical states\nestablish the truth of those theological affections in which the\nsaintly life has its roots?” This question can be divided into\ntwo: (Q1) Is a person warranted in thinking that his or her experiences\nare veridical or have evidential value? And (Q2) Are “we,”\nwho do not enjoy mystical experiences, upon examining the evidence of\nsuch experiences, warranted in thinking them veridical or endowed with\nevidential value? While related, these questions can be treated\nseparately. \n\nThe major philosophical reply in the affirmative to (Q1) may be\ncalled the “Doxastic Practice Approach.” The major defense\nof an affirmative reply to (Q2) may be called the “Argument from\nExperience.” \n\nWilliam Alston has defended beliefs a person forms based on mystical\nand numinous (in the terminology of this entry) experience,\nspecifically of a theistic kind (Alston, 1991, 100). Alston defines a\n‘doxastic practice’ as consisting of socially established\nways of forming and epistemically evaluating beliefs (the\n“output”) from a certain kind of content from various\ninputs, such as cognitive and perceptual ones (Alston, 1991, 100,\nAlston 2005, chapters 9–11). The practice is beholden to an\n“over-rider system” which is a background system of\nbeliefs against which beliefs supported by the practice are checked\nfor possible over-riders. The practice of forming physical-object\nbeliefs based on sense perception is an example of a ‘doxastic\npractice’ and the practice of drawing deductive conclusions from\npremises is another. Now, Alston argues that the justification of\nevery doxastic practice is “epistemically circular,” that\nis, its reliability cannot be established in any way independent of\nthe practice itself (see Alston, 1993). This includes the\n“sense-perception practice.” However, we cannot avoid\nengaging in doxastic practices. Therefore, Alston contends, it is a\nmatter of practical rationality to engage in the doxastic\npractices we do engage in providing there is no good reason to think\nthey are unreliable.   Now, there are doxastic practices consisting of forming beliefs\nabout God, God’s purposes for us, and the like, grounded on religious\nand mystical experiences such as “God is now appearing to\nme.” Such, for example, is the “Christian Doxastic\nPractice.” This practice has an over-rider system consisting of\nscriptures and Christian dogma. The over-rider system also includes\nguidelines resulting from the past history of the mystical Christian\nDoxastic Practice. It follows from Alston’s argument that it is\nrational for a person in such a practice to take its belief outputs as\ntrue unless the practice is shown to be unreliable. Thus we have an\naffirmative answer to question (Q1). \nMost objections to Alston are equally objections to the Argument from\nExperience (to be presented below) or come from general\nepistemological complaints. The latter will not occupy us\nhere. Objections that apply to Alston only, include Jonathan Kvanvig’s\nfaulting of Alston for a loose employment of\n“rationality.” Kvanvig argues that no one meaning of that\nterm can do the work Alston does with it (Kvanvig, 1994). Another\nobjection is that Alston moves from “It is practically rational\nto engage in a Christian doxastic practice” to: “It is\nrational for me to believe the Christian doxastic practice is\nreliable.” However, it is quite possible to be practically\nrational to engage in a doxastic practice while failing to believe it\nis reliable. This was David Hume’s attitude to sense perception. Hume\ncould not help engaging in the sense-perception practice, and thought\nit was practically rational to do so. But it was not the case that\nHume thought the sense-perception practice reliable (Matthias Steup,\n1997).  Others argue that there is a problem with the construction of the\nover-rider system of the Christian mystical practice. This is because\nthe guidelines gleaned from the history of the practice, so it is\nargued, were compromised by androcentric bias and outdated scientific\nbeliefs. These detract from the practice’s epistemic\nlegitimacy (Gellman, 2011). (See Section 9 below.) It is also a\nquestion whether the Christian doxastic practice approach is able to\njustify conversion experiences. In such experiences the subject is not\nyet Christian and cannot employ the Christian over-rider system when\nbecoming convinced to accept the Christian practice and its over-rider\nsystem.  \n\nVarious philosophers have defended the evidential value, to one\ndegree or another, of some religious and mystical experiences,\nprincipally with regard to experiences of God (see Baillie, 1939,\nBroad, 1953, Davis, 1989, Gellman, 1997 and 2001a, Gutting, 1982,\nSwinburne, 1991 and 1996, Wainwright, 1981, and Yandell, 1993). These\nphilosophers have stressed the “perceptual” nature of\nexperiences of God. We can summarize the approach as follows: Experiences of God have a subject-object structure, with a\nphenomenological content allegedly representing the object of the\nexperience. Also, subjects are moved to make truth claims based on such\nexperiences. Furthermore, there are mystical procedures for getting\ninto position for a mystical experience of God (see Underhill, 90–94),\nand others can take up a suitable mystical path to try to check on the\nsubject’s claims (see Bergson 1935, 210). In all these ways,\nexperiences of God are perceptual in nature. Such experiences count as (at least some) evidence in\nfavor of their own validity. That a person seems to experience some\nobject is some reason to think he or she really does have experiential\ncontact with it. So, experiences of God count as (at least some)\nevidence in favor of their own validity. Agreement between experiences of people in different places,\ntimes, and traditions, enhances the evidence in favor of their validity\n(see Broad, 1953). Hence, agreement about experiences of God in diverse\ncircumstances enhances the evidence in their favor.   Further enhancement of the validity of a religious or mystical\nexperience can come from appropriate consequences in the life of the\nperson who had the experience, such as increased saintliness (See\nWainwright, 1981, 83–88). (1)–(4) yield initial evidence in favor of the validity of\n(some) experiences of God. \n\nKai-Man Kwan has developed this type of argument further by specifying\ntheistic experience, in particular, as a “well-established type of\nexperience.” The tokens of such a type of experience occur to many\npeople and on repeated occasions, have a common ontology, and are\ncommunicable in a coherent conceptual framework. This strengthens an\nargument from experience for theistic experience (Kwan, 2012,\np. 511).  Whether any experiences of God are veridical in the final reckoning\nwill depend on the strength of the initial evidential case, on other\nfavorable evidence, and on the power of counter-considerations against\nvalidity. Defenders of the Argument from Experience differ over the\nstrength of the initial evidential case and have defended the staying\npower of the Argument against counter-evidence to\nvarying degrees. All agree, however in advancing a positive answer to\nquestion (Q2).  \n\nSeveral philosophers have argued against either the doxastic\npractice approach or the Argument from Experience, or both (see Bagger\n1999, Fales, 1996a, 1996b, and 2001, Gale, 1991, 1994, and 1995, C.B.\nMartin, 1955, Michael Martin, 1990, Proudfoot, 1985, and Rowe, 1982).\nHere the focus will be on objections related specifically to mystical\nand numinous experience, rather than to general epistemological\ncomplaints, \n\nPhilosophers have disputed the Argument from Experience on the\ngrounds of alleged disanalogies between experiences of God and sense\nperception. Two issues must be examined: (a) whether the disanalogies\nexist, and (b) if they do exist, whether they are epistemologically\nsignificant. \n\nThe analogy allegedly breaks down over the lack of appropriate\ncrosschecking procedures for experiences of God. With sense perception,\nwe can crosscheck by employing inductive methods to determine causally\nrelevant antecedent conditions; can “triangulate” an event\nby correlating it with other effects of the same purported cause; and\ncan discover causal mechanisms connecting a cause to its effects. These\nare not available for checking on experiences of God. Evan Fales argues\nthat “crosscheckability” is an integral part of any\nsuccessful perceptual epistemic practice. Therefore, the perceptual\nepistemic practice in which mystical experiences of God are embedded is\nseverely defective (Fales, 200) In addition, Richard Gale (1991),\nargues that in experiences of God there is missing agreement between\nperceivers as well as the possibility of checking whether the perceiver\nwas in the “right” position and psychological and\nphysiological state for a veridical experience. For similar reasons,\nC.B. Martin concludes that claims to have experienced God are\n“very close” to subjective claims like “I seem to see\na piece of paper” rather than to objective claims like “I\nsee a piece of paper” (C.B. Martin, 1955). \n\nWilliam Rowe observes that God may choose to be revealed to one\nperson and not to another. Therefore, unlike with sense perception, the\nfailure of others to have an experience of God under conditions similar\nto those in which one person did, does not impugn the validity of the\nexperience. Therefore, we have no way of determining when an experience\nof God is delusory. If so, neither can we credit an experience as\nauthentic (Rowe, 1982). \n\nSome philosophers have argued that there could never be evidence for\nthinking a person had perceived God (Gale, 1994 and 1995, and Byrne,\n2001). For there to be evidence that a person experienced an object O,\nand did not have just an “O-ish-impression,” it would have\nto be possible for there to be evidence that O was the common object of\ndifferent perceptions (not necessarily simultaneous with one another).\nThis, in turn, would be possible only if it were possible to\ndistinguish perceptions of O, specifically, from possible perceptions\nof other objects that might be perceptually similar to O. This latter\nrequirement is possible only if O exists in both space and time.\nSpace-time coordinates make it possible to distinguish O from objects\nof similar appearance existing in other space-time coordinates. God,\nhowever, does not exist in both space and time. Therefore, there could\nnever be evidence that a person had experienced God. \n\nAlthough Alston defends the perceptual character of\nmystical experiences of God for his doxastic practice approach, there\nis no restriction to the perceptual on the inputs of a doxastic\npractice. Any cognitive input will do. Hence, disanalogies between\nexperiences of God and sense perception, even if great, would not be\ndirectly harmful to this approach (Alston, 1994). \n\nRegarding the bearing of the alleged disanalogies on the Argument\nfrom Experience, the disanalogists take the evidential credentials of\nsense perception as paradigmatic for epistemology. They equate\nconfirming and disconfirming evidence with evidence strongly analogous\nto the kind available for sensory perception. However, the evidential\nrequirement should be only “confirming empirical evidence,”\nbe what it may. If God-sightings have confirming evidence, even if\ndifferent from the kind available for sense perception, they will then\nbe evidentially strengthened. If God-sightings do not have much\nconfirming empirical evidence, be it what it may, they will remain\nunjustified for that reason, and not because they lack crosschecks\nappropriate to sense perception. \n\nPerhaps the disanalogy proponents believe that justification of\nphysical object claims should be our evidential standard,\nbecause only where crosschecks of the physical object kind are\navailable do we get sufficient justification. However, our ordinary physical object beliefs are far over-supported\nby confirming evidence. We have extremely luxurious constellations of\nconfirming networks there. Hence, it does not follow that were mystical\nclaims justified to a lesser degree than that, or not by similar\nprocedures, that they would be unjustified. \n\nA problem with the argument from God’s lack of dimensionality is\nthat the practice of identifying physical objects proceeds by way of an\ninterplay between qualitative features and relative positions to\ndetermine both location and identity. The judgments we make reflect a\nholistic practice of making identifications of place and identity\ntogether. There is no obvious reason why the identification of God\ncannot take place within its own holistic practice, with its own\ncriteria of identification, not beholden to the holistic practice\ninvolved in identifying physical objects (See Gellman, 2001a, Chapter\n3, for a sketch of such a holistic practice). We should be suspicious\nof taking the practice of identifying physical objects as paradigmatic\nfor all epistemology. \n\nIn the end, the Argument from Experience might have to yield to the\nDoxastic Practice Approach. One reason is that it is doubtful if many\nexperiencers of God make truth claims solely on the basis of their\nmystical experiences, rather than within a doxastic practice. For\nexample, as Rowan Williams has commented concerning Teresa of Avila,\nshe would never have imagined that her experiences alone were\nsufficient evidence for any truth.  The criterion of authenticity for\nher experiences was how they related to subsequent concrete behavior,\nas judged by and within her religious practice. Mystical experience as\nsuch was given no special authority. Nelson Pike writes similarly\nabout John of the Cross that John thought that, “The private\nexperiences of individual mystics have no value whatsoever as sources\nof information”, and that “To treat them as such is to\nrisk a variety of pitfalls of considerable threat to the spiritual\nlife” (Pike, 1986, p. 16). \n\nA second reason why the Argument from Experience might have to yield\nto the Doxastic Practice Approach is that if, as noted in section 8.4,\nidentification of God takes place in an holistic practice, then quite\nplausibly this is a social practice in which one judges one’s mystical\nexperiences to be of God. Turning again to the example of\nTeresa, her experiences in themselves did not always give her assurance\nthat she was not experiencing the Devil rather than God. She\nadjudicated the issue from within the teachings of the Church. Finally,\nit is an open question to what extent alleged God-experiences are\nsufficiently detailed to provide grounds to the subject that they are\nof God. Hence, a subject’s judgment that a particular\nencounter is with God might well be the fruit of assimilating the\npresent event into a larger social practice. Recently, Gellman has\nargued that the Argument from Experience might just collapse into the\ndoxastic practice approach (Gellman, 2008).   \n\nA critique of the Argument from Experience for the epistemic value\nof theistic experiences comes from the facts of religious diversity.\nThis critique applies to non-theistic experiences as well. In the\nhistory of religions, we find innumerable gods, with different\ncharacteristics. Shall we say they all exist? Can belief in all of them\nbe rational? (Hick, 1989, 234–5) In addition, there are experiences of\nnon-personal ultimate realities, such as the Nirguna Brahman of Indian\nreligions. Nirguna Brahman cannot be an ultimate reality if God is\n(Hick, 1984, 234–5). The Argument from Experience cannot work for both,\nso works for neither. Furthermore, different theistic faiths claim\nexperience of the one and only God, ostensibly justifying beliefs that\nare in contradiction with one another (see Flew, 1966, 126). If the\nArgument from Experience leads to such contradictory results, it cannot\nprovide evidence in favor of the validity of experiences of God. \n\nIn reply to this objection, straight away we can discount\nexperiences of polytheistic gods because of their being embedded in\nbizarre, fantastic settings, and because of the relative paucity of\nreports of actual experiences of such beings. Regarding clashing\nexperiences within theistic settings, Richard Swinburne has proposed an\nascent to generality as a harmonizing mechanism. Swinburne believes\nthat conflicting descriptions of objects of religious experience pose a\nchallenge only to detailed claims, not to general claims of having\nexperienced a supernal being (Swinburne, 1991, 266). \n\nJohn Hick has proposed a “pluralistic hypothesis” to\ndeal with the problem of religious diversity (Hick, 1984, Chapter 14).\nAccording to the pluralistic hypothesis, the great world faiths embody\ndifferent perceptions and conceptions of one reality that Hick\nchristens “the Real.” The Real itself is never experienced\ndirectly, but has “masks” or “faces” which are\nexperienced, depending on how a particular culture or religion thinks\nof the Real. The Real itself is, therefore, neither personal nor\nimpersonal, these categories being imposed upon the Real by different\ncultural contexts. Hence, the typical experiences of the major faiths\nare to be taken as validly of the Real, through mediation by the local\nface of the Real. \n\nHick has been criticized for infidelity to the world’s religious\ntraditions. However, we should understand Hick to be providing a\ntheory about religions rather than an exposition of religions\nthemselves would endorse (for criticism of Hick see Gavin d’Costa,\n1987). Some propose harmonizing some conflicting experiences by\nreference to God’s “inexhaustible fullness” (Gellman, 1997,\nChapter 4). In at least some mystical experiences of God, a subject\nexperiences what is presented as proceeding from an intimation of\ninfinite plenitude. Given this feature, a claim to experience a\npersonal ultimate, for example, can be squared with an experience of an\nimpersonal ultimate: one “object,” identified as God or\nNirguna Brahman, can be experienced in its personal attributes or in\nits impersonal attributes, from out of its inexhaustible plenitude. \n\nWhether any of these solutions succeed, the body of experiential data is too\nlarge for us to simply scrap on the grounds of contradictory claims. We\nshould endeavor to retain as much of the conflicting data as possible\nby seeking some means of conciliation. \n\nBertrand Russell once quipped that “We can make no distinction\nbetween the man who eats little and sees heaven and the man who drinks\nmuch and sees snakes. Each is in an abnormal physical condition, and\ntherefore has abnormal perceptions” (Russell, 1935, 188). C.D.\nBroad wrote, to the contrary, “One might need to be slightly\n‘cracked’ in order to have some peep-holes into the\nsuper-sensible world” (Broad, 1939, 164). Thus is the issue\nengaged whether we can explain away religious and mystical experiences\nby reference to naturalistic causes. \n\n  Wainwright has argued that a naturalistic explanation is\ncompatible with the validity of an experience since God could bring\nabout an experience through a naturalistic medium (Wainwright, 1981,\nChapter 2). However, we should take into account that there might be\nnaturalistic explanations that would make it implausible that God would\nappear in just those ways (this is elaborated in section 8.7.2). \n\nVarious psychological naturalistic explanations of religious and\nmystical experience have been offered, including pathological\nconditions such as: hypersuggestibility, severe deprivation, severe\nsexual frustration, intense fear of death, infantile regression,\npronounced maladjustment, and mental illness, as well as\nnon-pathological conditions, including the inordinate influence of a\nreligious psychological “set” (see Davis, 1989, Chapter 8,\nand Wulff, 2000). In addition, some have advanced a sociological\nexplanation for some mysticism, in terms of the socio-political power\navailable to an accomplished mystic (Fales, 1996a, 1996b). \n\nNaturalistic proposals of these kinds exaggerate the scope and\ninfluence of the cited factors, sometimes choosing to highlight the\nbizarre and eye-catching at the expense of the more common occurrences.\nSecondly, some of the proposals, at least, are perfectly compatible\nwith the validity of experiences of God. For example, a person’s having\na religious psychological set can just as well be a condition for\nenjoying and being capable of recognizing an experience of God, as it\ncan be a cause of delusion. \n\nNeuropsychological research has been conducted to look for unique\nbrain processes involved in religious and mystical experiences,\nresulting in a number of competing theories (see Wulff, 2000). The\n“explaining away” enters when one claims that\n“It’s all in the head.” d’Aquili and Newberg\n(d’Aquili and Newberg 1993 and 1999), propose the prefrontal\narea of the brain as the locus of special brain activity during\nmystical episodes. Through “deafferentiation,” or cutting\noff of neural input to that area of the brain, they claim, an event of\npure consciousness occurs. The patterns set up in the brain create an\noverwhelming experience of “absolute unitary being.” If\nreinforcement of a certain hypothalamic discharge then occurs, this\nwill prolong the feeling of elation, and will be interpreted as an\nexperience of God. Otherwise, there will arise a deep peacefulness due\nto the dominance of specified hypothalamic structures.  This gets\ninterpreted as an experience of an impersonal, absolute ground of\nbeing. The theory associates numinous experiences with variations in\ndeafferentiation in various structures of the nervous system, and\nlesser religious experiences with mild to moderate stimulation of\ncircuits in the lateral hypothalamus. The latter generate religious\nawe: a complex of fear and exaltation (see d’Aquili and Newberg,\n1993, 195). The brain functions in related ways in aesthetic\nexperience as well (d’Aquili and Newberg, 2000). \n\nThe authors themselves do not say their theory shows there to be\nnothing objective to mystical or religious experience. However, they do\nrecommend explaining away objective differences between, for example,\ntheistic and non-theistic experiences. And their theory could be\nutilized in a “It’s all in the head” strategy. \n\nBatson, Schoenrade and Ventis (1993) maintain (comparing religious\nexperiences to creative problem solving) that a person who has a\nreligious experience faces an existential crisis, and attempts to\nsolve it within fixed cognitive structures, which are embedded in the\nbrain’s left-hemisphere. This yields no solution. The person may then\nundergo a transforming religious experience, in which the brain\ntemporarily switches from left-hemisphere to right-hemisphere\ndominance, from verbal/conceptual thinking to non-verbal insight\n“beyond” the person’s dominant conceptual structure. The\nswitch then reverberates back to restructure the left-hemisphere\nconceptual network, now made apt for dealing with the existential\ncrisis. The right-hemisphere switch can account for the sense of\n‘ineffability,’ since the right hemisphere is not analytic\nor verbal (See Fenwick 1996 and Michael Persinger et\nal. 1994). Because the shift involves “transcending”\nthe cognitive, it may explain the conviction of having contact with a\n“transcendent realm.” If offered as a naturalistic\n“explaining away,” this theory would imply that what a\nperson thinks is an experience of God, say, is really an experience of\ntemporary right-hemisphere dominance. The theory has the drawback,\nhowever, of applying only to conversion experiences, and not to other\nreligious and mystical episodes. \n\nOther theories that have attracted attention include one focusing on\nanomalous features of the temporal lobes of the brain, the locus for\nepileptic conditions (Persinger, et al 1987). One study even claims to\nhave discovered a correlation between temporal lobe epilepsy and\nsudden conversion experiences (Dewhurst and Beard, 1970). James\nAustin, a neurologist and himself a Zen practitioner, has developed a\ntheory of brain transformations for prolonged Zen meditative practice\n(Austin, 1998). The theory is based on gradual, complex changes in the\nbrain, leading to a blocking of our higher associative\nprocesses. Austin believes that the Zen kensho experience,\naccording to Austin an experience of reality “as it is in\nitself,” is an experience with (relatively) shut down neural\nactivity. McNamara advances that the amygdala creates\nreligious experience, including mystical experience, and implicates\nthe prefrontal cortex where religious excitement can be\nstimulated. (McNamara,2009, 93 and 109) Other theories exist as\nwell. For a review and good explanation of this topic see (Schjoedt,\n2009, esp. 325–327) \n\nThe variety of neuropsychological theories shows that the entire\nproject is in its infancy. The great variety counts against accepting\nany one theory at this time. (Jones, 2016). In addition, methods\ninvolved in deriving Neuropsychological explanations have been\nattacked as inadequate. This is especially true of the theories,\nrespectively, of Persinger and of d’Aquili and Newberg (See\nJones, 2016, 149–151; Sloan, 2006). Also, we must be careful to\ndetermine what the researcher’s conception is of mystical\nexperience.  \nA neuropsychological theory can do no more than relate what happens in\nthe brain when a mystical or religious experience occurs. It cannot\ntell us that the ultimate cause for a theory’s favored\nbrain-events was altogether internal to the organism.  On the other\nhand, such a theory could help rule out cases of suspected deception\nand block the identification of mystical experiences with mere\nemotion. True, there may not be out-of-brain\n“God-receptors” in the body, analogous to those for\nsensory perception, which might reinforce a suspicion that it’s\nall in the head. However, out-of-brain receptors are neither to be\nexpected nor required with non-physical stimuli, as in mystical\nexperiences. God, for example, does not exist at a physical distance\nfrom the brain.  Furthermore, God could act directly upon the brain to\nbring about the relevant processes for a subject to perceive God. \n\nOn the other hand, a neuropsychological theory would put pressure on\nclaims to veridical experiences, if it could point to brain processes\nimplausibly grounding a veridical experience. The implausibility would\nflow from a being of God’s nature wanting to make itself known by just\nthat way. Suppose, for (an outlandish) example, researchers convinced\nus that all and only alleged experiencers of God had a brain-defect\ncaused only by a certain type of blow to the shoulder to people with a\ngenetic propensity to psoriasis, and that the area of the defect was\nactivated in the experiences. This might not prove that experiences of\nGod were delusory, but would raise serious doubts. It is too early in\nthe research, however, to say that implausible brain conditions have\nbeen found for experiences of God. \n\nSome philosophers have argued that because the “modern\ninquirer” assumes everything ultimately explicable in\nnaturalistic terms, in principle we should reject any supernatural\nexplanation of mystical and religious experience (see Bagger, 1999).\nInvoking God to explain mystical experiences is like invoking miracles\nto explain natural phenomena. We should match our elimination of\nmiracles from our explanatory vocabulary with an elimination of a\nsupernatural explanation of mystical experiences of God. Hence, we do\nnot have to wait until we discover a live alternative explanation to\nthe theistic explanation of mystical experiences of God. We should\nresist a theistic explanation in the name of our epistemic standards.\nHence, we should reject both the doxastic practice approach and the\nArgument from Experience.   \n\nThis argument raises the important question of the relationship\nbetween theistic explanation and a naturalistic program of\nexplanation.  Various theistic philosophers have attempted to square\nspecial divine activity with a modern scientific understanding of the\nworld (see for example, Swinburne, 1989 and Plantinga, 2011). Whether\nthey have succeeded is a question beyond the scope of the present\nessay, however. Of course, a person for whom supernatural explanation\nis not a live option would have reason to reject the Argument from\nExperience and refuse to engage in a doxastic practice of identifying\nvalid God-experiences. However, most defenders of the Argument from\nExperience advance it at best as a defensible line of reasoning,\nrather than as a proof of valid experiences of God that should\nconvince anyone, and the doxastic practice approach is not meant to\nconvince everybody to participate in a theistic doxastic practice (see\nGellman, 2001b).  Kai-Man Kwan has significantly expanded the Argument from\nExperience in a way that avoids from the start several objections to\nthat argument (Kwan, 2011). Kwan argues for what he calls a\n“holistic empiricism,” which considers an array of\ndimensions of human experience: the noetic – consisting of\nepistemic seemings; the qualitative – the feel or tenor of what\nit is like to have the experience; and the volitional, of action,\nchoice, deliberation, and the like. Kwan argues that when judging the\ncredentials of religious experience, we should take into account the\nfollowing experiences, in addition to narrowly selected religious\nexperience: experiences of the natural world, of the self, existential\nexperience, interpersonal experience, moral experience, aesthetic\nexperience, and intellectual experience. Kwan argues that the integration, in the appropriate way, of these\ntypes of experience coherently and fruitfully constitutes a defeasible\njustification for relying on the product of religious belief. Kwan\nargues in this way for theistic belief in particular. A similar\nargument is forthcoming for judging narrowly construed mystical\nexperience. The unit of justification of believing a proposition when\nhaving had a mystical experience would be the entire holistic complex\nof the mystic’s experience. Going beyond, but including, discrete\nmystical episodes, the mystic is able to fashion a cumulative case for\nmystical conclusions.   If Kwan’s argument is sound, it avoids the objection based on\ndissimilarities between mystical and religious experiences, narrowly\nconsidered,on the one side, and sense experience on the other. The\nunit of justification, it turns out, encompasses far more than the\nmystical experience itself. Kwan also seems to neutralize objections\nfrom neuroscience against the validity of mystical experiences. Belief\nin the deliverances of mystical experience will seek justification far\nbeyond what can be possibly identified with a discrete, local brain\nanalogue to the mystical experience itself. \n\nSome feminist philosophers have criticized what they perceive as the\nandrocentric bias of male philosophers of mysticism. There are three\nmain objections: (1) Contemporary male philosophers treat mysticism as\nmost centrally a matter of the private psychological episodes of a\nsolitary person. Philosophers believe these private experiences reveal\nthe meaning and value of mysticism (Jantzen, 1994 and 1995). Instead,\nphilosophers should be studying the socio-political ramifications of\nmysticism, including its patriarchal failings. Sarah Coakley maintains\nthat the focus of mysticism should be on the ongoing contemplative\npractice and all that entails. (Coakley 2009). (2) At times. scholars\nof mysticism have systematically ignored or marginalized much of\nwomen’s mysticism. Closer attention to women would reveal the\nandrocentric bias in male mysticism (Jantzen, 1995). Nancy Caciola\n(2000, 2003) argues that the criteria the Church developed for\nauthentic mystical experiences curtailed the power of women in the\nChurch. For example, on the basis of theories about female physiology,\nwomen were deemed more vulnerable to devil possession than men. Hence\none was to be more suspicious that women are devil-possessed, and not\nGod-possessed, than about men. More recently, Coakley notes that while\nsome analytic philosophers attend to the mysticism of Teresa of Avila,\nthey do not do justice to the content of her mystical writings,\npicking out experiences only. (3) The traditional male construction of\nGod has determined the way male philosophers think of theistic\nexperience. Thus, theistic experience is conditioned from the outset\nby patriarchal conceptualizations and values, and by sex-role\ndifferentiation in the practice of religion (Raphael,\n1994). Typically, the view states, men understand theistic experience\nas a human subject encountering a being wholly distinct, distant, and\noverpowering. A paradigm of this approach is Rudolf Otto’s\n“numinous experience,” of a “wholly other”\nreality, unfathomable and overpowering, engendering a sense of dreaded\nfascination. The mystic is “submerged and overwhelmed” by\nhis own nothingness (Otto, 1957). Otto claims that this is the\nfoundational experience of religion. This approach, it is claimed, is\nmediated by the androcentrism of Otto’s worldview, entrapped in\nissues of domination, atomicity, and submission. Some feminist\nthinkers deny the dichotomy between the holy and the creaturely that\nmakes Otto’s analysis possible (see Daly, 1973 and Goldenberg,\n1979).  Feminist theologians stress the immanent nature of the object\nof theistic experience, and bring to prominence women’s\nexperience of the holy in their fleshly embodiment, denigrated by\nandrocentric attitudes. Feminists have entered the debate on constructivism and mystical\nexperience by supporting the constructivist position (Lanzetta, 2005,\nespecially Chapter One). They do so in the name of anti-essentialism\nand diversity of experience. The thinking that there is a common,\nunconstructed, essence to mystical experience has worked against the\nrecognition of women’s experiences as properly mystical.  The feminist critique poses a welcome corrective to undoubted\nandrocentric biases in mysticism and mystical studies. The feminist\ncritique should help neutralize the conception of the solely\nprivate nature of mysticism and religious experience, introduced to\nphilosophy largely by William James. Objection (2) has begun to bring\nabout a welcome change with scholarship dedicated to women’s mysticism\nand its significance (see for example, Hurcombe, 1987, Brunn and\nEpiney-Burgard, 1989, Beer, 1993, and Borchert, 1994). Several\ncollections on women mystics have helped change the over-emphasis on\nmen mystics. (See, for a good example, Furlong, 2013.) Regarding (3),\nwe must distinguish between Otto’s androcentric claim that his type of\nnuminous experience constitutes religious experience at its most\nprofound, and the rich variegation of religious and mystical\nexperience of men throughout history. This includes men’s experiences\nof God’s immanent closeness as well as mystical union with God, quite\nopposite, by feminist lights, to Otto’s numinous experience. The study\nof gender in religious experience and mysticism has barely begun and\npromises new insights into and revisions of our understanding of these\nhuman phenomena.  \nSome maintain there is an intrinsic connection between mysticism and\nmoral behavior. This is because mystical experience blurs or erases\nthe distinction between the subject and others (Stace, 1961) and so\nremoves the barrier to moral motivation, or because, as typically in\nmonistic mysticism, the ego disappears entirely (Browning,\n1979). Several scholars have argued, to the contrary, that some forms\nof mysticism are incompatible with morality. (Danto, 1987 and Kripal,\n2002). One charge is that a conceptual requirement of morality is the\nrecognition of individuals other than oneself to whom one has\nobligations and to whom one is to display moral virtues. However,\nmonistic mysticism eliminates all distinctions between one person and\nothers. All are One. Hence, monistic mysticism precludes being\nmoral. Morality must be between “independently real\npersons.” (Wainwright, 1983, pp. 211–12.) Others argue that\nmorality can get off the ground solely with the ability to\nconceptualize “the well-being of others” without the need\nto recognize others as ontologically independent beings. (Zelinski,\n2007, Jones, 1993).This leaves open whether this is morality or mock\nmorality since it might be lacking in fundamental moral\nsentiments. Wainwright, for example, argues that the ideal of\ndetachment, common in monistic mysticism, can be quite detrimental to\nthe self-investment and emotional attachment required in moral\ncommitment and behavior.\n \nDavid Loy argues that even if monistic morality not be incompatible\nwith morality, it fails to reveal the best way to help people with\ncompassion. (Loy, 2002) Others maintain, more strongly, that there is\nno intrinsic connection between mystical experience and moral\nbehavior.  We need look no further than to Christian complaints about\nmystical moral excesses, the Mahayana Buddhist rejection of the\nalleged selfishness of the ideal of the arhat in Theravada Buddhism,\nor the moral scandals of some Eastern mysticism in the West.(Kripal,\n2002). If moral behavior does follow it does not issue from mystical\nexperience but from the mystic’s cultural setting. The mystic\nmust fall back on the normative behavioral standards of the group,\nstandards not derivable from monistic experience. Mystical experience,\nso the charge goes, in itself is amoral without the addition of\ncultural guidance. However, it seems that much will depend on the\nmystical practice meant to lead to mystical experience as to its moral\nor amoral orientation. The resulting behavior will be a consequence of\nboth the practice undertaken to reach mystical experience and the\nexperience itself. (See Jones, 2016, Chapter 5).\n","contact.mail":"gellman@bgu.ac.il","contact.domain":"bgu.ac.il"}]
