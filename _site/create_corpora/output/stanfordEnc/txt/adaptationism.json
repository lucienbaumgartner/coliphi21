Advocates of adaptationism or\n“adaptationists” view natural selection among\nindividuals within a population as the only important cause of the evolution\nof a trait; they also typically believe that the construction of\nexplanations based solely on natural selection to be the most fruitful\nway of making progress in evolutionary biology and that this endeavor\naddresses the most important goal of evolutionary biology, which is to\nunderstand the evolution of adaptations. An important alternative\napproach, “pluralism”, invokes historical contingency and\ndevelopmental and genetic constraints, in addition to natural\nselection, as important causes of the evolution of a trait. Advocates\nof pluralism, or “pluralists” often also argue that the\nattempt to construct a natural-selective explanation of a trait is not\nthe most fruitful way to make explanatory progress and that\nunderstanding adaptation is just one of several important questions in\nevolutionary biology. The “debate” over adaptationism is\ncommonly understood to be the back-and-forth between adaptationists\nand pluralists.\n\n\n\nBiologists and philosophers have recently made three important\ncontributions that have led to better understanding of this\ndebate. First, they have delineated the differences among various\n“flavors” of adaptationism; this has helped clarify the\nbiological and philosophical stakes of the debate. Second, they have\nclarified standards of evidence for and against adaptationist claims;\nthis provides a clearer understanding of how to structure an empirical\ntest of a claim about natural selection and what implications the\nresults of the test have in regard to adaptationism. This\nclarification has the potential, not yet fully realized, to improve\nboth the practice of science and the philosophical understanding of\nthis practice. Third, there is improved understanding of the potential\nrole of non-selective influences on trait evolution.\n\n\n\n The debate over adaptationism is often\ntraced back to a 1979 paper by Stephen Gould and Richard Lewontin,\ncalled “The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm:\nA Critique of the Adaptationist Programme,” or simply the\n“Spandrels” paper. This paper is important but, in\nfact, this debate traces back to the nineteenth century, with elements\nof adaptationism or pluralism as currently understood being present in\nthe work of Henry Bates, William Bateson, Charles Darwin, Ernst\nHaeckel, Herbert Spencer, Alfred Wallace, and August Weissman, among\nothers (see Mayr 1982 and Ruse 2003 for some of the historical\nbackground). \n\n In the early twentieth century, views that\nwe now call adaptationism and pluralism were enunciated by biologists.\nAmong them were two of the then (and now) most influential evolutionary\nbiologists: Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. The central idea of\nFisher's important 1930 book “The Genetical Theory of\nNatural Selection” is that natural selection is the only\nimportant influence on trait evolution. This is the central text of\nadaptationism; indeed, it has an honored place in the minds of most\nevolutionary biologists, no matter what their position on adaptationism\n(compare Grafen 2003 and Kimura 1983). Issued again in 1958 in a\nrevised edition and in 1999 in a variorum edition, this book has\ngarnered over 8,400 journal citations; over 7,600 have occurred\nsince 1975 (Web of Science, June 2010). \n\n Sewall Wright's pluralist view\nof evolution was presented in several places, with his 1931 paper\n“Evolution in Mendelian Populations” and the 1977 book\n“Evolution and the Genetics of Populations, Volume 3 Experimental\nResults and Evolutionary Deductions” being the best known. The\npaper has received over 3,400 citations; over 3,000 have occurred since\n1975, while the book has received over 800 citations since 1977 (Web of\nScience, June 2010). \n\n These works by Fisher and Wright are\ncanonical contributions to the field of evolutionary biology. They were\nbased partially on prior claims and counterclaims about the influence\nof natural selection and of non-selective forces on trait evolution,\nespecially in species such as land snails that have easily\ndistinguishable trait variation (see Millstein 2007a). In turn, these\nworks stimulated continuing claims and counterclaims. The mid-1970s\nexplosion of citations reflects the fact that the number of biologists\nstudying ecology and evolution increased markedly as compared to the\nearly 1960s and that evolutionary biology gained separate departmental\nstatus at many universities; these changes were in part caused by the\nincreased societal awareness and concern at that time about pollution\nand the impact of humans on the environment. There were two central but\nmainly disjunct scientific developments that energized the\nproliferation and refinement of adaptationist and of pluralist views\nduring this period. The first was the extensive development of\n“strategic” claims in evolutionary ecology, which in the\ncase of a given trait, say, the allocation of energy to male and to\nfemale offspring (e.g., Hamilton 1967; see also Charnov 1982), provides\nan explanation as to why the observed trait is locally optimal. Such a\nclaim invokes only natural selection as an important causal explanation\nof the trait. The second development was the neutral theory in\npopulation genetics, which posits that natural selection plays little\nor no role in determining DNA and protein sequence variation in natural\npopulations (e.g., Kimura 1968, 1983). The former development generated\nlittle initial controversy, while the latter development immediately\ngenerated lasting controversy (see Dietrich 1994). \n\n It is this combination of social,\ninstitutional, and scientific developments that formed the background\nto Gould and Lewontin's 1979 paper, which can be best understood\nas an important but not singular event in a long-standing debate in\nevolutionary biology. It is neither the beginning of the debate over\nadaptationism nor something much narrower, e.g., little more than\n“the attempted intellectual lynching” of sociobiology, cf.,\nQueller (1995); see also Pigliucci and Kaplan (2000). Such claims are\nat best historically incorrect. \n\n Recent work in the philosophy of biology\n(Orzack and Sober 1994a, Sober 1996, Amundson 1988, 1990, Godfrey-Smith\n2001) has helped uncover three “flavors” of adaptationism;\nthese reflect differences in beliefs among current professional\ndevelopers and users of evolutionary arguments. They represent\ncommitments about the state of nature, about the way to do science, and\nabout what is important to study. \n\n The first flavor, “empirical”\nadaptationism, is the view that natural selection is ubiquitous, free\nfrom constraints, and provides a sufficient explanation for the\nevolution of most traits, which are “locally” optimal, that\nis, the observed trait is superior to any alternative that does not\nrequire “redefining” the organism (Orzack and Sober 1994a).\nThis is a claim about the realized influence of natural selection on\nthe evolution of traits as compared to other evolutionary\ninfluences. \n\n The second flavor,\n“explanatory” adaptationism, is the view that explaining\ntraits as adaptations resulting from natural selection is the central\ngoal of evolutionary biology. This is a claim about the greater\nimportance of some kinds of explanations. Opinions differ as to whether\nthis is a scientific claim or an aesthetic claim (see below). \n\n The third flavor,\n“methodological” adaptationism, is the view that looking\nfirst for adaptation via natural selection is the most efficient\napproach when trying to understand the evolution of any given\ntrait. This could be true even if adaptations are rare (although\na substantial majority of biologists believe that adaptations are\ncommon). The belief that adaptations are common is quite\ndifferent from the claim that only natural selection need be invoked in\norder to explain these adaptations. \n\n The flavors of adaptationism are logically\nindependent. The truth of one claim does not necessarily imply the\ntruth of the other claims. For example, it could be true that most\ntraits are adaptations that can be explained by invoking no more than\nnatural selection (the first flavor) but still be false that it is most\nfruitful to look first for adaptation (the third flavor). In fact,\nrealized intellectual stances are more circumscribed in that most\nadaptationists are advocates of empirical, explanatory, and\nmethodological adaptationism (e.g., Charnov 1982, Dawkins 1976, Maynard\nSmith 1978). In addition, there are many biologists who are advocates\nof explanatory and methodological adaptationism, but who explicitly\nreject empirical adaptationism (e.g., Mayr 1983). On the other hand,\nsome biologists reject all three flavors of adaptationism (e.g.,\nCarroll 2005, Wagner et al. 2000, West-Eberhard 2003). There are many\ninstances of competing adaptationist and pluralist explanations of the\nsame biology. For example, Cain and Sheppard (1954) and Lamotte (1959)\nfamously present competing explanations of morphological traits in land\nsnails; Ackermann and Cheverud (2004) test adaptationist and\npluralist explanations of the diversification of morphological\nevolution of humans and their ancestors; Millstein (2007b)\nillustrates the differences between adaptationism and pluralism by\npresenting the same biology (of a heat-shock protein) from both\nperspectives. \n\n Distinguishing among the flavors of\nadaptationism was an important advance in our biological and\nphilosophical understanding. These flavors of adaptationism differ in\ntheir practical implications for evolutionary biology. We now\ndiscuss each in detail. \n\n Godfrey-Smith (2001, page\n336) defined empirical adaptationism as follows: “Natural\nselection is a powerful and ubiquitous force, and there are few\nconstraints on the biological variation that fuels it. To a large\ndegree, it is possible to predict and explain the outcome of\nevolutionary processes by attending only to the role played by\nselection. No other evolutionary factor has this degree of causal\nimportance.” \n\n This definition captures two\nimportant beliefs of adaptationists. The first is that natural\nselection governs all important aspects of trait evolution and that\nother evolutionary influences will be of little consequence at least\nover the long term. The second is that the order in nature is a\nconsequence of natural selection. Parker and Maynard Smith (1990) is an\nimportant example of this approach. \n\n Empirical adaptationism is typically regarded as descriptive of the\nevolution of directly observable traits such as leg length (e.g.,\nVella 2008). A dizzying variety of traits has been analyzed from the\nperspective of empirical adaptationism; many specific examples can be\nfound in Hardy (2002), Stephens et al. (2007), and Westneat\nand Fox (2010). Many proponents of empirical adaptationism concede\nthat important aspects of the evolution of DNA and protein sequences\nare little influenced by natural selection. \n\n The important methodological\nimplication of empirical adaptationism stems from the causal power that\nit assigns to natural selection: an apparent discrepancy between data\nand the predictions of an optimality model should be resolved by\nrejection of that model and development of a new model. This is\njustified by an appeal to our “always” imperfect knowledge\nof nature (e.g. see Cain 1989). This contrasts with the pluralist\nperspective: such a discrepancy might well provide evidence against\nnatural selection. \n\n Many views counter to empirical\nadaptationism have been enunciated. Some dispense with natural\nselection entirely (or nearly so), such as in the study of molecular\nevolution, where there are neutral evolutionary explanations for many\nfeatures of the genome (e.g., Lynch 2007b). Some retain natural\nselection within populations as an important evolutionary force but\nendorse the importance of other forces (e.g., Crespi 2000, Goodwin\n2001, Carroll 2005), while others go further and invoke natural\nselection among populations or species along with natural selection\nwithin populations (Gould 2002, Jablonski 2008). \n\n Godfrey-Smith (2001, page 336) defined\nexplanatory adaptationism in this way: “The apparent design of\norganisms, and the relations of adaptedness between organisms and their\nenvironments, are the big questions, the amazing facts in\nbiology. Explaining these phenomena is the core intellectual mission of\nevolutionary theory. Natural selection is the key to solving these\nproblems; selection is the big answer. Because it answers the\nbiggest questions, selection has unique explanatory importance among\nevolutionary factors.” \n\n Explanatory adaptationism is viewed\nby its proponents (e.g., Dawkins 1976, Dennett 1995, and Griffiths\n2009) as important because it organizes research to understand how\nnatural selection underlies the world around us. To this extent, it can\nbe viewed as an untestable aesthetic claim, instead of as a scientific\nclaim. At minimum, it is a claim as to the proper goal of science as a\nmanifestation of human reason and enlightenment. Amundson (1988, 1990)\nclaims that explanatory adaptationism is a stance about the natural\nworld and the products of scientific inquiry, instead of being a view\nabout biology or how best to do science. However, explanatory\nadaptationism may have normative implications for evolutionary\nbiologists, if adopting it is necessary in order to construct sensible\nexplanations in developmental biology and physiology (Griffiths\n2009). Viewed as an aesthetic claim, explanatory adaptationism\nhas no practical implications for science, but it does have\nimplications for the public debate about the relevance of biology to\nour image of humanity. In particular, Dennett and Dawkins argue\nthat this perspective counters the natural theological argument from\ndesign and vindicates a secular humanist perspective. \n\n Biologists not advocating explanatory\nadaptationism view the central mission of evolutionary biology\ndifferently. For example, many systematists believe that\ndescribing the history of life is the central mission of evolutionary\nbiology; in doing so, one might be agnostic about the evolutionary\nforces influencing this history (see Hull 1988 and Felsenstein 2004 for\nfurther details). \n\n Godfrey-Smith (2001, page 337) defined\nmethodological adaptationism in this way: “The best way for scientists\nto approach biological systems is to look for features of adaptation\nand good design. Adaptation is a good ‘organizing concept’\nfor evolutionary research.” \n\n This is a claim about the efficiency of\ntools. No matter how incorrect it may ultimately be to invoke natural\nselection as a sufficient explanation for a trait, it is the most\ndirect way possible to find the true causal explanation of a trait.\nMethodological adaptationism differs markedly from empirical\nadaptationism in that the former acknowledges the possibility that\nnatural selection may ultimately prove not to have the most influence\non a given trait's evolution. In addition, a methodological\nadaptationist can accept that an apparent discrepancy between data and\nthe predictions of a model of natural selection may be resolved by\nconcluding that the trait is little influenced by natural selection,\ninstead of by concluding that the model is incorrect. \n\n One potential argument against\nmethodological adaptationism is that a mixture of distinct approaches\nis superior at advancing knowledge as compared to a single approach\n(Kitcher 1993). Allowing for a division of cognitive labor could be a\ngood thing; perhaps evolutionary biology benefits from an array of\nmethodological strategies with differing degrees of risk. This\ncontrasts with the view that multiple approaches with conflicting\nassumptions are a hindrance. \n\n Views counter to methodological\nadaptationism range from strong views that deny that adaptation is a\ngood guiding concept to weaker views that privilege different\nexplanations. For example, Gould and Lewontin's (1979)\nargument for considering constraint-based “Bauplan”\nexplanations before or along side selective explanations is an example\nof methodological anti-adaptationism. \n\n An important part of the\nadaptationism debate concerns the testing of adaptive and non-adaptive\nhypotheses. The belief that scientific practice in evolutionary\nbiology does not adhere to the proper standards of evidence motivates\nmany of the critiques of adaptationism. This concern has been taken\nseriously by some evolutionary biologists; for example, Rose and Lauder\n(1996) claimed that a central task of contemporary evolutionary biology\nis to articulate a “post-Spandrels adaptationism,” a task\nthat involves improving testing methods by including comparative and\nmolecular data, conducting careful long-term studies in both the\nlaboratory and the wild, and incorporating a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of development and constraint. \n\n We now discuss testing of\nadaptationism itself and the associated implications for testing\nevolutionary hypotheses generally, and the sort of epistemic\ndifficulties that must be overcome. We highlight how the debate\nhas led to increased understanding of the importance of phylogenetic\nmethods, of the viability of optimality models as tools for testing\nadaptive hypotheses, and of whether constraint hypotheses are rivals to\nadaptive hypotheses or provide the backdrop against which we test\nhypotheses about the evolutionary process. \n\n Orzack and Sober (1994a, 1994b, 1996,\n2001) (see also Orzack 2008) proposed an approach for testing\nempirical adaptationism. In their view, the truth of empirical\nadaptationism is a possible outcome of testing of optimality models, as\nopposed to being something that is decided a priori. \n\n Their proposal, the “Adaptationism Project”, involves\nassembling specific kinds of analyses of traits in order to assess the\nrelative frequency and importance of natural selection across the\nbiological realm. In order to contribute to the ensemble test, an\nanalysis must include an assessment of the quantitative fit of the\noptimality model and of the within-population heterogeneity of fit to\nthe predictions (see below and Orzack and Sober 1994a for why these\nassessments are required). At present, there are very few trait\nanalyses that contain these elements; after an extensive literature\nreview, Orzack and Sober identified only Brockmann and Dawkins (1979),\nBrockmann et al. (1979), Orzack and Parker (1990), and\nOrzack et al. (1991) as analyses that contain the required\nassessments. \n\n Of course, to conduct an ensemble test,\nimportant methodological difficulties must be confronted, including how\nto choose populations and species to analyze, and how many cases are\nnecessary to provide an adequate test. The name “Adaptationism\nProject” is an acknowledgement of a parallel to the “Human\nGenome Project”; both are carried out by a consortium of\ninvestigators and require advance organization of the process by which\nknowledge is gathered (instead of just occurring willy-nilly).\nThis is an ambitious project but one that is achievable, cf., the\n“Genome 10K” project, which is also an effort to create an\nunprecedented data ensemble (Genome 10K 2009). \n\n Ensemble tests have a long\nprecedent in biology and evolutionary biology, although none appear to\nhave been prospectively organized. For example, we have the ensemble\nconclusion that “almost all” speciation occurs via\ngeographical isolation (Mayr 1963) or that the genetic code is\n“nearly” universal (Crick 1968). Either or both of these\nclaims could be true but the present empirical knowledge that generated\neither one is not even remotely close to being based on a sample of\norganisms that could be taken to be representative of all species. \n\n Empirical adaptationism is both\na claim about the relative frequency of natural selection across\nevolutionary histories and about the power of natural selection to\novercome constraints and contingency. Orzack and Sober's\n(1994a,b) ensemble test of the truth of empirical adaptationism is\nstructured in the following way for any given trait, T. In order to\ncontribute to the ensemble test, the analysis of the trait must allow\nthe investigator to confirm one of the following hypotheses about the\npower of natural selection: (U) Natural selection played some role in the evolution of T. (U\ndenotes ubiquitous since\nthis proposition applies to most traits.) \n\n(I) Natural selection was an important cause of the evolution of T.\n(I denotes important.) \n\n(O) Natural selection is a sufficient explanation of the evolution\nof T, and T is locally \noptimal. (O denotes optimal.) \n\n Orzack and Sober claimed that\nempirical adaptationism is a generalization of (O), namely that natural\nselection is a sufficient explanation for most (nonmolecular) traits\nand those traits are locally optimal. \n\n Orzack and Sober provided a specific\nprotocol to assess whether O is true for a particular trait. It\ninvolves comparing the predictive accuracy of a “censored”\nevolutionary model, one that invokes only natural selection, and an\nalternative “uncensored” model that invokes additional\nevolutionary influences such as genetic drift (random trait change\ncaused by population number being finite), or constraints caused by the\nway the trait is determined genetically or developmentally. If\nthe censored model is quantitatively accurate and there is no\nwithin-population heterogeneity of fit to predictions and the\nuncensored model fails in either regard, then one can infer that\nnatural selection is a sufficient explanation for trait T.\nOptimality models embody proposition (O) in that natural selection is\nassumed to be the only important influence on the focal trait's\nevolution; the result is assumed to be the evolution of a trait that\nmaximizes individual fitness. Of course, an optimality model, like any\nevolutionary model, must include background assumptions and constraints\nthat anchor the “local” analysis of the focal trait.\nHowever, given these assumptions, natural selection is assumed to act\nwithout constraint on the trait. \n\n There is some controversy over the\nprotocol for testing whether natural selection is a sufficient\nexplanation of a trait. Brandon and Rausher (1996) objected that\nlocal optimality is a distinct claim and so tests for the importance of\nnatural selection should not use optimality models, whose use they\nequate to “theft”, which they believe means that such\nmodels are generically incompatible with universal aspects of the\nbiology of organisms. They also take issue with how the\npredictive accuracy of censored and uncensored models should be\nassessed. Godfrey-Smith (2001) makes the observation that the\ncensored and uncensored test models typically have different\ncomplexity. More complex models usually fit the data better, but\nrisk obscuring the underlying trend or comprising predictive\naccuracy—there may be a problem of over-fitting lurking here\n(see, e.g., Gauch 2003 for an overview of the curve-fitting\nproblem). \n\n Extending this framework to molecular\ntraits, where completely neutral evolution is a plausible explanation,\nrequires expanding the set of hypotheses about natural selection.\nIt now should include: \n\nSome argue that N is rarely, if ever, true (e.g., Gillespie 1991),\nwhereas others argue otherwise (e.g., Kimura 1983, Lynch 2007a).\nAn ensemble test involving molecular traits would help resolve this\ncontroversy. In addition, the notion of optimality at the\nmolecular level must be made precise. A molecular trait needs to have\nan identified phenotypic consequence. The endeavor to identify such a\nconsequence will likely always involve a combination of very detailed\nmolecular, biochemical, and phenotypic analyses. However, despite the\ndifficulty of the needed analyses, there are claims as to the\noptimality of various molecular traits. A canonical example is the\nclaim that triosephosphate isomerase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis\nin animals, fungi, plants, and some bacteria, is catalytically\n“perfect” (Albery and Knowles 1976); this is a claim that\nhypothesis O is true. For molecular traits, the assessment of the\ninfluence of natural selection, i.e., distinguishing between hypothesis\nN and hypotheses U and I, is facilitated by the degeneracy of the\ngenetic code and the existence of non-coding regions in the genome. We\nexpect heterogeneity of the realized influence of natural selection\namong sites in the genome, and differences in evolutionary rates\nbetween sites where a DNA base change alters the protein sequence and\nthose sites that it does not (see examples in Graur and Li 2000,\nKreitman and Akashi 1995, Nielsen 2005, and Yang 2006). \n\n The debate over\nadaptationism contains claims and counterclaims about what hypotheses\nshould be included in an analysis of the adaptiveness of a trait.\nThis is crucial because assessments of evidentiary support depend on\nwhat hypotheses we consider (see Sober 1990, Earman 1992). We\nmust consider all the relevant hypotheses in order to provide good\nevidence for a hypothesis (Stanford 2006, Forber 2010). One\ncommon pluralist complaint is that adaptationists neglect this standard\nof evidence. Such an inclusive standard is essential because many\ndifferent evolutionary trajectories can lead to the same outcome.\nAs Gould and Lewontin (1979) wrote, “One must not confuse the\nfact that a structure is used in some way…with the primary\nevolutionary reason for its existence and conformation”. In\naddition, subtle differences in evolutionary history may lead to\ndifferent evolutionary outcomes (Beatty and Desjardins 2009). Thus, we\ncannot conclude that natural selection played an important role in the\nevolution of some trait just because we have a plausible adaptive\nhypothesis in mind. Indeed, finding suitable evidence for an\nadaptive (or non-adaptive) hypothesis is difficult because we lack good\nepistemic access to evolutionary history. This lack of access is\na premise of Gould and Lewontin's critique, and it motivates\ntheir call to evaluate testing methods in evolutionary biology,\nespecially those methods that consider only adaptive hypotheses with no\nregard for non-adaptive rivals. Biologists have continued to develop\nnew testing methods that do this (see, e.g., Rose and Lauder 1996,\nHansen et al. 2008). \n\n This aspect of the adaptationism debate is\nconnected with a general epistemological issue in philosophy of\nscience: underdetermination of theory by evidence. Evolutionary\nhypotheses are typically underdetermined by available evidence.\nIn principle, rival hypotheses make different commitments about the\nnature of evolutionary history, but in practice these hypotheses are\nempirically indistinguishable given the available evidence.\nPhilosophers argue about the consequences of this underdetermination\nfor our understanding of biological science (Turner 2005, Stanford\n2006). Yet, there is agreement that the problem of underdetermination\nshould be addressed by developing and using tests that discriminate\nbetween rival hypotheses. \n\n Evidentiary relations depend on what\nhypotheses we compare, and so good testing methods should include all\nrival hypotheses. If we fail to include a relevant rival, say,\none that emphasizes developmental constraint, then we may not have\nfound sufficient evidence for the adaptive hypothesis. Failing to\ncontrast adaptive and non-adaptive explanations weakens any\nadaptationist analysis (Forber 2009). \n\n Evolutionary hypotheses make a\nvariety of commitments about development, ecology, genetics, and\nhistory. As a result, an adaptive hypothesis makes contact with\nevolutionary history only in conjunction with a number of auxiliary\nhypotheses. The most convincing case for an adaptive hypothesis will\ninclude a variety of evidence, especially independent data that confirm\nthe different facets of an evolutionary hypothesis (Lloyd 1988).\nSober's (2008) analysis of a testing protocol for evolutionary\nhypotheses makes clear the role of auxiliary hypotheses and assesses\nthe evidentiary import of different observed outcomes. He provides an\nanalysis of whether and how fit between an optimality model and the\nobserved population mean favors natural selection over genetic\ndrift. \n\n The adaptationism debate has helped clarify the importance of\ncomparative methods for testing adaptive hypotheses. \n\n The relatedness among species due to common\nancestry can reduce the amount of seemingly independent evidence one\nhas for or against any evolutionary hypothesis. Species with a recent\ncommon ancestor may have inherited the same trait from the ancestor, as\nopposed to evolving it independently of one another. Comparative\nmethods help one assess the extent to which a set of related species\nprovide independent evidence for or against a given evolutionary\nhypothesis (Harvey and Pagel 1991). The general awareness of the need\nto use such methods stems primarily from the initially narrower debate\nthat took place within systematics in the 1960s and 1970s over how to\ncreate classifications of organisms that are “scientific”\nand as such, are transparent recipes that are accessible to others,\ninstead of being “private” and non-scientific. This debate\ngenerated tremendous controversy (Hull 1988) and it spurred on the\ndevelopment of methods to statistically correct for dependence among\nspecies' trait values when assessing an adaptive hypothesis\n(Felsenstein 1985, Harvey and Pagel 1991). In addition, it became more\nwidely understood that a claim that one trait evolved in response to\nanother is enormously strengthened by phylogenetic confirmation; the\nhistory of trait acquisition must be consistent with the hypothesis\n(see Maddison 1990 and references therein). \n\n These developments are salutary in\nthat they show biologists how to better test adaptive hypotheses and\nhave clarified the phylogenetic assumptions that are necessary to test\nadaptive hypotheses (Sober and Orzack 2003). As such, they are a\nmethodological improvement that has generally gained a positive\nreception among philosophers of biology (e.g., Sterelny and Griffiths\n1999). Many biologists agree, but controversy continues. Some\nacknowledge the potential importance of comparative methods but point\nto limitations that may reduce their usefulness (Reeve and Sherman\n2001, Leroi et al. 1994). As such, these critiques are consistent with\nmethodological adaptationism. Others view any allusion to potential\nnon-adaptive influences on trait evolution to be mistaken; in their\nview, the importance of phylogenetic methods is that they help reveal\ncomplete history of natural selection on the trait (Grafen 1989). As\nsuch, this is a critique consistent with the espousal of empirical\nadaptationism. \n\n Claims and counterclaims about the use of\noptimality models for understanding evolution are a central part of the\ndebate over adaptationism, although some believe that there is no\nnecessary connection between optimality modeling and adaptationism\n(Potochnik 2009). While many biologists believe that optimality\nmodels are useful, whether evolution by natural selection tends to\nproduce optimal traits is controversial (see, e.g., Dupré\n1987). \n\n Optimality models put the contingencies of\nhistory and developmental and genetic constraints in to the background\nso as to focus on natural selection. Much work in evolutionary\ngame theory embodies this approach. Most game-theoretic models are used\nto describe the evolution by natural selection of strategic behavior to\na local optimum called an evolutionarily stable strategy (Maynard Smith\n1982) (but see Orzack and Hines 2005 and Huttegger 2010 among\nothers). This approach has the assumption that there is direct\nselection on the trait under analysis. This is often justified on the\ngrounds that there exists a “good fit” between the trait\nand its current function (Maynard Smith 1978) or that natural selection\nis ubiquitous in nature (Mayr 1983). The Spandrels paper targeted\nthese general arguments for optimality models. \n\n Biologists have discovered many ways in\nwhich the genetic details of trait determination and/or ecological\ndetails of the population can prevent the evolution of optima. For\nexample, interaction between loci (linkage or pleiotropy) can prevent\nthe optimal phenotype from being fixed in a population, and thereby\nprevent the maximization of mean fitness (Moran 1964). Such a deviation\nfrom the state of highest fitness is called genetic load. The standard\nadaptationist response is that genetic and ecological constraints are\neliminated over evolutionary time by the introduction of new genetic\nvariation via mutation (Parker and Maynard Smith 1990). \n\n While this controversy has been divisive\n(Schwartz 2002), there are prospects for a synthesis. First,\nEshel and Feldman (2001) distinguished between “short-term\nevolution”, the evolutionary dynamics of a fixed set of\ngenotypes, and “long-term evolution”, bouts of short-term\nevolution interspersed with introductions of new genetic\nvariation. They noted (page 162) that “long-term evolution\nproceeds by an infinite sequence of transitions from one fixed set of\ngenotypes to another fixed set of genotypes, with each of these sets\nsubject to short-term evolution…” Optima are often\nnot accessible in the short-term due to constraints on available\nvariation. However, genetic variation may be introduced over the long\nterm so that the population eventually reaches an optimum. The\nsubstantive point is that we now understand how apparent short-term\nimpediments to optimality can be resolved over the long term. Mutations\nmust appear at the right time and the ecology must remain stable over\nthe long term; whether these conditions are met frequently enough in\nnature to justify the optimality approach is an empirical issue (see\nalso Hammerstein 1996). The second prospect for synthesis is\nWilkins and Godfrey Smith's (2009) proposal that the truth of\nempirical adaptationism, and the concomitant application of optimality\nmodels, depends on the intended “grain” of resolution of\nthe evolutionary analysis. At a fine grain of resolution, when there\nare few peaks in the adaptive landscape, most observed populations may\nbe on or near these peaks. Adaptationism is appropriate at this\nresolution. If we “zoom out” and look at a grand landscape\nover large regions of morphospace, the situation changes. At a\nvery coarse grain of resolution, much of morphospace is empty and\nconstraints often explain why certain regions remain unexplored by\nbiological evolution. Adaptationism is inappropriate at this\nresolution. \n\n Finally, the focus on optimality modeling\nin connection to adaptationism has led to a precise statement of how\nthe nature of fit between data and the predictions of an optimality\nmodel influence the degree of evidentiary support for the adaptive\nhypothesis (Orzack and Sober 1994a, b). Qualitative agreement by\nitself is not sufficient to accept the hypothesis of local optimality.\nInstead, quantitative agreement and an assessment of nature of possible\nbetween-individual heterogeneity of fit to model predictions are\nrequired in order to have evidence for optimality; without both of\nthese test components, acceptance of the hypothesis of optimality is\nnot warranted (see above). \n\n One issue in the debate over\nadaptationism and optimality models concerns whether constraint\nhypotheses count as genuine alternatives to adaptive hypotheses.\nGould and Lewontin (1979) view constraint hypotheses as competing with\nadaptive hypotheses as explanations of traits. Advocates of optimality\nmodels (e.g., Maynard Smith 1978, Roughgarden 1998) take the set of\nevolutionary constraints to be a background commitment of any\noptimality model. The constraint set may include developmental\nand genetic constraints on variation and transmission, but it is\nnatural selection that drives evolution and so explains the trait given\nthose constraints. Advocates of optimality models treat\nconstraints as presupposed by adaptive hypotheses. A concern of\nmany critics of adaptationism is that this treatment of constraints\nundervalues their role in explaining evolutionary form and novelty. \n\n Developmental processes may limit the spectrum of evolutionary\ntrajectories available to a lineage.  Maynard Smith et\nal. (1985, page 266) defined a developmental constraint as\n“a bias on the production of variant phenotypes or a limitation\non phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character,\ncomposition, or dynamics of the developmental system.” More\nrecently, the definition of constraint has become more nuanced (see,\ne.g., Wagner and Altenberg 1996, Winther 2001). \n\n Part of the controversy over\nconstraints can be resolved by distinguishing between “constraint\non adaptation” and “constraint on form” (Amundson\n1994). In the former, certain trajectories are less likely\nbecause they require populations to leave local optima or\n“peaks” in the adaptive landscape. In this case,\nnatural selection limits the potential evolutionary trajectories.\nIn the latter case, certain trajectories are unavailable due to the\nstructure of the current developmental system. \n\n Advocates of optimality models often argue\nthat building and testing such models provides the best way to identify\nand discover evolutionary constraints, and that these constraints can\nthen be used to build better optimality models (Amundson 1994, Seger\nand Stubblefield 1996). Many biologists that analyze the\nevolution of development or “evo-devo” use a different set\nof molecular and morphological investigative techniques to uncover\nrobust and important developmental constraints (see, e.g., Müller\nand Newman 2003, Kirschner and Gerhart 2005). They object that\nthe concept of optimality is a poor tool for answering their research\nquestions. The recognition of two kinds of constraints resolves\nthis dispute. We see then that optimality modeling usually\nentails the incorporation of or the discovery of constraints on\nadaptation, whereas studies of evolution and development investigates\nconstraints on form. A full understanding of evolutionary history\nrequires a synthesis of these approaches. \n\n Developmental and genetic constraint\nhypotheses do not invoke causal processes in the same way that adaptive\nhypotheses do. Can such different hypotheses compete with one another?\nThis aspect of the adaptationism debate connects biology to an\nimportant puzzle about the nature of causation and explanation.\nIf explanation amounts to identifying causes, then constraints must be\ncauses to explain evolutionary outcomes. But how can impediments\nhave a causal influence on the evolutionary trajectory of a\nlineage? One possible answer is that they don't have any\ncausal influence—they are merely the background against which\nnatural selection operates. Such a view treats causes as part of\na process, or involving some kind of energy transfer (Dowe 2008).\nThis view of causation vindicates the adaptationist view that the\nconstraint set is presupposed by any respectable adaptive\nhypothesis. For adaptationists, new constraints simply mean that\nwe need to build new models. Testing is then just a matter of\ncomparing different adaptive hypotheses that have different\nconstraints. The other possible answer is that constraints\ndo have a causal influence on evolution because they prevent\nevolutionary trajectories from attaining some outcomes. This view\nis consistent with counterfactual and interventionist approaches to\ncausation, such as the comprehensive one defended by Woodward (2003),\nand vindicates the approach of treating constraints as genuine\nalternatives to adaptive hypotheses. \n\n Linking this debate to\nphilosophical ideas about causation can help us evaluate whether\nevolutionary constraints count as genuine alternatives.\nConstraints are defined as biases or limitations on the\nproduction of variation. From the perspective of causation, this\nis a heterogeneous combination. Constraints that bias a lineage\ntowards certain evolutionary trajectories look like productive\nprobabilistic causes, and avoid certain conceptual entanglements that\nface boundaries or limitations. Innovations in the developmental makeup\nof an organism can make new changes and subsequent evolutionary\ntrajectories more likely, a hallmark of a causal factor. This helps\nclarify the importance of evolutionary innovation. Innovations that\nproduce biases may be crucial to explaining major evolutionary\ntransitions, such as the emergence of multicellularity (Sterelny 2008).\nWhen certain changes make new evolutionary outcomes more likely\nthey are part of the explanation of those new outcomes. Such\nbiases count as probabilistic causal influences since they change the\nprobability of a lineage taking certain evolutionary trajectories\n(Hitchcock 2008). \n\n Whether boundaries count as causes, and\nthereby explain evolutionary outcomes, is more problematic. A\nprevailing view within evolutionary biology is that constraints must\ncount as causal influences, whatever our account of causation (whether\nit be by prevention or by omission, see Woodward 2003 for discussion).\nGould and Lewontin (1979) adopted this position. Sansom (2003) argued\nthat the debate over the evolutionary importance of constraint amounts\nto an issue about the relative causal contributions of constraint and\nnatural selection to evolutionary outcomes. The causal\ncontribution of constraint can be assessed by using comparative data in\norder to compare evolutionary outcomes of lineages with and without the\nconstraint of interest. If there is a difference, then the\nconstraint has an identifiable causal influence, all other things being\nequal. Pigliucci and Kaplan (2000, 2006) proposed a test protocol\nbased on transition matrices in which probabilities of evolutionary\nchange are specified under natural selection and under one or more\ncompeting constraint hypotheses, so as to test natural selection\nagainst constraint. More philosophical analysis is required to assess\nthe viability of this approach. \n\n Whatever the position on whether\nconstraints count as causes, the lesson to be taken from this part of\nthe adaptationism debate is that it is essential to precisely specify\nthe rival evolutionary hypotheses. There are many examples of such\nprecise specification in the biological literature. For example, Frank\n(1985) and Stubblefield and Seger (1990) analyzed the influence on sex\nratio optima of different constraints on the information available to\nparents; Lloyd (2005) described the evidentiary support for\nexplanations of the evolution of the female orgasm. Lloyd's\nanalysis supports Symons' (1979) proposal that the female orgasm\nexists because of a developmental constraint in combination with strong\nselection for the male orgasm. If males fail to achieve orgasm\nthen no reproduction occurs. The tissue responsible for the male\norgasm appears early in human development, long before sexual\ndimorphism occurs, and this tissue is found in both male and female\nsexual organs. This example contains competing hypotheses that have\ncommitments about boundaries and about natural selection. The\nSymons constraint explanation invokes a feature of development and\nindirect selection on a different trait, whereas the adaptive\nhypothesis does not incorporate the developmental constraint and\ninstead, posits a direct role for selection. \n\n There is room for reconciliation\nhere. As adaptationists point out, any evolutionary hypothesis\nmust assume some constraints, so the accusation that optimality models\nfail to include constraints is incorrect. But pluralists are\nright to argue that in some cases constraints may play a significant\nrole in the evolution of some trait, and that the correct evolutionary\nexplanation may not even include natural selection for the trait. \n\n Constraints are often understood as\nbiases or limitations on potential evolutionary trajectories. How do we\nidentify potential trajectories? This will depend on how biology\nprovides counterfactual information. We cannot appeal solely to\nrealized evolutionary history, since not all potential trajectories\nhave occurred. Evo-devo research on novelty provides one of the\nbest strategies for exploring potential evolutionary trajectories\n(Wagner 2000, 2001a,2001b, Muller and Wagner 2003, Calcott 2009).\nAs the causal mechanisms underlying development are better understood,\nwe will gain a better grasp on the nature of constraints and how they\nexplain evolutionary outcomes. \n\n Why should biologists and philosophers care\nabout the debate over adaptationism? This debate has been and will\ncontinue to be important to biologists because it helps clarify how to\ndo better evolutionary biology. Despite this, a minority of\ncurrently-active biologists contribute to the debate about\nadaptationism, and many ignore it or disparage it. For a variety of\nreasons, many of the important points that have arisen from the debate,\nsuch as how to structure empirical tests of adaptive hypotheses and\noptimality models, go unheeded. For example, claims for local\noptimality continue to appear that lack a specification of even a\nsingle alternative hypothesis to the adaptive hypothesis. This lack\ninevitably leaves ambiguous the status of the adaptive hypothesis. In\naddition, standards for rejection of the (only) adaptive hypothesis\ncontinue to be rarely delineated if at all. \n\n The debate over adaptationism will continue\nto be important to philosophers of biology because much will be gained\nby a more informed understanding of the use of hypotheses about natural\nselection by biologists. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a general\ntendency to misunderstand the conceptual commitments of users of\noptimality models. More recently, there has been a growing\nunderstanding of the variety of conceptual commitments held by users of\nsuch models, especially that the use and development of an optimality\nmodel need not bind the user to a blind acceptance of the claim that\nnatural selection is all powerful.","contact.mail":"orzack@freshpond.org","contact.domain":"freshpond.org"}]
