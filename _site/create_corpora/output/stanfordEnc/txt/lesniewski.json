He was the originator of an\nunorthodox system of the foundations of mathematics, based on three\nformal systems: Protothetic, a logic of propositions and their\nfunctions; Ontology: a logic of names, and functors of arbitrary order;\nand Mereology, a general theory of part and whole. His concern for\nutmost rigor in the formalization and execution of logic, coupled with\na nominalistic rejection of abstract entities, led to a precise but\nhighly unusual metalogic. His strictures on correctly\ndistinguishing use from mention of expressions, his canons of correct\ndefinition, and his mereology, have all informed the logical\nmainstream, but the majority of his logical views and innovations have\nnot been widely adopted. Despite this, his influence as a teacher and\nas a motor for logical innovation are widely acknowledged. He remains\none of logic’s most original figures.\n\n\nStanisław Kazimierz Leśniewski was born on 28 March 1886 at\nSerphukhov, near Moscow, to Izydor, an engineer working on the\nconstruction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and Helena, née\nPalczewska. He was baptised at St. Stanislav’s church in\nSt. Petersburg. His mother died when he was young and his father\nremarried. He attended classical Gimnazjum (grammar school\nstudying classical languages) in Irkutsk in Siberia. Between 1904 and\n1910 Leśniewski studied Philosophy and Mathematics in Germany,\nSwitzerland and Russia, at Leipzig, Zurich, Heidelberg,\nSt. Petersburg, and at Munich, where he heard lectures by Hans\nCornelius, Moritz Geiger and Alexander Pfänder. In 1910 he went\nas a doctoral student to Lwów University, then in\nAustria-Hungary, where the foremost Polish philosopher of the day,\nKazimierz Twardowski, a student of Franz Brentano, was professor and\nwas building up a cadre of outstanding young philosophers. In 1912 he\nobtained his doctorate with a dissertation Przyczynek do analizy\nzdań egzystencjalnych [Contributions to the Analysis of\nExistential Propositions]. This was published the previous year in the\nleading Polish-language philosophy journal Przegląd\nFilozoficzny. Several further publications followed until the\noutbreak of war, which Leśniewski spent in Moscow teaching\nmathematics at Polish schools. During this period he developed what\nlater became known as Mereology. After the Bolshevik Revolution in\nRussia, Leśniewski left Russia for Poland. During the\n1919–21 Polish–Bolshevik War he worked under Lt. Col. Jan Kowalewski as a codebreaker\nfor the Polish General Staff’s Cipher Section, in part because of his knowledge of Russian, helping Poland to\nsurvive Russia’s attempt to reconquer it. He tried unsuccessfully to\nobtain his habilitation in Lwów, where he was blocked, getting\nit instead in the University of Warsaw, where in 1919 he became\n(Extraordinary—Associate) Professor of the Foundations of\nMathematics, a position especially created for him. From then until\nhis final illness Leśniewski lectured regularly on logical and\nmathematical topics, and built up his logical systems. Though his\nlogic never became widely accepted, even in Poland, with Jan\nŁukasiewicz he was respected as one of the co-founders of the\nWarsaw School of Logic. Leśniewski’s only doctoral student,\nAlfred Tarski (Leśniewski used to boast of having 100% geniuses\nas doctoral students) joined them to form the world’s pre-eminent\ncentre of mathematical logic in the interwar years. Leśniewski\nwas made a full professor in 1936. Always a smoker, he contracted\nthyroid cancer and died on 13 May 1939 at the age of 53. His papers,\nentrusted to his student Bolesław Sobociński, included\nunfinished works on logical antinomies and on many-valued logic. All\nthese papers were destroyed during the Warsaw Rising of 1944. \n Leśniewski’s early writings are all papers on topics in\nthe philosophy of logic and language, concerned with such issues as\ntruth, denotation and connotation, the status of the laws of logic, and\nRussell’s Antinomy. The primary influences in this period were\nJohn Stuart Mill, Anton Marty, and Edmund Husserl: he himself described\nthe works as grammatical in nature. Although Leśniewski later\nrepudiated his early works, they contain many seeds of his later\ninterests, attitudes, and working practices. From the beginning there\nis an obsessive rigor in developing logical principles, including an\ninstinctively clear and consistent marking of the use/mention\ndistinction, that is, distinguishing talk in a language from talk about\na language. Leśniewski’s early works are mainly reactions to\nwork by others, whether Brentano and Cornelius on existential\npropositions, Łukasiewicz on the Principles of Contradiction and\nExcluded Middle, Twardowski on universals, or Kotarbiński on the\ntimelessness of truth. \n The turning point in this period came when in 1911 Leśniewski read\nŁukasiewicz’s groundbreaking 1910 monograph O zasadzie\nsprzeczności u Arystotelesa [On the Principle of\nContradiction in Aristotle], a radical rethink of the status of the\nprinciple of contradiction in the light of modern logic. That work\ncontained an appendix in which there was a short exposition of modern\nsymbolic logic, in the notation of Couturat, and in Chapter 18 a brief\ndiscussion of Russell’s antinomy of the set of sets which are not\nmembers of themselves. Leśniewski initially thought the Russell\nAntinomy was easy to fix—and while trying to fix it missed a\nonce-a-day train when changing stations in Russia. He spent the next\nyears perfecting his solution, and indeed the rest of his life was\ndevoted to providing a rigorous, antinomy-free foundation for\nmathematics which avoided both the sloppiness of Principia and\nwhat he considered the fiction of standard set theory. \n According to Leśniewski’s dissertation and first paper, all\npositive existential propositions are analytic. This sounds absurd, but\nLeśniewski has reasons. Like Mill, he distinguishes between a\nterm’s denotation, which is the object or objects it stands for,\nand its connotation, which is the property or properties it ascribes to\nsomething. A proposition is defined to be analytic if it is (1) in\npositive subject–predicate form, and (2) contains no predicates\nconnoting properties not connoted by the subject. A proposition is\nsynthetic if it is (1) positive and (2) contains some predicate\nconnoting a property not connoted by the subject. Contrary to Mill, who\nsaid that ‘being’ connotes the property of existing,\nLeśniewski thinks the predicate ‘exist’ does not\nconnote any properties. A fortiori, ‘exist’ used as a\npredicate connotes no property not contained in the subject. Negative\nexistential propositions, which have the form ‘\\(X\\) is/are\nnon-existing’ are synthetic, except for such whose subject\nconnotes non-existence, e.g. ‘A square circle does not\nexist’ does not, so it is synthetic, but ‘All non-existing\nobjects are non-existing’ is analytic. All negative existential\npropositions are contradictory, because every subject connotes\nsomething of the form ‘being which possesses properties\n\\(A, B, C, D\\), etc.’ Analytic\nnegative existentials have contradictory subjects. So instead of saying\n‘\\(X\\) exists’ we should, to express the proposition\nwe want to be synthetic and contingent, rather say ‘Some being is\nthe object \\(X\\)’. \n Leśniewski saves appearances, which are that some existential\npropositions are true and others are false, by proposing a normative\nschema that propositions should fulfill to be proper expressions of the\nthought intended. Every proposition is to represent the possessing by\nthe object(s) denoted by the subject of the properties connoted by the\npredicate. Sentences which fail to conform to this norm are improper or\ninadequate, and should be replaced by proper alternatives. For example\n‘People exist’, which is true but is intended to be\nsynthetic, should be expressed as ‘Some beings are people’,\nwhile ‘A square circle does not exist’ should be expressed\nby ‘No being is a square circle’. Here is a table of some\nof the equivalences: \n In “An Attempt at a Proof of the Ontological Principle of\nContradiction” (1912) Leśniewski argues that ‘No\nobject is able to be both \\(B\\) and not\\(-B\\)’ is true\nbut disagrees with the equivalence (now generally accepted) that\n‘No \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)’ is equivalent to ‘If\nsomething is \\(A\\) then it is not \\(B\\)’. The article\nis written in criticism of some ideas of Łukasiewicz and it\nafforded the occasion for the first personal meeting of the two later\ncolleagues. Łukasiewicz described the meeting decades later in a\npoignant diary entry for 9 May 1949: \n In “The Critique of the Logical Principle of the Excluded\nMiddle” (1913) Leśniewski distinguishes between an\nontological principle – Every object is either \\(A\\) or not\n\\(A\\) – and a logical principle – Of two\ncontradictory propositions, at least one must be true. He rejects the\nlatter because he takes ‘Every centaur has a tail’ and\n‘Some centaur does not have a tail’ to be contradictories,\nbut both to be false because the subject-term ‘centaur’ is\nempty. This clearly depends on a reading of the universal with\nexistential import. If instead for the universal we take ‘Any\ncentaur has a tail’, which is true if there are no centaurs,\nthen we do get a contradictory pair with opposite truth-values. \n In the course of this paper Leśniewski argues against\nTwardowski’s theory of general objects and Meinong’s theory\nof impossible objects, as well as offering solutions to the paradoxes\nof Grelling and the Liar. The paper is the richest of his early\n“logico-grammatical” works. The argument against Twardowski\ngoes as follows. Call a general object one which has all and\nonly the properties shared by some group of objects. For example the\ngeneral horse has all and only the properties shared by all horses: it\nis neither black nor brown nor white, neither male nor female, neither\nyoung nor old, but it is indisputably equine, mammalian, and born of\ntwo equine parents. Leśniewski now reduces the definition to\nabsurdity. Of any group of at least two objects, there will be some\nproperty that some of them have that others do not have. For example,\nsome horses are black and others are not black. So the general horse is\nnot black, because some horses are not black; but nor is it not black,\nbecause some horses are not not black. Hence the general horse is\nneither black nor not black, which is a contradiction. Hence there are\nno general objects for groups of more than one thing. Leśniewski\nliked this argument well enough to retain his allegiance to it even\nwhile repudiating all other parts of his early work; he rejected\nuniversals consistently thereafter. But the argument does not affect\nthose theories of universals which are happy to accept that universals\nmay have properties their instances do not, for example being\ninstantiated, or repeated. \n In “Is truth only eternal or both eternal and without a\nbeginning?” (1913) he argues for timeless bivalence against\nKotarbiński’s view that future contingent propositions lack\na determinate truth-value. This paper convinced Kotarbiński he had\nbeen in error. The exchange is notable for showing that the discussion\nof the logical status of future contingent propositions, which inspired\nŁukasiewicz to invent many-valued logic a few years later, was\nalready under way in Lwów before the First World War. \n In “Is the class of classes not subordinate to themselves\nsubordinate to itself?” (1914) Leśniewski offers his first\npublished analysis of Russell’s Paradox, claiming that ‘the\nclass of \\(A\\)s’ refers to the unique mereological sum of\n\\(A\\)s, so that since every object is subordinate to itself, no\nclass of objects is not subordinate to itself, and Russell’s\nParadox fails to arise. The non-standard term ‘subordinate\nto’ which he took from Łukasiewicz, is defined by\nLeśniewski as follows. An object \\(P\\) is subordinate to a\nclass \\(K\\) if and only if, for some a, \\(K\\) is a class of\n\\(a\\)s (a mereological sum of \\(a\\)s, as we shall see), and\n\\(P\\) is an \\(a\\). Let \\(P\\) be a hemispherical part of\na sphere \\(Q\\). The class of all hemispheres of \\(Q\\) is, on\nLeśniewski’s understanding, simply \\(Q\\) itself, so\n\\(P\\) is subordinate to \\(Q\\). In fact, according to this\nview, any object is a class, and subordinate to itself. Leśniewski\nretained this “concrete” understanding of classes\nthroughout his life, claiming that it conformed to Cantor’s own\nstatements. That other set theories gave a different account of things\nwas in Leśniewski’s view their problem, not his. \n During World War I, when Leśniewski lived in Moscow, he completed\n“Foundations of a General Theory of Sets I” (1916). Despite\nthe use of the term ‘mnogość’ (set),\nthis was a first rigorous deductive presentation of the theory of\nparts, wholes and concrete collections. Leśniewski later dropped\nthe term ‘mnogość’ and instead invented\nthe term ‘Mereology’, meaning ‘theory of\nparts’, an irregular coinage from the Greek\nμερος, part, in order to\ndifferentiate his view from what he ironically called\n“official” set theory. In this paper the language is a\nhighly regimented Polish supplemented with variables, because at the\ntime Leśniewski did not trust symbolic methods, having found the\nuse/mention confusions in Whitehead and Russell’s Principia\nMathematica a barrier to understanding, and assuming any symbolic\nlogic had to be like that. Only later did Leśniewski discover the\nmuch tidier work of Frege, which he thereafter held up as the foremost\nexample of symbolic logic to that date. Leśniewski was one of the\nearliest logicians to appreciate the virtues of Frege’s logical\nwork as largely independent of its inconsistency. In later years,\nLeśniewski proved that Frege’s “way out” of the\nparadox, which involved a restriction of the fatal abstraction\nprinciple Basic Law V, had the unacceptable consequence that there\ncould not be more than one object. This work was not published, but was\nreconstructed after World War II by Sobociński (1949). \n \nIt is important for understanding Leśniewski’s development and\nhis attitude to logical systems as endowed with meaning from the\nstart, and not meaningless formal games, to know that he developed in\nhis systems chronologically in the reverse order from their order of\nlogical priority. Logically, protothetic precedes ontology, and\nontology precedes mereology, but he worked them out starting from\nmereology and working through ontology to finish with\nprotothetic. Becoming frustrated with the inexactnesses and foibles of\nnatural language as a medium for working, in 1920 Leśniewski let\nhimself be persuaded by Leon Chwistek that it would be advantageous to\novercome his distaste for symbolism and formulate his logical thoughts\nusing symbols. Mereology having been rather well formulated already in\n1916, the transition to symbolism was straightforward there. The fact\nthat axiomatization came first, and symbolization of the already\naxiomatized theory followed subsequently, gave Leśniewski a\nstrong reason to dissociate the use of formal methods from\nformalism, according to which formulas are without\ninterpretation. Leśniewski’s formulas had an intended\ninterpretation from the start. \n \nThe original (1916) formulation of Mereology, not yet so called, and\nnot yet formalized with special symbols, had the primitive concept\n‘part’, four axioms and three definitions at its basis.\nThey are: \nAxiom I. If object \\(A\\) is part of object \\(B\\), then\n\\(B\\) is not part of \\(A\\) \n \nAxiom II. If object \\(A\\) is part of object \\(B\\), and\nobject \\(B\\) is part of object \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) is part\nof C. \n \nThese specify respectively the asymmetry and transitivity of the\npart relation. \n \nDefinition I. The expression ‘ingredient of object\n\\(A\\)’ is used to denote \\(A\\), and every part of\n\\(A\\).\n\n \n \nThat is: Object \\(B\\) is an ingredient of object \\(A\\) if\nand only if either \\(B\\) is \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is part of\n\\(A\\). Nowadays the term ‘ingredient’ is often simply\nrendered as ‘part’ and Leśniewski’s\n‘part’ is called ‘proper part’. \n \nDefinition II. The expression ‘set\n[mnogość] of objects \\(m\\)’ is used to\ndenote every object \\(A\\) such that if \\(B\\) is any\ningredient of \\(A\\), then some ingredient of \\(B\\) is an\ningredient of some \\(m\\), and this \\(m\\) is an ingredient of\n\\(A\\).\n\n \n \nThat is: \\(A\\) is a set of \\(m\\) if and only if every\ningredient of \\(A\\) has a common ingredient with (mereologically\noverlaps) some \\(m\\), and this \\(m\\) is part of \\(A\\).\nIntuitively, a set of \\(m\\) is what we would now call a\nmereological sum, consisting of one or more \\(m\\), but not\nnecessarily all of the \\(m\\). \n \nDefinition III. The expressions ‘set of all objects\n\\(m\\)’ and ‘class [klasa] of objects\n\\(m\\)’ are used to denote every object \\(A\\) such that\n(i) every \\(m\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\), and (ii) if\n\\(B\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\), then some ingredient of\n\\(B\\) is an ingredient of some \\(m\\).\n\n \n \nThat is: a class of \\(m\\) is a set of all the \\(m\\). The\nremaining two axioms state that such classes exist and are unique: \n Axiom III. If some object is (an) \\(m\\), then some object is a\nclass of objects \\(m\\). \n \nAxiom IV. If \\(A\\) is a class of objects \\(m\\), and\n\\(B\\) is a class of objects \\(m\\), then \\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\). \n \nWith these axioms we may speak of ‘the class of\n\\(m\\)’ whenever there is at least one \\(m\\). \n In terms of these basic principles, Leśniewski proves a number of\ntheorems and defines several important mereological concepts, such as\noverlapping (having an ingredient in common) and being exterior to\n(having no ingredient in common). It is characteristic of this essay\nthat Leśniewski is keen to appropriate the terminology of set\ntheory for his own purposes. Further terminology includes\n‘element’, which is defined as follows: \n \nDefinition IV. The term ‘element of object \\(A\\)’\nis used to denote any object \\(B\\) which, for some meaning of the\nexpression ‘\\(x\\)’, is such that (i) \\(A\\) is the\nclass of objects \\(x\\), and (ii) \\(B\\) is (an)\n\\(x\\).\n\n \n \nIt is swiftly proved that the ingredients of \\(A\\) and the\nelements of \\(A\\) are the same. The definition illustrates how\nLeśniewski formulated the idea of quantification in his early\nsemi-prose work: instead of “for some \\(x\\)” he says\n“for some meaning of the expression ‘\\(x\\)’\n”. When showing all ingredients of an object are its elements,\nLeśniewski instantiates the bound variable by saying “Using\nthe expression ‘\\(x\\)’ with the meaning of the\nexpression ‘ingredient of the object \\(A\\)’\n…”. We will return to this below when discussing\nLeśniewski’s understanding of the quantifiers. \n By Leśniewski’s own later and very exacting standards, this\nfirst formulation of Mereology is methodologically imperfect, because\nit intersperses axioms and definitions. A cleaner formulation would\nexpress all axioms in terms of the mereological primitive (here\n‘part’) only. This would be possible in this case simply by\nsubstituting the definitions of defined terms in Axioms III and IV, but\nit would not be especially enlightening. It also results in an axiom\nsystem that can be substantially simplified, both by reducing the\nnumber of axioms and by simplifying and shortening them. These\ndesiderata (fewer, shorter, and more perspicuous axioms) often\npull in different directions. \n \nThe language of Mereology in 1916 used many expressions besides the\nspecifically mereological primitive ‘part’: in addition to\nnominal variables, there are expressions forming sentences from nominal\nvariables, as in ‘\\(A\\) is (a) \\(b\\)’,\n‘\\(A\\) is \\(B\\)’, ‘every \\(a\\) is a\n\\(b\\)’, ‘some \\(a\\) is a \\(b\\), ‘no\n\\(a\\) is a \\(b\\)’, as well as words such as\n‘object’ and ‘exist’. Complex names also occur\nin sentences, as the expressions ‘part of \\(A\\)’ and\n‘ingredient of \\(A\\)’ in ‘every part of\n\\(A\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\)’. Leśniewski had\nhitherto taken such logical bits of language for granted, but now he\nneeded to formalize them. He wanted a logical calculus of names and the\nexpressions involving them. There were precedents in traditional\nsyllogistic, and more especially in the algebra of logic of Ernst\nSchröder, which Leśniewski looked at in coming up with his\nown system, based as in the case of Mereology on his intuitive\nunderstanding of the relevant expressions as carefully used in ordinary\nlanguage. At first he gathered propositions he was sure were true, such\nas ‘If \\(A\\) is \\(b\\), then \\(A\\) is\n\\(A\\)’. We know about this one because it is mentioned,\npresumably scornfully, in a diary entry by Twardowski for 1 July 1919,\nas being the first axiom of the new system that Leśniewski was\nworking on at the time. Leśniewski has left us a graphic\ndescription of his method of working at this crucial and fluid time of\nhis development [Collected Works 366–9]: \n \nWhile working in this way, and attempting to define some expressions\nin terms of others, Leśniewski came to focus on singular\npropositions of the form ‘\\(A\\) is (a) \\(b\\)’,\nwhich he henceforth wrote as ‘\\(A \\isa b\\)’, borrowing from Peano the lower-case epsilon, the\nfirst letter of the Greek ‘εστι’,\nis. It was this connection with meanings of ‘is’\nthat prompted Leśniewski to name this system\n‘Ontology’. He thought it would be possible to base it on\nsingular inclusions like ‘\\(A \\isa b\\)’\nalone, in addition to concepts taken from the logic of connectives and\nquantifiers. The key thought was that the following should be true \n \\(A\\) is \\(a\\) if and only if (every \\(A\\) is\n\\(a\\), and at most one object is \\(A)\\)\n  \n \nThis requires the two expressions ‘every \\(A\\) is\n\\(a\\)’ and ‘at most one object is \\(A\\)’ to\nbe defined. The first can be helped along by \n every \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) if and only if (some object is\n\\(a\\), and for any \\(X\\), if \\(X\\) is \\(a\\), then\n\\(X\\) is \\(b)\\)\n  \n \nwhich requires ‘some’ and ‘object’ to be\ndefined: they can be helped further by \n some \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) if and only if for some \\(X,\nX\\) is \\(a\\) and \\(X\\) is \\(b\\) \n if \\(A\\) is \\(b\\), then \\(A\\) is an object \n \nwhile the second can be helped by \n at most one object is \\(a\\) if and only if for any \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), if \\(A\\) is \\(a\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(a\\),\nthen \\(A\\) is the same object as \\(B\\)\n  \n \nand finally we have \n \\(A\\) is the same object as \\(B\\) if and only if \\((A\\)\nis \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(A)\\).\n  \n \nPutting these together, and inspired by Russell’s theory of\ndefinite descriptions, Leśniewski arrived in 1920 at a single\naxiom based on the single primitive ‘is’: \n \n\\(A\\) is \\(a\\) if and only if ((for some \\(B,\nB\\) is \\(A)\\) and (for any \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), if\n\\(B\\) is \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) is \\(A\\), then \\(B\\)\nis \\(C)\\), and (for any \\(B\\), if \\(B\\) is \\(A\\)\nthen \\(B\\) is \\(a))\\)\n  \n \nThe story has it that Leśniewski discovered this axiom, his\nefforts fortified by eating bars of chocolate, while sitting on a bench\nin Warsaw’s Saxon Garden. Symbolically, using a somewhat more\nmodern symbolism than Leśniewski’s, but borrowing his upper\ncorners for marking quantifier scope, the axiom becomes \n \nSeveral things are notable about this axiom and its formulation. It is\nin the form of a universally quantified equivalence, with the\nright-hand side as it were explicating the left-hand side, so that it\nis a kind of implicit definition of the primitive\n‘\\(\\isa\\)’. The right-hand side, taking its cue from\nRussell, says that there is at least one \\(A\\) (first conjunct),\nthere is at most one \\(A\\) (second conjunct), and any \\(A\\)\nis an \\(a\\) (third conjunct). The use of capital letter variables\nis an informal aid to perspicuity: they mark the positions in\nsentences (especially before ‘\\(\\isa\\)’) where a variable\ncan only yield a truth of its immediate context if it is\nsingular. Where small Italic variables are used, there is no such\npresumption of singularity. In principle only one typeface of\nvariables is needed. On the basis of his axiom and several rules of\ninference, Leśniewski developed a powerful system of general\nlogic comparable in strength to a simple type theory: he writes in\n1929, “In 1921 I developed my ‘theory of types’\n[…] It was something like Whitehead’s and Russell’s theory of\ntypes, which I had generalised and simplified in a certain way”\n(Collected Works, 421).  \n \nBoth Mereology and Ontology presuppose a deeper logical layer,\ncomprising a propositional logic of connectives like ‘if’,\n‘not’ and ‘and’, and the as yet unexplicated\nlogic of the quantifiers ‘for all’ (‘\\(\\forall\\)’)\nand ‘for some’ (‘\\(\\exists\\)’). Having settled\nOntology on an axiomatic basis, Leśniewski turned to the\naxiomatization of this. He originally spoke of the “theory of\ndeduction”, which was the name Whitehead and Russell used for the\npropositional calculus, but because they did not introduce a logic of\nquantifiers until later, he coined the term ‘Protothetic’,\nfrom the Greek for ‘first theses’. It is characteristic of\nLeśniewski’s logic that he introduces quantifiers in the\nmost basic part of his logic, even before names are introduced. This is\nunlike most modern theories, which introduce quantifiers only when\nnames and predicates are brought in. It leads to questions about the\nnature of quantification in Leśniewski which we will revisit\nbelow. \n Leśniewski’s preference for an axiom system, based in part\non the success of Ontology, and also on considerations about the nature\nof definition, was to base a logical system on the single connective of\nmaterial equivalence, together with the universal quantifier. He was\nheld up for some time in doing this for Protothetic by his inability to\nsee how to eliminate the connective of conjunction in terms of\nequivalence. Given quantification and equivalence, negation is easy to\ndefine, in a way Russell once suggested to Frege: \n \nThe solution was found for Leśniewski by his 21-year-old\ndoctoral student Alfred Teitelbaum, later renowned under his adopted\nname as Alfred Tarski. It consisted in quantifying not just sentences\nbut sentential functions or connectives: \n \nin this case, quantifying one-place connectives. Assuming there are just four of\nthese connectives, assertion, negation, Verum (tautology) and\nFalsum (contradiction), it is straightforward to show that the\nright-hand side is equivalent to the conjunction of \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\). Tarski’s doctoral dissertation centres around this\nresult. \n As to axiomatization, Leśniewski knew that the pure theory of\nequivalence could be based on two axioms stating skew-transitivity and\nassociativity: \n \nPure equivalential calculus has the quaint property, shown by\nLeśniewski, that a formula is a theorem if and only if every\npropositional variable in it occurs an even number of times. After\nuniversally quantifying these axioms, a further axiom was added to\nintroduce propositional functions, in this case two-placed ones \n \nOnce again Leśniewski and his students sought after shorter and\nmore perspicuous formulations, or ones consisting of a single axiom,\nthough the latter tended to be neither short nor perspicuous. \n With Protothetic launched, Leśniewski could now look back on his\nsystem of foundations and see that it consisted of a hierarchy of three\nsystems, developed in reverse order: Protothetic, introducing\nconnectives, quantifiers and higher functions; Ontology, introducing\nthe new category of names, with the new primitive ‘is’, and\nMereology, based on a primitive mereological functor such as\n‘part of’ or ‘ingredient of’, but introducing\nno new categories of expressions not already foreseen in Ontology. \n \nOne of Leśniewski’s most lasting contributions to the metatheory\nof logic is his theory of semantic categories. This replaced the\ntheory of simple types which he developed in 1921, about which he\nwrote, “[E]ven as I was constructing my theory of types, I\nconsidered it to be only an inadequate stop-gap […] In 1922 I\noutlined a concept of semantical categories as a replacement for the\nhierarchy of types, which is quite unintuitive to me”\n(Collected Works, 421). In type theory, expressions belonging\nto different logical types cannot be substituted for one another\nwithout turning grammatical or well-formed expressions into\nungrammatical or ill-formed ones. Only well-formed or grammatical\nexpressions may have a sense or meaning. The theory was developed by\nBertrand Russell as a way of blocking set-theoretic paradoxes, though\nthere were anticipations in the work of Ernst Schröder and\nGottlob Frege. In type theory it is usually assumed that variables at\neach type range over a domain of entities specific to that type, and\nthat all such domains are mutually disjoint. In Frege for instance\nthe domains were objects and functions of various levels, while in\nRussell they are usually taken to be a hierarchy of propositional\nfunctions. This presumptively platonistic and ontologically\ninflationary position was naturally uncongenial to the nominalist\nLeśniewski, and he readjusted the notion of category, turning\ncategories from classes of entities (with their attendant expressions)\nto classes of expressions alone. His inspiration was in part the\ntraditional syntactic theory of different parts of speech, and in part\nHusserl’s theory of Bedeutungskategorien (meaning categories)\nfrom the latter’s Logical Investigations. Where Husserl’s\ncategories were of abstract meanings, Leśniewski, ever the\nnominalist, substituted categories of (concrete) expressions. Although\nlike later writers he could have called the classes of expressions\n‘syntactic categories’, he deliberately chose the\nexpression ‘semantic categories’ in order to emphasize\nthat the expressions combined grammatically are all meaningful, unlike\nthe meaningless marks proposed by formalist writers of the Hilbert\nSchool. \n Leśniewski himself never gave an explicit formulation of the\ntheory of semantic categories, being content to work with them in\npractice. The first formulation was by his contemporary Kazimierz\nAjdukiewicz, in the 1935 article ‘Syntactic Connection’.\nAjdukiewicz’s essay became the fountainhead of the subsequent\nsubdiscipline of categorial grammar. Modifying Ajdukiewicz’s\nnotation, we may explain semantic categories as Leśniewski used\nthem. Leśniewski thought that the theory applies only to\nhis logical systems, not to ordinary language,\nabout which he became rather sceptical as to its ability\nto be unambiguously precise. Subsequently it has been shown that\ncategorial grammar can be applied quite successfully to the syntax of\nnatural languages. \n There are in Leśniewski two basic categories: sentence (S) and\nname (N). In Protothetic, only the former is used: Ontology and\nMereology add the latter. The distinction between sentences and names\nis ultimate: what we can say about sentences is that they are there to\nsay things that are true or false (obviously from a logical point of\nview we are overlooking questions and commands), whereas names are\nthere to denote things. Leśniewski, following tradition, allows\nnames to denote several things, or one thing, or indeed no things as\nall. So ‘Istanbul’ denotes one thing, namely the Turkish\ncity, ‘city’ denotes many things, namely all cities, and\n‘unicorn’ denotes nothing at all. In\nLeśniewski’s mature work Mill’s notion of connotation\nis dropped, along with the concept of property which it employs, so the\nsole logical function of names is denoting. Again following tradition\nrather than the modern approach of Frege and Russell, Leśniewski\nmakes no syntactic distinction between general terms or common\nnouns on the one hand and singular terms or proper names on the other.\nThis is often said to be because his native Polish lacks definite and\nindefinite articles, which make the distinction more grammatically\nobvious, but this conjecture is nonsense because Leśniewski spoke\nand wrote fluent German, and German is awash with articles. It seems much more\nlikely that Leśniewski deliberately chose to follow the\ntraditional rather than the modern way because he thought it both more\nexpressively powerful and closer to natural language. \n Since language does not consist solely of unarticulated sentences or\nnames, there are expressions of other categories, which combine in a\nrule-governed way with one another to produce further expressions,\nultimately sentences. In the regimented environment of\nLeśniewski’s logical languages this always takes place in\nthe following way: a combining expression, which we may call a\nfunctor, precedes a left parenthesis of some kind, which is\nthen followed by a sequence of one or more argument\nexpressions, followed by a right parenthesis symmetric to the other\none, which terminates the complex. The general schema is then \n functor + left parenthesis + argument 1 + … + argument \\(n\\) + right parenthesis\n \n \nas exemplified by \n \nor, more concretely, \\({\\sim}(p), \\koppa(pq), \\isa \\{Aa\\}\\). \n Now let us provide a notation, inspired by Ajdukiewicz, for the\ncategory of a functor such as ‘\\(F\\)’. If the category of\n‘\\(a_1\\)’ is \\(\\alpha_1\\), the category of\n‘\\(a_n\\)’ is \\(\\alpha_n\\), and the category of the whole\nexpression ‘\\(F(a_1 \\ldots a_n)\\)’ is \\(\\beta\\), then the\ncategory of the functor expression ‘\\(F\\)’ we write as \n \nwhich indicates the category of the output to the left and the\ncategory of its inputs in order within the angled brackets. Call this\nthe categorial index of the expression. Thus the category of\nsentential negation is\n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rS\\rangle\\),\n that of conjunction is\n\\(\\rS\\langle\\rS\\rS\\rangle\\),\n while that of the epsilon functor ‘\\(\\isa\\)’ is \n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle\\),\n since it builds a sentence using two names as arguments. \n What Ajdukiewicz showed in his 1935 paper was that we can develop a\ncalculus of grammatical combination using such a notation: we take a\nputatively well-formed expression, rearrange it if necessary into\nfunctor-first order, then see if we can “multiply out”\narguments and functors to arrive at a single categorial index. If we\ncan, the complex expression is grammatical, well-formed, or\nsyntactically connected. For example\n‘\\(\\isa\\{Aa\\}\\)’ is syntactically connected as\nfollows: writing the category of an expression \\(e\\) as\n\\(|e|\\) we have \n \nas we would expect. Ajdukiewicz used a “quotient”\nnotation instead of our angled brackets; this makes the idea of\n“multiplying out” more graphic, but becomes cumbersome for\ncomplex cases. \n There may be functors whose arguments are functors: for example a\nconjunction holding between two binary predicates has a category\n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle \\rangle\\).\n There may also be what are called many-link functors, which\nare functors whose values are functors. For example, the English\nmorpheme ‘–ly’ converts an adjective, category\n \\(\\rN\\langle\\rN\\rangle\\),\n into an adverb, for example of category \n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\langle\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\rangle\\),\n so ‘–ly’ has effective category\n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\langle\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\rangle \\langle\\rN\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\rangle\\). \n In some subsequent categorial grammars, transitive verbs are quite\nplausibly taken to have the many-link category\n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rangle \\langle\\rN\\rangle\\)\n rather than the binary predicate category \n \\(\\rS\\langle\\rN\\rN\\rangle\\).\n This move is indeed a standard trick in logic, first introduced by\nMoses Schönfinkel in 1924, for dispensing with many-placed\nfunctors in favor of many-link but one-placed functors. Had he known\nof this, Leśniewski would no doubt have disapproved. While there\nis no loss of logical power in eliminating many-placed functors, the\nmove is unnatural, and Leśniewski would not have countenanced\ndefining many-placed functors as many-link ones in disguise,\nas we find in Church for instance. \n With the two basic categories of sentence and name, every category and\nexpression, no matter how complex, will have a categorial index\nbeginning either with ‘S’, so ultimately leading to the\nformation of a sentence, or ‘N’, so ultimately leading to\nthe formation of a name. Following a useful terminological suggestion\nof Eugene Luschei, we may call the former propositive\ncategories and expressions, the latter nominative categories\nand expressions (Luschei 1962, 169). \n Note that the parentheses in Leśniewski’s notation do not\nthemselves have a category: they are syncategorematic. Their function\nis twofold: to mark the beginnings and ends of argument strings, and to\nhelp indicate the semantic category of the functors. Thus\nLeśniewski used round parentheses for functors yielding sentences\nfrom sentences, i.e. connectives, and braces for functors yielding\nsentences from names, i.e. predicates. In principle an unlimited number\nof shapes of parentheses might be required, and indeed in some works of\nstudents of Sobociński there are several dozens of different\nshapes. Leśniewski gave parentheses this second role because he\nwished to remain very flexible about the forms of expression used for\nfunctors, even allowing the same shape to be used in\n“analogous” functors, for example 3-placed conjunction, or\n“higher-order” epsilons and equivalences, or other logical\nconstants. Obviously this is a contingent feature of his notation:\nother conventions will do just as well. \nMore important for metalogical purposes is the fact that the universal\nquantifier too is syncategorematic in Leśniewski. This is marked\nsymbolically in that the lower corners which he used to symbolize the\nuniversal quantifier are no more than a container for the variables,\nbut more crucially, in that any finite string of different variables\nmay occur in such a quantifier, no matter how assorted their\ncategories. There are some advantages in this\nflexibility. Leśniewski does not need to give rules for many\ndifferent kinds of universal quantifier, but gives rules for the one\nsort in one go. But there are some disadvantages too. In his\n“official” notation for his logics, Leśniewski has\nonly the universal quantifier, and does not define the particular\nquantifier or any others in the standard way. This was also Frege’s\npractice, but whereas in Frege’s case the parsimony seems to have been\nself-inflicted, in Leśniewski’s case there is a systematic\nreason. Leśniewski was scrupulous about giving exact rules for\nadmitting new expressions by definition. He gave such rules for\nProtothetic, and extended them to Ontology. These rules govern only\nbasic and functor category expressions. Quantifiers, being variable\nbinders, are neither basic nor functor expressions, but\nLeśniewski was unable to come up with acceptable canons of\ndefinition for such variable binders. He would have liked to have done\nso, and indeed offered students any degree they wanted, from Master’s\nto\nHabilitation, if they could formulate adequate rules, but no\none could. Therefore in the “official” system the\nuniversal quantifier remained as a syncategorematic expression, but\nstill entered into legal combinations, which meant that the syntax of\nhis systems was not fully captured by categorial grammar. Such a\nlimitation became apparent to Ajdukiewicz also, who made an\nunsuccessful attempt to rectify it. Ajdukiewicz noted perceptively\nthat a language containing Russell’s circumflex abstraction operator,\nwhich Alonzo Church had notated using the Greek lambda, would be able\nto express any operator as a combination of an abstraction operator with a\nfunctor. Church employed this method to considerable advantage in his\nlogic, but this work came too late to help Leśniewski. In any\ncase, in Church it simply pushed the problem of syncategorematicity\nover to the lambda operator. \n \nThe status of definitions in logic and outside it has been\nsurprisingly controversial. Probably the standard view among logicians\nis that of Russell, according to which definitions are mere\nabbreviations whose role is to render complex propositions more easily\nsurveyable by feeble humans. According to this view, when a logician\ndefines, say, conjunction in terms of implication and negation, as \n \nthis is to be understood as merely a shorter expression substituting\nfor the longer one. In this case the abbreviatory value is negligible,\nbut in the case of some long expressions, such as that for the\nancestral of a relation, or in very many areas of mathematics, it may\nbe considerable. Russell expressed this view somewhat\nover-dramatically by calling a definition an expression of the\nauthor’s will. On this view, a definition cannot be true or false; it\nmay be appropriate or helpful, or not, and there are certain\nproprieties to be observed, such as not having dangling variables in\neither definiens or definiendum, and not trying to define an\nexpression in terms of itself, but beyond this, the methodological\nrequirements on abbreviation are minimal. In many modern logical\nsystems, definitions are said to be confined to the metalanguage only,\nand not to appear in the object language at all. \n There is nothing wrong with this view, but it is emphatically not\nthat of Leśniewski. According to him, a definition introduces a\nnew expression into the object language. Again, the proprieties have\nto be respected, and getting these right turns out to be a tricky\nmatter. Also, it is up to the author of a logical system as to which\ndefinitions he or she chooses to introduce. But there is an important\ndifference. Since definitions add new expressions to the object\nlanguage, they add expressions in places where they can be quantified,\nand so can enhance the system’s expressive power. Leśniewski\nadmits this option: according to him it is the logician’s job to keep\nadding to the system. If in the process, new things are provable that\nwere not provable before, so much the better, provided the proprieties\nare respected. If we can prove a theorem not containing a defined\nexpression after a definition has been introduced that could\nnot be proved before, the definition is said to be\ncreative. Most logicians decry creative definitions:\nLeśniewski embraced them. Leśniewski contended that the\nsymbol ‘=Def.’ used by most logicians actually sneaks an\nunrecognized primitive into their work. He thought this of Whitehead\nand Russell, and it is why he wanted to formulate Protothetic based on\nequivalence alone, since then the same connective is primitive that is\nused for definitions. In his view, definitions are object-language\nequivalences and should be recognized as such. In retrospect we can\nsee that this view was too extreme. There is room for abbreviatory\ndefinitions, and indeed Leśniewski “unofficially” used\none himself, that of the particular quantifier. What Leśniewski\ncalls ‘definitions’ might better be called\n‘definitional axioms’. That these can be added as we go\nalong rather than collected together at the beginning of a logic is\nsimply a feature of his way of doing logic. \n Perhaps the most important creative definition used by\nLeśniewski is one from Ontology, due to Tarski in 1921. Is is for\na functor * of category\n \\(\\rN\\langle\\rN\\rangle\\): \n \nwhere ‘\\(A \\isa *(B)\\)’ can be read as\n‘\\(A\\) is the unique \\(B\\)’. It allowed the long\naxiom of Ontology to be replaced by the short one (see below): without\nit, the replacement was not possible. \n \nWe noted that Leśniewski, persuaded by his argument against\nTwardowski’s general objects, was a nominalist. It was no doubt part\nof his antipathy towards set theory. His friend Kotarbiński\nformulated a very extreme nominalism, called variously reism,\npansomatism, and concretism, according to which the only things that\nexist are material bodies. Leśniewski would not go this far,\nbecause he did not see how after-images and dreamt things, which he\nthought existed, could be material bodies. But in elaborating his\nlogic he emphatically rejects anything which is not concrete,\nindividual, located in space and time. This goes for the logical\nsystems themselves. His view, which would nowadays be called\ninscriptionalism, is that logical systems are actual\ncollections of concrete marks, whether printed on paper in books and\njournals, or in handwritten notes, or more ephemerally as spoken\nwords, chalk marks on blackboards, or (nowadays) patterns on computer\nscreens. Leaving aside the non-trivial metaphysical question of what\ncan in principle count as a logical inscription, we must consider what\neffect this stance had on his attitude to logic and logic systems. \n The effect is far-reaching and radical. If a logical system is a\nconcrete complex of signs, then it cannot be infinite. Also, to\nconform to logical practice, it has to be admitted that logical\nsystems change over time. Ideally, they change by being added to, as\nnew theorems are proved. In practice, they may degrade or be wholly\ndestroyed, which was indeed the sad fate of Leśniewski’s own\npersonally written systems in November 1944. If a logical system is\npublished in a book or journal, and there are several copies, then\nthere are as many such systems as there are copies. Assuming the\ncopies are all faithful, then each copy is typographically exactly\nlike all the others. They are, in Leśniewski’s parlance, all\nequiform. In practice of course, equiformity is not quite\nexact, even in printed works, but the minute variations are\ninsignificant, and in any case we wish to recognize handwritten\nmanuscripts and other variants to be equiform for logical purposes\nwith systems which are physically somewhat different. Again the\nmetaphysical fine detail is less important that the fact that we get\nby most of the time with constrainedly inexact similarity. \n Almost all metalogical ways of dealing with logical systems are\nplatonistic. They assume that the simple and complex expressions are\nabstract types, that they are infinite in number, that an axiom system\nhas infinitely many logical theorems, and so on. Leśniewski can\nadmit none of this. So he has to find a way to deal with logical\nsystems as something organic, growing and changing with time. He does\nso by employing a complex system of metalogical definitions, which he\ncalls ‘terminological explanations’, and inference rules,\nwhich he calls ‘directives’. In effect Leśniewski\ngives a schematic grammatical and logical framework for an\nindefinitely extensible language, decades in advance of the advent of\nformal descriptions of computer programming languages, which are the\nnearest equivalent elsewhere. \n It is hard to give a flavor of the terminological explanations (TEs)\nin a short space: their complexity and cumulative effect has to\nappreciated at first hand. The most thorough account is in the TEs for\nProtothetic in Grundzüge, Section 11, and there is also\na compressed account of TEs for Ontology. A somewhat more manageable\nset for a version of propositional calculus with definitions, based on\nŁukasiewicz’s bracketless notation, is given in the 1931 paper\n‘Über Definitionen in der sogenannten Theorie der\nDeduktion’, and based on lectures from 1930–31. There\nLeśniewski gives TEs in words rather than symbolic abbreviations,\nand with copious examples. Nevertheless, it is intellectually\nchallenging, since for all the complex TEs (metalogical definitions),\nLeśniewski demanded logical independence of all the various\nclauses, to be shown by suitable models. As a result, it took graduate\nstudents three semesters to work through a set of TEs in\nLeśniewski’s seminar (personal information from Czesław\nLejewski) . \nThe TEs are a means to an end: that of formulating a system’s\ndirectives. A directive sounds like an imperative, but its\nillocutionary force is subtler. Assume a logical system has been\ndeveloped up to a certain point, that is, up to a certain last written\nthesis (Leśniewski’s word covering axioms, theorems and\ndefinitions). At the very least, the axiom or axioms will have been\nwritten down. Assume for the sake of argument that the development has\nbeen fine up to now. There is no categorical imperative to extend the\nsystem by adding another thesis, but let us suppose the system’s\nauthor (or indeed any assistant) wishes to do so. He or she writes\ndown a new collection of marks. Not just anything goes however. The\nmarks have to be legible (obviously), unequivocally dissectible into\nelementary symbols (that Leśniewski calls words),\ngrammatically well-formed as a sentence (no unbound variables are\nallowed), and finally admissible according to the\ndirectives. The directives lay down what may be admitted next\nafter a given sequence of theses. For example, the next thesis may be\nan instantiation from a previous universally quantified thesis, or a\nmodus ponens from two previous theses, or a quantifier\ndistribution from a previous thesis, or a definition acceptable\naccording to the canons, or a thesis of extensionality. Admissibility\nis always relativized to the prior sequence: the order of introduction\nmatters. If the new candidate thesis is admissible according to one of\nthe directives, it passes the test and becomes part of the system,\nwhich can then be extended still further. Otherwise it is rejected and\nthe system is not extended. \n Leśniewski’s supreme achievement as a logician, in his own eyes,\nwas to formulate the metalogical requirements for extending a concrete\nsystem by directives, relative to the previous state of the\nsystem. Since the system is not planned or fixed in advance, the TEs\nand directives have to be schematically flexible enough to accommodate\nany future additions, while not being so liberal as to allow\ncontradictions or nonsense to arise. Finding that balance, most\nespecially in the rules for admissible definitions, was a considerable\nfeat. The definition of ‘definition’ for Protothetic run\nto 18 separate complex clauses, and in Ontology, which adds a second\nstyle of definition, another 18 clauses. \n Definitions, which seem so peripheral to most logical systems, are in\nfact key to the potential power of Leśniewski’s logic. The axioms\nof a system generally use very few semantic categories near the bottom\nof the recursive hierarchy. It is by definitions that new semantic\ncategories are introduced into the system; once a new category is in,\nvariables for it may be introduced and quantified, a thesis of\nextensionality formulated for it, and it can provide arguments for\nfurther, higher-level functors. So although, unlike a typed logic\nconceived platonistically, only finitely many types or categories are\nactually in play in any one system, the potential to go on is\nrestricted only by contingent limitations. \n The easiest way to get an idea of how definitions work in\nLeśniewski’s logic is not to look at the published work on\nMereology or Protothetic, but at the extended list of\n“Definitions and Theses of Leśniewski’s Ontology”\nfrom S. Leśniewski’s Lecture Notes on Logic, published\nin 1988. Taken from student notes of a 1929–30 lecture\ncourse ‘Elementary Outline of Ontology’, they comprise one\naxiom, 59 definitions and 633 listed (not proved) theorems, covering\nsyllogistic, Boolean algebra, the notions of property(-predicate) and\nhigher-order property, relations, higher-order epsilons, and several\nchunks of the theory of relations including converses, fields and\nrelative products, as known from Peirce, Schröder, Whitehead and\nRussell. Not coincidentally, the sketched development includes a large\nnumber of styles of parentheses. \n \nMuch has been written about the way in which Leśniewski\nunderstood the quantifiers ‘for some’ \\((\\exists)\\) and\n‘for all’ \\((\\forall)\\). There are three aspects to the\ncontroversy: (1) how the quantifiers are to be read; (2) how they are\nto be understood; and (3) the logical and philosophical significance\nof the way they are understood. The controversy arose principally\nbecause of a discrepancy between the way in which Leśniewski and\nLeśniewskians take the quantifiers to mean, and the orthodox way\nof understanding them, as formulated in particular by Quine.\nLeśniewski’s student Lejewski recounts how after moving from\nPoland to Britain he was surprised to find that the local (Quinean)\nunderstanding was very different from the one he had grown up\nwith. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Leśniewski did\nnot produce or even envisage a semantics for his logic, considering,\nas had Frege and Russell, that his system was already meaningful and\nhad no need of a semantics to be grafted onto it from\noutside. Historically it is interesting that Quine’s preoccupation\nwith the idea of ontological commitment and its connection to\nquantification and its domain, go back to discussions he had with\nLeśniewski when he visited Warsaw in 1933. Quine relates that he\nand Leśniewski stayed up until late at night disputing whether\nthe use of higher-order variables committed Leśniewski to\nplatonic objects, as Quine thought, or not, as Leśniewski\nthought. Obviously to a nominalist like Leśniewski the thought\nthat his cherished system should involve him in unwanted ontological\ncommitments would be most repugnant. \n As to the reading of the quantifiers, while we note that in his\npre-symbolic writings Leśniewski favored expressions like\n“for some meaning of the expression ‘\\(x\\)’\n” and “for every meaning of the expression\n‘\\(x\\)’ ”, which may give us a hint as to how\nhe understood quantification, he later preferred the unadorned\n‘for some’ and ‘for all’, followed by the\nrelevant variables, and it seems sensible simply to follow this. \n The meaning or interpretation of the quantifiers is a more subtle\nquestion. It seems very likely that Leśniewski thought of the\nquantifiers as a notational necessity when a domain could be infinite,\nsince infinite disjunctions and conjunctions were not possible. In\nProtothetic, as its computational variant makes clear, there is\nstrictly no need for quantifiers, since each semantic category, no\nmatter how high in the hierarchy, has only finitely many possible\n(extensional) values. But in Ontology, where there is no logical\nrequirement that the domain of individuals be finite, the quantifiers\nare indispensable. One thing for sure is that they cannot be given an\nexistentially committed reading, where ‘for some’ means\n‘there exists’. The reason is that the laws of\nquantification and the definability in Ontology of a necessarily empty\nterm ‘\\(\\Lambda\\)’, for which it is true that no \\(\\Lambda\\)\nexists, entail the truth of the quantified proposition ‘for\nsome \\(a\\), no \\(a\\) exists’ (cf. T.127 of\n“Definitions and Theses of Leśniewski’s Ontology”\nin S. Lesniewski’s Lecture Notes in Logic). This would be\ncontradictory if ‘for some’ meant ‘there\nexists’. Leśniewski always used the expression\n‘particular quantifier’ rather than ‘existential\nquantifier’. So the question is how the quantifiers are to be\nunderstood if not in the standard way. \n Quine took from his discussions with Leśniewski the idea that\nthe quantifiers were somehow substitutional. There is an element of\ntruth in this. A universally quantified formula\n\\(\\forall X\\ldots \\ulcorner\\)—\\(X\\)—\\(\\urcorner\\)\nlicenses the inference to any formula —\\(C\\)—\nobtained by substituting any well-formed expression \\(C\\) of the\nappropriate category in place of the bound variable \\(X\\), and\nlikewise for all the other variables occurring bound by the same\nquantifier. Dually, from —\\(C\\)— one may infer\n\\(\\exists X\\ldots \\ulcorner\\)—\\(X\\)—\\(\\urcorner\\) for\nsuitable categories of bound variable. These are the usual quantifier\nrules, liberalized to apply to any categories of variable in batches\nof one or more. So for example if there is a theorem universally\nquantifying nominal variables, such as\n‘\\(\\forall a\\ulcorner\\)any \\(a\\) is an\n\\(a\\urcorner\\)’, we can validly infer ‘any \\(\\Lambda\\) is a\n\\(\\Lambda\\)’ even though the name is empty. Quine assumed that the\nlack of ontological commitment must entail that the quantifiers range\nover expressions rather than things. This would not have been\nacceptable to Leśniewski, because it would constitute use/mention\nconfusion, and because while it is true for the nominalist that there\nare only finitely many expressions, it is not known to be true, and\nmay in fact be false, that there are only finitely many things. \n Is there then a third way to understand the quantifiers that is\nneither referential nor substitutional? Such a way has been suggested\nby Guido Küng, based on the young Leśniewski’s reading of\nthe quantifiers as “for all [some] meanings of the variable\n‘\\(x\\)’ ”. Take this preamble to be what\nKüng calls a prologue functor, which mentions\nthe expression ‘\\(x\\)’, but takes its matrix (the part\nafter the quantifier, within the upper corners) to be a context of\nuse of the variable, and takes the variables to range over\nmeanings, in Leśniewski’s case, extensions (Küng 1977).\nAgain there is something right and something wrong about this. If\nextensions are (as standardly understood) various kinds of sets,\nnothing could be more abhorrent to Leśniewski. He laid great\nstore on logic\nnot being committed to the existence of anything, being\nontologically neutral: no existence statement is a theorem of\nany of his systems. So to have found that after all he is committed, by\nthe back door as it were, to the hated sets, would have been a bitter\nblow. The correct insight of this understanding is that neither objects\nnor expressions are what quantifier expressions range over. They do\nnot range over extensions either: they do not range over\nanything. But for each category of expression there are numerous ways\nin which an expression of that category can mean. A sentence can be\ntrue or it can be false. A name can name one thing, or several\nthings, all things, or no things at all. Functor expressions mean\naccording to the way the outputs of their combinations mean when\ntheir inputs have certain meanings. Given a domain of individuals, in\nprinciple all possible ways of meaning are delimited for all categories\nof expression. Quantifiers tap into this potentiality. But it goes\nagainst the nominalist grain of Leśniewski’s thought to\nreify all the different potential ways an expression could mean as if\nthese were additional objects. So when Leśniewski told Quine his\nuse of quantified variables in categories other than names did not\ncommit him to platonic objects, he was being truthful. What he was\ncommitted to, from the moment he accepted bivalence of truth and\nfalsity onwards, was that expressions of the various categories may be\nvariously meaningful. \n \nWe have seen how Leśniewski developed his logical systems in\nthe struggle to provide an antinomy-free foundation for mathematics,\ncomparable to those of Frege or Whitehead and Russell, but without\ntheir defects. His gradual move from a highly stylized\nprose-with-variables to fully formalized systems precluded him from\nconsidering his logic as an uninterpreted system, as did Hilbert. From\nthe start, he considered his systems, even the fully formalized ones,\nto be comprised of constant expressions, primitive and defined, with a\nfixed intended meaning, which he attempted to make clear by examples\nand elucidations. He also considered all his axioms and theorems to be\ntrue. In this he was following Frege and Russell, who likewise did not\nenvisage an external source as somehow conveying a meaning upon\nexpressions and truth upon sentences of logic. \n This attitude to logic began to be overtaken by the development of\nlogical semantics, not least at the hands of his own former student\nTarski. The turning point came with the publication of Tarski’s\nessay on the concept of truth in the languages of deductive sciences.\nThis paper was produced in a preliminary version in 1929–30,\nupdated when Gödel’s incompleteness results became known in\n1931, and eventually published in Polish in 1933. Leśniewski was\nknown to be opposed to it. There are probably two reasons for this. One\nis that in his metalogical apparatus Tarski avails himself of set\ntheory. Even though his use is not extensive, it is an incursion of set\ntheory into the metatheory of logic, of which Leśniewski could not\nbut disapprove. The other reason is probably that whereas in earlier\nparts of the monograph Tarski adheres faithfully to a conception of\nfinite types akin to Leśniewski’s theory of semantic\ncategories, in later parts he distances himself from this as an\nunwarranted restriction and accepts the propriety of transfinite\ntypes. \n There is in fact nothing inherently anti-semantic about\nLeśniewski’s logical systems. They may be given more\nstandard formulations and considered model-theoretically (cf. Stachniak\n1981). They may also be investigated metalogically in their own terms,\nand without reneging on Leśniewski’s scruples about abstract\nentities. The fact is that few people have considered it worth the\neffort of pursuing the project. \n \nThroughout the 1920s, Leśniewski and his students worked hard\nto improve the logical systems by finding single axioms, shorter\naxioms, trying out new primitives, and generally seeking logical\nperfection. The work, and Leśniewski’s involvement in\nteaching, were so intense that for several years he published nothing.\nAs this became something of an embarrassment, since his results were\nbeing quoted without being in print, he resolved to postpone a fully\nsystematic exposition and present instead a more autobiographical\naccount of how the systems arose and were improved. This took the form\nof two series of articles from 1927–31. One series, ‘O\npodstawach matematyki’ [‘On the Foundations of\nMathematics’] appeared in the premier Polish philosophy journal\nPrzegląd Filozoficzny, and, eschewing mathematical\nsymbolism, was dedicated to an up-to-date exposition of Mereology. The\nother series, ‘Grundzüge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen\nder Mathematik’ [‘Fundamentals of a New System of the\nFoundations of Mathematics’] began to appear in 1929 in the\nmathematical journal Fundamenta Mathematicae, and was\ndedicated to Protothetic. Its 81 pages and 11 sections ended with the\npromise ‘Fortsetzung folgt’, ‘Continuation\nfollows’, but it did not, because in the meantime Leśniewski\nhad fallen out with the other editors of the journal over the status of\nset theory. The article did not get beyond the preliminaries of\nProtothetic, setting out the history, axioms, and rules (directives)\nfor extending the system, and outlining a number of variants, but not\nstarting the deductions proper. It was not until a new logic journal\nCollectanea Logica was set up in 1938 that Leśniewski was\nable to continue. After a 60-page introduction to the continuation,\n‘Einleitende Bemerkungen zur Fortsetzung meiner Mitteilung u.d.T.\n“Grundzüge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen der\nMathematik” ’, summarizing the earlier article and bringing\nthe story up to date, there followed another 83 pages comprising\nSection 12, and listing twelve definitions and 422 theorems of\nProtothetic, with skeletal information about how they are derived,\nexpressed in Leśniewski’s own idiosyncratic notation for the\nconnectives and quantifiers. The journal did not appear in print\nbecause of the outbreak of the Second World War: the printing plates\nfrom which offprints had fortunately been made were destroyed in the\nbombing of Warsaw in September 1939, by which time Leśniewski was\nalready dead. \n Leśniewski’s own notation for Protothetic is explained in\n‘Supplementary Remark III’ of the Introductory Remarks:\none-place connectives are made up of a horizontal bar\n‘–’ supplementable at either end by a vertical bar\n‘|’. A bar at the right-hand end of the line signifies the\nconnective gives output value T(rue) for input value T, the absence of\na bar signifies the output value for input T is F(alse).  Similarly a\nbar at the left-hand end of the line signifies output value T for\ninput value F, the absence of a bar signifies output F for input\nF. The four extensional one-place connectives are thus systematically\nnotated, with negation, the most important, written as\n‘\\(\\vdash\\)’. For two-place connectives bars are added\nradially as spokes to a circular central hub\n‘\\(\\circ\\)’. As before the presence of a bar indicates an\noutput value T, its absence an output value F. The top position is for\nfirst and second inputs F, the bottom position for first and second\ninputs T, the left position for first input T and second input F, the\nright position for first input F and second input T. Thus all sixteen\npossibilities are catered for. For example the conjunction connective\nis written ‘\\(\\koppa\\)’. If one connective H is contained\ngeometrically in another G, the implication G\\((pq) \\rightarrow\\)\nH\\((pq)\\) holds, and merging two connectives gives a connective\nequivalent to their conjunction. While this notation is systematic and\nelegant, it has never caught on. Like Łukasiewicz,\nLeśniewski always puts the connective before its arguments, but\nhe encloses the arguments in parentheses, thus the conjunction of\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is written ‘\\(\\koppa(pq)\\)’. The reason\nfor parentheses, which Łukasiewicz could dispense with, will\nbecome clear. In this “official” notation, the only\nquantifier is the universal, written by placing the variables bound\nbetween lower corners, as for example ‘ \\(\\llcorner\npqf\\lrcorner\\) ’, and placing the quantifier scope or matrix\nwithin upper corners, so for example ‘\\(\\llcorner pqf\\lrcorner\n\\ulcorner \\koppa(f(pq)f(qp))\\urcorner\\)’ is\nLeśniewski’s way of writing what we write as\n‘\\(\\forall pqf\\ulcorner f(pq) \\wedge f(qp)\\urcorner\\)’. In\nhis everyday logical work and derivations however, Leśniewski\nused a slightly modified version of Whitehead and\nRussell’s Principia Mathematica notation. \n Among the variant versions of Protothetic Leśniewski mentions in\nhis 1929 article, one is a single-axiom version containing 82 signs.\n(In 1945 Sobociński produced a single axiom version with 54 signs\nonly.) The other and more interesting idea is an algorithmic or\n“computative” system of Protothetic, mentioned above in\nSection 8. This is in effect a way to formalize the idea of\ntruth-tables, but applied beyond truth-functions of sentences to more\ncomplex functors with arguments of first and higher order\ntruth-functions. Leśniewski does not take the idea very far, but\nit was subsequently developed further by Owen Le Blanc (1991). \n To modern students of logic accustomed to streamlined methods of\nworking with propositional logic, Leśniewski’s Protothetic,\nespecially in its “official” versions, must appear very\ncumbersome and difficult to understand and work with. In part this is a\nquestion of the age of the systems and Leśniewski’s aversion\nto semantics (see above). However, Leśniewski did not\nalways present his work so fiercely. For purposes of everyday\nderivation he employed what can only be described as a system of\nnatural deduction, making assumptions, following their consequences,\ncollecting them and inferring conditionals and biconditionals, in the\nmanner to which all students of logic have since become accustomed.\nAstonishingly, neither he nor any of his students thought fit to codify\nthese practices into a system of rules. This was done instead at\nŁukasiewicz’s suggestion by Stanisław Jaśkowski.\nThe discovery of natural deduction is generally attributed to others,\nbut there is a chance that Leśniewski used it, in a recognizably\nmodern form, earlier than others. That he did not codify it probably\nresulted from his viewing it as a pedagogical device and a way of\nsketching out how a “proper” (i.e. axiomatic) proof was to\ngo. Another way to take some of the forbidding appearance out of\nProtothetic is to look for more readily comprehensible axioms. The\nfollowing two-axiom set based on implication as the primitive (an\nalternative Leśniewski also looked at) is rather straightforward;\nthe result was again obtained by Tarski: \n \nThe first is the universal closure of a standard axiom of\npropositional calculus going back to Frege. Recalling that F(alse) can\nbe defined as \\(\\forall s\\ulcorner s\\urcorner\\) and negation as\n\\(p \\rightarrow\\) F, the second is the universal closure of \n \nwhich simply says that if \\(f (r\\) any truth-value) then\n\\(f(rq)\\) for arbitrary \\(q\\), and that it\nobviously correct. It can be (tediously) checked that the result is\nvalid for all sixteen extensional binary truth-functions substitutable\nfor ‘\\(f\\) ’. Dragging the whole of Protothetic out\nof these simple beginnings is obviously much harder, and depends on\ncoming up with suitable definitions for the connectives. \n In Ontology, Leśniewski and his students, particularly\nSobociński, worked on replacing the 1920 “long”\nsingle axiom by a shorter one, eventually arriving at the\nunshortenable \n \nThis axiom gives a much less obvious insight into the intended\nmeaning of ‘\\(\\isa\\)’ than the original 1920 axiom. For a\ndelicately balanced combination of brevity with clarity the following\nequivalent two-axiom set is perspicuous: \n \nwhere notably the first axiom is precisely the one that\nLeśniewski mentioned to Twardowski in 1919. \n Although Ontology is perhaps the most generally interesting of\nLeśniewski’s systems, it was known during his lifetime less\nthrough his own published work, which was confined to a short,\ntechnical and inaccessible memoir, but through a gentle and\nsympathetic exposition in Kotarbiński’s 1929 widely read and\ninfluential Warsaw textbook known simply as the\nElementy. Kotarbiński explains how he had no need to\ncome up with a logical system of names and predicates, since he could\nget one ready-made from a firm with an excellent\nreputation. Leśniewski was duly grateful for the plug. \n The fact that the basic sentence-module in Ontology is singular\ninclusion of the form ‘\\(A \\isa b\\)’\nhas misled some commentators into thinking that Leśniewski turned\nhis back on the Fregean notion of predication as functional\napplication and instead reverted to a medieval “two-name”\naccount of predication. Indeed, except for the matter of tense,\nLeśniewski’s account of the truth-conditions of such singular\nsentences—that they are true if and only if the subject term\ndenotes a single object and the predicate term denotes one or more\nobjects of which this is one—is almost exactly the same as that\ngiven by the medieval nominalist William of Ockham. However, whether\nor not Ockham was a two-name theorist, Leśniewski definitely was\nnot. The general form of the singular sentence is the same as that of\nany binary predication, \\(f(ab)\\), or in\nLeśniewski’s notation, \\(f\\{ab\\}\\). Singular\ninclusion is no syncategorematic copula: it is a special binary\npredicate. That it is chosen as the primitive is understandable but\nnot compulsory. Leśniewski knew that other predicates than\n‘\\(\\isa\\)’ could be taken as primitive, a fact emphasized\nlater by Lejewski. \n It was in Mereology, Leśniewski’s oldest system, that there were\nthe most varied developments. The 1927–30 article series on\nMereology as part of the foundations of mathematics rang the changes\nin possible primitives. After scathing attacks on Whitehead’s and\nRussell’s use/mention confusions in Principia, and on\nstandard set theories, he retraces the formal development of his 1916\npaper, noting in a long footnote the similarities with Whitehead’s\ntheory of events, whose formal development he also criticises. He\nthen summarizes the development up to 1920, continuing with additional\nresults unpublished in 1916, taking the number of theorems up to\n198. Further chapters tidy up the axiomatization in terms of\n‘part’, and show that ‘ingredient’ can be\ntaken as primitive. The theorems are taken up to 264, then\n‘exterior’ is shown to be a possible primitive. There the\ndevelopment is arrested, and a final section discusses singular\npropositions of the form ‘\\(A \\isa b\\)’, with a note on how to understand propositions about\na thing which changes. Using the example ‘Warsaw of 1830 is\nsmaller than Warsaw of 1930’, Leśniewski proposes to\nconsider ‘Warsaw in 1830’ and ‘Warsaw in 1930’\nas denoting time-slices of the temporally much longer object he calls\n‘Warsaw from the beginning to the end of its\nexistence’. In this way he claims to bring many uses of\n‘is’ in ordinary language within the scope of an analysis\nusing his Ontology. This four-dimensional understanding of ordinary\nobjects is now commonplace, but at that time it was something of a\nrarity. The discussion is one of the few places in Leśniewski’s\nmature work where he indulges in anything similar to the philosophical\nlogic of his early years. Otherwise, when not discussing formal\nsystems and proving theorems, his prose discussions tend to be\nintemperate though frequently justified criticisms of the statements\nof others, most especially the proponents of standard set theory. \n \nNormally the character of an academic is of marginal relevance to his\nor her work. In the case of Leśniewski there is reason to think\notherwise. The extreme rigor that he applied in logic, the\nunflinchingly high standards he set himself and others, his blank\nincomprehension of intellectual, formal and linguistic inexactness,\nand his willingness to let academic disagreement sour his\nrelationships with colleagues, all speak of an unusual rigidity. This\nseems to have been deeply anchored: of his school days we know little\nother than that he was intolerant of exceptions to any rule, whether\nor not the rule was sensible. After one of his early Polish essays was\ntypeset with a spelling mistake in the title\n(‘środku’ instead of ‘środka’), he\nalways quoted the incorrect title, because to correct it would have\nbeen to break the rule that quotation must be literal and exact. In\nhis early years he nursed the project of translating Anton Marty’s\nrambling and polemical 1908 treatise Untersuchungen zur\nGrundlegung der allgemeinen Grammatik und Sprachphilosophie\n[Investigations on the Founding of General Grammar and Philosophy\nof Language]. He never got beyond the second word of the title,\n‘zur’, which is admittedly not easily captured in all its\nnuances—it can mean ‘toward’ as well as\n‘on’ or ‘about’. Having carried a copy of the\nbook around for some time and asked all his friends and colleagues how\nthey would translate ‘zur’, he gave up. No doubt his\ninterests shifted, but the incident demonstrates both his\npunctiliousness and his inflexibility. \nBiographical material about Leśniewski is fairly sparse, and it\nis even harder to gain a clear idea of what he was like as a person. Jadacki (2016) contains much new information about Leśniewski, his family, and his relationships with colleagues and contemporaries, but even here the man behind the words and (invariably unsmiling) photographs is not easily discernible.\nA photograph of him in Twardowski’s seminar in 1913 shows a short,\ndapper man with a goatee and a flamboyant neckscarf, as described by\nŁukasiewicz. In later photographs from the same period he lacks the\ngoatee but retains a moustache. Two well-known later photos show a\nstiffly-posed, stocky, clean-shaven man in a business suit with the\nslicked-back hair of the period, looking more like a bank manager than\na professor of logic, except for an intense stare. Leśniewski was\nknown to be a fierce critic of what he considered unclear, which was\npretty well everything. His stock complaint was that he could not\nunderstand what speakers were saying, or writers were writing. In the\nlight of his pathological inability to see beyond the literal meaning\non the page to any intended but inaccurately expressed meaning this is\nunsurprising, but also unendearing. In the early 1920s Marjan\nBorowski, the editor of\nPrzegląd Filozoficzny, complained to Twardowski that\npeople were afraid to submit papers or give talks in Warsaw because\nthey were fearful of being criticised by Leśniewski, though he\nadded with some glee that the scourge of God had risen up against him\nin the shape of one Tajtelbaum – the young Tarski. Even the\nphlegmatic Twardowski found his former student irritating: in a diary\nentry for 12 August 1930 he complains, “In general those who\nbehave according to Lesniewski’s model ask very arbitrarily for\nanalysis where it is convenient to them—if, however, one of them\nasks for analysis where it is not convenient to him, they turn to\nintuition. And if the opposer in the discussion sometimes tries to\nturn to intuition, they reply ‘We don’t understand what\nyou consider to be intuitively given’.” Twardowski’s 1921\npaper ‘Symbolomania and Pragmatophobia’ is a plea for\nphilosophers not to put symbols above things, and while its ostensible target is the French physicist Henri Bouasse, it is clearly implicitly directed\nagainst Łukasiewicz and Leśniewski and their students. \n Leśniewski was however not lacking in a certain heavy humor.\nLejewski reported that he once mocked a Warsaw Professor of Classics\nfor wearing sunglasses (then rather rare): “Is the world too dazzling for\nhim?” He was equably resigned to his lectures being sparsely\nattended because of their extreme technicality. One semester,\nunexpectedly many students turned up at the first lecture. He looked\naround the room in surprise and asked “What are you all doing\nhere? I am not Bergson.” For those who were just there for the\nsake of doing a course and clocking up their attendance he quietly\nsigned off their lecture books straight away, and told them not to\nworry about coming again. The few die-hards came for the sake of the\nlogic. Leśniewski would enter the lecture room with a briefcase\nstuffed with papers, root around, find where he had got to and\ncarry on, writing formulas and explaining how they were derived. When\nQuine visited some of these lectures, he was able to follow them\ndespite knowing no Polish.  Leśniewski married in 1913: his wife Zofia Prewysz-Kwinto\ncame of a landed family from Kimborciszki (Kimbartiškė) in rural\nLithuania. They had no children. Before World War I Leśniewski\nseems to have had the means to travel around to different German\ncities to study, and to spend time after his doctorate in Paris, San\nRemo and St. Petersburg. \n Leśniewski inspired devotion in a very small coterie of students,\na few of whom stayed fiercely loyal, but sooner or later he ended up\nalienating nearly everyone, either through his robust professional\nopinions, or his manner, or his political views. He started out as a\nradical socialist—his decision to spend the war in Russia was\npartly personal and partly political—but after the excesses of\nthe October Revolution and its aftermath he rejected socialism. From\nthe 1920s he supported the authoritarianism of Józef\nPiłsudski, but from about 1930 his views took on a darker\nanti-Semitic tinge. An unsavory letter written to Twardowski in 1935\ncomplains of “filthy tricks” being played on him “by\ncertain Jew-boys or their foreign friends”, declares a personal\nantipathy to Tarski, whose career he would not obstruct, but admits he\n“would be extraordinarily pleased if some day I were to read in\nthe newspapers that he was being offered a full professorship, for\nexample in Jerusalem, from where he could send us offprints of his\nvaluable works to our great profit.” Tarski had been passed over\nfor the chair in Lwów, which went to Chwistek on the strength of\npraise from Russell, even though the Varsovians, including\nLeśniewski, had supported Tarski. Tarski certainly felt aggrieved\nand no doubt suspected anti-Semitic motives, but like Leśniewski\nhe was prickly and sensitive about matters of priority. It is in\nretrospect mildly grotesque to see how carefully Leśniewski and\nTarski dance around each other in their prefaces and acknowledgements,\nneither wishing to give public offence to the other. Despite their\ndisagreements and suspicions however, they long continued to meet once a week,\nwith no one else present, to discuss logic. \n Leśniewski’s antipathy towards set theory was so vehement and\nhis criticisms so intemperate that it led to a break in relations with\nhis set-theoretically minded mathematical colleagues Sierpiński\nand Kuratowski; he resigned from the editorial board of Fundamenta\nMathematicae, with the result that he was no longer able to\npublish his own work there. By the end of his life, Leśniewski’s\nonly surviving close friend was the saintly patient and faithful\nKotarbiński, who alone of his colleagues visited him in hospital\nin his last illness. They had been born just days apart in\n1886. The cancer that killed Leśniewski was no doubt exacerbated\nby smoking: cigars and a large pipe. During the operation he was\nconscious and without anaesthetic because of the dangers and he was\nallowed to smoke even then to distract himself from the pain. But he\ndid not recover, and died sitting in his favourite armchair, brought\nspecially into the hospital. \n \nOf the students that Leśniewski had taught at Warsaw, some went\non to logical and philosophical careers of their own, most notably\nTarski, whom Leśniewski correctly recognized as a genius, and who\nwent on to outshine his teacher. Among those who stayed fairly close\nto Leśniewski’s own views were Jerzy Słupecki, Bolesław\nSobociński, Czesław Lejewski, and Henry Hiż. The first\nthree in particular contributed after World War II to the\nreconstruction of many of the logical results that had been lost in\n1944. Serendipitously recovered students’ notes from\nLeśniewski’s lectures, translated and published in 1988, give\nsome idea of the detail of Leśniewski’s teaching, but his\nlectures ranged more widely than the extant works show. At all times\nhowever, Leśniewski’s logical position was a minority one, which\nwas respected while being rejected, and it won few converts after his\ndeath. The reasons for his sidelining have been analysed by\nGrzegorczyk (1955). Leśniewski’s work was developed in the 1920s\nwhen an axiomatic approach was standard, as in Hilbert’s school, but\nhis negative attitude to semantics as a separable part of logic meant\nhe was unsympathetic to the shift towards a semantic approach\ninitiated by Tarski, and he would have remained opposed even had he\nlived longer. His vituperative rejection of set theory made him no\nfriends and many enemies among mathematicians, while his unwillingness\nand inability to find anything worthwhile in the works of philosophers\nlost him their sympathy. His obsessive concern for the minute detail\nof axiomatizations was unattractive to many when more streamlined\nmethods were available, and his radical nominalism made the\npresentation of logic according to his principles a matter of extreme\ninconvenience. Even Tarski, who was initially very much a follower,\nhad to admit that Leśniewski’s conception of logical systems as\nconcrete collections of inscriptions growing in time through the\naddition of new theses made them “thoroughly unrewarding objects\nfor methodological and semantic research”. \n In retrospect we can see Leśniewski’s obsession with the\nfine detail of axiomatics and his rejection of semantics as conditioned\nby his own idiosyncratic development and the predominant research\ninterests of the 1910s and 1920s. It is in fact possible to apply more\nstandard metalogical considerations to his systems, such as\ninvestigating them for consistency and completeness. However, the\ndifficulties and complications of working within the confines of a\nfully nominalistic attitude—sans sets, sans\nabstract expression types—have put off all but a very few, and\nthe relative ease with which results can be obtained when fewer\nontological scruples are in play makes Leśniewski’s systems\nand others like them interesting mainly to certain philosophers, while\nmathematicians and mathematical logicians have by-passed them. \n On the other hand, Leśniewski’s concerns for the proprieties\nof quotation and use/mention, the object-language/metalanguage\ndistinction, canons of correct definition, and his development of\nMereology as the dominant formal theory of part and whole have all\npassed into the mainstream, and the logical expertise he helped to\ninstil into a generation of Poles contributed in large part to making\nWarsaw the premier interbellum location for mathematical logic. In the\nentrance to the 1999 University of Warsaw Library building stand four\nconcrete pillars and sculptures by Adam Myjak, celebrating the\nphilosophical achievements of Poland. The figures represented are\nLeśniewski’s teacher Twardowski, his colleague\nŁukasiewicz, his student Tarski, and Leśniewski himself.","contact.mail":"psimons@tcd.ie","contact.domain":"tcd.ie"}]
