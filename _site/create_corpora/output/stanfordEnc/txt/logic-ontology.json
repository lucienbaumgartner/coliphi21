Both logic and ontology are diverse fields\nwithin philosophy and, partly because of this, there is not one single\nphilosophical problem about the relation between them. In this survey\narticle we will first discuss what different philosophical projects\nare carried out under the headings of “logic” and\n“ontology” and then we will look at several areas where\nlogic and ontology overlap.\n\n\nBoth logic and ontology are important areas of philosophy covering\nlarge, diverse, and active research projects. These two areas overlap\nfrom time to time and problems or questions arise that concern both.\nThis survey article is intended to discuss some of these areas of\noverlap. In particular, there is no single philosophical problem of\nthe intersection of logic and ontology. This is partly so because the\nphilosophical disciplines of logic and of ontology are themselves\nquite diverse and there is thus the possibility of many points of\nintersection. In the following we will first distinguish different\nphilosophical projects that are covered under the terms\n‘logic’ and ‘ontology’. We will then discuss a\nselection of problems that arise in the different areas of\ncontact. \n‘Logic’ and ‘ontology’ are big words in\nphilosophy, and different philosophers have used them in different\nways. Depending on what these philosophers mean by these words, and,\nof course, depending on the philosopher’s views, sometimes there are\nstriking claims to be found in the philosophical literature about\ntheir relationship. But when Hegel, for example, uses\n‘logic’, or better ‘Logik’, he means something\nquite different than what is meant by the word in much of the\ncontemporary philosophical scene. We will not be able to survey the\nhistory of the different conceptions of logic, or of ontology. Instead\nwe will look at areas of overlap that are presently actively debated.\n \nThere are several quite different topics put under the heading of\n‘logic’ in contemporary philosophy, and it is\ncontroversial how they relate to each other. \nOn the one hand, logic is the study of certain mathematical properties\nof artificial, formal languages. It is concerned with such languages\nas the first or second order predicate calculus, modal logics, the\nlambda calculus, categorial grammars, and so forth. The mathematical\nproperties of these languages are studied in such subdisciplines of\nlogic as proof theory or model theory. Much of the work done in this\narea these days is mathematically difficult, and it might not be\nimmediately obvious why this is considered a part of philosophy.\nHowever, logic in this sense arose from within philosophy and the\nfoundations of mathematics, and it is often seen as being of\nphilosophical relevance, in particular in the philosophy of\nmathematics, and in its application to natural languages. \nA second discipline, also called ‘logic’, deals with\ncertain valid inferences and good reasoning based on them. It does\nnot, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the\ntheory of rationality. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity\ncan be traced back to the formal features of the representations that\nare involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other\nrepresentations. Some patterns of inference can be seen as valid by\nmerely looking at the form of the representations that are involved in\nthis inference. Such a conception of logic thus distinguishes validity\nfrom formal validity. An inference is valid just in case the\ntruth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, or\nalternatively if the premises are true then the conclusion has to be\ntrue as well, or again alternatively, if it can’t be that the premises\nare true but the conclusion is false. Validity so understood is simply\na modal notion, a notion about what has to be the case. Others might\nthink of validity as involving a more fine grained hyperintensional\nnotion, but in any case, validity so understood is not what logic is\nconcerned with. Logic is concerned with formal validity,\nwhich can be understood as follows. In a system of representations,\nfor example a language, it can be that some inferences are always\nvalid as long as the representational or semantic features of certain\nparts of the representations are kept fixed, even if we abstract from\nor ignore the representational features of the other parts of the\nrepresentations. So, for example, as long as we stick to English, and\nwe keep the meanings of certain words like “some” and\n“all” fixed, certain patterns of inference, like some of\nAristotle’s syllogisms, are valid no matter what the meaning of the\nother words in the\n syllogism.[1]\n To call an inference formally valid is to assume that certain words\nhave their meaning fixed, that we are within a fixed set of\nrepresentations, and that we can ignore the meaning of the other\nwords. The words that are kept fixed are the logical vocabulary, or\nlogical constants, the others are the non-logical vocabulary. And when\nan inference is formally valid then the conclusion logically follows\nfrom the premises. This could be generalized for representations that\nare not linguistic, like graphic representations, though it would\nrequire a bit more work to do so. Logic is the study of such\ninferences, and certain related concepts and topics, like formal\ninvalidity, proof, consistency, and so on. The central notion of logic\nin this sense is the notion of logical consequence. How this notion\nshould be understood more precisely is presently widely debated, and a\nsurvey of these debates can be found in the entry on\n logical consequence. \nA third conception of logic takes logic to be the study of special\ntruths, or facts: the logical truths, or facts. In this sense logic\ncould be understood as a science that aims to describe certain truths\nor facts, just as other sciences aim to describe other truths. The\nlogical truths could be understood as the most general truths, ones\nthat are contained in any other body of truths that any other science\naims to describe. In this sense logic is different from biology, since\nit is more general, but it is also similar to biology in that it is a\nscience that aims to capture a certain body of truths. This way of\nlooking at logic is often associated with Frege. \nThis conception of logic can, however, be closely associated with the\none that takes logic to be fundamentally about certain kinds of\ninferences and about logical consequence. A logical truth, on such an\nunderstanding, is simply one that is expressed by a representation\nwhich logically follows from no assumptions, i.e. which logically\nfollows from an empty set of premises. Alternatively, a logical truth\nis one whose truth is guaranteed as long as the meaning of the logical\nconstants is fixed, no matter what the meanings of the other parts in\na representation are. \nAnd there are other notions of ‘logic’ as well. One of\nthem is historically prominent, but not very widely represented in the\ncontemporary debate. We will briefly discuss it here nonetheless.\nAccording to this conception of logic, it is the study of the most\ngeneral features of thoughts or judgments, or the form of thoughts or\njudgments. Logic thus understood will for example be concerned with\nthe occurrence of subject and predicate structure that many judgments\nexhibit, and with other such general features of judgments. It will\nmostly be concerned with thoughts, and not directly with linguistic\nrepresentations, though, of course, a proponent of this conception can\nclaim that there is a very close connection between them. To talk\nabout the form of a judgment will involve a subtly different notion of\n‘form’ than to talk about the form of a linguistic\nrepresentation. The form of a linguistic representation, basically,\nwas what was left once we abstract from or ignore the representational\nfeatures of everything except what we keep fixed, the logical\nconstants. The form of a thought, on the other hand, is often\nunderstood as what is left over once we abstract from its content,\nthat is, what it is about. We will briefly pursue the question below\nhow these notions of form are related to each other. This conception\nof logic is associated with Kant. Kant distinguished different notions\nof logic (for example transcendental logic, general logic, etc.), but\nwe won’t be able to discuss these here. See the entry on\n Immanuel Kant\n for more. \nOne important philosophical aspect of logic, at least in the senses\nthat deal with logical consequence and the forms of judgements, is its\nnormativity. Logic seems to give us a guide how we ought to reason,\nand how we ought to draw inferences from one representation to\nanother. But it is not at all clear what guide it gives us, and how we\nshould understand more precisely what norms logic puts on our\nreasoning. For example, logic does not put us under the norm “If\nyou believe \\(A\\) and you believe if \\(A\\) then \\(B\\)\nthen you ought to believe \\(B\\).” After all, it might be\nthat I should not believe \\(A\\) and if \\(A\\) then \\(B\\)\nin the first place. So, in particular I shouldn’t believe \\(B\\).\nA reductio ad absurdum is a form of argument that illustrates this. If\nI believe A and if A then \\(0=1\\), then this should lead me to abandon my\nbelief in A, not lead to a belief that \\(0=1\\). The consequences of my\nbeliefs can lead me to abandon them. Still, if I have some reasons for\nmy beliefs then I have at least some prima facie, but not necessarily\nconclusive, reason to hold the consequences of those beliefs. Logic\nmight thus tell us at least this much, though: whenever I have some\nreason to believe \\(A\\) and if \\(A\\) then \\(B\\), then I\nhave a prima facie reason to believe \\(B\\). See (Harman 1986) for\nthe view that logic has no distinctive normative role, and (Field\n2009) for a nice critical discussion of Harman’s view and an argument\nwhy logic should be tied to norms of rationality. \nAnd, of course, logic does not tell us how we ought to reason or infer\nin all particular cases. Logic does not deal with the particular\ncases, but only with the most generally valid forms of reasoning or\ninference, ones that are valid no matter what one reasons about. In\nthis sense logic is often seen to be topic neutral. It applies no\nmatter what one is thinking or reasoning about. And this neutrality,\nor complete generality of logic, together with its normativity, is\noften put as “logic is about how we ought to think if we are to\nthink at all” or “logic is the science of the laws that we\nought to follow in our thinking no matter what we think about”.\nThere are well known philosophical puzzles about normativity, and\nthese apply to logic as well if it is normative. One is why it is that\nthinkers are under such norms. After all, why shouldn’t I think the\nway I prefer to think, without there being some norm that governs my\nthinking, whether I like it or not? Why is there an\n“ought” that comes with thinking as such, even if I don’t\nwant to think that way? One idea to answer this is to employ the\nnotion of a ‘constitutive aim of belief’, the idea that\nbelief as such aims at something: the truth. If so then maybe one\ncould argue that by having beliefs I am under the norm that I ought to\nhave true ones. And if one holds that one of the crucial features of\nlogically valid inferences is that they preserve truth then one could\nargue that the logical laws are norms that apply to those who have\nbeliefs. See (Velleman 2000) for more on the aim of belief. The\nnormativity of logic will not be central for our discussion to follow,\nbut the topic neutrality and generality will\n be.[2] \nOverall, we can thus distinguish four notions of logic: \nThere is, of course, a question how these different conceptions of\nlogic relate to each other. The details of their relationship invite\nmany hard questions, but we should briefly look at this\nnonetheless. \nHow (L1) and (L2) relate to each other is subject of controversy. One\nstraightforward, though controversial view, is the following. For any\ngiven system of representations, like sentences in a natural language,\nthere is one and only one set of logical constants. Thus there will be\none formal language that best models what logically valid inferences\nthere are among these natural representations. This formal language\nwill have a logical vocabulary that captures the inferential\nproperties of the logical constants, and that models all other\nrelevant features of the natural system of representation with\nnon-logical vocabulary. One especially important system of\nrepresentations is our natural language. Thus (L1) is the study of\nformal languages of which one is distinguished, and this one\ndistinguished language nicely represents the fixed and non-fixed\nfeatures of our natural language, through its logical and non-logical\nvocabulary. And validity in that formal language, a technical notion\ndefined in the appropriate way for that formal language, nicely models\nlogical validity or logical consequence in our natural language system\nof representations. Or so this view of the relationship between (L1)\nand (L2) holds. \nThis view of the relationship between (L1) and (L2), however, assumes\nthat there is one and only one set of logical constants for each\nsystem of representations. A contrary view holds that which\nexpressions are treated as logical constants is a matter of choice,\nwith different choices serving different purposes. If we fix, say,\n‘believes’ and ‘knows’ then we can see that\n‘\\(x\\) believes that \\(p\\)’ is implied by\n‘\\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\)’ (given widely held\nviews about knowledge and belief). This does not mean that\n‘believes’ is a logical constant in an absolute sense.\nGiven other interests, other expressions can be treated as logical.\nAccording to this conception, different formal languages will be\nuseful in modeling the inferences that are formally valid given\ndifferent set of ‘logical constants’ or expressions whose\nmeaning is kept fixed. \nThis debate thus concerns whether there is one and only one set of\nlogical constants for a system of representations, and if so, which\nones are the logical ones. We will not get into this debate here, but\nthere is quite a large literature on what logical constants are, and\nhow logic can be demarcated. For a general discussion and further\nreferences, see for example (Engel 1991). Some of the classic papers\nin this debate include (Hacking 1979), who defends a proof-theoretic\nway of distinguishing logical constants from other expressions. The\nleading idea here is that logical constants are those whose meaning\ncan be given by proof-theoretic introduction and elimination rules. On\nthe other hand, (Mauthner 1946), (van Benthem 1986), (van Benthem\n1989), and (Tarski 1986) defend semantic ways to mark that difference.\nThe leading idea here is that logical notions are ‘permutation\ninvariant’. Since logic is supposed to be completely general and\nneutral with respect to what the representations are about, it should\nnot matter to logic if we switch around the objects that these\nrepresentations are about. So, logical notions are those that are\ninvariant under permutations of the domain. (van Benthem 1989) gives a\ngeneral formulation to this idea. See the entry on\n logical constants\n for more. \nThe relationship between (L2) and (L3) was briefly addressed above.\nThey seem to be closely related because a logical truth can be\nunderstood as one that follows from an empty set of premises, and A\nbeing a logical consequence of B can be understood as it being a\nlogical truth that if A then B. There are some questions to be ironed\nout about how this is supposed to go more precisely. How should we\nunderstand cases of logical consequence from infinitely many premises?\nAre logical truths all finitely statable? But for our purposes we can\nsay that they are rather closely related. \nThe relationship between (L2) and (L4) on the other hand raises some\nquestions. For one, of course, there is an issue about what it means\nto say that judgments have a form, and whether they do in the relevant\nsense. But one way in which this question could be understood directly\nties it to (L2). If thoughts, and thus judgments, are realized by\nminds having a certain relation to mental representations, and if\nthese representations are themselves structured like a language, with\na “syntax” and a “semantics” (properly\nunderstood), then the form of a judgment could be understood just like\nthe form of a sentence. Such a view of thoughts is commonly called the\nLanguage of Thought hypothesis, see (Fodor, 1975), and if it is\ncorrect then in the language of thought there might be logical and\nnon-logical vocabulary. The form of a judgment could be understood\nalong the lines we understood the form of a linguistic representation\nwhen we talked about formally valid inferences. Thus the relationship\nbetween (L2) and (L4) is rather direct. On both conceptions of logic\nwe deal with logical constants, the difference is that one deals with\na system of mental representations, the other with a system of\nlinguistic representations. Both, presumably, would deal with\ncorresponding sets of logical constants. Even though mental and\nlinguistic representations form different sets of representations,\nsince they are closely connected with each other, for every logical\nconstant in one of these sets of representations there will be another\none of the corresponding syntactic type and with the same content, or\nat least a corresponding inferential role.\n \nBut this conception of their relationship assumes that the\n“general features of judgments” or “forms of\njudgment” which (L4) is concerned with deal with something like\nthe logical constants in the language of thought. Here the judgment as\na mental act is assumed to operate on a mental representation that\nitself has syntactic structure. And the form of the judgment was\nunderstood as the form of the representation that represents the\ncontent of the judgment, whereby the form of the representation was\nunderstood along the lines of (L2), involving logical constants. But\nwhat if we can’t understand “form of judgment” or\n“form of thought” that way? One way this could fail is if\nthe language of thought hypothesis itself fails, and if mental states\ndo not involve representations that have something like a syntactic\nform. The question then becomes, first how should we understand\n‘form of judgement’ more precisely, and secondly, how does\nlogic, as the discipline concerned with forms of judgments in the\nsense of (L4), relate to (L2)? \nOne way to answer the first question is to understand “form of\njudgment” as not being concerned with the representation that\nmight be involved in a judgment, but rather with the content of the\njudgment, i.e. with what the judgment is representing to be the case.\nContents of judgments can be seen as propositions, and these can be\nunderstood as entities that are structured, for example Russellian\npropositions. Such propositions are ordered sets whose members are\nobjects and properties. How such a conception of (L4) relates to (L2)\nwill in part depend on how one thinks of the logical constants in\nRussellian propositions. If they are higher order properties or\nfunctions that are members of these propositions alongside other\nobjects and properties then presumably the logical constants have\ncontent. But this seems to be in conflict with an understanding of\n(L4) as being concerned with the form that is left once we abstract\nfrom all content. If would seem that on such an understanding of (L4)\none can’t closely associate ‘form of judgment’, understood\nas what’s left once we abstract from all content of the judgment, with\nlogical constants if the latter have content. \nAnother way to understand “form” as being concerned with\nwhat the judgment is about, rather than the judgment itself, is to\nthink of what it is about, the world, itself as having a form. In this\nsense we associate “form” neither with the representation\nthat is involved in the judgment, nor with the proposition which is\nits content, but rather with the world that is judged about. On such a\nconception the world itself has a form or basic structure. (L4) would\nbe concerned with this structure. How (L4) relates to (L2) is then a\nsomewhat tricky question. One way, again, could be that the logical\nconstants that (L2) is concerned with correspond to the structure of\nwhat a representation in which they occur is about, but don’t\ncontribute to the content of that representation. This again seems\nincompatible with the logical constants themselves having content. So,\nwhether one associates form of judgment with the\n‘syntactic’ structure of a representation that is involved\nin the judgment, or with the content of that representation, or with\nthe structure of what the representation is about, the relationship\nbetween (L4) and (L2) will in part depend on whether one thinks the\nlogical constants themselves contribute to content. If they do, and if\nform is contrasted with content, then a close association seems\nimpossible. If the logical constants don’t have content, then it might\nbe possible. \nFinally, the relationship between (L1) and (L4) either comes down to\nthe same as that between (L1) and (L2), if we understand ‘form\nof thought’ analogous to ‘form of representation’.\nIf not, then it will again depend on how (L4) is understood more\nprecisely. \nThus there are many ways in which (L1), (L2), (L3), and (L4) are\nconnected, and many in which they are quite different. \nAs a first approximation, ontology is the study of what there is. Some\ncontest this formulation of what ontology is, so it’s only a first\napproximation. Many classical philosophical problems are problems in\nontology: the question whether or not there is a god, or the problem\nof the existence of universals, etc.. These are all problems in\nontology in the sense that they deal with whether or not a certain\nthing, or more broadly entity, exists. But ontology is usually also\ntaken to encompass problems about the most general features and\nrelations of the entities which do exist. There are also a number of\nclassic philosophical problems that are problems in ontology\nunderstood in this way. For example, the problem of how a universal\nrelates to a particular that has it (assuming there are universals and\nparticulars), or the problem of how an event like John eating a cookie\nrelates to the particulars John and the cookie, and the relation of\neating, assuming there are events, particulars and relations. These\nkinds of problems quickly turn into metaphysics more generally, which\nis the philosophical discipline that encompasses ontology as one of\nits parts. The borders here are a little fuzzy. But we have at least\ntwo parts to the overall philosophical project of ontology, on our\npreliminary understanding of it: first, say what there is, what\nexists, what the stuff of reality is made out of, secondly, say what\nthe most general features and relations of these things are. \nThis way of looking at ontology comes with two sets of problems which\nleads to the philosophical discipline of ontology being more complex\nthan just answering the above questions. The first set of problems is\nthat it isn’t clear how to approach answering these questions. This\nleads to the debate about ontological commitment. The second set of\nproblems is that it isn’t so clear what these questions really are.\nThis leads to the philosophical debate about meta-ontology. Lets look\nat them in turn. \nOne of the troubles with ontology is that it not only isn’t clear what\nthere is, it also isn’t so clear how to settle questions about what\nthere is, at least not for the kinds of things that have traditionally\nbeen of special interest to philosophers: numbers, properties, God,\netc. Ontology is thus a philosophical discipline that encompasses\nbesides the study of what there is and the study of the general\nfeatures of what there is also the study of what is involved in\nsettling questions about what there is in general, especially for the\nphilosophically tricky cases. How we can find out what there is isn’t\nan easy question to answer. It might seem simple enough for regular\nobjects that we can perceive with our eyes, like my house keys, but\nhow should we decide it for such things as, say, numbers or\nproperties? One first step to making progress on this question is to\nsee if what we believe already rationally settles this question. That\nis to say, given that we have certain beliefs, do these beliefs\nalready bring with them a rational commitment to an answer to such\nquestions as ‘Are there numbers?’ If our beliefs bring\nwith them a rational commitment to an answer to an ontological\nquestion about the existence of certain entities then we can say that\nwe are committed to the existence of these entities. What precisely is\nrequired for such a commitment to occur is subject to debate, a debate\nwe will look at momentarily. To find out what one is committed to with\na particular set of beliefs, or acceptance of a particular theory of\nthe world, is part of the larger discipline of ontology. \nBesides it not being so clear what it is to commit yourself to an\nanswer to an ontological question, it also isn’t so clear what an\nontological question really is, and thus what it is that ontology is\nsupposed to accomplish. To figure this out is the task of\nmeta-ontology, which strictly speaking is not part of ontology\nconstrued narrowly, but the study of what ontology is. However, like\nmost philosophical disciplines, ontology more broadly construed\ncontains its own meta-study, and thus meta-ontology is part of\nontology, more broadly construed. Nonetheless it is helpful to\nseparate it out as a special part of ontology. Many of the\nphilosophically most fundamental questions about ontology really are\nmeta-ontological questions. Meta-ontology has not been too popular in\nthe last couple of decades, partly because one meta-ontological view,\nthe one often associated with Quine, has been accepted as the correct\none, but this acceptance has been challenged in recent years in a\nvariety of ways. One motivation for the study of meta-ontology is\nsimply the question of what question ontology aims to answer. Take the\ncase of numbers, for example. What is the question that we should aim\nto answer in ontology if we want to find out if there are numbers,\nthat is, if reality contains numbers besides whatever else it is made\nup from? This way of putting it suggest an easy answer: ‘Are\nthere numbers?’ But this question seems like an easy one to\nanswer. An answer to it is implied, it seems, by trivial mathematics,\nsay that the number 7 is less than the number 8. If the latter, then\nthere is a number which is less than 8, namely 7, and thus there is at\nleast one number. Can ontology be that easy? The study of\nmeta-ontology will have to determine, amongst others, if ‘Are\nthere numbers?’ really is the question that the discipline of\nontology is supposed to answer, and more generally, what ontology is\nsupposed to do. We will pursue these questions below. As we will see,\nseveral philosophers think that ontology is supposed to answer a\ndifferent question than what there is, but they often disagree on what\nthat question is. \nThe larger discipline of ontology can thus be seen as having four\nparts: \nThe relationship between these four seems rather straightforward. (O4)\nwill have to say how the other three are supposed to be understood. In\nparticular, it will have to tell us if the question to be answered in\n(O2) indeed is the question what there is, which was taken above to be\nonly a first approximation for how to state what ontology is supposed\nto do. Maybe it is supposed to answer the question what is real\ninstead, or what is fundamental, some other question. Whatever one\nsays here will also affect how one should understand (O1). We will at\nfirst work with what is the most common way to understand (O2) and\n(O1), and discuss alternatives in turn. If (O1) has the result that\nthe beliefs we share commit us to a certain kind of entity then this\nrequires us either to accept an answer to a question about what there\nis in the sense of (O2) or to revise our beliefs. If we accept that\nthere is such an entity in (O2) then this invites questions in (O3)\nabout its nature and the general relations it has to other things we\nalso accept. On the other hand, investigations in (O3) into the nature\nof entities that we are not committed to and that we have no reason to\nbelieve exist would seem like a rather speculative project, though, of\ncourse, it could still be fun and interesting. \nThe debates about logic and ontology overlap at various places. Given\nthe division of ontology into (O1)–(O4), and the division of\nlogic into (L1)–(L4) we can look at several areas of overlap.\nIn the following we will discuss some paradigmatic debates on the\nrelationship between logic and ontology, divided up by areas of\noverlap. \nSuppose we have a set of beliefs, and we wonder what the answer to the\nontological question ‘Are there numbers?’ is, assuming\n(O4) tells us this is the ontological question about numbers. One\nstrategy to see whether our beliefs already commit us to an answer of\nthis question is as follows: first, write out all those beliefs in a\npublic language, like English. This by itself might not seem to help\nmuch, since if it wasn’t clear what my beliefs commit me to, why would\nit help to look at what acceptance of what these sentences say commits\nme to? But now, secondly, write these sentences in what is often\ncalled ‘canonical notation’. Canonical notation can be\nunderstood as a formal or semi-formal language that brings out the\ntrue underlying structure, or ‘logical form’ of a natural\nlanguage sentence. In particular, such a canonical notation will make\nexplicit which quantifiers do occur in these sentences, what their\nscope is, and the like. This is where formal languages come into the\npicture. After that, and thirdly, look at the variables that are bound\nby these\n quantifiers.[3]\n What values do they have to have in order for these sentences all to\nbe true? If the answer is that the variables have to have numbers as\ntheir values, then you are committed to numbers. If not then you\naren’t committed to numbers. The latter doesn’t mean that there are no\nnumbers, of course, just as you being committed to them doesn’t mean\nthat there are numbers. But if your beliefs are all true then there\nhave to be numbers, if you are committed to numbers. Or so this\nstrategy goes. \nAll this might seem a lot of extra work for little. What do we really\ngain from these ‘canonical notations’ in determining\nontological commitment? One attempt to answer this, which partly\nmotivates the above way of doing things, is based on the following\nconsideration: We might wonder why we should think that quantifiers\nare of great importance for making ontological commitments explicit.\nAfter all, if I accept the apparently trivial mathematical fact that\nthere is a number between 6 and 8, does this already commit me to an\nanswer to the ontological question whether there are numbers out\nthere, as part of reality? The above strategy tries to make explicit\nthat and why it in fact does commit me to such an answer. This is so\nsince natural language quantifiers are fully captured by their formal\nanalogues in canonical notation, and the latter make ontological\ncommitments obvious because of their semantics. Such formal\nquantifiers are given what is called an ‘objectual\nsemantics’. This is to say that a particular quantified\nstatement ‘\\(\\exists x\\,Fx\\)’ is true just in case there\nis an object in the domain of quantification that, when assigned as\nthe value of the variable ‘x’, satisfies the open formula\n‘\\(Fx\\)’. This makes obvious that the truth of a\nquantified statement is ontologically relevant, and in fact ideally\nsuited to make ontological commitment explicit, since we need entities\nto assign as the values of the variables. Thus (L1) is tied to (O1).\nThe philosopher most closely associated with this way of determining\nontological commitment, and with the meta-ontological view on which it\nis based, is Quine, in particular his (Quine 1948). See also van\n(Inwagen 1998) for a presentation sympathetic to Quine. \nThe above account of ontological commitment has been criticized from a\nvariety of different angles. One criticism focuses on the semantics\nthat is given for quantifiers in the formal language that is used as\nthe canonical notation of the natural language representations of the\ncontents of beliefs. The above, objectual semantics is not the only\none that can be given to quantifiers. One widely discussed alternative\nis the so-called ‘substitutional semantics’. According to\nit we do not assign entities as values of variables. Rather, a\nparticular quantified statement ‘\\(\\exists x\\,Fx\\)’ is\ntrue just in case there is a term in the language that when\nsubstituted for ‘\\(x\\)’ in \\(‘Fx\\rquo\\)\nhas a true sentence as its result. Thus,\n‘\\(\\exists x\\,Fx\\)’ is true just in case there is an\ninstance ‘\\(Ft\\)’ which is true, for\n‘\\(t\\)’ a term in the language in question,\nsubstituted for all (free) occurrences of ‘\\(x\\)’ in\n‘\\(Fx\\)’. The substitutional semantics for the\nquantifiers has often been used to argue that there are ontologically\ninnocent uses of quantifiers, and that what quantified statements we\naccept does not directly reveal ontological commitment. (Gottlieb\n1980) provides more details on substitutional quantification, and an\nattempt to use it in the philosophy of mathematics. Earlier work was\ndone by Ruth Marcus, and is reprinted in (Marcus 1993). \nAnother objection to the above account of determining ontological\ncommitment goes further and questions the use of a canonical notation,\nand of formal tools in general. It states that if the ontological\nquestion about numbers simply is the question ‘Are there\nnumbers?’ then all that matters for ontological commitment is\nwhether or not what we accept implies ‘There are numbers’.\nIn particular, it is irrelevant what the semantics for quantifiers in\na formal language is, in particular, whether it is objectual or\nsubstitutional. What ontological commitment comes down to can be\ndetermined at the level of ordinary English. Formal tools are of no,\nor at best limited, importance. Ontological commitment can thus\naccording to this line of thought be formulated simply as follows: you\nare committed to numbers if what you believe implies that there are\nnumbers. Notwithstanding the debate between the substitutional and\nobjectual semantics, we do not need any formal tools to spell out the\nsemantics of quantifiers. All that matters is that a certain\nquantified statement ‘There are \\(F\\)s’ is implied by\nwhat we believe for us to be committed to \\(F\\)s. What does not\nmatter is whether the semantics of the quantifier in “There are\n\\(F\\)s” (assuming it contains a\n quantifier[4])\n is objectual or substitutional. \nHowever, even if one agrees that what matters for ontological\ncommitment is whether or not what one believes implies that there are\n\\(F\\)s, for a certain kind of thing \\(F\\), there might still\nbe room for formal tools. First of all, it isn’t clear what implies\nwhat. Whether or not a set of statements that express my beliefs imply\nthat there are entities of a certain kind might not be obvious, and\nmight even be controversial. Formal methods can be useful in\ndetermining what implies what. On the other hand, even though formal\nmethods can be useful in determining what implies what, it is not\nclear which formal tools are the right ones for modeling a natural\nsystem of representations. It might seem that to determine which are\nthe right formal tools we already need to know what the implicational\nrelations are between the natural representations that we attempt to\nmodel, at least in basic cases. This could mean that formal tools are\nonly of limited use for deciding controversial cases of\nimplication. \nBut then, again, it has been argued that often it is not at all clear\nwhich statements really involve quantifiers at a more fundamental\nlevel of analysis, or\n logical form.\n Russell famously argued, in (Russell 1905), that “the King of\nFrance” is a quantified expression, even though it appears to be\na referring expression on the face of it, a claim now widely accepted.\nAnd Davidson argued, in (Davidson 1967), that ‘action\nsentences’ like “Fred buttered the toast” involve\nquantification over events in the logical form, though not on the\nsurface, a claim that is more controversial. One might argue in light\nof these debates that which sentences involve quantification over what\ncan’t be finally settled until we have a formal semantics of all of\nour natural language, and that this formal semantics will give us the\nultimate answer to what we are quantifying over. But then again, how\nare we to tell that the formal semantics proposed is correct, if we\ndon’t know the inferential relations in our own language? \nOne further use that formal tools could have besides all the above is\nto make ambiguities and different ‘readings’ explicit, and\nto model their respective inferential behavior. For example, formal\ntools are especially useful to make scope ambiguities explicit, since\ndifferent scope readings of one and the same natural language sentence\ncan be represented with different formal sentences which themselves\nhave no scope ambiguities. This use of formal tools is not restricted\nto ontology, but applies to any debates where ambiguities can be a\nhindrance. It does help in ontology, though, if some of the relevant\nexpressions in ontological debates, like the quantifiers themselves,\nexhibit such different readings. Then formal tools will be most useful\nto make this explicit. Whether or not quantifiers indeed do have\ndifferent readings is a question that will not be solved with formal\ntools, but if they do then these tools will be most useful in\nspecifying what these readings are. For a proposal of this latter\nkind, see (Hofweber 2000), (Hofweber 2005), and, in particular,\nchapter 3 of (Hofweber 2016). One consequence of this is a\nmeta-ontology different from Quine’s, as we will discuss below. \nLogically valid inferences are those that are guaranteed to be valid\nby their form. And above we spelled this out as follows: an inference\nis valid by its form if as long as we fix the meaning of certain\nspecial expressions, the logical constants, we can ignore the meaning\nof the other expressions in the statements involved in the inference,\nand we are always guaranteed that the inference is valid, no matter\nwhat the meaning of the other expressions is, as long as the whole is\nmeaningful. A logical truth can be understood as a statement whose\ntruth is guaranteed as long as the meanings of the logical constants\nare fixed, no matter what the meaning of the other expressions is.\nAlternatively, a logical truth is one that is a logical consequence\nfrom no assumptions, i.e. an empty set of premises. \nDo logical truths entail the existence of any entities, or is their\ntruth independent of what exists? There are some well known\nconsiderations that seem to support the view that logic should be\nneutral with respect to what there is. On the other hand, there are\nalso some well known arguments to the contrary. In this section we\nwill survey some of this debate. \nIf logical truth are ones whose truth is guaranteed as long as the\nmeaning of the logical constants is kept fixed then logical truths are\ngood candidates for being analytic truths. Can analytic truths imply\nthe existence of any entities? This is an old debate, often conducted\nusing “conceptual truths” instead of “analytic\ntruths”. The most prominent debate of this kind is the debate\nabout the ontological argument for the existence of God. Many\nphilosophers have maintained that there can be no conceptual\ncontradiction in denying the existence of particular entities, and\nthus there can be no proof of their existence with conceptual truths\nalone. In particular, an ontological argument for the existence of God\nis impossible. A famous discussion to this effect is Kant’s discussion\nof the ontological argument in (Kant 1781/7), namely (KrV A592/B620\nff.) On the other hand, many other philosophers have maintained that\nsuch an ontological argument is possible, and they have made a variety\nof different proposals how it can go. We will not discuss the\nontological argument here, however, it is discussed in detail in\ndifferent formulations in the entry on\n ontological arguments\n in this encyclopedia. \nWhatever one says about the possibility of proving the existence of an\nobject purely with conceptual truths, many philosophers have\nmaintained that at least logic has to be neutral about what\nthere is. One of the reasons for this insistence is the idea that\nlogic is topic neutral, or purely general. The logical truths are the\nones that hold no matter what the representations are about, and thus\nthey hold in any domain. In particular, they hold in an empty domain,\none where there is nothing at all. And if that is true then logical\ntruths can’t imply that anything exists. But that argument might be\nturned around by a believer in logical objects, objects whose\nexistence is implied by logic alone. If it is granted that logical\ntruths have to hold in any domain, then any domain has to contain the\nlogical objects. Thus for a believer in logical objects there can be\nno empty domain. \nThere is a close relationship between this debate and a common\ncriticism that standard formal logics (in the sense of (L1)) won’t be\nable to capture the logical truths (in the sense of (L2)). It is the\ndebate about the status of the empty domain in the semantics of first\nand second order logical systems. \nIt is a logical truth in (standard) first order logic that something\nexists, i.e., ‘\\(\\exists x\\,x=x\\)’. Similarly, it is a\nlogical truth in (standard versions of) second order logic that\n‘\\(\\exists F\\forall x\\,(Fx \\vee \\neg Fx)\\)’. These are existentially quantified\nstatements. Thus, one might argue, logic is not neutral with respect\nto what there is. There are logical truths that state that something\nexists. However, it would be premature to conclude that logic is not\nneutral about what there is, simply because there are logical truths\nin (standard) first or second order logic which are existential\nstatements. If we look more closely how it comes about that these\nexistential statements are logical truths in these logical systems we\nsee that it is only so because, by definition, a model for (standard)\nfirst order logic has to have a non-empty domain. It is possible to\nallow for models with an empty domain as well (where nothing exists),\nbut models with an empty domain are excluded, again, by definition\nfrom the (standard) semantics in first order logic. Thus (standard)\nfirst order logic is sometimes called the logic of first order models\nwith a non-empty domain. If we allow an empty domain as well we will\nneed different axioms or rules of inference to have a sound proof\nsystem, but this can be done. Thus even though there are formal\nlogical systems, in the sense of (L1) in which there are logical\ntruths that are existential statements, this does not answer the\nquestion whether or not there are logical truths, in the sense of\n(L2), that are existential statements. The question rather is which\nformal system, in the sense of (L1), best captures the logical truths,\nin the sense of (L2). So, even if we agree that a first order logical\nsystem is a good formal system to represent logical inferences, should\nwe adopt the axioms and rules for models with or without an empty\ndomain? \nA related debate is the debate about free logic. Free logics are\nformal systems that drop the assumption made in standard first and\nhigher order logic that every closed term denotes an object in the\ndomain of the model. Free logic allows for terms that denote nothing,\nand in free logic certain rules about the inferential interaction\nbetween quantifiers and terms have to be modified. Whether free or\nun-free (standard) logic is the better formal model for natural\nlanguage logical inference is a further question. For more discussion\nof logic with an empty domain see (Quine 1954) and (Williamson 1999).\nFor a sound and complete proof system for logic with an empty domain,\nsee (Tennant 1990). For a survey article on free logic, see (Lambert\n2001). \nHow innocent logic is with respect to ontology is also at the heart of\nthe debate about the status of second order logic as logic. (Quine\n1970) argued that second order logic was “set theory in sheep’s\nclothing”, and thus not properly logic at all. Quine was\nconcerned with the questions of whether second order quantifiers\nshould be understood as ranging over properties or over sets of\nindividuals. The former were considered dubious in various ways, the\nlatter turn second order logic into set theory. This approach to\nsecond order logic has been extensively criticized by various authors,\nmost notably George Boolos, who in a series of papers, collected in\npart I of (Boolos 1998), attempted to vindicate second order logic,\nand to propose a plural interpretation, which is discussed in the\narticle on\n plural quantification. \nA particularly important and pressing case of the ontological\nimplications of logic are logicist programs in the philosophy of\nmathematics, in particular Frege’s conception of logical objects and\nhis philosophy of arithmetic. Frege and neo-Fregeans following him\nbelieve that arithmetic is logic (plus definitions) and that numbers\nare objects whose existence is implied by arithmetic. Thus in\nparticular, logic implies the existence of certain objects, and\nnumbers are among them. Frege’s position has been criticized as being\nuntenable since logic has to be neutral about what there is. Thus\nmathematics, or even a part thereof, can’t be both logic and about\nobjects. The inconsistency of Frege’s original formulation of his\nposition sometimes has been taken to show this, but since consistent\nformulations of Frege’s philosophy of arithmetic have surfaced this\nlast point is moot. Frege’s argument for numbers as objects and\narithmetic as logic is probably the best known argument for logic\nimplying the existence of entities. It has been very carefully\ninvestigated in recent years, but whether or not it succeeds is\ncontroversial. Followers of Frege defend it as the solution to major\nproblems in the philosophy of mathematics; their critics find the\nargument flawed or even just a cheap trick that is obviously going\nnowhere. We will not discuss the details here, but a detailed\npresentation of the argument can be found in the entry on\n Frege’s theorem and foundations of arithmetic\n as well as (Rosen 1993), which gives a clear and readable\npresentation of the main argument of (Wright 1983), which in turn is\npartially responsible for a revival of Fregean ideas along these\nlines. Frege’s own version is in his classic (Frege 1884). A\ndiscussion of recent attempts to revive Frege can be found in (Hale\nand Wright 2001), (Boolos 1998) and (Fine 2002). A discussion of\nFrege’s and Kant’s conceptions of logic is in (MacFarlane 2002) which\nalso contains many historical references. \nFormal ontologies are theories that attempt to give precise\nmathematical formulations of the properties and relations of certain\nentities. Such theories usually propose axioms about these entities in\nquestion, spelled out in some formal language based on some system of\nformal logic. Formal ontology can been seen as coming in three kinds,\ndepending on their philosophical ambition. Let’s call them\nrepresentational, descriptive, and systematic. We will in this section\nbriefly discuss what philosophers, and others, have hoped to do with\nsuch formal ontologies. \nA formal ontology is a mathematical theory of certain entities,\nformulated in a formal, artificial language, which in turn is based on\nsome logical system like first order logic, or some form of the lambda\ncalculus, or the like. Such a formal ontology will specify axioms\nabout what entities of this kind there are, what their relations among\neach other are, and so on. Formal ontologies could also only have\naxioms that state how the things the theory is about, whatever they\nmay be, relate to each other, but no axioms that state that certain\nthings exist. For example, a formal ontology of events won’t say which\nevents there are. That is an empirical question. But it might say\nunder what operations events are closed under, and what structure all\nthe events there are exhibit. Similarly for formal ontologies of the\npart-whole relation, and others. See (Simons 1987) for a well known\nbook on various formal versions of mereology, the study of parts and\nwholes. \nFormal ontologies can be useful in a variety of different ways. One\ncontemporary use is as a framework to represent information in an\nespecially useful way. Information represented in a particular formal\nontology can be more easily accessible to automated information\nprocessing, and how best to do this is an active area of research in\ncomputer science. The use of the formal ontology here is\nrepresentational. It is a framework to represent information, and as\nsuch it can be representationally successful whether or not the formal\ntheory used in fact truly describes a domain of entities. So, a formal\nontology of states of affairs, lets say, can be most useful to\nrepresent information that might otherwise be represented in plain\nEnglish, and this can be so whether or not there indeed are any states\nof affairs in the world. Such uses of formal ontologies are thus\nrepresentational. \nA different philosophical use of a formal ontology is one that aims to\nbe descriptive. A descriptive formal ontology aims to correctly\ndescribe a certain domain of entities, say sets, or numbers, as\nopposed to all things there are. Take common conceptions of set theory\nas one example. Many people take set theory to aim at correctly\ndescribing a domain of entities, the pure sets. This is, of course, a\ncontroversial claim in the philosophy of set theory, but if it is\ncorrect then set theory could be seen as a descriptive formal ontology\nof pure sets. It would imply that among incompatible formal theories\nof sets only one could be correct. If set theory were merely\nrepresentational then both of the incompatible theories could be\nequally useful as representational tools, though probably for\ndifferent representational tasks. \nFinally, formal ontologies have been proposed as systematic theories\nof what there is, with some restrictions. Such systematic theories\nhope to give one formal theory for all there is, or at least a good\npart of it. Hardly anyone would claim that there can be a simple\nformal theory that correctly states what concrete physical objects\nthere are. There does not seem to be a simple principle that\ndetermines whether there are an even or odd number of mice at a\nparticular time. But maybe this apparent randomness only holds for\nconcrete physical objects. It might not hold for abstract objects,\nwhich according to many exist not contingently, but necessarily if at\nall. Maybe a systematic, simple formal theory is possible of all\nabstract objects. Such a systematic formal ontology will most commonly\nhave one kind of entities which are the primary subject of the theory,\nand a variety of different notions of reduction that specify how other\n(abstract) objects really are entities of this special kind. A simple\nview of this kind would be one according to which all abstract objects\nare sets, and numbers, properties, etc. are really special kinds of\nsets. However, more sophisticated versions of systematic formal\nontologies have been developed. An ambitious systematic formal\nontology can be found in (Zalta 1983) and (Zalta 1999, in the Other\nInternet Resources). \nRepresentational formal ontologies, somewhat paradoxically, are\nindependent of any strictly ontological issues. Their success or\nfailure is independent of what there is. Descriptive formal ontologies\nare just like representational ones, except with the ambition of\ndescribing a domain of entities. Systematic formal ontologies go\nfurther in not only describing one domain, but in relating all\nentities (of a certain kind) to each other, often with particular\nnotions of reduction. These theories seem to be the most ambitious.\nTheir motivation comes from an attempt to find a simple and systematic\ntheory of all, say, abstract entities, and they can rely on the\nparadigm of aiming for simplicity in the physical sciences as a guide.\nThey, just like descriptive theories, will have to have as their\nstarting point a reasonable degree of certainty that we indeed are\nontologically committed to the entities they aim to capture. Without\nthat these enterprises seem to have little attraction. But even if the\nlatter philosophical ambitions fail, a formal ontology can still be a\nmost useful representational tool. \nOne interesting view about the relationship between formal languages,\nontology, and meta-ontology is the one developed by Carnap in the\nfirst half of the 20th century, and which is one of the starting\npoints of the contemporary debate in ontology, leading to the\nwell-known exchange between Carnap and Quine, to be discussed below.\nAccording to Carnap one crucial project in philosophy is to develop\nframeworks that can be used by scientists to formulate\ntheories of the world. Such frameworks are formal languages that have\na clearly defined relationship to experience or empirical evidence as\npart of their semantics. For Carnap it was a matter of usefulness and\npracticality which one of these frameworks will be selected by the\nscientists to formulate their theories in, and there is no one correct\nframework that truly mirrors the world as it is in itself. The\nadoption of one framework rather than another is thus a practical\nquestion. \nCarnap distinguished two kinds of questions that can be asked about\nwhat there is. One are the so-called ‘internal questions’,\nquestions like ‘Are there infinitely many prime numbers?’\nThese questions make sense once a framework that contains talk about\nnumbers has been adopted. Such questions vary in degree of difficulty.\nSome are very hard, like ‘Are there infinitely many twin prime\nnumbers?’, some are of medium difficulty, like ‘Are there\ninfinitely many prime numbers?’, some are easy like ‘Are\nthere prime numbers?’, and some are completely trivial, like\n‘Are there numbers?’. Internal questions are thus\nquestions that can be asked once a framework that allows talk about\ncertain things has been adopted, and general internal questions, like\n‘Are there numbers?’ are completely trivial since once the\nframework of talk about numbers has been adopted the question if there\nare any is settled within that framework. \nBut since the internal general questions are completely trivial they\ncan’t be what the philosophers and metaphysicians are after when they\nask the ontological question ‘Are there numbers?’ The\nphilosophers aim to ask a difficult and deep question, not a trivial\none. What the philosophers aim to ask, according to Carnap, is not a\nquestion internal to the framework, but external to it. They aim to\nask whether the framework correctly corresponds to reality, whether or\nnot there really are numbers. However, the words used in the\nquestion ‘Are there numbers?’ only have meaning within the\nframework of talk about numbers, and thus if they are meaningful at\nall they form an internal question, with a trivial answer. The\nexternal questions that the metaphysician tries to ask are\nmeaningless. Ontology, the philosophical discipline that tries to\nanswer hard questions about what there really is is based on\na mistake. The question it tries to answer are meaningless questions,\nand this enterprise should be abandoned. The words ‘Are there\nnumbers?’ thus can be used in two ways: as an internal question,\nin which case the answer is trivially ‘yes’, but this has\nnothing to do with metaphysics or ontology, or as an external\nquestion, which is the one the philosophers are trying to ask, but\nwhich is meaningless. Philosophers should thus not be concerned with\n(O2), which is a discipline that tries to answer meaningless\nquestions, but with (L1), which is a discipline that, in part,\ndevelops frameworks for science to use to formulate and answer real\nquestions. Or so Carnap’s project. Carnap’s ideas about ontology and\nmeta-ontology are developed in his classic essay (Carnap 1956b). A\nnice summary of Carnap’s views can be found in his intellectual\nautobiography (Carnap 1963). \nCarnap’s rejection of ontology, and metaphysics more generally, has\nbeen widely criticized from a number of different angles. One common\ncriticism is that it relies on a too simplistic conception of natural\nlanguage that ties it too closely to science or to evidence and\nverification. In particular, Carnap’s more general rejection of\nmetaphysics used a verificationist conception of meaning, which is\nwidely seen as too simplistic. Carnap’s rejection of ontology has been\ncriticized most prominently by Quine, and the debate between Carnap\nand Quine on ontology is a classic in this field. Quine rejected\nCarnap’s conception that when scientists are faced with data that\ndon’t fit their theory they have two choices. First they could change\nthe theory, but stay in the same framework. Secondly, they could move\nto a different framework, and formulate a new theory within that\nframework. These two moves for Carnap are substantially different.\nQuine would want to see them as fundamentally similar. In particular,\nQuine rejects the idea that there could be truths which are the\ntrivial internal statements, like “There are numbers”,\nwhose truth is a given once the framework of numbers has been adopted.\nThus some such internal statements would be analytic truths, and Quine\nis well known for thinking that the distinction between analytic and\nsynthetic truths is untenable. Thus Carnap’s distinction between\ninternal and external questions is to be rejected alongside with the\nrejection of the distinction between analytic and synthetic truths. On\nthe other hand, Quine and Carnap agree that ontology in the\ntraditional philosophical sense is to be rejected. Traditionally\nontology has often, but not always, been an armchair, a priori,\ninvestigation into the fundamental building blocks of reality. As such\nit is completely separated from science. Quine rejects this approach\nto ontology since he holds that there can’t be such an investigation\ninto reality that is completely separate and prior to the rest of\ninquiry. See his (Quine 1951). See (Yablo 1998) for more on the debate\nbetween Quine and Carnap, which contains many references to the\nrelevant passages. The view on ontological commitment discussed in\nsection 4.1., which is usually attributed to Quine, was developed as a\nreaction to Carnap’s position discussed in this section. Simply put,\nQuine’s view is that to see what we are committed to we have to see\nwhat our best overall theory of the world quantifies over. In\nparticular, we look at our best overall scientific theory of the\nworld, which contains physics and the rest. \nCarnap’s arguments for the rejection of ontology are presently widely\nrejected. However, several philosophers have recently attempted to\nrevive some parts or others of Carnap’s ideas. For example, Stephen\nYablo has argued that an internal-external distinction could be\nunderstood along the lines of the fictional-literal distinction. And,\nhe argues in (Yablo 1998), since there is no fact about this\ndistinction, ontology, in the sense of (O2), rests on a mistake and is\nto be rejected, as Carnap did. On the other hand, Thomas Hofweber has\nargued that an internal-external distinction with many of the features\nthat Carnap wanted can be defended on the basis of facts about natural\nlanguage, but that such a distinction will not lead to a rejection of\nontology, in the sense of (O2). See (Hofweber 2005) and (Hofweber\n2016). Hilary Putnam, for example in (Putnam 1987), has developed a\nview that revives some of the pragmatic aspects of Carnap’s position.\nSee (Sosa 1993) for a critical discussion of Putnam’s view, and (Sosa\n1999) for a related, positive proposal. Robert Kraut in (Kraut 2016)\nhas defended an expressivist reading of the internal-external\ndistinction, and with it some Carnapian consequences for ontology. And\nmost of all, Eli Hirsch and Amie Thomasson have defended different\nversions of approaches to ontology that capture a good part of the\nspirit of Carnap’s view. See in particular (Hirsch 2011) and\n(Thomasson 2015). For various views about the effects of Carnap on the\ncontemporary debate in ontology, see (Blatti and Lapointe 2016). \nAlthough ontology is often understood as the discipline that tries to\nfind out what there is, or what exists, this is rejected by many in\nthe contemporary debate. These philosophers think that the job of\nontology is something different, and there is disagreement among them\nwhat it is more precisely. Among the proposed options are the projects\nof finding out what is real, or what is fundamental, or what the\nprimary substances are, or what reality is like in itself, or\nsomething like this. Proponents of these approaches often find the\nquestions about what there is too inconsequential and trivial to take\nthem to be the questions for ontology. Whether there are numbers, say,\nis trivially answered in the affirmative, but whether numbers are\nreal, or whether they are fundamental, or primary substances, etc., is\nthe hard and ontological question. See (Fine 2009) and (Schaffer 2009)\nfor two approaches along these lines. But such approaches have their\nown problems. For example, it is not clear whether the question\nwhether numbers are real is any different than the question whether\nnumbers exist. If one were to ask whether the Loch Ness monster is\nreal, it would naturally be understood as just the same question as\nwhether the Loch Ness monster exists. If it is supposed to be a\ndifferent question, is this due to simple stipulation, or can we make\nthe difference intelligible? Similarly, it is not clear whether the\nnotion of what is fundamental can carry the intended metaphysical\nweight. After all, there is a perfectly clear sense in which prime\nnumbers are more fundamental in arithmetic than even numbers, but this\nisn’t to hold the metaphysical priority of prime numbers over other\nnumbers, but simply to hold that they are mathematically special among\nthe numbers. Thus to ask whether numbers are fundamental is not easily\nseen as a metaphysical alternative to the approach to ontology that\nasks whether numbers exist. See (Hofweber 2009) and chapter 13 of\n(Hofweber 2016) for a critical discussion of some approaches to\nontology that rely on notions of reality or fundamentality. Whether\nsuch approaches to ontology are correct is a controversial topic in\nthe debate about ontology which we will not focus on here. However,\nthis approach gives rise to a special connection between logic and\nontology which we will discuss in the following. \nThe relation between the different approaches to ontology mentioned\njust above is unclear. Is something that is part of reality as it is\nin itself something which is fundamental, or which is real in the\nrelevant sense? Although it is unclear how these different approaches\nrelate to each other, all of them have the potential for allowing for\nthat our ordinary description of the world in terms of mid-size\nobjects, mathematics, morality, and so on, is literally true, while at\nthe same time these truths leave it open what the world, so to speak,\ndeep down, really, and ultimately is like. To use one way of\narticulating this, even though there are tables, numbers, and values,\nreality in itself might contain none of them. Reality in itself might\ncontain no objects at all, and nothing normative. Or it might. The\nordinary description of the world, on this conception, leaves it\nlargely open what reality in itself is like. To find that out is the\njob of metaphysics, in particular ontology. We might, given our\ncognitive setup, be forced to think of the world as one of objects,\nsay. But that might merely reflect how reality is for us. How it is in\nitself is left open. \nWhether the distinction between reality as it is for us and as it is\nin itself can be made sense of is an open question, in particular if\nit is not simply the distinction between reality as it appears to us,\nand as it really is. This distinction would not allow for the option\nthat our ordinary description of reality is true, while the question\nhow reality is in itself is left open by this. If our ordinary\ndescription were true then this would mean that how reality appears to\nus is how it in fact is. But if this distinction can be made sense of\nas intended then it gives rise to a problem about how to characterize\nreality as it is in itself, and this gives rise to a role for logic in\nthe sense of (L1). \nIf we are forced to think of the world in terms of objects because of\nour cognitive makeup then it would be no surprise that our natural\nlanguage forces us to describe the world in terms of objects. And\narguably some of the central features of natural languages do exactly\nthat. It represents information in terms of subject and predicate,\nwhere the subject paradigmatically picks out an object and the\npredicate paradigmatically attributes a property to it. If this is\ncorrect about natural language then it seems that natural language is\nutterly unsuitable to describe reality as it is in itself if the\nlatter does not contain any objects at all. But then, how are we to\ndescribe reality as it is in itself? \nSome philosophers have proposed that natural language might be\nunsuitable for the purposes of ontology. It might be unsuitable since\nit carries with it too much baggage from our particular conceptual\nscheme. See (Burgess 2005) for a discussion. Or it might be unsuitable\nsince various expressions in it are not precise enough, too context\nsensitive, or in other ways not ideally suited for the philosophical\nproject. These philosophers propose instead to find a new, better\nsuited language. Such a language likely will be a major departure from\nnatural language and instead will be a formal, artificial language.\nThis to be found language is often called ‘ontologese’\n(Dorr 2005), (Sider 2009), (Sider 2011), or ‘the fundamental\nlanguage’. The task thus is to find the fundamental language, a\nlanguage in the sense of (L1), to properly carry out ontology, in the\nnew and revised sense of (O2): the project of finding out what reality\nfundamentally, or in itself, etc., is like. For a critical discussion\nof the proposal that we should be asking the questions of ontology in\nontologese, see chapter 10 of (Thomasson 2015). \nBut this idea of a connection between (L1) and (O2) is not\nunproblematic. First there is a problem about making this approach to\n(O2) more precise. How to understand the notion of ‘reality in\nitself’ is not at all clear, as is well known. It can’t just\nmean: reality as it would be if we weren’t in it. On this\nunderstanding it would simply be the world as it is except with no\nhumans in it, which would in many of its grander features be just as\nit in fact is. But then what does it mean? Similar, but different,\nworries apply to those who rely on notions like\n‘fundamental’, ‘substance’, and the like. We\nwon’t pursue this issue here, though. Second, there is a serious worry\nabout how the formal language which is supposed to be the fundamental\nlanguage is to be understood. In particular, is it supposed to be\nmerely an auxiliary tool, or an essential one? This question is tied\nto the motivation for a formal fundamental language in the first\nplace. If it is merely to overcome ambiguities, imperfections, and\ncontext sensitivities, then it most likely will merely be an\nauxiliary, but not essential tool. After all, within natural language\nwe have many means available to get rid of ambiguities, imperfections\nand context sensitivities. Scope ambiguities can be often quite easily\nbe overcome with scope markers. For example, the ambiguities in\n‘\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) or \\(C\\)’ can be overcome as:\n‘either \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) or \\(C\\)’ on the one\nhand, and ‘\\(A\\) and either \\(B\\) or \\(C\\)’, on\nthe other. Other imprecisions can often, and maybe always, be overcome\nin some form or other. Formal languages are useful and often\nconvenient for precisification, but they don’t seem to be essential\nfor it. \nOn other hand, the formal fundamental language might be taken to be\nessential for overcoming shortcomings or inherent features of our\nnatural language as the one alluded to above. If the subject-predicate\nstructure of our natural languages brings with it a object-property\nway of representing the world, and if that way of representing the\nworld is unsuitable for representing how reality is in itself, then a\ncompletely different language might be required, and not simply be\nuseful, to describe fundamental reality. Alternatively, if the formal\nlanguage is needed to articulate real existence, as we might\nbe tempted to put it, something which we can’t express in English or\nother natural languages, then, too, it would be essential for the\nproject of ontology. But if the formal language is needed to do\nsomething that our natural language can’t do, then what do the\nsentences in the formal language mean? Since they do something our\nnatural language can’t do, we won’t be able to translate their\nmeanings into our natural language. If we could then our natural\nlanguage would be able to say what these sentences say, which by\nassumption it can’t do. But then what do sentences in the fundamental\nlanguage mean? If we can’t say or think what these sentences say, what\nis the point for us to use it to try to describe reality as it is in\nitself with them? Can we even make sense of the project of finding out\nwhich sentences in such a language are correct? And why should we\ncare, given that we can’t understand what these sentences mean? \nA sample debate related to the issues discussed in this section is the\ndebate about whether it might be that reality in itself does not\ncontain any objects. See, for example, (Hawthorne and Cortens 1995),\n(Burgess 2005), and (Turner 2011). Here the use of a variable and\nquantifier free language like predicate functor logic as the\nfundamental language is a recurring theme. \nOne way to understand logic is as the study of the most general forms\nof thought or judgment, what we called (L4). One way to understand\nontology is as the study of the most general features of what there\nis, our (O3). Now, there is a striking similarity between the most\ngeneral forms of thought and the most general features of what there\nis. Take one example. Many thoughts have a subject of which they\npredicate something. What there is contains individuals that have\nproperties. It seems that there is a kind of a correspondence between\nthought and reality: the form of the thought corresponds to the\nstructure of a fact in the world. And similarly for other forms and\nstructures. Does this matching between thought and the world ask for a\nsubstantial philosophical explanation? Is it a deep philosophical\npuzzle? \nTo take the simplest example, the form of our subject-predicate\nthoughts corresponds perfectly to the structure of object-property\nfacts. If there is an explanation of this correspondence to be given\nit seems it could go in one of three ways: either the form of thought\nexplains the structure of reality (a form of idealism), or the other\nway round (a form of realism), or maybe there is a common explanation\nof why there is a correspondence between them, for example on a form\nof theism where God guarantees a match. \nAt first it might seem clear that we should try to give an explanation\nof the second kind: the structure of the facts explains the forms of\nour thoughts that represent these facts. And an idea for such an\nexplanation suggests itself. Our minds developed in a world full of\nobjects having properties. If we had a separate simple representation\nfor these different facts then this would be highly inefficient. After\nall, it is often the same object that has different properties and\nfigures in different facts, and it is often the same property that is\nhad by different objects. So, it makes sense to split up our\nrepresentations of the objects and of the properties into different\nparts, and to put them back together in different combinations in the\nrepresentation of a fact. And thus it makes sense that our minds\ndeveloped to represent object-property facts with subject-predicate\nrepresentations. Therefore we have a mind whose thoughts have a form\nwhich mirrors the structure of the facts that make up the world. \nThis kind of an explanation is a nice try, and plausible, but it is\nrather speculative. That our minds really developed this way in light\nof those pressures is a question that is not easy to answer from the\narmchair. Maybe the facts do have a different structure, but our forms\nare close enough for practical purposes, i.e. for survival and\nflourishing. And maybe the correspondence does obtain, but not for\nthis largely evolutionary reason, but for a different, more direct and\nmore philosophical or metaphysical reason. \nTo explain the connection differently one could endorse the opposite\norder of explanatory priority, and argue that the form of thought\nexplains the structure of the world. This would most likely lead to an\nidealist position of sorts. It would hold that the general features of\nour minds explain some of the most general features of reality. The\nmost famous way to do something like this is Kant’s in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (Kant 1781/7). We won’t be able to\ndiscuss it here in any detail. This strategy for explaining the\nsimilarity has the problem of explaining how there can be a world that\nexists independently of us, and will continue to exist after we have\ndied, but nonetheless the structure of this world is explained by the\nforms of our thoughts. Maybe this route could only be taken if one\ndenies that the world exists independently of us, or maybe one could\nmake this tension go away. In addition one would have to say how the\nform of thought explains the structure of reality. For one attempt to\ndo this, see (Hofweber 2018). \nBut maybe there is not much to explain here. Maybe reality does not\nhave anything like a structure that mirrors the form of our thoughts,\nat least not understood a certain way. One might hold that the truth\nof the thought “John smokes” does not require a world\nsplit up into objects and properties, it only requires a smoking John.\nAnd all that is required for that is a world that contains John, but\nnot also another thing, the property of smoking. Thus a structural\nmatch would be less demanding, only requiring a match between objects\nand object directed thought, but no further match. Such a view would\nbe broadly nominalistic about properties, and it is rather\ncontroversial.  \nAnother way in which there might be nothing to explain is connected to\nphilosophical debates about truth. If a correspondence theory of truth\nis correct, and if thus for a sentence to be true it has to correspond\nto the world in a way that mirrors the structure and matches parts of\nthe sentence properly with parts of the world, then the form of a true\nsentence would have to be mirrored in the world. But if, on the other\nextreme, a coherence theory of truth is correct then the truth of a\nsentence does not require a structural correspondence to the world,\nbut merely a coherence with other sentences. For more on all aspects\nof truth see (Künne 2003). \nWhether or not there is a substantial metaphysical puzzle about the\ncorrespondence of the form of thoughts and the structure of reality\nwill itself depend on certain controversial philosophical topics. And\nif there is a puzzle here, it might be a trivial one, or it might be\nquite deep. And as usual in these parts of philosophy, how substantial\na question is is itself a hard question. \nWith the many conceptions of logic and the many different\nphilosophical projects under the heading of ontology, there are many\nproblems that are in the intersection of these areas. We have touched\non several above, but there are also others. Although there is no\nsingle problem about the relationship between logic and ontology,\nthere are many interesting connections between them, some closely\nconnected to central philosophical questions.
