Some have\nargued that he was an advocate of Advaita Vedānta (Phillips 1995;\nRam-Prasad 2002). Vedānta (literally, the end of the Vedas) is a\nfamily of competing philosophical interpretations of the texts called\nUpaniṣads that appear at the end of the\n Vedas.[2]\n Many texts of Vedānta are commentaries on the canonical summary\nof the Upaniṣads given by Bādarāyaņa’s\nAphorisms on the Brahman (Brahmasūtra). Advaita\nVedānta (i.e., non-dualistic Vedānta) is an interpretation\nof the Upaniṣads and Bādarāyaņa’s\nAphorisms, according to which it is only the self or\nconsciousness or Brahman that is ultimately real. The Indian\nphilosopher Śaṃkara (7th century CE) defended\nthis form of non-dualism in his commentary on\nBādarāyaṇa’s Aphorisms.\nŚrīharṣa’s only surviving philosophical\n work[3]The Sweets of Refutation\n(Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍanakhādya) may be\nread as a defense of this kind of non-dualism, even though he\ndoesn’t share all the standard commitments of Śaṃkara\nand his followers. This reading of Śrīharṣa, however,\nremains controversial (Granoff\n 1978).[4]\n \n\nThe broader appeal of Śrīharṣa’s work is\nindependent of whether he was a defender of Advaita Vedānta.\nThroughout The Sweets of Refutation,\nŚrīharṣa’s aim is to demonstrate the instability\nof rational inquiry within philosophy. For any argument that a\nphilosopher may offer for her view, there is always an equally\npersuasive counterargument that undermines its conclusion. Since the\ndeliverances of reason are always vulnerable to rational defeat in\nthis way, they cannot constitute good evidence for any philosophical\nview. To illustrate this idea, Śrīharṣa targets a\nphilosophical method—what we may call the method of\ndefinition—pursued by Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika\nphilosophers in informal logic, epistemology and\n metaphysics.[5]\n The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers use this method of\ndefinition to describe a number of ontological categories which are\nsupposed to capture the structure of reality, and a number of\nepistemological and logical categories which are supposed to capture\nvarious components of rational inquiry. What the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher wishes to affirm in the\nend is a dualistic ontology: the commonsense view on which\nreality consists of a plurality of things distinct from the self or\nconsciousness, e.g., material things, their qualities, relations\namongst them, and so on. Śrīharṣa wants to show that\nany attempt at defining the epistemological, logical, and\nontological categories that the dualist needs for the success of her\nproject must fail: the very standards of rational inquiry that the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers adopt undermine their\ntheoretical enterprise from within.\n\n\nŚrīharṣa’s incisive arguments against\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika informal logic, epistemology and\nmetaphysics were influential amongst the defenders of both Advaita\nVedānta and Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika\n philosophy.[6]\n However, they should also be of considerable interest to the\ncontemporary reader. In the second half of the twentieth century,\nAnglophone philosophers have grappled with various difficulties that\narise for definitions of epistemological notions like\nknowledge and metaphysical notions like causation.\nWhile attacking the method of definition pursued by the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers, Śrīharṣa\nanticipates many of these difficulties. His reaction to these\ndifficulties is pessimistic: he takes these difficulties to\ndemonstrate the futility of offering definitions for commonsense\nepistemological and ontological categories.\nŚrīharṣa’s arguments for this conclusion remain\nas relevant to our current philosophical concerns as they were to\nthose of his contemporaries: if his arguments are successful, they\nwill show that philosophical inquiry doesn’t really take us very\nfar when it comes to illuminating fundamental epistemological and\nmetaphysical concepts.\n\n\nSince it is impossible to address all the philosophically interesting\nthemes that emerge from Śrīharṣa’s work, most of\nour discussion in this article shall focus on a small number of topics\nthat illustrate Śrīharṣa’s general approach to\nphilosophical problems.\n\n\n\n\nThis section describes the philosophical method that\nŚrīharṣa employs in The Sweets of Refutation,\nand explains what he sought to achieve by it. \nThroughout The Sweets of Refutation,\nŚrīharṣa’s target is a theory of rational\ninquiry laid down in the Nyāya system. As defined by the\ncommentator of the Aphorisms on Inquiry\n(Nyāyasūtra), Vātsyāyana (5th\ncentury CE), the term ‘nyāya’ stands just for\ncritical or rational inquiry. He tells us,  \nNyāya is the examination of an object using methods of\nknowing, consisting in reasoning based on perceptual and scriptural\nevidence. It is inquiry, where inquiry is just the examination of that\nwhich has been presented by perception or scripture. (Thakur 1967: 3)\n \nThe opening sentence of the Aphorisms on Inquiry is a list of\nsixteen items that constitute the subject-matter of the Nyāya\nsystem. \nThe highest good is achieved through the knowledge of the nature\nof: \nIn his commentary, Vātsyāyana explains this text as follows.\nEvery area of learning is concerned with a proprietary highest good,\nand makes available the kind of knowledge that is conducive to\nachieving that good; for instance, the science of the self\n(adhyātmavidyā) is concerned with the goal of\nliberation, and helps us achieve liberation by leading us to the\nknowledge of the true nature of the self (Thakur 1967: 5). But in\norder to gain the knowledge that any area of learning has to offer,\none must inquire. A properly conducted episode of inquiry begins with\nan initial state of uncertainty regarding the nature of an object\npresumably in the domain of knowable entities, involves the\napplication of various methods of knowing (such as perception,\ninference, testimony, etc.), and terminates in a final conclusion,\nwhich constitutes knowledge of the relevant object's nature. The items\nlisted under (i) and (ii) are components of any such inquiry. When\ninquiry is conducted by several parties aloud in speech, it becomes a\ndebate. The items listed under (iii) describe different styles of\ndebate, and various strategies that one may employ in response to\none's opponent within the arena of debate. \nVātsyāyana helpfully delineates the philosophical method\nthat the Nyāya system, as laid out in the Aphorisms on\nInquiry, uses in treating its subject matter. It proceeds in\nthree steps (Thakur 1967: 181). The first step consists in\nenumeration (uddeśa), which involves mentioning\nthe various items to be treated in the theory, e.g., in the lists (i),\n(ii), and (iii) given above. The second step consists in definition\n(lakṣaṇa) which involves laying down a\ndefining property, i.e., a property that distinguishes the\nnature of the definiendum (tattvavyavacchedaka-dharma)\n (Ibid.).[7]\n The third consists in examination\n(parīkṣā), i.e., checking whether or not a\ncertain definition is adequate. The philosopher’s project, on\nthis view, is therefore to define a kind K by articulating\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for being an\ninstance of K, where K may be a method of knowing, a\nkind of knowable entity, a component of rational inquiry, a style of\ndebate, or a dialectical strategy. This project was developed by the\ncommentators and sub-commentators of the Aphorisms on\nInquiry, and was ultimately absorbed into a larger syncretic\ntradition that combined the epistemological commitments of Nyāya\nwith the ontological scheme of Vaiśeṣika philosophy and\ntherefore came to be known as Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika. \nThere are two distinct purposes that Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika\nphilosophers ascribe to definitions. \nSpecifying the Definiendum. According to Vācaspati\nMiśra (9th century CE), a definition  \nspecifies the definiendum [i.e., the object to be defined] by\ndistinguishing it from things of similar and dissimilar kinds\n(samānāsamānajātīyebhyo vyavacchidya\nlakṣyaṃ vyavasthāpayati). (Thakur 1967: 186)\n \nSuppose—following the early Vaiśeṣika\nphilosophers—we define earth as the kind of substance that has\nthe property of having smell. On the basis of this definition, we can\nmake the following inference:  \nThe kind of substance under discussion is distinct from anything that\nisn’t earth; for it has smell. And anything that isn’t\nearth lacks smell, e.g., water.  \nThus, we are able to distinguish earth from non-earth in this\nmanner. \nEstablishing the Use of the Definiendum Term. In his Row\nof Light-Beams (Kiraṇāvalī), the later\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher Udayana (10th\ncentury CE) describes a different purpose that a definition may serve:\n \nalternatively, the purpose of a definition (or a defining property) is\nto establish the use [of the definiendum term, i.e., the\nexpression that picks out the definiendum] (vyavahārasiddhir\nvā lakṣaṇa-prayojanam). (Sarvabhouma 1911 [1989:\n194])  \nTo establish the use of the definiendum term is to specify the range\nof entities to which it is ordinarily applied. At least on one\ninterpretation of Udayana, a definition does this by specifying the\nreason for which the relevant expression is applied\n(pravṛtti-nimitta), i.e., the application-conditions of\nthat expression (Bhattacharyya 1990: 98–99; Granoff 1978: n.\n74). Here, the application-conditions of an expression just consist in\na property possessed by all and only referents of that expression.\nTake the definition of earth as that which possesses\nearthhood: this specifies the application-conditions of the\nexpression ‘earth’ since people commonly apply the\nexpression to things that possess earthhood. Using the definition,\ntherefore, one can make an inference of the following sort,  \nThe kind of substance under discussion is commonly called\n‘earth’; for it possesses earthhood. Whatever isn’t\ncommonly called ‘earth’ doesn’t possess earthhood,\ne.g., wind.  \nThis inference, in turn, specifies the extension of the term\n‘earth’ as it is commonly used. \nBoth these uses of definitions are important for understanding\nŚrīharṣa’s dialectical strategy in The\nSweets of Refutation. \nThroughout The Sweets of Refutation\nŚrīharṣa’s aim is to argue against\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers by means of what he calls\nrefutation-arguments (khaṇḍana-yukti).\nRefutation-arguments against definitions are supposed to reveal that\nthe relevant definitions are inadequate. In cases where no adequate\ndefinition is available for an entity, the relevant entity to be\ndefined cannot be specified, i.e., distinguished from those things\nthat are distinct from\n it.[8]\n This follows from the thesis, endorsed by Vācaspati Miśra,\nthat the purpose of a definition is to specify the definiendum by\ndistinguishing it from things that are distinct from it. So, if\nŚrīharṣa’s refutation-arguments are successful\nin showing that there exists no adequate definition for any of the\nontological, logical, and epistemological categories that the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher seeks to define, then she\nwill have failed to specify those categories that are essential to her\ntheoretical enterprise. \nŚrīharṣa describes two ways in which his\nrefutation-arguments could be useful. First of all, they are supposed\nto favor the kind of non-dualism—defended by supporters of\nAdvaita Vedānta—which says that the self or consciousness\nis the only thing that is ultimately exists. According to\nŚrīharṣa, the refutation-arguments show that we cannot\nestablish the ultimate reality of the variegated world as it appears\nin perceptual experience, the world which appears to be constituted by\na plurality of things and whose existence we assume for our everyday\npractical purposes (KKh 63). This is because we cannot adequately\ndefine the various ontological and epistemological\ncategories—such as difference, causation,\nrelation, knowledge, perception,\netc.—using which we make sense of that world and our epistemic\nrelationship with it. It is in this sense that the variegated world as\nit appears to us in perception is indeterminable\n (anirvicanīya).[9]\n And in the absence of such definitions, the distinctions\namongst these constituents of reality and our methods of knowing them\ncannot be treated as ultimately real. This in turn will clear room for\nnon-dualism. \nSecond, even though the main purpose of refutation-arguments is to\nshow that the plurality of things in the world shouldn’t be\ntreated as ultimately real, Śrīharṣa claims that they\nmay also prove useful for the opponents of non-dualism. For instance,\nif one is a Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher who admits the\nreality of methods of knowing, etc., then one may use at least some of\nthe refutation-arguments to rule out alternative views held by other\nphilosophers, including the views of their predecessors within the\nsame school as well as their opponents. Moreover, even in the kind of\ndebate where one is engaged in the pursuit of truth and doesn’t\nmerely seek to defeat one’s opponent, one would have to respond\nto refutation-arguments before one could arrive at one’s own\nview. Thus, refutation-arguments have universal application (KKh\n123–125). \nWhile offering his arguments, Śrīharṣa explicitly\nappeals to three criteria of adequacy for definitions which he takes\nto be common ground between himself and his opponents. \nThe latter two criteria of adequacy seem to appeal to the two\ndifferent conceptions of definitions mentioned above. \nThe criterion of non-circularity seems to follow straightforwardly\nfrom the conception of definition on which a definition is supposed to\nlay down a distinguishing property of a kind K, which in turn\ncan help us distinguish instances of K from all other objects.\nThis seems to entail that the definition of K can’t\nappeal directly or indirectly back to K itself; for then it\nwould be unhelpful when it comes to distinguishing instances of\nK from other entities. But if the purpose of a definition is to\ncapture the application-conditions of the definiendum term, then the\ncriterion of non-circularity doesn’t make much sense; for the\nconcept on the basis of which the definiendum term is used might be\nunanalyzable independently of itself, so no non-circular definition\nmight be available for it. \nBy contrast, the criterion of uniformity seems to be connected with\nthe second conception of definition on which the purpose of a\ndefinition is to establish the use of the definiendum term. If the\nexpression is applied to a number of distinct entities, we might\nexpect that these entities share some unifying property in virtue of\nwhich the same expression is applied to them. A\ndefinition—insofar as it is intended to capture the\napplication-conditions of the definiendum term—would be\ninadequate if it didn’t capture this unifying\n property.[10]\n But if the purpose of a definition is only to lay down a\ndistinguishing property for the definiendum, then the criterion of\nuniformity doesn’t make much sense; for the only distinguishing\nproperty for the definiendum may well be a motley disjunction of\ndifferent properties. \nThis section examines Śrīharṣa’s treatment of\ndefinitions of knowledge (pramā). \nThe very first definition of knowledge that Śrīharṣa\nattacks is offered by Udayana in his Garland of Definitions\n(Lakṣaṇamālā) (Jhā 1963: 3). \nAfter offering a long series of objections against the definitions of\ntruth (tattva) and non-mnemonic awareness\n(anubhūti), Śrīharṣa proceeds to give a\ngeneral argument against this definition: it overextends to the case\nof accidentally true (kākatālīya-samvāda)\nawareness (KKh 207–208). He then proceeds to give some examples\nof such accidentally true awareness that we can flesh out as\nfollows. \nShells. Holding five shells in his closed fist, a bookie asks\nthe gambler, “How many shells do I have in my hand?” The\ngambler hasn’t seen the contents of the bookie’s hand,\nbut, for some reason, he has a hunch that there are five shells in the\nbookie’s hand. On that basis, he judges that there are five\nshells in the bookie’s hand. So, he replies, “Five.”\nDoes that mean that he knows this claim? Surely not: the gambler has\nhit the truth merely accidentally (KKh 208). \nMist. You look at a far-away hill, and see what looks like\nsmoke emerging from it. So, you judge that there is smoke on the hill.\nSince you know that fire always accompanies smoke, you infer,\n“There’s fire on the hill.” In fact, what you saw\nwas just mist, but there is in fact fire on the hill. Your awareness\ntherefore is true, but is it knowledge? Once again, you have only\naccidentally hit the truth, and therefore you lack knowledge (KKh\n211). \nHorns. An animal comes into your view, but you are unable to\ntell what it is. A little later, as you get closer, you see horns on\nthe animal’s head. Falsely, you believe that only cows have\nhorns. So, you infer, “That animal is a cow.” Your\nawareness is true, but only accidentally so. That is why you lack\nknowledge (KKh 213). \nThese are cases of epistemic luck: in each case, the protagonist hits\nthe truth, but only luckily so. That is why he or she lacks knowledge.\nŚrīharṣa’s discussion of these counterexamples\nto the “true awareness” account of knowledge is\nsignificant for two reasons. \nFirst of all, Mist and Horns clearly conform to the\nstructure of standard Gettier cases; similar examples are also\ndiscussed by classical Indian philosophers such as Dharmottara,\nKumārila, and Srīdhara (Matilal 1986: ch. 4; Ganeri 2007:\nch. 5; Stoltz 2007). Even though Śrīharṣa\ndoesn’t intend these examples to be counterexample to any\n“justified true belief” account of knowledge, he does seem\nto think that in order to rule out cases of this kind from the scope\nof knowledge, we need to impose an anti-luck condition on knowledge.\nAnd this is precisely the lesson that philosophers have drawn from the\ncases of epistemic luck described by Gettier (1963). What this suggests is that\nthe kind of intuitions that Gettier and others were trying to\nelicit with such cases are not intuitions shared by a narrow group of\nAnglophone philosophers. This, in turn, casts doubt on\narguments—offered by early researchers in experimental\nphilosophy (Weinberg et al 2001; Weinberg 2007)—which sought to\ndebunk Gettier intuitions by showing that they might just have been\nartifacts of a certain culture. The history of Indian philosophy in\nSanskrit shows that even in classical India, Gettier phenomena were\nrecognized as a potential problem for theories of knowledge that\ndidn’t include any anti-luck condition. This, one might argue,\nshould bolster our confidence in treating such intuitions as evidence\nin philosophical inquiry. \nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, Śrīharṣa uses\nthese cases to argue that there may not after all be any satisfactory\ndefinition of knowledge. Even though Śrīharṣa’s\ncriticisms are directed against proposals of knowledge defended by his\npredecessors and contemporaries, his arguments remain relevant to\ntoday’s discussions of knowledge. On the one hand, he\nanticipates some of the problems that arise for recent attempts at\nsolving the Gettier problem, e.g., ­conditions like\nsensitivity and safety and theories like the\nrelevant alternatives theory. On the other hand, he also\nclaims that the problem posed by cases of epistemic luck cannot be\navoided simply by treating knowledge—as Williamson (2000)\ndoes—as analytically primitive. The following three sections\nsurvey some of these arguments. \nImmediately after considering Shells,\nŚrīharṣa entertains the following modification of the\n“true awareness” account of knowledge. \nŚrīharṣa goes on to gloss this proposal as saying that\nknowledge consists in non-recollective awareness of the truth produced\nby a set of causal conditions\n(kāraṇa-sāmagrī)—which includes\nthe method (karaṇa) as well as background causal\nconditions—that never produce false awareness (see\n footnote 11).\n Presumably, the defender of this proposal would want to say that in\ncases of accidentally true awareness, the causal conditions that\nproduce the awareness-episode could easily have given rise to false\nawareness. For instance, in Shells, the causal conditions\nthat give rise to the relevant episode of awareness could also have\nproduced the awareness that the bookie had five shells in his hand\nwhen he in fact had four. In this respect, knowledge\nii resembles anti-luck conditions like safety and\nsensitivity, both of which appeal to methods that don’t\nproduce false beliefs in nearby\n possibilities.[12] \nŚrīharṣa sees a danger of extensional inadequacy here:\nthe new clause in the definition of knowledge is unable to rule out\naccidentally true awareness from the scope of knowledge.\nŚrīharṣa’s argument relies on the following\nprinciple. \nThe principle in fact falls out of Śrīharṣa’s\nNyāya-Vaiśesika opponent’s view. For most\nNyāya-Vaiśesika philosophers, the status of an\nawareness-episode as knowledge and therefore its status as true and\nnon-recollective is causally explained solely by certain epistemic\nvirtues (guṇa) that reside in the causal conditions\nthat give rise to\n it.[14]\n If this is the case, then the truth of a non-recollective\nawareness-episode should be explained solely in terms of those\nepistemic virtues. Hence, if an awareness-episode is true and\nnon-recollective, then the causal conditions that give rise to the\nrelevant awareness-episode—in virtue of the epistemic virtues\nthat reside in them—should suffice to give rise to a\ntrue awareness-episode in every case, i.e., they\ncouldn’t give rise to a false awareness-episode. \nNow, if the sufficiency principle is correct,\nthen the same set of causal conditions that gives rise to an\naccidentally true awareness-episode couldn’t possibly give rise\nto a false awareness-episode. Otherwise, we would be committed to\nsomething absurd, namely that even false awareness-episodes are true.\nThe only other option is to grant that the set of causal conditions\nthat gives rise to a true awareness-episode can only give rise to true\nawareness-episodes. In that case, the proposed definition of knowledge\nwould be incapable of ruling out instances of accidentally true\nawareness. \nHowever, one might suspect that the sufficiency\nprinciple is not true after all. For instance, in cases like\nShells, it does seem as if the causal conditions that give\nrise the agent’s awareness could also produce false awareness.\nMoreover, nothing Śrīharṣa says in fact decisively\nsupports this\n principle.[15]\n But it is worth pointing out that Śrīharṣa needs\nnothing as strong as the sufficiency principle\nto make the point that he wants to make. The general objection seems\nto be this. Suppose we explain the status of any awareness-episode as\nknowledge by appealing to the good-making features of the relevant\ncausal mechanism—the putative epistemic virtues of the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher—that gives rise to\nit. We may say that these epistemic virtues are the ones that\nguarantee that the awareness-episode won’t be false. But an\naccidentally true awareness-episode is one which is produced by a\ncausal mechanism that lacks all of these knowledge-conducive epistemic\nvirtues, and that is why it isn’t guaranteed to be true. This\nexplains why such awareness-episodes seem true as a matter of luck.\nBut the problem is this. No matter what these truth-guaranteeing\nepistemic virtues are, it will always be possible to find episodes of\nawareness which are produced by causal mechanisms that possess all\nthese virtues, but nevertheless only accidentally true. In this sense,\neven if the new definition of knowledge is fleshed out in terms of\nknowledge-conducive epistemic virtues, it won’t be able to rule\nout cases of knowledge-destroying epistemic luck. So, the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher’s appeal to causal\nconditions that would never give rise to false awareness-episodes\nseems mistaken.  \nHere is another kind of method-based solution that\nŚrīharṣa takes up a little later in the text (KKh\n238). \nThe rationale for the proposal, once again, is clear. In cases like\nShells, there is something defective about the manner in\nwhich the agent arrives at his or her final awareness: in the first\ncase, it is a blind guess, and in the latter two, it is a perceptual\nerror. \nŚrīharṣa notes that this definition won’t be\ninformative unless his opponent specifies what defectiveness consists\nin. Suppose a defender of knowledge iii says,\n \nIt is a distinctive property which is conducive to the production of\ncontrary awareness-episodes and which is possessed by the\ncausal conditions that give rise to such awareness-episodes\n(viparītajñānaprayojakas taddhetugato\nviśeṣaḥ). (KKh 238)  \nBut what are contrary awareness-episodes? The opponent cannot say that\ncontrary awareness-episodes are just false\nawareness-episodes, because that would make this proposal equivalent\nto knowledge ii; for, now, knowledge\niii will just entail that knowledge is\nnon-mnemonic awareness of the truth produced by a method that\ndoesn’t possess a property that is conducive to the production\nof false awareness-episodes. If the qualifier “contrary”\nis supposed to rule out knowledge, then the opponent won’t be\nable to define knowledge in knowledge-independent terms. Therefore,\nher definition of knowledge will be circular. \nOnce again, the charge of circularity generalizes quite nicely to\nother proposals that appeal to the notion of method or\ncausal process. The general argument is that if we want to\nrule out accidentally true awareness from the scope of knowledge by\nappealing to the non-defectiveness of methods, then we need a\nnon-circular account of epistemic defects that can be stated in\nknowledge-independent terms. Śrīharṣa is skeptical\nthat such a non-circular account is available. \nŚrīharṣa considers another proposal—defended by\nUdayana and Bhāsarvajña (10th century\nCE)—according to which knowledge is “proper\ncircumscription” (samyak-paricchitti)\n(Upādhyāya & Śāstri 1957: 475;\nSvāmī Yogīndrānanda 1968: 11). In explaining this definition, Śrīharṣa\nsays that “proper circumscription” can’t just mean\ntrue or correct awareness; for then this proposal\nwill inherit all the problems that the “true awareness”\naccount of knowledge faces. So, he reconstructs this proposal on the\nbasis of some remarks that Udayana makes elsewhere while discussing\nknowledge of one’s\n knowledge.[16] \nAccording to the reconstructed proposal, knowledge is proper\ncircumscription of an object in the sense that it involves an\nawareness of an object along with (or on the basis\nof) its distinctive mark\n(viśeṣasahita-dharmi-paricchitti). The best\nversion of this proposal—which Śrīharṣa arrives\nat after considering a series of initial refinements—seems to be\nthis. \nOn this picture, knowledge involves discrimination: in order\nto know that an object o is F, one must be able to\ndiscriminate o from things that are not F. Knowledge\ngives the agent this ability insofar as it involves an\nawareness-episode that puts the agent in touch with a genuine feature\nof the object o in virtue of which she can distinguish o\nfrom non-Fs. We can see how this definition rules out cases\nlike Shells, Mist, and Horns. In\nShells, since the agent’s awareness-episode arises from\na blind guess, he or she isn’t aware of any distinctive mark\nX in virtue of which she could tell whether the number of\nshells in the gambler’s hand is five rather than, say, three or\nfour. Similarly, in Mist, the agent mistakes mist for smoke.\nEven though smoke is a distinctive mark of fire, the smoke that she\nascribes to the mountain isn’t a property that the mountain\nactually has. Finally, in Horns, the agent infers that the\nanimal before her is a cow on the basis of the fact that it has horns.\nBut horns aren’t a distinctive mark of cows. \nŚrīharṣa argues that this definition of knowledge\nfails to satisfy the criterion of uniformity; for the relevant\ndistinctive mark—the awareness of which is necessary for\nknowledge—will vary from one case to another. For example, when\nit comes to an awareness of a clod of earth as earth, the distinctive\nproperty X would have to be a property distinctive of earth,\ne.g., earthhood or having smell, etc. But when it\ncomes to recognizing a cow as a cow, the distinctive property X\nwould have to be something else: a property that is distinctive of\ncows, e.g., cowhood or having a dewlap,\netc. In general, Śrīharṣa claims that there\nis no way of uniformly characterizing this distinctive property\nX that an agent needs to be aware of in order to have\n knowledge.[18] \nMore importantly, Śrīharṣa suggests that even if there\nare uniform characterizations of the notion of a distinctive\nmark, such characterizations will inevitably be uninformative. To\nshow this, he considers a minimal pair of cases which we may flesh out\nas follows. \nThe challenge is this. Both Uma and Una get the same information from\nthe relevant speakers. But in order to explain the difference in\nepistemic status between their awareness-episodes, the defender of\nknowledge iv needs to show that Una is aware\nof a distinctive mark X in virtue of which she can tell that\nthere are five fruits hanging from the tree on the river-bank, but Uma\nisn’t aware of any such distinctive mark. But we could just\nstipulate that in Castor and Pollux, there is no property\nX such that Una is aware of X on the basis of\nCastor’s testimony, but Uma is not aware of X on the\nbasis of Pollux’s testimony. This shows that we cannot clearly\nidentify the distinctive mark X in every case of knowledge. \nFor Śrīharṣa, without any adequate uniform\nand informative characterization of the distinctive mark\nX, the definition of knowledge as proper circumscription of the\nobject ought to be rejected (for other objections that he offers, see\nGaneri 2016). This charge seems to be getting at something general\nabout a class of different approaches towards defining knowledge.\nSeveral contemporary theories of knowledge involve a conception of\nknowledge as involving a discriminatory capacity of some kind. Take,\nfor instance, the relevant alternatives theory which says\nthat in order to know a proposition P, an agent must be able to\nrule out relevant possibilities where P is false (Stine 1976;\nGoldman 1976; Dretske 1981; Lewis 1996). However, as it turns out,\nwhich possibilities count as relevant will vary from one scenario to\nanother, and perhaps also from one context of knowledge-attribution to\nanother. In particular cases, we might indeed be able to tell whether\na certain alternative counts as relevant or not. But it is unclear\nthat we could systematize these intuitions enough to produce a single\nunified criterion of relevance; or, even if we did manage to do so, it\nis unclear whether such a criterion would be informative enough to\ngenerate predictions about every possible scenario. Thus, once again,\nŚrīharṣa’s worry generalizes. \nThese problems are not the only problems that Śrīharṣa\nraises for various definitions of knowledge, but they are useful\ninsofar as they give us a clear understanding of what he takes to be\nan adequate definition of knowledge. He seems to think that a\ndefinition of knowledge should give us a unified decision procedure\nwhich will allow us to correctly predict whether any particular\nawareness-episode is an instance of knowledge without appealing back\nto the notion of knowledge itself. Moreover, insofar as he appeals to\nour intuitions about cases, he also seems to assume that this decision\nprocedure should respect (to some extent) our ordinary concept of\nknowledge. But one might respond to Śrīharṣa by\npointing out that this approach only makes sense if we assume that the\nconcept of knowledge is analyzable in terms of more basic concepts\nthat do not refer back to knowledge. What if we deny this assumption\nand claim, with writers like Williamson (2000), that the ordinary\nconcept of knowledge is unanalyzable in that manner? \nŚrīharṣa entertains a proposal that connects up nicely\nwith this question (KKh 245). He imagines an opponent who says\nthat \nŚrīharṣa is skeptical of the idea that knowledgehood\nis a natural kind property. But even if we set that topic aside, it is\nnot difficult to see that this proposal essentially seeks to avoid\nŚrīharṣa’s objections against the definability\nof knowledge, by treating the concept of knowledge as unanalyzable in\nknowledge-independent terms. \nŚrīharṣa imagines the defender of this proposal to be\nsomeone who thinks that our ordinary self-ascriptions of knowledge\nreliably track the presence of knowledgehood in various\nawareness-episodes. But this can only be the case if there is some\nkind of causal connection between knowledgehood and our\nself-ascriptions of knowledge, i.e., if knowledgehood causally\nregulates our self-ascriptions of knowledge. But surely,\nŚrīharṣa argues, knowledgehood can only give rise to\nself-ascriptions of knowledge insofar as we are aware that\nknowledgehood is instantiated in various awareness-episodes. When we\nsincerely say that some awareness-episode constitutes knowledge, we\nhave to be antecedently aware of knowledgehood as\ninstantiated in that awareness-episode. \nThen, the question will be: How do we determine whether an\nawareness-episode is an instance of knowledgehood? Even when the\nawareness-episode is our own, we cannot ascertain whether it is\nknowledge by introspection alone; for, even though we may be aware of\nan awareness-episode by introspection, we could still doubt or be\nmistaken as to whether it is knowledge. So, it seems that we can only\ndetermine whether an awareness-episode constitutes knowledge by means\nof inference on the basis of some kind of symptom. Are there\nmany such symptoms or one? If there is just one symptom distinct from\nknowledgehood, we should just treat that as the defining property of\nknowledge; so, defining knowledge in terms of knowledgehood makes no\nsense. But if there are many such symptoms, we need to say which ones\nthey are; for Śrīharṣa has already argued that the\nwidely accepted definitions of knowledge are inadequate and therefore\ncannot be reliable symptoms of knowledge. \nThe upshot is this. Anyone who defines knowledge in terms of\nknowledgehood and therefore abandons the project of defining knowledge\nin knowledge-independent terms cannot offer any satisfactory story\nabout how we in fact ascribe knowledgehood to various\nawareness-episodes. In the absence of such a story, there is no reason\nto think that there is a genuine property of knowledgehood that we are\ntracking through our practices of knowledge-attribution. Thus, the\nproject of defining knowledge in terms of knowledgehood fails. \nA significant part of The Sweets of Refutation is devoted to\nthe question of whether various items in the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika ontology can be satisfactorily\ndefined. In the Aphorisms on the Vaiśeṣika System\n(Vaiśeṣika-sūtra), Kaṇāda\n(2nd century CE) offered an ontological scheme that\nincluded six positive categories\n(bhāva-padārtha-s), namely, substance\n(dravya), quality (guṇa), action\n(karma), universal (sāmānya), ultimate\ndifferentiator (viśeṣa), and the relation of\ninherence (samavāya). In Of the Seven\nCategories (Saptapadārthī), the later\nVaiśeṣika philosopher Śivādityamiśra\n(12th century CE) added the negative category of absence\n(abhāva) to the list. This scheme of seven ontological\ncategories was adopted by Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers\nlike Udayana who combined this ontological scheme with the\nepistemological commitments of Nyāya. In the fourth chapter of\nThe Sweets of Refutation, Śrīharṣa sets\nhimself the task of dismantling this ontological scheme: he begins by\nattacking the notion of a positive category, and then attacks the\ndefinitions of substance, universal, ultimate differentiator,\nrelation, and absence. \nAlong the way, he focuses attention on two key items in the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika ontology: causation and\ndistinctness. Without these two items, the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher cannot defend the claim\nthat there is a plurality of things in the world that are distinct\nfrom consciousness or the self. Once causation is out of the picture,\nthe Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher cannot explain how our\nconscious awareness-episodes can be brought about by mind-independent\nobjects. Analogously, without distinctness, the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher cannot claim that we have\nany reason to believe that there is a plurality of objects in the\nworld. This section shall outline Śrīharṣa’s\ndiscussion of causation and distinctness. \nOn the standard picture that almost all classical Indian philosophers\nwork with, the relata of the causal relation are not just\nevents, but are rather things (which may include\nevents). When a lumberjack chops down a tree with his axe, the relata\nof the relevant causal relation are not the event of the\ntree’s falling (i.e., the effect) and the event of the\nlumberjack hitting the tree with his axe. Rather, the causal relation\nholds between the event of the tree’s falling (i.e.,\nthe effect) and a set of distinct entities, e.g., the axe, the\nlumberjack who wields the axe, the contact between the tree and the\naxe, etc. Call these causally relevant factors the causal\nconditions (kāraṇa) for the falling of the\ntree. \nIn the fourth chapter of The Sweets of Refutation,\nŚrīharṣa argues that the notion of a causal condition\ncannot be defined. This section takes a closer look at\nŚrīharṣa’s arguments against one definition of\ncausal conditions offered originally by Udayana in his Flower\nOfferings of Reason (Nyāyakusumāñjali)\nunder verses 1.13 and 1.19. \nAs Śrīharṣa notes (KKh 710), this definition can be\nfleshed out in at least two ways, depending on how we understand the\nexpression ‘invariably.’ Here is the first\ninterpretation. \nAn effect e is unconditionally preceded by a condition\nc if and only if there is no third condition c* such\nthat c is present only when c* is also present, but,\nsometimes e is produced without c* being present before it. In\nother words, a condition e is unconditionally preceded\nby a condition c if and only if whenever e is produced,\nc is present before\n it.[19] \nŚrīharṣa argues that this proposal falls prey to what\nwe may call the problem of spurious correlations. Take a\nscenario where an entity c and an effect e share a\ncommon cause, e.g., the first unclear symptoms of a disease and the\nlater more pronounced symptoms of it. Here, there is a common cause\nfor both sets of symptoms: the disease itself (or perhaps, the\nconditions that produce the disease). The first set of symptoms\naccompanies the second set unconditionally. There is no third\ncondition c* such that the first set of symptoms are produced\nonly if c* is present, but c* is sometimes absent from\ncases where the second set of symptoms is present. This makes the\nconnection between the two sets of symptoms unconditional, but that\ndoesn’t make the first set of symptoms causally relevant to the\nsecond. \nThe other interpretation of causation=invariable\nconjunction cashes out the expression ‘invariably’\nusing modal vocabulary.  \nAccording to Śrīharṣa, this definition doesn’t\nwork because it suffers from the problem of irrelevance (even\nthough the problem also seems to arise for the previous proposal). It\nwould predict that even intuitively causally irrelevant\nfactors which are necessarily present before the production of an\neffect are causally relevant to the production of that\neffect. For instance, it predicts that just as the threads that\nconstitute a cloth are causally relevant to the production of the\ncloth, so also is the color of those threads causally relevant to the\nproduction of the cloth, when it intuitively isn’t. \nIn order to care of problems of this kind, one might modify this\nproposal in the following manner (KKh 705). \nA proposal of this kind was possibly first defended by\nŚaśadhara (fl. 1125 CE), and became popular amongst later\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika\n philosophers.[21]Non-superfluity (ananyathāsiddhi) is defined\nas the property of not being established otherwise, i.e.,\nindependently of the effect (kāryād\nanyaprakāreṇa na siddhiḥ). causation=invariable\nconjunction ii* is supposed to\ntake care of the problem of irrelevance. The general thought\nis that factors that are intuitively causally irrelevant to an effect\nare established not on the basis of the effect, but on the basis of\nsomething else. For example, the color of the threads is established\non the basis of the threads themselves, and therefore established\nindependently of the effect. \nBut this move won’t work (KKh 705–706). There are two\nsalient ways of interpreting the definition of non-superfluity,\ndepending on how we understand the notion of\n“establishing” (siddhi). According to the first,\na non-superfluous condition is one which isn’t brought\nabout independently of the effect (kāryād\nanyaprakāreṇa na niṣpattiḥ). But clearly a\ncausal condition isn’t brought about by the effect; rather, it\nis the causal factor that contributes to the production of the effect!\nAccording to the second interpretation, a non-superfluous condition is\none which isn’t cognized independently of the effect\n(kāryād anyaprakāreṇa na\njñaptiḥ). But if this is correct, then our\ndefinition of causal relevance should predict that we always become\naware of causal conditions on the basis of their effects. That’s\njust not true. Sometimes, we infer the existence of rain-bearing\nclouds on the basis of rain, but at other times, we know it simply by\nlooking up at the sky. Setting aside these interpretations, one might\nclaim that a condition that is non-superfluous with respect to an\neffect is one which isn’t brought about or known in any way\nother than as a causal condition relevant to that effect. But\nthen the definition would be circular; for, now, in trying to define\nthe notion of a causal condition, we are appealing back to that very\nnotion. \nAs in the case of knowledge, Śrīharṣa is eventually\nled to consider the question of whether we should treat the property\nof causal relevance (kāraṇatva) as primitive.\nCould we define a causal condition as just that which possesses the\nproperty of causal relevance? Śrīharṣa says that this\nwould only be a reasonable strategy if there were some independent\nreason for thinking that there is such a property. But neither\nperception nor inference gives us any reason to believe this. Here,\nŚrīharṣa addresses an argument—offered by\nUdayana in The Flower Offering of Reason\n(Nyāyakusumāñjali) 1.5—for the claim\nthat the existence of causal conditions can be established by a form\nof inference. Udayana’s main premise is that any putative effect\nis an occasional (kādācitka) entity, i.e., an\nentity that only arises at certain times and not at others. In order\nto explain this occasionality, we need to posit a causal condition\nthat brings the putative effect into existence. If that were not the\ncase, then the production of the putative effect—its coming into\nexistence (bhavana)—wouldn’t depend on anything;\nthen, it would be produced all the time (Upādhyāya &\nŚāstri 1957: 51). \nŚrīharṣa offers two responses to this simple, yet\npowerful, argument. The first response takes issue with the notion of\nexplanation that Udayana invokes in his argument (KKh 715–716).\nŚrīharṣa subscribes to the following principle. \nThe intuitive motivation for this principle seems to be that we cannot\nexplain the property Y possessed by an entity e by\nappealing to a property X possessed by a completely distinct\nentity. For instance, in order to explain Devadatta’s obesity,\nwe shouldn’t appeal to the gluttony of some person other than\nDevadatta, but rather to Devadatta’s own overconsumption of\nfood. But Udayana is essentially trying to explain the occasionality\nof a putative effect by appealing to the property of causal\nrelevance that something else possesses. This violates the principle\nof explanation. \nNow, one might attempt to resolve this problem by pointing out that\njust as putative effects are occasional entities, i.e., they appear\nnow and then, so also are all their causal conditions occasional\nentities. So, causal relevance and occasionality can indeed be\nproperties of the same entity. Thus, there is no violation of the\nprinciple of explanation.\nŚrīharṣa shows that this leads to an infinite regress\nof explanations. To explain the occasionality of a putative effect, we\nappeal to another occasional entity, namely its causal condition. But\nthen in order to explain the occasionality of this causal condition,\nwe would have appeal to yet another causal condition, thus launching\nus on an explanatory regress. \nHowever, the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher might bite\nthe bullet on this challenge. She might say that not all cases of\nexplanatory regress are bad, so there is no harm in positing a\nbeginningless chain of causes and effects. In response,\nŚrīharṣa is happy to grant that not all explanatory\nregresses are vicious. But if an explanatory regress involving\noccasionality and causal relevance is to get off the ground, we would\nhave to cite at least one case where the occasionality of a putative\neffect e is in fact explained by the causal relevance of a\ndistinct entity c. The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika\nphilosopher is yet to show that; in fact, she is appealing to the\ninfinite explanatory regress in order to establish that claim. \nMoreover, even if one denies the principle of\nexplanation, there is second, much shorter, response to\nUdayana’s argument. In Udayana’s argument, the\noccasionality of the putative effect is the explanandum, while the\ncausal relevance of the causal condition is the explanans.\nŚrīharṣa asks whether there is a relation between\nthese two properties. If there is no relation, the explanandum could\nindeed obtain without the explanans. In that case, the explanation\nwouldn’t really work. If there is a relation,\nŚrīharṣa could offer another regress argument that\napplies to relations in general. The thought is this. Suppose there\nare two entities a and b such that whenever b\noccurs, a also occurs. So, there must be a relation R\nbetween a and b that explains this pattern of\nco-occurrence. The question is this: How is R related to\na and b? If we say that there is no further relation\nR* by which a or b is related to R, then,\nagain, we would be unable to explain the correlation between a\nand b. If we acknowledge that there is such a relation, we\ncould ask again how a or b is related to R*.\nThus, an infinite regress will be unavoidable. \nŚrīharṣa’s discussion of\ndistinctness—the property in virtue of which an object\nis recognized as distinct from another—is deeply connected with\nhis commitment to a form of non-dualism. In the first chapter of\nThe Sweets of Refutation, Śrīharṣa raises the\nquestion of how one knows that the self alone is ultimately real. The\nanswer is simple: the Upaniṣads—insofar as they literally\nproclaim that there is no plurality of objects in the\nworld—provide evidence for this claim. But this answer runs into\ntrouble pretty quickly: the Upaniṣads cannot be trusted with\nregard to their literal content, since that content is contradicted by\nthe deliverances of perception. The world, as we see it, is populated\nby a plurality of objects (KKh 74). It is this objection that\nmotivates Śrīharṣa to argue against the ultimate\nreality of distinctness of\n objects.[22] \nŚrīharṣa offers several arguments against\ndistinctness, the first and the most important of which appears in the\nfirst chapter of the Sweets of Refutation (for a more\nelaborate treatment discussion, see Phillips 1995: 103–110).\nŚrīharṣa claims that distinctness of one object from\nanother must either be (a) the very nature of the object\n(svarūpa), (b) mutual absence\n(anyonyābhāva), (c) difference in properties\n(vaidharmya), and (d) something else, like separateness\n(pṛthaktva). Proposals (a), (b) and (c) are accepted by\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers such as Udayana\n(Śāstrī 1940: 255), and (d) is accepted by\nBhāsarvajña (Yogīndrānanda 1968: 160) and Bhāṭṭa\nMīmāṃsakas (Kunhan Raja & Sastri 1933: 242).\nŚrīharṣa’s contention is this: Irrespective of\nhow we define distinctness, no awareness—perceptual or\notherwise—can present one object as distinct from another,\nwithout also presenting them as non-distinct (KKh 96–110). This,\nin turn, shows that even perceptual awareness of distinctness cannot\ncontradict the Upanisadic testimony about non-distinctness of all\nobjects. \nConsider, for instance, proposal (a): namely, the distinctness of an\nentity x from an entity y is just the nature of\nx. Now, note that the distinctness of an entity x from\nan entity y is a relational property of x,\ni.e., x has that property only in virtue of being related in\nsome way to y. But this relational property is constituted by\ny. So, if this relational property is the very nature of\nx, then y constitutes the very nature of x. By\nsimilar reasoning, if y is distinct from x, and this\ndistinctness is a relational property of y, then x\nconstitutes the very nature of y. For any two entities x\nand y, if x constitutes the very nature of y and\ny constitutes the very nature of x, then they are\nidentical. Thus, Śrīharṣa arrives at his desired\nconclusion: a perceptual awareness of the difference of a cloth from a\npot, would also reveal that the pot and the cloth are in fact\nidentical. \nNow, take proposal (b): namely, that distinctness consists in mutual\nexclusion. In treating distinctness as mutual exclusion,\nŚrīharṣa’s opponent essentially has said that to\nascribe to an entity x the distinctness from y is to\nascribe to x an absence of the property of being identical to\ny. But this raises a problem for his\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika opponent: by the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher’s own doctrine, the\ncounter-positive (pratiyogin) of an\nabsence—the entity that an absence is an absence\nof—must be ultimately real. For instance, according to the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher, it makes no sense to say\nthat there is an absence of turtle-fur on the ground (since turtles\ndon’t really have fur), but it does make sense to say that a\nturtle doesn’t have fur (since fur in fact does exist). So, if a\ncloth is to be characterized by the absence of the property of being\nidentical to a pot, the cloth’s identity with the pot must be\nultimately real. Once again, Śrīharṣa gets what he\nwanted: a perceptual awareness of the distinctness of a cloth from a\npot would also reveal the identity between the pot and the cloth. \nA similar result can be obtained for proposal (c) by means of a\nregress argument. According to proposal (c), distinctness consists in\na difference in properties. If the distinctness of the pot from the\ncloth is a matter of their having different sets of properties, then\nwe must ask what it is in virtue of which the relevant properties are\nrecognized as distinct. If it’s because the properties have\ndifferent sets of higher-order properties, then we will be launched on\na regress; for we can raise the same question with respect to these\nproperties. In order to stop the regress, if we say that some of the\ndistinguishing higher-order properties needn’t themselves have\ndistinguishing higher-order properties, then we would end up with the\nresult that the entities lower down in the hierarchy cannot be really\nbe recognized as distinct. So, the pot and the cloth will be presented\nin awareness as non-distinct or identical. \nThe same line of reasoning will also apply to proposal (d), which\nclaims that distinctness is a matter of possessing a property like\nseparateness. If the pot is distinct from the cloth in virtue of\npossessing the property of cloth-separateness, and the cloth is\ndistinct from the pot in virtue of possessing the property of\npot-separateness, then we may ask what is it in virtue of which\npot-separateness and cloth-separateness are distinct properties. This\nwill launch us on a regress. In order to block it, we would have to\naccept that the relevant separateness-properties are not really\ndistinct; so, the cloth and the pot will turn out to be identical.\nThat’s exactly what Śrīharṣa wants. \nŚrīharṣa is eager to point out that he is not\nskeptical of all commonsense ontological categories (KKh 62–63).\nConsciousness, for him, is ultimately real; only the world,\ninsofar as it appears distinct from consciousness, isn’t. What\nreason do we have for treating consciousness as ultimately real?\nŚrīharṣa answers this question by defending a positive\nproposal about self-knowledge and intentionality. This section\ndiscusses that proposal.  \nŚrīharṣa’s view, in a nutshell, is this. All\nconscious mental occurrences are self-intimating: when\nsomeone is undergoing a conscious mental occurrence, that very mental\noccurrence constitutes a veridical awareness of itself. Therefore, an\nagent needs nothing other than a conscious mental occurrence in order\nto know consciousness is ultimately real. In this respect,\nŚrīharṣa endorses a form of reflexivism, a\nview commonly associated with the Yogācāra school of Indian\nBuddhism, on which conscious mental states are reflexively aware of\nthemselves (Ganeri 1995, 2012; Williams 1998; Yao 2005; Arnold 2005;\nGarfield 2006; MacKenzie 2007, 2008; Thompson 2011; Kellner 2011;\nCoseru 2012: Ch. 8). \nŚrīharṣa opens his defense of reflexivism with the\nfollowing argument (KKh 41–42). Whenever a person undergoes a\nconscious mental occurrence, she neither doubts whether she is\nundergoing that mental occurrence, nor does she mistake that mental\noccurrence for a different one, nor does she become sure of its\nabsence. So, the agent must have a veridical awareness that the\nrelevant mental occurrence exists. Now, suppose conscious mental\noccurrences don’t constitute an awareness of themselves. Hence,\nan agent can only become awareness of such conscious mental\noccurrences by some other means, e.g., on the basis of some episode of\nhigher-order awareness. If this were the case, then it would be\npossible for the first-order conscious mental occurrence to be present\nwithout there being any higher-order awareness of it. But then the\nagent could doubt or be mistaken about whether she is undergoing the\nrelevant conscious mental occurrence. In order to block this\nconclusion, therefore, we must accept the conclusion that conscious\nmental occurrences constitute a veridical awareness of their own\nexistence. An agent needs nothing further in order to know that such\noccurrences are ultimately real. \nHowever, this argument doesn’t seem great. The\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher, who thinks that our\nawareness of our conscious mental occurrences always involves an\nepisode of introspective higher-order awareness, could offer a\ndifferent explanation of why we cannot doubt or be wrong about whether\nwe are undergoing certain conscious mental occurrences. She could say\nthat whenever an agent is in a conscious mental state, there is a\nveridical higher-order awareness-episode in virtue of which the agent\nis aware that she is undergoing the relevant mental occurrence. \nŚrīharṣa responds to this objection with a regress\nargument. Suppose an agent is undergoing a conscious mental\noccurrence. Ordinarily, when we are aware of a conscious mental\noccurrence, we are also aware that we are aware of it, we are aware\nthat we are aware that we are aware of it, and so on. Since the\n“higher-order awareness” (henceforth, HOA) theorist\nexplains such awareness of one’s own mental occurrences by\nappealing to episodes of higher-order awareness, she faces a choice:\neither she should posit an infinite hierarchy of such episodes of\nhigher-order awareness, or she shouldn’t. If she takes the\nsecond route, she would have to say that for any conscious mental\noccurrence, an agent is aware of that conscious mental occurrence, and\naware that she is aware of that mental occurrence, and aware that she\nis aware that she is aware of that mental occurrence,…, and so\non, until she reaches some higher-order awareness-episode which isn't\nthe object of any further higher-order awareness-episode. But if that\nis the case, the agent can indeed doubt whether that final\nhigher-order awareness-episode exists. On that basis, she can doubt\nthe existence of the higher-order awareness-episode that the final\nhigher-order awareness-episode has as its object, and so on. In this\nway, the agent can indeed come to doubt whether she is undergoing to\nthe relevant conscious mental occurrence. Therefore, the HOA theorist\nmust posit an infinite hierarchy of higher-order awareness episodes.\nBut then there will be a regress. So, the HOA awareness theorist\ncannot really explain why conscious mental occurrences are immune to\ndoubt (KKh 43). \nThis regress argument isn’t airtight either: the HOA theorist\nmight just reject the premise that conscious mental occurrences are\nnot subject to doubt or error. She might just be comfortable with the\nclaim that sometimes, even though we are undergoing a certain\nconscious mental occurrence, we are not aware that we are undergoing\nthat conscious mental occurrence. Śrīharṣa thinks that\nthis move will be difficult to pull off. \nIn response, Śrīharṣa offers an argument that starts\nout from the following principle: \nThe awareness-existence principle is a\nprinciple about rationality: it says that a rational\n(prāmāṇika) agent—i.e., someone who\ndoesn’t overstep the bounds of her evidence\n(pramāṇa)—cannot be sure that the object of\nher awareness exists if she is not aware of her own awareness. This is\nbecause in order to ascertain the existence of the object of her\nawareness, the rational agent will have to cite evidence for the\nexistence of that object. But in the absence of any awareness of her\nawareness, she won’t be able to appeal to her own awareness as\nevidence for the existence of the object. As a result, she won’t\nbe able to ascertain that the relevant object exists. \nŚrīharṣa’s final argument is this (KKh\n45–46). It is uncontroversial that even in rational agents,\nconscious awareness-episodes can be action-guiding: a\nrational agent’s conscious awareness of an object is capable of\nmaking her engage in physical and linguistic behavior under the\npresupposition that the relevant object exists. For instance, a\nrational agent’s perceptual experience as of there being a chair\nbefore her could motivate her to perform certain chair-related\nlinguistic and physical acts, e.g., saying, “That’s a\nchair!”, or trying to grab the chair and sit on it. However, if\nthe agent weren’t aware of her experience as of there being a\nchair before her, then, by the awareness-existence\nprinciple, she couldn’t ascertain that there is a chair\nbefore her. And if she couldn’t ascertain the existence of the\nchair, the relevant patterns of physical and linguistic behavior\nwouldn’t arise. The upshot is that if object-directed conscious\nawareness-episodes, e.g., perceptual experiences, are to be\naction-guiding in the case of rational agents, rational agents must be\naware of such mental occurrences whenever they take place.  \nBut now, if this awareness of awareness is an episode of higher-order\nawareness (as the HOA theorist intends it to be), then there will be a\nregress (KKh 45–46). Unless the HOA theorist posits an infinite\nhierarchy of awareness-episodes, by the awareness-existence\nprinciple, no rational agent\nwill be able to ascertain the existence of her initial\nawareness-episode, and therefore also won’t be able to ascertain\nthe existence of its object. Since that’s bad, the HOA theorist\nhas to accept the conclusion that at least all object-directed\nconscious awareness-episodes of rational agents involve awareness of\nthemselves. But if the HOA theorist is comfortable with this\nconclusion, it might just be better for her to accept the more general\nthesis that all awareness-episodes (or even conscious mental\noccurrences) involve awareness of themselves. \nŚrīharṣa’s reflexivism poses a challenge: How\ncan a conscious mental occurrence constitute awareness of itself?\nAccording to a simple notion of intentionality, the object of an\nawareness-episode is always distinct from the awareness-episode. But\nif this view is correct, then conscious mental occurrences cannot be\nself-intimating. For if conscious mental occurrences were\nself-intimating, then awareness-episodes wouldn’t be distinct\nfrom their own objects. \nŚrīharṣa replies to this worry with a regress argument\nthat is similar to F. H. Bradley’s argument against external\nrelations (Bradley 1893: ch. II): \nThe relation between an object and its awareness cannot be distinct\nfrom the nature of its relata. If it were distinct, then, on pain of\nregress, one would have to accept that the relation between the first\nrelation and its relata is in the end identical to its own loci [i.e.,\nits relata]. If this is right, one would have to accept that the\nawareness of this second relation arises without any awareness of a\ndistinction between the relata and the relevant relation; for a\nrelation that is identical to its own loci oversteps the limitations\nof other relations. Analogously, the relation between an object and\nits awareness obtains even in the absence of any distinction between\nits relata, and the awareness of that relation also arises without any\nawareness of the relevant distinction. Where is the inconsistency?\n(KKh 56–57) \nHere is the idea. Suppose an object a is\nR1-related to an object b which is distinct\nfrom a. Let us suppose that R1 is distinct\nfrom both a and b. If R1 is distinct\nfrom a and b, then R1 itself would\nsomehow have to be related to a and b. But then we would\nhave to posit another relation, R2, thus launching\nourselves on an infinite regress. The only way to escape this regress\nwould be to say that there is some relation Ri which\nis not distinct from its relata. But there is no reason to think that\nthis relation isn’t R1 itself. So, for any\nrelation R, we may conclude that it isn’t distinct from\nits relata. So, the aboutness relation\n(viṣaya-viṣayi-bhāva) that connects an\nobject with its awareness also cannot be distinct from its relata. If\nthe object is identical to the aboutness relation that connects it to\nits awareness, and the aboutness relation is identical to the\nawareness, then the object must also be identical to its\nawareness. \nHowever, the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher has a stock\nresponse to the regress argument Śrīharṣa uses to\nmotivate his view: it is to posit a self-linking relation\n(svarūpa-sambandha). The underlying thought is that\nsometimes, when one entity a is related to another entity\nb, this state of affairs isn’t decomposable into three\nelements which are distinct from each other, i.e., a, b,\nand a relation R that is distinct from both a and\nb. Rather, the relation R may just be non-distinct from\neither a or b. Yet, since it connects a or\nb to something else, it still remains a relation; it is thus a\nself-linking relation. This will block the regress argument\nthat Śrīharṣa wishes to run. In The Discrimination\nof the Truth about the Self (Ātmatattvaviveka),\nUdayana endorses a view of this kind (Śāstri 1940: 224). \nThe underlying thought is that the aboutness relation is a\nself-linking relation: it is the particular nature that an\nawareness-episode e possesses, namely, its nature of being an\nawareness of the relevant object o. \nŚrīharṣa’s main objection against this\ndefinition of aboutness involves a threat of idealism\n(vijñānavāda) (KKh 650ff). He points out\nthat the property of being-of-that-ness that Udayana speaks\nof is decomposable into two elements: the part picked out by the\nexpression ‘that’, namely the object of awareness\no, and the part picked out by “being of”, which\ncorresponds to the relation R by which the awareness-episode is\nrelated to the object. If both these elements are part of the nature\nof the awareness-episode—the definition claims—then the\nobject o wouldn’t be external to the awareness-episode\ne. The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika view, therefore, would\ncollapse into idealism! \nPerhaps, the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher could claim\nthat it is not the object o that is the part of the\nawareness-episode’s nature, but only the relation R. This\ndoesn’t satisfy Śrīharṣa. He points out that\nsince R could be a relation with multiple instances and\ntherefore could hold between a different awareness-episode e*\nand a different object o*, the fact that R is part of\nthe nature of e wouldn’t explain why it constitutes an\nawareness of o. Perhaps, we could say that R also\npossesses a certain being-of-that-ness in virtue of which it\nis merely a relation between o and the awareness-episode\ne. This proposal, as Śrīharṣa seems to suggest,\ntries to explain the being-of-that-ness that the\nawareness-episode possesses, by positing another kind of\nbeing-that-ness in the relation R that connects the\nawareness-episode e with its object o. Quite predictably,\ntherefore, Śrīharṣa asks whether this second variety\nof being-of-that-ness is part of the nature of the relation R,\nor external to it. \nIf this being-of-that-ness is part of the nature of R, a line\nof reasoning similar to the one that led to the worry about idealism\ncould be run again. If the being-of-that-ness is part of the\nnature of the relation, then, since ‘that’ refers to the\nobject here, the object too should be part of R’s nature.\nAnd since R is part of the nature of the awareness-episode\ne, the object o too should be part of the nature of\ne. Thus, the threat of idealism will arise again! (Moreover, if\nwe say that o is not part of the nature of the relation\nR, but only some further relation R* is, then the same\nmove could be made again, thus launching us on an infinite\nregress). \nBut suppose this being-of-that-ness that R has is\nexternal to R. What is that property? It cannot be anything\ndistinct from (the nature of) the object of awareness o; if it\nwere, then another regress argument could be run. So, let’s\nsuppose this being-of-that-ness which R has is identical to\no. The question, again, is this: How is this being-of-that-ness\nrelated to R? If it is not related by a self-linking relation,\nan infinite regress will be unavoidable. If it is related by a\nself-linking relation, then the object o will be part of the\nnature of R, which in turn is part of the nature of the\nawareness-episode e. Thus, the problem of idealism will arise\nagain. \nMore generally, Śrīharṣa’s view is that there\nare no cases where the aboutness relation connects distinct objects.\nFor him, ordinary aboutness relations that seem to connect distinct\nobjects, e.g., the pot and its awareness, are ultimately unreal. What\nreally exists is the self-intimating consciousness. So, there is\nnothing wrong with treating the relata of the aboutness relation as\nidentical in every case. \nŚrīharṣa offers his refutation-arguments with the aim\nof undermining the dualistic ontology accepted by\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. However, these arguments\nalso serve another aim, which he gestures at, and which seems to drive\nmany of the arguments in The Sweets of Refutation. It is to\nshow that rational inquiry into the nature of reality—i.e.,\ninquiry that proceeds through the exchange of arguments directed\ntowards settling some question—is in fact futile. \nLet us grant that Śrīharṣa’s\nrefutation-arguments are in fact successful in undermining the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika project of defending a dualistic\nontology on which the world is populated by things that are distinct\nfrom the self or consciousness. Can Śrīharṣa himself\ndefend the kind of non-dualism that he endorses? Somewhat\nsurprisingly, Śrīharṣa argues that inquiry into the\nquestion of non-duality—the question of whether only the self or\nconsciousness is ultimately real—is futile. His argument is a\nversion of Meno’s paradox (Carpenter & Ganeri\n 2010).[24]\n He imagines an opponent who asks, “What is the method of\nknowing non-duality, i.e., the non-distinctness of everything from the\nself?” The response is this: when asked by someone who rejects\nthe doctrine of non-duality, this question doesn’t make sense\n(KKh 69–73). The argument takes the form of a dilemma: either\nthe opponent is aware of what non-duality is, or she is not. \nFocus on the second horn. If the opponent is not aware of non-duality,\nit will be impossible for her to perform the very speech act of asking\nthe question that she in fact has asked. This is because,\nŚrīharṣa claims, the following principle holds:  \nAny speech act must be produced by an awareness-episode such that if\nthe speech act is about an object o, the awareness-episode is\nalso about that object o. (KKh 70)  \nBut if the opponent isn’t aware of non-duality, she\ncouldn’t perform a speech act on the basis of an awareness of\nnon-duality. So, she couldn’t ask the relevant question at\nall. \nNow, focus on the first horn. The question is this: If the opponent is\naware of non-duality, does her awareness-episode constitute knowledge\nor not? If it does constitute knowledge, then the method by which that\nknowledge arises is the means of knowing non-duality. So, asking the\nquestion is futile. Now, an opponent might argue,  \nYes, we have established in general that there is some way of\nknowing non-duality. But, given that there is a lot of disagreement,\nwe haven’t quite pinned down precisely which means of knowing\nwould allow us to know non-duality. So, the task of the inquirer is to\nsettle that question.  \nŚrīharṣa’s reply is that this is a useless\nexercise. If we have already demonstrated in general that non-duality\ncan be known, then that by itself entails that there is a particular\nmethod of knowing non-duality. In order to know what it is, we can\neither pick the best one amongst the already well-known methods of\nknowing, or posit a new one. \nBut now suppose the opponent says that her awareness of non-duality in\nfact doesn’t constitute knowledge. But surely, says\nŚrīharṣa, if non-duality isn’t an object of\nknowledge, then how could there be a method of knowing non-duality? Of\ncourse, the opponent could clarify her position by saying that she is\njust committed to treating her own awareness of non-duality as a case\nof non-knowledge, not her interlocutor’s. Since her\ninterlocutor—i.e., Śrīharṣa—is committed\nto thinking that non-duality can be known, she can indeed legitimately\nask what means of knowing gives rise to the knowledge of\nnon-duality. \nŚrīharṣa’s reply is subtle: even though he is\ncommitted to the doctrine of non-duality, Śrīharṣa\ndenies that the burden is upon him to show that the method by which\none becomes aware of non-duality is in fact a means of knowing. This\nis because, sometimes, an agent can become aware of the truth even by\nmeans of a procedure that doesn’t yield knowledge, and\ntherefore, doesn’t count as a means of knowing. For\ninstance, in Mist, the agent correctly infers the presence of\nfire on a mountain after mistaking mist for smoke. For some defenders\nof Advaita Vedānta, such as Maṇḍana Miśra\n(8th century CE), there is at least a structural similarity\nbetween cases of this kind and the case where an agent becomes aware\nof the non-distinctness of the world from the self on the basis of\nexperience of hearing Upanisadic sentences that proclaim that\nnon-duality (Kuppuswami Sastri 1984: 41; Thrasher 1993: ch. V; Ganeri\n2007: ch. 5). As in Mist, in this case too, the agent moves\nfrom error to truth; for the experience of hearing Upaniṣadic\nsentences is laden with the differences amongst the hearer, the\nhearing, and that which is heard. Śrīharṣa seems to\nsuggest here that the defender of non-dualism—committed as she\nmay be to the claim that there is nothing in the world that is\ndistinct from the self—needn’t have to cite a method of\nknowing that will produce the knowledge of that truth. \nIn the last assessment, Śrīharṣa is happy to concede\nthat the Upaniṣads—which literally proclaim that\neverything is non-distinct from the Brahman or the self—are the\nmeans of knowing non-duality. However, Śrīharṣa thinks\nthat one cannot call Upanisadic testimony into question by appealing\nto perceptual evidence. The ordinary perceptual awareness of\nplurality, as we have already seen in\n Section 3.2,\n is incapable of defeating the awareness of non-duality that is\ngenerated by Upanisadic testimony. Neither can inference of any kind\ndefeat that awareness of non-duality. For Śrīharṣa,\nthis just shows that one cannot inquire further into the truth or the\nfalsity of the doctrine of non-duality on the basis of evidence that\nis independent of Upanisadic testimony. As he puts it,  \nthat awareness of non-duality [produced by the Upanisadic sentences]\ncannot be refuted by the wise even by means of a hundred arguments\n(tarka). (KKh 118) \nHis advice to the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher\ntherefore is to withdraw from the project of inquiry and rather to\nadopt an attitude of faith (śraddhā) towards the\ncontent of the Upanisadic sentences. \nYou, who are fond of reveling in ignorance, ought to have faith in the\ndoctrine of non-duality, presented to you by these arguments which, by\nyour own lights, have the features of good reasoning. Consequently,\nyour faith in the content of the Upaniṣads will induce in you a\ndesire to know the self. Slowly, as your consciousness is freed from\nordinary mental states, you yourself shall become acquainted with the\nultimate truth, to which reflexive self-knowledge bears witness, and\nwhich is sweeter than honey. (KKh 120) \nThis passage is suggestive: it reveals that for\nŚrīharṣa, rational inquiry—unconstrained by\nfaith in scripture—cannot be a guide to the truth. The professed\ngoal of the Nyāya system was to lay down a system of rational\ninquiry which, irrespective of the domain of inquiry, would allow one\nto progress towards to the truth in that domain. But\nŚrīharṣa thinks this is impossible. On the one hand,\nhis refutation-arguments are supposed to illustrate that such systems\nof rational inquiry are self-undermining: their own rules can be used\nto undermine the fundamental ontological and epistemological\ncategories that these systems rely on. On the one hand,\nŚrīharṣa wants to show that we cannot even engage in\ninquiry in good faith, and that arguments presented in the course of\nsuch inquiry—framed independently of scriptural\ntestimony—cannot have any defeating force against scriptural\ntestimony. The best way of making progress towards the truth is to\nhave faith in scripture, and let reason occupy a secondary place. \nThis attitude towards reason is something that\nŚrīharṣa shares with some other classical Indian\nthinkers (Murty 1959: pt. II ch. IV; Halbfass 1983: ch. II). In Of\nSentences and Words (Vākyapadīya),\nBhartṛhari claims that reason, without the guidance of\nscripture, is unreliable:  \nAs in the case of the blind man who, guided solely by the touch of his\nhand, rushes down an uneven path, it is not rare for a person who\nrelies primarily on reason to fall. (Subramania Aiyer 1976: 1.42)  \nBut why is reason unreliable? The only clear argument that\nBhartṛhari offers is an argument from instability: even\nif one presents a skillfully prepared argument in favor of a view, the\nconclusion of the argument can always be undercut or rebutted; for it\nis possible that someone else who is more skilled at argumentation\nmight explain the matter differently (Ibid., 1.34). Śaṃkara\nalludes to Bhartṛhari’s argument while commenting on\nAphorisms on Brahman 2.1.11:  \nRegarding matters that can be known from scripture, claims are not to\nbe established by reasoning. This is because reasoning—when\nuninformed by scripture and based only on human\nimagination—lacks stability; for such imagination is\nunconstrained. Moreover, even when experts prepare arguments by\nemploying imagination with care, such arguments may appear unsound to\nothers who have greater expertise. Given that arguments imagined up by\nsomeone may later appear unsound to another, arguments cannot acquire\nany stability due to human disagreement. (Shastri 1980: 366–367)\n \nOwing to this instability, reason alone cannot decisively establish\nanything; only reason informed by scripture\n(śrutyanugṛhīta-tarka) can (1980: 361). \nOn at least one way of reading The Sweets of Refutation,\nŚrīharṣa’s project is just to illustrate the\ninstability of reason: for any argument the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher may offer for their\nfavorite ontological and epistemological categories, there is a\nrefutation-argument that defeats it. The deliverances of\nreason—thus never immune to rational defeat—can only\nconstitute inconclusive evidence. The important difference between\nSaṃkara and Śrīharṣa, however, lies in this. For\nSaṃkara, even on matters that are established by scripture,\nthere is some room for inquiry, and reason informed by scripture can\nindeed help the inquirer understand the nature of ultimate reality. By\ncontrast, Śrīharṣa takes his refutation-arguments to\nshow that rational inquiry—whether or not informed by\nscripture—establishes nothing; faith alone can take us to the\ntruth. Rational inquiry, for Śrīharṣa, is futile.","contact.mail":"nilanj.das@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
