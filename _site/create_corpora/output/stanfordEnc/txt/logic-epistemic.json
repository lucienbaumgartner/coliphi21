Though any logic\nwith an epistemic interpretation may be called an epistemic\nlogic, the most widespread type of epistemic logics in use at\npresent are modal logics. Knowledge and belief are represented via the\nmodal operators K and B, often with a subscript\nindicating the agent that holds the attitude. Formulas\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) and \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) are then read “agent\na knows that phi” and “agent a believes that\nphi”, respectively. Epistemic logic allows the formal\nexploration of the implications of epistemic principles. For example,\nthe formula \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) states that what is\nknown is true, while \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\)\nstates that what is known is known to be known. The semantics of\nepistemic logic are typically given in terms of possible worlds\nvia Kripke models such that the formula \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is\nread to assert that \\(\\varphi\\) is true in all worlds agent a\nconsiders epistemically possible relative to its current information.\nThe central problems that have concerned epistemic logicians include,\nfor example, determining which epistemic principles are most\nappropriate for characterizing knowledge and belief, the logical\nrelations between different conceptions of knowledge and belief, and\nthe epistemic features of groups of agents. Beyond philosophy proper,\nepistemic logic flourishes in theoretical computer science, economics,\nand related fields.\n\nAristotelian texts set the groundwork for discussions of the logic of\nknowledge and belief, particularly De Sophisiticis Elenchis\nas well as the Prior and Posterior Analytics. While\nAristotle addressed the four alethic modes of possibility, necessity,\nimpossibility, and contingency, Buridan, Pseudo Scotus, Ockham, and\nRalph Strode, helped to extend Aristotle’s insights to epistemic\nthemes and problems (Boh 1993; Knuuttila 1993). During this period,\nthe Pseudo-Scot and William of Ockham supplemented Aristotle’s\nstudy of mental acts of cognition and volition (see Boh 1993: 130).\nIvan Boh’s studies of the history of fourteenth and fifteenth\ncentury investigations into epistemic logic provide a excellent\ncoverage of the topic, especially his Epistemic Logic in the Later\nMiddle Ages (1993). \nAccording to Boh, the English philosopher Ralph Strode formulated a\nfully general system of propositional epistemic rules in his\ninfluential 1387 book Consequences (Boh 1993: 135).\nStrode’s presentation built on the earlier logical treatises of\nOckham and Burley. Problems of epistemic logic were also discussed\nbetween the 1330s and 1360s by the so-called Oxford Calculators, most\nprominently by William Heytesbury and Richard Kilvington. By the\nfifteenth century, Paul of Venice and other Italian philosophers also\nengaged in sophisticated reflection on the relationship between\nknowledge, truth, and ontology. \nDiscussions of epistemic logic during the medieval period share a\nsimilar set of foundational assumptions with contemporary discussions.\nMost importantly, medieval philosophers explored the connection\nbetween knowledge and veracity: If I know p, then p is\ntrue. Furthermore, many medieval discussions begin with an assumption\nsimilar to G.E. Moore’s observation that an epistemic agent\ncannot coherently assert “p but I do not believe (know)\np”. Sentences of this form are generally referred to as\nMoore sentences. \nModern treatments of the logic of knowledge and belief grew out of the\nwork of philosophers and logicians writing from 1948 through the\n1950s. Rudolf Carnap, Jerzy Łoś, Arthur Prior, Nicholas\nRescher, G.H. von Wright and others recognized that our discourse\nconcerning knowledge and belief admits of an axiomatic-deductive\ntreatment. Among the many important papers that appeared in the 1950s,\nvon Wright’s seminal work (1951) is widely acknowledged as\nhaving initiated the formal study of epistemic logic as we know it\ntoday. Von Wright’s insights were extended by Jaakko Hintikka in\nhis book Knowledge and Belief: An Introduction to the Logic of the\nTwo Notions (1962). Hintikka provided a way of interpreting\nepistemic concepts in terms of possible world semantics and as such it\nhas served as the foundational text for the study of epistemic logic\never since. \nIn the 1980s and 1990s, epistemic logicians focused on the logical\nproperties of systems containing groups of knowers and later still on\nthe epistemic features of so-called “multi-modal”\ncontexts. Since the 1990s work in\n dynamic epistemic logic\n has extended traditional epistemic logic by modeling the dynamic\nprocess of knowledge acquisition and belief revision.\n In the past two decades, epistemic logic has come to\ncomprise a broad set of formal approaches to the interdisciplinary\nstudy of knowledge and belief. \nInterest in epistemic logic extends well beyond philosophers. Recent\ndecades have seen a great deal of interdisciplinary attention to\nepistemic logic with economists and computer scientists actively\ndeveloping the field together with logicians and philosophers. In 1995\ntwo important books signaled the fertile interplay between computer\nscience and epistemic logic: Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi (1995)\nand Meyer and van der Hoek (1995). Work by computer scientists has\nbecome increasingly central to epistemic logic in the intervening\nyears. \nAmong philosophers, there is increased attention to the interplay\nbetween these formal approaches and traditional epistemological\nproblems (See for example, van Benthem 2006; Hendricks & Symons\n2006; Stalnaker 2006; Holliday 2018). \nSeveral introductory texts on epistemic logic exist, e.g., van Benthem\n(2011); Ditmarsch, Hoek, and Kooi (2007); Ditmarsch et al. (2015);\nGochet and Gribomont (2006); and Meyer (2001) with Lenzen (1980)\nproviding an overview of early developments. \nUntil relatively recently, epistemic logic focused almost exclusively\non propositional knowledge. In cases of propositional knowledge, an\nagent or a group of agents bears the propositional attitude of knowing\ntowards some proposition. For example, when one says: “Zoe knows\nthat there is a hen in the yard”, one asserts that Zoe is the\nagent who bears the propositional attitude knowing towards\nthe proposition expressed by the English sentence “there is a\nhen in the yard”. Now imagine that Zoe does not know whether\nthere is a hen in the yard. For example, it might be the case that she\nhas no access to information about whether there is or is not a hen in\nthe yard. In this case her lack of information means that she will\nconsider two scenarios as being possible, one in which there is a hen\nin the yard and one in which there is not. \nPerhaps she has some practical decision that involves not only hens\nbut also the presence of frightening dogs in the yard. She might wish\nto feed the hens but will only do so if there is no dog in the yard.\nIf she were ignorant of whether there is a dog in the yard, the number\nof scenarios she must consider in her deliberations grows to four.\nClearly, one needs to consider epistemic alternatives when one does\nnot have complete information concerning the situations that are\nrelevant to one’s decisions. As we shall see below, possible\nworlds semantics has provided a useful framework for understanding the\nmanner in which agents can reason about epistemic alternatives. \nWhile epistemic logicians had traditionally focused on knowing\nthat, one finds a range of other uses of knowledge in natural\nlanguage. As Wang (2015) points out, the expressions knowing\nhow, knowing what, knowing why are very common,\nappearing almost just as frequently (sometimes more frequently) in\nspoken and written language as knowing that. Recently\nnon-standard epistemic logics of such expressions have been developed,\nthough knowing who constructions are present in\nHintikka’s Knowledge and Belief (1962; see also\nBoër & Lycan 1986; Rendsvig 2012). Thus, beyond propositional\nknowledge, epistemic logic also suggests ways to systematize the logic\nof questions and answers (Brendan knows why the dog barked). It also\nprovides insight into the relationships between multiple modes of\nidentification (Zoe knows that this man is the president). Here, the\nagent can be said to know a fact relating multiple modes of\nidentification insofar as she correctly identifies the president, who\nshe might know from stories in the newspaper with the man she sees\nstanding in front of her, who she identifies as an object in her\nvisual field (Hintikka & Symons 2003). Epistemic logic may also\nprovide insight into questions of procedural “know-how”\n(Brendan knows how to change a fuse). For example, knowing how to\n\\(\\varphi\\) can be understood to be equivalent to the claim that there\nexists a way such that an agent knows that it is a way to ensure that\n\\(\\varphi\\) (see Wang 2015, 2018). Work concerning the justifications\nof knowledge have also been undertaken by combinations of\njustification logic with epistemic logic (see, e.g., Artemov\n& Nogina 2005; Renne 2008). There is ongoing work on these and\nother topics, and new developments are appearing steadily. \nRecent work in epistemic logic relies on a modal conception of\nknowledge. In order to be clear about the role of modality in\nepistemic logic it is helpful to introduce the basic elements of the\nmodern formalism. For the sake of simplicity we begin with the case of\nknowledge and belief for a single agent, postponing consideration of\nmultiple agents to\n Section 3, \nA prototypical epistemic logic language is given by first fixing a set\nof propositional variables \\(p_{1}\\), \\(p_{2}\\),…. In\napplications of epistemic logic, propositional variables are given\nspecific interpretations: For example, \\(p_{1}\\) could be taken to\nrepresent the proposition “there is a hen in the yard” and\n\\(p_{2}\\) the proposition “there is a dog in the yard”,\netc. The propositional variables represent propositions which are\nrepresented in no finer detail in the formal language. As such, they\nare therefore often referred to as atomic propositions or\nsimply atoms. Let Atom denote the set of atomic\npropositions. \nApart from the atomic propositions, epistemic logic supplements the\nlanguage of propositional logic with a modal operator, \\(K_{a}\\), for\nknowledge and \\(B_{a}\\), for belief. \n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) reads “Agent a knows that\n\\(\\varphi\\)” \nand similarly \n\\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) reads “Agent a believes that\n\\(\\varphi\\)”. \nIn many recent publications on epistemic logic, the full set of\nformulas in the language is given using a so-called Backus-Naur\nForm (BNF). This is simply a notational technique derived from\ncomputer science that provides a recursive definition of the formulas\ndeemed grammatically “correct”, i.e., the set\nof well-formed formulas: \nIt should noted that the Greek letter \\(\\varphi\\) stands for\nthe syntactic category of formula. So this definition says:\nan atom p is a formula; \\(\\neg\\varphi\\) is a formula if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a formula (read \\(\\neg\\) as ‘it is not the case\nthat’); \\((\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\) is a formula whenever any two\nformulas are connected by the \\(\\wedge\\) symbol (read \\(\\wedge\\) as\n‘and’); and \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) and \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) are\nformulas whenever \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula (the readings were\nindicated above).  Note that in a non-BNF recursive specification of\nthe language, the Greek variable \\(\\varphi\\) would be used\na metavariable ranging over formulas, and one would normally\nstate the clause for conjunctions as: \\((\\varphi \\wedge \\psi)\\) is a\nformula whenever \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas. But the BNF\nlet's us get away with just using \\(\\varphi\\) to get the same\neffect. \nWe will call this basic language that includes both\na Knowledge and a Belief operator,\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\). As in propositional logic, additional\nconnectives are defined from \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\wedge\\): Typical notation\nis ‘\\(\\vee\\)’ for ‘or’,\n‘\\(\\rightarrow\\)’ for ‘if…, then\n…’ and ‘\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)’ for\n‘… if, and only if, …’. Also typically\n\\(\\top\\) (‘top’) and \\(\\bot\\) (‘bottom’) is\nused to denote the constantly true proposition and the constantly\nfalse proposition, respectively. \nAs we shall see below, \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is read as stating that\n\\(\\varphi\\) holds in all of the worlds accessible to\na. In this sense, K can be regarded as behaving\nsimilarly to the ‘box’ operator, \\(\\square\\), often used\nto denote necessity. In evaluating \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) at a possible\nworld w, one is in effect evaluating a universal\nquantification over all the worlds accessible from w. The\nuniversal quantifier \\(\\forall\\) in first-order logic has the\nexistential quantifier \\(\\exists\\) as its dual: This means\nthat the quantifiers are mutually definable by taking either\n\\(\\forall\\) as primitive and defining \\(\\exists x\\varphi\\) as short\nfor \\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg\\varphi\\) or by taking \\(\\exists\\) as primitive\nand defining \\(\\forall x\\varphi\\) as \\(\\neg\\exists x\\neg\\varphi\\). In\nthe case of \\(K_{a}\\), it may be seen that the formula \\(\\neg\nK_{a}\\neg\\varphi\\) makes an existential quantification: It\nsays that there exists an accessible world that satisfies\n\\(\\varphi\\). In the literature, a dual operator for \\(K_{a}\\) is often\nintroduced. The typical notation for \\(\\neg K_{a}\\neg\\) includes\n\\(\\langle K_{a}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\widehat{K}_{a}\\). This notation mimics\nthe diamond-shape \\(\\lozenge\\), which is the standard dual operator to\nthe box \\(\\square\\), which in turn is standard notation for the\nuniversally quantifying modal operator (see the entry on\n modal logic). \nMore expressive languages in epistemic logic involve the addition of\noperators for various notions of group knowledge (see\n Section 3).\n For example, as we discuss below, the common knowledge\noperator and so-called dynamic operators are important\nadditions to the language of epistemic logic. Dynamic operators can\nindicate for example the truthful public announcement of\n\\(\\varphi\\): \\([\\varphi!]\\). A formula \\([\\varphi!]\\psi\\) is read\n“if \\(\\varphi\\) is truthfully announced to everybody, then after\nthe announcement, \\(\\psi\\) is the case”. The question of what\nkinds of expressive power is added with the addition of operators is a\nresearch topic that is actively being investigated in\n dynamic epistemic logic.\n So, for example, adding \\([\\varphi!]\\) by itself to\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) does not add expressive power, but in a\nlanguage that also includes common knowledge, it does. \nNotice that for example \\(K_{a}K_{a}p\\) is a formula in the language\nwe introduced above. It states that agent a knows that agent\na knows that p is the case. Formula with nested\nepistemic operators of this kind express a higher-order\nattitude: an attitude concerning the the attitude of some agent. \nHigher-order attitudes is a recurring theme in epistemic logic. The\naforementioned Moore sentences, e.g., \\(B_{a}(p\\wedge B_{a}\\neg p)\\)\nexpress a higher-order attitude. So do many of the epistemic\nprinciples discussed in the literature and below. Consider the\nfollowing prominent epistemic principle involving higher-order\nknowledge: \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\). Is it\nreasonable to require that knowledge satisfies this scheme, i.e., that\nif somebody knows \\(\\varphi\\), then they know that they know\n\\(\\varphi\\)? In part, we might hesitate before accepting this\nprinciple in virtue of the higher-order attitude involved. This is a\nmatter of ongoing discussion in epistemic logic and epistemology. \nThe semantics of the formal language introduced above is generally\npresented in terms of so-called possible worlds. In epistemic logic\npossible worlds are interpreted as epistemic alternatives. Hintikka\nwas the first to explicitly articulate such an approach (1962). This\nis another central feature of his approach to epistemology which\ncontinues to inform developments today. It may be stated,\n simplified,[1]\n as follows: \nPartition Principle: Any propositional attitude\npartitions the set of possible worlds into those that are in\naccordance with the attitude and those that are not. \nThe partition principle may be used to provide a semantics for the\nknowledge operator. Informally, \n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is true in world w if, and only if,\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true in every world \\(w'\\) compatible with what\na knows at w. \nHere, agent a knows that \\(\\varphi\\) just in case the agent has\ninformation that rules out every possibility of error and rules out every\ncase where \\(\\neg\\varphi\\). \nSince the 1960s Kripke models, defined below, have\nserved as the basis of the most widely used semantics for all\nvarieties of modal logic. The use of Kripke models in the\nrepresentation of epistemic concepts involves taking a philosophical\nstance with respect to those concepts. One widespread interpretation,\nespecially in theoretical economics and theoretical computer science,\nunderstands knowledge in terms of informational indistinguishability\nbetween possible worlds. What we will refer to here as the\nindistinguishability interpretation goes back at least to\nLehmann (1984). \nAs the indistinguishability interpretation concerns knowledge, but not\nbelief, we will be working with a language without belief operators.\nTherefore, let the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) be given by the\nBackus-Naur form  \nAs we shall see, the indistinguishability interpretation involves very\nstringent requirements in order for something to qualify as knowledge.\nWe introduce it here for pedagogical purposes, putting the formal\ndetails of the interpretation in place so as to introduce and explain\nrelatively less extreme positions thereafter. \nConsider again the case of Zoe, the hen, and the dog. The example\ninvolves two propositions, which we will identify with the formal\natoms: \np read as “there is a hen in the yard”. \nand \nq read as “there is a dog in the yard”. \nIt is worth emphasizing that for the purposes of our formalization of\nthis scenario, these two are the only propositions of\ninterest. We are restricting our attention to\n\\(\\textit{Atom}=\\{p,q\\}\\). In early presentations of epistemic logic\nand in much of standard epistemic logic at present, all the\natoms of interest are included from the outset. Obviously, this is an\nidealized scenario. It is important to notice what this approach\nleaves out. Considerations that are not captured in this way include\nthe appearance of novel atoms; the idea that other atomic propositions\nmight be introduced at some future state via some process of learning\nfor example, or the question of an agent’s awareness of\npropositions; the scenario in which an agent might be temporarily\nunaware of some atom due to some psychological or other\nfactor (see\n Section 4\n for references to so-called awareness logic). For now, the\nmain point is that standard epistemic logic begins with the assumption\nthat the set Atom exhausts the space of propositions for the\nagent. \nWith two atoms, there are four different ways a world could\nconsistently be. We can depict each by a box: \nThe four boxes may be formally represented by a set\n\\(W=\\{w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}\\}\\), typically called a set of\npossible worlds. Each world is further\nlabeled with the atoms true at that world. They are labeled by a\nfunction V, the valuation. The\nvaluation specifies which atoms are true at each world in the\nfollowing way: Given an atom p, \\(V(p)\\) is the subset of\nworlds at which p is\n true.[2]\n That \\(w_{1}\\) is labeled with p and q thus means that\n\\(w_{1}\\in V(p)\\) and \\(w_{1}\\in V(q)\\). In the illustration,\n\\(V(p)=\\{w_{1},w_{2}\\}\\) and \\(V(q)=\\{w_{1},w_{3}\\}\\). \nFor presentational purposes, assume that there really is a hen in the\nyard, but no dog. Then \\(w_{2}\\) would represent the\nactual world of the model. In illustrations,\nthe actual world is commonly highlighted: \nNow, assume that the hen is always clucking, but that the dog never\nbarks, and that although Zoe has acute hearing, she cannot see the\nyard. Then there are certain possible worlds that Zoe cannot\ndistinguish: possible ways things may be which she cannot\ntell apart. For example, being in the world with only a hen \\((p,\\neg\nq)\\), Zoe cannot tell if she is in the world with both hen and dog\n\\((p,q)\\): her situation is such that Zoe is aware of two ways things\ncould be but her information does not allow her to eliminate\neither. \nTo illustrate that one possible world cannot be distinguished from\nanother, an arrow is typically drawn from the former to the\nlatter: \nHere, arrows represent a binary relation on possible worlds.\nIn modal logic in general, it is referred to as the\naccessibility relation. Under the\nindistinguishability interpretation of epistemic logic, it is\nsometimes called the indistinguishability\nrelation. Formally, denote the relation \\(R_{a}\\), with\nthe subscript showing the relation belongs to agent a. The\nrelation is a subset of the set of ordered pairs of possible\nworlds, \\(\\{(w,w')\\colon w,w'\\in W\\}\\). One world w\n“points” to another \\(w'\\) if \\((w,w')\\in\nR_{a}\\). In this case, \\(w'\\) is said\nto be accessible (indistinguishable) from w.\nIn the literature, this is often written \\(wR_{a}w'\\) or \\(R_{a}ww'\\).\nThe notation ‘\\(w'\\in R_{a}(w)\\)’ is also common: the set\n\\(R_{a}(w)\\) is then the worlds accessible from w, i.e.,  \nA final note: the set \\(\\{(w,w')\\colon w,w'\\in W\\}\\) is often written\n\\(W\\times W\\), the Cartesian product of W with\nitself. \nFor \\(R_{a}\\) to faithfully represent a relation of\nindistinguishability, what worlds should it relate? If Zoe was plunged\nin \\(w_{1}\\) for example, could she tell that she is not in \\(w_{2}\\)?\nNo: the relation of indistinguishability is symmetricif one\ncannot tell a from b, neither can one tell b from\na. That a relation is symmetric is typically drawn by omitting\narrow-heads altogether or by putting them in both directions: \nWhich of the remaining worlds are indistinguishable? Given that the\nhen is always clucking, Zoe has information that allows her to\ndistinguish \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) from \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) and\nvice versa, cf. symmetry. Hence, no arrows between these. The\nworlds \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) are indistinguishable. This brings us\nto the following representation: \nSince no information will ever allow Zoe to distinguish something from\nitself, any possible world is thus related to itself and the\nindistinguishability relation is reflexive: \nThe standard interpretation of the Zoe example in terms of a possible\nworlds model is now complete. Before turning to a general presentation\nof the indistinguishability interpretation, let us look at what Zoe\nknows. \nRecall the informal modal semantics of the knowledge operator from\nabove: \n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is true in world w if, and only if,\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true in every world \\(w'\\) compatible with the\ninformation a has at w. \nTo approach a formal definition, take ‘\\(w\\vDash\\varphi\\)’\nto mean that \\(\\varphi\\) is true in world w. Thus we can,\ndefine truth of \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) in w by \n\\(w\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\(w'\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all \\(w'\\) such\nthat \\(wR_{a}w'\\). \nThis definition states that a knows \\(\\varphi\\) in world\nw if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is the case in all the worlds\n\\(w'\\) which a cannot distinguish from\n w. \nSo, where does that leave Zoe? First off, the definition allows us to\nevaluate her knowledge in each of the worlds, but seeing as \\(w_{2}\\)\nis the actual world, it is the world of interest. Here are some\nexamples of what we can say about Zoe’s knowledge in\n\\(w_{2}\\): \nWe could say a lot more about Zoe’s knowledge: every formula of\nthe epistemic language without belief operators may be evaluated in\nthe model. It thus represents all Zoe’s higher-order information\nabout her own knowledge of which points 3. and 4. are the first\nexamples. \nOne last ingredient is required before we can state the\nindistinguishability interpretation in its full generality. In the\nexample above, it was shown that the indistinguishability relation was\nboth symmetric and reflexive. Formally, these\nproperties may be defined as follows: \nDefinition: A binary relation \\(R\\subseteq W\\times\nW\\) is \nThe missing ingredient is then the relational property of\ntransitivity. ’Shorter than’ is an example of a\ntransitive property: Let x be shorter than y, and let\ny be shorter than z. Then x must be shorter than\nz. So, given \\(w_{1},w_{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\), if the relation\nR holds between \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) and between \\(w_{2}\\)\nand \\(w_{3}\\), then the arrow between \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\) is the\nconsequence of requiring the relation to be transitive: \nFormally, transitivity is defined as follows: \nDefinition: A binary relation \\(R\\subseteq W\\times\nW\\) is transitive iff for all \\(w,w',w''\\in\nW,\\) if \\(wRw'\\) and \\(w'Rw''\\), then \\(wRw''\\) \nA relation that is both reflexive, symmetric and transitive is called\nan equivalence relation. \nWith all the components in place, let us now define the Kripke\nmodel: \nDefinition: A Kripke model\nfor \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) is a tuple \\(M=(W,R,V)\\) where \nIn the definition, ‘\\(\\mathcal{P}(W)\\)’ denotes the\npowerset of W: It consists of all the subsets of\nW. Hence \\(V(p)\\), the valuation of atom p in the model\nM, is some subset of the possible worlds: Those where p\nis true. In this general definition, R can be any relation on\nW. \nTo specify which world is actual, one last parameter is added to the\nmodel. When the actual world is specified a Kripke model is commonly\ncalled pointed: \nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) is a pair \\((M,w)\\)\nwhere \nFinally, we may formally define the semantics that was somewhat\nloosely expressed above. This is done by defining a relation between\npointed Kripke models and the formulas of the formal language. The\nrelation is denoted ‘\\(\\vDash\\)’ and is often called the\nsatisfaction relation. \nThe definition then goes as follows: \nDefinition: Let \\(M=(W,R_{a},V)\\) be a Kripke model\nfor \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) and let \\((M,w)\\) be a pointed Kripke model.\nThen for all \\(p\\in \\textit{Atom}\\) and all\n\\(\\varphi,\\psi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) \nThe formula \\(\\varphi\\) is satisfied in the\npointed model \\((M,w)\\) iff \\((M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\). \nIn full generality, the indistinguishability interpretation holds that\nfor \\(K_{a}\\) to capture knowledge, the relation \\(R_{a}\\) must be an\nequivalence relation. A pointed Kripke model for which this is\nsatisfied is often referred to as an epistemic\nstate. In epistemic states, the relation is denoted by a\ntilde with subscript: \\(\\sim_{a}\\). \nGiven pointed Kripke models and the indistinguishability\ninterpretation, we have a semantic specification of one concept of\nknowledge. With this approach, we can build models of situations\ninvolving knowledge as we did with the toy example of Zoe and the\nhens. We can use these models to determine what the agent does or does\nnot know. We also have the formal foundations in place to begin asking\nquestions concerning how the agent’s knowledge or uncertainty\ndevelops when it receives new information, a topic studied in\n dynamic epistemic logic. \nWe may also ask more general questions concerning the concept of\nknowledge modeled using pointed Kripke models with indistinguishability\nrelations: Instead of looking at a particular model at the time and\nasking which formulas the model makes true, we can ask which general\nprinciples all such models agree on. \nSettling on the correct formal representation of knowledge involves\nreflecting carefully on the epistemological principles to which one is\ncommitted. An uncontroversial example of such a principle which most\nphilosophers will accept is veridicality: \nIf a proposition is known, then it is true. \nIn a formal context this principle can be understood to say that if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is known then it should always be satisfied in one’s\nmodels. If it turns out that some of one’s chosen models falsify\nthe veridicality principle, then most philosophers would simply deem\nthose models unacceptable. \nReturning to pointed Kripke models, we can now ask which principles\nthese models commit one to. In order to begin answering this question,\nwe need to understand the most general features of our formalism. The\nstrategy in modal logic in general (see Blackburn, de Rijke, &\nVenema 2001) is to abstract away from any given model’s\ncontingent features. Contingent features would include, for\nexample, the specific number of worlds under consideration, the\nspecific valuation of the atoms, and the choice of an actual world. In\nthis case, the only features that are not contingent are those\nrequired by the general definition of a pointed Kripke model. \nTo abstract suitably, take a pointed Kripke model \\((M,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\).\nTo determine whether the relation of this model is an equivalence\nrelation we only need to consider the worlds and the relation. The\npair of these elements constitute the fundamental level of the model\nand is called the frame of the model: \nDefinition: Let \\((M,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\) be a pointed\nKripke model. Then the pair \\((W,R)\\) is called the\nframe of \\((M,w)\\). Any model \\((M',w')\\)\nwhich shares the frame \\((W,R)\\) is said to be built\non \\((W,R)\\). \nConsider again the epistemic state for Zoe from above: \nSeveral other models may be built on the same frame. The following are\ntwo examples: \nWith the notion of a frame, we may define the notion of validity of\ninterest. It is the second term defined in the following: \nDefinition: A formula \\(\\varphi\\) is said to be\nvalid in the frame \\(F=(W,R)\\) iff every\npointed Kripke model build on F satisfies \\(\\varphi\\), i.e.,\niff for every \\((M,w)=(F,V,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\), \\((M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\). A\nformula \\(\\varphi\\) is valid on the class of\nframes \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) (written\n\\(\\mathsf{F}\\vDash\\varphi\\)) iff \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in every frame\nF in \\(\\mathsf{F}\\). \nThe set of formulas valid on a class of frames \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) is\ncalled the logic of \\(\\mathsf{F}\\). Denote\nthis logic that is, the set\n\\(\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{F}\\vDash\\varphi\\}\\) by\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\). This is a semantic approach to\ndefining logics, each just a set of formulas. One may also define\nlogics proof-theoretically by defining a logic as the set of\nformulas provable in some system. With logics as just sets of\nformulas, soundness and completeness results may\nthen be expressed using set inclusion. To exemplify, let\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\) be a set of axioms and write\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\vdash\\varphi\\) when \\(\\varphi\\) is provable from\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\) using some given set of deduction rules. Let the\nresulting logic the set of theorems be denoted\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\). It is the set of formulas from\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) provable from \\(\\mathsf{A}\\), i.e., the set\n\\(\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{A}\\vdash\\varphi\\}\\). The\nlogic \\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\) is sound with respect to \\(\\mathsf{F}\\)\niff \\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\subseteq\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\) and complete\nwith respect to \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) iff\n\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\subseteq\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\).[3] \nReturning to the indistinguishability interpretation of knowledge, we\nmay then seek to find the epistemological principles which the\ninterpretation is committed to. There is a trivial answer of little\ndirect interest: Let \\(\\mathsf{EQ}\\) be the class of frames with\nequivalence relations. Then the logic of the indistinguishability\ninterpretation is the set of formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) which are\nvalid over \\(\\mathsf{EQ}\\), i.e., the set\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{EQ}}:=\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{EQ}\\vDash\\varphi\\}\\).\nNot very informative. \nTaking an axiomatic approach to specifying the logic,\nhowever, yields a presentation in terms of easy to grasp principles.\nTo start with the simplest, then the principle T states that knowledge\nis factual: If the agent knows \\(\\varphi\\), then \\(\\varphi\\)\nmust be true. The more cumbersome K states that if the agent knows an\nimplication, then if the agent knows the antecedent, it also knows the\nconsequent. I.e., if we include the derivation rule modus\nponens (from \\(\\varphi\\rightarrow\\psi\\) and \\(\\varphi\\), conclude\n\\(\\psi\\)) as rule of our logic of knowledge, K states that knowledge\nis closed under implication. The principle B states that if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true, then the agent knows that it considers\n\\(\\varphi\\) possible. Finally, 4 states that if the agent knows\n\\(\\varphi\\), then it knows that it knows \\(\\varphi\\). T, B and 4 in\nthe table below (the names are historical and not all meaningful). \nIn lieu of epistemological intuitions, we could discuss a concept of\nknowledge by discussing these and other principles. Should we accept T\nas a principle that knowledge follows? What about the others? Before\nwe proceed, let us first make clear how the four above principles\nrelate to the indistinguishability interpretation. To do so, we need\nthe notion of a normal modal logic. In the below definition,\nas in the above principles, we are technically using formula\nschemas. For example, in \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\), the\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a variable ranging over formulas in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). Thus, strictly speaking,\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) is not a formula, but a\nscheme for obtaining a formula. A modal instance of\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) is then the formula obtained by\nletting \\(\\varphi\\) be some concrete formula from \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\).\nFor example, \\(K_{a}p\\rightarrow p\\) and \\(K_{a}(p\\wedge\nK_{a}q)\\rightarrow(p\\wedge K_{a}q)\\) are both modal instances of\nT. \nDefinition: Let \\(\\Lambda\\subseteq\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\)\nbe a set of modal formulas. Then \\(\\Lambda\\) is a normal\nmodal logic iff \\(\\Lambda\\) satisfies all of the\nfollowing: \nThere is a unique smallest normal modal logic (given the set\nAtom)that which contains exactly what is required by the\ndefinition and nothing more. It is often called the\nminimal normal modal logic and is\ndenoted by the boldface K (not to be confused with\nthe non-boldface K denoting the schema). \nThe logic K is just a set of formulas from\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). I.e.,\nK \\(\\subseteq\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). Points 1.4.\ngives a perspective on this set: They provide an\naxiomatization. Often, as below, the schema K is referred to\nas an axiom, though really the instantiations of K are axioms. \nTo K, we can add additional principles as axioms\n(axiom schemes) to obtain stronger logics (logics that have additional\ntheorems: Logics \\(\\Lambda\\) for which\nK \\(\\subseteq\\Lambda\\)). Of immediate interest\nis the logic called S5: \nDefinition: The logic S5 is the\nsmallest normal modal logic containing all modal instances of T, B,\nand 4. \nHere, then, is the relationship between the above four principles and\nthe indistinguishability interpretation: \nTheorem 1: The logic S5 is the logic\nof the class of pointed Kripke models build on frames with equivalence\nrelations. I.e., \\(\\textbf{S5} =\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{EQ}}\\). \nWhat does this theorem tell us with respect to the principles of\nknowledge, then? In one direction it tells us that if one accepts the\nindistinguishability interpretation, then one has implicitly accepted the\nprinciples K, T, B and 4 as reasonable for knowledge. In the other\ndirection, it tells us that if one finds that S5 is\nthe appropriate logic of knowledge and one finds that pointed\nKripke models are the right way to semantically represent knowledge,\nthen one must use an equivalence relation. Whether one should\ninterpret this relation in terms of indistinguishability, though, is a\nmatter on which logic is silent. \nIn discussing principles for knowledge, it may be that some of the\nfour above seem acceptable, while others do not: One may disagree with\nthe acceptability of B and 4, say, while accepting K and T. In\nunderstanding the relationship between S5 and\nequivalence relations, a more fine-grained perspective is beneficial:\nTheorem 1 may be chopped into smaller pieces reflecting the\ncontribution of the individual principles K, T, 4 and B to the\nequivalence requirementi.e., that the relation should be at the same\ntime reflexive, symmetric and transitive. \nTheorem 2: Let \\(F=(W,R)\\) be a frame. Then: \nThere are a number of insights to gain from Theorem 2. First, if one\nwants to use any type of Kripke model to capture knowledge,\nthen one must accept K. Skipping some details, one must in fact accept\nthe full logic K as this is the logic of the class of\nall Kripke models (see, e.g., Blackburn, de Rijke, &\nVenema 2001). \nSecond, the theorem shows that there is an intimate relationship\nbetween the individual epistemic principles and the properties on the\nrelation. This, in turn, means that one, in general, may approach the\n“logic” in epistemic logic from two sides from intuitions\nabout the accessibility relation or from intuitions about epistemic\nprinciples. \nSeveral normal modal logical systems weaker than S5\nhave been suggested in the literature. Here, we specify the logics by\nthe set of their modal axioms. For example, the logic\nK is given by \\(\\{\\text{K}\\}\\), while\nS5 is given by\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\). To establish\nnomenclature, the following table contains a selection of principles\nfrom the literature with the frame properties they characterize, cf.\nAucher (2014) and Blackburn, de Rijke, & Venema (2001), on the\nline below them. The frame conditions are not all straightforward. \nIn Table 1, the subscript on \\(R_{a}\\) is omitted to ease readability,\nand so is the domain of quantification W over which the worlds\nvariables \\(x,y,z\\) range. \nTable 1. Epistemic Principles and their\nframe conditions. \nAdding epistemic principles as axioms to the basic minimal normal\nmodal logic K yields new, normal modal logics. A\nselection is: \nTable 2. Logic names and axioms \nDifferent axiomatic specifications may produce the same logic. Notice,\ne.g., that the table’s axiomatic specification\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\) of S5 does not\nmatch that given in the definition preceding Theorem 1,\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\). Note also, there is more\nthan one axiomatization of S5: the axioms\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\),\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\),\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{D},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{D},\\text{B},\\text{5}\\}\\) all give the\nS5 logic (cf., e.g., Chellas 1980). An often seen\nvariant is \\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{4},\\text{5}\\}\\). However, it is\nredundant to add it as all its instances can be proven from K, T and\n5. But as both 4 and 5 capture important epistemic principles (see\n Section 2.6),\n 4 is often sometimes included for the sake of philosophical\ntransparency. For more equivalences between modal logics, see, e.g.,\nthe entry on\n modal logic\n or Chellas (1980) or Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema (2001). \nLogics may be stronger or weaker than each other, and knowing the\nframe properties of their axioms may help us to understand their\nrelationship. For example, as 4 is derivable from\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\), all the theorems of\nS4 are derivable in S5.\nS5 is thus at least as strong as\nS4. In fact, S5 is also strictly\nstronger: It can prove things which S4\ncannot. \nThat S5 may be axiomatized both by\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\) may be seen through the frame\nproperties of the axioms: every reflexive and euclidean relation (T\nand 5) is an equivalence relation (T, B, and 4). This also shows the\nredundancy of 4: If one has assumed a relation reflexive and\neuclidean, then it adds nothing new to additionally assume it to be\ntransitive. In general, having an understanding of the interplay\nbetween relational properties is of great aid in seeing relationships\nbetween modal logics. For example, noticing that every reflexive\nrelation is also serial means that all formulas valid on the class of\nserial models are also valid on the class of reflexive models. Hence,\nevery theorem of D is thus a theorem of\nT. Hence T is at least as strong as\nD (i.e., \\(\\textbf{D}\\subseteq\\textbf{T}\\)). That\nT is also strictly stronger (not\n\\(\\textbf{T}\\subseteq\\textbf{D}\\)) can be shown by finding a serial,\nnon-reflexive model which does not satisfy some theorem of\nT (for example \\(K_{a}p\\rightarrow p\\)). \nWith the formal background of epistemic logic in place, it is\nstraightforward to slightly vary the framework in order to accommodate\nthe concept of belief. Return to the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) of\nboth knowledge and belief: \nTo interpret knowledge and belief formulas together in pointed Kripke\nmodels, all that is needed is an additional relation between possible\nworlds: \nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) is a tuple\n\\((M,w)=(W,R_{K},R_{B},V,w)\\) where \n\\(R_{K}\\) is the relation for the knowledge operator and \\(R_{B}\\) the\nrelation for the belief operator. The definition makes no further\nassumptions about their properties. In the figure below we provide an\nillustration, where the arrows are labeled in accordance with the\nrelation they correspond to. The reflexive loop at \\(w_{3}\\) is a\nlabel indicating that it belongs to both relations, i.e.,\n\\((w_{3},w_{3})\\in R_{K}\\) and \\((w_{3},w_{3})\\in R_{B}\\). \nThe satisfaction relation is defined as above, but with the obvious\nchanges for knowledge and belief: \n\\((M,w)\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\((M,w')\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all\n\\(w'\\in W\\) such that \\(wR_{K}w'\\). \n\\((M,w)\\vDash B_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\((M,w')\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all\n\\(w'\\in W\\) such that \\(wR_{B}w'\\). \nThe indistinguishability interpretation puts very strong requirements\non the accessibility relation for knowledge. These have now been\nstripped away and so has any commitment to the principles T, B, D, 4\nand 5. Taking Kripke models as basic semantics, we are still committed\nto K, though this principle is not unproblematic as we shall see below\nin our discussion of the problem of logical omniscience. \nOf the principles from Table 1, T, D, B, 4 and 5 have been discussed\nmost extensively in the literature on epistemic logic, both as\nprinciples for knowledge and as principles for belief. The principle T\nfor knowledge \nis broadly accepted. Knowledge is commonly taken to be\nveridicalonly true proposition can be known. For, e.g.,\nHintikka (1962) and Fagin et al. (1995), the failure of T for belief\nis the defining difference between the two notions. \nThough belief is not commonly taken to be veridical, believes are\ntypically taken to be consistent. I.e., agents are taken to\nnever believe the contradiction that is, any formula\nequivalent with \\((p\\wedge\\neg p)\\) or \\(\\bot\\), for short. That\nbelieves should be consistent is then captured by the principle \nThe principle \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) is, on Kripke models, equivalent with\nthe principle D, \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\widehat{B}_{a}\\varphi\\).\nHence the validity of \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) requires serial frames.\nWitness, e.g., its failure in \\(w_{1}\\) above: As there are no worlds\naccessible through \\(R_{B}\\), all accessible worlds satisfy\n\\(\\bot\\). Hence \\(w_{1}\\) satisfies \\(B_{a}\\bot\\), violating\nconsistency. Notice also that \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) may be re-written to\n\\(\\widehat{B}_{a}\\top\\), which is true at a world just in case some\nworld is accessible through \\(R_{B}\\). Its validity thus ensures\nseriality. \nNotice that the veridicality of knowledge ensures its consistency: Any\nreflexive frame is automatically serial. Hence accepting\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) implies accepting \\(\\neg\nK_{a}\\bot\\). \nOf the principles D, 4 and 5, the two latter have received far the\nmost attention, both for knowledge and for belief. They are commonly\ninterpreted as governing of principled access to own mental\nstates. The 4 principles \nare often referred to as principles of positive\nintrospection, or for knowledge the ‘KK’\nprinciple. Both principles are deemed acceptable by, e.g.,\nHintikka (1962) on grounds different from introspection. He\nargues based on an autoepistemic analysis of knowledge, using a\nnon-Kripkean possible worlds semantics called model systems.\nHintikka holds that when an agent commits to knowing \\(\\varphi\\), the\nagent commits to holding the same attitude no matter what new\ninformation the agent will encounter in future. This entails that in\nall the agent’s epistemic alternatives for Hintikka, all the\nmodel sets (partial descriptions of possible worlds) where the agent\nknows at least as much they now do the agent still knows \\(\\varphi\\).\nAs \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) thus holds in all the agent’s epistemic\nalternatives, Hintikka concludes that \\(K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\). Likewise\nHintikka endorses 4 for belief, but Lenzen raises objections (Lenzen\n1978: ch. 4). \nWilliamson argues against the general acceptability of the principle\n(Williamson 2000: ch. 5) for a concept of knowledge based on slightly\ninexact observations, a so-called margin of error principle\n(see, e.g., Aucher 2014 for a short summary). \nThe 5 principles \nare often referred to as principles of negative\nintrospection. Negative introspection is quite controversial as\nit poses very high demands on knowledge and belief. The schema 5 may\nbe seen as a closed world assumption (Hendricks 2005): The\nagent has complete overview of all the possible worlds and own\ninformation. If \\(\\neg\\psi\\) is considered possible\n(\\(\\widehat{K}_{a}\\neg\\psi\\), i.e., \\(\\neg K_{a}\\psi\\)), then the\nagent knows it is considered possible (\\(K_{a}\\neg K_{a}\\psi\\)). Such\na closed world assumption is natural when constructing hyper-rational\nagents in, e.g., computer science or game theory, where the agents are\nassumed to reason as hard as logically possible about their own\ninformation when making decisions. \nArguing against 5 is Hintikka (1962), using his conception of\nepistemic alternatives. Having accepted T for knowledge, 5 stands or\nfalls with the assumption of a symmetric accessibility relation. But,\nHintikka argues, the accessibility relation is not symmetric: If the\nagent possess some amount of information at model set \\(s_{1}\\), then\nthe model set \\(s_{2}\\) where the agent has learned something more\nwill be an epistemic alternative to \\(s_{1}\\). But \\(s_{1}\\) will not\nbe an epistemic alternative to \\(s_{2}\\), because in \\(s_{1}\\), the\nagent does by hypothesis not know as much as it does in \\(s_{2}\\).\nHence the relation is not symmetric, so 5 is not a principle of\nknowledge, on Hintikka’s account. \nGiven Hintikka’s non-standard semantics, it is a bit difficult\nto pin down whether he would accept a normal modal logic as the logics\nof knowledge and belief, but if so, then S4 and\nKD4 would be the closest candidates (see Hendricks\n& Rendsvig 2018 for this point). By contrast, for knowledge von\nKutschera argued for S4.4 (1976), Lenzen suggested\nS4.2 (1978), van der Hoek argued for\nS4.3 (1993), and Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi\n(1995) and many others use S5 for knowledge and\nKD45 for belief. \nBeyond principles governing knowledge and principles governing belief,\none may also consider principles governing the interplay between\nknowledge and belief. Three principles of interest are \nThe principles KB1 and KB2 were introduced by Hintikka, who endorses\nboth Hintikka (1962) noting that Plato is also committed to KB1 in\nTheatetus. The first principle, KB1, captures the intuition\nthat knowledge is a stronger notion than belief. The second like 4 and\n5captures the idea that one has privileged access to one’s own\nbeliefs. The third, stemming from Lenzen (1978), captures the notion\nthat beliefs are held with some kind of conviction: if something is\nbelieved, it is believed to be known. \nThough the interaction principles KB1KB3 may look innocent on their\nown, they may lead to counterintuitive conclusions when combined with\nspecific logics of knowledge and belief. First, Voorbraak (1993) shows\nthat combining 5 for knowledge and D for belief with KB1, implies\nthat \nis a theorem of the resulting logic. Assuming that knowledge is\ntruthful, this theorem entails that agents cannot believe to know\nsomething which happens to be false. \nIf additionally KB3 is added, the notions of knowledge and belief\ncollapse. I.e., it may be proven that\n\\(B_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}\\varphi\\), which, in combination with\nKB1 entails that \nHence, the two notions have collapsed to one. This was stated in 1986,\nby Kraus and Lehmann. \nIf one is not interested in knowledge and belief collapsing, one must\nthus give something up: One cannot have both 5 for knowledge, D for\nbelief and KB1 and KB3 governing their interaction. Again, results\nconcerning correspondence between principles and relation properties\nmay assist: In 1993, van der Hoek showed based on a semantic analysis\nthat where the four principles are jointly sufficient for collapse,\nno subset of them is, too. Giving up any one principle will\nthus eliminate the collapse. Weakening KB1 to hold only for non-modal\nformulas is also sufficient to avoid collapse (cf. Halpern 1996). \nFor more on epistemic interaction principles, the principles .2, .3,\n.3.2. and .4, and relations to so-called conditional beliefs,\nsee Aucher (2014). For an introduction to conditional beliefs and\nrelations to several other types of knowledge from the philosophical\nliterature, see Baltag and Smets (2008). The latter also includes\ndiscussion concerning the interdefinability of various notions, as\ndoes Halpern, Samet, and Segev (2009) for knowledge and\n(non-conditional) belief. \nWe human beings are preoccupied with the epistemic states of other\nagents. In ordinary life, we reason with varying degrees of success\nabout what others know. We are especially concerned with what others\nknow about us, and often specifically about what they know about what\nwe know. \nDoes she know that I know where she buried the treasure? \nDoes she know that I know that she knows? \nAnd so on. \nEpistemic logic can reveal interesting epistemic features of systems\ninvolving groups of agents. In some cases, for example, emergent\nsocial phenomena depend on agents reasoning in particular ways about\nthe knowledge and beliefs of other agents. As we have seen,\ntraditional systems of epistemic logic applied only to single-agent\ncases. However, they can be extended to groups or multi-agent systems\nin a relatively straightforward manner. \nAs David Lewis noted in his book Convention (1969) many\nprominent features of social life depend on agents assuming that the\nrules of some practice are matters of common knowledge. For\nexample, drivers know that a red traffic light indicates that they\nshould stop at an intersection. However, for the convention of traffic\nlights to be in place at all, it is first necessary that drivers must\nalso know that other drivers know that red means\nstop. In addition, drivers must also know that everyone knows\nthat everyone knows that …. The conventional role of traffic\nlights relies on all drivers knowing that all drivers know the rule,\nthat the rule is a piece of\n common knowledge. \nA variety of norms, social and linguistic practices, agent\ninteractions and games presuppose common knowledge, first formalized\nby Aumann (1976) and with earliest epistemic logical treatments by\nLehmann (1984) and by Halpern and Moses (1984). In order to see how\nepistemic logic sheds light on these phenomena, it is necessary to\nintroduce a little more formalism. Following the standard treatment\n(see, e.g., Fagin et al. 1995), we can syntactically augment the\nlanguage of propositional logic with n knowledge operators, one\nfor each agent involved in the group of agents under consideration.\nThe primary difference between the semantics given for a mono-agent\nand a multi-agent semantics is roughly that n accessibility\nrelations are introduced. A modal system for n agents is\nobtained by joining together n modal logics where for\nsimplicity it may be assumed that the agents are homogenous in the\nsense that they may all be described by the same logical system. An\nepistemic logic for n agents consists of n copies of a\ncertain modal logic. In such an extended epistemic logic it is\npossible to express that some agent in the group knows a certain fact\nthat an agent knows that another agent knows a fact etc. It is\npossible to develop the logic even further: Not only may an agent know\nthat another agent knows a fact, but they may all know this fact\nsimultaneously. \nTo represent knowledge for a set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) of n agents,\nfirst let’s stipulate a language. Let \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) be\ngiven by the Backus-Naur form \nTo represent knowledge for all n agents jointly in pointed\nKripke models, all that is needed is to add suitably many\nrelations: \nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) is a tuple\n\\((M,w)=(W,\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}},V,w)\\) where \nTo also incorporate beliefs, simply apply the same move as in the\nsingle agent case: augment the language and let there be two relations\nfor each agent. \nThe definition uses a family of relations\n\\(\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\). In the literature, the same is\ndenoted \\((W,R_{i},V,w)_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\). Alternatively, R\nis taken to be a function sending agents to relations, i.e.,\n\\(R:\\mathcal{A\\rightarrow}\\mathcal{P}(W\\times W)\\). Then for each\n\\(i\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), \\(R(i)\\) is a relation on W, often denoted\n\\(R_{i}\\). These are stylistic choices. \nWhen considering only a single agent, it is typically not relevant to\ninclude more worlds in W than there are possible valuations of\natoms. In multi-agent cases, this is not the case: to express the\ndifferent forms of available higher-order knowledge, many copies of\n“the same” world are needed. Let us exemplify for\n\\(\\mathcal{A}=\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\textit{Atom}=\\{p\\}\\) and each\n\\(R_{i},i\\in\\mathcal{A},\\) an equivalence relation. Let us represent\nthat both a and b know p, but b does not\nknow that a knows p , i.e., \\(K_{a}p\\wedge\nK_{b}p\\wedge\\neg K_{b}K_{a}p\\). Then we need three worlds: \nIf we try to let \\(w_{1}\\) play the role of \\(w_{2}\\), then a\nwould lose knowledge in p: both p worlds are needed. In\ngeneral, if W is assumed to have any fixed, finite size, there\nwill be some higher-order information formula that cannot be satisfied\nin it. \nMulti-agent systems are interesting for other reasons than to\nrepresent higher-order information. The individual agents’\ninformation may also be pooled to capture what the agents know\njointly, as group knowledge (see Baltag, Boddy, & Smets 2018 for a\nrecent discussion). A standard notion is this style is distributed\nknowledge: The knowledge the group would have if the\nagents share all their individual knowledge. To represent it, augment\nthe language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) with operators  \nto make \\(D_{G}\\varphi\\) a well-formed formula. Where\n\\(G\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}\\) is a group of agents, the formula\n\\(D_{G}\\varphi\\) reads that it is distributed knowledge in the\ngroup G that \\(\\varphi\\). \nTo evaluate \\(D_{G}\\varphi\\), we define a new relation from those\nalready present in the model. The idea behind the definition is that\nif some one agent has eliminated a world as an epistemic alternative,\nthen so will the group. Define the relation as the intersection of the\nindividual agents’ relations: \nIn the three state model, \\(R_{G}^{D}\\) contains only the three loops.\nTo evaluate a distributed knowledge formula, use the same form as for\nother modal operators:  \nIt may be the case that some very knowing agent knows all that is\ndistributed knowledge in G, but it is not guaranteed. To\ncapture that all the agents know \\(\\varphi\\), we could use the\nconjunction of the formulas \\(K_{i}\\varphi\\) for \\(\\in\\mathcal{A}\\),\ni.e., \\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\). This is a\nwell-defined formula if \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is finite (which it typically\nis). If \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is not finite, then\n\\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\) is not a formula in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\), as it has only finite conjunctions. As a\nshorthand for \\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\), it is\nstandard to introduce the everybody knows operator,\n\\(E_{G}\\): \nIn the three world model, \\(K_{a}p\\wedge K_{b}p\\), so\n\\(E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\). \nThat everybody knows something does not mean that this knowledge is\nshared between the members of the group. The three world model\nexemplifies this: Though \\(E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\), it also the case that\n\\(\\neg K_{b}E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\). \nTo capture that there is no uncertainty in the group about \\(\\varphi\\)\nnor any higher-order uncertainty about \\(\\varphi\\) being\nknown by all agents, no formula in the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\)\nis enough. Consider the formula  \nwhere \\(E_{G}^{k}\\) is short for k iterations of the \\(E_{G}\\)\noperator. Then for no natural number k will the formula\n\\(E_{G}^{k}\\varphi\\) be enough: it could be the case that b\ndoesn’t know it! To rectify this situation, one could try  \nbut this is not a formula as \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) only contains finite\nconjunctions. \nHence, though the \\(E_{G}\\) operator is definable in the language\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\), a suitable notion of common knowledge\nis not. For that, we again need to define a new relation on our model.\nThis time, we are interested in capturing that nobody considers\n\\(\\varphi\\) epistemically possible anywhere. To build the\nrelation, we therefore first take the union the relations of all the\nagents in G, but this is not quite enough: to use the standard\nmodal semantic clause, we must also be able to reach all of the worlds\nin this relation in a single step. Hence, let  \nwhere \\((\\cdotp)^{*}\\) is the operation of taking the transitive\nclosure. If R is a relation, then \\((R)^{*}\\) is R\nplus all the pairs missing to make R a transitive relation.\nConsider the three world model: With the relation\n\\(\\bigcup_{i\\in\\{a,b\\}}R_{i}\\), we can reach \\(w_{3}\\) from \\(w_{1}\\)\nin two steps, stopping over at \\(w_{2}\\). With\n\\((\\bigcup_{i\\in\\{a,b\\}}R_{i})^{*}\\), \\(w_{3}\\) is reachable in one\nstep: By the newly added transitive link from \\(w_{1}\\) to\n\\(w_{3}\\). \nTo represent common knowledge, augment the Backus-Naur form\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) with operators  \nto make \\(C_{G}\\varphi\\) a well-formed formula. Evaluate such formulas\nby the semantic clause  \nVarying the properties of the accessibility relations\n\\(R_{1},R_{2},\\ldots,R_{n}\\), as described above results in different\nepistemic logics. For instance system K with common\nknowledge is determined by all frames, while system\nS4 with common knowledge is determined by all\nreflexive and transitive frames. Similar results can be obtained for\nthe remaining epistemic logics (Fagin et al. 1995). For more, consult\n the entry on common knowledge. \nThe principal complaint against the approach taken by epistemic\nlogicians is that it is committed to an excessively idealized picture\nof human reasoning. Critics have worried that the relational semantics\nof epistemic logic commits one to a closure property for an\nagent’s knowledge that is implausibly strong given actual human\nreasoning abilities. The closure properties give rise to what has come\nto be called the problem of logical omniscience: \nWhenever an agent c knows all of the formulas in a set\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and A follows logically from \\(\\Gamma\\),\nthen c also knows A. \nIn particular, c knows all theorems (letting\n\\(\\Gamma=\\emptyset\\)), and knows all the logical consequences of any\nformula that the agent knows (letting \\(\\Gamma\\) consist of a single\nformula). The concern here is that finite agents are constrained by\nlimits on their cognitive capacities and reasoning abilities.\n The account of knowledge and belief that epistemic logic seems\ncommitted to involves superhuman abilities like knowing all the\ntautologies. Thus, the concern is that epistemic logic is simply\nunsuited to capturing actual knowledge and belief as these notions\nfigure in ordinary human life. \nHintikka recognized a discrepancy between the rules of epistemic logic\nand the way the verb “to know” is ordinarily used already\nin the early pages of Knowledge and Belief. He pointed out\nthat  \nit is clearly inadmissible to infer “he knows that\nq” from “he knows that p” solely on\nthe basis that q follows logically from p, for the\nperson in question may fail to see that p entails q,\nparticularly if p and q are relatively complicated\nstatements. (1962: 30-31)  \nHintikka’s first reaction to what came to be called the problem\nof logical omniscience was to see the discrepancy between ordinary\nusage of terms like “consistency” and formal treatments of\nknowledge as indicating a problem with our ordinary terminology. If a\nperson knows the axioms of a mathematical theory but is unable to\nstate the distant consequences of the theory, Hintikka denied that it\nis appropriate to call that person inconsistent.  In ordinary\nhuman affairs, Hintikka claimed, the charge of inconsistency when\ndirected towards an agent has the connotation of being irrational or\ndishonest.  Thus, from Hintikka’s perspective we should\nchoose some other term to capture the situation of someone who is\nrational and amenable to persuasion or correction but not logically\nomniscient. Non-omniscient, rational agents can be in a position to\nsay that “I know that p but I don’t know whether\nq” even in case q can p. He then suggests\nthat q should be regarded as defensible given the\nagent’s knowledge and the denial of q should be regarded\nas indefensible. This choice of terminology was criticized\ninsofar as it attaches the pejorative indefensible to some\nset of proposition, even though the fault actually lies in the\nagent’s cognitive capacities (Chisholm 1963; Hocutt 1972; Jago\n2007). \nHintikka’s early epistemic logic can be understood as a way of\nreasoning about what is implicit in an agent’s knowledge even in\ncases where the agent itself is unable to determine what is implicit.\nSuch an approach risks being excessively idealized and its relevance\nfor understanding human epistemic circumstances can be challenged on\nthese grounds. \nFew philosophers were satisfied with Hintikka’s attempt to\nrevise our ordinary use of the term “consistent” as he\npresented it in Knowledge and Belief.  However, he and\nothers soon provided more popular ways of dealing with logical\nomniscience. In the 1970s responses to the problem of logical\nomniscience introduced semantical entities that explain why the agent\nappears to be, but in fact is not really guilty of logical\nomniscience. Hintikka called these entities “impossible possible\nworlds” (1979; see also the entry on\n impossible worlds\n and Jago 2014). The basic idea is that an agent may mistakenly count\namong the worlds consistent with its knowledge, some worlds containing\nlogical contradictions. The mistake is simply a product of the\nagent’s limited resources; the agent may not be in a position to\ndetect the contradiction and may erroneously count them as genuine\npossibilities. In some respects, this approach can be understood as an\nextension of the aforementioned response to logical omniscience that\nHintikka had already outlined in Knowledge and Belief. \nIn the same spirit, entities called “seemingly possible”\nworlds are introduced by Rantala (1975) in his urn-model analysis of\nlogical omniscience. Allowing impossible possible worlds or seemingly\npossible worlds in which the semantic valuation of the formulas is\narbitrary to a certain extent provides a way of making the appearance\nof logical omniscience less threatening. After all, on any realistic\naccount of epistemic agency, the agent is likely to consider (albeit\ninadvertently) worlds in which the laws of logic do not hold. Since no\nreal epistemic principles hold broadly enough to encompass impossible\nand seemingly possible worlds, some conditions must be applied to\nepistemic models such that they cohere with epistemic principles (for\ncriticism of this approach see Jago 2007: 336-337). \nAlternatively to designing logics in which the knowledge operators do\nnot exhibit logical omniscience, awareness logic offers an\nalternative: Change the interpretation of \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) from\n“a knows that \\(\\varphi\\)” to “a\nimplicitly knows that \\(\\varphi\\)” and take\nexplicit knowledge that \\(\\varphi\\) to be implicit knowledge\nthat \\(\\varphi\\) and awareness of \\(\\varphi\\). With awareness\nnot closed under logical consequence, such a move allows for notion of\nexplicit knowledge not logically omniscient. As agents neither have to\ncompute their implicit knowledge nor can they be held responsible for\nanswering queries based on it, logical omniscience is problematic only\nfor explicit knowledge, the problem of logical omniscience is\nthus averted. Though logical omniscience is an epistemological\ncondition for implicit knowledge, the agent itself may actually fail\nto realize this condition. For more on awareness logic, see, e.g., the\nseminal Fagin & Halpern (1987) or Velazquez-Quesada (2011) and\nSchipper (2015) for overviews. \nDebates about the various kinds of idealization involved in epistemic\nlogic are ongoing in both philosophical and interdisciplinary\ncontexts.","contact.mail":"rendsvig@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2019-06-07","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-epistemic/","author1":"Rasmus Rendsvig","author1.info":"http://www.fil.lu.se/en/person/RasmusRendsvig/","author2.info":"http://www.johnsymons.net/","entry":"logic-epistemic","body.text":"\n\n\nEpistemic logic is a subfield of epistemology concerned with logical\napproaches to knowledge, belief and related notions. Though any logic\nwith an epistemic interpretation may be called an epistemic\nlogic, the most widespread type of epistemic logics in use at\npresent are modal logics. Knowledge and belief are represented via the\nmodal operators K and B, often with a subscript\nindicating the agent that holds the attitude. Formulas\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) and \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) are then read “agent\na knows that phi” and “agent a believes that\nphi”, respectively. Epistemic logic allows the formal\nexploration of the implications of epistemic principles. For example,\nthe formula \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) states that what is\nknown is true, while \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\)\nstates that what is known is known to be known. The semantics of\nepistemic logic are typically given in terms of possible worlds\nvia Kripke models such that the formula \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is\nread to assert that \\(\\varphi\\) is true in all worlds agent a\nconsiders epistemically possible relative to its current information.\nThe central problems that have concerned epistemic logicians include,\nfor example, determining which epistemic principles are most\nappropriate for characterizing knowledge and belief, the logical\nrelations between different conceptions of knowledge and belief, and\nthe epistemic features of groups of agents. Beyond philosophy proper,\nepistemic logic flourishes in theoretical computer science, economics,\nand related fields.\n\nAristotelian texts set the groundwork for discussions of the logic of\nknowledge and belief, particularly De Sophisiticis Elenchis\nas well as the Prior and Posterior Analytics. While\nAristotle addressed the four alethic modes of possibility, necessity,\nimpossibility, and contingency, Buridan, Pseudo Scotus, Ockham, and\nRalph Strode, helped to extend Aristotle’s insights to epistemic\nthemes and problems (Boh 1993; Knuuttila 1993). During this period,\nthe Pseudo-Scot and William of Ockham supplemented Aristotle’s\nstudy of mental acts of cognition and volition (see Boh 1993: 130).\nIvan Boh’s studies of the history of fourteenth and fifteenth\ncentury investigations into epistemic logic provide a excellent\ncoverage of the topic, especially his Epistemic Logic in the Later\nMiddle Ages (1993). \nAccording to Boh, the English philosopher Ralph Strode formulated a\nfully general system of propositional epistemic rules in his\ninfluential 1387 book Consequences (Boh 1993: 135).\nStrode’s presentation built on the earlier logical treatises of\nOckham and Burley. Problems of epistemic logic were also discussed\nbetween the 1330s and 1360s by the so-called Oxford Calculators, most\nprominently by William Heytesbury and Richard Kilvington. By the\nfifteenth century, Paul of Venice and other Italian philosophers also\nengaged in sophisticated reflection on the relationship between\nknowledge, truth, and ontology. \nDiscussions of epistemic logic during the medieval period share a\nsimilar set of foundational assumptions with contemporary discussions.\nMost importantly, medieval philosophers explored the connection\nbetween knowledge and veracity: If I know p, then p is\ntrue. Furthermore, many medieval discussions begin with an assumption\nsimilar to G.E. Moore’s observation that an epistemic agent\ncannot coherently assert “p but I do not believe (know)\np”. Sentences of this form are generally referred to as\nMoore sentences. \nModern treatments of the logic of knowledge and belief grew out of the\nwork of philosophers and logicians writing from 1948 through the\n1950s. Rudolf Carnap, Jerzy Łoś, Arthur Prior, Nicholas\nRescher, G.H. von Wright and others recognized that our discourse\nconcerning knowledge and belief admits of an axiomatic-deductive\ntreatment. Among the many important papers that appeared in the 1950s,\nvon Wright’s seminal work (1951) is widely acknowledged as\nhaving initiated the formal study of epistemic logic as we know it\ntoday. Von Wright’s insights were extended by Jaakko Hintikka in\nhis book Knowledge and Belief: An Introduction to the Logic of the\nTwo Notions (1962). Hintikka provided a way of interpreting\nepistemic concepts in terms of possible world semantics and as such it\nhas served as the foundational text for the study of epistemic logic\never since. \nIn the 1980s and 1990s, epistemic logicians focused on the logical\nproperties of systems containing groups of knowers and later still on\nthe epistemic features of so-called “multi-modal”\ncontexts. Since the 1990s work in\n dynamic epistemic logic\n has extended traditional epistemic logic by modeling the dynamic\nprocess of knowledge acquisition and belief revision.\n In the past two decades, epistemic logic has come to\ncomprise a broad set of formal approaches to the interdisciplinary\nstudy of knowledge and belief. \nInterest in epistemic logic extends well beyond philosophers. Recent\ndecades have seen a great deal of interdisciplinary attention to\nepistemic logic with economists and computer scientists actively\ndeveloping the field together with logicians and philosophers. In 1995\ntwo important books signaled the fertile interplay between computer\nscience and epistemic logic: Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi (1995)\nand Meyer and van der Hoek (1995). Work by computer scientists has\nbecome increasingly central to epistemic logic in the intervening\nyears. \nAmong philosophers, there is increased attention to the interplay\nbetween these formal approaches and traditional epistemological\nproblems (See for example, van Benthem 2006; Hendricks & Symons\n2006; Stalnaker 2006; Holliday 2018). \nSeveral introductory texts on epistemic logic exist, e.g., van Benthem\n(2011); Ditmarsch, Hoek, and Kooi (2007); Ditmarsch et al. (2015);\nGochet and Gribomont (2006); and Meyer (2001) with Lenzen (1980)\nproviding an overview of early developments. \nUntil relatively recently, epistemic logic focused almost exclusively\non propositional knowledge. In cases of propositional knowledge, an\nagent or a group of agents bears the propositional attitude of knowing\ntowards some proposition. For example, when one says: “Zoe knows\nthat there is a hen in the yard”, one asserts that Zoe is the\nagent who bears the propositional attitude knowing towards\nthe proposition expressed by the English sentence “there is a\nhen in the yard”. Now imagine that Zoe does not know whether\nthere is a hen in the yard. For example, it might be the case that she\nhas no access to information about whether there is or is not a hen in\nthe yard. In this case her lack of information means that she will\nconsider two scenarios as being possible, one in which there is a hen\nin the yard and one in which there is not. \nPerhaps she has some practical decision that involves not only hens\nbut also the presence of frightening dogs in the yard. She might wish\nto feed the hens but will only do so if there is no dog in the yard.\nIf she were ignorant of whether there is a dog in the yard, the number\nof scenarios she must consider in her deliberations grows to four.\nClearly, one needs to consider epistemic alternatives when one does\nnot have complete information concerning the situations that are\nrelevant to one’s decisions. As we shall see below, possible\nworlds semantics has provided a useful framework for understanding the\nmanner in which agents can reason about epistemic alternatives. \nWhile epistemic logicians had traditionally focused on knowing\nthat, one finds a range of other uses of knowledge in natural\nlanguage. As Wang (2015) points out, the expressions knowing\nhow, knowing what, knowing why are very common,\nappearing almost just as frequently (sometimes more frequently) in\nspoken and written language as knowing that. Recently\nnon-standard epistemic logics of such expressions have been developed,\nthough knowing who constructions are present in\nHintikka’s Knowledge and Belief (1962; see also\nBoër & Lycan 1986; Rendsvig 2012). Thus, beyond propositional\nknowledge, epistemic logic also suggests ways to systematize the logic\nof questions and answers (Brendan knows why the dog barked). It also\nprovides insight into the relationships between multiple modes of\nidentification (Zoe knows that this man is the president). Here, the\nagent can be said to know a fact relating multiple modes of\nidentification insofar as she correctly identifies the president, who\nshe might know from stories in the newspaper with the man she sees\nstanding in front of her, who she identifies as an object in her\nvisual field (Hintikka & Symons 2003). Epistemic logic may also\nprovide insight into questions of procedural “know-how”\n(Brendan knows how to change a fuse). For example, knowing how to\n\\(\\varphi\\) can be understood to be equivalent to the claim that there\nexists a way such that an agent knows that it is a way to ensure that\n\\(\\varphi\\) (see Wang 2015, 2018). Work concerning the justifications\nof knowledge have also been undertaken by combinations of\njustification logic with epistemic logic (see, e.g., Artemov\n& Nogina 2005; Renne 2008). There is ongoing work on these and\nother topics, and new developments are appearing steadily. \nRecent work in epistemic logic relies on a modal conception of\nknowledge. In order to be clear about the role of modality in\nepistemic logic it is helpful to introduce the basic elements of the\nmodern formalism. For the sake of simplicity we begin with the case of\nknowledge and belief for a single agent, postponing consideration of\nmultiple agents to\n Section 3, \nA prototypical epistemic logic language is given by first fixing a set\nof propositional variables \\(p_{1}\\), \\(p_{2}\\),…. In\napplications of epistemic logic, propositional variables are given\nspecific interpretations: For example, \\(p_{1}\\) could be taken to\nrepresent the proposition “there is a hen in the yard” and\n\\(p_{2}\\) the proposition “there is a dog in the yard”,\netc. The propositional variables represent propositions which are\nrepresented in no finer detail in the formal language. As such, they\nare therefore often referred to as atomic propositions or\nsimply atoms. Let Atom denote the set of atomic\npropositions. \nApart from the atomic propositions, epistemic logic supplements the\nlanguage of propositional logic with a modal operator, \\(K_{a}\\), for\nknowledge and \\(B_{a}\\), for belief. \n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) reads “Agent a knows that\n\\(\\varphi\\)” \nand similarly \n\\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) reads “Agent a believes that\n\\(\\varphi\\)”. \nIn many recent publications on epistemic logic, the full set of\nformulas in the language is given using a so-called Backus-Naur\nForm (BNF). This is simply a notational technique derived from\ncomputer science that provides a recursive definition of the formulas\ndeemed grammatically “correct”, i.e., the set\nof well-formed formulas: \nIt should noted that the Greek letter \\(\\varphi\\) stands for\nthe syntactic category of formula. So this definition says:\nan atom p is a formula; \\(\\neg\\varphi\\) is a formula if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a formula (read \\(\\neg\\) as ‘it is not the case\nthat’); \\((\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\) is a formula whenever any two\nformulas are connected by the \\(\\wedge\\) symbol (read \\(\\wedge\\) as\n‘and’); and \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) and \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) are\nformulas whenever \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula (the readings were\nindicated above).  Note that in a non-BNF recursive specification of\nthe language, the Greek variable \\(\\varphi\\) would be used\na metavariable ranging over formulas, and one would normally\nstate the clause for conjunctions as: \\((\\varphi \\wedge \\psi)\\) is a\nformula whenever \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas. But the BNF\nlet's us get away with just using \\(\\varphi\\) to get the same\neffect. \nWe will call this basic language that includes both\na Knowledge and a Belief operator,\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\). As in propositional logic, additional\nconnectives are defined from \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\wedge\\): Typical notation\nis ‘\\(\\vee\\)’ for ‘or’,\n‘\\(\\rightarrow\\)’ for ‘if…, then\n…’ and ‘\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)’ for\n‘… if, and only if, …’. Also typically\n\\(\\top\\) (‘top’) and \\(\\bot\\) (‘bottom’) is\nused to denote the constantly true proposition and the constantly\nfalse proposition, respectively. \nAs we shall see below, \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is read as stating that\n\\(\\varphi\\) holds in all of the worlds accessible to\na. In this sense, K can be regarded as behaving\nsimilarly to the ‘box’ operator, \\(\\square\\), often used\nto denote necessity. In evaluating \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) at a possible\nworld w, one is in effect evaluating a universal\nquantification over all the worlds accessible from w. The\nuniversal quantifier \\(\\forall\\) in first-order logic has the\nexistential quantifier \\(\\exists\\) as its dual: This means\nthat the quantifiers are mutually definable by taking either\n\\(\\forall\\) as primitive and defining \\(\\exists x\\varphi\\) as short\nfor \\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg\\varphi\\) or by taking \\(\\exists\\) as primitive\nand defining \\(\\forall x\\varphi\\) as \\(\\neg\\exists x\\neg\\varphi\\). In\nthe case of \\(K_{a}\\), it may be seen that the formula \\(\\neg\nK_{a}\\neg\\varphi\\) makes an existential quantification: It\nsays that there exists an accessible world that satisfies\n\\(\\varphi\\). In the literature, a dual operator for \\(K_{a}\\) is often\nintroduced. The typical notation for \\(\\neg K_{a}\\neg\\) includes\n\\(\\langle K_{a}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\widehat{K}_{a}\\). This notation mimics\nthe diamond-shape \\(\\lozenge\\), which is the standard dual operator to\nthe box \\(\\square\\), which in turn is standard notation for the\nuniversally quantifying modal operator (see the entry on\n modal logic). \nMore expressive languages in epistemic logic involve the addition of\noperators for various notions of group knowledge (see\n Section 3).\n For example, as we discuss below, the common knowledge\noperator and so-called dynamic operators are important\nadditions to the language of epistemic logic. Dynamic operators can\nindicate for example the truthful public announcement of\n\\(\\varphi\\): \\([\\varphi!]\\). A formula \\([\\varphi!]\\psi\\) is read\n“if \\(\\varphi\\) is truthfully announced to everybody, then after\nthe announcement, \\(\\psi\\) is the case”. The question of what\nkinds of expressive power is added with the addition of operators is a\nresearch topic that is actively being investigated in\n dynamic epistemic logic.\n So, for example, adding \\([\\varphi!]\\) by itself to\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) does not add expressive power, but in a\nlanguage that also includes common knowledge, it does. \nNotice that for example \\(K_{a}K_{a}p\\) is a formula in the language\nwe introduced above. It states that agent a knows that agent\na knows that p is the case. Formula with nested\nepistemic operators of this kind express a higher-order\nattitude: an attitude concerning the the attitude of some agent. \nHigher-order attitudes is a recurring theme in epistemic logic. The\naforementioned Moore sentences, e.g., \\(B_{a}(p\\wedge B_{a}\\neg p)\\)\nexpress a higher-order attitude. So do many of the epistemic\nprinciples discussed in the literature and below. Consider the\nfollowing prominent epistemic principle involving higher-order\nknowledge: \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\). Is it\nreasonable to require that knowledge satisfies this scheme, i.e., that\nif somebody knows \\(\\varphi\\), then they know that they know\n\\(\\varphi\\)? In part, we might hesitate before accepting this\nprinciple in virtue of the higher-order attitude involved. This is a\nmatter of ongoing discussion in epistemic logic and epistemology. \nThe semantics of the formal language introduced above is generally\npresented in terms of so-called possible worlds. In epistemic logic\npossible worlds are interpreted as epistemic alternatives. Hintikka\nwas the first to explicitly articulate such an approach (1962). This\nis another central feature of his approach to epistemology which\ncontinues to inform developments today. It may be stated,\n simplified,[1]\n as follows: \nPartition Principle: Any propositional attitude\npartitions the set of possible worlds into those that are in\naccordance with the attitude and those that are not. \nThe partition principle may be used to provide a semantics for the\nknowledge operator. Informally, \n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is true in world w if, and only if,\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true in every world \\(w'\\) compatible with what\na knows at w. \nHere, agent a knows that \\(\\varphi\\) just in case the agent has\ninformation that rules out every possibility of error and rules out every\ncase where \\(\\neg\\varphi\\). \nSince the 1960s Kripke models, defined below, have\nserved as the basis of the most widely used semantics for all\nvarieties of modal logic. The use of Kripke models in the\nrepresentation of epistemic concepts involves taking a philosophical\nstance with respect to those concepts. One widespread interpretation,\nespecially in theoretical economics and theoretical computer science,\nunderstands knowledge in terms of informational indistinguishability\nbetween possible worlds. What we will refer to here as the\nindistinguishability interpretation goes back at least to\nLehmann (1984). \nAs the indistinguishability interpretation concerns knowledge, but not\nbelief, we will be working with a language without belief operators.\nTherefore, let the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) be given by the\nBackus-Naur form  \nAs we shall see, the indistinguishability interpretation involves very\nstringent requirements in order for something to qualify as knowledge.\nWe introduce it here for pedagogical purposes, putting the formal\ndetails of the interpretation in place so as to introduce and explain\nrelatively less extreme positions thereafter. \nConsider again the case of Zoe, the hen, and the dog. The example\ninvolves two propositions, which we will identify with the formal\natoms: \np read as “there is a hen in the yard”. \nand \nq read as “there is a dog in the yard”. \nIt is worth emphasizing that for the purposes of our formalization of\nthis scenario, these two are the only propositions of\ninterest. We are restricting our attention to\n\\(\\textit{Atom}=\\{p,q\\}\\). In early presentations of epistemic logic\nand in much of standard epistemic logic at present, all the\natoms of interest are included from the outset. Obviously, this is an\nidealized scenario. It is important to notice what this approach\nleaves out. Considerations that are not captured in this way include\nthe appearance of novel atoms; the idea that other atomic propositions\nmight be introduced at some future state via some process of learning\nfor example, or the question of an agent’s awareness of\npropositions; the scenario in which an agent might be temporarily\nunaware of some atom due to some psychological or other\nfactor (see\n Section 4\n for references to so-called awareness logic). For now, the\nmain point is that standard epistemic logic begins with the assumption\nthat the set Atom exhausts the space of propositions for the\nagent. \nWith two atoms, there are four different ways a world could\nconsistently be. We can depict each by a box: \nThe four boxes may be formally represented by a set\n\\(W=\\{w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}\\}\\), typically called a set of\npossible worlds. Each world is further\nlabeled with the atoms true at that world. They are labeled by a\nfunction V, the valuation. The\nvaluation specifies which atoms are true at each world in the\nfollowing way: Given an atom p, \\(V(p)\\) is the subset of\nworlds at which p is\n true.[2]\n That \\(w_{1}\\) is labeled with p and q thus means that\n\\(w_{1}\\in V(p)\\) and \\(w_{1}\\in V(q)\\). In the illustration,\n\\(V(p)=\\{w_{1},w_{2}\\}\\) and \\(V(q)=\\{w_{1},w_{3}\\}\\). \nFor presentational purposes, assume that there really is a hen in the\nyard, but no dog. Then \\(w_{2}\\) would represent the\nactual world of the model. In illustrations,\nthe actual world is commonly highlighted: \nNow, assume that the hen is always clucking, but that the dog never\nbarks, and that although Zoe has acute hearing, she cannot see the\nyard. Then there are certain possible worlds that Zoe cannot\ndistinguish: possible ways things may be which she cannot\ntell apart. For example, being in the world with only a hen \\((p,\\neg\nq)\\), Zoe cannot tell if she is in the world with both hen and dog\n\\((p,q)\\): her situation is such that Zoe is aware of two ways things\ncould be but her information does not allow her to eliminate\neither. \nTo illustrate that one possible world cannot be distinguished from\nanother, an arrow is typically drawn from the former to the\nlatter: \nHere, arrows represent a binary relation on possible worlds.\nIn modal logic in general, it is referred to as the\naccessibility relation. Under the\nindistinguishability interpretation of epistemic logic, it is\nsometimes called the indistinguishability\nrelation. Formally, denote the relation \\(R_{a}\\), with\nthe subscript showing the relation belongs to agent a. The\nrelation is a subset of the set of ordered pairs of possible\nworlds, \\(\\{(w,w')\\colon w,w'\\in W\\}\\). One world w\n“points” to another \\(w'\\) if \\((w,w')\\in\nR_{a}\\). In this case, \\(w'\\) is said\nto be accessible (indistinguishable) from w.\nIn the literature, this is often written \\(wR_{a}w'\\) or \\(R_{a}ww'\\).\nThe notation ‘\\(w'\\in R_{a}(w)\\)’ is also common: the set\n\\(R_{a}(w)\\) is then the worlds accessible from w, i.e.,  \nA final note: the set \\(\\{(w,w')\\colon w,w'\\in W\\}\\) is often written\n\\(W\\times W\\), the Cartesian product of W with\nitself. \nFor \\(R_{a}\\) to faithfully represent a relation of\nindistinguishability, what worlds should it relate? If Zoe was plunged\nin \\(w_{1}\\) for example, could she tell that she is not in \\(w_{2}\\)?\nNo: the relation of indistinguishability is symmetricif one\ncannot tell a from b, neither can one tell b from\na. That a relation is symmetric is typically drawn by omitting\narrow-heads altogether or by putting them in both directions: \nWhich of the remaining worlds are indistinguishable? Given that the\nhen is always clucking, Zoe has information that allows her to\ndistinguish \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) from \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) and\nvice versa, cf. symmetry. Hence, no arrows between these. The\nworlds \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) are indistinguishable. This brings us\nto the following representation: \nSince no information will ever allow Zoe to distinguish something from\nitself, any possible world is thus related to itself and the\nindistinguishability relation is reflexive: \nThe standard interpretation of the Zoe example in terms of a possible\nworlds model is now complete. Before turning to a general presentation\nof the indistinguishability interpretation, let us look at what Zoe\nknows. \nRecall the informal modal semantics of the knowledge operator from\nabove: \n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is true in world w if, and only if,\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true in every world \\(w'\\) compatible with the\ninformation a has at w. \nTo approach a formal definition, take ‘\\(w\\vDash\\varphi\\)’\nto mean that \\(\\varphi\\) is true in world w. Thus we can,\ndefine truth of \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) in w by \n\\(w\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\(w'\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all \\(w'\\) such\nthat \\(wR_{a}w'\\). \nThis definition states that a knows \\(\\varphi\\) in world\nw if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is the case in all the worlds\n\\(w'\\) which a cannot distinguish from\n w. \nSo, where does that leave Zoe? First off, the definition allows us to\nevaluate her knowledge in each of the worlds, but seeing as \\(w_{2}\\)\nis the actual world, it is the world of interest. Here are some\nexamples of what we can say about Zoe’s knowledge in\n\\(w_{2}\\): \nWe could say a lot more about Zoe’s knowledge: every formula of\nthe epistemic language without belief operators may be evaluated in\nthe model. It thus represents all Zoe’s higher-order information\nabout her own knowledge of which points 3. and 4. are the first\nexamples. \nOne last ingredient is required before we can state the\nindistinguishability interpretation in its full generality. In the\nexample above, it was shown that the indistinguishability relation was\nboth symmetric and reflexive. Formally, these\nproperties may be defined as follows: \nDefinition: A binary relation \\(R\\subseteq W\\times\nW\\) is \nThe missing ingredient is then the relational property of\ntransitivity. ’Shorter than’ is an example of a\ntransitive property: Let x be shorter than y, and let\ny be shorter than z. Then x must be shorter than\nz. So, given \\(w_{1},w_{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\), if the relation\nR holds between \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) and between \\(w_{2}\\)\nand \\(w_{3}\\), then the arrow between \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\) is the\nconsequence of requiring the relation to be transitive: \nFormally, transitivity is defined as follows: \nDefinition: A binary relation \\(R\\subseteq W\\times\nW\\) is transitive iff for all \\(w,w',w''\\in\nW,\\) if \\(wRw'\\) and \\(w'Rw''\\), then \\(wRw''\\) \nA relation that is both reflexive, symmetric and transitive is called\nan equivalence relation. \nWith all the components in place, let us now define the Kripke\nmodel: \nDefinition: A Kripke model\nfor \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) is a tuple \\(M=(W,R,V)\\) where \nIn the definition, ‘\\(\\mathcal{P}(W)\\)’ denotes the\npowerset of W: It consists of all the subsets of\nW. Hence \\(V(p)\\), the valuation of atom p in the model\nM, is some subset of the possible worlds: Those where p\nis true. In this general definition, R can be any relation on\nW. \nTo specify which world is actual, one last parameter is added to the\nmodel. When the actual world is specified a Kripke model is commonly\ncalled pointed: \nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) is a pair \\((M,w)\\)\nwhere \nFinally, we may formally define the semantics that was somewhat\nloosely expressed above. This is done by defining a relation between\npointed Kripke models and the formulas of the formal language. The\nrelation is denoted ‘\\(\\vDash\\)’ and is often called the\nsatisfaction relation. \nThe definition then goes as follows: \nDefinition: Let \\(M=(W,R_{a},V)\\) be a Kripke model\nfor \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) and let \\((M,w)\\) be a pointed Kripke model.\nThen for all \\(p\\in \\textit{Atom}\\) and all\n\\(\\varphi,\\psi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) \nThe formula \\(\\varphi\\) is satisfied in the\npointed model \\((M,w)\\) iff \\((M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\). \nIn full generality, the indistinguishability interpretation holds that\nfor \\(K_{a}\\) to capture knowledge, the relation \\(R_{a}\\) must be an\nequivalence relation. A pointed Kripke model for which this is\nsatisfied is often referred to as an epistemic\nstate. In epistemic states, the relation is denoted by a\ntilde with subscript: \\(\\sim_{a}\\). \nGiven pointed Kripke models and the indistinguishability\ninterpretation, we have a semantic specification of one concept of\nknowledge. With this approach, we can build models of situations\ninvolving knowledge as we did with the toy example of Zoe and the\nhens. We can use these models to determine what the agent does or does\nnot know. We also have the formal foundations in place to begin asking\nquestions concerning how the agent’s knowledge or uncertainty\ndevelops when it receives new information, a topic studied in\n dynamic epistemic logic. \nWe may also ask more general questions concerning the concept of\nknowledge modeled using pointed Kripke models with indistinguishability\nrelations: Instead of looking at a particular model at the time and\nasking which formulas the model makes true, we can ask which general\nprinciples all such models agree on. \nSettling on the correct formal representation of knowledge involves\nreflecting carefully on the epistemological principles to which one is\ncommitted. An uncontroversial example of such a principle which most\nphilosophers will accept is veridicality: \nIf a proposition is known, then it is true. \nIn a formal context this principle can be understood to say that if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is known then it should always be satisfied in one’s\nmodels. If it turns out that some of one’s chosen models falsify\nthe veridicality principle, then most philosophers would simply deem\nthose models unacceptable. \nReturning to pointed Kripke models, we can now ask which principles\nthese models commit one to. In order to begin answering this question,\nwe need to understand the most general features of our formalism. The\nstrategy in modal logic in general (see Blackburn, de Rijke, &\nVenema 2001) is to abstract away from any given model’s\ncontingent features. Contingent features would include, for\nexample, the specific number of worlds under consideration, the\nspecific valuation of the atoms, and the choice of an actual world. In\nthis case, the only features that are not contingent are those\nrequired by the general definition of a pointed Kripke model. \nTo abstract suitably, take a pointed Kripke model \\((M,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\).\nTo determine whether the relation of this model is an equivalence\nrelation we only need to consider the worlds and the relation. The\npair of these elements constitute the fundamental level of the model\nand is called the frame of the model: \nDefinition: Let \\((M,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\) be a pointed\nKripke model. Then the pair \\((W,R)\\) is called the\nframe of \\((M,w)\\). Any model \\((M',w')\\)\nwhich shares the frame \\((W,R)\\) is said to be built\non \\((W,R)\\). \nConsider again the epistemic state for Zoe from above: \nSeveral other models may be built on the same frame. The following are\ntwo examples: \nWith the notion of a frame, we may define the notion of validity of\ninterest. It is the second term defined in the following: \nDefinition: A formula \\(\\varphi\\) is said to be\nvalid in the frame \\(F=(W,R)\\) iff every\npointed Kripke model build on F satisfies \\(\\varphi\\), i.e.,\niff for every \\((M,w)=(F,V,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\), \\((M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\). A\nformula \\(\\varphi\\) is valid on the class of\nframes \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) (written\n\\(\\mathsf{F}\\vDash\\varphi\\)) iff \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in every frame\nF in \\(\\mathsf{F}\\). \nThe set of formulas valid on a class of frames \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) is\ncalled the logic of \\(\\mathsf{F}\\). Denote\nthis logic that is, the set\n\\(\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{F}\\vDash\\varphi\\}\\) by\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\). This is a semantic approach to\ndefining logics, each just a set of formulas. One may also define\nlogics proof-theoretically by defining a logic as the set of\nformulas provable in some system. With logics as just sets of\nformulas, soundness and completeness results may\nthen be expressed using set inclusion. To exemplify, let\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\) be a set of axioms and write\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\vdash\\varphi\\) when \\(\\varphi\\) is provable from\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\) using some given set of deduction rules. Let the\nresulting logic the set of theorems be denoted\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\). It is the set of formulas from\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) provable from \\(\\mathsf{A}\\), i.e., the set\n\\(\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{A}\\vdash\\varphi\\}\\). The\nlogic \\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\) is sound with respect to \\(\\mathsf{F}\\)\niff \\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\subseteq\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\) and complete\nwith respect to \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) iff\n\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\subseteq\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\).[3] \nReturning to the indistinguishability interpretation of knowledge, we\nmay then seek to find the epistemological principles which the\ninterpretation is committed to. There is a trivial answer of little\ndirect interest: Let \\(\\mathsf{EQ}\\) be the class of frames with\nequivalence relations. Then the logic of the indistinguishability\ninterpretation is the set of formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) which are\nvalid over \\(\\mathsf{EQ}\\), i.e., the set\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{EQ}}:=\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{EQ}\\vDash\\varphi\\}\\).\nNot very informative. \nTaking an axiomatic approach to specifying the logic,\nhowever, yields a presentation in terms of easy to grasp principles.\nTo start with the simplest, then the principle T states that knowledge\nis factual: If the agent knows \\(\\varphi\\), then \\(\\varphi\\)\nmust be true. The more cumbersome K states that if the agent knows an\nimplication, then if the agent knows the antecedent, it also knows the\nconsequent. I.e., if we include the derivation rule modus\nponens (from \\(\\varphi\\rightarrow\\psi\\) and \\(\\varphi\\), conclude\n\\(\\psi\\)) as rule of our logic of knowledge, K states that knowledge\nis closed under implication. The principle B states that if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true, then the agent knows that it considers\n\\(\\varphi\\) possible. Finally, 4 states that if the agent knows\n\\(\\varphi\\), then it knows that it knows \\(\\varphi\\). T, B and 4 in\nthe table below (the names are historical and not all meaningful). \nIn lieu of epistemological intuitions, we could discuss a concept of\nknowledge by discussing these and other principles. Should we accept T\nas a principle that knowledge follows? What about the others? Before\nwe proceed, let us first make clear how the four above principles\nrelate to the indistinguishability interpretation. To do so, we need\nthe notion of a normal modal logic. In the below definition,\nas in the above principles, we are technically using formula\nschemas. For example, in \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\), the\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a variable ranging over formulas in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). Thus, strictly speaking,\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) is not a formula, but a\nscheme for obtaining a formula. A modal instance of\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) is then the formula obtained by\nletting \\(\\varphi\\) be some concrete formula from \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\).\nFor example, \\(K_{a}p\\rightarrow p\\) and \\(K_{a}(p\\wedge\nK_{a}q)\\rightarrow(p\\wedge K_{a}q)\\) are both modal instances of\nT. \nDefinition: Let \\(\\Lambda\\subseteq\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\)\nbe a set of modal formulas. Then \\(\\Lambda\\) is a normal\nmodal logic iff \\(\\Lambda\\) satisfies all of the\nfollowing: \nThere is a unique smallest normal modal logic (given the set\nAtom)that which contains exactly what is required by the\ndefinition and nothing more. It is often called the\nminimal normal modal logic and is\ndenoted by the boldface K (not to be confused with\nthe non-boldface K denoting the schema). \nThe logic K is just a set of formulas from\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). I.e.,\nK \\(\\subseteq\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). Points 1.4.\ngives a perspective on this set: They provide an\naxiomatization. Often, as below, the schema K is referred to\nas an axiom, though really the instantiations of K are axioms. \nTo K, we can add additional principles as axioms\n(axiom schemes) to obtain stronger logics (logics that have additional\ntheorems: Logics \\(\\Lambda\\) for which\nK \\(\\subseteq\\Lambda\\)). Of immediate interest\nis the logic called S5: \nDefinition: The logic S5 is the\nsmallest normal modal logic containing all modal instances of T, B,\nand 4. \nHere, then, is the relationship between the above four principles and\nthe indistinguishability interpretation: \nTheorem 1: The logic S5 is the logic\nof the class of pointed Kripke models build on frames with equivalence\nrelations. I.e., \\(\\textbf{S5} =\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{EQ}}\\). \nWhat does this theorem tell us with respect to the principles of\nknowledge, then? In one direction it tells us that if one accepts the\nindistinguishability interpretation, then one has implicitly accepted the\nprinciples K, T, B and 4 as reasonable for knowledge. In the other\ndirection, it tells us that if one finds that S5 is\nthe appropriate logic of knowledge and one finds that pointed\nKripke models are the right way to semantically represent knowledge,\nthen one must use an equivalence relation. Whether one should\ninterpret this relation in terms of indistinguishability, though, is a\nmatter on which logic is silent. \nIn discussing principles for knowledge, it may be that some of the\nfour above seem acceptable, while others do not: One may disagree with\nthe acceptability of B and 4, say, while accepting K and T. In\nunderstanding the relationship between S5 and\nequivalence relations, a more fine-grained perspective is beneficial:\nTheorem 1 may be chopped into smaller pieces reflecting the\ncontribution of the individual principles K, T, 4 and B to the\nequivalence requirementi.e., that the relation should be at the same\ntime reflexive, symmetric and transitive. \nTheorem 2: Let \\(F=(W,R)\\) be a frame. Then: \nThere are a number of insights to gain from Theorem 2. First, if one\nwants to use any type of Kripke model to capture knowledge,\nthen one must accept K. Skipping some details, one must in fact accept\nthe full logic K as this is the logic of the class of\nall Kripke models (see, e.g., Blackburn, de Rijke, &\nVenema 2001). \nSecond, the theorem shows that there is an intimate relationship\nbetween the individual epistemic principles and the properties on the\nrelation. This, in turn, means that one, in general, may approach the\n“logic” in epistemic logic from two sides from intuitions\nabout the accessibility relation or from intuitions about epistemic\nprinciples. \nSeveral normal modal logical systems weaker than S5\nhave been suggested in the literature. Here, we specify the logics by\nthe set of their modal axioms. For example, the logic\nK is given by \\(\\{\\text{K}\\}\\), while\nS5 is given by\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\). To establish\nnomenclature, the following table contains a selection of principles\nfrom the literature with the frame properties they characterize, cf.\nAucher (2014) and Blackburn, de Rijke, & Venema (2001), on the\nline below them. The frame conditions are not all straightforward. \nIn Table 1, the subscript on \\(R_{a}\\) is omitted to ease readability,\nand so is the domain of quantification W over which the worlds\nvariables \\(x,y,z\\) range. \nTable 1. Epistemic Principles and their\nframe conditions. \nAdding epistemic principles as axioms to the basic minimal normal\nmodal logic K yields new, normal modal logics. A\nselection is: \nTable 2. Logic names and axioms \nDifferent axiomatic specifications may produce the same logic. Notice,\ne.g., that the table’s axiomatic specification\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\) of S5 does not\nmatch that given in the definition preceding Theorem 1,\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\). Note also, there is more\nthan one axiomatization of S5: the axioms\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\),\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\),\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{D},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{D},\\text{B},\\text{5}\\}\\) all give the\nS5 logic (cf., e.g., Chellas 1980). An often seen\nvariant is \\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{4},\\text{5}\\}\\). However, it is\nredundant to add it as all its instances can be proven from K, T and\n5. But as both 4 and 5 capture important epistemic principles (see\n Section 2.6),\n 4 is often sometimes included for the sake of philosophical\ntransparency. For more equivalences between modal logics, see, e.g.,\nthe entry on\n modal logic\n or Chellas (1980) or Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema (2001). \nLogics may be stronger or weaker than each other, and knowing the\nframe properties of their axioms may help us to understand their\nrelationship. For example, as 4 is derivable from\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\), all the theorems of\nS4 are derivable in S5.\nS5 is thus at least as strong as\nS4. In fact, S5 is also strictly\nstronger: It can prove things which S4\ncannot. \nThat S5 may be axiomatized both by\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\) may be seen through the frame\nproperties of the axioms: every reflexive and euclidean relation (T\nand 5) is an equivalence relation (T, B, and 4). This also shows the\nredundancy of 4: If one has assumed a relation reflexive and\neuclidean, then it adds nothing new to additionally assume it to be\ntransitive. In general, having an understanding of the interplay\nbetween relational properties is of great aid in seeing relationships\nbetween modal logics. For example, noticing that every reflexive\nrelation is also serial means that all formulas valid on the class of\nserial models are also valid on the class of reflexive models. Hence,\nevery theorem of D is thus a theorem of\nT. Hence T is at least as strong as\nD (i.e., \\(\\textbf{D}\\subseteq\\textbf{T}\\)). That\nT is also strictly stronger (not\n\\(\\textbf{T}\\subseteq\\textbf{D}\\)) can be shown by finding a serial,\nnon-reflexive model which does not satisfy some theorem of\nT (for example \\(K_{a}p\\rightarrow p\\)). \nWith the formal background of epistemic logic in place, it is\nstraightforward to slightly vary the framework in order to accommodate\nthe concept of belief. Return to the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) of\nboth knowledge and belief: \nTo interpret knowledge and belief formulas together in pointed Kripke\nmodels, all that is needed is an additional relation between possible\nworlds: \nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) is a tuple\n\\((M,w)=(W,R_{K},R_{B},V,w)\\) where \n\\(R_{K}\\) is the relation for the knowledge operator and \\(R_{B}\\) the\nrelation for the belief operator. The definition makes no further\nassumptions about their properties. In the figure below we provide an\nillustration, where the arrows are labeled in accordance with the\nrelation they correspond to. The reflexive loop at \\(w_{3}\\) is a\nlabel indicating that it belongs to both relations, i.e.,\n\\((w_{3},w_{3})\\in R_{K}\\) and \\((w_{3},w_{3})\\in R_{B}\\). \nThe satisfaction relation is defined as above, but with the obvious\nchanges for knowledge and belief: \n\\((M,w)\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\((M,w')\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all\n\\(w'\\in W\\) such that \\(wR_{K}w'\\). \n\\((M,w)\\vDash B_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\((M,w')\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all\n\\(w'\\in W\\) such that \\(wR_{B}w'\\). \nThe indistinguishability interpretation puts very strong requirements\non the accessibility relation for knowledge. These have now been\nstripped away and so has any commitment to the principles T, B, D, 4\nand 5. Taking Kripke models as basic semantics, we are still committed\nto K, though this principle is not unproblematic as we shall see below\nin our discussion of the problem of logical omniscience. \nOf the principles from Table 1, T, D, B, 4 and 5 have been discussed\nmost extensively in the literature on epistemic logic, both as\nprinciples for knowledge and as principles for belief. The principle T\nfor knowledge \nis broadly accepted. Knowledge is commonly taken to be\nveridicalonly true proposition can be known. For, e.g.,\nHintikka (1962) and Fagin et al. (1995), the failure of T for belief\nis the defining difference between the two notions. \nThough belief is not commonly taken to be veridical, believes are\ntypically taken to be consistent. I.e., agents are taken to\nnever believe the contradiction that is, any formula\nequivalent with \\((p\\wedge\\neg p)\\) or \\(\\bot\\), for short. That\nbelieves should be consistent is then captured by the principle \nThe principle \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) is, on Kripke models, equivalent with\nthe principle D, \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\widehat{B}_{a}\\varphi\\).\nHence the validity of \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) requires serial frames.\nWitness, e.g., its failure in \\(w_{1}\\) above: As there are no worlds\naccessible through \\(R_{B}\\), all accessible worlds satisfy\n\\(\\bot\\). Hence \\(w_{1}\\) satisfies \\(B_{a}\\bot\\), violating\nconsistency. Notice also that \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) may be re-written to\n\\(\\widehat{B}_{a}\\top\\), which is true at a world just in case some\nworld is accessible through \\(R_{B}\\). Its validity thus ensures\nseriality. \nNotice that the veridicality of knowledge ensures its consistency: Any\nreflexive frame is automatically serial. Hence accepting\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) implies accepting \\(\\neg\nK_{a}\\bot\\). \nOf the principles D, 4 and 5, the two latter have received far the\nmost attention, both for knowledge and for belief. They are commonly\ninterpreted as governing of principled access to own mental\nstates. The 4 principles \nare often referred to as principles of positive\nintrospection, or for knowledge the ‘KK’\nprinciple. Both principles are deemed acceptable by, e.g.,\nHintikka (1962) on grounds different from introspection. He\nargues based on an autoepistemic analysis of knowledge, using a\nnon-Kripkean possible worlds semantics called model systems.\nHintikka holds that when an agent commits to knowing \\(\\varphi\\), the\nagent commits to holding the same attitude no matter what new\ninformation the agent will encounter in future. This entails that in\nall the agent’s epistemic alternatives for Hintikka, all the\nmodel sets (partial descriptions of possible worlds) where the agent\nknows at least as much they now do the agent still knows \\(\\varphi\\).\nAs \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) thus holds in all the agent’s epistemic\nalternatives, Hintikka concludes that \\(K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\). Likewise\nHintikka endorses 4 for belief, but Lenzen raises objections (Lenzen\n1978: ch. 4). \nWilliamson argues against the general acceptability of the principle\n(Williamson 2000: ch. 5) for a concept of knowledge based on slightly\ninexact observations, a so-called margin of error principle\n(see, e.g., Aucher 2014 for a short summary). \nThe 5 principles \nare often referred to as principles of negative\nintrospection. Negative introspection is quite controversial as\nit poses very high demands on knowledge and belief. The schema 5 may\nbe seen as a closed world assumption (Hendricks 2005): The\nagent has complete overview of all the possible worlds and own\ninformation. If \\(\\neg\\psi\\) is considered possible\n(\\(\\widehat{K}_{a}\\neg\\psi\\), i.e., \\(\\neg K_{a}\\psi\\)), then the\nagent knows it is considered possible (\\(K_{a}\\neg K_{a}\\psi\\)). Such\na closed world assumption is natural when constructing hyper-rational\nagents in, e.g., computer science or game theory, where the agents are\nassumed to reason as hard as logically possible about their own\ninformation when making decisions. \nArguing against 5 is Hintikka (1962), using his conception of\nepistemic alternatives. Having accepted T for knowledge, 5 stands or\nfalls with the assumption of a symmetric accessibility relation. But,\nHintikka argues, the accessibility relation is not symmetric: If the\nagent possess some amount of information at model set \\(s_{1}\\), then\nthe model set \\(s_{2}\\) where the agent has learned something more\nwill be an epistemic alternative to \\(s_{1}\\). But \\(s_{1}\\) will not\nbe an epistemic alternative to \\(s_{2}\\), because in \\(s_{1}\\), the\nagent does by hypothesis not know as much as it does in \\(s_{2}\\).\nHence the relation is not symmetric, so 5 is not a principle of\nknowledge, on Hintikka’s account. \nGiven Hintikka’s non-standard semantics, it is a bit difficult\nto pin down whether he would accept a normal modal logic as the logics\nof knowledge and belief, but if so, then S4 and\nKD4 would be the closest candidates (see Hendricks\n& Rendsvig 2018 for this point). By contrast, for knowledge von\nKutschera argued for S4.4 (1976), Lenzen suggested\nS4.2 (1978), van der Hoek argued for\nS4.3 (1993), and Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi\n(1995) and many others use S5 for knowledge and\nKD45 for belief. \nBeyond principles governing knowledge and principles governing belief,\none may also consider principles governing the interplay between\nknowledge and belief. Three principles of interest are \nThe principles KB1 and KB2 were introduced by Hintikka, who endorses\nboth Hintikka (1962) noting that Plato is also committed to KB1 in\nTheatetus. The first principle, KB1, captures the intuition\nthat knowledge is a stronger notion than belief. The second like 4 and\n5captures the idea that one has privileged access to one’s own\nbeliefs. The third, stemming from Lenzen (1978), captures the notion\nthat beliefs are held with some kind of conviction: if something is\nbelieved, it is believed to be known. \nThough the interaction principles KB1KB3 may look innocent on their\nown, they may lead to counterintuitive conclusions when combined with\nspecific logics of knowledge and belief. First, Voorbraak (1993) shows\nthat combining 5 for knowledge and D for belief with KB1, implies\nthat \nis a theorem of the resulting logic. Assuming that knowledge is\ntruthful, this theorem entails that agents cannot believe to know\nsomething which happens to be false. \nIf additionally KB3 is added, the notions of knowledge and belief\ncollapse. I.e., it may be proven that\n\\(B_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}\\varphi\\), which, in combination with\nKB1 entails that \nHence, the two notions have collapsed to one. This was stated in 1986,\nby Kraus and Lehmann. \nIf one is not interested in knowledge and belief collapsing, one must\nthus give something up: One cannot have both 5 for knowledge, D for\nbelief and KB1 and KB3 governing their interaction. Again, results\nconcerning correspondence between principles and relation properties\nmay assist: In 1993, van der Hoek showed based on a semantic analysis\nthat where the four principles are jointly sufficient for collapse,\nno subset of them is, too. Giving up any one principle will\nthus eliminate the collapse. Weakening KB1 to hold only for non-modal\nformulas is also sufficient to avoid collapse (cf. Halpern 1996). \nFor more on epistemic interaction principles, the principles .2, .3,\n.3.2. and .4, and relations to so-called conditional beliefs,\nsee Aucher (2014). For an introduction to conditional beliefs and\nrelations to several other types of knowledge from the philosophical\nliterature, see Baltag and Smets (2008). The latter also includes\ndiscussion concerning the interdefinability of various notions, as\ndoes Halpern, Samet, and Segev (2009) for knowledge and\n(non-conditional) belief. \nWe human beings are preoccupied with the epistemic states of other\nagents. In ordinary life, we reason with varying degrees of success\nabout what others know. We are especially concerned with what others\nknow about us, and often specifically about what they know about what\nwe know. \nDoes she know that I know where she buried the treasure? \nDoes she know that I know that she knows? \nAnd so on. \nEpistemic logic can reveal interesting epistemic features of systems\ninvolving groups of agents. In some cases, for example, emergent\nsocial phenomena depend on agents reasoning in particular ways about\nthe knowledge and beliefs of other agents. As we have seen,\ntraditional systems of epistemic logic applied only to single-agent\ncases. However, they can be extended to groups or multi-agent systems\nin a relatively straightforward manner. \nAs David Lewis noted in his book Convention (1969) many\nprominent features of social life depend on agents assuming that the\nrules of some practice are matters of common knowledge. For\nexample, drivers know that a red traffic light indicates that they\nshould stop at an intersection. However, for the convention of traffic\nlights to be in place at all, it is first necessary that drivers must\nalso know that other drivers know that red means\nstop. In addition, drivers must also know that everyone knows\nthat everyone knows that …. The conventional role of traffic\nlights relies on all drivers knowing that all drivers know the rule,\nthat the rule is a piece of\n common knowledge. \nA variety of norms, social and linguistic practices, agent\ninteractions and games presuppose common knowledge, first formalized\nby Aumann (1976) and with earliest epistemic logical treatments by\nLehmann (1984) and by Halpern and Moses (1984). In order to see how\nepistemic logic sheds light on these phenomena, it is necessary to\nintroduce a little more formalism. Following the standard treatment\n(see, e.g., Fagin et al. 1995), we can syntactically augment the\nlanguage of propositional logic with n knowledge operators, one\nfor each agent involved in the group of agents under consideration.\nThe primary difference between the semantics given for a mono-agent\nand a multi-agent semantics is roughly that n accessibility\nrelations are introduced. A modal system for n agents is\nobtained by joining together n modal logics where for\nsimplicity it may be assumed that the agents are homogenous in the\nsense that they may all be described by the same logical system. An\nepistemic logic for n agents consists of n copies of a\ncertain modal logic. In such an extended epistemic logic it is\npossible to express that some agent in the group knows a certain fact\nthat an agent knows that another agent knows a fact etc. It is\npossible to develop the logic even further: Not only may an agent know\nthat another agent knows a fact, but they may all know this fact\nsimultaneously. \nTo represent knowledge for a set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) of n agents,\nfirst let’s stipulate a language. Let \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) be\ngiven by the Backus-Naur form \nTo represent knowledge for all n agents jointly in pointed\nKripke models, all that is needed is to add suitably many\nrelations: \nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) is a tuple\n\\((M,w)=(W,\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}},V,w)\\) where \nTo also incorporate beliefs, simply apply the same move as in the\nsingle agent case: augment the language and let there be two relations\nfor each agent. \nThe definition uses a family of relations\n\\(\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\). In the literature, the same is\ndenoted \\((W,R_{i},V,w)_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\). Alternatively, R\nis taken to be a function sending agents to relations, i.e.,\n\\(R:\\mathcal{A\\rightarrow}\\mathcal{P}(W\\times W)\\). Then for each\n\\(i\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), \\(R(i)\\) is a relation on W, often denoted\n\\(R_{i}\\). These are stylistic choices. \nWhen considering only a single agent, it is typically not relevant to\ninclude more worlds in W than there are possible valuations of\natoms. In multi-agent cases, this is not the case: to express the\ndifferent forms of available higher-order knowledge, many copies of\n“the same” world are needed. Let us exemplify for\n\\(\\mathcal{A}=\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\textit{Atom}=\\{p\\}\\) and each\n\\(R_{i},i\\in\\mathcal{A},\\) an equivalence relation. Let us represent\nthat both a and b know p, but b does not\nknow that a knows p , i.e., \\(K_{a}p\\wedge\nK_{b}p\\wedge\\neg K_{b}K_{a}p\\). Then we need three worlds: \nIf we try to let \\(w_{1}\\) play the role of \\(w_{2}\\), then a\nwould lose knowledge in p: both p worlds are needed. In\ngeneral, if W is assumed to have any fixed, finite size, there\nwill be some higher-order information formula that cannot be satisfied\nin it. \nMulti-agent systems are interesting for other reasons than to\nrepresent higher-order information. The individual agents’\ninformation may also be pooled to capture what the agents know\njointly, as group knowledge (see Baltag, Boddy, & Smets 2018 for a\nrecent discussion). A standard notion is this style is distributed\nknowledge: The knowledge the group would have if the\nagents share all their individual knowledge. To represent it, augment\nthe language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) with operators  \nto make \\(D_{G}\\varphi\\) a well-formed formula. Where\n\\(G\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}\\) is a group of agents, the formula\n\\(D_{G}\\varphi\\) reads that it is distributed knowledge in the\ngroup G that \\(\\varphi\\). \nTo evaluate \\(D_{G}\\varphi\\), we define a new relation from those\nalready present in the model. The idea behind the definition is that\nif some one agent has eliminated a world as an epistemic alternative,\nthen so will the group. Define the relation as the intersection of the\nindividual agents’ relations: \nIn the three state model, \\(R_{G}^{D}\\) contains only the three loops.\nTo evaluate a distributed knowledge formula, use the same form as for\nother modal operators:  \nIt may be the case that some very knowing agent knows all that is\ndistributed knowledge in G, but it is not guaranteed. To\ncapture that all the agents know \\(\\varphi\\), we could use the\nconjunction of the formulas \\(K_{i}\\varphi\\) for \\(\\in\\mathcal{A}\\),\ni.e., \\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\). This is a\nwell-defined formula if \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is finite (which it typically\nis). If \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is not finite, then\n\\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\) is not a formula in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\), as it has only finite conjunctions. As a\nshorthand for \\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\), it is\nstandard to introduce the everybody knows operator,\n\\(E_{G}\\): \nIn the three world model, \\(K_{a}p\\wedge K_{b}p\\), so\n\\(E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\). \nThat everybody knows something does not mean that this knowledge is\nshared between the members of the group. The three world model\nexemplifies this: Though \\(E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\), it also the case that\n\\(\\neg K_{b}E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\). \nTo capture that there is no uncertainty in the group about \\(\\varphi\\)\nnor any higher-order uncertainty about \\(\\varphi\\) being\nknown by all agents, no formula in the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\)\nis enough. Consider the formula  \nwhere \\(E_{G}^{k}\\) is short for k iterations of the \\(E_{G}\\)\noperator. Then for no natural number k will the formula\n\\(E_{G}^{k}\\varphi\\) be enough: it could be the case that b\ndoesn’t know it! To rectify this situation, one could try  \nbut this is not a formula as \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) only contains finite\nconjunctions. \nHence, though the \\(E_{G}\\) operator is definable in the language\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\), a suitable notion of common knowledge\nis not. For that, we again need to define a new relation on our model.\nThis time, we are interested in capturing that nobody considers\n\\(\\varphi\\) epistemically possible anywhere. To build the\nrelation, we therefore first take the union the relations of all the\nagents in G, but this is not quite enough: to use the standard\nmodal semantic clause, we must also be able to reach all of the worlds\nin this relation in a single step. Hence, let  \nwhere \\((\\cdotp)^{*}\\) is the operation of taking the transitive\nclosure. If R is a relation, then \\((R)^{*}\\) is R\nplus all the pairs missing to make R a transitive relation.\nConsider the three world model: With the relation\n\\(\\bigcup_{i\\in\\{a,b\\}}R_{i}\\), we can reach \\(w_{3}\\) from \\(w_{1}\\)\nin two steps, stopping over at \\(w_{2}\\). With\n\\((\\bigcup_{i\\in\\{a,b\\}}R_{i})^{*}\\), \\(w_{3}\\) is reachable in one\nstep: By the newly added transitive link from \\(w_{1}\\) to\n\\(w_{3}\\). \nTo represent common knowledge, augment the Backus-Naur form\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) with operators  \nto make \\(C_{G}\\varphi\\) a well-formed formula. Evaluate such formulas\nby the semantic clause  \nVarying the properties of the accessibility relations\n\\(R_{1},R_{2},\\ldots,R_{n}\\), as described above results in different\nepistemic logics. For instance system K with common\nknowledge is determined by all frames, while system\nS4 with common knowledge is determined by all\nreflexive and transitive frames. Similar results can be obtained for\nthe remaining epistemic logics (Fagin et al. 1995). For more, consult\n the entry on common knowledge. \nThe principal complaint against the approach taken by epistemic\nlogicians is that it is committed to an excessively idealized picture\nof human reasoning. Critics have worried that the relational semantics\nof epistemic logic commits one to a closure property for an\nagent’s knowledge that is implausibly strong given actual human\nreasoning abilities. The closure properties give rise to what has come\nto be called the problem of logical omniscience: \nWhenever an agent c knows all of the formulas in a set\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and A follows logically from \\(\\Gamma\\),\nthen c also knows A. \nIn particular, c knows all theorems (letting\n\\(\\Gamma=\\emptyset\\)), and knows all the logical consequences of any\nformula that the agent knows (letting \\(\\Gamma\\) consist of a single\nformula). The concern here is that finite agents are constrained by\nlimits on their cognitive capacities and reasoning abilities.\n The account of knowledge and belief that epistemic logic seems\ncommitted to involves superhuman abilities like knowing all the\ntautologies. Thus, the concern is that epistemic logic is simply\nunsuited to capturing actual knowledge and belief as these notions\nfigure in ordinary human life. \nHintikka recognized a discrepancy between the rules of epistemic logic\nand the way the verb “to know” is ordinarily used already\nin the early pages of Knowledge and Belief. He pointed out\nthat  \nit is clearly inadmissible to infer “he knows that\nq” from “he knows that p” solely on\nthe basis that q follows logically from p, for the\nperson in question may fail to see that p entails q,\nparticularly if p and q are relatively complicated\nstatements. (1962: 30-31)  \nHintikka’s first reaction to what came to be called the problem\nof logical omniscience was to see the discrepancy between ordinary\nusage of terms like “consistency” and formal treatments of\nknowledge as indicating a problem with our ordinary terminology. If a\nperson knows the axioms of a mathematical theory but is unable to\nstate the distant consequences of the theory, Hintikka denied that it\nis appropriate to call that person inconsistent.  In ordinary\nhuman affairs, Hintikka claimed, the charge of inconsistency when\ndirected towards an agent has the connotation of being irrational or\ndishonest.  Thus, from Hintikka’s perspective we should\nchoose some other term to capture the situation of someone who is\nrational and amenable to persuasion or correction but not logically\nomniscient. Non-omniscient, rational agents can be in a position to\nsay that “I know that p but I don’t know whether\nq” even in case q can p. He then suggests\nthat q should be regarded as defensible given the\nagent’s knowledge and the denial of q should be regarded\nas indefensible. This choice of terminology was criticized\ninsofar as it attaches the pejorative indefensible to some\nset of proposition, even though the fault actually lies in the\nagent’s cognitive capacities (Chisholm 1963; Hocutt 1972; Jago\n2007). \nHintikka’s early epistemic logic can be understood as a way of\nreasoning about what is implicit in an agent’s knowledge even in\ncases where the agent itself is unable to determine what is implicit.\nSuch an approach risks being excessively idealized and its relevance\nfor understanding human epistemic circumstances can be challenged on\nthese grounds. \nFew philosophers were satisfied with Hintikka’s attempt to\nrevise our ordinary use of the term “consistent” as he\npresented it in Knowledge and Belief.  However, he and\nothers soon provided more popular ways of dealing with logical\nomniscience. In the 1970s responses to the problem of logical\nomniscience introduced semantical entities that explain why the agent\nappears to be, but in fact is not really guilty of logical\nomniscience. Hintikka called these entities “impossible possible\nworlds” (1979; see also the entry on\n impossible worlds\n and Jago 2014). The basic idea is that an agent may mistakenly count\namong the worlds consistent with its knowledge, some worlds containing\nlogical contradictions. The mistake is simply a product of the\nagent’s limited resources; the agent may not be in a position to\ndetect the contradiction and may erroneously count them as genuine\npossibilities. In some respects, this approach can be understood as an\nextension of the aforementioned response to logical omniscience that\nHintikka had already outlined in Knowledge and Belief. \nIn the same spirit, entities called “seemingly possible”\nworlds are introduced by Rantala (1975) in his urn-model analysis of\nlogical omniscience. Allowing impossible possible worlds or seemingly\npossible worlds in which the semantic valuation of the formulas is\narbitrary to a certain extent provides a way of making the appearance\nof logical omniscience less threatening. After all, on any realistic\naccount of epistemic agency, the agent is likely to consider (albeit\ninadvertently) worlds in which the laws of logic do not hold. Since no\nreal epistemic principles hold broadly enough to encompass impossible\nand seemingly possible worlds, some conditions must be applied to\nepistemic models such that they cohere with epistemic principles (for\ncriticism of this approach see Jago 2007: 336-337). \nAlternatively to designing logics in which the knowledge operators do\nnot exhibit logical omniscience, awareness logic offers an\nalternative: Change the interpretation of \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) from\n“a knows that \\(\\varphi\\)” to “a\nimplicitly knows that \\(\\varphi\\)” and take\nexplicit knowledge that \\(\\varphi\\) to be implicit knowledge\nthat \\(\\varphi\\) and awareness of \\(\\varphi\\). With awareness\nnot closed under logical consequence, such a move allows for notion of\nexplicit knowledge not logically omniscient. As agents neither have to\ncompute their implicit knowledge nor can they be held responsible for\nanswering queries based on it, logical omniscience is problematic only\nfor explicit knowledge, the problem of logical omniscience is\nthus averted. Though logical omniscience is an epistemological\ncondition for implicit knowledge, the agent itself may actually fail\nto realize this condition. For more on awareness logic, see, e.g., the\nseminal Fagin & Halpern (1987) or Velazquez-Quesada (2011) and\nSchipper (2015) for overviews. \nDebates about the various kinds of idealization involved in epistemic\nlogic are ongoing in both philosophical and interdisciplinary\ncontexts.","contact.mail":"johnsymons@ku.edu","contact.domain":"ku.edu"}]
