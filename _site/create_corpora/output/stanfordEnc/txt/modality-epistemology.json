For example, while there are in fact eleven players on a\nsoccer team, there could have been thirteen, though there\ncouldn’t have been zero. The first of these is a fact about what\nis actual; the second is a fact about what was possible, and the third\nis a fact about what is impossible. Humans are often disposed to\nconsider, make, and evaluate judgments about what is possible and\nnecessary, such as when we are motivated to make things better and\nimagine how things might be. We judge that things could have been\ndifferent than they actually are, while other things could not have\nbeen. These modal judgments and modal claims therefore play a central\nrole in human decision-making and in philosophical argumentation. This\nentry is about the justification we have for modal judgments.\n\n\nMost of the time, we encounter what might be called ordinary\nmodal judgments, such as the following:\n\nAlthough I am a philosopher, I could have been a\nmusician.\n\nNot only does 2 + 2 = 4, it is necessary that 2 + 2 =\n4.\n\nNot only is it the case that nothing is red and green all over at\nthe same time, it is impossible for something to be red and\ngreen all over at the same time.\n\nAlthough the table is not broken, it could have been\nbroken.\n\nEven though the cup is on the left side of the table, it\ncould have been on the right side.\n\nHowever, philosophers often, in the course of an argument, formulate\nwhat might be called extraordinary modal judgements; these\ntypically are about some special philosophical concept relevant to the\ndiscussion. Here are some examples:\n\n\nSt. Anselm\n\nNecessarily: God exists.\n\n\nDescartes\n\nIt is possible for the mind to exist without the body.\n\n\nBerkeley\n\nIt is impossible for anything to exist unperceived.\n\n\nNow a modal argument is one in which either a premise or the\nconclusion is an ordinary or an extraordinary modal judgment. Thus, in\nmodal arguments, we reason about what is necessary, possible, or\nimpossible, or about what might, must, or could not be the case. Modal\narguments can therefore be found both inside and outside of philosophy\n(within philosophy many important philosophical positions are in fact\nmodal positions). Assuming that a modal argument is valid (i.e., the\npremises validly imply the conclusion), then the evaluation of a modal\nargument focuses on whether the premises are justified. The question\nthen arises: how does one show that a modal premise of a modal\nargument is justified?\n\n\nPhilosophers have long been interested in how a modal claim can be\nknown, justified, or understood. The philosophy of modality is the\narea in which one studies the metaphysics, semantics, epistemology,\nand logic of modal claims—that is, claims about what is\nnecessary, possible, contingent, essential, and accidental.\nEpistemology is the general area of philosophy in which one studies\nthe nature of knowledge. The central questions of epistemology\nconcern: (i) what it is to know something, (ii) what it is to be\njustified in believing something, (iii) what it is to understand\nsomething, and (iv) what are the means by which we can come to possess\nunderstanding, justification, or knowledge. Within the philosophy of\nmodality one finds the sub-discipline known as the epistemology of\nmodality. The central question of this field is:\n\n\nHow can we come to know (be justified in believing or understand)\nwhat is necessary, possible, contingent, essential, and accidental for\nthe variety of entities and kinds of entities there are?\n\n\n\nThis is similar to the central questions found in the epistemology of\nmathematics and morality, where one inquires into, the nature of\nmathematical knowledge or moral knowledge. Special interest in modal\nepistemology (another name for the epistemology of modality) often\nderives from the following contrast between knowledge of the actual\nand knowledge of what could have been and could not have been the\ncase.\n\n\nIn general, perception of the actual world can guide us to knowledge\nof realized possibilities, possibilities that are actual. For\nmost philosophers hold that given that what is actual is possible,\nknowledge of actuality can inform us of knowledge of some\npossibilities. However, actuality appears to be an\ninsufficient guide to what is: (a) merely possible,\nsince the possibility is not realized, or (b) impossible,\nsince what is actually the case does not tell us what could not be\nthe case. To better understand this phenomenon, consider a cup,\n\\(c\\), located at \\(L\\) at time \\(t\\). The following line of reasoning\nillustrates the central question and its special interest in the case\nof ordinary possibilities.\n\nActual world fact: \\(c\\) is at \\(L\\) at \\(t\\), and \\(S\\)\nperceives that \\(c\\) is at \\(L\\) at \\(t\\).\n\nKnowledge of actuality: \\(S\\) knows that \\(c\\) is at \\(L\\), since\n\\(S\\) perceives \\(c\\) at \\(L\\) and there is no reason for \\(S\\) to\nbelieve that their perception of \\(c\\) at \\(L\\) is misguided.\n\nActuality-to-Possibility Principle: If \\(P\\) is actually true,\nthen \\(P\\) is possibly true, since realized possibilities are evidence\nof possibility.\n\nKnowledge of Realized Possibilities: \\(S\\) can know that it is\npossible for \\(c\\) to be at \\(L\\) through derivation from the\nactuality-to-possibility principle and perception of the actual world\nfact.\n\nNon-Actual/Unrealized Possibility Datum: \\(c\\) could have been at\n\\(L^*\\), a location distinct from \\(L\\), at \\(t\\).\n\n\\(S\\) believes that \\(c\\) could have been at \\(L^*\\) at \\(t\\), and\n\\(S\\) can come to know that \\(c\\) could have been at \\(L^*\\) at\n\\(t\\).\n\nEpistemic Question: How does \\(S\\) know that \\(c\\) could have been\nat \\(L^*\\) at \\(t\\)?\n\nWith respect to the epistemic question, all of the following have been\nproposed as potential answers:\n\n Perception: even though \\(c\\) is not at \\(L^*\\). \\(S\\)\nsees that \\(c\\) could be at \\(L^*\\).\n\nIntuition: even though \\(c\\) is not at \\(L^*\\), \\(S\\) has\na non-sensory based intuition that \\(c\\) could be at \\(L^*\\) when\n\\(S\\) entertains the question: could \\(c\\) have been at \\(L^*\\)?\n\n Conceivability: \\(S\\) can conceive of a scenario in\nwhich \\(c\\) is at \\(L^*\\). \\(S\\) derives justification for believing\nthat \\(c\\) can be at \\(L^*\\) from conceiving of it.\n\n Imaginability: Were \\(S\\) to imagine a process whereby\n\\(c\\) moved from \\(L\\) to \\(L^*\\), \\(S\\) would not arrive at a\ncontradiction. So, \\(S\\) is justified in believing that \\(c\\) could\nhave been at \\(L^*\\) on the basis of imagining the movement.\n\n Deduction: \\(S\\) can deduce from knowledge of what \\(c\\)\nis fundamentally and the relevant details about location \\(L^*\\) that\n\\(c\\) could have been at \\(L^*\\), since what \\(c\\) is fundamentally is\nnot incompatible with it being at \\(L^*\\).\n\n Theory: From \\(S\\)’s knowledge of what \\(c\\) is,\nas well as the relevant facts about the location of \\(L^*\\), \\(S\\) can\ncome to know that \\(c\\) could have been at \\(L^*\\).\n\nSimilarity: From \\(S\\)’s prior observation of\nobjects relevantly similar to \\(c\\), as well as their actual locations\nand movement, \\(S\\) can come to know that \\(c\\) could have been at\n\\(L^*\\).\n\nIn addition to these theories, one overarching idea is that they can\neither be offered as part of a uniformity account or as part of a\nnon-uniformity account of modal knowledge. The uniformity\nview holds that there is only one single route to modal knowledge\nat the most fundamental level of explanation. The\nnon-uniformity view maintains either that different\npeople can come to know the same modal truth through different routes\nor that at the fundamental level of investigation there must be more\nthan one route to modal knowledge.\n\n\nIn addition to the central question there are three other main\nquestions of interest.\n\n\nModal Sorting:\n\nhow can we knowledgeably sort necessary truths from essential truths\nand contingent truths? \n\n\nAt least one point of interest in the sorting question derives from\nwork in the metaphysics of modality. Necessity and possibility are\ninterdefinable, \\(P\\) is necessary when it is not possible that\nnot-\\(P\\). However, some such as Fine (1994), have argued that essence\ncannot be defined in terms of necessity. This leads us to the\nquestion: how can we sort the essential from the necessary?\n\n\nModal Skepticism:\n\nwhat are the limits of modal knowledge? \n\n\nAt least one point of interest in the skeptical question derives from\nwork on the range of modal knowledge. All theories of modal knowledge\nshould be able to account for ordinary cases. However, some, such as\nVan Inwagen (1998), have presented skeptical arguments about extending\nmodal knowledge to a variety of exotic philosophical claims. \n\n\nModal Architecture/Epistemic Priority:\n\ngiven that there is a distinction between necessity, possibility, and\nessence, is knowledge of one more fundamental than knowledge\nof the others? For example is our knowledge of necessity more\nfundamental than our knowledge of possibility and essence, and\nadditionally a pathway to our knowledge of both possibility and\nessence? \n\n\nAt least one point of interest in the architecture/epistemic priority\nquestion derives from work on the proper route to modal knowledge. Bob\nHale (2003) has drawn an important distinction between necessity-first\nand possibility-first approaches to modal knowledge. A necessity-first\napproach holds that we first arrive at knowledge of necessary truths,\nand then derive knowledge of possibility through compatibility with\nknowledge of necessity. A possibility-first approach holds that we\nfirst arrive at knowledge of possible truths, and then aim to\ndetermine what necessary truths hold.\n\n\nIt is important to take note of two points about general inquiry in\nthe epistemology of modality. First, the field is typically concerned\nwith investigating (i) alethic modality (modality concerned with what\ncould have been true), as opposed to epistemic modality (modality\nconcerned with what might be true in an epistemic sense of\n“might”) or deontic modality (modality concerned with what\nmight be done in some normative or evaluative sense). Second, (ii) the\ninvestigation centers on metaphysical modality, as opposed to logical\nor physical modality.\n\n\nFor those that accept the reality of metaphysical inquiry,\nmetaphysical modality is often understood as being the\nmodality concerned with metaphysics as opposed to logical modality,\nwhich concerns itself with logical relations or physical modality,\nwhich concerns itself with physical relations. In addition, on the\nstandard model of the relation between these kinds of\nmodalities the logical possibilities are the most inclusive; they\ninclude any proposition that sheer logic leaves open, no matter how\notherwise impossible it might be. The metaphysical possibilities are\nthe logical possibilities that are also allowed by the natures of all\nof the things that could have existed. The physical possibilities are\nthe logical and metaphysical possibilities that are also allowed by\nthe physical laws of nature. On the standard model, the following\nnesting relation holds:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis entry will focus on a selection of theories in the epistemology\nof modality.\n\nContemporary analytical debates in the epistemology of modality often\ntake Saul Kripke’s (1971, 1980) defense of a posteriori\nnecessities (necessities that are knowable only through sense\nexperience, and not by way of abstract reflection alone) and his\ndeduction model of how we arrive at knowledge of them as a point of\ndeparture. In order to better understand what an a posteriori\nnecessity is, it will be important to first introduce the central\nidea of possible worlds semantics (PWS). Consider the following\nclaims: \nPossible worlds are complete alternative realities; they are ways that\nthe whole of reality might have been. Philosophers have various\ntheories of their nature. (For more about them see the\n possible worlds entry.)\n With (PWS) in place an a posteriori necessity is a statement\nthat is true in all possible worlds, and what makes it a\nposteriori is that it is knowable only by empirical\ninvestigation of the actual world. The two most commonly\ndiscussed examples are the necessity of Hesperus being identical with\nPhosphorus, and the necessity of water being identical to\nH2O. The former case concerns the celestial body Venus,\nwhich is picked out by both “Hesperus” and\n“Phosphorus”. The latter example has to do with\ntheoretical identifications in science, cases in which scientists\nprovide a theoretical identification of a natural kind, such as water,\ngold, light, or heat by capturing its underlying nature or essence\nthrough scientific investigation. \nIt is uncontroversial that we did, and could only have, come to know\nthat Hesperus = Phosphorus or that water is identical to\nH2O through empirical discovery. However, controversially,\nit is argued by Kripke that these claims involve (a) identity\nstatements between rigid designators (terms that pick out the\nsame thing in all possible worlds in which they have reference), and\n(b) because they are identity statements between rigid designators,\nthe entities they pick out will be identical in all possible worlds in\nwhich the terms have reference. His arguments rely in part on his\nproof of the necessity of identity. Historically, a posteriori\nnecessities were thought to be theoretically impossible. This is\nlargely due to the work of Kant, in his Critique of Pure\nReason, and subsequent empiricists, such as A.J. Ayer, that\ncritiqued Kant’s view. Originally, Kant thought that there could\nbe both analytic (non-informative) and synthetic (informative) a\npriori truths. Later empiricists argued that the class of\nsynthetic a priori truths (“synthetic” roughly in\nthat they are genuinely informative, not self-evident, and\n“a priori” roughly in that they are known on the\nbasis of purely rational reflections) was incoherent. (For more about\na priori justification see the\n entry on a priori justification and knowledge).\n As a consequence of these arguments, in the mid 20th\ncentury many philosophers thought that the following equivalences were\ntrue: \nKripke’s 1970 lectures, later published as Naming and\nNecessity (1980), provided a serious challenge to both (i) and\n(ii). Where “\\(\\Box\\)” stands for “it is necessary\nthat”, in his (1971) he offered the following picture of how we\ncan arrive at knowledge of an a posteriori necessity: \nFirst, it is argued that some sort of fact is necessary, if true: \\((P\n\\rightarrow \\Box P)\\). \nSecond, that the relevant fact is known to be true by empirical\ninvestigation: P. \nThird, by deduction from (1) and (2) we arrive at a necessary truth,\n\\(\\Box P\\), that is known a posteriori because empirical\ninvestigation is how the premise P is known. \nThe first premise in the deduction of an a posteriori\nnecessity involves some necessity-generating principle, a principle\nthat moves from some sort of fact, typically a non-modal fact, to the\nclaim that the fact is necessary. Kripke thought that these principles\nwere usually arrived at through a priori philosophical\nreflection. Plausible, and often discussed, examples of\nnecessity-generating principles are: \nThe second premise in the deduction of an a posteriori\nnecessity is a specific a posteriori truth, a truth that is\ndiscovered on the basis of empirical investigation. Given the examples\nabove, the relevant claims would be that, in fact: water =\nH2O, t originates from m, Sheba\noriginates from g, t is a material object, Sheba is\na biological kind, and Sheba is a human. \nFrom the first and second step a specific a posteriori\nnecessity is deduced. For example: necessarily water = H2\nO, necessarily the table originates from its original wood,\nnecessarily Sheba originates from g, necessarily the table is\na material object, necessarily Sheba is a biological kind, and\nnecessarily Sheba is a human. In general, learning a conclusion by an\nargument is a species of a posteriori knowledge just in case\nat least one premise is known a posteriori. In sum, even\nthough the deduction of an a posteriori necessity involves,\nas Kripke claims, an a priori known necessity generating\nprinciple, because the important fact is known a posteriori,\nthe conclusion is both necessary and a posteriori. \nAs a generalization of Kripke’s model it should be noted that\nthere is no reason why one could not come to know a necessary truth\nthrough pure a priori deduction. For example, consider the\nfollowing: \ntherefore  \nIn this case, if (1) and (2) can be known a priori, the\nconclusion drawn on the basis of (1) and (2), will be an a priori\nnecessity.  \nIn addition to Kripke’s seminal work, there are four epistemic\nissues in the epistemology of modality that are frequently discussed.\nThe first two are reactions to Kripke’s work, which challenge\nthe success of his reasoning. The latter two derive from\nconsiderations concerning the structure of possible worlds\nsemantics. \nIt is prima facie plausible to think that all modal knowledge\nis in principle a priori, since at least perception of\nactuality cannot provide one with knowledge of mere possibility and\nnecessity. For example, if conceivability is taken to be an a\npriori exercise, and it is linked to possibility, then it is\nplausible to think that a priori conceiving that P\nprovides one with a priori justification for believing that\nP is possible. Likewise, finding P inconceivable\nprovides one with a priori evidence that P is\nimpossible. While this might seem to be the only way that\nsuch knowledge can be discovered, this simple thought is challenged by\nKripke’s arguments for the existence of a posteriori\nnecessities. The problem is discussed in detail in Yablo’s\n(1993): Is Conceivability a Guide to Possibility? One of the\nmain problems facing contemporary a priori accounts of the\nepistemology of modality concerns the existence of a posteriori\nnecessities. Recall that an a posteriori necessity is a\nstatement, such as the identity statement “Water =\nH2O”, that is metaphysically necessary, yet knowable\nonly a posteriori. As a consequence, a priori\naccounts face the following potential situation: \n(1)–(3) forces an initial question: if there are a\nposteriori necessities, how can one have a priori\nknowledge of modality? Sure one might be able to have it in cases of\npure a priori reasoning, such as with respect to mathematical\nknowledge. But how can one’s a priori conceiving of a\nsituation in which, for example, water is present without hydrogen\nprovide one with evidence, sufficient for knowledge, for the claim:\nit is possible for water to be present without hydrogen? For\nall one knows they have conceived of a situation or were able to\nconceive of a situation in which P appears to hold because\nthey do not know the relevant facts which make P\ninconceivable, since those facts are only knowable a\nposteriori. Surely one can conceive of a situation in which water\ndoes not contain hydrogen, if they simply fail to know that water is\nH2O. But why consider that situation to be a situation in\nwhich water is present, as opposed to some superficially\nsimilar substance? \nThe initial question is explored in further detail in the literature\nalong side the following questions. Given that knowledge is distinct\nfrom justification, and is also a stronger relation than\njustification, do a posteriori necessities pose a problem for\na priori justification about modal truths or only for a\npriori knowledge? Do a posteriori necessities render\na priori reasoning merely fallible or also completely\nunreliable? \nVan Inwagen (1998), taking note of Yablo’s (1993) account of\nwhat it is to conceive something, discusses what has come to be a\nfundamental challenge for theories involving conceivability and\nimaginability. The problem presented by van Inwagen is related to the\nproblem of a posteriori necessities. Van Inwagen’s goal\nis to present a limited form of skepticism about modal knowledge. He\nis not a skeptic about all modal knowledge. His position is that we\nhave a lot of ordinary modal knowledge concerning practical,\nscientific, and mathematical matters, but perhaps limited\nextraordinary modal knowledge. Extraordinary modal knowledge\nconcerns matters on the periphery of scientific investigation or in\nthe realm of metaphysical debate. He argues for his skepticism about\nextraordinary modal knowledge on the basis of an analogy with\njudgments of distance by the naked eye. He maintains that in a range\nof cases, naked-eye judgments of distance are reliable, though\nfallible; and likewise in a range of cases, modal judgments about\nordinary practical matters and scientific matters are also reliable,\nthough fallible. However, he argues that just as judgments of distance\nby the naked eye break down in certain cases, judgments about\nextraordinary modal claims based on conceiving or imagining a\nsituation that appears to verify a statement equally break down. The\nmain issue concerns how we can be confident that we have conceived\nthings to the relevant level of depth required for the scenario to\nactually be a presentation or manifestation of a genuine\npossibility. \nGiven a particular statement S, van Inwagen raises the\nquestion: how does one know that the relevant depth of the scenario\nthey have imagined is sufficient to ground the truth of the statement\nS? For example, conceiving of a situation in which\nmathematicians announce that a theorem has been proved is not\nsufficient for believing that the theorem is provable, since we can\neasily conceive of impossibilities being announced as proven by\nmathematicians. It would appear that what is required is for one to\nconceive of the proof itself or something in the vicinity of it that\nleads to a proof. With reference to the example of water, one might\nsay that the reason one found the statement water is present\nwithout hydrogen conceivable is that one had not conceived of the\nscenario in sufficient enough detail. The appearance of possibility is\nexplained by a failure to have the relevant depth of detail.\nConceiving of a liquid and supposing that hydrogen is not a component\nof it does not constitute the relevant depth of detail. Much more\nwould appear to be required, such as conceiving of how the liquid\nwould still boil at its normal temperature without hydrogen. The\ngeneral problem of conceiving to the relevant depth is exacerbated\nwhen our judgments concern extraordinary modal claims where we are\nperhaps less confident about what relevant details would need to be in\nplace for a coherent scenario to reveal a genuine possibility rather\nthan a mere appearance of possibility. For example, what grounds our\nconfidence that we have conceived of a mind without a body simply by\nconceiving of consciousness without a body being present? For\ninstance, one could imagine that someone is consciously thinking about\nsomething while just affirming abstractly that no body is present\nwhere the thinking occurs. But is that sufficient? Perhaps much more\ndetail is required to verify that we have conceived of consciousness\nwithout materiality. \nThe challenge van Inwagen sets for modal epistemology is the\nfollowing: how does one know (or how can one be confident) that one\nhas reached sufficient detail in the scenario they have imagined so as\nto have included in it the truth of the claim in question rather than\nan unreliable sign of the truth? Geirsson (2005) and Hawke (2011) have\nfurther debated the issue discussed by van Inwagen. \nOne fundamental problem in the epistemology of modality stems from\npossible worlds semantics. Recall that (PWS), roughly, is the view\nthat the truth conditions for \nare \nThe core idea is that possibility is truth in some world while\nnecessity is truth in all worlds. The potential problem caused by\npossible worlds semantics is the causal isolation problem.\nThe problem can be formulated as follows: \nRealism:\nRealism about possible worlds in the metaphysics of modality\nmaintains that (i) facts about possible worlds are the truth-makers\nfor modal statements, and (ii) that possible worlds are not causally\nconnected to the actual world, either because a possible world is a\ncomprehensive concrete universe that is causally isolated from our\nworld or because a possible world is an abstract object, and in virtue\nof being an abstract object it has no causes or effects on the actual\nworld. \nCausal Condition:\nX has knowledge of P only if X bears a\ncausal connection to the truth-maker of P. \nIf one accepts Realism and Causal Condition, then\nthere is a prima facie question: How can we ever know\nanything about metaphysical modality if we do not bear a causal\nconnection to the truth-makers of modal statements? \nThe motivation for realism about modality comes from a commitment to\nthe mind-independence of the truth-makers for modal claims. The core\nidea is that what makes a possibility or necessity claim true is not\nsome fact about human minds, but some fact about the entities\nthemselves. “It could have been the case that Rachel has a\nbrother” is true not because Rachel can merely imagine it.\nRather, it is true because something independent of her mind grounds\nthe truth, in the case of (PWS), that independent something is part of\na possible world. \nThe motivation for the causal condition often comes from an\nexamination of cases of perception. When perception provides\nknowledge, part of the explanation appears to be that a causal\nconnection obtains between the subject and the truth-maker of\none’s belief. For example, on some accounts of knowledge, seeing\na fish in a bowl can provide one with knowledge of the fact that there\nis a fish in the bowl, partly in virtue of the fact that there is a\ncausal relation that obtains between a fact in the world and the\nperceiver’s mind. \nIt is important to note that the causal condition has been\nargued by some to be either categorically inappropriate or irrelevant\nas a requirement on a domain that is essentially non-spatio-temporally\nrelated to us. The general idea is that a causal condition is\nappropriate for concrete objects in the spatio-temporal realm, but not\nfor entities outside of the spatio-temporal realm. For discussion of\nthis issue see Lewis (1986). The problem as debated in the\ncontemporary literature for the case of modality finds its most\nexplicit expression in Peacocke’s (1997) discussion of the\nintegration challenge for modality, and his landmark (1999)\nwork Being Known. For further discussion of Peacocke’s\nsolution see Roca-Royes (2010), and for critical discussion of how to\neliminate the challenge see Bueno and Shalkowski (2004, 2014). \nA related worry to the causal isolation problem comes from\nnaturalistic accounts of epistemology that are grounded in the idea\nthat our capacities for knowledge must be consistent with evolutionary\nexplanations of our cognitive capacities. The arguments are aimed at\nthe very possibility of having justification for beliefs about\nmetaphysical modality. The problem is developed most directly by\nNozick (2003: Ch. 3), and depends on two claims: (i) a necessary\ncondition for being justified in believing that P is that a\nsubject have a reliable belief forming module or faculty for the\ndomain in question, and (ii) that evolution by natural selection\nprovides the best explanation for which reliable belief forming\nmechanisms we possess. The Nozickian evolutionary skeptic argues as\nfollows: \nThere are three kinds of claims that the Nozickian skeptic brings\nforth to establish (1): \nAlthough (a)–(c) are controversial. Some initial plausibility\ncan be given to each. \nOne reason to accept (a) is that there is no reason to believe that\nour imagination should be able to track all possibilities. It is\nlikely that our imagination was engineered through evolution to deal\nprimarily with local possibilities in our environment, such as the\npossibility of an object located in one place being located at another\nplace or the possibility of an object moving at one speed moving at a\nmuch faster speed. In dealing with local possibilities, it may not\nhave the capacity to consider all possibilities reliably. \nOne reason to accept (b) is that metaphysical possibility and\nnecessity, as defined as truth in some possible world and truth in all\npossible worlds may itself reduce either to logical possibility and\nnecessity or physical possibility and necessity. For our appearances\nof possibility and necessity to be about metaphysical possibility and\nnecessity it must be the case that the best explanation is that there\nis a unique kind of modality picked out by “metaphysical\nmodality” and that this modality is the best explanation for\nwhat our appearances of possibility and necessity are really about. If\nmetaphysical modality collapses either into logical modality or\nphysical modality, then there is no reason to believe that our\nappearances of possibility and necessity are really about metaphysical\nmodality. \nOne reason to accept (c) is by analogy. Appearances of the world often\npresent things to us in a way that may be better for us to process for\nthe purpose of survival. Take the case of perception. On one account\nof perception and the world, the manifest image of the world as\ncontaining medium-sized objects, such as tables and trees, is false.\nFundamental physics seems to be capable of complete explanations with\nno need for tables and trees, so perhaps they don’t really\nexist.. However, it may be that for human survival it is better for\nus, in perception, such as vision, to see things as medium-sized dry\ngoods, such as tables and trees, since it is easier for us to navigate\nand organize our lives around such macroscopic entities. In addition,\nit may be that there are certain possibilities that we cannot imagine\nsimply because it is better for us either not to be able to see the\npossibility or because the forces that drove evolution pushed our\nminds to a place where taking something to be impossible was better\nthan revealing it to be possible. \nIt is important to note that Nozick’s argument depends on the\nclaim that if there is no reliable module or faculty for detecting\nnecessity, then none of our beliefs about necessity are\njustified. With respect to this assumption one might argue that\nalthough there is no specific faculty for detecting\nnecessity, we are capable of reasoning our way to necessity by way of\nother faculties that we do have. Counterfactual theories of the\nepistemology of modality typically take this approach (see\n section 3\n for discussion) \nRationalist theories, in one way or another, are grounded in the idea\nthat despite the existence of a posteriori necessities, there\nis still a great deal of modal knowledge to be gained through a\npriori means. These views are often not concerned with modal\nknowledge with respect to a priori matters, such as in the\ncase of logic and mathematics. Rather, these views are concerned with\nthe extent to which we can have rational modal knowledge of matters\noutside of logic and mathematics, such as with respect to natural\nkinds or consciousness. The views differ on how much a priori\nknowledge they endorse, and how they account for it. In this section I\nreview David Chalmers’s Modal Rationalism, Christopher\nPeacocke’s Principles of Possibility, E.J. Lowe’s\nSerious Essentialism, and Bob Hale’s\nEssentialism. Important rationalist accounts, not discussed\nhere, are: Laurence Bonjour’s (1998) In Defense of Pure\nReason, George Bealer’s (2002) The Rationalist\nRenaissance, Keith Hossack’s (2007) The Metaphysics of\nKnowledge, Jonathan Ichikawa and Benjamin Jarvis’s (2011)\nRational Imagination and Modal Knowledge, and Christian\nNimtz’s (2012) Conceptual Truths, Strong Possibilities, and\nMetaphysical Necessity. In studying rationalist theories it is\nimportant to note that some theories may not give an explicit answer\nto the central question. Rather, they may give an account of what the\nconnection is between the a priori and the necessary\nor between conceptual truths and necessity; or they\nmay give an account of how intuition is reliable, and then argue that\nmodal knowledge can be gained by way of intuition. The theories below\nare discussed because they aim to directly address the central\nquestion. \nIn a series of papers (1996, 2002, 2010: Ch. 6) David Chalmers\narticulates, defends and responds to a number of objections to the\nview that conceivability entails possibility. Chalmers’s account\nis not the only account of conceivability in the contemporary\nliterature. Both Yablo (1993) and Menzies (1998) provide important\naccounts of conceivability. The main difference between their accounts\nand Chalmers’s is that their views are defenses of evidential\ntheories as opposed to entailment theories. An evidential\naccount aims to show how conceivability provides evidence for\npossibility. An entailment account goes further and aims to\nshow how in specific cases conceivability entails possibility.\nEvidential accounts face the problems posed by the existence of a\nposteriori necessities and the issue of conceiving to the\nrelevant depth of detail. By contrast, Chalmers’s Modal\nRationalism is an entailment account; and thus must go beyond what\nevidential accounts offer. His main positive thesis is: \nWeak Modal Rationalism (WMR):\n\nPrimary Positive Ideal Conceivability entails Primary\nPossibility. \n(WMR) is constructed out of three distinctions: \nThe first distinction pertains to the issue of what kind of reasoning\nhas gone into what one has conceived. A prima facie\nconception is just a person’s initial reaction to a scenario,\nwithout reasoning further about the scenario. Better reasoning often\ngives one reason to doubt a prima facie conception. Ideal\nrational reasoning, by contrast, is reasoning that cannot be weakened\nby further reasoning. When an entailment link between conceivability\nand possibility is to be forged, the kind of reasoning involved has to\nbe ideal. This distinction is used to deal with the problem of\nrelevant-depth. At the level of ideal reasoning the relevant-depth of\ndetail in the scenario has, arguably, been reached. \nThe second distinction pertains to two distinct ways in which one can\nengage in conceiving. Positive conceivability corresponds to actually\nconstructing a scenario. In such a case one constructs a story in\nwhich a proposition can be verified to be true by the available\ndetails given. The story need not be a complete description\nof a scenario, but it must be sufficiently detailed so as to\nverify the statement being considered. By contrast, negative\nconceivability corresponds to not being able to rule out a\ncertain statement. Negative conceivability is often weaker than\npositive conceivability, since it often derives from ignorance of the\nrelevant facts. For example, if one does not know that water is\nidentical to H2O, they may find the statement “water\ndoes not contain hydrogen” conceivable because they cannot rule\nout the statement “water does not contain hydrogen” as\nbeing a priori incoherent. By contrast, conceiving of water\nwithout hydrogen in the positive sense requires constructing a\nscenario in which water is present without hydrogen at the relevant\ndepth of detail required to verify the claim. Arguably, that sort of\nscenario cannot be constructed. \nThe third distinction pertains to two distinct ways in which we can\nevaluate statements across possible worlds. The distinction between\nprimary and secondary conceivability/possibility rests on two\nindependent theories: Epistemic Two-Dimensional Semantics\n(E2-D) and Modal Monism (MM). Each of these theories is at\nthe heart of Chalmers’s impressive contribution to the\nepistemology of modality. For an extended discussion of each see\nChalmers (2004, 2010). For discussion of a related account of\ntwo-dimensional semantics see Jackson (1998, 2004). For an extended\nmore complete discussion of Two-Dimensional Semantics see Schroeter\n(2012). \nThe distinction between primary and secondary conceivability and\npossibility is used to overcome the problem posed by the existence of\na posteriori necessities in a way that allows for an\nentailment link between conceivability and possibility to be forged.\nWhat follows first is an intuitive account, followed by a\nbrief technical account of Chalmers’s modal rationalism. \nConsider the question: Could water have been something other than\nH2O? On (E2-D) there is both a yes answer and a\nno answer depending on how we read the question. \nThe yes answer comes from reading the question as follows:\nwhat would our term “water” have picked out,\nwere we to have applied it to something that looks like water, but\nhas a different chemical composition? That is, we can imagine a\nsubstance that looks like water, plays the actual world water-role,\nbut in fact is some other chemical substance. And, we can imagine\nourselves having used the term “water” to pick out that\nsubstance, rather than H2O. The yes answer comes\nfrom thinking about what “water” would have picked out in\na world where a different substance plays the water-role. \nThe no answer comes from reading the question as follows:\ngiven what water actually is, what could it have been? We\nused the term “water” to pick out a certain substance in\nour environment that plays a certain role. Scientists have discovered\nthat water is identical to H2O. We also have good reason to\nbelieve water is essentially H2O. That is, we hold\nthat water’s fundamental chemical nature reveals the essence of\nwhat water is. Now if we take the essentialist claim seriously, then\nwe cannot imagine a world in which water is not H2O because\nto imagine water is to imagine H2O. The no answer\ncomes from thinking about what variations water can undergo, given\nwhat we have discovered about its essence.  \nThe intuitive explanation is rendered precise through the (E2-D) model\nthat allows for the construction of an a priori link between\nconceivability and possibility by (i) making conceivability and\npossibility primarily a property of statements; (ii) distinguishing\ntwo kinds of intensions governing statements; (iii) acknowledging one\nspace of worlds over which statements are evaluated; and (iv)\ndistinguishing between two kinds of conceivability and possibility for\nstatements corresponding to each of the intensions. Primary\nconceivability and possibility are then argued to allow for an\nentailment between conceivability and possibility. \nThe distinction between primary and secondary intensions has undergone\nseveral revisions and refinements since Chalmers (1996). It is a\ntechnical distinction. For the purposes of discussion and\nunderstanding, here, I will be presenting a brief formal account of\nthe distinction with respect to the core problem posed by a\nposteriori necessities. Where S is a statement the\ndistinction between primary and secondary intensions is the\nfollowing: \nWith the distinction in place the critical question is: how does the\ndistinction between primary and secondary intensions ameliorate the\nproblem posed by the existence of a posteriori necessities so\nas to enable an entailment between conceivability and possibility? To\nshow how the distinction ameliorates the problem, consider the\nfollowing example concerning the identity of Hesperus and Phosphorus.\nAssume, as it is actually the case, that: \nNow suppose a thinker that knows that Hesperus = Phosphorus aims to\nconceive of a scenario \\(S\\) in which Hesperus \\(\\neq\\) Phosphorus in\norder to determine whether it is possible that Hesperus \\(\\neq\\)\nPhosphorus. In constructing \\(S\\) they imagine a scenario in which a\nplanet takes one orbital path and another planet takes a distinct\norbital path. Question: Is \\(S\\) a situation in which one has\nconceived of Hesperus being non-identical to Phosphorus? According to\nKripke the answer is no, because in \\(S\\) one has simply\nconceived of a scenario in which our ordinary means of access to the\nreferent of “Hesperus” and “Phosphorus” are\noccupied by distinct planets. These two planets cannot be Hesperus and\nPhosphorus, because Hesperus = Phosphorus necessarily. \nBy contrast, the story that weak modal rationalism offers is the\nfollowing. \nWhen constructing \\(S\\) we have two options. We can either construct\n\\(S\\) using the names “Hesperus” and\n“Phosphorus” or we can use the descriptions \\(H_1\\) and\n\\(P_1\\). If we use the names and take into consideration the fact that\nHesperus = Phosphorus, then we must come to the conclusion, as Kripke\ndoes, that \\(S\\) is not a situation in which Hesperus \\(\\neq\\)\nPhosphorus. However, if we use the descriptions \\(H_1\\) and \\(P_1\\)\nand ask ourselves the question “what in a given possible world\nanswers to these descriptions?” we may find out that \\(H_1\\) and\n\\(P_1\\) are satisfied by two distinct planets. Why? Because it is not\nnecessary that \\(H_1 = P_1\\). There are possible worlds in which the\nbrightest star seen in the morning is not identical to the brightest\nstar seen in the evening. In short, the fact that “Hesperus =\nPhosphorus” is necessary and knowable only a posteriori\ndoes not block the a priori conceivability of “Hesperus\n\\(\\neq\\) Phosphorus” when we conceive of things only using\n\\(H_1\\) and \\(P_1\\), the descriptions we used to fix the reference of\n“Hesperus” and “Phosphorus” in the actual\nworld. When we conceive of a scenario in which \\(H_1\\) and \\(P_1\\) are\nsatisfied by two distinct planets, we have conceived of a scenario in\nwhich Hesperus \\(\\neq\\) Phosphorus. The idea is that conceiving with\nprimary intensions requires that we ask the question:  \nThis question is distinct from the question:  \nThe former question concerns primary conceivability, the latter\nconcerns secondary conceivability.  \nWith the distinction between primary and secondary intensions in\nplace, Chalmers argues that while primary conceivability does not\nentail secondary possibility because of a posteriori\nnecessities, primary conceivability under the right\ncircumstances—positive ideal rational reflection—entails\nprimary possibility. \nConceivability accounts face a set of general critical questions. \nThe Connection Question: How is conceivability connected to\npossibility? Given that modality is mind-independent and\nconceivability is mind-dependent, how are the two connected such that\nconceivability provides evidence of possibility? The question becomes\nclear when one draws a contrast with perception. Perception, such as\nvision, generally has a connection to the objects that one perceives.\nAnd it is through the causal connection that one can argue that\nperception provides one with justification for believing something\nabout their environment. By contrast, if possible worlds are causally\nisolated from us, how does mind-dependent conceivability provide one\nwith justification for believing that something is mind-independently\npossible? \nThe Dependence Question: Suppose that conceivability does\nprovide justification for believing that something is possible. Does\nit succeed in doing so simply because one possesses a distinct kind of\nmodal or non-modal knowledge that allows for conceivability to operate\nso as to produce justification? For example, does conceivability guide\none to the belief that a round square is impossible simply because one\nknows what squares and circles are, and by examining their definition\none can arrive safely at the conclusion that such objects are\nimpossible? Similarly, does one simply find water in the absence of\nhydrogen possible because one either suppresses the knowledge that\nwater contains hydrogen or one does not know that water does contain\nhydrogen? The dependence question is important because part of the\nepistemology of modality is concerned with the question of modal\narchitecture/epistemic priority: what is the source of modal\nknowledge? Is conceivability an ultimate source of modal\nknowledge, or is it a derivative source of modal knowledge, dependent\non another source, such as knowledge of essence and essential\nproperties? \nThe Conditions Question: suppose that conceivability does\nprovide justification for believing that something is possible. Does\nconceivability ever entail possibility? If it does, what are the\nconditions one must be in for conceivability to entail possibility? Do\nhumans ever instantiate those conditions? For example, in the case of\nChalmers’s weak modal rationalism one might agree that\nconceivability entails possibility in the sense he defends, but\nquestion whether humans are ever in the position of ideal rational\nreflection. See Worley (2003) for discussion. \nThe Direction Question: There are two directions in which\nconceivability can be discussed. \nIt is theoretically possible that the two theses are logically\nindependent. And that one is more reliable than the other. For\nexample, one could argue that inconceivability is a reliable guide to\nimpossibility, while conceivability is a not a reliable guide to\npossibility. \nThe Relational Question: what are the relations between the\nepistemic domain of a priori and a posteriori\nknowledge and the metaphysical domain of necessary, essential, and\ncontingent truths? That is, independently of human cognition, what\nrelations obtain between the epistemological and the metaphysical\ncategories? \nFollowing the work of Benacerraf (1973) in the philosophy of\nmathematics, Christopher Peacocke (1997, 1999) develops an\nepistemology of modality aimed at solving the integration challenge\nfor modality. In general, for a given domain of discourse \\(D\\) the\nintegration challenge for \\(D\\) is the challenge of integrating the\nmetaphysics/semantics of \\(D\\) with an epistemology of \\(D\\) that\nratifies our knowledge of the domain. On the assumption that moderate\nrealism, which maintains that modal truths are mind-independent, is\ntrue for modal claims, the integration challenge for modality is to\nreconcile the mind-independence of modal claims with an epistemology\nthat shows how we can know modal claims even though human thinkers do\nnot bear causal relations to the relevant truth-makers for modal\ntruths. That is, Peacocke aims to solve the causal-isolation problem.\nHe believes that the best way to solve the problem is to adopt\nmoderate rationalism, which  \nIn pursuing moderate rationalism for modality Peacocke develops the\nPrinciples of Possibility account. \nThe central commitment of Peacocke’s account is that for a\nsubject to possess the concept of metaphysical modality is for that\nsubject to have tacit knowledge of a specific set of Principles of\nPossibility that govern their understanding and evaluation of modal\ndiscourse. An individual thinker’s tacit knowledge of the\nPrinciples of Possibility and the role these principles play\nin their modal discourse is modeled on the way in which principles of\ngrammaticality govern how normal adult speakers understand and\nevaluate grammaticality in their native language. The analogy is as\nfollows. \n\\(X\\) understands, evaluates, and makes grammatical claims, such as\n(i) and (ii), because \\(X\\) has tacit knowledge of Principles of\nGrammaticality \\(G_1 \\ldots G_n\\) in virtue of which grammatical\nclaims, such as (i) and (ii), are understood, evaluated and hold\ntrue. \n\\(X\\) understands, evaluates, and is capable of making modal claims,\nsuch as (iii) and (iv), because \\(X\\) has tacit knowledge of\nPrinciples of Possibility in virtue of which modal claims,\nsuch as (iii) and (iv), are understood, evaluated, and hold true. \nSome central claims of the theory are: \nMuch of Peacocke’s project consists in articulating and\ndefending the Principles of Possibility. (For critical\ndiscussion of the Principles of Possibility approach see the\nsymposium on Being Known in Philosophy and\nPhenomenological Research 64(3).) In general, there are two main\ncritical issues that surround the Principles of Possibility.\nOn the one hand, there are issues about circularity. It appears that\nat several places the conception potentially opens itself up to a\ncharge of circularity in virtue of using one kind of modality to\nexplain another kind of modality. For example, genuine possibility is\nexplained via admissibility of assignment. However,\nadmissibility itself is a modal notion. Thus, one could\nquestion whether the modality involved in admissibility is\nproblematic. Peacocke (1999) presents several responses to possible\ncircularity objections. On the other hand, there are issues\nsurrounding the kind of modality that is embraced by the approach. It\nappears that Peacocke’s account acknowledges an actualist\nconception of modality rather than a possibilist conception. An\nactualist maintains that objects, properties and relations that\nactually exist constitute the basis for the construction of all\npossible worlds. A possibilist denies this, maintaining that in some\npossible worlds there are objects, properties, or relations that are\nnot found in the actual world. One might worry that the principles\narticulated in the theory limit the approach to an actualist ontology.\nPeacocke (2002b) presents an extension of his view, which aims at\naccounting for some possibilist claims. \nMore recently, Sonia Roca-Royes (2010) draws attention to a distinct\nkind of circularity problem she calls the revenge of the\nintegration challenge. The basic problem is that on\nPeacocke’s epistemology of modality our knowledge of modality is\nparasitic on our knowledge of constitutive principles, whether these\nprinciples are implicitly or explicitly known. We determine that\nsomething is possible or necessary for an entity in part through our\nknowledge of what is constitutive of the entity. That is, what it is\nto be the kind of thing in question. For example, if we know that\nbeing human is a constitutive property of a given human, such as Tom,\nthen we can come to know that it is impossible for Tom to be\na zebra, but that it is possible for Tom to be born somewhat\nlater than he was actually born. As a consequence of this relation\nbetween the role of constitutive principles and our evaluation of\nspecific modal claims for the purposes of generating modal knowledge,\na comprehensive account of modal knowledge is incomplete without a\npicture of how we come to know the relevant constitutive principles\ninvolved in our evaluations of modal knowledge. Thus, the integration\nchallenge returns when we ask the question: how do we arrive at our\nknowledge, implicit or explicit, of the constitutive principles that\nplay a role in explaining our modal knowledge? This question is\nimportant because arguably in the case of grammaticality there is an\ninnate universal grammar that aids in the acquisition of a local\ngrammar, such as English; by contrast, in the case of modality it\ncould be that no innate universal modal principles exist. Peacocke\nhimself notes the worry,  \nthe provision of a general theory of the constitutive, as opposed to\nthe modal, seems to me to be an urgent task for philosophy. We\ncertainly do not want all the initial puzzlement about modality simply\nto be transferred to the domain of the constitutive. Only a\nsatisfactory general theory of the constitutive, and an attendant\nepistemology, can allay this concern. (Peacocke 1999: 166, fn.37) \nE.J. Lowe (2008a, 2012) and Bob Hale (2013) have independently\ndeveloped accounts of the epistemology of modality based on\nmetaphysical essentialism. The two core theses of metaphysical\nessentialism are: (i) entities have essential properties or\nessences that are not merely dependent on language, and (ii) not all\nnecessary truths capture an essential truth or the essence of an\nentity. Although their views differ at crucial points in the epistemic\nlandscape, the program they share maintains the following: \nMetaphysical Grounding:\n\nThe essential properties or essences of entities are the metaphysical\nground of metaphysical modality. When we look for an explanation of\nwhy something is metaphysically possible or necessary we ultimately\nlook to the essential properties or essences of the entities\ninvolved. \nEpistemic Guide:\n\nThe fundamental pathway to acquiring knowledge of metaphysical\nmodality derives from knowledge of essential properties or essences of\nthe entities involved. When we look for an explanation of how we can\nknow metaphysical modality we ultimately look to our knowledge of\nessential properties or essences as the basis upon which we make\ninferences to metaphysical modality.  \nAs a general point, it is important to note that both Lowe and Hale\ncan be taken to endorse symmetric essentialism, which is the\nview that essence is both the ground and the epistemic pathway to\nmodal knowledge. This view is to be contrasted with asymmetric\nessentialism, which holds that while essence is the ground of\nmodality, it is not the epistemic pathway. An asymmetric essentialist\nholds that our knowledge of necessity is prior to our knowledge of\nessence. And that it is through a special investigation of necessities\nthat we come to possess knowledge of essence by modal sorting. \nFrom a metaphysical point of view both Lowe and Hale share the view\nthat the essential properties of an entity are distinct from the mere\nmetaphysical necessities that are true of the entity. This position is\ninspired by the work of Fine (1994) on the relation between essence\nand metaphysical modality. Fine argues against modal conceptions of\nessence on which it is claimed that an essential property of an\nobject is simply any property the object has in all possible worlds in\nwhich it exists. He offers the following argument against the\nview: \nSimply put, essential properties are more fine-grained than necessary\nproperties. As a consequence, we cannot simply take essential\nproperties or essences to be what an object has in every possible\nworld in which it exists. \nFrom an epistemological point of view both Lowe and Hale provide a\npicture of our knowledge of modality that sharply contrasts with\naccounts that take conceivability or intuition to be our fundamental\nsource of justification for believing metaphysically modal truths. The\ncore contrast, for example with conceivability, is that modal\nknowledge derives from essentialist knowledge, and that conceivability\nis explained as being successful only in virtue of our possession of\nessentialist knowledge that is unpacked in a conceivability exercise.\n \nFor the purposes of clarifying his approach, Lowe explains our\nknowledge of metaphysical necessities through the following\nprocedure: \nBoth Lowe and Hale offer an account that aims to validate the\nfollowing pattern of inference: \ntherefore \ntherefore \nFor example, the real definition of a circle is that it is a\nset of points in a plane equidistant from a given point. As a\nconsequence, the essence of a circle is that a circle is a set of\npoints in a plane equidistant from a given point. The property of\nbeing (a circle) an entity that is a set of points in a plane\nequidistant from a given point is incompatible with the property of\nbeing (a rectangle) a four-sided closed figure consisting of\nfour right angles. Thus, given the essence of circles, it is\nmetaphysically impossible for a circle to have the property\nthat defines rectangles. \nEssentialism faces a set of critical questions. \nThese questions allow for a critical examination of essentialist type\naccounts. For example, concerning (i), Vaidya (2010) defends an\nunderstanding-based account of essence, while Lowe and Hale defend a\nknowledge-based, or what is known as an essentialist-k style theory.\nConcerning (vii), Horvath (2014) has argued that Lowe’s account\nof essentialist-k theory suffers from a prima facie problem.\nAn outline of the problem is as follows: \nThe core problem is that by saying there is a single source for modal\nknowledge—via knowledge of essence—Lowe has potentially\nundermined his ability to provide an account of how one can know (B).\nOne route that is plausible is the following. Argue that (i)\nconceptual analysis is how we come to know (B), (ii) in all cases of\nmodal knowledge we reason by way of essence, and (iii) as a\nconsequence the epistemology of modality is non-uniform. However, Lowe\ncannot adopt this route, since he has ruled out knowledge of modality\nby (i)–(iv). In contrast to Lowe’s account, it is possible\nfor Hale to offer an account of (B) through the use of conceptual\nanalysis or through a treatment of the real definitions of essence and\nmetaphysical modality. \nFinally, one important issue that separates Lowe’s account from\nHale’s is Lowe’s commitment to epistemic essentialism,\nwhich Hale does not endorse. Lowe articulates his epistemic\nessentialism in his (2008a). \n[E]ssence precedes existence. And by this I mean\nthat the former precedes the latter both ontologically and\nepistemically. That is to say, on the one hand, I mean that\nit is a precondition of something’s existing that its\nessence—along with the essences of other existing\nthings—does not preclude its existence. And, on the other hand\n… I mean that we can in general know the essence of\nsomething \\(X\\) antecedently to knowing whether or not \\(X\\) exists.\nOtherwise, it seems to me, we could never find out that\nsomething exists. For how could we find out that something,\n\\(X\\), exists before knowing what \\(X\\) is—before\nknowing, that is, what it is whose existence we have\nsupposedly discovered? (Lowe 2008a: 40) \nThe epistemic position can be properly captured as: \nEpistemic Essentialism:\n\nknowledge of essence must precede knowledge of existence.\n \nAnd it can be contrasted with two distinct views. \nEpistemic Existentialism:\n\nknowledge of existence must precede knowledge of essence.\n \nEpistemic Entanglement:\n\nknowledge of essence neither necessarily precedes knowledge\nof essence nor is necessarily preceded by knowledge of\nexistence.  \nWilliamson (2005, 2007a,b), Hill (2006), Kroedel (2012), and Kment\n(2014) have all offered counterfactual theories of modal knowledge.\nWhile the four accounts share formal similarities, in this section the\nfocus will be on Williamson’s account. He partially describes\nhis project in the epistemology of metaphysical modality through\ndiscussion of the philosophy of philosophy. \nWilliamson’s counterfactual theory allows for the construction\nof an abductive anti-skeptical argument against Nozick’s (2003)\nevolutionary-based skepticism about our knowledge of metaphysical\nmodality. \ntherefore \nThe key theses of Williamson’s counterfactual theory are: \nLogical Equivalence:\n\nmetaphysical possibility and necessity can be proven to be logically\nequivalent to counterfactual conditionals.  \nEpistemic Pathway:\n\ncounterfactual reasoning in imagination through the method of\ncounterfactual development can provide one with justified beliefs or\nknowledge about metaphysical possibility and necessity.  \nWilliamson presents his proof of the logical equivalence between\ncounterfactuals and metaphysical modality by engaging the work of\nRobert Stalnaker and David Lewis. However, he does not commit himself\nto any specific account of the truth-conditions for counterfactual\nconditionals. The basic idea he employs from Stalnaker and Lewis is\nthe following: \nWith (CC) and “⊥” as a symbol that stands for\ncontradiction, Williamson proves the following logical\nequivalences between counterfactuals and metaphysical modality: \nIt is necessary that \\(A\\) if and only if were \\(\\neg A\\) true, a\ncontradiction would follow. \nIt is possible that \\(A\\) if and only if it is not the case that\nwere \\(A\\) true, a contradiction would follow. \nThe basic epistemic idea is that a justified belief about necessity\nand possibility can be arrived at through a counterfactual\ndevelopment, in imagination, of the supposition that \\(\\neg A\\),\nfor the case of necessity, and the supposition that\n\\(A\\), for the case of possibility. \nConsider the following example from Williamson. \nSuppose that you are in the mountains. As the sun melts the ice, rocks\nembedded in it are loosened and crash down the slope. You notice one\nrock slide into a bush. You wonder where it would have ended if the\nbush had not been there. A natural way to answer the question is by\nvisualizing the rock sliding without the bush there, then bouncing\ndown the slope into the lake at the bottom. Under suitable background\nconditions, you thereby come to know the counterfactual: \n(2007b: 142) \nAccording to his theory the general procedure we use to arrive at (*)\nis the following: \n[O]ne supposes the antecedent and develops the supposition, adding\nfurther judgments within the supposition by reasoning, offline\npredictive mechanisms, and other offline judgments. The imagining may\nbut need not be perceptual imagining. All of one’s background\nbeliefs are available from within the scope of the supposition as a\ndescription of one’s actual circumstances for the purposes of\ncomparison with the counterfactual circumstances… Some but not\nall of one’s background knowledge and beliefs are also available\nwithin the scope of the supposition as a description of the\ncounterfactual circumstances, according to complex criteria… To\na first approximation: one asserts the counterfactual conditional if\nand only if the development [of the antecedent] eventually leads one\nto add the consequent. (2007b: 152–153) \nFrom (*) and (POS), one can reason their way to the modal claim (**)\nby checking whether the development of the counterfactual yields a\ncontradiction. \nThe counterfactual theory, thus, holds the following. \nIn the case of necessity: if a robust and good counterfactual\ndevelopment of \\(\\neg A\\) yields a contradiction, we are justified in\nasserting that \\(A\\) is necessary. And, if a robust and good\ncounterfactual development of \\(\\neg A\\) does not yield a\ncontradiction, we are justified in denying that \\(A\\) is\nnecessary. \nIn the case of possibility: we are justified in asserting\nthat \\(A\\) is possible when a robust and good counterfactual\ndevelopment of the supposition that \\(A\\) does not yield a\ncontradiction. And we are justified in denying that \\(A\\) is\npossible when a robust and good counterfactual development of \\(A\\)\nyields a contradiction. \nAn important component of Williamson’s account derives from his\ncommentary on the traditional distinction between a priori\nand a posteriori knowledge. Contemporary theorists often\nmaintain that what separates the a priori from the a\nposteriori is that in the former case experience only plays an\nenabling role—a role in enabling possession of a\nconcept for an individual thinker—while in the latter case\nexperience plays not only an enabling role, but an evidential\nrole—the justification for a claim involving the concept\nrequires appeal to experience by the thinker making the claim.\nWilliamson maintains that several instances of counterfactual\nknowledge (the route by which we acquire modal knowledge) will be\nneither a priori nor a posteriori in any deep or\ninsightful sense. Rather, he acknowledges an extensive category of\narmchair knowledge under which many cases of our knowledge of\nmetaphysical modality would fall. \nWe may acknowledge an extensive category of armchair\nknowledge, in the sense of knowledge in which experience plays no\nstrictly evidential role, while remembering that such knowledge may\nnot fit the stereotype of the a priori, because the\ncontribution of experience was far more than enabling. (2007b: 169)\n \nHe defines armchair knowledge as knowledge that is either\nstrictly a priori knowledge or not strictly a priori\nor a posteriori. In the latter case, the knowledge is such\nthat experience plays no strictly evidential role, but at the same\ntime the role of experience does not fit the model of a\npriori knowledge, since far too much experience played a role in\nenabling concept possession and reliable use. Given Williamson’s\nacknowledgement of armchair knowledge as a domain into which many\ninstances of modal knowledge fall, it is best to describe his view as\nbeing an armchair account of modal knowledge, as opposed to a\nstrictly rationalist or non-rationalist account. \nThere are at least four kinds of critical questions that one can ask\nabout counterfactual imaginability as a theory of our knowledge of\nmetaphysical modality. \nThe Question of Dependence: Does the counterfactual account\nof our knowledge of metaphysical modality depend on any kind of modal\nknowledge? If so, is that dependence problematic? Williamson argues\nthat we can come to possess modal knowledge, such as that it is\npossible for a rock located at \\(L\\) to be located nearby at \\(L^*\\).\nThis knowledge can be arrived at through counterfactual reasoning in\nimagination. However, one might ask does this counterfactual reasoning\ndepend itself on any kind of modal knowledge or essentialist\nknowledge? Does one need to know in some problematic sense what\nessentially a rock is or what is possible for a rock, for one to\nreason counterfactually and correctly to the conclusion that a rock\nlocated at \\(L\\) could be at \\(L^*\\) without contradiction? \nThe Question of Imaginative Engagement: Since the\ncounterfactual account of our knowledge of metaphysical modality\ndepends on counterfactual reasoning in imagination, what are the\ndetails of how the counterfactual imagination works? What can we learn\nabout the conditions under which the counterfactual imagination is\nfallible or likely to be successful? What guides our counterfactual\ndevelopment? Why are we prone to imagine things unfolding in one\nmanner rather than another? For example, when we generally imagine\nwhere a rock would have landed had a bush not been in its path, we\ndon’t typically imagine that the rock would have suddenly\nreversed direction from its current path. More over: what epistemic\nrelevance does the fact that our imagination takes certain directions\nrather than others have on the epistemic status of our counterfactual\ndevelopment of a subjunctive conditional? \nThe Question of Scope: Given that the counterfactual account\nof our knowledge of metaphysical modality aims to capture metaphysical\nmodality, does it really do so for the wide range of metaphysically\nmodal claims that are known? Ordinary modal claims, such as that a\nbush located at \\(L\\), could be located at \\(L^*\\), appear to be\nnon-problematic for the very reasons Williamson offers. However, can\nthe account also provide us with modal knowledge of extraordinary\nmodal claims, such as that it is possible for there to be a physical\nduplicate of a human that is not conscious? If the theory can only\ndeliver knowledge of ordinary, as opposed to extraordinary, modal\nknowledge, is this a problem? \nThe Question of Adequacy: Williamson’s account aims to\nexplain our knowledge of modality via our general capacity to handle\ncounterfactuals. One critical question is whether the strategy is\nexplanatorily adequate. For example, Malmgren (2011: 307) questions\nWilliamson’s assumption that we do have a general capacity to\nhandle counterfactuals: \nIs it legitimate to suppose that we do have a general\ncapacity to handle counterfactuals? I will argue that it is not; more\nprecisely, that it is not legitimate to suppose that we have a general\ncapacity at the appropriate level of implementation. \nMalmgren’s argument aims to show that even though there might be\ngood reasons to reject rationalism about knowledge of metaphysical\npossibility, Williamson’s argument against rationalism fails.\nThe core of her argument is as follows: \ntherefore \nThe core of Malmgren’s argument rests on (3). She offers several\nreasons, which are paraphrased below. \nMalmgren’s argument questions the adequacy of whether or not a\ngeneral capacity to evaluate counterfactuals can provide a complete\nexplanation of our knowledge of metaphysical modality. \nNon-rationalist accounts of the epistemology of modality aim to\nexplain modal knowledge through mechanisms other than that afforded by\na priori reasoning. For example, Carrie Jenkins (2010) offers\na non-rationalist account of conceivability grounded in a theory of\nconcepts, and Peter Kung (2010) has developed a sensory-based theory\nof imagination as a guide to possibility. In general, there are two\nindependent threads of thought that motivate non-rationalism about the\nepistemology of modality. On the one hand, there is the perceived\nfailure of rationalist attempts to provide a comprehensive account of\nmodal knowledge. Rebecca Hanrahan (2009) and Sonia Roca-Royes (2010,\n2011a,b, 2012) provide a treatment of some of the problems with modal\nrationalism, moderate rationalism, and counterfactual accounts of\nmodal knowledge. On the other hand, some theorists have developed, in\ndetail, non-rationalist theories of the epistemology of modality. For\nexample, Crawford Elder (2005) defends an empiricist account of our\nknowledge of essence through the test of flanking uniformities.\nStephen Biggs’s (2011) defends an abductive account of modality\nwhere inference to the best explanation plays a central role in how we\nacquire and account for modal knowledge. Ásta\nSveinsdóttir (2013) defends a conferralist theory of our\nknowledge of essence, on which essence of an object is not\nmind-independent, but rather conferred by our practices and\nconsideration of hypothetical scenarios. Amie Thomasson (2013)\narticulates and defends modal normativism, on which modal discourse is\nnot to be taken as being descriptive. That is modal claims don’t\ndescribe modal reality, rather they are normative, and about how we\nare supposed to use language. Thomas Holden (2014), in articulating\nHume’s view of absolute necessity, defends a modal expressivist\nreading of him. On this account modal discourse expresses the limits\nof what we can find imaginable and unimaginable. Robert Fischer\n(forthcoming) defends a theory-based account of the epistemology of\nmodality, on which our modal knowledge primarily derives from the\ntheories both modal and non-modal that are justified through inference\nto the best explanation. In the next two sections I will discuss in\nmore detail the non-rationalist program known as modalism,\narticulated and defended by Otávio Bueno and Scott Shalkowski,\nand the similarity-based view articulated and defended by\nSonia Roca-Royes. \nBueno and Shalkowski (2014) defend modalism about the metaphysics and\nepistemology of modality. For an extended examination of modalism see\ntheir (2009) and (2013). For the purposes of the epistemology of\nmodality, modalism maintains the following: \nThe metaphysical point of departure for modalism comes from\nunderstanding why the attempt to reduce modality to possible worlds\nsemantics might be unacceptable. Consider the following two claims\nabout the conditions under which a statement of possibility and\nnecessity are true: \n(P) and (N) give the wrong truth conditions when we allow worlds to\ninclude both possible and impossible worlds. The problem is that (P)\nwould supposedly allow for a statement to be true even if it was only\ntrue at an impossible world, while (N) would force it to be the case\nthat a statement is necessary only when it is true in all worlds, both\npossible and impossible. This forces the appropriate amendment:\nrestrict “world” in (P) and (N) to make reference only to\npossible worlds. Hold as a background assumption that there are no\nimpossible worlds. This yields the following result: \nHowever, one might object that an account of the truth conditions for\npossibility and necessity so described is really circular or a\nnon-genuine reduction of modality to something genuinely non-modal.\nModalism is in part motivated by the idea that modality is primitive,\nand that reasoning through such reductions as offered by (P) and (N)\nto (P*) and (N*) reveals why. \nAnother point of departure for the modalist program in the\nepistemology of modality is that because there is no postulation of\npossible worlds that serve as the truth-makers for claims about\npossibility and necessity there is no worry that in knowing modal\ntruths we must come into contact with privileged objects that are not\nthought to be accessible to human minds. In sum, the causal isolation\nproblem is avoided, since there are no causally isolated possible\nworlds upon which modal truths depend. \nThe epistemic component of modalism begins with: \nTwo basic epistemic principles are involved in the construction of the\naccount: \nIntuitively Bueno and Shalkowski hold that a claim \\(P\\) is\nstronger than a claim \\(Q\\) just in case \\(P\\) says more\nabout the world than \\(Q\\) does. For example, “snow is white and\ngrass is green” is stronger than “snow is white\nor grass is green”, since the former requires that two things\nabout the world be true, while the latter only requires that at least\none thing about the world be true. Now, since the claim that \\(P\\) is\nactual is stronger than the claim that \\(P\\) is\npossible, one is always in a position to from a rational\nbelief that \\(P\\) is possible when \\(P\\) is actual. However, this\nleaves open two questions: How can we know non-actual possibilities?\nHow can we know necessities? \nBueno and Shalkowski describe their account of our knowledge of\nnon-actual possibilities as follows: \nThe core idea of their account is that for many cases of modal\nknowledge we arrive at modal knowledge by investigating the relevant\nproperties and objects in question rather than turning to some special\nproperty, such as conceivability. For example, one can know that it is\npossible for a table \\(t\\), which is unbroken, to break because \\(t\\)\nis breakable. How is that we come to know this piece of ordinary modal\nknowledge? We do so on the basis of our knowledge of wood, chemical\nbonds, and the physical relations the table can find itself in, such\nas having a giant bull elephant sit on it. As Bueno and Shalkowski\npoint out: \nWhat about necessities? To understand the case of necessity one must\nask the question: when is one epistemically entitled to believe that\nsomething is necessary and not merely true? The central idea that\nBueno and Shalkowski develop as an answer to this question is the\nfollowing. \nLet \\(C_{n+1}\\) be a claim for which one wants to add a necessity\noperator to, such as through the transition from (2) to (3). \nOne is entitled to make the transition from (2) to (3) in certain\ncases, such as when C has been derived from assumptions/premises that\ncan be dispensed with. Let the general assumptions/premises from which\nC follows be catalogued in (1). \nIn cases of zero premise deduction, \\(C = C_1\\). And in those cases,\nfor example, one can make the transition to (3), since any claim that\nrequires no premises for its proof is a claim that is true no\nmatter what, and thus necessary. For example the axioms of a\nlogical system, such as first order classical logic, may endorse the\nlaw of excluded middle: \n(LEM) can be proved in classical first-order logic from no premises.\nSo, one is entitled to transition from (LEM) to the necessity of\n(LEM). \nIn addition, given that anything that follows from something that is\nnecessary is itself necessary, one can also conclude that a claim is\nnecessary when it can be derived from a set of necessary truths. A\nclear case of this occurs when one deduces a theorem from axioms of a\nlogical system. Given that each axiom is itself necessary, the theorem\nderived only from the axioms, is itself necessary. \nOne of the key focal points of the approach to necessity offered by\nBueno and Shalkowski’s modalism is that one needs to pay\nattention to the premises or assumptions that go into a proof of\nnecessity. One might characterize the approach to necessity as an\nargument-based approach, upon which, endorsing a necessity\nclaim amounts to endorsing the premises, and being justified in\nbelieving the conclusion requires being justified in believing the\npremises. \nThe core idea, then, is that in so far as the premises and assumptions\nin \\(C_1\\ldots C_{n+1}\\) are non-controversial or accepted by all\nparties, and as long as \\(C_{n+1}\\) can be deduced from \\(C_1\\ldots\nC_n\\), all relevant parties are justified in believing \\(C_{n+1}\\) to\nbe necessary. Bueno and Shalkowski hold that one is justified in\nbelieving something to be necessary when one is justified in believing\nthat something holds no matter what. Warranted belief in the\nnecessity of a claim must at least tacitly arise from warranted belief\nthat something holds no matter what. As a consequence, the focus of\nthe dispute over whether, for example, the necessity of origins holds,\namounts to dispute over the premises and assumptions used to derive\nthe necessity of origins. \nIt may turn out that the argument-based approach to necessity\ndeployed by modalism is limited in that many extraordinary modal\nclaims, claims for example about the necessity of origins, are such\nthat there is no secure ground for them, since they rest on\ncontroversial metaphysical principles. By contrast the approach may\ndeliver many ordinary modal claims, claims that are natural extensions\nof well-grounded scientific and mathematical theories. \nOne important critical question for the modalist view is: how much\nknowledge of modal matters can we derive from non-modal knowledge? \nFor example, in the passage from above we learn the following: \nBy investigating (i) the non-modal properties of some entities, such\nas the structure of a table and an elephants weight and when tables\nusually break under certain kinds of force we can come to form\nrational beliefs about (ii) the modal properties of certain objects,\nsuch as the breakability of the table. However, one might question how\nfar this strategy can go. In what kind of cases does this approach\nwork? And if the approach does break down in certain cases, what\naccounts for the difference between cases where the approach succeeds\nand where it fails? \nWithin metaphysics and the philosophy of modality it is standard\npractice to draw two important distinctions. On the one hand, a\ndistinction between abstract entities and concrete\nentities is drawn. Typically, the former are taken to be entities that\nexist outside of space and time, and the latter are taken to be\nentities that exist within space and time. For example, some claim\nthat numbers, such as 2, are abstract objects, while particular\nplants, such as a rose, are concrete objects. On the other hand, a\ndistinction is drawn between de re and de dicto\nmodality. Although the distinction is controversial (see the\nsupplement to\n propositional attitude reports\n on\n the de re/de dicto distinction),\n at least on one account the distinction holds the following: \nA sentence is semantically de re just in case it permits\nsubstitution of co-designating terms without changing the truth-value\nof the sentence. Otherwise, it is semantically de dicto. For\nexample, the sentence “Lois believes that Superman can\nfly” is semantically de dicto, since if we substitute\nthe co-designating name “Clark Kent” for\n“Superman” the sentence moves from being true to false. By\ncontrast, the sentence “Mark Twain is a writer” is\nsemantically de re, since if we substitute the co-designating\nname “Samuel Clemens” for “Mark Twain” the\nsentence remains true. \nSonia Roca-Royes (forthcoming) defends a similarity-based\nview of how we can come to know de re possibilities for\nconcrete entities, such as a table. Her view is important because it\nexplores the area of modal epistemology that concerns de re\nmodality as opposed to de dicto modality. The latter has\noften been the central focus point of rationalist theories in the\nepistemology of modality. \nThe naïve starting point for her account is the following: \nI know that the wooden table in my office, Messy, is not broken. How\ndo I know that? I see it. Although not broken, Messy can break. How do\nI know that? Because the table I had before Messy, which we may call\n“Twin-Messy”, was a twin-sister of Messy, and it broke;\nand I know that Twin-Messy broke because I saw it. (Roca-Royes\nforthcoming: 4) \nThe account can be unfolded as follows: \ntherefore \nIn order to better understand the approach that is taken one needs to\nlook carefully at steps (2) and (3). The core question is: what does\nrelevant similarity mean? Roca-Royes characterizes it as\nfollows: \nThree important questions for the theory are the following:","contact.mail":"anand.vaidya@sjsu.edu","contact.domain":"sjsu.edu"}]
