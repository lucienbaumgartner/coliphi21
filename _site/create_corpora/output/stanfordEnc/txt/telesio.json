Authors in the early modern\nperiod referred to these philosophers as ‘novateurs’ and\n‘modern’. In contrast to his successors Patrizi and Campanella,\nTelesio was a fervent critic of metaphysics and insisted on a purely\nempiricist approach in natural philosophy—he thus became a forerunner\nof early modern empiricism. He had a remarkable influence on Tommaso\nCampanella, Giordano Bruno, Pierre Gassendi, Francis Bacon, Thomas\nHobbes and on freethinkers like Guillaume Lamy\nand Giulio Cesare Vanini.\n\n\n\nBernardino Telesio was born at Cosenza in Calabria in 1509 as the\nson of a noble and quite wealthy family. Having been educated by his\nuncle Antonio Telesio, a humanist of note, he studied in Milan, Rome\nand the famous university of Padua, which he left in 1535. There is no\nevidence that Telesio gained a doctorate. Instead of undertaking a\nuniversity career, he spent several years in a Benedictine monastery\n(1535–44) without taking oaths. Later he lived in the Neapolitan home\nof Alfonso III Carafa, Duke of Nocera. In 1553 he married and settled\nin Cosenza, becoming the dominant figure of the Accademia Cosentina,\nwhich came to focus on natural philosophy under his tutelage. Telesio\nnever held a salaried position. After the death of his wife in 1561,\nwhich marked the beginning of his financial difficulties, he seems to\nhave spent some time in Rome under the patronage of Pope Pius IV. He\nrejected the Archbishopric of Cosenza offered by Pius IV in 1565,\nleaving this position to his brother. From 1576 on he was moving\nbetween Cosenza and Naples; in Naples he lived with the son and heir of\nAlfonso Carafa, Ferrante, to whom he dedicated the final version of his\nDe rerum natura. He died in his hometown in 1588. \n\nTelesio dedicated his whole life to establishing a new kind of\nnatural philosophy, which can be described as an early defense of naturalism and\nempiricism bound together with a rigorous criticism of Aristotelian\nnatural philosophy and Galenic physiology. Telesio blamed both\nAristotle and Galen for relying on elaborate reasoning rather than\nsense perception and empirical research. His fervent attacks against\nthe greatest authorities of the Western philosophical and medical\ntraditions led Francis Bacon to speak of him as “the first of the\nmoderns” (Opera omnia vol. III, 1963, p. 114). He was\nperhaps the most strident critic of metaphysics in late Renaissance\ntimes. It was obviously due to his excellent relationships with popes\nand clerics that he was not persecuted and was able during his own\nlifetime to publish his rather heterodox writings, which went on the\nindex shortly after his death. His principal work is the aforementioned\nDe rerum natura iuxta propria principia (“On the Nature\nof Things according to their Own Principles”), which in the last\naugmented edition of the author's hand appeared in Naples in 1586. The\nDe rerum natura is a huge treatise in nine books which deals\nwith cosmology, biology, sense perception, reason and ethics. Another\ntreatise of major importance is Quod animal universum ab unica\nanimae substantia gubernatur. Contra Galenum, in which Telesio\ncritizised central conceptions of Galenic physiology and psychology.\nThis work was never printed, but circulated in manuscript copies (De\nFranco, 1981, p. XXII). Smaller treatises deal with a variety of themes\nsuch as colours, dreams, geology and meteorology, some of which were\npublished in Rome in 1565 (De iis quae in aere fiunt et de\nterremotibus; De colorum generatione; De mari).\nTelesio's philosophy was disseminated by friends and students such as\nTommaso Campanella,  whose writings contain long paraphrases of\nTelesian ideas; by Sertorio Quattromani, Telesio's successor as head of\nthe Accademia Cosentina, who published a synthesis of his predecessor's\nphilosophy in 1589; and by Antonio Persio, who gave lessons on\nTelesio's thought in Venice and published a collection of smaller\nworks, the Varii de naturalibus rebus libelli, in 1590.\nGiordano Bruno speaks of the “giudiciosissimo Telesio” in\nthe third dialog of De la causa, whilst Francis Bacon based\nhis own speculative philosophy of nature on a blend of Telesian and\nParacelsian conceptions (Giachetti Assenza 1980; Rees 1977; 1984).\nThomas Hobbes followed Telesio in the rejection of species (Schuhmann\n1990; Leijenhorst 1998, p. 116ff.) The physiology of René\nDescartes in De homine shows close similarities to Telesio's\nphysiological theories as they are presented in De natura\nrerum (Hatfield 1992). Telesio also had some influence on Gassendi\nand on libertine thinkers (Bianchi 1992). \n\nTelesio's vision of the genesis of nature is simple to the point of\nbeing archaic, yet at the same time astonishingly modern in the sense\nthat he seems to have been one of the very first defenders of a theory\nof natural evolution without metaphysical or theological\npresuppositions. According to his De rerum natura, the only\nthings which must be presupposed are passive matter and active force,\nthe latter of which Telesio thought of as twofold, heat and cold. These\nprinciples were meant to replace the Aristotelian metaphysical\nprinciples of matter and form. In order to explain how all natural\nbeings came into existence by  these opposing forces, Telesio\npresumed that in the beginning God had created two primary globes, the\nsun and the earth, the sun being the seat of heat, the earth that of\ncoldness, and that He had separated them with such a distance in space\nthat they could not extinguish each other (DRN book I, ch. IV). All\nnatural things result from the battle of these antagonistic forces for\nthe possession of matter. The main region of that creative battle is\nthe surface of the earth, where they create metals, stones and animate\nbeings. The primary activity of warmth is to move fast and to dilate\nand rarefy matter, whereas that of cold is to hinder movement and to\ncondense matter. Things differ according to the amount of heat or cold\nthey possess (and therefore according to their density and derivative\nqualities such as velocity and colour). The quantity of matter is not\nchanged through the action of these forces upon it. The role of heat,\ncold and matter as ‘natural principles’ had been highlighted\nbefore by Girolamo Fracastoro in the first version of the\nHomocentrica and in the dialogue Fracastorius sive De\nanima (Lerner 1992), as well as by Girolamo Cardano in his\nLiber unicus de natura. \n\nTelesio's cosmology puts an end to metaphysical explanations.  Telesio\nthought space to be absolute (DRN book I, ch. XXV–XXVIII), thus\nabolishing the Aristotelian notion of a bipartite cosmos divided into\na sublunary world, in which generation and corruption take place, and\na supralunary sphere with eternal regular movements. The existence of\nvacuum within space is admitted, but things are said to have a natural\ninclination to avoid empty space. In the cosmological chapters of book\nIV Telesio critizised the Aristotelian explanation of the movement of\nthe cosmos by a transcendent telos, the God of Aristotle's\nmetaphysics: the sky doesn't move because of a desire for a being more\nperfect than itself, but because it is its own nature to move and thus\nto sustain its own life (DRN book IV, ch. XXIV;\nAristotle, Metaph. XII, ch. 6–7). Likewise, he rejected\nthe idea that the motions of the subordinate spheres were caused by\nunmoved movers, the pure intelligences of the Aristotelian and\nChristian traditions, an assumption which he reprimanded to be obscure\nand incomprehensible even via imagination (Bondì 1018). \n\nThe things of nature are not created, governed and sustained by\ndivine providence. In Telesio's philosophy, there is no such thing as a\ntranscendent mind or idea. All things act solely according to their own\nnature, starting from the primary forces of cold and heat. The\nEpicurean chance is enclosed in Telesio's Stoic-influenced philosophy\nof nature (Kessler 1992): everything can produce everything, an idea\nwhich was soon to be sharply rejected by Francesco Patrizi da Chierso,\none of the most important contemporary readers of Telesio\n(“Obiectiones”, in the appendix of Telesio's Varii\nlibelli, p. 467 f.). In order to sustain themselves, these primary\nforces and all beings which arise through their antagonistic\ninteraction must be able to sense themselves as well as the opposite\nforce, that is, they must sense what is convenient and what is\ninconvenient or damaging for their survival and well-being. Sensation,\ntherefore, is not the property of embodied souls. Telesio's philosophy\ncan thus be described as a pansensism in the sense that all beings,\nanimate or inanimate, are said to have the power of sensation. \n\nWith regard to psychology, Telesio took a materialist standpoint.\nAccording to his general rejection of the metaphysical (and therefore\ninappropriate) principles of matter and form, he rejected Aristotle's\ndefinition of the soul as forma corporis, i.e. as form and\nentelechy of an organic body (Aristotle, De anima II,1).\nAccording to Telesio, the soul is a separate being, but not in the\nsense of the Platonists, who define it as an immortal essence acting as\nthe governor and mover of the body during its embodied life. Telesio\nheld the soul to be a specific part of the body, defining it as the\nspiritus coursing through the nervous system and having its\nmain seat in the brain. The spiritus which overtakes the role\nof the anima of the philosophical tradition is produced by the\nwhite ‘semen’. Telesio calls it the spiritus e semine\neductus. He maintains in DRN book V, ch. I: \n\n“This [separate substance] will therefore be the\nspiritus, which took its origin from the semen, as we will\nexplain elsewhere (and it is to be found in all things made from semen,\nnamely those which are white and bloodless, with the exception of the\nbones and similar things); and only the spirit is what perceives in the\nanimal, and moves sometimes with the whole body, sometimes with single\nparts thereof, and solely governs the whole animal. That is to say, it\nperforms those actions which, according to the concurring opinion of\nall, are typical of the soul.” (Vol. II, p. 208). \n\nTo ascribe psychic functions to a specific part of the body implies\na rejection of the difference between organic and inorganic life, which\ndichotomy was central to the Aristotelian, Platonic and Christian\ntraditions. According to Telesio, there is a quantitative and not a\nqualitative difference here, which consists in the higher degree of\ncomplexity and the higher degree of warmth that some physical bodies\npossess. Whereas metals or stones are homogenous bodies, organic bodies\nconsist of heterogeneous parts, including the bodily (though invisible)\nspirit in the nerves and brain (DRN book V, ch. II). And just as there\nis no metaphysical difference between living and non-living bodies,\nthere also does not exist a qualitative difference between animals and\nhumans—in both, it is the same spirit which coordinates the\nfunctions and operations of the different bodily parts. In DRN book V,\nch. III Telesio states: \n\nIn order to explain how animate beings perform different functions\nand operations, traditional psychological as well as physiological\ntheories referred to a threefold soul. Whereas Aristotle in De\nanima had distinguished between the anima vegetativa,\nanima sensitiva and anima cogitativa (which\ndistinction also corresponds to that of plants, animals and humans with\ntheir specific faculties), Plato had established three parts of the\nsoul (Republic 434d-443e), which in the Timaios\n(69aff.) he had associated with different organs, namely the rational\npart of the soul (logistikon) to the brain, the spirited\n(thumoeides) to the heart and the desirous or lower passions\n(épithumêtikon) to the liver. In this\ntripartition he was followed by the Stoic physician Galen (De\nplacitis Hippocratis et Platonis VII, I and III), who added a\nthreefold spirit—the spiritus naturalis being produced\nin the liver, the spiritus vitalis refined in the blood and\nthe spiritus animalis distilled in the brain. Whereas the\nAristotelian psychology was combatted in the De rerum natura,\nTelesio dedicated a whole treatise to the criticism of Galen, the\nQuod animal universum ab unica animae substantia gubernatur. Contra\nGalenum. According to Telesio, the functioning of an organic body\ncannot be explained by presupposing a plurality of rulers. In asserting\nthe unity of the soul (i.e. spirit), Telesio followed the medical\ntheorist Giovanni Argenterio (1513–1572), who defended the unity of the\nspirit against the Aristotelian and medical traditions. \n\nTelesio combined the medical theory of spirit with a basically Stoic\nnotion, that of the hegemonikon, according to which the spirit\nin the brain is responsible for all the states and operations\ntraditionally ascribed to the tripartite soul: “the animal\n… is governed by one substance residing in the brain”\n(Quod animal universum ch. XXV; Var. lib. p. 254). Whereas in\nQuod animal universum he went on to explain the affects in\nterms of physiology, in De rerum natura he added a theory of\nsense perception and a theory of knowledge on physical grounds. \n\nTelesio rejected the traditional concept of sense organs, replacing\nit with a mechanistic explanation of sense perception (DRN books\nV–VII). In his opinion, to speak of sense organs is inappropriate, as\nthe so-called sense organs are nothing else than “parts of the\nbody which are either more subtle or soft than others, or perforated\nand open. One should not believe in the slightest that they are made\nthus in order to offer some capacity or support of perceiving to the\nsensitive soul (which seems to be the duty of organs), but in order to\nprovide an easy and open entry to the forces of external things and to\nthose things themselves.” (DRN book I, ch.VI; vol. I, p. 68).\nWhat is perceived are not the forms or species of things as\nthe Aristotelians believed, but impulses of light and air (DRN book V,\nch. VIII; vol. II, 254; for the rejection of species see DRN\nbook VII, ch. XXX–XXXIII against the Aristotelian and ch. XVIII–XXIX\nagainst the Galenic theory; Telesio's rejection of species was\ntaken up by Hobbes, Leviathan book I, ch. I “De\nsensu”). As the sense of touch provides the most narrow contact\nbetween outer object and sensing spirit, it assumes the role of the\nprimary sense, which was traditionally identified with the sense of\nvision (DRN book VII, ch. IX, vol. III, p. 34.) The\ninformatio theory being rejected, Telesio comes close to a\nneuronal explanation of sense perception, which is a mechanical process\narising from the transfer of tactile impressions through the nerves to\nthe brain. It is the spirit residing in the brain which experiences\nnervous dilatations and contractions, and which judges these sensations\naccording to the basic scheme of pleasure and pain, giving out\ncorresponding reactions like moving towards something or avoiding\ncontact (DRN book VII ch. II–V). Strictly speaking, sense perception is\na sensation of sensing (sensus sensus) which takes place in\nthe brain: “Sense perception can only be the perception of the\nactivities of things and impulses in the air, and can only consist of\nthe perception of [the spirit's] own passions, transformations and\nmovements, particularly the latter. Indeed, the spirit perceives them\nbecause he perceives that it is affected by them, that it is being\nchanged and moved.” (Vol. III, p. 6) \n\nIn his explanation of sense perception Telesio comes close to the\nDemocritan theory which he combines with the basic Stoic notion of\nconservatio sui, a key term in Telesio's philosophy. Pleasure\nis identified with the sensation of self-preservation, pain is the\nsensation of destruction (DRN book VII, ch. III; vol. III, p. 10). In\nthis, as well as in his theory of knowledge, Telesio seems to follow\nGirolamo Fracastoro's explanation of sense perception and understanding\ngiven in the closing chapters of De sympathia et antipathia\nrerum and in the epistemological treatise Turrius sive de\nintellectione. \n\nFor Telesio, the conservatio sui is the foundation from\nwhich all sensitive and cognitive functions arise. Defending an\nempirical approach in epistemology, Telesio tried to annul the\ntraditional distinction between sense perception and reason, and he\ndenied that there exists something like a purely mental sphere and a\ncorresponding intellect which Aristotle in De anima III had\ncalled nous. Understanding is a process which requires sense\nperception and memory. According to Telesio, our memory is not visual.\nWhat we remember are movements which our spirit has experienced and\ngiven out when being in contact with external forces. If now the spirit\nundergoes a similar experience, for example the pain of getting burned,\nit will ascribe this perception to a similar or identical cause and\ncall it ‘fire’ (DRN book VIII, ch. 1; vol. III, p. 160). The\nability of making rational conclusions (ratiocinari) consists\nin comparing new expierences to old ones and in supplementing hidden or\nunknown aspects when refering them to former experiences. Telesio even\nsuggests replacing the term intelligere with\nexistimari and commemorari (DRN book VIII, ch. III;\nvol. III, p. 164f.). Intellectual understanding therefore does not mean\nto reach a realm of necessity and eternity, not even in mathematics,\nwhich according to Telesio arises from sensual experience and is a\nscience of less dignity than the observation-based natural philosophy\n(DRN book VIII, ch. IV; vol. III, p. 176f.). \n\nThe ethics exposed in the 9th book of De rerum\nnatura is strictly naturalist. The only objective which Telesio\nascribes to the spirit is self-preservation and self-improvement, the\nformer lying in its ability to react suitably to influences from the\nexternal world, the latter in its capability of finding means to\nimprove its state of being. This comes about through theoretical\nknowledge, specifically through natural philosophy and medicine (cf.\nDRN book VIII, ch. XXI) and through learning to control one's own\nemotions and desires. According to Telesio, we can voluntarily provoke\nand suppress affections and their related actions (DRN book IX, ch. I;\nvol. III, p. 332f.); what is more, we are able to master the degree to\nwhich we desire and are affected (DRN book IX, ch. II; vol. III, p.\n334). The principle of moral virtue is said to be a knowledge of what\nis helpful and what is damaging for survival and well-being in human\nsociety. All virtues and vices are reduced to self-conservation. \n\nWhereas medieval and Renaissance authors often seemed to rely on the\ndouble-truth theory in order to maintain the freedom of scientific\nresearch and teaching, Telesio maintained a purely scientific approach.\nBut he did not deny the existence of God and of the human soul.\nTelesio's God is not the God who acts in nature and history, though he\ndid not deny the possibility of miracles (DRN book IV, ch. XXV; vol. I,\np. 176). The God Telesio seems to imagine can be compared to a\nmechanic. Just as the best mechanic creates an artefact which will work\nwithout interruption and default, so the power of the almighty divine\nartist is represented in a cosmos which is able to generate and to\nsustain itself without ever running the danger of corruption (see DRN\nbook I, ch. X). \n\nBesides the natural soul or spirit Telesio accepted the existence of\nan immortal soul superimposed by God (DRN book V, ch. II–III). But in\nhis theory of psychology and ethics the soul does not play any\nsignificant role, for which reason researchers have often held it to be\nan addition designed to avoid conflicts with the Church. On the other\nhand, there do exist certain modes of behavior which cannot be\nexplained in a purely naturalistic and materialistic way, such as the\nhuman striving for eternity and the martyrs' denial of the highest\nobjective of self-preservation. But far from building a bridge to the\nphilosophical tradition, Telesio's definition of a second, divinely\nsuperimposed soul as “forma corporis et praecipue spiritus”\ndeals a deathblow to Aristotle's teachings. According to Telesio, the\nidea of an immortal soul was totally unknown to the heathen Aristotle,\nwho is severely criticized for confusing the concept of a natural\nspirit with the religious idea of a soul (DRN book V, ch. II–III): \nNonetheless, the few pages which Telesio dedicated to the immortal\nsoul do not open a path to metaphysical or theological theories. In\nscience, Telesio adheres to a naturalistic worldview. It was Tommaso\nCampanella who combined Telesian naturalism with a theory of the anima\ncreata and human mind which he based upon sceptical doubts. (Boenke\n2005, Ernst 2014, Bondì 2018).","contact.mail":"M.Boenke@lrz.uni-muenchen.de","contact.domain":"lrz.uni-muenchen.de"}]
