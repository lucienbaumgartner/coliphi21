We apply it to individual\nactions, to laws, and to public policies, and we think in each case\nthat if they are unjust this is a strong, maybe even conclusive, reason\nto reject them. Classically, justice was counted as one of the\nfour cardinal virtues (and sometimes as the most important of the\nfour); in modern times John Rawls famously described it as ‘the\nfirst virtue of social institutions’ (Rawls 1971, p.3; Rawls,\n1999, p.3). We might debate which of these realms of practical\nphilosophy has first claim on justice: is it first and foremost a\nproperty of the law, for example, and only derivatively a property of\nindividuals and other institutions? But it is probably more\nenlightening to accept that the idea has over time sunk deep roots in\neach of these domains, and to try to make sense of such a wide-ranging\nconcept by identifying elements that are present whenever justice is\ninvoked, but also examining the different forms it takes in various\npractical contexts. This article aims to provide a general map of\nthe ways in which justice has been understood by philosophers, past and\npresent. \n\n\nWe begin by identifying four core features that distinguish justice\nfrom other moral and political ideas. We then examine some major\nconceptual contrasts: between conservative and ideal justice, between\ncorrective and distributive justice, between procedural and\nsubstantive justice, and between comparative and non-comparative\njustice.  Next we turn to questions of scope: to who or what do\nprinciples of justice apply? We ask whether non-human animals can be\nsubjects of justice, whether justice applies only between people who\nalready stand in a particular kind of relationship to one another, and\nwhether individual people continue to have duties of justice once\njustice-based institutions have been created. We then examine three\noverarching theories that might serve to unify the different forms of\njustice: utilitarianism, contractarianism, and egalitarianism. But it\nseems, in conclusion, that no such theory is likely be successful.\n\n\nMore detailed discussions of particular forms of justice can be\nfound in other entries: see especially \n distributive justice,\n global justice,\n intergenerational justice,\n international distributive justice,\n justice and bad luck,\n justice as a virtue, and\n retributive justice.\n\n\n\n‘Justice’ has sometimes been used in a way that makes it\nvirtually indistinguishable from rightness in general. Aristotle,\nfor example, distinguished between ‘universal’ justice that\ncorresponded to ‘virtue as a whole’ and\n‘particular’ justice which had a narrower scope (Aristotle,\nNicomachean Ethics, Book V, chs. 1–2). The wide sense\nmay have been more evident in classical Greek than in modern\nEnglish. But Aristotle also noted that when justice was\nidentified with ‘complete virtue’, this was always\n‘in relation to another person’. In other words, if\njustice is to be identified with morality as such, it must be morality\nin the sense of ‘what we owe to each other’ (see Scanlon\n1998). But it is anyway questionable whether justice should be\nunderstood so widely. At the level of individual ethics, justice\nis often contrasted with charity on the one hand, and mercy on the\nother, and these too are other-regarding virtues. At the level of\npublic policy, reasons of justice are distinct from, and often compete\nwith, reasons of other kinds, for example economic efficiency or\nenvironmental value. \n\nAs this article will endeavour to show, justice takes on different\nmeanings in different practical contexts, and to understand it fully we\nhave to grapple with this diversity. But it is nevertheless worth\nasking whether we find a core concept that runs through all these\nvarious uses, or whether it is better regarded as a family resemblance\nidea according to which different combinations of features are expected\nto appear on each occasion of use. The most plausible candidate\nfor a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian,\na codification of Roman Law from the sixth century AD, where justice is\ndefined as ‘the constant and perpetual will to render to each his\ndue’. This is of course quite abstract until further\nspecified, but it does throw light upon four important aspects of\njustice. \n\nFirst, it shows that justice has to do with how individual people are\ntreated (‘to each his due’). Issues of justice\narise in circumstances in which people can advance claims – to\nfreedom, opportunities, resources, and so forth – that are\npotentially conflicting, and we appeal to justice to resolve such\nconflicts by determining what each person is properly entitled to\nhave. In contrast, where people’s interests converge, and the\ndecision to be taken is about the best way to pursue some common\npurpose – think of a government official having to decide how\nmuch food to stockpile as insurance against some future emergency\n– justice gives way to other values. In other cases, there may\nbe no reason to appeal to justice because resources are so plentiful\nthat we do not need to worry about allotting shares to\nindividuals. Hume pointed out that in a hypothetical state of\nabundance where ‘every individual finds himself fully provided\nwith whatever his most voracious appetites can want’, ‘the\ncautious, jealous virtue of justice would never once have been dreamed\nof’ (Hume, An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of\nMorals, pp. 183–4). Hume also believed – and\nphilosophical controversy on this point persists until today\n­– that justice has no place in close personal\nrelationships, such as the family, where (it is alleged) each\nidentifies with the others’ interests so strongly that there is\nno need and no reason for anyone to make claims of personal\nentitlement. (See Sandel 1982 for a defence of this view; for a\ncritique, see Okin 1989. See also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family). \n\nThat justice is a matter of how each separate person is treated\nappears to create problems for theories such as utilitarianism that\njudge actions and policies on the basis of their overall consequences\naggregated across people – assuming that these theories wish to\nincorporate rather than discard the idea of justice. In Section 4\nbelow we examine how utilitarians have attempted to respond to this\nchallenge. \n\nAlthough justice is centrally a matter of how individuals are\ntreated, it is also possible to speak of justice for groups – for\nexample when the state is allocating resources between different\ncategories of citizens. Here each group is being treated as\nthough it were a separate individual for purposes of the\nallocation. \n\nSecond, Justinian’s definition underlines that just treatment\nis something due to each person, in other words that justice\nis a matter of claims that can be rightfully made against the agent\ndispensing justice, whether a person or an institution. Here\nthere is a contrast with other virtues: we demand justice, but we beg\nfor charity or forgiveness. This also means that justice is a\nmatter of obligation for the agent dispensing it, and that the agent\nwrongs the recipient if the latter is denied what is due to her. \nIt is a characteristic mark of justice that the obligations it creates\nshould be enforceable: we can be made to deliver what is due\nto others as a matter of justice, either by the recipients themselves\nor by third parties. However it overstates the position to make\nthe enforceability of its requirements a defining feature of justice\n(see Buchanan 1987). On the one hand, there are some claims of\njustice that seem not to be enforceable (by anyone). When we\ndispense gifts to our children or our friends, we ought to treat each\nrecipient fairly, but neither the beneficiaries themselves nor anyone\nelse can rightfully force the giver to do so. On the other hand,\nin cases of extreme emergency, it may sometimes be justifiable to force\npeople to do more than justice requires them to do – there may\nexist enforceable duties of humanity. But these are rare\nexceptions. The obligatory nature of justice generally goes\nhand-in-hand with enforceability. \n\nThe third aspect of justice to which Justinian’s definition\ndraws our attention is the connection between justice and the\nimpartial and consistent application of rules – that is what the\n‘constant and perpetual will’ part of the definition\nconveys. Justice is the opposite of arbitrariness. It requires that\nwhere two cases are relevantly alike, they should be treated in the\nsame way (We discuss below the special case of justice and\nlotteries). Following a rule that specifies what is due to a person\nwho has features X, Y, Z whenever such a person\nis encountered ensures this. And although the rule need not be\nunchangeable – perpetual in the literal sense – it must be\nrelatively stable. This explains why justice is exemplified in the\nrule of law, where laws are understood as general rules impartially\napplied over time. Outside of the law itself, individuals and\ninstitutions that want to behave justly must mimic the law in certain\nways (for instance, gathering reliable information about individual\nclaimants, allowing for appeals against decisions). \n\nFinally, the definition reminds us that justice requires an agent\nwhose will alters the circumstances of its objects. The agent\nmight be an individual person, or it might be a group of people, or an\ninstitution such as the state. So we cannot, except\nmetaphorically, describe as unjust states of affairs that no agent has\ncontributed to bringing about – unless we think that there is a\nDivine Being who has ordered the universe in such a way that every\noutcome is a manifestation of His will. Admittedly we are tempted\nto make judgements of what is sometimes called ‘cosmic\ninjustice’ – say when a talented person’s life is cut\ncruelly short by cancer, or our favourite football team is eliminated\nfrom the competition by a freak goal – but this is a temptation\nwe should resist. \n\nTo say that for injustice or injustice to occur, there must be some\nagent who has acted in a certain way, or produced some outcome, is less\nrestrictive than might at first appear. For agents can create injustice\nby omission. It is not unjust – though it is undoubtedly regrettable – that some children are born with a cleft lip. But it\nmay well be unjust, once remedial surgery becomes feasible, to deny\nthis to children whose lives would otherwise be blighted by the condition.  \n\nWe have so far looked at four elements that are present in every use\nof the concept of justice. Now it is time to consider some\nequally important contrasts. \n\nPhilosophers writing on justice have observed that it has two\ndifferent faces, one conservative of existing norms and practices, the\nother demanding reform of these norms and practices (see Sidgwick 1874/1907,\nRaphael 2001). Thus on the one hand it is a matter of justice to\nrespect people’s rights under existing law or moral rules, or\nmore generally to fulfil the legitimate expectations they have acquired\nas a result of past practice, social conventions, and so forth; on the\nother hand, justice often gives us reason to change laws, practices and\nconventions quite radically, thereby creating new entitlements and\nexpectations. This exposes an ambiguity in what it means to\n‘render each his due’. What is ‘due’\nmight be what a person can reasonably expect to have given existing\nlaw, policy, or social practice, or it might be what the person should\nget under a regime of ideal justice: this could mean what the person\ndeserves, or needs, or is entitled to on grounds of equality, depending\non which ideal principle is being invoked. \n\nConceptions of justice vary according to the weight they attach to\neach of these faces. At one extreme, some conceptions interpret\njustice as wholly concerned with what individuals can claim under\nexisting laws and social conventions: thus for Hume, justice was to be\nunderstood as adherence to a set of rules that assign physical objects\nto individuals (such as being the first possessor of such an object)\n(Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Book III, Part II). \nThese rules can be explained by reference to the natural associations\nthat form in people’s minds between persons and external objects,\nand although the system of justice as a whole can be shown to be\nsocially useful, there are no relevant independent standards by which\nits principles can be assessed (Hume briskly dismissed\nequality and merit as principles for allocating\nproperty to persons). In similar vein, Hayek argued that justice\nwas a property of individual behaviour, understood as compliance with\nthe ‘rules of just conduct’ that had evolved to enable a\nmarket economy to function effectively. For Hayek, to speak of\n‘social justice’ as an ideal standard of distribution was\nas meaningless as to speak of a ‘moral stone’ (Hayek 1976,\np. 78) \n\nAt the other extreme stand conceptions of justice which posit some\nideal principle of distribution such as equality, together with a\n‘currency’ specifying the respect in which justice requires\npeople to be made equally well off, and then refuse to acknowledge the\njustice of any claims that do not arise directly from the application\nof this principle. Thus claims deriving from existing law or\npractice are dismissed unless they happen to coincide with what the\nprinciple requires. More often, however, ideal justice is seen as\nproposing principles by which existing institutions and practices can\nbe assessed, with a view to reforming them, or in the extreme case\nabolishing them entirely, while the claims that people already have\nunder those practices are given some weight. Rawls, for example,\nwhose two principles of justice count as ideal principles for this\npurpose, is at pains to stress that they are not intended to be applied\nin a way that disregards people’s existing legitimate\nexpectations. About the ‘difference principle’, which\nrequires social and economic inequalities to be regulated so that they\nwork to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of\nsociety, he says: \n\nIt applies to the announced system of public law and statutes and\nnot to particular transactions or distributions, nor to the decisions\nof individuals and associations, but rather to the institutional\nbackground against which these transactions and decisions take\nplace. There are no unannounced and unpredictable interferences\nwith citizens’ expectations and acquisitions. Entitlements\nare earned and honored as the public system of rules declares. \n(Rawls 1993, p. 283) \n\nHere we see Rawls attempting to reconcile the demands of\nconservative and ideal justice. Yet he does not directly address\nthe question of what should happen when changing circumstances mean\nthat the difference principle requires new laws or policies to be\nenacted: do those whose prior entitlements or expectations are no\nlonger met have a claim to be compensated for their loss? We\ncould call this the question of transitional justice (though this\nphrase is often used now in a more specific sense to refer to the\nprocess of reconciliation that may occur following civil war or other\narmed conflicts: see the entry on\n transitional justice). \n\nA second important contrast, whose pedigree reaches back at least as\nfar as Aristotle, is between justice as a principle for assigning\ndistributable goods of various kinds to individual people, and justice\nas a remedial principle that applies when one person wrongly interferes\nwith another’s legitimate holdings. Thus suppose Bill\nsteals Alice’s computer, or sells Alice faulty goods which he\nclaims to be in perfect order: then Alice suffers a loss, which justice\ndemands that Bill should remedy by returning the computer or fulfilling\nhis contract honestly. Corrective justice, then, essentially\nconcerns a bilateral relationship between a wrongdoer and his victim,\nand demands that the fault be cancelled by restoring the victim to the\nposition she would have been in had the wrongful behaviour not\noccurred; it may also require that the wrongdoer not benefit from his\nfaulty behaviour. Distributive justice, on the other hand, is\nmultilateral: it assumes a distributing agent, and a number of persons\nwho have claims on what is being distributed. Justice here\nrequires that the resources available to the distributor be shared\naccording to some relevant criterion, such as equality, desert, or\nneed. In Aristotle’s example, if there are fewer flutes\navailable than people who want to play them, they should be given to\nthe best performers (Aristotle, The Politics, p. 128). \nIn modern debates, principles of distributive justice are applied to\nsocial institutions such as property and tax systems, which are\nunderstood as producing distributive outcomes across large societies,\nor even the world as a whole. \n\nThe conceptual distinction between distributive and corrective\njustice seems clear, but their normative relationship is more difficult\nto pin down (see Perry 2000, Ripstein 2004, Coleman 1992, chs.\n16–17). Some have claimed that corrective justice is merely\ninstrumental to distributive justice: its aim is to move from a\nsituation of distributive injustice brought about by the faulty\nbehaviour to one that is more nearly (if not perfectly) distributively\njust. But this view runs into a number of objections. \nOne is that so long as Alice has a legitimate title to her computer,\nher claim of corrective justice against Bill does not depend on her\nhaving had, prior to the theft, the share of resources that\ndistributive justice ideally demands. She might be richer than\nshe deserves to be, yet corrective justice still require that the\ncomputer be returned to her. In other words, corrective justice\nmay serve to promote conservative rather than ideal justice, to use the\ndistinction introduced in 2.1. Another objection is that\ncorrective justice requires the wrongdoer himself to restore or\ncompensate the person he has wronged, even if the cause of distributive\njustice could be better served by transferring resources from a third\nparty – giving Alice one of even-more-undeservedly-rich\nCharles’s computers, for example. This underlines the\nbilateral nature of corrective justice, and also the fact that it comes\ninto play in response to faulty behaviour on someone’s\npart. Its primary demand is that people should not lose out\nbecause others have behaved wrongfully or carelessly, but it also\nencompasses the idea that ‘no man should profit by his own\nwrong’. If Alice loses her computer in a boating accident,\nshe might, under an insurance scheme, have a claim of\ndistributive justice to a new machine, but she has no claim of\ncorrective justice. \n\nIf corrective justice cannot be subsumed normatively under\ndistributive justice, we need to explain its value. What is\nachieved when we make Bill return the computer to Alice? \nAristotle (Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, ch. 4) suggested that\ncorrective justice aims to restore the two parties to a position of\nequality; by returning the computer we cancel both Bill’s\nunjustified gain and Alice’s unjustified loss. But this\nassumes that the computer can be returned intact. Corrective\njustice requires that Alice be made no worse off than she was before\nthe theft, even if that means Bill suffering an absolute loss (e.g. by\npaying for a new computer if he has damaged Alice’s). \nAristotle himself recognized that the idea of evening out gain and loss\nmade no literal sense in a case where one person assaults another and\nhas to compensate him for his injury – there is no\n‘gain’ to be redistributed. It seems, then, that the\nvalue of corrective justice must lie in the principle that each person\nmust take responsibility for his own conduct, and if he fails to\nrespect the legitimate interests of others by causing injury, he must\nmake good the harm. In that way, each person can plan her life secure\nin the knowledge that she will be protected against certain kinds of\nexternal setbacks. Philosophers and lawyers writing on corrective\njustice disagree about what standard of responsibility should apply\n– for example whether compensation is required only when one\nperson wilfully or negligently causes another to suffer loss, or\nwhether it can also be demanded when the perpetrator displays no such\nfault but is nevertheless causally responsible for the injury. \n\nA third distinction that must be drawn is between the justice of the\nprocedures that might be used to determine how benefits and burdens of\nvarious kinds are allocated to people, and the justice of the final\nallocation itself. It might initially seem as though the justice\nof a procedure can be reduced to the justice of the results produced by\napplying it, but this is not so. For one thing, there are cases\nin which the idea of an independently just outcome makes no\nsense. A coin toss is a fair way of deciding who starts a\ngame, but neither the Blues nor the Reds have a claim of justice to bat\nfirst or kick off. But even where a procedure has been shaped by\na concern that it should produce substantively just outcomes, it may\nstill have special properties that make it intrinsically just. In\nthat case, using a different procedure to produce the same result might\nbe objectionable. In an influential discussion, John Rawls\ncontrasted perfect procedural justice, where a procedure is\nsuch that if it is followed a just outcome is guaranteed (requiring the\nperson who cuts a cake to take the last slice himself is the\nillustration Rawls provides), imperfect procedural justice,\nwhere the procedure is such that following it is likely, but not certain, to produce the\njust result, and pure procedural justice, such\nas the coin-tossing example, where there is no independent way to\nassess the outcome – if we call it just, it is only on the\ngrounds that it has come about by following the relevant procedure\n(Rawls 1971, 1999, § 14). \n\nTheories of justice can then be distinguished according to the\nrelative weight they attach to procedures and substantive\noutcomes. Some theories are purely procedural in form. \nRobert Nozick distinguished between historical theories of justice,\nend-state theories, and patterned theories in order to defend the first\nagainst the second and third (Nozick 1974). An end-state theory\ndefines justice in terms of some overall property of a distribution (of\nresources, welfare, etc.) – for example whether it is\negalitarian, or whether the lowest position in the distribution is as\nhigh as it can be, as Rawls’ difference principle requires. \nA patterned theory looks at whether what each receives as part of a\ndistribution matches some individual feature such as their desert or\ntheir need. By contrast, an historical theory asks about the\nprocess by which the final outcome has arisen. In Nozick’s\nparticular case, a distribution of resources is said to be just if\neveryone within its scope is entitled to what they now own, having\nacquired it by legitimate means – such as voluntary contract or\ngift – from someone who was also entitled to have it, leading\nback eventually to a just act of acquisition – such as labouring\non a plot of land – that gave the first owner his valid\ntitle. The shape of the final distribution is irrelevant:\naccording to Nozick, justice is entirely a matter of the sequence of\nprior events that created it (for critical assessments of\nNozick’s position, see Paul 1982, Wolff 1991, Cohen 1995, chs.\n1–2). \n\nFor most philosophers, however, the justice of a procedure is to a\nlarge extent a function of the justice of the outcomes that it tends to\nproduce when applied. For instance, the procedures that together\nmake up a fair trial are justified on the grounds that for the most\npart they produce outcomes in which the guilty are punished and the\ninnocent are acquitted. Yet even in these cases, we should be\nwary of assuming that the procedure itself has no independent\nvalue. We can ask of a procedure whether it treats the people to\nwhom it is applied justly, for example by giving them adequate\nopportunities to advance their claims, not requiring them to provide\npersonal information that they find humiliating to reveal, and so\nforth. Studies by social psychologists have shown that in many\ncases people care more about being treated fairly by the institutions\nthey have to deal with than about how they fare when the\nprocedure’s final result is known (Lind and Tyler 1988). \n\nJustice takes a comparative form when to determine what is due to\none person we need to look at what others can also claim: to determine\nhow large a slice of pie is rightfully John’s, we have to know\nhow many others have a claim to the pie, and also what the principle\nfor sharing it should be – equality, or something else. \nJustice takes a non-comparative form when we can determine what is due\nto a person merely by knowing relevant facts about that particular\nperson: if John has already been promised the whole of the pie, then\nthat is what he can rightfully claim for himself. Some theories\nof justice seem to imply that justice is always a comparative notion\n– for example when it is said that justice consists in the\nabsence of arbitrary inequality – whereas others imply that it is\nalways non-comparative. But conceptually, at least, both forms\nseem admissible; indeed we can find cases in which it appears we have\nto choose between doing justice comparatively and doing it\nnon-comparatively (see Feinberg 1974; for a critical response, see\nMontague 1980). For example, we might have several candidates all\nof whom are roughly equally deserving of an academic honour, but the\nnumber of honours we are permitted to award is smaller than the number\nof candidates. If we honour some but not others, we perpetrate a\ncomparative injustice, but if to avoid doing so we honour no-one at\nall, then each is treated less well than they deserve, and so unjustly\nfrom a non-comparative perspective. \n\nTheories of justice can then be categorised according to whether they\nare comparative, non-comparative, or neither. Principles of equality\n– principles requiring the equal distribution of some kind of\nbenefit – are plainly comparative in form, since what is due to\neach person is simply an equal share of the benefit in question rather\nthan any fixed amount. In the case of principles of desert, the\nposition is less straightforward. These principles take the form\n‘A deserves X by virtue of P’, where\nX is a mode of treatment, and P is a personal\ncharacteristic possessed by A (Feinberg 1970). In the case of\nboth X and P, we can ask whether they are to be\nidentified comparatively or non-comparatively.  Thus what A\ndeserves might either be an entitlement, or an absolute amount of some\nbenefit – ‘a living wage’, say – or it might\nbe a share of some collective benefit, or a multiple or\nfraction of what others are receiving – ‘twice what B is\ngetting’, say. Turning to P, or what is often called the desert\nbasis, this may be a feature of A that we can identify without\nreference to anyone else, or it may be a comparative feature, such as\nbeing the best student in a graduating class. So desert-based claims\nof justice might take one of four different forms depending on whether\nthe basis of desert and/or the deserved mode of treatment is\ncomparative or non-comparative (see Olsaretti 2003 for essays that\naddress this question; for a more advanced treatment, see Kagan 2012,\nPart III). \n\nAmong principles of justice that are straightforwardly\nnon-comparative are ‘sufficiency’ principles which hold\nthat what justice requires is that each person should have\n‘enough’, on some dimension or other – for instance,\nhave all of their needs fulfilled, or have a specified set of\ncapabilities that they are able to exercise (for a general defence of\nsufficiency, though not one that links it specifically to justice, see\nFrankfurt 2015; for a critique, see Casal 2007). Such principles,\nhowever, need to be supplemented by other principles, not only to tell\nus what to do with the surplus (assuming there is one) once everyone\nhas sufficient resources, but also to guide us in situations where\nthere are too few resources to bring everyone up to the sufficiency\nthreshold. Should we, for example, maximise the number of people\nwho achieve sufficiency, or minimise the aggregate shortfall suffered\nby those in the relevant group? Unless we are prepared to say\nthat these are not matters of justice, a theory of justice that\ncontains only the sufficiency principle and nothing else looks\nincomplete. \n\nSome theories of justice cannot readily be classified either as\ncomparative or as non-comparative. Consider one part of\nRawls’ theory of social justice, the difference\nprinciple, which as noted above requires that social and economic inequalities\nbe arranged to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged (Rawls\n1971, 1999, §12–13). Under this principle, ideally just shares are calculated by determining what each person would receive under the set of social institutions whose economic effect is to raise the worst\noff person to the highest possible level. This is neither a\nfixed amount, nor one that depends in any direct sense on what other\nindividuals are receiving, or should receive. Applying the\ndifference principle does require making comparisons, but these are\ncomparisons between the effects of different social institutions\n– say different tax laws, or different ways of defining property\nrights – not between individual people and the amounts of benefit\nthey are receiving. We might call theories of this kind\n‘holistic’ or ‘systemic’. \n\nWhen we raise questions about the scope of justice, we are asking\nabout when principles of justice take effect and among\nwhom. We have already, when discussing Hume, encountered the idea\nthat there might be circumstances in which justice becomes irrelevant\n– circumstances in which resources are so abundant that it is\npointless to allocate individual shares, or, as Hume also believed, in\nwhich resources are so scarce that everyone is permitted to grab what\nhe can in the name of self-preservation. But even in circumstances\nthat are less extreme than these, questions about scope arise. Who can\nmake claims of justice, and who might have the corresponding\nobligation to meet them? Does this depend on the kind of thing that is\nbeing claimed? If comparative principles are being applied, who should\nbe counted as part of the comparison group? Do some principles of\njustice have universal scope – they apply whenever\nagent A acts towards recipient B, regardless of the\nrelationship between them – while others are contextual in\ncharacter, applying only within social or political relationships of a\ncertain kind? The present section examines some of these questions in\ngreater detail. \n\nWhat does a creature have to do, or be like, to be included within\nthe scope of (at least some) principles of justice? Most past\nphilosophers have assumed that the line should be drawn so as to\nexclude all non-human animals, but more recently some have been\nprepared to defend ‘justice for animals’ (Nussbaum 2006,\nch. 6; Garner 2013). Against this, Rawls asserts that although we\nhave ‘duties of compassion and humanity’ towards animals\nand should refrain from treating them cruelly, nonetheless they are\n‘outside the scope of the theory of justice’ (Rawls 1971,\np. 512; Rawls 1999, p. 448). How could this claim be\njustified? \n\nWe can focus our attention either on individual features that humans\npossess and animals lack, and that might be thought relevant to their\ninclusion within the scope of justice, or on asymmetries in the\nrelationship between humans and other animals. To begin with the\nlatter, Hume claimed that the domination humans exercised over animals\n– such that an animal could only possess something by virtue of\nour permission – meant that we were ‘bound by the laws of\nhumanity to give gentle usage to these creatures, but should not,\nproperly speaking, lie under any restraint of justice with regard to\nthem’ (Hume, Enquiry, p. 190). For Rawls and those\ninfluenced by him, principles of distributive justice apply among\nagents who are related to one another as participants in a\n‘cooperative venture for mutual advantage’, and this might\nseem to exclude animals from the scope of such principles. \nCritics of this view have pointed to cases of human-animal co-operation\n(Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011, Valentini 2014); however these arguments\nfocus mainly or entirely on the special case of dogs, and it\nseems implausible to generalise from them in an attempt to show that\nhuman-animal relationships generally have a co-operative character. \n\nBut the claim that justice only applies to participants in\nco-operative practices is anyway vulnerable to the objection that it\nrisks excluding seriously disabled people, people living in isolated\ncommunities, and future generations from the scope of justice, so it\ndoes not seem compelling as a claim about justice in general (see\nfurther below). Might there be other reasons why animals cannot\nmake claims of justice on us? Another Rawls-inspired suggestion\nis that animals lack the necessary moral powers, in particular the\ncapacity to act on principles of justice themselves. They cannot\ndistinguish what is justly owed to them from what is not; and they\ncannot determine what they owe to others – whether to humans or\nto other non-human animals – as a matter of justice. \nThis suggestion interprets justice as involving a kind of reciprocity:\nan agent to whom justice is due must also in principle be an agent who\ncould dispense justice to others, by virtue of having the relevant\ncapacity, even if for physical reasons – such as suffering from\nsevere disability – they cannot do so in practice. \n\nIf this suggestion is rejected, and we allow that some animals, at\nleast, should be included within the scope of justice, we can then ask\nabout the form that justice should take in their cases. Using the\ndistinction drawn in 2.4 above, it appears that justice for animals\nmust be non-comparative. For example, we might attribute rights\nto the animals over whom we exercise power – rights against cruel\ntreatment, and rights to food and shelter, for instance. This\nwould involve using a sufficiency principle to determine what animals\nare owed as a matter of justice. It is much less plausible to\nthink that comparative principles might apply, such that giving special\ntreats to one cat but not another could count as an injustice. \n\nThe Rawlsian view introduced in the previous section, which holds\nthat principles of social justice apply among people who are engaged\ntogether in a co-operative practice, is a leading example of a\nrelational theory of justice. Other theories offer different\naccounts of the relevant justice-generating feature: for example, Nagel\nhas argued that principles of distributive justice apply among people\nwho by virtue of being citizens of the same state are required both to\ncomply with, and accept responsibility for, the coercive laws that\ngovern their lives (Nagel 2005). In both cases, the claim being\nmade is that when people stand in a certain relationship to one\nanother, they become subject to principles of justice whose scope is limited to those within the relationship. In particular,\ncomparative principles apply within the relationship, but not\nbeyond it. If A stands in a relationship (of the right kind) to\nB, then it becomes a matter of justice how A is treated\nrelative to B, but it does not matter in the same way\nhow A is treated relative to C who stands outside of the\nrelationship. Justice may still require that C be given\ntreatment of a certain kind, but that will be justice in its\nnon-comparative guise. \n\nWhether justice is relational in either of the ways that Rawls and\nNagel suggest has large implications for its scope. In particular\nit bears on the question whether there is such a thing as global\ndistributive justice, or, in contrast, whether distributive\nprinciples only apply to people who are related together as members of\nthe same society or citizens of the same state. For example,\nmight the global inequalities that exist between rich and poor in\ntoday’s world be unjust simply as inequalities, or are\nthey unjust only insofar as they prevent poor people from living lives\nthat we judge to be acceptable? (see entries on \n international distributive justice\nand\n global justice)\nSo much hangs on the question whether, and if so in virtue of what,\ndistributive justice has a relational character. What reason can be\ngiven for thinking that it does? \n\nSuppose we have two people A and B, of whom one is\nsignificantly better off than another – has greater\nopportunities or a higher income, say. Why should this be a concern of\njustice? It seems it will not be a concern unless it can be shown that\nthe inequality between A and B can be attributed to the\nbehaviour of some agent, individual or collective, whose actions or\nomissions have resulted in A being better off than B\n– in which case we can ask whether the inequality between them\nis justifiable, say on grounds of their respective deserts. This\nreiterates the claim in 1.4 above that without an agent to whom the\noutcome can be attributed there can only be justice or injustice in a\nmetaphorical, ‘cosmic’, sense. Relational theorists claim\nthat when people associate with one another in the relevant way, they\nbecome agents of justice.  On a small scale they can organize\ninformally to ensure that each receives what is due to him relative to\nthe rest. On a larger scale, distributive justice requires the\ncreation of legal and other institutions to achieve that\noutcome. Moreover failure to co-ordinate their actions in this way is\nlikely to be a source of injustice by omission. \n\nDebates about the scope of justice then become debates about whether\ndifferent forms of human association are of the right kind to create\nagency in the relevant sense. Take the question of whether\nprinciples of social justice should apply to market transactions. \nIf we see the market as a neutral arena in which many individual people\nfreely pursue their own purposes, then the answer will be No. The\nonly form of justice that arises will be justice in the conduct of each\nagent, who must avoid inflicting harm on others, must fulfil her\ncontracts, and so forth. Whereas if we see the market as governed\nby a humanly-constructed system of rules that the participants\ncollectively have the power to change – by legislation, for\nexample –  then we cannot avoid asking whether the\noutcomes it currently produces meet relevant standards of distributive\njustice, whatever we take these to be. A similar issue arises in\nthe debate about over principles of global justice referred to above:\nis the current world order such that it makes sense to regard humanity\nas a whole as a collective agent responsible for the distributive\noutcomes it allows to occur? \n\nOnce institutions are established for the purpose (among other\nthings) of delivering justice on a large scale, we can ask what duties\nof justice individual people have in consequence. Is their duty\nsimply to support the institutions, and comply with whatever rules of\nconduct apply to them personally? Or do they have further duties\nto promote justice by acting directly on the relevant principles in\ntheir daily lives? No one doubts that some duties of\njustice fall directly on individuals, for example duties not to deceive\nor defraud when engaging in commercial transactions (and duties of\ncorrective justice where behaviour is faulty), or duties to carry out\none’s fair share of an informally organized project from which\none expects to benefit, such as cleaning up the neighbourhood\npark. Others fall on them because they are performing a role\nwithin a social institution, for example the duty of an employer not to\ndiscriminate on grounds of race or gender when hiring workers, or the\nduty of a local government officer to assign public housing to those in\ngreatest need. But what is much more in dispute is whether\nindividual people have more extensive duties to promote social justice\n(for contrasting views, see Cohen 2008, ch. 3, Murphy 1998, Rawls 1993,\nLecture VII, Young 2011, ch. 2). \n\nConsider two cases: the first concerns parents who confer advantages\non their children in ways that undermine fair equality of\nopportunity. If the latter principle of justice requires, to cite\nRawls, that ‘those who have the same level of talent and ability\nand the same willingness to use these gifts should have the same\nprospects of success regardless of their social class of origin’\n(Rawls 2001, p. 44) then there are myriad ways in which some parents\ncan bestow advantages on their children that other parents cannot\n– financial benefits, educational opportunities, social contacts,\nand so forth – that are likely to bring greater success in\nlater life. Are parents therefore constrained as a matter of\njustice to avoid conferring at least some of these advantages, or\nare they free to benefit their children as they choose, leaving the\npursuit of equal opportunities entirely in the hands of the state (for\na careful analysis, see Brighouse and Swift 2014)? \n\nThe second example concerns wage differentials. Might\nindividuals whose talents can bring them high rewards in the labour\nmarket have a duty not to make use of their bargaining power, but\ninstead be willing to work for a fair wage – which if fairness is\nunderstood in egalitarian terms might mean the same wage as everyone\nelse (perhaps with extra compensation for those whose labour is\nunusually burdensome)? Rawls, as we saw above, argued that\neconomic justice meant arranging social and economic inequalities to\nthe greatest benefit of the least advantaged, and in formulating the\nprinciple in this way he assumed that some inequalities might serve as\nincentives to greater production that would also raise the position of\nthe worst-off group in society. But if individuals were willing\nto forego incentives, and so economic inequalities served no useful\npurpose, then the arrangement that worked to the greatest benefit of\nthe (otherwise) least advantaged would be one of strict equality. \nCohen (2008) argues that Rawls’ position is internally\ninconsistent. As citizens designing our institutions we are\nsupposed to be guided by the difference principle, but as private\nactors in the marketplace, we are permitted to ignore that principle\nand bargain for higher wages, even though doing so will work to the\ndisadvantage of the worst-off group. Justice, according to Cohen,\nrequires us to embrace an ethos of service that disdains material\nincentives. \n\nWhy might we hesitate before agreeing that in cases such as these,\njustice requires people to refrain from doing things that they are\npermitted to do by the public rules of their society (passing on\nbenefits to their children; seeking higher wages)? One reason is\nthat the refraining is only going to have a significant effect if it is\npractised on a large scale, and individuals have no assurance that\nothers will follow their example; meanwhile they (or their children)\nwill lose out relative to the less scrupulous. A connected reason\nhas to do with publicity: it may be hard to detect whether people are\nfollowing the required ethos or not (see Williams 1998). Is the\nperson who sends her child to a private school because she claims he\nhas special needs that the local state school cannot meet being\nsincere, or is she just trying to buy him comparative advantage? \nHow can we tell whether the person who claims more money, but merely,\nhe says, as compensation for the unusual stress that his work involves,\nis reporting honestly? (for Cohen’s response, see Cohen 2008, ch.\n8) It appears, then, that there are principles of justice that\napply to what Rawls calls ‘the basic structure of society [as] a\npublic system of rules’ that do not apply in the same way to the\npersonal behaviour of the individuals who live within that\nstructure. Attending to the scope, as well as the\ncontent, of justice is important. \n\nCan justice be understood in utilitarian terms? This may in\nthe first place depend on how we interpret utilitarianism. We\ntreat it here as a normative theory whose aim is to supply a criterion\n– the greatest happiness principle – that can be used,\ndirectly or indirectly, both by individuals and by institutions (such\nas states) in deciding what to do, rather than simply as a tool for\nevaluating states of affairs. Utilitarianism cannot plausibly\nprovide a theory of justice unless it is interpreted in this\naction-guiding way, in light of what was said above about justice and\nagency. We  also assume that the most likely candidate will be a\nrule-utilitarian view that treats principles of justice as belonging to\nthe set of rules which when followed by the relevant agents will tend\nto produce the greatest total utility (for different ways of\nformulating this view, see the entry on\n rule consequentialism). \n\nMost utilitarians have regarded it as part of their task in\ndefending utilitarianism to show that it can both accommodate and\nexplain much of what we intuitively believe about justice. This\nis certainly true of two of the greatest among them, John Stuart Mill\nand Sidgwick, both of whom went to considerable lengths to show that\nfamiliar principles of justice could be given a utilitarian rationale\n(Mill Utilitarianism, ch. 5; Sidgwick 1874/1907, Book III,\nch.5). Bentham, in contrast, was more cavalier: ‘justice,\nin the only sense in which it has a meaning, is an imaginary personage,\nfeigned for the convenience of discourse, whose dictates are the\ndictates of utility, applied to certain particular cases’\n(The Principles of Morals and Legislation, pp. 125–6). \nIf we follow the lead of Mill and Sidgwick in wishing to take seriously\nhow justice is commonly understood, the utilitarian has two challenges\nto face. First he or she must show that the demands of justice as\ncommonly understood correspond roughly to the rules that when followed\nby persons, or implemented by institutions, are most conducive to the\ngreatest happiness. They need not mirror the latter exactly,\nbecause utilitarians will argue, as both Mill and Sidgwick did, that\nour intuitions about justice are often ambiguous or internally\ninconsistent, but there must be enough overlap to warrant the claim\nthat what the utilitarian theory can accommodate and explain is indeed\njustice. (As Sidgwick (1874/1907, p. 264) put it, ‘we\nmay, so to speak, clip the ragged edge of common usage, but we must not\nmake excision of any considerable portion’.) Second, some\nexplanation must be given for the distinctiveness of justice. Why\ndo we have a concept that is used to mark off a particular set of\nrequirements and claims if the normative basis for these requirements\nand claims is nothing other than general utility? What accounts\nfor our intuitive sense of justice? The task confronting the\nutilitarian, then, is to systematize our understanding of justice\nwithout obliterating it. \n\nBy way of illustration, both Mill and Sidgwick recognize that\ndesert, of both reward and punishment, is a key component of\ncommon understandings of justice, but they argue that if we remain at\nthe level of common sense when we try to analyse it, we run into\nirresolvable contradictions. For instance, we are inclined to\nthink that a person’s deserts should depend on what they have\nactually achieved – say the economic value of what they have\nproduced – but also, because achievement will depend on factors\nfor which the person in question can claim no credit, such as inborn\ntalent, that their deserts should depend only on factors for which they\nare directly responsible, such as the amount of effort they\nexpend. Each of these conceptions, when put into practice, would\nlead to a quite different schedule of rewards, and the only means to\nescape the impasse, these utilitarians claim, is to ask which schedule\nwill generate most utility by directing people’s choices and\nefforts in the most socially productive way. Similar reasoning\napplies to the principles of punishment: the rules we should follow are\nthe rules that are most conducive to the ends for which punishment is\ninstituted, such as deterring crime. \n\nTo explain the distinctiveness of justice, Mill suggests that it\ndesignates moral requirements that, because of their very great\nimportance to human well-being, people have a right to have discharged,\nand are therefore matters of perfect obligation. A person who\ncommits an injustice is always liable to punishment of some kind, he\nargues. So he explains our sense of justice in terms of the\nresentment we feel towards someone who breaches these\nrequirements. Sidgwick, who laid greater stress than Mill on the\nconnection between justice and law, also underlined the relationship\nbetween justice and gratitude, on one side, and resentment, on the\nother, in order to capture the way in which our concern for justice\nseems to differ from our concern for utility in general. \n\nYet despite these efforts to reconcile justice and utility, three\nserious obstacles still remain. The first concerns what we might\ncall the currency of justice: justice has to do with the way that\ntangible benefits and burdens are assigned, and not with the happiness\nor unhappiness that the assignees experience. It is a matter of\njustice, for example, that people should be paid the right amount for\nthe jobs that they do, but, special circumstances aside, it is no\nconcern of justice that John derives more satisfaction from his\nfairly-earned income than Jane does from hers (but see Cohen 1989 for a\ndifferent view). There is so to speak, a division of labour,\nunder which rights, opportunities, and material benefits of various\nkinds are allocated by principles of justice, while the conversion of\nthese into units of utility (or disutility) is the responsibility of\neach individual recipient (see Dworkin 2000, ch. 1). Utilitarians\nwill therefore find it hard to explain what from their point of view\nseems to be the fetishistic concern of justice over how the means to\nhappiness are distributed, rather than happiness itself. \n\nThe second obstacle is that utilitarianism judges outcomes by\ntotalling up utility levels, and has no independent concern for how\nthat utility is distributed between persons. So even if we set\naside the currency issue, utilitarian theory seems unable to capture\njustice’s demand that each should receive what is due to\nher regardless of the total amount of benefit this generates. \nDefenders of utilitarianism will argue that when the conduct-guiding\nrules are being formulated, attention will be paid to distributive\nquestions. In particular, when resources are being distributed\namong people we know little about individually, there are good reasons\nto favour equality, since in most cases resources have diminishing\nmarginal utility – the more of them you have, the less\nsatisfaction you derive from additional instalments. Yet this is\nonly a contingent matter. If some people are very adept at\nturning resources into well-being – they are so-called\n‘utility monsters’ – then a utilitarian should\nsupport a rule that privileges them. This seems repugnant to\njustice. As Rawls famously put the general point, ‘each\nmember of society is thought to have an inviolability founded on\njustice which….even the welfare of every one else cannot\noverride’ (Rawls 1971, p. 28; Rawls 1999, pp. 24–25). \n\nThe third and final difficulty stems from utilitarianism’s\nthoroughgoing consequentialism. Rules are assessed strictly in\nthe light of the consequences of adopting then, not in terms of their\nintrinsic properties. Of course, when agents follow rules, they\nare meant to do what the rule requires rather than to calculate\nconsequences directly. But for a utilitarian, it is never going\nto be a good reason for adopting a rule that it will give people what\nthey deserve or what they are entitled to, when desert or entitlement\nare created by events in the past, such as a person’s having\nperformed a worthwhile action or entered an agreement. \nBackward-looking reasons have to be transmuted into forward-looking\nreasons in order to count. If a rule such as pacta sunt\nservanda (‘agreements must be kept’) is going to be\nadopted on utilitarian grounds, this is not because there is any\ninherent wrongness in defaulting on a compact one has made, but because\na rule that compacts must be kept is a useful one, since it allows\npeople to co-ordinate their behaviour knowing that their expectations\nabout the future are likely to be met. But justice, although not\nalways backward-looking in the sense explained, often is. What is\ndue to a person is in many cases what they deserve for what they have\ndone, or what they are entitled to by virtue of past\ntransactions. So even if it were possible to construct a\nforward-looking rationale for having rules that closely tracked desert\nor entitlement as these are normally understood, the utilitarian still\ncannot capture the sense of justice – why it matters\nthat people should get what is due to then – that informs our\ncommon-sense judgements. \n\nUtilitarians might reply that their reconstruction preserves what is\nrationally defensible in common sense beliefs while what it discards\nare elements that cannot survive sustained critical reflection. \nBut this would bring them closer to Bentham’s view that justice,\nas commonly understood, is nothing but a ‘phantom’. \n\nThe shortcomings of utilitarianism have prompted several recent\nphilosophers to revive the old idea of the social contract as a better\nway of bringing coherence to our thinking about justice. The idea\nhere is not that people actually have entered a contract to establish\njustice, or that they should proceed to do so, but that we can\nunderstand justice better by asking the question: what principles to\ngovern their institutions, practices and personal behaviour would\npeople choose to adopt if they all had to agree on them in\nadvance? The contract, in other words, is hypothetical; but the\nsearch for agreement is meant to ensure that the principles chosen\nwould, when implemented, not lead to outcomes that people could not\naccept. Thus whereas a utilitarian might, under some\ncircumstances, be prepared to support slavery – if the misery of\nthe slaves were outweighed by the heightened pleasures of the\nslave-owners – contractarians claims that no-one could accept a\nprinciple permitting slavery, lest they themselves were destined to be\nslaves when the principle was applied. \n\nThe problem that contractarians face is to show how such an\nagreement is possible. If we were to ask people, in the real\nworld, what principles they would prefer to live under, they are likely\nto start from a position of quite radical disagreement, given their\ninterests and their beliefs. Some might even be willing to\nendorse slavery, if they were fairly certain that they would not end up\nas slaves themselves, or if they were sado-masochists who viewed the\nhumiliations inflicted on slaves in a positive light. So in order\nto show how agreement could be achieved, contractarians have to model\nthe contracting parties in a particular way, either by limiting what\nthey are allowed to know about themselves or about the future, or by\nattributing to them certain motivations while excluding others. \nSince the modelling can be done differently, we have a family of\ncontractarian theories of justice, three of whose most important\nmembers are the theories of Gauthier, Rawls and Scanlon. \n\nGauthier (1986) presents the social contract as a bargain between\nrational individuals who can gain through co-operating with one\nanother, but who are competing over the division of the resulting\nsurplus. He assumes that each is interested only in trying to\nmaximise his own welfare, and he also assumes that there is a\nnon-co-operative baseline from which the bargaining begins – so\nnobody would accept a solution that left her less well off than in the\nbaseline condition. Each person can identify the outcome under\nwhich they fare best – their maximum gain – but they have\nno reason to expect others to accept that. Gauthier argues that\nrational bargainers will converge on the principle of Minimax\nRelative Concession, which requires each to concede the same\nrelative proportion of their maximum possible gain relative to the\nnon-co-operative baseline. Thus suppose there is a feasible\narrangement whereby each participant can achieve two-thirds of their\nmaximum gain, but no arrangement under which they all do better than\nthat, then this is the arrangement that the principle recommends. \nEach person has made the same concession relative to the outcome that\nis best for them personally – not accepting the same absolute\nloss of welfare, let it be noted, but the same proportionate loss. \n\nThere are some internal difficulties with Gauthier’s theory\nthat need to be recorded briefly (for a full discussion, see Barry\n1989, esp. Part III). One is whether Minimax Relative Concession\nis in fact the correct solution to the bargaining problem that Gauthier\nintroduces, as opposed to the standard Nash solution which (in a simple\ntwo-person case) selects the outcome in which the product of the two\nparties’ utilities is maximised (for discussion of different\nsolutions to the bargaining problem, see the entry on\n contemporary approaches to the social contract, \n§ 3.2). A second is whether Gauthier is able to justify positing\na ‘Lockean’ baseline, under which each is assumed to\nrespect the natural rights of the others, as the starting point for\nbargaining over the surplus – as opposed to a more conflictual\n‘Hobbesian’ baseline in which individuals are permitted to\nuse their natural powers to threaten one another in the process of\nestablishing what each could expect to get in the absence of\nco-operation. But the larger question is whether a contract modelled\nin this way is an appropriate device for delivering principles of\njustice. On the one hand, it captures the idea that the practice of\njustice should work to everyone’s advantage, while requiring all\nthose involved to moderate the demands they make on one another. On\nthe other hand, it prescribes a final distribution of benefit that\nappears morally arbitrary, in the sense that A’s\nbargaining advantage over B – which stems from the fact\nthat his maximum possible gain is greater than hers – allows him\nto claim a higher level of benefit as a matter of\njustice. This seems implausible: there may be prudential reasons\nto recommend a distribution that reflects the outcome that\nself-interested and rational bargainers would arrive at, but claims of\njustice need a different basis. \n\nJohn Rawls’ theory of justice is the most widely-cited example\nof a contractarian theory, but before outlining it, two words of\ncaution are necessary. First, the shape of the theory has evolved from\nits first incarnation in Rawls (1958) through his major work A\nTheory of Justice (Rawls 1971) and on to Rawls (1993) and Rawls\n(2001). Second, although Rawls has consistently claimed that the\nprinciples of justice he defends are the principles that would be\nselected by people in a suitably designed ‘original\nposition’ in which they are asked to choose the social and\npolitical institutions they will live under – this is what\nqualifies his theory as contractarian – it is less clear how\nimportant a role the contract itself plays in his thinking. His\nprinciples, which are discussed elsewhere (see the entry on\n John Rawls), \n can be\ndefended on their own merits as a theory of social justice for a modern\nliberal society, even if their contractual grounding proves to be\nunsound. Rawls presents the contracting parties as seeking to\nadvance their own interests as they decide which principles to favour,\nbut under two informational constraints. First, they are not\nallowed to know their own ‘conception of the good’ –\nwhat ends they personally find it most valuable to pursue – \nso the principles must be couched in terms of ‘primary\ngoods’, understood as goods that it is better to have more rather\nthan less of whatever conception of the good you favour. Second,\nthey are placed behind a ‘veil of ignorance’ that deprives\nthem of any knowledge of personal characteristics, such as their\ngender, their place in society, or the talents and skills they\npossess. This means that they have no basis on which to bargain\nfor advantage, and have to consider themselves as generic persons who\nmight be male or female, talented or untalented, and so forth. In\nconsequence, Rawls argues, all will choose to live under impartial\nprinciples that work to no-one’s advantage in particular. \n\nThe problem for Rawls, however, is to show that the principles that\nwould be selected in such an original position are in fact recognizable\nas principles of justice. One might expect the parties\nto calculate how to weigh the primary goods (which Rawls catalogues as\n‘rights and liberties, opportunities and powers, income and\nwealth’) against each other, and then to choose as their social\nprinciple ‘maximise the weighted sum of primary goods, averaged\nacross all persons’. This, however, would bring the theory\nvery close to utilitarianism, since the natural method of weighing\nprimary goods is to ask how much utility having a given quantity of\neach is likely, on average, to bring (for the claim that utilitarianism\nwould be chosen in a Rawlsian original position, see Harsanyi 1975).\n Since Rawls wishes to reject utilitarianism, he has to adjust the\npsychology of the parties in the original position so that they reason\ndifferently. Thus he suggests that, at least in developed\nsocieties, people have special reason to prioritise liberty over the\nother goods and to ensure that it is equally distributed: he argues\nthat this is essential to safeguard their self-respect. In later\nwriting his argument is less empirical: now the parties to the contract\nare endowed with ‘moral powers’ that must be exercised, and\nit is then fairly easy to show that this requires them to have a set of\nbasic liberties.  \n\nWhen he turns to the distribution of income and wealth, Rawls has to\nshow why his choosers would pick the difference\nprinciple, which considers only the position of the worst-off social group,\nover other principles such as maximising average income across the\nwhole society. In Theory of Justice he does this by\nattributing special psychological features to the choosers that make it\nappropriate for them to follow the ‘maximin’ rule for\ndecisions under uncertainty (choose the option whose worst possible\noutcome is least bad for you). For example, they are said to be\nmuch more concerned to achieve the minimum level of income that the\ndifference principle would guarantee them than to enjoy increases above\nthat level. In his later work, he abandons this reliance on\nmaximin reasoning and gives greater prominence to another argument\nhinted at in Theory. This portrays the contracting\nparties as starting out from the presumption that income and wealth\nshould be distributed equally, but then recognizing that all can\nbenefit by permitting certain inequalities to arise. When these\ninequalities are governed by the difference principle, they can be\njustified to everyone, including the worst off, thus creating the\nconditions for a more stable society. But we need then to ask why\nequal distribution should be treated as the benchmark, departures from\nwhich require special justification. When Rawls says that it is\n‘not reasonable’ for any of the parties initially to expect\nmore than an equal share (Rawls 1971, p. 150; Rawls 1999, p. 130), is\nthis simply a corollary of their position as rational choosers behind a\nveil of ignorance, or has Rawls in addition endowed them with a\nsubstantive sense of justice that includes this presumption of\nequality? \n\nAlthough Rawls throughout presents his theory of justice as\ncontractarian, we can now see that the terms of the contract are in\npart determined by prior normative principles that Rawls engineers the\nparties to follow. So in contrast to Gauthier, it is no longer\nsimply a case of self-interested contractors negotiating their way to\nan agreement. Rawls candidly admits that the contractual\nsituation has to be adjusted so that it yields results that match our\npre-existing convictions about justice. But then we may ask how\nmuch work the contractual apparatus is really doing (see Barry 1989,\nch. 9 for a critical appraisal). \n\nScanlon (1998) does not attempt to deliver a theory of justice in the\nsame sense as Rawls, but his contractarian account of that part of morality that specifies ‘what we owe to each other’ covers much of the\nsame terrain (for an explicit attempt to analyse justice in Scanlonian\nterms, see Barry 1995).  Like Rawls, Scanlon is concerned to develop\nan alternative to utilitarianism, and he does so by developing a test\nthat any candidate moral principle must pass: it must be such that\nno-one could reasonably reject it as the basis for informed, unforced\ngeneral agreement (see the entry on\n contractualism). Scanlon’s\ncontractors are not positioned behind a veil of ignorance. They\nare able to see what effect adopting any proposed principle would have\non them personally. If that effect is unacceptable to them, they\nare permitted to reject it. Each person has, so to speak, a veto\non any general principle for regulating conduct. Those that\nsurvive this test are defensible as principles of justice –\nScanlon concedes that there might be alternative sets of such\nprinciples appropriate to different social conditions.  \n\nIt might seem, however, that giving each person a veto would lead\nstraightforwardly to deadlock, since anyone might reject a principle\nunder which he fared badly relative to some alternative. Here the idea\nof reasonable rejection becomes important. It would not,\nScanlon thinks, be reasonable to reject a principle under which one\ndoes badly if the alternatives all involve someone else faring worse\nstill. One needs to take account of other people’s reasons\nfor rejecting these alternatives. It might then appear that\nScanlon’s contractualism yields the difference principle, which\nrequires the worst-off group in society to be as well of as they can\nbe. But this is not the conclusion that Scanlon draws (though he\nacknowledges that there might be special reasons to follow Rawls in\nrequiring basic social institutions to follow the difference\nprinciple). The claims of other groups must be considered\ntoo. If a policy greatly benefits many others, while slightly\nworsening the position of a few, though without leaving them very badly\noff, it may well not be rejectable. Scanlon’s position\nleaves some room for aggregation – it makes a difference how many\npeople will be benefitted if a principle is followed – though not\nthe simple form of aggregation that utilitarians defend. \n\nScanlon also says that a person can have a reason for rejecting a\nprinciple if it treats them unfairly, say by benefitting some but not\nothers for arbitrary reasons. This presupposes a norm of fairness\nthat the contractarian theory does not itself attempt to explain or\njustify. So it looks as though the purpose of the theory is to\nprovide a distinctive account of moral reasoning (and moral motivation)\nbut not to defend any substantive principles of distributive justice. In this\nrespect, Scanlon’s contractualism is less ambitious than either\nGauthier’s or Rawls’. \n\nIn the recent past, many philosophers have sought to establish a close\nconnection between justice and equality: they ask the question\n‘what kind of equality does justice require?’, and to that\nseveral competing answers have been given (see, for example Cohen\n1989, Dworkin 2000, Sen 1980). But we should not be too hasty to\nassume that what justice demands is always equality, whether of\ntreatment or of outcome. Perhaps it does so only in a formal sense. As\nwe saw in sect 1.3, justice requires the impartial and consistent\napplication of rules, from which it follows that when two people are alike\nin all relevant respects, they must be treated equally. But, as\nAristotle among others saw, justice also involves the idea of\nproportional treatment, which implies recipients getting unequal\namounts of whatever good is at issue (Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics, Book V, ch. 3). If A is twice as deserving or\ntwice as needy as B, justice may require that she receives more\nthan B does. So here formal equality of treatment – the\nsame rule applied to both – leads to an unequal outcome. Again,\nwhen justice takes the conservative form of respect for existing\nentitlements or legitimate expectations (see para 2.1) there is no\nreason to anticipate that what is due to different people will be\nsubstantively the same. \n\nSo we need to ask about the circumstances in which justice requires\na substantively equal distribution of advantages. One rather\nobvious case occurs when the members of the group within which the\ndistribution is going to occur have no relevant distinguishing\nfeatures, so there are no grounds on which some can claim greater\nshares of benefit than others. Suppose a group experiences a\nwindfall gain for which no-one can claim any credit: a pot of gold\nsomehow appears in their midst. Then unless any member can make a\njustice-related claim for a larger-than-equal share – say that\nshe has special needs that she lacks sufficient resources to meet\n– an equal distribution of the gold is what justice demands,\nsince any other distribution would be arbitrary. Equality here is\nthe default principle that applies in the absence of any special claims\nthat can be presented as reasons of justice. \n\nEquality also acts as a default in circumstances where, although\npeople may indeed have unequal claims to whatever good is being\ndistributed, we have no reliable way of identifying and measuring those\nclaims. By sharing the good equally, we can at least ensure that\nevery claim has been partially satisfied. Thus suppose we have\nlimited supplies of a drug that can treat malaria, and a number of\npatients displaying symptoms of the disease, but lacking specialised\nmedical knowledge we cannot tell whether one person’s condition\nis more serious than another’s; then by sharing out the drug\nequally, we can guarantee that each person at least receives the\nhighest fraction of what they really need. Any other distribution\nmust leave at least one person with less (this of course assumes that\nthere is no threshold amount of the drug beneath which it is\nineffective; if that assumption is wrong, justice under the stated\nconditions might require a lottery in which the chosen ones receive\nthreshold-size doses). \n\nIf justice requires equality only by default, it might seem to apply\nonly in a narrow range of cases. How could egalitarian justice be\nmade more robust? One approach involves declaring a wider range\nof factors irrelevant to just distribution. Thus one formulation\nof the principle holds that no-one should be worse-off than anyone else\nas a result of their ‘morally arbitrary’ characteristics,\nwhere a characteristic is morally arbitrary when its possessor cannot\nclaim credit for having it. This captures a widespread intuition\nthat people should not be advantaged or disadvantaged by virtue of\ntheir race or gender, but extends it (more controversially) to all\npersonal features with a genetic basis, such as natural talents and\ninborn dispositions. In doing so, it discounts most claims of\ndesert, since when people are said to deserve benefits of various\nkinds, it is usually for performing actions or displaying qualities\nthat depend upon innate characteristics such as strength or\nintelligence. In the following section, we will see how\negalitarian theories of justice have tried to incorporate some\ndesert-like elements by way of response. But otherwise justice as\nequality and justice as desert appear to be in conflict, and the\nchallenge is to show what can justify equal treatment in the face of\ninequalities of desert. \n\nA second approach answers this challenge by explaining why it is\npositively valuable to afford people equal treatment even if they do\ndisplay features that might appear to justify differential treatment. A\nprominent advocate of this approach is Dworkin, who argues that\nfundamental to justice is a principle of equal concern and respect for\npersons, and what this means in more concrete term is that equal\nresources should be devoted to the life of each member of society\n(Dworkin 2000). (The reference to membership here is not\nredundant, because Dworkin understands egalitarian justice as a\nprinciple that must be applied within sovereign states specifically\n– so in the terms of 3.2, this is a relational view of\njustice.) The thought is that showing persons equal respect may\nsometimes require us to afford them equal treatment, even in the face\nof relevant grounds for discrimination. Thus we insist on\npolitical equality – one person, one vote – even though we\nknow that there are quite large differences in people’s\ncompetence to make political decisions.  \n\nAs noted above, justice as simple equality of treatment seems open\nto the objection that it fails to acknowledge the agency of the\nrecipients, who may have acted in ways that appear to qualify them to\nreceive more (or less) of whatever benefit is being distributed. \nTo answer this objection, several recent philosophers have presented\nalternative versions of ‘responsibility-sensitive\negalitarianism’ – a family of theories of justice that\ntreat equal distribution as a starting point but allow for departures\nfrom that baseline when these result from the responsible choices made\nby individuals (see Knight and Stemplowska 2011 for examples). \nThese theories differ along several dimensions: the ‘currency of\njustice’ used to define the baseline of equality, the conditions\nthat must be fulfilled for a choice to qualify as responsible, and\nwhich among the consequences that follow from a choice should count\nwhen the justice of an outcome is being assessed (it may in particular\nappear unjust to allow people to suffer the full consequences of bad\nchoices that they could not reasonably have anticipated). The\nlabel that is often used to describe a sub-class of these theories is\n‘luck egalitarianism’. According to luck\negalitarians, justice requires that no-one should be disadvantaged\nrelative to others on account of ‘brute’ bad luck, whereas\ninequalities that arise through the exercise of personal responsibility\nare permissible (for a full discussion of luck egalitarianism, see the entry on\n justice and bad luck).\n ‘Brute’ luck is interpreted\nwidely to include not only external circumstances such as one\nperson’s initially having access to more resources than\nanother, but also internal factors such as possessing natural abilities\nor disabilities, or having involuntarily acquired expensive\ntastes. All such inequalities are to be ironed out by\nredistribution or compensation, while people’s choices about how\nto use the assets they are granted should be respected, even if this\nleads to significant inequality in the long run. \n\nLuck egalitarianism has proved surprisingly influential in recent\ndebates on justice, despite the evident difficulties involved in, for\nexample, quantifying ‘brute luck disadvantage’ in such a\nway that a compensatory scheme could be established. There are,\nhowever, a number of problems it has to face. By giving scope to\npersonal responsibility, it seeks to capture what is perhaps the most\nattractive part of the conventional idea of desert – that\npeople should be rewarded for making good choices and penalised for\nmaking bad ones – while filtering out the effects of having\n(undeserved) natural talents. But in reality the choices that\npeople make are influenced by the talents and other qualities that they\nhappen to have already. So if we allow someone to reap\nadvantages by, for example, devoting long hours to learning to play the\npiano at a high level, we must recognize that this is a choice that she\nwould almost certainly not have made unless early experiment showed\nthat she was musically gifted. We cannot say what she would have\nchosen to do in a counterfactual world in which she was tone\ndeaf. There seems then to be no coherent half-way house between\naccepting full-blooded desert and denying that people can justly claim\nrelative advantage through the exercise of responsibility and choice\n(see further Miller 1999, ch. 7) . \n\nA second problem is that one person’s exercise of responsibility\nmay prove advantageous or disadvantageous to others, even though they\nhave done nothing to bring this change about, so from their point of\nview it must count as ‘brute’ luck.  This will be true,\nfor example, in any case in which people are competing to excel in\nsome field, where successful choices made by A will worsen the\ncomparative position of B, C, and D. Or again,\nif A acts in a way that benefits B, but does nothing\ncomparable to improve the position of C and D, then an\ninequality is created that counts as ‘brute bad luck’ from\nthe perspective of the latter.  One of the most influential exponents\nof luck egalitarianism seems to have recognized the problem in a late\nessay: ‘unlike plain egalitarianism, luck\negalitarianism is paradoxical, because the use of shares by\npeople is bound to lead to a distribution flecked by\nluck’ (Cohen 2011, p. 142). \n\nWe have seen that equality can sometimes be understood as required\nby justice; but it can also be valued independently. Indeed\nthere can be circumstances in which the two values collide, because\nwhat justice demands is inequality of outcome. The kind of\ninequality that is independently valuable is social equality, best\nunderstood as a property of the relationships that prevail within a\nsociety: people regard and treat each other as social equals, and the\nsociety’s institutions are designed to foster and reflect such\nattitudes. A society of equals contrasts with one in which people\nbelong to different ranks in a social hierarchy, and behave towards one\nanother as their relative ranking prescribes. Different reasons\ncan be given for objecting to social inequality, and conversely for\nvaluing social equality (see Scanlon 2003). \n\nThose who find equality valuable for reasons other than reasons of\ndistributive justice are often described as ‘relational\negalitarians’ (see Anderson 1999, Wolff 1998, Fourie, Schuppert\nand Wallimann-Helmer 2015). It is tempting to regard relational\negalitarianism as a rival theory of justice to the luck egalitarian\ntheory outlined in §6.2, but it may be more illuminating to see it\ninstead as providing an alternative account of why we should care about\nlimiting material inequality. Thus, faced with a world like the\none we currently inhabit in which income differences are very large,\njustice theorists are likely to criticize these inequalities on grounds\nthat they are not deserved, or arise from brute luck, etc., whereas\nrelational egalitarians will say that they create a divided society in\nwhich people are alienated from each other, and cannot interact in a\nmutually respectful way. Relational equality does not address\nissues of distribution directly, and so cannot function as a theory of\njustice itself, but it can provide grounds for preferring one theory of\njustice to its rivals – namely that implementing that particular\ntheory is more likely to create or sustain a society of equals. \n\nWe saw at the beginning of this article that justice can take a\nnumber of different forms, depending on the practical context in which\nit is being applied. Although we found common elements running\nthrough this diversity of use – most readily captured in\nJustinian’s ‘suum cuique’ formula –\nthese were formal rather than substantive. In these\ncircumstances, it is natural to look for an overarching framework into\nwhich the various contextually specific conceptions of justice can all\nbe fitted. Three such frameworks were examined: utilitarianism,\ncontractarianism and egalitarianism. None, however, passed what\nwe might call the ‘Sidgwick/Rawls test’, namely that of\nincorporating and explaining the majority at least of our considered\nconvictions about justice – beliefs that we feel confident in\nholding about what justice requires us to do in a wide and varied range\nof circumstances (for Rawls’ version of the test see the entry on\n reflective equilibrium). \n So unless we are willing to jettison many of these\nconvictions in order to uphold one or other general framework, we will\nneed to accept that no comprehensive theory of justice is available to\nus; we will have to make do with partial theories – theories\nabout what justice requires in particular domains of human life. \nRawls himself, despite the bold title of his first book (A Theory\nof Justice), came to recognize that what he had outlined was at\nbest a theory of social justice applied to the basic institutional\nstructure of a modern liberal state. Other forms of justice\n– familial, allocative, associational, international – with\ntheir associated principles would be applicable in their respective\ndomains (for an even more explicitly pluralist account of justice, see\nWalzer 1983; for a fuller defence of a contextual approach to justice,\nsee Miller 2013, esp. ch. 2). \n\nOne way to loosen up our thinking about justice is by paying greater\nattention to the history of the concept. We can learn a great\ndeal by reading what Aristotle, or Aquinas, or Hume, has to say about\nthe concept, but as we do so, we also see that elements we would expect\nto find are missing (there is nothing about rights in\nAristotle, for example), while others that we would not anticipate are\npresent. This may in some part be due to the idiosyncrasies of\neach thinker, but more importantly it reflects differences in the form\nof social life in which each was embedded – its economic, legal\nand political structure, especially. Various attempts have been\nmade to write histories of justice that are more than just catalogues\nof what individual thinkers have said: they aim to trace and explain\nsystematic shifts in the way that justice has been interpreted\n(for contrasting examples, see MacIntyre 1988, Fleischacker 2004,\nJohnston 2011). These should not be read as enlightenment stories\nin which our understanding of justice steadily improves as the\ncenturies roll by. MacIntyre’s view, for example, is that\nmodern liberal societies cannot sustain the practices within which\nnotions of justice find their proper home. We can get a better\ngrasp of what justice means to us by seeing the various conceptions\nthat compete for our attention as tied to aspects of our social world\nthat did not exist in the past, and are equally liable to disappear in\nthe future.","contact.mail":"david.miller@nuffield.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nuffield.ox.ac.uk"}]
