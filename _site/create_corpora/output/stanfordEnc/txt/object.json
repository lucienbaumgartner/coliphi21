Some are events; they fall under\nevent. And so on. One might well wonder—is there a\ncategory under which every thing falls? Offering an\ninformative account of such a category is no easy task. For nothing\nwould distinguish things that fall under it from those that\ndon’t—there being, after all, none of the latter. It seems\nhard, then, to say much about any fully general category; and it would\nappear to do no carving or categorizing or dividing at all.\nNonetheless there are candidates for such a fully general office,\nincluding thing, being, entity, item,\nexistent,\n\nand—especially—object.[2]\n \n\nIt is not obvious that there is any fully general category (whether\nobject or otherwise). Accordingly, not all accounts of\nobject assign it to a fully general category, instead\nallowing that there are non-objects. On those views, object\ndoes indeed divide.\n\n\nAccounts of object, then, differ with respect to whether\nthere are non-objects. And this is not the only fault line. Other\ndimensions of difference include what objects there are and\nwhat objects are. Accordingly, this entry will survey three\nbroad questions about the category object:\n\nWhat, if any, is its contrast or\ncomplement?\n\nWhat is its extension?\n\nWhat is its nature?\n\nEach of these questions admits of various specifications and answers\nthat we will consider in turn. Our focus will be largely theoretical\nand taxonomical, so we will only occasionally refer to historical\nsources. Our topic is abstract and broad, and touches on a number of\nissues in metaphysics that already enjoy coverage in this\nEncyclopedia. Our discussion of such topics will be brief; in\nthose cases, we will recommend consultation of the extant entries for\na more detailed treatment.\n\n\n\n\nThe Contrast Question, as we shall call it, is this: what, if\nany, is the contrast or complement of the category object?\nWith what, exactly, are objects to be contrasted? Put differently, are\nthere non-objects, and if so, what kinds of things are they? Some\nrelated questions: if there are non-objects, do they form a\n natural class\n or collection? What might that class or collection be? \nOn one natural reading, the Contrast Question admits of an easy\nanswer; fix—perhaps by stipulation—the content of\n‘object’ and it will be obvious whether there are\nnon-objects. Unsurprisingly, then, some philosophers suppose that\nthere is a fully general category and simply define\n‘object’ as picking it out. On this Umbrella\nView, as we shall call it, every thing is an object\n(perhaps by definition of ‘object’) and the category has\nno contrast—or, if it has a contrast or complement, the contrast\nis unfilled and the complement unrealized. \nIs the Umbrella View true? Dispute here may appear merely\nverbal, to merely concern how to use the word\n ‘object’.[3]\n This is not quite right, however. So to clarify: the Umbrella View\ninvolves both a substantive metaphysical thesis and a semantic thesis.\nThe metaphysical thesis is that there is a maximally general\nontological category under which all things fall. The semantic thesis\nis that ‘object’—perhaps as a matter of\nstipulation—picks out this maximally general category. Disputes\nover the Umbrella View, then, are merely verbal in part. They\nare merely verbal insofar as they concern the semantic thesis. But\ndisputes over the metaphysical thesis need not be—and in our\nview are not—merely verbal; they do not concern the English word\n‘object’, but rather concern the existence and extent of a\nwholly general ontological category. \nNote, too, that the component theses of the Umbrella View are\nlogically independent. First, the semantic thesis does not entail the\nmetaphysical thesis any more than the semantic thesis that\n‘God’—by definition—picks out a maximally\ngreat being entails the metaphysical thesis that there is indeed such\na being. Second, the metaphysical thesis does not entail the semantic\nthesis; that there is a maximally general category does not entail\nthat it is picked out by any word at all, much less the English word\n‘object’. \nA consequence of the Umbrella View is that items that appear to have\nlittle in common—universals, particulars, gods, books,\npossibilities, colleges, works of music (if such there are)—are\nin fact all united under one category: object. \nTo be sure, not all who endorse the Umbrella View deploy the English\nword ‘object’ in explicating the view. Other candidates\nfor the fully general office, instead, make an appearance. So\nLowe: \n‘Thing’, in its most general sense, is interchangeable\nwith ‘entity’ or ‘being’ and is applicable to\nany item whose existence is acknowledged by a system of ontology,\nwhether that item be particular, universal, abstract, or concrete. In\nthis sense, not only material bodies but also properties, relations,\nevents, numbers, sets, and propositions are—if they are\nacknowledged as existing—to be accounted ‘things’.\n(2005: 915) \nAnd Russell: \nI shall use as synonymous with [‘term’] the words unit,\nindividual and entity. The first two emphasize the fact that every\nterm is one, while the third is derived from the fact that every term\nhas being, i.e. is in some sense. A man, a moment, a number, a class,\na relation, a chimera, or anything else that can be mentioned, is sure\nto be a term (1903: 43) \nAnd Strawson: \nAnything whatever can be introduced into discussion by means of a\nsingular, definitely identifying substantival expression….\nAnything whatever can be identifyingly referred to; anything whatever\ncan appear as a logical subject, an ‘individual’. (1959:\n137, 227) \nFinally, Tugendhat: \nNow what is meant by the word ‘object’? This word too, in\nthe comprehensive sense in which it is used in philosophy, is a term\nof art. In ordinary language we are inclined to call only material\nobjects… objects, and not e.g. events or numbers… What\nis meant by ‘objects’ in philosophy has its basis in\n… what we mean by the word ‘something’…\nThere is a class of linguistic expressions which are used to stand for\nan object; and here we can only say: to stand for something. These are\nthe expressions which can function as the sentence-subject in\nso-called singular predicative statements and which in logic have also\nbeen called singular terms… (1976 [1982, 21–23]) \nAlthough they differ on which English word to assign to that category\n(i.e., ‘thing’, ‘term’, or\n‘individual’, ‘something’), Lowe, Russell,\nStrawson, and Tugendhat all accept a fully general category under\nwhich all items fall and suppose that some word picks out that\ncategory. They accept, then, the Umbrella View. \nSome features of the Umbrella View deserve explicit attention. \nOn the Umbrella View, it is unlikely that object can be\nanalyzed in more fundamental terms or categories, especially if\nanalysis of a condition or category involves specifying the complement\nof that condition. Object is, rather, a primitive of\nsorts. Frege affirms something along these lines when he notes of\n‘object’ that “a regular definition is impossible,\nsince we have here something too simple to admit of logical\nanalysis” (1891 [1960: 32]). \nBut it does not follow from the Umbrella View that nothing at all can\nbe said about the category object. For the above proponents\nof the Umbrella View, there is clearly a connection between being an\nobject and being a candidate for\n reference (see entry)\n or thought—something that can be referred to or\nthought about (witness Russell’s use of\n‘term’ above, for example). We will discuss this\nconnection—and the account of the nature of object that\nit suggests—in more detail in\n §3.1. \nFinally, note that there may be reason to be wary of any\nfully general category (whether expressed by ‘object’,\n‘thing’, ‘entity’, or whatnot.). There may be\nreason, that is, to doubt the metaphysical conjunct of the Umbrella\nView. First and perhaps most importantly, there are paradoxes and\npuzzles associated with talking about. or ‘quantifying\nover’, literally every\n thing.[4]\n Second, any fully general category lacks a contrast or complement. So\nit may appear to be idle with respect to classification or carving or\ndividing—the central theoretical tasks of categories, one might\nthink—thus inviting suspicion on the grounds that it is of no\ntheoretical use. \nIf there are non-objects, some obvious topics to pursue include what\nthey are and what they are like. Here we may appeal to various\ndistinctions metaphysicians have offered across disparate projects.\nThese distinctions may not map precisely onto an\nobject/non-object divide and may not have been formulated explicitly\nin those terms. But they can still offer insight into what the\ncontrast or complement of object might be and in turn shed\nlight on what the category of object might amount to. \nWe will now survey several such distinctions; in each case there is a\npurportedly exclusive and exhaustive classification of items into two\nnon-empty categories, one of which intuitively maps onto\nobject and the other onto non-object. \nConsider these platitudes: there are things, and there are ways those\nthings are (we might call the latter ‘properties’). There\nappear to be, for example, tall trees; there also appear to be\nproperties had by those trees, such as being\n tall.[5]\n There appear to be, again, both things and properties. Perhaps there\nis, then, an important distinction between things and properties. And\nif there is such a distinction, it would appear to mark an important\nmetaphysical divide. For it operates at a very high level of\nabstraction and promises to exhaustively and exclusively divide\nreality into categories—with trees, people, planets (for\nexample) falling under thing and green,\ntall, itchy, and kind (for example) falling\nunder property. The thesis that there is such a divide, we\nnote, is distinct from purely semantic theses about whether to use the\nwords ‘object’ and ‘property’ to pick out each\nside of that divide. Our focus here is on the metaphysical question of\nwhether there is such a contrast in the first place, not on which\nwords might express it. \nHere’s how Armstrong expresses the intuitive contrast: \nIt is natural to distinguish a thing, an individual, a token, from any\nparticular properties that the thing happens to have. The table is\nhard, brown, rectangular, and so on. But it is not identical with its\nhardness, brownness, rectangularity. These properties are rather\nnaturally taken to be things it merely has… With\nthings and properties thus distinguished, even if very intimately\nconnected, we have what may be called a substance-attribute view.\n(1989: 60) \nThese platitudes and the close connection we have already observed\nbetween object and thing suggest a hypothesis:\nperhaps the object/non-object distinction just is the thing/property\ndistinction. One intriguing consequence of this identity hypothesis is\nthat informative content may given to the object/non-object\ndivide—namely, by appeal to informative theories about the\nthing/property divide. \nWith this identity hypothesis in mind, we will now survey some\ntheories about what the thing/property distinction might amount to and\nhow exactly it divides reality. \nOur topic in this section is the thing/property or object/non-object\n(henceforth, the ‘object/property’) distinction—as\nopposed to the precise nature of either objects (see\n §3)\n or properties. We will thus elide some terminological details.\nInstead of treating only theories of the object/property distinction\nphrased precisely in those terms, we will canvas several attempts to\nmake sense of other nearby distinctions as well—most notably the\nsubstance/attribute distinction and the universal/particular\ndistinction. \nRussell offers a classic treatment of the object/property (in his\nhands, the ‘particular/universal’) divide and various ways\nin which it may be described: \nWe have thus a division of all entities into two classes: (1)\nparticulars, which enter into complexes only as the subjects of\npredicates or the terms of relations, and, if they belong to the world\nof which we have experience, exist in time, and cannot occupy more\nthan one place at one time in the space to which they belong; (2)\nuniversals, which can occur as predicates or relations in complexes,\ndo not exist in time, and have no relation to one place which they may\nnot simultaneously have to another. (1911: 23–24) \nRussell’s remarks suggest at least three explications of the\nobject/property distinction—in terms of subject/predicate\nstructure, existence in space and time, and multiple-location. We will\nconsider these three theories in that order, and then some others that\nhave been\n offered.[6] \nOne way to make the distinction between objects and properties is to\nlook to expressions that refer to them. In first-order logic, there\nare (among other things) subjects and predicates. And predicates are\npredicated of subjects. Following Aristotle’s remarks on\nsubstance (Categories 1a20–4b19; see also the section\non\n category theory in the entry on Aristotle\n and the entry on\n classical logic),\n Russell (1911) thought that these logical/linguistic reasons were the\nmost persuasive reasons for positing an object/property distinction.\nHe says: \nPredication is a relation involving a fundamental logical difference\nbetween its two terms. Predicates may themselves have predicates, but\nthe predicates of predicates will be radically different from the\npredicates of substances. (1911:\n 23)[7] \nSo, on this way of marking the contrast, objects can be referred to\nonly by subjects, and properties can be referred to by subjects or\npredicates. \nPerhaps there is a particular shade of red that no object has right\nnow, but some objects had and other objects will have. If there is\nsuch a shade of red—if it didn’t go out of existence when\nthe last object that had it stopped having it—one naturally\nwonders where it is. And a natural answer is that it isn’t (and\nhas never been nor ever will be) anywhere. More generally, universals\nare nowhere. Objects, by contrast, are somewhere; they are to be found\nwithin space and time, and in this respect stand in stark and\ncategorial contrast to\n universals.[8] \nIt seems that many properties are shared among objects. Our copies of\nObjects: Nothing out of the Ordinary are the same shape, and\nthe gold hue of Knute Rockne’s helmet is the same as Joe\nMontana’s. But there isn’t just one copy of Objects:\nNothing out of the Ordinary that is multiply located; there are\nmany copies that share a shape. There isn’t one Notre Dame\nfootball helmet; there are hundreds. The books and helmets are many;\neach of their properties is, perhaps, one. \nSo one might make the distinction between objects and properties.\nObjects are restricted to one space-time region, while properties are\nnot. Most objects will occupy many space-time regions by having parts\nat those regions, though. So it is better to say that objects can be\nwholly located at only one region, while properties can be wholly\nlocated at many disjoint\n regions.[9] \nAnother attempt to analyze the object/property distinction is to\nsubsume it under the concrete/abstract distinction. According to some,\nsome things are concrete and others are abstract. Some have it that\nthere are concrete objects and\n abstract objects (see entry).\n The former are usually described as material and having\n causal powers (see entry on the metaphysics of causation),\n while the latter are usually thought to immaterial and lack causal\npowers. While usually the latter are classified as objects, it is a\nsensible view that the concrete things are objects, and the abstracta\nare otherwise. \nBut the concrete/abstract distinction seems no more perspicuous than\nthe object/property distinction, and itself cries out for explication.\nNearly everyone can agree on the things that belong in each category,\nbut precisely in virtue of what they belong in that category remains a\nmatter of debate. Perhaps this is a reason to rest content with\nthinking of the object/property distinction as the abstract/concrete\ndistinction. The latter seems intuitive, and resists analysis in more\nfundamental\n terms.[10] \nTwo laws are associated with Leibniz. The first is the\nIndiscernibility of Identicals: for any two objects, if they’re\nidentical, then any property that one has, the other has. The second\nis the\n Identity of Indiscernibles (see entry):\n for any two objects, if it’s the case that for any property one\nhas, the other has it, then the objects are identical. \nThe Indiscernibility of Identicals is pretty much universally\naccepted. The Identity of Indiscernibles is controversial. The\nIdentity of Indiscernibles seems to entail, for example, that there\ncannot be two spheres that have the same color, shape, and density,\nand have all their other properties in common as well. \nMany people think there can be two exactly similar spheres. But it\ndoesn’t seem that there could be two exactly similar properties\nof sphericality that aren’t identical. Properties, one\nmight think, are individuated by their properties, whereas objects are\nindividuated by some further thing. If a property has all the same\nproperties as another, then the two are identical. \nThis is one way of marking the distinction. The Indiscernibility of\nIdenticals is true of properties, but false of objects. \nStrawson marks the distinction in the following way: \nThere is, for example, the suggestion that general, unlike particular,\nthings cannot be perceived by means of the senses… It is not\nwith the eyes that one is said to see hope. But one can quite\nliterally smell blood or bacon, watch cricket, hear music or thunder.\n(1954: 235) \nSo properties (like hope) are the things that cannot be perceived, and\nobjects (like bacon) are the things can be perceived. Presumably every\nthing is such that either it can be perceived or it can’t be,\nand nothing both can be perceived and can’t, so the division is\nexclusive and exhaustive. \nBut bacon also has a color and a shape, which seem to be perceived\nwhen one perceives bacon. One who marks the distinction this way must\nsay that we perceive only the bacon, and not its color and shape. But\nwhy do we believe that the bacon is rectangular, if we don’t see\nits rectangularity? Presumably we believe it because we perceive the\nbacon, and the bacon is\n rectangular.[11] \nThe final view of the object/property contrast to consider is the view\nthat properties are instantiated, and objects are not. This is, as it\nwere, a metaphysical correlate of the linguistic view discussed in\n §1.2.1.\n and enjoys similar motivations. Instantiation is generally\ntaken as primitive, but some things can be said about it. On one view,\nit’s a two-place relation (see entry on\n relations),\n and the relata are an object and a property, or a property and a\nproperty. On another view, it’s a “non-relational\ntie” that “glues” properties to objects and other\nproperties (see, e.g., Strawson 1959). Objects can only be the things\nthat instantiate; they cannot be instantiated. Properties, by\ncontrast, can both instantiate and be instantiated. \nIn surveying the possible contrasts or complements of object,\nwe have thus far emphasized the intuitive grouping of items into\ncategories like object (substance,\nindividual, particular, etc.) on the one hand and\nproperty (or attribute, universal, feature,\netc.) on the other. These are standard metaphysical categories, and\nthey suggest that the proper contrast or complement of object\nincludes properties or other property-like items. \nBut there is another compelling usage (both in and out of philosophy)\nof the English word ‘object’ and its cognates that\nsuggests a rather different kind of contrast. Here, the divide is\nbetween object and subject. Each object is, roughly,\nan ‘it’, and each subject is a ‘you’. On this\nusage, it is items like us that stand in contrast to objects.\nWe are subjects; trees, universals, colleges, colors, and—well,\nall things not like us in relevant respects—are objects. \nBut what are the relevant respects that group us together to\nthe exclusion of trees, universals, colleges, and colors? Here the\nanswer must involve subjectivity or experience. To\nbe a subject in this sense is, roughly, to experience or to be\n conscious (see entry).\n We are subjects because we experience or enjoy consciousness. But\nwhat is it to be an object and not a subject in the sense at hand?\nReflection on this question suggests two answers and thus uncovers two\nrather different subject/object divides. They differ in what category\nthey assign to object and thus in what they contrast with\nsubject. \nOn the first divide, the relevant objectual category is just the\ncomplement of subject; to be an object, then, is to neither\nexperience nor be conscious. You are a subject and so am I. But an\nunfeeling rock is not, and so it is an object. Since every thing would\nappear to be either a subject in the relevant sense or not, this\ndivide would appear to exhaustively and exclusively classify\nreality. \nOn the second divide, the relevant objectual category is object of\nexperience, or what is experienced (see entry on\n the contents of perception).\n You—a subject—plunge your hand into a bucket of ice\nwater. You feel just how cold the water—the object of your\nexperience—is. As Bliss puts things: \nThe subject is that to which objects appear, have appeared,\nor may appear… The object, existing external to and independent\nof subjects, may appear to any subject that is so qualified and so\nrelated as to apprehend it. (1917: 406–408, emphasis\noriginal) \nThis second subject/object divide would appear to be neither\nexhaustive nor exclusive; a subject may also be the object of\nexperience (whether her own or someone else’s), and some items\nmay well be neither experiencers nor objects of experience (an\nunfeeling star outside the light cone of any subject, for\nexample). \nWe note, finally, that these specifications of an object/non-object\ndistinction are not in competition with the other surveyed above. \nOne question to ask about the category of object is to ask\nwhat falls under it—what is in its extension? This is the\nExtension Question. The extension of some categories is\nobvious. The extension of the category electron is all the\nelectrons and no non-electrons. The extension of the category\nnumber is all and only the numbers. The extension of the\ncategory composite things is all and only the things that\nhave proper\n parts.[12]\n For some categories, difficult questions arise. Some of those\nquestions involve the question of whether certain things are in the\nextension of the category, e.g., is the Pope in the extension of the\ncategory bachelor? Is a fetus in the extension of the\ncategory person? Some questions concern the nature of the\nthings falling under the category. The extension of the category\nbook includes all and only the books. Does it include ebooks?\nDoes it include some particular and well-loved copy of Material\nBeings, with its stained pages and cover, or the abstract type of\nwhich this particular copy is a token? Answering the Extension\nQuestion leaves many other questions unsettled, one of which is the\nnature of the things that are in the extension. But knowing which\nthings are in the extension is a good start toward figuring out their\nnature. \nSo, one important question to ask of the category object is\nwhich things are in its extension. This question will admit a variety\nof answers. And depending on whether there is a contrast class, it\nwill have a variety of interpretations. If object has no\ncontrast class and every thing is in its extension—if both the\nmetaphysical and semantic theses of the Umbrella View are\ncorrect—then the question of the extension of object is\nequivalent to the ontological question (see below). If object\nhas a contrast class—if at least one of the metaphysical and\nsemantic theses of the Umbrella View is false—then the question\nof the extension of object is not equivalent to the\nontological question. Instead, it asks, “Of all the things there\nare, which ones are the objects?” If the contrast class of\nobject is property, then the Extension Question is,\n“What things are there that aren’t properties?” If\nthe contrast class is universal, the question is, “What\nthings are there that aren’t universals?” If the contrast\nclass hasn’t been specified, and one is starting from what\nordinary people accept, then the Extension Question is, “What\nordinary objects are there?” \nIt widely-held that a central question in ontology—what is often\ncalled ‘the ontological question’—is “What is\nthere?” Though many have asked this question, it was Quine\n(1948) who drew explicit attention to it. He also said it could be\nanswered in one\n word—“everything”.[13] \nIf the answer to the ontological question is ‘everything’,\nif there is a category under which all things fall and if that\ncategory is picked out by ‘object’ by definition\n(as per the Umbrella View), then there is one shared answer to both\nthe extension and the ontological questions. This is one consequence\nof the Umbrella View. But it might turn out that every thing is an\nobject, even if not by definition. A physicalism according to which\nevery thing is a material object, for example, would appear to entail\nthat every thing is an object. But this entailment need not hold\nbecause of the definition of ‘object’; it might hold,\ninstead, on substantive and general theoretical grounds having nothing\nto do with definitions at all. \nThe point is this: on at least the Umbrella View, answering the\nontological question is closely related, if not identical, to\nanswering the Extension Question. We will therefore briefly survey\nseveral highly abstract answers to the ontological question, with the\nunderstanding that many will think that by giving such an answer, they\nare thereby answering the Extension Question. \nPerhaps the most surprising answer to the ontological question is\n‘Nothing’, according to which the extension of\nobject is empty. It’s not clear whether anyone\nsincerely endorses the thesis that there is nothing. However, it has\nbeen defended several times over. \nHawthorne and Cortens (1995) speak for the nihilist thus: “the\nconcept of an object has no place in a perspicuous characterization of\nreality” (p. 143). They suggest three theories on which there\nare no objects. The first that there are just stuffs everywhere, but\nno objects. The second that there is just one big mass of\n stuff.[14]\n The third is that there just isn’t anything at all. This last\noption is what Hawthorne and Cortens defend. They do so using what\nthey (following Strawson) call a “feature-placing\nlanguage”. They model a potential nihilist program on sentences\nlike “it is raining”, “it is snowing now”, and\n“it is cold here”. Such sentences do not quantify over\nanything and have no logical subject (‘it’ functions as a\ndummy pronoun), and so do not ontologically commit one to anything.\nThe nihilist may then paraphrase sentences that apparently require\nobjects (such as “there is a computer here”) with those\nthat do not (such as “it is computering here”). In short,\nthe nihilist turns every putative noun into an adverb, making\njudicious use of spatial, temporal, and numerical adverbs too. \nTurner (2011) agrees with Hawthorne and Cortens that the chief task of\nthe ontological nihilist is to give paraphrases of ordinary language\nthat don’t contain quantification over objects: \nWith this in mind, we demand the following of our Ontological\nNihilist: give us a systematic recipe for taking any sentence of a\nfirst-order language (with predicates assumed to be predicates of our\nbest science) and cooking up the ontologically innocent claim it was\nsupposed to be getting at all along. (2011: 11) \nThese strategies by which to eliminate object-talk suggest a defensive\nmove available to nihilists: paraphrase apparently true sentences that\nappear to require objects into sentences that do not. Such a strategy\nmay neutralize objections to nihilism. But another question remains;\nis there reason to affirm nihilism in the first place? \nOne such reason may derive from nihilism’s economy.\nDasgupta (2009) thinks that objects (he calls them\n“individuals”) are physically redundant and empirically\nundetectable. More precisely, he thinks that every physical theory\nconsidered over the past 400 years entails that objects are physically\nredundant and empirically undetectable. They’re empirically\nundetectable because two situations differing only in their\nindividualistic facts are indistinguishable. And they’re\nphysically redundant because two systems that only differ with respect\nto their individualistic facts will continue to only differ with\nrespect to those facts. And given two theories—the only\ndifference between the two being that one posits physically redundant\nand empirically undetectable things—we should prefer the one\nthat does not. \nDasgupta says that if there are no individuals, then the fundamental\nfacts are all general facts, like \\(\\exists xFx\\), \\(\\exists x\\exists\nyGxy\\), and the like (see also Dasgupta 2016). But what do the\nvariables range over in those sentences? Individuals? Objects? To\nbypass such questions, we must construct a language that doesn’t\nquantify over objects. Dasgupta uses a version of predicate\nfunctorese, which replaces individuals with predicates and a defined\nadicity. So instead of “x is round”,\n“something is round”, or “something loves\nsomeone”, we have “Round1 obtains”,\n“cRound1 obtains”, and\n“ccLoves2 obtains”. In systematically doing\nthis for all sentences, we can do away with all reference to objects,\nreplacing them with general states of affairs. And since individuals\nare physically redundant and empirically undetectable, this is a good\nthing. \nThe aforementioned authors all seem to agree that if first-order\nlogic, which quantifies over objects, can be replaced with a logic\nthat doesn’t so quantify, or one can give a translation of every\nintuitively true sentence of first-order logic into another language\nthat doesn’t quantify over objects, then ontological nihilism is\nvindicated. That is, if one can give an “ontologically\ninnocent” (that is, one that doesn’t quantify over\nanything) paraphrase of every sentence, or a scheme for so doing, then\nontological nihilism is on good footing. \nExistence Monism, chiefly sponsored in recent times by Horgan and\nPotrč, says that there is exactly one\n object.[15]\n (Or at least, exactly one concrete object, or one concrete physical\nobject.) The one thing (which Horgan and Potrč call ‘the\nblobject’) is huge, and very complex, though it does not have\nany parts. It has different properties at different regions (2000: 249\nand 2008: 8). \nOn Horgan and Potrč’s view, common-sense statements are\ntrue, but not made true by any thing(s) other than the only thing\nthere is—the blobject. So truth isn’t direct\ncorrespondence between propositions and the parts of the world\nthey’re about, but rather between propositions and the entire\nworld—indirect correspondence (2000: 250–51). \nOne compelling argument for existence monism (2000: §2.4, also\nSchaffer (2007)) is that the complete causal story of the world can be\ntold in terms of the world and the laws without appeal or reference to\nparts of the world. So, if there were parts of the world, they would\nbe redundant and/or\n epiphenomenal (see entry).\n But we shouldn’t posit explanatorily redundant or epiphenomenal\nthings. So, we shouldn’t posit parts of the world. So, only one\nobject—the world—exists. \nOne compelling argument against existence monism takes a Moorean\nshape. Russell (1918 [1985: 36]) says,  \nI share the common-sense belief that there are many separate things; I\ndo not regard the apparent multiplicity of the world as consisting\nmerely in phases and unreal divisions of a single indivisible Reality.\n \nIf the multiplicity of things is really this obvious, the point may be\nextended: the rejection of one of the premises of any valid argument\nthat has as a conclusion that there is only one concrete object will\nalways be more plausible than accepting the\n conclusion.[16] \nExistence pluralism is the view that there is more than one thing.\nCertainly existence pluralism is the standard view—even among\nmetaphysicians. Indeed, most people think that there are a great many\nthings. The conjunction of the Umbrella View and existence pluralism\nentails that there is more than one object. But if one thinks there\nare a great many things, one might also think that they are not all\nobjects. And so existence pluralists may want to try to treat the\nontological question as distinct from the Extension Question (for\nthem, see\n §2.2). \nOne exception is nominalism; or at least, one version of nominalism is\nan exception. Although nominalism is widely discussed in ontology,\nprecisely what the view is differs. Some say that nominalism is the\nview that there are no abstracta or universals. Others say that\nnominalism is the view that the correct answer to the ontological\nquestion is ‘particulars’, or ‘concrete\nthings’, or ‘objects’. \nFor the proponent of the latter formulation of nominalism, the\nExtension Question is the ontological question; if she thinks there\nare only objects, then she’ll think that whatever is in the\nextension of object is all there is. (But not because she\nholds the Umbrella View.) The proponent of the former formulation may\ncountenance non-abstracta or non-universals that aren’t objects.\nAnd so she might pursue the ontological question and the Extension\nQuestion separately. \nThere are other views of what there is that are less general than\nexistence nihilism, existence monism, existence pluralism, or\nnominalism. For example, possibilism is the view that there are merely\npossible objects (see\n section on possibilist realism in the entry on possible objects).\n This view doesn’t say that every thing is a merely possible\nthing; it just says that the answer to the ontological question ought\nto include merely possible things. Mereological universalism says that\nwhenever you have two or more things, there is an object composed of\nall and only those things (see\n section on permissivism in entry on ordinary objects).\n It doesn’t tell you that every thing is a composite thing; it\njust says that the answer to the ontological question needs to include\nsuch objects. Perdurantism says that objects are composed of temporal\nparts—at each time at which an object exists, there is an\ninstantaneous object composed of all its parts at that time and is a\npart of it at that time, so those objects ought to be in the extension\nof the answer to the ontological question (see entry on\n temporal parts).\n Meinongianism says that there are non-existent objects, so they would\ninclude those objects in the extension of the answer to the\nontological question (see entry on\n nonexistent objects). \nThese views are partial answers to the ontological question. They are\npartial answers because they tell us what there is, but they\ndon’t tell us everything there is. \nIf—contra the Umbrella View—it is not true by\ndefinition that ‘object’ picks out a maximally\ngeneral category, then there may be things that are not objects. So\nthe Extension Question may turn out to have a different answer than\nthe ontological question. And even if one and the same class or\ncollection is identified as the correct answer to each question, it\ndoes not follow that the questions are the same; even if everything is\nan object, it need not be true by definition that the extension of\n‘object’ is just what there is. So we will also survey\nanswers to the Extension Question that have it that object\npicks out (at least intensionally) a different group of things than\none’s answer to the ontological question. \nFor those who don’t accept the Umbrella View, the Extension\nQuestion is distinct from the ontological question. What, then, does\nthe Extension Question amount to? Presumably one who denies the\nUmbrella View thinks that there are objects, and non-objects. Put\nanother way, her answer to the ontological question includes objects\nand other things. For her, the Extension Question is the following: of\nall the things there are, which ones are the objects? Those who deny\nthe Umbrella View have a variety of ways of dividing the objects from\nthe non-objects, which we discussed in\n §1.2. \nAnother way of dividing the objects from the non-objects is not by\nfirst answering the ontological question and then picking out the\nobjects from all the things, or by answering the Contrast Question and\nthen placing things into either object or its contrast class.\nRather, one could simply start with the Extension Question—one\ncould start by listing the obvious and ordinary candidates for the\noffice of object (see entry on\n ordinary objects). \nA common way to start would be by listing the things we ordinarily\ntake to be objects in our pre-philosophical approach to the world.\nRecall the Tugendhat quotation from above: “In ordinary language\nwe are inclined to call only material objects\n‘objects’.” The view is that the extension of\nobject is all and only the things we normally think about and\ntalk about and refer to and use. These things are nameable,\nidentifiable, stable, and persist through time. Examples include bees,\nerasers, pillows, and boats. \nTwo thoughts arise. First, such an answer to the Extension Question\nleads to many puzzles and problems. Second, simply listing all the\nthings is pretty dissatisfying as an answer to the Extension Question.\nBetter to give a general answer and then see what it entails—in\nparticular, what entailments it has for the Extension Question. What\nfollows is one method for giving a general answer to what objects\nthere\n are.[17] \nMost who have considered the Extension Question probably think there\nare such objects as photons, electrons, quarks and other things that\nscience deals with—the fundamental physical particles. And those\nthings seem to make up other things, like atoms, molecules, elements,\ncells, and so on up the size chain to medium-sized dry goods, large\nbuildings, mountains, and planets. \nSo it seems that things are often composed of other things. But under\nwhat conditions does composition occur? van Inwagen (1990) calls this\n‘The Special Composition Question’ (hereafter ‘the\nSCQ’). More precisely, the SCQ calls for filling in for Φ in\nthe following sentence: For any xs, there exists a y\nsuch that the xs compose y iff Φ. An answer must be\nnon-analytic and must have only ‘the xs’\n free.[18] \nHere are some candidate answers to the SCQ. Contact:\n‘the xs are in\ncontact’. Life:\n‘the xs are caught up in a life’. Mereological\nNihilism:\n‘there is only one of the xs’. Mereological\nUniversalism:\n‘the xs are one or more in number’. \nAnyone who denies the Umbrella View and who has an answer to the SCQ\ncan consider that as a partial answer to the Extension Question. What\nobjects are there? Contact\nsays that there are the xs, and for\nany xs that are in contact, there’s another object (the\none that’s composed of them). Life\nsays that there are the xs, and for any\nxs that are caught up in a life, there’s another object\n(the one that’s composed of them). Mereological\nNihilism says that there are just the\nxs, and no other objects. Mereological\nUniversalism says that there are the\nxs, for any xs at all (no matter how they are arranged),\nthere’s another object (the one that’s composed of them).\nAnd so on for other answers. \nThus far we have asked two questions of object: (i) what, if\nany, is its contrast? (ii) what things, if any, are in its extension?\nThese questions might also be phrased as the questions of what\nnon-objects there are and of what objects there are. We turn now to\nour final question: (iii) supposing there are objects, what are they\nlike? What is their nature? \nOne way to specify the nature of a category is to note the theoretical\nrole it plays or the role played by items within it. This is to say\nwhat items within the category do. Another is to give a real\ndefinition of the category (or the items within it), where a real\ndefinition attempts to identify the real essence of the members of the\ncategory. This is to say what items of within category are\n(see entries on\n theoretical terms in science\n and\n Locke on real essence\n and the\n section on real and nominal definitions in the entry on definitions). \nIn this section, we will consider attempts to state the nature of\nobjects. As with our treatment of the Contrast Question, our\ndiscussion will elide some terminological details. Instead of treating\nonly theories of the nature of objects phrased in precisely those\nterms, we will canvas several attempts to state the nature of nearby\ncategories as well—most notably substance and\nparticular—treating them as giving a theory of the\nnature of objects. \nOne way to explain a thing or category is to mark out what it\ndoes—its role. Since object is, on any view at all, a\nhighly abstract and general category, the relevant role by which\nobject might be defined must itself be highly abstract and\n general.[19]\n Three examples: \nFirst, various linguistic items, it seems, denote or refer.\n“Armstrong” denotes Armstrong, “redness”\ndenotes redness, “the successor of zero” denotes the\nnumber 1, and so on. Reflection on these platitudes brings to the fore\na role that we might call being an object of reference (or\nperhaps some related modal notion such as possibly being an object\nof reference or being eligible for reference). \nSecond, domains (classes or pluralities), it seems, are associated\nwith quantifiers (expressions like “some” and\n“every”). “Everything is so-and-so” quantifies\nover all items within an inclusive domain (maximally inclusive, one\nthinks) and says of each of those items that it is so-and-so.\nReflection on these platitudes brings to the fore a role we might call\nbeing quantified over, or perhaps some related modal notion\nsuch as possibly being quantified over or being a\ncandidate for being quantified over. \nThird, some thoughts are, it seems, about things. The thought that\nAristotle was a philosopher is at least in part about a certain\nperson—Aristotle. The thought that doing metaphysics is a fine\npastime is at least in part about a certain activity. And the thought\nthat Platonism is sensible is at least in part about a certain\nphilosophical theory. Reflection on these platitudes brings to the\nfore a role we might call being an object of thought or\nbeing thought of, or perhaps some related modal notion such\nas being possibly thought\n of.[20] \nThese three examples isolate highly abstract or general\nroles—being an object of reference, being quantified over, or\nbeing thought of. These roles are specified, as it were, by form\nrather than content; the roles alone impose very few limitations or\nrequirements on the kinds of things that fill them. Plausibly, for\nexample, both concrete material objects and abstract propositions\nalike might satisfy any of these roles. \nAnd each role suggests, in turn, a theory of what objects are: (i) to\nbe an object just is to be a referent, (ii) to be an object just is to\nbe quantified over, and (iii) to be an object just is to be an object\nof\n thought.[21]\n van Inwagen offers a version of (i) here (note the use of\n“can”, indicating that it is a modal role that\nobjects play, namely being possible referents; we here presuppose the\nalready mentioned tight connection between ‘object’ and\n‘thing’): \nThe most general metaphysical category is the category\n“thing”. I use ‘thing’ as the most general\ncount-noun. Everything is a thing. A thing is anything that can be\nreferred to by a third-person singular pronoun—as when I say,\n“The following is true of everything, that it is identical with\nitself.” The category “thing” comprises everything\nthere is, everything that exists (for I take a stern anti-Meinongian\nline about non-existents: non-existents simply don’t exist: the\nnumber of them is 0). (2007: 199) \nThese role-theoretic specifications of what it is to be an object will\nhave consequences with respect to the Extension Question and the\nContrast Question. If literally every thing at all is eligible for\nreference or quantification or thought, for example, then literally\nevery thing would be an object, a thesis in line with the Umbrella\nView. If, on the other hand, some items are not eligible for reference\nor quantification or thought, then such items would fall under\nnon-object, and the category object would turn out\nto have a contrast or complement. Similarly, if , say, both concrete\nmaterial objects, abstract propositions are eligible for reference or\nquantification or thought, then items of both sorts would fall under\nthe extension of\n object.[22] \nSome think there’s more to being an object than playing a\nparticular theoretical role. On this view, what it is for something to\nbe an object is a matter of that thing’s intrinsic character or\nnature. One way of giving the intrinsic nature of a thing is by giving\na real definition. Says Dasgupta (2014), a real definition is: \na statement of what something is… For example, when one says\nthat {Socrates} is the unique singleton containing Socrates, one is\ndefining what the set is—that is, giving its real definition.\nOr, equivalently, one is stating its essence or nature… (2014:\n577) \nStatements of what something is—of a thing’s essence or\nnature—could take a variety of forms. One says what it is to be\nthat thing; the real definition of x might be put: to be\nx is to be y. Or the real definition of a category\nF: to be an F is to be a G. When one says,\n“To be a bachelor is to be an unmarried male”, one is\ngiving the real definition of bachelorhood. \nAnother way is to say what is essential to an object or category, as\nsuggested by Fine (1995): It is essential to x that Φ. Or,\nit is essential to Fs that Φ. \nIn any case, the task at hand is not to write a section about what it\nis to be a real definition, but rather how the notion relates to\nobject. \nIf one thinks real definitions best get at the nature of things, and\none is interested in stating the nature of object or of\nobjects, there are two options. One is to substitute for Φ in the\nfollowing: To be an object is to be Φ. The second is to substitute\nfor Φ in the following: It is essential to objects that Φ. \nNote the difference between this method and the method of giving\nnecessary and sufficient conditions: x is an object iff Φ.\nIf one has a contrast class in mind, then presumably one can\nsubstitute for Φ the negation of that contrast class, e.g.,\n“x is an object iff x is not a property”.\nBut that isn’t what it is to be an object. A real\ndefinition demands more. \nOne might think that object doesn’t have a real\ndefinition. It may be that the contrast class (property, say)\nis a natural class, but object is not. \nOntologies—roughly, abstract and systematic catalogues of the\nkinds of things there are—divide on the question of how objects\nrelate to their properties. On constituent ontologies,\nproperties are parts or constituents or components of the objects that\nhave them or that they characterize (see entry on\n mereology).\n So on constituent ontologies, a tall tree has tall, somehow,\nas a part or constituent or component. On relational\nontologies, properties are not in any sense parts or constituents or\ncomponents of the objects that have them or that they characterize. So\non relational ontologies, though a tall tree bears an interesting\nrelationship to tall (perhaps it bears the\ninstantiation relation to that property), tall is\nnot among the tree’s various parts or constituents or\n components.[23] \nWe will canvas three theories of objects that draw from constituent\nontologies, and then describe a relational alternative. \nConstituent ontologists agree that objects have properties or\nproperty-like items as constituents or parts. They disagree, however,\nover whether objects have additional non-property-like items as\nconstituents or parts and over how the constituents or parts of\nobjects are related. \nAccording to the bundle theory, objects are bundles of properties.\nDifferent theories of properties will make for different versions of\nthe bundle theory. The most common theories of properties for bundle\ntheorists to hold are\n trope theory (see entry on tropes)\n and immanent universals. \nOn the immanent universal version of the bundle theory, objects are\nbundles of universals, and those universals are located in space and\ntime. When some universals are in the same place and at the same time\n(and perhaps when some other condition is satisfied) that there is an\nobject that is the bundle of those universals. (For some bundle\ntheorists, not just any group of immanent universals forms a bundle.)\nThe way it’s often put is that objects are bundles of\ncoinstantiated universals, where the coinstantiation relation\nmay be a primitive\n relation.[24] \nOn the trope version of the bundle theory, objects are bundles of\ntropes. Like the immanent universal version, not just any collection\nof tropes forms a bundle which is an object; the tropes have to be\ncompresent. The compresence relation is taken to be\n primitive.[25] \nThe bundle theory is a theory about objects according to which objects\nare composed of items of a different kind or category (namely,\n properties).[26]\n So the bundle theory suggests that object has a contrast or\ncomplement. The bundle theory also suggests this broad answer to the\nExtension Question: whenever there is a bundle of coinstantiated\nuniversals (or, alternatively, compresent tropes), there is an object.\nThe extension of object includes all and only the bundles,\nand what bundles there are is determined by which immanent universals\nor tropes stand in the coinstantiation or compresence\n relation.[27] \nLike the bundle theory, bare particularism maintains that objects have\ntheir properties as constituents. But bare particularism adds that\nthere’s something else too. In addition to its properties, every\nobject has as a constituent a bare particular (or ‘thin\nparticular’ or ‘substratum’) that instantiates those\nproperties. Bare particulars are ‘bare’ in at least this\nsense: unlike objects, they have no properties as parts. \nBare particularism, then, is the conjunction of two theses. First,\nevery object has at least two kinds of constituents: its properties\nand its bare particular. Second, every object has its properties by\nhaving as constituents properties that are instantiated by another of\nits constituents: its bare particular. \nBare particulars play two important roles in the theory at hand.\nFirst, they are the subjects of properties or the items to\nwhich the properties are attached by instantiation or exemplification.\nThus Alston: \nWe must ask concerning any situation involving this relation (e.g., a\nexemplifying [Greenness]) what the relata are. One of them is a\nuniversal. What is the other? It will obviously not do to\nreply—a grum (defined as an instance of [greenness]); for this\nwould amount to saying that the relatum in question is that which\nstands in the instancing relation to [Greenness]; true enough but\nhardly enlightening. It still leaves open the question—what is\nit that stands in the instancing relation to [Greenness]? …the\nonly alternative left appears to be a ‘bare’ particular,\nor what I prefer to call a substratum. Once we see the need for\nsupplying an entity to which the universal involved bears the relation\nof being exemplified, we can see that only a bare particular would do\nthe job. (1954: 255) \nSecond, bare particulars individuate. Consider two objects\nthat are exactly alike in relevant respects (they are both royal blue,\nweigh 1kg, and so on); what could make them two and not\none? What might explain their distinctness? Since they are\nexactly alike in relevant respects no appeal to differences in their\nproperty-like constituents (being royal blue, weighing 1 kg, and so\non) would seem to do the trick. So, the bare particularists maintain,\nthere must be non-property-like constituents by virtue of which they\nare\n distinct.[28] \nAccording to hylomorphism, objects consist of matter and form\n(see entry on\n form vs. matter).\n Objects are comprised of various parts: electrons and upquarks, for\nexample. In addition to these ordinary material parts, objects have\nrather special components or\nconstituents—forms—property-like items that\ninform the matter of their host substance. Forms give objects\nstructure and shape and are what make each object the kind of thing it\nis. Forms account for the character or nature of objects; they are\nproperty-like in that respect. Socrates, for example, is a human\nanimal comprising form and matter; and Socrates is a human animal\nbecause he has a certain form as a constituent. \nHylomorphism may be thought of as a special case of or variation on\nthe bare particular view. For on hylomorphism, an object has both a\nproperty-like constituent (in this case, form) that bears a\nspecial tie to non-property-like constituents (in this case,\n matter).[29] \nWe turn now to relational ontologies. Constituent ontologies, recall,\nhave it that objects have properties as parts or constituents.\nRelational ontologies accept that the extension of both\nobject and property is not\n empty[30]—but\n for them, no object has any property as a part or constituent.\nObjects are, one might say with Armstrong, blobs (1989: 76–77).\nMost relational ontologists will be perfectly happy to say that\nobjects have parts—it’s just that none of those parts are\nproperties; they’re other objects. \nIn contrast to the constituent ontologies surveyed above, relational\nontologies posit no internal structure to objects beyond ordinary\nmereological structure. Objects are not layer-cakes of thin\nparticulars and properties (or layer-cakes of matter and form); they\nare blobs instead. Put this way, the blob view of objects has only\nnegative content; it tells us what objects are not. It\noffers, then, a partial account of the nature of objects, and thus\ninvites\n supplementation.[31] \nWe will now consider two relational ontologies and their implications\nfor the theory of objects. \nThe Platonist view of properties is that they are transcendent\nuniversals. They exist independently, and are outside of space and\ntime, unchanging, and causally inert. Clearly such things cannot be\nparts of ordinary material objects which are inside space and time,\nchange, and participate in causal chains. But objects still are red,\nlarge, heavy, and the like—and this in virtue of standing in\nsome relation to the transcendent universals. That relation is usually\ncalled exemplification or instantiation, and it is\ntaken as primitive. But, importantly, it is\nexternal—objects are related to things outside of\nthemselves—whereas the relation between object and property on\nconstituent ontologies is internal. \nSo, while Platonism is primarily a view about the nature of\nproperties, it has implications for the nature of objects. In\nparticular, it entails that they don’t have properties as parts.\nAs Armstrong puts the point: \nIt is interesting to notice that a separate-realm theory of universals\npermits of a blob as opposed to a layer-cake view of particulars. For\non this view, what is it for a thing to have a property? It is not the\nthing’s having some internal feature, but rather its having a\nrelationship, the instantiation relationship, to certain universals or\nForms in another realm. The thing itself could be bloblike. (Armstrong\n1989: 76–77) \nAs it turns out, Platonism is not the only account of properties that\nsits well with an unstructured or bloblike view of objects. \nOn class nominalism, properties are classes of things or classes of\npossible things. The property being green is the class of all\ngreen things, the property being wise is the class of all\nwise things, the relation is the sister of is the class of\nordered pairs the first member of which is the sister of the second\nmember, and so on.\n [32] \nFor an object to have (or exemplify, or instantiate, or whatever) a\nproperty, on this view, is for it to belong to a class of things.\nClass membership, like set membership, is an external relation; so\nclass nominalism sits best with a blob view of objects. van Inwagen\nexplains this connection as follows: \nAccording to Lewis [a class nominalist], a property is a set of\npossible objects. (Something is a property if and only if it is a set\nall of whose members are possible objects.) The property of being a\npig or porcinity, Lewis says, is simply the set of all possible\npigs—a set far larger than the set of actual pigs. Consider an\nactual pig, Freddy. Freddy of course has porcinity. And what is this\nrelation “having” that holds between the pig and the\nproperty? Why, simply set-membership. And the relation that a set of\npossibilia bears to its individual members is certainly not\nconstituency. Freddy is no doubt in some sense a constituent of the\nset of all possible pigs—‘constituent’ is a very\nflexible word, and it is probably flexible enough to permit that\napplication —, but there is no conceivable sense in which the\nset of all possible pigs is a constituent of Freddy.

Some are events; they fall under\nevent. And so on. One might well wonder—is there a\ncategory under which every thing falls? Offering an\ninformative account of such a category is no easy task. For nothing\nwould distinguish things that fall under it from those that\ndon’t—there being, after all, none of the latter. It seems\nhard, then, to say much about any fully general category; and it would\nappear to do no carving or categorizing or dividing at all.\nNonetheless there are candidates for such a fully general office,\nincluding thing, being, entity, item,\nexistent,\n\nand—especially—object.[2]\n \n\nIt is not obvious that there is any fully general category (whether\nobject or otherwise). Accordingly, not all accounts of\nobject assign it to a fully general category, instead\nallowing that there are non-objects. On those views, object\ndoes indeed divide.\n\n\nAccounts of object, then, differ with respect to whether\nthere are non-objects. And this is not the only fault line. Other\ndimensions of difference include what objects there are and\nwhat objects are. Accordingly, this entry will survey three\nbroad questions about the category object:\n\nWhat, if any, is its contrast or\ncomplement?\n\nWhat is its extension?\n\nWhat is its nature?\n\nEach of these questions admits of various specifications and answers\nthat we will consider in turn. Our focus will be largely theoretical\nand taxonomical, so we will only occasionally refer to historical\nsources. Our topic is abstract and broad, and touches on a number of\nissues in metaphysics that already enjoy coverage in this\nEncyclopedia. Our discussion of such topics will be brief; in\nthose cases, we will recommend consultation of the extant entries for\na more detailed treatment.\n\n\n\n\nThe Contrast Question, as we shall call it, is this: what, if\nany, is the contrast or complement of the category object?\nWith what, exactly, are objects to be contrasted? Put differently, are\nthere non-objects, and if so, what kinds of things are they? Some\nrelated questions: if there are non-objects, do they form a\n natural class\n or collection? What might that class or collection be? \nOn one natural reading, the Contrast Question admits of an easy\nanswer; fix—perhaps by stipulation—the content of\n‘object’ and it will be obvious whether there are\nnon-objects. Unsurprisingly, then, some philosophers suppose that\nthere is a fully general category and simply define\n‘object’ as picking it out. On this Umbrella\nView, as we shall call it, every thing is an object\n(perhaps by definition of ‘object’) and the category has\nno contrast—or, if it has a contrast or complement, the contrast\nis unfilled and the complement unrealized. \nIs the Umbrella View true? Dispute here may appear merely\nverbal, to merely concern how to use the word\n ‘object’.[3]\n This is not quite right, however. So to clarify: the Umbrella View\ninvolves both a substantive metaphysical thesis and a semantic thesis.\nThe metaphysical thesis is that there is a maximally general\nontological category under which all things fall. The semantic thesis\nis that ‘object’—perhaps as a matter of\nstipulation—picks out this maximally general category. Disputes\nover the Umbrella View, then, are merely verbal in part. They\nare merely verbal insofar as they concern the semantic thesis. But\ndisputes over the metaphysical thesis need not be—and in our\nview are not—merely verbal; they do not concern the English word\n‘object’, but rather concern the existence and extent of a\nwholly general ontological category. \nNote, too, that the component theses of the Umbrella View are\nlogically independent. First, the semantic thesis does not entail the\nmetaphysical thesis any more than the semantic thesis that\n‘God’—by definition—picks out a maximally\ngreat being entails the metaphysical thesis that there is indeed such\na being. Second, the metaphysical thesis does not entail the semantic\nthesis; that there is a maximally general category does not entail\nthat it is picked out by any word at all, much less the English word\n‘object’. \nA consequence of the Umbrella View is that items that appear to have\nlittle in common—universals, particulars, gods, books,\npossibilities, colleges, works of music (if such there are)—are\nin fact all united under one category: object. \nTo be sure, not all who endorse the Umbrella View deploy the English\nword ‘object’ in explicating the view. Other candidates\nfor the fully general office, instead, make an appearance. So\nLowe: \n‘Thing’, in its most general sense, is interchangeable\nwith ‘entity’ or ‘being’ and is applicable to\nany item whose existence is acknowledged by a system of ontology,\nwhether that item be particular, universal, abstract, or concrete. In\nthis sense, not only material bodies but also properties, relations,\nevents, numbers, sets, and propositions are—if they are\nacknowledged as existing—to be accounted ‘things’.\n(2005: 915) \nAnd Russell: \nI shall use as synonymous with [‘term’] the words unit,\nindividual and entity. The first two emphasize the fact that every\nterm is one, while the third is derived from the fact that every term\nhas being, i.e. is in some sense. A man, a moment, a number, a class,\na relation, a chimera, or anything else that can be mentioned, is sure\nto be a term (1903: 43) \nAnd Strawson: \nAnything whatever can be introduced into discussion by means of a\nsingular, definitely identifying substantival expression….\nAnything whatever can be identifyingly referred to; anything whatever\ncan appear as a logical subject, an ‘individual’. (1959:\n137, 227) \nFinally, Tugendhat: \nNow what is meant by the word ‘object’? This word too, in\nthe comprehensive sense in which it is used in philosophy, is a term\nof art. In ordinary language we are inclined to call only material\nobjects… objects, and not e.g. events or numbers… What\nis meant by ‘objects’ in philosophy has its basis in\n… what we mean by the word ‘something’…\nThere is a class of linguistic expressions which are used to stand for\nan object; and here we can only say: to stand for something. These are\nthe expressions which can function as the sentence-subject in\nso-called singular predicative statements and which in logic have also\nbeen called singular terms… (1976 [1982, 21–23]) \nAlthough they differ on which English word to assign to that category\n(i.e., ‘thing’, ‘term’, or\n‘individual’, ‘something’), Lowe, Russell,\nStrawson, and Tugendhat all accept a fully general category under\nwhich all items fall and suppose that some word picks out that\ncategory. They accept, then, the Umbrella View. \nSome features of the Umbrella View deserve explicit attention. \nOn the Umbrella View, it is unlikely that object can be\nanalyzed in more fundamental terms or categories, especially if\nanalysis of a condition or category involves specifying the complement\nof that condition. Object is, rather, a primitive of\nsorts. Frege affirms something along these lines when he notes of\n‘object’ that “a regular definition is impossible,\nsince we have here something too simple to admit of logical\nanalysis” (1891 [1960: 32]). \nBut it does not follow from the Umbrella View that nothing at all can\nbe said about the category object. For the above proponents\nof the Umbrella View, there is clearly a connection between being an\nobject and being a candidate for\n reference (see entry)\n or thought—something that can be referred to or\nthought about (witness Russell’s use of\n‘term’ above, for example). We will discuss this\nconnection—and the account of the nature of object that\nit suggests—in more detail in\n §3.1. \nFinally, note that there may be reason to be wary of any\nfully general category (whether expressed by ‘object’,\n‘thing’, ‘entity’, or whatnot.). There may be\nreason, that is, to doubt the metaphysical conjunct of the Umbrella\nView. First and perhaps most importantly, there are paradoxes and\npuzzles associated with talking about. or ‘quantifying\nover’, literally every\n thing.[4]\n Second, any fully general category lacks a contrast or complement. So\nit may appear to be idle with respect to classification or carving or\ndividing—the central theoretical tasks of categories, one might\nthink—thus inviting suspicion on the grounds that it is of no\ntheoretical use. \nIf there are non-objects, some obvious topics to pursue include what\nthey are and what they are like. Here we may appeal to various\ndistinctions metaphysicians have offered across disparate projects.\nThese distinctions may not map precisely onto an\nobject/non-object divide and may not have been formulated explicitly\nin those terms. But they can still offer insight into what the\ncontrast or complement of object might be and in turn shed\nlight on what the category of object might amount to. \nWe will now survey several such distinctions; in each case there is a\npurportedly exclusive and exhaustive classification of items into two\nnon-empty categories, one of which intuitively maps onto\nobject and the other onto non-object. \nConsider these platitudes: there are things, and there are ways those\nthings are (we might call the latter ‘properties’). There\nappear to be, for example, tall trees; there also appear to be\nproperties had by those trees, such as being\n tall.[5]\n There appear to be, again, both things and properties. Perhaps there\nis, then, an important distinction between things and properties. And\nif there is such a distinction, it would appear to mark an important\nmetaphysical divide. For it operates at a very high level of\nabstraction and promises to exhaustively and exclusively divide\nreality into categories—with trees, people, planets (for\nexample) falling under thing and green,\ntall, itchy, and kind (for example) falling\nunder property. The thesis that there is such a divide, we\nnote, is distinct from purely semantic theses about whether to use the\nwords ‘object’ and ‘property’ to pick out each\nside of that divide. Our focus here is on the metaphysical question of\nwhether there is such a contrast in the first place, not on which\nwords might express it. \nHere’s how Armstrong expresses the intuitive contrast: \nIt is natural to distinguish a thing, an individual, a token, from any\nparticular properties that the thing happens to have. The table is\nhard, brown, rectangular, and so on. But it is not identical with its\nhardness, brownness, rectangularity. These properties are rather\nnaturally taken to be things it merely has… With\nthings and properties thus distinguished, even if very intimately\nconnected, we have what may be called a substance-attribute view.\n(1989: 60) \nThese platitudes and the close connection we have already observed\nbetween object and thing suggest a hypothesis:\nperhaps the object/non-object distinction just is the thing/property\ndistinction. One intriguing consequence of this identity hypothesis is\nthat informative content may given to the object/non-object\ndivide—namely, by appeal to informative theories about the\nthing/property divide. \nWith this identity hypothesis in mind, we will now survey some\ntheories about what the thing/property distinction might amount to and\nhow exactly it divides reality. \nOur topic in this section is the thing/property or object/non-object\n(henceforth, the ‘object/property’) distinction—as\nopposed to the precise nature of either objects (see\n §3)\n or properties. We will thus elide some terminological details.\nInstead of treating only theories of the object/property distinction\nphrased precisely in those terms, we will canvas several attempts to\nmake sense of other nearby distinctions as well—most notably the\nsubstance/attribute distinction and the universal/particular\ndistinction. \nRussell offers a classic treatment of the object/property (in his\nhands, the ‘particular/universal’) divide and various ways\nin which it may be described: \nWe have thus a division of all entities into two classes: (1)\nparticulars, which enter into complexes only as the subjects of\npredicates or the terms of relations, and, if they belong to the world\nof which we have experience, exist in time, and cannot occupy more\nthan one place at one time in the space to which they belong; (2)\nuniversals, which can occur as predicates or relations in complexes,\ndo not exist in time, and have no relation to one place which they may\nnot simultaneously have to another. (1911: 23–24) \nRussell’s remarks suggest at least three explications of the\nobject/property distinction—in terms of subject/predicate\nstructure, existence in space and time, and multiple-location. We will\nconsider these three theories in that order, and then some others that\nhave been\n offered.[6] \nOne way to make the distinction between objects and properties is to\nlook to expressions that refer to them. In first-order logic, there\nare (among other things) subjects and predicates. And predicates are\npredicated of subjects. Following Aristotle’s remarks on\nsubstance (Categories 1a20–4b19; see also the section\non\n category theory in the entry on Aristotle\n and the entry on\n classical logic),\n Russell (1911) thought that these logical/linguistic reasons were the\nmost persuasive reasons for positing an object/property distinction.\nHe says: \nPredication is a relation involving a fundamental logical difference\nbetween its two terms. Predicates may themselves have predicates, but\nthe predicates of predicates will be radically different from the\npredicates of substances. (1911:\n 23)[7] \nSo, on this way of marking the contrast, objects can be referred to\nonly by subjects, and properties can be referred to by subjects or\npredicates. \nPerhaps there is a particular shade of red that no object has right\nnow, but some objects had and other objects will have. If there is\nsuch a shade of red—if it didn’t go out of existence when\nthe last object that had it stopped having it—one naturally\nwonders where it is. And a natural answer is that it isn’t (and\nhas never been nor ever will be) anywhere. More generally, universals\nare nowhere. Objects, by contrast, are somewhere; they are to be found\nwithin space and time, and in this respect stand in stark and\ncategorial contrast to\n universals.[8] \nIt seems that many properties are shared among objects. Our copies of\nObjects: Nothing out of the Ordinary are the same shape, and\nthe gold hue of Knute Rockne’s helmet is the same as Joe\nMontana’s. But there isn’t just one copy of Objects:\nNothing out of the Ordinary that is multiply located; there are\nmany copies that share a shape. There isn’t one Notre Dame\nfootball helmet; there are hundreds. The books and helmets are many;\neach of their properties is, perhaps, one. \nSo one might make the distinction between objects and properties.\nObjects are restricted to one space-time region, while properties are\nnot. Most objects will occupy many space-time regions by having parts\nat those regions, though. So it is better to say that objects can be\nwholly located at only one region, while properties can be wholly\nlocated at many disjoint\n regions.[9] \nAnother attempt to analyze the object/property distinction is to\nsubsume it under the concrete/abstract distinction. According to some,\nsome things are concrete and others are abstract. Some have it that\nthere are concrete objects and\n abstract objects (see entry).\n The former are usually described as material and having\n causal powers (see entry on the metaphysics of causation),\n while the latter are usually thought to immaterial and lack causal\npowers. While usually the latter are classified as objects, it is a\nsensible view that the concrete things are objects, and the abstracta\nare otherwise. \nBut the concrete/abstract distinction seems no more perspicuous than\nthe object/property distinction, and itself cries out for explication.\nNearly everyone can agree on the things that belong in each category,\nbut precisely in virtue of what they belong in that category remains a\nmatter of debate. Perhaps this is a reason to rest content with\nthinking of the object/property distinction as the abstract/concrete\ndistinction. The latter seems intuitive, and resists analysis in more\nfundamental\n terms.[10] \nTwo laws are associated with Leibniz. The first is the\nIndiscernibility of Identicals: for any two objects, if they’re\nidentical, then any property that one has, the other has. The second\nis the\n Identity of Indiscernibles (see entry):\n for any two objects, if it’s the case that for any property one\nhas, the other has it, then the objects are identical. \nThe Indiscernibility of Identicals is pretty much universally\naccepted. The Identity of Indiscernibles is controversial. The\nIdentity of Indiscernibles seems to entail, for example, that there\ncannot be two spheres that have the same color, shape, and density,\nand have all their other properties in common as well. \nMany people think there can be two exactly similar spheres. But it\ndoesn’t seem that there could be two exactly similar properties\nof sphericality that aren’t identical. Properties, one\nmight think, are individuated by their properties, whereas objects are\nindividuated by some further thing. If a property has all the same\nproperties as another, then the two are identical. \nThis is one way of marking the distinction. The Indiscernibility of\nIdenticals is true of properties, but false of objects. \nStrawson marks the distinction in the following way: \nThere is, for example, the suggestion that general, unlike particular,\nthings cannot be perceived by means of the senses… It is not\nwith the eyes that one is said to see hope. But one can quite\nliterally smell blood or bacon, watch cricket, hear music or thunder.\n(1954: 235) \nSo properties (like hope) are the things that cannot be perceived, and\nobjects (like bacon) are the things can be perceived. Presumably every\nthing is such that either it can be perceived or it can’t be,\nand nothing both can be perceived and can’t, so the division is\nexclusive and exhaustive. \nBut bacon also has a color and a shape, which seem to be perceived\nwhen one perceives bacon. One who marks the distinction this way must\nsay that we perceive only the bacon, and not its color and shape. But\nwhy do we believe that the bacon is rectangular, if we don’t see\nits rectangularity? Presumably we believe it because we perceive the\nbacon, and the bacon is\n rectangular.[11] \nThe final view of the object/property contrast to consider is the view\nthat properties are instantiated, and objects are not. This is, as it\nwere, a metaphysical correlate of the linguistic view discussed in\n §1.2.1.\n and enjoys similar motivations. Instantiation is generally\ntaken as primitive, but some things can be said about it. On one view,\nit’s a two-place relation (see entry on\n relations),\n and the relata are an object and a property, or a property and a\nproperty. On another view, it’s a “non-relational\ntie” that “glues” properties to objects and other\nproperties (see, e.g., Strawson 1959). Objects can only be the things\nthat instantiate; they cannot be instantiated. Properties, by\ncontrast, can both instantiate and be instantiated. \nIn surveying the possible contrasts or complements of object,\nwe have thus far emphasized the intuitive grouping of items into\ncategories like object (substance,\nindividual, particular, etc.) on the one hand and\nproperty (or attribute, universal, feature,\netc.) on the other. These are standard metaphysical categories, and\nthey suggest that the proper contrast or complement of object\nincludes properties or other property-like items. \nBut there is another compelling usage (both in and out of philosophy)\nof the English word ‘object’ and its cognates that\nsuggests a rather different kind of contrast. Here, the divide is\nbetween object and subject. Each object is, roughly,\nan ‘it’, and each subject is a ‘you’. On this\nusage, it is items like us that stand in contrast to objects.\nWe are subjects; trees, universals, colleges, colors, and—well,\nall things not like us in relevant respects—are objects. \nBut what are the relevant respects that group us together to\nthe exclusion of trees, universals, colleges, and colors? Here the\nanswer must involve subjectivity or experience. To\nbe a subject in this sense is, roughly, to experience or to be\n conscious (see entry).\n We are subjects because we experience or enjoy consciousness. But\nwhat is it to be an object and not a subject in the sense at hand?\nReflection on this question suggests two answers and thus uncovers two\nrather different subject/object divides. They differ in what category\nthey assign to object and thus in what they contrast with\nsubject. \nOn the first divide, the relevant objectual category is just the\ncomplement of subject; to be an object, then, is to neither\nexperience nor be conscious. You are a subject and so am I. But an\nunfeeling rock is not, and so it is an object. Since every thing would\nappear to be either a subject in the relevant sense or not, this\ndivide would appear to exhaustively and exclusively classify\nreality. \nOn the second divide, the relevant objectual category is object of\nexperience, or what is experienced (see entry on\n the contents of perception).\n You—a subject—plunge your hand into a bucket of ice\nwater. You feel just how cold the water—the object of your\nexperience—is. As Bliss puts things: \nThe subject is that to which objects appear, have appeared,\nor may appear… The object, existing external to and independent\nof subjects, may appear to any subject that is so qualified and so\nrelated as to apprehend it. (1917: 406–408, emphasis\noriginal) \nThis second subject/object divide would appear to be neither\nexhaustive nor exclusive; a subject may also be the object of\nexperience (whether her own or someone else’s), and some items\nmay well be neither experiencers nor objects of experience (an\nunfeeling star outside the light cone of any subject, for\nexample). \nWe note, finally, that these specifications of an object/non-object\ndistinction are not in competition with the other surveyed above. \nOne question to ask about the category of object is to ask\nwhat falls under it—what is in its extension? This is the\nExtension Question. The extension of some categories is\nobvious. The extension of the category electron is all the\nelectrons and no non-electrons. The extension of the category\nnumber is all and only the numbers. The extension of the\ncategory composite things is all and only the things that\nhave proper\n parts.[12]\n For some categories, difficult questions arise. Some of those\nquestions involve the question of whether certain things are in the\nextension of the category, e.g., is the Pope in the extension of the\ncategory bachelor? Is a fetus in the extension of the\ncategory person? Some questions concern the nature of the\nthings falling under the category. The extension of the category\nbook includes all and only the books. Does it include ebooks?\nDoes it include some particular and well-loved copy of Material\nBeings, with its stained pages and cover, or the abstract type of\nwhich this particular copy is a token? Answering the Extension\nQuestion leaves many other questions unsettled, one of which is the\nnature of the things that are in the extension. But knowing which\nthings are in the extension is a good start toward figuring out their\nnature. \nSo, one important question to ask of the category object is\nwhich things are in its extension. This question will admit a variety\nof answers. And depending on whether there is a contrast class, it\nwill have a variety of interpretations. If object has no\ncontrast class and every thing is in its extension—if both the\nmetaphysical and semantic theses of the Umbrella View are\ncorrect—then the question of the extension of object is\nequivalent to the ontological question (see below). If object\nhas a contrast class—if at least one of the metaphysical and\nsemantic theses of the Umbrella View is false—then the question\nof the extension of object is not equivalent to the\nontological question. Instead, it asks, “Of all the things there\nare, which ones are the objects?” If the contrast class of\nobject is property, then the Extension Question is,\n“What things are there that aren’t properties?” If\nthe contrast class is universal, the question is, “What\nthings are there that aren’t universals?” If the contrast\nclass hasn’t been specified, and one is starting from what\nordinary people accept, then the Extension Question is, “What\nordinary objects are there?” \nIt widely-held that a central question in ontology—what is often\ncalled ‘the ontological question’—is “What is\nthere?” Though many have asked this question, it was Quine\n(1948) who drew explicit attention to it. He also said it could be\nanswered in one\n word—“everything”.[13] \nIf the answer to the ontological question is ‘everything’,\nif there is a category under which all things fall and if that\ncategory is picked out by ‘object’ by definition\n(as per the Umbrella View), then there is one shared answer to both\nthe extension and the ontological questions. This is one consequence\nof the Umbrella View. But it might turn out that every thing is an\nobject, even if not by definition. A physicalism according to which\nevery thing is a material object, for example, would appear to entail\nthat every thing is an object. But this entailment need not hold\nbecause of the definition of ‘object’; it might hold,\ninstead, on substantive and general theoretical grounds having nothing\nto do with definitions at all. \nThe point is this: on at least the Umbrella View, answering the\nontological question is closely related, if not identical, to\nanswering the Extension Question. We will therefore briefly survey\nseveral highly abstract answers to the ontological question, with the\nunderstanding that many will think that by giving such an answer, they\nare thereby answering the Extension Question. \nPerhaps the most surprising answer to the ontological question is\n‘Nothing’, according to which the extension of\nobject is empty. It’s not clear whether anyone\nsincerely endorses the thesis that there is nothing. However, it has\nbeen defended several times over. \nHawthorne and Cortens (1995) speak for the nihilist thus: “the\nconcept of an object has no place in a perspicuous characterization of\nreality” (p. 143). They suggest three theories on which there\nare no objects. The first that there are just stuffs everywhere, but\nno objects. The second that there is just one big mass of\n stuff.[14]\n The third is that there just isn’t anything at all. This last\noption is what Hawthorne and Cortens defend. They do so using what\nthey (following Strawson) call a “feature-placing\nlanguage”. They model a potential nihilist program on sentences\nlike “it is raining”, “it is snowing now”, and\n“it is cold here”. Such sentences do not quantify over\nanything and have no logical subject (‘it’ functions as a\ndummy pronoun), and so do not ontologically commit one to anything.\nThe nihilist may then paraphrase sentences that apparently require\nobjects (such as “there is a computer here”) with those\nthat do not (such as “it is computering here”). In short,\nthe nihilist turns every putative noun into an adverb, making\njudicious use of spatial, temporal, and numerical adverbs too. \nTurner (2011) agrees with Hawthorne and Cortens that the chief task of\nthe ontological nihilist is to give paraphrases of ordinary language\nthat don’t contain quantification over objects: \nWith this in mind, we demand the following of our Ontological\nNihilist: give us a systematic recipe for taking any sentence of a\nfirst-order language (with predicates assumed to be predicates of our\nbest science) and cooking up the ontologically innocent claim it was\nsupposed to be getting at all along. (2011: 11) \nThese strategies by which to eliminate object-talk suggest a defensive\nmove available to nihilists: paraphrase apparently true sentences that\nappear to require objects into sentences that do not. Such a strategy\nmay neutralize objections to nihilism. But another question remains;\nis there reason to affirm nihilism in the first place? \nOne such reason may derive from nihilism’s economy.\nDasgupta (2009) thinks that objects (he calls them\n“individuals”) are physically redundant and empirically\nundetectable. More precisely, he thinks that every physical theory\nconsidered over the past 400 years entails that objects are physically\nredundant and empirically undetectable. They’re empirically\nundetectable because two situations differing only in their\nindividualistic facts are indistinguishable. And they’re\nphysically redundant because two systems that only differ with respect\nto their individualistic facts will continue to only differ with\nrespect to those facts. And given two theories—the only\ndifference between the two being that one posits physically redundant\nand empirically undetectable things—we should prefer the one\nthat does not. \nDasgupta says that if there are no individuals, then the fundamental\nfacts are all general facts, like \\(\\exists xFx\\), \\(\\exists x\\exists\nyGxy\\), and the like (see also Dasgupta 2016). But what do the\nvariables range over in those sentences? Individuals? Objects? To\nbypass such questions, we must construct a language that doesn’t\nquantify over objects. Dasgupta uses a version of predicate\nfunctorese, which replaces individuals with predicates and a defined\nadicity. So instead of “x is round”,\n“something is round”, or “something loves\nsomeone”, we have “Round1 obtains”,\n“cRound1 obtains”, and\n“ccLoves2 obtains”. In systematically doing\nthis for all sentences, we can do away with all reference to objects,\nreplacing them with general states of affairs. And since individuals\nare physically redundant and empirically undetectable, this is a good\nthing. \nThe aforementioned authors all seem to agree that if first-order\nlogic, which quantifies over objects, can be replaced with a logic\nthat doesn’t so quantify, or one can give a translation of every\nintuitively true sentence of first-order logic into another language\nthat doesn’t quantify over objects, then ontological nihilism is\nvindicated. That is, if one can give an “ontologically\ninnocent” (that is, one that doesn’t quantify over\nanything) paraphrase of every sentence, or a scheme for so doing, then\nontological nihilism is on good footing. \nExistence Monism, chiefly sponsored in recent times by Horgan and\nPotrč, says that there is exactly one\n object.[15]\n (Or at least, exactly one concrete object, or one concrete physical\nobject.) The one thing (which Horgan and Potrč call ‘the\nblobject’) is huge, and very complex, though it does not have\nany parts. It has different properties at different regions (2000: 249\nand 2008: 8). \nOn Horgan and Potrč’s view, common-sense statements are\ntrue, but not made true by any thing(s) other than the only thing\nthere is—the blobject. So truth isn’t direct\ncorrespondence between propositions and the parts of the world\nthey’re about, but rather between propositions and the entire\nworld—indirect correspondence (2000: 250–51). \nOne compelling argument for existence monism (2000: §2.4, also\nSchaffer (2007)) is that the complete causal story of the world can be\ntold in terms of the world and the laws without appeal or reference to\nparts of the world. So, if there were parts of the world, they would\nbe redundant and/or\n epiphenomenal (see entry).\n But we shouldn’t posit explanatorily redundant or epiphenomenal\nthings. So, we shouldn’t posit parts of the world. So, only one\nobject—the world—exists. \nOne compelling argument against existence monism takes a Moorean\nshape. Russell (1918 [1985: 36]) says,  \nI share the common-sense belief that there are many separate things; I\ndo not regard the apparent multiplicity of the world as consisting\nmerely in phases and unreal divisions of a single indivisible Reality.\n \nIf the multiplicity of things is really this obvious, the point may be\nextended: the rejection of one of the premises of any valid argument\nthat has as a conclusion that there is only one concrete object will\nalways be more plausible than accepting the\n conclusion.[16] \nExistence pluralism is the view that there is more than one thing.\nCertainly existence pluralism is the standard view—even among\nmetaphysicians. Indeed, most people think that there are a great many\nthings. The conjunction of the Umbrella View and existence pluralism\nentails that there is more than one object. But if one thinks there\nare a great many things, one might also think that they are not all\nobjects. And so existence pluralists may want to try to treat the\nontological question as distinct from the Extension Question (for\nthem, see\n §2.2). \nOne exception is nominalism; or at least, one version of nominalism is\nan exception. Although nominalism is widely discussed in ontology,\nprecisely what the view is differs. Some say that nominalism is the\nview that there are no abstracta or universals. Others say that\nnominalism is the view that the correct answer to the ontological\nquestion is ‘particulars’, or ‘concrete\nthings’, or ‘objects’. \nFor the proponent of the latter formulation of nominalism, the\nExtension Question is the ontological question; if she thinks there\nare only objects, then she’ll think that whatever is in the\nextension of object is all there is. (But not because she\nholds the Umbrella View.) The proponent of the former formulation may\ncountenance non-abstracta or non-universals that aren’t objects.\nAnd so she might pursue the ontological question and the Extension\nQuestion separately. \nThere are other views of what there is that are less general than\nexistence nihilism, existence monism, existence pluralism, or\nnominalism. For example, possibilism is the view that there are merely\npossible objects (see\n section on possibilist realism in the entry on possible objects).\n This view doesn’t say that every thing is a merely possible\nthing; it just says that the answer to the ontological question ought\nto include merely possible things. Mereological universalism says that\nwhenever you have two or more things, there is an object composed of\nall and only those things (see\n section on permissivism in entry on ordinary objects).\n It doesn’t tell you that every thing is a composite thing; it\njust says that the answer to the ontological question needs to include\nsuch objects. Perdurantism says that objects are composed of temporal\nparts—at each time at which an object exists, there is an\ninstantaneous object composed of all its parts at that time and is a\npart of it at that time, so those objects ought to be in the extension\nof the answer to the ontological question (see entry on\n temporal parts).\n Meinongianism says that there are non-existent objects, so they would\ninclude those objects in the extension of the answer to the\nontological question (see entry on\n nonexistent objects). \nThese views are partial answers to the ontological question. They are\npartial answers because they tell us what there is, but they\ndon’t tell us everything there is. \nIf—contra the Umbrella View—it is not true by\ndefinition that ‘object’ picks out a maximally\ngeneral category, then there may be things that are not objects. So\nthe Extension Question may turn out to have a different answer than\nthe ontological question. And even if one and the same class or\ncollection is identified as the correct answer to each question, it\ndoes not follow that the questions are the same; even if everything is\nan object, it need not be true by definition that the extension of\n‘object’ is just what there is. So we will also survey\nanswers to the Extension Question that have it that object\npicks out (at least intensionally) a different group of things than\none’s answer to the ontological question. \nFor those who don’t accept the Umbrella View, the Extension\nQuestion is distinct from the ontological question. What, then, does\nthe Extension Question amount to? Presumably one who denies the\nUmbrella View thinks that there are objects, and non-objects. Put\nanother way, her answer to the ontological question includes objects\nand other things. For her, the Extension Question is the following: of\nall the things there are, which ones are the objects? Those who deny\nthe Umbrella View have a variety of ways of dividing the objects from\nthe non-objects, which we discussed in\n §1.2. \nAnother way of dividing the objects from the non-objects is not by\nfirst answering the ontological question and then picking out the\nobjects from all the things, or by answering the Contrast Question and\nthen placing things into either object or its contrast class.\nRather, one could simply start with the Extension Question—one\ncould start by listing the obvious and ordinary candidates for the\noffice of object (see entry on\n ordinary objects). \nA common way to start would be by listing the things we ordinarily\ntake to be objects in our pre-philosophical approach to the world.\nRecall the Tugendhat quotation from above: “In ordinary language\nwe are inclined to call only material objects\n‘objects’.” The view is that the extension of\nobject is all and only the things we normally think about and\ntalk about and refer to and use. These things are nameable,\nidentifiable, stable, and persist through time. Examples include bees,\nerasers, pillows, and boats. \nTwo thoughts arise. First, such an answer to the Extension Question\nleads to many puzzles and problems. Second, simply listing all the\nthings is pretty dissatisfying as an answer to the Extension Question.\nBetter to give a general answer and then see what it entails—in\nparticular, what entailments it has for the Extension Question. What\nfollows is one method for giving a general answer to what objects\nthere\n are.[17] \nMost who have considered the Extension Question probably think there\nare such objects as photons, electrons, quarks and other things that\nscience deals with—the fundamental physical particles. And those\nthings seem to make up other things, like atoms, molecules, elements,\ncells, and so on up the size chain to medium-sized dry goods, large\nbuildings, mountains, and planets. \nSo it seems that things are often composed of other things. But under\nwhat conditions does composition occur? van Inwagen (1990) calls this\n‘The Special Composition Question’ (hereafter ‘the\nSCQ’). More precisely, the SCQ calls for filling in for Φ in\nthe following sentence: For any xs, there exists a y\nsuch that the xs compose y iff Φ. An answer must be\nnon-analytic and must have only ‘the xs’\n free.[18] \nHere are some candidate answers to the SCQ. Contact:\n‘the xs are in\ncontact’. Life:\n‘the xs are caught up in a life’. Mereological\nNihilism:\n‘there is only one of the xs’. Mereological\nUniversalism:\n‘the xs are one or more in number’. \nAnyone who denies the Umbrella View and who has an answer to the SCQ\ncan consider that as a partial answer to the Extension Question. What\nobjects are there? Contact\nsays that there are the xs, and for\nany xs that are in contact, there’s another object (the\none that’s composed of them). Life\nsays that there are the xs, and for any\nxs that are caught up in a life, there’s another object\n(the one that’s composed of them). Mereological\nNihilism says that there are just the\nxs, and no other objects. Mereological\nUniversalism says that there are the\nxs, for any xs at all (no matter how they are arranged),\nthere’s another object (the one that’s composed of them).\nAnd so on for other answers. \nThus far we have asked two questions of object: (i) what, if\nany, is its contrast? (ii) what things, if any, are in its extension?\nThese questions might also be phrased as the questions of what\nnon-objects there are and of what objects there are. We turn now to\nour final question: (iii) supposing there are objects, what are they\nlike? What is their nature? \nOne way to specify the nature of a category is to note the theoretical\nrole it plays or the role played by items within it. This is to say\nwhat items within the category do. Another is to give a real\ndefinition of the category (or the items within it), where a real\ndefinition attempts to identify the real essence of the members of the\ncategory. This is to say what items of within category are\n(see entries on\n theoretical terms in science\n and\n Locke on real essence\n and the\n section on real and nominal definitions in the entry on definitions). \nIn this section, we will consider attempts to state the nature of\nobjects. As with our treatment of the Contrast Question, our\ndiscussion will elide some terminological details. Instead of treating\nonly theories of the nature of objects phrased in precisely those\nterms, we will canvas several attempts to state the nature of nearby\ncategories as well—most notably substance and\nparticular—treating them as giving a theory of the\nnature of objects. \nOne way to explain a thing or category is to mark out what it\ndoes—its role. Since object is, on any view at all, a\nhighly abstract and general category, the relevant role by which\nobject might be defined must itself be highly abstract and\n general.[19]\n Three examples: \nFirst, various linguistic items, it seems, denote or refer.\n“Armstrong” denotes Armstrong, “redness”\ndenotes redness, “the successor of zero” denotes the\nnumber 1, and so on. Reflection on these platitudes brings to the fore\na role that we might call being an object of reference (or\nperhaps some related modal notion such as possibly being an object\nof reference or being eligible for reference). \nSecond, domains (classes or pluralities), it seems, are associated\nwith quantifiers (expressions like “some” and\n“every”). “Everything is so-and-so” quantifies\nover all items within an inclusive domain (maximally inclusive, one\nthinks) and says of each of those items that it is so-and-so.\nReflection on these platitudes brings to the fore a role we might call\nbeing quantified over, or perhaps some related modal notion\nsuch as possibly being quantified over or being a\ncandidate for being quantified over. \nThird, some thoughts are, it seems, about things. The thought that\nAristotle was a philosopher is at least in part about a certain\nperson—Aristotle. The thought that doing metaphysics is a fine\npastime is at least in part about a certain activity. And the thought\nthat Platonism is sensible is at least in part about a certain\nphilosophical theory. Reflection on these platitudes brings to the\nfore a role we might call being an object of thought or\nbeing thought of, or perhaps some related modal notion such\nas being possibly thought\n of.[20] \nThese three examples isolate highly abstract or general\nroles—being an object of reference, being quantified over, or\nbeing thought of. These roles are specified, as it were, by form\nrather than content; the roles alone impose very few limitations or\nrequirements on the kinds of things that fill them. Plausibly, for\nexample, both concrete material objects and abstract propositions\nalike might satisfy any of these roles. \nAnd each role suggests, in turn, a theory of what objects are: (i) to\nbe an object just is to be a referent, (ii) to be an object just is to\nbe quantified over, and (iii) to be an object just is to be an object\nof\n thought.[21]\n van Inwagen offers a version of (i) here (note the use of\n“can”, indicating that it is a modal role that\nobjects play, namely being possible referents; we here presuppose the\nalready mentioned tight connection between ‘object’ and\n‘thing’): \nThe most general metaphysical category is the category\n“thing”. I use ‘thing’ as the most general\ncount-noun. Everything is a thing. A thing is anything that can be\nreferred to by a third-person singular pronoun—as when I say,\n“The following is true of everything, that it is identical with\nitself.” The category “thing” comprises everything\nthere is, everything that exists (for I take a stern anti-Meinongian\nline about non-existents: non-existents simply don’t exist: the\nnumber of them is 0). (2007: 199) \nThese role-theoretic specifications of what it is to be an object will\nhave consequences with respect to the Extension Question and the\nContrast Question. If literally every thing at all is eligible for\nreference or quantification or thought, for example, then literally\nevery thing would be an object, a thesis in line with the Umbrella\nView. If, on the other hand, some items are not eligible for reference\nor quantification or thought, then such items would fall under\nnon-object, and the category object would turn out\nto have a contrast or complement. Similarly, if , say, both concrete\nmaterial objects, abstract propositions are eligible for reference or\nquantification or thought, then items of both sorts would fall under\nthe extension of\n object.[22] \nSome think there’s more to being an object than playing a\nparticular theoretical role. On this view, what it is for something to\nbe an object is a matter of that thing’s intrinsic character or\nnature. One way of giving the intrinsic nature of a thing is by giving\na real definition. Says Dasgupta (2014), a real definition is: \na statement of what something is… For example, when one says\nthat {Socrates} is the unique singleton containing Socrates, one is\ndefining what the set is—that is, giving its real definition.\nOr, equivalently, one is stating its essence or nature… (2014:\n577) \nStatements of what something is—of a thing’s essence or\nnature—could take a variety of forms. One says what it is to be\nthat thing; the real definition of x might be put: to be\nx is to be y. Or the real definition of a category\nF: to be an F is to be a G. When one says,\n“To be a bachelor is to be an unmarried male”, one is\ngiving the real definition of bachelorhood. \nAnother way is to say what is essential to an object or category, as\nsuggested by Fine (1995): It is essential to x that Φ. Or,\nit is essential to Fs that Φ. \nIn any case, the task at hand is not to write a section about what it\nis to be a real definition, but rather how the notion relates to\nobject. \nIf one thinks real definitions best get at the nature of things, and\none is interested in stating the nature of object or of\nobjects, there are two options. One is to substitute for Φ in the\nfollowing: To be an object is to be Φ. The second is to substitute\nfor Φ in the following: It is essential to objects that Φ. \nNote the difference between this method and the method of giving\nnecessary and sufficient conditions: x is an object iff Φ.\nIf one has a contrast class in mind, then presumably one can\nsubstitute for Φ the negation of that contrast class, e.g.,\n“x is an object iff x is not a property”.\nBut that isn’t what it is to be an object. A real\ndefinition demands more. \nOne might think that object doesn’t have a real\ndefinition. It may be that the contrast class (property, say)\nis a natural class, but object is not. \nOntologies—roughly, abstract and systematic catalogues of the\nkinds of things there are—divide on the question of how objects\nrelate to their properties. On constituent ontologies,\nproperties are parts or constituents or components of the objects that\nhave them or that they characterize (see entry on\n mereology).\n So on constituent ontologies, a tall tree has tall, somehow,\nas a part or constituent or component. On relational\nontologies, properties are not in any sense parts or constituents or\ncomponents of the objects that have them or that they characterize. So\non relational ontologies, though a tall tree bears an interesting\nrelationship to tall (perhaps it bears the\ninstantiation relation to that property), tall is\nnot among the tree’s various parts or constituents or\n components.[23] \nWe will canvas three theories of objects that draw from constituent\nontologies, and then describe a relational alternative. \nConstituent ontologists agree that objects have properties or\nproperty-like items as constituents or parts. They disagree, however,\nover whether objects have additional non-property-like items as\nconstituents or parts and over how the constituents or parts of\nobjects are related. \nAccording to the bundle theory, objects are bundles of properties.\nDifferent theories of properties will make for different versions of\nthe bundle theory. The most common theories of properties for bundle\ntheorists to hold are\n trope theory (see entry on tropes)\n and immanent universals. \nOn the immanent universal version of the bundle theory, objects are\nbundles of universals, and those universals are located in space and\ntime. When some universals are in the same place and at the same time\n(and perhaps when some other condition is satisfied) that there is an\nobject that is the bundle of those universals. (For some bundle\ntheorists, not just any group of immanent universals forms a bundle.)\nThe way it’s often put is that objects are bundles of\ncoinstantiated universals, where the coinstantiation relation\nmay be a primitive\n relation.[24] \nOn the trope version of the bundle theory, objects are bundles of\ntropes. Like the immanent universal version, not just any collection\nof tropes forms a bundle which is an object; the tropes have to be\ncompresent. The compresence relation is taken to be\n primitive.[25] \nThe bundle theory is a theory about objects according to which objects\nare composed of items of a different kind or category (namely,\n properties).[26]\n So the bundle theory suggests that object has a contrast or\ncomplement. The bundle theory also suggests this broad answer to the\nExtension Question: whenever there is a bundle of coinstantiated\nuniversals (or, alternatively, compresent tropes), there is an object.\nThe extension of object includes all and only the bundles,\nand what bundles there are is determined by which immanent universals\nor tropes stand in the coinstantiation or compresence\n relation.[27] \nLike the bundle theory, bare particularism maintains that objects have\ntheir properties as constituents. But bare particularism adds that\nthere’s something else too. In addition to its properties, every\nobject has as a constituent a bare particular (or ‘thin\nparticular’ or ‘substratum’) that instantiates those\nproperties. Bare particulars are ‘bare’ in at least this\nsense: unlike objects, they have no properties as parts. \nBare particularism, then, is the conjunction of two theses. First,\nevery object has at least two kinds of constituents: its properties\nand its bare particular. Second, every object has its properties by\nhaving as constituents properties that are instantiated by another of\nits constituents: its bare particular. \nBare particulars play two important roles in the theory at hand.\nFirst, they are the subjects of properties or the items to\nwhich the properties are attached by instantiation or exemplification.\nThus Alston: \nWe must ask concerning any situation involving this relation (e.g., a\nexemplifying [Greenness]) what the relata are. One of them is a\nuniversal. What is the other? It will obviously not do to\nreply—a grum (defined as an instance of [greenness]); for this\nwould amount to saying that the relatum in question is that which\nstands in the instancing relation to [Greenness]; true enough but\nhardly enlightening. It still leaves open the question—what is\nit that stands in the instancing relation to [Greenness]? …the\nonly alternative left appears to be a ‘bare’ particular,\nor what I prefer to call a substratum. Once we see the need for\nsupplying an entity to which the universal involved bears the relation\nof being exemplified, we can see that only a bare particular would do\nthe job. (1954: 255) \nSecond, bare particulars individuate. Consider two objects\nthat are exactly alike in relevant respects (they are both royal blue,\nweigh 1kg, and so on); what could make them two and not\none? What might explain their distinctness? Since they are\nexactly alike in relevant respects no appeal to differences in their\nproperty-like constituents (being royal blue, weighing 1 kg, and so\non) would seem to do the trick. So, the bare particularists maintain,\nthere must be non-property-like constituents by virtue of which they\nare\n distinct.[28] \nAccording to hylomorphism, objects consist of matter and form\n(see entry on\n form vs. matter).\n Objects are comprised of various parts: electrons and upquarks, for\nexample. In addition to these ordinary material parts, objects have\nrather special components or\nconstituents—forms—property-like items that\ninform the matter of their host substance. Forms give objects\nstructure and shape and are what make each object the kind of thing it\nis. Forms account for the character or nature of objects; they are\nproperty-like in that respect. Socrates, for example, is a human\nanimal comprising form and matter; and Socrates is a human animal\nbecause he has a certain form as a constituent. \nHylomorphism may be thought of as a special case of or variation on\nthe bare particular view. For on hylomorphism, an object has both a\nproperty-like constituent (in this case, form) that bears a\nspecial tie to non-property-like constituents (in this case,\n matter).[29] \nWe turn now to relational ontologies. Constituent ontologies, recall,\nhave it that objects have properties as parts or constituents.\nRelational ontologies accept that the extension of both\nobject and property is not\n empty[30]—but\n for them, no object has any property as a part or constituent.\nObjects are, one might say with Armstrong, blobs (1989: 76–77).\nMost relational ontologists will be perfectly happy to say that\nobjects have parts—it’s just that none of those parts are\nproperties; they’re other objects. \nIn contrast to the constituent ontologies surveyed above, relational\nontologies posit no internal structure to objects beyond ordinary\nmereological structure. Objects are not layer-cakes of thin\nparticulars and properties (or layer-cakes of matter and form); they\nare blobs instead. Put this way, the blob view of objects has only\nnegative content; it tells us what objects are not. It\noffers, then, a partial account of the nature of objects, and thus\ninvites\n supplementation.[31] \nWe will now consider two relational ontologies and their implications\nfor the theory of objects. \nThe Platonist view of properties is that they are transcendent\nuniversals. They exist independently, and are outside of space and\ntime, unchanging, and causally inert. Clearly such things cannot be\nparts of ordinary material objects which are inside space and time,\nchange, and participate in causal chains. But objects still are red,\nlarge, heavy, and the like—and this in virtue of standing in\nsome relation to the transcendent universals. That relation is usually\ncalled exemplification or instantiation, and it is\ntaken as primitive. But, importantly, it is\nexternal—objects are related to things outside of\nthemselves—whereas the relation between object and property on\nconstituent ontologies is internal. \nSo, while Platonism is primarily a view about the nature of\nproperties, it has implications for the nature of objects. In\nparticular, it entails that they don’t have properties as parts.\nAs Armstrong puts the point: \nIt is interesting to notice that a separate-realm theory of universals\npermits of a blob as opposed to a layer-cake view of particulars. For\non this view, what is it for a thing to have a property? It is not the\nthing’s having some internal feature, but rather its having a\nrelationship, the instantiation relationship, to certain universals or\nForms in another realm. The thing itself could be bloblike. (Armstrong\n1989: 76–77) \nAs it turns out, Platonism is not the only account of properties that\nsits well with an unstructured or bloblike view of objects. \nOn class nominalism, properties are classes of things or classes of\npossible things. The property being green is the class of all\ngreen things, the property being wise is the class of all\nwise things, the relation is the sister of is the class of\nordered pairs the first member of which is the sister of the second\nmember, and so on.\n [32] \nFor an object to have (or exemplify, or instantiate, or whatever) a\nproperty, on this view, is for it to belong to a class of things.\nClass membership, like set membership, is an external relation; so\nclass nominalism sits best with a blob view of objects. van Inwagen\nexplains this connection as follows: \nAccording to Lewis [a class nominalist], a property is a set of\npossible objects. (Something is a property if and only if it is a set\nall of whose members are possible objects.) The property of being a\npig or porcinity, Lewis says, is simply the set of all possible\npigs—a set far larger than the set of actual pigs. Consider an\nactual pig, Freddy. Freddy of course has porcinity. And what is this\nrelation “having” that holds between the pig and the\nproperty? Why, simply set-membership. And the relation that a set of\npossibilia bears to its individual members is certainly not\nconstituency. Freddy is no doubt in some sense a constituent of the\nset of all possible pigs—‘constituent’ is a very\nflexible word, and it is probably flexible enough to permit that\napplication —, but there is no conceivable sense in which the\nset of all possible pigs is a constituent of Freddy.
