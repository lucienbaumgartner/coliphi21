The universe, he proposes, is the product of\nrational, purposive, and beneficent agency. It is the handiwork of a\ndivine Craftsman (“Demiurge,” dêmiourgos,\n28a6) who, imitating an unchanging and eternal model, imposes\nmathematical order on a preexistent chaos to generate the ordered\nuniverse (kosmos). The governing explanatory principle of the\naccount is teleological: the universe as a whole as well as its\nvarious parts are so arranged as to produce a vast array of good\neffects. For Plato this arrangement is not fortuitous, but the outcome\nof the deliberate intent of Intellect (nous),\nanthropomorphically represented by the figure of the Craftsman who\nplans and constructs a world that is as excellent as its nature\npermits it to be.\n\n\nThe beautiful orderliness of the universe is not only the\nmanifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rational souls to\nunderstand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulation restores\nthose souls to their original state of excellence, a state that was\nlost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethical and\nreligious dimension to the discourse.\n\n\nThis picture of a divinely created universe, though controversial from\nthe start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination and\nadmiration of numerous generations of philosophers and theologians\nthrough the\n centuries.[1]\n Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as a\nmonologue—by excluding exchanges between interlocutors the\ndiscourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set of\nquestions to be investigated—the Timaeus was generally\ntaken to be the culmination of its author’s intellectual\nachievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayal\nof the universe. This also seems to have been one of the reasons for\nits early translation into Latin. Calcidius’ Latin translation\nin the fourth century CE made it the only text of Plato available in\nthe Middle Ages in the Latin West until the twelfth century. While it\nstill was an important reference point for Kepler, its influence began\nto wane over time. In the latter part of the nineteenth and earlier\npart of the twentieth century interest in the Timaeus was\nagain stimulated by the refinement of philological methods and exact\nhistorical\n scholarship,[2]\n but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialogue\nwas frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best and\nregressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about the\ndevelopment of Plato’s philosophy, but not much more. Recent\ndecades, however, have witnessed a revival of interest in the\nTimaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,\nand philologists, while not necessarily persuaded by the\ndialogue’s bold claims, have been fascinated by its majestic\naccount and have sympathetically entered into and sought to elucidate\nits conceptual structure.\n\nThe opening conversation (17a1–27d4) introduces the\ncharacters—Socrates, Timaeus, Critias and Hermocrates—and\nsuggests that the latter three would contribute to a reply to\nSocrates’ speech allegedly given on the previous day, which\npresented an ideal political arrangement strongly reminiscent of the\n Republic.[3]\n This reply would start with an account of the creation of the\nuniverse down to the creation of human beings and, in a second step,\nshow an ideal society in motion. Critias is meant to provide the\nsecond step with his account of a war between ancient Athens and\nAtlantis, the beginning of which we find in Plato’s\nCritias, while Timaeus is meant to deal with the first step in\nour dialogue. Timaeus begins the discourse (27d5–92c9) with a\nprologue (27d5–29d6) in which he sets out the metaphysical\nprinciples on which his account is based, introduces the figure of the\nCraftsman and his eternal model, and provides a brief comment on the\nstatus of the account he is about to provide. This prologue is\nfollowed by the discourse proper, which is uninterrupted to the end of\nthe dialogue (29d7–92c9). The discourse unfolds in three main\nstages: the first sets out the achievements of Intellect\n(29d7–47e2), the second gives an account of the effects of\nNecessity (47d3–69a5), and the third shows how Intellect and\nNecessity cooperate in the production of the psychophysical\nconstitution of human beings (69a6–92c9). \nThe first of the main sections of the discourse explains the existence\nof the universe and some of its most general features teleologically.\nThe universe exists and manifests goodness because it is the handiwork\nof a supremely good, ungrudging Craftsman, who brought order to an\ninitially disorderly state of affairs. It is a living thing\n(zô[i]on, also translatable as “animal”),\nbecause it is better for it to possess intelligence than to lack it,\nand the acquisition of intelligence by anything requires the\nacquisition of soul. It is complete, and thus it includes within\nitself all the species of living things as its parts. It is unique,\nbecause its model is unique; the uniqueness of the model follows from\nits completeness. The world’s body is composed of fire (for\nvisibility) and earth (for tangibility), but these so-called elements\nrequire the mediation of air and water in a progression of proportion\nto bind them together into a unified, concordant whole. The shape of\nthe universe’s body—a sphere—and the characteristics\nit possesses or lacks are all explained in terms of their various\npurposes. The composition of the world’s soul out of a\nharmonically proportionate series of portions of a mixture of both\ndivisible and indivisible Sameness, Difference and Being, and the\ndivision of these portions into two intersecting circles (of the Same\nand of the Different) explain the cognitive powers of the soul in\nrelation to the different types of objects of cognition: those that\nare and those that become. When joined with the world’s body,\nthey also explain the cosmological organization of the universe. The\nheavenly bodies are divine and move in their various orbits to serve\nas markers of time: the fixed stars to mark a day/night, the moon to\nmark the (lunar) month and the sun to mark the year. Time itself came\ninto being with these celestial movements as an “image of\n eternity.”[4]\n Individual souls are made up of the residue (and an inferior grade)\nof the soul stuff of the universe, and are eventually embodied in\nphysical bodies. This embodiment throws the previously regular motions\nof the soul into confusion as the soul is subjected to the forceful\ndisturbances of internal bodily processes as well as the impact of\nexternal bodies upon it, particularly in sense experience. These\ndisturbances gravely impair the soul’s cognitive functioning;\nonly with appropriate nurture and education can its original motions\nbe reestablished and proper cognitive functioning be restored. The\nbody and its parts were designed to support that functioning, and\nTimaeus takes the design of the eyes and the mechanics of vision as an\nimportant case in point. \nAs Timaeus prepares for the transition to the second main part of his\ndiscourse, he points out that while a causal story of the sort he has\nbeen telling so far is indeed concerned with what is properly the\ncause (aitia) of the universe’s generation, that story\nis not by itself sufficient and must extend to an account of\n“contributing causes” (sunaitiai or\nsummetraitiai, 46c7, 46e6, 68e4–5) as well. The\ndiscourse must provide an account of the various physical structures\nthat are necessary for and support the achievement of the purposes of\nIntellect. The properties possessed by these various structures are\ndetermined by their constitutions as a matter of\n“Necessity,” and it is not open to the Craftsman to change\nor eliminate the properties of these structures. The properties allow\n(or disallow) certain processes desirable to the Craftsman, and to the\nextent that Intellect achieves its desiderata, it succeeds in\n“persuading” Necessity (48a2–5). It is the role of\nthe second major part of the discourse to set forth these contributing\ncauses. \nThe second main section begins with the introduction of the\nreceptacle, a “third kind” alongside the familiar\nparadigmatic forms and the generated images of the forms\n(49a1–4, 52a8, d2–4). The receptacle has been seen as\nserving either as material substratum or as some form of space or as\ncombining both roles. Timaeus’ account of the receptacle\npresents several interpretive difficulties, some of which will be\ndiscussed below. In the “pre-cosmic” state (the state\n“prior to” the intervention of the Craftsman) the\nreceptacle is subject to erratic and disorderly motions, and moves its\ncontents in turn. Its contents are mere “traces”\n(ichnê, 53b2) of the subsequently articulated four\nso-called elements: fire, air, water and earth. The Craftsman begins\nby constructing these four regular solids as the primary corpuscles of\neach of the four kinds. These solids have faces that are made up\n(ultimately) of two types of right-angled triangles—the\nhalf-equilateral and the isosceles—and it is these triangles\nthat are the ultimate “simples” of the physics of the\ndialogue. Because their triangles are similar (half-equilateral), only\ncorpuscles of fire, air and water may be transformed into one another;\nwhile corpuscles of earth are made up of isosceles triangles and are\nthus excluded from such transformations. Each of the four kinds has\nproperties that are determined by the constitution of their respective\ncorpuscles, and these properties in turn determine how the particles\nact upon and react to one another. These actions and reactions are\nongoing and perpetuate a state of non-uniformity which itself is a\nnecessary condition for motion, i.e., the continuation of the\ninteractions. Although each of the four kinds has a tendency to move\ntoward its own region of space, their being squeezed together in a\nspherical universe without any gaps leads to the inevitable\ntransformations that occur when their various corpuscles cut or crush\none another. Thus it is assured that these migrations are never\ncompleted in the sense that there would be a complete separation of\nthe four elements into separate regions. The account proceeds to\nexplain the various varieties of each of the four kinds, and the\nsensible properties that they and their compounds manifest. An account\nof sensible properties calls for a preliminary account of sensation\n(including pleasure and pain), and it is with that preliminary account\nthat this section of the discourse concludes. \nThe third main section of the discourse—about the cooperation of\nIntellect with Necessity—focuses primarily on the psychophysical\nconstruction of the human being. While the Craftsman has created the\nindividual souls, he delegates the creation of the human bodies to the\nlesser, created gods. As individual immortal (and rational) souls are\nembodied in mortal bodies, the embodiment requires the further\ncreation of the “mortal” parts of the soul—the\nspirited and appetitive parts, familiar from the Republic and\nthe Phaedrus. These parts are assigned their respective\nlocations in the body: the immortal and rational soul in the head, and\nthe two parts of the mortal soul in the trunk: the spirited part in\nthe chest (nearer to the head) and the appetitive part in the belly.\nThe various organs in the trunk—the lungs and heart in the chest\nand the liver in the belly—support the functions of their\nresident soul parts. The account proceeds to describe the formation of\nthe various bodily parts, setting out in each case the purpose of the\npart in question and showing how its construction (out of the\nappropriately selected materials) serves that purpose. The purpose is\nprescribed by Intellect, and the properties of the\nmaterials—selected because their properties render them\ncompliant to Intellect’s purposes—are the consequences\n(and thus contributions) of Necessity. For the most part, Necessity\nserves the purposes of Intellect well, but this is not always the\ncase. A notable example of them coming apart is the covering around\nthe brain. That covering needs to be massive to provide maximal\nprotection, but that very massiveness would impede sensation, and so a\npreferential choice must be made between the conflicting demands. Such\noccasional cases of resistance by Necessity to the\n“persuasion” of Intellect limit the degree of excellence\nthe created world can attain. Timaeus’ discourse moves on with\nan account of the mechanisms of respiration and digestion, and a\nclassification and etiological discussion of various diseases of both\nbody and soul. This is preparatory to an exhortation to properly\nexercise both the soul and the body to recover or maintain physical\nand psychic well being. The well being of the soul in particular is\nemphasized: it is through realigning the motions of our souls with\nthose of the universe at large that we achieve our goal of living\nvirtuously and happily. The discourse concludes with an account of the\ngeneration of women and non-human animals. \nEver since Aristotle rejected the cosmology of the Timaeus on\nthe ground that it nonsensically required not just a beginning of the\nuniverse in time, but a beginning of time itself (Physics\n251b14–26), defenders of the dialogue—perhaps wishing\nto neutralize Aristotle’s critique while conceding its\npoint—have claimed that the creation story is not to be read\nliterally, but\n metaphorically.[5]\n This metaphorical reading of the dialogue became the prevailing\n(though not exclusive) view among Platonists, from the Old Academy of\nPlato’s immediate successors to Plotinus (third cent. CE). The\nquestion of how literally the creation story is to be interpreted\nremains an intriguing one that continues to interest (and divide)\nscholars to this day: if we follow the metaphorical interpretation, we\nwill read the account not as a process by which an intelligent\nCraftsman put the world together at some time in the past, but as a\nstatement of the principles that underlie the universe at all times of\nits existence, whether it exists eternally or not. Key questions\nraised by this issue include the following: (1) Is Intellect\n(personified by the Craftsman) literally an intelligent agent of some\nsort, an entity that is ontologically distinct from both the model and\nits copy, or can the Craftsman be identified with some aspect of\neither the copy or the model—the world soul, for example, or one\nor other of the forms—and thus be reducible to something else?\n(On this question, see more below, under “Teleology.”) (2)\nHow do we understand the relation of the “pre-cosmic”\nstate of the universe to its finished state? The account posits that\npre-cosmic state “before” the creative process by which\nthe ordered universe comes into being. But if there is no time apart\nfrom the measured celestial motions, how is that “before”\nto be understood? (3) If the creation story is read literally, is it\nconsistent with Plato’s views on related subjects set forth in\nother dialogues? These questions are at the center of much current\ndiscussion of the\n dialogue.[6] \nPlato’s literary output is vast, very likely spanning close to\nfifty years, and over the years there have been numerous attempts to\nplace the dialogues into a chronological sequence. Many of these\nefforts are motivated by the hope that success in determining such a\nsequence will provide an objective basis for conjectures about the\ndevelopment of Plato’s philosophical views over the course of\nhis literary lifetime. Such a developmental approach to the dialogues\nhas been called into question in recent years, and is currently out of\nfashion in some circles. Nevertheless, it is difficult to deny many\nlines of continuity, and sometimes discontinuity, in the questions\nthat are explored in the dialogues and in the answers—however\ntentative—suggested by its primary characters. Both these\ncontinuities and discontinuities justify a cautious attempt to\nidentify and to understand what endures and what changes in the course\nof Plato’s writing. \nThe question of the place of the Timaeus relative to the\nother dialogues has given rise to an acrimonious but nevertheless\nfruitful debate, with far-ranging implications for our assessment of\nPlato’s philosophy. In 1953, G. E. L. Owen published a\nprovocative article that challenged the orthodox view of the\nTimaeus as a work written during Plato’s so called\n“late” period, and argued that it should be regarded as a\nmiddle dialogue instead, composed prior to the Theaetetus and\nthe Parmenides. Owen claimed to see in the Timaeus a\nreassertion of several metaphysical views familiar from the\nRepublic but (on the reading proposed by Owen) subsequently\nexposed for refutation in these two dialogues, both of which on the\northodox view precede the Timaeus. The orthodox view was\nbased on long-standing tradition, but had been confirmed by the\nstylometric studies of Plato’s writings undertaken by late\nnineteenth- and early twentieth-century philologists. Owen called into\nquestion the assumptions and the results of these studies. Four years\nlater Owen’s criticism of stylometry, as well as his\ninterpretation of the relevant arguments in the Theaetetus\nand the Parmenides, were in turn vigorously if not\nrancorously disputed by H. F. Cherniss in defense of the traditional\nview (Cherniss 1965, 1977). This debate between these two scholars of\nrenown whose approaches to the study of Plato’s dialogues were\nso markedly different did much to bring a new level of acuity to the\nanalysis of Platonic texts. Over time the orthodox view appears to\nhave held its own. Both a more nuanced examination of the texts and\nmore recent computer-assisted stylometric studies have done much to\nreinforce\n it.[7] \nIn his prefatory remarks Timaeus describes the account he is about to\ngive as a “likely account” (eikôs logos) or\n“likely story” (eikôs\n muthos).[8]\n The description is a play on words: the subject of the account is\nitself an “image” (eikôn) and, Timaeus\navers, “the accounts we give of things [should] have the same\ncharacter as the subjects they set forth” (29b3–5).\nFashioned after an unchanging and eternal model—a possible\nsubject of a definitive and exact account—the universe as a\nthing that becomes is shifting and unstable, and hence any account\ngiven of it will be similarly lacking in complete accuracy and\nconsistency (29c4–7). This may be read as lowering our\nexpectations—the account is no more than likely. At the same\ntime, Timaeus says he will strive to give an account that is “no\nless likely than anyone else’s” (or “any other\n[account]”) (29c7–8) and, while the account cannot be\ngrasped by understanding (nous, 29b6—the faculty for\napprehending unchanging truths), it nevertheless merits our\n“belief” (pistis, 29c3) and fulfills certain\nstandards. As Timaeus’ account proceeds, we are frequently\nreminded of its “likely”\n character,[9]\n and both the negative and positive connotations of that\ncharacterization should be kept in mind. \nThe account, then, is presented as reasonable, thus meriting our\nbelief, but neither definitive nor complete (cf. 68b6–8), and\nthus open to possible revision (cf. 54b1–2, 55d4–6). A\ndefinitive account of these matters eludes humans (29d1) and is\navailable only to a god\n (53d4–7).[10]\n It has sometimes been argued that the qualification of the account as\n“merely likely” supports a metaphorical reading of the\ncosmology. This, however, is a mistake; it is not easy to see how the\ndistinction between an exact and definitive versus a reliable but\nrevisable account maps on to the distinction between a literal versus\na metaphorical account. The contrast should rather be seen as one\nbetween apodeictic certainty (about intelligible matters) and\n plausibility[11]\n (about empirical matters). To the extent that the subject of the\naccount is a thing that becomes rather than a thing that is, as well\nas a thing that is perceptible rather than a thing that is\nintelligible, the account will be no more than likely. To the extent\nthat it is beautiful and ordered, modeled after a perfect reality and\nfashioned by a most excellent maker, the account will be no less than\nlikely. \nThe account Timaeus gives of the generation of the universe is from\nthe outset based on metaphysical and epistemological principles\nfamiliar from the dialogues of Plato’s middle period,\nparticularly the Republic. Introducing the subject of his\ndiscourse, Timaeus posits a distinction between what always is and\nnever becomes and what becomes and never is\n(27d5–28a1). He goes on to connect each with its familiar\nepistemological correlate (28a1–4): the former is grasped by\nunderstanding (noêsis) involving a reasoned account\n(logos), and the latter by opinion (doxa), which\ninvolves unreasoning sense perception (aesthêsis\nalogos). Although Timaeus does not here name the types of entity\nthat satisfy these descriptions, the reader familiar with the\nRepublic will call to mind the distinction between forms and\nsensibles (518c, 534a). The role of what is as the model\nafter which the Craftsman designs and constructs the universe (29a)\nrecalls the role of the forms as models for the philosopher-rulers to\nimitate in exercising their statecraft (Rep.\n500b–501c). It is not until much later in Timaeus’\ndiscourse (51b7–e6) that forms are mentioned for the first time,\nand their existence is argued for on the basis of the distinction\n(itself supported by argument) between understanding and (true)\nopinion. And the identification of what becomes with\nsensibles (in this case the universe as an object of sense) is readily\nmade at 28b7–c2 (see 5. in the argument below). \nTimaeus’ opening question (“What is that which always\nis and never becomes…?”) can be read\nextensionally (“What entity or entities are such that they\nalways are and never become…?”) or\nintensionally (“What is it for some entity always to be\nand never to become…?”). If read in the former\nway, the answer will be “forms” or “a form.”\nIf read in the latter way, the question is answered immediately in the\ntext: always to be is to be intelligible and unchanging. For that\nreason the latter reading should be preferred. \nThe metaphysical being-becoming distinction and its epistemological\ncorrelate are put to work in an argument that establishes the\nframework for the cosmology to follow. The conclusion of that argument\nis that the universe is a work of craft, produced by a supremely good\nCraftsman in imitation of an eternal model. The reasoning may be\nrepresented as follows: \nGiven familiar Platonic doctrines and assumptions, the argument up to\nthe intermediate conclusion that the universe has a cause of its\nbecoming (7) presents no particular difficulties. But 7 by itself\ngives only partial support to\n 8.[13]\n Here it helps to anticipate 9d as a fundamental premise in\nTimaeus’ reasoning; it is not just the generation of any world,\nbut that of a supremely beautiful one that Timaeus’ reasoning\nhere—and in fact throughout the discourse—attempts to\nexplain. That a world as beautiful as ours might be the effect of an\nunintelligent cause is a possibility that does not so much as cross\nPlato’s mind. \nOnce the conclusion that the universe is teleologically structured is\nsettled, the explanatory methodology of the discourse changes\naccordingly. The question that frames the inquiry henceforth is not\nthe question: What best explains this or that observed feature of the\nworld? It is rather the question: Given that the world as a whole is\nthe best possible one within the constraints of becoming and of\nNecessity, what sorts of features should we expect the world to have?\nThis question invites a priori answers, and Timaeus’ arguments\nabout the most general features of the universe as a whole (for\nexample, why it exists, why it is alive and intelligent, why it is\nunique, why it is shaped and composed as it is) are derived wholly a\npriori. Furthermore, the answers to these questions are not open to\nempirical confirmation. But clearly the inquiry is also constrained by\nfeatures of the universe that are actually observed, and this gives\nrise, secondly, to questions about the good purposes that are being\nserved by these features (for example, the motions of the heavenly\nbodies, the psychophysical constitutions of human beings, etc.), and\nhow the features in question accomplish those purposes. For the most\npart there is a happy coincidence between the features that are\nrequired (in answer to the first question), and the features that are\nactually observed (in answer to the second), and it is part of the\ngenius of the discourse that these are so well woven together.\nOccasionally, however, the methodology leads to conclusions apparently\nat odds with observation—for example, the exemption of earth\nfrom inter-elemental transformation (see further under\n“Physics”\n below).[14] \nThe model that serves the Craftsman is regularly named the\n“Living Thing (Itself),” and this is either a form, or an\nappropriately organized constellation of forms. It is the Ideal (or\nbetter: Real) Universe; the object of what Plato had called\n“real astronomy” (as opposed to empirical astronomy) in\nthe Republic (527d–531d, esp. 530a3). The Craftsman\ndoes not—indeed logically cannot—copy by replicating the\nLiving Thing; his challenge rather lies in crafting an image of it\nthat is subject to the constraints of becoming: unlike the model, it\nmust be visible and tangible (28b7), hence three-dimensional\n(solid—stereoeidê, 32b1). This constraint in turn\nrequires the postulation of a three-dimensional field in which the\ncreated universe may subsist, a field that Timaeus initially calls the\n“receptacle (hupodochê) of all becoming”\n(49a5–6) and subsequently calls\n“space”(chôra, 52a8, d3). \nThe necessity of a three-dimensional field in which the visible\nuniverse, as copy of its eternal model, takes shape and subsists\ndetermines the sense in which we should understand the universe to be\nan “imitation” of its model. The imitative activity of the\nCraftsman is unlike that of a builder who replicates a larger- or\nsmaller-scale three-dimensional structure as model, but like that of a\nbuilder who follows a set of instructions or schematics. That set is\nthe intelligible, non-material and non-spatial model that prescribes\nthe features of the structure to be built; it is not a structure\nitself. It is debatable whether Plato’s middle-period\nmetaphysics included the view that forms were, or exhibited, some\ngrander, unalloyed version of some of the properties exhibited by\nsensible objects. Arguably such a view (call it “crude\nparadeigmatism”) was refuted by the “Third Man”\nargument of the Parmenides (132a). As invisible, intangible,\nand non-spatial entities forms are excluded from possessing properties\nthat only visible, tangible and spatial object may possess.\nNevertheless, in so far as they are or exhibit intelligible natures\nforms may, like a set of instructions or schematics, serve as models\nto be “looked at” (28a7, 29a3) by anyone who understands\nthose natures and is in a position to construct a world in accordance\nwith them. (This view of the Craftsman’s imitative activity\nmight by contrast be described as “refined\n paradeigmatism.”[15]) \nTimaeus’ introduction of the receptacle as a “third\nkind” (triton genos, 48e4) alongside forms and their\nimitations is labored indeed. He apologizes for the obscurity of the\nconcept, and attempts to explicate its role by means of a series of\nanalogies: it is variously compared to a lump of gold (50a4–b5),\na mother that together with a father produces offspring (50d2–4,\n51a4–5), a plastic, impressionable stuff (50c2–6,\ne7–51a1), and an ointment that serves as a neutral base for\nvarious fragrances (50e5–8). These images suggest that it is\ndevoid of any characteristics in its own right (except those formal\ncharacteristics necessary to its role, such as malleability). The\nreceptacle is posited as the solution to a problem: none of the\nobservable particulars persists as this or that (for example as fire\nor water) over time. We observe the very thing that is fire at one\ntime becoming air, and subsequently becoming water, etc.,\n“transmitting their becoming to one another in a cycle, so it\nseems” (49c6–7). Thus the thing that appears as fire here\nand now is not fire in its own right: its fieriness is only a\ntemporary characterization of it. What, then, is that thing in its own\nright? In a difficult and controversial passage Timaeus proposes a\n solution:[16]\n In its own right it is (part of) a totally characterless subject that\ntemporarily in its various parts gets characterized in various ways.\nThis is the receptacle—an enduring substratum, neutral in itself\nbut temporarily taking on the various characterizations. The observed\nparticulars just are parts of that receptacle so characterized\n(51b4–6). \nThe above analogies suggest that the receptacle is a material\nsubstratum: as gold qua gold is the material substratum for the\nvarious geometrical configurations it is shaped into, the ointment\nbase for the fragrances, or the impressionable stuff for the various\nimpressions, so the receptacle serves as the “stuff” that\ngets characterized in various ways. But Timaeus does not use any\ndescriptive word that can suitably be translated as\n“matter” or “material”; he does, however, use\nthe word, “space” (chôra). And its function\nof providing a “seat” (hedra, 52b1) reinforces\nthe conception that its role is to provide a spatial location for the\nthings that enter it and disappear from it (49e7–8,\n50c4–5, 52a4–6). \nThere has been considerable discussion about whether the receptacle is\nto be thought of as matter, or as space, and whether it is possible to\nthink of it coherently as having both of those roles. Consider, for\nexample, what it would mean on either view for something to be a\nreceptacle part. (An observable particular is said to be a specific\n“part” [meros, 51b4–6] of the receptacle.)\nIf the receptacle is matter, there would be no difficulty in\nunderstanding how any receptacle part could be in motion: a given bit\nof “stuff” could be variously characterized over time,\neither in the same place or at different places, and still be\nre-identifiable as that same bit of stuff. On the other hand, spatial\nparts are fixed; if an observable particular were to travel from one\nplace to another, that particular would be (and not just\nbe in) a succession of distinct receptacle parts, and thus\nnot strictly the same part\n throughout.[17] \nThis difficulty can be overcome if we think of the receptacle as\nfilled\n space.[18]\n As space, its role is to provide both three-dimensional extension and\na specific location for any observable particular to be\n“in” at a given time: for any particular to be, it must\noccupy some spatial location (52b3–5), though not necessarily\nthe same one throughout. On the other hand, as the filling of that\nspace, it serves as the neutral underlying substratum from which a\nparticular, once characterized in some way, is constituted. An\nobservable particular, then, is a bit of extended, localizable stuff\nthat may be variously characterized at various times and in various\nplaces. It appears that the receptacle is intended to serve both as\nthe matter from which observable particulars are constituted and as\nthe spatial field or medium in which they subsist. It is not clear\nthat these two roles are inconsistent—indeed, they appear to be\nmutually\n necessary.[19] \nThere is ongoing disagreement about the nature of the entities that\nare said to enter into and disappear from the receptacle. They are\nclearly not forms (52a4). Some interpreters have suggested that these\nare character types (or character tokens) derived from the forms, and\nthat these types (or tokens) are properly the form copies\n(mimêmata) that have a prominent place in the argument\nfor the receptacle (49c7–50a4). This interpretation is based on\na reading of that argument that is controversial (see note 16).\nWhatever the merits of this reading, the things the receptacle is said\nto “receive” are “all the bodies\n(sômata)” (50b6). Bodies are three-dimensional\nentities, and this makes it likely that it is the emergence and\ndisappearance of the variously characterized observable particulars as\nsuch, and not their properties (types or tokens), that are mentioned\nin these passages (49e7–8, 50c4–5, 52a4–6). \nThe complete metaphysical scheme of the Timaeus that is summed up at\n50c7–d4 and again at 52a1–b5 is thus as follows: (i) the\neternal and unchanging forms, the “model,” or\n“father”; (ii) the copies of the model or\n“offspring” of the father and the mother (on this account,\nthe observable particulars); and (iii) the receptacle, or\n“mother.” These three are the components of Plato’s\nanalysis; they are not three ontologically distinct ingredients. The\nreceptacle is introduced not as a distinct entity newly superadded to\nparticulars and forms, but as a new and essential component in the\nanalysis of what it is to be a spatio-temporal\n particular.[20]\n What is missing from that analysis, however, is any mention of\ncharacter types or tokens, and while later philosophers might see a\nuse for such concepts in elucidating the metaphysical scheme of the\nTimaeus, it is far from clear that Plato himself makes any\nuse of them there. \nThe introduction of the receptacle is an important innovation in\nPlato’s metaphysics, and clearly a development that takes him\nbeyond the metaphysics of the middle\n dialogues.[21]\n Little attention was given in those dialogues to the question of what\nit is to be a sensible particular (other than being something that\nparticipates in forms), or what is required of particulars to be such\nthat forms may be exemplified in them. In order to be effective in\ntheir role of exemplifying forms, particulars must possess certain\ngeneral characteristics qua particulars: they must be spatially\nextended and spatially situated, and they must be constituted of some\nindeterminate but determinable “stuff” that is subject to\ndetermination by way of participating in forms. Although the\nreceptacle does not appear by name in any other of the later\ndialogues, it clearly has affinities to the concept of the\napeiron (indefinite or indeterminate) of the metaphysical\nscheme in the Philebus. It is impossible, however, to\ndetermine the chronological relation between these two dialogues with\ncertainty (see note 7), and thus impossible to infer which of the two\nschemes Plato might have thought to be the more definitive. \nMany commentators on the Timaeus have pointed out that the\nteleological account set out in the Timaeus is the\nfulfillment of a quest for teleological explanations related in the\nPhaedo (see, e.g., Strange 1999). In that dialogue the\ncharacter Socrates describes his foray into causal questions in the\nrealm of natural science and recounts both his high expectations of\nand disappointment with Anaxagoras’ concept of Intellect\n(nous) as providing the true cause of natural phenomena.\nSocrates expected the use Anaxagoras made of Intellect to provide\nteleological explanations; instead, Anaxagoras employed the concept to\nprovide the same sort of causal explanation—in terms of physical\ninteractions—that Socrates had found confusing. Continuing to\nhope for teleological causal explanations but finding them elusive,\nSocrates settles for a second best account: offering causal\nexplanations in terms of participation in Forms (Phaedo 99c6\nff.). \nIt is not entirely clear by what avenue of reasoning Plato found what\nhis character Socrates failed to find in the Phaedo, but it\nis reasonable to assume that the role of the form of the Good,\nintroduced in the Republic, assisted in the discovery.\nAlthough the character Socrates in that dialogue declines to offer an\naccount of the nature of the Good, it is not unreasonable to connect\nthat form, as some have done, with rational, mathematical\n order.[22]\n Such order as the expression of goodness is arguably for Plato the\nultimate metaphysical datum; forms other than the Good are good in so\nfar as they possess such intelligible order, and they do so perfectly.\nSensibles are good in so far as they participate in these forms,\nthough they fail to do so completely. What is left to be explained,\nthen, is how such order is manifested in the visible universe, however\nimperfectly. The explanation offered in the Timaeus is that\norder is not inherent in the spatio-material universe; it is imposed\nby Intellect, as represented by the Craftsman. \nWhile the figure of the Craftsman seems to be an anthropomorphic\nrepresentation of\n Intellect,[23]\n it remains to ask what the ontological status of Intellect is, in\nrelation to the division between being and becoming—a\ndistinction that appears to be exhaustive. Some interpreters, relying\non Timaeus’ claim (at 30b3) that intellect cannot become present\nto anything apart from soul, have argued that Intellect is (part of)\nthe world’s\n soul.[24]\n This cannot be correct: like the rest of becoming, the world’s\nsoul is a product of the Craftsman, and hence neither it nor anything\nelse on the side of becoming can be identified with Intellect.\nAlternatively, either Intellect is a form, or the distinction between\nbeing and becoming is not exhaustive. Some have argued that Intellect\nis to be identified with the entire realm of\n forms,[25]\n or the form of the\n Good,[26]\n while others, understanding “nous” to name a\nvirtue, have opted for the form of Intelligence (a substance in virtue\nof its status as a\n form).[27]\n More recently, it has been suggested that the figure of the Craftsman\nis a personification of\n craftsmanship.[28]\n None of these accounts seem adequate either: if Intellect were a form\nof any kind, it would be an intelligible object, not a subject that\npossesses cognition and efficient causal\n agency.[29]\n Intellect, then, cannot be placed either on the side of being or on\nthat of becoming, and that dichotomy is thus not\n exhaustive.[30]\n It is reasonable to conclude that Intellect is a sui generis\nsubstance that transcends the metaphysical dichotomy of being and\nbecoming—possibly not unlike the Judaeo-Christian conception of\n God.[31] \nThe teleology of the Timaeus may be usefully compared to that\nof Aristotle’s philosophy of nature. What is immediately\nstriking in that comparison is the absence from Aristotle’s\nnatural philosophy of a purposive, designing causal agent that\ntranscends nature. Aristotelian final causes in the formation of\norganisms and the structures of the natural world are said to be\nimmanent in nature (i.e., the nature or “form” of the\norganism or structure) itself: it is not a divine Craftsman but nature\nitself that is said to act\n purposively.[32]\n Such an immanent teleology will not be an option for Plato.\nAristotle’s teleology is local, not global: while it makes sense\nto ask Aristotle for a teleological explanation of this or that\nfeature of the natural world, it makes little sense to ask him for a\nteleological explanation of the world as a whole. Moreover, for\nAristotle the development of an individual member of a species is\ndetermined by the form it has inherited from its (male) parent: the\ngoal of the developing individual is to fully actualize that form. For\nPlato the primeval chaotic stuff of the universe has no inherent\npreexisting form that governs some course of natural development\ntoward the achievement of some goal, and so the explanatory cause of\nits orderliness must be external to any features that such stuff may\npossess. \nWhile the receptacle has an obvious metaphysical role in the\nTimaeus, its primary role after its introduction is in the\nphysical theory of the dialogue. The argument from 47e3 to 52d4 gives\nTimaeus both the spatial matrix in which to situate, and the material\nsubstratum from which to constitute, the universe that he will fashion\nafter its eternal model. The fashioning, however, is the process of\nbringing order to what was, prior to and apart from the\nCraftsman’s intervention, a thoroughly disorderly state of\naffairs, and so the physical account begins with a description of that\ndisorderly, “god-forsaken” (53b3–4) initial\nstate. \nIn that state, dramatically described at 52d4–53c3, the filled\nspace that is the receptacle undergoes constant, erratic motion: it is\nsubject to forces (dunameis, 52e2) that are dissimilar to and\nout of balance with each other, and thus, as each spastic movement\nproduces its chain of spastic reactions, it is perpetually unstable\n(52e1–5). These motions may accidentally produce manifestations\nthat to a would-be observer look like fire or any of the so-called\nfour elements, or “kinds” (genê). Timaeus\ncalls these manifestations “traces” (53b2) of the four\nkinds, and states that even as inarticulate traces, they tended to\nbehave in the ways in which the subsequently articulated kinds would\ncome to behave by necessity: each trace type would gather to its own\nregion, with the heavier to one region and the lighter to another.\nThese migrations are the effect of the ceaseless agitation of the\nreceptacle, which acts like a “winnowing sieve” (52e6),\nseparating the heavy from the light. The result is a pre-cosmic\ninchoate stratification of these traces, which anticipates the\n(perpetually incomplete, 58a2–c4) stratification of the finished\nuniverse. \nIn accordance with the requirements for the construction of the body\nof the universe previously set out at 31b4–32c4, the Craftsman\nbegins by fashioning each of the four kinds “to be as perfect\nand excellent as possible…” (53b5–6). He selects as\nthe basic corpuscles (sômata, “bodies”)\nfour of the five regular solids: the tetrahedron for fire, the\noctahedron for air, the icosahedron for water, and the cube for earth.\n(The remaining regular solid, the dodecahedron, is “used for the\nuniverse as a whole,” [55c4–6], since it approaches most\nnearly the shape of a sphere.) The faces of the first three of these\nare composed of equilateral triangles, and each face is itself\ncomposed of six elemental (scalene) half equilateral right-angled\ntriangles, whose sides are in a proportion of 1:√3:2. Timaeus\ndoes not say why each face is composed of six such triangles, when in\nfact two, joined at the longer of the two sides that contain the right\nangle, will more simply constitute an equilateral triangle. The faces\nof the cube are squares composed of four elemental isosceles\nright-angled triangles and again, it is not clear why four should be\npreferred to two. Given that every right-angled triangle is infinitely\ndivisible into two triangles of it own type (by dropping a\nperpendicular from the right-angle vertex to the hypotenuse, the\nresulting two smaller right triangles are both similar to the original\ntriangle) the equilateral or square faces of the solids and thus the\nstereometric solids themselves have no minimal size. Possibly, then,\nthe choice of six component triangles for the equilateral and four for\nthe square is intended to prevent the solid particles from becoming\nvanishingly\n small.[33] \nSince each of the first three of the regular solids has equilateral\nfaces, it is possible for any fire, air or water corpuscles to come\napart in their interactions—they cut or crush each\nother—and their faces be reconstituted into corpuscles of one of\nthe two other sorts, depending on the numbers of faces of the basic\ncorpuscles involved. For example, two fire corpuscles could be\ntransformed into a single air corpuscle, or one air corpuscle into two\nfire corpuscles, given that the tetrahedron has four faces and the\noctahedron eight (other examples are given at 56d6–e7). In this\nway Timaeus explains the intertransformation that can occur among\nfire, air and water. On the other hand, while the faces of the cube\nparticles may also come apart, they can only be reconstituted as\ncubes, and so earth undergoes no intertransformation with the other\n three.[34]\n Having established the construction and interactive behavior of the\nbasic particles, Timaeus continues the physical account of the\ndiscourse with a series of applications: differences among varieties\nof each of the primary bodies are explained by differences in the\nsizes of the constituent particles (some varieties consisting of\nparticles of different sizes), and compounds are distinguished by\ntheir combinations of both different sorts and different sizes of\nparticles. These various arrangements explain the perceptible\nproperties possessed by the varieties of primary bodies and their\ncompounds. An object’s particular arrangement of triangles\nproduces a particular kind of “disturbance” or\n“experience” (pathos) in the perceiving subject,\nso that the object is perceived as having this or that perceptible\nproperty. \nIt is a fair question to ask how the physics of the discourse relates\nto its metaphysics—for example, how the perceptible properties\nof observable instances of fire (its brightness, lightness and heat,\nlet us say) relate to the form of Fire, an intelligible reality that\nhas no perceptible properties at all. The form of Fire is the\nnon-spatial, non-material, non-perceptible intelligible, eternal and\nunchanging nature of fire that the Craftsman “imitates,”\nand in so doing produces spatially extended, material, perceptible,\ntransient and variable instances of fire. Although we are not told\nwhat it is about the nature of fire that requires observable instances\nof it to have just these properties, it is presumably that knowledge\nthat guides the Craftsman to select and assign the four regular solids\nas he does. Given that the nature of fire is such that any\n“imitations” of it that appear in the Receptacle must be\nperceptible as bright, light and hot, the type of solid body that best\nsupports these properties—the tetrahedron, it turns\nout—should be assigned to fire. And so with the other three\nkinds (see 55d7–56c7). \nPlato inherited from Socrates the conviction that knowledge of\ngoodness has a salvific effect upon human life. That knowledge\nremained elusive to Socrates. As Plato continues the Socratic quest,\nhe expands the scope of the search beyond ethical matters. In the\nPhaedo, as we saw earlier, the character Socrates expresses\nthe conviction that goodness is the true cause (aitia) of the\nbeneficent arrangement of the natural world, though the nature of\ngoodness continues to elude him as well. The causal supremacy of\ngoodness is recognized in the metaphysical and epistemological roles\nassigned to the Republic’s form of the Good, and it is\nthe understanding of that form that constitutes the culmination of the\neducation of the philosophical statesman, the paragon of the virtuous\nand happy person. What remains to be articulated is a conception of\nhow cosmic goodness is manifested in the universe so that humans will\nrecognize it, understand it, and emulate it in order that their lives\nmay become truly virtuous and\n happy.[35] \nWe saw above that in its dramatic context, the Timaeus is the\nsecond of a series of three or possibly four (see Critias\n108a–b) speeches exchanged by four or possibly five (see\nTimaeus 17a) friends during one of the yearly Athenian\nPanathenaic festivals. It is sandwiched between Socrates’\nRepublic-like speech, which is briefly summarized at the\nbeginning of the Timaeus (17c–19b), and Critias’\nspeech, the unfinished sequel to the\n Timaeus,[36]\n which was intended to recount and celebrate the great victory of\nancient, prehistoric Athens over the vast military might of\n Atlantis.[37]\n The stated thematic purpose of Timaeus’ discourse is to provide\nan account of human nature in the context of the nature of the\nuniverse as a whole. Conjoined with Socrates’ previous account\nof education (à la Republic) this account will provide\nthe basis for Critias’ forthcoming account of human virtue in\naction, as displayed by the deeds of the ancient Athenians\n (27a7–b1).[38]\n If we take this stated purpose seriously, we will expect the entire\ncosmological account to culminate in human psychology and ethics. And\nthat is indeed what we find. \nIn the passage that may fairly be taken as the climax of\nTimaeus’ discourse (90a2–d7), human beings are urged to\ndevote their utmost attention to the cultivation and preservation of\nthe well being of their immortal, rational souls. The well being of a\nrational soul consists in its being well ordered (eu\nkekosmêmenon, 90c5), and so the goal of human life, given\nthe fact that the soul’s revolutions were thrown off course\naround the time of birth (43a6–44b1), is to realign\n(exorthounta, 90d3) those revolutions with those of the\nuniverse at large. Such realignment is achieved by a study of the\nrevolutions and harmonies of the universe and, once achieved, restores\nthe soul to its original condition and thereby brings to fulfillment\n“that most excellent life offered to humankind by the gods, both\nnow and forevermore” (90d5–7).","contact.mail":"donaldzeyl@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2005-10-25","date.changed":"2017-12-18","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-timaeus/","author1":"Donald Zeyl","author2":"Barbara Sattler","author1.info":"https://web.uri.edu/philosophy/meet/donald-zeyl/","entry":"plato-timaeus","body.text":"\n\n\nIn the Timaeus Plato presents an elaborately wrought account\nof the formation of the universe and an explanation of its impressive\norder and beauty. The universe, he proposes, is the product of\nrational, purposive, and beneficent agency. It is the handiwork of a\ndivine Craftsman (“Demiurge,” dêmiourgos,\n28a6) who, imitating an unchanging and eternal model, imposes\nmathematical order on a preexistent chaos to generate the ordered\nuniverse (kosmos). The governing explanatory principle of the\naccount is teleological: the universe as a whole as well as its\nvarious parts are so arranged as to produce a vast array of good\neffects. For Plato this arrangement is not fortuitous, but the outcome\nof the deliberate intent of Intellect (nous),\nanthropomorphically represented by the figure of the Craftsman who\nplans and constructs a world that is as excellent as its nature\npermits it to be.\n\n\nThe beautiful orderliness of the universe is not only the\nmanifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rational souls to\nunderstand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulation restores\nthose souls to their original state of excellence, a state that was\nlost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethical and\nreligious dimension to the discourse.\n\n\nThis picture of a divinely created universe, though controversial from\nthe start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination and\nadmiration of numerous generations of philosophers and theologians\nthrough the\n centuries.[1]\n Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as a\nmonologue—by excluding exchanges between interlocutors the\ndiscourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set of\nquestions to be investigated—the Timaeus was generally\ntaken to be the culmination of its author’s intellectual\nachievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayal\nof the universe. This also seems to have been one of the reasons for\nits early translation into Latin. Calcidius’ Latin translation\nin the fourth century CE made it the only text of Plato available in\nthe Middle Ages in the Latin West until the twelfth century. While it\nstill was an important reference point for Kepler, its influence began\nto wane over time. In the latter part of the nineteenth and earlier\npart of the twentieth century interest in the Timaeus was\nagain stimulated by the refinement of philological methods and exact\nhistorical\n scholarship,[2]\n but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialogue\nwas frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best and\nregressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about the\ndevelopment of Plato’s philosophy, but not much more. Recent\ndecades, however, have witnessed a revival of interest in the\nTimaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,\nand philologists, while not necessarily persuaded by the\ndialogue’s bold claims, have been fascinated by its majestic\naccount and have sympathetically entered into and sought to elucidate\nits conceptual structure.\n\nThe opening conversation (17a1–27d4) introduces the\ncharacters—Socrates, Timaeus, Critias and Hermocrates—and\nsuggests that the latter three would contribute to a reply to\nSocrates’ speech allegedly given on the previous day, which\npresented an ideal political arrangement strongly reminiscent of the\n Republic.[3]\n This reply would start with an account of the creation of the\nuniverse down to the creation of human beings and, in a second step,\nshow an ideal society in motion. Critias is meant to provide the\nsecond step with his account of a war between ancient Athens and\nAtlantis, the beginning of which we find in Plato’s\nCritias, while Timaeus is meant to deal with the first step in\nour dialogue. Timaeus begins the discourse (27d5–92c9) with a\nprologue (27d5–29d6) in which he sets out the metaphysical\nprinciples on which his account is based, introduces the figure of the\nCraftsman and his eternal model, and provides a brief comment on the\nstatus of the account he is about to provide. This prologue is\nfollowed by the discourse proper, which is uninterrupted to the end of\nthe dialogue (29d7–92c9). The discourse unfolds in three main\nstages: the first sets out the achievements of Intellect\n(29d7–47e2), the second gives an account of the effects of\nNecessity (47d3–69a5), and the third shows how Intellect and\nNecessity cooperate in the production of the psychophysical\nconstitution of human beings (69a6–92c9). \nThe first of the main sections of the discourse explains the existence\nof the universe and some of its most general features teleologically.\nThe universe exists and manifests goodness because it is the handiwork\nof a supremely good, ungrudging Craftsman, who brought order to an\ninitially disorderly state of affairs. It is a living thing\n(zô[i]on, also translatable as “animal”),\nbecause it is better for it to possess intelligence than to lack it,\nand the acquisition of intelligence by anything requires the\nacquisition of soul. It is complete, and thus it includes within\nitself all the species of living things as its parts. It is unique,\nbecause its model is unique; the uniqueness of the model follows from\nits completeness. The world’s body is composed of fire (for\nvisibility) and earth (for tangibility), but these so-called elements\nrequire the mediation of air and water in a progression of proportion\nto bind them together into a unified, concordant whole. The shape of\nthe universe’s body—a sphere—and the characteristics\nit possesses or lacks are all explained in terms of their various\npurposes. The composition of the world’s soul out of a\nharmonically proportionate series of portions of a mixture of both\ndivisible and indivisible Sameness, Difference and Being, and the\ndivision of these portions into two intersecting circles (of the Same\nand of the Different) explain the cognitive powers of the soul in\nrelation to the different types of objects of cognition: those that\nare and those that become. When joined with the world’s body,\nthey also explain the cosmological organization of the universe. The\nheavenly bodies are divine and move in their various orbits to serve\nas markers of time: the fixed stars to mark a day/night, the moon to\nmark the (lunar) month and the sun to mark the year. Time itself came\ninto being with these celestial movements as an “image of\n eternity.”[4]\n Individual souls are made up of the residue (and an inferior grade)\nof the soul stuff of the universe, and are eventually embodied in\nphysical bodies. This embodiment throws the previously regular motions\nof the soul into confusion as the soul is subjected to the forceful\ndisturbances of internal bodily processes as well as the impact of\nexternal bodies upon it, particularly in sense experience. These\ndisturbances gravely impair the soul’s cognitive functioning;\nonly with appropriate nurture and education can its original motions\nbe reestablished and proper cognitive functioning be restored. The\nbody and its parts were designed to support that functioning, and\nTimaeus takes the design of the eyes and the mechanics of vision as an\nimportant case in point. \nAs Timaeus prepares for the transition to the second main part of his\ndiscourse, he points out that while a causal story of the sort he has\nbeen telling so far is indeed concerned with what is properly the\ncause (aitia) of the universe’s generation, that story\nis not by itself sufficient and must extend to an account of\n“contributing causes” (sunaitiai or\nsummetraitiai, 46c7, 46e6, 68e4–5) as well. The\ndiscourse must provide an account of the various physical structures\nthat are necessary for and support the achievement of the purposes of\nIntellect. The properties possessed by these various structures are\ndetermined by their constitutions as a matter of\n“Necessity,” and it is not open to the Craftsman to change\nor eliminate the properties of these structures. The properties allow\n(or disallow) certain processes desirable to the Craftsman, and to the\nextent that Intellect achieves its desiderata, it succeeds in\n“persuading” Necessity (48a2–5). It is the role of\nthe second major part of the discourse to set forth these contributing\ncauses. \nThe second main section begins with the introduction of the\nreceptacle, a “third kind” alongside the familiar\nparadigmatic forms and the generated images of the forms\n(49a1–4, 52a8, d2–4). The receptacle has been seen as\nserving either as material substratum or as some form of space or as\ncombining both roles. Timaeus’ account of the receptacle\npresents several interpretive difficulties, some of which will be\ndiscussed below. In the “pre-cosmic” state (the state\n“prior to” the intervention of the Craftsman) the\nreceptacle is subject to erratic and disorderly motions, and moves its\ncontents in turn. Its contents are mere “traces”\n(ichnê, 53b2) of the subsequently articulated four\nso-called elements: fire, air, water and earth. The Craftsman begins\nby constructing these four regular solids as the primary corpuscles of\neach of the four kinds. These solids have faces that are made up\n(ultimately) of two types of right-angled triangles—the\nhalf-equilateral and the isosceles—and it is these triangles\nthat are the ultimate “simples” of the physics of the\ndialogue. Because their triangles are similar (half-equilateral), only\ncorpuscles of fire, air and water may be transformed into one another;\nwhile corpuscles of earth are made up of isosceles triangles and are\nthus excluded from such transformations. Each of the four kinds has\nproperties that are determined by the constitution of their respective\ncorpuscles, and these properties in turn determine how the particles\nact upon and react to one another. These actions and reactions are\nongoing and perpetuate a state of non-uniformity which itself is a\nnecessary condition for motion, i.e., the continuation of the\ninteractions. Although each of the four kinds has a tendency to move\ntoward its own region of space, their being squeezed together in a\nspherical universe without any gaps leads to the inevitable\ntransformations that occur when their various corpuscles cut or crush\none another. Thus it is assured that these migrations are never\ncompleted in the sense that there would be a complete separation of\nthe four elements into separate regions. The account proceeds to\nexplain the various varieties of each of the four kinds, and the\nsensible properties that they and their compounds manifest. An account\nof sensible properties calls for a preliminary account of sensation\n(including pleasure and pain), and it is with that preliminary account\nthat this section of the discourse concludes. \nThe third main section of the discourse—about the cooperation of\nIntellect with Necessity—focuses primarily on the psychophysical\nconstruction of the human being. While the Craftsman has created the\nindividual souls, he delegates the creation of the human bodies to the\nlesser, created gods. As individual immortal (and rational) souls are\nembodied in mortal bodies, the embodiment requires the further\ncreation of the “mortal” parts of the soul—the\nspirited and appetitive parts, familiar from the Republic and\nthe Phaedrus. These parts are assigned their respective\nlocations in the body: the immortal and rational soul in the head, and\nthe two parts of the mortal soul in the trunk: the spirited part in\nthe chest (nearer to the head) and the appetitive part in the belly.\nThe various organs in the trunk—the lungs and heart in the chest\nand the liver in the belly—support the functions of their\nresident soul parts. The account proceeds to describe the formation of\nthe various bodily parts, setting out in each case the purpose of the\npart in question and showing how its construction (out of the\nappropriately selected materials) serves that purpose. The purpose is\nprescribed by Intellect, and the properties of the\nmaterials—selected because their properties render them\ncompliant to Intellect’s purposes—are the consequences\n(and thus contributions) of Necessity. For the most part, Necessity\nserves the purposes of Intellect well, but this is not always the\ncase. A notable example of them coming apart is the covering around\nthe brain. That covering needs to be massive to provide maximal\nprotection, but that very massiveness would impede sensation, and so a\npreferential choice must be made between the conflicting demands. Such\noccasional cases of resistance by Necessity to the\n“persuasion” of Intellect limit the degree of excellence\nthe created world can attain. Timaeus’ discourse moves on with\nan account of the mechanisms of respiration and digestion, and a\nclassification and etiological discussion of various diseases of both\nbody and soul. This is preparatory to an exhortation to properly\nexercise both the soul and the body to recover or maintain physical\nand psychic well being. The well being of the soul in particular is\nemphasized: it is through realigning the motions of our souls with\nthose of the universe at large that we achieve our goal of living\nvirtuously and happily. The discourse concludes with an account of the\ngeneration of women and non-human animals. \nEver since Aristotle rejected the cosmology of the Timaeus on\nthe ground that it nonsensically required not just a beginning of the\nuniverse in time, but a beginning of time itself (Physics\n251b14–26), defenders of the dialogue—perhaps wishing\nto neutralize Aristotle’s critique while conceding its\npoint—have claimed that the creation story is not to be read\nliterally, but\n metaphorically.[5]\n This metaphorical reading of the dialogue became the prevailing\n(though not exclusive) view among Platonists, from the Old Academy of\nPlato’s immediate successors to Plotinus (third cent. CE). The\nquestion of how literally the creation story is to be interpreted\nremains an intriguing one that continues to interest (and divide)\nscholars to this day: if we follow the metaphorical interpretation, we\nwill read the account not as a process by which an intelligent\nCraftsman put the world together at some time in the past, but as a\nstatement of the principles that underlie the universe at all times of\nits existence, whether it exists eternally or not. Key questions\nraised by this issue include the following: (1) Is Intellect\n(personified by the Craftsman) literally an intelligent agent of some\nsort, an entity that is ontologically distinct from both the model and\nits copy, or can the Craftsman be identified with some aspect of\neither the copy or the model—the world soul, for example, or one\nor other of the forms—and thus be reducible to something else?\n(On this question, see more below, under “Teleology.”) (2)\nHow do we understand the relation of the “pre-cosmic”\nstate of the universe to its finished state? The account posits that\npre-cosmic state “before” the creative process by which\nthe ordered universe comes into being. But if there is no time apart\nfrom the measured celestial motions, how is that “before”\nto be understood? (3) If the creation story is read literally, is it\nconsistent with Plato’s views on related subjects set forth in\nother dialogues? These questions are at the center of much current\ndiscussion of the\n dialogue.[6] \nPlato’s literary output is vast, very likely spanning close to\nfifty years, and over the years there have been numerous attempts to\nplace the dialogues into a chronological sequence. Many of these\nefforts are motivated by the hope that success in determining such a\nsequence will provide an objective basis for conjectures about the\ndevelopment of Plato’s philosophical views over the course of\nhis literary lifetime. Such a developmental approach to the dialogues\nhas been called into question in recent years, and is currently out of\nfashion in some circles. Nevertheless, it is difficult to deny many\nlines of continuity, and sometimes discontinuity, in the questions\nthat are explored in the dialogues and in the answers—however\ntentative—suggested by its primary characters. Both these\ncontinuities and discontinuities justify a cautious attempt to\nidentify and to understand what endures and what changes in the course\nof Plato’s writing. \nThe question of the place of the Timaeus relative to the\nother dialogues has given rise to an acrimonious but nevertheless\nfruitful debate, with far-ranging implications for our assessment of\nPlato’s philosophy. In 1953, G. E. L. Owen published a\nprovocative article that challenged the orthodox view of the\nTimaeus as a work written during Plato’s so called\n“late” period, and argued that it should be regarded as a\nmiddle dialogue instead, composed prior to the Theaetetus and\nthe Parmenides. Owen claimed to see in the Timaeus a\nreassertion of several metaphysical views familiar from the\nRepublic but (on the reading proposed by Owen) subsequently\nexposed for refutation in these two dialogues, both of which on the\northodox view precede the Timaeus. The orthodox view was\nbased on long-standing tradition, but had been confirmed by the\nstylometric studies of Plato’s writings undertaken by late\nnineteenth- and early twentieth-century philologists. Owen called into\nquestion the assumptions and the results of these studies. Four years\nlater Owen’s criticism of stylometry, as well as his\ninterpretation of the relevant arguments in the Theaetetus\nand the Parmenides, were in turn vigorously if not\nrancorously disputed by H. F. Cherniss in defense of the traditional\nview (Cherniss 1965, 1977). This debate between these two scholars of\nrenown whose approaches to the study of Plato’s dialogues were\nso markedly different did much to bring a new level of acuity to the\nanalysis of Platonic texts. Over time the orthodox view appears to\nhave held its own. Both a more nuanced examination of the texts and\nmore recent computer-assisted stylometric studies have done much to\nreinforce\n it.[7] \nIn his prefatory remarks Timaeus describes the account he is about to\ngive as a “likely account” (eikôs logos) or\n“likely story” (eikôs\n muthos).[8]\n The description is a play on words: the subject of the account is\nitself an “image” (eikôn) and, Timaeus\navers, “the accounts we give of things [should] have the same\ncharacter as the subjects they set forth” (29b3–5).\nFashioned after an unchanging and eternal model—a possible\nsubject of a definitive and exact account—the universe as a\nthing that becomes is shifting and unstable, and hence any account\ngiven of it will be similarly lacking in complete accuracy and\nconsistency (29c4–7). This may be read as lowering our\nexpectations—the account is no more than likely. At the same\ntime, Timaeus says he will strive to give an account that is “no\nless likely than anyone else’s” (or “any other\n[account]”) (29c7–8) and, while the account cannot be\ngrasped by understanding (nous, 29b6—the faculty for\napprehending unchanging truths), it nevertheless merits our\n“belief” (pistis, 29c3) and fulfills certain\nstandards. As Timaeus’ account proceeds, we are frequently\nreminded of its “likely”\n character,[9]\n and both the negative and positive connotations of that\ncharacterization should be kept in mind. \nThe account, then, is presented as reasonable, thus meriting our\nbelief, but neither definitive nor complete (cf. 68b6–8), and\nthus open to possible revision (cf. 54b1–2, 55d4–6). A\ndefinitive account of these matters eludes humans (29d1) and is\navailable only to a god\n (53d4–7).[10]\n It has sometimes been argued that the qualification of the account as\n“merely likely” supports a metaphorical reading of the\ncosmology. This, however, is a mistake; it is not easy to see how the\ndistinction between an exact and definitive versus a reliable but\nrevisable account maps on to the distinction between a literal versus\na metaphorical account. The contrast should rather be seen as one\nbetween apodeictic certainty (about intelligible matters) and\n plausibility[11]\n (about empirical matters). To the extent that the subject of the\naccount is a thing that becomes rather than a thing that is, as well\nas a thing that is perceptible rather than a thing that is\nintelligible, the account will be no more than likely. To the extent\nthat it is beautiful and ordered, modeled after a perfect reality and\nfashioned by a most excellent maker, the account will be no less than\nlikely. \nThe account Timaeus gives of the generation of the universe is from\nthe outset based on metaphysical and epistemological principles\nfamiliar from the dialogues of Plato’s middle period,\nparticularly the Republic. Introducing the subject of his\ndiscourse, Timaeus posits a distinction between what always is and\nnever becomes and what becomes and never is\n(27d5–28a1). He goes on to connect each with its familiar\nepistemological correlate (28a1–4): the former is grasped by\nunderstanding (noêsis) involving a reasoned account\n(logos), and the latter by opinion (doxa), which\ninvolves unreasoning sense perception (aesthêsis\nalogos). Although Timaeus does not here name the types of entity\nthat satisfy these descriptions, the reader familiar with the\nRepublic will call to mind the distinction between forms and\nsensibles (518c, 534a). The role of what is as the model\nafter which the Craftsman designs and constructs the universe (29a)\nrecalls the role of the forms as models for the philosopher-rulers to\nimitate in exercising their statecraft (Rep.\n500b–501c). It is not until much later in Timaeus’\ndiscourse (51b7–e6) that forms are mentioned for the first time,\nand their existence is argued for on the basis of the distinction\n(itself supported by argument) between understanding and (true)\nopinion. And the identification of what becomes with\nsensibles (in this case the universe as an object of sense) is readily\nmade at 28b7–c2 (see 5. in the argument below). \nTimaeus’ opening question (“What is that which always\nis and never becomes…?”) can be read\nextensionally (“What entity or entities are such that they\nalways are and never become…?”) or\nintensionally (“What is it for some entity always to be\nand never to become…?”). If read in the former\nway, the answer will be “forms” or “a form.”\nIf read in the latter way, the question is answered immediately in the\ntext: always to be is to be intelligible and unchanging. For that\nreason the latter reading should be preferred. \nThe metaphysical being-becoming distinction and its epistemological\ncorrelate are put to work in an argument that establishes the\nframework for the cosmology to follow. The conclusion of that argument\nis that the universe is a work of craft, produced by a supremely good\nCraftsman in imitation of an eternal model. The reasoning may be\nrepresented as follows: \nGiven familiar Platonic doctrines and assumptions, the argument up to\nthe intermediate conclusion that the universe has a cause of its\nbecoming (7) presents no particular difficulties. But 7 by itself\ngives only partial support to\n 8.[13]\n Here it helps to anticipate 9d as a fundamental premise in\nTimaeus’ reasoning; it is not just the generation of any world,\nbut that of a supremely beautiful one that Timaeus’ reasoning\nhere—and in fact throughout the discourse—attempts to\nexplain. That a world as beautiful as ours might be the effect of an\nunintelligent cause is a possibility that does not so much as cross\nPlato’s mind. \nOnce the conclusion that the universe is teleologically structured is\nsettled, the explanatory methodology of the discourse changes\naccordingly. The question that frames the inquiry henceforth is not\nthe question: What best explains this or that observed feature of the\nworld? It is rather the question: Given that the world as a whole is\nthe best possible one within the constraints of becoming and of\nNecessity, what sorts of features should we expect the world to have?\nThis question invites a priori answers, and Timaeus’ arguments\nabout the most general features of the universe as a whole (for\nexample, why it exists, why it is alive and intelligent, why it is\nunique, why it is shaped and composed as it is) are derived wholly a\npriori. Furthermore, the answers to these questions are not open to\nempirical confirmation. But clearly the inquiry is also constrained by\nfeatures of the universe that are actually observed, and this gives\nrise, secondly, to questions about the good purposes that are being\nserved by these features (for example, the motions of the heavenly\nbodies, the psychophysical constitutions of human beings, etc.), and\nhow the features in question accomplish those purposes. For the most\npart there is a happy coincidence between the features that are\nrequired (in answer to the first question), and the features that are\nactually observed (in answer to the second), and it is part of the\ngenius of the discourse that these are so well woven together.\nOccasionally, however, the methodology leads to conclusions apparently\nat odds with observation—for example, the exemption of earth\nfrom inter-elemental transformation (see further under\n“Physics”\n below).[14] \nThe model that serves the Craftsman is regularly named the\n“Living Thing (Itself),” and this is either a form, or an\nappropriately organized constellation of forms. It is the Ideal (or\nbetter: Real) Universe; the object of what Plato had called\n“real astronomy” (as opposed to empirical astronomy) in\nthe Republic (527d–531d, esp. 530a3). The Craftsman\ndoes not—indeed logically cannot—copy by replicating the\nLiving Thing; his challenge rather lies in crafting an image of it\nthat is subject to the constraints of becoming: unlike the model, it\nmust be visible and tangible (28b7), hence three-dimensional\n(solid—stereoeidê, 32b1). This constraint in turn\nrequires the postulation of a three-dimensional field in which the\ncreated universe may subsist, a field that Timaeus initially calls the\n“receptacle (hupodochê) of all becoming”\n(49a5–6) and subsequently calls\n“space”(chôra, 52a8, d3). \nThe necessity of a three-dimensional field in which the visible\nuniverse, as copy of its eternal model, takes shape and subsists\ndetermines the sense in which we should understand the universe to be\nan “imitation” of its model. The imitative activity of the\nCraftsman is unlike that of a builder who replicates a larger- or\nsmaller-scale three-dimensional structure as model, but like that of a\nbuilder who follows a set of instructions or schematics. That set is\nthe intelligible, non-material and non-spatial model that prescribes\nthe features of the structure to be built; it is not a structure\nitself. It is debatable whether Plato’s middle-period\nmetaphysics included the view that forms were, or exhibited, some\ngrander, unalloyed version of some of the properties exhibited by\nsensible objects. Arguably such a view (call it “crude\nparadeigmatism”) was refuted by the “Third Man”\nargument of the Parmenides (132a). As invisible, intangible,\nand non-spatial entities forms are excluded from possessing properties\nthat only visible, tangible and spatial object may possess.\nNevertheless, in so far as they are or exhibit intelligible natures\nforms may, like a set of instructions or schematics, serve as models\nto be “looked at” (28a7, 29a3) by anyone who understands\nthose natures and is in a position to construct a world in accordance\nwith them. (This view of the Craftsman’s imitative activity\nmight by contrast be described as “refined\n paradeigmatism.”[15]) \nTimaeus’ introduction of the receptacle as a “third\nkind” (triton genos, 48e4) alongside forms and their\nimitations is labored indeed. He apologizes for the obscurity of the\nconcept, and attempts to explicate its role by means of a series of\nanalogies: it is variously compared to a lump of gold (50a4–b5),\na mother that together with a father produces offspring (50d2–4,\n51a4–5), a plastic, impressionable stuff (50c2–6,\ne7–51a1), and an ointment that serves as a neutral base for\nvarious fragrances (50e5–8). These images suggest that it is\ndevoid of any characteristics in its own right (except those formal\ncharacteristics necessary to its role, such as malleability). The\nreceptacle is posited as the solution to a problem: none of the\nobservable particulars persists as this or that (for example as fire\nor water) over time. We observe the very thing that is fire at one\ntime becoming air, and subsequently becoming water, etc.,\n“transmitting their becoming to one another in a cycle, so it\nseems” (49c6–7). Thus the thing that appears as fire here\nand now is not fire in its own right: its fieriness is only a\ntemporary characterization of it. What, then, is that thing in its own\nright? In a difficult and controversial passage Timaeus proposes a\n solution:[16]\n In its own right it is (part of) a totally characterless subject that\ntemporarily in its various parts gets characterized in various ways.\nThis is the receptacle—an enduring substratum, neutral in itself\nbut temporarily taking on the various characterizations. The observed\nparticulars just are parts of that receptacle so characterized\n(51b4–6). \nThe above analogies suggest that the receptacle is a material\nsubstratum: as gold qua gold is the material substratum for the\nvarious geometrical configurations it is shaped into, the ointment\nbase for the fragrances, or the impressionable stuff for the various\nimpressions, so the receptacle serves as the “stuff” that\ngets characterized in various ways. But Timaeus does not use any\ndescriptive word that can suitably be translated as\n“matter” or “material”; he does, however, use\nthe word, “space” (chôra). And its function\nof providing a “seat” (hedra, 52b1) reinforces\nthe conception that its role is to provide a spatial location for the\nthings that enter it and disappear from it (49e7–8,\n50c4–5, 52a4–6). \nThere has been considerable discussion about whether the receptacle is\nto be thought of as matter, or as space, and whether it is possible to\nthink of it coherently as having both of those roles. Consider, for\nexample, what it would mean on either view for something to be a\nreceptacle part. (An observable particular is said to be a specific\n“part” [meros, 51b4–6] of the receptacle.)\nIf the receptacle is matter, there would be no difficulty in\nunderstanding how any receptacle part could be in motion: a given bit\nof “stuff” could be variously characterized over time,\neither in the same place or at different places, and still be\nre-identifiable as that same bit of stuff. On the other hand, spatial\nparts are fixed; if an observable particular were to travel from one\nplace to another, that particular would be (and not just\nbe in) a succession of distinct receptacle parts, and thus\nnot strictly the same part\n throughout.[17] \nThis difficulty can be overcome if we think of the receptacle as\nfilled\n space.[18]\n As space, its role is to provide both three-dimensional extension and\na specific location for any observable particular to be\n“in” at a given time: for any particular to be, it must\noccupy some spatial location (52b3–5), though not necessarily\nthe same one throughout. On the other hand, as the filling of that\nspace, it serves as the neutral underlying substratum from which a\nparticular, once characterized in some way, is constituted. An\nobservable particular, then, is a bit of extended, localizable stuff\nthat may be variously characterized at various times and in various\nplaces. It appears that the receptacle is intended to serve both as\nthe matter from which observable particulars are constituted and as\nthe spatial field or medium in which they subsist. It is not clear\nthat these two roles are inconsistent—indeed, they appear to be\nmutually\n necessary.[19] \nThere is ongoing disagreement about the nature of the entities that\nare said to enter into and disappear from the receptacle. They are\nclearly not forms (52a4). Some interpreters have suggested that these\nare character types (or character tokens) derived from the forms, and\nthat these types (or tokens) are properly the form copies\n(mimêmata) that have a prominent place in the argument\nfor the receptacle (49c7–50a4). This interpretation is based on\na reading of that argument that is controversial (see note 16).\nWhatever the merits of this reading, the things the receptacle is said\nto “receive” are “all the bodies\n(sômata)” (50b6). Bodies are three-dimensional\nentities, and this makes it likely that it is the emergence and\ndisappearance of the variously characterized observable particulars as\nsuch, and not their properties (types or tokens), that are mentioned\nin these passages (49e7–8, 50c4–5, 52a4–6). \nThe complete metaphysical scheme of the Timaeus that is summed up at\n50c7–d4 and again at 52a1–b5 is thus as follows: (i) the\neternal and unchanging forms, the “model,” or\n“father”; (ii) the copies of the model or\n“offspring” of the father and the mother (on this account,\nthe observable particulars); and (iii) the receptacle, or\n“mother.” These three are the components of Plato’s\nanalysis; they are not three ontologically distinct ingredients. The\nreceptacle is introduced not as a distinct entity newly superadded to\nparticulars and forms, but as a new and essential component in the\nanalysis of what it is to be a spatio-temporal\n particular.[20]\n What is missing from that analysis, however, is any mention of\ncharacter types or tokens, and while later philosophers might see a\nuse for such concepts in elucidating the metaphysical scheme of the\nTimaeus, it is far from clear that Plato himself makes any\nuse of them there. \nThe introduction of the receptacle is an important innovation in\nPlato’s metaphysics, and clearly a development that takes him\nbeyond the metaphysics of the middle\n dialogues.[21]\n Little attention was given in those dialogues to the question of what\nit is to be a sensible particular (other than being something that\nparticipates in forms), or what is required of particulars to be such\nthat forms may be exemplified in them. In order to be effective in\ntheir role of exemplifying forms, particulars must possess certain\ngeneral characteristics qua particulars: they must be spatially\nextended and spatially situated, and they must be constituted of some\nindeterminate but determinable “stuff” that is subject to\ndetermination by way of participating in forms. Although the\nreceptacle does not appear by name in any other of the later\ndialogues, it clearly has affinities to the concept of the\napeiron (indefinite or indeterminate) of the metaphysical\nscheme in the Philebus. It is impossible, however, to\ndetermine the chronological relation between these two dialogues with\ncertainty (see note 7), and thus impossible to infer which of the two\nschemes Plato might have thought to be the more definitive. \nMany commentators on the Timaeus have pointed out that the\nteleological account set out in the Timaeus is the\nfulfillment of a quest for teleological explanations related in the\nPhaedo (see, e.g., Strange 1999). In that dialogue the\ncharacter Socrates describes his foray into causal questions in the\nrealm of natural science and recounts both his high expectations of\nand disappointment with Anaxagoras’ concept of Intellect\n(nous) as providing the true cause of natural phenomena.\nSocrates expected the use Anaxagoras made of Intellect to provide\nteleological explanations; instead, Anaxagoras employed the concept to\nprovide the same sort of causal explanation—in terms of physical\ninteractions—that Socrates had found confusing. Continuing to\nhope for teleological causal explanations but finding them elusive,\nSocrates settles for a second best account: offering causal\nexplanations in terms of participation in Forms (Phaedo 99c6\nff.). \nIt is not entirely clear by what avenue of reasoning Plato found what\nhis character Socrates failed to find in the Phaedo, but it\nis reasonable to assume that the role of the form of the Good,\nintroduced in the Republic, assisted in the discovery.\nAlthough the character Socrates in that dialogue declines to offer an\naccount of the nature of the Good, it is not unreasonable to connect\nthat form, as some have done, with rational, mathematical\n order.[22]\n Such order as the expression of goodness is arguably for Plato the\nultimate metaphysical datum; forms other than the Good are good in so\nfar as they possess such intelligible order, and they do so perfectly.\nSensibles are good in so far as they participate in these forms,\nthough they fail to do so completely. What is left to be explained,\nthen, is how such order is manifested in the visible universe, however\nimperfectly. The explanation offered in the Timaeus is that\norder is not inherent in the spatio-material universe; it is imposed\nby Intellect, as represented by the Craftsman. \nWhile the figure of the Craftsman seems to be an anthropomorphic\nrepresentation of\n Intellect,[23]\n it remains to ask what the ontological status of Intellect is, in\nrelation to the division between being and becoming—a\ndistinction that appears to be exhaustive. Some interpreters, relying\non Timaeus’ claim (at 30b3) that intellect cannot become present\nto anything apart from soul, have argued that Intellect is (part of)\nthe world’s\n soul.[24]\n This cannot be correct: like the rest of becoming, the world’s\nsoul is a product of the Craftsman, and hence neither it nor anything\nelse on the side of becoming can be identified with Intellect.\nAlternatively, either Intellect is a form, or the distinction between\nbeing and becoming is not exhaustive. Some have argued that Intellect\nis to be identified with the entire realm of\n forms,[25]\n or the form of the\n Good,[26]\n while others, understanding “nous” to name a\nvirtue, have opted for the form of Intelligence (a substance in virtue\nof its status as a\n form).[27]\n More recently, it has been suggested that the figure of the Craftsman\nis a personification of\n craftsmanship.[28]\n None of these accounts seem adequate either: if Intellect were a form\nof any kind, it would be an intelligible object, not a subject that\npossesses cognition and efficient causal\n agency.[29]\n Intellect, then, cannot be placed either on the side of being or on\nthat of becoming, and that dichotomy is thus not\n exhaustive.[30]\n It is reasonable to conclude that Intellect is a sui generis\nsubstance that transcends the metaphysical dichotomy of being and\nbecoming—possibly not unlike the Judaeo-Christian conception of\n God.[31] \nThe teleology of the Timaeus may be usefully compared to that\nof Aristotle’s philosophy of nature. What is immediately\nstriking in that comparison is the absence from Aristotle’s\nnatural philosophy of a purposive, designing causal agent that\ntranscends nature. Aristotelian final causes in the formation of\norganisms and the structures of the natural world are said to be\nimmanent in nature (i.e., the nature or “form” of the\norganism or structure) itself: it is not a divine Craftsman but nature\nitself that is said to act\n purposively.[32]\n Such an immanent teleology will not be an option for Plato.\nAristotle’s teleology is local, not global: while it makes sense\nto ask Aristotle for a teleological explanation of this or that\nfeature of the natural world, it makes little sense to ask him for a\nteleological explanation of the world as a whole. Moreover, for\nAristotle the development of an individual member of a species is\ndetermined by the form it has inherited from its (male) parent: the\ngoal of the developing individual is to fully actualize that form. For\nPlato the primeval chaotic stuff of the universe has no inherent\npreexisting form that governs some course of natural development\ntoward the achievement of some goal, and so the explanatory cause of\nits orderliness must be external to any features that such stuff may\npossess. \nWhile the receptacle has an obvious metaphysical role in the\nTimaeus, its primary role after its introduction is in the\nphysical theory of the dialogue. The argument from 47e3 to 52d4 gives\nTimaeus both the spatial matrix in which to situate, and the material\nsubstratum from which to constitute, the universe that he will fashion\nafter its eternal model. The fashioning, however, is the process of\nbringing order to what was, prior to and apart from the\nCraftsman’s intervention, a thoroughly disorderly state of\naffairs, and so the physical account begins with a description of that\ndisorderly, “god-forsaken” (53b3–4) initial\nstate. \nIn that state, dramatically described at 52d4–53c3, the filled\nspace that is the receptacle undergoes constant, erratic motion: it is\nsubject to forces (dunameis, 52e2) that are dissimilar to and\nout of balance with each other, and thus, as each spastic movement\nproduces its chain of spastic reactions, it is perpetually unstable\n(52e1–5). These motions may accidentally produce manifestations\nthat to a would-be observer look like fire or any of the so-called\nfour elements, or “kinds” (genê). Timaeus\ncalls these manifestations “traces” (53b2) of the four\nkinds, and states that even as inarticulate traces, they tended to\nbehave in the ways in which the subsequently articulated kinds would\ncome to behave by necessity: each trace type would gather to its own\nregion, with the heavier to one region and the lighter to another.\nThese migrations are the effect of the ceaseless agitation of the\nreceptacle, which acts like a “winnowing sieve” (52e6),\nseparating the heavy from the light. The result is a pre-cosmic\ninchoate stratification of these traces, which anticipates the\n(perpetually incomplete, 58a2–c4) stratification of the finished\nuniverse. \nIn accordance with the requirements for the construction of the body\nof the universe previously set out at 31b4–32c4, the Craftsman\nbegins by fashioning each of the four kinds “to be as perfect\nand excellent as possible…” (53b5–6). He selects as\nthe basic corpuscles (sômata, “bodies”)\nfour of the five regular solids: the tetrahedron for fire, the\noctahedron for air, the icosahedron for water, and the cube for earth.\n(The remaining regular solid, the dodecahedron, is “used for the\nuniverse as a whole,” [55c4–6], since it approaches most\nnearly the shape of a sphere.) The faces of the first three of these\nare composed of equilateral triangles, and each face is itself\ncomposed of six elemental (scalene) half equilateral right-angled\ntriangles, whose sides are in a proportion of 1:√3:2. Timaeus\ndoes not say why each face is composed of six such triangles, when in\nfact two, joined at the longer of the two sides that contain the right\nangle, will more simply constitute an equilateral triangle. The faces\nof the cube are squares composed of four elemental isosceles\nright-angled triangles and again, it is not clear why four should be\npreferred to two. Given that every right-angled triangle is infinitely\ndivisible into two triangles of it own type (by dropping a\nperpendicular from the right-angle vertex to the hypotenuse, the\nresulting two smaller right triangles are both similar to the original\ntriangle) the equilateral or square faces of the solids and thus the\nstereometric solids themselves have no minimal size. Possibly, then,\nthe choice of six component triangles for the equilateral and four for\nthe square is intended to prevent the solid particles from becoming\nvanishingly\n small.[33] \nSince each of the first three of the regular solids has equilateral\nfaces, it is possible for any fire, air or water corpuscles to come\napart in their interactions—they cut or crush each\nother—and their faces be reconstituted into corpuscles of one of\nthe two other sorts, depending on the numbers of faces of the basic\ncorpuscles involved. For example, two fire corpuscles could be\ntransformed into a single air corpuscle, or one air corpuscle into two\nfire corpuscles, given that the tetrahedron has four faces and the\noctahedron eight (other examples are given at 56d6–e7). In this\nway Timaeus explains the intertransformation that can occur among\nfire, air and water. On the other hand, while the faces of the cube\nparticles may also come apart, they can only be reconstituted as\ncubes, and so earth undergoes no intertransformation with the other\n three.[34]\n Having established the construction and interactive behavior of the\nbasic particles, Timaeus continues the physical account of the\ndiscourse with a series of applications: differences among varieties\nof each of the primary bodies are explained by differences in the\nsizes of the constituent particles (some varieties consisting of\nparticles of different sizes), and compounds are distinguished by\ntheir combinations of both different sorts and different sizes of\nparticles. These various arrangements explain the perceptible\nproperties possessed by the varieties of primary bodies and their\ncompounds. An object’s particular arrangement of triangles\nproduces a particular kind of “disturbance” or\n“experience” (pathos) in the perceiving subject,\nso that the object is perceived as having this or that perceptible\nproperty. \nIt is a fair question to ask how the physics of the discourse relates\nto its metaphysics—for example, how the perceptible properties\nof observable instances of fire (its brightness, lightness and heat,\nlet us say) relate to the form of Fire, an intelligible reality that\nhas no perceptible properties at all. The form of Fire is the\nnon-spatial, non-material, non-perceptible intelligible, eternal and\nunchanging nature of fire that the Craftsman “imitates,”\nand in so doing produces spatially extended, material, perceptible,\ntransient and variable instances of fire. Although we are not told\nwhat it is about the nature of fire that requires observable instances\nof it to have just these properties, it is presumably that knowledge\nthat guides the Craftsman to select and assign the four regular solids\nas he does. Given that the nature of fire is such that any\n“imitations” of it that appear in the Receptacle must be\nperceptible as bright, light and hot, the type of solid body that best\nsupports these properties—the tetrahedron, it turns\nout—should be assigned to fire. And so with the other three\nkinds (see 55d7–56c7). \nPlato inherited from Socrates the conviction that knowledge of\ngoodness has a salvific effect upon human life. That knowledge\nremained elusive to Socrates. As Plato continues the Socratic quest,\nhe expands the scope of the search beyond ethical matters. In the\nPhaedo, as we saw earlier, the character Socrates expresses\nthe conviction that goodness is the true cause (aitia) of the\nbeneficent arrangement of the natural world, though the nature of\ngoodness continues to elude him as well. The causal supremacy of\ngoodness is recognized in the metaphysical and epistemological roles\nassigned to the Republic’s form of the Good, and it is\nthe understanding of that form that constitutes the culmination of the\neducation of the philosophical statesman, the paragon of the virtuous\nand happy person. What remains to be articulated is a conception of\nhow cosmic goodness is manifested in the universe so that humans will\nrecognize it, understand it, and emulate it in order that their lives\nmay become truly virtuous and\n happy.[35] \nWe saw above that in its dramatic context, the Timaeus is the\nsecond of a series of three or possibly four (see Critias\n108a–b) speeches exchanged by four or possibly five (see\nTimaeus 17a) friends during one of the yearly Athenian\nPanathenaic festivals. It is sandwiched between Socrates’\nRepublic-like speech, which is briefly summarized at the\nbeginning of the Timaeus (17c–19b), and Critias’\nspeech, the unfinished sequel to the\n Timaeus,[36]\n which was intended to recount and celebrate the great victory of\nancient, prehistoric Athens over the vast military might of\n Atlantis.[37]\n The stated thematic purpose of Timaeus’ discourse is to provide\nan account of human nature in the context of the nature of the\nuniverse as a whole. Conjoined with Socrates’ previous account\nof education (à la Republic) this account will provide\nthe basis for Critias’ forthcoming account of human virtue in\naction, as displayed by the deeds of the ancient Athenians\n (27a7–b1).[38]\n If we take this stated purpose seriously, we will expect the entire\ncosmological account to culminate in human psychology and ethics. And\nthat is indeed what we find. \nIn the passage that may fairly be taken as the climax of\nTimaeus’ discourse (90a2–d7), human beings are urged to\ndevote their utmost attention to the cultivation and preservation of\nthe well being of their immortal, rational souls. The well being of a\nrational soul consists in its being well ordered (eu\nkekosmêmenon, 90c5), and so the goal of human life, given\nthe fact that the soul’s revolutions were thrown off course\naround the time of birth (43a6–44b1), is to realign\n(exorthounta, 90d3) those revolutions with those of the\nuniverse at large. Such realignment is achieved by a study of the\nrevolutions and harmonies of the universe and, once achieved, restores\nthe soul to its original condition and thereby brings to fulfillment\n“that most excellent life offered to humankind by the gods, both\nnow and forevermore” (90d5–7).","contact.mail":"Barbara.Sattler@rub.de","contact.domain":"rub.de"}]
