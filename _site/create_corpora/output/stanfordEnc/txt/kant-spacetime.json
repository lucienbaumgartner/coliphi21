So the reader\nwill not be surprised to learn that scholars consider this discussion\nto be central to Kant’s so-called critical philosophy. Given Kant’s\nreputation for developing difficult, not to say obscure, philosophical\nviews, it will also not surprise the reader to learn that there is no\nconsensus on how Kant’s conception of space and time ought to be\ncharacterized and explicated. So the goal of this entry is to bring\nsome clarity to Kant’s views by situating them historically and\nphilosophically within the milieu of some central debates concerning\nspace and time in the early modern period, especially the rich century\nbetween the first edition of Newton’s Principia mathematica,\nwhich was first published in 1687, and the publication of the second\nedition of the Critique of Pure Reason, which occurred\nexactly a hundred years later. The difficulty of comprehending Kant’s\nviews gives interpreters a reason to place a special emphasis on\ncontext—I will especially highlight Kant’s reactions to his most\nsignificant predecessors in this area, Leibniz and Newton. The focus\nthroughout will be on Kant’s magnum opus, the Critique of Pure\nReason. Following tradition, and to some extent Kant’s own lead,\nthe focus will also be on space and on our representation of space,\nalthough parallel points concerning time (and its representation) will\nsometimes be indicated.\n\n\nIn what follows, the Critique of Pure Reason is cited by the\nusual A/B method; other references are to Kants gesammelte\nSchriften (via “Ak” [for Akademie edition] followed\nby volume and page number). The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence is cited\nby referring to author-letter-section (e.g., L 3:1 refers to the first\nsection of Leibniz’s third letter). All translations are by the author\nof this entry, unless otherwise noted. The following convention is\nadopted: concepts are referred to by using brackets; the concept gold\nis referred to by <gold>. By contrast, we employ the usual\nconvention of using ‘gold’ to refer to the word.\n\nIn the context of interpreting Kant’s views concerning space and time,\na number of philosophical questions are relevant. Kant himself\nprovides a litany of these questions in his so-called Inaugural\nDissertation of 1770, a text in which he broke with his previous\nbroadly “Leibnizian” views from the pre-critical period\n(Hatfield 2006, 72-6). He writes: \nIn this one pithy sentence, we find a list of many important early\nmodern questions concerning space. Is space “real,” or is\nit “ideal” in some sense? Is it a substance in its own\nright, a property of some substance, or perhaps neither? Is it somehow\ndependent on the relations among objects, or independent of those\nrelations? What is the relationship between space and the mind? And\nfinally, how do these various issues intersect with one another? \nThe passage from the Inaugural Dissertation hints at five\ndistinct questions or issues concerning space and time. First, there\nis the question of the ontology of space and time considered within\nthe framework of what Kant would regard as the dogmatic metaphysics of\nthe seventeenth century. This framework might suggest that if space\nand time are to exist, or to characterize the physical world, they\nmust be considered either substances in their own right, or else\nproperties of some substance. Neither option seems particularly\nattractive. Space and time seem distinct from substances because they\nare causally inert, causally inaccessible—their aspects or\nproperties cannot be altered by interacting with any other\nsubstance—and imperceptible. Since they are often regarded as\ninfinite, moreover, some thinkers have doubted that they could be\nsubstances, as God is often thought of as the sole infinite substance\n(Descartes may have conceived of space as “indefinite” for\nthis reason). However, it is also difficult to think of space and time\nas properties of any substance, for then they would presumably be\ndependent on that substance for their existence. If we regard them as\ndependent on any contingent substance, it seems that we would be\ncommitted to the idea that space and time could fail to exist, or\ncould disappear, depending on the happenings of that contingent\nsubstance. One might think instead that space and time depend on the\none necessary substance, but this obviously raises a host of other\nissues. To think of space and time as properties of God is potentially\nto regard God as spatiotemporal, which is verboten from the\npoint of view of many seventeenth-century thinkers (Janiak 2008,\nchapter five). \nA second topic arises if we consider the ontology of space and time\nindependently from the substance-property metaphysical framework, viz.\nby considering the relationship of space and time to physical objects.\nFollowing Newton’s discussion in the first (1687) edition of the\nScholium in the Principia, the modern debate concerning\nspace’s ontology has been centered on two overarching conceptions:\nabsolutism (now sometimes called “substantivalism,”\nalthough that label raises certain issues), the view that space and\ntime exist independently of all possible objects and object relations,\nor perhaps the view that space-time points exist; and relationalism,\nthe view that space and time depend for their existence on possible\nobjects and relations, or perhaps the view that space-time points do\nnot exist (DiSalle 2006). \nLeaving aside questions about ontology, there is a distinct—or\nat least potentially distinct—issue regarding space and time:\nwhat is the origin of our representation of space and of time? This\nthird issue arises from the sense in the early modern period that our\nidea or representation of space and time must somehow be importantly\ndistinct from our idea or representation of ordinary physical objects.\nMany believed that space and time are causally inert and therefore\nimperceptible—how then are we are able to represent space and\ntime at all? Few are willing to deny that we have a representation,\nnot merely of spatial and of temporal objects, but also of space and\ntime themselves, so there is a genuine puzzle lurking here. \nThe fourth topic follows on the heels of the third: what is the\ncontent of our idea or representation of space and time? From Kant’s\npoint of view, the content of a representation might provide us with a\nguide as to its possible origin. Alternatively, we might be able to\nconsider the origin of a representation as providing us with a clue as\nto what its content might be. In the case of space, there may be\nreason to think that the content of our representation must somehow\nreflect what we know about space from Euclidean geometry. \nThe fifth and final topic is closely connected with the third and\nfourth, and indeed, connects all four previous topics with one\nanother: what is the relationship between space and time, on the one\nhand, and the human mind, on the other? This question obviously cries\nout for clarification. Part of what this question might mean can be\ncharacterized by the third and fourth questions above: if we think of\nthe mind as representing space and time in a certain way, then perhaps\nthis is part of our understanding of the mind’s relationship with\nspace and time themselves. But within the context of Kant’s work,\nthere is, at least prima facie, another issue lurking here—are\nspace and time somehow dependent upon the mind for their existence? It\nmay be that some kind of dependence is suggested by the\norigin—or by the content—of our representation of space\nand time (or perhaps by these two jointly). But Kant also seems to\nthink that a view recognizing the dependence of space and time on the\nmind might offer advantages in addressing the ontological problems\nmentioned above. \nEach of these five philosophical issues concerning space and time is\nrelevant for understanding Kant’s views. As we will see below, part of\nthe difficulty in interpreting Kant arises from the fact that he\nevidently transforms various aspects of the early modern debates\nconcerning space and time through the perspective presented in the\nfirst Critique (Allison 2004, 120-1). Within the context of\nthe first issue raised above, the view that space and time are\nreal may mean that space and time are substances in their own\nright, rather than merely properties; yet within the context of the\nabsolutism-relationalism debate, if space and time are real,\nthey exist independently of all objects and relations. But Kant uses\nthe terms real and ideal to express views concerning\nthe relation between space and time and the mind, leaving aside any\nviews concerning objects and relations. This entry aims to clarify\nmatters by separating these various considerations. \nThere is no doubt that the debate between the Leibnizians and the\nNewtonians concerning the status of space and time forms part of the\nessential background to Kant’s views throughout his career. Although\nNewton originally formulated his conception of space and time in\nresponse to Descartes’s views in the Principles of Philosophy\n(1644), by the turn of the eighteenth century, Newton and his\nfollowers were embroiled in an extensive debate with Leibniz and his\nsupporters on the Continent. This reflected, in part, the famous\npriority dispute regarding the calculus, but it also reflected some of\nLeibniz’s fundamental criticisms of Newton’s views of space, time and\nmotion in Principia mathematica (1687, 1713—second\nedition). Leibniz raised many of those criticisms in his\ncorrespondence with Samuel Clarke, who defended Newton’s ideas. Kant\nmentions this debate frequently throughout the Critique (see,\ne.g., A23/B37, A39/B56, & A46/B64). \nMany interpreters have thought that in the Critique of Pure\nReason, and particularly in its first section, the Transcendental\nAesthetic, Kant attempts to engage the Leibnizian\n“relationalist” and the Newtonian “absolutist”\nconceptions of space with transcendental\n idealism.[1]\n As Charles Parsons puts it, “the issue between what are now\ncalled absolutist and relationalist conceptions of space and time,\nrepresented paradigmatically by Newton and Leibniz” represents\n“the background to all of [Kant’s] thinking” about space\nand time (Parsons 1992, 67; cf. Torretti 1999, 105). In the beginning\nof the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant frames his view by contrasting\nit with the failures of the Leibnizians and the Newtonians to conceive\nof space appropriately: \nThe view that space and time are actual entities is meant to represent\nthe Newtonian position, and the view that they are determinations or\nrelations of things, the Leibnizian position (but cf. Hatfield 2006,\n77-8). Later in the Transcendental Aesthetic, he refers to the\nNewtonians as the “mathematical investigators” of nature,\nwho contend that space and time “subsist” on their own,\nand to the Leibnizians as the “metaphysicians of nature,”\nwho think that space and time “inhere” in objects and\ntheir relations (see A39-40/B56-57). \nWhile Kant does clearly allude to this theoretical background, it is\nnoteworthy that views of the sort he articulates in the\nAesthetic—that space and time are transcendentally ideal, that\nthey are mere “forms” of intuition, that they depend upon\nthe “subjective constitution of the mind,” and so\non—do not obviously make contact with the Leibniz/Newton debate.\nThis raises questions about Kant’s use of the Leibniz-Newton\nbackground. First, how does Kant understand the Leibnizian and the\nNewtonian conceptions of space and time? Does he think of them solely\nas views on what I have called the status of space vis-à-vis\nobjects and relations, or does he think that they contain, or perhaps\nentail, views on other topics, such as the character of our\nrepresentations of space and time? Does Kant regard himself as needing\nto undermine either, or both, of these prior conceptions in order to\nsupport his conclusion that space and time are transcendentally ideal?\nDoes Kant’s rejection of both the Leibnizian and the\nNewtonian conceptions as types of “transcendental realism”\nilluminate what he means by transcendental idealism? And finally, is\nKant on secure ground in characterizing his predecessors’ views in\nthis way? These questions will help to guide the discussion below. \nThe fact that Kant focuses on the debate between the Leibnizians and\nthe Newtonians is perplexing given his evident lack of interest,\nwithin the context of the Critique, in problems concerning\nmotion. One of Newton’s principal reasons for distinguishing between\nan “absolute” (or “mathematical”) and a\n“relative” (or “common”) conception of space\nis to ground a distinction between true and merely relative motion.\nNewton construes the true motion of an object, as opposed to its\nmerely “apparent” motion, not in terms of its change in\nrelations to other objects, as Descartes had done in his\nPrinciples, but in terms of its change of absolute place\n(Janiak 2008, chapter five). So the very idea of absolute or\nmathematical space helps to express what true motion is. Discovering\nthe true, as opposed to the merely apparent, motions of objects, so\nthat one can then determine the forces that cause these true motions,\nrepresents one of the principal goals of Newton’s\nPrincipia. \nKant is perfectly well aware of these details from the Scholium to the\nPrincipia, but he makes it clear in the Transcendental\nAesthetic that he wishes to bracket questions concerning the motion of\nobjects, because motion is an empirical concept, and the Aesthetic\naims to articulate a purely a priori conception of space (see\nA 41/B 58; also MFNS, 4: 482). Instead, Kant tackles issues concerning\nphysical motion in the Metaphysical Foundations, where he\ncontends that one can distinguish true from relative motion by\ndetermining the center of mass frame of the solar system (4: 482, 487,\n555-6, 559-63), thereby avoiding the postulation of Newton’s\nmathematical (absolute) space. \nBut what if we abstract away from questions of physical motion (Janiak\n2009)? What if we consider motion within a much more abstract context:\nfor instance, can the motion of a mathematical point through\nspace be considered in the Aesthetic? Kant makes it clear that this\nremains empirical because the concept of motion itself is empirical,\nand so should still be deferred to the Metaphysical\nFoundations. Indeed, the latter begins with a consideration of\nmotion in abstraction from various physical questions like the mass of\nthe objects and then slowly progresses by adding further physical (or\nempirical) elements. \nKant does discuss the important notion of the “motion of the\nsubject” in a famous footnote in §26 of the Transcendental\nDeduction. Is that kind of motion under discussion, perhaps\nimplicitly, in the context of the Aesthetic? Kant does not think that\nthe “motion of the subject,” for instance in drawing a\ncircle, is empirical, but he does think that it requires—indeed,\nit apparently exemplifies—the unity of the manifold of intuition\nimposed by the unity of consciousness. Whatever this doctrine may\nmean, it seems clear that from Kant’s own perspective it cannot be\ndealt with in the Aesthetic, for the latter text abstracts from all\ncontributions of understanding and therefore abstracts from any\nconsideration of the unity of the manifold imposed by the unity of\nunderstanding. (This seems to be closely related to Kant’s point in\n§26 that it is only from within the point of view of the\nTranscendental Analytic that one is able to make a distinction between\nwhat he calls space as a form of intuition and space as a\nformal intuition.) So from Kant’s point of view, although\nvarious kinds of motion are considered in the critical\nphilosophy—including the so-called motion of the subject in\ndescribing a space, the motion of a mathematical point through space,\nand the motion of a body through space—no kind of motion can be\nconsidered within the context of the Aesthetic (see Pollok 2006). \nThis seems to suggest that Kant’s interest in the\nabsolutism-relationalism debate does not originate with his concern to\ndiscuss motion in any sense of the term. In what follows,\nthen, one goal is to specify why Kant remains focused in the Aesthetic\non the views of Leibniz and Newton (and their respective followers).\nIt may be that Kant’s interest derives from his general interest in\nthe views of what he calls the “metaphysicians,” the\nLeibnizians, and of what he calls the “mathematicians,”\nthe Newtonians. Throughout the pre-critical and critical periods, Kant\nevinces considerable interest in various attempts to reconcile certain\naspects of Leibnizian metaphysics with the Newtonian view of nature\n(Friedman 1992, 1-52). But there is also more to be said (below) about\nKant’s focus on the absolutism-relationalism debate. \nIn a famous passage in the first Critique, Kant indicates\nwhat he takes a representation to be (A320/B376-77): Figure 1. \nKant regards an intuition as a conscious, objective\nrepresentation—this is strictly distinct from sensation, which\nhe regards not as a representation of an object, property, event,\netc., but merely as a state of the subject. Whereas sensations do not\nrepresent anything distinct from the sensing subject (including\nperhaps the state of the subject’s body), intuitions are objective\n representations.[2]\n Recent scholarship emphasizes the importance of his distinction\nbetween sensation and intuition (Allais 2015, 145-47, 154, 159-60) \nKant then distinguishes intuitions and concepts along the following\nlines: whereas intuitions are singular, immediate representations,\nconcepts are general, mediate ones (Engstrom 2006). Each represents\nproperties, objects, or states of affairs, but they do so distinctly.\nUnfortunately, there is no consensus on the right way to understand\nthis\n idea.[3]But\n roughly speaking, intuition represents some X—where\nX might be an object, a property, or perhaps even an\nevent—as one represents X in perception. Thus it\nrepresents X as, for instance, that\n there.[4]In\n contrast, a concept represents X—where, again,\nX might be a property, an object, or perhaps even an\nevent—by placing X within one or more classes. Suppose\nthat I want to represent my desk, at which I am sitting right now. To\nrepresent my desk in intuition is to represent it as something I point\nto, as that there. This does not indicate, of course, that\nthis is a desk, my desk, a piece of furniture, made of wood, etc., but\nit does pick out a particular. It does so immediately at\nleast in the sense that it makes use of no other representation. To\nrepresent my desk with a concept is to represent it as a\ndesk, or as a piece of furniture, or as a wooden\nthing, etc. From Kant’s point of view, this is to represent my\ndesk mediately at least in the sense that the concept,\n<desk>, represents an object through other concepts, such as\n <furniture>.[5] \nOne of Kant’s surprising ideas is that each type of objective\nrepresentation, intuition and concept, can be either empirical or\na priori. The idea that some concepts are not empirical may\nnot be surprising, although Kant’s conception of the origin\nof such concepts—outlined in what he calls the\n“metaphysical deduction” (B159, B377)—contains\nsurprises (Longuenesse 1998). But it is surely surprising to hear that\nintuition, which in some regards is akin to perception (Parsons 1992,\n65-66; Allais 2015, 147ff), can also be empirical or a\npriori in character. Here it helps to recall that Kant\ndistinguishes sensation from intuition. There remains a question,\nhowever, of how we are to understand the very idea that we can have\npure—or a priori, i.e., non-empirical—intuition\nat all. This idea comprises a central piece of Kant’s views on space\nand time, for he famously contends that space and time are nothing but\nforms of intuition, a view connected to the claim in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic that we have pure intuitions of space and of\ntime. This means, as we have seen, that we have non-empirical,\nsingular, immediate representations of space and of time. One goal of\nthis entry is to clarify this idea. It is not a stretch to contend\nthat this idea represents one of Kant’s most distinctive contributions\nto modern philosophy, although characteristically, it is profoundly\ndifficult to grasp. \nWhat Kant calls the Metaphysical Exposition of the Concept of Space\npresents the first arguments of the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant\ndefines the “exposition” of a concept as follows:\n“By an exposition (expositio) I understand the clear\n(if it is not explicit) representation of what belongs to a concept;\nit is metaphysical if it contains what the concept presents as a\npriori given” (A23/B38). By a concept (Begriff) in\nthis context I take Kant simply to mean a\n representation.[6] \nIn the first argument of the Metaphysical Exposition, Kant suggests\nthat the representation of space cannot be empirical: \nOne might wonder what type of view is at issue here. One potential\ntarget is a classic empiricist account of our idea of space, such as\nthat found in Locke. Acknowledging in the Essay that the idea\nof space seems to be “remote” from our perception of\nobjects, Locke contends nonetheless that its origin lies in experience\n(Essay, 2.13.2-4): perceivers observe objects in close\nproximity to one another, including the distance between objects, and\nthen repeatedly add the ideas of these distances together, thereby\nobtaining an idea of as large a single space as they please. According\nto Locke’s view, a version of which was also defended by Hume\n(Treatise, 1.2.3), we obtain a representation of\nspace—not of places, but of the one all-encompassing space,\nwhich may be akin to geometric space—from the\nperception of spatial relations. \nKant may be focusing attention on the starting place of Locke’s view.\nIt seems that for Locke, we begin with an idea of the distance between\nany two bodies; this would presumably involve an idea of these two\nbodies as being in different places. Kant may be contending that in\norder to represent objects as in different places from one another, I\nmust represent them as in space. But if this were true, then I would\nalready have, as it were, the representation of space, and could not\nobtain it in the way Locke outlines. \nDaniel Warren clarifies this argument in an especially helpful way\n(Warren 1998; cf. Allison 2004, 100-104). Certainly, it is not true in\ngeneral that in any order to represent any two entities, A and B, as\nrelated in some way, I must represent them as falling into a larger\n“space” of some relevant character. Warren gives a useful\nexample: in order to represent A as “brighter than” B, I\nneed not represent A and B as being part of a larger\n“brightness” space. I could do so: I could\nrepresent A and B via the “brightness” relation precisely\nby representing A as lying at one end of a brightness spectrum, and B\nas lying near its other end. But I need not do so: I could simply\nrepresent A and B themselves, and represent A as brighter than B, as I\nmight do with two lights (Warren 1998, 200ff). The suggestion\nis that in order to represent A and B as bearing a spatial\nrelation with one another—say, to represent them as being some\ndistance apart—I must represent A and B as in space. In\nthat sense, the representation of objects as spatially related may\npresuppose the representation of space. The problem for Locke is that\nhe begins with my perception, or idea, of a distance between two\nobjects, and then proceeds to construct my idea of space from that\ninitial point. But if my representation of a distance relation between\nany two objects already presupposes a representation of those objects\nas in space, then the former cannot be the beginning point of a\nprocess that issues in the latter. \nSome commentators have thought that Kant’s second argument in the\nMetaphysical Exposition is intended specifically to undermine\nLeibniz’s relationalism (cf. Parsons 1992, 68-9): \nKant claims that although we can represent space as empty, we cannot\nrepresent to ourselves the absence of space. This point would\nundermine Leibnizian relationalism if the relationalist claim that\nspace is not independent of objects is, at least in part, founded on\nthe claim that the very idea of space existing independently of\nobjects is incoherent. If one held such a view, one could raise doubts\nabout relationalism by contending, as Kant does, that we can in fact\nconceive of space to be devoid of objects. \nThe view that space cannot exist independently of objects at any given\ninstant does seem to entail that space cannot be utterly devoid of\nobjects. Leibniz thinks that space is the order of the actual and\npossible relations among objects, so he has the resources to\nsay that space can contain empty sectors—see New\nEssays, 127, and L 5: 43—but it seems he cannot claim that\nspace is altogether empty, for then object relations would be\nabsent. Yet this view seems perfectly compatible with the\nidea that we can conceive of empty space. Leibniz himself\nmakes repeated and explicit use of the thought of such a situation\nwhen attempting to undermine the Newtonian view that space is\nabsolute. Instead of arguing that the very idea that space could be\nindependent of objects is incoherent, Leibniz contends that it\nviolates the principle of sufficient reason (see L3: 5; L 5: 53), a\nprinciple Clarke himself defends in a distinct version. The\n“fiction” (L5: 29; cf. L5: 55) that space could exist\nindependently of objects violates the principle because the\nhomogeneity and uniformity of space prevent there from being any\nreason for God to place the objects of the universe with one\nparticular orientation within absolute space rather than with any\nother possible orientation. The idea that God could place objects\nwithin a pre-existing absolute space with one orientation rather than\nanother is evidently not incoherent; rather, God would lack a\nreason for doing this. Similarly, Leibniz contends that\nabsolutism violates the principle of the identity of indiscernibles\n(L4: 16) and that it bears theological difficulties (L4: 10). \nThis is not to deny that Leibniz’s relationalism intersects with his\nunderstanding of the representation of space. He thinks that we must\nnot be fooled by the fact that we can think of space as empty of\nobjects into concluding that space itself is something independent of\nobjects and their relations. As with all mere abstractions, we must\nnot reify\n space.[10] \nOne might read Kant’s second argument instead as straightforwardly\ntargeting the view that the representation of space is empirical. Kant\nclaims that we cannot represent the absence of space, but that we can\nrepresent space as empty of objects. His point may be that empiricist\nphilosophers who contend that the representation of space is obtained\nfrom the perception of objects must bear the burden of explaining how\nit is possible for us to conceive of space as empty of such objects.\nThis consideration appears to be rather weak. But the further\ncontention that one cannot represent the absence of space may be more\ndifficult for an empiricist to accept. Prima facie, it is\ndifficult to see why, if our representation of space is indeed\nempirical in origin, we should lack the ability to conceive of space’s\nabsence. But it is not clear that Kant’s very short second\nargument can be read as presenting anything other than this prima\nfacie point against an empiricist view of the representation of\nspace. \nIn these first two arguments, Kant considers, perhaps among other\nthings, the origin of our representation of space, concluding that it\nis not empirical. It seems, though, that these first two arguments\nleave open the question of the content of our representation\nof space in two important senses. First, Kant’s first two arguments do\nnot explicate what properties we represent space as having. Do we\nrepresent it, for instance, as finite or infinite, as homogeneous or\nnot? And so on. Second, the first two arguments in the Transcendental\nAesthetic apparently leave it open that the content of our\nrepresentation of space could be conceptual. That is, they leave it\nopen that our representation of space could be a concept, rather than\nan intuition—it could be either a general, mediate\nrepresentation, or a singular, immediate one. We simply know—if\nKant’s arguments are successful—that the representation is not\nempirical. And Kant certainly thinks that a non-empirical\nrepresentation could be either a concept or an intuition; that is, he\nthinks that we have both a priori concepts and pure\nintuition. Since the idea of pure intuition is puzzling in a way that\nthe idea of an a priori concept may not be, one interpretive\ngoal is to clarify this idea in the course of understanding the second\ntwo arguments of the Metaphysical Exposition. \nIn the third and fourth arguments, Kant contends that the\nrepresentation of space has a specifiable content that is incompatible\nwith it being a conceptual representation. That is, he argues that our\nrepresentation of space is not a concept, but is in fact an\nintuition—it is a singular, immediate representation. As we have\nseen, the distinction between sensation and intuition indicates that\nthis claim does not amount to the idea that we have a sensation of\nspace (an odd idea, it seems). Instead, it amounts to the claim that\nwe have an objective representation of space, but one that is singular\nand immediate, rather than conceptual. \nIn order to understand the two arguments intended to establish the\nconclusion that we have a singular, immediate representation of space,\nit is helpful to recall Kant’s attitude toward concepts. From his\npoint of view, whereas to fall “under” a concept means to\nbe part of a concept’s extension, to fall “within” a\nconcept means to be part of its intension. Just as significantly, the\nextension of a concept, in Kant’s way of thinking, is not the things\nthat instantiate the concept, or the set of things to which the\nconcept “applies”; rather, it is the class of concepts\nthat function as sub-groupings falling under this more general\nheading. This idea requires clarification. \nConsider the extension of\n <being>:[11] Figure 2. \nThe extension of <being> is those concepts on the conceptual\ntree that fall “under” <being>—those concepts\nare species of the genus, <being>. Kant speaks of a series of\ngenus-species relations inhering between the members of the class of\nconcepts that serve as a given concept’s extension; whether a concept\nserves as a genus or a species is relative. The concept\n<created> is a genus with respect to its species\n<material> and <immaterial>, but a species with respect to\nthe genus <being>. The intension of a concept consists\nof those concepts that collectively constitute it. Hence the concept\n<human> has this intension: “rational animate material\ncreated being.” The concepts that collectively constitute a\ngiven concept are often called “Merkmale” or\n“Teilbegriffe,” or what might be called its conceptual\nparts (“Vienna Logic,” Ak 24: 913). To construct the\nconcept <human>, one puts together the concepts\n<rational>, <animate>, <material>,\n<created>, and <being>. To formulate or to grasp the\nconcept <human> just is to grasp these\nconstituents. \nWith these distinctions in mind, we can consider Kant’s third argument\nin the Metaphysical Exposition. In this argument, Kant concentrates on\nthe intension (in his sense) of a concept. \nThe suggestion here is roughly this: if the representation of space\nwere a concept rather than an intuition, one ought to be able to\nconstruct it by placing its parts together. This seems to require that\nit is possible to represent the parts independently of representing\nthe concept to be constructed. This is the case with other concepts:\nit is possible to represent any of the parts of the intension of\n<human>, such as <material being>, without ipso\nfacto representing the whole concept, <human>. Kant is\nclaiming that this will not work in the case of the representation of\nspace because we obtain the representation of places only by\ndelimiting some subsection of our representation of the one\nall-encompassing space. To put the point in a way that highlights a\nparallel with the first argument of the Metaphysical Exposition: the\nrepresentation of any place presupposes the representation of space.\nThus we cannot represent any of the “parts” of\nspace—any place—without ipso facto representing\nspace itself. The idea, then, is that the part-whole relation of the\nrepresentation of space is distinct from the part-whole relation that\nobtains for concepts. \nIt is not clear that this argument is successful. It seems, e.g., to\nconflate the following: (1) the relation between space and its parts;\nand, (2) the relation between the representation of space and its\nconstituents. Without this conflation, it is not clear why we should\nexpect to construct our concept of space from our concept of place. It\nwould seem more sensible to construct our concept of space from other\nconcepts, such as that of infinity, perhaps the concept of a\nmagnitude, and so on, rather than from the concept of a place. The\nclaim of the conflation is predicated on the notion that Kant’s third\nargument concerns the representation of space rather than space\nitself. This notion, in turn, may conflict with the letter, although\nperhaps not with the spirit, of the first sentence of the third\nargument, which mentions that “Der Raum,” or space, is not a concept,\nbut rather is an intuition. If one follows the letter of the argument,\none can avoid this apparent conflation. But the price is somewhat\nhigh: what does it mean to wonder whether space itself is a concept,\nand who held something like that view? On the face of it, such a view\nmay seem rather odd to the contemporary reader. One way to make\nprogress in understanding this view is to re-read Leibniz. It is\npossible to read Leibniz as arguing that space itself is a kind of\nabstraction, rather than a real entity or substance, and perhaps it is\nnot a stretch to contend that space must be a conceptual abstraction,\nlike the entities of what Leibniz might call pure mathematics. That\nis, space itself, on this view, is a kind of conceptual abstraction in\nthe way that an isosceles triangle is an abstraction, or a line is an\nabstraction, rather than a real entity or substance. Of course, this\nrequires us to understand Leibniz’s position through a Kantian lens.\nEven so, if the view in focus is that space itself is a kind of\nconcept, it remains unclear why one wouldn’t say that this concept is\ndependent on other constitutive concepts, such as the concept of\ninfinity or that of homogeneity, which Kant himself tackles in the\nnext numbered argument. Perhaps the best answer here is to read Kant\nas engaging specifically with Leibniz’s argument in his last (fifth)\nexchange with Clarke, mentioned above. The idea is that Leibniz’s\nargument might be understood as involving the claim that the concept\nof place is constitutive of the concept of space, and that space\nitself is really nothing but a kind of concept, which licenses the\nexclusive focus on the concept of space. Then the claim would be that\nthe Leibnizian view that space itself is a conceptual abstraction\nobtained through some process of perceiving objects occupying various\nplaces is wrong on both counts. Just as Kant’s second argument\nattempts to shore-up the idea, presented in the first argument, that\nthe representation of space is a priori, his fourth and final\nargument attempts to shore-up the idea, presented in the third\nargument, that the representation of space is not conceptual in\ncharacter. Here both the extension and the intension of concepts seem\nto be at issue: \nKant claims that since we represent space as containing an infinite\nnumber of places within it, our representation of space cannot be\nconceptual. Why should that be? The idea is that although concepts can\nhave an infinite extension—a potentially infinite number of\nsubordinate concepts under them—they cannot have an\ninfinite intension, an infinite number of representations\nwithin them. A concept that is infinite in the latter sense\ncould not be grasped by a finite\n mind.[12]\n For a concept to have an infinite extension would be for it to have\nan infinite number of species, i.e. for it to be possible to\ndistinguish an infinite number of sub-types “under” it on\nthe conceptual tree. This does not harm our ability to grasp any\nconcept within the tree, for to grasp any arbitrarily chosen concept\nwithin the tree, I merely need to grasp its constituents (those\nconcepts within it), and those would be “above”\nit on the tree. But our ability to grasp concepts would be affected if\nthey could contain an infinite number of constituents within\nthemselves: if, say, <fish> contained an infinite number of\nconstituents—if there were an infinite number of higher-level\nconceptual taxa “above” <fish> on the tree—it\ncould not be grasped, and might even lack determinate content. Or at\nleast, to specify its content would take an infinite number of steps.\n \nAccording to Kant, however, we represent space as having an infinite\nnumber of constituents, namely places. If our representation of space\nwere conceptual, we would be required to represent each of these\nconstituents in order to represent space itself, just as we\nare required to represent metal in order to represent gold. Yet we\ncannot represent every place within space in an effort to represent\nspace itself. If we can take it as settled that we represent space,\nand as settled that we represent it as having an infinite number of\nplaces within it, then our representation of space presumably cannot\nbe conceptual in Kant’s sense. The third argument in the Metaphysical\nExposition seems to imply, as we have seen, that the representation of\nany place presupposes the representation of space itself. This fourth\nargument makes a distinct point: if the representation of space itself\nwere to require the representation of each part that we represent\nspace as having, then we could not represent space at all. Since we do\nrepresent space, and do represent it as having an infinite number of\nplaces within it, our representation of space is not conceptual in\nKant’s sense. Of course, Kant’s readers may deny one of his apparent\nassumptions here, viz., that we represent space as infinite. Readers\nwith broadly empiricist sympathies in particular may be skeptical of\nthis assumption. \nKant’s view that we have an intuition, rather than a concept, of space\ncan be seen to raise a difficult problem: space is not an object, and\nyet intuition seems to provide us with something akin to a perception\nof something. As one recent commentator puts it, intuition involves\n“presence to consciousness of an object” (Allais 2015, 197ff),\nand yet space is not an object. It is difficult to see why we should\nthink of ourselves as perceiving space at all. It is easy enough to\nunderstand the idea that some ordinary thing, like a tomato, is an\nobject that is present to my consciousness, say when I look at the\ntomato on a farm stand. There are, of course, many philosophical\ntheories of perception, and these theories will differ in their\ndiscussions even of simple cases of perception such as this one. But\nit seems uncontroversial to suppose that the tomato is present to my\nconsciousness as an object at least in the sense that the tomato is\none of the things that I’m looking at. And it also seems\nuncontroversial to think that there are many other things, besides\ntomatoes, that might be present to my consciousness in a similar way,\nfrom clouds to fog to rainbows, even though they are not “objects” in\nthe simple sense in which a tomato is an object. However, it certainly\nseems like a stretch to say that space itself might be one of those\nthings. That is not merely because space is not an object in any clear\nsense; it is also because space itself, in this historical and\nphilosophical context, is not something that has a causal impact on\nme. So it remains doubly difficult to see how I might conclude, with\nKant, that I have something akin to a perception of space. Kant\nassures us, of course, that we have an a priori intuition of\nspace, so although he is discussing something akin to perception in\none sense, in another sense what he is discussing is supposed to be\nquite distinct from ordinary perception. Whether that assurance helps\nto clarify this issue for his readers is a matter of debate. What is\nclear, however, is that this aspect of Kant’s conception of space\nremains one of the most controversial, and most difficult, aspects of\nhis theoretical philosophy.  \nKant may have other reasons for thinking that our representation of\nspace is not a concept. If we recall Kant’s view that concepts are\ngeneral, mediate representations, and his view of how these facts are\nreflected in his understanding of the conceptual trees discussed\nabove, then there is indeed at least a prima facie puzzle as\nto how we could have a concept, in Kant’s sense, of space. Consider a\ncontrast class. Even if we think that <God> represents only a\nsingle entity, that fact does not undermine Kant’s view that this\nconcept is a general, mediate representation (cf. Thompson 1972,\n318-19, 328-29). For we represent God, in Kant’s view, by representing\nit through other concepts: for instance, God is a necessary substance\n(A678/B706), so <God> is a mediate representation. This is\ndistinct from the way in which an intuition represents something. And\nthe concept <substance>—which is of course one of the\ncategories (A80/B106)—is a representation that we can grasp\nindependently of grasping <God>. Hence <substance> is a\nconstituent of <God>, but not vice versa. Moreover,\n<God> is a general representation because it places God\nwithin another class, namely the class of substances. It will then be\na matter of some dispute whether the generality criterion and\nthe mediacy criterion amount to the same thing (cf. Parsons\n1992, 63-6). But in any case, the key point here is this: the fact\nthat <God> picks out a single individual—and perhaps even,\ncan pick out only a single individual—does not entail\nthat this concept is not general or mediate. This suggests, in turn,\nthat Kant’s point in the Metaphysical Exposition cannot be that our\nrepresentation of space picks out a single individual and therefore\ncannot be a concept. Rather, he presumably thinks that we do not\nrepresent space either: (1) by representing its constituents, namely\nplaces; or (2) by representing it through other concepts. We\nhave discussed (1) above; what about (2)? \nConcerning (2), note that to represent space by representing it\nthrough other concepts may require one to take a (usually\ncontroversial) stand on the ontology of space in one of the senses\noutlined above. For instance, if one wishes to place <space>\nsomewhere on the conceptual tree, one must presumably find a place for\nit under some concept such as <substance> or <being>. But\nthere is no accepted view of space’s ontology: some regard it as a\nsubstance (or a being), others as a network of relations, others as a\nproperty of God, etc. Because of these long-standing, unresolved\ndisputes, it seems reasonable to regard an approach that depends on\ntheir resolution as unpromising. Kant highlights the accepted fact\nthat we represent space as an infinite Euclidean magnitude—this\ncan be widely accepted, despite the dispute concerning space’s\nontology. \nAnother way to clarify Kant’s arguments regarding conceptuality is to\nconsider what opponent he has in mind for the second two arguments. It\nseems unlikely that Locke’s views are at issue in these\narguments—instead, Kant probably had Leibniz in mind. Leibniz\nheld the view that the idea (or representation) of space hails from\nthe pure understanding, which he contrasts with the kind of Lockean\nview noted above. He writes in the New Essays: \nPHILALETHES: The ideas the perception of which comes to us “by\nmore than one sense, are of space, or extension, figure, motion and\nrest.” \nTHEOPHILUS: These ideas, which are said to come from more than one\nsense – like those of space, figure, motion – come rather\nfrom the common sense, which is to say, from the mind itself; for they\nare ideas of the pure understanding, though ones which relate to the\nexternal world and which the senses make us perceive, and so they\nadmit of definitions and demonstrations. (New Essays, 128,\nwhich corresponds to Leibniz 1840, 230) \nLeibniz may have in mind the idea that our perceptions cannot give us\nthe idea of a continuum, and he certainly thinks of space as a\ncontinuum. The senses, for instance, cannot give us the idea of\nsomething that is infinitely divisible. Elsewhere in the New\nEssays, Leibniz makes a related point by saying that space is\nakin to the entities of “pure mathematics.” \nOne question here is whether Leibniz and Kant agree sufficiently in\ntheir views of concepts for Kant’s arguments to have any bite against\nthe kind of view Leibniz expresses in the New Essays, a text\nthat Kant read sometime after it was first available in 1765\n(Vaihinger 1922, 2: 133, 414 and 428-9). Leibniz, famously, has the\nidea of a complete concept of a substance, and it seems that such as\nconcept would contain an infinite number of constituents—God\ngrasps the complete concept of a substance by grasping all its\nconstituents. Given this view, it may be that the considerations\nadduced in Kant’s fourth argument in the Metaphysical Exposition are\nunlikely to worry Leibniz, since he would simply accept the idea that\nthe representation of space, as with any concept, might have an\ninfinite number of constituents (Posy 2000). However, the third\nargument may have more bite: if Kant is right in contending that the\nrepresentation of any place presupposes the representation of space\nitself, then perhaps that representation lacks the ordinary part-whole\nstructure of a concept. Leibniz may in fact accept that general\nconception of the part-whole structure of concepts. If so, this third\nargument may present a problem for his view. \nYet the first and second arguments of the Exposition are not merely\nopportunities to contend with empiricist views like those of Locke;\nnor are the third and fourth arguments merely aimed at challenging\nrationalist views like those of Leibniz. On the contrary, the claim\nthat the representation of space is neither empirical nor conceptual\nis important in general for Kant’s transcendental idealism and, in\ntandem, it is significant for understanding what he regards as the\nphilosophical mistakes embodied in transcendental realism, and in what\nKant will later call “dogmatic idealism,” both of which he\nstrongly opposes. These are discussed in the next section. \nIn the B (1787) edition of the Critique, §2 of the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, the Metaphysical Exposition, is followed by\n§3, the Transcendental Exposition. Whereas the Metaphysical\nExposition deals, as we have seen, with the origin and the content of\nthe representation of space, its transcendental cousin apparently\nattempts to provide an explanation of what Kant takes to be the\nsynthetic a priori knowledge (or cognition) available to us in\ngeometry. This raises very difficult interpretive issues that arise\nwith Kant’s philosophy of mathematics—such issues are dealt with\nin a separate entry in this Encyclopedia (see Lisa Shabel’s\nentry on\n Kant’s philosophy of mathematics).\n However, Kant may also be raising a related point in this\nsection—consider the following passage, which is inserted within\nthe discussion of geometry (cf. section 2-b above): \nWe have seen in the Metaphysical Exposition that we have a pure (or\na priori) intuition of space, that is, a non-empirical,\nsingular, immediate representation of space. But how is such a\nrepresentation so much as possible? If we are considering an\nempirical, singular, immediate representation, we can easily\nunderstand that in cases of ordinary perception, we can (e.g.) see a\nrose sitting in front of us. Hence our perception may include a\nsingular, immediate representation—that is, we may represent\nthat there. This empirical case is reasonably clear, but what\ndoes it mean to contend that we have a non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representation? This cannot really be akin to a case of\nseeing an object directly in front of us, for one of Kant’s points in\nthe Metaphysical Exposition, as we have seen, is that the\nrepresentation of places, and of objects as bearing spatial relations,\npresupposes the (non-empirical) representation of space. But\nif our representation of space is not akin to seeing something\ndirectly in front of us, then what makes it immediate and singular?\nKant’s suggestion in the passage above appears to be that intuition\nmust somehow have its seat in the subject—it must somehow be a\n“form” of the mind, or more precisely, of what Kant calls\nhere “outer sense”. This obviously brings us very close to\nthe formulation of transcendental idealism—that view is stated\nexplicitly for the first time in the Critique in the very\nnext paragraph of the Transcendental Aesthetic. But the paragraph\nquoted above, coupled with Kant’s discussion of what a Transcendental\nExposition is meant to be, suggests that part of Kant’s goal here is\nto explain how a non-empirical, singular, immediate representation\nof space is possible. (This is parallel to explaining how\nsynthetic a priori knowledge within geometry is\npossible.) \nSimilarly, some commentators have noted that the\n“conclusions” following the Transcendental Exposition (in\nthe very next paragraph following the one quoted above) are given no\nadditional argumentative support, and are therefore intended to follow\nfrom the arguments within the Metaphysical Exposition and the\nTranscendental Exposition. That is, the view that the representation\nof space is an a priori intuition is supposed to entail the rather\nrobust conclusions about space that Kant reaches in the Transcendental\nAesthetic. His first such conclusion—labeled “a” and\nfollowed by another conclusion labeled “b”—is rather\nstartling: \nAmong other things, Kant returns here to the debate concerning space\nand time between the Leibnizians and the Newtonians he mentioned at\nthe outset of the Transcendental Aesthetic. It seems that Kant intends\nhis view to be contrasted with the Newtonian view of space, which\napparently tells us something about its “absolute”\ndeterminations, and also with the Leibnizian view of space, which\napparently tells us something about its “relative”\ndeterminations. Perhaps Kant is suggesting here that the Newtonian and\nLeibnizian views of space and time, despite their evident differences\nalong various dimensions, each indicate that the representation of\nspace cannot be a non-empirical, singular, immediate representation,\nor perhaps they tacitly suppose that it cannot be such a\nrepresentation. If he is suggesting that idea, one wonders why that\nwould be the case. I discuss this issue in the next section. \nIn the next few paragraphs of the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant\nreaches the famous conclusions that we can speak of space “only\nfrom the human standpoint” (A26/B42) and that space has\n“transcendental ideality” (A28/B44). This is the heart of\none of Kant’s main positions in the Critique of Pure Reason.\nIn order to clarify these ideas, I first follow Kant’s suggestion in\nthe passage above that he intends his position to be contrasted in\nsome respects with the positions of Leibniz and of Newton. This will\nplace us in a position to understand transcendental idealism in a bit\nmore depth. \nVarious confusions can plague one’s understanding of the modern debate\nbetween absolutism and relationalism about space and time—some\nof these confusions are especially pervasive in discussions of Kant’s\nviews. For instance, absolutism is sometimes conflated with realism,\nand idealism with relationalism. One reason for the first conflation\nmay be historical in nature. In their celebrated correspondence, which\nforms part of the essential background to Kant’s work on space and\ntime in the Critique, Clarke and Leibniz often consider the\nproposition: space is real. By our lights, realism and\nanti-realism concern the question of whether something is in some\nsense dependent on the mind. We ask this question about tables and\nchairs, numbers and sets, and all manner of other things. But when\nLeibniz and Clarke discuss the “reality,” or the\n“absolute reality,” of space, they are typically concerned\nwith the question of space’s status vis-à-vis objects. This is\nclearly the case when Leibniz and Clarke consider one of the principal\nquestions of their correspondence, whether their common acceptance of\nthe principle of sufficient reason entails that one of them holds the\ncorrect conception of space (cf. L3: 4 and C 3: 4-5). Leibniz\ncontends, while Clarke denies, that if space were independent of\nobjects, God would lack a sufficient reason for placing the objects of\nthe universe into space with one orientation rather than another.\nLeibniz concludes from this that space lacks “reality” or\nthat it lacks “absolute reality” (see L5: 29 and L5: 36).\nBased on precisely the same considerations, Leibniz denies\nthat space is “absolute” (L3: 2-3, L3: 5, L4: 16, L4:\n9-10), or contends that it is “relative” (L3: 4). Hence in\nthis context, for space to be real is for space to exist\nindependently of objects and relations. \nLikewise, Leibniz’s contention that space is ideal (L5: 33)\nserves as his response to Clarke’s claim (C4: 7) that there can be\n“extramundane” space, that is, space beyond the boundaries\nof the object-universe. Here, too, the contention that space is\nideal—or that it lacks reality—amounts to the contention\nthat it cannot exist independently of objects. This is\nevident in a passage from Leibniz’s last letter: \nNote that by “real space out of the material universe”\nLeibniz does not mean space independent of the mind, but\nrather, space independent of objects. \nThis is not to say that there is no discussion of space’s status\nrelative to the mind in the correspondence. Leibniz asserts in his\nlast letter that relations are “ideal” because they are\nneither substances nor accidents, and are therefore not elements of\nreality (L5: 47). As he writes in the New Essays, in reality\nthere are only substances and properties of substances; the mind\n“adds” relations (New Essays, 2.12; cf. also\n2.30.4 and 2.25.1). Since space is the order of the possible relations\nof objects, it is presumably ideal in the sense of being\nmind-dependent. But Leibniz’s point here seems to be that just as\npeople reify relations, thinking they exist independently of objects,\nthey reify space, thinking it too exists independently of objects. So\neven when Leibniz discusses the ideality of space, he does so to\nindicate that we need not think of relations and of space as absolute\nin order to account for the tendency toward reification. \nThe ideality and reality of space bear a different significance for\nKant than they do for Leibniz and Clarke. For Kant, asking whether\nsomething is real or ideal concerns its status vis-à-vis the\nmind. One of Kant’s most explicit discussions of realism and idealism\nappears in the Fourth Paralogism (A368-380), where he is concerned\nwith the possible mind-dependent status of objects and with the status\nof our knowledge of their existence. Although it is clear that Kant is\ndiscussing the status of spatial objects vis-à-vis the mind,\nin part by discussing the relation of space and time to the\nmind, there is no treatment here of the status of space and time\nvis-à-vis objects per se. \nIn light of these points, consider the following table: \nA realist can be a relationalist if she thinks space is the order of\nactual and possible relations among actual (and maybe possible)\nobjects and she thinks those relations are real. This\nindicates, incidentally, that realists about space need not think of\nit as a kind of object: it can be perfectly real and\nthe order of possible relations among objects. Indeed, Kant himself\nmay have held this view in his Physical Monadology of 1755:\nhe still accepted Leibinzian relationalism, but he rejected the\nLeibnizian construal of relations, holding them to be aspects of\n reality.[13]\n Similarly, some contemporary defenders of relationalism seem to hold\nthe view that space is the order of actual and possible relations\namong actual and possible objects, and those relations are perfectly\nreal, that is, they are not dependent on the mind in any sense. \nAbsolutism raises other difficulties. It is possible to think of space\nas an instantaneous framework projected onto reality by the\n mind.[14]\n If space is such a mind-dependent framework, it could still be\nthought of as independent of objects. At any rate, if absolutism\nindicates that space is independent of all objects and relations, and\nif that is held to entail that it must be independent of the mind as\nwell, we probably require some clarification of this entailment, for\nit is not obvious (Ishiguro 1972, 109). In fact, Kant may have\ndefended an absolutist-idealist conception of space in the\nInaugural Dissertation of 1770 (Friedman 1992, 29-31). \nKant consistently writes in the Critique of ideality and\nreality in the more familiar modern sense, where mind-dependence is at\nissue. Kant’s usage serves to shift the philosophical discussion\nconcerning space from a focus on relationalism and absolutism to one\non idealism and realism. Hence when he reflects on the Newtonian and\nLeibnizian conceptions of space and time in general terms in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, he eschews a discussion of the relative\nmerits of absolutism and relationalism in favor of discussing the\ncommon mistake of his predecessors. For instance, after outlining his\nconception of space and time, Kant claims: “Those, however, who\nassert the absolute reality [absolute Realität] of space\nand time, whether they take it to be subsisting or only inhering, must\nthemselves come into conflict with the principles\n[Principien] of experience” (A39/B56). The former\ngroup, also called “the mathematical investigators of\nnature,” is clearly identified with the Newtonians, and the\nlatter, the “metaphysicians of nature,” with the\nLeibnizians (cf. Shabel 2005, 31, 45-9). So transcendental idealism is\narticulated as a kind of replacement for the Leibnizian and\nNewtonian conceptions of space and time, but it is not their status as\nrelationalist and absolutist conceptions, respectively, that calls for\ntheir replacement. Rather, it is their status as representatives of a\nseparate and overarching conception of space, a conception according\nto which space (like time) is said to bear an “absolute\nreality.” This occurrence of ‘absolute’ clearly\ncannot have the meaning that Leibniz and Clarke intend. \nThis raises a difficult question. Kant contends that transcendental\nidealism as a general conception of space is to be contrasted with\ntranscendental realism, a position he attributes both to Newton and to\nLeibniz. Yet from Leibniz’s point of view, the only elements of\nreality are substances and their properties. Relations, which are\nneither substances nor properties, are not among such elements, if we\nare speaking with metaphysical rigor. This is evident in a number of\ntexts; for instance, in response to his Lockean interlocutor, Leibniz\nwrites in the New Essays: “This division of the objects\nof our thoughts into substances, modes, and relations is pretty much\nto my liking. I believe that qualities are nothing but modifications\nof substances and the understanding adds relations [l’entendement y\nadjoute les relations].” He adds that relations are “the\nwork of the understanding” (New Essays, 145). Since\nspace for Leibniz is just the order of object relations, and relations\nare ideal, space too is ideal in some sense (New Essays, 145;\ncf. Cassirer 1902, 248). That is to say, there is a sense in which\nspatiality does not characterize reality (Adams 1994, 254-5). These\nviews are to be found in the letters to Clarke and in the New\nEssays, both of which Kant read, and Kant himself explicitly\nmentions some of\n them.[15]\n The obvious obstacles to understanding Leibniz as a realist\ncomplicate the interpretation of transcendental idealism, since Kant\nclearly thinks it is an alternative to both Leibniz’s and Newton’s\n(allegedly realist) views. This problem is tackled in the next\nsection. \nWhy might Kant characterize Leibniz as holding some version of the\n“transcendental realist” perspective that he also\nattributes to Newton? This characterization is puzzling, as we have\nseen. If we return to the conceptual matrix above, it is not merely\nthat Leibniz considers space to be the order of the possible relations\namong objects, and therefore to be dependent upon objects and their\nrelations; it is also the case that he explicitly adopts the common\nearly modern view that relations are ideal in the sense that\nthey are somehow dependent upon the\n mind.[16]\n So prima facie, if space is a relational order, or dependent\nupon relations, and relations, in turn, are dependent upon the mind,\nthen it seems that space is itself dependent upon the mind. Thus\nLeibniz appears to deny that space is real in a\nKantian sense. Denying that space is real can be equivalent\nto denying that space is absolute; but Leibniz’s relationalism,\ncoupled with his familiar early modern view of relations (an\nindependent metaphysical thesis), seems to entail that space is\nalso not real in the sense that it is not independent of the\nmind. In what sense, then, can Leibniz be called a transcendental\nrealist? Prima facie, it is unfair to interpret him in this way. \nWe might return to the first description in the Critique of\nthe Leibnizian position regarding space and time, which appears just\nbefore Kant begins the Metaphysical Exposition of Space. He asks of\nspace and time: “Are they only determinations or also relations\nof things, yet such as would belong to things even if they were not\nintuited?”\n (A23/B38).[17]\n This may suggest what Kant has in mind when he contends that the\nLeibnizians think of space and time as bearing an “absolute\nreality.” Perhaps what he means is that for Leibniz, space has a\nreality independent of intuition, or that space exists\nindependently of intuition per se, even though it may not be\nindependent of the mind per se. But then what might this idea\nmean in more detail? \nIn his extensive discussion of Leibniz in the so-called Amphiboly,\nKant suggests that Leibniz’s transcendental realism might be expressed\nin his view that space and time are phenomena bene\nfundata: \nSpace is the order of the actual and possible relations of objects;\nsince objects reflect the order of substances (in some\nvery-difficult-to-specify sense), space itself reflects the order of\nsubstances, albeit in a confused manner (see Langton 1998, 68-96).\nWhereas a conceptual representation of this circumstance would provide\none with a representation of the monadic order, sensibility\nmisrepresents space as an independent entity. Hence space is\nindependent of intuition in that it is the order of relations, and\nthat order reflects or expresses the order of substances, which itself\nis independent of\n intuition.[18]\n Hence space is viewed as “a certain order in the community of\nsubstances,” a variant of which Kant himself defended in the\npre-critical period (see Friedman’s introduction to Metaphysical\nFoundations, 174). \nThis indicates, in turn, how to interpret the idea that transcendental\nrealism can involve different portrayals of space’s relationship with\nobjects. One may think that space is independent of intuition by\nclaiming that it supervenes on the order of substances (which itself\nis independent of intuition); or, one may think that space is\nindependent of intuition by claiming that space is an independently\nexisting entity. The former is the Leibnizian view, the latter the\nNewtonian. Kant suggests as much in the Transcendental Aesthetic: \nBut how does Leibniz’s conception of the representation of space\nsquare with Kant’s reading? In his latter letter to Clarke, Leibniz\nattempts to show that we can form an idea of space without relying on\nthe notion that space is somehow independent of the relations of\nobjects (L 5: 47). Since he talks of people “observing”\nvarious objects and their relations to one another, it can sound as if\nhe thinks that the idea of space is obtained through sensory\nexperience of object relations. But which idea of space does he have\nin mind? In other words, what is the content of the idea of space that\nhe has in mind? He may mean that one can gain a rough and ready idea\nof space—of a three-dimensional magnitude that is not itself a\nproperty of any object or grouping of objects—in the way that he\ndescribes. But surely one cannot gain the mathematical view of space\nin this way, for several reasons that Leibniz expresses in the New\nEssays (as noted above): (a) space and time are entities in pure\nmathematics; (b) space is a continuum, and one certainly cannot obtain\nthat notion from the sense perception of object relations; (c) sense\nperception will generate a confused idea, but to have a clear and\ndistinct idea of space, one indicating its properties as a\nmathematical entity, requires something other than sense perception.\nSo it seems reasonable to distinguish between an ordinary, everyday\nconception of space—one in which we need not consider whether it\nis infinite or finite, infinitely divisible or finitely divisible,\nwhether the parallel postulate holds, etc.—and our geometric\nconception of space. There can be little doubt that Kant has our\ngeometric conception of space in mind throughout the Transcendental\nAesthetic—this is clear in the third argument of the\nmetaphysical exposition and throughout the transcendental\nexposition. \nSo for Leibniz, <space>confused arises from our\nperceptual experience with objects, but <space>clear &\ndistinct could not possibly so arise. Kant himself emphasizes,\nnot only in the Amphiboly, but also in the Aesthetic itself, that the\nLeibnizians are committed to the view that\n<space>confused arises from our perceptual experience\nof objects and their relations. In §7 of the Aesthetic (in the B\nedition), he writes: \nWe might read Kant’s Leibniz as committed to the following claims: \nWe can then see the first two arguments in the Metaphysical Exposition\nas attempting to undermine (1), and the second two arguments as\nattempting to undermine (2). Thus Leibniz denies that we have an a\npriori, singular, immediate representation of space. Instead, he\nthinks we begin with an empirical representation of space, remove the\nconfused elements of that representation, and thereby obtain a clear\nand distinct idea, i.e., a conceptual representation of an abstract\nmathematical\n entity.[20] \nThis discussion is reminiscent of Kant’s fundamental disagreement with\nthe Leibnizians regarding what Kant calls “sensibility”\nand “understanding.” In the General Remarks on the\nAesthetic, we read: \nThat, therefore, our entire sensibility is nothing but the confused\nrepresentation of things, which contains solely that which pertains to\nthem in themselves, but only under a heap of marks and partial\nrepresentations that we can never separate from one another\nconsciously, is a falsification of the concept of sensibility and of\nappearance, which renders the entire theory of them useless and empty.\n(A43/B60) \nKant wishes to oppose this Leibnizian attitude toward\nsensibility—which he goes on to label an “entirely unjust\nperspective” (A44/B62)—in a general but thoroughgoing way\nin the Aesthetic and elsewhere in the Critique. In the\nAmphiboly, for instance, he complains that Leibniz “left nothing\nfor the senses but the contemptible job of confusing and upsetting the\nrepresentations” of the understanding (A276/B332). Thus Kant\ndoes not merely think that we have a non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representation of space. He thinks—if we borrow\nLeibnizian terminology—that our clear and distinct\nrepresentation of space is singular and immediate. For Kant, intuition\ncan be a genuine source of clear and distinct representations. \nIf we return to Kant’s fundamental conception of representation,\naccording to which sensation is a representation of the subject’s\nstate, and intuition is an “objective” representation, we\nmight characterize Kant’s critical attitude toward the Leibnizians as\nfollows: they conflate intuition with sensation, or construe intuition\nas a kind of sensation. The Leibnizians fail to recognize that\nintuition is a kind of objective representation, rather than a merely\nconfused representation, one that is confused because it actually\nrepresents a state of the subject while purporting to represent\nobjects. According to Kant’s Leibniz, when I have a red book\nin front of me, and then have a sensation of redness, my senses\nrepresent the book as having a property that is similar to my\nsensation, when in fact it bears a distinct property (say, a surface\ntexture of some kind). This may be the right view of the\nsensation of secondary qualities—the Leibnizian error lies\ninstead in assimilating all cases of perception to this kind of case,\nand thereby concluding that perception presents us only with confused\nideas. If we rigorously distinguish sensation from intuition à\nla Kant, then we open the possibility of objective representations\nthat are akin to perceptions. We do not have a sensation of\nan infinite Euclidean magnitude (!), but we do have a singular and\nimmediate representation of it. The Leibnizians lack room for this\noption. \nKant focuses most of his critical gaze in the Aesthetic on Leibniz and\nthe Leibnizians. This may reflect the fact that Leibniz held, as we\nhave seen, well-developed views concerning space and time and their\nrepresentation. Newton did not hold extensive views about the\nrepresentation of space and time (although he had a minimal\nperspective on such matters). It may also reflect the fact that Kant\nheld various broadly “Leibnizian” positions throughout the\npre-critical period, breaking rather substantively with Leibniz in the\nInaugural Dissertation of 1770. But this is not to say that Kant\nfocused exclusively on Leibniz and his followers in the Aesthetic. He\nalso presents two broad sorts of criticism of the Newtonian position.\nFirst, he criticizes the Newtonians for holding a transcendental\nrealist position concerning space and time—his arguments against\ntranscendental realism presumably hold, if they are successful,\nagainst both the Leibnizian “inherence” view and the\nNewtonian “subsistence” view of space and time. Second, he\ncontends that their perspective, unlike Leibniz’s, is marred by a set\nof serious metaphysical problems. When discussing the Newtonian\nposition, Kant often emphasizes those problems. In §7 of the\nAesthetic (in the B edition of 1787), Kant describes the\ntranscendental idealist conception of space and time, and then\ncharacterizes the relevant contrast class: \nKant contends that the Newtonians conceive of space as a kind of\nquasi-object. He seems to return here to the classical discussion of\nthe ontology of space mentioned at the outset of this entry. He\nemphasizes that on the Newtonian view, space and time are akin to\nsubstances—in that they are independent of all objects and\nrelations, on the one hand, and independent of the mind (and of\nintuition), on the other—and yet lack causal relations. They are\nalso imperceptible, and certainly in the case of space, infinite. Thus\nfor Kant, the Newtonians regard space as an infinite substance-like\nentity that is imperceptible and causally inert, a view that Kant\nregards as absurd on general metaphysical grounds. Numerous\nphilosophers throughout the eighteenth century, from Leibniz to\nBerkeley to Madame Du Châtelet, concurred. Kant adds that the\nNewtonian view seems to conflict with what he calls “the\nprinciples of experience” (see Shabel 2005, 46-7). Perhaps the\nidea behind this second criticism can be discerned from Kant’s\ncomments elsewhere in the Critique and in the\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science—in those\ntexts, Kant notes that absolute space is not an object of possible\nexperience and that one cannot prove its existence by appealing to\n experience.[22]\n In this way, Kant’s criticisms of the Newtonian view seem to rest on\nvery general metaphysical and epistemic considerations—they seem\nto be largely divorced from the sort of specific views of intuition\nand of representation that played a substantial role in Kant’s\ncriticisms of Leibniz. \nTranscendental idealism is obviously too complex to clarify simply by\ndiscussing Kant’s views of space and time. A full discussion of it\nwould have to range over his critical writings in metaphysics,\naesthetics, teleology, and ethics. But as we have seen, Kant himself\nindicates in the Transcendental Aesthetic that transcendental idealism\nis closely related to his conception of space and time, and so some\nclarity concerning Kant’s overarching philosophical position can be\nachieved in the context of this entry. The modus operandi, as\nabove, will be to probe Kant’s own discussions of the views of space\nand time articulated by his predecessors in order to clarify his own\nposition. In particular, Kant’s remarks concerning Berkeley are\nespecially helpful in this context, in addition to his remarks on\nLeibniz and Newton. \nWe have seen above that from Kant’s point of view, both Leibniz and\nNewton—and perhaps some of their followers—defend versions\nof “transcendental realism.” This is due to their support\nof the view—or perhaps commitment to the view (on other\ngrounds)—that space and time are independent of intuition in\nsome sense. They may also be adherents of this realist position on the\ngrounds that they do not articulate the view Kant defends in the\nMetaphysical Exposition, viz. that we have a non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representation of space and time. But what does it mean for\nKant to say that space and time are somehow dependent on intuition?\nOne way of achieving some clarity in this domain is to fill out what\nKant regards as the relevant conceptual landscape by looking to his\ncharacterization of another idealist position, that of Berkeley (as he\nunderstands him). So suppose that space is not a property of objects\nindependent of intuition in any sense—it does not even\nsupervene on properties of objects that are independent of\nintuition (recall that for Leibniz, space supervenes on the monadic\norder because objects and relations supervene on that order). On the\nview I want to consider, space does not supervene on properties of\nobjects that are independent of intuition because there are no such\nproperties. Suppose that space is indeed dependent on intuition, but\non empirical intuition. I take this to represent one\npossible construal of Berkeley’s phrase, esse est\npercipii. This consideration suggests that, prima facie,\nKant should not interpret Berkeley as a transcendental realist. And if\nthat is right, what prevents Berkeley from being understood as a\ntranscendental idealist? Correlatively, what prevents one from\nunderstanding transcendental idealism as some kind of Berkeleyan\nidealism about space and time? These sorts of question can help to\nclarify what Kant understands by transcendental idealism, for\nKant seems to view Berkeley as a fellow idealist, but one who does not\ndefend a transcendental variety of this position. \nIronically, the view that Kant is—perhaps despite his fervent\ndenials—an idealist of the Berkeleyan variety arose in one of\nthe first critical appraisals of the Critique, the so-called\nGarve-Feder review of\n 1782.[23]In\n the Prolegomena, written directly after the review, Kant is\nconcerned to distinguish his version of idealism from Berkeley’s; one\npoint he emphasizes hinges on their differing conceptions of space. In\nconsidering the question of why his early critics Garve and Feder\ninterpreted him as a Berkeleyan idealist, he writes: \nSo from Kant’s point of view, Berkeley rejects transcendental\nrealism—he rejects the notion that space is a thing in itself,\nor a property of things in\n themselves.[24]\n He presumably also rejects the idea that space and time are\nindependent of intuition. In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant admits\nthat one cannot “blame” Berkeley for falling into a\nradical version of idealism in an attempt to avoid the\n“absurdities” of transcendental realism, absurdities into\nwhich Kant takes the Newtonians to have fallen (B70-1)—these are\nthe very absurdities discussed above in the section on Kant’s\ncriticisms of Newton. Kant seems to be suggesting with this remark\nthat Berkeley—who of course was a fierce critic of the Newtonian\nidea of absolute or mathematical space—defended the view that\nspace and time are dependent on intuition, that they are not\n“transcendentally real,” in order to evade the Newtonian\nconception. And just before the Refutation of Idealism, Kant\nemphasizes again that Berkeley avoids transcendental realism\n(B274—see Wilson 1999, 276-93). From Kant’s point of view,\nBerkeley correctly avoids transcendental realism, but does so by\nfalsely claiming that space is dependent on empirical\nintuition. This is a mistake, as we have seen, because Kant thinks\nthat the representation of space cannot be empirical. It is precisely\nthis sort of view, in turn, that Kant cites when concluding that space\nmust be dependent on a priori intuition in some sense. So\nperhaps transcendental idealism is transcendental—and\nnot merely idealist—because it contains the view that\nour representation of space is non-empirical as an essential\ncomponent. \nWhat, then, of Kant’s famous contention that endorsing transcendental\nrealism commits one to empirical idealism (A368-9)? It would seem,\nprima facie, that Berkeley ought to be committed to empirical\nidealism, and yet Kant interprets him as rejecting\ntranscendental realism. I take it that Berkeley avoids transcendental\nrealism, and therefore merely empirical idealism, by defending a more\nradical dogmatic idealism (B274-5). According to that view,\nthere are no objects or properties that are independent of\n intuition.[25]\n In contrast, Kant interprets the Leibnizians as thinking both that\nthe order of substances is transcendentally real, i.e. independent of\nintuition per se, and also as thinking that well-founded\nphenomena and their relations are not real—the latter emerge\nfrom our misrepresentation of the underlying non-relational monadic\nreality. The phenomenal world of objects bearing spatial and causal\nrelations is merely ideal. It is perhaps in that sense that\nthe Leibnizians are committed to empirical\n idealism.[26] \nThe reading (provided above) of what makes transcendental idealism\ntranscendental hints at a further way of clarifying Kant’s\noverarching position. His view is not just that space is not a\nproperty of things independent of intuition per se, but that\nspace is not a property of things independent of a priori\nintuition. That distinguishes Kant’s conception from the idealism of a\nthinker like Berkeley, for Kant denies, as we have seen, the view that\nspace is somehow dependent upon empirical intuition. This\npoint, in turn, highlights a significant parallel between the first\nand second arguments of the Metaphysical Exposition and its third and\nfourth arguments. Just as the latter two arguments allow Kant to\ndistinguish his idealism from Leibniz’s based on the notion that the\nrepresentation of space is non-conceptual, the former two arguments\nallow him to distinguish his idealism from Berkeley’s based on the\nnotion that the representation of space is non-empirical. Hence the\n“dogmatic” idealism of Berkeley and the\n“empirical” idealism of Leibniz are each ruled out by\nconsidering the content and origin of the representation of space.\nThat, at least, would seem to form part of Kant’s intention in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, especially in the Metaphysical Exposition.\nThis indicates that Berkeleyan and Leibnizian idealist views can be\nconstrued as conceptions of the relation between space and intuition.\nWhereas Berkeley takes space to be dependent on empirical\nintuition, Leibniz takes it to be independent of intuition per\nse. This illuminates Kant’s concern in the Transcendental\nAesthetic with our representation of space: considering that\nrepresentation in particular allows Kant to tackle other conceptions\nof the relation between space and intuition. \nFinally, transcendental idealism, in so far as it concerns space and\ntime, has the following essential component: we have a non-empirical,\nsingular, immediate representation of space. Part of Kant’s innovation\nis to introduce into the philosophical lexicon the very idea that we\ncan have non-empirical intuition. It is improbable that we can\ninterpret this idea correctly unless we remind ourselves that Kant\nrigorously distinguishes between sensation and intuition. That\ndistinction, in turn, forms a crucial component in Kant’s extensive\nrejection of the Leibnizian doctrine of perception. It is only with\nthe rejection of that doctrine that we can understand Kant’s break\nwith the Leibnizian view of space and time in the right light.","contact.mail":"janiak@duke.edu","contact.domain":"duke.edu"}]
