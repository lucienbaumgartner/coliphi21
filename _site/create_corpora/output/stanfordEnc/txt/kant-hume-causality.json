Moreover, because\nHume’s famous discussion of causality and induction is equally\ncentral to his philosophy, understanding the relationship between the\ntwo philosophers on this issue is crucial for a proper understanding\nof modern philosophy more generally. Yet ever since Kant offered his\nresponse to Hume the topic has been subject to intense controversy.\nThere is no consensus, of course, over whether Kant’s response\nsucceeds, but there is no more consensus about what this response is\nsupposed to be. There has been sharp disagreement concerning\nKant’s conception of causality, as well as Hume’s, and,\naccordingly, there has also been controversy over whether the two\nconceptions really significantly differ. There has even been\ndisagreement concerning whether Hume’s conception of causality\nand induction is skeptical at all. We shall not discuss these\ncontroversies in detail; rather, we shall concentrate on presenting\none particular perspective on this very complicated set of issues. We\nshall clearly indicate, however, where especially controversial points\nof interpretation arise and briefly describe some of the main\nalternatives. (Most of this discussion will be confined to footnotes,\nwhere we shall also present further, more specialized details.)\n\nIn the Preface to the Prolegomena Kant considers the supposed\nscience of metaphysics. He states that “no event has occurred\nthat could have been more decisive for the fate of this science than\nthe attack made upon it by David Hume” and goes on to say that\n“Hume proceeded primarily from a single but important concept of\nmetaphysics, namely, that of the connection of cause and\neffect” (4, 257; 7; see the Bibliography for our method of\ncitation). Over the next few pages Kant defends the importance of\nHume’s “attack” on metaphysics against common-sense\nopponents such as Thomas Reid, James Oswald, James Beattie, and Joseph\nPriestley (all of whom, according to Kant, missed the point of\nHume’s problem), and Kant then famously writes (4, 260; 10):\n \nI freely admit that it was the remembrance of David Hume which, many\nyears ago, first interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my\ninvestigations in the field of speculative philosophy a completely\ndifferent direction.  \nThus, it was Hume’s “attack” on metaphysics (and, in\nparticular, on the concept of cause and effect) which first provoked\nKant himself to undertake a fundamental reconsideration of this\n(supposed) science. \nLater, in §§ 27–30 of the Prolegomena, Kant\nreturns to Hume’s problem and presents his own solution. Kant\nbegins, in § 27, by stating that “here is now the place to\nremove the Humean doubt from the ground up” (4, 310; 63); and he\ncontinues, in § 29, by proposing  \nto make a trial with Hume’s problematic concept (his\ncrux metaphysicorum), namely the concept of cause.\n(4, 312; 65)  \nKant concludes, in § 30, by stating that we are now in possession\nof “a complete solution of the Humean problem” (4, 313;\n66)—which, Kant adds,  \nrescues the a priori origin of the pure concepts of the understanding\nand the validity of the general laws of nature as laws of the\nunderstanding, in such a way that their use is limited only to\nexperience, because their possibility has its ground merely in the\nrelation of the understanding to experience, however, not in such a\nway that they are derived from experience, but that experience is\nderived from them, a completely reversed kind of connection which\nnever occurred to Hume. (ibid.)  \nThus, Kant’s “complete solution of the Humean\nproblem” directly involves him with his whole revolutionary\ntheory of the constitution of experience by the a priori concepts and\nprinciples of the understanding—and with his revolutionary\nconception of synthetic a priori judgments. \nIndeed, when Kant first introduces Hume’s problem in the Preface\nto the Prolegomena he already indicates that the problem is\nactually much more general, extending to all of the categories of the\nunderstanding (4, 260; 10):  \nI thus first tried whether Hume’s objection might not be\nrepresented generally, and I soon found that the concept of the\nconnection of cause and effect is far from being the only one by which\nthe understanding thinks connections of things a priori; rather,\nmetaphysics consists wholly and completely of them. I sought to secure\ntheir number, and since this succeeded as desired, namely, from a\nsingle principle, I then proceeded to the deduction of these concepts,\non the basis of which I was now assured that they are not derived from\nexperience, as Hume had feared, but have sprung from the pure\nunderstanding.  \nMoreover, Kant soon explains, in § 5, how this more general\nproblem (common to all the categories and principles of the\nunderstanding) is to be formulated: “How is cognition from pure\nreason possible?” (4, 275; 27), or, more specifically,\n“How are synthetic a priori propositions possible?” (4,\n276; 28). \nIn the Introduction to the second (B) edition of the Critique of\nPure Reason (1787), Kant follows the Prolegomena in\nformulating what he here calls “the general problem of pure\nreason” (B19): “How are synthetic a priori judgments\npossible?” And, as in the Prolegomena, Kant insists\nthat the possibility of metaphysics as a science entirely depends on\nthis problem (ibid.):  \nThat metaphysics until now has remained in such a wavering state of\nuncertainty and contradictions is to be ascribed solely to the fact\nthat this problem, and perhaps even the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic judgments, was not thought of\nearlier. Metaphysics stands or falls with the solution of this\nproblem, or on a satisfactory proof that the possibility it requires\nto be explained does not in fact obtain.  \nKant then immediately refers to “David Hume, who, among all\nphilosophers, came closest to this problem”; and he suggests,\nonce again, that Hume failed to perceive the solution because he did\nnot conceive the problem in its  \n[full] generality, but rather stopped with the synthetic proposition\nof the connection of the effect with the cause (principium\ncausalitatis). (ibid.) \nIt is only in the second edition of the Critique that Kant\ngives such a prominent place to Hume and his “objection”\nto causality, serving to introduce what Kant now calls “the\ngeneral problem of pure reason”. By contrast, the name of Hume\ndoes not appear in either the Introduction or the Transcendental\nAnalytic in the first (A) edition (1781): it appears only in the\nTranscendental Doctrine of Method at the very end of the book, in a\ndiscussion of “skepticism” versus “dogmatism”\nin metaphysics (where Hume’s skepticism about causation, in\nparticular, is finally explicitly discussed). This is not to say, of\ncourse, that implicit references to Hume are not found earlier in the\ntext of the first edition. Thus, for example, in a preliminary section\nto the Transcendental Deduction Kant illustrates the need for such a\ndeduction with the concept of cause, and in both editions remarks\n(A91/B124):  \nAppearances certainly provide cases from which a rule is possible in\naccordance with which something usually happens, but never that the\nsuccession is necessary; therefore, a dignity pertains to the\nsynthesis of cause and effect that cannot be empirically expressed at\nall, namely, that the effect does not merely follow upon the cause but\nis posited through it and follows from it.  \nBut it is only in the second edition that Kant then goes on to mention\n“David Hume” explicitly, as one who attempted to derive\nthe pure concepts of the understanding from experience (B127):  \nnamely, from a subjective necessity arising from frequent association\nin experience—i.e., from custom—which is\nsubsequently falsely taken for objective.  \nThis striking difference between the two editions clearly reflects the\nimportance of the intervening appearance of the\nProlegomena. \nGiven the crucial importance of the Prolegomena in this\nrespect, it is natural to return to Kant’s famous remarks in the\nPreface to that work, where, as we have seen, Kant says that  \nit was the remembrance of David Hume which, many years ago, first\ninterrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my investigations in the\nfield of speculative philosophy a completely different direction.  \nIt is natural to wonder, in particular, about the precise years to\nwhich Kant is referring and the specific events in his intellectual\ndevelopment he has in mind. Here, however, we now enter controversial\nterrain, where there are basically two competing\nalternatives—both of which reflect the circumstance that Kant\ncould read Hume only in German translation. \nKant might be referring, on the one hand, to the late 1750s to mid\n1760s. A translation of Hume’s Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (originally published in 1748) appeared in 1755 and\nwas widely read in Germany. Kant had almost certainly read this\ntranslation by the mid 1760s, by which time he himself expressed\ndoubts about whether causal connections could be known by reason alone\nand even suggested that they were knowable only by experience. Or, on\nthe other hand, Kant might be referring to the mid 1770s. After the\nInaugural Dissertation appeared in 1770, Kant published\nnothing more until the first edition of the Critique in 1781.\nMeanwhile, a German translation of Beattie’s Essay on the\nNature and Immutability of Truth (originally published in 1770)\nappeared in 1772, where, in particular, Beattie quoted extensively\nfrom Book 1 of Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature\n(originally published in 1739). Thus, in the famous “dogmatic\nslumber” passage, Kant might be referring either to the mid\n1760s, when he then had a “remembrance” of reading the\ntranslation of Hume’s Enquiry, or to the mid 1770s,\nwhen he then had a “remembrance” of reading translations\nfrom the\n Treatise.[1] \nWe prefer the first alternative. From this point of view, the decisive\nevent to which Kant is referring is his reading of Hume’s\nEnquiry (in translation) during the late 1750s to mid 1760s,\nand this event, we believe, is clearly reflected in two important\nwritings of the mid 1760s: the Attempt to Introduce the Concept of\nNegative Magnitudes into Philosophy (1763) and Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer Explained by Dreams of Metaphysics (1766). \nIn the first (1763) essay Kant introduces the distinction between\n“logical grounds” and “real grounds”, both of\nwhich indicate a relationship between a “ground” (cause or\nreason) and a “consequent” (following from this ground).\nKant explains his problem as follows (2, 202; 239): \nI understand very well how a consequent may be posited through a\nground in accordance with the rule of identity, because it is found to\nbe contained in [the ground] by the analysis of concepts. …\n[A]nd I can clearly comprehend this connection of the ground with the\nconsequent, because the consequent is actually identical with part of\nthe concept of the ground …. However, how something may flow\nfrom another, but not in accordance with the rule of identity, is\nsomething that I would very much like to have made clear to me. I call\nthe first kind of ground a logical ground, because its relation to the\nconsequent can be logically comprehended in accordance with the rule\nof identity, but I call the second kind of ground a real ground,\nbecause this relation indeed belongs to my true concepts, but the\nmanner of this [relation] can in no way be estimated. With respect to\nsuch a real ground and its relation to the consequent, I pose my\nquestion in this simple form: how can I understand the circumstance\nthat, because something is, something else is to be? A\nlogical consequent is only posited because it is identical with the\nground. \nThe fundamental problem with the relationship between a real ground\nand its consequent, therefore, is that the consequent is not\nidentical with either the ground or a part of this concept—i.e.,\nit is not “contained in [the ground] by the analysis of\nconcepts”. \nThus, using his well-known later terminology (from the\nCritique and the Prolegomena), Kant is here saying\nthat, in the case of a real ground, the relationship between the\nconcept of the consequent (e.g., an effect) and the concept of the\nground (e.g., a cause) is not one of containment, and the judgment\nthat the former follows from the latter is therefore not\nanalytic. Moreover, although Kant does not explicitly refer\nto Hume in the essay on Negative Magnitudes, he proceeds to\nillustrate his problem with an example (among others) of the causal\nconnection in the communication of motion by impact (2, 202; 240):\n \nA body A is in motion, another B is at rest in the\nstraight line [of this motion]. The motion of A is something,\nthat of B is something else, and, nevertheless, the latter is\nposited through the former.  \nHume famously uses this example (among others) in the Enquiry\nto illustrate his thesis that cause and effect are entirely distinct\nevents, where the idea of the latter is in no way contained in the\nidea of the former (EHU 4.9; SBN 29):  \nThe mind can never possibly find the effect in the supposed cause, by\nthe most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the effect is totally\ndifferent from the cause, and consequently can never be discovered in\nit. Motion in the second billiard-ball is a quite distinct event from\nmotion in the first; nor is there anything in the one to suggest the\nsmallest hint of the other.  \nA few lines later Hume describes this example as follows (EHU 4.10;\nSBN 29):  \nWhen I see, for instance, a billiard-ball moving in a straight line\ntowards another; even suppose motion in the second ball should by\naccident be suggested to me, as the result of their contact or\nimpulse; may I not conceive, that a hundred different events might as\nwell follow from the cause? … All these suppositions are\nconsistent and conceivable. \nIn Kant’s second essay from this period, Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer (1766), he goes further: he suggests a Humean\nsolution to the problem he had posed, but did not solve, in the essay\non Negative Magnitudes. Kant suggests, more specifically,\nthat the relation between a real ground and its consequent can only be\ngiven by experience (2, 370; 356): \nIt is impossible ever to comprehend through reason how something could\nbe a cause or have a force, rather these relations must be taken\nsolely from experience. For the rule of our reason extends only to\ncomparison in accordance with identity and\ncontradiction. But, in so far as something is a cause, then,\nthrough something, something else is posited, and\nthere is thus no connection in virtue of agreement to be\nfound—just as no contradiction will ever arise if I wish to view\nthe former not as a cause, because there is no contradiction [in the\nsupposition that] if something is posited, something else is\ncancelled. Therefore, if they are not derived from experience, the\nfundamental concepts of things as causes, of forces and activities,\nare completely arbitrary and can neither be proved nor refuted. \nThis passage seems clearly to recall the main ideas in section 4, part\n1 of Hume’s Enquiry. After distinguishing between\n“relations of ideas” and “matters of fact”,\nand asserting that the former “are discoverable by the mere\noperation of thought” (EHU 4.1; SBN 25), Hume continues (EHU\n4.2; SBN 25):  \nMatters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not\nascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth,\nhowever great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of\nevery matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a\ncontradiction ….  \nHume then explains that: “all reasonings concerning matters of\nfact seem to be founded on the relation of Cause and\nEffect” (EHU 4.4; SBN 26) and adds (EHU 4.6; SBN 27):  \nI shall venture to affirm, as a general proposition, which admits of\nno exception, that the knowledge of this relation is not, in any\ninstance, attained by reasonings a priori; but arises\nentirely from experience, when we find that any particular objects are\nconstantly conjoined with each other.  \nFinally (EHU 4.10; SBN 29):  \nAnd as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect, in\nall natural operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience;\nso must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause\nand effect, which binds them together, and renders it impossible that\nany other effect could result from the operation of that cause.  \nThus, although Kant does not explicitly mention Hume in Dreams of\na Spirit-Seer, the parallels with Hume’s Enquiry\nare striking\n indeed.[2] \nKant does not endorse a Humean solution to the problem of the relation\nbetween cause and effect in the critical period (beginning with the\nfirst edition of the Critique in 1781): he does not (as he\nhad in Dreams of a Spirit-Seer) claim that this relation is\nderived from experience. Instead (as we have seen) Kant takes\nHume’s problem of causality to be centrally implicated in the\nradically new problem of synthetic a priori judgments. Yet the latter\nproblem, in turn, clearly has its origin in Kant’s earlier\ndiscussion (in the essay on Negative Magnitudes and\nDreams of a Spirit-Seer) of the apparently mysterious\nconnection between a real ground (or cause) and its consequent (or\neffect). Just as Kant had earlier emphasized (in these pre-critical\nworks) that the consequent of a real ground is not contained in it,\nand thus does not result by “the analysis of concepts”,\nKant now (in the critical period) maintains that the concept of the\neffect cannot be contained in the concept of the cause and,\naccordingly, that a judgment relating the two cannot be analytic. Such\na judgment, in Kant’s critical terminology, must now be\nsynthetic—it is a judgment in which “the connection of the\npredicate with the subject … is thought without\nidentity”, where  \na predicate is added to the concept of the subject which is by no\nmeans thought in it, and which could not have been extracted from it\nby any analysis. (A7/B10–11)  \nThe crucial point about a synthetic a priori judgment,\nhowever, is that, although it is certainly not (as a priori) derived\nfrom experience, it nonetheless extends our knowledge beyond merely\nanalytic judgments. \nIt therefore becomes clear why, in the Introduction to the second\nedition of the Critique, Kant says of the crucial problem of\nsynthetic a priori judgments that  \nthis problem, and perhaps even the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic judgments, was not thought of\nearlier,  \nand then explicitly names “David Hume, who, among all\nphilosophers, came closest to this problem” (B19). It also\nbecomes clear why, in the Preface to the Prolegomena, Kant\nexplains Hume’s problem as follows (4, 257; 7): \nHume proceeded primarily from a single but important concept of\nmetaphysics, namely, that of the connection of cause and\neffect … , and he challenged reason, which here pretends\nto have generated this concept in her womb, to give him an account of\nby what right she thinks that something could be so constituted that,\nif it is posited, something else must necessarily also be posited\nthereby; for this is what the concept of cause says. He proved\nindisputably that it is completely impossible for reason to think such\na connection a priori and from concepts [alone] (for this [connection]\ncontains necessity); but it can in no way be comprehended how, because\nsomething is, something else must necessarily also be, and how,\ntherefore, the concept of such a connection could be introduced a\npriori. \nThus here, in the Prolegomena, Kant describes what he calls\nHume’s “challenge” to reason concerning\n“the connection of cause and effect” in precisely\nthe same terms that he had himself earlier used, in the 1763 essay on\nNegative Magnitudes and the 1766 Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer, to pose a fundamental problem about the relation of\na real ground (as opposed to a logical ground) to its consequent. \nWhat is most important, however, is the official solution to\nHume’s problem that Kant presents in § 29 of the\nProlegomena. This solution depends on the distinction between\n“judgments of perception” and “judgments of\nexperience” which Kant has extensively discussed in the\npreceding sections. In § 18 Kant introduces the distinction as\nfollows (4, 298; 51): \nEmpirical judgments, in so far as they have objective\nvalidity, are judgments of experience; they,\nhowever, in so far as they are only subjectively valid, I\ncall mere judgments of perception. … All of\nour judgments are at first mere judgments of perception: they are\nvalid merely for us, i.e., for our subject, and only afterwards do we\ngive them a new relation, namely to an object, and we intend that [the\njudgment] is supposed to be also valid for us at all times and\nprecisely so for everyone else; for, if a judgment agrees with an\nobject, then all judgments about the same object must also agree among\none another, and thus the objective validity of the judgment of\nexperience signifies nothing else but its necessary universal\nvalidity. \nThen, in § 22, Kant emphasizes that the pure concepts of the\nunderstanding or categories function precisely to convert mere\n(subjective) perceptions into objective experience by effecting a\n“necessary unification” of them (4, 305; 58):\n \nTherefore, the pure concepts of the understanding are those concepts\nunder which all perceptions must first be subsumed before they can\nserve as judgments of experience, in which the synthetic unity of\nperceptions is represented as necessary and universally\n valid.[3] \nHere is how Kant formulates his solution in § 29 (4, 312;\n65): \nIn order to make a trial with Hume’s problematic\nconcept (his crux metaphysicorum), namely the\nconcept of cause, first, there is given to me a priori, by means of\nlogic, the form of a conditional judgment in general, namely, to use a\ngiven cognition as ground and the other as consequent. It is possible,\nhowever, that a rule of relation is found in perception which says\nthat a given appearance is constantly followed by another (but not\nconversely); and this is a case for me to employ the hypothetical\njudgment and, e.g., to say: if a body is illuminated sufficiently long\nby the sun, then it becomes warm. Here, there is certainly no\nnecessity of connection as yet, and thus [not] the concept of cause.\nHowever, I continue and say that, if the above proposition, which is\nmerely a subjective connection of perceptions, is to be a judgment of\nexperience, then it must be viewed as necessary and universally valid.\nBut such a proposition would be: the sun is through its light the\ncause of heat. The above empirical rule is now viewed as a\nlaw—and, in fact, not as valid merely of appearances, but\n[valid] of them on behalf of a possible experience, which requires\ncompletely and thus necessarily valid rules. \nAll the elements from Kant’s earlier discussion of causality in\nthe essays on Negative Magnitudes and Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer seem to be present here. Kant begins with the purely\nlogical relation between ground and consequent. Since, in the case of\nthe concept of cause, we are dealing with what Kant had earlier called\na real ground, Kant holds that we need a synthetic rather\nthan merely analytic connection between the two. The most obvious\nthought, which Hume had defended in the Enquiry (and,\napparently following Hume, Kant himself had defended in Dreams of\na Spirit-Seer) is that “experience” (in the Humean\nsense) is the basis for this connection in so far as one perception is\nfound to be “constantly conjoined” with another. Now,\nhowever, in the critical period, Kant introduces a revolutionary new\nconcept of “experience” which is explicitly opposed to\nmere constant conjunctions among perceptions in being “necessary\nand universally valid”—in particular, “experience is\npossible only by means of the representation of a necessary connection\nof perceptions” (B218). \nIn Kant’s example from § 29 of the Prolegomena,\nthen, we begin from a mere subjective “empirical rule”:\nthat the perception of an illuminated stone is constantly followed by\nthe perception of heat; and we then convert this “empirical\nrule” into an objective law according to which the very same\nrelationship is now viewed as “necessary and universally\nvalid”. This transformation is effected by the addition of the a\npriori concept of causality: “the sun is through its light the\ncause of heat”. It is in precisely this way, more generally,\nthat the categories or pure concepts of the understanding relate to\nexperience:  \nnot in such a way that they are derived from experience, but that\nexperience is derived from them, a completely reversed kind of\nconnection which never occurred to Hume. (§ 30: 4, 313; 66) \nWe shall devote the rest of this article to clarifying Kant’s\nsolution and its relationship with Hume’s conception of\ncausation. For now, we simply note an important difficulty Kant\nhimself raises in the Prolegomena. Whereas the concept of\ncausality is, for Kant, clearly a priori, he does not think that\nparticular causal laws relating specific causes with specific effects\nare all synthetic a priori—and, if they are not a priori, how\ncan they be necessary? Indeed, Kant illustrates this difficulty, in a\nfootnote to § 22, with his own example of the sun warming a stone\n(4, 305; 58): \nBut how does this proposition, that judgments of experience are\nsupposed to contain necessity in the synthesis of perceptions, agree\nwith my proposition, urged many times above, that experience, as a\nposteriori cognition, can yield only contingent judgments? If I say\nthat experience teaches me something, I always mean only the\nperception that lies within in it, e.g., that heat always follows the\nillumination of the stone by the sun. That this heating results\nnecessarily from the illumination by the sun is in fact contained in\nthe judgment of experience (in virtue of the concept of cause); but I\ndo not learn this from experience, rather, conversely, experience is\nfirst generated through this addition of the concept of the\nunderstanding (of cause) to the perception. \nIn other words, experience in the Humean sense teaches me that heat\nalways (i.e., constantly) follows the illumination of the stone by the\nsun; experience in the Kantian sense then adds that:  \nthe succession is necessary; … the effect does not\nmerely follow upon the cause but is posited through it and\nfollows from it. (A91/B124)  \nBut what exactly does this mean? \nKant formulates a crucial distinction between “strict” and\n“comparative” universality in § II of the\nIntroduction to the second edition of the Critique\n(B3–4): \nExperience never gives its judgments true or strict, but merely\nassumed or comparative universality (through induction), so\nthat, properly speaking, it must be formulated: so far as we have\nobserved until now, no exception has been found to this or that rule.\nIf, therefore, a judgment is thought with strict universality, i.e.,\nso that no exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not\nderived from experience, but is valid absolutely a priori. Empirical\nuniversality is thus only an arbitrary augmentation of validity from\nthat which is valid in most cases to that which is valid in\nall—as, e.g., in the proposition: all bodies are heavy. By\ncontrast, where strict universality essentially belongs to a judgment,\nthis [universality] indicates a special source of cognition for [the\njudgment], namely a faculty of a priori cognition. Necessity and\nstrict universality are thus secure criteria of an a priori cognition,\nand also inseparably belong together. \nKant then explicitly links this distinction to Hume’s discussion\nof causality in the following paragraph (B5):  \nThe very concept of cause so obviously contains the concept of a\nnecessity of the connection with an effect and a strict universality\nof the rule, that the concept [of cause] would be entirely lost if one\npretended to derive it, as Hume did, from a frequent association of\nthat which happens with that which precedes, and [from] a thereby\narising custom (thus a merely subjective necessity) of connecting\n representations.[4] \nMoreover, in the second edition (as we have seen) Kant also goes on to\nname Hume explicitly, as one who attempted to derive the concept of\ncausality  \nfrom a subjective necessity arising from frequent association in\nexperience—i.e., from custom—which is\nsubsequently falsely taken for objective. (B127)  \nIt appears, therefore, that Kant’s discussion, in § 29 of\nthe Prolegomena, of how, by the addition of the concept of\ncause, we convert a mere subjective “empirical rule” into\nan objective law (which is “necessary and universally\nvalid”), is not only indebted to Hume for the insight that the\nconnection between cause and effect is synthetic rather than analytic,\nit is also indebted to Hume’s discussions of the problem of\ninduction (in section 4, part 2 of the Enquiry) and of the\nidea of necessary connection (in section 7). Kant agrees with Hume\nthat the idea of necessary connection is in fact an essential\ningredient in our idea of the relation between cause and effect; Kant\nagrees, in addition, that, if all we had to go on were a purely\ninductive inference from observed constant conjunctions, the inference\nfrom comparative to strict universality would not be legitimate, and\nthe presumed necessary connection arising in this way (i.e., from\ncustom) would be merely subjective. \nSection 4 of the Enquiry is entitled “Sceptical Doubts\nConcerning the Operations of the Understanding”. In part 1 of\nthis section (as we have already seen) Hume maintains that the idea of\nthe effect is never contained in the idea of the cause (in\nKant’s terminology, the relation is not analytic), and thus,\naccording to Hume, it is never knowable a priori. We therefore need\nexperience in the Humean sense in order to make any causal\nclaims—that is, the observation of an event of one type\nA constantly followed by an event of another type B.\nOtherwise (as we have also seen) any event could follow any other (EHU\n4.10; SBN 29):  \nAnd as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect, in\nall natural operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience;\nso must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause\nand effect, which binds them together, and renders it impossible that\nany other effect could result from the operation of that cause.  \nNote that Hume is here supposing that, in our idea of the relation\nbetween cause and effect, the “tye or connexion … which\nbinds them together” is necessary (“it is impossible that\nany other effect could result”). In the corresponding section of\nthe Treatise, Book 1, part 3, section 2 (“Of\nprobability; and of the idea of cause and effect”), Hume makes\nthis completely explicit (T 1.3.2.11; SBN 77):  \nShall we then rest contented with these two relations of contiguity\nand succession, as affording a compleat idea of causation? By no\nmeans. An object may be continuous and prior to another, without being\nconsider’d as its cause. There is a NECESSARY CONNEXION to be\ntaken into consideration; and that relation is of much greater\nimportance, than any of the other two above-mention’d. \nIn the Enquiry, section 4, part 2, Hume presents his famous\nskeptical argument concerning causation and induction. Since we need\n“experience” (i.e., the observation of constant\nconjunctions) to make any causal claims, Hume now asks (EHU 4.14; SBN\n32): “What is the foundation of all conclusions from\nexperience?” The conclusion from an experience of constant\nconjunction is an inference to what has not yet been observed from\nwhat has already been observed, and Hume finds an unbridgeable gap\nbetween the premise (summarizing what we have observed so far) and the\n(not yet observed) conclusion of this inference (EHU 4.16; SBN 34):\n \nThese two propositions are far from being the same, I have found\nthat such an object has always been attended with such an effect,\nand I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance,\nsimilar, will be attended with similar effects.  \nHume concludes that this inference has no foundation in the\nunderstanding—that is, no foundation in what he calls\n “reasoning”.[5]\n How does Hume arrive at this position? \nAll our inductive inferences—our “conclusions from\nexperience”—are founded on the supposition that the course\nof nature is sufficiently uniform so that the future will be\nconformable to the past (EHU 4.21; SBN 37–38):  \nFor all inferences from experience suppose, as their foundation, that\nthe future will resemble the past …. If there be any suspicion,\nthat the course of nature may change, and that the past may be no rule\nfor the future, all experience becomes useless, and can give rise to\nno inference or conclusion.  \nTherefore, what Hume is now seeking, in turn, is the foundation in our\nreasoning for the supposition that nature is sufficiently uniform. \nSection 4, part 1 of the Enquiry distinguishes (as we have\nseen) between reasoning concerning relations of ideas and reasoning\nconcerning matters of fact and existence. Demonstrative reasoning\n(concerning relations of ideas) cannot establish the supposition in\nquestion,  \nsince it implies no contradiction, that the course of nature may\nchange, and that an object, seemingly like those which we have\nexperienced, may be attended with different or contrary effects. (EHU\n4.18; SBN 35)  \nMoreover, reasoning concerning matters of fact and existence cannot\nestablish it either, since such reasoning is always founded on the\nrelation of cause and effect, the very relation we are now attempting\nto found in reasoning (EHU 4.19; SBN 35–36):  \nWe have said, that all arguments concerning existence are founded on\nthe relation of cause and effect; that our knowledge of that relation\nis derived entirely from experience; and that all our experimental\nconclusions proceed upon the supposition, that the future will be\nconformable to the past. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this\nlast proposition by probable arguments, or arguments regarding\nexistence, must be evidently going in a circle, and taking that for\ngranted, which is the very point in\n question.[6] \nAlthough Hume has now shown that there is no foundation for the\nsupposition that nature is sufficiently uniform in reasoning or the\nunderstanding, he goes on, in the following section 5 of the\nEnquiry (“Skeptical Solution of these Doubts”),\nto insist that we are nonetheless always determined to proceed in\naccordance with this supposition. There is a natural basis or\n“principle” for all our arguments from experience, even if\nthere is no ultimate foundation in reasoning (EHU 5.4–5; SBN\n42–43): \nAnd though [one] should be convinced, that his understanding has no\npart in the operation, he would nonetheless continue in the same\ncourse of thinking. There is some other principle, which determines\nhim to form such a conclusion. This principle is CUSTOM or HABIT. For\nwherever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a\npropensity to renew the same act or operation, without being impelled\nby any reasoning or process of the understanding; we always say, that\nthis propensity is the effect of Custom. By employing that\nword, we pretend not to have given the ultimate reason of such a\npropensity. We only point out a principle of human nature, which is\nuniversally acknowledged, and which is well known by its\n effects.[7] \nIn section 7 of the Enquiry (“On the Idea of Necessary\nConnexion”), after rejecting the received views of causal\nnecessity, Hume explains that precisely this custom or habit also\nproduces our idea of necessary connection (EHU 7.28; SBN 75): \nIt appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connexion among events\narises from a number of similar instances which occur of the constant\nconjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by\nany one of these instances, surveyed in all possible lights and\npositions. But there is nothing in a number of instances, different\nfrom every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar;\nexcept only, that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is\ncarried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its\nusual attendant, and to believe that it will exist. This connexion,\ntherefore, which we feel in the mind, this customary\ntransition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant,\nis the sentiment or impression, from which we form the idea of power\nor necessary connexion. \nThus, the custom or habit to make the inductive inference not only\ngives rise to a new idea of not yet observed instances resembling the\ninstances we have already observed, it also produces a feeling of\ndetermination to make the very inductive inference in question. This\nfeeling of determination, in turn, gives rise to a further new idea,\nthe idea of necessary connexion, which has no resemblance whatsoever\nwith anything we have observed. It is derived from an\n“impression of reflection” (an internal feeling or\nsentiment), not from an “impression of sensation” (an\nobserved instance before the mind), and it is in precisely this sense,\nfor Hume, that the idea of necessary connection is merely subjective.\nHume emphasizes that this is a “discovery” both “new\nand extraordinary”, and that it is skeptical in character (EHU\n7.28–29; SBN 76):  \nNo conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than such as make\ndiscoveries concerning the weakness and narrow limits of human reason\nand capacity. And what stronger instance can be produced of the\nsurprising ignorance and weakness of the understanding, than the\npresent? For surely, if there be any relation among objects, which it\nimports to us to know perfectly, it is that of cause and effect. \nKant agrees with Hume that neither the relation of cause and effect\nnor the idea of necessary connection is given in our sensory\nperceptions; both, in an important sense, are contributed by our mind.\nFor Kant, however, the concepts of both causality and necessity arise\nfrom precisely the operations of our understanding—and, indeed,\nthey arise entirely a priori as pure concepts or categories of the\nunderstanding. It is in precisely this way that Kant thinks that he\nhas an answer to Hume’s skeptical problem of induction: the\nproblem, in Kant’s terms, of grounding the transition from\nmerely “comparative” to “strict universality”\n(A91–92/B123–124). Thus in § 29 of the\nProlegomena, as we have seen, Kant begins from a merely\nsubjective “empirical rule” of constant conjunction or\nassociation among our perceptions (of heat following illumination by\nthe sun), which is then transformed into a “necessary and\nuniversally valid law” by adding the a priori concept of\ncause. \nAt the end of our discussion in section 1 above we saw that there is a\nserious difficulty in understanding what Kant intends here—a\ndifficulty to which he himself explicitly calls attention. Kant does\nnot think that the particular causal law that “the sun is\nthrough its light the cause of heat” is itself a synthetic a\npriori truth. Indeed, the very same difficulty is present in our\ndiscussion at the beginning of this section. For, what Kant is saying\nin § II of the second edition of the Introduction to the\nCritique is that necessity and strict universality are\n“secure criteria of an a priori cognition” (B4;\nemphasis added). More specifically (B3):  \nExperience in fact teaches us that something is constituted thus and\nso, but not that it cannot be otherwise. Hence, if … a\nproposition is thought together with its necessity, then it\nis an a priori judgment.  \nYet, once again, Kant does not think that particular causal laws\nrelating specific causes to specific effects are all (synthetic) a\npriori. Accordingly, when Kant provides examples of (synthetic) a\npriori cognitions in the immediately following paragraph, he cites the\nsynthetic a priori principle of the Second Analogy of Experience\n(“All alterations take place in accordance with the law of the\nconnection of cause and effect” [B232]) rather than any\nparticular causal law (B4–5):  \nNow it is easy to show that there actually are such judgments in human\ncognition which are necessary and in the strictest sense universal,\nand therefore purely a priori. If one wants an example from the\nsciences, then one need only take a look at any of the propositions of\nmathematics. If one wants such an example from the most common use of\nthe understanding, then the proposition that every alteration must\nhave a cause can serve. \nOn the basis of this important passage, among others, the majority of\ntwentieth-century English-language commentators have rejected the idea\nthat Kant has a genuine disagreement with Hume over the status of\nparticular causal laws. One must sharply distinguish between the\ngeneral principle of causality of the Second Analogy—the\nprinciple that every event b must have a cause\na—and particular causal laws: particular instantiations\nof the claim that all events of type A must always be\nfollowed by events of type B. The former is in fact a\nsynthetic a priori necessary truth holding as a transcendental\nprinciple of nature in general, and this principle is explicitly\nestablished in the Second Analogy. But the Second Analogy does not\nestablish, on this view, that particular causal laws are themselves\nnecessary. Indeed, as far as particular causal laws are concerned, the\nSecond Analogy is in basic agreement with Hume: they (as synthetic\na posteriori) are established by induction and by induction\n alone.[8] \nIt is indeed crucially important to distinguish between the general\nprinciple of causality Kant establishes in the Second Analogy and\nparticular causal laws. It is equally important that particular causal\nlaws, for Kant, are (at least for the most part) synthetic a\nposteriori rather than synthetic a priori. It does not follow,\nhowever, that Kant agrees with Hume about the status of synthetic a\nposteriori causal laws. On the contrary, Kant (as we have seen)\nclearly states, in § 29 of the Prolegomena (the very\npassage where he gives his official “answer to Hume”),\nthat there is a fundamental difference between a mere “empirical\nrule” (heat always follows illumination by the sun) and a\ngenuine objective law (the sun is through its light the cause of heat)\narrived at by adding the a priori concept of cause to the merely\ninductive rule. Any law thus obtained is “necessary and\nuniversally valid”, or, as Kant also puts it, we are now in\npossession of “completely and thus necessarily valid\nrules”. In such cases (A91/B124):  \nThe succession is necessary; … the effect does not\nmerely follow upon the cause but is posited through it and\nfollows from it. The strict universality of the rule is\ncertainly not a property of empirical rules, which, through induction,\ncan acquire nothing but comparative universality: i.e., extensive\nutility.  \nTherefore, it is by no means the case that Kant simply agrees with\nHume that particular causal laws are grounded solely on induction and,\naccordingly, that the necessity we attribute to particular causal\nconnections is merely subjective. \nSimilarly, the text of the Second Analogy is also committed to the\nnecessity and strict universality of particular causal laws. If the\ngeneral causal principle (that every event b must have a\ncause a) is true, then, according to Kant, there must also be\nparticular causal laws (relating preceding events of type A\nto succeeding events of type B) which are themselves strictly\nuniversal and\n necessary.[9]\n Kant maintains that, when one event follows another in virtue of a\ncausal relation, it must always follow “in accordance with a\nrule” (A193/B238). Moreover, the “rule” to which\nKant is here referring is not the general causal principle, but rather\na particular law connecting a given cause to a given effect which is\nitself strictly universal and necessary (A193/B238–239):  \nIn accordance with such a rule, there must thus lie in that which\nprecedes an event in general the condition for a rule according to which\nthis event follows always and necessarily.  \nKant insists on this point throughout the Second Analogy:  \nthat which follows or happens must follow according to a universal\nrule from that which was contained in the previous state,\n(A200/B245) \nin that which precedes the condition is to be met with under which the\nevent always (i.e., necessarily) follows, (A200/B246)  \nand so on. One cannot escape the burden of explaining the apparently\nparadoxical necessity and universal validity of particular (synthetic)\na posteriori causal laws simply by distinguishing them from\nthe general (synthetic) a priori causal principle. \nWhat is the relationship, then, between the general causal principle\nof the Second Analogy and the particular causal laws whose existence,\naccording to Kant, is required by the causal principle? What, more\ngenerally, is the relationship between the transcendental synthetic a\npriori principles of the understanding (including all three Analogies\nof Experience—compare the end of\n note 3\n above—as well as the principles corresponding to the other\ncategories) and the more particular synthetic a posteriori laws of\nnature involved in specific causal relationships governing empirically\ncharacterized events and processes? The relationship cannot be\ndeductive; for, if one could deductively derive the particular causal\nlaws from the transcendental principles of the understanding, then the\nformer would have to be synthetic a priori as well. \nKant himself discusses this relationship extensively, beginning in the\nfirst edition version of the Transcendental Deduction\n(A126–128): \nAlthough we learn many laws through experience, these are still only\nparticular determinations of yet higher laws, among which the highest\n(under which all others stand) originate a priori in the understanding\nitself, and are not borrowed from experience, but must rather provide\nappearances with their law-governedness, and precisely thereby make\nexperience possible … To be sure, empirical laws as such can in\nno way derive their origin from pure understanding—no more than\nthe immeasurable manifold of appearances can be sufficiently\ncomprehended from the pure form of sensibility. But all empirical laws\nare only particular determinations of the pure laws of the\nunderstanding, under which and in accordance with the norm of which\nthey first become possible, and the appearances take on a lawful\nform—just as all appearances, notwithstanding the diversity of\ntheir empirical form, still must also always be in accordance with the\ncondition of the pure form of sensibility [i.e., space and time]. \nThe “pure laws of the understanding” (here and elsewhere)\nrefers to the pure transcendental principles of the\nunderstanding characterizing what Kant calls “experience in\ngeneral” or “nature in general”. \nIn the second edition version Kant makes essentially the same point,\nthis time explicitly stating that the relationship in question is not\ndeductive (B165): \nThe pure faculty of understanding, however, is not sufficient for\nprescribing to appearances a priori, through mere categories, any laws\nother than those which are involved in a nature in general,\nas the law-governedness of all appearances in space and time.\nParticular laws, because they concern empirically determined\nappearances, can not be completely derived therefrom,\nalthough they one and all stand under them. Experience must be added\nin order to become acquainted with the [particular laws] as\nsuch, but only the former laws provide a priori instruction\nconcerning experience in general, and [concerning] that which can be\ncognized as an object of experience. \nBut what exactly does it mean for particular laws of nature to\n“stand under” the a priori principles of the\nunderstanding—that is, to be what Kant calls “particular\ndeterminations” of these principles? Once again, it will take\nmore work fully to clarify this relationship, but we can meanwhile\nobserve that it is precisely in virtue of the relationship in question\nthat empirical causal connections—empirical causal laws of\nnature—count as necessary for Kant. \nThe necessity in question is characterized in Kant’s official\ndiscussion of the category of necessity in the Postulates of\nEmpirical Thought—the three principles corresponding to the\ncategories of possibility, actuality, and necessity\n(A218–218/B265–266): \nThe “formal [or “general”] conditions of\nexperience” include the forms of intuition (space and time),\ntogether with all the categories and principles of the understanding.\nThe material conditions of experience include that which is given to\nus, through sensation, in perception. Kant is thus describing a\nthree-stage procedure, in which we begin with the formal a priori\nconditions of the possibility of experience in general,\nperceive various actual events and processes by means of\nsensation, and then assemble these events and processes\ntogether—via necessary connections—by means of\nthe general conditions of the possibility of experience with which we\nbegan. \nIn his detailed discussion of the third Postulate Kant makes it clear\nthat he is referring, more specifically, to causal necessity,\nand to particular (empirical) causal laws\n(A226–8/B279–80):  \nFinally, as far as the third Postulate is concerned, it\npertains to material necessity in existence, and not the merely formal\nand logical necessity in the connection of concepts. … Now\nthere is no existence that could be cognized as necessary under the\ncondition of other given appearances except the existence of effects\nfrom given causes in accordance with laws of causality. Thus, it is\nnot the existence of things (substances), but only that of their\nstate, about which we can cognize their necessity—and, indeed,\nfrom other states that are given in perception, in accordance with\nempirical laws of causality.  \nNote that, in this passage, Kant refers to “laws of\ncausality” (in the plural) in the second quoted sentence, and\n“empirical laws of causality” (again in the plural) in the\nlast sentence. Hence, he is here referring to particular causal laws\n(of the form every event of type A must always be followed by\nan event of type B) rather than the general principle of the\nSecond Analogy (that every event b must have a cause\n a).[10] \nIn the Transcendental Deduction (as we have seen) Kant says that  \nall empirical laws are only particular determinations of the pure laws\nof the understanding, under which and in accordance with the norm of\nwhich they first become possible, and the appearances take on a lawful\nform. (A127–128)  \nIn the discussion of the third Postulate Kant says that we can cognize\nan effect as necessary on the basis of an empirical law\nrelating it to its cause—where the effect’s\n“connection with the actual is determined in accordance with the\ngeneral conditions of experience” (A218/B266). Kant is\nsuggesting, therefore, that the precise sense in which particular\nempirical laws themselves become necessary is that they, too, are\n“determined” in relation to actual perceptions “in\naccordance with the general conditions of experience” (where the\nlatter, of course, essentially include the “pure laws of the\nunderstanding”, i.e., the principles). \nThus, in the example from § 29 of the Prolegomena, Kant\nbegins from a mere “empirical rule” (that heat always\nfollows illumination by the sun) and then proceeds to a\n“necessary and universally valid” law by adding the a\npriori concept of cause to this (so far) merely inductive rule. The\nvery same three-stage procedure described by the three Postulates as a\nwhole—in which we begin with the formal a priori conditions of\nthe possibility of experience in general, perceive various\nactual events and processes by means of sensation, and then\nassemble these events and processes together (via necessary\nconnections) by means of the a priori conditions of the possibility of\nexperience—also results in “necessary and universally\nvalid” empirical causal laws of nature (the sun is through its\nlight the cause of heat) governing the events and processes in\nquestion. \nIn § 36 of the Prolegomena (after he has presented his\nofficial “answer to Hume” in § 29) Kant addresses the\nquestion of the relationship between particular empirical laws and the\na priori principles of the understanding under the title “How is\nnature itself possible?” Nature in the material sense\nis “the totality of all appearances” given in space and\ntime (4, 318; 69). Nature in the formal sense is “the\ntotality of rules under which all appearances must stand if they are\nto be thought as connected in an experience” (4, 318; 70). In\nanswering the question of how nature in the formal sense is possible\nKant proceeds to distinguish between “empirical laws of nature,\nwhich always presuppose particular perceptions” and  \nthe pure or universal laws of nature, which, without having a basis in\nparticular perceptions, contain merely the conditions of their\nnecessary unification in an experience. (4, 320; 71) \nYet (as we have seen) the empirical laws owe their status as\n“necessary and universally valid” to their relationship\nwith the a priori “pure or universal” laws (principles) of\nthe understanding. Moreover, Kant illustrates this situation with an\nexample, which (as explained in the very brief § 37)  \nis to show, that laws that we discover in objects of sensible\nintuition, especially if they are cognized as necessary, are already\ntaken by us to be such as the understanding has put there, even though\nthey are otherwise similar in all respects to laws of nature that we\nattribute to experience. (4, 320; 72)  \nThe example (presented in the immediately following § 38) is a\n \nphysical law of mutual attraction, extending over the whole of\nmaterial nature, whose rule is that it diminishes inversely with the\nsquare of the distances from every attracting point. (4, 321; 73)  \nThus, Kant illustrates his conception of the relationship between\nparticular empirical laws and the a priori principles of the\nunderstanding with the Newtonian law of universal\n gravitation.[11] \nIn § VI of the Introduction to the second edition of the\nCritique, where Kant discusses the “general problem of\npure reason” (“How are synthetic a priori judgments\npossible?”), Kant explains that  \nin the solution of [this] problem there is also conceived, at the same\ntime, the possibility of the pure employment of reason in grounding\nand developing all sciences that contain a theoretical a priori\ncognition of objects, i.e., the answer to the questions: How\nis pure mathematics possible? How is pure natural science\npossible?. (B20)  \nKant illustrates his contention that propositions of “pure\nnatural science” actually exist in a footnote (ibid.):  \nOne need only attend to the various propositions that appear at the\nbeginning of proper (empirical) physics, such as those of the\npermanence of the same quantity of matter, of inertia, of the equality\nof action and reaction, and so on, in order to be soon convinced that\nthey constitute a pure (or rational) physics, which well deserves, as\na science of its own, to be isolated and established in its entire\nextent, be it narrow or wide. \nKant had just completed the latter task, in fact, in his\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, which had\nmeanwhile appeared in 1786 (following the publication of the\nProlegomena in 1783 and immediately preceding the publication\nof the second edition of the Critique in 1787). There Kant\narticulates what he calls “pure natural science” in four\nchapters corresponding, respectively, to the four headings of the\ntable of categories (quantity, quality, relation, and modality). In\nthe third chapter or Mechanics (corresponding to the three categories\nof relation: substance, causality, and community) Kant derives three\n“laws of mechanics” corresponding, respectively, to the\nthree Analogies of Experience: the permanence or conservation of the\ntotal quantity of matter, the law of inertia, and the equality of\naction and reaction—which Kant describes as a law of “the\ncommunication of motion” (4, 544; 84). All these laws, Kant\nmakes clear, are synthetic a priori propositions, demonstrated a\npriori and “drawn from the essence of the thinking faculty\nitself” (4, 472; 8). \nFor Kant, therefore, the laws of the Newtonian science of nature are\nof two essentially different kinds. Kant regards Newton’s three\n“Axioms or Laws of Motion” presented at the beginning of\nthe Principia as synthetic a priori truths—which Kant\nhimself attempts to demonstrate a priori in the Metaphysical\n Foundations.[12]\n By contrast, Kant does not regard the inverse-square law of universal\ngravitation, which Newton establishes by a famous “deduction\nfrom the phenomena” in Book 3 of the Principia, as a\nsynthetic a priori truth—and, accordingly, Kant does not attempt\nto demonstrate this law a priori in the Metaphysical\nFoundations. Nevertheless, Kant regards the synthetic a\nposteriori law of universal gravitation as “necessary and\nuniversally valid” in virtue of the way in which it is\n“determined” in relation to the “phenomena” by\nthe synthetic a priori laws of pure natural science. And, since the\nlatter, in turn, are “determined” from the a priori\nprinciples of the understanding, the a posteriori law of universal\ngravitation is thereby “determined” in relation to actual\nperceptions “in accordance with the general conditions of\n experience”.[13] \nWe shall return to Kant’s conception of Newtonian natural\nscience below, but we first want to discuss Hume’s rather\ndifferent debt to Newton. Hume, like virtually everyone else in the\neighteenth century (including Kant), takes Newtonian natural science\nas his model, and, indeed, he attempts to develop his own\n“science of human nature” following Newton’s\nexample. Yet Hume learns a very different lesson from Newton than does\nKant, based on Newtonian inductivism rather than Newtonian\nmathematical demonstrations. Contrasting Hume and Kant on this point\ngreatly illuminates their diverging conceptions of causation and\nnecessity. \nTo begin with, Hume does not consider Newton’s “Axioms or\nLaws of Motion” as a priori in any sense (in Kant’s\nterminology, neither analytic nor synthetic a priori). All of these\nlaws, according to Hume, are simply “facts” inductively\nderived from (constant and regular) experience. Hume considers\nNewton’s second law of motion (F = ma) in the Enquiry,\nsection 4, part 1 (EHU 4.13; SBN 31):  \nThus, it is a law of motion, discovered by experience, that the moment\nor force of any body in motion is in the compound ratio or proportion\nof its solid contents and its velocity … . Geometry assists us\nin the application of this law … ; but still the discovery of\nthe law itself is owing merely to experience, and all the abstract\nreasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards the\nknowledge of it. \nOne of Newton’s main examples of the third law of motion is the\ncommunication of motion by impact or\n impulse.[14]\n Hume considers such communication of motion in the same section of\nthe Enquiry (EHU 4.8; SBN 28–29):  \nWe are apt to imagine, that we could discover these effects by the\nmere operation of our reason, without experience. We fancy, that were\nwe brought, on a sudden, into this world, we would at first have\ninferred, that one billiard ball would communicate motion to another\nupon impulse; and that we needed not to have waited for the event, in\norder to pronounce with certainty concerning it. Such is the influence\nof custom, that, where it is strongest, it not only covers our natural\nignorance, but even conceals itself, and seems not to take place,\nmerely because it is found in the highest degree. \nFinally, in a footnote at the end of part 1 of section 7 (the section\nin the Enquiry devoted to the idea of necessary connection),\nHume considers the law of inertia (EHU 7.25n16; SBN 73n1):  \nI need not examine at length the vis inertiae which is so\nmuch talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter.\nWe find by experience, that a body at rest or in motion continues for\never in its present state, till put from it by some new cause; and\nthat a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as\nit acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a vis\ninertiae, we only mark these facts, without pretending to have\nany idea of the inert power.  \n(Hume here puts the law of inertia and the communication of motion by\nimpulse together, because both are consequences of a body’s\n“inherent force [vis insita]” or “inert\nforce [vis inertiae”] according to Newton’s third\ndefinition preceding the Laws of\n Motion.[15])\n It is clear, therefore, that Hume views all of Newton’s laws of\nmotion as inductively derived empirical propositions, which\n(deceptively) appear to be derived from reason simply because the\nconstant and regular experience on which they are in fact based is so\npervasive. \nWe believe that Hume’s discussion of the communication of motion\nby contact or impulse shows his debt to Newton especially clearly. In\nsection 7, part 1 of the Enquiry Hume is criticizing the\ninherited ideas of necessary connection. We believe that both here and\nin section 4, part 1, where he rejects any a priori demonstration of\ncausality, Hume is centrally concerned with the conception of\nnecessary connection articulated by the mechanical natural philosophy.\nThis philosophy had taken the communication of motion by contact or\nimpulse as the paradigm of an a priori rationally intelligible causal\nconnection, to which all other instances of causal connection must be\nreduced. The reduction would take place by reducing all observable\ncausal relationships to the motions and impacts of the tiny\nmicroscopic parts of\n bodies.[16] \nIn the view of contemporary mechanical philosophers, especially\nHuygens and Leibniz, Newton’s conception of universal\ngravitation involved an entirely unintelligible action at a distance\nacross empty space. Gravitation could only be acceptable, on their\nview, if it were explained, in turn, by vortices of intervening\ninvisible matter whose tiny microscopic particles effected the\napparent attraction of bodies via impulse. Although both Leibniz and\nHuygens accepted Newton’s demonstration that the orbits of the\nsatellites of the major astronomical bodies in the solar system obey\nthe inverse-square law (the planets with respect to the sun, the moons\nof Jupiter and Saturn with respect to their planets, the earth’s\nmoon with respect to the earth), they rejected Newton’s\nunrestricted generalization of this law to hold between all bodies\n(and all parts of bodies) whatsoever. For them, the inverse-square law\ncould be accepted in astronomy only by taking the major bodies of the\nsolar system as each being surrounded by vortices limited to the\nfinite surrounding region of their satellites. The validity of the\ninverse-square law would thus be restricted to precisely such a finite\nregion, so that it could not be extended arbitrarily far: the moons of\nJupiter would accelerate towards Jupiter, for example, but neither\nSaturn nor the sun, for example, would experience such accelerations\ntowards\n Jupiter.[17] \nIn the second (1713) edition of the Principia, in response to\nthese doubts about the law of universal gravitation raised by\nmechanical philosophers, Newton adds an explicit principle of\nunrestricted inductive generalization—Rule 3—to a set of\n“Rules for the Study of Natural Philosophy” at the\nbeginning of Book 3. Rule 3 states (Principia, 795):  \nThose qualities of bodies that cannot be intended and remitted [i.e.\nqualities that cannot be increased and diminished] and that belong to\nall bodies on which experiments can be made should be taken as\nqualities of all bodies\n universally.[18] \nThen, in the explanation of this Rule, Newton depicts the hypotheses\nof the mechanical philosophy as in conflict with the method of\ninductive generalization that leads to the law of universal\ngravitation (Principia, 795–796):  \nFor the qualities of bodies can be known only through experiments; and\ntherefore qualities that square with experiments universally are to be\nregarded as universal qualities …. Certainly idle fancies ought\nnot to be fabricated recklessly against the evidence of experiments,\nnor should we depart from the analogy of nature, since nature is\nalways simple and ever consonant with itself. \nThat the “idle fancies” in question include the hypotheses\nof the mechanical philosophers (such as the vortex hypothesis) is made\nperfectly clear and explicit in the passage from the General Scholium\n(also added to the second edition in 1713) where Newton famously says\nthat he “feigns” no hypotheses (Principia, 943):\n \nI have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for\n[the] properties of gravity, and I do not feign hypotheses. For\nwhatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a\nhypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based\non occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental\nphilosophy. In this experimental philosophy, propositions are deduced\nfrom the phenomena and are made general by induction. The\nimpenetrability, mobility, and impetus of bodies, and the laws of\nmotion and the law of gravitation have been found by this\n method.[19] \nThus, Newton also makes it clear that gravity is (at least) as well\ngrounded by induction as the favored properties of bodies singled out\nby the mechanical philosophers (impenetrability, motion, and impetus),\nall of which have been derived inductively from phenomena (a\npoint he had earlier developed in the explanation of Rule\n 3).[20] \nHume (as we have seen) considers all the laws of\nmotion—including the communication of motion by contact or\nimpulse—as (merely) inductively derived general principles.\nAccordingly, Hume also unreservedly accepts universal gravitation and\ntakes Newton’s theory to articulate a fundamental law of nature\ncompletely on a par with all other inductively established laws (EHU\n6.4; SBN 57):  \nThere are some causes, which are entirely uniform and constant in\nproducing a particular effect; and no instance has ever yet been found\nof any failure or irregularity in their operation. Fire has always\nburned, and water suffocated every human creature: The production of\nmotion by impulse and gravity is an universal law, which has hitherto\nadmitted of no exception.  \nFor Hume, contrary to the mechanical philosophy, there is no asymmetry\nbetween the law of universal gravitation and the laws of impact with\nrespect to their intrinsic\n intelligibility.[21] \nThere is an even more fundamental relationship between Hume’s\nconception of the inductive method and Newton’s Rule 3. In the\nexplanation of this Rule (as we have seen) Newton takes the\nsupposition that “nature is always simple and ever consonant\nwith itself” to license the inductive generalizations made in\naccordance with the Rule. Similarly, Hume appeals, in the\nEnquiry, to the supposition that “the course of\nnature” does not change (EHU 4.21; SBN 37–38) or,\nequivalently, that “the future will be conformable to the\npast” (EHU 4.19; SBN 35–36). In the Treatise Hume\nformulates this supposition as the  \nprinciple, that instances, of which we have had no experience,\nmust resemble those, of which we have had experience, and that the\ncourse of nature continues always uniformly the same. (T 1.3.6.4;\nSBN 89)  \nHume takes this supposition to license (in his own words, to provide\nthe “foundation” for: compare\n note 5\n above) all inductive inferences from observed constant conjunctions,\njust as Newton takes the supposition that “nature is always\nsimple and ever consonant with itself” to license the\napplications of his Rule 3. It appears very likely, therefore, that\nHume takes this Newtonian supposition as the model for his own\nprinciple of the uniformity of\n nature.[22] \nYet Hume raises radical skeptical doubts about this very principle. It\nhas no foundation in reasoning: neither in demonstrative reasoning nor\n(on pain of circularity) in inductive reasoning itself. Nevertheless,\nas firmly based in custom or habit, it is a universal principle of the\nhuman mind. Moreover, it is also the foundation for the best available\nscience of matters of fact—Newtonian inductive science—and\nfor Hume’s own inductive science (self-consciously following\nNewton) of human\n nature.[23]\n Thus, when Hume sets his radical skeptical doubts aside, the\napplication of our foremost empirical scientific method (based on\nuniform constant conjunction) has normative force, and it thereby\nleads to the articulation of universal, exceptionless laws of nature\nwhich, as such, we are compelled to treat as necessary until\nexperience teaches us otherwise (in accordance with Newton’s\nRule 4 in Book 3 of the Principia: see\n note 19\n above).[24] It is because the idea of necessary\nconnection, for Hume, arises from the application of the Newtonian\ninductive method that our projection of an inner feeling of\ndetermination onto nature does not merely reduce to a blind\ninstinctual disposition, but amounts to a normative methodological\nstandard in our best scientific understanding of\n nature.[25] \nIn the famous hypothesis non fingo passage from the General\nScholium Newton characterizes his “experimental” method as\nfollows (Principia, 943): “In this experimental\nphilosophy, propositions are deduced from the phenomena and are made\ngeneral by induction”. Hume focusses exclusively on the second,\ninductive, clause, and he thereby shows an especially deep insight\ninto the fundamental difference between Newton’s methodology and\nthe purely demonstrative ideal of scientific knowledge represented by\nthe mechanical\n philosophy.[26]\n For Kant, by contrast, the dispute between Newton and the mechanical\nphilosophers is now effectively over; and Kant concentrates instead on\nNewtonian mathematical demonstrations and the idea of “deduction\nfrom phenomena”. This comes out especially clearly in the\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, where Kant\nengages with some of the most important details of Newton’s\ndemonstration of the law of universal gravitation from the initial\n“phenomena” described at the beginning of Book 3 of the\nPrincipia. Kant shows especially deep insight into the way in\nwhich this argument is inextricably entangled, in turn, with the\nNewtonian mathematical conception of (absolute) space, time, and\nmotion; and he thereby takes special pains to frame the explicitly\ninductive steps in Newton’s argument within the a priori\n“special metaphysics” of nature expounded in the\nMetaphysical\n Foundations.[27] \nThe “phenomena” with which Book 3 of the\nPrincipia begins record the observed relative motions of the\nprincipal satellites in the solar system with respect to their primary\nbodies (the planets with respect to the sun, the moons of Jupiter and\nSaturn with respect to their planets, the earth’s moon with\nrespect to the earth). All of these satellites obey Kepler’s\nlaws (at the time often called “rules”) of orbital motion;\nand, appealing to his first law of motion (the law of inertia), Newton\nis able to derive purely mathematically that each of the satellites in\nquestion experiences an inverse-square acceleration directed towards\nits respective primary body. Moreover, the so-called “moon\ntest” (developed in Proposition 4 of Book 3) shows that the\ninverse-square acceleration governing the moon’s orbit is, when\nthe distance in question approaches the surface of the earth,\nnumerically equal to the constant acceleration of terrestrial gravity\nfiguring in Galileo’s law of fall. Newton concludes (by the\nfirst and second of his Rules for the Study of Natural Philosophy)\nthat the (centripetal) force holding the moon in its orbit is the same\nforce as terrestrial gravity. \nThe crucial inductive steps come next. Newton generalizes the result\nof the moon test to all the other satellites in the solar system:\nthey, too, are held in their orbits by the same force of gravity\n(Proposition 5). Then (in Proposition 6) Newton concludes that all\nbodies whatsoever gravitate towards every primary body (including both\nSaturn and the sun towards Jupiter, for example); moreover, their\nweights, like those of terrestrial bodies, are proportional to their\nmasses at equal distances from the primary body in\n question.[28]\n Finally (in Proposition 7), Newton applies the third law of motion to\nthis last result to derive the law of universal gravitation itself:\nnot only do all bodies whatsoever experience inverse-square\naccelerations (proportional to mass) towards every primary body in the\nsolar system, but the primary bodies themselves experience\ninverse-square accelerations (proportional to mass) towards every\nother body (Jupiter towards its moons and all other planets, the earth\ntowards its moon and all other planets, and so\n on).[29]\n Indeed, Newton here extends this universal conclusion to the\nparts of all bodies as\n well.[30] \nKant accepts Newton’s law of gravitation in its full universal\nform—as a  \nphysical law of mutual attraction, extending over the whole of\nmaterial nature, whose rule is that it diminishes inversely with the\nsquare of the distances from every attracting point.\n(Prolegomena, § 38: 4, 321; 73)  \nMoreover, Kant has no qualms at all about action at a distance, and he\neven attempts to demonstrate a priori (in the Metaphysical\nFoundations) that universal gravitation, as a manifestation of\nwhat he calls the “original” or “fundamental”\nforce of attraction, must be conceived as an immediate action\nat a distance through empty\n space.[31]\n Kant also attempts to demonstrate his three “laws of\nmechanics” corresponding to Newton’s three laws of motion\nas synthetic a priori truths, especially the crucially important third\nlaw (the equality of action and\n reaction).[32]\n Whereas Newton had devoted considerable effort to producing\nexperimental evidence for this law (see\n note 14\n above), Kant here ventures a rare criticism of Newton for not having\nthe courage to prove it a\n priori.[33]\n Indeed, regarding this particular law as a synthetic a priori truth\nis central to Kant’s reinterpretation of the Newtonian concepts\nof (absolute) space, time, and motion; for it is in virtue of his\nunderstanding of the equality of action and reaction that Kant is now\nable simply to define the center of gravity of the solar\nsystem (in which this principle necessarily holds) as an empirically\ndeterminable (provisional) surrogate for Newtonian absolute\n space.[34]\n Moreover, and for closely related reasons, Kant takes the\nuniversality of what he calls the “original” or\n“fundamental” force of attraction—that it proceeds\nfrom every part of matter to every other part to infinity—as\nanother synthetic a priori truth demonstrable in “pure natural\n science”.[35] \nGiven this foundation in “pure natural science”, Kant then\nreconstructs Newton’s “deduction from the phenomena”\nof the law of universal gravitation as follows. We begin, following\nNewton, from the observable “phenomena” described by\nKepler’s “rules”. These “phenomena”, in\nKant’s terminology, are so far mere “appearances\n[Erscheinungen]”, which have not yet attained the\nstatus of “experience\n [Erfahrung]”.[36]\n Then, again simply following Newton, we can use the law of inertia to\nderive (purely mathematically) inverse-square accelerations of their\nsatellites directed towards every primary body in the solar system.\nOnce we have done this, however, we can now, from Kant’s point\nof view, frame all of Newton’s explicitly inductive steps within\nthe a priori “special metaphysics” of nature developed in\nthe Metaphysical Foundations. By demonstrating a priori his\nthree “laws of mechanics” corresponding to the three\nAnalogies of Experience, Kant establishes that Newton’s three\n“Axioms or Laws of Motion” are synthetic a priori truths\n(compare notes\n 12\n and\n 32\n above). Further, by identifying the accelerations in question as\neffects of what Kant calls the fundamental force of attraction, it now\nfollows from Kant’s “special metaphysics” of\n(material) nature that these accelerations must hold immediately\nbetween each part of matter and every other part of matter—and,\naccordingly, are also directly proportional to the\n mass.[37] \nIn the fourth chapter or Phenomenology of the Metaphysical\nFoundations Kant connects this reconstruction of Newton’s\nargument with the modal categories of possibility, actuality, and\nnecessity—the very categories which (as we saw at the end of the\nsecond section above) make it possible for initially merely inductive\ngeneralizations (à la Hume) to acquire the status of necessary\nlaws. The first stage, where we simply record the\n“phenomena” described by Kepler’s\n“rules” (as mere “appearances”:\n note 36\n above), corresponds to the category of possibility. The second stage,\nwhere we say that we here have instances of “true” (as\nopposed to merely “apparent”) rotation by appealing to the\nlaw of inertia, corresponds to the category of\n actuality.[38]\n In the third stage, finally, we apply the equality of action and\nreaction to the true centripetal accelerations correlated with such\ntrue rotations\n (note 38\n above); and all of them, in accordance with Kant’s metaphysical\n“dynamical theory of matter”, must now be taken as\nextending universally to infinity from each attracting point (compare\nnotes\n 35\n and\n 37\n above). The result is the law of universal gravitation, now seen as\nfalling under the category of necessity. In this way, Kant’s\nreconstruction of Newton’s “deduction” of the law of\nuniversal gravitation from the initial Keplerian\n“phenomena” provides a perfect illustration of the\nthree-step procedure, described in the Postulates of Empirical\nThought, by which a mere “empirical rule” is transformed\ninto a “necessary and universally valid” objective\n law.[39] \nWe have suggested that Kant’s reconstruction of Newton’s\n“deduction from the phenomena” of the law of universal\ngravitation in the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience is inextricably entangled with his reinterpretation of\nthe Newtonian concepts of (absolute) space, time, and\n motion.[40]\n Indeed, Kant begins the Metaphysical Foundations by defining\nmatter as “the movable in space”—and by introducing\na distinction between absolute and relative space which is clearly\nderived from Newton’s Scholium on space, time, and motion at the\nbeginning of the Principia (see\n note 38\n above). In Newton’s words (Principia, 408–409):\n \nAbsolute space, of its own nature without reference to anything\nexternal, always remains homogeneous and immovable. Relative space is\nany movable measure or dimension of this absolute space.  \nIn Kant’s words (4, 480; 15):  \nMatter is the movable in space. That space which is\nitself movable is called material, or also relative space.\nThat space in which all motion must finally be thought (and\nwhich is therefore itself absolutely immovable) is called pure, or\nalso absolute space. \nIt turns out, however, that Kant’s own view, in apparent\ncontrast with Newton’s, is that “absolute space is in\nitself nothing and no object at all”, but signifies only an\nindefinite process of considering ever more extended relative spaces\n(4, 481–482; 16–17). Moreover, when Kant returns to this\nissue in the Phenomenology chapter (compare\n note 36\n above), he states that  \nabsolute space is therefore not necessary as the concept of an actual\nobject, but only as an idea, which is to serve as the rule for\nconsidering all motion and rest therein merely as relative. (4, 560;\n99)  \nKant’s procedure for deriving “true motions” from\n“apparent motions” does not conceive true motions as\ntaking place in a pre-given absolute space, but views them as the\nproduct of an indefinitely extended process of empirical determination\ntaking place within experience itself: we begin from our parochial\nperspective here on the surface of the earth, proceed (in accordance\nwith the argument of Book 3 of Newton’s Principia) to\nthe center of gravity of the solar system, then proceed to the center\nof gravity of the Milky Way galaxy, and so on ad\n infinitum.[41] \nSimilarly, it is a central theme of the Analogies of Experience in the\nfirst Critique that “absolute\ntime”—“time itself” (B219), “time for\nitself” (B225), or “time in itself” (B233)—is\nno actual object of perception. Hence, the three “modes of\ntime” (duration, succession, and simultaneity) must all be\ndetermined in and through perceptible features of the appearances.\nKant calls this procedure “time determination” (more\nprecisely, “the determination of the existence of appearances in\ntime”), and he sums up his view as follows (A215/B262): \nThese, then, are the three analogies of experience. They are nothing\nelse but the principles for the determination of the existence of\nappearances in time with respect to all of its three modes, the\nrelation to time itself as a magnitude (the magnitude of existence,\ni.e., duration), the relation in time as a series (successively), and\nfinally [the relation] in time as a totality of all existence\n(simultaneously). This unity of time determination is thoroughly\ndynamical; that is, time is not viewed as that in which experience\nimmediately determines the place of an existent, which is impossible,\nbecause absolute time is no object of perception by means of which\nappearances could be bound together; rather, the rule of the\nunderstanding, by means of which alone the existence of the\nappearances can acquire synthetic unity with respect to temporal\nrelations, determines for each [appearance] its position in time, and\nthus [determines this] a priori and valid for each and every time. \nFor Kant, therefore, the temporal relations of duration, succession,\nand simultaneity cannot be viewed as pre-existing, as it were, in an\nabsolute time subsisting prior to and independently of the procedures\nof our pure understanding for determining these relations within the\nappearances themselves. On the contrary, temporal relations as such\nare the products of an empirical construction whereby we objectively\ndetermine the appearances as objects of a unified experience by means\nof the a priori principles of the Analogies. Thus, just as Kant does\nnot view the determination of true motions from apparent motions as\ntaking place within an infinite empty absolute space, he also rejects\nan analogous conception of absolute time and replaces it, too, with a\nprocess of empirical determination taking place within experience\nitself. \nIndeed, there is an intimate relationship between these two procedures\nfor empirical determination—of time and of motion, respectively.\nAt the very beginning of his famous Scholium Newton distinguishes\nbetween “true” and merely “apparent” time\n(Principia, 408):  \nAbsolute, true, and mathematical time, in and of itself and of its own\nnature, without reference to anything external, flows uniformly and by\nanother name is called duration. Relative, apparent, and common time\nis any sensible measure (whether accurate or nonuniform) of duration\nby means of motion: such a measure—for example, an hour, a day,\na month, a year—is commonly used instead of true time.  \nThen, several pages later, Newton illustrates the difference between\n“absolute” and “relative” time with reference\nto the celestial motions studied in astronomy (Principia,\n410): \nIn astronomy, absolute time is distinguished from relative time by the\nequation of common time. For natural days, which are commonly\nconsidered equal for the purpose of measuring time, are actually\nunequal. Astronomers correct this inequality in order to measure\ncelestial motions on the basis of a truer time. It is possible that\nthere is no uniform motion by which time may have an accurate measure.\nAll motions can be accelerated and retarded, but the flow of absolute\ntime cannot be changed. The duration or perseverance of the existence\nof things is the same, whether their motions are rapid or slow or\nnull; accordingly, duration is rightly distinguished from its sensible\nmeasures and is gathered from them by means of an astronomical\nequation. \nNewton is here referring to the standard astronomical procedure,\nalready well-understood in ancient astronomy, whereby we correct the\nordinary measure of time in terms of days, months, and years so as to\nobtain “sidereal” or mean solar time based on the motions\nof the sun relative to both the earth and the fixed\n stars.[42] \nIn the Refutation of Idealism added to the second edition of the\nCritique Kant argues that all empirical determination of\ntime—including determination of the temporal relations among\none’s own inner states—ultimately depends on the\nperception of outer things, and, in particular, on the perception of\nmotion in space (B277–278): \nAll empirical employment of our cognitive faculties in the\ndetermination of time fully agrees with this. It is not only that we\ncan undertake all time determination only by the change of external\nrelations (motion) in relation to the permanent in space (e.g., motion\nof the sun with respect to objects on the earth), but we also have\nnothing at all permanent, which could underlie the concept of a\nsubstance, as intuition, except merely matter, and even this\npermanence is not derived from outer experience, but is rather\npresupposed a priori as necessary condition of all time determination,\nand thus also [of] the determination of inner sense with respect to\nour own existence by means of the existence of outer things. \nIn emphasizing that only matter can instantiate the concept\nof substance here, Kant is alluding to the way in which the\nconservation of the total quantity of matter, in the Metaphysical\nFoundations, realizes the (transcendental) principle of the\nconservation of\n substance.[43]\n Moreover, Kant’s language at B277–278 (we\n“undertake [vornehmen]” time\ndetermination by observing “motion of the sun with respect to\nobjects on the earth”) thereby suggests a progressive empirical\nprocedure in which we begin with our perspective here on earth,\nmeasure the duration of time by the apparent motion of the sun, and\nthen proceed to correct this measure in light of our evolving\nastronomical\n knowledge.[44] \nFor Kant, once again, this need for correction is not an indication of\na pre-existing absolute time subsisting prior to and independently of\nour empirical procedures for determining temporal magnitudes from\nobservable motions. It rather implies that empirically observable\nmotions must be subject to a priori principles of the understanding (a\npriori rules of time determination) in order to count as fully\nobjective experience within a unified, temporally determinate\nobjective world. Applying the relevant principles of the\nunderstanding—the Analogies of Experience—therefore\nresults in a sequence of successive corrections or refinements of our\nordinary temporal experience, as the observable motions are\nprogressively embedded within an increasingly precise and refined\nconception of temporality itself. \nIn the Metaphysical Foundations, in particular, Kant\narticulates a specific realization of the Analogies of Experience in\nterms of the Newtonian theory of universal gravitation. Kant’s\nthree “laws of mechanics” (a version of the Newtonian laws\nof motion: compare notes\n 12\n and\n 32\n above) correspond to the three principles of the Analogies; the\ncategories of substance, causality, and community are realized by the\nsystem of Newtonian massive bodies interacting with one another in the\ncontext of what Newton, in Book III of the Principia, calls\nthe System of the World. The category of substance, that is, is\nrealized by the conservation of the total quantity of matter (mass) in\nall interactions involving these bodies (compare\n note 43\n above, together with the sentence to which it is appended); the\ncategory of causality is realized by the gravitational forces through\nwhich these interactions take place (in accordance with the law of\ninertia); and the category of community is realized by the\ncircumstance that precisely these forces are everywhere mutually\nequal and opposite. The temporal relation of duration is thereby\nrealized by the progressive empirical procedure by which we\nsuccessively correct our ordinary measure of time in light of our\nevolving astronomical knowledge (compare\n note 44\n above, together with the sentence to which it is\n appended).[45]\n The temporal relation of succession is realized by the deterministic\nevolution of the motions of the bodies (masses) in question described\nby the law of universal gravitation (according to which every later\nstate of the system is uniquely determined by its earlier\n states).[46]\n The temporal relation of simultaneity, finally, is realized by the\ncircumstance that gravitational forces instantaneously\nconnect each body in the system with all other\n bodies.[47]\n It is in precisely this sense that the procedure of time\ndetermination Kant describes in the Analogies is intended to replace\nthe conception of a pre-given absolute time. \nWe have now arrived at the most fundamental divergence between Kant\nand Hume concerning causation and induction. For Hume, the order of\ntime is empirically given by the sequence of impressions and ideas\n(and associations among them) which in fact happen to appear before\nthe mind. As Kant explains in the Second Analogy, however, such a\nsequence, from his point of view, is  \nmerely something subjective, and determines no object, and\ncan therefore in no way count as cognition of any object at all (not\neven in the appearance). (A195/B240)  \nFor Kant, it is only the a priori concept of causality (requiring a\nnecessary rule of connection between preceding and succeeding events)\nwhich can then transform a merely subjective temporal sequence into an\nobjective one (ibid.): \nIf we thus experience that something happens, then we always\npresuppose thereby that something precedes on which it follows in\naccordance with a rule. For otherwise I would not say of the object\nthat it follows, because the mere sequence in my apprehension, if it\nis not determined by means of a rule in relation to something\npreceding, justifies no sequence in the object. Therefore, it is\nalways in reference to a rule, in accordance with which the\nappearances in their sequence (i.e., as they happen) are determined\nthrough the previous state, that I make my subjective synthesis (of\napprehension) objective, and, it is solely under this presupposition\nthat even the experience of something happening is possible. \nIt is for precisely this reason, Kant concludes, that mere induction\nalone cannot be the ground for objective causal\nconnections—which presuppose both strict universality and\nnecessity, and therefore must be grounded on a priori concepts and\nprinciples of the pure understanding\n(A195–196/B240–241): \nIt seems, to be sure, that this contradicts all remarks that have\nalways been made concerning the course of the employment of our\nunderstanding, according to which we have only been first guided by\nthe perception and comparison of many concurring sequences of events\nfollowing on certain appearances to discover a rule, in accordance\nwith which certain events always follow on certain appearances, and we\nhave thereby been first prompted to make for ourselves the concept of\ncause. On such a basis this concept would be merely empirical, and the\nrule it supplies, that everything that happens has a cause, would be\njust as contingent as experience itself: its universality and\nnecessity would then be only feigned and would have no true universal\nvalidity, because they would not be grounded a priori but only on\ninduction. \nFor Kant, the concept of cause cannot possibly arise from a mere\nrepetition of resembling constant conjunctions (“concurring\nsequences of events following on certain appearances”) producing\na merely subjective\n custom.[48]\n The procedure by which we apply the concept of cause to experience\ncannot be merely inductive in the Humean sense; it must rather involve\na priori rules of the understanding through which we progressively\ndetermine the objective causal relations between appearances—and\nthereby determine the objective order of succession in time\n itself.[49] \nKant thus has a completely different perspective from Hume’s\nconcerning the uniformity of nature. For Hume, the principle of\nuniformity is a supposition implicit in all of our inductive\ninferences leading to the formulation of laws of nature. If this\nprinciple itself had a foundation in the understanding (in either a\npriori or a posteriori “reasoning”), then so would our\ninductive inferences from observed constant conjunctions to so far\nunobserved events. Yet the supposition in\nquestion—“that instances, of which we have had no\nexperience, must resemble those, of which we have had experience, and\nthat the course of nature continues always uniformly the\nsame” (T 1.3.6.4; SBN 89)—cannot itself be justified\nby either demonstrative or inductive reasoning. In the former case it\nwould have to be self-contradictory to imagine that the course of\nnature is not sufficiently uniform; in the latter the attempted\njustification would be viciously circular. The principle of\nuniformity, however, is firmly based in custom or habit, as a\nuniversal principle of the human mind, and it is also the foundation\nfor the Newtonian inductive method—including Hume’s own\ninductive science of the human mind. Although the principle thus has\nnormative force in all our reasoning concerning matters of fact in\nboth science and common life, it cannot ultimately legitimate the\nattribution of objective necessity to our inductively established laws\nof\n nature.[50] \nKant, in our view, is attempting to provide precisely such a grounding\nof objective necessity by means of the general principle of the\nAnalogies of Experience (B218): “Experience is possible only by\nmeans of the representation of a necessary connection of\nperceptions”. More specifically, the Analogies of Experience\nprovide an a priori conception of the unity and uniformity of\nexperience playing the role, for Kant, of Hume’s principle of\nthe uniformity of nature. According to the Analogies we know a priori\nthat nature in general must consist of interacting substances in space\nand time governed by universally valid and necessary causal laws\ndetermining the temporal relations (of duration, succession, and\nsimultaneity) among all empirical events, and this articulated a\npriori conception of nature in general amounts to the knowledge that\nnature is, in fact, sufficiently\n uniform.[51] \nWe can only have objective experience of particular events, for Kant,\nin so far as we simultaneously construct particular causal relations\namong them step by step, and this is only possible, in turn, in so far\nas we presuppose that they are one and all parts of a unified and\nuniform experience of nature in space and time governed by the\nAnalogies of Experience (together with the other principles of pure\nunderstanding). Moreover, since particular causal relations, for Kant,\nnecessarily involve causal laws, all of our inferences from particular\nperceptions to universal causal laws of nature are grounded in\nsynthetic a priori principles of pure understanding providing a\nsynthetic a priori conception of the unity and uniformity of nature in\ngeneral. Hume was correct, therefore, that the principle of the\nuniformity of nature governs all of our inductive causal inferences;\nand he was also correct that this principle is not and cannot be\nanalytic a priori. What Hume did not see, from Kant’s\npoint of view, is that the merely comparative universality of\ninductive generalization can indeed be overcome by transforming\ninitially merely subjective “empirical rules” into truly\nobjective and necessary “universal laws” in accordance\nwith synthetic but still a priori principles of the unity of\nnature in\n general.[52]","contact.mail":"graciela@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"},{"date.published":"2008-06-04","date.changed":"2018-11-04","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-hume-causality/","author1":"Graciela De Pierris","author1.info":"https://philosophy.stanford.edu/people/michael-friedman","entry":"kant-hume-causality","body.text":"\n\n\nKant famously attempted to “answer” what he took to be\nHume’s skeptical view of causality, most explicitly in the\nProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783); and, because\ncausality, for Kant, is a central example of a category or pure\nconcept of the understanding, his relationship to Hume on this topic\nis central to his philosophy as a whole.

There has been sharp disagreement concerning\nKant’s conception of causality, as well as Hume’s, and,\naccordingly, there has also been controversy over whether the two\nconceptions really significantly differ. There has even been\ndisagreement concerning whether Hume’s conception of causality\nand induction is skeptical at all. We shall not discuss these\ncontroversies in detail; rather, we shall concentrate on presenting\none particular perspective on this very complicated set of issues. We\nshall clearly indicate, however, where especially controversial points\nof interpretation arise and briefly describe some of the main\nalternatives. (Most of this discussion will be confined to footnotes,\nwhere we shall also present further, more specialized details.)\n\nIn the Preface to the Prolegomena Kant considers the supposed\nscience of metaphysics. He states that “no event has occurred\nthat could have been more decisive for the fate of this science than\nthe attack made upon it by David Hume” and goes on to say that\n“Hume proceeded primarily from a single but important concept of\nmetaphysics, namely, that of the connection of cause and\neffect” (4, 257; 7; see the Bibliography for our method of\ncitation). Over the next few pages Kant defends the importance of\nHume’s “attack” on metaphysics against common-sense\nopponents such as Thomas Reid, James Oswald, James Beattie, and Joseph\nPriestley (all of whom, according to Kant, missed the point of\nHume’s problem), and Kant then famously writes (4, 260; 10):\n \nI freely admit that it was the remembrance of David Hume which, many\nyears ago, first interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my\ninvestigations in the field of speculative philosophy a completely\ndifferent direction.  \nThus, it was Hume’s “attack” on metaphysics (and, in\nparticular, on the concept of cause and effect) which first provoked\nKant himself to undertake a fundamental reconsideration of this\n(supposed) science. \nLater, in §§ 27–30 of the Prolegomena, Kant\nreturns to Hume’s problem and presents his own solution. Kant\nbegins, in § 27, by stating that “here is now the place to\nremove the Humean doubt from the ground up” (4, 310; 63); and he\ncontinues, in § 29, by proposing  \nto make a trial with Hume’s problematic concept (his\ncrux metaphysicorum), namely the concept of cause.\n(4, 312; 65)  \nKant concludes, in § 30, by stating that we are now in possession\nof “a complete solution of the Humean problem” (4, 313;\n66)—which, Kant adds,  \nrescues the a priori origin of the pure concepts of the understanding\nand the validity of the general laws of nature as laws of the\nunderstanding, in such a way that their use is limited only to\nexperience, because their possibility has its ground merely in the\nrelation of the understanding to experience, however, not in such a\nway that they are derived from experience, but that experience is\nderived from them, a completely reversed kind of connection which\nnever occurred to Hume. (ibid.)  \nThus, Kant’s “complete solution of the Humean\nproblem” directly involves him with his whole revolutionary\ntheory of the constitution of experience by the a priori concepts and\nprinciples of the understanding—and with his revolutionary\nconception of synthetic a priori judgments. \nIndeed, when Kant first introduces Hume’s problem in the Preface\nto the Prolegomena he already indicates that the problem is\nactually much more general, extending to all of the categories of the\nunderstanding (4, 260; 10):  \nI thus first tried whether Hume’s objection might not be\nrepresented generally, and I soon found that the concept of the\nconnection of cause and effect is far from being the only one by which\nthe understanding thinks connections of things a priori; rather,\nmetaphysics consists wholly and completely of them. I sought to secure\ntheir number, and since this succeeded as desired, namely, from a\nsingle principle, I then proceeded to the deduction of these concepts,\non the basis of which I was now assured that they are not derived from\nexperience, as Hume had feared, but have sprung from the pure\nunderstanding.  \nMoreover, Kant soon explains, in § 5, how this more general\nproblem (common to all the categories and principles of the\nunderstanding) is to be formulated: “How is cognition from pure\nreason possible?” (4, 275; 27), or, more specifically,\n“How are synthetic a priori propositions possible?” (4,\n276; 28). \nIn the Introduction to the second (B) edition of the Critique of\nPure Reason (1787), Kant follows the Prolegomena in\nformulating what he here calls “the general problem of pure\nreason” (B19): “How are synthetic a priori judgments\npossible?” And, as in the Prolegomena, Kant insists\nthat the possibility of metaphysics as a science entirely depends on\nthis problem (ibid.):  \nThat metaphysics until now has remained in such a wavering state of\nuncertainty and contradictions is to be ascribed solely to the fact\nthat this problem, and perhaps even the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic judgments, was not thought of\nearlier. Metaphysics stands or falls with the solution of this\nproblem, or on a satisfactory proof that the possibility it requires\nto be explained does not in fact obtain.  \nKant then immediately refers to “David Hume, who, among all\nphilosophers, came closest to this problem”; and he suggests,\nonce again, that Hume failed to perceive the solution because he did\nnot conceive the problem in its  \n[full] generality, but rather stopped with the synthetic proposition\nof the connection of the effect with the cause (principium\ncausalitatis). (ibid.) \nIt is only in the second edition of the Critique that Kant\ngives such a prominent place to Hume and his “objection”\nto causality, serving to introduce what Kant now calls “the\ngeneral problem of pure reason”. By contrast, the name of Hume\ndoes not appear in either the Introduction or the Transcendental\nAnalytic in the first (A) edition (1781): it appears only in the\nTranscendental Doctrine of Method at the very end of the book, in a\ndiscussion of “skepticism” versus “dogmatism”\nin metaphysics (where Hume’s skepticism about causation, in\nparticular, is finally explicitly discussed). This is not to say, of\ncourse, that implicit references to Hume are not found earlier in the\ntext of the first edition. Thus, for example, in a preliminary section\nto the Transcendental Deduction Kant illustrates the need for such a\ndeduction with the concept of cause, and in both editions remarks\n(A91/B124):  \nAppearances certainly provide cases from which a rule is possible in\naccordance with which something usually happens, but never that the\nsuccession is necessary; therefore, a dignity pertains to the\nsynthesis of cause and effect that cannot be empirically expressed at\nall, namely, that the effect does not merely follow upon the cause but\nis posited through it and follows from it.  \nBut it is only in the second edition that Kant then goes on to mention\n“David Hume” explicitly, as one who attempted to derive\nthe pure concepts of the understanding from experience (B127):  \nnamely, from a subjective necessity arising from frequent association\nin experience—i.e., from custom—which is\nsubsequently falsely taken for objective.  \nThis striking difference between the two editions clearly reflects the\nimportance of the intervening appearance of the\nProlegomena. \nGiven the crucial importance of the Prolegomena in this\nrespect, it is natural to return to Kant’s famous remarks in the\nPreface to that work, where, as we have seen, Kant says that  \nit was the remembrance of David Hume which, many years ago, first\ninterrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my investigations in the\nfield of speculative philosophy a completely different direction.  \nIt is natural to wonder, in particular, about the precise years to\nwhich Kant is referring and the specific events in his intellectual\ndevelopment he has in mind. Here, however, we now enter controversial\nterrain, where there are basically two competing\nalternatives—both of which reflect the circumstance that Kant\ncould read Hume only in German translation. \nKant might be referring, on the one hand, to the late 1750s to mid\n1760s. A translation of Hume’s Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (originally published in 1748) appeared in 1755 and\nwas widely read in Germany. Kant had almost certainly read this\ntranslation by the mid 1760s, by which time he himself expressed\ndoubts about whether causal connections could be known by reason alone\nand even suggested that they were knowable only by experience. Or, on\nthe other hand, Kant might be referring to the mid 1770s. After the\nInaugural Dissertation appeared in 1770, Kant published\nnothing more until the first edition of the Critique in 1781.\nMeanwhile, a German translation of Beattie’s Essay on the\nNature and Immutability of Truth (originally published in 1770)\nappeared in 1772, where, in particular, Beattie quoted extensively\nfrom Book 1 of Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature\n(originally published in 1739). Thus, in the famous “dogmatic\nslumber” passage, Kant might be referring either to the mid\n1760s, when he then had a “remembrance” of reading the\ntranslation of Hume’s Enquiry, or to the mid 1770s,\nwhen he then had a “remembrance” of reading translations\nfrom the\n Treatise.[1] \nWe prefer the first alternative. From this point of view, the decisive\nevent to which Kant is referring is his reading of Hume’s\nEnquiry (in translation) during the late 1750s to mid 1760s,\nand this event, we believe, is clearly reflected in two important\nwritings of the mid 1760s: the Attempt to Introduce the Concept of\nNegative Magnitudes into Philosophy (1763) and Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer Explained by Dreams of Metaphysics (1766). \nIn the first (1763) essay Kant introduces the distinction between\n“logical grounds” and “real grounds”, both of\nwhich indicate a relationship between a “ground” (cause or\nreason) and a “consequent” (following from this ground).\nKant explains his problem as follows (2, 202; 239): \nI understand very well how a consequent may be posited through a\nground in accordance with the rule of identity, because it is found to\nbe contained in [the ground] by the analysis of concepts. …\n[A]nd I can clearly comprehend this connection of the ground with the\nconsequent, because the consequent is actually identical with part of\nthe concept of the ground …. However, how something may flow\nfrom another, but not in accordance with the rule of identity, is\nsomething that I would very much like to have made clear to me. I call\nthe first kind of ground a logical ground, because its relation to the\nconsequent can be logically comprehended in accordance with the rule\nof identity, but I call the second kind of ground a real ground,\nbecause this relation indeed belongs to my true concepts, but the\nmanner of this [relation] can in no way be estimated. With respect to\nsuch a real ground and its relation to the consequent, I pose my\nquestion in this simple form: how can I understand the circumstance\nthat, because something is, something else is to be? A\nlogical consequent is only posited because it is identical with the\nground. \nThe fundamental problem with the relationship between a real ground\nand its consequent, therefore, is that the consequent is not\nidentical with either the ground or a part of this concept—i.e.,\nit is not “contained in [the ground] by the analysis of\nconcepts”. \nThus, using his well-known later terminology (from the\nCritique and the Prolegomena), Kant is here saying\nthat, in the case of a real ground, the relationship between the\nconcept of the consequent (e.g., an effect) and the concept of the\nground (e.g., a cause) is not one of containment, and the judgment\nthat the former follows from the latter is therefore not\nanalytic. Moreover, although Kant does not explicitly refer\nto Hume in the essay on Negative Magnitudes, he proceeds to\nillustrate his problem with an example (among others) of the causal\nconnection in the communication of motion by impact (2, 202; 240):\n \nA body A is in motion, another B is at rest in the\nstraight line [of this motion]. The motion of A is something,\nthat of B is something else, and, nevertheless, the latter is\nposited through the former.  \nHume famously uses this example (among others) in the Enquiry\nto illustrate his thesis that cause and effect are entirely distinct\nevents, where the idea of the latter is in no way contained in the\nidea of the former (EHU 4.9; SBN 29):  \nThe mind can never possibly find the effect in the supposed cause, by\nthe most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the effect is totally\ndifferent from the cause, and consequently can never be discovered in\nit. Motion in the second billiard-ball is a quite distinct event from\nmotion in the first; nor is there anything in the one to suggest the\nsmallest hint of the other.  \nA few lines later Hume describes this example as follows (EHU 4.10;\nSBN 29):  \nWhen I see, for instance, a billiard-ball moving in a straight line\ntowards another; even suppose motion in the second ball should by\naccident be suggested to me, as the result of their contact or\nimpulse; may I not conceive, that a hundred different events might as\nwell follow from the cause? … All these suppositions are\nconsistent and conceivable. \nIn Kant’s second essay from this period, Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer (1766), he goes further: he suggests a Humean\nsolution to the problem he had posed, but did not solve, in the essay\non Negative Magnitudes. Kant suggests, more specifically,\nthat the relation between a real ground and its consequent can only be\ngiven by experience (2, 370; 356): \nIt is impossible ever to comprehend through reason how something could\nbe a cause or have a force, rather these relations must be taken\nsolely from experience. For the rule of our reason extends only to\ncomparison in accordance with identity and\ncontradiction. But, in so far as something is a cause, then,\nthrough something, something else is posited, and\nthere is thus no connection in virtue of agreement to be\nfound—just as no contradiction will ever arise if I wish to view\nthe former not as a cause, because there is no contradiction [in the\nsupposition that] if something is posited, something else is\ncancelled. Therefore, if they are not derived from experience, the\nfundamental concepts of things as causes, of forces and activities,\nare completely arbitrary and can neither be proved nor refuted. \nThis passage seems clearly to recall the main ideas in section 4, part\n1 of Hume’s Enquiry. After distinguishing between\n“relations of ideas” and “matters of fact”,\nand asserting that the former “are discoverable by the mere\noperation of thought” (EHU 4.1; SBN 25), Hume continues (EHU\n4.2; SBN 25):  \nMatters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not\nascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth,\nhowever great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of\nevery matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a\ncontradiction ….  \nHume then explains that: “all reasonings concerning matters of\nfact seem to be founded on the relation of Cause and\nEffect” (EHU 4.4; SBN 26) and adds (EHU 4.6; SBN 27):  \nI shall venture to affirm, as a general proposition, which admits of\nno exception, that the knowledge of this relation is not, in any\ninstance, attained by reasonings a priori; but arises\nentirely from experience, when we find that any particular objects are\nconstantly conjoined with each other.  \nFinally (EHU 4.10; SBN 29):  \nAnd as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect, in\nall natural operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience;\nso must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause\nand effect, which binds them together, and renders it impossible that\nany other effect could result from the operation of that cause.  \nThus, although Kant does not explicitly mention Hume in Dreams of\na Spirit-Seer, the parallels with Hume’s Enquiry\nare striking\n indeed.[2] \nKant does not endorse a Humean solution to the problem of the relation\nbetween cause and effect in the critical period (beginning with the\nfirst edition of the Critique in 1781): he does not (as he\nhad in Dreams of a Spirit-Seer) claim that this relation is\nderived from experience. Instead (as we have seen) Kant takes\nHume’s problem of causality to be centrally implicated in the\nradically new problem of synthetic a priori judgments. Yet the latter\nproblem, in turn, clearly has its origin in Kant’s earlier\ndiscussion (in the essay on Negative Magnitudes and\nDreams of a Spirit-Seer) of the apparently mysterious\nconnection between a real ground (or cause) and its consequent (or\neffect). Just as Kant had earlier emphasized (in these pre-critical\nworks) that the consequent of a real ground is not contained in it,\nand thus does not result by “the analysis of concepts”,\nKant now (in the critical period) maintains that the concept of the\neffect cannot be contained in the concept of the cause and,\naccordingly, that a judgment relating the two cannot be analytic. Such\na judgment, in Kant’s critical terminology, must now be\nsynthetic—it is a judgment in which “the connection of the\npredicate with the subject … is thought without\nidentity”, where  \na predicate is added to the concept of the subject which is by no\nmeans thought in it, and which could not have been extracted from it\nby any analysis. (A7/B10–11)  \nThe crucial point about a synthetic a priori judgment,\nhowever, is that, although it is certainly not (as a priori) derived\nfrom experience, it nonetheless extends our knowledge beyond merely\nanalytic judgments. \nIt therefore becomes clear why, in the Introduction to the second\nedition of the Critique, Kant says of the crucial problem of\nsynthetic a priori judgments that  \nthis problem, and perhaps even the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic judgments, was not thought of\nearlier,  \nand then explicitly names “David Hume, who, among all\nphilosophers, came closest to this problem” (B19). It also\nbecomes clear why, in the Preface to the Prolegomena, Kant\nexplains Hume’s problem as follows (4, 257; 7): \nHume proceeded primarily from a single but important concept of\nmetaphysics, namely, that of the connection of cause and\neffect … , and he challenged reason, which here pretends\nto have generated this concept in her womb, to give him an account of\nby what right she thinks that something could be so constituted that,\nif it is posited, something else must necessarily also be posited\nthereby; for this is what the concept of cause says. He proved\nindisputably that it is completely impossible for reason to think such\na connection a priori and from concepts [alone] (for this [connection]\ncontains necessity); but it can in no way be comprehended how, because\nsomething is, something else must necessarily also be, and how,\ntherefore, the concept of such a connection could be introduced a\npriori. \nThus here, in the Prolegomena, Kant describes what he calls\nHume’s “challenge” to reason concerning\n“the connection of cause and effect” in precisely\nthe same terms that he had himself earlier used, in the 1763 essay on\nNegative Magnitudes and the 1766 Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer, to pose a fundamental problem about the relation of\na real ground (as opposed to a logical ground) to its consequent. \nWhat is most important, however, is the official solution to\nHume’s problem that Kant presents in § 29 of the\nProlegomena. This solution depends on the distinction between\n“judgments of perception” and “judgments of\nexperience” which Kant has extensively discussed in the\npreceding sections. In § 18 Kant introduces the distinction as\nfollows (4, 298; 51): \nEmpirical judgments, in so far as they have objective\nvalidity, are judgments of experience; they,\nhowever, in so far as they are only subjectively valid, I\ncall mere judgments of perception. … All of\nour judgments are at first mere judgments of perception: they are\nvalid merely for us, i.e., for our subject, and only afterwards do we\ngive them a new relation, namely to an object, and we intend that [the\njudgment] is supposed to be also valid for us at all times and\nprecisely so for everyone else; for, if a judgment agrees with an\nobject, then all judgments about the same object must also agree among\none another, and thus the objective validity of the judgment of\nexperience signifies nothing else but its necessary universal\nvalidity. \nThen, in § 22, Kant emphasizes that the pure concepts of the\nunderstanding or categories function precisely to convert mere\n(subjective) perceptions into objective experience by effecting a\n“necessary unification” of them (4, 305; 58):\n \nTherefore, the pure concepts of the understanding are those concepts\nunder which all perceptions must first be subsumed before they can\nserve as judgments of experience, in which the synthetic unity of\nperceptions is represented as necessary and universally\n valid.[3] \nHere is how Kant formulates his solution in § 29 (4, 312;\n65): \nIn order to make a trial with Hume’s problematic\nconcept (his crux metaphysicorum), namely the\nconcept of cause, first, there is given to me a priori, by means of\nlogic, the form of a conditional judgment in general, namely, to use a\ngiven cognition as ground and the other as consequent. It is possible,\nhowever, that a rule of relation is found in perception which says\nthat a given appearance is constantly followed by another (but not\nconversely); and this is a case for me to employ the hypothetical\njudgment and, e.g., to say: if a body is illuminated sufficiently long\nby the sun, then it becomes warm. Here, there is certainly no\nnecessity of connection as yet, and thus [not] the concept of cause.\nHowever, I continue and say that, if the above proposition, which is\nmerely a subjective connection of perceptions, is to be a judgment of\nexperience, then it must be viewed as necessary and universally valid.\nBut such a proposition would be: the sun is through its light the\ncause of heat. The above empirical rule is now viewed as a\nlaw—and, in fact, not as valid merely of appearances, but\n[valid] of them on behalf of a possible experience, which requires\ncompletely and thus necessarily valid rules. \nAll the elements from Kant’s earlier discussion of causality in\nthe essays on Negative Magnitudes and Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer seem to be present here. Kant begins with the purely\nlogical relation between ground and consequent. Since, in the case of\nthe concept of cause, we are dealing with what Kant had earlier called\na real ground, Kant holds that we need a synthetic rather\nthan merely analytic connection between the two. The most obvious\nthought, which Hume had defended in the Enquiry (and,\napparently following Hume, Kant himself had defended in Dreams of\na Spirit-Seer) is that “experience” (in the Humean\nsense) is the basis for this connection in so far as one perception is\nfound to be “constantly conjoined” with another. Now,\nhowever, in the critical period, Kant introduces a revolutionary new\nconcept of “experience” which is explicitly opposed to\nmere constant conjunctions among perceptions in being “necessary\nand universally valid”—in particular, “experience is\npossible only by means of the representation of a necessary connection\nof perceptions” (B218). \nIn Kant’s example from § 29 of the Prolegomena,\nthen, we begin from a mere subjective “empirical rule”:\nthat the perception of an illuminated stone is constantly followed by\nthe perception of heat; and we then convert this “empirical\nrule” into an objective law according to which the very same\nrelationship is now viewed as “necessary and universally\nvalid”. This transformation is effected by the addition of the a\npriori concept of causality: “the sun is through its light the\ncause of heat”. It is in precisely this way, more generally,\nthat the categories or pure concepts of the understanding relate to\nexperience:  \nnot in such a way that they are derived from experience, but that\nexperience is derived from them, a completely reversed kind of\nconnection which never occurred to Hume. (§ 30: 4, 313; 66) \nWe shall devote the rest of this article to clarifying Kant’s\nsolution and its relationship with Hume’s conception of\ncausation. For now, we simply note an important difficulty Kant\nhimself raises in the Prolegomena. Whereas the concept of\ncausality is, for Kant, clearly a priori, he does not think that\nparticular causal laws relating specific causes with specific effects\nare all synthetic a priori—and, if they are not a priori, how\ncan they be necessary? Indeed, Kant illustrates this difficulty, in a\nfootnote to § 22, with his own example of the sun warming a stone\n(4, 305; 58): \nBut how does this proposition, that judgments of experience are\nsupposed to contain necessity in the synthesis of perceptions, agree\nwith my proposition, urged many times above, that experience, as a\nposteriori cognition, can yield only contingent judgments? If I say\nthat experience teaches me something, I always mean only the\nperception that lies within in it, e.g., that heat always follows the\nillumination of the stone by the sun. That this heating results\nnecessarily from the illumination by the sun is in fact contained in\nthe judgment of experience (in virtue of the concept of cause); but I\ndo not learn this from experience, rather, conversely, experience is\nfirst generated through this addition of the concept of the\nunderstanding (of cause) to the perception. \nIn other words, experience in the Humean sense teaches me that heat\nalways (i.e., constantly) follows the illumination of the stone by the\nsun; experience in the Kantian sense then adds that:  \nthe succession is necessary; … the effect does not\nmerely follow upon the cause but is posited through it and\nfollows from it. (A91/B124)  \nBut what exactly does this mean? \nKant formulates a crucial distinction between “strict” and\n“comparative” universality in § II of the\nIntroduction to the second edition of the Critique\n(B3–4): \nExperience never gives its judgments true or strict, but merely\nassumed or comparative universality (through induction), so\nthat, properly speaking, it must be formulated: so far as we have\nobserved until now, no exception has been found to this or that rule.\nIf, therefore, a judgment is thought with strict universality, i.e.,\nso that no exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not\nderived from experience, but is valid absolutely a priori. Empirical\nuniversality is thus only an arbitrary augmentation of validity from\nthat which is valid in most cases to that which is valid in\nall—as, e.g., in the proposition: all bodies are heavy. By\ncontrast, where strict universality essentially belongs to a judgment,\nthis [universality] indicates a special source of cognition for [the\njudgment], namely a faculty of a priori cognition. Necessity and\nstrict universality are thus secure criteria of an a priori cognition,\nand also inseparably belong together. \nKant then explicitly links this distinction to Hume’s discussion\nof causality in the following paragraph (B5):  \nThe very concept of cause so obviously contains the concept of a\nnecessity of the connection with an effect and a strict universality\nof the rule, that the concept [of cause] would be entirely lost if one\npretended to derive it, as Hume did, from a frequent association of\nthat which happens with that which precedes, and [from] a thereby\narising custom (thus a merely subjective necessity) of connecting\n representations.[4] \nMoreover, in the second edition (as we have seen) Kant also goes on to\nname Hume explicitly, as one who attempted to derive the concept of\ncausality  \nfrom a subjective necessity arising from frequent association in\nexperience—i.e., from custom—which is\nsubsequently falsely taken for objective. (B127)  \nIt appears, therefore, that Kant’s discussion, in § 29 of\nthe Prolegomena, of how, by the addition of the concept of\ncause, we convert a mere subjective “empirical rule” into\nan objective law (which is “necessary and universally\nvalid”), is not only indebted to Hume for the insight that the\nconnection between cause and effect is synthetic rather than analytic,\nit is also indebted to Hume’s discussions of the problem of\ninduction (in section 4, part 2 of the Enquiry) and of the\nidea of necessary connection (in section 7). Kant agrees with Hume\nthat the idea of necessary connection is in fact an essential\ningredient in our idea of the relation between cause and effect; Kant\nagrees, in addition, that, if all we had to go on were a purely\ninductive inference from observed constant conjunctions, the inference\nfrom comparative to strict universality would not be legitimate, and\nthe presumed necessary connection arising in this way (i.e., from\ncustom) would be merely subjective. \nSection 4 of the Enquiry is entitled “Sceptical Doubts\nConcerning the Operations of the Understanding”. In part 1 of\nthis section (as we have already seen) Hume maintains that the idea of\nthe effect is never contained in the idea of the cause (in\nKant’s terminology, the relation is not analytic), and thus,\naccording to Hume, it is never knowable a priori. We therefore need\nexperience in the Humean sense in order to make any causal\nclaims—that is, the observation of an event of one type\nA constantly followed by an event of another type B.\nOtherwise (as we have also seen) any event could follow any other (EHU\n4.10; SBN 29):  \nAnd as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect, in\nall natural operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience;\nso must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause\nand effect, which binds them together, and renders it impossible that\nany other effect could result from the operation of that cause.  \nNote that Hume is here supposing that, in our idea of the relation\nbetween cause and effect, the “tye or connexion … which\nbinds them together” is necessary (“it is impossible that\nany other effect could result”). In the corresponding section of\nthe Treatise, Book 1, part 3, section 2 (“Of\nprobability; and of the idea of cause and effect”), Hume makes\nthis completely explicit (T 1.3.2.11; SBN 77):  \nShall we then rest contented with these two relations of contiguity\nand succession, as affording a compleat idea of causation? By no\nmeans. An object may be continuous and prior to another, without being\nconsider’d as its cause. There is a NECESSARY CONNEXION to be\ntaken into consideration; and that relation is of much greater\nimportance, than any of the other two above-mention’d. \nIn the Enquiry, section 4, part 2, Hume presents his famous\nskeptical argument concerning causation and induction. Since we need\n“experience” (i.e., the observation of constant\nconjunctions) to make any causal claims, Hume now asks (EHU 4.14; SBN\n32): “What is the foundation of all conclusions from\nexperience?” The conclusion from an experience of constant\nconjunction is an inference to what has not yet been observed from\nwhat has already been observed, and Hume finds an unbridgeable gap\nbetween the premise (summarizing what we have observed so far) and the\n(not yet observed) conclusion of this inference (EHU 4.16; SBN 34):\n \nThese two propositions are far from being the same, I have found\nthat such an object has always been attended with such an effect,\nand I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance,\nsimilar, will be attended with similar effects.  \nHume concludes that this inference has no foundation in the\nunderstanding—that is, no foundation in what he calls\n “reasoning”.[5]\n How does Hume arrive at this position? \nAll our inductive inferences—our “conclusions from\nexperience”—are founded on the supposition that the course\nof nature is sufficiently uniform so that the future will be\nconformable to the past (EHU 4.21; SBN 37–38):  \nFor all inferences from experience suppose, as their foundation, that\nthe future will resemble the past …. If there be any suspicion,\nthat the course of nature may change, and that the past may be no rule\nfor the future, all experience becomes useless, and can give rise to\nno inference or conclusion.  \nTherefore, what Hume is now seeking, in turn, is the foundation in our\nreasoning for the supposition that nature is sufficiently uniform. \nSection 4, part 1 of the Enquiry distinguishes (as we have\nseen) between reasoning concerning relations of ideas and reasoning\nconcerning matters of fact and existence. Demonstrative reasoning\n(concerning relations of ideas) cannot establish the supposition in\nquestion,  \nsince it implies no contradiction, that the course of nature may\nchange, and that an object, seemingly like those which we have\nexperienced, may be attended with different or contrary effects. (EHU\n4.18; SBN 35)  \nMoreover, reasoning concerning matters of fact and existence cannot\nestablish it either, since such reasoning is always founded on the\nrelation of cause and effect, the very relation we are now attempting\nto found in reasoning (EHU 4.19; SBN 35–36):  \nWe have said, that all arguments concerning existence are founded on\nthe relation of cause and effect; that our knowledge of that relation\nis derived entirely from experience; and that all our experimental\nconclusions proceed upon the supposition, that the future will be\nconformable to the past. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this\nlast proposition by probable arguments, or arguments regarding\nexistence, must be evidently going in a circle, and taking that for\ngranted, which is the very point in\n question.[6] \nAlthough Hume has now shown that there is no foundation for the\nsupposition that nature is sufficiently uniform in reasoning or the\nunderstanding, he goes on, in the following section 5 of the\nEnquiry (“Skeptical Solution of these Doubts”),\nto insist that we are nonetheless always determined to proceed in\naccordance with this supposition. There is a natural basis or\n“principle” for all our arguments from experience, even if\nthere is no ultimate foundation in reasoning (EHU 5.4–5; SBN\n42–43): \nAnd though [one] should be convinced, that his understanding has no\npart in the operation, he would nonetheless continue in the same\ncourse of thinking. There is some other principle, which determines\nhim to form such a conclusion. This principle is CUSTOM or HABIT. For\nwherever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a\npropensity to renew the same act or operation, without being impelled\nby any reasoning or process of the understanding; we always say, that\nthis propensity is the effect of Custom. By employing that\nword, we pretend not to have given the ultimate reason of such a\npropensity. We only point out a principle of human nature, which is\nuniversally acknowledged, and which is well known by its\n effects.[7] \nIn section 7 of the Enquiry (“On the Idea of Necessary\nConnexion”), after rejecting the received views of causal\nnecessity, Hume explains that precisely this custom or habit also\nproduces our idea of necessary connection (EHU 7.28; SBN 75): \nIt appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connexion among events\narises from a number of similar instances which occur of the constant\nconjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by\nany one of these instances, surveyed in all possible lights and\npositions. But there is nothing in a number of instances, different\nfrom every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar;\nexcept only, that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is\ncarried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its\nusual attendant, and to believe that it will exist. This connexion,\ntherefore, which we feel in the mind, this customary\ntransition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant,\nis the sentiment or impression, from which we form the idea of power\nor necessary connexion. \nThus, the custom or habit to make the inductive inference not only\ngives rise to a new idea of not yet observed instances resembling the\ninstances we have already observed, it also produces a feeling of\ndetermination to make the very inductive inference in question. This\nfeeling of determination, in turn, gives rise to a further new idea,\nthe idea of necessary connexion, which has no resemblance whatsoever\nwith anything we have observed. It is derived from an\n“impression of reflection” (an internal feeling or\nsentiment), not from an “impression of sensation” (an\nobserved instance before the mind), and it is in precisely this sense,\nfor Hume, that the idea of necessary connection is merely subjective.\nHume emphasizes that this is a “discovery” both “new\nand extraordinary”, and that it is skeptical in character (EHU\n7.28–29; SBN 76):  \nNo conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than such as make\ndiscoveries concerning the weakness and narrow limits of human reason\nand capacity. And what stronger instance can be produced of the\nsurprising ignorance and weakness of the understanding, than the\npresent? For surely, if there be any relation among objects, which it\nimports to us to know perfectly, it is that of cause and effect. \nKant agrees with Hume that neither the relation of cause and effect\nnor the idea of necessary connection is given in our sensory\nperceptions; both, in an important sense, are contributed by our mind.\nFor Kant, however, the concepts of both causality and necessity arise\nfrom precisely the operations of our understanding—and, indeed,\nthey arise entirely a priori as pure concepts or categories of the\nunderstanding. It is in precisely this way that Kant thinks that he\nhas an answer to Hume’s skeptical problem of induction: the\nproblem, in Kant’s terms, of grounding the transition from\nmerely “comparative” to “strict universality”\n(A91–92/B123–124). Thus in § 29 of the\nProlegomena, as we have seen, Kant begins from a merely\nsubjective “empirical rule” of constant conjunction or\nassociation among our perceptions (of heat following illumination by\nthe sun), which is then transformed into a “necessary and\nuniversally valid law” by adding the a priori concept of\ncause. \nAt the end of our discussion in section 1 above we saw that there is a\nserious difficulty in understanding what Kant intends here—a\ndifficulty to which he himself explicitly calls attention. Kant does\nnot think that the particular causal law that “the sun is\nthrough its light the cause of heat” is itself a synthetic a\npriori truth. Indeed, the very same difficulty is present in our\ndiscussion at the beginning of this section. For, what Kant is saying\nin § II of the second edition of the Introduction to the\nCritique is that necessity and strict universality are\n“secure criteria of an a priori cognition” (B4;\nemphasis added). More specifically (B3):  \nExperience in fact teaches us that something is constituted thus and\nso, but not that it cannot be otherwise. Hence, if … a\nproposition is thought together with its necessity, then it\nis an a priori judgment.  \nYet, once again, Kant does not think that particular causal laws\nrelating specific causes to specific effects are all (synthetic) a\npriori. Accordingly, when Kant provides examples of (synthetic) a\npriori cognitions in the immediately following paragraph, he cites the\nsynthetic a priori principle of the Second Analogy of Experience\n(“All alterations take place in accordance with the law of the\nconnection of cause and effect” [B232]) rather than any\nparticular causal law (B4–5):  \nNow it is easy to show that there actually are such judgments in human\ncognition which are necessary and in the strictest sense universal,\nand therefore purely a priori. If one wants an example from the\nsciences, then one need only take a look at any of the propositions of\nmathematics. If one wants such an example from the most common use of\nthe understanding, then the proposition that every alteration must\nhave a cause can serve. \nOn the basis of this important passage, among others, the majority of\ntwentieth-century English-language commentators have rejected the idea\nthat Kant has a genuine disagreement with Hume over the status of\nparticular causal laws. One must sharply distinguish between the\ngeneral principle of causality of the Second Analogy—the\nprinciple that every event b must have a cause\na—and particular causal laws: particular instantiations\nof the claim that all events of type A must always be\nfollowed by events of type B. The former is in fact a\nsynthetic a priori necessary truth holding as a transcendental\nprinciple of nature in general, and this principle is explicitly\nestablished in the Second Analogy. But the Second Analogy does not\nestablish, on this view, that particular causal laws are themselves\nnecessary. Indeed, as far as particular causal laws are concerned, the\nSecond Analogy is in basic agreement with Hume: they (as synthetic\na posteriori) are established by induction and by induction\n alone.[8] \nIt is indeed crucially important to distinguish between the general\nprinciple of causality Kant establishes in the Second Analogy and\nparticular causal laws. It is equally important that particular causal\nlaws, for Kant, are (at least for the most part) synthetic a\nposteriori rather than synthetic a priori. It does not follow,\nhowever, that Kant agrees with Hume about the status of synthetic a\nposteriori causal laws. On the contrary, Kant (as we have seen)\nclearly states, in § 29 of the Prolegomena (the very\npassage where he gives his official “answer to Hume”),\nthat there is a fundamental difference between a mere “empirical\nrule” (heat always follows illumination by the sun) and a\ngenuine objective law (the sun is through its light the cause of heat)\narrived at by adding the a priori concept of cause to the merely\ninductive rule. Any law thus obtained is “necessary and\nuniversally valid”, or, as Kant also puts it, we are now in\npossession of “completely and thus necessarily valid\nrules”. In such cases (A91/B124):  \nThe succession is necessary; … the effect does not\nmerely follow upon the cause but is posited through it and\nfollows from it. The strict universality of the rule is\ncertainly not a property of empirical rules, which, through induction,\ncan acquire nothing but comparative universality: i.e., extensive\nutility.  \nTherefore, it is by no means the case that Kant simply agrees with\nHume that particular causal laws are grounded solely on induction and,\naccordingly, that the necessity we attribute to particular causal\nconnections is merely subjective. \nSimilarly, the text of the Second Analogy is also committed to the\nnecessity and strict universality of particular causal laws. If the\ngeneral causal principle (that every event b must have a\ncause a) is true, then, according to Kant, there must also be\nparticular causal laws (relating preceding events of type A\nto succeeding events of type B) which are themselves strictly\nuniversal and\n necessary.[9]\n Kant maintains that, when one event follows another in virtue of a\ncausal relation, it must always follow “in accordance with a\nrule” (A193/B238). Moreover, the “rule” to which\nKant is here referring is not the general causal principle, but rather\na particular law connecting a given cause to a given effect which is\nitself strictly universal and necessary (A193/B238–239):  \nIn accordance with such a rule, there must thus lie in that which\nprecedes an event in general the condition for a rule according to which\nthis event follows always and necessarily.  \nKant insists on this point throughout the Second Analogy:  \nthat which follows or happens must follow according to a universal\nrule from that which was contained in the previous state,\n(A200/B245) \nin that which precedes the condition is to be met with under which the\nevent always (i.e., necessarily) follows, (A200/B246)  \nand so on. One cannot escape the burden of explaining the apparently\nparadoxical necessity and universal validity of particular (synthetic)\na posteriori causal laws simply by distinguishing them from\nthe general (synthetic) a priori causal principle. \nWhat is the relationship, then, between the general causal principle\nof the Second Analogy and the particular causal laws whose existence,\naccording to Kant, is required by the causal principle? What, more\ngenerally, is the relationship between the transcendental synthetic a\npriori principles of the understanding (including all three Analogies\nof Experience—compare the end of\n note 3\n above—as well as the principles corresponding to the other\ncategories) and the more particular synthetic a posteriori laws of\nnature involved in specific causal relationships governing empirically\ncharacterized events and processes? The relationship cannot be\ndeductive; for, if one could deductively derive the particular causal\nlaws from the transcendental principles of the understanding, then the\nformer would have to be synthetic a priori as well. \nKant himself discusses this relationship extensively, beginning in the\nfirst edition version of the Transcendental Deduction\n(A126–128): \nAlthough we learn many laws through experience, these are still only\nparticular determinations of yet higher laws, among which the highest\n(under which all others stand) originate a priori in the understanding\nitself, and are not borrowed from experience, but must rather provide\nappearances with their law-governedness, and precisely thereby make\nexperience possible … To be sure, empirical laws as such can in\nno way derive their origin from pure understanding—no more than\nthe immeasurable manifold of appearances can be sufficiently\ncomprehended from the pure form of sensibility. But all empirical laws\nare only particular determinations of the pure laws of the\nunderstanding, under which and in accordance with the norm of which\nthey first become possible, and the appearances take on a lawful\nform—just as all appearances, notwithstanding the diversity of\ntheir empirical form, still must also always be in accordance with the\ncondition of the pure form of sensibility [i.e., space and time]. \nThe “pure laws of the understanding” (here and elsewhere)\nrefers to the pure transcendental principles of the\nunderstanding characterizing what Kant calls “experience in\ngeneral” or “nature in general”. \nIn the second edition version Kant makes essentially the same point,\nthis time explicitly stating that the relationship in question is not\ndeductive (B165): \nThe pure faculty of understanding, however, is not sufficient for\nprescribing to appearances a priori, through mere categories, any laws\nother than those which are involved in a nature in general,\nas the law-governedness of all appearances in space and time.\nParticular laws, because they concern empirically determined\nappearances, can not be completely derived therefrom,\nalthough they one and all stand under them. Experience must be added\nin order to become acquainted with the [particular laws] as\nsuch, but only the former laws provide a priori instruction\nconcerning experience in general, and [concerning] that which can be\ncognized as an object of experience. \nBut what exactly does it mean for particular laws of nature to\n“stand under” the a priori principles of the\nunderstanding—that is, to be what Kant calls “particular\ndeterminations” of these principles? Once again, it will take\nmore work fully to clarify this relationship, but we can meanwhile\nobserve that it is precisely in virtue of the relationship in question\nthat empirical causal connections—empirical causal laws of\nnature—count as necessary for Kant. \nThe necessity in question is characterized in Kant’s official\ndiscussion of the category of necessity in the Postulates of\nEmpirical Thought—the three principles corresponding to the\ncategories of possibility, actuality, and necessity\n(A218–218/B265–266): \nThe “formal [or “general”] conditions of\nexperience” include the forms of intuition (space and time),\ntogether with all the categories and principles of the understanding.\nThe material conditions of experience include that which is given to\nus, through sensation, in perception. Kant is thus describing a\nthree-stage procedure, in which we begin with the formal a priori\nconditions of the possibility of experience in general,\nperceive various actual events and processes by means of\nsensation, and then assemble these events and processes\ntogether—via necessary connections—by means of\nthe general conditions of the possibility of experience with which we\nbegan. \nIn his detailed discussion of the third Postulate Kant makes it clear\nthat he is referring, more specifically, to causal necessity,\nand to particular (empirical) causal laws\n(A226–8/B279–80):  \nFinally, as far as the third Postulate is concerned, it\npertains to material necessity in existence, and not the merely formal\nand logical necessity in the connection of concepts. … Now\nthere is no existence that could be cognized as necessary under the\ncondition of other given appearances except the existence of effects\nfrom given causes in accordance with laws of causality. Thus, it is\nnot the existence of things (substances), but only that of their\nstate, about which we can cognize their necessity—and, indeed,\nfrom other states that are given in perception, in accordance with\nempirical laws of causality.  \nNote that, in this passage, Kant refers to “laws of\ncausality” (in the plural) in the second quoted sentence, and\n“empirical laws of causality” (again in the plural) in the\nlast sentence. Hence, he is here referring to particular causal laws\n(of the form every event of type A must always be followed by\nan event of type B) rather than the general principle of the\nSecond Analogy (that every event b must have a cause\n a).[10] \nIn the Transcendental Deduction (as we have seen) Kant says that  \nall empirical laws are only particular determinations of the pure laws\nof the understanding, under which and in accordance with the norm of\nwhich they first become possible, and the appearances take on a lawful\nform. (A127–128)  \nIn the discussion of the third Postulate Kant says that we can cognize\nan effect as necessary on the basis of an empirical law\nrelating it to its cause—where the effect’s\n“connection with the actual is determined in accordance with the\ngeneral conditions of experience” (A218/B266). Kant is\nsuggesting, therefore, that the precise sense in which particular\nempirical laws themselves become necessary is that they, too, are\n“determined” in relation to actual perceptions “in\naccordance with the general conditions of experience” (where the\nlatter, of course, essentially include the “pure laws of the\nunderstanding”, i.e., the principles). \nThus, in the example from § 29 of the Prolegomena, Kant\nbegins from a mere “empirical rule” (that heat always\nfollows illumination by the sun) and then proceeds to a\n“necessary and universally valid” law by adding the a\npriori concept of cause to this (so far) merely inductive rule. The\nvery same three-stage procedure described by the three Postulates as a\nwhole—in which we begin with the formal a priori conditions of\nthe possibility of experience in general, perceive various\nactual events and processes by means of sensation, and then\nassemble these events and processes together (via necessary\nconnections) by means of the a priori conditions of the possibility of\nexperience—also results in “necessary and universally\nvalid” empirical causal laws of nature (the sun is through its\nlight the cause of heat) governing the events and processes in\nquestion. \nIn § 36 of the Prolegomena (after he has presented his\nofficial “answer to Hume” in § 29) Kant addresses the\nquestion of the relationship between particular empirical laws and the\na priori principles of the understanding under the title “How is\nnature itself possible?” Nature in the material sense\nis “the totality of all appearances” given in space and\ntime (4, 318; 69). Nature in the formal sense is “the\ntotality of rules under which all appearances must stand if they are\nto be thought as connected in an experience” (4, 318; 70). In\nanswering the question of how nature in the formal sense is possible\nKant proceeds to distinguish between “empirical laws of nature,\nwhich always presuppose particular perceptions” and  \nthe pure or universal laws of nature, which, without having a basis in\nparticular perceptions, contain merely the conditions of their\nnecessary unification in an experience. (4, 320; 71) \nYet (as we have seen) the empirical laws owe their status as\n“necessary and universally valid” to their relationship\nwith the a priori “pure or universal” laws (principles) of\nthe understanding. Moreover, Kant illustrates this situation with an\nexample, which (as explained in the very brief § 37)  \nis to show, that laws that we discover in objects of sensible\nintuition, especially if they are cognized as necessary, are already\ntaken by us to be such as the understanding has put there, even though\nthey are otherwise similar in all respects to laws of nature that we\nattribute to experience. (4, 320; 72)  \nThe example (presented in the immediately following § 38) is a\n \nphysical law of mutual attraction, extending over the whole of\nmaterial nature, whose rule is that it diminishes inversely with the\nsquare of the distances from every attracting point. (4, 321; 73)  \nThus, Kant illustrates his conception of the relationship between\nparticular empirical laws and the a priori principles of the\nunderstanding with the Newtonian law of universal\n gravitation.[11] \nIn § VI of the Introduction to the second edition of the\nCritique, where Kant discusses the “general problem of\npure reason” (“How are synthetic a priori judgments\npossible?”), Kant explains that  \nin the solution of [this] problem there is also conceived, at the same\ntime, the possibility of the pure employment of reason in grounding\nand developing all sciences that contain a theoretical a priori\ncognition of objects, i.e., the answer to the questions: How\nis pure mathematics possible? How is pure natural science\npossible?. (B20)  \nKant illustrates his contention that propositions of “pure\nnatural science” actually exist in a footnote (ibid.):  \nOne need only attend to the various propositions that appear at the\nbeginning of proper (empirical) physics, such as those of the\npermanence of the same quantity of matter, of inertia, of the equality\nof action and reaction, and so on, in order to be soon convinced that\nthey constitute a pure (or rational) physics, which well deserves, as\na science of its own, to be isolated and established in its entire\nextent, be it narrow or wide. \nKant had just completed the latter task, in fact, in his\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, which had\nmeanwhile appeared in 1786 (following the publication of the\nProlegomena in 1783 and immediately preceding the publication\nof the second edition of the Critique in 1787). There Kant\narticulates what he calls “pure natural science” in four\nchapters corresponding, respectively, to the four headings of the\ntable of categories (quantity, quality, relation, and modality). In\nthe third chapter or Mechanics (corresponding to the three categories\nof relation: substance, causality, and community) Kant derives three\n“laws of mechanics” corresponding, respectively, to the\nthree Analogies of Experience: the permanence or conservation of the\ntotal quantity of matter, the law of inertia, and the equality of\naction and reaction—which Kant describes as a law of “the\ncommunication of motion” (4, 544; 84). All these laws, Kant\nmakes clear, are synthetic a priori propositions, demonstrated a\npriori and “drawn from the essence of the thinking faculty\nitself” (4, 472; 8). \nFor Kant, therefore, the laws of the Newtonian science of nature are\nof two essentially different kinds. Kant regards Newton’s three\n“Axioms or Laws of Motion” presented at the beginning of\nthe Principia as synthetic a priori truths—which Kant\nhimself attempts to demonstrate a priori in the Metaphysical\n Foundations.[12]\n By contrast, Kant does not regard the inverse-square law of universal\ngravitation, which Newton establishes by a famous “deduction\nfrom the phenomena” in Book 3 of the Principia, as a\nsynthetic a priori truth—and, accordingly, Kant does not attempt\nto demonstrate this law a priori in the Metaphysical\nFoundations. Nevertheless, Kant regards the synthetic a\nposteriori law of universal gravitation as “necessary and\nuniversally valid” in virtue of the way in which it is\n“determined” in relation to the “phenomena” by\nthe synthetic a priori laws of pure natural science. And, since the\nlatter, in turn, are “determined” from the a priori\nprinciples of the understanding, the a posteriori law of universal\ngravitation is thereby “determined” in relation to actual\nperceptions “in accordance with the general conditions of\n experience”.[13] \nWe shall return to Kant’s conception of Newtonian natural\nscience below, but we first want to discuss Hume’s rather\ndifferent debt to Newton. Hume, like virtually everyone else in the\neighteenth century (including Kant), takes Newtonian natural science\nas his model, and, indeed, he attempts to develop his own\n“science of human nature” following Newton’s\nexample. Yet Hume learns a very different lesson from Newton than does\nKant, based on Newtonian inductivism rather than Newtonian\nmathematical demonstrations. Contrasting Hume and Kant on this point\ngreatly illuminates their diverging conceptions of causation and\nnecessity. \nTo begin with, Hume does not consider Newton’s “Axioms or\nLaws of Motion” as a priori in any sense (in Kant’s\nterminology, neither analytic nor synthetic a priori). All of these\nlaws, according to Hume, are simply “facts” inductively\nderived from (constant and regular) experience. Hume considers\nNewton’s second law of motion (F = ma) in the Enquiry,\nsection 4, part 1 (EHU 4.13; SBN 31):  \nThus, it is a law of motion, discovered by experience, that the moment\nor force of any body in motion is in the compound ratio or proportion\nof its solid contents and its velocity … . Geometry assists us\nin the application of this law … ; but still the discovery of\nthe law itself is owing merely to experience, and all the abstract\nreasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards the\nknowledge of it. \nOne of Newton’s main examples of the third law of motion is the\ncommunication of motion by impact or\n impulse.[14]\n Hume considers such communication of motion in the same section of\nthe Enquiry (EHU 4.8; SBN 28–29):  \nWe are apt to imagine, that we could discover these effects by the\nmere operation of our reason, without experience. We fancy, that were\nwe brought, on a sudden, into this world, we would at first have\ninferred, that one billiard ball would communicate motion to another\nupon impulse; and that we needed not to have waited for the event, in\norder to pronounce with certainty concerning it. Such is the influence\nof custom, that, where it is strongest, it not only covers our natural\nignorance, but even conceals itself, and seems not to take place,\nmerely because it is found in the highest degree. \nFinally, in a footnote at the end of part 1 of section 7 (the section\nin the Enquiry devoted to the idea of necessary connection),\nHume considers the law of inertia (EHU 7.25n16; SBN 73n1):  \nI need not examine at length the vis inertiae which is so\nmuch talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter.\nWe find by experience, that a body at rest or in motion continues for\never in its present state, till put from it by some new cause; and\nthat a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as\nit acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a vis\ninertiae, we only mark these facts, without pretending to have\nany idea of the inert power.  \n(Hume here puts the law of inertia and the communication of motion by\nimpulse together, because both are consequences of a body’s\n“inherent force [vis insita]” or “inert\nforce [vis inertiae”] according to Newton’s third\ndefinition preceding the Laws of\n Motion.[15])\n It is clear, therefore, that Hume views all of Newton’s laws of\nmotion as inductively derived empirical propositions, which\n(deceptively) appear to be derived from reason simply because the\nconstant and regular experience on which they are in fact based is so\npervasive. \nWe believe that Hume’s discussion of the communication of motion\nby contact or impulse shows his debt to Newton especially clearly. In\nsection 7, part 1 of the Enquiry Hume is criticizing the\ninherited ideas of necessary connection. We believe that both here and\nin section 4, part 1, where he rejects any a priori demonstration of\ncausality, Hume is centrally concerned with the conception of\nnecessary connection articulated by the mechanical natural philosophy.\nThis philosophy had taken the communication of motion by contact or\nimpulse as the paradigm of an a priori rationally intelligible causal\nconnection, to which all other instances of causal connection must be\nreduced. The reduction would take place by reducing all observable\ncausal relationships to the motions and impacts of the tiny\nmicroscopic parts of\n bodies.[16] \nIn the view of contemporary mechanical philosophers, especially\nHuygens and Leibniz, Newton’s conception of universal\ngravitation involved an entirely unintelligible action at a distance\nacross empty space. Gravitation could only be acceptable, on their\nview, if it were explained, in turn, by vortices of intervening\ninvisible matter whose tiny microscopic particles effected the\napparent attraction of bodies via impulse. Although both Leibniz and\nHuygens accepted Newton’s demonstration that the orbits of the\nsatellites of the major astronomical bodies in the solar system obey\nthe inverse-square law (the planets with respect to the sun, the moons\nof Jupiter and Saturn with respect to their planets, the earth’s\nmoon with respect to the earth), they rejected Newton’s\nunrestricted generalization of this law to hold between all bodies\n(and all parts of bodies) whatsoever. For them, the inverse-square law\ncould be accepted in astronomy only by taking the major bodies of the\nsolar system as each being surrounded by vortices limited to the\nfinite surrounding region of their satellites. The validity of the\ninverse-square law would thus be restricted to precisely such a finite\nregion, so that it could not be extended arbitrarily far: the moons of\nJupiter would accelerate towards Jupiter, for example, but neither\nSaturn nor the sun, for example, would experience such accelerations\ntowards\n Jupiter.[17] \nIn the second (1713) edition of the Principia, in response to\nthese doubts about the law of universal gravitation raised by\nmechanical philosophers, Newton adds an explicit principle of\nunrestricted inductive generalization—Rule 3—to a set of\n“Rules for the Study of Natural Philosophy” at the\nbeginning of Book 3. Rule 3 states (Principia, 795):  \nThose qualities of bodies that cannot be intended and remitted [i.e.\nqualities that cannot be increased and diminished] and that belong to\nall bodies on which experiments can be made should be taken as\nqualities of all bodies\n universally.[18] \nThen, in the explanation of this Rule, Newton depicts the hypotheses\nof the mechanical philosophy as in conflict with the method of\ninductive generalization that leads to the law of universal\ngravitation (Principia, 795–796):  \nFor the qualities of bodies can be known only through experiments; and\ntherefore qualities that square with experiments universally are to be\nregarded as universal qualities …. Certainly idle fancies ought\nnot to be fabricated recklessly against the evidence of experiments,\nnor should we depart from the analogy of nature, since nature is\nalways simple and ever consonant with itself. \nThat the “idle fancies” in question include the hypotheses\nof the mechanical philosophers (such as the vortex hypothesis) is made\nperfectly clear and explicit in the passage from the General Scholium\n(also added to the second edition in 1713) where Newton famously says\nthat he “feigns” no hypotheses (Principia, 943):\n \nI have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for\n[the] properties of gravity, and I do not feign hypotheses. For\nwhatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a\nhypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based\non occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental\nphilosophy. In this experimental philosophy, propositions are deduced\nfrom the phenomena and are made general by induction. The\nimpenetrability, mobility, and impetus of bodies, and the laws of\nmotion and the law of gravitation have been found by this\n method.[19] \nThus, Newton also makes it clear that gravity is (at least) as well\ngrounded by induction as the favored properties of bodies singled out\nby the mechanical philosophers (impenetrability, motion, and impetus),\nall of which have been derived inductively from phenomena (a\npoint he had earlier developed in the explanation of Rule\n 3).[20] \nHume (as we have seen) considers all the laws of\nmotion—including the communication of motion by contact or\nimpulse—as (merely) inductively derived general principles.\nAccordingly, Hume also unreservedly accepts universal gravitation and\ntakes Newton’s theory to articulate a fundamental law of nature\ncompletely on a par with all other inductively established laws (EHU\n6.4; SBN 57):  \nThere are some causes, which are entirely uniform and constant in\nproducing a particular effect; and no instance has ever yet been found\nof any failure or irregularity in their operation. Fire has always\nburned, and water suffocated every human creature: The production of\nmotion by impulse and gravity is an universal law, which has hitherto\nadmitted of no exception.  \nFor Hume, contrary to the mechanical philosophy, there is no asymmetry\nbetween the law of universal gravitation and the laws of impact with\nrespect to their intrinsic\n intelligibility.[21] \nThere is an even more fundamental relationship between Hume’s\nconception of the inductive method and Newton’s Rule 3. In the\nexplanation of this Rule (as we have seen) Newton takes the\nsupposition that “nature is always simple and ever consonant\nwith itself” to license the inductive generalizations made in\naccordance with the Rule. Similarly, Hume appeals, in the\nEnquiry, to the supposition that “the course of\nnature” does not change (EHU 4.21; SBN 37–38) or,\nequivalently, that “the future will be conformable to the\npast” (EHU 4.19; SBN 35–36). In the Treatise Hume\nformulates this supposition as the  \nprinciple, that instances, of which we have had no experience,\nmust resemble those, of which we have had experience, and that the\ncourse of nature continues always uniformly the same. (T 1.3.6.4;\nSBN 89)  \nHume takes this supposition to license (in his own words, to provide\nthe “foundation” for: compare\n note 5\n above) all inductive inferences from observed constant conjunctions,\njust as Newton takes the supposition that “nature is always\nsimple and ever consonant with itself” to license the\napplications of his Rule 3. It appears very likely, therefore, that\nHume takes this Newtonian supposition as the model for his own\nprinciple of the uniformity of\n nature.[22] \nYet Hume raises radical skeptical doubts about this very principle. It\nhas no foundation in reasoning: neither in demonstrative reasoning nor\n(on pain of circularity) in inductive reasoning itself. Nevertheless,\nas firmly based in custom or habit, it is a universal principle of the\nhuman mind. Moreover, it is also the foundation for the best available\nscience of matters of fact—Newtonian inductive science—and\nfor Hume’s own inductive science (self-consciously following\nNewton) of human\n nature.[23]\n Thus, when Hume sets his radical skeptical doubts aside, the\napplication of our foremost empirical scientific method (based on\nuniform constant conjunction) has normative force, and it thereby\nleads to the articulation of universal, exceptionless laws of nature\nwhich, as such, we are compelled to treat as necessary until\nexperience teaches us otherwise (in accordance with Newton’s\nRule 4 in Book 3 of the Principia: see\n note 19\n above).[24] It is because the idea of necessary\nconnection, for Hume, arises from the application of the Newtonian\ninductive method that our projection of an inner feeling of\ndetermination onto nature does not merely reduce to a blind\ninstinctual disposition, but amounts to a normative methodological\nstandard in our best scientific understanding of\n nature.[25] \nIn the famous hypothesis non fingo passage from the General\nScholium Newton characterizes his “experimental” method as\nfollows (Principia, 943): “In this experimental\nphilosophy, propositions are deduced from the phenomena and are made\ngeneral by induction”. Hume focusses exclusively on the second,\ninductive, clause, and he thereby shows an especially deep insight\ninto the fundamental difference between Newton’s methodology and\nthe purely demonstrative ideal of scientific knowledge represented by\nthe mechanical\n philosophy.[26]\n For Kant, by contrast, the dispute between Newton and the mechanical\nphilosophers is now effectively over; and Kant concentrates instead on\nNewtonian mathematical demonstrations and the idea of “deduction\nfrom phenomena”. This comes out especially clearly in the\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, where Kant\nengages with some of the most important details of Newton’s\ndemonstration of the law of universal gravitation from the initial\n“phenomena” described at the beginning of Book 3 of the\nPrincipia. Kant shows especially deep insight into the way in\nwhich this argument is inextricably entangled, in turn, with the\nNewtonian mathematical conception of (absolute) space, time, and\nmotion; and he thereby takes special pains to frame the explicitly\ninductive steps in Newton’s argument within the a priori\n“special metaphysics” of nature expounded in the\nMetaphysical\n Foundations.[27] \nThe “phenomena” with which Book 3 of the\nPrincipia begins record the observed relative motions of the\nprincipal satellites in the solar system with respect to their primary\nbodies (the planets with respect to the sun, the moons of Jupiter and\nSaturn with respect to their planets, the earth’s moon with\nrespect to the earth). All of these satellites obey Kepler’s\nlaws (at the time often called “rules”) of orbital motion;\nand, appealing to his first law of motion (the law of inertia), Newton\nis able to derive purely mathematically that each of the satellites in\nquestion experiences an inverse-square acceleration directed towards\nits respective primary body. Moreover, the so-called “moon\ntest” (developed in Proposition 4 of Book 3) shows that the\ninverse-square acceleration governing the moon’s orbit is, when\nthe distance in question approaches the surface of the earth,\nnumerically equal to the constant acceleration of terrestrial gravity\nfiguring in Galileo’s law of fall. Newton concludes (by the\nfirst and second of his Rules for the Study of Natural Philosophy)\nthat the (centripetal) force holding the moon in its orbit is the same\nforce as terrestrial gravity. \nThe crucial inductive steps come next. Newton generalizes the result\nof the moon test to all the other satellites in the solar system:\nthey, too, are held in their orbits by the same force of gravity\n(Proposition 5). Then (in Proposition 6) Newton concludes that all\nbodies whatsoever gravitate towards every primary body (including both\nSaturn and the sun towards Jupiter, for example); moreover, their\nweights, like those of terrestrial bodies, are proportional to their\nmasses at equal distances from the primary body in\n question.[28]\n Finally (in Proposition 7), Newton applies the third law of motion to\nthis last result to derive the law of universal gravitation itself:\nnot only do all bodies whatsoever experience inverse-square\naccelerations (proportional to mass) towards every primary body in the\nsolar system, but the primary bodies themselves experience\ninverse-square accelerations (proportional to mass) towards every\nother body (Jupiter towards its moons and all other planets, the earth\ntowards its moon and all other planets, and so\n on).[29]\n Indeed, Newton here extends this universal conclusion to the\nparts of all bodies as\n well.[30] \nKant accepts Newton’s law of gravitation in its full universal\nform—as a  \nphysical law of mutual attraction, extending over the whole of\nmaterial nature, whose rule is that it diminishes inversely with the\nsquare of the distances from every attracting point.\n(Prolegomena, § 38: 4, 321; 73)  \nMoreover, Kant has no qualms at all about action at a distance, and he\neven attempts to demonstrate a priori (in the Metaphysical\nFoundations) that universal gravitation, as a manifestation of\nwhat he calls the “original” or “fundamental”\nforce of attraction, must be conceived as an immediate action\nat a distance through empty\n space.[31]\n Kant also attempts to demonstrate his three “laws of\nmechanics” corresponding to Newton’s three laws of motion\nas synthetic a priori truths, especially the crucially important third\nlaw (the equality of action and\n reaction).[32]\n Whereas Newton had devoted considerable effort to producing\nexperimental evidence for this law (see\n note 14\n above), Kant here ventures a rare criticism of Newton for not having\nthe courage to prove it a\n priori.[33]\n Indeed, regarding this particular law as a synthetic a priori truth\nis central to Kant’s reinterpretation of the Newtonian concepts\nof (absolute) space, time, and motion; for it is in virtue of his\nunderstanding of the equality of action and reaction that Kant is now\nable simply to define the center of gravity of the solar\nsystem (in which this principle necessarily holds) as an empirically\ndeterminable (provisional) surrogate for Newtonian absolute\n space.[34]\n Moreover, and for closely related reasons, Kant takes the\nuniversality of what he calls the “original” or\n“fundamental” force of attraction—that it proceeds\nfrom every part of matter to every other part to infinity—as\nanother synthetic a priori truth demonstrable in “pure natural\n science”.[35] \nGiven this foundation in “pure natural science”, Kant then\nreconstructs Newton’s “deduction from the phenomena”\nof the law of universal gravitation as follows. We begin, following\nNewton, from the observable “phenomena” described by\nKepler’s “rules”. These “phenomena”, in\nKant’s terminology, are so far mere “appearances\n[Erscheinungen]”, which have not yet attained the\nstatus of “experience\n [Erfahrung]”.[36]\n Then, again simply following Newton, we can use the law of inertia to\nderive (purely mathematically) inverse-square accelerations of their\nsatellites directed towards every primary body in the solar system.\nOnce we have done this, however, we can now, from Kant’s point\nof view, frame all of Newton’s explicitly inductive steps within\nthe a priori “special metaphysics” of nature developed in\nthe Metaphysical Foundations. By demonstrating a priori his\nthree “laws of mechanics” corresponding to the three\nAnalogies of Experience, Kant establishes that Newton’s three\n“Axioms or Laws of Motion” are synthetic a priori truths\n(compare notes\n 12\n and\n 32\n above). Further, by identifying the accelerations in question as\neffects of what Kant calls the fundamental force of attraction, it now\nfollows from Kant’s “special metaphysics” of\n(material) nature that these accelerations must hold immediately\nbetween each part of matter and every other part of matter—and,\naccordingly, are also directly proportional to the\n mass.[37] \nIn the fourth chapter or Phenomenology of the Metaphysical\nFoundations Kant connects this reconstruction of Newton’s\nargument with the modal categories of possibility, actuality, and\nnecessity—the very categories which (as we saw at the end of the\nsecond section above) make it possible for initially merely inductive\ngeneralizations (à la Hume) to acquire the status of necessary\nlaws. The first stage, where we simply record the\n“phenomena” described by Kepler’s\n“rules” (as mere “appearances”:\n note 36\n above), corresponds to the category of possibility. The second stage,\nwhere we say that we here have instances of “true” (as\nopposed to merely “apparent”) rotation by appealing to the\nlaw of inertia, corresponds to the category of\n actuality.[38]\n In the third stage, finally, we apply the equality of action and\nreaction to the true centripetal accelerations correlated with such\ntrue rotations\n (note 38\n above); and all of them, in accordance with Kant’s metaphysical\n“dynamical theory of matter”, must now be taken as\nextending universally to infinity from each attracting point (compare\nnotes\n 35\n and\n 37\n above). The result is the law of universal gravitation, now seen as\nfalling under the category of necessity. In this way, Kant’s\nreconstruction of Newton’s “deduction” of the law of\nuniversal gravitation from the initial Keplerian\n“phenomena” provides a perfect illustration of the\nthree-step procedure, described in the Postulates of Empirical\nThought, by which a mere “empirical rule” is transformed\ninto a “necessary and universally valid” objective\n law.[39] \nWe have suggested that Kant’s reconstruction of Newton’s\n“deduction from the phenomena” of the law of universal\ngravitation in the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience is inextricably entangled with his reinterpretation of\nthe Newtonian concepts of (absolute) space, time, and\n motion.[40]\n Indeed, Kant begins the Metaphysical Foundations by defining\nmatter as “the movable in space”—and by introducing\na distinction between absolute and relative space which is clearly\nderived from Newton’s Scholium on space, time, and motion at the\nbeginning of the Principia (see\n note 38\n above). In Newton’s words (Principia, 408–409):\n \nAbsolute space, of its own nature without reference to anything\nexternal, always remains homogeneous and immovable. Relative space is\nany movable measure or dimension of this absolute space.  \nIn Kant’s words (4, 480; 15):  \nMatter is the movable in space. That space which is\nitself movable is called material, or also relative space.\nThat space in which all motion must finally be thought (and\nwhich is therefore itself absolutely immovable) is called pure, or\nalso absolute space. \nIt turns out, however, that Kant’s own view, in apparent\ncontrast with Newton’s, is that “absolute space is in\nitself nothing and no object at all”, but signifies only an\nindefinite process of considering ever more extended relative spaces\n(4, 481–482; 16–17). Moreover, when Kant returns to this\nissue in the Phenomenology chapter (compare\n note 36\n above), he states that  \nabsolute space is therefore not necessary as the concept of an actual\nobject, but only as an idea, which is to serve as the rule for\nconsidering all motion and rest therein merely as relative. (4, 560;\n99)  \nKant’s procedure for deriving “true motions” from\n“apparent motions” does not conceive true motions as\ntaking place in a pre-given absolute space, but views them as the\nproduct of an indefinitely extended process of empirical determination\ntaking place within experience itself: we begin from our parochial\nperspective here on the surface of the earth, proceed (in accordance\nwith the argument of Book 3 of Newton’s Principia) to\nthe center of gravity of the solar system, then proceed to the center\nof gravity of the Milky Way galaxy, and so on ad\n infinitum.[41] \nSimilarly, it is a central theme of the Analogies of Experience in the\nfirst Critique that “absolute\ntime”—“time itself” (B219), “time for\nitself” (B225), or “time in itself” (B233)—is\nno actual object of perception. Hence, the three “modes of\ntime” (duration, succession, and simultaneity) must all be\ndetermined in and through perceptible features of the appearances.\nKant calls this procedure “time determination” (more\nprecisely, “the determination of the existence of appearances in\ntime”), and he sums up his view as follows (A215/B262): \nThese, then, are the three analogies of experience. They are nothing\nelse but the principles for the determination of the existence of\nappearances in time with respect to all of its three modes, the\nrelation to time itself as a magnitude (the magnitude of existence,\ni.e., duration), the relation in time as a series (successively), and\nfinally [the relation] in time as a totality of all existence\n(simultaneously). This unity of time determination is thoroughly\ndynamical; that is, time is not viewed as that in which experience\nimmediately determines the place of an existent, which is impossible,\nbecause absolute time is no object of perception by means of which\nappearances could be bound together; rather, the rule of the\nunderstanding, by means of which alone the existence of the\nappearances can acquire synthetic unity with respect to temporal\nrelations, determines for each [appearance] its position in time, and\nthus [determines this] a priori and valid for each and every time. \nFor Kant, therefore, the temporal relations of duration, succession,\nand simultaneity cannot be viewed as pre-existing, as it were, in an\nabsolute time subsisting prior to and independently of the procedures\nof our pure understanding for determining these relations within the\nappearances themselves. On the contrary, temporal relations as such\nare the products of an empirical construction whereby we objectively\ndetermine the appearances as objects of a unified experience by means\nof the a priori principles of the Analogies. Thus, just as Kant does\nnot view the determination of true motions from apparent motions as\ntaking place within an infinite empty absolute space, he also rejects\nan analogous conception of absolute time and replaces it, too, with a\nprocess of empirical determination taking place within experience\nitself. \nIndeed, there is an intimate relationship between these two procedures\nfor empirical determination—of time and of motion, respectively.\nAt the very beginning of his famous Scholium Newton distinguishes\nbetween “true” and merely “apparent” time\n(Principia, 408):  \nAbsolute, true, and mathematical time, in and of itself and of its own\nnature, without reference to anything external, flows uniformly and by\nanother name is called duration. Relative, apparent, and common time\nis any sensible measure (whether accurate or nonuniform) of duration\nby means of motion: such a measure—for example, an hour, a day,\na month, a year—is commonly used instead of true time.  \nThen, several pages later, Newton illustrates the difference between\n“absolute” and “relative” time with reference\nto the celestial motions studied in astronomy (Principia,\n410): \nIn astronomy, absolute time is distinguished from relative time by the\nequation of common time. For natural days, which are commonly\nconsidered equal for the purpose of measuring time, are actually\nunequal. Astronomers correct this inequality in order to measure\ncelestial motions on the basis of a truer time. It is possible that\nthere is no uniform motion by which time may have an accurate measure.\nAll motions can be accelerated and retarded, but the flow of absolute\ntime cannot be changed. The duration or perseverance of the existence\nof things is the same, whether their motions are rapid or slow or\nnull; accordingly, duration is rightly distinguished from its sensible\nmeasures and is gathered from them by means of an astronomical\nequation. \nNewton is here referring to the standard astronomical procedure,\nalready well-understood in ancient astronomy, whereby we correct the\nordinary measure of time in terms of days, months, and years so as to\nobtain “sidereal” or mean solar time based on the motions\nof the sun relative to both the earth and the fixed\n stars.[42] \nIn the Refutation of Idealism added to the second edition of the\nCritique Kant argues that all empirical determination of\ntime—including determination of the temporal relations among\none’s own inner states—ultimately depends on the\nperception of outer things, and, in particular, on the perception of\nmotion in space (B277–278): \nAll empirical employment of our cognitive faculties in the\ndetermination of time fully agrees with this. It is not only that we\ncan undertake all time determination only by the change of external\nrelations (motion) in relation to the permanent in space (e.g., motion\nof the sun with respect to objects on the earth), but we also have\nnothing at all permanent, which could underlie the concept of a\nsubstance, as intuition, except merely matter, and even this\npermanence is not derived from outer experience, but is rather\npresupposed a priori as necessary condition of all time determination,\nand thus also [of] the determination of inner sense with respect to\nour own existence by means of the existence of outer things. \nIn emphasizing that only matter can instantiate the concept\nof substance here, Kant is alluding to the way in which the\nconservation of the total quantity of matter, in the Metaphysical\nFoundations, realizes the (transcendental) principle of the\nconservation of\n substance.[43]\n Moreover, Kant’s language at B277–278 (we\n“undertake [vornehmen]” time\ndetermination by observing “motion of the sun with respect to\nobjects on the earth”) thereby suggests a progressive empirical\nprocedure in which we begin with our perspective here on earth,\nmeasure the duration of time by the apparent motion of the sun, and\nthen proceed to correct this measure in light of our evolving\nastronomical\n knowledge.[44] \nFor Kant, once again, this need for correction is not an indication of\na pre-existing absolute time subsisting prior to and independently of\nour empirical procedures for determining temporal magnitudes from\nobservable motions. It rather implies that empirically observable\nmotions must be subject to a priori principles of the understanding (a\npriori rules of time determination) in order to count as fully\nobjective experience within a unified, temporally determinate\nobjective world. Applying the relevant principles of the\nunderstanding—the Analogies of Experience—therefore\nresults in a sequence of successive corrections or refinements of our\nordinary temporal experience, as the observable motions are\nprogressively embedded within an increasingly precise and refined\nconception of temporality itself. \nIn the Metaphysical Foundations, in particular, Kant\narticulates a specific realization of the Analogies of Experience in\nterms of the Newtonian theory of universal gravitation. Kant’s\nthree “laws of mechanics” (a version of the Newtonian laws\nof motion: compare notes\n 12\n and\n 32\n above) correspond to the three principles of the Analogies; the\ncategories of substance, causality, and community are realized by the\nsystem of Newtonian massive bodies interacting with one another in the\ncontext of what Newton, in Book III of the Principia, calls\nthe System of the World. The category of substance, that is, is\nrealized by the conservation of the total quantity of matter (mass) in\nall interactions involving these bodies (compare\n note 43\n above, together with the sentence to which it is appended); the\ncategory of causality is realized by the gravitational forces through\nwhich these interactions take place (in accordance with the law of\ninertia); and the category of community is realized by the\ncircumstance that precisely these forces are everywhere mutually\nequal and opposite. The temporal relation of duration is thereby\nrealized by the progressive empirical procedure by which we\nsuccessively correct our ordinary measure of time in light of our\nevolving astronomical knowledge (compare\n note 44\n above, together with the sentence to which it is\n appended).[45]\n The temporal relation of succession is realized by the deterministic\nevolution of the motions of the bodies (masses) in question described\nby the law of universal gravitation (according to which every later\nstate of the system is uniquely determined by its earlier\n states).[46]\n The temporal relation of simultaneity, finally, is realized by the\ncircumstance that gravitational forces instantaneously\nconnect each body in the system with all other\n bodies.[47]\n It is in precisely this sense that the procedure of time\ndetermination Kant describes in the Analogies is intended to replace\nthe conception of a pre-given absolute time. \nWe have now arrived at the most fundamental divergence between Kant\nand Hume concerning causation and induction. For Hume, the order of\ntime is empirically given by the sequence of impressions and ideas\n(and associations among them) which in fact happen to appear before\nthe mind. As Kant explains in the Second Analogy, however, such a\nsequence, from his point of view, is  \nmerely something subjective, and determines no object, and\ncan therefore in no way count as cognition of any object at all (not\neven in the appearance). (A195/B240)  \nFor Kant, it is only the a priori concept of causality (requiring a\nnecessary rule of connection between preceding and succeeding events)\nwhich can then transform a merely subjective temporal sequence into an\nobjective one (ibid.): \nIf we thus experience that something happens, then we always\npresuppose thereby that something precedes on which it follows in\naccordance with a rule. For otherwise I would not say of the object\nthat it follows, because the mere sequence in my apprehension, if it\nis not determined by means of a rule in relation to something\npreceding, justifies no sequence in the object. Therefore, it is\nalways in reference to a rule, in accordance with which the\nappearances in their sequence (i.e., as they happen) are determined\nthrough the previous state, that I make my subjective synthesis (of\napprehension) objective, and, it is solely under this presupposition\nthat even the experience of something happening is possible. \nIt is for precisely this reason, Kant concludes, that mere induction\nalone cannot be the ground for objective causal\nconnections—which presuppose both strict universality and\nnecessity, and therefore must be grounded on a priori concepts and\nprinciples of the pure understanding\n(A195–196/B240–241): \nIt seems, to be sure, that this contradicts all remarks that have\nalways been made concerning the course of the employment of our\nunderstanding, according to which we have only been first guided by\nthe perception and comparison of many concurring sequences of events\nfollowing on certain appearances to discover a rule, in accordance\nwith which certain events always follow on certain appearances, and we\nhave thereby been first prompted to make for ourselves the concept of\ncause. On such a basis this concept would be merely empirical, and the\nrule it supplies, that everything that happens has a cause, would be\njust as contingent as experience itself: its universality and\nnecessity would then be only feigned and would have no true universal\nvalidity, because they would not be grounded a priori but only on\ninduction. \nFor Kant, the concept of cause cannot possibly arise from a mere\nrepetition of resembling constant conjunctions (“concurring\nsequences of events following on certain appearances”) producing\na merely subjective\n custom.[48]\n The procedure by which we apply the concept of cause to experience\ncannot be merely inductive in the Humean sense; it must rather involve\na priori rules of the understanding through which we progressively\ndetermine the objective causal relations between appearances—and\nthereby determine the objective order of succession in time\n itself.[49] \nKant thus has a completely different perspective from Hume’s\nconcerning the uniformity of nature. For Hume, the principle of\nuniformity is a supposition implicit in all of our inductive\ninferences leading to the formulation of laws of nature. If this\nprinciple itself had a foundation in the understanding (in either a\npriori or a posteriori “reasoning”), then so would our\ninductive inferences from observed constant conjunctions to so far\nunobserved events. Yet the supposition in\nquestion—“that instances, of which we have had no\nexperience, must resemble those, of which we have had experience, and\nthat the course of nature continues always uniformly the\nsame” (T 1.3.6.4; SBN 89)—cannot itself be justified\nby either demonstrative or inductive reasoning. In the former case it\nwould have to be self-contradictory to imagine that the course of\nnature is not sufficiently uniform; in the latter the attempted\njustification would be viciously circular. The principle of\nuniformity, however, is firmly based in custom or habit, as a\nuniversal principle of the human mind, and it is also the foundation\nfor the Newtonian inductive method—including Hume’s own\ninductive science of the human mind. Although the principle thus has\nnormative force in all our reasoning concerning matters of fact in\nboth science and common life, it cannot ultimately legitimate the\nattribution of objective necessity to our inductively established laws\nof\n nature.[50] \nKant, in our view, is attempting to provide precisely such a grounding\nof objective necessity by means of the general principle of the\nAnalogies of Experience (B218): “Experience is possible only by\nmeans of the representation of a necessary connection of\nperceptions”. More specifically, the Analogies of Experience\nprovide an a priori conception of the unity and uniformity of\nexperience playing the role, for Kant, of Hume’s principle of\nthe uniformity of nature. According to the Analogies we know a priori\nthat nature in general must consist of interacting substances in space\nand time governed by universally valid and necessary causal laws\ndetermining the temporal relations (of duration, succession, and\nsimultaneity) among all empirical events, and this articulated a\npriori conception of nature in general amounts to the knowledge that\nnature is, in fact, sufficiently\n uniform.[51] \nWe can only have objective experience of particular events, for Kant,\nin so far as we simultaneously construct particular causal relations\namong them step by step, and this is only possible, in turn, in so far\nas we presuppose that they are one and all parts of a unified and\nuniform experience of nature in space and time governed by the\nAnalogies of Experience (together with the other principles of pure\nunderstanding). Moreover, since particular causal relations, for Kant,\nnecessarily involve causal laws, all of our inferences from particular\nperceptions to universal causal laws of nature are grounded in\nsynthetic a priori principles of pure understanding providing a\nsynthetic a priori conception of the unity and uniformity of nature in\ngeneral. Hume was correct, therefore, that the principle of the\nuniformity of nature governs all of our inductive causal inferences;\nand he was also correct that this principle is not and cannot be\nanalytic a priori. What Hume did not see, from Kant’s\npoint of view, is that the merely comparative universality of\ninductive generalization can indeed be overcome by transforming\ninitially merely subjective “empirical rules” into truly\nobjective and necessary “universal laws” in accordance\nwith synthetic but still a priori principles of the unity of\nnature in\n general.[52]","contact.mail":"mlfriedman@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
