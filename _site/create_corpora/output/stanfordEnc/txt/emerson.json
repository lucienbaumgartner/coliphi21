He influenced generations of Americans, from his\nfriend Henry David Thoreau to John Dewey, and in Europe, Friedrich\nNietzsche, who takes up such Emersonian themes as power, fate, the\nuses of poetry and history, and the critique of Christianity.\n\nIn “The American Scholar,” delivered as the Phi Beta Kappa\nAddress in 1837, Emerson maintains that the scholar is educated by\nnature, books, and action. Nature is the first in time (since it is\nalways there) and the first in importance of the three. Nature’s\nvariety conceals underlying laws that are at the same time laws of the\nhuman mind: “the ancient precept, ‘Know thyself,’\nand the modern precept, ‘Study nature,’ become at last one\nmaxim” (CW1: 55). Books, the second component of the\nscholar’s education, offer us the influence of the past. Yet\nmuch of what passes for education is mere idolization of books —\ntransferring the “sacredness which applies to the act of\ncreation…to the record.” The proper relation to books is\nnot that of the “bookworm” or “bibliomaniac,”\nbut that of the “creative” reader (CW1: 58) who uses books\nas a stimulus to attain “his own sight of principles.”\nUsed well, books “inspire…the active soul” (CW1:\n56). Great books are mere records of such inspiration, and their value\nderives only, Emerson holds, from their role in inspiring or recording\nsuch states of the soul. The “end” Emerson finds in nature\nis not a vast collection of books, but, as he puts it in “The\nPoet,” “the production of new individuals,…or the\npassage of the soul into higher forms” (CW3:14) \nThe third component of the scholar’s education is action.\nWithout it, thought “can never ripen into truth” (CW1:\n59). Action is the process whereby what is not fully formed passes\ninto expressive consciousness. Life is the scholar’s\n“dictionary” (CW1: 60), the source for what she has to\nsay: “Only so much do I know as I have lived” (CW1:59).\nThe true scholar speaks from experience, not in imitation of others;\nher words, as Emerson puts it, are “are loaded with\nlife…” (CW1: 59). The scholar’s education in\noriginal experience and self-expression is appropriate, according to\nEmerson, not only for a small class of people, but for everyone. Its\ngoal is the creation of a democratic nation. Only when we learn to\n“walk on our own feet” and to “speak our own\nminds,” he holds, will a nation “for the first time\nexist” (CW1: 70). \nEmerson returned to the topic of education late in his career in\n“Education,” an address he gave in various versions at\ngraduation exercises in the 1860s. Self-reliance appears in the essay\nin his discussion of respect. The “secret of Education,”\nhe states, “lies in respecting the pupil.” It is not for\nthe teacher to choose what the pupil will know and do, but for the\npupil to discover “his own secret.” The teacher must\ntherefore “wait and see the new product of Nature” (E:\n143), guiding and disciplining when appropriate-not with the aim of\nencouraging repetition or imitation, but with that of finding the new\npower that is each child’s gift to the world. The aim of\neducation is to “keep” the child’s “nature and\narm it with knowledge in the very direction in which it points”\n(E: 144). This aim is sacrificed in mass education, Emerson warns.\nInstead of educating “masses,” we must educate\n“reverently, one by one,” with the attitude that\n“the whole world is needed for the tuition of each pupil”\n(E: 154). \nEmerson is in many ways a process philosopher, for whom the universe\nis fundamentally in flux and “permanence is but a word of\ndegrees” (CW 2: 179). Even as he talks of “Being,”\nEmerson represents it not as a stable “wall” but as a\nseries of “interminable oceans” (CW3: 42). This\nmetaphysical position has epistemological correlates: that there is no\nfinal explanation of any fact, and that each law will be incorporated\nin “some more general law presently to disclose itself”\n(CW2: 181). Process is the basis for the succession of moods Emerson\ndescribes in “Experience,” (CW3: 30), and for the emphasis\non the present throughout his philosophy. \nSome of Emerson’s most striking ideas about morality and truth\nfollow from his process metaphysics: that no virtues are final or\neternal, all being “initial,” (CW2: 187); that truth is a\nmatter of glimpses, not steady views. We have a choice, Emerson writes\nin “Intellect,” “between truth and repose,”\nbut we cannot have both (CW2: 202). Fresh truth, like the thoughts of\ngenius, comes always as a surprise, as what Emerson calls “the\nnewness” (CW3: 40). He therefore looks for a “certain\nbrief experience, which surprise[s] me in the highway or in the\nmarket, in some place, at some time…” (CW1: 213). This is\nan experience that cannot be repeated by simply returning to a place\nor to an object such as a painting. A great disappointment of life,\nEmerson finds, is that one can only “see” certain pictures\nonce, and that the stories and people who fill a day or an hour with\npleasure and insight are not able to repeat the performance. \nEmerson’s basic view of religion also coheres with his emphasis\non process, for he holds that one finds God only in the present:\n“God is, not was” (CW1:89). In contrast, what Emerson\ncalls “historical Christianity” (CW1: 82) proceeds\n“as if God were dead” (CW1: 84). Even history, which seems\nobviously about the past, has its true use, Emerson holds, as the\nservant of the present: “The student is to read history actively\nand not passively; to esteem his own life the text, and books the\ncommentary” (CW2: 5). \nEmerson’s views about morality are intertwined with his\nmetaphysics of process, and with his perfectionism, his idea that life\nhas the goal of passing into “higher forms” (CW3:14). The\ngoal remains, but the forms of human life, including the virtues, are\nall “initial” (CW2: 187). The word “initial”\nsuggests the verb “initiate,” and one interpretation of\nEmerson’s claim that “all virtues are initial” is\nthat virtues initiate historically developing forms of life, such as\nthose of the Roman nobility or the Confucian junxi. Emerson\ndoes have a sense of morality as developing historically, but in the\ncontext in “Circles” where his statement appears he\npresses a more radical and skeptical position: that our virtues often\nmust be abandoned rather than developed. “The terror of\nreform,” he writes, “is the discovery that we must cast\naway our virtues, or what we have always esteemed such, into the same\npit that has consumed our grosser vices” (CW2: 187). The\nqualifying phrase “or what we have always esteemed such”\nmeans that Emerson does not embrace an easy relativism, according to\nwhich what is taken to be a virtue at any time must actually be a\nvirtue. Yet he does cast a pall of suspicion over all established\nmodes of thinking and acting. The proper standpoint from which to\nsurvey the virtues is the ‘new moment‘ — what he\nelsewhere calls truth rather than repose (CW2:202) — in which\nwhat once seemed important may appear “trivial” or\n“vain” (CW2:189). From this perspective (or more properly\nthe developing set of such perspectives) the virtues do not disappear,\nbut they may be fundamentally altered and rearranged. \nAlthough Emerson is thus in no position to set forth a system of\nmorality, he nevertheless delineates throughout his work a set of\nvirtues and heroes, and a corresponding set of vices and villains. In\n“Circles” the vices are “forms of old age,”\nand the hero the “receptive, aspiring” youth (CW2:189). In\nthe “Divinity School Address,” the villain is the\n“spectral” preacher whose sermons offer no hint that he\nhas ever lived. “Self Reliance” condemns virtues that are\nreally “penances” (CW2: 31), and the philanthropy of\nabolitionists who display an idealized “love” for those\nfar away, but are full of hatred for those close by (CW2: 30). \nConformity is the chief Emersonian vice, the opposite or\n“aversion” of the virtue of “self-reliance.”\nWe conform when we pay unearned respect to clothing and other symbols\nof status, when we show “the foolish face of praise” or\nthe “forced smile which we put on in company where we do not\nfeel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest\nus” (CW2: 32). Emerson criticizes our conformity even to our own\npast actions-when they no longer fit the needs or aspirations of the\npresent. This is the context in which he states that “a foolish\nconsistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little\nstatesmen, philosophers and divines” (CW2: 33). There is wise\nand there is foolish consistency, and it is foolish to be consistent\nif that interferes with the “main enterprise of the world for\nsplendor, for extent,…the upbuilding of a man” (CW1:\n65). \nIf Emerson criticizes much of human life, he nevertheless devotes most\nof his attention to the virtues. Chief among these is what he calls\n“self-reliance.” The phrase connotes originality and\nspontaneity, and is memorably represented in the image of a group of\nnonchalant boys, “sure of a dinner…who would disdain as\nmuch as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one…” The\nboys sit in judgment on the world and the people in it, offering a\nfree, “irresponsible” condemnation of those they see as\n“silly” or “troublesome,” and praise for those\nthey find “interesting” or “eloquent.” (CW2:\n29). The figure of the boys illustrates Emerson’s characteristic\ncombination of the romantic (in the glorification of children) and the\nclassical (in the idea of a hierarchy in which the boys occupy the\nplace of lords or nobles). \nAlthough he develops a series of analyses and images of self-reliance,\nEmerson nevertheless destabilizes his own use of the concept.\n“To talk of reliance,” he writes, “is a poor\nexternal way of speaking. Speak rather of that which relies, because\nit works and is” (CW 2:40). ‘Self-reliance’ can be\ntaken to mean that there is a self already formed on which we may\nrely. The “self” on which we are to “rely” is,\nin contrast, the original self that we are in the process of creating.\nSuch a self, to use a phrase from Nietzsche’s Ecce Homo,\n“becomes what it is.” \nFor Emerson, the best human relationships require the confident and\nindependent nature of the self-reliant. Emerson’s ideal society\nis a confrontation of powerful, independent “gods, talking from\npeak to peak all round Olympus.” There will be a proper distance\nbetween these gods, who, Emerson advises, “should meet each\nmorning, as from foreign countries, and spending the day together\nshould depart, as into foreign countries” (CW 3:81). Even\n“lovers,” he advises, “should guard their\nstrangeness” (CW3: 82). Emerson portrays himself as preserving\nsuch distance in the cool confession with which he closes\n“Nominalist and Realist,” the last of the Essays,\nSecond Series: \nThe self-reliant person will “publish” her results, but\nshe must first learn to detect that spark of originality or genius\nthat is her particular gift to the world. It is not a gift that is\navailable on demand, however, and a major task of life is to meld\ngenius with its expression. “The man,” Emerson states\n“is only half himself, the other half is his expression”\n(CW 3:4). There are young people of genius, Emerson laments in\n“Experience,” who promise “a new world” but\nnever deliver: they fail to find the focus for their genius\n“within the actual horizon of human life” (CW 3:31).\nAlthough Emerson emphasizes our independence and even distance from\none another, then, the payoff for self-reliance is public and social.\nThe scholar finds that the most private and secret of his thoughts\nturn out to be “the most acceptable, most public, and\nuniversally true” (CW1: 63). And the great “representative\nmen” Emerson identifies are marked by their influence on the\nworld. Their names-Plato, Moses, Jesus, Luther, Copernicus, even\nNapoleon-are “ploughed into the history of this world”\n(CW1: 80). \nAlthough self-reliance is central, it is not the only Emersonian\nvirtue. Emerson also praises a kind of trust, and the practice of a\n“wise skepticism.” There are times, he holds, when we must\nlet go and trust to the nature of the universe: “As the traveler\nwho has lost his way, throws his reins on his horse’s neck, and\ntrusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road, so must we do\nwith the divine animal who carries us through this world”\n(CW3:16). But the world of flux and conflicting evidence also requires\na kind of epistemological and practical flexibility that Emerson calls\n“wise skepticism” (CW4: 89). His representative skeptic of\nthis sort is Michel de Montaigne, who as portrayed in\nRepresentative Men is no unbeliever, but a man with a strong\nsense of self, rooted in the earth and common life, whose quest is for\nknowledge. He wants “a near view of the best game and the chief\nplayers; what is best in the planet; art and nature, places and\nevents; but mainly men” (CW4: 91). Yet he knows that life is\nperilous and uncertain, “a storm of many elements,” the\nnavigation through which requires a flexible ship, “fit to the\nform of man.” (CW4: 91). \nThe son of a Unitarian minister, Emerson attended Harvard Divinity\nSchool and was employed as a minister for almost three years. Yet he\noffers a deeply felt and deeply reaching critique of Christianity in\nthe “Divinity School Address,” flowing from a line of\nargument he establishes in “The American Scholar.” If the\none thing in the world of value is the active soul, then religious\ninstitutions, no less than educational institutions, must be judged by\nthat standard. Emerson finds that contemporary Christianity deadens\nrather than activates the spirit. It is an “Eastern monarchy of\na Christianity” in which Jesus, originally the “friend of\nman,” is made the enemy and oppressor of man. A Christianity\ntrue to the life and teachings of Jesus should inspire “the\nreligious sentiment” — a joyous seeing that is more likely\nto be found in “the pastures,” or “a boat in the\npond” than in a church. Although Emerson thinks it is a calamity\nfor a nation to suffer the “loss of worship” (CW1: 89) he\nfinds it strange that, given the “famine of our churches”\n(CW1: 85) anyone should attend them. He therefore calls on the\nDivinity School graduates to breathe new life into the old forms of\ntheir religion, to be friends and exemplars to their parishioners, and\nto remember “that all men have sublime thoughts; that all men\nvalue the few real hours of life; they love to be heard; they love to\nbe caught up into the vision of principles” (CW1: 90). \nPower is a theme in Emerson’s early writing, but it becomes\nespecially prominent in such middle- and late-career essays as\n“Experience,” “Montaigne, or the Skeptic”\n“Napoleon,” and “Power.” Power is related to\naction in “The American Scholar,” where Emerson holds that\na “true scholar grudges every opportunity of action past by, as\na loss of power” (CW1: 59). It is also a subject of\n“Self-Reliance,” where Emerson writes of each person that\n“the power which resides in him is new in nature” (CW2:\n28). In “Experience” Emerson speaks of a life which\n“is not intellectual or critical, but sturdy” (CW3: 294);\nand in “Power” he celebrates the “bruisers”\n(CW6: 34) of the world who express themselves rudely and get their\nway. The power in which Emerson is interested, however, is more\nartistic and intellectual than political or military. In a\ncharacteristic passage from “Power,” he states: \nPower is all around us, but it cannot always be controlled. It is like\n“a bird which alights nowhere,” hopping “perpetually\nfrom bough to bough” (CW3: 34). Moreover, we often cannot tell\nat the time when we exercise our power that we are doing so: happily\nwe sometimes find that much is accomplished in “times when we\nthought ourselves indolent” (CW3: 28). \nAt some point in many of his essays and addresses, Emerson enunciates,\nor at least refers to, a great vision of unity. He speaks in\n“The American Scholar” of an “original unit”\nor “fountain of power” (CW1: 53), of which each of us is a\npart. He writes in “The Divinity School Address” that each\nof us is “an inlet into the deeps of Reason.” And in\n“Self-Reliance,” the essay that more than any other\ncelebrates individuality, he writes of “the resolution of all\ninto the ever-blessed ONE” (CW2: 40). “The Oversoul”\nis Emerson’s most sustained discussion of “the ONE,”\nbut he does not, even there, shy away from the seeming conflict\nbetween the reality of process and the reality of an ultimate\nmetaphysical unity. How can the vision of succession and the vision of\nunity be reconciled? \nEmerson never comes to a clear or final answer. One solution he both\nsuggests and rejects is an unambiguous idealism, according to which a\nnontemporal “One” or “Oversoul” is the only\nreality, and all else is illusion. He suggests this, for example, in\nthe many places where he speaks of waking up out of our dreams or\nnightmares. But he then portrays that to which we awake not simply as\nan unchanging “ONE,” but as a process or succession: a\n“growth” or “movement of the soul” (CW2: 189);\nor a “new yet unapproachable America” (CW3: 259). \nEmerson undercuts his visions of unity (as of everything else) through\nwhat Stanley Cavell calls his “epistemology of moods.”\nAccording to this epistemology, most fully developed in\n“Experience” but present in all of Emerson’s\nwriting, we never apprehend anything “straight” or\nin-itself, but only under an aspect or mood. Emerson writes that life\nis “a train of moods like a string of beads,” through\nwhich we see only what lies in each bead’s focus (CW3: 30). The\nbeads include our temperaments, our changing moods, and the\n“Lords of Life” which govern all human experience. The\nLords include “Succession,” “Surface,”\n“Dream,” “Reality,” and\n“Surprise.” Are the great visions of unity, then, simply\naspects under which we view the world? \nEmerson’s most direct attempt to reconcile succession and unity,\nor the one and the many, occurs in the last essay in the Essays,\nSecond Series, entitled “Nominalist and Realist.”\nThere he speaks of the universe as an “old Two-face…of\nwhich any proposition may be affirmed or denied” (CW3: 144). As\nin “Experience,” Emerson leaves us with the whirling\nsuccession of moods. “I am always insincere,” he\nskeptically concludes, “as always knowing there are other\nmoods” (CW3: 145). But Emerson enacts as well as describes the\nsuccession of moods, and he ends “Nominalist and Realist”\nwith the “feeling that all is yet unsaid,” and with at\nleast the idea of some universal truth (CW3: 363). \nEmerson routinely invites charges of inconsistency. He says the world\nis fundamentally a process and fundamentally a unity; that it resists\nthe imposition of our will and that it flows with the power of our\nimagination; that travel is good for us, since it adds to our\nexperience, and that it does us no good, since we wake up in the new\nplace only to find the same “ sad self” we thought we had\nleft behind (CW2: 46). \nEmerson’s “epistemology of moods” is an attempt to\nconstruct a framework for encompassing what might otherwise seem\ncontradictory outlooks, viewpoints, or doctrines. Emerson really means\nto “accept,” as he puts it, “the clangor and jangle\nof contrary tendencies” (CW3: 36). He means to be irresponsible\nto all that holds him back from his self-development. That is why, at\nthe end of “Circles,” he writes that he is “only an\nexperimenter…with no Past at my back” (CW2: 188). In the\nworld of flux that he depicts in that essay, there is nothing stable\nto be responsible to: “every moment is new; the past is always\nswallowed and forgotten, the coming only is sacred” (CW2:\n189). \nDespite this claim, there is considerable consistency in\nEmerson’s essays and among his ideas. To take just one example,\nthe idea of the “active soul” – mentioned as the\n“one thing in the world, of value” in ‘The American\nScholar’ – is a presupposition of Emerson’s attack\non “the famine of the churches” (for not feeding or\nactivating the souls of those who attend them); it is an element in\nhis understanding of a poem as “a thought so passionate and\nalive, that, like the spirit of a plant or an animal, it has an\narchitecture of its own …” (CW3: 6); and, of course, it\nis at the center of Emerson’s idea of self-reliance. There are\nin fact multiple paths of coherence through Emerson’s\nphilosophy, guided by ideas discussed previously: process, education,\nself-reliance, and the present. \nIt is hard for an attentive reader not to feel that there are\nimportant differences between early and late Emerson: for example,\nbetween the buoyant Nature (1836) and the weary ending of\n“Experience” (1844); between the expansive author of\n“Self-Reliance” (1841) and the burdened writer of\n“Fate” (1860). Emerson himself seems to advert to such\ndifferences when he writes in “Fate”: “Once we\nthought, positive power was all. Now we learn that negative power, or\ncircumstance, is half” (CW6: 8). Is “Fate” the\nrecord of a lesson Emerson had not absorbed in his early writing,\nconcerning the multiple ways in which circumstances over which we have\nno control — plagues, hurricanes, temperament, sexuality, old\nage — constrain self-reliance or self-development? \n“Experience” is a key transitional essay. “Where do\nwe find ourselves?” is the question with which it begins. The\nanswer is not a happy one, for Emerson finds that we occupy a place of\ndislocation and obscurity, where “sleep lingers all our lifetime\nabout our eyes, as night hovers all day in the boughs of the\nfir-tree” (CW3: 27). An event hovering over the essay, but not\ndisclosed until its third paragraph, is the death of his five-year old\nson Waldo. Emerson finds in this episode and his reaction to it an\nexample of an “unhandsome” general character of\nexistence-it is forever slipping away from us, like his little\nboy. \n“Experience” presents many moods. It has its moments of\nillumination, and its considered judgment that there is an\n“Ideal journeying always with us, the heaven without rent or\nseam” (CW3: 41). It offers wise counsel about “skating\nover the surfaces of life” and confining our existence to the\n“mid-world.” But even its upbeat ending takes place in a\nsetting of substantial “defeat.” “Up again, old\nheart!” a somewhat battered voice states in the last sentence of\nthe essay. Yet the essay ends with an assertion that in its great hope\nand underlying confidence chimes with some of the more expansive\npassages in Emerson’s writing. The “true romance which the\nworld exists to realize,” he states, “will be the\ntransformation of genius into practical power” (CW3: 49). \nDespite important differences in tone and emphasis, Emerson’s\nassessment of our condition remains much the same throughout his\nwriting. There are no more dire indictments of ordinary human life\nthan in the early work, “The American Scholar,” where\nEmerson states that “Men in history, men in the world of to-day,\nare bugs, are spawn, and are called ‘the mass’ and\n‘the herd.’ In a century, in a millennium, one or two men;\nthat is to say, one or two approximations to the right state of every\nman” (CW1: 65). Conversely, there is no more idealistic\nstatement in his early work than the statement in “Fate”\nthat “[t]hought dissolves the material universe, by carrying the\nmind up into a sphere where all is plastic” (CW6: 15). All in\nall, the earlier work expresses a sunnier hope for human\npossibilities, the sense that Emerson and his contemporaries were\npoised for a great step forward and upward; and the later work, still\nhopeful and assured, operates under a weight or burden, a stronger\nsense of the dumb resistance of the world. \nEmerson read widely, and gave credit in his essays to the scores of\nwriters from whom he learned. He kept lists of literary,\nphilosophical, and religious thinkers in his journals and worked at\ncategorizing them. \nAmong the most important writers for the shape of Emerson’s\nphilosophy are Plato and the Neoplatonist line extending through\nPlotinus, Proclus, Iamblichus, and the Cambridge Platonists. Equally\nimportant are writers in the Kantian and Romantic traditions (which\nEmerson probably learned most about from Coleridge’s\nBiographia Literaria). Emerson read avidly in Indian,\nespecially Hindu, philosophy, and in Confucianism. There are also\nmultiple empiricist, or experience-based influences, flowing from\nBerkeley, Wordsworth and other English Romantics, Newton’s\nphysics, and the new sciences of geology and comparative anatomy.\nOther writers whom Emerson often mentions are Anaxagoras, St.\nAugustine, Francis Bacon, Jacob Behmen, Cicero, Goethe, Heraclitus,\nLucretius, Mencius, Pythagoras, Schiller, Thoreau, August and\nFriedrich Schlegel, Shakespeare, Socrates, Madame de Staël and\nEmanuel Swedenborg. \nEmerson’s works were well known throughout the United States and\nEurope in his day. Nietzsche read German translations of\nEmerson’s essays, copied passages from “History” and\n“Self-Reliance” in his journals, and wrote of the\nEssays: that he had never “felt so much at home in a\nbook.” Emerson’s ideas about “strong,\noverflowing” heroes, friendship as a battle, education, and\nrelinquishing control in order to gain it, can be traced in\nNietzsche’s writings. Other Emersonian ideas-about transition,\nthe ideal in the commonplace, and the power of human will permeate the\nwritings of such classical American pragmatists as William James and\nJohn Dewey. \nStanley Cavell’s engagement with Emerson is the most original\nand prolonged by any philosopher, and Emerson is a primary source for\nhis writing on “moral perfectionism.” In his earliest\nessays on Emerson, such as “Thinking of Emerson” and\n“Emerson, Coleridge, Kant,” Cavell considers\nEmerson’s place in the Kantian tradition, and he explores the\naffinity between Emerson’s call in “The American\nScholar” for a return to “the common and the low”\nand Wittgenstein’s quest for a return to ordinary language. In\n“Being Odd, Getting Even” and “Aversive\nThinking,” Cavell considers Emerson’s anticipations of\nexistentialism, and in these and other works he explores\nEmerson’s affinities with Nietzsche and Heidegger. \nIn Conditions Handsome and Unhandsome (CHU) and Cities of\nWords, Cavell develops what he calls “Emersonian moral\nperfectionism,” of which he finds an exemplary expression in\nEmerson’s “History”: “So all that is said of\nthe wise man by Stoic, or oriental or modern essayist, describes to\neach reader his own idea, describes his unattained but attainable\nself.” Emersonian perfectionism is oriented towards a wiser or\nbetter self that is never final, always initial, always on the\nway. \nCavell does not have a neat and tidy definition of perfectionism, and\nhis list of perfectionist works ranges from Plato’s\nRepublic to Wittgenstein’s Philosophical\nInvestigations, but he identifies “two dominating themes of\nperfectionism” in Emerson’s writing: (1) “that the\nhuman self … is always becoming, as on a journey, always\npartially in a further state. This journey is described as education\nor cultivation”; (2) “that the other to whom I can use the\nwords I discover in which to express myself is the Friend—a\nfigure that may occur as the goal of the journey but also as its\ninstigation and accompaniment” (Cities of Words,\n26–7). The friend can be a person but it may also be a text. In\nthe sentence from “History” cited above, the writing of\nthe “Stoic, or oriental or modern essayist” about\n“the wise man” functions as a friend and guide, describing\nto each reader not just any idea, but “his own idea.” This\nis the text as instigator and companion. \nCavell’s engagement with perfectionism springs from a response\nto his colleague John Rawls, who in A Theory of Justice\ncondemns Nietzsche (and implicitly Emerson) for his statement that\n“mankind must work continually to produce individual great human\nbeings.” “Perfectionism,” Rawls states, “is\ndenied as a political principle.” Cavell replies that\nEmerson’s (and Nietzsche’s) focus on the great man has\nnothing to do with a transfer of economic resources or political\npower, or with the idea that “there is a separate class of great\nmen …for whose good, and conception of good, the rest of\nsociety is to live” (CHU, 49). The great man or woman, Cavell\nholds, is required for rather than opposed to democracy:\n“essential to the criticism of democracy from within”\n(CHU, 3).","contact.mail":"rgoodman@unm.edu","contact.domain":"unm.edu"}]
