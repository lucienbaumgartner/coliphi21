The first group are sometimes called\nrealists. The second group are pacifists. The task of just war theory\nis to seek a middle path between them: to justify at least some wars,\nbut also to limit them (Ramsey 1961). Although realism undoubtedly has\nits adherents, few philosophers find it\n compelling.[2]\n The real challenge to just war theory comes from pacifism. And we\nshould remember, from the outset, that this challenge is real. The\njustified war might well be a chimera.\n\n\nHowever, this entry explores the middle path between realism and\npacifism. It begins by outlining the central substantive divide in\ncontemporary just war theory, before introducing the methodological\nschisms underpinning that debate. It then discusses the moral evaluation\nof wars as a whole, and of individual acts within war (traditionally,\nthough somewhat misleadingly, called jus ad bellum and\njus in bello respectively). \n\n\n\n\nContemporary just war theory is dominated by two camps: traditionalist\nand\n revisionist.[3]\n The traditionalists might as readily be called legalists. Their views\non the morality of war are substantially led by international law,\nespecially the law of armed conflict. They aim to provide those laws\nwith morally defensible foundations. States (and only states) are\npermitted to go to war only for national defence, defence of other\nstates, or to intervene to avert “crimes that shock the moral\nconscience of mankind” (Walzer 2006: 107). Civilians may not be\ntargeted in war, but all combatants, whatever they are fighting for,\nare morally permitted to target one another, even when doing so\nforeseeably harms some civilians (so long as it does not do so\n excessively).[4] \nRevisionists question the moral standing of states and the\npermissibility of national defence, argue for expanded permissions for\nhumanitarian intervention, problematise civilian immunity, and contend\nthat combatants fighting for wrongful aims cannot do anything right,\nbesides lay down their weapons. \nMost revisionists are moral revisionists only: they deny that\nthe contemporary law of armed conflict is intrinsically morally\njustified, but believe, mostly for pragmatic reasons, that it need not\nbe substantially changed. Some, however, are both morally and legally\nrevisionist. And even moral revisionists’ disagreement with the\ntraditionalists is hardly ersatz: most believe that, faced with a\nclash between what is morally and what is legally permitted or\nprohibited, individuals should follow their conscience rather than the\n law.[5] \nThe traditionalist view received its most prominent exposition the\nsame year as it was decisively codified in international law, in the\nfirst additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions. Michael\nWalzer’s Just and Unjust Wars, first published in 1977,\nhas been extraordinarily influential among philosophers, political\nscientists, international lawyers, and military practitioners. Among\nits key contributions were its defence of central traditionalist\npositions on national defence, humanitarian intervention,\ndiscrimination, and combatant equality. \nEarly revisionists challenged Walzer’s views on national defence\n(Luban 1980a) and humanitarian intervention (Luban 1980b). Revisionist\ncriticism of combatant equality and discrimination followed (Holmes\n1989; McMahan 1994; Norman 1995). Since then there has been an\nexplosion of revisionist rebuttals of Walzer (for example Rodin 2002;\nMcMahan 2004b; McPherson 2004; Arneson 2006; Fabre 2009; McMahan 2009;\nFabre 2012). \nConcurrently, many philosophers welcomed Walzer’s conclusions,\nbut rejected his arguments. They have accordingly sought firmer\nfoundations for broadly traditionalist positions on national defence\n(Benbaji 2014; Moore 2014), humanitarian intervention (Coady 2002),\ndiscrimination (Rodin 2008b; Dill and Shue 2012; Lazar 2015c), and\nespecially combatant equality (Zohar 1993; Kutz 2005; Benbaji 2008;\nShue 2008; Steinhoff 2008; Emerton and Handfield 2009; Benbaji\n2011). \nWe will delve deeper into these debates in what follows. First,\nthough, some methodological groundwork. Traditionalists and\nrevisionists alike often rely on methodological or second-order\npremises, to the extent that one might think that the first-order\nquestions are really just proxy battles through which they work out\ntheir deeper disagreements (Lazar and Valentini forthcoming). \nFor the sake of concision this entry discusses only contemporary analytical\nphilosophers working on war. Readers are directed to the excellent work\nof philosophers and intellectual historians such as Greg Reichberg,\nPablo Kalmanovitz, Daniel Schwartz, and Rory Cox to gain further\ninsights about historical just war theory (see, in particular, Cox\n2016; Kalmanovitz 2016; Reichberg 2016; Schwartz 2016). \nWithin contemporary analytical philosophy, there are two different\nways in which moral and political philosophers think about war (Lazar\nand Valentini forthcoming). On the first, institutionalist,\napproach, philosophers’ primary goal is to establish what the\ninstitutions regulating war should be. In particular, we should\nprescribe morally justified laws of war. We then tell individuals and\ngroups that they ought to follow those laws. On the second approach,\nwe should focus first on the moral reasons that apply directly to\nindividual and group actions, without the mediating factor of\ninstitutions. We tell individuals and groups to act as their moral\nreasons dictate. Since this approach focuses not on the institutions\nthat govern our interactions, but on those interactions themselves, we\nwill call it the “interactional”\n approach.[6] \nIn general, the institutionalist approach is favoured by indirect\nconsequentialists and contractualists. Indirect consequentialists\nbelieve these institutions are justified just in case they will in\nfact have better long-run results than any feasible alternative\ninstitutions (see Mavrodes 1975; Dill and Shue 2012; Shue 2013;\nWaldron 2016). Contractualists believe these institutions ground or\nreflect either an actual or a hypothetical contract among states\nand/or their citizens, which specifies the terms of their interaction\nin war (see Benbaji 2008, 2011, 2014; Statman 2014). \nNon-contractualist deontologists and direct- or act-consequentialists\ntend to prefer the interactional approach. Their central question is:\nwhat moral reasons bear directly on the permissibility of killing in\nwar? This focus on killing might seem myopic—war involves much\nmore violence and destruction than the killing alone. However,\ntypically this is just a heuristic device; since we typically think of\nkilling as the most presumptively wrongful kind of harm, whatever\narguments one identifies that justify killing are likely also to\njustify lesser wrongs. And if the killing that war involves cannot be\njustified, then we should endorse pacifism. \nAny normative theory of war should pay attention both to what the laws\nof war should be, and to what we morally ought to do. These are two\ndistinct but equally important questions. And they entail the\nimportance of a third: what ought we to do all things considered, for\nexample when law and morality conflict? Too much recent just war\ntheory has focused on arguing that philosophical attention should be\nreserved to one of the first two of these questions (Buchanan 2006;\nShue 2008, 2010; Rodin 2011b). Not enough has concentrated on the\nthird (though see McMahan 2008; Lazar 2012a). \nAlthough this entry touches on the first question, it focuses on the\nsecond. Addressing the first requires detailed empirical research and\npragmatic political speculation, both of which are beyond my remit\nhere.  Addressing the third takes us too deep into the minutiae of\ncontemporary just war theory for an encyclopaedia entry. \nWhat’s more, even institutionalists need some answer to the\nsecond question—and so some account of the interactional\nmorality of war. Rule-consequentialists need an account of the good\n(bad) that they are hoping that the ideal laws of war will maximise\n(minimise) in the long run. This means, for example, deciding whether\nto aim to minimise all harm, or only to minimise wrongful harm. The\nlatter course is much more plausible—we wouldn’t want laws\nof war that, for example, licensed genocide just in case doing so\nleads to fewer deaths overall. But to follow this course, we need to\nknow which harms are (extra-institutionally) wrongful. Similarly,\ncontractualists typically acknowledge various constraints on the kinds\nof rules that could form the basis of a legitimate contract, which,\nagain, we cannot work out without thinking about the\nextra-institutional morality of war (Benbaji 2011). \nEven within interactional just war theory, several second-order\ndisagreements underscore first-order disputes. First: when thinking\nabout the ethics of war, what kinds of cases should we use to test our\nintuitions and our principles? We can start by thinking about actual\nwars and realistic wartime scenarios, paying attention to\ninternational affairs and military history. Or, more clinically, we\ncan construct hypothetical cases to isolate variables and test their\nimpact on our intuitions. \nSome early revisionists relied heavily on highly artificial cases\n(e.g., McMahan 1994; Rodin 2002). They were criticized for this by\ntraditionalists, who generally use more empirically-informed examples\n(Walzer 2006). But one’s standpoint on the substantive questions\nat issue between traditionalists and revisionists need not be\npredetermined by one’s methodology. Revisionists can pay close\nattention to actual conflicts (e.g., Fabre 2012). Traditionalists can\nuse artificial hypotheticals (e.g., Emerton and Handfield 2009; Lazar\n2013). \nAbstraction forestalls unhelpful disputes over historical details. It\nalso reduces bias—we are inclined to view actual conflicts\nthrough the lens of our own political allegiances. But it also has\ncosts. We should be proportionately less confident of our intuitions\nthe more removed the test case is from our lived experience.\nPhilosophers’ scenarios involving mind-control, armed\npedestrians, trolleys, meteorites, and incredibly complicated causal\nsequences are pure exercises in imagination. How can we trust our\njudgements about such cases more than we trust our views on actual,\nrealistic scenarios? What’s more, abandoning the harrowing\nexperience of war for sanitized hypothetical cases might be not merely\nepistemically unsound, but also disrespectful of the victims of war.\nLastly, cleaned-up examples often omit morally relevant\ndetails—for instance, assuming that everyone has all the\ninformation relevant to their choice, rather than acknowledging the\n“fog of war”, and making no allowances for fear or\ntrauma. \nArtificial hypotheticals have their place, but any conclusions they\nsupport must be tested against the messy reality of war. What’s\nmore, our intuitive judgements should be the starting-point for\ninvestigation, rather than its end. \nThe second divide is related to the first. Reductivists think\nthat killing in war must be justified by the same properties that\njustify killing outside of war. Non-reductivists, sometimes\ncalled exceptionalists, think that some properties justify\nkilling in war that do not justify killing outside of\n war.[7]\n Most exceptionalists think that specific features of killing in war\nmake it morally different from killing in ordinary life—for\nexample, the scale of the conflict, widespread and egregious\nnon-compliance with fundamental moral norms, the political interests\nat stake, the acute uncertainty, the existence of the law of armed\nconflict, or the fact that the parties to the conflict are organized\ngroups. A paradigm reductivist, by contrast, might argue\nthat justified wars are mere aggregates of justified acts of\nindividual self- and other-defence (see Rodin 2002; McMahan 2004a). \nReductivists are much more likely to use far-fetched hypothetical\ncases, since they think there is nothing special about warfare. The\nopposite is true for exceptionalists. Walzer’s first critics\nrelied on reductivist premises to undermine the principles of national\ndefence (Luban 1980a; Rodin 2002), discrimination (Holmes 1989;\nMcMahan 1994), and combatant equality (Holmes 1989; McMahan 1994).\nMany traditionalists replied by rejecting reductivism, arguing that\nthere is something special about war that justifies a divergence from\nthe kinds of judgements that are appropriate to other kinds of\nconflict (Zohar 1993; Kutz 2005; Benbaji 2008; Dill and Shue 2012).\nAgain, some philosophers buck these overarching trends (for\nreductivist traditionalist arguments, see e.g., Emerton and Handfield\n2009; Lazar 2015c; Haque 2017; for non-reductivist revisionist\narguments, see e.g., Ryan 2016). \nThe debate between reductivism and exceptionalism is\noverblown—the concept of “war” is vague, and while\ntypical wars involve properties that are not instantiated in typical\nconflicts outside of war, we can always come up with far-fetched\nhypotheticals that don’t involve those properties, which we\nwouldn’t call “wars”. But this masks a deeper\nmethodological disagreement: when thinking about the morality of war,\nshould we start by thinking about war, or by thinking about the\npermissible use of force outside of war? Should we model justified\nkilling in war on justified killing outside of war? Or, in focusing on\nthe justification of killing in war, might we then discover that there\nare some non-canonical cases of permissible killing outside of war? My\nown view is that thinking about justified killing outside of war has\nits place, but must be complemented by thinking about war\ndirectly. \nNext, we can distinguish between individualists and collectivists; and\nwe can subdivide them further into evaluative and\ndescriptive categories. Evaluative individualists think that\na collective’s moral significance is wholly reducible to its\ncontribution to the well-being of the individuals who compose it.\nEvaluative collectivists think that collectives can matter\nindependently of how they contribute to individual well-being.\nDescriptive individualists think that any act that might appear to be\ncollective is reducible to component acts by individuals. Descriptive\ncollectivists deny this, thinking that some acts are irreducibly\n collective.[8] \nAgain, the dialectic of contemporary just war theory involves\nrevisionists first arguing that we cannot vindicate traditionalist\npositions on descriptively and evaluatively individualist grounds,\nwith some traditionalists then responding by rejecting descriptive\n(Kutz 2005; Walzer 2006; Lazar 2012b) and evaluative individualism\n(Zohar 1993). And again there are outliers—individualist\ntraditionalists (e.g., Emerton and Handfield 2009) and collectivist\nrevisionists (e.g., Bazargan 2013). \nUnlike the reductivist/exceptionalist divide, the\nindividualist/collectivist split cannot be resolved by thinking about\nthe morality of war on its own. War is a useful test case for theories\nof collective action and the value of collectives, but no more than\nthat. Intuitions about war are no substitute for a theory of\ncollective action. Perhaps some collectives have value beyond their\ncontribution to the well-being of their members. For example, they\nmight instantiate justice, or solidarity, which can be impersonally\nvaluable (Temkin 1993). It is doubtful, however, that groups have\ninterests independent from the well-being of their members.\nOn the descriptive side, even if we can reduce collective actions to\nthe actions of individual members, this probably involves such\ncomplicated contortions that we should seriously question whether it\nis worth doing (Lazar 2012b). \nTraditionally, just war theorists divide their enquiry into reflection\non the resort to war—jus ad bellum—and conduct in\nwar—jus in bello. More recently, they have added an\naccount of permissible action post-war, or jus post bellum.\nOthers suggest an independent focus on war exit, which they have\nvariously called jus ex bello and jus terminatio\n(Moellendorf 2008; Rodin 2008a). These Latin labels, though\nunfortunately obscurantist, serve as a useful shorthand. When we refer\nto ad bellum justice, we mean to evaluate the permissibility\nof the war as a whole. This is particularly salient when deciding to\nlaunch the war. But it is also crucial for the decision to continue\nfighting. Jus ex bello, then, fits within jus ad\nbellum. The jus in bello denotes the permissibility of\nparticular actions that compose the war, short of the war as a\nwhole. \nTraditional just war theory construes jus ad bellum and\njus in bello as sets of principles, satisfying which is\nnecessary and sufficient for a war’s being permissible. Jus\nad bellum typically comprises the following six principles: \nTypically the jus in bello list comprises: \nThese all matter to the ethics of war, and will be addressed below.\nHowever, it is unhelpful to view them as a checklist of necessary and\nsufficient conditions. When they are properly understood, only\nproportionality and necessity (in the guise of last resort in the\njus ad bellum) are necessary conditions for a war, or an act\nin a war, to be permissible, since no matter how badly going to war\nfails the other ad bellum criteria (for example) it might\nstill be permissible because it is the least awful of one’s\nalternatives, and so satisfies the necessity and proportionality\nconstraints. \nTo get an intuitive grasp on necessity and proportionality, note that\nif someone threatens my life, then killing her would be proportionate;\nbut if I could stop her by knocking her out, then killing her would be\nunnecessary, and so impermissible. The necessity and proportionality\nconstraints have the same root: with few exceptions (perhaps when it\nis deserved), harm is intrinsically bad. Harms (and indeed all bads)\nthat we cause must therefore be justified by some positive reason that\ncounts in their favour—such as good achieved or evil averted\n(Lazar 2012a). Both the necessity and proportionality constraints\ninvolve comparing the bads caused by an action with the goods that it\nachieves. They differ only in the kinds of options they compare. \nThe use of force is proportionate when the harm done is\ncounterbalanced by the good achieved in averting a threat. To\ndetermine this, we typically compare the candidate course of action\nwith what would happen if we allowed the threat to eventuate. \nOf course, in most cases we will have more than one means of averting\nor mitigating the threat. And a harmful option can be permissible only\nif all the harm that it involves is justified by a\ncorresponding good achieved. If some alternative would as successfully\navert the threat, but cause less harm, then the more harmful option is\nimpermissible, because it involves unnecessary harm. \nWhere an option O aims to avert a threat T, we determine\nO’s necessity by comparing it with all the other options\nthat will either mitigate or avert T. We determine its\nproportionality by comparing it with the harm suffered if T\nshould come about. The only difference between the proportionality and\nnecessity constraints is that the former involves comparing\none’s action with a very specific counterfactual\nscenario—in which we don’t act to avert the\nthreat—while the latter involves comparing it with all your\navailable options that have some prospect of averting or mitigating\nthe threat. In my view, we should simply expand this so that the\nnecessity constraint compares all your available options bar none.\nThen proportionality would essentially involve comparing each option\nwith the alternative of doing nothing, while necessity would involve\ncomparing all options (including doing nothing) in terms of their\nrespective balances of goods and bads. On this approach, necessity\nwould subsume proportionality. But this is a technical point with\nlittle substantive payoff. \nMore substantively, necessity and proportionality judgements concern\nconsequences, and yet they are typically made ex ante, before\nwe know what the results of our actions will be. They must therefore\nbe modified to take this uncertainty into account. The most obvious\nsolution is simply to refer to expected threats and\nexpected harms, where the expected harm of an option O\nis the probability-weighted average of the harms that might result if\nI take O, and the expected threat is the probability-weighted\naverage of the consequences of doing nothing to prevent the\nthreat—allowing for the possibility that the threat might not\neventuate at all (Lazar 2012b). We would also have to factor in the\noptions’ probability of averting the threat. This simple move\nobscures a number of important and undertheorised issues that we\ncannot discuss in detail here. For now, we must simply note that\nproportionality and necessity must be appropriately indexed to the\nagent’s uncertainty. \nNecessity and proportionality judgements involve weighing harms\ninflicted and threats averted, indeed all relevant goods and bads. The\nsimplest way to proceed would be to aggregate the harms to individual\npeople on each side, and call the act proportionate just in case it\naverts more harm than it causes, and necessary just in case no\nalternative involves less harm. But few deontologists, and indeed few\nnon-philosophers, think in this naively aggregative way. Instead we\nshould weight harms (etc.) according to factors such as whether the\nagent is directly responsible for them, and whether they are intended\nor merely\n foreseen.[9]\n Many also think that we can, perhaps even must, give greater\nimportance in our deliberations to our loved ones (for example) than\nto those tied to us only by the common bonds of humanity (Hurka 2007;\nLazar 2013; for criticism, see Lefkowitz 2009). Similarly, we might justifiably\nprioritise defending our own state’s sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity, even when doing so would not be impartially\n best.[10]\n Only when all these and other factors (many of which are discussed\nbelow) are taken into consideration can we form defensible conclusions\nabout which options are necessary and proportionate. \nThe other elements of the ethics of war contribute to the evaluation\nof proportionality and necessity, in one (or more) of three ways:\nidentifying positive reasons in favour of fighting; delineating the\nnegative reasons against fighting; or as staging-posts on the way to\njudgements of necessity and proportionality. \nGiven the gravity of the decision to go to war, only very serious\nthreats can give us just cause to fight. So if just cause is\nsatisfied, then you have weighty positive reasons to fight. Lacking\njust cause does not in itself aggravate the badness of\nfighting, but does make it less likely that the people killed in\npursuing one’s war aims will be liable to be killed (more on\nthis below, and see McMahan 2005a), which makes killing very hard to\njustify. Even if having a just cause is not strictly speaking a\nnecessary condition for warfare to be permissible, the absence of a\njust cause makes it very difficult for a war to satisfy\nproportionality. \nIf legitimate authority is satisfied then additional positive reasons\ncount in favour of fighting (see below). If it is not satisfied, then\nthis adds an additional reason against fighting, which must be\novercome for fighting to be proportionate. \nThe “reasonable prospects of success” criterion is a\nsurmountable hurdle on the way to proportionality. Typically, if a war\nlacks reasonable prospects of success, then it will be\ndisproportionate, since wars always involve causing significant harms,\nand if those harms are likely to be pointless then they are unlikely\nto be justified. But of course sometimes one’s likelihood of\nvictory is very low, and yet fighting is still the best available\noption, and so necessary and proportionate. Having reasonable\nprospects of success matters only for the same reasons that necessity\nand proportionality matter. If necessity and proportionality are\nsatisfied, then the reasonable prospects of success standard is\nirrelevant. \nRight intention may also be irrelevant, but insofar as it matters its\nabsence would be a reason against fighting; having the right intention\ndoes not give a positive reason to fight. \nLastly, discrimination is crucial to establishing proportionality and\nnecessity, because it tells us how to weigh the lives taken in\nwar. \nWars destroy lives and environments. In the eight years following the\nIraq invasion in 2003, half a million deaths were either directly or\nindirectly caused by the war (Hagopian et al. 2013). Direct casualties\nfrom the Second World War numbered over 60 million, about 3 per cent\nof the world’s population. War’s environmental costs are\nless commonly researched, but are obviously also extraordinary (Austin\nand Bruch 2000). Armed forces use fuels in Olympian quantities: in the\nyears from 2000–2013, the US Department of Defense accounted for\naround 80% of US federal government energy usage, between 0.75 and 1\nquadrillion BTUs per year—a little less than all the\nenergy use that year in Denmark and Bulgaria, a little more than\nSlovakia and Serbia (Energy Information Administration 2015a,b). They\nalso directly and indirectly destroy habitats and natural\nresources—consider, for example, the Gulf war oil spill (El-Baz\nand Makharita 1994). For both our planet and its inhabitants, wars are\ntruly among the very worst things we can do. \nWar can be necessary and proportionate only if it serves an end worth\nall this death and destruction. Hence the importance of having a just\ncause. And hence too the widespread belief that just causes are few\nand far between. Indeed, traditional just war theory recognizes only\ntwo kinds of justification for war: national defence (of one’s\nown state or of an ally) and humanitarian intervention. What’s\nmore, humanitarian intervention is permissible only to avert the very\ngravest of tragedies—“crimes that shock the moral\nconscience of mankind” (Walzer 2006: 107). \nWalzer argued that states’ claims to sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity are grounded in the human rights of their citizens, in three\nways. First, states ensure individual security. Rights to life and\nliberty have value “only if they also have dimension”\n(Walzer 2006: 58), which they derive from states’\nborders—“within that world, men and women… are safe\nfrom attack; once the lines are crossed, safety is gone” (Walzer\n2006: 57). Second, states protect a common life, made by their\ncitizens over centuries of interaction. If the common life of a\npolitical community is valued by its citizens, then it is worth\nfighting for. Third, they have also formed a political association, an\norganic social contract, whereby individuals have, over time and in\ninformal ways, conceded aspects of their liberty to the community, to\nsecure greater freedom for all. \nThese arguments for national defence are double-edged. They helped\nexplain why wars of national defence are permissible, but also make\njustifying humanitarian intervention harder. One can in principle\nsuccessfully conclude a war in defence of oneself or one's allies without any lasting\ndamage to the political sovereignty or territorial integrity of any of\nthe contending parties. In Walzer’s view, humanitarian\ninterventions, in which one typically defends people against their own\nstate, necessarily undermine political sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity. So they must meet a higher burden of justification. \nWalzer’s traditionalist stances on national defence and\nhumanitarian intervention met heavy criticism. Early sceptics (Doppelt\n1978; Beitz 1980; Luban 1980a) challenged Walzer’s appeal to the\nvalue of collective freedom, noting that in diverse political\ncommunities freedom for the majority can mean oppression for the\nminority (see also Caney 2006). In modern states, can we even speak of\na single common life? Even if we can, do wars really threaten it,\nbesides in extreme cases? And even if our common life and culture were\nthreatened, would their defence really justify killing innocent\npeople? \nCritics also excoriated Walzer’s appeal to individual rights\n(see especially Wasserstrom 1978; Luban 1980b). They questioned the\nnormative purchase of his metaphor of the organic social contract (if\nhypothetical contracts aren’t worth the paper they’re not\nwritten on, then what are metaphorical contracts worth?). They\nchallenged his claim that states guarantee individual security: most\nobviously, when humanitarian intervention seems warranted, the state\nis typically the greatest threat to its members. \nDavid Rodin (2002) advanced the quintessentially reductivist critique\nof Walzer, showing that his attempt to ground state defence in\nindividual defensive rights could not succeed. He popularized the\n“bloodless invasion objection” to this argument for\nnational defensive rights. Suppose an unjustly aggressing army would\nsecure its objectives without loss of life if only the victim state\noffers no resistance (the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003\ninvasion of Iraq, arguably meet this description, as might some of\nRussia’s territorial expansions). If the right of national\ndefence is grounded in states’ members’ rights to\nsecurity, then in these cases there would be no right of national\ndefence, because their lives are at risk only if the victim state\nfights back. And yet we typically do think it permissible to fight\nagainst annexation and regime change. \nBy undermining the value of sovereignty, revisionists lowered the bar\nagainst intervening militarily in other states. Often these arguments\nwere directly linked: some think that if states cannot protect the\nsecurity of their members, then they lack any rights to sovereignty\nthat a military intervention could undermine (Shue\n 1997).[11]\n Caney (2005) argues that military intervention could be permissible\nwere it to serve individual human rights better than non-intervention.\nOthers countenance so-called “redistributive wars”, fought\non behalf of the global poor to force rich states to address the\nwidespread violations of fundamental human rights caused by their\neconomic policies (Luban 1980b; Fabre 2012; Lippert-Rasmussen 2013;\nØverland 2013). \nOther philosophers, equally unpersuaded by Walzer’s arguments,\nnonetheless reject a substantively revisionist take on just cause. If\nthe individual self-defence-based view of jus ad bellum\ncannot justify lethal defence against “lesser aggression”,\nthen we could follow Rodin (2014), and argue for radically\nrevisionist conclusions about just cause; or we could instead reject\nthe individual self-defence-based approach to justifying killing in\nwar (Emerton and Handfield 2014; Lazar 2014). \nSome think we can solve the “problem of lesser aggression”\nby invoking the importance of deterrence, as well as the impossibility\nof knowing for sure that aggression will be bloodless (Fabre 2014).\nOthers think that we must take proper account of people’s\ninterest in having a democratically elected, or at least home-grown,\ngovernment, to justify national defence. On one popular account,\nalthough no individual could permissibly kill to protect her own\n“political interests”, when enough people are threatened,\ntheir aggregated interests justify going to war (Hurka 2007; Frowe\n2014). Counterintuitively, this means that more populous states have,\nother things equal, more expansive rights of national defence.\nHowever, perhaps states have a group right to national defence, which\nrequires only that a sufficient number of individuals have the\nrelevant political interests—any excess over the threshold is\nmorally irrelevant. Many already think about national\nself-determination in this way: the population of the group seeking\nindependence has to be sufficiently large before we take their claim\nseriously, but differences above that threshold matter much less\n(Margalit and Raz 1990). \nThe revisionist take on humanitarian intervention might also have some\ntroubling results. If sovereignty and territorial integrity matter\nlittle, then shouldn’t we use military force more often? As Kutz\n(2014) has argued, revisionist views on national defence might license\nthe kind of military adventurism that went so badly wrong in Iraq,\nwhere states have so little regard for sovereignty that they go to war\nto improve the domestic political institutions of their\nadversaries. \nWe can resolve this worry in one of two ways. First, recall just how\ninfrequently military intervention succeeds. Since it so often not\nonly fails, but actually makes things worse, we should use it only\nwhen the ongoing crimes are so severe that we would take any risk to\ntry to stop them. \nSecond, perhaps the political interests underpinning the state’s\nright to national defence are not simply interests in being part of an\nideal liberal democracy, but in being governed by, very broadly,\nmembers of one’s own nation, or perhaps even an interest in\ncollective self-determination. This may take us back to Walzer’s\n“romance of the nation-state”, but people clearly do care\nabout something like this. Unless we want to restrict rights of\nnational defence to liberal democracies alone (bearing in mind how few\nof them there are in the world), we have to recognize that our\npolitical interests are not all exclusively liberal-democratic. \nWhat of redistributive wars? Too often arguments on this topic\nartfully distinguish between just cause and other conditions of\njus ad bellum (Fabre 2012). Even when used by powerful states\nagainst weak adversaries, military force is rarely a moral triumph. It\ntends to cause more problems than it solves. Redistributive wars, as\nfought on behalf of the “global poor” against the\n“global rich”, would obviously fail to achieve their\nobjectives, indeed they would radically exacerbate the suffering of\nthose they aim to help. So they would be disproportionate, and cannot\nsatisfy the necessity constraint. The theoretical point that, in\nprinciple, not only national defence and humanitarian intervention\ncould give just causes for war is sound. But this example is in\npractice irrelevant (for a robust critique of redistributive\nwars, see Benbaji 2014). \nAnd yet, given the likely path of climate change, the future might see\nresource wars grow in salience. As powerful states find themselves\nlacking crucial resources, held by other states, we might find that\nmilitary attack is the best available means to secure these resources,\nand save lives. Perhaps in some such circumstances resource wars could\nbe a realistic option. \nThe goods and bads relevant to ad bellum proportionality and\nnecessity extend far beyond the armistice. This is obvious, but has\nrecently received much-needed emphasis, both among philosophers and in\nthe broader public debate sparked by the conflicts in Iraq and\nAfghanistan (Bass 2004; Coady 2008; May 2012). Achieving your just\ncause is not enough. The aftermath of the war must also be\nsufficiently tolerable if the war is to be proportionate, all things\nconsidered. It is an open question how far into the future we have to\nlook to assess the morally relevant consequences of conflict. \nHistorically, just war theory has been dominated by statists. Most\nbranches of the tradition have had some version of a\n“legitimate”, “proper” or “right”\nauthority constraint, construed as a necessary condition for a war to\nbe ad bellum\n just.[12]\n In practice, this means that sovereigns and states have rights that\nnon-state actors lack. International law gives only states rights of\nnational defence and bestows “combatant rights” primarily\non the soldiers of states. Although Walzer said little about\nlegitimate authority, his arguments all assume that states have a\nspecial moral standing that non-state actors lack. \nThe traditionalist, then, says it matters that the body fighting the\nwar have the appropriate authority to do so. Some think that authority\nis grounded in the overall legitimacy of the state. Others think that\noverall legitimacy is irrelevant—what matters is whether the\nbody fighting the war is authorized to do so by the polity that it\nrepresents (Lazar forthcoming-b). Either way, states are much more\nlikely to satisfy the legitimate authority condition than non-state\nactors. \nRevisionists push back: relying on reductivist premises, they argue\nthat killing in war is justified by the protection of individual\nrights, and our licence to defend our rights need not be mediated\nthrough state institutions. Either we should disregard the legitimate\nauthority condition or we should see it as something that non-state\nactors can, in fact, fulfil (Fabre 2008; Finlay 2010; Schwenkenbecher\n2013). \nOverall, state legitimacy definitely seems relevant for some questions\nin war (Estlund 2007; Renzo 2013). But authorization is more\nfundamental. Ideally, the body fighting the war should be authorized\nto do so by the institutions of a constitutional democracy. Looser\nforms of authorization are clearly possible; even a state that is not\noverall legitimate might nonetheless be authorized by its polity to\nfight wars of national defence.  \nAuthorization of this kind matters to jus ad bellum in two\nways. First, fighting a war without authorization constitutes an\nadditional wrong, which has to be weighed against the goods that\nfighting will bring about, and must pass the proportionality and\nnecessity tests. When a government involves its polity in a war, it\nuses the resources of the community at large, as well as its name, and\nexposes it to both moral and prudential risks (Lazar forthcoming-b).\nDoing this unauthorized is obviously deeply morally problematic. Any\nform of undemocratic decision-making by governments is objectionable;\ntaking decisions of this magnitude without the population’s\ngranting you the right to do so is especially wrong. \nSecond, authorization can allow the government to act on positive\nreasons for fighting that would otherwise be unavailable. Consider the\nclaim that wars of national defence are in part justified by the\npolitical interests of the citizens of the defending\nstate—interests, for example, in democratic participation or in\ncollective self-determination. A government may defend these\naggregated political interests only if it is authorized to do so.\nOtherwise fighting would contravene the very interests in\nself-determination that it is supposed to protect. But if it is\nauthorized, then that additional set of reasons supports fighting. \nAs a result, democratic states enjoy somewhat more expansive war\nrights than non-democratic states and non-state movements. The latter\ntwo groups cannot often claim the same degree of authorization as\ndemocratic states. Although this might not vindicate the current bias\nin international law towards states, it does suggest that it\ncorresponds to something more than the naked self-interest of the\nframers of international law—which were, of course, states. This\nobviously has significant implications for civil wars (see Parry\n2016). \nThe central task of the proportionality constraint, recall, is to\nidentify reasons that tell in favour of fighting and those that tell\nagainst it. Much of the latter task is reserved for the discussion of\njus in bello below, since it concerns weighing lives in\nwar. \nAmong the goods that help make a war proportionate, we have already\nconsidered those in the just cause and others connected to just peace\nand legitimate authority. Additionally, many also think that\nproportionality can be swayed by reasonable partiality towards\none’s own state and co-citizens. Think back to the political\ninterests that help justify national defence. If we were wholly\nimpartial, then we should choose the course that will best realise\npeople’s political interests overall. So if fighting the\ndefensive war would undermine the political interests of the adversary\nstate’s citizens more than it would undermine our own, then we\nshould refuse to fight. But this is not how we typically think about\nthe permission to resort to war: we are typically entitled to be\nsomewhat partial towards the political interests of our\nco-citizens. \nSome propose further constraints on what goods can count towards the\nproportionality of a war. McMahan and McKim (1993) argued that\nbenefits like economic progress cannot make an otherwise\ndisproportionate war proportionate. This is probably true in practice,\nbut perhaps not in principle—that would require a kind of\nlexical priority between lives taken and economic benefits, and\nlexical priorities are notoriously hard to defend. After all, economic\nprogress saves lives.  \nSome goods lack weight in ad bellum proportionality, not\nbecause they are lexically inferior to other values at stake, but\nbecause they are conditional in particular ways. Soldiers have\nconditional obligations to fulfil their roles, grounded in their\ncontracts, oaths, and their co-citizens’ legitimate\nexpectations. That carrying out an operation fulfils my oath gives me\na reason to perform that operation, which has to be weighed in the\nproportionality calculation (Lazar 2015b). But these reasons cannot\ncontribute to ad bellum proportionality in the same way,\nbecause they are conditional on the war as a whole being fought.\nPolitical leaders cannot plausibly say: “were it not for all the\noaths that would be fulfilled by fighting, this war would be\ndisproportionate”. This is because fighting counts as fulfilling\nthose oaths only if the political leader decides to take her armed\nforces to war. \nAnother reason to differentiate between proportionality ad\nbellum and in bello is that the relevant comparators\nchange for the two kinds of assessment. In a loose sense, we determine\nproportionality by asking whether some option is better than doing\nnothing. The comparator for assessing the war as a whole, then, is\nnot fighting at all, ending the war as a whole. That option\nis not available when considering particular actions within the\nwar—one can only decide whether or not to perform this\nparticular action. \nAre pre-emptive wars, fought in anticipation of an imminent enemy\nattack, permissible? What of preventive wars, in which the assault\noccurs prior to the enemy having any realistic plan of attack (see, in\ngeneral, Shue and Rodin 2007)? Neoconservatives have recently argued,\nsuperficially plausibly, that the criterion of last resort can be\nsatisfied long before the enemy finally launches an attack (see\nPresident 2002). The right answer here is boringly familiar. In\nprinciple, of course this is possible. But, in practice, we almost\nalways overestimate the likelihood of success from military means and\noverlook the unintended consequences of our actions. International law\nmust therefore retain its restrictions, to deter the kind of\noverzealous implementation of the last-resort principle that we saw in\nthe 2003 invasion of Iraq (Buchanan and Keohane 2004; Luban 2004). \nAnother frequently discussed question: what does the\n“last” in last resort really mean? The idea is simple, and\nis identical to in bello necessity. Going to war must be\ncompared with the alternative available strategies for dealing with\nthe enemy (which also includes the various ways in which we could\nsubmit). Going to war is literally a last resort when no other\navailable means has any prospect of averting the threat. But our\ncircumstances are not often this straitened. Other options always have\nsome chance of success. So if you have a diplomatic\nalternative to war, which is less harmful than going to war, and is at\nleast as likely to avert the threat, then going to war is not a last\nresort. If the diplomatic alternative is less harmful, as well as less\nlikely to avert the threat, then the question is whether the reduction\nin expected harm is great enough for us to be required to accept the\nreduction in likelihood of averting the threat. If not, then war is\nyour last\n resort.[13] \nThe traditionalist jus in bello, as reflected in\ninternational law, holds that conduct in war must satisfy three\nprinciples: \nThese principles divide the possible victims of war into two classes:\ncombatants and noncombatants. They place no constraints on killing\n combatants.[17]\n But—outside of “supreme emergencies”, rare\ncircumstances in which intentionally killing noncombatants is\nnecessary to avert an unconscionable threat—noncombatants may be\nkilled only unintendedly and, even then, only if the harm they suffer\nis necessary and proportionate to the intended goals of the\n attack.[18]\n Obviously, then, much hangs on what makes one a combatant. This entry adopts a\nconservative definition. Combatants are (most) members of the\norganized armed forces of a group that is at war, as well as others\nwho directly participate in hostilities or have a continuous combat\nfunction (for discussion, see Haque 2017). Noncombatants are\nnot combatants. There are, of course, many hard cases, especially in\nasymmetric wars, but they are not considered here. “Soldier” is \nused interchangeably with “combatant” and\n“civilian” interchangeably with\n“noncombatant”. \nBoth traditionalist just war theory and international law explicitly\nlicense fighting in accordance with these constraints, regardless of\none’s objectives. In other words, they endorse: \nCombatant Equality: Soldiers who satisfy Discrimination,\nProportionality, and Necessity fight permissibly, regardless of what\nthey are fighting for.\n [19] \nWe discuss Proportionality and Necessity below; for now let us\nconcentrate on Michael Walzer’s influential argument for\nDiscrimination and Combatant Equality, which has proved very\ncontroversial. \nIndividual human beings enjoy fundamental rights to life and liberty,\nwhich prohibit others from harming them in certain ways. Since\nfighting wars obviously involves depriving others of life and liberty,\naccording to Walzer, it can be permissible only if each of the victims\nhas, “through some act of his own … surrendered or lost\nhis rights” (Walzer 2006: 135). He then claims that,\n“simply by fighting”, all combatants “have lost\ntheir title to life and liberty” (Walzer 2006: 136). First,\nmerely by posing a threat to me, a person alienates himself from me,\nand from our common humanity, and so himself becomes a legitimate\ntarget of lethal force (Walzer 2006: 142). Second, by participating in\nthe armed forces, a combatant has “allowed himself to be made\ninto a dangerous man” (Walzer 2006: 145), and thus surrendered\nhis rights. By contrast, noncombatants are “men and women with\nrights, and… they cannot be used for some military purpose,\neven if it is a legitimate purpose” (Walzer 2006: 137). This\nintroduces the concept of liability into the debate, which we need to\ndefine carefully. On most accounts, that a person is liable to be\nkilled means that she is not wronged by being killed. Often this is\nunderstood, as it was in Walzer, in terms of rights: everyone starts\nout with a right to life, but that right can be forfeited or lost,\nsuch that one can be killed without that right being violated or\ninfringed. Walzer and his critics all agreed that killing a person\nintentionally is permissible only if either she has lost the\nprotection of her right to life, or if the good achieved thereby is\nvery great indeed, enough that, though she is wronged, it is not all\nthings considered wrong to kill her. Her right is permissibly\ninfringed. Walzer and his critics believe that such cases are very\nrare in war, arising only when the alternative to intentionally\nviolating people’s right to life is an imminent catastrophe on\nthe order of Nazi victory in Europe (this is an example of a supreme emergency). \nThese simple building blocks give us both Discrimination and Combatant\nEquality—the former, because noncombatants, in virtue of\nretaining their rights, are not legitimate objects of attack; the\nlatter, because all combatants lose their rights, regardless of what\nthey are fighting for: hence, as long as they attack only enemy\ncombatants, they fight legitimately, because they do not violate\nanyone’s rights. \nThese arguments have faced withering criticism. The simplest objection\nagainst Combatant Equality brings it into conflict with\nProportionality (McMahan 1994; Rodin 2002; Hurka 2005). Unintended\nnoncombatant deaths are permissible only if proportionate to the\nmilitary objective sought. This means the objective is worth that much\ninnocent suffering. But military objectives are merely means to an\nend. Their worth depends on how valuable the end is. How many innocent\ndeaths would be proportionate to Al Shabab’s successfully\ngaining control of Mogadishu now or to Iraq’s capturing Kuwaiti\nterritory and oil reserves in 1991? In each case the answer is\nobvious: none. \nProportionality is about weighing the evil inflicted against the evil\naverted (Lee 2012). But the military success of unjust combatants does\nnot avert evil, it is itself evil. Evil intentionally inflicted can\nonly add to, not counterbalance, unintended evils. Combatant Equality\ncannot be true. \nOther arguments against Combatant Equality focus on Walzer’s\naccount of how one loses the right to life. They typically start by\naccepting his premise that permissible killing in war does not violate\nthe rights of the victims against being killed, at least for\nintentional\n killing.[20]\n This contrasts with the view that sometimes people’s rights to\nlife can be overridden, so war can be permissible despite infringing\npeople’s rights. Walzer’s critics then show that his\naccount of how we lose our right to life is simply not plausible.\nMerely posing a threat to others—even a lethal threat—is\nnot sufficient to warrant the loss of one’s fundamental rights,\nbecause sometimes one threatens others’ lives for very good\nreasons (McMahan 1994). The soldiers of the Kurdish Peshmerga,\nheroically fighting to rescue Yazidis from ISIL’s genocidal\nattacks, do not thereby lose their rights not to be killed by their\nadversaries. Posing threats to others in the pursuit of a just aim,\nwhere those others are actively trying to thwart that just aim, cannot\nvoid or vitiate one’s fundamental natural rights against being\nharmed by those very people. The consent-based argument is equally\nimplausible as a general defence for Combatant Equality. Unjust\ncombatants have something to gain from waiving their rights against\nlethal attack, if doing so causes just combatants to effect the same\nwaiver. And on most views, many unjust combatants have nothing to\nlose, since by participating in an unjust war they have at least\nweakened if not lost those rights already. Just combatants, by\ncontrast, have something to lose, and nothing to gain. So why would\ncombatants fighting for a just cause consent to be harmed by their\nadversaries, in the pursuit of an unjust end? \nWalzer’s case for Combatant Equality rests on showing that just\ncombatants lose their rights to life. His critics have shown that his\narguments to this end fail. So Combatant Equality is false. But they\nhave shown more than this. Inspired by Walzer to look at the\nconditions under which we lose our rights to life, his critics have\nmade theoretical advances that place other central tenets of jus\nin bello in jeopardy. They argued, contra Walzer, that\nposing a threat is not sufficient for liability to be killed (McMahan\n1994, 2009). But they also showed that posing the threat oneself is\nnot necessary for liability either. This is more controversial, but\nrevisionists have long argued that liability is grounded, in war as\nelsewhere, in one’s responsibility for contributing to a\nwrongful threat. The US president, for example, is responsible for a\ndrone strike she orders, even though she does not fire the\nweapon herself. \nAs many have noted, this argument undermines Discrimination (McMahan\n1994; Arneson 2006; Fabre 2012; Frowe 2014). In many states,\nnoncombatants play an important role in the resort to military force.\nIn modern industrialized countries, as much as 25 per cent of the\npopulation works in war-related industries (Downes 2006: 157–8;\nsee also Gross 2010: 159; Valentino et al. 2010: 351); we provide the\nbelligerents with crucial financial and other services; we support and\nsustain the soldiers who do the fighting; we pay our taxes and in\ndemocracies we vote. Our contributions to the state’s capacity\nover time give it the strength and support to concentrate on\n war.[21]\n If the state’s war is unjust, then many noncombatants are\nresponsible for contributing to wrongful threats. If that is enough\nfor them to lose their rights to life, then they are permissible\ntargets. \nMcMahan (2011a) has sought to avert this troubling implication of his\narguments by contending that almost all noncombatants on the unjust\nside (unjust noncombatants) are less responsible than all unjust\ncombatants. But this involves applying a double standard, talking up\nthe responsibility of combatants, while talking down that of\nnoncombatants, and mistakes a central element in his account of\nliability to be killed. On his view, a person is liable to be killed\nin self- or other-defence in virtue of being, of those able to bear an\nunavoidable and indivisible harm, the one who is most responsible for\nthis situation coming about (McMahan 2002, 2005b). Even if\nnoncombatants are only minimally responsible for their\nstates’ unjust wars—that is, they are not blameworthy,\nthey merely voluntarily acted in a way that foreseeably contributed to\nthis result—on McMahan’s view this is enough to make them\nliable to be killed, if doing so is necessary to save the lives of\nwholly innocent combatants and noncombatants on the just side (see\nespecially McMahan 2009: 225). \nOne response is to reject this comparative account of how\nresponsibility determines liability, and argue for a non-comparative\napproach, according to which one’s degree of responsibility must\nbe great enough to warrant such a severe derogation from one’s\nfundamental rights. But if we do this, we must surely concede that\nmany combatants on the unjust side are not sufficiently responsible\nfor unjustified threats to be liable to be killed. Whether through\nfear, disgust, principle or ineptitude, many combatants are wholly\nineffective in war, and contribute little or nothing to threats posed\nby their side. The much-cited research of S. L. A. Marshall claimed\nthat only 15–25 per cent of Allied soldiers in the Second World\nWar who could have fired their weapons did so (Marshall 1978). Most\nsoldiers have a natural aversion to killing, which even intensive\npsychological training may not overcome (Grossman 1995). Many\ncontribute no more to unjustified threats than do noncombatants. They\nalso lack the “mens rea” that might make\nliability appropriate in the absence of a significant causal\ncontribution. They are not often blameworthy. The loss of their right\nto life is not a fitting response to their conduct. \nIf Walzer is right that in war, outside of supreme emergencies, we may\nintentionally kill only people who are liable to be killed, and if a\nsignificant proportion of unjust combatants and noncombatants are\nresponsible to the same degree as one another for unjustified threats,\nand if liability is determined by responsibility, then we must decide\nbetween two unpalatable alternatives. If we set a high threshold of\nresponsibility for liability, to ensure that noncombatants are not\nliable to be killed, then we will also exempt many combatants from\nliability. In ordinary wars, which do not involve supreme emergencies,\nintentionally killing such non-liable combatants would be\nimpermissible. This moves us towards a kind of pacifism—though\nwarfare can in principle be justified, it is so hard to fight without\nintentionally killing the non-liable that in practice we must be\npacifists (May 2015). But if we set the threshold of responsibility\nlow, ensuring that all unjust combatants are liable, then many\nnoncombatants will be liable too, thus rendering them permissible\ntargets and seriously undermining Discrimination. We are torn between\npacifism on the one hand, and realism on the other. This is the\n“responsibility dilemma” for just war theory (Lazar\n2010). \nJust war theory has meaning only if we can explain why killing some\ncombatants in war is allowed, but we are not thereby licensed to kill\neveryone in the enemy state. Here the competing forces of realism and\npacifism are at their most compelling. It is unsurprising, therefore,\nthat so much recent work has focused on this topic. We cannot do\njustice to all the arguments here, but will instead consider three kinds of\nresponse: all-out revisionist; moderate traditionalist; and all-out\ntraditionalist. \nThe first camp faces two challenges: to justify intentionally killing\napparently non-liable unjust combatants; but to do this without\nreopening the door to Combatant Equality, or indeed further\nundermining Discrimination. Their main move is to argue that, despite\nappearances, all and only unjust combatants are in fact liable to be\nkilled. \nMcMahan argues that liability to be killed need not, in fact,\npresuppose responsibility for an unjustified threat. Instead, unjust\ncombatants’ responsibility for just combatants’ reasonable\nbeliefs that they are liable may be enough to ground forfeiture of their rights\n(McMahan 2011a). Some argue that combatants’ responsibility for\nbeing in the wrong place at the wrong time is enough (likening them to\nvoluntary human\n shields).[22]\n More radically still, some philosophers abandon the insistence on\nindividual responsibility, arguing that unjust combatants are\ncollectively responsible for contributing to unjustified threats, even\nif they are individually ineffective (or even counterproductive) (Kamm\n2004; Bazargan 2013). \nLazar (forthcoming-a) suggests these arguments are\nunpersuasive. Complicity might be relevant to the costs one is\nrequired to bear in war, but most liberals will baulk at the idea of\nlosing one’s right to life in virtue of things that other people\ndid. And if combatants can be complicitously liable for what their\ncomrades-in-arms did, then why shouldn’t noncombatants be\ncomplicitously liable also? \nBlameworthy responsibility for other people’s false beliefs does\nseem relevant to the ethics of self- and other-defence. That said,\nconsider an idiot who pretends to be a suicide bomber as a prank, and\nis shot by a police officer (Ferzan 2005; McMahan 2005c). Is killing\nhim objectively permissible? It seems doubtful. The officer’s justified\nbelief that the prankster posed a threat clearly diminishes the\nwrongfulness of killing him (Lazar 2015a). And certainly the\nprankster’s fault excuses the officer of any guilt. But killing\nthe prankster still seems objectively wrong. Even if someone’s\nblameworthy responsibility for false beliefs could make killing him\nobjectively permissible, most philosophers agree that many unjust\ncombatants are not to blame for the injustice of their wars (McMahan\n1994; Lazar 2010). And it is much less plausible that\nblameless responsibility for beliefs can make one a permissible\ntarget. Even if it did, this would count in favour of moderate\nCombatant Equality, since most just combatants are also blamelessly\nresponsible for unjust combatants’ reasonable beliefs that they\nare liable to be killed. \nModerate traditionalists think we can avoid the realist and pacifist\nhorns of the responsibility dilemma only by conceding a moderate form\nof Combatant Equality. The argument proceeds in three stages. First,\nendorse a non-comparative, high threshold of responsibility for\nliability, such that most noncombatants in most conflicts are not\nresponsible enough to be liable to be killed. This helps explain why\nkilling civilians in war is so hard to justify. Of course, it also\nentails that many combatants will be innocent too. The second step,\nthen, is to defend the principle of Moral Distinction,\naccording to which killing civilians is worse than killing soldiers.\nThis is obviously true if the soldiers are liable and the civilians\nare not. But the challenge is to show that killing non-liable\ncivilians is worse than killing non-liable soldiers. If we\ncan do that, then the permissibility of intentionally killing\nnon-liable soldiers does not entail that intentionally killing\nnon-liable noncombatants is permissible. Of course, one might still\nargue that, even if Moral Distinction is true, we should endorse\npacifism. But, and this is the third stage, the less seriously\nwrongful some act is, the lesser the good that must be realised by\nperforming that act, for it to be all things considered permissible.\nIf intentionally killing innocent combatants is not the worst kind of\nkilling one can do, then the good that must be realised for it to be\nall things considered permissible is less than is the case for, for\nexample, intentionally killing innocent civilians, which philosophers\ntend to think can be permissible only in a supreme emergency. This\ncould mean that intentionally killing innocent soldiers is permissible\neven in the ordinary circumstances of war. \nWarfare can be justified, then, by a combination of liability and\nlesser evil grounds. Some unjust combatants lose their rights not to\nbe killed. Others’ rights can be overridden without that\nimplying that unjust noncombatants’ rights may be overridden\ntoo. We can reject the pacifist horn of the responsibility dilemma.\nBut a moderate Combatant Equality is likely to be true: since killing\ninnocent combatants is not the worst kind of killing, it is\ncorrespondingly easier for unjust combatants to justify using lethal\nforce (at least against just combatants). This increases the range of\ncases in which they can satisfy Discrimination, Proportionality, and\nNecessity, and so fight permissibly. \nMuch hangs, then, on the arguments for Moral Distinction. Some focus\non why killing innocent noncombatants is especially wrongful; others\non why killing innocent combatants is not so bad. This section\nconsiders the second kind of argument, returning to the first in the\nnext section. \nThe revisionists’ arguments mentioned above might not ground\nliability, but do perhaps justify some reason to prefer\nharming combatants. Combatants can better avoid harm than\nnoncombatants. Combatants surely do have somewhat greater\nresponsibilities to bear costs to avert the wrongful actions of their\ncomrades-in-arms than do noncombatants. And the readiness of most\ncombatants to fight—regardless of whether their cause is\njust—likely means that even just combatants have somewhat\nmuddied status relative to noncombatants. They conform to their\nopponents’ rights only by accident. They have weaker grounds for\ncomplaint when they are wrongfully killed than do noncombatants, who\nmore robustly respect the rights of others (on robustness and respect,\nsee Pettit 2015). \nAdditionally, when combatants kill other combatants, they typically\nbelieve that they are doing so permissibly. Most often they believe\nthat their cause is just, and that this is a legitimate means to bring\nit about. But, insofar as they are lawful combatants, they will also\nbelieve that international law constrains their actions, so that by\nfighting in accordance with it they are acting permissibly. Lazar\n(2015c) argues that killing people when you know that doing so is\nobjectively wrong is more seriously objectionable than doing so when\nyou reasonably believe that you are acting permissibly. \nThe consent-based argument for Combatant Equality fails because of its\nempirical, not its normative premise. If combatants in fact waived\ntheir rights not to be killed by their adversaries, even when fighting\na just war, then that would clearly affect their adversaries’\nreasons for action, reducing the wrongfulness of killing anyone who\nhad waived that right. The problem is that they have not waived their\nrights not to be killed. However, they often do offer a more limited\nimplicit waiver of their rights. The purpose of having armed forces,\nand the intention of many who serve in them, is to protect civilians\nfrom the predations of war. This means both countering threats to and\ndrawing fire away from them. Combatants interpose themselves between\nthe enemy and their civilian compatriots, and fight on their\ncompatriots’ behalf. If they abide by the laws of war, they\nclearly distinguish themselves from the civilian population, wearing a\nuniform and carrying their weapons openly. They implicitly say to\ntheir adversaries: “you ought to put down your weapons. But if\nyou are going to fight, then fight us”. This\nconstitutes a limited waiver of their rights against harm. Like a full\nwaiver, it alters the reasons confronting their\nadversaries—under these circumstances, other things equal it is\nworse to kill the noncombatants. Of course, in most cases unjust\ncombatants ought simply to stop fighting. But this conditional waiver\nof their opponents’ rights means that, if they are not going to\nput down arms, they do better to target combatants than\nnoncombatants. \nOf course, one might think that in virtue of their altruistic\nself-sacrifice, just combatants are actually the least\ndeserving of the harms of war (Tadros 2014). But, first, warfare is\nnot a means for ensuring that people get their just deserts. More\nimportantly, given that their altruism is specifically intended to\ndraw fire away from their compatriot noncombatants, it would be\nperverse to treat this as a reason to do precisely what they are\ntrying to prevent.  \nThese arguments and others suggest that killing innocent combatants is\nnot the worst kind of killing one can do. It might therefore be all\nthings considered permissible in the ordinary circumstances of war,\nprovided enough good is achieved thereby. If unjust combatants attack\nonly just combatants, and if they achieve some valuable objective by\ndoing so—defence of their comrades, their co-citizens, or their\nterritory—they therefore might fight permissibly, even though\nthey violate the just combatants’ rights (Kamm 2004; Hurka 2005;\nKamm 2005; Steinhoff 2008; Lazar 2013). At least, it is more plausible\nthat they can fight permissibly than if we regarded every just\ncombatant’s death as equivalent to the worst kind of murder.\nThis does not vindicate Combatant Equality—it simply shows that,\nmore often than one might think, unjust combatants can fight\npermissibly. Add to that the fact that all wars are morally\nheterogeneous, involving just and unjust phases (Bazargan 2013), and\nwe quickly see that even if Combatant Equality in the laws of war\nlacks fundamental moral foundations, it is a sensible approximation of\nthe truth. \nSome philosophers, however, seek a more robust defence of Combatant\nEquality. The three most prominent lines are institutionalist. A\ncontractualist argument (Benbaji 2008, 2011) starts by observing that\nstates (and their populations) need disciplined armies for the\npurposes of national defence. If soldiers always had to decide for\nthemselves whether a particular war was just, many states could not\nraise armies when they need to. They would be unable to deter\naggression. All states, and all people, benefit from an arrangement\nwhereby individual combatants waive their rights not to be killed by\none another—allowing them to obey their state’s commands\nwithout second-guessing every deployment. Combatants tacitly consent\nto waive their rights in this way, given common knowledge that\nfighting in accordance with the laws of war involves such a waiver.\nMoreover, their assent is “morally effective” because it\nis consistent with a fair and optimal contract among states. \nInternational law does appear to change the moral standing of\ncombatants. If you join the armed forces of a state, you know that, at\ninternational law, you thereby become a legitimate target in armed\nconflict. This has to be relevant to the wrongfulness of harming you,\neven if you are fighting for a just cause. But Benbaji’s\nargument is more ambitious than this. He thinks that soldiers waive\ntheir rights not to be killed by one another—not the limited,\nconditional waiver described above, but an outright waiver, that\nabsolves their adversaries of any wrongdoing (though it does not so\nabsolve their military and political leaders). \nThe first problem with this proposal is that it rests on contentious\nempirical speculation about whether soldiers in fact consent in this\nway. But setting that aside, second, it is radically statist, implying\nthat international law simply doesn’t apply to asymmetric\nconflicts between states and non-state actors, since the latter are\nnot part of the appropriate conventions. This gives international law\nshallow foundations, which fail to support the visceral outrage that\nbreaches of international law typically evoke. It also suggests that\nstates that either don’t ratify major articles of international\nlaw, or that withdraw from agreements, can escape its strictures. This\nseems mistaken. Third, we typically regard waivers of fundamental\nrights as reversible when new information comes to light. Why\nshouldn’t just combatants be allowed to withdraw their\nrights-waiver when they are fighting a just war? Many regard the right\nto life as inalienable; even if we deny this, we must surely doubt\nwhether you can alienate it once and for all, under conditions of\ninadequate information. Additionally, suppose that you want to join\nthe armed forces only to fight a specific just war (McMahan 2011b).\nWhy should you waive your rights against harm in this case, given that\nyou plan only to fight now? Fourth, and most seriously, even if\nBenbaji’s argument explained why killing combatants in war is\npermissible regardless of the cause you are serving, it cannot explain\nwhy unintentionally killing noncombatants as a side-effect of\none’s actions is permissible. By joining the armed forces of\ntheir state, soldiers at least do something that implies\ntheir consent to the regime of international law that structures that\nrole. But noncombatants do not consent to this regime. Soldiers\nfighting for unjust causes will inevitably kill many innocent\ncivilians. If those deaths cannot be rendered proportionate, then\nCombatant Equality does not hold. \nThe second institutionalist argument starts from the belief that we\nhave a duty to obey the law of our legitimate state. This gives unjust\ncombatants, ordered to fight an unjust war, some reason to obey those\norders. We can ground this in different ways. Estlund (2007) argues\nthat the duty to obey orders derives from the epistemic authority of\nthe state—it is more likely than an individual soldier to know\nwhether this war is just (see Renzo 2013 for criticism); Cheyney Ryan\n(2011) emphasizes the democratic source of the state’s\nauthority, as well as the crucial importance of maintaining civilian\ncontrol of the military. These are genuine moral\nreasons that should weigh in soldiers’ deliberations. But are\nthey really weighty enough to ground Combatant Equality? It seems doubtful.\nThey cannot systematically override unjust combatants’\nobligations not to kill innocent people. This point stands regardless\nof whether these reasons weigh in the balance, or are exclusionary\nreasons that block others from being considered (Raz 1985). The rights\nof innocent people not to be killed are the weightiest, most\nfundamental rights around. For some other reason to outweigh them, or\nexclude them from deliberation, it would have to be extremely\npowerful. Combatants’ obligations to obey orders simply are not\nweighty enough—as everyone recognises with respect to obedience\nto unlawful in bello commands (McMahan 2009: 66ff). \nLike the first argument, the third institutionalist argument grounds\nCombatant Equality in its long-term results. But instead of focusing\non states’ ability to defend themselves, it emphasizes the\nimportance of limiting the horrors of war, given that we know that people\ndeceive themselves about the justice of their cause (Shue 2008, 2010;\nDill and Shue 2012; Shue 2013; Waldron 2016). Since combatants and\ntheir leaders almost always believe themselves to be in the right, any\ninjunction to unjust combatants to lay down their arms would simply be\nignored, while any additional permissions to harm noncombatants would\nbe abused by both sides. In almost all wars, it is sufficient\nto achieve military victory that you target only combatants. If doing\nthis will minimize wrongful deaths in the long run, we should enjoin\nthat all sides, regardless of their aims, respect Discrimination.\nAdditionally, while it is extremely difficult to secure international\nagreement even about what in fact constitutes a just cause for war\n(witness the controversy over the Rome statute on crimes of aggression, which took many years of negotiation before diplomats agreed an uneasy compromise), the traditionalist principles\nof jus in bello already have broad international support.\nThey are hard-won concessions that we should abandon only if we are\nsure that the new regime will be an improvement (Roberts 2008). \nAlthough this argument is plausible, it doesn’t address the same\nquestion as the act-focused arguments that preceded it. One thing we\ncan ask is: given a particular situation, what ought we to do? How\nought soldiers to act in Afghanistan, or Mali, or Syria, or Somalia?\nAnd when we ask this question, we shouldn’t start by assuming\nthat we or they will obviously fail to comply with any exacting moral\nstandards that we might propose (Lazar 2012a; Lazar and Valentini\nforthcoming). When considering our own actions, and those of people over whom\nwe have influence, we should select from all the available options,\nnot rule some out because we know ourselves to be too immoral to take\nthem. When designing institutions and laws, on the other hand, of\ncourse we should think about how people are likely to respond to them.\nWe need to answer both kinds of questions: what really ought\nI to do? And what should the laws be, given my and others’\npredictable frailty? \nA moderate Combatant Equality, then, is the likely consequence of\navoiding the pacifist horn of the responsibility dilemma. To show that\nkilling in war is permissible, we need to show that intentionally\nkilling innocent combatants is not as seriously wrongful as\nintentionally killing innocent noncombatants. And if killing innocent\ncombatants is not the worst kind of killing, it can more plausibly be\njustified by the goods achieved in ordinary wars, outside of supreme\nemergencies. On this view, contrary to the views of both Walzer and\nhis critics, much of the intended killing in justified wars is\npermissible not because the targets are liable to be killed, but\nbecause infringing their rights is a permissible lesser evil. But this\nprinciple applies regardless of whether you are on the just or the\nunjust side. This in turn increases the range of cases in which\ncombatants fighting on the unjust side will be able to fight\npermissibly: instead of needing to achieve some good comparable to\naverting a supreme emergency in order to justify infringing the rights\nof just combatants, they need only achieve more prosaic kinds of\ngoods, since these are not the worst kinds of rights infringements. So\nunjust combatants’ associative duties to protect one another and\ntheir compatriots, their duties to obey their legitimate governments,\nand other such considerations, can sometimes make intentionally\nkilling just combatants a permissible lesser evil, and unintentionally\nkilling noncombatants proportionate. This means that the existing laws\nof war are a closer approximation of combatants’ true moral\nobligations than many revisionists think. Nonetheless, much of the\nkilling done by unjust combatants in war is still objectively\nwrong. \nThe middle path in just war theory depends on showing that killing\ncivilians is worse than killing soldiers. This section discusses\narguments to explain why killing civilians is distinctly\nobjectionable. We discuss the significance of intentional\nkilling when considering proportionality, below. \nThese arguments are discussed at great length in Lazar (2015c), and\nare presented only briefly here. They rest on a key point: Moral\nDistinction says that killing civilians is worse than killing\nsoldiers. It does not say that killing civilians is worse\nthan killing soldiers, other things equal. Lazar\nholds that stronger principle but does not think that the intrinsic\ndifferences between killing civilians and killing soldiers—the\nproperties that are necessarily instantiated in those two\nkinds of killings—are weighty enough to provide Moral\nDistinction with the kind of normative force needed to protect\nnoncombatants in war. That protection depends on mobilising multiple\nfoundations for Moral Distinction, which include many properties that\nare contingently but consistently instantiated in acts that\nkill civilians and kill soldiers, which make killing civilians worse.\nWe cannot ground Moral Distinction in any one of these properties\nalone, since each is susceptible to counterexamples. But when they are\nall taken together, they justify a relatively sharp line between\nharming noncombatants and harming combatants. There are, of course,\nhard cases, but these must be decided by appealing to the salient\nunderlying properties rather than to the mere fact of membership in\none group or the other. \nFirst, at least deliberately killing civilians in war usually fails\neven the most relaxed interpretation of the necessity constraint. This\nis not always true—killing is necessary if it is effective at\nachieving your objective, and no other effective options are\navailable. Killing civilians sometimes meets this description. It is\noften effective: the blockade of Germany helped end the first world\nwar, though it may have caused as many as half a million civilian\ndeaths; Russian targeting of civilians in Chechnya reduced Russian\ncombatant casualties (Lyall 2009); Taliban anti-civilian tactics have\nbeen effective in Afghanistan. And these attacks are often the last\nrecourse of groups at war (Valentino 2004); when all other options\nhave failed or become too costly, targeting civilians is relatively\neasy to do. Indeed, as recent terrorist attacks have shown (Mumbai and\nParis, for example), fewer than ten motivated gunmen with basic\nweaponry can bring the world’s most vibrant cities screeching to\na halt. So, killing civilians can satisfy the necessity\nconstraint. Nonetheless, attacks on civilians are often wholly wanton,\nand there is a special contempt expressed in killing innocent people\neither wantonly or for its own sake. At least if you have\nsome strategic goal in sight, you might believe that\nsomething is at stake that outweighs the innocent lives taken. Those\nwho kill civilians pointlessly express their total disregard for their\nvictims in doing so. \nSecond, even when killing civilians is effective, it is usually so\nopportunistically (Quinn 1989; Frowe 2008; Quong 2009; Tadros\n2011). That is, the civilians’ suffering is used as a means to\ncompel their compatriots and their leaders to end their war. Sieges\nand aerial bombardments of civilian population centres seek to break\nthe will of the population and of their government. Combatants, by\ncontrast, are almost always killed eliminatively—their\ndeaths are not used to derive a benefit that could not be had without\nusing them in this way; instead they are killed to solve a problem\nthat they themselves pose. This too seems relevant to the relative\nwrongfulness of these kinds of attacks. Of course, at the strategic\nlevel every death is intended as a message to the enemy leadership,\nthat the costs of continuing to fight outweigh the benefits. But at\nthe tactical level, where the actual killing takes place, soldiers\ntypically kill soldiers eliminatively, while they kill civilians\nopportunistically. If this difference is morally important, as many\nthink, and if acts that kill civilians are opportunistic much more\noften than are acts that kill soldiers, then acts that kill civilians\nare, in general, worse than acts that kill soldiers. This lends\nfurther support to Moral Distinction. \nThird, as already noted above, the agent’s beliefs can affect\nthe objective seriousness of her act of killing. Killing someone when\nyou have solid grounds to think that doing so is objectively\npermissible wrongs that person less seriously than when your epistemic\nbasis for harming them is weaker. More precisely, killing an innocent\nperson is more seriously wrongful the more reason the killer had to\nbelieve that she was not liable to be killed (Lazar 2015a). \nLast, in ordinary thinking about the morality of war, the two\nproperties most commonly cited to explain the distinctive wrongfulness\nof harming civilians, after their innocence, are their vulnerability\nand their defencelessness. Lazar (2015c) suspects that the duties to\nprotect the vulnerable and not to harm the defenceless are almost as\nbasic as the duty not to harm the innocent. (Note that these duties\napply only when their object is morally innocent.)  Obviously, on any\nplausible analysis, civilians are more vulnerable and defenceless than\nsoldiers, so if killing innocent people who are more vulnerable and\ndefenceless is worse than killing those who are less so, then killing\ncivilians is worse than killing soldiers. \nUndoubtedly soldiers are also often vulnerable too—one thinks of\nthe “Highway of Death”, in Iraq 1991, when American forces\ndestroyed multiple armoured divisions of the Iraqi army, which were\ncompletely unprotected (many of the personnel in those divisions\nescaped into the desert). But this example just shows that killing\nsoldiers, when they are vulnerable and defenceless, is harder to\njustify than when they are not. Provided the empirical claim that\nsoldiers are less vulnerable and defenceless than civilians is true,\nthis simply supports the case for Moral Distinction. \nHolding the principle of Moral Distinction allows one to escape the\nrealist and pacifist horns of the responsibility dilemma, while still\ngiving responsibility its due. Even revisionists who deny moderate\nCombatant Equality could endorse Moral Distinction, and thereby\nretain the very plausible insight that it is worse to kill just\nnoncombatants than to kill just combatants. And, if they are to\naccount for most people’s considered judgements about war, even\npacifists need some account of why killing civilians is worse than\nkilling soldiers. \nHowever, Moral Distinction is not Discrimination. It is a comparative\nclaim, and it says nothing about intentions. Discrimination, by\ncontrast, prohibits intentionally attacking noncombatants, except in\nsupreme emergencies. It is the counterpart of Proportionality, which\nplaces a much weaker bar on unintentionally killing noncombatants.\nOnly a terrible crisis could make it permissible to intentionally\nattack noncombatants. But the ordinary goods achieved in individual\nbattles can justify unintentional killing. What justifies this radical\ndistinction? \nThis is one of the oldest questions in normative ethics (though for\nthe recent debate, see Quinn 1989; Rickless 1997; McIntyre 2001;\nDelaney 2006; Thomson 2008; Tadros 2015). On most accounts, those who\nintend harm to their victims show them a more objectionable kind of disrespect\nthan those who unavoidably harm them as a side-effect. Perhaps the\nbest case for the significance of intentions is, first, in a general\nargument that mental states are relevant to objective permissibility\n(Christopher 1998; see also Tadros 2011). And second, we need a rich\nand unified theoretical account of the specific mental states that\nmatter in this way, into which intentions fit. It may be that the\nspecial prohibition of intentional attacks on civilians overstates the\nmoral truth. Intentions do matter. Other things equal, intentional\nkillings are worse than unintended killings (though some unintended\nkillings that are wholly negligent or indifferent to the victim are\nnearly as bad as intentional killings). But the difference between\nthem is not categorical. It cannot sustain the contrast between a\nnear-absolute prohibition on one hand, and a sweeping permission on\nthe other. \nOf course, this is precisely the kind of nuance that would be\ndisastrous if implemented in international law or if internalized as a\nnorm by combatants. Weighing lives in war is informationally\nincredibly demanding. Soldiers need a principle they can apply.\nDiscrimination is that principle. It is not merely a rule of\nthumb, since it entails something that is morally\ngrounded—killing civilians is worse than killing soldiers. But\nit is also a rule of thumb, because it draws a starker\ncontrast between intended and unintended killing than is intrinsically\nmorally justified. \nAs already noted, proportionality and necessity contain within them\nalmost every other question in the ethics of war; we now consider two\nfurther points. \nFirst, proportionality in international law is markedly different from\nthe version of the principle that first-order moral theory supports.\nAt law, an act of war is proportionate insofar as the harm to\ncivilians is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct\nmilitary advantage realized thereby. As noted above, in first-order\nmoral terms, this is unintelligible. But there might be a better\ninstitutional argument for this neutral conception of proportionality.\nProportionality calculations involve many substantive value\njudgements—for example, about the significance of moral status,\nintentions, risk, vulnerability, defencelessness, and so on. These are\nall highly controversial topics. Reasonable disagreement abounds. Many\nliberals think that coercive laws should be justified in terms that\nothers can reasonably accept, rather than depending on controversial\nelements of one’s overarching moral theory (Rawls 1996: 217).\nThe law of armed conflict is coercive; violation constitutes a war\ncrime, for which one can be punished. Of course, a more complex law\nwould not be justiciable, but we also have principled grounds for not\nbasing international law on controversial contemporary disputes in\njust war theory. Perhaps the current standard can be endorsed from\nwithin a wider range of overarching moral theories than could anything\ncloser to the truth. \nSecond, setting aside the law and focusing again on morality, many\nthink that responsibility is crucial to thinking about\nproportionality, in the following way. Suppose the Free Syrian Army\n(FSA) launches an assault on Raqqa, stronghold of ISIL. They predict\nthat they will cause a number of civilian casualties in their assault,\nbut that this is only because ISIL has chosen to operate from within a\ncivilian area, forcing people to be “involuntary human\nshields”. Some think that ISIL’s responsibility for\nputting those civilians at risk allows the FSA to give those\ncivilians’ lives less weight in their deliberations than would\nbe appropriate if ISIL had not used them as human shields (Walzer\n2009; Keinon 2014). \nBut one could also consider the following: Even if ISIL is primarily\nat fault for using civilians as cover, why should this mean that those\ncivilians enjoy weaker protections against being harmed? We typically\nthink that one should only lose or forfeit one’s rights through\none’s own actions. But on this argument, civilians\nenjoy weaker protections against being killed through no fault or\nchoice of their own. Some might think that more permissive standards\napply for involuntary human shields because of the additional value of\ndeterring people from taking advantage of morality in this kind of way\n(Smilansky 2010; Keinon 2014). But that argument seems oddly circular:\nwe punish people for taking advantage of our moral restraint by not\nshowing moral restraint. What’s more, this changes the act from\none that foreseeably kills civilians as an unavoidable side-effect of\ncountering the military threat to one that kills those civilians as a\nmeans to deter future abuses. This instrumentalizes them in a way that\nmakes harming them still harder to justify. \nThe foregoing considerations are all also relevant to necessity. They\nallow us to weigh the harms at stake, so that we can determine whether\nthe morally weighted harm inflicted can be reduced at a reasonable\ncost to the agents. The basic structure of necessity is the same\nin bello as it is ad bellum, though obviously the\nsame differences in substance arise as for proportionality. Some\nreasons apply only to in bello necessity judgements, not to\nad bellum ones, because they are conditional on the\nbackground assumption that the war as a whole will continue. This\nmeans that we cannot reach judgements of the necessity of the war as a\nwhole by simply aggregating our judgements about the individual\nactions that together constitute the war. \nFor example, in bello one of the central questions when\napplying the necessity principle is: how much risk to our own troops\nare we required to bear in order to minimize harms to the innocent?\nSome option can be necessary simply in virtue of the fact that it\nsaves some of our combatants’ lives. Ad bellum,\nevaluating the war as a whole, we must of course consider the risk to\nour own combatants. But we do so in a different way—we ask\nwhether the goods achieved by the war as a whole will justify putting\nour combatants at risk. We don’t then count among the goods\nachieved by the war the fact that multiple actions within the war will\nsave the lives of individual combatants. We cannot count averting\nthreats that will arise only if we decide to go to war among the goods\nthat justify the decision to go to war. \nThis relates directly to the largely ignored requirement in\ninternational law that combatants must  \nThis has deep moral foundations: combatants in war are morally\nrequired to reduce the risk to innocents until doing so\nfurther would involve an unreasonably high cost to them, which they\ncannot be required to bear. Working out when that point is reached\ninvolves thinking through: soldiers’ role-obligations to assume\nrisks; the difference between doing harm to civilians and allowing it\nto happen to oneself or one’s comrades-in-arms; the importance\nof associative duties to protect one’s comrades; and all the\nconsiderations already adduced in favour of Moral Distinction. This\ncalculus is very hard to perform. My own view is that combatants ought\nto give significant priority to the lives of civilians (Walzer and\nMargalit 2009; McMahan 2010b). This is in stark contrast to existing\npractice (Luban 2014). \nMuch recent work has used either traditionalist or revisionist just\nwar theory to consider new developments in the practice of warfare,\nespecially the use of drones, and the possible development of\nautonomous weapons systems. Others have focused on the ethics of\nnon-state conflicts, and asymmetric wars. Very few contemporary wars\nfit the nation-state model of the mid-twentieth century, and conflicts\ninvolving non-state actors raise interesting questions for legitimate\nauthority and the principle of Discrimination in particular (Parry\n2016). A third development, provoked by the terrible failure to plan\nahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, is the wave of reflection on the\naftermath of war. This topic, jus post bellum, is addressed\nseparately. \nAs to the philosophical foundations of just war theory: the\ntraditionalist and revisionist positions are now well staked out. But\nthe really interesting questions that remain to be answered should be\napproached without thinking in terms of that split. Most notably, \npolitical philosophers may have something more to contribute\nto the just war theory debate. It would be interesting, too, to think\nwith a more open mind about the institutions of international law\n(nobody has yet vindicated the claim that the law of armed conflict\nhas authority, for example), and also about the role of the military\nwithin nation-states, outside of wartime (Ryan 2016). \nThe collective dimensions of warfare could be more fully\nexplored. Several philosophers have considered how soldiers “act\ntogether” when they fight (Zohar 1993; Kutz 2005; Bazargan\n2013). But few have reflected on whether group agency is present and\nmorally relevant in war. And yet it is superficially very natural to\ndiscuss wars in these terms, especially in evaluating the war as a\nwhole. When the British parliament debated in late 2015 whether to\njoin the war against ISIL in Syria and Iraq, undoubtedly each MP was\nthinking also about what she ought to do. But most of them\nwere asking themselves what the United Kingdom ought to\ndo. This group action might be wholly reducible to the individual\nactions of which it is composed. But this still raises interesting\nquestions: in particular, how should I justify my actions, as an\nindividual who is acting on behalf of the group? Must I appeal only to\nreasons that apply to me? Or can I act on reasons that apply to the\ngroup’s other members or to the group as a whole? And can I\nassess the permissibility of my actions without assessing the group\naction of which they are part? Despite the prominence of collectivist\nthinking in war, discussion of war’s group morality is very much\nin its infancy.","contact.mail":"seth.lazar@anu.edu.au","contact.domain":"anu.edu.au"}]
