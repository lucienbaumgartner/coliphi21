Although the\nethos of this age found its clearest (and certainly its most famous)\narticulation towards the end of the century with Immanuel Kant and his\ncritical philosophy, he was not the first to issue this call. Instead,\nthat task fell to Christian Thomasius (Thomas) at the end of the\nseventeenth century. It was then taken up and further developed in a\ntheological (pietist) direction by a number of minor figures, the\nThomasians, and reissued in a rationalist direction in the early and\nmiddle part of the eighteenth century by Christian Wolff and his\nfollowers. The development of their position(s) as well as their\nphilosophical (dis)agreements took place by and large at the University\nof Halle and against the context of pietism.\n\n\n\nAlthough Thomasius is now largely forgotten, he was a pivotal figure\nin early eighteenth century enlightenment thought. In this context,\nhowever, he was also a somewhat ambiguous figure. On the one hand, he\nwas clearly an innovator. Both a lawyer and a philosophy professor, he\nadvocated the independent use of healthy reason, fought against\nprejudice, against belief in any of the then prevailing superstitions,\nagainst any form of (religious) persecution, against the witch-hunt and\nthe use of torture, and in general, against any form of intolerance. He\ntook issue with dependence on authority and the school philosophy's\ndependence on the syllogism. He lectured in German rather than the\ntraditional Latin or the then fashionable French and was the first\nperson, in Germany, to found a popular monthly journal, written by and\nlarge in German, devoted to book reviews, the\nMonatsgespräche (Monthly Conversations). On the\nother hand, especially when it came to matters of morality, he was more\nof a traditionalist. Here he retained distinctly non-Enlightenment\nideas, particularly the belief in an evil will and the belief in the\nnecessity of God's salvation. \n\nBy way of background to both Thomasius's and Wolff's life it is\nimportant to note that the Germany of the eighteenth century was a\ncountry split into numerous states, each of which had its own\ngovernment. There was no central government. Reeling from the effects\nof the Thirty Years War, many of its states did not have freedom of\nspeech, freedom of religion, or, for that matter, a\n‘national’ culture, though, given the variety of state\ngovernments, some states had relatively more freedom than others. It\nmay seem surprising, therefore, that Christian Thomasius was able to\nissue the call to the enlightenment at the end of the seventeenth\ncentury, though not at all surprising that both Thomasius and Wolff\nwere subject to arbitrary political power. \n\nThe son of jurist and philosopher Jakob Thomasius, Christian\nreceived his education at the University of Leipzig and his law degree\nat the University of Frankfurt an der Oder (in Eastern Germany) in\n1679. He spent the early part of his career in his hometown Leipzig (in\nthe state of Saxony), as a lawyer and (private) lecturer at the\nuniversity there, but his controversial views and manner of expressing\nthem, in particular, in the monthly journal\nMonatsgespräche, led to the prohibition to publish and\nhold lectures (private and academic) in Leipzig (and Saxony) in 1690.\nHe was, however, welcome in the neighboring and comparatively more\nopen-minded Halle (in the state of Brandenburg/Prussia), and was\ninstrumental in founding the university there in 1694. He remained in\nHalle for the rest of his life, refusing an invitation to return to\nLeipzig in 1709. \n\nThomasius's body of work can be roughly divided into three parts. In\nhis early Leipzig years, he was primarily interested in matters of law,\nparticularly, following his father, in Pufendorf's natural law theory.\nThis period ends around 1688 with the publication of Institutiones\njurisprudentiae divinae (Institutions of Divine\nJurisprudence) in which he sought to complete Pufendorf's project\nof divorcing natural law from theology. This year, as well, saw the\npublication of Introductio ad philosophiam auliam\n(Introduction to Court Philosophy), a text that is somewhat\nmisnamed since it has less to do with proper conduct or even thought at\ncourt than with the proper use of reason, a topic that Thomasius would\ntake up in greater detail in his 1691 Introduction to the Doctrine\nof Reason. \n\nIn general, 1687–8 seems to have marked an endpoint of sorts and the\nbeginning of the second major stage, the more clearly philosophical\none, of Thomasius's life. Even though he would remain in Leipzig for\nanother two years, he had clearly broken with tradition by 1687, when\nhe began lecturing and publishing in German. In 1688, he began the\npublication of the controversial Monatsgespräche (which\nappeared monthly until April 1690) and turned his attention to matters\nof theoretical and practical philosophy. Here two sets of books, the\nEinleitung and Ausübung der Vernunftlehre\n(Introduction and Application of the Doctrine of\nReason), and the Einleitung and Ausübung der\nSittenlehre (Introduction and Application of Moral\nTheory) that appeared in Halle between 1691 and 1696 mark the\nsecond part of his career. Written by and large in German with a\nminimum of technical terminology, these books were intended not for an\naudience of experts, but instead, as the subtitle to the\nIntroduction to the Doctrine of Reason specifies, for a\ngeneral audience of “all rational persons of whatever social\nstanding and sex…” \n\nDuring the late 1690s (and after a religious crisis that led to an\nat least temporary (re)affirmation of his pietist beliefs), Thomasius\nproduced two works on metaphysics that endorsed a mystical variety of\nvitalism. In subsequent years, his interests shifted back to matters of\nlaw. This was the third part of his life and will not be further\nconsidered in this context. \n\nThomasius's philosophical stance was an empiricist one, not the\nrationalism that we find in much of the philosophical tradition and\nwith Wolff. It is true that his belief in natural human reason and its\ncapacity to find truth suggests a mild rationalism, but Thomasius\nabhorred innate ideas and maintained that all knowledge, all thought,\nbegins with sense perception. This strong sensationism (which has\nsimilarities with Locke's position) was coupled, as has already been\nnoted, with an enlightenment stance, in the sense that it was governed\nby the conviction that knowledge, truth and morality are the purview of\neveryone, not merely the elect few. The latter is particularly evident\nin the differentiation between Gelehrtheit and\nGelahrtheit that he drew at the outset of the Introduction\nto the Doctrine of Reason.Gelehrtheit or academic\nlearning is the domain of experts who are familiar with syllogistic\nlogic, metaphysics, epistemology, and theology, but\nGelahrtheit or practical learning is available to everyone\nwith a healthy reason who pursues knowledge not for its own sake but\nfor the use-value it has in daily life. \n\nThomasius's enlightenment convictions are similarly evident in his\neclecticism. Though generally deemed a negative stance, this is not\nthe case for Thomasius. He considers it positively as a corrective to\nany form of sectarian dogmatism. By his own account, he was influenced\nby several of his predecessors, notably, by Grotius in the Dutch\nRepublic and Pufendorf in Germany, and by Hobbes and Locke in England,\nand he appropriated those aspects of their theories that he found\nconducive to his overall aim: the spread of the Enlightenment ethos,\nunderstood here as the project of ensuring a healthy reason, one that\ncan discover truth, that can lay open contradictions and fight\nprejudices. \n\nGiven Thomasius's basic presuppositions of where knowledge is likely\nto be found (in daily life rather than abstract speculation) and who is\nmost likely to attain it (the person who has a healthy reason, not one\ncorrupted by prejudices), it is likely not surprising that his\nepistemology was not a theoretical one. His two books on theoretical\nphilosophy, the Introduction to the Doctrine of Reason and the\nApplication of the Doctrine of Reason, are books on truth.\nThey are not, however, books on truth in the traditional sense.\nThomasius did not develop a philosophical conception of truth or of the\ncondition of its possibility. He seems to have simply adopted a\ncorrespondence theory of truth and to have taken the harmony of thought\nand thing as a given. Certainly, this harmony was not the problem for\nhim that it was for 17th century thought and that it would\nbe again in the later part of the 18th century (with Wolff,\nKnutsen and Kant). What mattered to Thomasius is the enlightenment\noptimism that truth is possible and, moreover, accessible to everyone.\nHis Introduction, accordingly, was presented, as specified by\nthe book's subtitle, as providing the means by which “all rational\npersons, of whatever social standing and sex, are shown in an\nunderstandable manner, and without the aid of syllogisms, how to\ndifferentiate between the true, the probable and the false, and to find\nnew truths.” It is a book of instruction in proper or correct use of\nhealthy reason. \n\nHis Application continued this theme, though this time by\nproviding people with the means of avoiding error. Avoiding error\ninvolves the eradication of prejudices, which are among the causes of\nthe corruption of reason. That, in turn, is accomplished through what\nhe identifies as dogmatic doubt, not the Cartesian doubt that deems\neverything false so as to find a first indubitable principle, a useless\nenterprise, according to Thomasius. Dogmatic doubt is the doubt about\nparticular things, beliefs, and opinions, and this he found healthy and\nconducive to preventing error. \n\nThomasius's enlightenment convictions are not, however, as\nstraightforward as might appear. He did believe in natural reason's\ncapacity to overcome corruption, but even as he adhered to this view,\nhe held that an evil will is at the root of this corruption, and that\nwe require God's grace. This conflict is particularly evident in his\nmoral philosophy. While his initial presentation was an optimistic\naffirmation of the viability of a moral position he identified as one\ninvolving “rational love” (vernünftige Liebe) as the only\nmeans to a “happy, courteous and cheerful life,” as indicated by the\nsubtitle of the Introduction to Moral Theory, by 1696, he had\nbecome disenchanted with this view. Human self-interest and an evil\nwill stand in its way. \n\nThomasius's moral theory is a theory of the will. He held that in\nmoral matters, the will dominates reason. Though human beings have free\nchoice if not externally constrained, the will is not free. Rather, it\nis dominated by human affects; our passions, impulses, and desires.\nLike Hobbes, Thomasius believed that even though subject to such inner\n(psychological) constraints, the will still chooses (with the aid of\nreason); it consciously wills. And a conscious choice is precisely what\nis required for a (good) action to be considered moral, a good instinct\nor good inclinations may make us good, may even be desirable, but by\nitself this is not enough to make us moral. Morality requires a\nconscious act of will. The trouble with morality arises because the\nwill is determined by evil desires, in particular, lust, ambition, and\navarice. Although there are noble sentiments as well, which similarly\ninfluence the will, they are in conflict with the negative\ndispositions. The conflict can be brought to a positive conclusion only\nby appeal to divine grace (God's salvation). \n\nThis ambivalence and return to theology aside, Thomasius's moral\nposition is an interesting one. The theory of rational love is based on\nthe fundamental equality of human beings as well as on their ability to\nthink and choose independently (of authority). Ultimately, Thomasius's\nethics is a social ethics. The theory is other-directed, and given the\nabsence of laws and principles, constitutes a nice contrast to the\nformalist universalist ethics Kant would develop by the end of the next\ncentury. At the same time, the lack of any way of making this theory\napplicable in a context governed not by similar but instead by\nconflicting interests, makes something like a fomalist ethics an\ninevitability. By the end of the Introduction to Moral Theory,\neven Thomasius recognises that “rational love” will\nfunction only in relatively harmonious contexts, in others,\nparticularly those characterised by unequal power positions, justice\nmay well be required. \n\nIt is without question that Christian Wolff was the most important\nGerman philosopher in the early and middle portion of the eighteenth\ncentury. Dissatisfied with the, to his mind, arbitrary eclecticism\nadvocated by Thomasius and his ‘school,’ and equally\ndissatisfied with the scholastic school metaphysics which, he thought,\nlacked rigour, he produced a systematic philosophical system in reply.\nIndeed, his philosophy is reputed to constitute the most coherent\nsystematic whole produced in the 18th century prior to Kant.\nAs an enlightenment thinker, albeit a rationalist one, he was, like\nThomasius, committed to public education. He saw philosophy, which he\nconceived as world-wisdom (Welt-Weisheit), as the means to\npublic enlightenment and, in line with the mood of the time, the\npurview of everyone, not just of philosophers or experts. To make it\naccessible, he wrote in German, at least during his Halle years, and\nintroduced much of the German philosophical terminology that is still\nused (the concepts of Bewußtsein, Vorstellung,\nand Begriff have their origin here). \n\nWolff's birthplace was Breslau (then in Eastern Germany, now in\nPoland). At an early age, dissatisfied with orthodox theology, he\nturned to the study of mathematics as offering the best means to\ncertainty. He studied theology and mathematics at the University of\nJena and gained his Master's degree in Leizpig in 1702. Influenced by\nvon Tschirnhaus and while working in Leipzig as a private lecturer, he\nwrote a dissertation seeking to apply the mathematical method to\nproblems in practical philosophy. This drew Leibniz's attention to him.\nThey began a correspondence that continued until Leibniz's death in\n1716. Sponsored by Leibniz and von Tschirnhaus, he was appointed\nProfessor of Mathematics and Natural Science at the University of Halle\nin 1707. \n\nSince his position in Halle was predominantly as a teacher of\nmathematics — a task at which he excelled — Wolff did not begin\nlecturing and writing on philosophical matters until 1710. In\nmathematics, he produced textbooks, a four volume history of\nmathematics in 1710 and a mathematical dictionary in 1711. His\nphilosophical lectures were in the first instance expositions of\nLeibniz's philosophy, which led his opponents (the representatives of\nthe Thomasius ‘school’) to identify his philosophy as the\nLeibniz-Wolffian philosophy, a designation that remained despite his\nobjection. He began an extensive series of publications, in German and\noften identified as his German works, on philosophical topics — the\n“German Logic” in 1713, the “German\nMetaphysics” in 1719, the “German Ethics” in 1720,\nthe “German Politics” in 1721, the “German\nCosmology” in 1723, and the “German Theology” in\n1724, along with numerous short essays. Given his success as a teacher\nand fame as an author, he gained increasing prominence in Halle, much\nto the dismay of the “Thomasians” who had dominated\nphilosophical instruction there. It did not contribute to a smooth\ncollegial relationship that Wolff did not like Thomasius's eclectic\nphilosophy and did not hide his dislike. Matters came to a head in 1721\nwhen some political maneuvering on the part of his opponents (the\n“Thomasians” and the pietists) likely prompted by his own\nincreasing fame and popularity with the students combined with his\napparently difficult personality, brought him to the attention of the\nemperor in Berlin, Friedrich Wilhelm I, who expelled him from Prussia\nin 1723 on threat of hanging. \n\nHaving earlier been invited to the University of Marburg, he took up\nthe position there. At the time Marburg was a more cosmopolitan place\nthan Halle, and Wolff now had students from other countries. He saw\nhimself as speaking to Europeans, not merely Germans, and began writing\nin Latin. In fact, he produced a second series of books, in Latin and\nidentified as his Latin works, going over the same subject matter that\nhe had treated in his German texts, albeit in more detail. Though even\nmore scholastic than the earlier German texts, these books contributed\nto his fame in a much broader context (Europe rather than Germany). In\n1733, Friedrich Wilhelm I invited him to return to Prussia, but Wolff\ndeclined this invitation. He became increasingly well established, so\nmuch so that a cabinet order of 1739 required candidates for the\nministry to study Wolff's books, particularly his logic. In short\norder, Wolffians and Wolff societies could be found everywhere, even in\nPrussia. In 1740, Frederick the Great recalled him to Prussia, offering\na permanent fellowship in the Berlin Academy. Rather than accept the\ninvitation to Berlin, he returned to Halle to great acclaim and public\napprobation. To his disappointment, however, the mood in Halle had\nchanged, the residing Wolffians, in particular\n Baumgarten,\n had begun to develop his thought, and his\nlectures were not successful. Complaining about the poor quality of the\nstudents, he gave up lecturing but continued writing. \n\nWolff was not an original philosopher, but a modernizer and\nsystematiser. Rather than reject scholastic school philosophy outright,\nas Thomasius had done, he modernized and systematised it (and\nphilosophy as a whole). Systematizing philosophy meant integrating\ndifferent ideas from the philosophical tradition — Descartes's concept\nof substance, for instance, and Leibniz's theory of pre-established\nharmony. But while eclectic in this sense, unlike Thomasius's thought,\nWolff's was anything but arbitrary. Rather, he combined those\ningredients into a comprehensive system on the model of mathematics.\nMathematics was, for Wolff, a systematic science operating by\ndefinition and syllogistic proof, and this was the method he strove to\nmake applicable to philosophy. In philosophy, the method was cashed out\nin a combined analytic/synthetic manner. Definitions were arrived at\nanalytically — the analysis was to be of empirical matters and was to\nconvey simple ideas through a process of clarification, abstraction,\nand analysis. These were then combined into definitions. The\ndefinitions were to function as ingredients in the syllogisms that\nreturned, synthetically, to the empirical starting point, though it is\npresumably now understood why things are as they are, an understanding\nthat was, for Wolff, the goal of philosophy. \n\nThe first philosophy text Wolff produced was his “German\nLogic” (Vernünfftige Gedancken von den Kräften des\nmenschlichen Verstandes und ihrem richtigen Gebrauche in Erkenntnis der\nWahrheit). Logic is of central importance to Wolff because it sets\nout the rules for thought, which is understanding's ability to forge\nconnections, according to Wolff a uniquely human ability. All human\nbeings have natural understanding, but by itself this is not\nsufficient. Logic or the “art of demonstration” serves to\nrefine this natural capacity and functions, as well, as the condition\nof science. From the point of view of the enlightenment, it is\ninstructive here that Wolff insisted, as Thomasius had before him, that\nbook and memory learning is not the same as knowledge. That requires\nthe use of the powers of the understanding, and above all, much\npractice in the art of thought. While innate, the powers of\nunderstanding have to be honed through practice/experience. \n\nWolff's second philosophical treatise, the “German\nMetaphysics” (Vernünfftige Gedancken von Gott, der Welt\nund der Seele des Menschen, auch allen Dingen überhaupt)\nappeared some seven years after the “German Logic”. Just as\nthat had vindicated the discipline of logic against the early\nenlightenment attacks, so this vindicated the discipline of\nmetaphysics, understood as the “science of the possible as\npossible.” After a brief introductory chapter identifying his\nCartesian stance by linking existence to consciousness (we must exist\nbecause we are conscious of ourselves), the “German\nMetaphysics” treats ontology, empirical psychology, cosmology,\nrational psychology and natural theology. In the second chapter Wolff\nsets out the two (Leibnizian) principles governing his philosophical\nthought: the principle of contradiction (“something cannot both\nbe and not be at the same time” §10, 6) and the principle of\nsufficient reason (“everything that is must have a sufficient\nreason why it is” §30, 17). These are significant not only\nfrom the point of view of Wolff's thought but also in light of the role\nthey would play in early Kant-criticism. In the chapter on rational\npsychology (chapter 5), he defends the Leibnizian conception of\npre-established harmony (§765, 478-9) and, in the final chapter on\nnatural theology, he tells his readers that the world mirrors God's\nperfection (§1045, 648). These are aspects of Wolff's position\nwith which the (pietist) Thomasians would take issue. \n\nAfter the “German Metaphysics” appeared, Wolff published\nabout a book a year dealing with and integrating into his system other\ncentral philosophical matters: ethics in 1720, politics in 1721,\nphysics in 1723, teleology in 1724 and biology in 1724. \n\nThe ethics (Vernünfftige Gedancken von der Menschen Thun\nund Lassen, zu Berförderung ihrer Glückseligkeit) is\ncomposed of four parts, a theoretical part that treats the foundation\nof practical philosophy and three practical parts that present a\ndoctrine of duties that human beings have to themselves, to God, and to\nothers. Not surprisingly, given that Wolff believes the world to mirror\nGod's perfection, the issue in the ethics is perfection as well and\nnot, as with Thomasius, happiness (that is left for his politics).\nMoral perfection is the guideline by which we ought to choose between\ntwo (or more) equally possible actions. That is to say, when making a\nfree choice we ought to consider whether the action “promotes the\nperfection of our inner and outer state” (§2, 5) and that\nmeans considering whether the state of the soul and the body accords\nwith the prior state or contradicts it. The outcome has greater\nperfection to the extent that it contributes to the continued\n“natural human state and its harmonious preservation over\ntime”(§2, 5). The natural human state Wolff envisions is the\nstate of the soul in its manifold efforts to find truth, and everything\nhas to be done to maximize that state (see “German\nMetaphysics” §152, 79). It so happens, that this is where\nhappiness lies as well, and as Wolff indicates at the end of the\nethics, it is incumbent upon human beings to ensure not only their own\nperfection/happiness, but to “contribute as much as possible to\nthe happiness of others” (§767, 539). \n\nIn the “German Politics” (Vernünfftige\nGedancken von dem gesellschaftlichen Leben der Menschen und\ninsonderheit dem gemeinen Wesen), he proceeds to investigate the\nvarieties of human societies and to specify how they ought to be set up\nso as to “promote the uninhibited progression to the common\nbest” (§3, 3). A society must accord with the laws of\nnature, otherwise it cannot be considered a society, and accord with\nthe laws of nature surely means perfection/happiness. \n\nWolff's Latin works appeared with equal regularity in the 1730, with\nthe “Latin Logic” (Philosophia rationalis sive\nlogica) beginning the series in 1728. In spite of their greater\nthoroughness, or perhaps because of it, they were not as widely read\neither in Germany or Europe as a whole. Whereas the German texts went\nthrough several reprints (14 for the Logic, 10 for the Metaphysics),\nthe “Latin Logic” was only reprinted three times, and some\nof the other Latin texts perhaps twice. By the 1730s the German texts\nhad established Wolff's influence and the Latin texts did little to\nchange that. They will, accordingly, not be further considered in this\ncontext. \n\nBoth Thomasius and Wolff had followers. In Thomasius's case this was\nin spite of the fact that he claimed to have no desire to have\ndisciples or found a school. But given the influence he had on his\ncontemporaries, it would have been surprising if there had not been\nanyone who saw himself as following in his footsteps and, more\nimportantly, taking up his cause (against Wolff). Among Thomasius's\ncontemporaries to do so were Franz Budde (1667–1729), Joachim Lange\n(1670–1744), Andreas Rüdiger (1673–1731), and Adolf Friedrich\nHoffmann (1707–1741). Christian August Crusius (?1715–1775) was a later\nfollower (Hoffmann's student) who came on the philosophical scene when\nWolffianism was already starting to decline. \n\nWolff's followers were perhaps more varied than those following and\nrejecting Thomasius. Indeed, by the 1740s, Wolffianism had become the\nleading German philosophy and had spread to the major German\nuniversities: to Halle (with Wolff, A. G. Baumgarten, though he moved\non to Frankfurt an der Oder), G. F. Meier, and J. A. Eberhard, who is\nknown particularly for the role he played in early Kant-criticism), to\nMarburg where virtually every academic was a Wolffian, to Giessen (with\nJ. F. Müller, and Böhm), to Tübingen (with Georg\nBernhard Bilfinger, Israel Gottlob Ganz and Gottfried Plouquet), to\nLeipzig (with Gottsched and Ludovici), to Jena (with Johann Peter\nReusch and Joachim George Darjes), and to Königsberg (with\nKnutsen, Kant's teacher). \n\nThe reception of Wolff's philosophy is interesting not only in view\nof its widespread acceptance, but also in light of the disputes it\ngenerated and the further developments it gave rise to. Chief among\nthese disputes were (1) the attack by the pietists (Budde and Lange)\nthat led to Wolff's dismissal from Halle and (2) the attack by the\nThomasians (Hoffmann and Crusius). Further developments of the Wolffian\nphilosophy can be found particularly in the domain of\n aesthetics\n with Gottsched and Baumgarten. \n\nThe development of early and even mid-enlightenment thought in\n18th century Germany proceeded hand in hand with the then\nrelatively new (protestant) religious trend: pietism. Like the\ndiscontent that the representatives of the early enlightenment had with\nauthority and, at least in the early years, intellectual life, those of\npietism took issue with the (religious) orthodoxy and its\nintellectualism. Furthermore, rather than endorse obedience and\nconformity to the establishment, the pietist movement emphasized the\nsubjective aspect of faith: a person's experience, feeling, and, above\nall, personal participation in religious matters and performances. The\nemphasis on the subjective and personal, and on people's actual\nparticipation in religion made pietism an ideal companion for early\nenlightenment thought. At issue here was not academic competence, not\nthe cognitive aspect of religion, but its affective aspect with\nemphasis on devotion and practical service, just as what was at issue\nin the early enlightenment was not the intellectual aspect of reason,\nbut its practical performance and service. And both movements were\ncharacterized by a commitment to egalitarianism. \n\nThis is not to say that the parallel development was always or even\nnecessarily harmonious. In Halle, the chief representative of pietism\nwas August Hermann Francke (1663–1722), who had been brought there by\nThomasius. But Thomasius and Francke did not see eye to eye on all\nmatters. While Thomasius had endorsed Francke's practical activism (he\nwas the founder of the Halle orphanage), he broke with Francke by 1699,\ncriticising his educational policies for producing “uneducated,\nmelancholy, fantastic, obstinate, recalcitrant, and spiteful men”\n(cited in Beck, 253). It is not clear what, if any, philosophical\nreasons Thomasius had for turning against Francke. However, the details\nof their disagreement are not important for the development of\n18th century philosophy. \n\nBudde and Lange, both ultimately Professors of Theology at Jena and\nHalle respectively, developed Thomasius's thought in a theological\n(pietist) direction. That is to say, both, and Lange more so than\nBudde, emphasized the need for revelation to a greater extent that\nThomasius had done, as they also claimed that the source of evil was\nthe will and that the root cause of evil was original sin. Though\nThomasius could be found to hold these views as well, particularly\nduring the completion of his Application of Moral Theory,\ntheir difference from Thomasius lies in the emphasis they placed on\nthese views. Moreover, in his major work, Medicina Mentis,\nLange devoted a great deal of attention to demonstrating how the ill or\ncorrupt will and mind might be healed. \n\nIt is interesting that there were differences not just from the\ntheological dimension of Thomasius's thought, but also in the\nphilosophical respect. Here it is particularly noteworthy that in his\nphilosophical texts Budde sought a systematic whole and was not content\nto adopt Thomasius's more eclectic style. Though he claimed to be an\neclectic, he thought this did not entail that he could not provide a\nunified whole. That whole is provided by his three books in philosophy.\nThe theoretical philosophy can be found in the Institutiones\nPhilosophiae Eclecticae that appeared in two parts in Halle in\n1703. The two parts are the “Elementa philosophiae\ntheoreticae,” roughly a metaphysics, and the “Elementa\nphilosophiae instrumentalis,” Budde's logic. Along with the\nearlier work in practical philosophy, theElementae Philosophiae\nPracticae, originally published in 1697 but significantly revised\nfor the 1703 edition, these texts constitute Budde's philosophical\nsystem. \n\nRüdiger, Hoffmann, and Crusius were related through\nteacher-student relationships with Rüdiger teaching Hoffmann who\nthen taught Crusius. See below\n (Disputes)\n for an\naccount of the role they, and Crusius in particular, played in the\ndisagreement of the Thomasians with Wolff. \n\nWolff's enlightenment rationalism had made a decisive impact on the\nphilosophical scene in Germany in the 1720s. Over the middle years of\nthe 18thcentury, and against objections from both Thomasians\nand pietism, Wolffianism took hold, at least for a time. Certainly, the\nevents that led to his expulsion from Halle contributed to his\nnotoriety and fame. Philosophers took up his cause in virtually all the\nuniversities in Eastern and Northern Germany, occasionally developing\nhis philosophical system in different directions. Among the chief\nrepresentatives of Wolffianism were, in Leipzig, J. C. Gottsched\n(1700–1766), in Frankfurt an der Oder, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\n(1714–62) and H. F. Meier, who were instrumental in founding\nAesthetics, in Königsberg, Kant's teacher Martin Knutsen\n(1713–51). Wolffianism also played a central role in the early\ncriticisms of Kant's critical philosophy. There it was represented\nprimarily by Eberhard, Maaß, and Schwab and in the major review\njournal at the time, Nicolai's Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek.\n(See Allison, The Kant-Eberhard Controversy). There can be no\nquestion that Wolffianism dominated German universities during the\n1720s to the 1740s, though it disintegrated to some extent soon after\nhis death in 1754 with, among other things, the development of\naesthetics. \n\nGiven the two radically different approaches to issuing the\nenlightenment call to the independent use of reason that we find in the\n18th century, it is not surprising that the age should have\nits share of disputes. This was particularly evident in the\ndisagreements surrounding Wolff and Wolffianism. It has already been\nindicated above that two attacks in particular stand out (1) the attack\nthat led to his expulsion from Halle and (2) the attack that was\nmounted by Hoffmann and Crusius. \n\nThe first attack was mounted by Thomasius's pietist followers. They,\nin particular Budde and Lange, centered their opposition to Wolffianism\naround the fatalism and Spinozism they thought implied by his system.\nAlso, Wolff's dependence on the mathematical method and the\nsubordination of the divine will to necessity were questioned.\nSimilarly, the Leibnizian doctrine of pre-established harmony of soul\nand body that the critics attributed to Wolff was thought to be at odds\nwith the possibility of free will, and with that, responsibility for\nour actions. If the interaction of soul and body has to be pre-ordained\nor pre-established, then it is not possible that we could act otherwise\nthan we have been determined to act, and the notions of responsibility\nand sin are only a chimera. It must be added here that the critique of\nthe belief in a free will is justified. Wolff struggled with this\npossibility as much as Leibniz had done, and it is simply not clear\nthat given their adherence to pre-established harmony, either one\nmanaged to resolve the conundrum on the ontological level. \n\nIt is an interesting footnote to these disputes that while Thomasius\nhimself did not participate in these disputes, Wolff did. In 1724 he\npublished a detailed reply to Budde and Lange's critique of the German\nMetaphysics (Kleine Kontroversschriften mit Joachim Lange und\nJohann Franz Budde) and he also took their concerns up in the\nAnmerkungen to the German Metaphysics. \n\nThe second attack was mounted by those Thomasians who did not\nforeground their pietism, Andreas Rüdiger (1673–1731), Adolf\nFriedrich Hoffmann (1707–1741), and Christian August Crusius\n(?1715–1775). Rüdiger and Hoffmann attacked Wolff on a number of\nissues (the relation of mind and body, for instance, which they took to\nconstitute a unity, not two distinct substances, the difference between\nthe mathematical and the philosophical methods, and the question of the\nwill's role in ethics). At least some of these issues were taken up by\nCrusius, who was the last Thomasian to take issue with Wolff. \n\nCrusius did his philosophical work in Leipzig in the 1740s before\ntaking on the professorship of Theology in 1751. Like earlier\nThomasians, he questioned Wolff's subordination of the will to reason,\narguing for the freedom of the former against what he takes to be\nWolff's fatalism, though he was willing to concede that the will\nrequires understanding. Perhaps the most significant aspect of Crusius'\nthought was his differentiation between the philosophical and\nmathematical methods. Whereas mathematics is said to be grounded on the\nprinciple of contradiction, this is not the case for philosophy. That\nhas to do with real objects, with nature, its structures and forces,\nnot with the abstract and artificial concepts of mathematics. At the\nsame time, he also thought there was a role for mathematics in the\nanalysis of nature — it could provide concepts of bodies and their\nrelations. Of course, as his contemporaries pointed out, one wonders\nwhy mathematics should have a role in the investigation of the\n“real” world if the nature of its abstraction made it\ndistinct from the (concrete) real world. Crusius did not have an answer\nto these questions, but it was a topic that Kant would take on in his\npre-critical project. \n\nWith the decline of Wolffianism after 1754, German philosophy was\nfor a time at loose ends. The decline was prompted not only by the\ncriticisms offered by the Thomasians, but also by the internal\ndevelopments of Wolffianism proposed by various of Wolff's disciples.\nHermann Samuel Reimarus (1694–1768), for instance, developed a\nrationalist critique of revelation, arguing that for the rational\nperson religion had to be based on reason (Apologie oder\nSchützschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer Gottes,\npublished posthumously). Others began to extend Wolffianism into areas\nWolff himself had not considered, thereby contributing to significant\ndevelopment. Here the area of\n aesthetics\n is paramount. Moreover, by the middle of the 18th century,\nFrench, English, and Scottish texts(particularly\nHume's Inquiry and Locke's Essay) and some of the\ntexts by the\n common sense\n philosophers (Beattie, Oswald, and Reid) along with others began to be\navailable in translation, thus offering clear alternatives to Wolffian\nrationalism.  These texts were immensely influential. Recall Kant's\nclaim that his recollection of David Hume had awoken him from his\ndogmatic slumber (Prolegomena, Ak. IV, 260). The\nempiricists, for instance Feder and Garve, also played a significant\nrole in early Kant-criticism (see Beiser, The Fate of Reason\nand Sassen, Kant's Early Critics). By and large, the period\nof 18th century German philosophy after 1750 and before\n1781 was a period not of any one dominant school, but of individuals\nloosely associated with a number of different trends. Among\nindividuals who cannot be clearly assigned anywhere were Johann\nHeinrich Lambert, Moses Mendelssohn and Johann Nikolaus Tetens. Not\neither Thomasians or Wolffians, they must be considered in relation to\nKant's pre-critical and critical philosophy, not from the point of\nview of German philosophy prior to Kant. \n\nEven though Wolff sought to integrate virtually all aspects of\nphilosophy into his system, he had nothing to say about the philosophy\nof art. In some way this is not surprising if we consider that in the\nGermany of the early Enlightenment, the arts, particularly poetry and\nliterature, were as good as nonexistent. The German literary greats had\nnot even been born when Wolff wrote his German texts (Lessing was born\nin 1729, Herder in 1744, Goethe in 1749). First to develop a theory of\nthe arts, particularly poetry, was Johann Christoph Gottsched\n(1700–1766), who published his ‘Critical Poetry’\n(Versuch einer critischen Dichtkunst vor die Deutschen) in\n1730. Treating poetry scientifically, he set out a set of rules that\nwere to guide the composition. Given his conception of what a poem was\n(a moral fable) and given as well his idea of what was involved in its\ncomposition (a set of rules), there was little room here for beauty and\neven less for sentiment and inspiration. But sentiment and inspiration\nwas precisely the direction in which poetry was going by the middle of\nthe century. Gottsched's Wolffian philosophy of poetry, accordingly,\nwas quickly supplanted by Johann Jakob Breitinger's Critische\nAbhandlung (1740), a book that emphasized the a\nposteriori experience of poetry, not its rule-bound\ncomposition. \n\nA quasi-Wolffian synthesis of these two approaches was brought about\nby Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762), probably Wolff's most\nfamous disciple. Baumgarten produced two major texts, his metaphysics\nin 1739 (Metaphysica), which Kant would use as a textbook,\nand, in 1750 and 1758, his aesthetics (Aesthetica). That he\ndesignated the term ‘aesthetics’ to identify the philosophy\nof art, particularly poetry, would hardly be thought important had he\ndone nothing else. However, in developing the ‘field’ of\naesthetics, he also contributed significantly to the study of the\nsenses. Whereas Wolff had conceived of the senses merely as providing\nthe raw material for processing, a task performed by understanding and\ngoverned by the rules of logic, Baumgarten thought that the senses had\ntheir own rules and their own perfection, rules and perfection that\ndiffer from logical rules and the knowledge generated by logical\nprocessing. The rules of sensation are studied by the science of\nperception, which Baumgarten called aesthetics. But aesthetics is also\nthe study of poetry. In Reflections on Poetry he set out the\nnotion of aesthetic clarity. Although poetic representations are\nconfused representations (§14, 42), they have sensuous clarity.\nBaumgarten identified this clarity as extensive clarity to\ndifferentiate it from the intensive clarity of logic\n(§17, 43). Appealing to the senses, poetic representation can be\nmore illuminating than representations produced by logical processing\nand reasoning. Moreover, appealing to the affects, such representations\nare connected to pleasure. One cannot but see the influence that\nBaumgarten likely had on Kant's critical philosophy — his vindication\nof the senses reappears in an inherently Kantian way both in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic of the Critique of Pure Reason and in\nthe Critique of Judgment. \nGiven the absence of a dominant school of thought by roughly the\nmiddle of the century, German philosophers began to look elsewhere for\ninspiration.  One of the directions in which they looked was to\nScottish common sense thought, as articulated, for instance, by Thomas\nReid (1710–1796), James Beattie (1735–1803), and James\nOswald (1703–1793).  Common sense was then not new to Germany;\nthe notion had first been introduced by Thomasius as\n“healthy” or “common” reason, but Thomasius\nhad been more interested in commonsense reasoning in the practical\ndomain than in the epistemological and metaphysical implications of\nthe notion (on Thomasius, see above). \n\nCommon sense philosophy appeared in Germany beginning in the 1760s.\nWork by Beattie, Oswald, and Reid was translated into German and\nFrench, then better known in Germany than English, and it was also\nwidely reviewed in both German and French journals (for details, see\nthe Bibliography).  It appealed to German thinkers at least in part\nbecause they believed it offered a reply to scepticism.  \n\nHere it is instructive that Feder, the leader of the Göttingen\nempiricists, who had been responsible for the first review of the\nfirst edition of the Critique of Pure Reason that was received\nnegatively by Kant (see Kant's Early Critics, 7–9,\n53–58), also reviewed Reid's work, but provided a much more\npositive evaluation of the latter.  Indeed, he identified\nReid's Essay as “one of the most important products of\nspeculative philosophy” (Philosophische Bibliothek 1, 1788,\n43).  This stands in stark contrast to his evaluation of\nthe Critique where he complained that Kant had needlessly\nconfused language, thereby hiding the, to him, unfortunate idealist\nimplications of Kant's philosophy (Kant's Early Critics, 58).\nAlthough there were certainly other figures in eighteenth century\nGermany to discuss common sense (for instance, Eberhard, Tetens,\nMendelssohn), I single out Feder because he was an influential figure\nat the time and played a central role in early Kant-criticism. \n\nIn view of the availability of at least some of the texts of the\nScottish common sense philosophers and their discussion in the\nliterature, it is legitimate to assume that Kant would have been\nfamiliar with the work available in translation (see also\nKuehn, Scottish common Sense in Germany, 167–207).\nKant did discuss common sense in the critical philosophy.  In\nthe Prolegomena, for instance, we find the well known\ncondemnation of Reid, Oswald, and Beattie (erroneously, along with\nPriestley, who was not a common sense philosopher).  Hume, by\ncontrast, is considered a “deep thinker”, not one who is\ncontent to appeal to common sense or common understanding as if that\nwould answer the most difficult metaphysical questions (AA IV,\n260ff).","contact.mail":"sassenb@mcmaster.ca","contact.domain":"mcmaster.ca"}]
