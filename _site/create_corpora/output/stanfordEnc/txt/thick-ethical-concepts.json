We don’t evaluate\nactions and persons merely as good or bad, or right or wrong, but also\nas kind, courageous, tactful, selfish, boorish, and cruel. The latter\nare examples of thick concepts, the general class of which includes\nvirtue and vice concepts such as generous and\nselfish, practical concepts such as shrewd\nand imprudent,\nepistemic concepts such as open-minded and\ngullible, and aesthetic concepts such as banal\nand gracious. These\nconcepts stand in an intuitive contrast to those we typically express\nwhen we use thin terms such as right, bad,\npermissible, and ought. (Concepts are often regarded\nas non-linguistic representational items that can serve as the\nmeanings of linguistic expressions and as constituents of\npropositions; terms are linguistic items that can be used to express\nconcepts. The precise relation between concepts and language may be\ncomplicated, however. In what follows, small capitals denote concepts\nand italics denote terms.) Typically when someone calls an action bad,\nthey evaluate it negatively without committing themselves to much if\nanything by way of non-evaluative description. This descriptive\nthinness of bad makes it more general than\nselfish or cruel. Even\nif calling something selfish evaluates it as bad in some way or\nrespect, not just any bad act can count as selfish; it must also\ninvolve the agent giving a certain degree of priority to herself over\nothers. So the application of thick terms and concepts seems somehow\nto involve both evaluation and non-evaluative description.\n\n\nIt is primarily this combination of evaluation and non-evaluative\ndescription that has attracted philosophical attention to thick\nconcepts in ethics since the mid-twentieth century. Thick concepts\nhave been thought to provide leverage in various debates concerning\nthe nature of evaluative thought and talk and to illuminate such\nquestions as whether there is a robust fact-value distinction, whether\nethical claims enjoy a significant kind of objectivity, and how\nevaluative classifications relate to non-evaluative classifications.\nDoing justice to the full diversity and complexity of moral thinking\nhas also been thought to require more attention to thick concepts. The\nfocus on thin concepts over the thick in much of the history of\nWestern moral philosophy threatens to simplify and mislead also in\nnormative ethics, where the revival of virtue ethics as a major\nalternative to deontology and consequentialism coincides with\nincreased attention to thick terms and concepts in metaethics.\nInterest in thick concepts has also extended from ethics to other\nareas of philosophy such as epistemology and aesthetics. Several\nquestions run through all these motivations for focusing on thick\nconcepts. We have a “combination question”: how exactly do\nthick terms and concepts combine evaluation and non-evaluative\ndescription? We have a “location question”: is evaluation\nsomehow inherent to thick terms and concepts, such as perhaps an\naspect of their meaning, or merely a feature of their use? We have a\n“delineation question”: how do thick terms differ from the\nthin and from other kinds of evaluative terms (such as pejorative\nexpressions)? Given answers to these questions, what broader\nsignificance within ethics and applications outside of ethics might\nthick ethical concepts have? What follows is a survey of various\nattempts to answer these questions.\n\nThe designation “thick concept” for concepts that combine\nevaluation and non-evaluative description originates in Bernard\nWilliams’s Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy\n(Williams 1985). Williams seems to have drawn the label\n“thick” from the notion of “thick description”\nintroduced by Gilbert Ryle and adapted to other purposes by the\nanthropologist Clifford Geertz. Ryle characterizes thick descriptions\nas descriptions of human activities not as mere bodily motions but as\ninvolving intentional and purposive detail which help us to understand\nthose activities (Ryle 1968). In Geertz’s terminology thickness\nis a matter of the culturally specific significance of such details\n(Geertz 1973). Unlike thick concepts, thick descriptions in\nRyle’s and Geertz’s senses needn’t involve\nevaluation. But one connection to Williams’s terminology is that\nmany thick concepts incorporate culturally specific information (cf.\nScanlon 2003). Different societies might have sufficiently different\nunderstandings of courage to have distinct concepts of it, and some\nmight lack a concept altogether. There is similar cultural specificity\nto the kind of sexual morality in which chaste\nplays a role and the kind of honor culture in which noble\nhas a point (cf. Williams 1985: 141ff.). While\nthe terminology of “thick” and “thin” concepts\noriginates in Williams, he wasn’t the first to spot the\ndistinction he uses these labels to pick out. For instance, when R.M.\nHare distinguishes “primarily” and\n“secondarily” evaluative words in The Language of\nMorals, his examples of the former are paradigmatic thin concepts\nand some of his examples of the latter are paradigmatic thick\nconcepts. (Hare 1952: 121–2; see also the discussion of\npersuasive definitions in Stevenson 1938.) \nThe examples of thick and thin terms and concepts with which we began\nexhibit an intuitive contrast: terms like generous,\ncruel, and tactful appear descriptively more\nspecific or rich in content than terms such as wrong or\ngood, which seem more general or more purely evaluative. Even\nif calling something selfish evaluates it as bad in some way or\nrespect, not just any bad act can count as selfish; it must also\ninvolve the agent giving some significant degree of priority to\nherself over others. How this intuitive contrast is best understood is\nsubject to several controversies and may have no theory-neutral\nanswer. \nFirst, in saying that thick terms and concepts are in some sense both\nevaluative and descriptive, what is meant by these notions?\nIllustrative examples of descriptive terms include square,\ngold, wombat, spotted, recursive,\nbeer, unequal in income, and (plausibly)\npainful. Paradigmatic examples of evaluative terms include\nthin terms such as good, bad, ought,\nright, and wrong. We cannot distinguish the\nevaluative and the descriptive simply in terms of different functions\nin our thought and talk. For if judgments involving thick concepts are\nevaluative judgments, then cognitivists and non-cognitivists disagree\nabout their function. According to non-cognitivists, the primary\nfunction of evaluative terms is to express and induce conative\nattitudes, such as desire, preference, or (dis)approval, which\naren’t truth-apt. (A desire for world peace is no more the sort\nof thing that can be true or false than a command like “Shut\nup!”) But according to cognitivists, evaluative terms are like\ndescriptive terms in that their primary function is to express\ncognitive states such as beliefs, which are apt to be assessed as\n(robustly) true or false. Nor can we capture the distinction between\nthick and thin terms by identifying the descriptive with the factual:\nto assume that evaluations cannot be factual would be to assume the\nkind of distinction between “facts” and\n“values” which thick concepts are sometimes thought to\nundermine (see\n section 2.1).\n In neutral terms we may not be able to do much better than to say\nthat the purely descriptive terms are given by a big list of terms\nthat would generally be classified as falling on the is-side\nof the distinction between is and ought and all the\nrest are evaluative terms (Jackson 1998: 120). Descriptive terms would\nthus be purely non-evaluative. This boundary may not be sharp; in\nparticular, it might be vague whether thick terms such as\nhonest should be classified as purely descriptive or partly\nevaluative (Jackson 1998: 120). And even if not vague, it is a matter\nof controversy, as we’ll see in\n section 4.\n In any case, if we take the evaluative to exclude only the\npurely non-evaluative, then non-evaluative description will\nbe something given in purely non-evaluative terms. The interesting\nfeature of thick terms and concepts is that even if they count as\nevaluative on a binary distinction, they are supposed to straddle the\ndistinction. \nSecond, it is remarkably difficult to find a suitably neutral positive\ncharacterization of what thick concepts are, beyond the idea that they\nsomehow combine evaluation and non-evaluative description. Williams\ncharacterizes the application of thick concepts as both\n“action-guiding” and “guided by the world”:\ntheir application depends on the way the world is, but also “if\na concept of this kind applies, this often provides someone with a\nreason for action” (Williams 1985: 140; see also Moore 2006;\nHeuer 2012; Smith 2013: 102–5). By contrast, the application of\nthin evaluative concepts is supposed to be purely action-guiding and\nnot world-guided. But moral realists presumably think that the\napplication of thin concepts is also world-guided: whether a thin\nconcept truly applies depends on how the world of objective values\nlies. Other existing characterizations either suffer from similar\nproblems in failing to characterize thick concepts, or else are either\nnot very informative or too theory-laden (see, e.g., Gibbard 1992,\nDancy 1995, Scanlon 2003, Kyle 2020, and for critical discussion\nEklund 2011). \nThird, the intuitive contrast between thick and thin terms as terms\nthat somehow combine evaluation and non-evaluative description\nclassifies as thick not only paradigmatic thick concepts in the style\nof cruel, courageous,\nand kind, but also\n“respect-relative” evaluative concepts, pejorative terms,\nand more. The claims “This is a good knife” or\n“Charlie is good with children” ascribe ways of being good\nin certain non-evaluatively described respects. Not just any good\nthing can be a good knife; it must also be a knife, and knife\nis a non-evaluative concept. Similarly,\nspeaking of people as “krauts” or “wingnuts”\ninvolves evaluating them negatively on the basis of, respectively,\ntheir nationality and political affiliation, and calling someone a\njerk involves evaluating him (it usually is a he) negatively for\nhaving certain sorts of non-evaluative features that make a person\nunlikeable. But it is controversial whether paradigmatic thick\nconcepts work in the same way as concepts for specific ways of being\ngood and pejoratives. It is also unclear whether\n“affective” terms such as admirable and\ncontemptible are substantially similar to paradigmatic thick\nterms and concepts. Finally, some philosophers investigate “dual\ncharacter concepts” (for an overview and references, see Reuter\n2019). These are supposed to be similar to thick concepts in involving\nboth description and evaluation, but distinctive in that their\ndescriptive and evaluative dimensions, while related, are independent.\nFor instance, there is a sense in which a person may count as an\nartist if certain descriptive conditions, such as making sculptures\nfor a living, are met. But there is also a sense in which a person may\ncount as an artist if she satisfies norms concerning what an artist\nshould be or do. A person may count as an artist in one sense\nbut not the other. This might be regarded as evidence that\nartist encodes two independent dimensions of content, which\nare weighted differently in different contexts of use. One alternative\nanalysis of such different uses of words like artist is that\nthese words are polysemous. In that case they would stand for\ndifferent concepts in different occurrences, rather than one concept\nwith multiple dimensions of content. The relationship between dual\ncharacter and thick concepts may thus depend on what notion of\nconcepts we work with. This issue has rarely been addressed in detail\nin the literature on thick concepts. Either way, questions arise\nconcerning whether dual character concepts and thick concepts are\nnormative or evaluative in the same kind of way and whether some\nconcepts might be both thick and dual character. Some suggest that empirical\ninvestigation can shed light on the nature of dual character concepts\nand their relation to thick concepts (Reuter 2019; Liao et\nal. 2020).  \nDespite these complications in characterizing thick terms and\nconcepts, they are widely agreed to be of potentially high\nsignificance. An important assumption in many metaethical debates is\nthat the evaluative and the non-evaluative can be sharply\ndistinguished. If the evaluative and non-evaluative aspects of thick\nterms or concepts aren’t separable into distinct components,\nthese debates may be impacted in a fundamental way. Starting with some\nprominent arguments in the literature concerning the significance of\nthick concepts will naturally lead us to fundamental questions about\ntheir nature. \nIt is one thing to say that thick concepts are a distinctive kind of\nevaluative concepts, another to say that this gives them distinctive\nphilosophical significance not carried by thin concepts. Among various\narguments which attribute distinctive significance to thick terms and\nconcepts, two have been particularly influential: arguments concerning\nthe “is-ought gap” and the distinction between\nfacts and values, and the “anti-disentangling” argument.\nWe’ll also briefly address questions bearing on the relative\npriority of thick and thin concepts in evaluative thought. \nIt is common to think that the intuitive contrast between is\nand ought marks an important gap between distinct domains,\nand sometimes this gap is identified as a distinction between\n“facts” and “values”. Thick concepts may be\nthought to challenge such dichotomies between facts and values\n(Murdoch 1970; Williams 1985: 140–5; Dancy 1995; Putnam 2002:\n34–45). To avoid misunderstanding, note that an important gap\ncan be held to exist even if values are a special kind of facts. For\ninstance, according to so-called Hume’s Law, one cannot derive\nan ought from an is (Hume 1739–40:\n§3.1.1). Any (non-trivial) valid argument for an evaluative\nconclusion must somehow (perhaps implicitly) involve evaluative\ncontent in its premises. This logical or conceptual barrier can be\ngeneralized to concern various relations of reasonable inference\nbetween the non-evaluative and the evaluative. The underlying thought\nis that evaluative and normative statements commend things and guide\naction, whereas purely non-evaluative statements play no such\npractical role by themselves. The resulting claim that there is no\nreasonable (non-trivial) inference to any evaluative conclusion from\nany set of purely non-evaluative premises is sometimes called\n“the autonomy of ethics” (Rynin 1957; Prior 1960). \nEven if evaluative conclusions that deploy thin terms such as\nright and wrong cannot be derived from purely\nnon-evaluative premises, a conceptual gap between evaluative and\nnon-evaluative statements requires the same to be true also of\nevaluative conclusions that deploy thick terms. Philippa Foot argues\nthat thick terms such as rude undermine the is-ought\ngap: calling something rude is evaluative because it expresses\ncondemnation in the same kind of way as bad and\nwrong do, but this evaluation can be derived from a\nnon-evaluative description (Foot 1958). Consider the following\ninference: \nFoot claims that it would be inconsistent to accept O but deny\nR (Foot 1958: 507–9). But then it would seem that a thick\nevaluative claim, namely that x is rude, is an analytic\nconsequence of a purely non-evaluative claim: part of what\nrude means is that anything that causes offense by indicating\nlack of respect is rude. (Foot targets her argument at\nnon-cognitivists such as R.M. Hare, but the issue arises wherever a\nstatement deploying a thick term is counted as evaluative in\nmeaning.) \nA common reply is that Foot’s argument yields absurd\nconsequences when applied to thick terms that one regards as\nobjectionable, as embodying values that should be rejected. Many\npeople regard the thick terms chaste and lewd as\nobjectionable because they reject the kind of sexual morality these\nterms are normally used to convey. Atheists are likely to regard\nblasphemous and sinful as objectionable on similar\ngrounds, and a laissez-faire capitalist who thinks that there\nis nothing bad about selfishness may well regard selfish as\nobjectionable in its normal negative use. Whether one regards a\nconcept as objectionable depends on whether the values the concept is\nassociated with are ruled out by one’s own values; a concept is\nin fact objectionable if the values it embodies ought in fact to be\nrejected. Consider now inferences that are identical in form to\nFoot’s but deploy objectionable thick terms: \nIf O analytically entails R and R commits us to a\ncondemnation of its object, then O already commits us to this\nnegative attitude. O* should then likewise commit us to a\nnegative attitude towards its object. But there is no inconsistency in\naccepting that some actions are overt sexual displays and yet refusing\nto condemn anything merely for being an overt sexual display. The\npoint is clearer still if thick claims entail thinner claims to the\neffect that something is good or bad in a certain way. \nx causes offense by indicating lack of respect.\n\nSo, x is rude.\n\nSo, x is bad in a certain way. \nx is an overt sexual display.\n\nSo, x is lewd.\n\nSo, x is bad in a certain way. \nIf these entailments hold, then, by the transitivity of entailment,\nthe non-evaluative claim “x is an overt sexual\ndisplay” commits anyone who accepts it to the claim that\nx is bad in a certain way. But there is no inconsistency in\naccepting the former and rejecting the latter. What one seems to be at\nmost required to accept is that x is lewd in some\nnon-evaluative sense. The English language might have no other word\nfor expressing that evaluatively neutral sense, but there are various\nways to indicate that one means lewd in that way, such as\nusing scare quotes or a certain tone of voice. Exactly the same should\nthen go for rude. So Foot is mistaken about what\n“x is rude” entails. (This reply is modeled on R.M.\nHare’s reply that Foot’s argument delivers the wrong\nresults for formally identical inferences that involve racial or\nethnic slurs; see Hare 1963: 188–9, and also Eklund 2011.\nSubstituting slurs with objectionable thick terms allows us to bracket\nthe issue whether slurs and thick terms are evaluative in the same\nway. Hare’s basic reply to Foot needn’t suppose that they\nare. For discussion, see\n section 4\n of the supplementary document\n “Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance”.) \nIt is unclear whether this reply shows that the is-ought\ninferences Foot asks us to consider are invalid. The fact that someone\nwho regards lewd as objectionable refuses to condemn overt\nsexual displays doesn’t show that it is impossible for O*\nto be true while L is false. Perhaps someone who accepts\nO* but refuses to assert L (unless it is clear that she\nis using lewd in an evaluatively neutral sense) is like\nsomeone who refuses to say about prunes what she has already accepted\nabout dried plums (Foot 1958: 509). Refusing to call something a prune\nmakes it no less true that it is a prune. Perhaps the same is true of\nthick terms and the non-evaluative descriptions that Foot claims can\nbe used in their stead. Either way, these complications prompt the\nquestion of how tightly thick and thin terms are connected. \nWhether thick terms help undermine the is-ought gap depends\non the way in which thick terms are evaluative. If at least some thick\nterms are such that the sentences in which they figure are entailed by\nnon-evaluative sentences and the evaluations they convey belong to\ntheir meanings or truth-conditions, then thick terms would constitute\ncounterexamples to the is-ought gap. It couldn’t be\nthat O is true but R is false. If thick terms like\nrude have truth-conditional equivalents such as O that\nare evaluatively neutral, the evaluation might attach to rude\nonly as a matter of linguistic convention and not be entailed by the\npropositions that rude is used to express. If the evaluative\ncontents of thick terms were in this way “detachable” from\nthe propositions they are used to express, they would undermine at\nmost a linguistic is-ought gap at the level of thick terms\nand sentences, but not a conceptual is-ought gap at the level\nof thick concepts and propositions. Another possible view is that\nthick terms aren’t evaluative even by linguistic convention, but\nare merely commonly used evaluatively. Then thick terms couldn’t\nbe invoked to undermine even a linguistic is-ought gap. (Here\nnote a terminological matter. Some who think that evaluation is only\npragmatically associated with terms like courageous or\nrude take this to mean that there are no thick concepts, but\nonly loaded words; see Blackburn 1992 and, on the general phenomenon,\nStevenson 1938. This is what we should say if a thick concept must be\nboth evaluative and descriptive as a matter of meaning. Others who\naccept a pragmatic view are happy to talk about terms or concepts such\nas courageous or rude as thick, using\n“thick” to refer to terms and concepts that\ncharacteristically involve both evaluation and non-evaluative\ndescription in some way or other; see Väyrynen 2013. This entry\nadopts the latter usage.) This “location question”\nconcerning how thick terms are related to the evaluations they\nnormally convey is the topic of\n section 4. \nThe is-ought gap discussed above is a gap between different\nkinds of representations, whether linguistic or conceptual. This kind\nof gap is what philosophers sometimes have in mind when they\ndistinguish “facts” and “values”. But\nsometimes they mean an ontological gap between facts and values or\nevaluative and non-evaluative facts and properties. Even if there is a\nlinguistic or conceptual gap among our evaluative and non-evaluative\nrepresentations, it doesn’t directly follow that there are no\nthick evaluative properties that aren’t separable into distinct\nevaluative and non-evaluative components (Eklund forthcoming). Such\nproperties would violate a sharp ontological distinction between\nvalues and non-evaluative facts. But that debate concerns moral\nmetaphysics rather than thick concepts. \nThick terms and concepts challenge the is-ought gap only if\nthey are evaluative in meaning and have analytically sufficient\nnon-evaluative application conditions. It also seems plausible that\nthick terms and concepts have some necessary non-evaluative\napplication conditions. A bad act can be selfish only if it involves\ngiving greater priority to oneself over others in some way and rude\nonly if it causes offense, a good act can be generous only if it\ninvolves giving to others out of one’s own resources. An\nargument offered by John McDowell is often interpreted as showing that\nthere can be no non-evaluative description that is both necessary and\nsufficient for the application of a thick term and, moreover, that\nthis bears on whether the evaluative and non-evaluative aspects of\nthick terms and concepts are separable into distinct components\n(Williams 1985: 140–1; Dancy 1995; Kirchin 2010). \nMcDowell is concerned with \nwhether, corresponding to any value concept, one can always isolate\n… a feature that is there … independently of\nanyone’s value experience being as it is. (McDowell 1981 [1998]:\n200–1) \nHe targets non-cognitivism in particular as a view that requires the\npossibility of isolating a non-evaluative feature of this kind.\nMcDowell’s argument against this possibility is often called the\n“disentangling argument” (1981 [1998]: 202; cf. 216). \nGiven the conclusion, the label “anti-disentangling\nargument” would seem more accurate (Roberts 2011). In support of\n(D2), McDowell asks us to imagine “a specific conception of some\nmoral virtue … current in a reasonably cohesive moral\ncommunity” and then consider an “outsider” to the\nevaluative perspective of those who deploy the concept (McDowell 1981\n[1998]: 201). An example might be someone who cannot even\nimaginatively engage with the kind of sexual morality that is normally\nconveyed by applying lewd to overt sexual display. Many\npeople find it implausible that such an outsider could master the\nextension of lewd by grasping a non-evaluative content that\napplies to all and only the items the insiders call lewd\n(assuming there is one), and that this is so in principle, not merely\nbecause of the contingent limitations of our language. Unless there is\na way to grasp the extension without engaging with insiders’\nevaluative perspective, it would seem that evaluative classifications\nare in principle not graspable with purely non-evaluative\nrepresentational resources (McDowell 1981 [1998]: 216). \nThe key question for present purposes is how the anti-disentangling\nargument bears on thick terms and concepts. (On the argument itself,\nsee Lang 2001; Miller 2003: 250–4; and Roberts 2011, 2013a.) The\nquestion isn’t straightforward. McDowell makes a general claim\nabout evaluative terms. But many writers take it to bear on how thick\nterms and concepts combine evaluation and non-evaluative description,\nspecifically by favoring Inseparability over Separability (Williams\n1985; Kirchin 2010): \nSeparability: The evaluative and non-evaluative aspects of\nthick terms and concepts are distinct components that can at least in\nprinciple be “disentangled” from one another. (Hare 1952:\n121–2; Hare 1981: 17–8, 73–5; Blackburn 1992, 1998:\n101ff.; Burton 1992; Miller 2003: 244–54; Richard 2008:\n28–33; Elstein and Hurka 2009; Smith 2013; Kyle 2020) \nInseparability: Thick terms and concepts are or represent\nirreducible fusions of evaluation and non-evaluative description which\ncannot be “disentangled”. (Williams 1985: 129–30,\n140–1; Putnam 2002: ch. 2; Kirchin 2010, 2017: ch. 2; Roberts\n2011; Harcourt and Thomas 2013) \nSaying that the anti-disentangling argument favors Inseparability over\nSeparability misstates the case, however. The argument gets a grip on\nthick terms only under the following assumption: \nDescriptive Equivalence: For every thick term or concept,\nsomeone has or could acquire an independently intelligible purely\nnon-evaluative description with the same extension. \nAccording to Descriptive Equivalence, the extensions of thick terms\nare determined only by their non-evaluative content; evaluative\ncontent makes no difference to what things fall under a thick term. If\nthis means that an outsider who doesn’t share the evaluative\noutlook associated with a thick concept should nonetheless be able to\nanticipate the insiders’ use, then the anti-disentangling\nargument rules out Descriptive Equivalence. But that favors\nInseparability only if Separability entails Descriptive Equivalence;\nas we’ll see in\n section 3,\n that assumption is highly controversial. (For problems with\nDescriptive Equivalence itself, see Sreenivasan 2001.) \nSignificant issues are at stake here. If Separability entails\nDescriptive Equivalence but Descriptive Equivalence is false, then\nthick terms and concepts cannot be analyzed or reduced to thin\nevaluation plus non-evaluative description. For instance,\nrude couldn’t mean bad for causing offense by\nindicating lack of respect. In that case, thin terms\nwouldn’t enjoy conceptual or explanatory priority over the\nthick, and moral theorists would risk ignoring or distorting a\nsubstantial range of moral phenomena if they focused exclusively on\nthe thin. But if Separability doesn’t entail Descriptive\nEquivalence, thick concepts may be explicable in terms of thin\nevaluation plus non-evaluative description even if the\nanti-disentangling argument is sound. \nThe debate discussed above has largely supposed that a descriptive\nequivalent would be encoded in the meaning of a thick term, and thus\nwould presumably be something that competent speakers should in\nprinciple be able to articulate. But we would struggle to say what the\nvery many ways of being cruel, for instance, have in common without\nrelying on our understanding of cruel (Little 2000: 279). Our\npoor track record in capturing the extensions of thick terms in\nindependently intelligible non-evaluative terms should then count\nagainst Descriptive Equivalence. But note that, so far as the\nanti-disentangling argument goes, a non-evaluative description could\nbe necessarily extensionally equivalent to an evaluative term or\nconcept without belonging to the latter’s meaning. An evaluative\nconcept could be held to have a non-evaluative “shape” as\na matter of a necessary a posteriori equivalence, perhaps in\nthe way that the necessary synthetic equivalence of “x is\nwater” and “x is H2O” is\ndiscoverable only a posteriori. (D1) clearly allows this\npossibility. (D2) must then remain plausible if ‘possible’\nis read as including the possibility of mastering the extension of an\nevaluative term by latching onto a non-evaluative necessary\nextensional equivalent (provided there is one) in an a\nposteriori way. The notion of disentangling in McDowell’s\nargument is therefore not semantic or conceptual. The argument’s\nreal conclusion seems rather to be: \nShapelessness: The extensions of evaluative terms and\nconcepts aren’t unified under independently intelligible\nnon-evaluative relations of real similarity, not even as a matter of\nsynthetic a posteriori truth that isn’t settled by the\nmeanings of evaluative terms or concepts. (Miller 2003: 250–4;\nKirchin 2010; Roberts 2011, 2013a; Väyrynen 2014) \nIf Shapelessness were true, that would explain why the sort of\ndisentanglement targeted by McDowell’s argument isn’t\npossible. Indeed, the non-evaluative shapelessness of the evaluative\nis often thought to provide a particularly good explanation of why\n(D2) is plausible (Roberts 2011: 506). \nAlthough Shapelessness is a general issue about evaluative concepts,\nits bearing on thick concepts is worth noting. Suppose an outsider\ncould anticipate insiders’ use of an evaluative term in new\ncases by using similarities between old cases and new cases to infer\nwhether the evaluative term applies in the new cases. Shapelessness\nentails that such similarities would have to be evaluative. If so,\nDescriptive Equivalence is false. Conversely, insofar as the\nextensions of evaluative terms can be mastered on the basis of\nnon-evaluative similarities, Shapelessness is false. The way thick\nterms involve non-evaluative description may be thought to make them a\nparticularly suitable test case for these general issues about\nevaluative concepts. But note, finally, that thick concepts do so only\nif their evaluative aspects are somehow built into them, such as\nperhaps as a matter of meaning. The commitment here is to: \nInherently Evaluative: The meanings of thick terms and\nconcepts somehow contain evaluation. \nThis generic thesis covers a range of options regarding what sort of\nevaluation the meanings of thick terms and concepts might be thought\nto contain and how they contain it. Some version of Inherently\nEvaluative clearly is presupposed by Inseparability. By contrast,\nSeparability allows (though doesn’t entail) that thick terms and\nconcepts might convey evaluation only pragmatically, as a matter of\nuse. Different answers to this location question are, again, the topic\nof\n section 4. \nThick concepts and their relation to the thin bear also on knowledge\nin ethics. Bernard Williams famously claims that, unlike in science,\nin ethics “reflection can destroy knowledge” (1985: 148;\nsee also Williams 1995). Thick terms and concepts are parochial, in\nthat they tend to have “interest” or a “point”\nonly in the context of some particular evaluative outlooks or\npractices. The notion of lewdness as we know it really only has a life\nwithin a particular kind of sexual morality. That is why those who\nregard lewd as an objectionable term typically refrain from\nusing it. Industriousness seems to count as a positive quality only\nagainst some such evaluative frame as the Protestant work ethic.\n(Otherwise, what’s the point?) This would explain why, as (D2)\nin the anti-disentangling argument claims, an unsympathetic outsider\nmight not be able to master the extensions that particular moral\ncommunities assign to their thick terms. Now consider what Williams\ncalls a “hypertraditional society”: a maximally homogenous\nand minimally reflective society whose ethical reflection only employs\nthick concepts (Williams 1985: 142). Suppose T expresses one of\ntheir thick concepts in their language. And suppose that claims of the\nform x is T can express truths and qualify as\nknowledge (see also Williams 1995). Williams suggests that a judgment\ninvolving a thin concept such as good or bad\n“is essentially the product of\nreflection” (Williams 1985: 146). Since the hypertraditional\nsociety is unreflective, its members don’t deploy good\nor bad. In that case we\ncannot suppose that T entails either. Now suppose a person from\nthe hypertraditional society has knowledge that x is T\nbut comes to reflect on her practices and acquires thin concepts. If\nthick concepts reflect social worlds, reflection that stands back from\nsocial practices must rely on thin concepts. Through reflection, the\nperson may come to reject her traditional way of life and the\nevaluative perspective that goes with it, inferring from x\nis T that x is bad. Or she may come to endorse it,\ninferring that x is okay. Williams suggests that “when\nsomeone stands back from the practices of the society and its use of\nthese concepts and asks whether this is the right way to go on”,\nthe sort of reflection that occurs “characteristically disturbs,\nunseats, or replaces … traditional concepts” (Williams\n1985: 146, 148). But if the person ceases to possess her traditional\nconcept T through thinly evaluative reflection, then presumably\nher previous knowledge that x is T is destroyed.\nWilliams’s thinking rests on controversial assumptions about\nethical knowledge which we cannot pursue here. Nor can we pursue\nfascinating issues concerning the implications of being deprived of\ncertain concepts (Fricker 2007: ch. 7). Let’s simply note that\nit isn’t clear that losing traditional convictions through\nreflection leads to a loss of concepts. You might instead retain your\nconcepts shorn of their traditional evaluative trappings, and either\nfind them a new evaluative point (such as using what was a positive\nconcept negatively) or shelve those concepts as ones that have no\ndistinctive point or use in structuring your experience (Richard 2008:\n33; Väyrynen 2013: 123–5, 245). In the latter case the\nevaluative point of a thick concept wouldn’t be constitutive of\nthe concept. \nAn important general issue about thick concepts is in the mix here\neither way. Consider the following widely accepted view about the\nrelation between thick and thin concepts: \nThin Centralism: Thin terms and concepts are conceptually\nand/or explanatorily prior to thick terms and concepts. (Hare 1952,\n1963, 1981; Blackburn 1992, 1998, 2013; Elstein and Hurka 2009; Smith\n2013) \nIf good and bad are\nconceptually prior to T, the members of a hypertraditional\nsociety cannot grasp T without also grasping them. But then\nthey cannot lose T when they draw a reflective inference from\nx is T to a thin evaluation. Similarly the\ntruth or falsity of x is T, and the status of\nits acceptance as knowledge, will depend partly on whether x is\ngood or bad. But these thin evaluative facts may be discernible to an\noutsider, thereby limiting the extent to which thick concepts resist\nmastery by those who cannot imaginatively inhabit the evaluative\noutlook within which it has a point. The same consequences would seem\nto follow from: \nNo Priority: Thick and thin terms and concepts are\nconceptually and explanatorily interdependent, with neither being\nprior to the other. (Hurley 1989: 13; Dancy 1995; Tappolet 2004) \nLike Thin Centralism, No Priority entails that one cannot grasp thick\nconcepts without grasping thin concepts. Thus it seems that Williams\nmust reject Thin Centralism and No Priority, and must instead accept\none of the following views about the relationship between thick and\nthin concepts: \nNon-Centralism: Thick and thin terms and concepts in general\nexhibit no interesting relations of conceptual and/or explanatory\npriority or interdependence. (Väyrynen 2013: 250) \nThick Centralism: Thick terms and concepts are conceptually\nand/or explanatorily prior to thin terms and concepts. (Explicit\nstatements are rare, but see Chappell 2013 and Annas 2016.) \nUnder Non-Centralism it might be difficult to explain why thin\nevaluative reflection should tend to lead to a loss of traditional\nthick concepts. Thick Centralism rules out Separability (see\n section 3),\n but note in addition that Williams needs a version of Thick\nCentralism on which the claim that grasping thin concepts requires\ngrasping specific thick concepts is compatible with the possibility of\nsubsequently losing those thick concepts through reflection that\ndeploys thin concepts. Regarding thick concepts in this way as a\nthrowaway ladder might not yield a stable form of Thick Centralism. An\nimportant potential implication of Thick Centralism is that since not\neveryone shares the same thick concepts, there might be no evaluative\nlanguage that is “conceptually homogeneous” across\ncultures or across disagreements within a culture (cf. Williams 1995).\nWilliams further argues that we can draw significant conclusions about\nthe nature of not just ethical knowledge but also of evaluative truths\nand their objectivity specifically from reflection on thick terms and\nconcepts, but these arguments are highly controversial (see Williams\n1985: 135–6, 146–55; Quinn 1987; Scheffler 1987; Williams\n1995; Lang 2001; Moore 2003; Kirchin 2017: ch. 172–80). \nFor a summary of some further questions about the significance of\nthick concepts, see\n section 1\n of the supplementary document\n “Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance”. \nAll these arguments regarding the distinctive significance of thick\nconcepts point us to the same cluster of issues: the combination\nquestion regarding how thick terms combine evaluation and\nnon-evaluative description, the location question regarding how the\nevaluations they may be used to convey relate to their meaning or\ncontent, and the delineation question regarding how thick terms and\nconcepts differ from the thin (and other evaluative terms).\nLet’s now turn to consider these debates in their own right. \nThe combination question concerns in what way the evaluation and\nnon-evaluative description involved in thick terms and concepts\nrelate. Calling something selfish normally conveys that it is bad, but\nnot just any bad action can qualify as selfish; selfish acts must\ninvolve the agent giving greater priority to some of her own interests\nover others’. (Those interests may be different in different\ncircumstances: one can be emotionally selfish, financially selfish,\nand so on.) Separabilists hold that thick concepts are a combination\nof distinct non-evaluative concepts and other (usually thin)\nevaluative concepts. Philosophers who accept Thin Centralism typically\naccept Separability. And philosophers (often the same ones) who reject\nShapelessness or aim to avoid the anti-disentangling argument also\ntypically accept Separability. But as we’ll see, Separability\ncommits you to neither Thin Centralism nor Shapelessness. While some\nphilosophers writer as if Separabilist views were essentially\nnon-cognitivist (Dancy 1995; Kirchin 2010), cognitivists can well\naccept Separability (Elstein and Hurka 2009; Smith 2013). Separabilist\nviews are sometimes called “reductive” (Kirchin 2010;\nRoberts 2013a; Harcourt and Thomas 2013). A word of caution about this\nlabel is that Separabilist views needn’t be reductionist in the\nsense of reducing evaluative properties to non-evaluative ones. By\ncontrast, Inseparabilists hold that the meanings of thick terms and\nconcepts are both evaluative and descriptive but cannot be divided\ninto distinct contents; talk of “combining” evaluation and\nnon-evaluative description is liable to mislead if it suggests putting\ntogether distinct elements (Dancy 1995: 268). Thick concepts are a\ndistinct kind of fundamental evaluative concepts. Accordingly\nInseparabilist Views are often called “non-reductive”, or\nviews on which thick concepts are “irreducibly thick”.\nPhilosophers who accept Thick Centralism typically accept\nInseparability, and those who accept Inseparability typically accept\nShapelessness and express sympathy for the anti-disentangling\nargument. (As we’ll see, these views needn’t cluster as\nneatly as is sometimes assumed.) \nAccording to Separability, the evaluative and non-evaluative aspects\nof thick terms and concepts are distinct components that can at least\nin principle be disentangled from one another. In this section\nwe’ll discuss how Separabilists may specify the non-evaluative\ndescriptive content and its relation to the evaluative content. By way\nof preliminaries, note that many Separabilists take the evaluative\ncontent of thick terms to be located in their truth-conditions, but if\nthose evaluations are some other kind of features of thick terms or\ntheir uses, they will be separable from the non-evaluative descriptive\ncontents of thick terms in whatever way such features are in general\nseparable from truth-conditional meaning (see\n section 4).\n While Separabilists often take this evaluative content to be thin,\nSeparability as such doesn’t require this. The evaluative\ncontent of “What you did was tactless” might not be\n“What you did was pro tanto bad” but more like\n“What did you did was bad in a certain way”, where the\nspecification of the “certain way” will introduce\ndescriptive information, such as “pertaining to manners”.\nAlternatively the evaluative contents of thick terms might be given by\naffective concepts such as admirable or amusing\n(Tappolet 2004; for criticism, see Harcourt\nand Thomas 2013). On neither view does Separability entail Thin\nCentralism, although if admirable means simply worthy of\nadmiration, Thin Centralism can be maintained. Note that when we\nsee below some Separabilists proposing an “analysis” of\nthick terms, they needn’t be understood as claiming that any\nactual language allows us to give a satisfactory statement of a\nputative analysis of a thick term or concept. Our inability to provide\nsuch a statement doesn’t show that the term or concept is\nunanalyzable or that Inseparability is true. \nIn what kind of relation does the evaluative content E of a\nthick term stand to its non-evaluative descriptive content D if\nthey are separable? In\n section 2.1\n we saw a simple view about the connection: D entails E.\nBut this threatens an is-ought gap which many want to\nmaintain, commits you to Descriptive Equivalence, and makes you\nvulnerable to the anti-disentangling argument. (From any such\nD we can construct an independently intelligible purely\nnon-evaluative description with the same extension as the thick term\nin question.) We also think that in some way selfish actions are bad\nin a certain way because or in virtue of the agent\ngiving a certain degree of priority to herself over others; the\nconnection doesn’t seem merely conjunctive. Separabilists might\nthen seek to analyze thick terms or concepts as featuring a relation\nwhich is explanatory but where D doesn’t entail\nE. In this vein, Stephan Burton suggests that thick terms can\nbe analyzed as meaning “x is E in virtue of some\nparticular instance of D” (Burton 1992; see also Tappolet\n2004). Selfish, for instance, would mean something like\n“bad in a certain way in virtue of some particular instance of\ngiving priority to oneself over others”. For E to hold in\nvirtue of some particular instance of D is for E to\ndepend on “the various different characteristics and\ncontexts” of D. You might not count as selfish if you\nbenefit yourself over benefiting two other people to the same degree\neach as you benefit yourself but things may be different if seven\nother people are in the mix, and what counts as the relevant kind of\nprioritizing of oneself varies depending on whether the context\nconcerns emotional or financial selfishness, and so on. So D\nalone isn’t sufficient for E, and the further\nnon-evaluative detail about particular instances of D which is\nneeded for E isn’t built into the meaning of\nselfish (Burton 1992: 31). This avoids the anti-disentangling\nargument. For although E is still (contextually) separable from\nD, D won’t be coextensive with selfish\nand an outsider’s grasp of the extension of D won’t\nbe enough for her to master how insiders apply selfish.\nSeparabilists might also have other ways of securing these benefits.\nBrent Kyle argues that Separabilists have no reason to accept an\nanalysis which inserts an explanatory relation into the content of\nthick concepts, and offers an alternative (discussed below) which also\navoids the anti-disentangling argument (Kyle 2020: 916–17, 923).\n \nSince Separabilists can deny Descriptive Equivalence, the\nanti-disentangling argument cannot establish Inseparability. But what\nis meant to constrain the selection of the non-evaluative\n“characteristics and contexts” which are needed to\ndetermine whether a thick term applies? And can these be grasped\nwithout drawing on our antecedent understanding of the thick term? If\nnot, those drawn to Thin Centralism won’t be satisfied, and\nBurton’s proposal will also fall short as a non-circular\nanalysis of meaning. Here we’ll consider two other Separabilist\nproposals for solving these problems about how thick terms combine\nevaluative and non-evaluative information. \nDaniel Elstein and Thomas Hurka offer two patterns of analysis for\nthick terms as “sketches intended to illustrate the general\nresources the reductive view has” in solving these problems\n(Elstein and Hurka 2009: 531). Each allows Separabilists to accept\nThin Centralism while explaining why an outsider to the relevant\nevaluative practice couldn’t grasp the extension of a given\nthick term. Each of Elstein and Hurka’s patterns of analysis\nlocates evaluation in the meanings of thick terms. On the first, the\nnon-evaluative content of a thick term is only partially specified\nwithin its meaning: its meaning specifies good-making (or bad-making)\nnon-evaluative properties of a general type, but may not specify what\nexactly these good-making properties are. An example they give is that\n“x is distributively just” means \nx is good, and there are properties X, Y, and\nZ (not specified) that distributions have as distributions, or\nin virtue of their distributive shape, such that x has\nX, Y, and Z, and X, Y, and Z\nmake any distribution that has them good. (Elstein and Hurka 2009:\n522) \nThis analysis separates non-evaluative description from evaluation,\nand grasping it requires grasping good. But\ngrasping the non-evaluative information that distributively\njust only applies to distributions won’t be enough to know\njust which distributions fall into its extension. That requires\nknowing which properties of distributions are good making. Similarly,\nmastering how insiders apply distributively just requires\nknowing which properties they take to make distributions good. In this\nway, Separabilists can agree that “evaluation drives\nextension” (a phrase from Blackburn 1992; see also Gibbard\n1992). Thus they can accept the second premise of the\nanti-disentangling argument while rejecting its first premise (which\npresupposes Descriptive Equivalence). \nOn Elstein and Hurka’s first pattern of analysis, a thick term\ninvolves only a “global” evaluation that “governs\nthe whole concept”: anything to which distributively\njust applies is good, and we can identify the general\nnon-evaluative type to which it belongs independently of any\nevaluation. Their second pattern of analysis, which is meant to fit\nmany virtue and vice concepts, supplements the global thin evaluation\nwith a further thin evaluation that is embedded within non-evaluative\ndescription. An example they give is that “act x is\ncourageous” means something like \nx is good, and x involves an agent’s accepting\nharm or the risk of harm for himself for the sake of goods greater\nthan the evil of that harm, where this property makes any act that has\nit good. (Elstein and Hurka 2009: 527) \nThe reference to “goods” is an “embedded”\nevaluation: you can’t even specify the general type of those\nactions which courageous evaluates globally as good without\nknowing what count as good goals. But determining this will again\nrequire evaluations which an outsider cannot access simply by knowing\nthe non-evaluative content of courageous (Elstein and Hurka\n2009: 526–7). Note how global and embedded evaluations differ:\nyou can grasp the embedded evaluation of what count as good goals\nwithout any view on what counts as courageous (or even without having\nthe concept), but not so with the global evaluation. (To have a view\nof what property of the relevant type makes anything that has it good\nis to have a view on what counts as courageous, on their\nanalysis.) Below “evaluation” means global evaluation\nunless noted otherwise. \nBrent Kyle proposes a different way for Separabilists to avoid the\nanti-disentangling argument. According to his positive account of the\nmeaning of thick concepts, the Expansion View, thick concepts are\nexpanded contents of thin terms. An expanded content is, roughly, the\nsemantic content of a predicate with modifiers: that Chuck is ready to\nparty and that Chuck is ready for work are among the expanded contents\nthat “Chuck is ready” can express in different contexts of\nutterance, and likewise for “Shaq is agile” and the\nproposition that Shaq is agile for a basketball player. Kyle proposes\nthat, similarly, admirable is an expanded\ncontent of worthy, namely worthy-[of-admiration],\nthat courageous\ncan be analyzed as some such expanded\ncontent of true as true-[to-a-good-cause-despite-risk],\nand that kind\ncan be analyzed as some such expanded content\nof good as good-[to-someone-as-an-end]\n(Kyle 2020:\n918–22). The Expansion View contends that all thick concepts\nhave correct analyses of the sort which these rough approximations\naim to illustrate. One question about it is how to distinguish, say,\ncourageous from at least certain utterances of\nreckless in a non-circular way. Many reckless acts satisfy at\nleast the toy analysis of courageous as true-[to-a-good-cause-despite-risk].\nThe Expansion View is\na form of Separability because it requires that thick concepts are\ncomposed in part of thin ones (for details, see Kyle 2020:\n924–25). But it doesn’t imply that any thick concept can\nbe disentangled into a thin evaluative content plus a non-evaluative\ndescription that is co-extensive with the thick concept.  \nSeparability promises to make it clear how thick terms are both\nevaluative and descriptive. Unless we accept also Descriptive\nEquivalence, the evaluative contents of thick terms will be provided\nby independently intelligible evaluative concepts (thin concepts, or\naffective concepts, or good-in-a-way concepts), and their\nnon-evaluative meanings will be inherited from distinct non-evaluative\ninformation. Conjoining Separability with Thin Centralism would also\npromise theoretical economy: we could explicate a wide range of\nevaluative concepts on the basis of just a few basic thin concepts and\nnon-evaluative concepts which we need to recognize anyway. (This\nputative advantage assumes Inherently Evaluative. It isn’t\nguaranteed by Separability as such; Kyle’s Expansion View yields\na form of Separability which accepts Inherently Evaluative but\ndoesn’t require Thin Centralism.) The converse won’t\nfollow from Inseparabilism even if Thick Centralism is true, since\nthick terms are much more numerous than thin terms. Below we’ll\ndiscuss whether Inseparabilists can provide as clear an\nexplanation. \nSeparability has also been claimed vital for normative criticism of\nthick concepts. Simon Blackburn claims that those who apply\ncute to adult women \nreact to an infantile, unthreatening appearance or self-presentation\nin women … with admiration or desire (the men) or envy and\nemulation (the women) \nand that we couldn’t criticize this attitude as objectionable if\nthe non-evaluative aspects of cute were inseparable from the\nadmirability or enviability which those non-evaluative aspects are\ntaken to ground (Blackburn 1998: 101). In response one might point out\nthat Inseparability allows that thick terms and concepts entail\nnon-evaluative descriptions of the sort of general type that figures\nin Elstein and Hurka’s analyses (“has to do with\ninfantile, unthreatening appearance”), so long as these\nentailments don’t exhaust their descriptive aspects. This in\nturn opens up room for the specifically normative criticism that no\nspecific features of this general type make admiration or envy\nappropriate when possessed by adult women. But Inseparabilists must be\nable to square this idea with their account of how thick terms are\nevaluative. So let’s now turn to Inseparability. \nAccording to Inseparabilists, thick terms and concepts are irreducibly\nthick: their meanings involve both evaluation and non-evaluative\ndescription without this being a matter of combining constituent\nevaluative and non-evaluative contents. For instance, cruel\nexpresses a sui generis evaluative concept which isn’t\na combination of pro tanto bad or bad in way\nW with some non-evaluative content. How then is the idea\nthat thick terms are both descriptive and evaluative to be understood,\nif not in terms of combining evaluative and descriptive components? It\ncannot be that their meanings are both wholly evaluative and wholly\nnon-evaluative (which is how we are understanding the descriptive);\nthat would be contradictory. \nThe challenge to Inseparabilists is to pin down more precisely how\nthick terms are both evaluative and descriptive in ways that are\ncontinuous with, respectively, thin evaluative concepts and\nnon-evaluative concepts. Simply stipulating new technical notions\nwould leave their claims about the distinctive philosophical\nsignificance of thick concepts unsatisfactory. Not just any conceptual\nentailment of a term seems constitutive of its meaning; while\n“x is a horse” entails that x is a mammal,\nit also entails that x isn’t a wombat (or a mountain, or\na beer bottle), but not being a wombat (etc.) isn’t part of the\nmeaning of horse (Dancy 2013: 49). But some entailments are\nsuch that competence with the term requires grasping them, and thick\nconcepts and descriptive concepts are similar in having non-evaluative\nentailments of this sort. It is a matter of meaning that lewd acts\ninvolve overt sexual display, selfish acts involve the agent giving\npriority to herself over others, and so on. There is also a\nmethodological rationale for focusing on entailments: linguists study\nword meanings by considering patterns in competent speakers’\nentailment and contradiction judgments, synonymy judgments, and\njudgments about truth-conditions because these reflect relations among\nthe sorts of entities that semantic theories assign to linguistic\nexpressions as their meanings (Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 2000: ch.\n1). (A complication is that the meanings of words may not map\none-to-one onto the concepts those words may be used to express.\nWriters on thick concepts often don’t say what they take\nconcepts and their relation to word meanings to be.) \nWhat should Inseparabilists say about the common way in which thick\nand thin concepts are evaluative? Several views have been proposed,\nbut a simple proposal will hopefully suffice to give a feel for the\nissue. Thick and thin concepts might be thought similar in that both\nhave intrinsic practical relevance (Dancy 2013: 56–7). Whereas\nthe relevance of a non-evaluative concept such as water\nto your actions needs to be explained by\nciting other considerations, such as your desire to quench thirst or\nthe fact that you are stranded in the desert, no further explanation\nis needed for the practical relevance of thin concepts like ought\nor thick concepts such as courage.\nIt is “to be expected” that\ncourageousness makes a practical difference: it is normally, even if\nnot always, something to aspire to and admire. Whereas competence with\nnon-evaluative concepts requires only the ability to determine whether\nthe concept applies, competence with an evaluative concept requires\nalso grasping its general evaluative point—the sorts of\npractical difference its instantiation can make in a particular case.\nFor thick concepts, the sort of difference may vary from case to case:\nrudeness is usually inappropriate, but sometimes neutral and sometimes\npositively called for. One problem with this view is that its\nmetaethical commitments are too controversial for a general\ndistinction between evaluative and non-evaluative concepts. For\nexample, under the “internalist” view of normative\nreasons, according to which there is a reason for an agent to perform\na particular action only if the action is suitably related to the\nagent’s motivations, courageous and\nmorally good have no more intrinsic practical\nrelevance than water and wombat\n(Williams 1981). Whether their application\nmakes a difference to your reasons will depend on your motivations. It\nis also controversial that “objectionable” thick concepts\nhave intrinsic practical relevance. Why then should other thick\nconcepts? \nFor a summary of other Inseparabilist views on how thick and thin\nconcepts are evaluative, see\n section 2\n of the supplementary document\n “Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance”. \nDebates about Separability and Inseparability frequently lead to two\nfurther issues. The first is that Inseparability requires that thick\nterms and concepts are inherently evaluative in meaning and that most\nSeparabilists also take evaluation and non-evaluative description to\nbe combined within the meanings of thick terms and concepts, not\nmerely their use. The second issue is that if thick terms and concepts\nare inherently evaluative, it isn’t enough to specify the shared\nsense in which both thick and thin concepts are evaluative. To\npreserve a distinction, we must also ask specify how they differ. (And\nif thick terms and concepts aren’t inherently evaluative, we\nmust instead say how they differ from other non-evaluative descriptive\nconcepts.) The next two sections address these issues in turn. \nBoth the debate about Separability and Inseparability and the putative\nbroader significance of the thick depend on assumptions about how\nthick terms are evaluative. While everyone agrees that thick terms are\nsomehow linguistically associated with evaluations, the crucial\nassumption of many of these arguments is that utterances involving\nthick terms (T-utterances, for short) are evaluative specifically as a\nmatter of the conditions that must hold for such utterances to express\ntrue propositions. If the extension of a thick term has a descriptive\nequivalent, then evaluation makes no difference to the\ntruth-conditions of the utterances involving that term. A natural\nexplanation of why an outsider who grasps the non-evaluative content\nof a thick term couldn’t master the extension of a thick term\nwould be be that its truth-conditions include some evaluative\ncondition which the outsider doesn’t grasp. And thick terms can\nchallenge a logical is-ought gap only if T-utterances have an\nevaluative truth-condition, since logical relations are relations\nbetween truth-conditions. Accordingly Inseparabilists and many\nSeparabilists take evaluation to contribute to semantic\ncontent—the kind of meaning that determines the reference or\ntruth-conditions of sentences involving thick terms. \nThe view that the evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances are\nconveyed by the same mechanism as semantic or truth-conditional\ncontent in general is, however, controversial. Utterances can\ncommunicate information that doesn’t contribute to their\ntruth-conditions, and in\n section 4.2\n we’ll see several ways they can do so, either in virtue of\nother linguistic conventions or conversational principles and\nmechanisms. If we use the label “semantic” narrowly to\nrefer only to truth-conditional properties of utterances, and use the\nlabel “pragmatic” broadly to cover the other ways for\nutterances to convey information, then the view that thick terms are\nglobally evaluative as a matter of the truth-conditions of\nT-utterances may be called the “Semantic View” and the\nviews according which thick terms convey global evaluation through\nsome other mechanism of information transfer may be called\n“Pragmatic Views”. (To avoid confusion, also bear in mind\nthat “pragmatic” is often used more narrowly to refer only\nto features of utterances that are explained by conversational\nprinciples rather than linguistic conventions.) \nThe most widely accepted view of the relation between thick terms and\nevaluation is: \nSemantic View: The semantic (truth-conditional) meanings of\nthick terms and concepts contain global evaluations. \nWe can assess the relative plausibility of Semantic and Pragmatic\nViews by seeing how well they explain various patterns of the kinds of\nlinguistic behavior on which linguists rely in assessing claims about\nwhether some feature of an utterance is part of its truth-conditions\nor not. The data we’ll briefly consider below focus on what we\ncalled global evaluations in\n section 3.1;\n Pragmatic Views can allow the meanings of thick terms to contain\nembedded evaluation (Väyrynen 2013: 42–3). The data\ndon’t by themselves entail either the Semantic View or any\nversion of the Pragmatic View. These views should rather be understood\nas claiming to constitute part of the best explanation of a wide body\nof linguistic data involving thick terms. \nSome of the relevant linguistic data seem easy to explain if thick\nterms are semantically evaluative. Consider the assertions in\n(1)–(2): \nIn both\n (1)\n and the exchange in\n (2),\n the denial of an evaluation that is normally conveyed by\ncruel and courageous sounds odd, or infelicitous\n(indicated by “#”). If the first half of\n (1)\n has a global evaluation of something as bad in a certain way as part\nof its truth-conditions, the oddness of\n (1)\n can be neatly explained as reflecting a logical contradiction between\nits two halves. The same would go for the exchange in\n (2):\n A’s and B’s utterances entail contradictory\nclaims about whether Sue’s act was good in any way. (See Kyle\n2013a for a discussion of how the Semantic View might allow that\n (1)\n isn’t odd in all contexts.) \nIt is natural to assume that if a thick term conveys an evaluation as\na matter of truth-conditions, that evaluation is either positive or\nnegative but not both and the evaluation is the same in all contexts\nwhere the term is used to make an assertion. (We’ll discuss\nnon-assertive contexts below.) But many paradigmatic thick terms can\nbe used to evaluate negatively in some contexts while positively in\nothers. Some philosophers claim that the Semantic View cannot explain\nthis “contextual variability” in the evaluative valence of\nT-utterances. Although frugal normally conveys a positive\nevaluation, calling someone whose “main job is dispensing\nhospitality” frugal counts as a criticism (Blackburn 1992: 286).\nSimilarly, although cruel normally conveys a negative\nevaluation, it might be thought to convey positive evaluation when the\ncruelty of an action is “just what made it such fun” (Hare\n1981: 73). Such variability might be thought to show that thick virtue\nconcepts aren’t evaluative concepts (Brower 1988). However,\nvariability in valence is compatible with the Semantic View\n(Väyrynen 2011). These examples might be thought to involve a\nnon-literal use of the thick term or to convey the non-typical\nevaluation not by way of word meaning but by way of speaker meaning.\n(What the speaker means in using some word can come apart from the\nmeaning that the word has in the language. I can intend to be speaking\nabout plums of any kind when I use the word prune but that\ndoesn’t make it any less the case that in English prune\nmeans dried plums.) Or it might be that the normal evaluation is built\ninto the truth-conditions of the sentences involving it and the\nopposite evaluation can be explained in terms of one of the pragmatic\nmechanisms we’ll consider in\n section 4.2.\n Or it might be that although thick terms are semantically evaluative,\ntheir valence isn’t fixed but rather their meanings allow\ninvolve different evaluations in different contexts (Dancy 1995).\nThese also don’t exhaust the options for a semantic explanation\nof variability (Kyle 2020: 926). More generally, it doesn’t seem\npromising to explain valence reversal by appeal to lexical\ndeflationism, ambiguity, or echoic use of language (Cepollaro 2018).\n \nA stronger challenge to the Semantic View is based on two more complex\nsets of linguistic data about thick terms: the evaluations normally\nconveyed by T-utterances seem to survive embedding in various complex\nsentences that usually block truth-conditional content, and those\nevaluations seem to be defeasible in ways that truth-conditional\ncontent isn’t. \nThe first set of data concern what happens when atomic sentences\ninvolving thick terms are embedded in various complex sentences;\ntruth-conditional content often doesn’t survive such embedding.\nThe data are clearest in the case of objectionable thick concepts\nwhich were introduced in\n section 2.1.\n (The most comprehensive presentation of the data can be found in\nVäyrynen 2013: ch. 3.) The word chaste applies to a\ncertain kind of sexual restraint. It is typically used to convey\npositive evaluation to the effect that such restraint is praiseworthy\nor good in a certain way. If chaste is in fact objectionable\nand the evaluation that makes it so is part of its truth-conditions,\nthen nothing is chaste; chaste fails to refer. If instead the\nassociated evaluation that makes chaste objectionable is\ntruth-conditionally irrelevant, chaste may be true of things\nwhich just don’t “fit” the evaluation; it will\n“misevaluate” (Eklund 2011). \nThose who reject the evaluation of sexual restraint as good and thus\nfind chaste objectionable in its customary positive use (call\nthem chaste-objectors) are at least typically reluctant to\nutter sentences like (3): \nInterestingly, chaste-objectors are also reluctant to use\nchaste when it is embedded in negation, questions, modal\noperators such as possibly and might, and the\nantecedent of the conditional. \nNone of\n (4a–d)\n entail that Isolde is chaste. So chaste-objectors’\nreluctance to utter\n (4a–d)\n seems hard to explain if the positive evaluation associated with\nchaste is part of the truth-conditions of\n (3).\n Since the evaluation survives when chaste is embedded under\noperators that block truth-conditional content, it appears to\n“project” outside of the truth-conditions of\nchaste. This kind of projection behavior is a general feature\nof T-utterances, since virtually any thick term seems to be in\nprinciple open to being regarded as objectionable. As we’ll see\nin\n section 4.2\n below, this projection behavior is characteristic of certain\ntruth-conditionally irrelevant pragmatic contents and is thus well\nexplained by many Pragmatic Views. \nThe Semantic View may, however, offer a different explanation of these\nprojection data. One option is that T-utterances normally convey two\nkinds of evaluations. Perhaps chaste is semantically\nevaluative and, in addition, someone who uses the word thereby conveys\nthat she approves of the semantically associated way of valuing\n(namely, valuing people or behavior positively for showing sexual\nrestraint). Insofar as this latter aspect projects from embeddings\nthat block truth-conditional content and the reluctance of\nchaste-objectors to utter\n (4a–d)\n can be explained as being due only to the latter aspect, their\nreluctance doesn’t show that chaste isn’t also\nsemantically evaluative. (Eklund forthcoming.) This proposal seems,\nhowever, unable by itself to explain the defeasibility data discussed\nbelow, which suggest that even the associated evaluations themselves\ncan be suspended without infelicity. \nAnother explanation of the projection data is due to Brent Kyle. It\ncomes in two pieces. The first concerns (4a). When you say someone is\nnot happy, you only say that they lack the quality of being happy, not\nthat they are unhappy. But normally, in the absence of an explicit\nnote to the contrary, we tend to interpret the claim that someone\nisn’t happy as conversationally implicating (conveying,\nsuggesting) that they are unhappy. It should then be equally plausible\nthat not chaste similarly conversationally implicates\nunchaste. Since those who find chaste objectionable\nshould also be reluctant to imply that anyone is unchaste, this would\nexplain why chaste-objectors are reluctant to utter (4a). So\nwhat about (4b–d)? To be a chaste-objector you must\nhave concluded that things aren’t good simply for showing a\ncertain kind of sexual restraint. If the Semantic View is true, it\nfollows that nothing can be chaste. But each of (4b–d) implies\nthat the speaker considers it a live possibility that Isolde is\nchaste. No wonder, then, that chaste-objectors are reluctant\nto assert (4b–d). Since these explanations focus on\ntruth-conditionally irrelevant implications of\n (4a–d),\n they are compatible with the Semantic View (Kyle 2013a: 13–19).\nIn appealing to two distinct types of implicature, this piecemeal\nexplanation is less parsimonious than Pragmatic Views which make do\nwith just one mechanism, but whether that makes the explanation worse\noverall is a complex question up for debate. (For this methodological\nissue, see\n section 3\n of the supplementary document\n “Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance”.) \nThe second set of data concern the possibility of denying or\nsuspending an evaluation that a T-utterance normally conveys without\nrejecting the utterance itself. Truth-conditional contents cannot be\ndenied in this way. If I say “Gerald asked three questions at\nHeather’s talk” and you reply “No, he asked\ntwo”, you reject my utterance as false. But if you reply “\nNo, he asked four”, you aren’t rejecting the truth of my\nutterance but only its conversational implicature that Gerald asked\nexactly three questions. In\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n direct denials of evaluation following assertive T-utterances are\nodd. But consider: \nIf these utterances can be acceptable, that would be evidence that the\nevaluation normally conveyed by chaste isn’t part of\nits truth-conditions. A speaker of\n (7)\n makes it clear that she would rejoice in a more sexually explicit\ncarnival, thus shedding a commitment to evaluating the carnival\nnegatively if it were more explicit. If that evaluation were part of\nthe truth-conditions of lewd, we would expect\n (7)\n not to sound coherent on a literal use of lewd. The denial\nin\n (5)\n and suspension in\n (6)\n don’t concern only whether the speaker approves of the way of\nvaluing associated with the thick term but also that evaluation\nitself. An utterance of\n (5)\n brackets the question whether the truth-conditions of\n (3)\n hold and denies the evaluation either way. If you forced a\nchaste-objector to judge\n (3)\n as either true or false, she might prefer to classify it as true\nwhile using something like\n (5)\n to signal that she is using chaste non-evaluatively.\nUttering\n (6)\n would be a way for someone who is agnostic about whether chastity is\ngood in any way to suspend the evaluation while conceding that the\ntruth-conditions of\n (3)\n hold. It isn’t clear how either\n (5)\n or\n (6)\n could be compatible with locating the evaluation in the\ntruth-conditions of\n (3).\n So the proponents of the Semantic View may need to claim that\nutterances of\n (5)–(7)\n either don’t involve literal uses of thick terms or are\ninfelicitous despite the fact that many speakers don’t find them\nto be linguistically odd as utterances. \nOne radical way to reconcile the Semantic View with the defeasibility\ndata is to argue that a condition can be part of what constitutes the\nmeaning of an expression even if the expression doesn’t satisfy\nthe condition and even if the condition can be competently rejected by\nusers of the expression. On this view, chaste might entail\ngood for showing sexual restraint as a matter of meaning even\nif things to which chaste applies in fact aren’t good\nin any way and even if some semantically competent speakers reject the\nevaluation without rejecting\n (1).\n In developing this view, Matti Eklund argues that it isn’t\nad hoc because there are other concepts that can plausibly be\ntreated as inconsistent in this kind of way (Eklund 2011). \nThe debate about whether the evaluations normally conveyed by thick\nterms are defeasible quickly gets complex and technical. (A fuller\ndiscussion of the defeasibility data and their explanation can be\nfound in Väyrynen 2013: 66–95.) Sometimes the linguistic\nintuitions on which we rely in assessing competing explanations may\nalso be less firm or not as widely shared as we would like. An\nadditional complication is that some evidence about how people in fact\nreason with positive and negative thick terms suggests that\nevaluations are more easily defeasible for positive thick terms than\nfor negative ones (Willemsen and Reuter 2020). Existing work largely\nassumes that positive and negative thick terms behave in largely the\nsame ways. Asymmetrical valence effects would thus complicate matters\nfor both Semantic and Pragmatic Views. How much they would do so\ndepends on how deep a difference in meaning the asymmetry would reflect.\nPascale Willemsen and Kevin Reuter (2020) propose that the valence\neffect is due to a difference in the social norms guiding positive and\nnegative evaluative language, but the issue is under-explored. Another\nfurther issue concerns whether certain kinds of denials of\nT-utterances focused on the evaluations that they normally convey are\nbetter understood as instances of the truth-conditional negation that\nwe learn about in logic classes, or of “metalinguistic”\nnegation which targets aspects of utterances other than their\ntruth-conditional content. \nUnderstanding how else thick terms might be related to evaluation than\nby way of truth-conditions requires a brief look at how utterances can\nin general communicate information that isn’t part of their\ntruth-conditions. Linguists and philosophers of language have\nidentified several other mechanisms of information transfer by which a\nspeaker can communicate information, such as a proposition, that\nisn’t part of the truth-conditions of her utterance. If this\nfurther information is false, that isn’t usually thought to make\nthe utterance itself false, but merely odd in some way. Some of these\nmechanisms operate on other features besides truth-conditions which\nterms may have in virtue of linguistic conventions, others operate\nthrough distinct conversational mechanisms. (For a fuller discussion\nof these mechanisms in the context of thick terms, see Väyrynen\n2013: ch. 5.) \nOne way for utterances to communicate further information is\npresupposition: \nHow exactly presuppositions of utterances are related to their\ntruth-conditions is a complex topic. Perhaps A’s\nutterance can be true even if the presupposition is false: you\ncan’t regret something you never did. Either way, linguists\nlargely think that the presupposition isn’t part of the\ntruth-conditions of A’s utterance, but only part of the\n“common ground” of the conversation. Among writers on\nthick concepts, Allan Gibbard and Gopal Sreenivasan speak of the\nevaluations conveyed by T-utterances as presuppositions, but without\ndeveloping the view in detail (Gibbard 1992; Sreenivasan 2001: 26).\nMore detailed and sophisticated developments can be found in Cepollaro\nand Stojanovic (2016) and Cepollaro (2020). An open question about\nthis view is whether the relevant presuppositions are better\nunderstood pragmatically, as conveying the speaker’s beliefs\nabout the conversation’s common ground, or semantically, as\nsomething that expressions carry as part of their meaning. A worry\nabout presuppositional views is that the evaluations normally conveyed\nby objectionable thick concepts have no prospect of being added to the\ncommon ground of the conversation when some addressees find them\nobjectionable, whereas presuppositions not already in the common\nground are expected to be added to it unless challenged. Resources for\naddressing both of these issues might, however, be available in the\ncomplex and subtle contemporary work on presupposition in linguistics\n(cf. Cepollaro 2020: ch. 4).  \nUtterances can communicate further information by way of conventional\nimplicature (Grice 1975: 25). \nThere is significant consensus that “Shaq is tall but\nagile” and “Shaq is tall and agile” are true in all\nthe same circumstances. But the latter doesn’t communicate a\ncontrast between tallness and agility. The implicated contrast\nproposition isn’t part of the truth-conditions of\nB’s utterance. The implicature is widely regarded as\nconventional because the contrast seems to be part of the standing\nmeaning of but in English; a speaker who finds no difference\nbetween what and and but communicate is in some\nsense not fully competent with but. An implicature of an\nutterance that needn’t be carried by an utterance of a\ntruth-conditionally equivalent sentence is said to be\n“detachable” from the utterance (Grice 1975: 39). In\n section 2.1\n we saw that according to R.M. Hare the evaluative content of thick\nterms is detachable in this sense. But he doesn’t say whether he\nthinks that the evaluative contents of thick terms are conventional\nimplicatures. If the evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances\nwere conventional implicatures (or semantic presuppositions, for that\nmatter), then thick terms would be inherently evaluative in meaning,\nbut not as a matter of truth-conditions. One problem for this view is\nthat conventional implicatures aren’t defeasible in the ways\nthat the evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances seem to be:\n“Whether or not Shaq’s agility is unexpected given his\ntallness, Shaq is tall but agile” sounds very odd. \nA third way for utterances to communicate further information is\nconversational implicature. Imagine the following conversation at the\ncampus cafeteria: \nThe implicature doesn’t look like part of the truth-conditions\nof B’s utterance. All that B says is that she has\nto work. That doesn’t become false if B attends the party\nafter all. The implicature is conversational because A has to\nwork it out from B’s utterance by relying on contextual\nobservations and rules of cooperative communication, such as that\nB wouldn’t utter a sentence that isn’t directly\nrelevant to A’s question unless she was trying to convey\nsomething that is relevant, namely that she won’t be coming to\nthe party. (Grice 1975: 26–31.) Among writers on thick concepts,\nSimon Blackburn occasionally suggests that the evaluations normally\nconveyed by thick terms are conversational implicatures (Blackburn\n1992; his 1998 is harder to read this way; see also Zangwill 1995:\n322). But this view doesn’t explain the projection data above:\nconversational implicatures mostly don’t survive embedding under\nnegation, questions, and so on, except by coincidence. (If B\nhad said “I don’t have to work”, she wouldn’t\nhave implicated that she can’t come to the party.) The\nevaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances are also not as directly\ndeniable as conversational implicatures: “I have to work, but I\ndon’t mean to imply that I won’t be coming to the\nparty” sounds perfectly fine, unlike the similarly direct\ndenials in\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n above. Unlike most views on how thick terms convey evaluation, the\nconversational implicature view has also been tested empirically. In a\nstudy designed to test whether the evaluative aspects of thick\nconcepts are separable from their non-evaluative aspects, Willemsen\nand Reuter (2020) found evidence that the two aren’t separable\nin the way that conversational implicatures are separable from the\ncontents whose utterances generate those implicatures. Further\nempirical studies to test other semantic and pragmatic hypotheses\nabout the relationship between thick terms and evaluation would be a\nwelcome development in the debate.  \nSo the conversational implicature view about the relationship between\nthick terms and evaluation cannot explain either set of the linguistic\ndata in\n section 4.1.\n The other two do better. Both presuppositions and conventional\nimplicatures project in ways suggested by\n (4a–d).\n These views also predict that\n (1)\n should sound odd: “I regret being a member of the communist\nparty and I never was a member” sounds close to contradictory,\nand so does “Shaq is tall but agile and his being agile\nisn’t unexpected given his tallness”. Pragmatic\npresuppositions in particular also promise to be defeasible in the\nways the evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances may be taken to\nbe on the back of examples like\n (5)–(7).\n But there might be suitably weak notions of semantic presupposition\nthat also can claim this advantage.  \nThe pragmatic view developed by Pekka Väyrynen identifies a type\nof pragmatic content that projects and is defeasible but needn’t\nreadily become mutually taken for granted by conversational\nparticipants to explain the evaluations normally conveyed by\nT-utterances. He proposes: \nNot-At-Issue View: Global evaluations are implications of\nT-utterances which are normally “not at issue” in their\nliteral uses in normal contexts, and which arise conversationally.\n(Väyrynen 2013: 122) \nWhen someone calls Rihanna’s show lewd, or Donald Trump’s\nstump speech unhinged, a negative evaluation is a generalized\nimplication of the utterance in the sense that it is part of the\nstandard or default interpretation of such utterances, not a one-off\noccurrence. Its generalized status is explained by social facts such\nas that it isn’t common in these parts to use chaste,\ncruel, generous, and so on, neutrally. It is common\nknowledge that those who use a given thick term for the most part\naccept certain evaluations and their utterances for the most part\naccurately reflect their acceptance of those evaluations. (Such social\nfacts may also help explain why thick terms seem more intimately\nconnected to evaluation than other non-evaluative terms that are often\nused evaluatively, such as chocolatey and athletic.)\nBut the implication is “not at issue” in the sense that\nthe evaluation is not the main point of her utterance but rather is\npart of the background that the speaker takes for granted (but\nneedn’t assume his audience to accept) in making the utterance.\nThe main point is to assert that the thing in question falls under the\nterm, against the background evaluation that things falling under the\nterm tend to be bad in a certain sort of way. Insofar as the presence\nof the evaluation can be explained conversationally, we can expect it\nto be open to be denied or suspended by objectors in the ways\nsuggested by the defeasibility data above. And a general feature of\nvarious kind of backgrounded contents is that they project in ways\nillustrated by\n (4a–d).\n (For more on this version of the Pragmatic View, see Väyrynen\n2013: chs. 5–6.) \nIf this kind of Pragmatic View is correct, thick concepts seem to lack\nthe broader significance that some have assigned to them. The\nevaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances will be separable from\nthick terms in whatever way pragmatic not-at-issue implications are in\ngeneral separable from the utterances that generate them. And if the\nconclusion that thick terms aren’t semantically evaluative shows\nthat there are no irreducibly evaluative thick concepts that we must\npossess in order to think about their subject matter, thick concepts\ncannot undermine the is-ought distinction, force us to\nrethink reflection and objectivity in ethics, or be conceptually or\nexplanatorily prior to or interdependent with thin concepts\n(Väyrynen 2013: ch. 10). However, the relationship between\nlanguage and concepts is vexed in this area, and may interfere with\nthe implications of Pragmatic Views for the significance of thick\nconcepts. (For discussion, see Väyrynen 2013: 44–51;\nZangwill 2013; Eklund forthcoming.) The overall plausibility of the\nPragmatic View depends on several further issues. One concerns its\nimplications regarding thin terms. For instance, if thin terms are\nalso open to being regarded as objectionable, then the behavior\nexhibited by objectionable thick terms in\n section 4.1\n above either supports a pragmatic view of thin terms as well or\ndoesn’t support the Pragmatic View of thick terms and concepts\n(Eklund forthcoming). Insofar as we are convinced that thin terms are\nsemantically evaluative, this result might be bad news for the\nPragmatic View. (But see Sundell 2016, who argues that thin aesthetic\nterms aren’t inherently evaluative in meaning, but merely used\nevaluatively.) This leads us to our last topic: how do thick and thin\nconcepts differ from one another? \nFor a summary of further comparisons between Semantic and Pragmatic\nViews, see\n section 3\n of the supplementary document\n “Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance”. \nA crucial feature of the intuitive characterization of thick terms and\nconcepts with which we began is that they differ from the thin with\nrespect to the non-evaluative information each encode. Even if cruel\nacts are bad, not all bad acts can be cruel; cruel acts must involve,\nand are distinguished from other bad acts by, non-evaluative qualities\nsuch as taking pleasure in causing others to suffer. The thickening\nagent in thick terms is non-evaluative description. This contrast with\nthe thin may be understood in two kinds of ways: as a difference in\nkind, or as a difference in degree. As we consider each option in\nturn, we’ll see that the question of how thick and thin terms\nand concepts differ has no theory-neutral answer. \nOne way for thick and thin to differ in kind would be for thin terms\nexpress purely evaluative concepts and for thick terms to express\nconcepts that aren’t purely evaluative but encode also\nnon-evaluative information. An early version of this proposal is due\nto Bernard Williams: thin terms are wholly action-guiding whereas\nthick terms are both action-guiding and world-guided (Williams 1985:\n152). His particular version is problematic: the notion of\naction-guidingness isn’t as clear as one would like and many\nphilosophers take also thin terms to be world-guided in the sense that\ntheir application depends on how the world is. (For a more recent\nversion, see Dancy 2013: 47–51.) In its general form, this\nproposal presupposes the Semantic View but is available to both\nSeparabilists and Inseparabilists. Similarly, although Williams denies\nThin Centralism concerning the relations of conceptual and explanatory\npriority between thick and thin concepts, the general proposal could\nbe combined with Thin Centralism or the No Priority view. A potential\nproblem for it is that it isn’t clear whether all paradigmatic\nthin concepts are wholly evaluative, given the intuitive idea that\nthick terms are those that somehow involve both evaluation and\nnon-evaluative description. If ought implies can as\na conceptual or analytic matter, then its application will be\nrestricted by the non-evaluative condition that the agent is able to\nperform the action (Väyrynen 2013: 7). In that case\nought wouldn’t look descriptively much thinner than\nsome terms that are often classified as thick. The application of\nadmirable, for instance, is non-evaluatively constrained only\nby the non-evaluative features of admiration. As noted in\n section 3.2,\n not all entailments of an expression are encoded in its meaning and\nit isn’t straightforward to determine which are. But competence\nwith at least certain concepts ought can be used to express\nmay well require that if we think you ought to do something, we would\naccept that you can do it if the question came up. \nAnother way to think that thick and thin differ in kind is generated\nby Pragmatic Views. These views entail that thick terms aren’t\nevaluative as a matter of truth-conditions, but are only used\nevaluatively. Insofar as thin terms are evaluative as a matter of\ntruth-conditions, they will clearly differ in kind from the thick.\nHere the difference in kind would be such as to support\nNon-Centralism. However, as noted above, some arguments for Pragmatic\nViews might imply that thin terms are equally not evaluative as a\nmatter of truth-conditions but only used evaluatively. There would\nthen be no difference in kind (in this respect, anyway) between thick\nand thin. It would remain a separate question whether there are any\ninteresting relations of conceptual or explanatory priority between\nthick and thin concepts. \nThe second view about the relationship between thick and thin is that\nthey differ only in degree, not in kind. Samuel Scheffler suggests\nthis view in objecting to Bernard Williams’s claim that thick\nand thin differ in kind. He observes that there are many evaluative\nterms that are hard to classify as either thick or thin, such as\njust, fair, impartial, rights,\nautonomy, well-being, and consent. They are\nless rich in non-evaluative content than terms such as cruel\nor tactful, although richer than good or\nright. But if descriptive thickness is a matter of degree,\nthen perhaps a binary division of evaluative concepts into thick and\nthin is an “oversimplification” (Scheffler 1987:\n417–8). We might instead think of the distinction in terms of a\ncontinuum of descriptive thickness or specificity, where\nScheffler’s examples lie between paradigmatic thick and thin\nterms. On the thin end we might either allow that some thin terms are\npurely evaluative and treat them as a limiting case, or we might hold\nthat even the maximally thin concepts are a little bit thick. Those\nholding the latter view have advocated either Thin Centralism (Smith\n2013) or Thick Centralism (Chappell 2013), but the latter view, unlike\nthe former, seems compatible also with the No Priority View. \nWhatever the merits of this view about how thick and thin differ only\nin degree, it doesn’t follow simply from conceding that\nevaluative terms may be descriptively thick to varying degrees. This\nconcession allows a binary distinction between purely thin evaluative\nconcepts and thick evaluative concepts that are characterized by\nhaving some or other degree of non-evaluative content (cf. Dancy 2013:\n48–9). More definite conclusions about Scheffler’s\nproposal would require reflection on whether his examples could\nplausibly belong to a separate third category of evaluative terms that\nare neither thick nor thin, and on whether a principled distinction\ncan be drawn between different kinds of non-evaluative content. In the\nlatter case a paradigmatic thin term such as ought might be a\nlittle bit thick if it implied can, and yet lack a kind of\nnon-evaluative content that is possessed only by thick terms proper.\nPerhaps, for instance, the non-evaluative aspects of tactful\nand cruel distinguish their meanings from other evaluative\nterms in a way that can doesn’t do with\nought. \nIf thin terms are evaluative as a matter of truth-conditions, then any\nversion of the difference-in-degree view requires that the Semantic\nView is true of thick terms. It fits with Pragmatic Views only if\nthese take thick and thin terms both to be related to the evaluations\nthey convey in the same way (whether as a matter of presupposition,\nimplicature, or some kind of not-at-issue content). Either way it will\nbe a further question whether the view is best combined with Thin\nCentralism, Thick Centralism, No Priority View or Non-Centralism.\nAgain the question whether thick and thin differ in degree or in kind\nhas no theory-neutral answer but depends on the correct substantive\ntheory of thick terms and concepts. \nA final proposal we’ll consider can be developed either as\nsaying that thick and thin terms differ in kind or that they differ in\ndegree. R.M. Hare denies that thin terms are purely evaluative; actual\nusages of thin terms like good will always carry some\ndescriptive meaning. Instead, thick and thin terms both incorporate\nevaluative and non-evaluative information. The difference is that thin\nterms have their evaluative meaning “more firmly attached”\nto them than their non-evaluative meaning, whereas thick terms have\ntheir non-evaluative meaning “more firmly attached” to\nthem than their evaluative meaning (Hare 1963: 24–25; see also\nthe distinction between primarily and secondarily evaluative words in\nHare 1952: 121–2). The idea is that evaluative terms can be\ndistinguished in terms of which sort of meaning is less likely to\nchange when speakers alter their usage of a term. If\nlaissez-faire capitalists begin to use selfish\npositively, we are much more likely to still understand them than if\nthey started using selfish to describe generous acts. We\nwould be less likely to be accused of misusing kind and\ngenerous if we began to use them negatively to condemn\nbleeding hearts than if we started using them to describe cruel and\nselfish acts. Hare takes this to suggest that the non-evaluative\nmeanings of thick terms are more firmly attached to them than their\nevaluative meanings. Thin terms display the opposite behavior. We will\nunderstand those who use good to evaluate promise-breaking,\ntorture, and enslavement of their enemies positively, whereas we would\nbe liable to be misunderstood or accused of misusing the word if we\nstarted using good to express negative evaluations of helping\nand respecting others. Such descriptive ossification of thin terms,\nwhile not impossible, would seem very much like an exception rather\nthan the rule. (Hare 1952: 123 notes that a good effluent\nfunctions as a descriptive technical term in sewage disposal manuals.)\nSo the evaluative meanings of thin terms (in particular, their\naction-guiding function) seem to be more firmly attached to them than\ntheir non-evaluative meanings. \nHare’s proposal seems quite ecumenical. If you worry that the\ntalk of evaluative and non-evaluative meanings suggests that\nHare’s proposal is committed to Separability, note that it can\nbe reformulated as follows: thick and thin terms are typically used to\nperform two kinds of speech acts, describing and evaluating, and they\ndiffer with respect to how likely a speaker is to be misunderstood or\naccused of misusing the term if one or the other of these speech acts\nis changed. For instance, a speaker who uses selfish to\nevaluate positively acts which we typically describe as selfish would\nbe more likely to be understood than a speaker who uses\nselfish to describe generous acts and evaluate them\nnegatively, whereas the opposite pattern holds for thin terms. This\nversion of the proposal seems compatible with Inseparability. Nor does\nthe proposal entail the Semantic View. Instead of taking evaluative\nand non-evaluative meanings both to be semantic meanings, the less\nfirmly attached meaning can be taken as a speaker meaning instead. One\nway to interpret Hare’s distinction between primarily and\nsecondarily evaluative words is that the latter carry evaluation only\nas a speaker meaning whereas the former carry non-evaluative\ndescription only as a speaker meaning (Hare 1952: 121–4). The\nPragmatic View is well suited to treating the evaluations normally\nconveyed by T-utterances as speaker meanings, especially if they are\nbest explained by conversational mechanisms. Here we can finally ask\nwhether Hare’s proposal makes thick and thin different in kind\nor degree. You might think the latter: how firmly two things are\nattached is a matter of degree. However, the distinction between\nsemantic and speaker meaning makes a difference-in-kind reading\navailable. If the non-evaluative meanings of thick terms are semantic\nmeanings and their evaluative meanings are speaker meanings but thin\nterms work the other way around, then Hare’s proposal regarding\nwhat kind of meanings thick and thin terms are more firmly attached to\nwould be a difference in kind. \nFor a summary of how thick terms and concepts relate to a further sort\nof evaluative terms, pejoratives, see\n section 4\n of the supplementary document\n “Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance”. \nThick concepts have been a stable topic of debate among moral\nphilosophers since the seminal discussion in Williams (1985) and have\nenjoyed something of a resurgence in ethics since 2010 or so. Thick\nconcepts are also receiving increasing attention in such other areas\nof philosophy as epistemology, aesthetics, legal philosophy, and more.\n(Such attention is often motivated, as in ethics, by dissatisfaction\nwith the extant state of the field.) \nFor some while now, aestheticians and philosophers of art have paid\nattention to thick aesthetic concepts such as garish,\ndelicate, and balanced, in addition to\nthin(ner) concepts such as beautiful and ugly.\nSome of these discussions go back to the\n1950s, predating the post-Williams debate in ethics, but concern some\nof the same issues even if they don’t use the label\n“thick” (Beardsley 1982 and Sibley 2001; see also Burton\n1992 and Zangwill 1995). Also relevant is the recent attention to\n“dual character concepts” (section 1) in art (Liao et\nal. 2020). Discussions of thick aesthetic concepts often mirror\ndiscussions in ethics about whether thick terms are evaluative as a\nmatter of truth-conditions or only pragmatically (recent examples\nincludes Bonzon 2009, Zangwill 2013, and Stojanovic 2016). Of\nparticular interest and potentially broader significance is the\nemerging exploration of whether also thin aesthetic terms might be\nplausibly treated as only pragmatically evaluative (Sundell 2016). \nThere has been increasing attention in epistemology to thick epistemic\nconcepts such as gullible, quick to jump to\nconclusions, and open-minded. This is\nparticularly common in virtue epistemology, which seeks to explain\nepistemic properties such as knowledge and justified belief in terms\nof the cognizer’s intellectual virtues and vices. Whether\nfocusing on thick epistemic concepts can lead to a preferable\nepistemology is the topic of several papers in a special issue of the\njournal Philosophical Papers (Kotzee and Wanderer 2008; see\nalso Battaly 2001). A foundational question here is whether there is a\ndistinction between thick and thin epistemic concepts and whether it\nbe understood in the same way as the distinction between thick and\nthin ethical concepts (Väyrynen 2008; Roberts 2018a). For\ninstance, are thick epistemic concepts supposed to be thick in the\nsense that they involve evaluation and non-evaluative description, or\nin the sense that they involve epistemic and non-epistemic content?\n(These are different distinctions even if epistemic content is often\nevaluative and non-epistemic content often non-evaluative.) These\ndiscussions almost invariably assume that knowledge\nis a thin concept. But Brent Kyle argues\nthat knowledge is better understood as a thick\nconcept and uses its thickness to cast light on why the so-called\nGettier problem for definitions of knowledge arises (Kyle 2013b). \nBeyond ethics, aesthetics, and epistemology, attention to thick\nconcepts has been more scattered. In legal philosophy, David Enoch and\nKevin Toh suggest not only that legal statements often express\nconcepts that seem thick, such as crime and\ninheritance, but also that legal\nis itself a thick concept. Specifically, it\ninvolves both a representation of certain social facts and a kind of\nevaluative endorsement. Treating legal as a\nthick concept allows debates about the nature of law to draw on the\nbroader philosophical context of debates about thick concepts in\nethics, and in this way has potential to introduce new input into and\noptions for thinking about the nature of law. (Enoch and Toh 2013.) In\nmetaphysics, Gideon Yaffe argues that if we treat free will as a thick\nconcept that involves positive evaluation of items that fall under it,\nwe are better able to explain certain facts about freedom of will than\nif we proceed with the more standard assumption that freedom of will\nis a non-evaluative concept (Yaffe 2000). Finally, the idea of a thick\nconcept has also been invoked to do significant work in various areas\nof applied philosophy. Empirical research on moral judgment in\npsychology and neuroscience may be criticized for having restricted\nits studies to judgments involving thin concepts and ignoring thick\nconcepts, especially if thick concepts are irreducibly thick (Abend\n2011; see also FitzGerald and Goldie 2012). In environmental ethics,\nclassifying concepts such as ecological\nintegrity as thick might be thought to buttress their normative\nsignificance (Shockley 2012). In risk theory, arguing that concepts of\nrisk and safety are\nthick might help to show how these concepts can be evaluative without\nbeing socially constructed (Möller 2012). Outside of philosophy,\nit has been suggested that sociological research into specific\ngroups’ or societies’ repertoires of thick concepts can\ndeliver insights into how thick concepts work which cannot be obtained\nfrom the armchair and provide access to important aspects of social\nlife which aren’t accessible via thin concepts (Abend 2019).\nTime will tell whether thick concepts will come to make a greater\nimpact in these and other areas. \nAttention to thick concepts in various areas of philosophy is often\ninspired by dissatisfaction with dominant lines of research and the\nhope that thick concepts will redirect the work in these areas. We\nhave seen that cashing out this hope often requires substantial\nassumptions regarding issues such as the anti-disentangling argument,\nshapelessness, the inseparability of evaluation and description, and\nthe location of evaluation in the semantics and pragmatics of thick\nterms. A plausible theory of thick concepts may then not give thick\nconcepts the significance their fans take them to have, and either way\nthese assumptions attract substantial resistance in their own right.\nOn the other hand, those who find thick concepts to have little\ndistinctive significance nonetheless must ensure that evaluative and\nnormative domains can be accounted for in terms of thin concepts in a\nway that addresses the concerns that inspire interest in thick\nconcepts. Any complete theory of normativity and value must therefore\nreckon somehow or other with the fundamental issues concerning thick\nconcepts.","contact.mail":"p.vayrynen@leeds.ac.uk","contact.domain":"leeds.ac.uk"}]
