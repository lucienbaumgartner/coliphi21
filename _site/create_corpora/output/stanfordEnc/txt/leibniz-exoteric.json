Leibniz is a difficult philosopher to\nstudy. One central reason for this is that the content of his\nphilosophy is extremely challenging. It involves a range of\nsubtle distinctions and paradoxical theses, such as the denial of\ncausal interaction between substances and the thesis that each\nsubstance expresses every other substance in the universe. Just\nas significant, however, is the fact that his philosophical corpus is\nimmense, comprising a bewildering array of letters, notes, essays, and\nlarger manuscripts. These writings span a period of over fifty\nyears. Only a small number of his essays and one philosophical\nbook, the Essais de\nthéodicée, were published during his lifetime. \nNone of his published or unpublished works is considered a magnum\nopus on the order of Spinoza's Ethics or\nKant's Critique of Pure Reason. The complexity of\nLeibniz's literary remains forces scholars of his thought to\nengage difficult questions: how much continuity is there between\nLeibniz's treatments of particular topics at different times in\nhis career? On what issues does he attain considered views? \nShould certain texts be privileged over others in attempting to discern\nLeibniz's views? Is Leibniz a deeply systematic philosopher\nwho addresses a wide range of problems from the perspective of a\nunified theory, or does he apply his penetrating mind to a series of\nphilosophical problems with little concern for the systematic coherence\nof his results?\n\n\n\nOne clue for approaching the labyrinth of Leibniz's texts is a\ndistinction that he draws between esoteric\n(acroamaticus/acroamatique) and exoteric\n(exotericus/exoterique) presentations of his philosophy. \nRoughly speaking an esoteric presentation is one that is fully rigorous\nwhile an exoteric or “popular” presentation is less\nrigorous but easier to understand, which is more appropriate for a\ngeneral audience. Leibniz distinguishes between these two modes\nof presentation early in his career and explicitly classifies many of\nhis (later) published works such as the Essais de\nthéodicée as exoteric. This distinction is\nclearly relevant to the questions raised in the previous\nparagraph. If it is possible to distinguish between esoteric and\nexoteric texts, then the most precise statements of Leibniz's\nconsidered views are likely to be found in the esoteric texts. \nSimilarly, if Leibniz's treatments of an issue in different works\nseem to be in tension with one another, one potential explanation of\nthe discrepancy is that one treatment is esoteric and the other is\nexoteric. \n\n\n\nIn order to plausibly use Leibniz's distinction between the\nesoteric and the exoteric as an interpretive tool one must have a more\ndetailed account of how he understands the distinction. This\nitself is not an easy matter, however, as Leibniz's remarks on\nthe distinction also require interpretation. One challenge for\nunderstanding his views on this issue is that some of his most explicit\nremarks on it are written quite early in his career. Although it\nis clear that he does not abandon the distinction later in his career\none should not uncritically assume that his views on the distinction do\nnot change over time. A second challenge is that Leibniz\ntypically does not identify his exoteric texts as exoteric within those\ntexts. For example, if you were to focus exclusively on what\nLeibniz writes in the Système nouveau de la nature et de la\ncommunication des substances, aussi bien que de l'union\nqu'il y a entre l'âme et le corps (New\nsystem of the nature and communication of substances, and of the union\nof the soul and body)—the first public presentation of his\nphilosophy—you would have no idea that it is a popular\npresentation of is views. It is only in letters to certain of his\ncorrespondents that Leibniz identifies this text as exoteric. And\nwhen he does identify a text as exoteric he often provides few details\nabout exactly what this is supposed to involve. A third challenge\nfor understanding Leibniz's views is that he does not use the\nterms “esoteric” and “exoteric”\nunivocally. Sometimes these words are used to distinguish\ndifferent kinds of content that a philosophy might have; other times\nthey signify different modes of presenting one's\nphilosophy. It will be crucial to disambiguate these terms as we\nproceed.\n\n\n\nThe notion of an exoteric Leibnizian philosophy is often associated\nwith Bertrand Russell's influential interpretation of\nLeibniz. Russell infamously claimed that the difference between\nLeibniz's public and private writings is so significant that they\neffectively comprise two distinct philosophies: a theologically\nimbued fantasy designed to please royalty, and his true philosophy,\nderived from austere logical principles, that he revealed to a select\nfew of his correspondents (Russell 1945). In recent decades\nRussell's view has been rejected; nearly everyone agrees that\nthere is more continuity between Leibniz's public and private\nworks than Russell was willing to admit (see Curley 1982 for a critique\nof Russell's view). And as we will see, the distinction\nbetween the esoteric and the exoteric does not involve a simple\nclassification of his works depending on whether or not they were\npublished. In order to attain a more accurate understanding of\nLeibniz's distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric we\nmust turn to his views on the ideal form that metaphysics should\ntake. \n\n\n\nLeibniz conceived of metaphysics as an a priori demonstrative\nscience. In its ideal form metaphysics would be presented in a\nmanner analogous to Euclid's Elements, where\npropositions are rigorously demonstrated on the basis of definitions\nand axioms. The point of departure for this conception of\nmetaphysics is Leibniz's theory of truth. Leibniz thought\nthat truth consisted in conceptual containment: a proposition is\ntrue just in case the concept of the predicate is contained in the\nconcept of the subject. This implies that all metaphysical truths\nare conceptual truths. Leibniz thought that a concept could be\ndefined by analyzing it into simpler component concepts. A\nrigorous demonstration, for Leibniz, consists in a “chain of\ndefinitions” (catena definitionum) where one moves from\npremises to a conclusion via the substitution of definitionally\nequivalent terms (A II.i.398; L:198). In order for such\ndemonstrations to attain the degree of certainty found in geometry they\nwould need to be set forth in a purely formal system, which Leibniz\ntermed his “universal characteristic” (characteristica\nuniversalis). The universal characteristic would allow one\nto express in a purely formal manner the composition of any concept on\nthe basis of a set of primitive concepts. This system of\nrepresentation, in conjunction with a logical calculus for expressing\nidentity and inclusion relations among concepts, would enable one to\nset forth a strictly demonstrative metaphysics (see Rutherford 1996 for\na detailed discussion of Leibniz's conception of a demonstrative\nmetaphysics).  \n\nLeibniz's conception of an ideal metaphysics was incredibly\nambitious. He made impressive progress on the project during his\ncareer, though he fell well short of attaining his lofty ideal. \nSome of Leibniz's very early texts contain stretches of argument\nthat are not carefully divided into axioms, definitions, propositions,\nand demonstrations, but which could be reconstructed to fit that\nmodel. Consider, for example, Leibniz's unpublished 1672–3\nConfessio Philosophi (The Confession of a Philosopher). \nTowards the beginning of this work, after providing definitions of\n“God,” “justice,” “love,” and\n“harmony,” he demonstrates that “happiness consists\nin the most harmonious state of mind” (A VI.iii.117;\nCP:31). Leibniz then argues (in the voice of The\nPhilosopher):  \n\nLeibniz's demonstration is slightly informal here (as one\nmight expect in a dialogue), but it could easily be reconstructed in\ndeductive form. In 1675–6 Leibniz wrote a number of unpublished\npapers and notes on metaphysical topics (most of the papers are\nincluded in Parkinson's De Summa Rerum: Metaphysical\nPapers, 1675–1676). These texts include definitions of key\nmetaphysical concepts and many informal demonstrations of metaphysical\npropositions. In the late 1670's Leibniz completed several\nshort drafts of works that were divided into axioms, definitions, and\npropositions, although the subject matter of those works was not\nstrictly metaphysical (see De Obligatione Credendi A\nVI.iv.c.2149–2155 and Animadversiones in schedam ex Batavis\nMissam A VI.iv.c.2204–2210). In 1679 Leibniz quickly\ncomposed a work that was closer to the ideal of a demonstrative science\nof metaphysics than anything he had written to date (De\nAffectibus AVI.iv.b.1410–1441). It contained a long list of\ndefinitions of key terms along with some demonstrations of metaphysical\nprinciples and theses. Leibniz's project continued in the\n1680's in a series of extensive definitional studies of key\nconcepts (see e.g. De Notionibus Omnia Quae Cogitamus\nContinentibus A.VI.iv.a.398–405, Definitiones Notionum\nMetaphysicarum atque Logicarum A.VI.iv.a.624–630, and Tabula\nNotionum Praeparanda A.VI.iv.a.630–635). By 1690 Leibniz had\ndeveloped a logical calculus for expressing identity and inclusion\nrelations among concepts. Around this time, however, Leibniz\nbegan to doubt whether it was possible to discover absolutely primitive\nconcepts. He also did not succeed in developing his purely formal\nsystem of representation, the universal characteristic. Without\nprimitive concepts or the universal characteristic it was not possible\nfor Leibniz to attain his ideal of a fully demonstrative\nmetaphysics. It is plausible to think that Leibniz could\nnevertheless have completed a work that was an approximation of the\nideal, written in Latin and using non-primitive concepts. Leibniz\ninsisted throughout his later years that he could complete a work along\nthese lines. In 1710, for example, he explains to correspondent\nCharles Hugony that in his (Leibniz's) recently published\nEssais de théodicée he set forth one part of his\nviews “in an informal manner” and that he is\n“thinking of [writing] a Latin work in which I will try to unfold\nmy entire system” (G 3:680). And in 1715 Leibniz writes to\nBiber: “if God will grant me more free time, I will attempt\nby means of well-formed demonstrations to impart to a good portion of\nmy views the certainty of Euclid's Elements”\n(LBr:64). But Leibniz never did unfold his entire system, even in\nthis less ambitious form.  \n\nLeibniz's account of the ideal form of metaphysics provides\nthe basis for one of the ways that he distinguishes between the\nesoteric and the exoteric. In one of his earliest philosophical\nworks, a very opinionated preface to an edition of a book by Marius\nNizolius, Leibniz distinguishes between esoteric and exoteric modes of\nphilosophizing. In this text he claims that the notion of\ndemonstration provides the line of demarcation between the esoteric and\nexoteric modes. In the former “all things are\ndemonstrated” while in the latter less rigorous forms of\nargumentation are utilized (e.g., supporting a proposition by means of\nan analogical argument). Works written in the exoteric mode,\nthough useful in various respects, are “not most rigorous, not\nmost exact” (A VI.ii.416). In this and other texts Leibniz\nequates the esoteric mode of philosophizing with the geometrical model\nof demonstration, as briefly described above.  \n\nWe have already seen that Leibniz never completed a work in\nmetaphysics that was in strict accordance with the geometrical model of\ndemonstration. It follows from this that all of Leibniz's\nmetaphysical writings are exoteric (in this sense), strictly\nspeaking! It is important to recognize, however, that there are\ndegrees of exoteric discourse. Works like Leibniz's famed\nMonadologie, for example, are less exoteric (or more esoteric)\nthan Leibniz's Essais de théodicée because\nthey more closely approximate the geometrical ideal.  \n\nLeibniz advocated the geometrical model of demonstration as the\nideal form for metaphysics throughout his career. He claimed\nlater in his career that he had all the materials at hand to compose a\nwork that was a close approximation of the ideal. Yet such a work\nhe did not compose. Why did Leibniz not make more progress on\nthis task, which would seem to be of such great importance? \nLeibniz often mentioned his lack of free time as the reason for not\ncompleting an esoteric treatise. But this seems to provide an\nincomplete explanation of the situation. Though his\nextra-philosophical duties were numerous and burdensome, he made the\ntime to write quite a lot on metaphysical subjects. If he thought\nthat the geometrical model of demonstration was indeed the ideal form\nfor metaphysics, one cannot help but wonder why he did not find the\ntime to begin composing such a work.  \n\nIt is likely that there were several additional factors that led\nLeibniz to compose exoteric rather than esoteric works. Consider\nthe following remarks on the distinction between exoteric and esoteric\nmodes of exposition in his 1704 Nouveaux Essais sur\nl'entendement humain (an unpublished critical examination of\nLocke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding written in\ndialogue form). The remarks occur in the context of a discussion\nof the precision (or lack thereof) in natural language: \n\nIn this intriguing text Leibniz (through the voice of Theophilus)\nnotes that few people have tried to write in the esoteric mode, and\neven fewer (if any) have succeeded in the endeavor. He also\nsuggests several reasons that authors avoid esoteric expositions. \nEsoteric texts are both difficult to compose and unlikely to attract\nreaders, presumably because of their intimidating formal\napparatus. And what is the point of writing a text that no one is\ngoing to read? This point is also emphasized by Leibniz in a 1705\nletter to Burnett: “I never write anything in philosophy\nthat I do not treat by definitions and axioms, though I do not always\ngive it that mathematical air, which puts people off, for one must\nspeak in a familiar manner to be read by ordinary people” (G\n3:302). Despite these significant drawbacks to writing in the\nesoteric mode, Leibniz insists that if someone pursued this strategy\n“in the right way” it would be a worthwhile project. \nIn the New Essays Leibniz does not explain what doing this\n“in the right way” would involve. He does, however,\nprovide some important additional remarks on esoteric philosophy\nearlier in the text. In the Preface he points out some\nkey differences between his philosophy and the philosophy of\nLocke:   \n\nIn these remarks Leibniz is using the term “esoteric” in a\nsubtly different way than he is in the earlier quote from the New\nEssays. Whereas in the first text “esoteric”\ndesignated a mode of presenting one's philosophy, in this\ntext it concerns the content of one's philosophy. Here he is\ndrawing attention to the fact that his philosophy is less\n“popular” than Locke's.  Locke's philosophy is popular in\nthe sense that much of his philosophy accords with the deliverances of\nthe senses and so-called “common sense.” Leibniz's\nphilosophy, in contrast, is often very abstract and far removed from\nordinary opinions. The ordinary person, for example, is unlikely to\nbelieve that bodies are aggregates of an infinity of immaterial\nmind-like entities (a thesis that Leibniz affirms on a number of\noccasions). This puts Leibniz at a significant disadvantage when it\ncomes to presenting his philosophy to the general public.  Readers are\nfar more likely to find favor with Locke's philosophy given that it\ncoheres much better with their current beliefs (see Nelson 2007 for\nmore on this general theme).  \n\nIn some of his letters to trusted correspondents Leibniz makes this\npoint in even stronger terms. Consider, for example, what Leibniz\nwrites to Pierre Bayle in 1702: \n\nThese are striking words. Read in isolation from his other\nremarks on the exoteric/esoteric distinction, one might take this text\nto suggest that Leibniz had two distinct philosophies—a false\nphilosophy suitable for presentation to the public, and his true\nphilosophy, which he only revealed to a few trusted\ncorrespondents. But Leibniz's claim is not as radical as it\nmight initially seem. His point, as additional texts will make\nclear, is that he thinks it is often useless and harmful to\nstraightforwardly present the content of his metaphysics to\nthe public (and even to trusted correspondents). The esoteric\ncharacter of the content of Leibniz's metaphysics made it\nsusceptible to being seriously misunderstood—a state of affairs\nthat Leibniz was deeply concerned to avoid.  \n\nLeibniz faced what might seem like an intractable problem. He\nthought that the ideal form for metaphysics was the esoteric mode of\npresentation. However, he knew that few people were inclined to\nread texts presented in the esoteric mode due to their daunting formal\nstructure. Even worse, Leibniz thought that the content of his\nphilosophy was such that most people were likely to misunderstand it in\nfundamental ways. How then would it be possible for him to\ncommunicate his views to the public? An answer to this question\nis suggested in some unpublished remarks appended to metaphysical notes\nthat Leibniz wrote in 1676. I have divided it into several parts\nfor ease of reference: \n\n[a] is a terse reference to the esoteric mode of presentation. \nAlthough this is the way that metaphysics should ideally be written, he\nthinks that it would be a mistake to publish anything that\n“conflicts too much with received opinions.” As we\nhave already seen, this is because many people will regard it as\nabsurd, summarily reject it, or misunderstand it entirely (possibly all\nthree at the same time!). Leibniz suggests a strategy of\nselective omission, not to permanently hide the controversial features\nof his philosophy, but as part of a longer-term strategy of preparing\nhis readers to understand his most esoteric doctrines. In some\ncases he thinks that sympathetic readers who study his texts\n“more profoundly” will be able to infer the esoteric\nconclusions themselves. In [d] he suggests a complementary\nstrategy of supplementation. In subsequent works he can\nexplicitly draw the conclusions that may have only been implicit in the\ninitial text. Taken collectively Leibniz's remarks in this\npassage suggest that the primary function of exoteric texts is to serve\nas intellectual stepping stones that enable his readers to gradually\nmove from received opinions to esoteric doctrine. \n\nA number of Leibniz's remarks in later texts confirm that he\nconceives of exoteric texts as important preparatory works. \nConsider, for example, what he writes to Fontenelle in 1704:  \n\nHere Leibniz explicitly claims that his choice to present various\nfeatures of his philosophy in journal articles should be understood as\npart of a broad exoteric strategy to prepare his readers to understand\nthe “true metaphysics.” This helps shed light on some\nof Leibniz's better-known remarks about the composition of his\njournal articles. Consider what Leibniz writes to correspondent\nNicolas Remond in 1714: \n\nLeibniz's strategy of adapting himself to the language of the\nschools in some articles and to the language of the Cartesians in\nothers is one of his core exoteric strategies. He thinks that\nusing language that is familiar with his readers is a good way to make\nhis views seem not too far removed from received opinions. This\nis not merely a feature of his published writings. Leibniz\ntailors his writings in a similar way in his private\ncorrespondences. For example, in his correspondence with Jesuit\ntheologian Bartholomew Des Bosses he frequently employs scholastic\nterminology, and in his correspondence with (largely) Cartesian\nphysicist Burcher de Volder he sometimes presents his views with a\nCartesian slant. To use a more concrete example, early in the\ncorrespondence with de Volder, Leibniz appeals to the doctrine of\ncontinued divine creation, which he (Leibniz) regards as a central\nCartesian tenet. Although he initially presents the doctrine in a\nway that makes it seem like this is a point of common doctrine between\nhim and the Cartesians, it emerges later in the correspondence that\nLeibniz only affirms the doctrine in a qualified sense (for a detailed\ndiscussion of this issue see Whipple 2011). The general strategy\nhere is to use language that is familiar to the reader or correspondent\nand to emphasize initial points of agreement. Fine-grained\ndifferences and esoteric implications are typically avoided at the\ninitial stages of engagement. \n\nOne important general point that emerges from Leibniz's\nremarks in the letter to Remond is that there was more than one set of\n“received opinions” that he needed to take into\naccount. The received opinions of a Cartesian and the opinions of\nsomeone who was committed to a version of Aristotelian Scholasticism\nwould be different in fundamental respects. In the letter cited\nabove Leibniz speaks of another of his works, the Principes de la\nNature et de la Grace, fondés en raison (Principles of\nNature and Grace, Based on Reason), which targets yet another\naudience—those who are not accustomed to the style of the\nCartesians or the scholastics. When it comes to exoteric\nphilosophy, one size does not fit all. Different strategies are\nrequired for people with different backgrounds and views.  \n\nLeibniz is sometimes described as being an eclectic\nphilosopher. There are different ways of understanding\neclecticism, but the basic idea is that an eclectic philosopher is one\nwho incorporates ideas from a wide range of sources. In certain\nplaces Leibniz characterizes himself as proceeding along these\nlines. He famously writes to Remond, for example, that:\n “I have tried to uncover and unite the truth buried and\nscattered under the opinions of all the philosophical sects, and I\nbelieve I have added something of my own that takes a few steps\nforward…most sects are right in a good part of what they affirm,\nbut not so much in what they deny” (10 Jan 1714, G3:606–7;\nL:654). It is undeniable that Leibniz read from an extraordinary\nrange of sources and that his thought was influenced by a number of\nthese texts. Although the precise nature of these influences is a\nmatter of scholarly controversy that cannot be engaged in this article,\nit is important to note that Leibniz's exoteric strategies bear\nsignificantly on this general topic. Recall the final sentence in\nthe long quotation from Leibniz's 1676 notes on exoteric\nphilosophy: “In this metaphysics, it will be useful for\nthere to be added here and there the authoritative utterances of great\nmen, who have reasoned in a similar way; especially when these\nutterances contain something that seems to have some possible relevance\nto the illustration of a view (A VI.iii.573).” Appealing to\nsimilarities between his views and those of his predecessors is one of\nLeibniz's strategies for presenting his philosophy in a way that\nmakes it seem to be not too far from received opinions. We need\nto remain open to the possibility that Leibniz's proclamations of\ncontinuity between his thought and the thought of his philosophical\nforebears often mask subtle or not so subtle differences between their\nrespective views. Nuanced differences and radical implications\nmay be left implicit or omitted entirely in his more exoteric\nworks. One might put the point as follows. Leibniz is not\nmerely finding ideas in other philosophers and incorporating them whole\ncloth into his philosophical system. In some cases, at least,\nLeibniz develops distinctive philosophical views and then seeks out\nsimilar ideas in his predecessors as a strategy for presenting his\nviews to the public (see Schepers 2008 and Mercer, 2001:23–59 for more\non this topic). \n\nLeibniz first presented his philosophy to the public in an essay\ntitled “Système nouveau de la nature et de la\ncommunication des substances, aussi bien que de l'union\nqu'il y a entre l'âme et le corps” (New\nsystem of the nature and communication of substances, and of the union\nof the soul and body). This essay was published in 1695 in the\nJournal des savants. If one were to read this essay in\nisolation from Leibniz's other writings (as would have been the\ncase with most of his readers) one would likely have no idea that it is\nan exoteric text. He prefaces the essay in the following way: \n\nNote that Leibniz claims that his meditations are “not at all\npopular” and that many people will not be able to appreciate\nthem. These remarks, in conjunction with the comment on\npreconceived opinions, are designed to encourage the reader to\nseriously consider the views that he will be presenting despite the\nfact that they will be difficult to understand and will likely\ndiverge—perhaps significantly—from the reader's\ncurrent beliefs. What Leibniz leaves unsaid, however, is that the\nSystème nouveau is written according to the exoteric\nmode of presentation. First, the essay is clearly not written in\naccordance with the formal apparatus of definitions and demonstrations\nthat is required in a strictly esoteric presentation. Second, and\nperhaps more significantly, Leibniz purposefully omits some of the most\ncontroversial features of his philosophical system in this\nessay.  \n\nIn order to more fully appreciate the exoteric features of the\nSystème nouveau it will be helpful to consider this\ntext in relation to Leibniz's earlier Discours de\nmétaphysique (Discourse on Metaphysics). Leibniz\nwrote the Discours in 1686. Although it was not\npublished during his lifetime, this text has become one of\nLeibniz's most famous works. It is best known for\npresenting the complete concept theory of substance. This theory\nstates, roughly, that each substance has an infinitely complex complete\nconcept that specifies everything that will ever happen to that\nsubstance. It is contained in the complete concept of Judas, for\nexample, that he betrays Jesus (along with everything else that can be\ntruly predicated of Judas). Leibniz was well aware that his\nreaders would think that the complete concept theory implies that all\nof a person's actions are necessary, and thus that no person is\nfree. In the main text of the Discours and in its\nsection headings Leibniz attempts to show that Judas' betrayal of\nJesus, for example, is both contingent and free. Part of\nLeibniz's strategy for showing this is his claim that\nJudas' reasons for betraying Jesus “incline without\nnecessitating.” Leibniz's discussion of these thorny\nphilosophical issues is exoteric, at least to a certain degree. \nLike the Système nouveau it was not written in strict\naccordance with the esoteric mode of presentation. And arguably,\nLeibniz's use of language such as “inclination without\nnecessitation” is carefully chosen with the aim of making his\nposition seem closer to received views.  \n\nThe section headings of the Discours were sent to Antoine\nArnauld, a well-regarded theologian and philosopher of the day, to see\nhow the text would be received. Leibniz could not have been\nencouraged by Arnauld's response: “I find in these\nthoughts so many things which alarm me and which almost all men, if I\nam not mistaken, will find so shocking, that I do not see of what use a\nwriting can be, which apparently all the world will reject” (G\n2:15). Arnauld singled out as an example the complete concept\ntheory of substance, which he took to imply a “more than fatal\nnecessity” that would undermine the very possibility of human\nfreedom. Leibniz's attempts to forestall this implication\nin the sections headings of the Discours had not worked as\nplanned, at least for Arnauld. Leibniz attempted to assuage\nArnauld's concerns in subsequent letters with moderate success.   \n\nIt is no surprise that Leibniz chose not to publish the\nDiscours. It is also no surprise that the complete\nconcept theory of substance does not make an appearance in the\nSystème nouveau. This does not imply that Leibniz\nabandoned the complete concept theory; it might just be that he came to\nrealize that it was not the most effective way of introducing readers\nto his philosophical system. Leibniz utilizes the exoteric\nstrategy of selective omission, choosing to avoid a detailed discussion\nof necessity and contingency. Instead he introduces his theory of\nsubstance by appealing to the less controversial characteristics of\nunity and activity, and by trying to show how his theory could resolve\nthe notorious problem of mind-body interaction. Letters to some\nof Leibniz's correspondents confirm that he was “testing\nthe waters” in the Système nouveau, and that he\nwould reveal more of his system to the public if it was well\nreceived. He writes to Simon Foucher:   \n\nLeibniz's aim was not to permanently hide his views on\ncontingency, fate, and freedom. By selectively omitting some of\nthese more controversial features of his system he increased the\nlikelihood that his readers would grasp the features of his system that\nwere presented in the Système nouveau. Once they\nendorsed these parts of the system they would be more receptive to\nLeibniz's views on more controversial topics. Such was\nLeibniz's hope, in any case. \n\nLeibniz returned to the topics of fate, necessity, and contingency\nin the one philosophical book that he published during his lifetime,\nthe Essais de théodicée of 1710. It has\nbeen suggested in the secondary literature that Leibniz's\ntreatment of necessity and contingency in this text is exoteric to a\nsignificant degree (Adams, 1994:52). For example, Leibniz\nfrequently uses terms such as “inclination without\nnecessitating,” “moral necessity,” and\n“hypothetical necessity” without providing strict\ndefinitions of them. Some of Leibniz's predecessors\nunderstood these terms in ways that implied a non-deterministic view of\nhuman action. According to most interpretations of\nLeibniz's considered views on these issues (based on a number of\ntexts other than the Essais de théodicée), he\nwas committed to a strict determinism (but not necessitarianism) about\nhuman actions. However, by omitting definitions of terms like\n“moral necessity” in the Essais de\nthéodicée Leibniz might have allowed readers that\nwere committed to non-deterministic accounts of “moral\nnecessity” to assume that he was using this concept in a way that\nwas less deterministic than his considered view allowed. This is\nin keeping with Leibniz's stated strategy of not presenting\nanything to the public that is too far removed from received\nopinions. One way of not presenting something to the public that\nis far removed from received opinions is to selectively omit it (his\nstrategy in the Système nouveau). Another\nstrategy is to present a view that is far removed from received\nopinions in a way that makes it seem less removed than it actually\nis. If Leibniz is utilizing this latter strategy in the\ndiscussions of necessity and contingency in the Essais de\nthéodicée, it does not imply that Leibniz is trying\nto permanently mislead his readers. As we have seen, he has\nseveral general strategies for helping his reader progress to a more\nrigorous understanding of his views. One of the strategies is to\nprovide subtle hints such that a “more profound”\nexamination of the text would yield a deeper understanding. By\nomitting clear definitions of terms such as “moral\nnecessity,” however, it is not clear whether there is enough\nmaterial in the Essais de théodicée for even a\ndiscerning reader to grasp Leibniz's views on necessity and\ncontingency. But Leibniz did not claim that such inferences could\nalways be made on the basis of an exoteric text alone. In a\nnumber of cases his exoteric treatments need to be supplemented by a\nmore rigorous work. And we must keep in mind that Leibniz clearly\ndid conceive of the Essais de théodicée in\nprecisely this way (see Antognazza, 2009:481–2). He writes to\nCharles Hugony shortly after its publication:  \n\nLeibniz's remarks in this passage cohere well with the other\nremarks on exoteric philosophy that we have considered thus far. \nAs in the case of the Système nouveau and\nLeibniz's other journal articles, he conceives of the Essais\nde théodicée as a preparatory work that will help\nprepare his readers for a more systematic and rigorous presentation of\nhis views.  \n\nWe have seen that the primary function of exoteric texts is to serve\nas intellectual stepping-stones that bridge the gulf between received\nopinions and esoteric truth. Leibniz utilizes a wide range of\nstrategies in his exoteric works, some of which we have already\ndiscussed. Several additional strategies deserve mention as\nwell. Let us begin by returning to Leibniz's remarks on the\ndistinction between esoteric and exoteric modes of presentation in the\n1670 Preface to Nizolius: \n\nOne point that we take Leibniz to be making here is that in exoteric\ncontexts propositions can be treated as hypotheses rather than\nproviding rigorous demonstrations of them. He seems to think that\nin certain cases his readers will be less hostile to a novel thesis if\nit is presented as a hypothesis than if it is presented as a thesis\nthat can be demonstrated from metaphysical principles. Although\npropositions that are presented hypothetically are not demonstrated\nthey can be motivated and illustrated by examples, analogies,\nmetaphors, and stories (as he says later on). He does not,\nhowever, claim that an esoteric work cannot contain analogies,\nmetaphors, and the like. It can include these things, which\n“give a pleasing respite to a weary soul,” so long as they\nare carefully distinguished from the rigorous demonstrations that form\nthe core of the work. Leibniz notes that this difference is also\nobserved in mathematics where demonstrations, which are rigorous and\nexact, are carefully distinguished from scholia in which reasoning can\nbe treated in a more familiar manner. \n\nIt is striking to look at a text like the Monadologie\nthrough the lens of Leibniz's remarks about the distinction\nbetween esoteric and exoteric modes of presentation in the Preface to\nNizolious (and the other texts that we have considered thus far). \nThe text is replete with analogies, metaphors, and other forms of\nargumentation that fall well short of rigorous demonstrations. On\nthe assumption that Leibniz remains committed to his early account of\nthe distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric, it follows that\neven the Monadologie, which has traditionally been taken to be\none of the definitive statements of Leibniz's mature metaphysics,\ncontains numerous exoteric features. As in the case of\nthe Système nouveau, Leibniz does not explicitly flag\nthe exoteric features of this work as exoteric. It is thus easy\nto mistake exoteric illustration for esoteric demonstration. \n\nBefore considering a few particular examples of exoteric strategies\nin the Monadologie (and other texts), we should incorporate\none of Leibniz's most revealing remarks about why his philosophy\nwas easy to misunderstand. In the letter to Hugony quoted in the\nprevious section Leibniz said that he needed to present his philosophy\nin an informal manner because it was likely to be misunderstood in\nrelation to the senses. This suggests that the tendency\npeople have to rely on a sensory-based theory of knowledge is one of\nthe primary stumbling blocks that prevent them from understanding his\nphilosophical system. Many of Leibniz's core concepts and\nprinciples can only be adequately grasped through the intellect, not\nthrough the senses or the imagination (see Leibniz's remarks on\nforce in De Ipsa Natura (G 4:508; AG:159)). One of\nLeibniz's main exoteric strategies for dealing with this\nsituation is to utilize sensible analogies,\nimaginative metaphors, anecdotes, and stories to introduce and\nmotivate his abstract concepts, principles, and theses. Such\nmetaphors and analogies enable his readers to attain an introductory\nunderstanding of the thesis or principle in question. Let us\nconsider a few examples. \n\nIn explaining the thesis that there is no inter-substantial\ncausation between finite substances in the Monadologie,\nLeibniz famously says: “monads have no windows through\nwhich something can enter or leave” (G 6:607; AG:214). This\nmetaphor of being “windowless” helps the reader attain some\nunderstanding of Leibniz's thesis, but it will be an imperfect\nunderstanding to the extent that it involves conceiving of monads as\nbeing extended.  \n\nLeibniz frequently uses imagistic metaphors to describe God's\nsustenance of finite substances. Late in the\nMonadologie, for example, he writes: “all created\nor derivative monads are generated, so to speak, by continual\nfulgurations of the divinity from moment to moment” (G 6:614;\nAG:219) And in the Essais de théodicée\nLeibniz uses the analogy of a heavy-laden boat travelling down a river\nto explain how God and finite substances can be said to co-operate in\nthe production of particular effects in the ordinary course of nature\n(T:30–1). Both the metaphor and the analogy provide useful but\nimperfect devices for conceiving of things that cannot be sensed or\nimagined, strictly speaking. In reading Leibniz's texts it\nis important to recognize that these are only metaphors and\nanalogies—they are not meant to provide metaphysically rigorous\ndescriptions of divine action.  \n\nLeibniz is committed to the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. This principle states, roughly, that it is\nimpossible for there to be two numerically distinct substances that are\nqualitatively identical. In discussing this principle Leibniz\nsometimes supports it by appealing to an anecdote and other empirical\nconsiderations. In the anecdote he recalls discussing the\nprinciple with an “ingenious gentleman” who thought he\ncould find two perfectly identical leaves. Princess Sophia, who\nwas observing the conversation, “defied him to do it; he ran all\nover the garden a long time to look for some but it was to no\npurpose” (4th letter to Clarke, G 7:372;\nAG:327–8). Leibniz also defends the principle by appealing to the\nempirical results of the microscopists: objects that can seem\nqualitatively identical to the naked eye (two drops of water, or two\ndrops of milk) are shown to be different when viewed under the\nmicroscope. Neither the anecdote nor the appeal to microscopes is\nintended to be anything like a rigorous proof of the principle of the\nidentity of indiscernibles. A rigorous proof would show how the\nprinciple is derived a priori from other principles such as\nthe principle of sufficient reason.  \n\nFew people are likely to interpret Leibniz's anecdote\nconcerning the principle of the identity of indiscernibles as a\nrigorous argument. Other cases are more easily misunderstood,\nhowever. Consider section 17 of the\nMonadologie:  \n\nIt is easy to see why this is one of the better-known passages in\nthe Monadologie. It contains a vivid imaginative thought\nexperiment that is presented in support of an anti-materialist\nconclusion, namely that perception is inexplicable by means of shapes\nand motions. Given that thought experiments along these lines\nhave been popular in contemporary philosophy of mind it might seem\nnatural to suppose that Leibniz takes the thought experiment to provide\na conclusive argument for his conclusion (it is sometimes referred to\nas “Leibniz's Mill Argument”). Although this is\nnot the place to discuss the issue at length, we can say that\nLeibniz's remarks on the exoteric/esoteric distinction suggest\nthat this might not be the case. It is plausible to think that\nthe passage is designed to appeal to people who rely heavily on the\nimagination in doing philosophy; it could be a heuristic that will help\nmotivate Leibniz's thesis that perception is a property of simple\nsubstances and not of bodies, not a rigorous argument for this\nconclusion .  \n\nAs the discussion of Leibniz's Mill Argument suggests, it is\nnot always easy to recognize when Leibniz is using an exoteric\nstrategy. Another place where an exoteric strategy might be at\nwork is in one of his most frequent “arguments” for the\ntheory of simple substances. Consider the first section of the\nPrincipes de la Nature et de la Grace and the first three\nsections of the Monadologie: \n[1] A substance is a being capable of action. It is\nsimple or composite. A simple substance is that which\nhas no parts. A composite substance is a collection\n[l'assemblage] of simple substances, or\nmonads. Monas is a Greek word signifying unity,\nor what is one. Composites or bodies are multitudes; and simple\nsubstances—lives, souls, and minds—are unities. There\nmust be simple substances everywhere, because, without simples, there\nwould be no composites (G 6:598; AG:207). \n[2] 1. The Monad, which we shall discuss here, is\nnothing but a simple substance that enters into\ncomposites—simple, that is, without parts. 2. And there\nmust be simple substances, since there are composites; for the\ncomposite is nothing more than a collection, or aggregate\n[un amas, ou aggregatum], of simples. 3. But where there\nare no parts, neither extension, nor shape, nor divisibility is\npossible. These monads are the true atoms of nature and, in\nbrief, the elements of things (G 6:607; AG:213). \n\nThese texts contain important similarities and differences. In\n[1] he speaks of “composite substances,” which he also\ndescribes as “bodies,” while in [2] he speaks only of\n“composites.” Setting these differences aside for the\nmoment, both texts contain a version of what has been termed the\n“grounding argument” for simple substances. Taken at\nface value, the texts suggests the following argument: \n\nThe reader seems invited in these passages (particularly in [1] and\nthe first two sections of [2]) to conceive of the relation between\nsimples and composites in a straightforward and intuitive way. If\nyou have a dozen eggs, for example, you must have twelve individual\neggs. Trying to argue that one could have a dozen eggs without\nhaving any individual eggs seems a hopeless task indeed. The\nargument also initially lends itself to a kind of physical\natomism. If one thinks that tables and chairs, for example, are\ncollections of indivisible physical atoms, then the argument is once\nagain intuitive and difficult to deny. It becomes clear in the\nthird section of text [2] that the relation between composite and\nsimple cannot be quite this straightforward because the simples are not\nextended. Leibniz also makes this point in the section that\nfollows [1] in the Principes de la Nature et de la\nGrace. But something like the intuitive picture\nremains. There are composites (bodies). Composites are\ncollections of simples. If you put a bunch of simples together\nyou get a composite. It is natural to think that the relation\nbetween simples and composites is understood on the model of part and\nwhole. Simples are the parts that compose wholes (bodies). \n\nLeibniz's considered view is far more nuanced and less\nstraightforward than texts [1] and [2] suggest. First, Leibniz\ndoes not think monads compose bodies in the manner of a part/whole\nrelation. As he explains elsewhere, a part of a whole must be\n“of the same sort” as the whole (G 3:591). Monads and\nbodies are not of the same sort because only the latter are\nextended. This implies that the parts of an extended body must\nthemselves be extended. Leibniz does assert on a number of\noccasions that bodies are aggregates of monads (or simple\nsubstances). However, he has a technical conception of an\naggregate (see Lodge 2001). Suppose, for example, that there were\na carton of twelve eggs sitting on a table. This alone would not\nimply that there was an aggregate of eggs, strictly speaking. For\nthere to be an aggregate of eggs there would need to be at least two\neggs that are perceived by a mind as being one thing (i.e., by\nperceiving them as a unity). So you cannot merely add together a\nbunch of eggs to get an aggregate of eggs. Similarly, you cannot\nmerely add together a bunch of monads to get an aggregate of\nmonads. You only have an aggregate if there is a mind that\nperceives the individuals as constituting one thing. The precise\ndetails of how one should understand Leibniz's claim that bodies\nare aggregates of monads is a matter of scholarly controversy that we\nneed not engage here. It will suffice to make the following\npoints. The fact that bodies are aggregates of monads implies\nthat bodies depend ontologically on monads but it does not imply that\nthe relation between monads and bodies is a part/whole relation.\n As Leibniz explains to de Volder, “properly speaking,\nmatter isn't composed of constitutive unities, but results from\nthem…substantial unities aren't really parts, but the\nfoundations of phenomena” (G 2:268; AG:179). \n\nOnce one becomes aware of Leibniz's technical notion of an\naggregate and of certain aspects of his conception of the part-whole\nrelation, it becomes less clear exactly how the “grounding\nargument” in texts [1] and [2] is supposed to work. The\nintuitive appeal of the argument seems to depend, at least in part, on\nassuming a straightforward account of the relation between bodies and\nmonads that Leibniz does not actually endorse. Leibniz seems to\nencourage this oversimplified account of the relation by omitting an\nexplanation of his notion of an aggregate and of his account of the\npart-whole relation, among other things. This suggests that\nLeibniz is not trying to provide a fully rigorous argument for the\nexistence of simple substances or a full explanation of the relation\nbetween monads and bodies in the Monadologie or the\nPrincipes de la Nature et de la Grace. What Leibniz is\ndoing, one might think, is helping his readers attain a preliminary\ngrasp of the relation between bodies and simple substances—to\nhelp them recognize that simple substances provide some kind of\nontological grounding for the world of bodies. By introducing the\nview in the form of a simple and intuitive argument Leibniz helps to\nmotivate the radical idea that an infinity of immaterial mind-like\nsimple substances exist. The reader will thus be more likely to\ntake the view seriously enough to consider the further elaborations of\nthe theory that are presented in the remainder of the texts. This\nis not to deny that Leibniz might have had a fully demonstrative\n“grounding argument” for the existence of simple\nsubstances, or that he wanted the fully demonstrative argument to be\nconsistent with the versions of the argument that are presented in\ntexts [1] and [2]. The point is that Leibniz omits too many\nessential distinctions and details for even a very discerning reader to\nbe able to reconstruct a demonstrative argument merely on the basis of\ntexts [2] or [3]. On this reading significant portions of the\nMonadologie and the Principes de la Nature et de la\nGrace are exoteric in content and form. They serve to\nintroduce some of the central features of Leibniz's metaphysics\nwhile omitting many important details (more details are omitted in the\nlatter text, as we will soon see).  \n\nLet us now consider one notable difference between the\nMonadologie and the Principes de la Nature et de la\nGrace. In the Principes de la Nature et de la Grace\nLeibniz speaks of “composite substances” while in the\nMonadologie he only speaks of “composites.” \nThe difference is puzzling. In the Monadologie Leibniz\nis typically taken to be presenting a strictly monadological\nmetaphysics according to which simple substances are the only finite\nsubstances. Bodies exist and animals exist, but they are not\nsubstances (roughly speaking he thinks that an animal is a dominant\nmonad and its organic body, which is itself an aggregate of\nmonads). A number of texts suggest that neither bodies nor\nanimals are true unities, and only a true unity (an unum per\nse) can qualify as a substance, strictly speaking. Any\nreality that bodies and animals possess is in some way derivative of\nthe reality of simple substances. The obvious puzzle is that\nLeibniz speaks of simple and composite substances in the\nPrincipes de la Nature et de la Grace. What are we to\nmake of these seemingly divergent claims? \n\nOne way of accounting for divergent claims in different texts is to\nsay that Leibniz had different views on the issue over time. \nThere is no question that Leibniz's views on substance changed to\nsome degree over the course of his career (exactly how much they\nchanged is one of the most contentious issues in Leibniz\nscholarship). However, the developmental strategy is more\ndifficult (though not impossible) to deploy in the present case because\nboth texts were written around the same time in 1714. Another\npossibility (suggested in the secondary literature) is that Leibniz is\nexploring different theories of substance at this point in his\ncareer. Though he is tempted by a strictly monadological\nmetaphysics (as presented in the Monadologie), he is also\nconsidering an ontology that countenances the existence of simple\nsubstances and corporeal substances (where corporeal substances are\n“animals” as described in the previous paragraph). \nLeibniz is laying out this latter theory in The Principes de la\nNature et de la Grace (see Hartz 2007). There are some\nprima facie reasons for resisting an interpretation along\nthese lines (though it cannot be conclusively ruled out). First,\nLeibniz does not describe himself as a “theory pluralist”\nwith respect to substance. As we have seen, Leibniz consistently\nrefers to his philosophy as a (single) system. This is one of the\nthings that make it amenable to the geometric model of\ndemonstration. When Leibniz addresses the fact that he has not\nunfolded his entire system in a single work, he emphasizes that this is\nnot because he has not thought the system all the way through. In\none of his less modest moments he writes to Burnett, for example: \n\nAnother place where Leibniz emphasizes the systematicity of his\nphilosophy is in his correspondence with Des Bosses: \nMy views certainly are connected with each other in such a way that\nno link can be removed without the chain's being broken. \nFrom the very consideration of possible worlds and God's choice,\nit follows both that he has chosen the best and that he has chosen it\nwith one decree, whose object, obviously, is the chosen world (October\n1708 letter to Des Bosses, LR 113). \n\nIf only the attribute of incomprehensibility were proper to God\nalone! Then, our hope of knowing nature would be greater. \nBut it is all too true that there is no part of nature that could be\nknown perfectly by us, and the very interconnection of things proves\nthis. No creature, however elevated, can perceive distinctly or\ncomprehend the infinite at the same time; but, on the contrary, whoever\ncomprehends even one part of matter likewise comprehends the whole\nuniverse on account of the same interconnection I mentioned. My\nprinciples are such that they can hardly be separated one from\nanother. Whoever knows one well, knows them all (7 November 1710\nletter to Des Bosses, LR:189). \n\nMore could be said about the context of these passages and exactly\nhow they should be interpreted. At the very least, however, these\ntexts do not suggest that Leibniz saw himself as unsure about which\ntheory of substance to endorse. That being said, Leibniz wrote a\nconsiderable amount on the theory of monads and bodies between 1710 and\n1714. Did Leibniz's views on substance evolve during those\nintervening years?  \n\nTo answer this question one would need to delve deeply into\nLeibniz's long and fascinating correspondence with Des Bosses (as\nwell as other texts). This is obviously not the place to provide\nsuch an investigation, but we can briefly summarize a standard\ninterpretation of one of the central moments of the correspondence (see\nLook and Rutherford's introduction to the Leibniz-Des Bosses\nCorrespondence, xlix-lxxviii). As a Jesuit priest, Des Bosses was\ninterested in determining whether Leibniz's philosophy could\nprovide an adequate ontological framework for the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation. The central point of contention in their\ndiscussion of this issue concerned the reality of corporeal\nsubstance. Did Leibnizian corporeal substances meet the criteria\nfor being a substance in the strict sense of the term? On a\nmonadological view a corporeal substance (or animal) is a dominant\nmonad united with an organic body, which is itself an aggregate of\nsubordinate monads. The “union” of a dominant monad\nand its organic body consists in certain harmonious perceptual\nrelations that obtain between the dominant monad and the subordinate\nmonads of the organic body. This rather weak notion of union is\nnot sufficient to make the dominant monad and its organic body truly\none being. This implies that a corporeal substance is not a\nsubstance strictly speaking because it does not possess per se\nunity. Des Bosses thought that this reductive view of corporeal\nsubstance did not provide a robust enough conception of the reality of\nbodies to properly ground the doctrine of transubstantiation. In\nresponse to Des Bosses' concerns Leibniz developed the notion of\na substantial bond (vinculum substantiale). This\nsubstantial bond (superadded by God) could serve as a kind of\nmetaphysical glue uniting the dominant monad and the subordinate monads\nof an organic body. Leibniz told Des Bosses that the only way for\na corporeal substance to be a per se unity would be through\none of these substantial bonds. Arguably, Leibniz did not endorse\nthe theory himself; he told Des Bosses that he preferred the more\nontologically parsimonious version of the theory of monads (letter of\n16 June 1712; LR:255).  \n\nThe correspondence with Des Bosses has thus been taken to provide\nsupport for the interpretive thesis that Leibniz's mature\nontology of finite substance countenances the existence of simple\nsubstances exclusively (but see Garber 2009 for an opposing\nview). The correspondence also shows, importantly, that the mere\noccurrence of the word “corporeal substance” in a text does\nnot immediately imply that Leibniz takes corporeal substances to be\nsubstances, strictly speaking. These conclusions might\nhelp resolve the apparent tension between Leibniz's remarks on\nsubstance in the Monadologie and the Principes de la\nNature et de la Grace. The text of the Monadologie\nmore accurately reflects Leibniz's considered position because it\nonly characterizes simple substances as “substances.” \nThe Principes de la Nature et de la Grace, in contrast, is\nless rigorous (more exoteric) because it uses the term “composite\nsubstance” when composites are not substances, strictly speaking\n(Rutherford 1995, 281–2).  \n\nBut why would Leibniz use a term like “composite\nsubstance” in the Principes de la Nature et de la Grace\nif it did not accurately reflect his considered position? Here is\none possible answer. In presenting his theory of simple\nsubstances Leibniz was concerned to avoid a fundamental\nmisunderstanding. The misunderstanding is that if the only\nsubstances are unextended simple substances, then bodies must be mere\nillusions. Leibniz does not think that bodies are mere\nillusions. His view of bodies (from the perspective of the theory\nof monads) is, roughly, that they are “real but not fully\nreal.” To adequately grasp Leibniz's view one must\nunderstand that his ontology countenances different levels or degrees\nof reality. Simplifying things considerably, these degrees range\nfrom the ideal (the least real) to the phenomenal (mid-grades of\nreality) to the level of monads (the most real). Bodies fall\nwithin the purview of the phenomenal: they are more real\nthan entities that are purely ideal (e.g., space) but less\nreal than simple substances. Bodies are accorded an enhanced\ndegree of reality (in comparison to merely ideal entities) because they\nare well founded on the reality of monads. The precise nature of\nthis “well founding”—and of Leibniz's\nontological scheme more generally—is a complicated and\ncontroversial matter. The nuanced framework (however one might\nfill in the details) does not lend itself to a straightforward and\nintuitive presentation in several paragraphs of text.  \n\nOne can reasonably view the Principes de la Nature et de la\nGrace as one of the most exoteric presentations of Leibniz's\ntheory of monads. In the text he omits nearly all of the details\nof his nuanced ontological scheme. He describes bodies as\n“composite substances” so that his reader will recognize\nthat both simple substances and bodies are “real.” By\noveremphasizing the degree of reality that he grants bodies he is able\nto introduce the theory of monads in a way that makes it appear less\nfar removed from received opinions. It also helps avoid the\nserious misunderstanding that bodies are mere illusions—a\nmisunderstanding that one could easily fall into in the absence of a\nfull presentation of Leibniz's ontological scheme.  \n\nThis very brief sketch of an “exoteric resolution” of\nthe textual discrepancy between Leibniz's use of the word\n“substance” in the Monadologie and the\nPrincipes de la Nature et de la Grace provides an alternative\nto the “developmental” and “two theory”\nreadings of the relevant passages mentioned earlier. It suggests\na more general moral for Leibniz scholarship. Whenever one is\nfaced with texts that appear to provide conflicting remarks on an\nissue, it is important to consider whether an exoteric strategy that\ncould resolve the apparent conflict might be at work. It is not\neasy to determine when an exoteric strategy is at work given that\nLeibniz rarely flags the features of his works that are exoteric within\nthe works themselves. One must consider Leibniz's general\nremarks on exoteric strategies along with any additional texts that\nexplicitly or implicitly bear on the passages in question. It is\nonly once all of these texts have been examined that one can argue that\na particular interpretive hypothesis is the best all things\nconsidered.  \n\nThroughout his career Leibniz distinguished between esoteric and\nexoteric modes of presentation in philosophy. He endorsed the\nesoteric mode, which was modeled closely on the Geometrical model of\ndemonstration, as the ideal mode of presentation. Leibniz did\nsome important preparatory work for an esoteric presentation of his\nmetaphysics in the 1670's and 1680's, but he never\ncompleted a work that was in strict accordance with the esoteric\nideal. Although he continued to regard the geometrical model of\ndemonstration as the ideal, he thought it would be a mistake to\nintroduce his philosophy to people in the form of an esoteric\ntreatise. This is because the content of his philosophy\nwas highly esoteric; it involved a range of abstract principles and\ntheses, many of which were far removed from received opinions. He\nthought that if he were to present his philosophy in a strictly\nesoteric manner people would misunderstand it and summarily reject\nit. This is why exoteric texts were so important for\nLeibniz. They were designed to serve as intellectual\nstepping-stones that could help readers move from received opinions to\nesoteric truth. In letters to trusted correspondents Leibniz\nexplicitly describes his journal articles and the Essais de\nthéodicée as exoteric works. But even\nLeibniz's letters to trusted correspondents such as de Volder and\nDes Bosses fall short of the esoteric ideal. All of\nLeibniz's texts are exoteric to a certain degree, but some are\nmore so than others. They can be categorized as more or less\nexoteric depending on the degree to which they approximate the esoteric\nideal in form and content. It is difficult to provide this\ncategorization given that Leibniz never completed a strictly esoteric\ntreatise. However, Leibniz's general comments about the\nexoteric mode of presentation can help us locate the implicitly\nexoteric features of his texts. We have seen that Leibniz\nutilized a variety of complimentary exoteric techniques, including: Selective omission:  he omits the features of\nhis philosophy that are furthest removed from received opinions. \nIn some cases it is possible to infer the omitted views from a careful\nreading of the exoteric text; in other cases a supplementary work is\nrequired. Surface reading vs. deep reading:  the text admits of\nan intuitive surface reading that can make his views seem closer to\nreceived opinions than they actually are. The texts are also\ncompatible with a more rigorous but less straightforward reading; it\nmay or may not be possible to grasp the deeper meaning on the basis of\nthe exoteric text alone.  Familiar language:  he tailors his language to\nhis audience so that it will appear more familiar to them. For\nexample, he uses Cartesian language when he writes in the journals of\nParis and the language of the schools when he writes in the journals of\nLeipzig. Eclectic references:  he appeals to the claims of\nwell-regarded historical and contemporary figures to illustrate and\nmotivate his own theses.  Hypothesis:  he presents a thesis as a\nhypothesis rather than providing a strict demonstration of the thesis,\neven if he is capable of providing the demonstration. He thinks\nthat in some cases a reader will be less hostile to a novel thesis if\nit is presented as a hypothesis. Sensible analogies, metaphors, imaginative thought\nexperiments, stories, and anecdotes: he utilizes these devices\nbecause they allow readers that are accustomed to conceiving of things\nby means of the senses and the imagination to attain an introductory\nunderstanding of theses and principles that are abstract and distinctly\nconceivable only through the intellect (not the senses or the\nimagination).  \n\nSome work identifying particular exoteric strategies has been done\nin the secondary literature on Leibniz. However, much work\nremains to be done. More detailed examinations of the exoteric\nfeatures of Leibniz's works will help us more adequately\ndetermine which texts (if any) present his considered views and the\nextent to which his philosophy is systematic.
