Snyder","author1.info":"http://laurajsnyder.com/","entry":"whewell","body.text":"\n\n\nWilliam Whewell (1794–1866) was one of the most important and\ninfluential figures in nineteenth-century Britain. Whewell, a\npolymath, wrote extensively on numerous subjects, including mechanics,\nmineralogy, geology, astronomy, political economy, theology,\neducational reform, international law, and architecture, as well as\nthe works that remain the most well-known today in philosophy of\nscience, history of science, and moral philosophy. He was one of the\nfounding members and a president of the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, a fellow of the Royal Society, president of\nthe Geological Society, and longtime Master of Trinity College,\nCambridge. In his own time his influence was acknowledged by the major\nscientists of the day, such as John Herschel, Charles Darwin, Charles\nLyell and Michael Faraday, who frequently turned to Whewell for\nphilosophical and scientific advice, and, interestingly, for\nterminological assistance. Whewell invented the terms\n“anode,” “cathode,” and “ion” for\nFaraday. In response to a challenge by the poet S.T. Coleridge in\n1833, Whewell invented the English word “scientist;”\nbefore this time the only terms in use were “natural\nphilosopher” and “man of science”. Whewell was\ngreatly influenced by his association with three of his fellow\nstudents at Cambridge: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, and Richard\nJones. Over the winter of 1812 and spring of 1813, the four met for\nwhat they called “Philosophical Breakfasts” at which they\ndiscussed induction and scientific method, among other topics (see\nSnyder 2011).\n\n\nWhewell is most known today for his extensive works on the history and\nphilosophy of science. His philosophy of science was attacked by John\nStuart Mill in his System of Logic, causing an interesting\nand fruitful debate between them over the nature of inductive\nreasoning in science, moral philosophy, and political economy (for a\ndetailed discussion of this debate, see Snyder 2006). It is in the\ncontext of the debate over philosophy of science that Whewell’s\nphilosophy was rediscovered in the 20th century by critics of logical\npositivism. In this entry, I will focus on the most important\nphilosophical aspects of Whewell’s works: his philosophy of\nscience, including his views of induction, confirmation, and necessary\ntruth; his view of the relation between scientific practice, history\nof science, and philosophy of science; and his moral philosophy. His\nview of induction is the most interesting and important part of his\nphilosophy as well as the most often misinterpreted.\n\nWhewell was born in 1794, the eldest child of a master-carpenter in\nLancaster. The headmaster of his local grammar school, a parish\npriest, recognized Whewell’s intellectual abilities and\npersuaded his father to allow him to attend the Heversham Grammar\nSchool in Westmorland, some twelve miles to the north, where he would\nbe able to qualify for a closed exhibition to Trinity College,\nCambridge. In the 19th century and earlier, these “closed\nexhibitions” or scholarships were set aside for the children of\nworking class parents, to allow for some social mobility. Whewell\nstudied at Heversham Grammar for two years, and received private\ncoaching in mathematics. Although he did win the exhibition it did not\nprovide full resources for a boy of his family’s means to attend\nCambridge; so money had to be raised in a public subscription to\nsupplement the scholarship money. \nHe thus came up to Trinity in 1812 as a “sub-sizar”\n(scholarship student). In 1814 he won the Chancellor’s prize for\nhis epic poem “Boadicea,” in this way following in the\nfootsteps of his mother, who had published poems in the local papers.\nYet he did not neglect the mathematical side of his training; in 1816\nhe proved his mathematical prowess by placing as both second Wrangler\nand second Smith’s Prize man. The following year he won a\ncollege fellowship. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1820, and\nordained a priest (as required for Trinity Fellows) in 1825. He took\nup the Chair in Mineralogy in 1828, and resigned it in 1832. In 1838\nWhewell became Professor of Moral Philosophy. Almost immediately after\nhis marriage to Cordelia Marshall on 12 October 1841, he was named\nMaster of Trinity College upon the recommendation of the Prime\nMinister Robert Peel. He was Vice-Chancellor of the University in 1842\nand again in 1855. In 1848 he played a large role in establishing the\nNatural and Moral Sciences Triposes at the University. His first wife\ndied in 1855, and he remarried Lady Affleck, the sister of his friend\nRobert Ellis; Lady Affleck died in 1865. Whewell had no children. He\ndied, after being thrown from his horse, on 6 March 1866. (More\ndetails about Whewell’s life and times can be found in Snyder\n2011.)  \nAccording to Whewell, all knowledge has both an ideal, or subjective\ndimension, as well as an objective dimension. He called this the\n“fundamental antithesis” of knowledge. Whewell explained\nthat “in every act of knowledge … there are two opposite\nelements, which we may call Ideas and Perceptions” (1860a, 307).\nHe criticized Kant and the German Idealists for their exclusive focus\non the ideal or subjective element, and Locke and the\n“Sensationalist School” for their exclusive focus on the\nempirical, objective element. Like Francis Bacon, Whewell claimed to\nbe seeking a “middle way” between pure rationalism and\nultra-empiricism. Whewell believed that gaining knowledge requires\nattention to both ideal and empirical elements, to ideas as well as\nsensations. These ideas, which he called “Fundamental\nIdeas,” are “supplied by the mind itself”—they\nare not (as Mill and Herschel protested) merely received from our\nobservations of the world. Whewell explained that the Fundamental\nIdeas are “not a consequence of experience, but a result of the\nparticular constitution and activity of the mind, which is independent\nof all experience in its origin, though constantly combined with\nexperience in its exercise” (1858a, I, 91). Consequently, the\nmind is an active participant in our attempts to gain knowledge of the\nworld, not merely a passive recipient of sense data. Ideas such as\nSpace, Time, Cause, and Resemblance provide a structure or form for\nthe multitude of sensations we experience. The Ideas provide a\nstructure by expressing the general relations that exist between our\nsensations (1847, I, 25). Thus, the Idea of Space allows us to\napprehend objects as having form, magnitude, and position. Whewell\nheld, then, that observation is “idea-laden;” all\nobservation, he noted, involves “unconscious inference”\nusing the Fundamental Ideas (see 1858a, I, 46). Each science has a\nParticular Fundamental idea which is needed to organize the facts with\nwhich that science is concerned; thus, Space is the Fundamental Idea\nof geometry, Cause the Fundamental Idea of mechanics, and Substance\nthe Fundamental Idea of chemistry. Moreover, Whewell explained that\neach Fundamental Idea has certain “conceptions” included\nwithin it; these conceptions are “special modifications”\nof the Idea applied to particular types of circumstances (1858b, 187).\nFor example, the conception of force is a modification of the Idea of\nCause, applied to the particular case of motion (see 1858a, I,\n184–5 and 236). \nThus far, this discussion of the Fundamental Ideas may suggest that\nthey are similar to Kant’s forms of intuition, and indeed there\nare some similarities. Because of this, some commentators argue that\nWhewell’s epistemology is a type of Kantianism (see, for\nexample, Butts 1973; Buchdahl 1991). However, this interpretation\nignores several crucial differences between the two views. Whewell did\nnot follow Kant in drawing a distinction between\n“precepts,” or forms of intuition, such as Space and Time,\nand the categories, or forms of thought, in which Kant included the\nconcepts of Cause and Substance. Moreover, Whewell included as\nFundamental Ideas many ideas which function not as conditions of\nexperience but as conditions for having knowledge within their\nrespective sciences: although it is certainly possible to have\nexperience of the world without having a distinct idea of, say,\nChemical Affinity, we could not have any knowledge of certain chemical\nprocesses without it. Unlike Kant, Whewell did not attempt to give an\nexhaustive list of these Fundamental Ideas; indeed, he believed that\nthere are others which will emerge in the course of the development of\nscience. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly for his philosophy of\nscience, Whewell rejected Kant’s claim that we can only have\nknowledge of our “categorized experience.” The Fundamental\nIdeas, on Whewell’s view, accurately represent objective\nfeatures of the world, independent of the processes of the mind, and\nwe can use these Ideas in order to have knowledge of these objective\nfeatures. Indeed, Whewell criticized Kant for viewing external reality\nas a “dim and unknown region” (see 1860a, 312). Further,\nWhewell’s justification for the presence of these concepts in\nour minds takes a very different form than Kant’s transcendental\nargument. For Kant, the categories are justified because they make\nexperience possible. For Whewell, though the categories do\nmake experience (of certain kinds) possible, the Ideas are justified\nby their origin in the mind of a divine creator (see especially his\ndiscussion of this in his 1860a). And finally, the type of necessity\nwhich Whewell claimed is derived from the Ideas is very different from\nKant’s notion of the synthetic a priori (For a recent\nand more nuanced view of the relation between the views of Kant and\nWhewell, see Ducheyne 2011.) I return to these last two points in the\nsection on Necessary Truth below. \nI turn now to a discussion of the theory of induction Whewell\ndeveloped with his antithetical epistemology. From his earliest\nthoughts about scientific method, Whewell was interested in developing\nan inductive theory. At their philosophical breakfasts at Cambridge,\nWhewell, Babbage, Herschel and Jones discussed how science had\nstagnated since the heady days of the Scientific Revolution in the\n17th century. It was time for a new revolution, which they pledged to\nbring about. The cornerstone of this new revolution was to be the\npromotion of a Baconian-type of induction, and all four men began\ntheir careers endorsing an inductive scientific method against the\ndeductive method being advanced by David Ricardo and his followers\n(see Snyder 2011). (Although the four agreed about the importance of\nan inductive scientific method, Whewell’s version was one that\nHerschel and Jones would later take issue with, primarily because of\nhis antithetical epistemology.) \nWhewell’s first explicit, lengthy discussion of induction is\nfound in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, founded upon\ntheir History, which was originally published in 1840 (a second,\nenlarged edition appeared in 1847, and the third edition appeared as\nthree separate works published between 1858 and 1860). He called his\ninduction “Discoverers’ Induction” and explained\nthat it is used to discover both phenomenal and causal laws. Whewell\nconsidered himself to be a follower of Bacon, and claimed to be\n“renovating” Bacon’s inductive method; thus one\nvolume of the third edition of the Philosophy is entitled\nNovum Organon Renovatum. Whewell followed Bacon in rejecting\nthe standard, overly-narrow notion of induction that holds induction\nto be merely simple enumeration of instances. Rather, Whewell\nexplained that, in induction, “there is a New Element added to\nthe combination [of instances] by the very act of thought by which\nthey were combined” (1847, II, 48). This “act of\nthought” is a process Whewell called “colligation.”\nColligation, according to Whewell, is the mental operation of bringing\ntogether a number of empirical facts by “superinducing”\nupon them a conception which unites the facts and renders them capable\nof being expressed by a general law. The conception thus provides the\n“true bond of Unity by which the phenomena are held\ntogether” (1847, II, 46), by providing a property shared by the\nknown members of a class (in the case of causal laws, the colligating\nproperty is that of sharing the same cause). \nThus the known points of the Martian orbit were colligated by Kepler\nusing the conception of an elliptical curve. Often new discoveries are\nmade, Whewell pointed out, not when new facts are discovered but when\nthe appropriate conception is applied to the facts. In the case of\nKepler’s discovery, the observed points of the orbit were known\nto Tycho Brahe, but only when Kepler applied the ellipse conception\nwas the true path of the orbit discovered. Kepler was the first one to\napply this conception to an orbital path in part because he had, in\nhis mind, a very clear notion of the conception of an ellipse. This is\nimportant because the fundamental ideas and conceptions are provided\nby our minds, but they cannot be used in their innate form. Whewell\nexplained that “the Ideas, the germs of them at least, were in\nthe human mind before [experience]; but by the progress of scientific\nthought they are unfolded into clearness and distinctness”\n(1860a, 373). Whewell referred to this “unfolding” of\nideas and conceptions as the “explication of conceptions.”\nExplication is a necessary precondition to discovery, and it consists\nin a partly empirical, partly rational process. Scientists first try\nto clarify and make explicit a conception in their minds, then attempt\nto apply it to the facts they have precisely examined, to determine\nwhether the conception can colligate the facts into a law. If not, the\nscientist uses this experience to attempt a further refinement of the\nconception. Whewell claimed that a large part of the history of\nscience is the “history of scientific ideas,” that is, the\nhistory of their explication and subsequent use as colligating\nconcepts. Thus, in the case of Kepler’s use of the ellipse\nconception, Whewell noted that “to supply this conception,\nrequired a special preparation, and a special activity in the mind of\nthe discoverer. … To discover such a connection, the mind must\nbe conversant with certain relations of space, and with certain kinds\nof figures” (1849, 28–9). \nOnce conceptions have been explicated, it is possible to choose the\nappropriate conception with which to colligate phenomena. But how is\nthe appropriate conception chosen? According to Whewell, it is not a\nmatter of guesswork. Nor, importantly, is it merely a matter of\nobservation. Whewell explained that “there is a special process\nin the mind, in addition to the mere observation of facts, which is\nnecessary” (1849, 40). This “special process in the\nmind” is a process of inference. “We infer more than we\nsee,” Whewell claimed (1858a, I, 46). Typically, finding the\nappropriate conception with which to colligate a class of phenomena\nrequires a series of inferences, thus Whewell noted that\ndiscoverers’s induction is a process involving a “train of\nresearches” (1857/1873, I, 297). He allows any type of inference\nin the colligation, including enumerative, eliminative and analogical.\nThus Kepler in his Astronomia Nova (1609) can be seen as\nusing various forms of inference to reach the ellipse conception (see\nSnyder 1997a). When Augustus DeMorgan complained, in his 1847 logic\ntext, about certain writers using the term “induction” as\nincluding “the use of the whole box of [logical] tools,”\nhe was undoubtedly referring to his teacher and friend Whewell (see\nSnyder 2008). \nAfter the known members of a class are colligated with the use of a\nconception, the second step of Whewell’s discoverers’\ninduction occurs: namely, the generalization of the shared property\nover the complete class, including its unknown members. Often, as\nWhewell admitted, this is a trivially simple procedure. Once Kepler\nsupplied the conception of an ellipse to the observed members of the\nclass of Mars’ positions, he generalized it to all members of\nthe class, including those which were unknown (unobserved), to reach\nthe conclusion that “all the points of Mars’ orbit lie on\nan ellipse with the sun at one focus.” He then performed a\nfurther generalization to reach his first law of planetary motion:\n“the orbits of all the planets lie on ellipses with the sun at\none focus.” \nI mentioned earlier that Whewell thought of himself as renovating\nBacon’s inductive philosophy. His inductivism does share\nnumerous features with Bacon’s method of interpreting nature:\nfor instance the claims that induction must involve more than merely\nsimple enumeration of instances, that science must proceed by\nsuccessive steps of generalization, that inductive science can reach\nunobservables (for Bacon, the “forms,” for Whewell,\nunobservable entities such as light waves or properties such as\nelliptical orbits or gravitational forces). (For more on the relation\nbetween Whewell and Bacon see Snyder 2006; McCaskey 2014.) Yet,\nsurprisingly, the received view of Whewell’s methodology in the\n20th century has tended to describe Whewell as an anti-inductivist in\nthe Popperian mold (see, for example, Ruse 1975; Niiniluoto 1977;\nLaudan 1980; Butts 1987; Buchdahl 1991). That is, it is claimed that\nWhewell endorses a “conjectures and refutations” view of\nscientific discovery. However, it is clear from the above discussion\nthat his view of discoverers’ induction does not resemble the\nview asserting that hypotheses can be and are typically arrived at by\nmere guesswork. Moreover, Whewell explicitly rejects the\nhypothetico-deductive claim that hypotheses discovered by non-rational\nguesswork can be confirmed by consequentialist testing. For example,\nin his review of his friend Herschel’s Preliminary Discourse\non the Study of Natural Philosophy, Whewell argued, against\nHerschel, that verification is not possible when a hypothesis has been\nformed non-inductively (1831, 400–1). Nearly thirty years later,\nin the last edition of the Philosophy, Whewell referred to\nthe belief that “the discovery of laws and causes of phenomena\nis a loose hap-hazard sort of guessing,” and claimed that this\ntype of view “appears to me to be a misapprehension of the whole\nnature of science” (1860a, 274). In other mature works he noted\nthat discoveries are made “not by any capricious conjecture of\narbitrary selection” (1858a, I, 29) and explained that new\nhypotheses are properly “collected from the facts” (1849,\n17). In fact, Whewell was criticized by David Brewster for\nnot agreeing that discoveries, including Newton’s\ndiscovery of the universal gravitation law, were typically made by\naccident. \nWhy has Whewell been misinterpreted by so many modern commentators?\nOne reason has to do with the error of reading certain terms used by\nWhewell in the 19th century as if they held the same meaning they have\nin the 20th and 21st. Thus, since Whewell used the terms\n“conjectures” and “guesses,” we are told that\nhe shares Popper’s methodology. Whewell made mention, for\ninstance, of the “happy guesses” made by scientists\n(1858b, 64) and claimed that “advances in knowledge” often\nfollow “the previous exercise of some boldness and license in\nguessing” (1847, II, 55). But Whewell often used these terms in\na way which connotes a conclusion which is simply not conclusively\nconfirmed. The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that prior\nto the 20th century the term “conjecture” was used to\nconnote not a hypothesis reached by non-rational means, but rather one\nwhich is “unverified,” or which is “a conclusion as\nto what is likely or probable” (as opposed to the results of\ndemonstration). The term was used this way by Bacon, Kepler, Newton,\nand Dugald Stewart, writers whose work was well-known to Whewell. In\nother places where Whewell used the term “conjecture” he\nsuggests that what appears to be the result of guesswork is actually\nwhat we might call an “educated guess,” i.e., a conclusion\ndrawn by (weak) inference. Whewell described Kepler’s discovery,\nwhich seems so “capricious and fanciful” as actually being\n“regulated” by his “clear scientific ideas”\n(1857/1873, I, 291–2). Finally Whewell’s use of the\nterminology of guessing sometimes occurs in the context of a\ndistinction he draws between the generation of a number of possible\nconceptions, and the selection of one to superinduce upon the facts.\nBefore the appropriate conception is found, the scientist must be able\nto call up in his mind a number of possible ones (see 1858b, 79).\nWhewell noted that this calling up of many possibilities “is, in\nsome measure, a process of conjecture.” However, selecting the\nappropriate conception with which to colligate the data is not\nconjectural (1858b, 78). Thus Whewell claimed that the selection of\nthe conception is often “preluded by guesses”\n(1858b, xix); he does not, that is, claim that the selection\nconsists in guesswork. When inference is not used to select\nthe appropriate conception, the resulting theory is not an\n“induction,” but rather a “hasty and imperfect\nhypothesis.” He drew such a distinction between\nCopernicus’ heliocentric theory, which he called an induction,\nand the heliocentric system proposed by Aristarchus in the third\ncentury b.c., to which he referred as a hasty and imperfect hypothesis\n(1857/1873, I, 258). \nThus Whewell’s philosophy of science cannot be described as the\nhypothetico-deductive view. It is an inductive method; yet it clearly\ndiffers from the more narrow inductivism of Mill. Whewell’s view\nof induction has the advantage over Mill’s of allowing the\ninference to unobservable properties and entities. (For more detailed\narguments against reading Whewell as a hypothetico-deductivist, see\nSnyder 2006; Snyder 2008; McCaskey 2014). \nOn Whewell’s view, once a theory is invented by\ndiscoverers’ induction, it must pass a variety of tests before\nit can be considered confirmed as an empirical truth. These tests are\nprediction, consilience, and coherence (see 1858b, 83–96). These\nare characterized by Whewell as, first, that “our hypotheses\nought to fortel [sic] phenomena which have not yet been\nobserved” (1858b, 86); second, that they should “explain\nand determine cases of a kind different from those which were\ncontemplated in the formation” of those hypotheses (1858b, 88);\nand third that hypotheses must “become more coherent” over\ntime (1858b, 91). \nI start by discussing the criterion of prediction. Hypotheses ought to\nforetell phenomena, “at least all phenomena of the same\nkind,” Whewell explained, because “our assent to the\nhypothesis implies that it is held to be true of all particular\ninstances. That these cases belong to past or to future times, that\nthey have or have not already occurred, makes no difference in the\napplicability of the rule to them. Because the rule prevails, it\nincludes all cases” (1858b, 86). Whewell’s point here is\nsimply that since our hypotheses are in universal form, a true\nhypothesis will cover all particular instances of the rule, including\npast, present, and future cases. But he also makes the stronger claim\nthat successful predictions of unknown facts provide greater\nconfirmatory value than explanations of already-known facts. Thus he\nheld the historical claim that “new evidence” is more\nvaluable than “old evidence.” He believed that “to\npredict unknown facts found afterwards to be true is … a\nconfirmation of a theory which in impressiveness and value goes beyond\nany explanation of known facts” (1857/1873, II, 557). Whewell\nclaimed that the agreement of the prediction with what occurs (i.e.,\nthe fact that the prediction turns out to be correct), is\n“nothing strange, if the theory be true, but quite\nunaccountable, if it be not” (1860a, 273–4). For example,\nif Newtonian theory were not true, he argued, the fact that from the\ntheory we could correctly predict the existence, location and mass of\na new planet, Neptune (as did happen in 1846), would be bewildering,\nand indeed miraculous. \nAn even more valuable confirmation criterion, according to Whewell, is\nthat of “consilience.” Whewell explained that “the\nevidence in favour of our induction is of a much higher and more\nforcible character when it enables us to explain and determine [i.e.,\npredict] cases of a kind different from those which were\ncontemplated in the formation of our hypothesis. The instances in\nwhich this have occurred, indeed, impress us with a conviction that\nthe truth of our hypothesis is certain” (1858b, 87–8).\nWhewell called this type of evidence a “jumping together”\nor “consilience” of inductions. An induction, which\nresults from the colligation of one class of facts, is found also to\ncolligate successfully facts belonging to another class.\nWhewell’s notion of consilience is thus related to his view of\nnatural classes of objects or events. \nTo understand this confirmation criterion, it may be helpful to\nschematize the “jumping together” that occurred in the\ncase of Newton’s law of universal gravitation, Whewell’s\nexemplary case of consilience. On Whewell’s view, Newton used\nthe form of inference Whewell characterized as\n“discoverers’ induction” in order to reach his\nuniversal gravitation law, the inverse-square law of attraction. Part\nof this process is portrayed in book III of the Principia,\nwhere Newton listed a number of “propositions.” These\npropositions are empirical laws that are inferred from certain\n“phenomena” (which are described in the preceding section\nof book III). The first such proposition or law is that “the\nforces by which the circumjovial planets are continually drawn off\nfrom rectilinear motions, and retained in their proper orbits, tend to\nJupiter’s centre; and are inversely as the squares of the\ndistances of the places of those planets from that centre.” The\nresult of another, separate induction from the phenomena of\n“planetary motion” is that “the forces by which the\nprimary planets are continually drawn off from rectilinear motions,\nand retained in their proper orbits, tend to the sun; and are\ninversely as the squares of the distances of the places of those\nplanets from the sun’s centre.” Newton saw that these\nlaws, as well as other results of a number of different inductions,\ncoincided in postulating the existence of an inverse-square attractive\nforce as the cause of various classes of phenomena. According to\nWhewell, Newton saw that these inductions “leap to the same\npoint;” i.e., to the same law. Newton was then able to bring\ntogether inductively (or “colligate”) these laws, and\nfacts of other kinds of events (e.g., the class of events known as\n“falling bodies”), into a new, more general law, namely\nthe universal gravitation law: “All bodies attract each other\nwith a force of gravity which is inverse as the squares of the\ndistances.” By seeing that an inverse-square attractive force\nprovided a cause for different classes of events—for satellite\nmotion, planetary motion, and falling bodies—Newton was able to\nperform a more general induction, to his universal law. \nWhat Newton found was that these different kinds of\nphenomena—including circumjovial orbits, planetary orbits, as\nwell as falling bodies—share an essential property, namely the\nsame cause. What Newton did, in effect, was to subsume these\nindividual “event kinds” into a more general natural kind\ncomprised of sub-kinds sharing a kind essence, namely being caused by\nan inverse-square attractive force. Consilience of event kinds\ntherefore results in causal unification. More specifically,\nit results in unification of natural kind categories based on a shared\ncause. Phenomena that constitute different event kinds, such as\n“planetary motion,” “tidal activity,” and\n“falling bodies,” were found by Newton to be members of a\nunified, more general kind, “phenomena caused to occur by an\ninverse-square attractive force of gravity” (or,\n“gravitational phenomena”). In such cases, according to\nWhewell, we learn that we have found a “vera causa,” or a\n“true cause,” i.e., a cause that really exists in nature,\nand whose effects are members of the same natural kind (see 1860a, p.\n191). Moreover, by finding a cause shared by phenomena in different\nsub-kinds, we are able to colligate all the facts about these kinds\ninto a more general causal law. Whewell claimed that “when the\ntheory, by the concurrences of two indications … has included a\nnew range of phenomena, we have, in fact, a new induction of a more\ngeneral kind, to which the inductions formerly obtained are\nsubordinate, as particular cases to a general population”\n(1858b, 96). He noted that consilience is the means by which we effect\nthe successive generalization that constitutes the advancement of\nscience (1847, II, 74). (For more on consilience and its relation to\nrealism, see Snyder 2005 and Snyder 2006. On consilience and\nclassification, see Quinn, 2017. For more on Whewell and scientific\nkinds, see Cowles 2016.) \nWhewell discussed a further, related test of a theory’s truth:\nnamely, “coherence.” In the case of true theories, Whewell\nclaimed, “the system becomes more coherent as it is further\nextended. The elements which we require for explaining a new class of\nfacts are already contained in our system….In false theories,\nthe contrary is the case” (1858b, 91). Coherence occurs when we\nare able to extend our hypothesis to colligate a new class of\nphenomena without ad hoc modification of the hypothesis. When Newton\nextended his theory regarding an inverse-square attractive force,\nwhich colligated facts of planetary motion and lunar motion, to the\nclass of “tidal activity,” he did not need to add any new\nsuppositions to the theory in order to colligate correctly the facts\nabout particular tides. On the other hand, Whewell explained, when\nphlogiston theory, which colligated facts about the class of phenomena\n“chemical combination,” was extended to colligate the\nclass of phenomena “weight of bodies,” it was\nunable to do so without an ad hoc and implausible\nmodification (namely, the assumption that phlogiston has\n“negative weight”) (see 1858b, 92–3). Thus coherence\ncan be seen as a type of consilience that happens over time; indeed,\nWhewell remarked that these two criteria—consilience and\ncoherence—“are, in fact, hardly different” (1858b,\n95). \nA particularly intriguing aspect of Whewell’s philosophy of\nscience is his claim that empirical science can reach necessary\ntruths. Explaining this apparently contradictory claim was considered\nby Whewell to be the “ultimate problem” of philosophy\n(Morrison 1997). Whewell explained it by reference to his antithetical\nepistemology. Necessary truths are truths which can be known a\npriori; they can be known in this way because they are necessary\nconsequences of ideas which are a priori. They are necessary\nconsequences in the sense of being analytic consequences. Whewell\nexplicitly rejected Kant’s claim that necessary truths are\nsynthetic. Using the example “7 + 8 = 15,” Whewell claimed\nthat “we refer to our conceptions of seven, of eight, and of\naddition, and as soon as we possess the conceptions distinctly, we see\nthat the sum must be 15.” That is, merely by knowing the\nmeanings of “seven,” and “eight,” and\n“addition,” we see that it follows necessarily that\n“7 + 8 = 15” (1848, 471). \nOnce the Ideas and conceptions are explicated, so that we understand\ntheir meanings, the necessary truths which follow from them are seen\nas being necessarily true. Thus, once the Idea of Space is explicated,\nit is seen to be necessarily true that “two straight lines\ncannot enclose a space.” Whewell suggested that the first law of\nmotion is also a necessary truth, which was knowable a priori\nonce the Idea of Cause and the associated conception of force were\nexplicated. This is why empirical science is needed to see necessary\ntruths: because, as we saw above, empirical science is needed in order\nto explicate the Ideas. Thus Whewell also claimed that, in the course\nof science, truths which at first required experiment to be known are\nseen to be capable of being known independently of experiment. That\nis, once the relevant Idea is clarified, the necessary connection\nbetween the Idea and an empirical truth becomes apparent. Whewell\nexplained that “though the discovery of the First Law of Motion\nwas made, historically speaking, by means of experiment, we have now\nattained a point of view in which we see that it might have been\ncertainly known to be true independently of experience” (1847,\nI, 221). Science, then, consists in the “idealization of\nfacts,” the transferring of truths from the empirical to the\nideal side of the fundamental antithesis. He described this process as\nthe “progressive intuition of necessary truths.” \nAlthough they follow analytically from the meanings of ideas our minds\nsupply, necessary truths are nevertheless informative statements about\nthe physical world outside us; they have empirical content.\nWhewell’s justification for this claim is a theological one.\nWhewell noted that God created the universe in accordance with certain\n“Divine Ideas.” That is, all objects and events in the\nworld were created by God to conform to certain of his ideas. For\nexample, God made the world such that it corresponds to the idea of\nCause partially expressed by the axiom “every event has a\ncause.” Hence in the universe every event conforms to this idea,\nnot only by having a cause but by being such that it could not occur\nwithout a cause. On Whewell’s view, we are able to have\nknowledge of the world because the Fundamental Ideas which are used to\norganize our sciences resemble the ideas used by God in his creation\nof the physical world. The fact that this is so is no coincidence: God\nhas created our minds such that they contain these same ideas. That\nis, God has given us our ideas (or, rather, the “germs” of\nthe ideas) so that “they can and must agree with the\nworld” (1860a, 359). God intends that we can have knowledge of\nthe physical world, and this is possible only through the use of ideas\nwhich resemble those that were used in creating the world. Hence with\nour ideas—once they are properly “unfolded” and\nexplicated—we can colligate correctly the facts of the world and\nform true theories. And when these ideas are distinct, we can know\na priori the axioms which express their meaning.  \nAn interesting consequence of this interpretation of Whewell’s\nview of necessity is that every law of nature is a necessary truth, in\nvirtue of following analytically from some idea used by God in\ncreating the world. Whewell drew no distinction between truths which\ncan be idealized and those which cannot; thus, potentially, any\nempirical truth can be seen to be a necessary truth, once the ideas\nand conceptions are explicated sufficiently. For example, Whewell\nsuggests that experiential truths such as “salt is\nsoluble” may be necessary truths, even if we do not recognize\nthis necessity (i.e., even if it is not yet knowable a\npriori) (1860b, 483). Whewell’s view thus destroys the line\ntraditionally drawn between laws of nature and the axiomatic\npropositions of the pure sciences of mathematics; mathematical truth\nis granted no special status. \nIn this way Whewell suggested a view of scientific understanding which\nis, perhaps not surprisingly, grounded in his conception of natural\ntheology. Since our ideas are “shadows” of the Divine\nIdeas, to see a law as a necessary consequence of our ideas is to see\nit as a consequence of the Divine Ideas exemplified in the world.\nUnderstanding involves seeing a law as being not an arbitrary\n“accident on the cosmic scale,” but as a necessary\nconsequence of the ideas God used in creating the universe. Hence the\nmore we idealize the facts, the more difficult it will be to deny\nGod’s existence. We will come to see more and more truths as the\nintelligible result of intentional design. This view is related to the\nclaim Whewell had earlier made in his Bridgewater Treatise (1833),\nthat the more we study the laws of nature the more convinced we will\nbe in the existence of a Divine Law-giver. (For more on\nWhewell’s notion of necessity, see Fisch 1985; Snyder 1994;\nMorrison 1997; Snyder 2006; Ducheyne 2009.) \nAn issue of interest to philosophers of science today is the relation\nbetween knowledge of the actual practice and history of science and\nwriting a philosophy of science. Whewell is interesting to examine in\nrelation to this issue because he claimed to be inferring his\nphilosophy of science from his study of the history and practice of\nscience. His large-scale History of the Inductive Sciences\n(first edition published 1837) was a survey of science from ancient to\nmodern times. He insisted upon completing this work before writing his\nPhilosophy of the Inductive Sciences, founded upon their\nhistory. Moreover, Whewell sent proof-sheets of the\nHistory to his many scientist-friends to ensure the accuracy\nof his accounts. Besides knowing about the history of science, Whewell\nhad first-hand knowledge of scientific practice: he was actively\ninvolved in science in several important ways. In 1825 he traveled to\nBerlin and Vienna to study mineralogy and crystallography with Mohs\nand other acknowledged masters of the field. He published numerous\npapers in the field, as well as a monograph, and is still credited\nwith making important contributions to giving a mathematical\nfoundation to crystallography. He also made contributions to the\nscience of tidal research, pushing for a large-scale world-wide\nproject of tidal observations; he won a Royal Society gold medal for\nthis accomplishment. (For more on Whewell’s contributions to\nscience, see Becher 1986; Ruse 1991; Ducheyne 2010a; Snyder 2011).\nWhewell acted as a terminological consultant for Faraday and other\nscientists, who wrote to him asking for new words. Whewell only\nprovided terminology when he believed he was fully knowledgeable about\nthe science involved. In his section on the “Language of\nScience” in the Philosophy, Whewell makes this position\nclear (see 1858b, p. 293). Another interesting aspect of his\nintercourse with scientists becomes clear in reading his\ncorrespondence with them: namely, that Whewell constantly pushed\nFaraday, Forbes, Lubbock and others to perform certain experiments,\nmake specific observations, and to try to connect their findings in\nways of interest to Whewell. In all these ways, Whewell indicated that\nhe had a deep understanding of the activity of science. \nSo how is this important for his work on the philosophy of science?\nSome commentators have claimed that Whewell developed an a\npriori philosophy of science and then shaped his History\nto conform to his own view (Stoll 1929; Strong 1955). It is true that\nhe started out, from his undergraduate days, with the project of\nreforming the inductive philosophy of Bacon; indeed this early\ninductivism led him to the view that learning about scientific method\nmust be inductive (i.e., that it requires the study of the history of\nscience). Yet it is clear that he believed his study of the history of\nscience and his own work in science were needed in order to flesh out\nthe details of his inductive position. Thus, as in his epistemology,\nboth a priori and empirical elements combined in the\ndevelopment of his scientific methodology. Ultimately, Whewell\ncriticized Mill’s view of induction developed in the System\nof Logic not because Mill had not inferred it from a study of the\nhistory of science, but rather on the grounds that Mill had not been\nable to find a large number of appropriate examples illustrating the\nuse of his “Methods of Experimental Inquiry.” As Whewell\nnoted, Bacon too had been unable to show that his inductive method had\nbeen exemplified throughout the history of science. Thus it appears\nthat what was important to Whewell was not whether a philosophy of\nscience had been, in fact, inferred from a study of the history of\nscience, but rather, whether a philosophy of science was inferable\nfrom it. That is, regardless of how a philosopher came to invent\nher theory, she must be able to show it to be exemplified in the\nactual scientific practice used throughout history. Whewell believed\nthat he was able to do this for his discoverers’ induction. \nWhewell’s moral philosophy was criticized by Mill as being\n“intuitionist” (see Mill 1852). Whewell’s morality\nis intuitionist in the sense of claiming that humans possess a faculty\n(“conscience”) which enables them to discern directly what\nis morally right or wrong. His view differs from that of earlier\nphilosophers such as Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, who claimed that this\nfaculty is akin to our sense organs and thus spoke of conscience as a\n“moral sense.” Whewell’s position is more similar to\nthat of intuitionists such as Cudworth and Clarke, who claimed that\nour moral faculty is reason. Whewell maintained that there is no\nseparate moral faculty, but rather that conscience is just\n“reason exercised on moral subjects.” For this reason,\nWhewell referred to moral rules as “principles of reason”\nand described the discovery of these rules as an activity of reason\n(see 1864, 23–4). These moral rules “are primary\nprinciples, and are established in our minds simply by a contemplation\nof our moral nature and condition; or, what expresses the same thing,\nby intuition” (1846, 11). Yet, what he meant by\n“intuition” was not a non-rational mental process, as Mill\nsuggested. On Whewell’s view, the contemplation of the moral\nprinciples is conceived as a rational process. Whewell noted that\n“Certain moral principles being, as we’ve said, thus seen\nto be true by intuition, under due conditions of reflection and\nthought, are unfolded into their application by further reflection and\nthought”(1864, 12–13). Morality requires rules because\nreason is our distinctive property, and “Reason directs us to\nRules” (1864, 45). Whewell’s morality, then, does not have\none problem associated with the moral sense intuitionists. For the\nmoral sense intuitionist, the process of decision-making is\nnon-rational; just as we feel the rain on our skin by a non-rational\nprocess, we just feel what the right action is. This is often\nconsidered the major difficulty with the intuitionist view: if the\ndecision is merely a matter of intuition, it seems that there can be\nno way to settle disputes over how we ought to act. However, Whewell\nnever suggested that decision-making in morality is a non-rational\nprocess. On the contrary, he believed that reason leads to common\ndecisions about the right way to act (although our desires/affections\nmay get in the way): he explained “So far as men decide\nconformably to Reason, they decide alike” (see 1864, 43). Thus\nthe decision on how we ought to act should be made by reason, and so\ndisputes can be settled rationally on Whewell’s view.  \nMill also criticized Whewell’s claim that moral rules are\nnecessary truths which are self-evident. Mill took this to mean that\nthere can be no progress in morality—what is self-evident must\nalways remain so—and thus to the further conclusion that the\nintuitionist considers the current rules of society to be necessary\ntruths. Such a view would tend to support the status quo, as Mill\nrightly complained. (Thus he accused Whewell of justifying evil\npractices such as slavery, forced marriages, and cruelty to animals.)\nBut Mill was wrong to attribute such a view to Whewell. Whewell did\nclaim that moral rules are necessary truths, and invested them with\nthe epistemological status of self-evident “axioms” (see\n1864, 58). However, as noted above, Whewell’s view of necessary\ntruth is a progressive one. This is as much so in morality as in\nscience. The realm of morality, like the realm of physical science, is\nstructured by certain Fundamental Ideas: Benevolence, Justice, Truth,\nPurity, and Order (see 1852, xxiii). These moral ideas are conditions\nof our moral experience; they enable us to perceive actions as being\nin accordance with the demands of morality. Like the ideas of the\nphysical sciences, the ideas of morality must be explicated before the\nmoral rules can be derived from them (see 1860a, 388). There is a\nprogressive intuition of necessary truth in morality as well as in\nscience. Hence it does not follow that because the moral truths are\naxiomatic and self-evident that we currently know them (see 1846,\n38–9). Indeed, Whewell claimed that “to test self-evidence\nby the casual opinion of individual men, is a\nself-contradiction” (1846, 35). Nevertheless, Whewell did\nbelieve that we can look to the dictates of positive law of the most\nmorally advanced societies as a starting point in our explication of\nthe moral ideas. But he was not therefore suggesting that these laws\nare the standard of morality. Just as we examine the phenomena of the\nphysical world in order to explicate our scientific conceptions, we\ncan examine the facts of positive law and the history of moral\nphilosophy in order to explicate our moral conceptions. Only when\nthese conceptions are explicated can we see what axioms or necessary\ntruths of morality truly follow from them. Mill was therefore wrong to\ninterpret Whewell’s moral philosophy as a justification of the\nstatus quo or as constituting a “vicious circle.” Rather,\nWhewell’s view shares some features of Rawls’s later use\nof the notion of “reflective equilibrium.” (For more on\nWhewell’s moral philosophy, and his debate with Mill over\nmorality, see Snyder 2006, chapter four.)","contact.mail":"ljsnyder1@me.com","contact.domain":"me.com"}]
