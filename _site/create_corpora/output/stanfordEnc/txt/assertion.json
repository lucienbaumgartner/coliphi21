The concept of assertion has occupied a central place in the\nphilosophy of language, since it is often thought that making\nassertions is the use of language most crucial to linguistic\nmeaning. In recent years, by contrast, most of the interest in\nassertion has come from epistemology.\n\nThe nature of assertion and its relation to other categories and\nphenomena have been subject to much controversy. Some of the ideas of\nassertion will be presented below. The article will situate assertion\nwithin speech act theory and pragmatics more generally, and then go on\nto present the current main accounts of\nassertion.[1]\n\nBy an account of assertion is here meant a theory of what\nit consists in to make an assertion. According to such\naccounts, there are deep properties of assertion: specifying\nthose properties is specifying what a speaker essentially\ndoes in making an assertion (e.g., express a\nbelief). There must also be surface properties, which\nare the properties by which we can tell whether an utterance is an\nassertion, for instance that it is made by means of uttering a sentence in\nthe indicative mood. Some accounts specify deep properties only, while\nothers relate deep properties to surface properties, as we shall\nsee.\n\nGottlob Frege characterized the assertoric quality of an utterance\nas an assertoric force (“behauptende\nKraft”; Frege 1918b: 22) of\nthe utterance. This idea was later taken over by J.L. Austin\n(1962: 99–100), the founding\nfather of the general theory of speech acts. Austin distinguished\nbetween several levels of speech act, including these: the locutionary\nact, the illocutionary act and the perlocutionary act. The locutionary\nact is the act of “‘saying something’\nin the full normal sense” (1962:\n94), which is the utterance of certain words with certain\nmeanings in a certain grammatical construction, such as uttering\n‘I like ice’ as a sentence of English. The notion of an illocutionary act was introduced by Austin by\nmeans of examples (1962: 98–102),\nand that is the normal procedure. Illocutionary acts are such acts as\nasserting, asking a question, warning, threatening, announcing a\nverdict or intention, making an appointment, giving an order,\nexpressing a wish, making a request. An utterance of a sentence, i.e.,\na locutionary act, by means of which a question is asked is thus an\nutterance with interrogative force, and when an assertion is\nmade the utterance has assertoric force\n(sometimes ‘assertive’ is used instead). Each\ntype of illocutionary act is a type of utterance with the\ncorresponding illocutionary force. The perlocutionary act is made by means of an illocutionary act,\nand depends entirely on the hearer's reaction. For instance, by means\nof arguing the speaker may convince the hearer, and by means\nof warning the speaker may frighten the hearer. In these\nexamples, convincing and frightening are perlocutionary acts. The illocutionary act does not depend on the hearer's reaction to\nthe utterance. Still, according to\nAustin (1962: 116–7) it does\ndepend on the hearer's being aware of the utterance and understanding\nit in a certain way: I haven't warned someone unless he heard what I\nsaid. In this sense, the performance of an illocutionary act depends\non the “securing of uptake” (Austin\n1962: 117). However, although Austin's view is intuitively\nplausible for speech acts verbs with speaker-hearer argument structure\n(like x congratulates y) or speaker-hearer-content\nargument structure (x requests of y\nthat p), it is less plausible when the structure is\nspeaker-content (x asks whether p). The\nverb ‘assert’ is of the latter kind, as\nopposed to, for example, ‘tell’. It may be\nsaid that I failed to tell him that the station was closed, since he\nhad already left the room when I said so, but that I\nstill asserted that it was closed, since I believed he was\nstill there. As we shall see, several theories of assertion focus on\nhearer-directed beliefs and intentions of the speaker, without\nrequiring that those beliefs are true or the intentions fulfilled. Austin had earlier (1956) initiated\nthe development of speech act taxonomy by means of the distinction\nbetween constative and performative\nutterances. Roughly, whereas in a constative utterance you report an\nalready obtaining state of affairs—you say\nsomething—in a performative utterance you create something new:\nyou do something (Austin 1956:\n235). Paradigm examples of performatives were utterances by\nmeans of which actions such as baptizing, congratulating and greeting\nare performed. Assertion, by contrast, is the paradigm of a constative\nutterance. However, when developing his general theory of speech acts,\nAustin abandoned the constative/performative distinction, the reason\nbeing that it is not so clear in what sense something\nis done, for instance by means of an optative utterance, whereas\nnothing is done by means of an assertoric one. Austin noted, for\nexample, that assertions are subject both to infelicities and to\nvarious kinds of appraisal, just like performatives\n(Austin 1962: 13–66). For\ninstance, an assertion is insincere in case of lying as a\npromise is insincere when the appropriate intention is lacking\n(Austin 1962: 40). This is an infelicity\nof the abuse kind. Also, an assertion is, according to\nAustin, void in case of a failed referential presupposition,\nsuch as in Russell's  This is then an infelicity of the same kind—flaw-type\nmisexecutions—as the use of the wrong formula in a legal\nprocedure (Austin 1962: 36), or of the\nsame kind—misinvocations—as when the requirements\nof a naming procedure aren't met (Austin 1962:\n51), or again when I try to sell you something that isn't mine\n(Austin 1962: 137). Further, Austin noted that when it comes to appraisals, there is\nnot a sharp difference between acts that are simply true and false,\nand acts that are assessed in other respects\n(Austin 1962: 140–7). On the one\nhand, a warning can be objectively proper or improper, depending on\nthe facts. On the other hand, assertions (statements) can be assessed\nas suitable in some contexts and not in others, and are not simply\ntrue or false. An example is As an alternative, Austin suggested five classes of illocutionary\ntypes (or illocutionary verbs): verdictives,\nexercitives, commissives, behabitives and\nexpositives (Austin 1962:\n151–64). You exemplify a verdictive, for example, when as\na judge you pronounce a verdict; an exercitive by appointing, voting\nor advising; a commissive by promising, undertaking or declaring that\nyou will do something; a behabitive by apologizing, criticizing,\ncursing or congratulating; an expositive by acts appropriately\nprefixed by phrases like ‘I reply’, ‘I argue’,\n‘I concede’ etc., of a general expository nature. In this classification, assertion would best be placed under\nexpositives, since the prefix ‘I assert’ is or may be of\nan expository nature. However, an assertion need not in itself be\nexpository. As a classification of illocutionary types Austin's\ntaxonomy is thus not completely adequate. Other taxonomies have been proposed, for instance by Stephen Schiffer\n(1972), John Searle (1975b), Kent Bach and Robert M. Harnish (1979),\nand Francois Recanati (1987). In Bach and Harnish's scheme, similar to\nSearle's, there are four top\ncategories: constatives, directives (including\nquestions and prohibitives), commissives (promises,\noffers) and acknowledgments (apologize, condole, congratulate)\n(1979: 41). The category of constatives\nincludes the subtypes, in Bach and Harnish's terms,\nof assertives, predictives, retrodictives,\ndescriptives, ascriptives, informatives,\nconfirmatives, concessives, retractives,\nassentives, dissentives, disputatives,\nresponsives, suggestives and suppositives\n(1979: 41). In this list, predictives are distinguished by concerning the future\nand retrodictives by concerning the past, dissentives by the fact that\nthe speaker is disagreeing with what was earlier said by the hearer,\nand so on. Assertives, according to this taxonomy, is not\ndistinguished from other constatives by any such feature. As Bach and\nHarnish point out (1979: 46), most of\nthe specialized types of constatives satisfy the definition of\nassertives (see section 3.1). This type then\nstands out as a higher category, including most but not all of the\nconstatives; not for instance suggestives (suggesting, conjecturing)\nand suppositives (assuming, stipulating). A leading idea in the taxonomies of Searle\n(1975a) and Recanati (1987) is to\ndistinguish between between types according to direction of\nfit. Constative utterances have a word-world direction of fit\n(what is said is supposed to conform to what the world is like), while\nperformative utterances have world-word direction of fit (the world is\nsupposed to be changed to fit what is said). Again, assertion is the\nparadigmatic constative type, if not the constative type itself. Assertion is generally thought of being open, explicit and direct,\nas opposed for instance to implying something without explicitly saying\nit. In this respect, assertion is contrasted\nwith presupposition and implicature. The contrast\nis, however, not altogether sharp, partly because of the idea of\nindirect speech acts, including indirect assertions. A sentence such as is not true unless the singular term ‘Kepler’ has\nreference. Still, Frege argued that a speaker asserting that Kepler\ndied in misery, by means of (3) does not also assert that\n‘Kepler’ has reference (Frege 1892:\n574). That Kepler had reference is not part of the sense of the\nsentence. Frege's reason was that if it had been, the sense of its\nnegation would have been that Kepler did not die in misery or\n‘Kepler’ does not have reference, which is\nabsurd. According to Frege, that ‘Kepler’ has reference is\nrather presupposed, both in an assertion of (3) and in an\nassertion of its negation. The modern treatment of presupposition has followed Frege in\ntreating survival under negation as the most important test for\npresupposition. That is, if it is implied\nthat \\(p\\), both in an assertion of a\nsentence \\(s\\) and in an assertion of the\nnegation of \\(s\\), then it is presupposed\nthat \\(p\\) in those assertions (unless\nthat \\(p\\) is entailed by all\nsentences). Other typical examples of presupposition\n(Levinson 1983: 178–81) include\n implying that John tried to stop in time, and implying that Martha drank John's home brew. In the case of (3), the presupposition is clearly of a semantic\nnature, since the sentence ‘Someone is identical with\nKepler’, which is true just if ‘Kepler’ has\nreference, is a logical consequence both of (3) and of (4). By\ncontrast, in the negated forms of (5) and (6), the presupposition can\nbe cancelled by context (e.g., as in (7)) This indicates that in this case the presupposition is rather a\npragmatic phenomenon; it is the speaker or speech act rather than the\nsentence or the proposition expressed that presupposes\nsomething. However, the issue of separating semantic from pragmatic\naspects of presupposition is complex, and regarded differently in\ndifferent approaches to presupposition (for an overview,\nsee Simons\n2006).[3] In either case, presupposing should be kept distinct from\nasserting. One further reason is that the presupposition occurs in\nother illocutionary types as well. For instance, in asking the speaker normally assumes that John tried and is only asking\nabout the success. Still, it is not easy to distinguish assertion from\npresupposition in pure speech act terms. Typically, the distinction is\nbased either on the meaning properties of the sentence used, or on\nproperties of the conversational setting, that is on what is taken for\ngranted (cf. section 5, regarding Stalnaker's\naccount). For instance, by a concierge may inform a group checking in to a hotel about the\nstate of the pool.[4] \nFormally, in (9) it is presupposed rather\nthan asserted that the pool will be closed, but the information is\nconveyed equally well by means of the presupposition as by means of a\nmore direct assertion with given that the guests did not already know that the pool\nwould be closed, and given that the guests were able\nto compute the presupposition (both taken for granted by the\nconcierge). By contrast, assuming that the concierge believes that a\nguest does know that the pool will be closed, (9) will not be\nused to convey information about the pool, only about the attitude of\nthe staff, while a sincere utterance of (10) is an assertion that the\npool will be closed, whatever is assumed about the hearer's prior\nknowledge. The contrast between (9) and (10) highlights a common\nintuition about a central feature of assertion: explicitness. On this\nintuition, only the content that is explicitly expressed is asserted,\nwhile further contents may be indirectly conveyed, relying on\nbackground knowledge and reasoning. This idea is controversial,\nhowever, and the opposite intuition is that indirect ways of conveying\ninformation can be assertoric in their own right. More on this theme\nbelow. Frege noted (1879: 20) that there is\nno difference in truth conditional content between sentences such\nas ‘And’ and ‘but’ contribute the same way to\ntruth and falsity. However, when using (11b), but not when using\n(11a), the speaker indicates that there is a contrast of some kind\nbetween working with real estate and liking fishing. The speaker is\nnot asserting that there is a contrast. For instance, forming\na conditional with (11b) in the antecedent preserves the contrast\nrather than make it hypothetical: It is usually said that the speaker in cases like (11b) and\n(12) implicates that there is a contrast. These are examples\nof implicature. H. Paul Grice (1975,\n1989) developed a general theory of implicature. Grice called\nimplicatures of the kind exemplified conventional, since it\nis a standing feature of the word ‘but’ to give rise to\nthem. Most of Grice's theory is concerned with the complementing kind,\nthe conversational implicatures. These rely on general\nconversational maxims, not on features of expressions. These maxims\nare thought to be in force in ordinary conversation. For instance, the\nmaxim Be orderly! requires of the speaker to recount events\nin the order they took place. This is meant to account for the\nintuitive difference in content between According to Grice's account, the speaker doesn't assert, only\nimplicates that the events took place in the order recounted. What is\nasserted is just that both events did take place. Real or apparent violations of the maxims generate implicatures, on\nthe assumption that the participants obey the over-arching Cooperative\nPrinciple. For instance, in the conversation B implicates that he doesn't know where in Canada John spends the\nsummer. The reasoning is as follows: B violates the Maxim of Quantity\nto be as informative as required. Since B is assumed to be\ncooperative, we can infer that he cannot satisfy the Maxim of Quantity\nwithout violating some other maxim. The best candidate is the\nsub-maxim of the Maxim of Quality that requires you not to say\nanything for which you lack sufficient evidence. Hence, one can infer\nthat B doesn't know. Again, B has not asserted that he doesn't know,\nbut still managed to convey it in an indirect manner. The picture is more complex because of a distinction Grice\nmade within the domain of conversational implicatures,\nbetween particularized and generalized implicatures\n(Grice 1975: 37–8). Generalized\nimplicatures do not depend on contextual features, but are default\ninferences associated with ways of including or not including explicit\ninformation. One of Grice's own examples is  carrying the generalized implicature that the woman is not\n“X's wife, mother, sister or perhaps even close\nplatonic friend”.[5] The clear distinction between assertion and implicature, as Grice\nthought of it, is to some extent undermined by\nacknowledging indirect assertion as a kind of assertion\nproper. A standard example of an indirect speech act is given by By means of uttering an interrogative sentence the speaker requests\nthe addressee to pass the salt. The request is indirect. The question,\nliterally concerning the addressee's ability, is direct. As defined by\nJohn Searle (1975b: 59–60), and\nalso by Bach and Harnish (1979: 70), an\nindirect illocutionary act is subordinate to another, more primary act\nand depends on the success of the first. An alternative definition,\ngiven by Sadock (1974: 73), is that an\nact is indirect just if it has a different illocutionary force from\nthe one standardly correlated with the sentence-type used. Examples of indirect assertions by means of questions and\ncommands/requests are given by  Rhetorical questions also have the force of assertions: Another candidate type is irony: assuming the speaker does mean the negation of what is literally\nsaid. However, although in a sense the act is indirect, since the\nspeaker asserts something different from what she would do on a\nnormal, direct use of the sentence, and relies on the hearer to\nrealize this, it is not an indirect assertion by either definition. It\nisn't on the first, since the primary act (the literal assertion)\nisn't even made, and it isn't on the second, since there is no\ndiscrepancy between force and sentence type. Irony does, however, qualify as indirect assertion on the\ndefinition given by Recanati (1987:\n125). According to Recanati, an indirect speech act is a\nspecial kind of conversational implicature, where the speaker not only\nimplicates some proposition \\(p\\), but\nalso intends to convey that \\(p\\). In\nthe case of (19), there is an apparent flagrant violation of the\nQuality principle to say only what is true. On the assumption that the\nspeaker is cooperative, together with background knowledge of her\npolitical awareness, the hearer can infer that she does not mean what\nshe literally says, but rather the opposite, that is, that what\nshe wants to communicate is the negation of what she\nsays. For Recanati, the communicative intention is what brings this\nact under the category of assertion proper (see\nsection 3.1). Although Searle's definition of indirect speech acts is different,\nSearle too thinks that they work by means of an inferential mechanism,\nincluding that of conventional implicature. The hearer is supposed to\nunderstand that the speaker cannot merely be performing the primary\nact, since that would violate conversational principles, and then\nagain conclude by conversational reasoning what other act has been\nperformed. The very idea of indirect speech acts is, however,\ncontroversial. It is not universally agreed that an ordinary utterance\nof (16) is indirect, since it has been denied (e.g., by\nLevinson 1983: 273–6) that a\nquestion has really been asked, over and above the request. Similarly,\nLevinson have questioned the idea of a standard correlation between\nforce and sentence form, by which a request would count as indirect on\nSadock's criterion. The notion of an indirect assertion is controversial, and in need\nof further clarification. What is common to all ideas is that indirect\nassertions are not explicit: what is expressed, or literally said, is\nnot the same as what is asserted. One question is whether an utterance\nis an assertion proper that \\(p\\) if that\ncontent is not exactly what is expressed, or whether it is an act of a\nrelated kind, perhaps an implicature. Another question is how far an\nutterance may deviate from explicitness and yet be counted as an\nassertion, proper or indirect. This question comes up in discussion of\nproposed counterexamples to certain theories (cf. sentence (21)\nin subsection 3.2).[6] Many accounts of assertion emphasize, one way or another,\nits social character. Some do it from a normative, and some\nfrom a descriptive, perspective. In this section and the next, we\nshall focus on the descriptive versions. These fall into two broad\ntypes: the communicative intentions type and what we shall\nhere call the commitment type. According to the former, it is\nthe intentions a speaker has with respect to the mind of the hearer that\nconstitutes assertion, while according to the latter, assertion is\nconstituted by the change of the social relation between speaker and\naddressee that the utterance brings about. By an utterance we shall here understand any physical\nitem, event or state of affairs by means of which a speaker\ncommunicates. This may be an oral utterance (vocalizing), a physical\ngesture or sequence of gestures (as in sign languages), an inscription\n(analogue or digital), or the intentional creation or preservation of\nsome state of affairs (e.g., a configuration of\nobjects). A hearer is someone who observes the utterance and\nwho can understand its communicative significance (exactly what this\nmodal qualification amounts to will not be an issue here). We will\nneed to distinguish between being an addressee, that is\nthe intended receiver of an utterance, and being an actual\nhearer. There may be other hearers of the utterance than the\naddressee, some known by the speaker to be hearers (as when speaking\nto one member of a group of people) and perhaps some unknown (e.g.,\neaves-droppers). It may also be that the addressee is in fact not a\nhearer (i.e., does not in fact notice the utterance), only intended to\nbe so by the speaker. We shall first be concerned with the intentions\nvariety. Typically, the speaker who makes an assertion has\naddressee-directed intentions in performing a speech act. The\nspeaker may intend the hearer to come to believe something or other\nabout the speaker, or about something else, or intend the hearer to\ncome to desire or intend to do something. Such intentions can concern\ninstitutional changes, but need not. Intentions that are immediately\nconcerned with communication itself, as opposed to ulterior goals, are\ncalled communicative intentions. The idea of communicative intentions derives from\nGrice's (1957)\narticle ‘Meaning’, where Grice defined what\nit is for a speaker to non-naturally mean something. Grice's\nidea can be set out as follows: S non-naturally means something by an\nutterance \\(u\\) if, and only if, there is a\nhearer \\(H\\) such that\ni) \\(S\\) intends u to bring about a\nresponse \\(R\\)\nin \\(H\\), and\nii) \\(S\\)\nintends \\(H\\) to recognize that (i), and\niii) \\(S\\) intends at least part\nof \\(H\\)’s reason\nfor \\(R\\) to be that (i). (cf. Strawson (1964: 28);\nhere ‘that (i)’ is short\nfor ‘that S intends \\(u\\)\nto bring about a response R\nin H’). That is, the speaker intends the hearer\nto react in a certain way because of recognizing that the speaker\nwants him to react in that way. Often, for instance in Grice's original\nexamples, the intended reaction is one of coming to believe something,\nand that is a reaction that typically fits the speaker's intention or\nat least desire when making an assertion. Although Grice did not\nexplicitly attempt to define assertion, the idea can be\nstraightforwardly applied to provide one: In the early to mid 1960s Austin's speech act theory and Grice's\naccount of communicative intentions began to merge. The connection is\ndiscussed in Strawson 1964. Strawson\ninquired whether illocutionary force could be made overt by means of\ncommunicative intentions. He concluded that when it comes to highly\nconventionalized utterances, communicative intentions are largely\nirrelevant, but that on the other hand, convention does not play much\nrole for ordinary illocutionary types. Strawson also pointed out a\ndifficulty with Grice's analysis: it may be the case that all three\nconditions are fulfilled, but that the speaker intends the hearer\nto believe that they aren't, for instance by intending the hearer to\nbelieve that the speaker wants him to believe\nthat \\(p\\) for an entirely different\nreason. Such intentions to mislead came to be called sneaky\nintentions (Grice 1969), and they\nconstituted a problem for speech act analyses based on communicative\nintentions. The idea was that genuine communication is essentially\nopen: the speaker's communicative intentions are meant to be fully\naccessible to the hearer. Sneaky intentions violate this requirement\nof openness, and therefore apparently they must be ruled out one way\nor another. Strawson's own solution was to add a fourth clause about\nthe speaker's intention that the hearer recognize the third\nintention. However, that solution only invited a sneaky intention one\nlevel up (cf. Schiffer 1972:\n17–42). Another solution was to make the intention reflexive. This\nwas proposed by Searle (1969), in the\nfirst full-blown analysis of illocutionary types made by appeal to\ncommunicative intentions. Searle combined this with an appeal to\nsocial institutions as created by rules. We return to these in the\nfollowing subsection. Searle criticized Grice for requiring the speaker to\nintend perlocutionary effects, such as what the speaker shall\ncome to do or believe, pointing out that such intentions aren't\nessential (1969: 46–7). Instead,\naccording to Searle, the speaker intends to be understood,\nand also intends to achieve this by means of the hearer's recognition\nof this very intention itself. Moreover, if the intention is\nrecognized, it is also fulfilled: ‘we achieve what we try to do\nby getting our audience to recognize what we try to do’\n(Searle 1969: 47). This reflexive\nintention is formally spelled out as follows: The illocutionary effect IE is the effect of generating the state\nspecified in the constitutive rule. In the case of assertion, the\nspeaker intends that her utterance counts as an undertaking\nthat p represents an actual state of affairs, depending on\nthe constitutive rule (see next subsection). Bach and Harnish follow Searle in appealing to reflexive\ncommunicative intentions. On their analysis\n(Bach & Harnish 1979: 42), assuming\na speaker S and a hearer H, According to Bach and Harnish's understanding, a\nspeaker S expresses an attitude just in\ncase S R-intends (reflexively intends) the hearer to\ntake S's utterance as reason to think S has that\nattitude. They understand the reflexive nature of the intention pretty\nmuch like Searle. They say (1979: 15)\nthat the intended effect of an act of communication is not just any\neffect produced by means of recognition of the intention to produce a\ncertain effect, it is the recognition of that intention. These appeals to reflexive intentions were later criticized, in\nparticular by Sperber and Wilson (1986:\n256–7). Their point is that if an intention I\nhas as sub-intentions both the intention J and the intention\nthat the hearer recognize I, this will yield an infinitely\nlong sequence: the intention that: J and the hearer recognize\nthe intention that: J and the hearer recognize the intention\nthat: J and …). If this is an intention content at\nall, it is not humanly graspable. Another variant of the communicative intention analysis is\nRecanati's. Part of Recanati's solution to the sneaky intention\nproblem, following Grice (1969),\nconsists in simply demanding that sneaky intentions be absent. This is\nwhat it is for an intention to be open,\nor default-reflexive (Recanati 1987:\n191–207). He also follows Sperber and Wilson's idea of\nmaking something manifest, i.e., perceptible or inferable\n(1987: 120,\n180; Sperber & Wilson 1986:\n38). Putting the various ingredients together (including\nprototypicality conditions of\nassertion—Recanati 1987: 183), we\nget: This is another complex analysis. The complexity of these accounts\nis itself a problem, since it assumed that ordinary speakers are in\nthe habit of making assertions, and thereby to have the required\nintentions for doing it. But since it requires detailed analytic work\nto come up with the accounts, and there even are competing accounts,\nit is unlikely that ordinary speakers have the intentions required. If\nthey do, they are clearly not aware of having them as agents usually\nare aware of their intentions. Postulating such intentions in ordinary\nspeakers is clearly problematic. The difficulty is made more severe, because there are speakers with\na demonstrated inability to understand belief and other cognitive\nattitudes. Some speakers with autism, who are clearly by everyday\nstandards using language for making assertions, fail so-called\nfalse-belief tests. Thereby they reveal an inability to distinguish\nbetween a proposition being believed and being true, and hence (since\nthey do distinguish between truth and falsity), reveal a lack of\nunderstanding of what it is to believe something. If you cannot\nunderstand what it is to believe something, you cannot intend someone\nto believe something either (cf. Glüer &\nPagin 2003). All in all, the complexity and sophistication\nrequired of asserters by these communication-intentions accounts,\ngives a reason to suspect that they do not provide necessary\nconditions for making assertions. Normative and commitment accounts of assertion do not seem in\ngeneral to suffer from these problems. The other aspect of the social character of assertion concerns what\nthe speaker does by means of making an assertion. The idea is\noften stated in terms of making a commitment/undertaking,\nor taking responsibility. This was emphasized by\nC.S. Peirce: What is the nature of assertion? We have no magnifying-glass that\ncan enlarge its features, and render them more discernible; but in\ndefault of such an instrument we can select for examination a very\nformal assertion, the features of which have purposely been rendered\nvery prominent, in order to emphasize its solemnity. […] This\ningredient, the assuming of responsibility, which is so prominent in\nsolemn assertion, must be present in every genuine assertion. For\nclearly, every assertion involves an effort to make the intended\ninterpreter believe what is asserted, to which end a reason for\nbelieving it must be furnished. But if a lie would not endanger the\nesteem in which the utterer was held, nor otherwise be apt to entail\nsuch real effects as he would avoid, the interpreter would have no\nreason to believe the assertion. (Peirce 1934:\n547) We can distinguish three ideas in the quote from Peirce, and add a\nfourth that has been proposed by later authors. Firstly, as a\nmatter of socio-linguistic observation, speakers in fact in some sense\ntake responsibility for, or commit themselves to, being right in what\nthey say. The speaker puts her cognitive authority behind it, so to\nspeak, and has to suffer some measure of social humiliation if what\nshe says turns out false. This idea of commitment can also serve to\ndistinguish between assertion proper and weaker constative forms, such\nas guesses and conjectures, since these differ from assertion with\nrespect to commitment. Secondly, there is the further idea that the commitment is\nmade to the addressee or the hearers in general. The speaker who makes\nan incorrect assertion opens himself to criticism by his addressee,\nperhaps for misleading him, in a way similar to a subject who fails to\nlive up to a promise. In this respect, the social relation\nbetween speaker and addressee has changed because of the\nassertion. Typically, the addressee will hold the speaker accountable\nfor the correctness of the assertion, and the speaker accept to be\nheld so accountable. This is again a socio-linguistic observation: it\ndoes not follow that the speaker actually is accountable. Thirdly, Peirce has the idea that it is the\nresponsibility-taking that gives the addressee the reason to\nbelieve what is asserted. It is unclear whether Peirce speaks of\nreasons in the descriptive sense (a person's actual reason, good or\nbad) or in the normative sense (a good reason, actual or not). It is\nagain probably socio-linguistically true that hearers are more prone\nto believe the speaker when they perceive him as sincere,\nthereby as taking responsibility. However, a speaker may be sincere\nbut unreliable (prone to error) and also reliable but insincere (for\ninstance, conveying messages without caring about their accuracy). As\nregards having a good reason, it seems that the reliability\nof the speaker is the crucial factor, not sincerity (but\nsee Moran 2005 for the opposite\nview). Fourthly, we might take the commitment idea to be what\nessentially characterizes assertion: on this idea, asserting\nthat \\(p\\) consists in committing\noneself to the truth of \\(p\\). This is the\nleading idea of commitment accounts of\nassertion.[7] Commitment-making is a central idea in Searle's\n(1969) account. In Searle's view, there\nare five rules for the use of force indicating devices, that is, devices\nthat exhibit the utterance as having a particular force. In the case\nof assertion, they are as follows. Here S is the speaker\nand H the hearer: The fifth rule is the crucial one, and it is held to\nbe constitutive of assertion. Constitutive rules are\ncontrasted with regulative rules rules (the terminology is\ntaken from Kant). Roughly, whereas regulative rules regulate a\npre-existing activity, such as traffic regulations regulate traffic,\nconstitutive rules in a sense create a new activity. Paradigm\nexamples are rules of games, taken as defining the games, and thus\nmaking it possible to play them. The distinction was introduced by\nRawls (1955), and also suggested by\nC.G.B. Midgley (1959), in the same terms\nand format as later by Searle (1969:\n33–42; cf. Glüer & Pagin\n1999). That is, according to Searle, without rule 5, the practice of\nassertion would not exist. Once the rule is in force, an utterance\nwith the relevant assertion-indicating device creates the\nundertaking, and thereby also the assertion itself. According to\nSearle (1969: 65), the\nspeaker expresses the state required by the sincerity rule,\ni.e., in the case of assertion, expresses a belief. Also, the\nspeaker implies that the preparatory conditions are met. The analysis is completed by first requiring that normal input and\noutput conditions obtain, second that the conditions of Rules\n1–4 are met, and finally that the semantical rules of\nthe dialect spoken by S and H are such that T is\ncorrectly and sincerely uttered if and only if the aforementioned\nconditions are met. Searle's account is thus a complicated combination\nof appeals to linguistic conventions, social relations, and reflexive\ncommunicative intentions (see previous subsection). Later social accounts have tended to focus either on the\nconventional/institutional or on the intentional features. An example\nis Kotatko (1998: 236–9), who like\nSearle stresses the importance of social conventions about what counts\nas making a commitment or undertaking. Another example\nis Alston (2000: 120): Here the locution\n\n“\\(R\\)'d that \\(p\\)” is short for “\\(U\\) took responsibility for its being the case that \\(p\\)” (2000:  7). There is in such accounts a question of what it exactly consists in\nto make a commitment or undertaking to the truth of a proposition. One\nelaboration of this idea is provided by Brandom\n(1994). According to Brandom\n(1994: 173–5), the nature of\nassertion consists in the fact that in asserting, the speaker achieves\ntwo different social results at the same time: on the one hand\nshe authorizes the hearer to claim anything that follows from\nwhat is asserted and on the other she undertakes the responsibility\nof justifying it. Another suggestion is given in MacFarlane\n(2005): This is the idea that assertion is partly characterized by a\ncommitment to take back, withdraw, or (in later\nwritings) retract, the assertion in later adverse\ncontexts. MacFarlane's framework is relativist, with the idea\nthat the truth of a sentence, as well as the evaluation of an\nassertion, for some particular kinds of sentences (e.g., concerning\nfuture contingents) must be judged with respect to both the original\ncontext of use, and a separate independent context of\nassessment (e.g., by an assessor at a future time). As we shall see,\nlater MacFarlane restates the idea in terms of norms of assertion, but\nthen too, the idea of retraction of an assertion is\ncentral. It may be noted here that Dummett in passing expresses a related\nidea in saying that “an assertion is a kind of gamble that the\nspeaker will not be proved wrong”\n(Dummett 1976: 84). Should it turn out\nthat the speaker was wrong, he “may subsequently be compelled to\nwithdraw it as incorrect” (Dummett 1991:\n165). Both Searle and Brandom took an analysis of promising as\nthe role model for analysing assertion. There are clear\nsimilarities. For instance, by means of a sincere utterance of the speaker has committed herself, in relation to the addressee, to\ndo something. Both speaker and hearer will regard the speaker as\nhaving incurred an obligation to the addressee. The relation between\nasserting and promising is discussed in detail\nin Watson 2004. Watson elaborates on the\nsimilarities in commitments made with assertions and with promises:\nboth involve a secondary commitment of what to do in case\nthings go wrong (2004: 67). But he also\nemphasizes the basic difference: that in the case of assertion, but\nnot in the case of promises, the commitment is to something that\nis independent of the speaker. According to Watson, this is\nnot the truth of what is asserted, but\nits defensibility (2004: 68). A\nconsequence of this is that the speaker is obliged to to defend the\nassertion if challenged (2004: 70). Sandy Goldberg (2013) has recently\ndrawn attention to the phenomenon of anonymous assertion,\nwhich is exemplified in particular in anonymous posts in comment\nthreads or discussion forums on the Internet. He remarks that in such\ncircumstances, hearers cannot hold speakers responsible for their\nutterances, and have no means of assessing the epistemic credentials\nof the speakers, which leaves them without warrant to trust the\nspeakers, and speakers know this. As a result,  when it is mutually known by all parties that a\nclaim was made under conditions of anonymity, this has a diminishing\naffect on the sort of (assertion-generated) expectations that speakers\nand hearers are entitled to have of one\nanother. (2013: 135) The question is how much of the commitment\n remains. If utterances in these circumstances are still recognizably\n assertions, there seem to be assertions without, or with hardly any,\n speaker commitments. Although this is not an issue raised by\n Goldberg, it seems hard for a commitment account to accommodate. Suppose, nonetheless, that it is true that in general (or perhaps\neven always), that speakers do make commitments when\nasserting. Suppose, similarly, that in general, or perhaps always,\nspeakers do have communicative intentions of some kind when\nasserting. Would either assumption directly provide\nan account of assertion in these terms? The answer is no, for\nthe assumptions are only that committing oneself, or having certain\ncommunicative intentions, is a necessary condition for making\nan assertion. It is a further step to infer that the respective\nconditions are sufficient as well, that is, that there are no\nother ways of expressing the relevant commitments or communicative\nintentions that are not assertions. Are there other ways? It is argued in Pagin\n(2004) that there are, since one can use the very statement of\na social character account itself to construct an utterance type that\nisn't assertoric, but that would be assertoric by the account\nin question. A simple example is given by Intuitively, a sincere utterance of (21) would not be an assertion\nthat there are black swans. What is said does not entail that there\nare black swans. It seems to be no more than a declaration of the\nspeaker's stand on the issue, and that declaration may be accurate\neven if there are no black swans. Still, it does incur a commitment to\nthe truth of the proposition that there are black swans. If\nthis is right, then incurring a commitment to truth is not sufficient\nfor asserting. Similar constructions can be made out of other\naccounts, for instance by letting the speaker declare herself to have certain\ncomplex intentions. Pagin's arguments have been criticized. For\ninstance, Pegan (2009) argues, among\nother things, that the proposed counterexamples can be blocked by\ncarefully amending the theory (cf. Pagin\n(2009) for a reply). Both MacFarlane\n(2011) and García-Carpintero\n(2013) argue that we should distinguish between what is said\nand what is asserted, and that this allows us to maintain that\nan indirect assertion that swans are black are made by means\nof directly saying that the speaker commits\nhimself. According to both, Pagin's attempt to block the indirect\nassertion route fails. According to Frege (1918a: 22), an\nassertion is an outward sign of a judgment\n(Urteil). The term ‘judgment’ has been used in\nseveral ways. If it is used to mean either belief, or act\nby which a belief is formed or reinforced, then Frege's view is\npretty close to the view that assertion is the expression\nof belief. How should one understand the idea of expressing here? It is\nnatural to think of a belief state, that is, a mental state of the\nspeaker, as causally co-responsible for the making of the\nassertion. The speaker has a belief and wants to communicate it, which\nmotivates an assertoric utterance. But what about the cases when the\nspeaker does not believe what he asserts? Can we still say, even of\ninsincere assertions, that they express belief? If so, in what\nsense? Within the communicative intentions tradition, Bach and Harnish\nhave emphasized that an assertion gives the hearer evidence\nfor the corresponding belief, and that what is common to the sincere\nand insincere case is the intention of providing such evidence: For S to express an attitude is\nfor S to R-intend the hearer to take S's\nutterance as reason to think S has that\nattitude. (Bach & Harnish 1979: 15),\nitalics in the original) (‘R-intend’ is, as above, short for\n‘reflexively intend’). On this view, expressing is wholly\na matter of hearer-directed intentions. This proposal has the advantage of covering both the sincere and\nthe insincere case, but has the drawback of requiring a high level of\nsophistication. By contrast, Bernard Williams\n(2002: 74) has claimed that a sincere\nassertion is simply the direct expression of belief, in a\nmore primitive way. Insincere assertions are different. According to\nWilliams (2002: 74), in an assertion,\nthe speaker either gives a direct expression of\nbelief, or he intends the addressee to “take it”\nthat he has the belief (cf. Owens\n2006). Presumably, the intention mentioned is an intention about what the\naddressee is to believe about the speaker. In this case the objection\nthat too much sophistication is required is less pressing, since it\nonly concerns insincere assertions. However, Williams's idea (as\nin Grice 1969) has the opposite defect\nof not taking more sophistication into account. The idea that\nthe alternative to sincerity is the intention to make the addressee\nbelieve that the speaker believes what he asserts, is not general\nenough. An insincere speaker \\(S\\) who asserts\nthat \\(p\\) may know that the\naddressee \\(A\\) knows\nthat \\(S\\) does not believe\nthat \\(p\\), but may still intend to\nmake \\(A\\) believe\nthat \\(S\\) does not know\nabout \\(A\\)'s knowledge, precisely by making\nthe assertion that \\(p\\). There is no\ndefinitive upper limit to the sophistication of the deceiving\nspeaker's calculations (cf. Pagin 2011: Section\n7). In addition, the speaker may simply be stonewalling,\nreiterating an assertion without any hope of convincing the addressee\nof anything. A more neutral way of trying to capture the relation between\nassertion and believing was suggested both by Max Black\n(1952) and by Davidson\n(1984a: 268): in asserting\nthat p the speaker represents herself as believing\nthat p. This suggestion appears to avoid the difficulties\nwith the appeal to hearer-directed intentions. A somewhat related approach is taken by\nMitchell Green (2007), who appeals to\n“expressive conventions”. Grammatical moods can have such\nconventions (2007: 150). According to\nGreen (2007: 160), an assertion\nthat \\(p\\) invokes a set of conventions\naccording to which the speaker “can be represented as bearing\nthe belief-relation to \\(p\\)”. As one represent oneself as believing, one can also represent\noneself as knowing. Inspired by Davidson's proposal, Peter Unger\n(1975: 253–70) and Michael Slote\n(1979: 185) made the stronger claim that\nin asserting that p the speaker represents herself as\nknowing that p. To a small extent this idea had been anticipated\nby G.E. Moore when claiming that the speaker implies that she\nknows that p (1966: 63). However, it is not so clear what representing oneself amounts\nto. It must be a sense different from that in which one\nrepresents the world as having certain features. The speaker\nwho asserts does not also claim that she believes that there are black\nswans. It must apparently be some weaker sense of\n‘represent’, since it is not just a matter of\nbeing, as opposed to not being, fully explicit. By means of answering\nthe question what I believe with an utterance of (22) I do represent\nmyself as believing that there are black swans, equivalently with\nasserting it. What I assert then is wrong if I don't have the belief,\ndespite the existence of black swans. On the other hand, it must also be stronger than the sense of\n‘represent’ by which an actor can be said to represent\nhimself as believing something on stage. The actor says thereby representing himself as asserting that he is in the biology\ndepartment, since he represents himself as being a man who honestly\nasserts that he is in the biology department. By means of that, he in\none sense represents himself as believing that he is in the biology\ndepartment. But the audience is no way invited to believe\nthat the speaker, that is, the actor, has that belief. Apparently, the relevant sense of ‘represent’ is not\neasy to specify. That it nevertheless tracks a real phenomenon is\noften claimed to be shown by Moore's Paradox. This is the paradox that\nassertoric utterances of sentences such as (the omissive type of Moorean sentences) are distinctly odd, and\neven prima facie self-defeating, despite the fact that they\nmay well be true. Among the different types of account of Moore's\nParadox, Moore's own emphasizes the connection between asserting and\nbelieving. Moore's idea (1944:\n175–6; 1966: 63) was that\nthe speaker in some sense implies that she believes what she\nasserts. So by asserting (24) the speaker induces a contradiction\nbetween what she asserts and what she implies. This contradiction is\nthen supposed to explain the oddity. An analogous move has been made as regards knowledge-varieties of\nMoorean sentences, such as Clearly, utterances of sentences like (25) are bad, and some think\nthat they are as bad as the paradigmatic Moorean sentences like\n(24). It is then argued that their badness show that a speaker who\nasserts that \\(p\\) also represents himself as\nknowing that \\(p\\)\n(cf. Unger 1975:\n256–60; Slote 1979: 179,\nand Williamson 2000: 253–5 with\napplication to the knowledge norm). Linguistic arguments of this kind in general, explicitly or\nimplicitly, have the form of an inference to the best explanation. As\nsuch, they are problematic, since there are competing explanations of\nthe badness of Moorean utterances. We return to this topic at end\nof subsection 6.2. A definition proposed by Dummett (1981:\n300) may be seen as a way of cashing in the talk of\nself-representation: Dummett's proposal is presumably intended to give necessary as well\nas sufficient conditions, but there are problems with both. With the\nnecessary conditions because of the possibility of direct expressions\nof belief, as urged by Williams, and with sufficiency for reasons of\nthe same kind as discussed at the end of the previous section: a\nspeaker may try to convey the Dummett-type impression in deviant\nways. Communicative intentions accounts, commitment accounts, and\nself-representation accounts are all descriptive: they say nothing\nabout what ought to be done, about the existence of norms, or\nabout the propriety/correctness of assertions. However, except for the\nidea that a sincere assertion is the expression of a belief that a\nspeaker actually has, none of these types of account focuses on the\ncognitive features of representing the world and judging the\nrepresentation to be true as a main characteristic. A few more\ncognitively oriented accounts do that. As noted above, Frege held (1918a:\n22) that an assertion is an outward sign of a judgment\n(Urteil). A judgment in turn, in Frege's view, is a\nstep from a Thought, that is, a representational content, to the\nacknowledgment of its truth (Frege 1892:\n34; translation in Frege 1960:\n64, with ‘admission’ instead\nof ‘acknowledgment’\nfor ‘Anerkennung’). Since for Frege,\nthe truth value is the Reference (Bedeutung) of a sentence, a\njudgment is an advance from Sense to Reference. In case the subject\nmakes a mistake, it is not the actual Reference, but anyway the\nReference the subject takes it to have. We can transform Frege's view slightly, in the following way: in\njudging that \\(p\\), the subject advances from\nthe content that \\(p\\) to the\nrelevant point of evaluation, with respect to which this\ncontent is either true or false. Frege countenanced exactly one point\nof evaluation: the World. In a sense, judging is applying a\ncontent to the World. In this form, the idea generalizes. If contents are possible-worlds\npropositions, the points of evaluation are possible worlds. All actual\njudgments are then applications of propositions to the actual\nworld. If contents are temporal propositions, true or\nfalse with respect to world-time pairs, then all actual judgments are\napplications to the ordered pair of the actual world and a relevant\ntime, usually the time at which the judgment is made. This is the\npoint with respect to which a sentence, used in a context of\nutterance, has its truth value (cf. Kaplan\n1989: 522). Again, the relation is general: if the content of a\njudgment is a function from indices of some type to truth\nvalues, then a judgment is the very step of applying that content to\nthe relevantly actual index. On this picture, what holds for judgment carries over to\nassertion. It is in the force of an utterance that the step is taken\nfrom the content to the actual point of evaluation. This view has been\nstated by Recanati with respect to the actual world: a content is not enough; we need to connect that content with the\nactual world, via the assertive force of the utterance, in virtue of\nwhich the content is presented as characterizing that\nworld. (Recanati 2007: 37) Essentially, this is Frege's view: the speaker gives an outer sign\nof taking the proposition to be true. The question is whether this\nview can be given a non-metaphorical rendering that improves on the\nidea of expressing a belief. One phrase that is often used in this context that of\n“presenting a proposition as true”\n(cf. Wright 1992: 34). Prima\nfacie, it characterizes assertion well. However, there are two\nproblems with the idea. The first is that it should generalize to\nother speech act types, but does not seem to do so. For instance,\npresenting the proposition that Elsa is at home as a\nproposition that the speaker would like to know the truth value of,\nleaves it open whether the utterance is interrogative, optative, or\nimperative: Secondly, it is unclear what “presenting” amounts\nto. It must be a sense of the word different from that in which the\nword ‘heterological’ is presented as long\nin For if the word is presented as long in the sentence (27),\nthen also the proposition that snow is white is presented as\ntrue in the sentence even if the sentence is not uttered assertorically. There\nis therefore a weak sense of ‘present’, which\ndoes not require that the presentation itself is made with assertoric\nforce (like an obsolete label on a bottle), and that sense is too\nweak. It would be instantiated by conjectures, assumptions, and\nperhaps also by forceless utterances. There is clearly also a stronger\nsense of ‘present’ which does\nrequire assertoric force (for cases when the label is taken to apply),\nbut that is just what we want to have (non-circularly)\nexplained. Simply using the phrase “present as true” does\nnot by itself help. Another idea for characterizing assertion in terms of truth-related\nattitudes is that assertion aims at truth. This is stated,\nfor instance, both by Bernard Williams (1966)\nand by Michael Dummett (1981). It can be\nunderstood in two rather different ways, the one intended by Williams\nand the other by Dummett (for some ways of understanding what it could\nbe for belief to aim at truth,\nsee Engel\n(2004), Glüer & Wikforss\n(2013). On Williams's view, the property of aiming at truth is what\ncharacterizes fact-stating discourse, as opposed to, e.g.,\nevaluative or directive discourse. It is natural to think of as stating a fact, and of as expressing an evaluation, not corresponding to any fact of the\nmatter. On Williams's view, to regard a sincere utterance of as a moral assertion, is to take a realistic\nattitude to moral discourse: there are moral facts, making moral\nstatements objectively true or false. This view again comes in two\nversions. On the first alternative, the existence of moral facts\nrenders the discourse fact-stating, whether the speaker thinks so or\nnot, and the non-existence renders it evaluative, again whether the\nspeaker thinks so or not. On the second alternative, an utterance of\n(31) is an assertion if the speaker has a realistic attitude towards\nmoral discourse and otherwise not. On these views, it is assumed that truth is a substantial property\n(Williams 1966: 202), not a concept that\ncan be characterized in some deflationary way. As a consequence, the\nsentence is to be regarded as false, since (30) is objectively neither true\nnor false; there is no fact of the matter. Pointing to the difference between fact-stating and evaluative\ndiscourse may help to distinguish assertions from evaluations, but\ndoes not, again, help to distinguish assertion from other acts within\nthe fact-stating family, such as conjectures and assumptions. In fact,\nunless we read a lot into “stating”, it is not enough even\nto distinguish assertion from other acts that concern facts, or states\nof affairs, such expressing a wish that a fact obtains. In addition, recent years have seen a broadening of the use of the\nterms ‘truth’\nand ‘assertion’ that runs counter to\ncharacterizing assertion by means of the fact-value dichotomy. In\nvarious forms of relativism, expressions of judgments of\npersonal taste, such as are characterized as assertions, and the semantic treatments use\ntruth as the basic sentence property. Common to varieties of\nrelativism with respect to predicates of personal taste is the idea\nthat there is an extra parameter of evaluation, a standard of\ntaste, over and above, say, possible world and time. Despite the\nlack of objectivity in a more ordinary sense, such a semantics is\ntypically coupled with treating utterances of sentences such as as\nassertions (cf. Kölbel 2004:\n71; Lasersohn\n2005; Egan\n2012; MacFarlane 2014:\nChpt. 7). There is, of course, a further question whether such\na treatment is appropriate. Perhaps the best way of capturing the cognitive nature of assertion\nis to to give a theory of the cognitive features of normal\ncommunication by means of assertion. A classic theory is Stalnaker's\n(1974, 1978). Stalnaker provides a model\nof a conversation in which assertion and presupposition dynamically\ninteract. On Stalnaker's model, propositions are presupposed in a\nconversation if they are on record as belonging to the common ground\nbetween the speakers. When an assertion is made and accepted in the\nconversation, its content is added to the common ground, and the the\ntruth of the proposition in question will be presupposed in later\nstages. What is presupposed at a given stage has an effect on the\ninterpretation of new utterances made at that stage. Stalnaker uses a\npossible worlds framework, and characterizes the common ground as a\nset of possible worlds (the worlds where all that is presupposed is\ntrue), the context set. In this framework Stalnaker (1978: 88–89) proposes three\nrules for assertion: Stalnaker comments on the first rule:  To assert something incompatible with what is\npresupposed is self-defeating […] And to assert something which\nalready presupposed is to attempt to do something that is already\ndone. On such an approach, the satisfaction of a presupposition is\nan admittance condition of an assertion (cf. Karttunen 1974;\nHeim 1983). This idea connects with Austin's more general pragmatic\nidea of felicity conditions of speech acts. However, as was already pointed out by Stalnaker\n(1974: 55), and later stressed\nin Lewis (1979), an assertion that\nintuitively presupposes the truth of another proposition need not\nfail, but can instead have the effect of adjusting the common\nground. In so-called accommodation, the hearer adds\nbackground assumptions that would be required for interpretation. For\ninstance, upon hearing Lewis utter the hearer who didn't know may accommodate by adding the assumption\nthat there is a unique, contextually salient cat. Accommodation is\nfurther discussed in Stalnaker (2002),\nwhere it is stressed, among other things, that it works, when it\nworks, because of what is already presupposed. For example (34), it is\npresupposed that the speaker knows whether or not he has a cat. Whatever the truth about presupposition accommodation, Stalnaker\noffers a model of the cognitive features of communication and the role\nof assertion therein. Does it thereby also offer an account of\nassertion? The answer is no, for the role of assertion is shared by\nother speech acts such as assuming\nand conjecturing. What is added to the common ground is only\nfor the purpose of conversation, and need not be\nactually believed by the participants. It is only required\nthat it be accepted (cf. Stalnaker\n2002: 716). Stalnaker has not (as far as I am aware) attempted to add a\ndistinguishing feature of assertion to the model. This has, however,\nbeen attempted by Jonathan Schaffer\n(2008) and by Max Kölbel (2011:\n68–70). Schaffer proposes to add a topic-sensitive\nknowledge norm (cf. subsection 6.2) to the\nStalnakerian picture. Kölbel focuses on commitments instead. According\nto Kölbel, assumptions differ from assertion in two respects. Firstly,\nthey are temporary, which means that they can be revoked when they\nhave served their purpose. Secondly, they do not have the same\ncommitment properties. On Kölbel's view, an assertion\nthat \\(p\\) is made with the (Brandomian)\nundertaking of the “obligation to justify\nthat \\(p\\) on request”. This\nundertaking, according to Kölbel, also distinguishes assertion from\npresupposition, although in a more subtle way. It is not, however,\nclear why in Kölbel's view, Stalnaker's account would be needed in\naddition to the obligation property. Another cognitive account is offered by Pagin\n(2011). The account is summarized by the\nphrase: “an assertion is an utterance that is prima\nfacie informative”. For an utterance to be informative is\nfor it to be made in part “because it is true”. What this\namounts to is different, but complementary, for speaker and\nhearer. For the speaker, part of the reason for using a\nparticular sentence is that it is true (in context); that is, the\nspeaker believes, with a sufficient strength, that the sentence\nexpresses a true proposition. For the hearer, taking the utterance as\ninformative, means, by default, to update his credence in the\nproposition as a response to the utterance, both in the upwards\ndirection and to a level above 0.5. The prima facie element of the account means that the\ntypical properties on the speaker and hearer side are\nonly default properties associated with surface features of\nthe utterance: the declarative sentence type, a typical intonation\npattern, etc. There are many possible reasons why a speaker my utter\nsuch a sentence without believing the proposition, and why a hearer\nmay not adjust his credence in the typical manner. For example, the\nspeaker may be lying, the hearer may distrust the speaker, or may\nalready have given the proposition a very high credence before the\nutterance. On Pagin's picture, it is the cognitive patterns associated\nwith surface features, on the production and comprehension sides, that\ncharacterize assertion. This way of dividing the account between\nspeaker and hearer is somewhat controversial. Yet another cognitive account is elaborated\nin Jary (2010). Jary's account is\nsituated within Relevance Theory, a more general account of\ncognition and communication. As a typical ingredient of this general\nframework, when an assertion is made, the proposition expressed by the\nutterance is presented as “relevant to the hearer”\n(2010: 163),\nwhere ‘relevant’ is a technical term\n(Sperber & Wilson 1995: 265). What distinguishes assertion from other speech act types is\nsomething different: Assertion cannot be defined thus, though. In order for an utterance\nto have assertoric force, it must also be subject to the cognitive and\nsocial safeguards that distinguish assertion. […] It is the\napplicability of these safeguards that distinguishes assertion both\nfrom other illocutionary acts and from other forms of information\ntransfer. (Jary 2010: 163–4) Social safeguards consist in sanctions against misleading\nassertions, while cognitive safeguards consist in the ability of the\nhearer to not simply accept what is said but meta-represent the\nspeaker as expressing certain beliefs and intentions\n(2010: 160). It is part of a full\naccount of assertion, according to Jary, that assertions are subject\nto these safeguards. This also distinguishes assertions from promises\nand commands, where the proposition is not presented as subject to the\nhearer's safeguards; “rejection is not presented as an option\nfor the hearer” (2010: 73). Although Jary's account no doubt captures some of the cognitive\ningredients in producing and comprehending assertions, it seems also\nto be a fairly liberal mixture of social character accounts and\ncommunicative intentions accounts. One wonders whether it is\nimpossible to make assertions without the existence of social\nsanctions, and how plausible it is to suppose the average speaker\nto intend his utterance to be subject to the hearer's ability\nto meta-represent the speaker. The idea that language use in general is governed by rules or norms\nis old and widespread. That speech acts, as speech acts, are governed\nby norms, is again a well established idea. It is also currently\n(2014) a very popular idea: by far most of the literature on assertion\nover the past fifteen years has concerned the question of the\nso-called “norms of assertion”, often simply taking for\ngranted that there are such norms, and that they play a central and\nfundamental role. The task is then to identify them. In the literature, two very different types of norm have been\ndiscussed. One type concerns the decision whether or not an assertion\nhas been made by means of an utterance. These norms are usually\ncharacterized as conventions. The other type concerns\nconditions of propriety, or correctness, of\nassertion (in some cases actions following an assertion). These are\ntypically called “norms”, and are sometimes characterized\nas “constitutive” of assertion as a speech act type. We\nshall discuss these two types separately. Austin held that illocutionary acts as opposed to perlocutionary\nacts are conventional, in the sense that they can be made\nexplicit by the so-called performative formula\n(Austin 1962: 103). According to Austin,\none can say ‘I argue that’ or ‘I\nwarn you that’ but not ‘I convince you\nthat’ or ‘I alarm you\nthat’. Presumably, the idea was that a speech act type is\nconventional just if there exists a convention by which an utterance\nof a sentence of a certain kind ensures (if uptake is secured) that a\nspeech act of that type is performed. Austin probably thought that in\nvirtue of the performative formulas this condition is met by\nillocutionary but not by perlocutionary act types. The more general claim that illocutionary force is correlated by\nconvention with sentence type has been advocated by Michael Dummett\n(1981: 302, 311). On this view, it is a\nconvention that declarative sentences are used for assertion,\ninterrogative for questions and imperative for commands and\nrequests. Similar views have been put forward by Searle\n(1969) and Kotatko\n(1998), and the idea has been more\nrecently defended by Kölbel\n(2010). According to Searle (1969: 38,\n40), illocutionary acts are conventional, and the conventions\nin question govern the use of so-called force-indicating devices\n(Searle 1969: 64) specific to each\nlanguage. Searle does not claim that the standard sentence types are\nforce indicating devices (but speculates that a representation of\nillocutionary type would be part of the syntactic deep structure). However, the view that illocutionary acts types are conventional in\nthis sense has met with much opposition. Strawson\n(1964: 153–4) objected early on\nthat ordinary illocutionary acts can be performed without relying on\nany convention to identify the force, for instance when using a declarative\nsentence like ‘The ice over there is very\nthin’ for a warning. This kind of criticism, now directed\nagainst Dummett, has later been reinforced by Robert J. Stainton\n(1997, 2006), stressing that in\nappropriate contexts, sub-sentential phrases like ‘John's\nfather’ (pointing at a man) or ‘very\nfast’ (looking at a car) can be used to make assertions,\nand gives linguistic arguments why not all such uses can be treated as\ncases of ellipsis, that is, as cases of leaving out parts of a\nwell-formed sentence that speaker and hearer tacitly aware of. If\nStrawson and Stainton are right, convention isn't necessary for making\nassertions. Moreover, Donald Davidson\n(1979, 1984a)\nstressed that no conventional sign could work as a force indicator in\nthis sense, since any conventional sign could be used (and would be\nused) in insincere utterances, where the corresponding force was\nmissing, including cases of deception, jokes, impersonation and other\ntheatrical performances. Basically the same point is made by Bach and\nHarnish (1979: 122–7). If\nDavidson, and Bach and Harnish are right, then conventions are also\nnot sufficient. Kölbel (2010) argues against this\nthat in certain circumstances misuse is impossible. For instance,\naccording to Kölbel (2010: 125) in a\nsituation of contract signing, you cannot just pretend to be signing a\ncontract; if you write your name at the appropriate place, you have\nthereby signed the contract, whatever went on in your mind. This is no\ndoubt correct, but if Davidson and Bach and Harnish are right, it is\npossible to fake an entire contract signing situation, as a joke or as\npart of a performance. Within a fake situation, you can also fake the\nsigning, by performing an action that looks just as the genuine\nsigning itself. The situation is complicated by the fact that the general question\nof when a convention, or rule of any kind, is in force for a\nspeaker, is substantial and complex (cf. Pagin\n1987: Chpt. 1). For instance, it may be fully determined by\npurely public features of a linguistic\ncontext \\(c\\) whether according to a\nconvention \\(R\\) an assertion was made, but\nyet not itself settled by purely public features whether\nconvention \\(R\\) was in force for the speaker\nin \\(c\\). This would still leave it a\nnon-public issue whether an assertion was made. Most of the discussion of norms during the past fifteen years has\nconcerned the propriety, or correctness, of\nassertions, not conventional means of recognizing them (Kölbel\n(2010) is one of few to discuss\nboth). In general, an account of assertion in terms of norms is an account\nthat invokes the existence, or the being in force,\nof norms that uniquely govern assertions. This is not just a\nsociological observation. I can note\nthat \\(S\\) has committed himself to\ndoing \\(F\\), in the sense\nof accepting such a commitment, without myself\nthinking that \\(S\\) is obligated to do it,\njust as well as I can think\nthat \\(S\\) is obligated although he\nhimself does not recognize it. By contrast, if I both say that\nassertions are actions governed by such and such norms, and that\nfurthermore assertions are in fact made, I have myself taken a\nnormative stance, acknowledging the force of norms. Does such an acknowledgment come already with classifying\nassertions as correct or incorrect? Is correctness an\ninherently normative notion, or is it just descriptive?\nAccording to, for instance, (an earlier view of) Paul Boghossian\n(1989: 513), the mere fact that we can\nevaluate assertions as correct or incorrect shows that words are\ngoverned by norms of use. According to Kathrin Glüer, Anandi\nHattiangadi, and Åsa Wikforss, and to a later view of Boghossian's, on\nthe other hand, there is no reason to see in the notions of\ncorrectness and incorrectness anything more than a descriptive\nclassification, which may then be coupled with certain a preference\nfor correct assertions over incorrect ones, both in making and in\ntaking (cf. Glüer 2001:\n60–5; Hattiangadi\n2010; Wikforss\n2001; Boghossian\n2003; Glüer & Wikforss 2009a,\n2009b). Those preferences may then be explained by wholly\nexternal factors, for instance by appeal to social psychology, or the desire\nfor knowledge, but is not internal to the idea of assertion\nitself. Moreover, even if we are using a genuinely normative notion of\ncorrectness, it may well be that the norm in question is not unique to\nassertion, but governs a broader range of actions, perhaps actions in\ngeneral, as in the case of moral norms. We shall return to this latter\npoint. As has often been noted, an assertion can be correct in different\nrespects. For instance, a speaker can say something true but be\nimpolite in saying it, thereby making an assertion that is incorrect\nwith respect to norms of etiquette. It may also have been immoral, or\nimprudent, tactically or strategically bad. Moreover, an assertion may\nhave, for instance an implicature that is incorrect, even though the\nprimary act considered in isolation is to be deemed correct. Sometimes, a distinction is made between aspects of badness that\ncan be eliminated by means of retracting an assertion, and aspects\nthat can't be. I can take back a claim if I find I was wrong, but I\ncannot eliminate for instance a breach of confidence. According to\nDummett (1976: 48), this distinction is\ndrawn between aspects that concern what is said and aspects\nthat concern the saying of it, respectively\n(compare Kvanvig 2009: 148). The\nrelevant notion of correctness, according to Dummett, concerns only\nwhat is said. He adds that  an undifferentiated concept of the acceptability\nof an utterance—of an utterance's not being open to criticism of\nany kind—would be of little use for our\npurposes. Clearly, it is the epistemic aspects of assertions that\nhave been the concern in the literature when characterizing assertions\nas “correct”, “justified”,\n“proper”, “warranted”,\n“assertible”, or “warrantedly\nassertible”. Such a notion was taken on board in pragmatism, and\nin later forms of anti-realism. John Dewey\n(1938) seems to have been the first to\ncharacterize truth in terms of assertoric correctness, with his notion\nof warranted assertibility, even though this idea had a clear\naffinity with the verifiability principle of Moritz Schlick\n(1936). Dewey was later followed by,\nnotably, Dummett (1976) and Hilary\nPutnam (1981). Common to them is the\nposition that there cannot be anything more to truth than being\nsupported by the best available evidence. Dewey, following Peirce,\nregarded truth as the ideal limit of scientific inquiry\n(Dewey 1938: 345), and a proposition\nwarrantedly asserted only when known in virtue of such an\ninquiry. Warranted assertibility is the property of a proposition for\nwhich such knowledge potentially exists\n(1938: 9). Putnam (1981: 54–6) operated\nwith an idea of assertibility under ideal epistemic conditions. Under\nnormal conditions, a speaker can be justified in making an assertion\neven though what she asserts is false. The evidence is enough for\ntruth under normal circumstances, but because of abnormal interference\nthe evidence falls short. For instance, improbable changes, say\nbecause of a fire, may have taken place after the speaker's\nobservation. However, in ideal epistemic conditions evidence\nthat is sufficient for justifying an assertion is also conclusive. On Dummett's view, we do get a notion of truth distinct\nfrom the notion of a correct assertion only because of the\nsemantics of compound sentences (1976:\n50–2). In particular, the conditions of correctly\nassertorically uttering a conditional \\(\\phi {\\\n\\rightarrow\\ }\\psi\\) may depend on the truth-conditions\nof \\(\\phi\\) rather than the conditions of\ncorrect assertions by uttering \\(\\phi\\). This\nis the case in particular in the future tense, as in ‘If\nit will rain, the ceremony will take place indoors’. In\nthis case, whether it is correct or not, at the time of utterance, to\nassert that it will rain, or that it will not rain, is irrelevant to\nthe correctness of an assertoric utterance of the conditional\nitself. In these early discussions, the strategy was that of getting a\nhandle on truth by means of an appeal to the notion of the\ncorrectness of an assertion, which was taken as more fundamental. The\nquestion of what the correctness of an assertion consists in was not\nitself much discussed, although Dummett (1976:\n77–8) is careful to distinguish between the case where a\nspeaker makes an assertion on the basis of adequate evidence, and the\ncase where adequate evidence is available, but the speaker\nmakes the assertion without being aware of it. In the latter case,\naccording to Dummett, the speaker was not correct, but the assertion\nwas. In recent discussions, by contrast, the general strategy has been\nto get a handle on knowledge, and most of the contributors\nhave been concerned with assertion in the context of investigations in\nepistemology, often from different epistemological\nstandpoints. Nevertheless, the scope of the discussion of assertion\nhas increased, with more of a focus on the very question itself: under\nwhat conditions is an assertion correct,\nor proper. The recent wave of discussion was started by Timothy Williamson\n(1996, 2000), who proposed that\nassertion is governed by a norm of assertion. Williamson\nproposed what has come to be known as the knowledge norm,\nor knowledge rule: (K-A) is proposed as part of an account of\nassertion. Other norms have been proposed, and some ideas about the\nrole and status of the norm proposed are usually shared. Let's\nuse \\(N\\) as schematic for a norm of\nassertion. By (N1), the norm is a norm only for the making of assertions. As a\nnorm of assertion, the norm is in place to govern the making of\nassertions in general, and to govern nothing else. If (N2) holds of (K-A), then there is one unique speech act type,\nor even one unique action type such that the agent is permitted in\ngeneral to perform actions of this type, with respect to a\nproposition \\(p\\), only of the agent knows\nthat \\(p\\). Knowing what the condition of\npermissibility is, we will also know what the action type is. This is\ndifferent from (N1), for (N1) leaves it open that another norm with\nexactly the same condition (knowledge\nthat \\(p\\)) would hold for some other\naction type than assertion. This is ruled out by (N2). (N3) goes beyond (N2) insofar as (N2) leaves it open that assertion\nis only actually individuated\nby \\(N\\), and that assertion could\nhave been governed by some other norm. It should be emphasized\nhere that on the norm view, it is being subject to the norm\nthat characterizes assertion, not conforming to the norm. An\nassertion that violates the norm is still an assertion. Nothing but an\nassertion could violate the norm, if the (N2) and (N3)\nproperties hold. This is a stronger property than (N3), but several of the theorists\ndo claim that their proposed norm has this property. We return below\nto what constitutivity amounts to. As we shall see, although this is a property everyone agrees on, it\nhas been used in the debate over the intuitive support of some\ncandidate norms over others. On some understandings of the matter, (N6) is simply\ntrivial. However, it is perfectly possible to see some candidate norms\nas ideals, while the evaluations of individual assertions may\ntake into account various relations between the assertion and the norm\nover and above conformity. In fact, this has been an issue in the\ndebate, as we shall also see. The positive evaluation requires satisfaction of all relevant\nnorms. If there is only one, this norm cannot be only prohibitive,\nthat is, specify necessary conditions, as does (K-A), but should be\nbiconditional, and also give sufficient conditions as well. A\nbiconditional strengthening of (K-A) is Williamson gives only the prohibitive version. The biconditional\nversion is discussed in Hawthorne 2004:\n23 and Lackey 2011: 251–75,\nas well as in Brown 2010\nand 2011\n(Brown (2010) argues against the\nsufficiency part by means proposed counterexamples). It may be noted that (K2-A) is prima facie inconsistent\nwith (N5): if the norm says that an assertion is permissible while\nanother norm says that it is not, we have a contradiction, unless we\nspecify a separate respect in which assertions are assessed\nwith respect to the norm of assertion. As long as the norm is couched\nin neutral deontic terms, there is a problem. Merely prohibitive norms\ndo not have this problem, unless in relation to other norms that are\nthemselves biconditional. For the most part, the literature on norms of assertion has\nconcerned the question which the norm of assertion is. That\nis, it is in general not asked whether there are norms of assertion\n(in some sense or other), what status such norms have, whether they\nare constitutive, or what constitutivity amounts to. It is normally\ntaken for granted that there is a norm that holds for all assertions\nand for assertions specifically (the property). The question is which,\nand what the reasons are for favoring this or that answer. Over and above Williamson himself, the knowledge norm (K-A) (or\n(K2-A)) has been favored by Keith DeRose\n(2002), Steven Reynolds\n(2002),\nJonathan Adler (2002: 275), John\nHawthorne (2004), Jason Stanley\n(2005), Pascal Engel\n(2008), Jonathan Schaffer\n(2008), and John Turri\n(2010). Some have proposed norms that are similar to (K-A), but instead\nsets the condition in relation to the transmission of\nknowledge to the hearer. An example is Manuel García-Carpintero\n(2004: 156): Similar norms have also been proposed\nby Pelling (2013) and\nby Hinchman (2013). Carpintero suggests\nthat his version is preferable to Williamson's because it brings out\nthe social, communicative function of language\n(2004: 157). He argues that only (TK-A)\ncould be expected to be a convention, and takes that to speak\nin its favor. Most alternatives to the knowledge norm that have been proposed are\nweaker, in requiring less than knowledge. It has been proposed that\nassertion goes just with truth, just with knowledge, or just with\njustification. Matthew Weiner (2005)\nproposed a truth norm: (this formulation is close to what Weiner says. Cf. also the survey\narticle Weiner (2007). MacFarlane\n(2014: 103) also proposes a truth rule,\nbut requires it to be qualified as being reflective: this\nmeans, in the context of MacFarlane's relativism, that the\nproposition should be true in the context of utterance, as assessed\nfrom the same context of\nutterance.[8]\nAccording to MacFarlane, the truth rule needs to be complemented by\na retraction rule (see below). A corresponding statement of a belief norm would be With ‘say’ instead of belief, this is close to a\nreformulations of Grice's second submaxim of Quality (“Do not\nsay what you believe to be false.” Grice\n1989: 27). The belief norm is explicitly stated\nby Bach (2008: 77). Bach directly infers\nthat the norm of assertion is the belief norm from the fact that an\nassertion is sincere if, and only if, the speaker believes what she\nasserts. A justifed belief norm requires more than (B-A): Exactly what justification amounts to varies between authors. Igor\nDouven\n(2006, 2009)\nargues for a norm of rational belief. Several authors have argued that it is the justification\nitself that is the key to evaluating assertions. A standard\nformulation would be This view has been taken by Jonathan Kvanvig\n(2009: 145; 2011:\n249–50). Kvanvig proposes that the relevant concept of\njustification is such that it is sufficient for knowledge, provided\nthe proposition is both believed and true (and the justification is\nundefeated). Justification is also emphasized by Jennifer Lackey\n(2007: 608), who proposes\na Reasonable to Believe norm, according to which belief is\nnot required; what is required is that it is reasonable to believe\nthat \\(p\\), and that the speaker asserts\nthat \\(p\\) for this reason (even if in fact\nnot believing that \\(p\\)). Lackey backs this\nidea up with thought experiments about so-called\n“selfless” assertions, where speakers make assertion in\naccordance with their evidence but against their beliefs. Also, Ishani\nMaitra and Brian Weatherson (2010: 112)\npropose what they call The Evidence Responsiveness Rule, that\none assert that p only if one's attitude\ntowards \\(p\\) is properly responsive to the\nevidence (they also propose to complement it with an action\nrule, that it is proper to assert\nthat \\(p\\) only if acting as\nif \\(p\\) is “the thing for you to\ndo”.) These alternatives to the knowledge norm all propose norms with\nweaker requirements. But a stronger requirement has also been\nsuggested by Stanley (2008): Here one is epistemically certain of a\nproposition \\(p\\) is  if and only if one knows\nthat \\(p\\) (or is in a position to know\nthat \\(p\\)) on the basis of evidence that\ngives one the highest degree of justification for one's belief\nthat \\(p\\). (2008:\n35) Stanley also considers as an alternative a subjective\ncertainty norm, where it is the degree of confidence of the\nspeaker that matters, but in the end opts for regarding this norm as\nderivable from the epistemic certainty norm. Some authors have proposed norms for what to do after an\nassertion. MacFarlane (2014: 108) holds\nthat a speaker is required to retract an assertion if it\nturns out not be true, in a context of assessment: Again, in MacFarlane's case, this rule is stated in the context of\nhis relativism, with respect to a context of use and a context of\nassessment. In MacFarlane's theory, assertion is governed jointly by\nthe (reflective) truth norm and the retraction norm. According to\nMichael Rescorla (2009), there is no\nnorm at all for proper making of assertions. There are only\nnorms that govern later reactions. He proposes three similar\nalternatives, which share the idea that when a speaker is challenged\nwith respect to an assertion he has made, he must either defend the\nassertion or else retract it (Rescorla 2009:\n103–5). Many authors have noted that standards for judging assertions vary\nbetween contexts, and have proposed to work that into the account. The\nfirst to do so was Keith DeRose\n(2002). DeRose argued from the knowledge\nnorm and the varying standards for assertion as premises, to the\nconclusion that epistemic contextualism is true\n(2002: 182). Epistemic contextualism is\nthe view that ‘know’ is semantically context\ndependent. The truth value of a knowledge attribution ‘X\nknows that \\(p\\)’ depends on\nstandards of knowledge in the context of the\nknowledge attributor. DeRose's argument has been challenged by several authors. For\ninstance, Brown (2010) points out that\nthe argument depends on the biconditional version (K2-A) of the\nknowledge norm, and argues that the sufficiency part is less well\nsupported. Stanley also criticizes DeRose, despite accepting that the\nstandards of proper assertion vary between contexts. According to\nStanley, the reason this does not lead to contextualism about\nknowledge is that assertion is governed by the certainty norm\n(2008: 55–6). According to\nStanley, the varying standards of proper assertion depends on the\ncontext dependence of ‘certain’, not on any\ncontext dependence of ‘know’ (which Stanley\nrejects). According to Schaffer (2008),\non the other hand, knowledge itself is relative to a question\nunder discussion, which is reflected in his version of the\nknowledge norm (Schaffer 2008: 10). Some authors who note that standards of proper assertion appears to\nvary between context suggest that there is not a single norm with a\ncontextual parameter, but rather that different norms apply in\ndifferent contexts, still governing one and the same speech act type,\nassertion. This line has been taken by Jim Stone\n(2007) and by Janet Levin\n(2008). In some contexts knowledge is\nrequired, in some contexts something less demanding, such as justified\nbelief. Patrick Greenough (2011) takes\nthis line even further by proposing norm-relativism: what\nnorm is relevant for an assertion in a context is relative to a\nperspective. One question that arises with respect to such views is this: if the\nspeech act type is individuated by the norm governing it, and norms of\nutterances vary between contexts, is it then still the case that one\nand the same (illocutionary) speech act type is performed across\ncontexts. One who has denied this is John Turri\n(2010). Turri suggests a class of\n“alethic” speech acts, including conjecturing, asserting,\nand guaranteeing. The first is weaker and the third stronger than\nassertion. They are ranked on a so-called “credibility\nindex” (2010: 85), depending on\nwhat degree of credibility is required by the speech act type. In\ncontexts with different demands on credibility, different speech acts\nare performed. For assertion itself, the standard is invariant, it is\nsimply knowledge. Turri uses this view to counter DeRose's argument\nfor epistemic contextualism. The view itself, however, seems not to\nconform to the standard view concerning which utterances belong in the\nextension of ‘assertion’. A more radical conclusion from the assumed normative variation has\nbeen drawn by Herman Cappelen\n(2011). According to Cappelen, the\nproper conclusion is that assertion as a speech act type doesn't\nexist. In Cappelen's words, the\nterm ‘assertion’  fails to pick out an act-type that we engage in\nand it is not a category we need in order to explain any significant\ncomponent of our linguistic practice. (2011:\n21) The picture is complicated even further by the fact that many\naccounts recognize more than one evaluation of assertions. This is\nproposed by Williamson himself (2000:\n256–7), who speaks of a case where it\nis reasonable to assert that \\(p\\) if\none reasonable believes that one knows\nthat \\(p\\). He goes on to say There may be other evidential norms for assertion, if they can be\nderived from the knowledge rule and considerations not specific to\nassertion. The reasonableness of\nasserting \\(p\\) when one reasonably believes\nthat one knows \\(p\\) has just been derived in\nexactly that way (Williamson 2000:\n257). The same distinction between what the norm requires and what is\nreasonable in its light has been drawn by DeRose. In the terminology\nof DeRose (2002: 180), it is known as\nthe distinction between primary and secondary\npropriety. It is primarily improper but secondarily proper to assert\nwhat you reasonably believe that you know but you in fact\ndon't. Similarly, Adler (2002: 235, 275)\ndistinguishes between proper assertions, requiring knowledge,\nand warranted assertions, requiring full belief. Equally,\nTurri (2014) distinguishes\nbetween good assertions, requiring knowledge,\nand permissible assertions, requiring reasonable belief. In these cases, a weaker secondary norm is derived from a stronger\nprimary norm. Others have proceeded in the opposite direction. Both\nBach (2008: 77) and Frank Hindriks\n(2007: 403–4) derive a knowledge\nnorm from a belief norm by means of appealing to a knowledge norm\nfor belief: since you should assert only what you believe and\nbelieve only what you know, you should also assert only what you\nknow. In a somewhat similar fashion, Weiner derives a reasonable\nbelief norm from the truth norm by appeal to Gricean cooperation:\nthe requirement that one's utterance have some point is part and\nparcel of Grice's Cooperative Principle. An assertion does not satisfy\nthis requirement just by be being true (2005:\n232–8) or by being based on facts equally available to\nthe hearer. The speaker must have additional reasons, and in some\ncases knowledge. Some authors reject this distinction between primary and secondary\npropriety. Examples are Lackey (2007:\n604), Engel (2004: 56), and\nKvanvig (2011: 242). They all think that\nwhat we need is an unequivocal notion of when a speaker has acted\nappropriately and when not: if one has acted in an inappropriate way,\nthen one is subject to legitimate criticism, and otherwise\nnot.[9] Accepting the distinction between primary and secondary propriety\ninduces a problem for the intuitive support for the various\ntheories. A large part of the intuitions that serve to support one or\nthe other norm theory relies on raw intuitions about what one should\nor shouldn't assert in some situation, or what is proper or improper\nto assert there. If there are several ways an assertion can be proper\nor improper, then it is not easy to see what concept of propriety is\nbeing tracked by these intuitions. Indeed, the distinction was introduced precisely in order deflect\ncounterintuitive consequences. Several authors have objected to the\nknowledge norm that it is too demanding: many assertions seem not\nimproper even in case the speaker does not know what he asserts. As\nnoted above, Williamson discusses such cases. The idea is that a\nparticular intuition that seems to disconfirm a particular normative\ntheory can be explained away by saying that it does not in\nfact track the primary propriety, but instead only some secondary\npropriety. The problem with this move is that for the theory to be\nsupported by intuitions of correctness/propriety, the application of\nthe primary/secondary distinction should itself be based on\nthese very intuitions. Since intuitions don't come labeled as\n“primary” and “secondary”, there is a risk of\na substantial underdetermination of theory by data: two theorists need\nnot agree about whether or not an intuition about a particular case\nsupports a certain theory. Hawthorne and Stanley\n(2008: 585–6) remark that  […] intuitions go a little hazy in any\nsituation that some candidate normative theory says is sufficient to\nmake it that one ought to \\(F\\) but where, in\nthe case described, one does not know that situation obtains. The situation is not solved by rejecting the primary/secondary\ndistinction. As noted, everyone agrees that assertions are governed by\nvarious norms: moral, prudential, conversational, rules of\netiquette. When does an intuition track the intended notion of a\nproper assertion, and when something else altogether? Kvanvig\n(2011: 235) and Engel\n(2008: 52–4) have drawn attention\nto this situation. According to Kvanvig, intuitions typically concern\nwhether assertions are all-things-considered appropriate. Kvanvig\npoints out that an assertion may be all-things-considered appropriate\nwithout being appropriate from the epistemic point of\nview. However, although this is an important distinction, the question\nis how intuition does support the idea that the epistemic point of\nview is what is relevant. Virtually throughout the discussion, authors have simply appealed\nto their own intuitions. However, this is an area where\nexperimental philosophy would be highly relevant, since the question\nlargely seems to concern what norms ordinary asserters accept. The\nsituation is about to change. Recently, John Turri\n(2013) has published results from a\nseries of survey studies, where the aim was to determine whether\nspeakers accept a factive or a non-factive norm: the norm\nis factive in case an assertion is proper only if what is\nasserted is true, otherwise non-factive. Turri reports six studies,\nwhere subjects are presented with written scenarios and are given\nmultiple choice questions in relation to them. Turri concludes that\nthey all showed that speakers apply a factive norm. A story character\nMaria has strong evidence for a\nproposition \\(p\\), but knows that the evidence\nis inconclusive (an inventory that is only almost complete). In one\nparticular case, the evidence is misleading, and subjects are asked\nwhether Maria “should” assert the false but well supported\nproposition. A clear majority answer no. However, when given\na choice between alternatives of what to say in the same\nevidential situation where it is false\nthat \\(p\\) (Experiment 4), almost as many\nanswer prefer “\\(p\\)” or\n“probably \\(p\\)” as prefer\n“probably not \\(p\\)”,\n“not \\(p\\)”, or “definitely\nnot \\(p\\)”. Furthermore, when asked\nto evaluate an assertion in a situation of blameless mistake,\nwhere the speaker had every reason to expect the evidence not to be\nmisleading (Experiment 5), the outcome was also not\nstraightforward. With respect to the question “Is there a sense\nin which it is incorrect for Robert to make the statement?”, a\nlittle more than half answered no. These results indicate\nthat it is not so clear exactly what properties the subjects'\nintuitions track, nor to what extent there is intersubjective\nagreement. Further studies may help to clarify the picture. In addition to direct intuitions about propriety, proponents of the\nknowledge norm have adduced indirect evidence in the form of\nintuitions about conversational patterns, claiming that these patterns\nare best explained by the acceptance of the knowledge norm. Williamson\nhimself appeals to such patterns, two of which concern utterances of\nlike Concerning the first, it is claimed\n(Williamson 2000: 253) that an utterance\nof (35) is as odd as ordinary belief-related Moorean sentences such as\n(24) above. The oddity is explained by appeal to the knowledge\nnorm. If the assertion is proper, the speaker knows that the\nproposition expressed by (35) is true. Since knowledge distributes\nover conjunction, she knows that it is raining and she knows that she\ndoes not know that it is raining. As knowledge is factive, since she\nknows that she does not know that it is raining, she does not know\nthat it is raining. So we have a contradiction. Hence, the assumption\nthat the assertion is proper leads, on the knowledge account, to a\ncontradiction. An assertion that cannot be proper is odd. Since the\noddity is explained by the knowledge account, it supports the\nknowledge account. (36) is imagined uttered by speaker A in the following\nsituation. The draw of a (fair) lottery with a large number of tickets\nhas been held. It is known that only one ticket wins. B has a\nticket, but neither A nor B knows the result. A\nasserts (36) on merely probabilistic grounds. The probability that the\nticket has won is very low (and one can get it arbitrarily low, short\nof zero, by increasing the number of tickets in the\nlottery). According to the argument, an assertion of (36) in such a\ncase is intuitively incorrect. According to Williamson\n(2000: 246–49), A is\ncriticizable, since A represented himself as having an\nauthority for the assertion which he lacked. The conclusion is that\nonly knowledge provides proper warrant, since no probability short of\n1 escapes the criticism for lack of authority. Hence, the knowledge\naccount explains the unacceptability of A's utterance. Both arguments have been criticized by a number of authors. The\nmost common line is that the data can be equally well or better\nexplained by other competing accounts, extraneous principles, or a\ncombination of these. For instance, Kvanvig\n(2009: 149–50) presents a derivation to show that the\noddity of (35) can be explained by appeal to a justification\nnorm. Similarly, Douven (2009), with\nrespect to his rational belief account. According\nto Stanley (2008), since the certainty\nnorm requires more than just knowledge, everything that can be\nexplained by appeal to the knowledge norm can also be explained by\nappeal to the certainty norm. Others have pointed to the general\npragmatic/rhetorical infelicity of (35) as a fact extraneous to norms\nof assertion, including Douven (2006:\n474–5), Maitra & Weatherson\n(2010: 110), and Cappelen (2011:\n38–40). Maitra and Weatherson claim that there need be\nnothing wrong with first asserting that \\(p\\),\nand later, in response to a question, deny that one knows\nthat \\(p\\), but without retracting\nthe assertion. What is strange is just conjoining the two\nstatements. The opposite view on the matter was taken by\nPaolo Casalegno (2009: 246). Concerning the lottery example (36), Weiner\n(2005: 236) explains the apparent unacceptability of the\nutterance by appeal to Grice's maxim of Manner: putting it\ncategorically, as in (36), instead of in terms of high probability,\nlegitimizes the inference that A has more information than\nwhat was known before the draw. Kvanvig (2009:\n156) claims that the oddity is explained by the justification\naccount, since for a belief to be justified, in Kvanvig's sense,\nrequires that there is no need of further investigation. This is a\ncondition that is not met for the utterance of (36) in the lottery\nscenario. In lotteries, you always have to wait for the draw in order\nto close the inquiry. Further conversational patterns have been adduced in favor of the\nknowledge norm, by Williamson and others. For an overview,\nsee Turri (2014: 565–6). A general\nproblem with the appeal to conversational patterns is that they don't\nseem to favor specifically normative views over corresponding\nnon-normative views. For instance, it appears that any linguistic\nphenomenon that can be explained by appeal to a\nknowledge norm can be equally well explained by appeal to the\nview that asserters represent themselves as knowing what they\nsay (although there is no norm). Combine this with extraneous,\nnon-assertion-specific norms. That A's utterance of (36) is bad\ncan then be explained by appeal to self-representation of knowledge,\ntogether with the general moral norm that it is wrong the\nmislead hearers, for instance by representing oneself as having\nknowledge. Let's finally turn to the question of the normative status of the\nproposed norms. In much of the literature, this question is not\ntouched upon, but when it is, authors tend to favor the idea that the\nnorm is constitutive of assertion. Williamson himself\n(2000: 238–41) is an example, and\nso are Stanley (2008:\n52), Rescorla (2009:\n99–101), Kölbel (2010:\n109–11), and MacFarlane (2014:\n101–2). Typically, norms of assertion are held to be\nconstitutive of assertion as a speech act type as rules of a game\ndefine the game and are constitutive of game action types. Thus,\nproponents take their preferred norms of assertion to have properties\n(N1)–(N4) above (by contrast, Dummett's view\n(1976: 89) was that convention\nsettles what warrants assertion in a community). Against the constitutivity claim, Pagin\n(2011) has argued that insofar as there are norms of assertion,\ntheir status among speakers do not much resemble rules of\ngames. Firstly, players of a game rarely disagree about what the rules\nof the game are. If there is a disagreement, it is settled either by\nappeal to a generally recognized authority, such as a rule-book, or by\nstipulation, if it concerns a new case to be covered by rules. We\ndon't find players appealing to intuition or the oddity of certain\nconversational patterns to convince each other of claims about what\nthe rules are. By contrast, in the literature on norms of\nassertion itself, (as is evident from the presentation above) authors\ndisagree widely about what the norm is, and they appeal to both\nintuition and linguistic arguments to support their own view. It seems\nthat these authors, and perhaps speakers in general, find it easier to\nagree about whether an utterance was an assertion than about whether\nit was or was not proper. Secondly, for a constituted game action type,\nlike castling in chess, to be performable at all, the rules\nof chess must by some decision be in force; if the rules of\nchess are not in force for a person at a particular time, her moving\ntwo pieces of wood at that time does not constitute castling\n(cf. Pagin 1987:\nChpt. 3; Glüer & Pagin\n1999). But this again seems very unlike the relation of norms\nto assertion. It does not seem that an utterance is recognizable as an\nassertion in virtue of a decision to regard it as subject to\nthis or that norm. Rather, it seems that recognizing an utterance as\nan assertion precedes seeing it as subject to evaluation. Maitra (2011) also criticizes the\ngame analogy. Maitra claims that proposed norms fail to be properly\nconstitutive: By contrast, neither the knowledge nor the truth norm tells us what\nit is to assert something. Rather, they each assume that there is\nsomething that counts as asserting, and tell us at what an asserter\nought to be aiming when performing the speech act\n(Maitra 2011: 282). According to Maitra, the reason for this failure on the part of the\ntruth and knowledge norms is that they don't tell us\nwhat counts as asserting. They cannot be rewritten in that\nformat either, because that would leave them incomplete. If we try\n“A speaker asserts \\(p\\) when he utters\na sentence appropriately related to \\(p\\) and\nis criticizable for not knowing \\(p\\)”,\nthis leaves out a required specification of the kind\nof criticizability at issue (2011:\n282, note 12). We might add a specification of this as well,\nbut as I have understood Maitra, this information was supposed to be\nprovided by the norm itself, and if it doesn't, the game analogy is of\nno help. A similar point, that we don't get the relevant specific\nnotion of correctness from the general concept of a rule, is argued\nin Pagin (1987: Chpt. 2). Finally, there is a fundamental question that is not discussed at\nall: In virtue of what is a norm of assertion in force for a\nspeaker or a speech community, if it is in force? Is it because of a\ncollective acceptance? If so, it must be tacit, and, because of the\nwide disagreement among theorists, usually not accessible to\nintrospection. Is it because of some metaphysical fact that assertions\nare essentially governed by this or that norm whenever they are\nperformed, and whatever speakers think about it? That would indeed make\nsense of the debate, since it can be construed as an investigation\ninto normative reality. But there remains a question of what influence\nnormative reality has on linguistic practice. Probably none, or at\nbest a pretty haphazard one, judging from the disagreement. Is it\nperhaps something internal to each speaker, and not intersubjectively\nshared? That can explain the differences among the participants in the\ndebate. But it is hard to square this with the assumption that we\nshare a practice of making and understanding assertions. If you and I\naccept different norms, then I simply misapply my norm to\nyour utterances when interpreting them, and consequently\nsystematically misinterpret your utterances. But for all we can tell,\nthis does not generally seem to happen. All in all, the norm approach\nto assertion seems to have rather many challenges.","contact.mail":"peter.pagin@philosophy.su.se","contact.domain":"philosophy.su.se"}]
