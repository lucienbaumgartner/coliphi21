Helmholtz achieved a staggering number\nof scientific results, including the formulation of energy\nconservation, the vortex equations for fluid dynamics, the notion of\nfree energy in thermodynamics, and the invention of the\nophthalmoscope. His constant interest in the epistemology of science\nguarantees his enduring significance for philosophy.\n\nThe definitive biography of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) is\nby his friend and associate, the mathematician Leo Königsberger.\nKönigsberger’s biography is available in toto from Google\nBooks, since it is in the public domain. While\nKönigsberger’s treatment of scientific subjects can be\ndated somewhat, for biographical information his account is unrivaled.\n \nSelective Timeline \nHelmholtz’s earliest study of physiology was with Johannes\nMüller. Müller (1801–1858) was a keen experimenter and\nnaturalist along the lines of Ernst Haeckel and Alexander von\nHumboldt, sailing to the tropics to find specimens for his studies\n(Otis 2007, 6–14). Early in his career, Müller was also a\nproponent of Schelling’s Naturphilosophie.\nNaturphilosophie took its cue from what Schelling took to be\nKant’s assertion that, while each part of an organism supported\nthe whole, the only purpose of a living organism was itself.\n“Müller’s enormously influential Handbook of\nHuman Physiology, written and rewritten between 1833 and 1844,\nshows his simultaneous commitments to vitalism, philosophy, and\nrigorous science” (Otis 2007, 21).  \nAccording to the “projection” theory of the physiology of\nperception, a stimulus causes its response directly. That is, our\nnerves are malleable, like wax, and the objects “project”\nsignals onto the nerves directly, like a key pressed into the wax.\nBased on experiments in his laboratory, and on the phenomena of\nbinocular vision revealed by the stereoscope Charles Wheatstone\ninvented in the 1830s, Müller observed that several phenomena of\nthe physiology of perception contradict the projection theory. One\nsuch phenomenon is stereoscopic binocular vision, in which the two\nimages on our retinas are resolved into one image, the image we see.\nIf images are projected directly onto the sense nerves, Müller\nasked, then how is stereoscopic vision possible? Müller also\ncited the fact that images from objects are projected onto the retina\nupside down, but we see them as right side up. The projection theory\nhas no explanation of these effects.  \nIn response to experimental data, Müller constructed the\n“law of specific sense energies”\n[Sinnesenergien]. Müller argued that each nerve is\nconfigured to receive a specific range of signals, as a radio is tuned\nto receive sound on a certain wavelength (of course, Müller did\nnot use this analogy). Müller called the configuration a\n“specific sense energy.” Müller explained\nstereoscopic vision by arguing that each retina is able to perceive\nitself, that is, to perceive a priori the manifold, or grid, of points\nthat can be projected onto the retina. Müller hypothesized that\nthere was an organic correlation between the left and the right\nretinas of the eye (Müller 1837–1840, 2: 351–385, see\nalso Turner 1993, 159–160). Each point on the left retina is\nindexed to one and only one point on the right retina. Müller\nargues that for each point seen in stereoscopic vision, the two\nsignals from the corresponding points on the two retinas are projected\nonto a single point.  \nMüller’s explanation appeals to an a priori perception of\nthe retina by itself, and to the activity of projecting two points\nonto a theoretical projection surface a priori. Müller tries to\nuse Kantian philosophy to support his theory, arguing that by the\n“manifold accessible to pure intuition” Kant meant, or\ncould have meant, the a priori possible manifold of physical points\nthat could be perceived by the retina. Robert DiSalle presents\nevidence that this view is not Kantian (DiSalle 1993, 502ff). \nFrom 1838 to 1842, Helmholtz studied medicine under Müller. From\n1842 to 1848, while working as an army surgeon in Potsdam, Helmholtz\nmade many trips to Berlin to work in Gustav Magnus’s library.\nDuring these trips, Helmholtz stayed in contact with fellow students\nof Müller’s he had met while working in Müller’s\nlaboratory, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Ernst Brücke. In 1845,\nHelmholtz joined the Berlin Physical Society, which was founded by du\nBois-Reymond and also counted among its members Brücke and Werner\nvon Siemens. Du Bois-Reymond founded the Physical Society to support\nexperiment and to banish vitalism from scientific research. For more\non Helmholtz’s early career and relationship with the Physical\nSociety, see Sulloway 1992, 14ff and 65ff, and Cahan 2012.  \nWhile Helmholtz did not contradict Müller by name in his writings\non physiology, Helmholtz’s research, in Müller’s and\nMagnus’s labs and later in his own labs in Bonn and\nKönigsberg, is in conflict with the doctrine of specific sense\nenergies (see Otis 2007, 129–130). Helmholtz proposes a\n“sign” theory, according to which sensations symbolize\ntheir stimuli, but are not direct copies of those stimuli. While\nMüller explains the correspondence between sensation and object\nby means of an innate configuration of sense nerves, Helmholtz argues\nthat we construct that correspondence by means of a series of learned,\n“unconscious inferences.”  \nIn his sign theory of perception as expressed in his early career\n(1848–1868), Helmholtz argues that the mind makes a series of\nmental adjustments, “unconscious inferences,” to construct\na coherent picture of its experiences. Helmholtz argues that spatial\nposition, often used as a criterion to individuate objects, is an\ninterpretation of our sensations, and not their immediate result.\nAgain, stereoscopic vision shows that what may appear, to us, as a\nsingle image is in fact two images resolved into one. Perspective can\ndistort size, as when one puts a finger in front of the moon.\nHelmholtz believes that we learn how to interpret spatial concepts\nthrough experience, which means that he has what he calls an empirical\ntheory of spatial perception. This theory coexists, in\nHelmholtz’s epistemology, with his above commitment to the sign\ntheory, according to which spatial properties are only properties of\nrepresentations. Helmholtz’s invention of the ophthalmoscope in\n1850–1851 contributed to his understanding of the physiology of\nperception (Schett 1999; for images of the original Helmholtz\nophthalmoscope see De Schweinitz and Randall 1899, 172ff).\nPhilosophically, Helmholtz’s epistemology commits him to the\nview that representations arise in a physical process, but are signs\nand not copies of their objects.  \nHelmholtz was inspired by the theory of\n Hermann Lotze\n (1817–1881) in his explanation of these phenomena. For Lotze,\nHelmholtz observes, “to the sensations from spatially distinct\nnerve endings correspond various determinate Localzeichen\n[literally: place signs], whose spatial meaning is learned”\n(Helmholtz 1968 [1869], 57). My various sensations of my finger are\noriginally unrelated, but I can relate them to each other by means of\nthe concept “my finger,” which serves as a mental\nLocalzeichen that contains the data of all the sensations.\nThe space of perception is a general Localzeichen that\nrelates all possible sensations to each other. The usefulness of\nLotze’s theory is that all psychological sensations are mapped\ndirectly onto mental concepts, and even space becomes a tool for\nconstructing an interpretation of sense-data, akin to a language.  \nAccording to Helmholtz’s explanations of the physiology of\nperception, the qualities of sensations “belong only to our\nnervous system,” and we acquire our knowledge of spatial\nordering through perceiving an unchanging sequence of sense\nimpressions of the same object: \nAs a concrete example of a judgment of relative spatial position,\nHelmholtz gives the case of someone grasping a pen in her fingers. She\ncannot infer directly from the sensation of the pen that it is in one\nplace, because each finger feels only the position of the pen relative\nto the finger itself. She would have exactly the same sensations if\nher fingers were touching two or three different pens, separated in\nspace. The belief that the pen is in one place only is based on her\nknowledge that his fingers are close enough together that only one pen\nwill fit between them. As Helmholtz remarks, \nHelmholtz argues that perceived properties such as separation in space\nare well-founded inferences from two sources of knowledge: our\nexperience, and the properties of our sense organs. For Helmholtz,\nknowledge of the way our physiology works in perception is essential\nto any epistemological account of spatial properties. Helmholtz argues\nthat the more we know about the physiology of perception, the more\naccurate our inferences about our experience will be. In the case of a\nperson grasping a pen or touching a grain of sand, Helmholtz argues\nthat we become aware that the object touched is a single object by\nstudying the position of our sense organs: the nerve endings in our\nfingers, in this case. Our awareness of distinction of spatial\nposition, necessary for depth perception and perception of distance,\nis learned and not innate. Lenoir (2006) is a rich history of\nHelmholtz’s influences on this score, including Johann Herbart,\nWilhelm Wundt, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and an analysis of\nHelmholtz’s theory of perception as\n“operationalizing” the Kantian view. \nIn Helmholtz’s early work, and in some later essays, perceptual\nspace is a mental generalization of our orientation with respect to\nobjects in space. We learn the general properties of space by\ndiscovering what spatial properties do not change when objects move,\nand when we move relative to the objects. The insight that the\nspatially relevant properties of objects are the properties that\nremain invariant when objects change position, or when we change\nposition relative to the objects, is fundamental to Helmholtz’s\nlater work on topology. \nIn the third part of Helmholtz’s Handbook of Physiological\nOptics, Helmholtz draws a distinction between nativism and\nempiricism in the physiology of perception. In drawing up the\nHandbook, Helmholtz’s “task was to survey the\nfield of physiological optics for the purpose of writing a work that\nwould appear as volume nine of Karsten’s Encyklopädie\nder Physik. The format of the Karsten series dictated that\nHelmholtz provide a thorough review of both past and present work, a\ntask he performed diligently. Wishing to provide a systematic\ntheoretical framework for his survey of the field, Helmholtz divided\nthe major theoretical positions with respect to spatial perception\ninto two groups, which he characterized with the adjectives\nempiristisch and nativistisch” (Hatfield 1991,\n274–275. I follow Hatfield in translating the term\n“empirismus” as “empirism.”). Turner (1993)\nhas argued that Helmholtz’s empirism was pragmatic – that\nHelmholtz adopted an empirist stance to meet the challenges of\n“imposing order on a chaotic new field of investigation”\nand of defending his stance in his lifelong debate with Ewald Hering\n(Turner 1993,155).  \nSignificant questions in the empirism – nativism debate include\nhow to explain perception of depth and relief (Turner 1993, 156). The\n“projection” theory explained relief perception by\nclaiming that the mind interprets visual cues to construct a combined,\nrelief picture out of two flat pictures provided by the eyes (Turner\n1993, 158). By 1867, when Helmholtz published his Handbook of\nPhysiological Optics, Helmholtz had developed his\n“sign” theory, according to which the brain’s\nconstruction of phenomena such as depth and separation in space is\nlearned. This account brought Helmholtz into conflict with Hering.\n \nThe debate between Helmholtz and Hering focused on several specific\ncases, in particular, how to account for the so-called\n“horopter” problem. The horopter is the set of points that\nthe eye perceives as equidistant from the perceiving subject when the\neye is focusing on a single point. The eye perceives points on the\nhoropter as if they were lying on a straight line at a fixed distance\nfrom the eye. However, in reality the horopter line is a curve, that\nis, in reality the points are not equally distant from the eye.  \nWhen looking at a single object, some points on the object stimulate\nboth eyes, but some points stimulate only the right or the left eye.\nThe brain resolves these common and distinct stimuli into a single\nimage (Hershenson 1999, 29–30). The fact that the brain must\nresolve two distinct images into one accounts for the horopter effect.\nWhen the eyes are focusing on a single point, the left and the right\neyes give different inputs to the brain about objects to the left or\nright of the point of focus. The brain corrects for the different\ninputs coming from the left and the right eyes by representing them as\nequally distant from the eyes as the object of focus. \nHering and Helmholtz disagree, not about the empirical results or the\nconcept of the horopter itself, but about how to explain the\nbrain’s resolution of two images into one. Helmholtz argues that\nthe brain adjusts the retinal images by a process of\n“unconscious inferences.” Helmholtz contends that a\nchild’s brain learns to respond to stimuli as the child\ndevelops, and that the brain unconsciously adjusts itself to produce a\ncoherent experience — for instance, to resolve retinal\ndisparities. For recent work on unconscious inference see De Kock\n2014a, De Kock 2014b, Patton 2018, Patton forthcoming. \nHering argues that the ability to experience objects as a single,\nspatially ordered image is a disposition inborn in human children, and\nnot acquired. While children may not be born with the ability to\nresolve two images into one, Hering claims that the ability develops\nwhen a child grows to maturity, and is not learned. Hering argues that\ndepth perception and stereoscopic vision are inherent physical\nabilities, like running or even breathing, that can be honed but are\nnot learned wholesale from experience. In fact, to Hering, the\nadjustments the brain and eyes make to different inputs are automatic\nand involuntary, like a heartbeat. Helmholtz contends that depth\nperception and stereoscopic vision require reciprocal adjustment to\nobjects and thus are skills that must be learned through experience,\nlike shaving in front of a mirror (an example he takes from\nMüller, see Otis 2007, 129). When shaving in front of a mirror,\none must learn to distinguish right from left in the mirror, and to\nturn the right or left side of one’s face to the mirror\ncorrectly, even though the apparent motion in the mirror is the\nopposite of the felt motion in one’s body. Helmholtz argues that\nthe ability to shave in front of a mirror cannot be innate, because it\nrequires learned adjustments to the properties of one’s\nenvironment, that reflections in a mirror are inverted, for instance.\n \nOtis (2007) and Turner (1993) argue that the most significant\ndifference between Hering and Helmholtz is not in their distinct\nexplanations of the empirical evidence. Rather, the difference is in\nthe epistemological consequences of their higher-order commitments. If\nHelmholtz is right, then our access to objective properties is not\ndirect, but constructed. In his early “sign” theory,\nHelmholtz argues that perceptions of objects are not impressions like\nthe imprint of a key on wax, but are symbols or signs of their\nobjects, as a name is a symbol of a person. For Helmholtz, the degree\nof resemblance between perception and object may be as remote as the\ndegree of resemblance between a written name and the physical person\nto whom the name refers (Helmholtz 1882, 2:608, Helmholtz 1903,\n1:41ff; cited in Schiemann 1998, 26). Hering objects strenuously to\nthese epistemological consequences of Helmholtz’s sign theory,\nand argues that we have direct access to real objects in perception.\n \nThere is significant debate over the question of how far\nHelmholtz’s theory was influenced by Kantianism. David Galaty,\nNicholas Pastore, and David Leary have argued that Helmholtz was\nKantian in his approach (Galaty 1971, 159–66; Pastore 1978,\n355–76; and Leary 1982, 36; cited in Hatfield 1991, 325). As\nMichael Heidelberger has observed recently, the Neo-Kantian Alois\nRiehl refers to Kant as a “man of the physiologists,” and\nRiehl refers to Helmholtz’s “Kantian understanding of\nsensory perception,” although Heidelberger himself may not read\nHelmholtz as a Kantian (Riehl 1876, v and 5; Heidelberger 2007, 30).\nGary Hatfield and Edwin Boring have argued that Helmholtz’s\nempiricism outweighs his Kantianism. Boring’s classic history of\npsychology inaugurated the contemporary reading of Helmholtz as an\nempiricist or empirist (Boring 1942, chapter 15). Hatfield argues\nthat, while Helmholtz maintained some Kantian doctrines for a time,\nhis mature view departs from Kantianism (Hatfield 1991,\n325–326), and Lenoir concurs (2006, 200–204). In a 1918\narticle, the Marburg Neo-Kantian Ernst Cassirer supports this mixed\nreading of Helmholtz. According to Cassirer, although\nHelmholtz’s view was “linked deliberately to Kant,”\nand Helmholtz was very influential in the origins of Neo-Kantianism,\nHelmholtz made the a priori dependent on the results of natural\nscience, a significant departure from Kantianism (Cassirer 2005\n[1918], 96). Edgar (2018) addresses the broader question of the place\nof Helmholtz in the neo-Kantian tradition. \nA recent exchange centers on the influence of Johann Gottlieb Fichte\non Helmholtz’s work. Heidelberger (1995) and De Kock (2018)\nemphasize the influence of Fichtean idealist philosophy on Helmholtz,\nnoting, for instance, that Fichte’s distinction between the\n“I” and the “not-I” is employed in\nHelmholtz’s analysis of perceptual experience and in the\ndistinction between subjectivity and objectivity. Hatfield (2018)\nresponds that Helmholtz “rejected Fichtean idealism” and\nwas influenced more profoundly by empirical physiologists of\nperception, including Müller and Wundt but also Johann Georg\nSteinbuch and Caspar Theobald Tourtual. Hatfield argues that\nHelmholtz’s view in 1867 is better understood as “a form\nmodest realism, a kind of structural realism” avant la lettre,\n“and that, in 1878, he consolidated this position in a way that\nrenders it metaphysical” (2018, 33). \nSwanson (2016) has argued that the ‘predictive processing’\nparadigm in contemporary cognitive and computational neuroscience has\nroots in Kant and Helmholtz. Predictive processing means\n“perception involves the use of a unified body of acquired\nknowledge (a multi-level ‘generative model’) to predict\nthe incoming sensory barrage” (Clark 2015). As Swanson notes,\n“The current PP paradigm emerged from early work on generative\nmodels, and this work explicitly identifies itself as being directly\ninspired by … Hermann von Helmholtz … For example, the\nseminal article on the use of generative models in machine perception,\ntitled ‘The Helmholtz Machine,’ states that\n‘Following Helmholtz, we view the human perceptual system as a\nstatistical inference engine whose function is to infer the probable\ncauses of sensory input’” (Swanson 2016, 10; Dayan et al.,\n1995, 89).  \nTracz (2018) defends a reading that Helmholtz is a relationalist about\nperceptual properties, drawing on a related argument from Allais\n(2015) that transcendental idealism is a form of relationalism.\n“Helmholtz’s relationalism should be of interest to readers of\nKant, for according to one of the main strands of interpretation,\nKant’s transcendental idealism treats all properties that appear in\nperception as relational properties” (2018, 65). Moreover,\n“relationalism, particularly color relationalism, is alive in\ncontemporary philosophy of perception (e.g., Chirimuuta 2015, Cohen\n2009). Despite this, the history of relationalism is rarely\nthematized, so Helmholtz’s views provide some historical context of\ninterest to present work in philosophy of perception” (Tracz\n2018, 65). \nPatton (forthcoming) supports this reading, adding that “While\nthe relationalist reading of Helmholtz is certainly defensible, it is\nnot the end of the story: restricting ourselves to an argument\naccording to which Helmholtz only is defending contemporary\nrelationalism would risk losing some of the force and complexity of\nHelmholtz’s view... for Helmholtz, habit and inference – and even\ndeliberate interference – can change the relational properties\ninvolved, and thus change my perceptual experience... for Helmholtz,\nFechner, and Weber, perceptual experience of complex phenomena like\nmusic and colored objects is not reducible to the ground-level sensory\nresponse to physical stimuli.” \nEven when he was writing about physiology, Helmholtz’s vocation\nas a mathematical physicist was apparent. Helmholtz used mathematical\nreasoning to support his arguments for the sign theory, rather than\nexclusively philosophical or empirical evidence. Throughout his\ncareer, Helmholtz’s work is marked by two preoccupations:\nconcrete examples and mathematical reasoning. Helmholtz’s early\nwork in physiology of perception gave him concrete examples of how\nhumans perceive spatial relations between objects. These examples\nwould prove useful to illustrate the relationship between metric\ngeometry and the spatial relations between objects of perception.\nLater, Helmholtz used his experience with the concrete science of\nhuman perception to pose a problem for the Riemannian approach to\ngeometry.  \nHelmholtz’s work on geometry was made public from 1868, the year\nhe gave a lecture, “On the Actual Foundations of\nGeometry,” in Heidelberg, and published his “On the Facts\nUnderlying Geometry.” The latter “astonished” the\nacademic public, who had considered Helmholtz primarily an\nexperimental scientist and physiologist (Königsberger 1906, 254).\nHowever, Helmholtz had initially wanted to be a physicist, and had\nalways been alive to the mathematical consequences of his work in\nphysiology. Riemann’s work revolutionized mathematics and\nphysics, and philosophy by extension, and Helmholtz was perhaps the\nfirst to recognize the extent of the revolution. Indeed, Helmholtz\nclaimed that he had come to results similar to Riemann’s, though\nperhaps slightly later. Although the publication of Riemann’s\nHabilitationsrede, “On the Hypotheses Underlying\nGeometry,” meant that Helmholtz’s own results would not be\nseen as original, Helmholtz says in his own essay that he is content\nthat “so distinguished a mathematician [as Riemann] should have\nconsidered these questions as worthy of his attention”\n(Helmholtz 1883 [1868], cited in Königsberger 261). With his 1868\nessay, Helmholtz saw himself as contributing to the Riemannian\napproach to the foundations of geometry (Königsberger 1906, 254).\nHelmholtz’s title, “On the Facts Underlying\nGeometry,” is a deliberate echo of Riemann’s “On the\nHypotheses Underlying Geometry.” The difference in the titles,\nfacts versus hypotheses, underscores the fact that while\nHelmholtz’s approach is very similar to Riemann’s, there\nis at least one significant difference. \nIn “On the Hypotheses Underlying Geometry,” Riemann\nfocuses on how to determine the overall topological properties of\nspace. Topological properties are those spatial properties of figures\nthat are invariant under transformation, that is, that stay the same\nwhen the figures move. Riemann proves that a space of n dimensions,\nthat is, a space determined by n continuously and independently\nvarying magnitudes, has constant curvature, but only under the\nhypothesis that all spatial figures can be moved or rotated anywhere\nin space without changing their form, the so-called “Axiom of\nFree Mobility” (cf. Königsberger 1906, 260–261). For\nthe case of astronomy, Riemann observes:  \nThe assumption “that bodies exist independently of place”\nis valid if and only if the properties of bodies remain invariant when\nmoved. That is, if a body changes place, that is a movement, and if\nthe body continues to have the same properties in any different place,\nthen its properties are invariant under transformation. Riemann goes\non to say that, without this assumption, the units of comparison that\nare the basis for astronomical and other measurements — rays of\nlight as the shortest path between two points, rigid bodies like meter\nsticks as the basis of distance measurement — no longer have the\ninvariant properties on which one can base valid measurements.  \nIn “On the Facts Underlying Geometry,” Helmholtz\ninvestigates a related, but distinct question. He agrees with Riemann\nthat geometry is not possible unless we can compare figures to each\nother and measure them, and that measurement is not possible unless at\nleast some properties of the figures we are measuring do not change\nwhen the figures move. Helmholtz asks, what are the most general\naxioms of geometry that must hold for such motions, motions preserving\nthe spatial properties of figures, to be possible? \nHelmholtz presents the idea of “rigid motions” to account\nfor these invariant properties. “Rigid motions” are those\nmotions that preserve a set of properties of the objects. For\ninstance, when a sphere rotates around its central vertical axis, that\nmotion preserves the sphere’s symmetries about the x and y axes,\nand thus these symmetries are invariant under that particular\ntransformation (rotation). A given object may have a group of\nproperties that remain invariant under transformation and a group that\nchange, that is, when objects move in a certain way they may stretch\nor lose symmetry about an axis. After the publication of\nHelmholtz’s work, Sophus Lie argued that rigid motions form\ngroups, and described the set of rigid motions in the mathematical\nterms of group theory. \nWhile Riemann tries to describe the general properties of space,\nHelmholtz asks what the most general geometrical axioms are that can\naccount for our empirical measurement of objects. These will be the\naxioms that preserve observed rigid motions, given an underlying\nsystem of geometry. Helmholtz investigates the question of which\nsystems of geometry (Euclidean, Lobachevskian, and Riemannian) are\npossible under which assumptions. Here Helmholtz makes an initial\nmistake, and argues that only Euclidean geometry can account for our\nactual physical measurements. In April 1869, Eugenio Beltrami pointed\nout in a letter to Helmholtz that Lobachevskian geometry could be\nadequate to the task under the assumption that we live in a\n“pseudosphere” (see Other Internet Resources). Helmholtz\nconcedes the point immediately (Königsberger 1906, 263). In 1870,\nin “On the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,” Helmholtz investigates in much closer detail the\nquestion of whether non-Euclidean geometries can be visualized. This\nessay, perhaps even more than “On the Facts Underlying\nGeometry,” was widely influential. Moritz Schlick and Hans\nReichenbach engaged with Helmholtz’s views in the 1870 essay\n(see, e.g., Reichenbach 1920, Schlick’s notes to Helmholtz\n1921). A related article, “The Origin and Meaning of Geometrical\nAxioms,” was published in Mind in 1878, and Russell\nresponds to it in his doctoral dissertation. \nIn Space, Number, and Geometry from Helmholtz to Cassirer,\nFrancesca Biagioli (2016) analyzes Helmholtz’s theories of\ngeometry and of measurement, including their origins in the work of\nKant, Riemann, and Gauss, and the reception, development, and\nextension of Helmholtz’s work through engagement with Felix\nKlein’s Erlanger Programm, Sophus Lie’s theory of groups,\nthe conventionalism of Henri Poincaré, and neo-Kantian reception in\nAlois Riehl, Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Bruno Bauch.  \nBiagioli (2016), Biagioli (2014), and Biagioli (2018) deal with the\nquestion of how Helmholtz and neo-Kantians, especially Ernst Cassirer,\ncould claim that space is transcendental without also arguing for the\nuniversality of Euclidean geometry.  \nMarco Giovanelli (2017) argues that the mathematical core of the\ndevelopment of special relativity is found in the Riemannian tradition\nand especially in the work of Christoffel, Lipschitz, Ricci, and,\nlater, Levi-Civitá (Giovanelli 2017, 328). Giovanelli argues that the\nclaims for the Helmholtzian tradition as the sole progenitor of\nspecial relativity are exaggerated, and that the real development was\na ‘collision’ of traditions, in the sense well known from\nJohn Norton’s paper on the Kleinian and Riemannian traditions in\ngeneral relativity. \nDarrigol (2003), Biagioli (2016), Paula Cantù (2018), and Matthias\nNeuber (Neuber 2018a, Neuber 2018b) delve into Helmholtz’s work\non the theory of measurement, including his essay “Über Zählen\nund Messen,” as a precursor of more recent treatments of the\ntopic. Cantù focuses on the question of the applicability of\nmathematics in general, a question also found in Frege, Hale, Wright,\nand Batitsky, while Neuber and Biagioli focus on Helmholtz’s\naccount of the a priori and empirical conditions for measurement in\nphysics and mathematics.  \nFor more detailed explanations of the notions in this section, see the\nentry on\n 19th century geometry.\n  \nSee Section 7 of this entry for references to work on the\nphilosophical implications of Helmholtz’s theory of\ngeometry. \nFrom 1841 to 1842, Helmholtz finished his studies with Johannes\nMüller in Berlin. As seen above in the section on physiology,\nMüller’s endorsement of experimental science was in\npragmatic conflict with his commitment to Naturphilosophie,\nand in particular, to vitalism. According to vitalist theories, in\naddition to the mechanical and physical forces present in a living\nbody, there is a “vital force” that makes the parts of the\nbody work together as an organism. The term for momentum, vis viva,\nillustrates the belief. In the early part of the 19th\ncentury, Ernst Heinrich Weber argued that the so-called “vital\nforces” are in fact physical forces, and he argued that the most\npressing problem for 19th century physiology was to explain\nthe so-called vital forces in physical terms, and thus to banish\nvitalism. According to at least one account, Müller took his cue\nfrom Weber in setting problems for the students working in his lab,\nincluding Helmholtz, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Rudolf Virchow, and Ernst\nBrücke, although Müller knew that Weber’s view was\ninconsistent with his own commitments (Königsberger 1906, 25). It\nis evidence in favor of this view that in 1843, Müller published\nHelmholtz’s first essay, “On the Nature of Fermentation\nand Putrefaction,” written in support of Justus von\nLiebig’s anti-vitalist arguments against spontaneous generation,\nin his own journal, Müller’s Archiv. \nAfter receiving his medical degree in 1842, Helmholtz worked as a\nmilitary surgeon in Potsdam from 1843 to 1848. However, he took\nfrequent trips to Berlin to work in Gustav Magnus’s lab, and to\ntalk with Müller’s other former students and with Carl\nLudwig. As mentioned above, in 1845 Helmholtz joined the Berlin\nPhysical Society, which du Bois-Reymond and Brücke founded with\nthe express intention of banishing vitalism. Also in 1845, Helmholtz\ntook a five month leave from his work as a surgeon to take his\nqualifying exams. He used the time to work in the lab in Berlin, and\ncontinued to focus on the consequences of Weber’s and\nLiebig’s attacks on vitalism.  \nLiebig had focused attention on the question of whether an\norganism’s metabolism produces all its heat and mechanical\nenergy. If so, then appealing to a vital force to explain these\nphenomena would be superfluous. Through experiments on frogs’\nmuscles using electrical currents, Helmholtz showed that the heat the\nfrogs’ muscles produced was accounted for by metabolism and\nmuscular action. He published his results in 1845, again in\nMüller’s journal, in “On Metabolism during Muscular\nActivity” (see Bevilacqua 1993, 297ff). Helmholtz realized,\nagain in 1845, that the question of whether forces could be accounted\nfor by mechanical means had a much more general application. The\npresupposition of vitalism, that there is an inexhaustible\n“vital force” that powers living bodies, had led some\ninvestigators to posit that there is an inexhaustible force, whether\nmechanical or not, that can power a machine indefinitely: a perpetual\nmotion machine, perpetuum mobile. The realization was\nprompted by Helmholtz’s study of the 18th century classics of\nmathematical analysis: Euler, Bernoulli, D’Alembert, and\nLagrange. As Helmholtz remarked years later, by the end of the 18th\ncentury these mathematicians had established the impossibility of a\nperpetual motion machine powered by mechanical forces: \nBut what about the non-mechanical forces: heat, light, electricity and\nmagnetism? When Helmholtz started to look into the question of the\ncharacter of non-mechanical forces, instead of looking for perpetual\nmotion, he asked “if perpetual motion is impossible, what is the\nrelationship between natural forces that must hold?”  \nOn the 23rd of July in 1847, Helmholtz gave an address, “The\nConservation of Force,” at the Physical Society.\n“Force” [Kraft], as Helmholtz uses it, is equivalent to\nthe modern term “energy.” Helmholtz’s address was\nvery well received by the Society, but Helmholtz was forced to publish\nit as a pamphlet after Poggendorff rejected it for his\nAnnalen as too speculative.  \nHelmholtz summarizes his conclusions in the essay as follows: \nHelmholtz argues that a proof that all natural actions can be\naccounted for by universal action at a distance is equivalent to a\nrefutation of perpetual motion.  \nIn 1842–1843, Robert Mayer and James Joule had formulated\nprinciples of the conservation of energy. Their work asserted the\nconservation of mv2, the mass of a particle times the\nsquare of its velocity. Further, Joule and Mayer argued that heat and\nmechanical work are interchangeable (see Kuhn 1969, Mach 1911).\nHelmholtz called on Joule’s work (though he claimed to be\nunaware of Meyer’s) to achieve three results. As Bevilaqua\n(1993) sums it up, Helmholtz concluded that that: \nAs Bevilacqua goes on to say, the main innovation of Helmholtz’s\nwork was to unite two fields, and to anticipate the integration of\npotential energy into mechanics: \nWhile Helmholtz’s work was published in pamphlet form in\nGermany, it was picked up quickly by English scientists and published\nin English translation almost immediately. Helmholtz’s work\nbecame known quickly in English scientific and philosophical circles,\nwhich contributed to his lasting influence in both fields (see Cahan\n2012). \nHelmholtz acknowledged in his essay that earlier scientists, including\nJoule, Newton, Bernoulli, and Rumford, had arrived at various forms of\nthe principle of energy conservation. In his history of mechanics,\nErnst Mach argues that some form of Helmholtz’s principle was\nknown to “almost all eminent investigators” in history\n(Mach 1911, 20). In his landmark study of energy conservation, Thomas\nKuhn presents the work of Joule, Mayer, and others from the\n1830’s, which argues that heat and work can be substituted for\neach other quantitatively, which is a significant component of\nHelmholtz’s principle (Kuhn 1969, 321). Kuhn argues that the\ndiscovery of the principle of energy conservation is a case in which\nseveral scientists lay the experimental and conceptual framework for a\nprinciple together.  \nKuhn does insist that Helmholtz formulated the principle. Robert\nPurrington observes, following Kuhn, that “There was a widely\nheld, intuitive view that the total quantity of force (or motion)\nmight be somehow constant, but it did not necessarily imply an ability\nto distinguish the vector nature of force or momentum from the scalar\nenergy” (Purrington 1997, 105). In his “Philosophical\nIntroduction” to the essay, Helmholtz himself argues that his\ntask in the essay is not to find new experimental evidence or a\ncompletely new principle, but rather to explain the “unknown\ncauses” of the phenomena from their “visible\nactions” according to the “laws of causality”:  \nFor the philosophical implications of Helmholtz’s work on the\nconservation of energy, see Bevilacqua (1993) and Hyder (2006 and\n2009). Bevilacqua investigates two matters: Hemholtz’s synthesis\nof earlier work into a single principle, and his methodological\ndistinction, evident in the above citation, between theoretical and\nexperimental physics. Hyder investigates Helmholtz’s argument in\nthe essay that “force functions must be definable with regard\nonly to the relative positions of the mass-points comprising a\nphysical system” (Hyder 2006, 1). Marshalling the Kantian\nantecedents of the argument, Hyder maintains that Helmholtz’s\nresponse to criticisms of “On the Conservation of Force”\nby Clausius in 1854 influenced Helmholtz’s later work on\ngeometry. Hyder 2009 is an analysis of Helmholtz’s\n“radical critique” of Kantian geometry in the context of\nHelmholtz’s retention of a “transcendental element”\nin physics, especially with respect to the relationship between\ngeometry and empirical determinacy (p. 19). \nIn 1857, Helmholtz published “On the Integrals of the\nHydrodynamic Equations which Express Vortex-Motion” in\nCrelle’s Journal für die reine und angewandte\nMathematik. Königsberger observes that this essay was a\n“work of genius that proved him to be a mathematician of first\nrank” (Königsberger 1906, 167).  \nHelmholtz knew of Euler’s and Lagrange’s previous\nmathematical formulas describing fluid motion. Euler’s equation\ntreated fluids as continua or fields, whereas Lagrange’s\nformulation treats them as discrete particles (see Emanuel 2000, 8).\nHelmholtz took up Euler’s equation, which gives the equations of\nthe flow of fluids in which friction does not alter the fluid’s\nmotion significantly (the “inviscid” fluids). Lagrange had\nremarked that Euler’s equations did not work for\n“viscous” fluids, in which the fluid’s friction\nalters its movement, because Euler’s equations work only on the\nassumption of a general conservation law, and viscous forces are not\nconservative (Farge 2004, cf. Königsberger 1906, 167). \nHelmholtz, who had formulated a conservation law ten years previously\nin “On the Conservation of Force,” entered the field at\nthis point. Helmholtz’s own work had concentrated on applying\nthe notion of a potential to fluid movement. But viscous forces do not\nhave potentials. Helmholtz decided to disregard the viscous forces\nthemselves, but also to redefine the problem without appealing to\npotentials. He defined the “vorticity” of a fluid in a\nsmall region as its average rotation or circulation in that region:\nthe rotation at each point on the boundary of the region divided by\nthe area of the region, which is described mathematically as the curl\nof the velocity of the fluid. (In technical terms, Helmholtz evaluated\nthis as the curl of Euler’s equation.) The vorticity of a fluid\nat a single point is a vector quantity. Helmholtz introduced two\nfurther idealizations. A “vortex line” is the tangent to\nthe vorticity vector of a point in the fluid. If you draw vortex lines\non the boundary of a region of the fluid, and then make the region\naround each line indefinitely small, the lines will converge to\n“vortex filaments,” now also called\n“vortices.”  \nHelmholtz was able to prove three theorems in fluid dynamics using\nthese notions. In their modern expression, they are: \nThese laws are used still in fluid dynamics, though they are modified\nslightly from Helmholtz’s original version (they are cited above\nin the contemporary, modified form).  \nHelmholtz’s work on fluid dynamics is significant\nphilosophically because Helmholtz’s equations requires\nideal fluids, that is, fluids that are free from viscosity\nand perfect continua. Helmholtz’s equations are a paradigm case\nof mathematical idealizations in physics. For a discussion of\nHelmholtz’s work in this context, including his discussions with\nGustav Kirchhoff and the notion, very significant in contemporary\nfluid dynamics, of Helmholtz-Kelvin instability (or Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability), see Eckert 2006, 19ff. For accounts of Helmholtz’s\nuse of idealizations in physics and of the development and\nsignificance of his work in fluid dynamics, see Patton 2009 and\n2012. \nIn 1863, a professor of physiology at Bonn, Helmholtz published his\npioneering work on sound waves, acoustics, and musical theory in\nOn the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory\nof Music. One of the most significant discoveries in On the\nSensations of Tone  is the precise mathematical description of\n“sound vibrations in an open cylindrical tube”\n(Königsberger 1906, 206). Helmholtz begins On the Sensations\nof Tone with a description of noise as we experience it in\nordinary life: \nTo analyze the “rapid alternations” of these noises into\ntheir component vibrations, Helmholtz constructed the “Helmholtz\nresonator.” Helmholtz began by removing the bottom of an empty,\nuncorked wine bottle, stretching a membrane over the bottom, and\nfastening the membrane with a band. Then he suspended a single thread,\nwith a bit of wax on the end, from the band so that it hung halfway\ndown the membrane. If the thread is agitated, the bit of wax hits the\nmembrane as a drumstick hits a drum. Based on experimental evidence\nand mathematical reasoning, Helmholtz argued that there will be a\nsingle tone, the “prime tone,” that is the tone at which\nthe membrane vibrates at the highest frequency, based on the thickness\nand size of the membrane. By performing experiments, Helmholtz was\nable to distinguish the prime tones of various membranes. Then if he\nplayed music or made noise, the vibration of the membranes would\nreveal the component vibrations of the sound. \nThen Helmholtz had the idea of constructing more sophisticated\nresonators, made of spheres or cylinders of glass or metal. The\nresonators narrow to a small, hollow point at one end, and have a\ncircular opening at the other. Helmholtz placed a small piece of hot\nwax at the small end, let it cool, and then inserted it into his ear\nor the ear of a subject. The prime tone of such a resonator is\ndetermined by its own composition and by the sympathetic vibrations of\nthe ear. If a sound other than the prime tone of the resonator plus\near system is played, the listener hears only muffled noises, but\n“if the proper tone of the resonator is sounded, it brays into\nthe ear most powerfully” (Helmholtz 1954 [1863], 43). Again,\nusing resonators allows an experimenter to distinguish the component\nvibrations of music or ordinary noises, by first determining the prime\nor proper tone of the resonator, and then determining, using the\nresonator, whether the music or noise contains that tone. \nHeller (2012) considers Helmholtz’s most enduring contributions\nto be his theories of dissonance and musical harmony (p. 441). In the\ntheory of pitch, Heller analyzes a debate between “Helmholtz and\nGeorg Ohm on one side and Rudolf Koenig and August Seebeck on the\nother”, which engaged physicists and instrument makers alike for\ndecades (441ff.). Heller’s work provides an appreciation of the\nstrengths and weaknesses of Helmholtz’s work from the\nperspective of modern physics and acoustical theory. Deutsch 1984\nprovides a complementary perspective on Helmholtz’s place in the\nhistory of the physiology and psychology of music perception. \nHui 2011 and especially 2012 are detailed histories of research in\npsychophysics and in acoustics in 19th century Germany, which\nilluminate not only the social and cultural context, but also the\ndebates over scientific advances and experimental results. \nIt is typical of Helmholtz that, even as he was working on acoustics,\nhe realized that his work on sound waves could apply to related wave\nphenomena, if supplemented with mathematical reasoning and\nexperimentation. Recent work on electrodynamics supported the\nconclusion that electricity was a wave phenomenon. In 1845, Faraday\nhad demonstrated the connection between electric and magnetic\nphenomena. In 1856, Wilhelm Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch discovered the\nratio between electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge (Assis\n1994, 18). If he could describe sound vibrations in a cylindrical\ntube, Helmholtz reasoned, similar equations might be successful for\ndescribing the motion of electrical waves around a circular\nboundary. \nIn 1861, Helmholtz gave a lecture, “A Universal Method of the\nTransformation of Problems of Electrical Distribution,” to the\nSociety for Natural History and Medicine at Heidelberg. Helmholtz was\nunaware that, in letters to Liouville, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)\nhad achieved the same results that he had, but he was told of this\nimmediately afterward. Helmholtz, who had met Kelvin in 1855 and had\nbeen corresponding with him since 1856, acknowledged Kelvin’s\npriority in the Transactions of the Heidelberg society in 1862, and\nwrote to Kelvin to ask whether he would be willing to publish his\nresults about the “distribution of electricity at a circular\nedge” (Königsberger 1906, 206). Kelvin responded with his\nown results. Between 1861 and 1864, James Clerk Maxwell postulated\nthat light was an electromagnetic wave in the ether (Assis 1994, 18).\nIn 1864, Helmholtz traveled to England. During the trip, Helmholtz met\nwith Kelvin, John Tyndall, George Stokes, James Joule, Michael\nFaraday, Thomas Huxley, Thomas Graham, Max Müller, and Maxwell.\nHe visited Graham’s, Maxwell’s, and Kelvin’s\nlaboratories. By the end of the 1860’s, Helmholtz was well\ninformed on the experimental and theoretical basis of the new\nelectrodynamic theory in England.  \nIn 1870, Helmholtz published the first Part of “On the Theory of\nElectrodynamics,” “Equations of Motion of Electricity in\nConductors at Rest,” in Crelle’s Journal für die\nreine und angewandte Mathematik. In the essay, Helmholtz\nsupported Maxwell’s work, but criticized Wilhelm Weber’s\nelectrodynamic equations, charging that Weber’s equations posit\nan infinite kinetic energy, which contradicts Helmholtz’s\nconservation law of 1847. Weber and Helmholtz disputed the question\nthroughout the 1870’s. Over the next several years, Helmholtz\npublished two more Parts of “On the Theory of\nElectrodynamics,” in which he responded to Weber and continued\nto support Maxwell’s assertion that light is an electromagnetic\nwave in the ether. The debate between Helmholtz and Weber did not\nreach a conclusion until the end of the 1880s, when the explanation of\nelectromagnetic force in terms of action at a distance between\nparticles in the ether gave way to the field theory.  \nIn 1880, Helmholtz became the director of the Institute of Physics in\nBerlin. Between 1881 and 1884, Helmholtz attacked the question of how\nto integrate energy conservation and Maupertuis’s principle of\nleast action to describe thermodynamic and chemical processes. \nOver the 19th century, the application of the least action principle\ndominated the approach of analytical dynamics to physical problems.\nLagrangian mechanics seeks to determine the trajectory of a system of\nparticles over time by solving Lagrangian equations for the system.\nThese equations are formulated using the least action principle. In\nthe Lagrangian formalism, a system of particles follows a path that\nminimizes the action over time. Lagrange’s equations can be\napplied easily to systems of polar coordinates and of Cartesian\ncoordinates alike, a reason that the Lagrangian formalism was adopted\npreferentially over the 19th century.  \nWhile the Lagrangian formalism is well adapted to evaluating\nmechanical systems of particles, it is not as well suited to\nevaluating some transfers of energy, which involve calculations over a\nvast multitude of molecules. The Hamiltonian formalism is better\nsuited to this task. The Hamiltonian equations also evaluate the\naction in a system, but use an integral sum of the momenta of the\nelements of the system. In the simplest case, the Lagrangian deals\nwith the velocity of a particle and the Hamiltonian with the momenta\nof the particle. The Hamiltonian gives a minimum value for a function\nover any path given the initial and end states of the action. Thus,\nthe Hamiltonian formalism yields the same result, namely the\nmathematical determination of the path taken by a system. \nThe Hamiltonian expression of the momenta of the system can be derived\nfrom the Lagrangian, and vice versa, using a Legendre transform. In\nfact, the Hamiltonian just is the Legendre transform of the\nLagrangian for any given system. The formalisms are equivalent, but\nthere are some situations, including evaluating heat transfer, in\nwhich the Hamiltonian is preferred. \nIn 1882, Helmholtz gave an address, “The Thermodynamics of\nChemical Processes,” at the Berlin Academy. Up until\nHelmholtz’s address, chemical reactions had been explained by\n“chemical forces” or “affinities” between\nchemical substances, measured quantitatively by the heat developed\nduring a chemical reaction. Gustave Coriolis had clarified the notion\nof work as the product of force over distance in 1821, and this notion\nwas in common use by the late 19th century. In his address, Helmholtz\n“proved that affinity was not given by the heat evolved in a\nchemical reaction but rather by the maximum work produced when the\nreaction was carried out reversibly” (Kragh 1993, 405). However,\nwhile kinetic and mechanical energy can be converted into heat in\nevery case, only in restricted cases can heat be converted into\nkinetic and mechanical energy. Hence, the equations describing\nchemical processes involving heat could not always be reversed. These\nare the conditions under which the Legendre transform could not be\napplied, and thus the Hamiltonian could not be determined for that\nsystem. \nIn particular, the equations for a system containing heat as a\nvariable contain entropy as a variable quantity. Entropy is an\ninconvenient variable, difficult to control for and hold constant as\none can hold temperature, pressure, and volume constant. The Legendre\ntransform allows a researcher to convert equations containing entropy\ninto equations expressed only in terms of temperature, pressure, and\nvolume. The Legendre transform can be applied correctly only under\ncertain conditions, which must be specified.  \nHelmholtz proposed the notion of a “free energy” to\naccount for cases involving heat and entropy. The Helmholtz free\nenergy is defined as F ⇔ E − TS,\nwhere E is energy, T is temperature, and S\nis entropy. The free energy equation yields a quantity, F,\nthat is independent of heat and entropy. Many equations involving\nF and not T or S are fully reversible, and\nso Helmholtz’s work allowed for the application of the\nHamiltonian to many chemical processes. Hence while “Helmholtz\nwas neither the sole nor the most important contributor” to\ntheoretical chemistry, “his thermodynamic theory of\n1882–1883 was the pioneering work on which much of the new\ntheoretical chemistry rested” (Kragh 1993, 406). \nFor discussions of the philosophical and scientific implications of\nHelmholtz’s work in thermodynamics, see Kragh 1993 and Campisi\n2005.  \nBy the end of the 1870’s, the experimental basis of\nelectrodynamics had been established, but mathematics lagged behind.\nIn memoirs of his training, Arnold Sommerfeld recalls that until the\n1880’s, the laws of electromagnetic phenomena were constructed\nusing unwieldy extensions of Coulomb’s, Biot-Savart’s, and\nWeber’s generalizations of Newton’s laws (Sommerfeld 1952,\n1–2). Further, although the relationship between electric and\nmagnetic phenomena had been established, there was no direct empirical\nevidence for the existence of electromagnetic waves.  \nBetween 1870 and 1887, Helmholtz was Director of the Institute of\nPhysics at Berlin University. Between 1880 and 1933, the following\nscientists worked in Berlin: “Max Planck [Helmholtz’s\nstudent] and Albert Einstein above all, also Gustav Robert Kirchhoff,\nFriedrich Kohlrausch, Emil Warburg, Walther Nernst, Max von Laue,\nJames Franck, Gustav Hertz, Erwin Schrödinger, Peter Debye”\nand others (Hoffmann 1998, 1).  \nPerhaps the most significant relationship Helmholtz had with a student\nor colleague was with Heinrich Hertz. Beginning in 1878, Hertz did\nresearch as a graduate student in Helmholtz’s and\nKirchhoff’s laboratories. In 1879, Helmholtz set a prize problem\nfor the Prussian Academy of Science: “To establish\nexperimentally any relation between electromagnetic forces and the\ndielectric polarization of insulators” (von Harnack 1900, 617,\ncited Hoffmann 1998, 6). While Hertz was very interested in the\nproblem, he put it aside in 1879 to pursue other work. In 1880, Hertz\ngraduated and took a position as Helmholtz’s assistant. From\n1886 on in his own laboratory in Karlsruhe, Hertz performed his\nnow-famous experiments, which Hertz himself acknowledged were prompted\nby Helmholtz’s prize question, demonstrating the existence of\nradio waves (which are a kind of electromagnetic wave). Hertz\n“discussed his progress and results immediately and in great\ndetail with Helmholtz” (Hoffmann 1998, 6).  \nHertz’s experiments and their consequences finally laid to rest\nthe disputes between Helmholtz and Wilhelm Weber. Among those\nconsequences was the death of Helmholtz’s view that\nelectromagnetism is a kind of action at a distance, and the\nreplacement of the action at a distance view with a field theory,\n“one of the major turning points in the history of\nphysics” (Heidelberger 1998, 9). Since Hertz revealed empirical\nevidence for the existence of electromagnetic waves, “the\nsources of the electrodynamic effect are not anymore to be sought in\nagents that are hidden from our view but in the surrounding\nmedium” (Heidelberger 1998, 17). While Helmholtz supported\nMaxwell’s view that electromagnetism was a wave in the ether,\nHelmholtz explained wave propagation by means of action at a distance.\nHertz demonstrated that electromagnetic waves were perturbations in a\nmedium, which at the time was thought to be the ether, and which later\nwas re-conceived as a field. More importantly, Hertz explained the\npropagation of electromagnetic waves directly “from the\ninteractions themselves,” based on his empirical data, and thus\ndid not need to appeal to actions at a distance (Buchwald 1994,\n265ff). \nAlthough Hertz’s results were in conflict with his own theory,\nHelmholtz supported Hertz’s career with unflagging enthusiasm\nuntil Hertz’s death at the age of 37. Recent scholarship by Jed\nBuchwald emphasizes the influence of Helmholtz’s methods and\ntheory on Hertz’s discoveries (Buchwald 1994).  \nIn 1888 Helmholtz assumed the founding directorship of the\nPhysikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, an institute for the study of\nphysics and industrial technology in Berlin founded in part by\nHelmholtz’s lifelong associate Werner von Siemens. For a\ncomprehensive history of the institute that illuminates the history of\nHelmholtz’s later career, see Cahan 1989. Helmholtz retained the\npost until the end of his life.  \nFor philosophical treatments of the shift from action at a distance to\nfield theory, and from Helmholtz to Hertz, see Heidelberger 1998 and\nLeroux 2001. See also Purrington 1997.  \nIn 1921, 100 years after Helmholtz was born, Paul Hertz and Moritz\nSchlick brought out an edition of Helmholtz’s epistemological\nwritings: Schriften zur Erkenntnistheorie. This edition made\navailable “On the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,” “On the Facts Underlying Geometry,”\n“Numbering and Measuring from an Epistemological\nViewpoint,” and “The Facts in Perception.”\nSchlick’s part in the selection of work having to do with\ngeometry and empirical measurement is significant. Schlick, a close\nassociate of Einstein’s, saw the relevance Helmholtz’s\nwork had for Einstein’s theory. For a discussion of the\ninfluence of Helmholtz on the early career of Einstein, see Cahan\n2000, 70ff.  \nSchlick and Paul Hertz assess the relevance of Helmholtz’s work\nas follows: Helmholtz’s “classic works on physics —\none may for example recall the energy principle or his work on vortex\nmotions — stand at the end of lines of\ndevelopment….his work seems for science at its present stage to\nbe something completed and left behind. There is only one field, but a\nvery important one, to which this does not apply: it does not hold for\nHelmholtz’s epistemological studies” (Hertz and Schlick\n1977 [1921], xxxiv). In his Notes on “On the Origin and\nSignificance of the Axioms of Geometry,” Schlick sees the\n“chief epistemological result” of Helmholtz’s work\nin the replacement of the Kantian necessary a priori with a judgment\nthat “Euclidean space is not an inescapable form of our\nfaculty of intuition, but a product of experience”\n(Schlick’s note to Helmholtz 1921 [1868], 35).  \nFor a thorough discussion of the anti-Kantian implications of\n“On the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,” see DiSalle 1993, 516ff. DiSalle discusses\nHelmholtz’s famous debate with the Kantian J. P. N. Land, as\ndoes David Hyder (Hyder 2006, Land 1877). DiSalle also mentions that\nin 1972, Jürgen Ehlers, Felix Pirani, and Alfred Schild\n“derived the metric of general-relativistic spacetime from\nassumptions about falling bodies and light rays” (DiSalle 1993,\n520n). Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild note that their method “has\nsome similarity to Helmholtz’s derivation of the metrics of\nspaces of constant curvature” (Ehlers et al. 1972, 65).  \nDespite Schlick’s conviction that Helmholtz’s view is\nantithetical to Kantianism, Helmholtz’s notion that the a priori\nin space consists of the manifold of possible orientations in space\nhas inspired new readings of Kant’s a priori. This influence\ncomes partly through the mediation of Hans Reichenbach, whose reading\nof Helmholtz was significantly different from Schlick’s\n(Reichenbach 1920). Reichenbach and Schlick both pointed out the\nrelationship between the views of Helmholtz and those of\nPoincaré, though Schlick realizes that Helmholtz is not a\nconventionalist and Reichenbach may not have done (see Schlick’s\nnote 40 to Helmholtz 1921 [1868], 34). For a discussion of\nHelmholtz’s influence on Michael Friedman’s reading of\nKant, also influenced by Robert DiSalle, see Friedman 2000. Also see\nFriedman 2001, Chapter One.  \nIn The Mechanics of Meaning, David Hyder traces discussions\nof Helmholtz’s theory regarding “sensation-spaces and\ntheir relation to the philosophy of space and perception” by\nBoltzmann, Poincaré, Carnap, Russell, and Weyl (Hyder 2002,\n19n). De Kock 2013 is an analysis of the problem of externality in\nHelmholtz’s theory of perception. Biagioli (forthcoming)\nanalyzes Helmholtz’s debate with Albrecht Krause over the status\nof geometrical axioms; more generally, Biagioli’s work\nilluminates Helmholtz’s relationship to Poincaré and to\nHolder. Darrigol 2003 also places Helmholtz’s work in context,\nincluding with respect to related work by Grassmann, Fechner, and\nWundt. Darrigol’s focus is Helmholtz’s theory of number\nand measure in physics and mathematics. \nIn Hermann von Helmholtz’s Mechanism, Gregor Schiemann\nsees Helmholtz’s work in the sciences as characteristic of a\nshift from the early modern to the modern tradition, as emblematic of\nthe “relativization of claims to validity” of scientific\nknowledge, the “loss of certainty” characteristic of the\nmodern attitude toward science.  \nThe influence of Hertz, and indirectly Helmholtz, on Wittgenstein is\nargued by many. Brian McGuinness, Wittgenstein’s biographer, and\nPeter Hacker, in Insight and Illusion, are perhaps the first\nto have so argued (see, e.g., Grasshoff 1993, 243, Hacker 1986,\n2–4). Gerd Grasshoff traces the development in Grasshoff 1993,\narguing that Hertz and Boltzmann were the first to develop a\n“picture theory,” according to which physical and\nlinguistic theories give us pictures [Bilder in the original\nGerman] of the world. Hertz’s and Boltzmann’s picture\n(Bild) theories go well beyond Helmholtz’s view.\nHelmholtz argues that the constraints on using Bilder to\nconstruct scientific explanations are given by physical experience and\nnatural science, and Hertz and Boltzmann argue that these constraints\nare determined mathematically. However, according to this\ninterpretation, the historical roots of the picture theory can be\nfound in Helmholtz’s substitution of the “sign\ntheory” for nativistic explanations (see, e.g., Schiemann 1998,\nPatton 2009). According to Helmholtz’s “sign”\ntheory, our physical perceptions are images or symbols that do not\nresemble their objects directly. Michael Heidelberger and Jean Leroux\nargue as well for the influence of Helmholtz’s sign theory on\nHertz’s picture theory in Heidelberger 1998 and Leroux 2001. See\nsection 2 for a detailed discussion of the sign theory. \nIn his early writings, Helmholtz defends a broadly Kantian methodology\nagainst a more far-reaching idealism. In “On the Relation of\nNatural Science to Science in General”, Helmholtz opposes Kant\nto Hegel. Helmholtz argues that for Kant “a principle discovered\na priori was a rule applicable to the method of pure thought, and\nnothing further; it could contain no real, positive knowledge”\n(Helmholtz 1995 [1862], 79). For Hegel, on the other hand, “not\nonly the physical phenomena, but even the actual world…were the\nresult of an act of thought on the part of the creative mind”\n(ibid.). As a result, according to Helmholtz, Hegel attempted\nto unify the human and the natural sciences (the Geistes- and the\nNaturwissenschaften).  \nThe question of the independence of the methods of the human sciences,\nprominently including history, from the physical sciences became the\ntheme of heated debate over the 19th century. Wilhelm Dilthey (1883\n[1989]) defended the independence of the methods of the human\nsciences, while Wilhelm Windelband (1980/1894) argued that only the\nnatural, physical sciences are “nomothetic,” or\nlaw-governed, and thus genuinely scientific (see Beiser 2012 and\nPatton (forthcoming) for more detail on this debate and its\nhistory). \nIn an essay on the relation of the natural sciences to science in\ngeneral, Helmholtz observes that it is true that the human sciences\nbecame increasingly scientific over the first half of the 19th\ncentury. As a result, “the opposition between them and the\nphysical sciences has become less and less marked” (Helmholtz\n1995 [1862], 81). Helmholtz argues that nonetheless there is a\nprofound difference, and that, \nHelmholtz then addresses the old question of the “dispute of the\nfaculties” — is it better to separate the study of the\nnatural sciences from all others? He concludes that the logical\ninduction characteristic of natural sciences must always be\nsupplemented with the aesthetic induction of the human\nsciences, which draws conclusions about human character and behavior\n(Helmholtz 1995 [1862], 85). Helmholtz concludes that the best outcome\nfor human knowledge is to encourage the strengths of aesthetic and\nlogical induction, to maintain the presence of both in the same\nacademy, while keeping their foundations and methods strictly\nseparate. The Hegelian program of methodological and conceptual\nunification must give way to a separation between the\nGeisteswissenschaften and the Naturwissenschaften.\n \nHelmholtz observes that what he sees as the attempt by the Hegelian\nphilosophy to legislate for natural science resulted in the following\nimpasse:  \nHelmholtz concludes that once natural scientists, physiologists of\nperception such as himself, entered the philosophical fray, “the\npath of future investigation was basically prescribed by the inductive\nmethods of the natural sciences” (ibid. 394).\nHelmholtz’s work in epistemology epitomizes the return to the\nmethods of the natural sciences in the mid-19th century. See Patton\n(forthcoming) and Schiemann (2013) for more on the background of\nchanges to the approach to the sciences over the 19th century.","contact.mail":"critique@vt.edu","contact.domain":"vt.edu"}]
