He regarded it as\nthe principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts\nare formed. In this entry, we discuss Descartes’ views concerning the\npineal gland. We also put them into a historical context by describing\nthe main theories about the functions of the pineal gland that were\nproposed before and after his time.\n\n\n\nThe pineal gland or pineal body is a small gland in the middle of\nthe head. It often contains calcifications (“brain sand”)\nwhich make it an easily identifiable point of reference in X-ray images\nof the brain. The pineal gland is attached to the outside of the\nsubstance of the brain near the entrance of the canal (“aqueduct\nof Sylvius”) from the third to the fourth ventricle of the\nbrain.

(α) anterior cerebellar valvule; (β) anterior cerebral\nartery; \n It is nowadays known that the pineal gland is an endocrine organ,\nwhich produces the hormone melatonin in amounts which vary with the\ntime of day. But this is a relatively recent discovery. Long before it\nwas made, physicians and philosophers were already busily speculating\nabout its functions. \n\nThe first description of the pineal gland and the first speculations\nabout its functions are to be found in the voluminous writings of Galen\n(ca. 130-ca. 210 CE), the Greek medical doctor and philosopher who\nspent the greatest part of his life in Rome and whose system dominated\nmedical thinking until the seventeenth century. \n\nGalen discussed the pineal gland in the eighth book of his\nanatomical work On the usefulness of the parts of the body. He\nexplained that it owes its name (Greek: kônarion, Latin:\nglandula pinealis) to its resemblance in shape and size to the\nnuts found in the cones of the stone pine (Greek: kônos,\nLatin: pinus pinea). He called it a gland because of its\nappearance and said that it has the same function as all other glands\nof the body, namely to serve as a support for blood vessels. \n\nIn order to understand the rest of Galen’s exposition, the following\ntwo points should be kept in mind. First, his terminology was different\nfrom ours. He regarded the lateral ventricles of the brain as one\npaired ventricle and called it the anterior ventricle. He accordingly\ncalled the third ventricle the middle ventricle, and the fourth the\nposterior one. Second, he thought that these ventricles were filled\nwith “psychic pneuma,” a fine, volatile, airy or vaporous\nsubstance which he described as “the first instrument of the\nsoul.” (See Rocca 2003 for a detailed description of Galen’s\nviews about the anatomy and physiology of the brain.) \n\nGalen went to great lengths to refute a view that was apparently\ncirculating in his time (but whose originators or protagonists he did\nnot mention) according to which the pineal gland regulates the flow of\npsychic pneuma in the canal between the middle and posterior ventricles\nof the brain, just as the pylorus regulates the passage of food from\nthe esophagus to the stomach. Galen rejected this view because, first,\nthe pineal gland is attached to the outside of the brain and, second,\nit cannot move on its own. He argued that the “worm-like\nappendage” [epiphysis or apophysis] of the\ncerebellum (nowadays known as the vermis superior cerebelli)\nis much better qualified to play this role (Kühn 1822, pp.\n674–683; May 1968, vol. 1, pp. 418–423). \n\nAlthough Galen was the supreme medical authority until the\nseventeenth century, his views were often extended or modified. An\nearly example of this phenomenon is the addition of a ventricular\nlocalization theory of psychological faculties to Galen’s account of\nthe brain. The first theory of this type that we know of was presented\nby Posidonius of Byzantium (end of the fourth century CE), who said\nthat imagination is due to the forepart of the brain, reason to the\nmiddle ventricle, and memory to the hind part of the brain (Aetius\n1534, 1549, book 6, ch. 2). A few decades later, Nemesius of Emesa (ca.\n400 CE) was more specific and maintained that the anterior ventricle is\nthe organ of imagination, the middle ventricle the organ of reason, and\nthe posterior ventricle the organ of memory (Nemesius 1802, chs. 6–13).\nThe latter theory was almost universally adopted until the middle of\nthe sixteenth century, although there were numerous variants. The most\nimportant variant was due to Avicenna (980–1037 CE), who devised it by\nprojecting the psychological distinctions found in Aristotle’s On\nthe soul onto the ventricular system of the brain (Rahman\n1952). \n\nIn a treatise called On the difference between spirit and\nsoul, Qusta ibn Luqa (864–923) combined Nemesius’ ventricular\nlocalization doctrine with Galen’s account of a worm-like part of the\nbrain that controls the flow of animal spirit between the middle and\nposterior ventricles. He wrote that people who want to remember look\nupwards because this raises the worm-like particle, opens the passage,\nand enables the retrieval of memories from the posterior ventricle.\nPeople who want to think, on the other hand, look down because this\nlowers the particle, closes the passage, and protects the spirit in the\nmiddle ventricle from being disturbed by memories stored in the\nposterior ventricle (Constantinus Africanus 1536, p. 310).\n Figure 2.\n Qusta ibn Luqa’s Theory (modern schematic\nreconstruction, view from the left). Thinking is associated with the animal spirit in the\nmiddle ventricle (II), memories are stored in the posterior ventricle\n(III). Left: people who want to remember look up because this raises\nthe worm-like obstacle and enables the passage of memories from the\nposterior to the middle ventricle. Right: people who want to think look\ndown because this depresses the worm-like obstacle and isolates the\n middle ventricle from the contents of the posterior ventricle. Figure 3.\n The Worm-Like Obstacle. This illumination from\nca. 1300 shows how the worm guards the entrance of the posterior\nventricle (University Library, Cambridge, ms Gr.g.1.1; Source:\n Web Gallery of Art). \n Qusta’s treatise was very influential in thirteenth-century\nscholastic Europe (Wilcox 1985). \n\nIn several later medieval texts, the term pinea was applied\nto the worm-like obstacle, so that the view that the pineal gland\nregulates the flow of spirits (the theory that Galen had rejected) made\na come-back (Vincent de Beauvais 1494, fol. 342v; Vincent de Beauvais\n1624, col. 1925; Israeli 1515, part 2, fol. 172v and fol. 210r; Publicius\n1482, ch. Ingenio conferentia). The authors in question seemed\nignorant of the distinction that Galen had made between the pineal\ngland and the worm-like appendage. To add to the confusion, Mondino dei\nLuzzi (1306) described the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles as\na worm which can open and close the passage between the anterior and\nmiddle ventricles, with the result that, in the late Middle Ages, the\nterm ‘worm’ could refer to no less than three different\nparts of the brain: the vermis of the cerebellum, the pineal\nbody and the choroid plexus. Figure 4.\n The Worm According to Mondino (view from the left). In this diagram, there is a “worm”\n(“vermis”) between the anterior and middle\nventricles, in conformity with Mondino’s Anothomia (Reisch\n 1535, p. 883). Figure 5.\n The Worm According to Mondino (view from above). In this view of the brain from above, the label “worm” (“vermis”) is applied to the\n choroid plexus in the lateral and third ventricles, just as in Mondino’s Anothomia (Berengario da Carpi 1530, fol. O3r). \n\nIn the beginning of the sixteenth century, anatomy made great\nprogress and at least two developments took place that are important\nfrom our point of view. First, Niccolò Massa (1536, ch. 38)\ndiscovered that the ventricles are not filled with some airy or\nvaporous spirit but with fluid (the liquor cerebro-spinalis).\nSecond, Andreas Vesalius (1543, book 7) rejected all ventricular\nlocalization theories and all theories according to which the choroid\nplexus, pineal gland or vermis of the cerebellum can regulate\nthe flow of spirits in the ventricles of the brain. \n\nToday, René Descartes (1596–1650) is mainly known because of\nhis contributions to mathematics and philosophy. But he was highly\ninterested in anatomy and physiology as well. He paid so much attention\nto these subjects that it has been suggested that “if Descartes\nwere alive today, he would be in charge of the CAT and PET scan\nmachines in a major research hospital” (Watson 2002, p. 15).\nDescartes discussed the pineal gland both in his first book, the\nTreatise of man (written before 1637, but only published\nposthumously, first in an imperfect Latin translation in 1662, and then\nin the original French in 1664), in a number of letters written in\n1640–41, and in his last book, The passions of the soul\n(1649). \n\nIn the Treatise of man, Descartes did not describe man, but\na kind of conceptual models of man, namely creatures, created by God,\nwhich consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul. “These men\nwill be composed, as we are, of a soul and a body. First I must\ndescribe the body on its own; then the soul, again on its own; and\nfinally I must show how these two natures would have to be joined and\nunited in order to constitute men who resemble us” (AT XI:119,\nCSM I:99). Unfortunately, Descartes did not fulfill all of these\npromises: he discussed only the body and said almost nothing about the\nsoul and its interaction with the body. \n\nThe bodies of Descartes’ hypothetical men are nothing but machines:\n“I suppose the body to be nothing but a statue or machine made of\nearth, which God forms with the explicit intention of making it as much\nas possible like us” (AT XI:120, CSM I:99). The working of these\nbodies can be explained in purely mechanical terms. Descartes tried to\nshow that such a mechanical account can include much more than one\nmight expect because it can provide an explanation of “the\ndigestion of food, the beating of the heart and arteries, the\nnourishment and growth of the limbs, respiration, waking and sleeping,\nthe reception by the external sense organs of light, sounds, smells,\ntastes, heat and other such qualities, the imprinting of the ideas of\nthese qualities in the organ of the ‘common’ sense and the\nimagination, the retention or stamping of these ideas in the memory,\nthe internal movements of the appetites and passions, and finally the\nexternal movements of all the limbs” (AT XI:201, CSM I:108). In\nscholastic philosophy, these activities were explained by referring to\nthe soul, but Descartes proudly pointed out that he did not have to\ninvoke this notion: “it is not necessary to conceive of this\nmachine as having any vegetative or sensitive soul or other principle\nof movement and life, apart from its blood and its spirits, which are\nagitated by the heat of the fire burning continuously in its\nheart—a fire which has the same nature as all the fires that\noccur in inanimate bodies” (AT XI:201, CSM I:108). \n\nThe pineal gland played an important role in Descartes’ account\nbecause it was involved in sensation, imagination, memory and the\ncausation of bodily movements. Unfortunately, however, some of\nDescartes’ basic anatomical and physiological assumptions were totally\nmistaken, not only by our standards, but also in light of what was\nalready known in his time. It is important to keep this in mind, for\notherwise his account cannot be understood. First, Descartes thought\nthat the pineal gland is suspended in the middle of the ventricles. Figure 6.\n The Pineal Gland According to Descartes. This\nimage from the 1664 edition of the Treatise of man illustrates\nDescartes’ view that the pineal gland (H) is suspended in the middle of\nthe ventricles (Descartes 1664, p. 63).  But it is not, as Galen had already pointed out (see\nabove). Secondly, Descartes thought that the pineal gland is full of\nanimal spirits, brought to it by many small arteries which surround\nit. But as Galen had already pointed out, the gland is surrounded by\nveins rather than arteries. Third, Descartes described these animal\nspirits as “a very fine wind, or rather a very lively and pure\nflame” (AT XI:129, CSM I:100) and as “a certain very fine\nair or wind” (AT XI:331, CSM I:330). He thought that they\ninflate the ventricles just like the sails of a ship are inflated by\nthe wind. But as we have mentioned, a century earlier Massa had\nalready discovered that the ventricles are filled with liquid rather\nthan an air-like substance. \n\nIn Descartes’ description of the role of the pineal gland, the\npattern in which the animal spirits flow from the pineal gland\nwas the crucial notion. He explained perception as follows. The nerves\nare hollow tubes filled with animal spirits. They also contain certain\nsmall fibers or threads which stretch from one end to the other. These\nfibers connect the sense organs with certain small valves in the walls\nof the ventricles of the brain. When the sensory organs are stimulated,\nparts of them are set in motion. These parts then begin to pull on the\nsmall fibers in the nerves, with the result that the valves with which\nthese fibers are connected are pulled open, some of the animal spirits\nin the pressurized ventricles of the brain escape, and (because nature\nabhors a vacuum) a low-pressure image of the sensory stimulus appears\non the surface of the pineal gland. It is this image which then\n“causes sensory perception” of whiteness, tickling, pain,\nand so on. “It is not [the figures] imprinted on the external\nsense organs, or on the internal surface of the brain, which should be\ntaken to be ideas—but only those which are traced in the spirits\non the surface of the gland H (where the seat of the imagination and\nthe ‘common’ sense is located). That is to say, it is only\nthe latter figures which should be taken to be the forms or images\nwhich the rational soul united to this machine will consider directly\nwhen it imagines some object or perceives it by the senses” (AT\nXI:176, CSM I:106). It is to be noted that the reference to the\nrational soul is a bit premature at this stage of Descartes’ story\nbecause he had announced that he would, to begin with, discuss only the\nfunctions of bodies without a soul. \n\nImagination arises in the same way as perception, except that it is\nnot caused by external objects. Continuing the just-quoted passage,\nDescartes wrote: “And note that I say ‘imagines or\nperceives by the senses’. For I wish to apply the term\n‘idea’ generally to all the impressions which the spirits\ncan receive as they leave gland H. These are to be attributed to the\n‘common’ sense when they depend on the presence of objects;\nbut they may also proceed from many other causes (as I shall explain\nlater), and they should then be attributed to the imagination”\n(AT XI:177, CSM I:106). Descartes’ materialistic interpretation of the\nterm ‘idea’ in this context is striking. But this is not\nthe only sense in which he used this term: when he was talking about\nreal men instead of mechanical models of their bodies, he also referred\nto ‘ideas of the pure mind’ which do not involve the\n‘corporeal imagination’. \n\nDescartes’ mechanical explanation of memory was as follows. The\npores or gaps lying between the tiny fibers of the substance of the\nbrain may become wider as a result of the flow of animal spirits\nthrough them. This changes the pattern in which the spirits will later\nflow through the brain and in this way figures may be “preserved\nin such a way that the ideas which were previously on the gland can be\nformed again long afterwards without requiring the presence of the\nobjects to which they correspond. And this is what memory consists\nin” (AT XI:177, CSM I:107). \n\nFinally, Descartes presented an account of the origin of bodily\nmovements. He thought that there are two types of bodily movement.\nFirst, there are movements which are caused by movements of the pineal\ngland. The pineal gland may be moved in three ways: (1) by “the\nforce of the soul,” provided that there is a soul in the machine;\n(2) by the spirits randomly swirling about in the ventricles; and (3)\nas a result of stimulation of the sense organs. The role of the pineal\ngland is similar in all three cases: as a result of its movement, it\nmay come close to some of the valves in the walls of the ventricles.\nThe spirits which continuously flow from it may then push these valves\nopen, with the result that some of the animal spirits in the\npressurized ventricles can escape through these valves, flow to the\nmuscles by means of the hollow, spirit-filled nerves, open or close\ncertain valves in the muscles which control the tension in those\nmuscles, and thus bring about contraction or relaxation of the muscles.\nAs in perception, Descartes applied the term ‘idea’ again\nto the flow of animal spirits from the pineal gland: “And note\nthat if we have an idea about moving a member, that\nidea—consisting of nothing but the way in which spirits flow from\nthe gland—is the cause of the movement itself” (AT XI:181;\nHall 1972, p. 92). Apart from the just-mentioned type of bodily\nmotions, caused by motions of the pineal gland, there is also a second\nkind, namely reflexes. The pineal gland plays no role with respect to\nthem. Reflexes are caused by direct exchanges of animal spirits between\nchannels within the hemispheres of the brain. (Descartes did not know\nthat there are “spinal reflexes”.) They do not necessarily\ngive rise to ideas (in the sense of currents in the ventricles) and are\nnot brought about by motions of the pineal gland. \n\nThe first remarks about the pineal gland which Descartes published\nare to be found in his Dioptrics (1637). The fifth discourse\nof this book contains the thesis that “a certain small gland in\nthe middle of the ventricles” is the seat of the sensus\ncommunis, the general faculty of sense (AT VI:129, not in CSM I).\nIn the sixth discourse, we find the following interesting observation\non visual perception: “Now, when this picture [originating in the\neyes] thus passes to the inside of our head, it still bears some\nresemblance to the objects from which it proceeds. As I have amply\nshown already, however, we must not think that it is by means of this\nresemblance that the picture causes our sensory perception of these\nobjects—as if there were yet other eyes within our brain with\nwhich we could perceive it. Instead we must hold that it is the\nmovements composing this picture which, acting directly upon our soul\nin so far as it is united to our body, are ordained by nature to make\nit have such sensations” (AT VI:130, CSM I:167). This remark\nshows that Descartes tried to avoid the so-called “homuncular\nfallacy,” which explains perception by assuming that there is a\nlittle man in the head who perceives the output of the sense organs,\nand obviously leads to an infinite regress. \n\nDescartes’ short remarks about a small gland in the middle of the\nbrain which is of paramount importance apparently generated a lot of\ninterest. In 1640, Descartes wrote several letters to answer a number\nof questions that various persons had raised. In these letters, he not\nonly identified the small gland as the conarion or pineal\ngland (29 January 1640, AT III:19, CSMK 143), but also added some\ninteresting points to the Treatise of man. First, he explained\nwhy he regarded it as the principal seat of the rational soul (a point\nthat he had not yet addressed in the Treatise of man):\n“My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul,\nand the place in which all our thoughts are formed. The reason I\nbelieve this is that I cannot find any part of the brain, except this,\nwhich is not double. Since we see only one thing with two eyes, and\nhear only one voice with two ears, and in short have never more than\none thought at a time, it must necessarily be the case that the\nimpressions which enter by the two eyes or by the two ears, and so on,\nunite with each other in some part of the body before being considered\nby the soul. Now it is impossible to find any such place in the whole\nhead except this gland; moreover it is situated in the most suitable\npossible place for this purpose, in the middle of all the concavities;\nand it is supported and surrounded by the little branches of the\ncarotid arteries which bring the spirits into the brain” (29\nJanuary 1640, AT III:19–20, CSMK 143). And as he wrote later that year:\n“Since it is the only solid part in the whole brain which is\nsingle, it must necessarily be the seat of the common sense, i.e., of\nthought, and consequently of the soul; for one cannot be separated from\nthe other. The only alternative is to say that the soul is not joined\nimmediately to any solid part of the body, but only to the animal\nspirits which are in its concavities, and which enter it and leave it\ncontinually like the water of river. That would certainly be thought\ntoo absurd” (24 December 1640, AT III:264, CSMK 162). Another\nimportant property of the pineal gland, in Descartes’ eyes, is that it\nis small, light and easily movable (29 January 1640, AT III:20, CSMK\n143). The pituitary gland is, though small, undivided and located in\nthe midline, not the seat of the soul because it is outside the brain\nand entirely immobile (24 December 1640, AT III:263, CSMK 162). The\nprocessus vermiformis of the cerebellum (as Descartes called\nthe appendage which Galen had discussed) is not a suitable candidate\nbecause it is divisible into two halves (30 July 1640, AT III:124, not\nin CSMK). \n\nA second interesting addition to the Treatise of man that\nDescartes made in these letters concerns memory. Descartes now wrote\nthat memories may not only be stored in the hemispheres, but also in\nthe pineal gland and in the muscles (29 January 1640, AT III:20, CSMK\n143; 1 April 1640, AT III:48, CSMK 146). Apart from this, there is also\nanother kind of memory, “entirely intellectual, which depends on\nthe soul alone” (1 April 1640, AT III:48, CSMK 146). \n\nDescartes’ thesis that “the pineal gland is the seat of the\nsensus communis” was soon defended by others. The\nmedical student Jean Cousin defended it in Paris in January 1641\n(Cousin 1641) and the professor of theoretical medicine Regius defended\nit in Utrecht in June 1641 (Regius 1641, third disputation). Mersenne\ndescribed the reaction of Cousin’s audience in a letter to Descartes,\nbut this letter never reached its destination and is now lost (Lokhorst\nand Kaitaro 2001). \n\nThe most extensive account of Descartes’ pineal neurophysiology and\npineal neuropsychology is to be found in his The passions of the\nsoul (1649), the last book that he published. \n\nThe Passions may be seen as a continuation of the\nTreatise of man, except that the direction of approach is\ndifferent. The Treatise of man starts with the body and\nannounces that the soul will be treated later. The conclusion would\nprobably have been that we are indistinguishable from the hypothetical\n“men who resemble us” with which the Treatise of\nman is concerned and that we are just such machines equipped with\na rational soul ourselves. In the Passions, Descartes starts\nfrom the other end, with man, and begins by splitting man up into a\nbody and a soul. \n\nDescartes’ criterion for determining whether a function belongs to\nthe body or soul was as follows: “anything we experience as being\nin us, and which we see can also exist in wholly inanimate bodies, must\nbe attributed only to our body. On the other hand, anything in us which\nwe cannot conceive in any way as capable of belonging to a body must be\nattributed to our soul. Thus, because we have no conception of the body\nas thinking in any way at all, we have reason to believe that every\nkind of thought present in us belongs to the soul. And since we do not\ndoubt that there are inanimate bodies which can move in as many\ndifferent ways as our bodies, if not more, and which have as much heat\nor more […], we must believe that all the heat and all the\nmovements present in us, in so far as they do not depend on thought,\nbelong solely to the body” (AT XI:329, CSM I:329). \n\nJust before he mentioned the pineal gland for the first time,\nDescartes emphasized that the soul is joined to the whole body:\n“We need to recognize that the soul is really joined to the whole\nbody, and that we cannot properly say that it exists in any one part of\nthe body to the exclusion of the others. For the body is a unity which\nis in a sense indivisible because of the arrangement of its organs,\nthese being so related to one another that the removal of any one of\nthem renders the whole body defective. And the soul is of such a nature\nthat it has no relation to extension, or to the dimensions or other\nproperties of the matter of which the body is composed: it is related\nsolely to the whole assemblage of the body’s organs. This is obvious\nfrom our inability to conceive of a half or a third of a soul, or of\nthe extension which a soul occupies. Nor does the soul become any\nsmaller if we cut off some part of the body, but it becomes completely\nseparate from the body when we break up the assemblage of the body’s\norgans” (AT XI:351, CSM I:339). But even though the soul is\njoined to the whole body, “nevertheless there is a certain part\nof the body where it exercises its functions more particularly than in\nall the others. […] The part of the body in which the soul\ndirectly exercises its functions is not the heart at all, or the whole\nof the brain. It is rather the innermost part of the brain, which is a\ncertain very small gland situated in the middle of the brain’s\nsubstance and suspended above the passage through which the spirits in\nthe brain’s anterior cavities communicate with those in its posterior\ncavities. The slightest movements on the part of this gland may alter\nvery greatly the course of these spirits, and conversely any change,\nhowever slight, taking place in the course of the spirits may do much\nto change the movements of the gland” (AT XI:351, CSM I:340). \n\nThe view that the soul is attached to the whole body is already\nfound in St Augustine’s works: “in each body the whole soul is in\nthe whole body, and whole in each part of it” (On the\nTrinity, book 6, ch. 6). St Thomas Aquinas accepted this view and\nexplained it by saying that the soul is completely present in each part\nof the body just as whiteness is, in a certain sense, completely\npresent in each part of the surface of a blank sheet of paper. In\ndeference to Aristotle, he added that this does not exclude that some\norgans (the heart, for example) are more important with respect to some\nof the faculties of the soul than others are (Summa\ntheologica, part 1, question 76, art. 8; Quaestiones\ndisputatae de anima, art. 10; Summa contra gentiles, book\n2, ch. 72). \n\nAugustine’s and Aquinas’ thesis sounds reasonable as long as the\nsoul is regarded as the principle of life. The principle of life may\nwell held to be completely present in each living part of the body\n(just as biologists nowadays say that the complete genome is present in\neach living cell). However, Descartes did not regard the soul as the\nprinciple of life. He regarded it as the principle of thought. This\nmakes one wonder what he may have meant by his remark. What would a\nprinciple of thought be doing in the bones and toes? One might think\nthat Descartes meant that, although the pineal gland is the only organ\nto which the soul is immediately joined, the soul is nevertheless\nindirectly joined to the rest of the body by means of the threads and\nspirits in the nerves. But Descartes did not view this as immediate\nattachment: “I do not think that the soul is so imprisoned in the\ngland that it cannot act elsewhere. But utilizing a thing is not the\nsame as being immediately joined or united to it” (30 July 1640).\nMoreover, it is clear that not all parts of the body are\ninnervated. \n\nThe solution of this puzzle is to be found in a passage which\nDescartes wrote a few years before the Passions, in which he\ncompared the mind with the heaviness or gravity of a body: “I saw\nthat the gravity, while remaining coextensive with the heavy body,\ncould exercise all its force in any one part of the body; for if the\nbody were hung from a rope attached to any part of it, it would still\npull the rope down with all its force, just as if all the gravity\nexisted in the part actually touching the rope instead of being\nscattered through the remaining parts. This is exactly the way in which\nI now understand the mind to be coextensive with the body—the\nwhole mind in the whole body and the whole mind in any one of its\nparts” (Replies to the sixth set of objections to the\nMeditations, 1641, AT VII:441, CSM II:297). He added that he\nthought that our ideas about gravity are derived from our conception of\nthe soul. \n\nIn the secondary literature one often meets the claim that Descartes\nmaintained that the soul has no spatial extension, but this claim is\nobviously wrong in view of Descartes’ own assertions. Those who make it\nmay have been misled by Descartes’ quite different claim that extension\nis not the principal attribute of the soul, where\n‘principal’ has a conceptual or epistemic sense. \n\nMost of the themes discussed in the Treatise of man and in\nthe correspondence of 1640 (quoted above) reappear in the Passions\nof the soul, as this summary indicates: “the small gland\nwhich is the principal seat of the soul is suspended within the\ncavities containing these spirits, so that it can be moved by them in\nas many different ways as there are perceptible differences in the\nobjects. But it can also be moved in various different ways by the\nsoul, whose nature is such that it receives as many different\nimpressions—that is, it has as many different perceptions as\nthere occur different movements in this gland. And conversely, the\nmechanism of our body is so constructed that simply by this gland’s\nbeing moved in any way by the soul or by any other cause, it drives the\nsurrounding spirits towards the pores of the brain, which direct them\nthrough the nerves to the muscles; and in this way the gland makes the\nspirits move the limbs” (AT XI:354, CSM I:341). \n\nThe description of recollection is more vivid than in the\nTreatise of man: “Thus, when the soul wants to remember\nsomething, this volition makes the gland lean first to one side and\nthen to another, thus driving the spirits towards different regions of\nthe brain until they come upon the one containing traces left by the\nobject we want to remember. These traces consist simply in the fact\nthat the pores of the brain through which the spirits previously made\ntheir way owing to the presence of this object have thereby become more\napt than the others to be opened in the same way when the spirits again\nflow towards them. And so the spirits enter into these pores more\neasily when they come upon them, thereby producing in the gland that\nspecial movement which represents the same object to the soul, and\nmakes it recognize the object as the one it wanted to remember”\n(AT XI:360, CSM I:343). \n\nThe description of the effect of the soul on the body in the\ncausation of bodily movement is also more detailed: “And the\nactivity of the soul consists entirely in the fact that simply by\nwilling something it brings it about that the little gland to which it\nis closely joined moves in the manner required to produce the effect\ncorresponding to this volition” (AT XI:359, CSM I:343). \n\nThe pineal neurophysiology of the passions or emotions is similar to\nwhat is occurring in perception: “the ultimate and most proximate\ncause of the passions of the soul is simply the agitation by which the\nspirits move the little gland in the middle of the brain” (AT\nXI:371, CSM I:349). However, there are some new ingredients which have\nno parallel in the Treatise of man. For example, in a chapter\non the “conflicts that are usually supposed to occur between the\nlower part and the higher part of the soul,” we read that\n“the little gland in the middle of the brain can be pushed to one\nside by the soul and to the other side by the animal spirits” and\nthat conflicting volitions may result in a conflict between “the\nforce with which the spirits push the gland so as to cause the soul to\ndesire something, and the force with which the soul, by its volition to\navoid this thing, pushes the gland in a contrary direction” (AT\nXI:364, CSM I:345). \n\nIn later times, it was often objected that incorporeal volitions\ncannot move the corporeal pineal gland because this would violate the\nlaw of the conservation of energy. Descartes did not have this problem\nbecause he did not know this law. He may nevertheless have foreseen\ndifficulties because, when he stated his third law of motion, he left\nthe possibility open that it does not apply in this case: “All\nthe particular causes of the changes which bodies undergo are covered\nby this third law—or at least the law covers all changes which\nare themselves corporeal. I am not here inquiring into the existence or\nnature of any power to move bodies which may be possessed by human\nminds, or the minds of angels” (AT VIII:65, CSM I:242). \n\nOne would like to know a little more about the nature of the soul\nand its relationship with the body, but Descartes never proposed a\nfinal theory about these issues. From passages such as the ones we have\njust quoted one might infer that he was an interactionist who thought\nthat there are causal interactions between events in the body and\nevents in the soul, but this is by no means the only interpretation\nthat has been put forward. In the secondary literature, one finds at\nleast the following interpretations. \n\nThere seem to be only two well-known theories from the history of\nthe philosophy of mind that have not been attributed to him, namely\nbehaviorism and functionalism. But even here one\ncould make a case. According to Hoffman (1986) and Skirry (2003),\nDescartes accepted Aristotle’s theory that the soul is the form of the\nbody. According to Kneale (1963, p. 839), the latter theory was\n“a sort of behaviourism”. According to Putnam (1975),\nNussbaum (1978) and Wilkes (1978), it was similar to contemporary\nfunctionalism. By transitivity, one might conclude that Descartes was\neither a sort of behavorist or a functionalist. \n\nEach of these interpretations agrees with at least some\npassages in Descartes’ writings, but none agrees with all of\nthem. Taken together, they suggest that Descartes’ philosophy of mind\ncontains echoes of all theories that had been proposed before him and\nanticipations of all theories that were developed afterwards: it is a\nmulti-faceted diamond in which all mind-body theories that have ever\nbeen proposed are reflected. \n\nIn his later years, Descartes was well aware that he had not\nsuccessfully finished the project that he had begun in the Treatise\nof man and had not been able to formulate one comprehensive\nmind-body theory. He sometimes expressed irritation when others\nreminded him of this. In reply to the questions “how can the soul\nmove the body if it is in no way material, and how can it receive the\nforms of corporeal objects?” he said that “the most\nignorant people could, in a quarter of an hour, raise more questions of\nthis kind than the wisest men could deal with in a lifetime; and this\nis why I have not bothered to answer any of them. These questions\npresuppose amongst other things an explanation of the union between the\nsoul and the body, which I have not yet dealt with at all” (12\nJanuary 1646, AT IX:213, CSM II:275). On other occasions, he came close\nto admitting defeat. “The soul is conceived only by the pure\nintellect; body (i.e. extension, shapes and motions) can likewise be\nknown by the intellect alone, but much better by the intellect aided by\nthe imagination; and finally what belongs to the union of the soul and\nthe body is known only obscurely by the intellect alone or even by the\nintellect aided by the imagination, but it is known very clearly by the\nsenses. […] It does not seem to me that the human mind is\ncapable of forming a very distinct conception of both the distinction\nbetween the soul and the body and their union; for to do this it is\nnecessary to conceive them as a single thing and at the same time to\nconceive them as two things; and this is absurd” (28 June 1643,\nAT III:693, CSMK 227). He admitted that the unsuccessfulness of his\nenterprise might have been his own fault because he had never spent\n“more than a few hours a day in the thoughts which occupy the\nimagination and a few hours a year on those which occupy the intellect\nalone” (AT III:692, CSMK 227). But he had done so for a good\nreason because he thought it “very harmful to occupy one’s\nintellect frequently upon meditating upon [the principles of\nmetaphysics which give us or knowledge of God and our soul], since this\nwould impede it from devoting itself to the functions of the\nimagination and the senses” (AT III:695, CSMK 228). He advised\nothers to do likewise: “one should not devote so much effort to\nthe Meditations and to metaphysical questions, or give them\nelaborate treatment in commentaries and the like. […] They draw\nthe mind too far away from physical and observable things, and make it\nunfit to study them. Yet it is just these physical studies that are \nmost desirable for people to pursue, since they would yield abundant\nbenefits for life” (Conversation with Burman, 1648, AT V:165,\nCSMK 346–347). We will follow this wise advice. \n\nOnly a few people accepted Descartes’ pineal neurophysiology\nwhen he was still alive, and it was almost universally rejected after\nhis death. Willis wrote about the pineal gland that “we can\nscarce believe this to be the seat of the Soul, or its chief Faculties\nto arise from it; because Animals, which seem to be almost quite\ndestitute of Imagination, Memory, and other superior Powers of the\nSoul, have this Glandula or Kernel large and fair enough”\n(Willis 1664, ch.  14, as translated in Willis 1681). Steensen (1669)\npointed out that Descartes’ basic anatomical assumptions were\nwrong because the pineal gland is not suspended in the middle of the\nventricles and is not surrounded by arteries but veins. He argued that\nwe know next to nothing about the brain. Camper (1784) seems to have\nbeen the very last one to uphold the Cartesian thesis that the pineal\ngland is the seat of the soul, although one may wonder whether he was\ncompletely serious. In philosophy, a position called “Cartesian\ninteractionism” immediately provoked “either ridicule or\ndisgust” (Spinoza 1677, part 4, preface), usually because it was\nseen as raising more problems than it solved, and it continues to do\nso to this day, but as we have already indicated, it is doubtful\nwhether Descartes was a Cartesian interactionist himself. \n\nSome of the reasons that Descartes gave for his view that the pineal\ngland is the principal seat of the soul died out more slowly than this\nview itself. For example, his argument that “since our soul is\nnot double, but one and indivisible, […] the part of the body to\nwhich it is most immediately joined should also be single and not\ndivided into a pair of similar parts” (30 July 1640, AT III:124,\nCSMK 149), for instance, still played a role when Lancisi (1712)\nidentified the unpaired corpus callosum in the midline of the\nbrain as the seat of the soul. This view was, however, refuted by Zinn\n(1749) in a series of split-brain experiments on dogs. Lamettrie and\nmany others explicitly rejected the thesis that the unity of experience\nrequires a corresponding unity of the seat of the soul (Lamettrie 1745,\nch. 10). \n\nIn scientific studies of the pineal gland, little progress was made\nuntil the second half of the nineteenth century. As late as 1828,\nMagendie could still advance the theory that Galen had dismissed and\nQusta ibn Luca had embraced: he suggested that it is “a valve\ndesigned to open and close the cerebral aqueduct” (Magendie\n1828). Towards the end of the nineteenth century, however, the\nsituation started to change (Zrenner 1985). First, several scientists\nindependently launched the hypothesis that the pineal gland is a\nphylogenic relic, a vestige of a dorsal third eye. A modified form of\nthis theory is still accepted today. Second, scientists began to\nsurmise that the pineal gland is an endocrine organ. This hypothesis\nwas fully established in the twentieth century. The hormone secreted by\nthe pineal gland, melatonin, was first isolated in 1958. Melatonin is\nsecreted in a circadian rhythm, which is interesting in view of the\nhypothesis that the pineal gland is a vestigial third eye. Melatonin\nwas hailed as a “wonder drug” in the 1990s and then became\none of the best-sold health supplements. The history of pineal gland\nresearch in the twentieth century has received some attention from\nphilosophers of science (Young 1973, McMullen 1979), but this was only\na short-lived discussion. \n\nAs philosophy reduced the pineal gland to just another part of the\nbrain and science studied it as one endocrine gland among many, the\npineal gland continued to have an exalted status in the realm of\npseudo-science. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Madame\nBlavatsky, the founder of theosophy, identified the “third\neye” discovered by the comparative anatomists of her time with\nthe “eye of Shiva” of “the Hindu mystics” and\nconcluded that the pineal body of modern man is an atrophied vestige of\nthis “organ of spiritual vision” (Blavatsky 1888, vol. 2,\npp. 289–306). This theory is still fairly well-known today. \n\nDescartes was neither the first nor the last philosopher who wrote\nabout the pineal gland, but he attached more importance to it than any\nother philosopher did. Descartes tried to explain most of our mental\nlife in terms of processes involving the pineal gland, but the details\nremained unclear, even in his own eyes, and his enterprise was soon\nabandoned for both philosophical and scientific reasons. Even so, the\npineal gland remains intriguing in its own right and is still intensely\nstudied today, with even a whole journal dedicated to it, the\nJournal of Pineal Research.","contact.mail":"g.j.c.lokhorst@tudelft.nl","contact.domain":"tudelft.nl"}]
