In a large body of writing, Sylvan urged that, from logic to\necology, we are not now thinking well about big problems—but\nthat we can and must do better. “Philosophers fiddle while the\nworld begins to burn,” he wrote (Hyde 2014, vi). In response, he\nproposed a highly ambitious and radical philosophical project of\nre-evaluation, from foundations up, that has had ongoing impact in\nphilosophy (Casati, Mortensen & Priest 2018; Eckert (ed.) 2018;\nHyde (ed.) 2019, and Weber (ed.) 2019).\n\n\n\nSylvan is known for proposing and defending some highly controversial\nviews, arguing in favour of inconsistent theories, non-existent\nobjects, and non-human values. Such unorthodox claims were especially\nunpopular in the time Sylvan was writing, in the latter half of the\n20th century. But he thought it was vitally important, for\nphilosophy and for the world, that we take seriously ideas that run\nagainst conventions of the time. (As Robert Meyer put it, “To\nget the counter-suggestible Sylvan to defend some view, one needed\nfirst to remark that the view was now utterly discredited”,\nMeyer 1996.) What were widely thought to be untenable positions, such\nas Meinongianism, or failed theories, such as Cantor/Frege naïve\nset theory, attracted Sylvan’s attention for what he thought of\nas restoration:\n\n\nA large part of my philosophical life has, so it appears, looking back\n(and also looking forward) consisted in rehabilitating abandoned\nphilosophical dwellings, habitats, and landscapes. (Preface, Sylvan\nms. Philosophical Rehabilitation, quoted in Hyde 2014,\n124)\n\n\n\n\nHis contributions are all systematically tied together in the\nservice of a single project, around meaning and value, recognizing the\nlegitimacy and status of marginalized entities; for the landscapes he\nsought to rehabilitate had been, in his view,\n\n\n\nlaid waste or damaged by predecessors—too many of them, as\nthe predecessors adhered to an entirely defective set of\nvalues…(ibid.).\n\n\n\nHe sought to make these philosophical landscapes viable by improving\nthe way we reason about them, thereby casting them in a new light that\nshowed their deep interconnectedness.\n\n\n\nThis entry will use the name ‘Sylvan’, even though he\ndid not begin using that name until 1983. All his work published before\nthen uses his original name of ‘Routley’.\n\n\nSylvan was born in 1935 in Levin, New Zealand. He received his MA in\nPhilosophy from the University of New Zealand (Wellington) in 1957 and\nthe following year completed a first-class Honours degree in\nmathematics there. His MA thesis, a 385-page work entitled Moral\nScepticism was given a mark of 95% by Arthur Prior, though he\nlater commented that this was “not so much a mark as an\nexclamation mark” (quoted in D. Hyde, Introduction to Eckert\n(ed.) 2018, xiv). Blackwell agreed to publish a condensed version\nof the thesis but the required revisions were never undertaken. \n\nIn 1959, his teacher George Hughes then employed Sylvan to build a\nsmall electro-mechanical computer capable of determining whether input\nformulae were logical truths, logical falsehoods, or\nneither—with green, red and amber lights displaying the\nrespective outcomes. He worked out how to build it from scratch using\nrelays and uniselectors discarded by the post office and it was a\nsuccess, but when run some years later it drew so much power that it\nblacked out the building it was housed in, ruining several experiments\nin biology running in the building at the time. The Biology Department\ninsisted that it never be used again (Hyde 2014, 43). \n\nIn mid-1959, while bushwalking in Australia, he met Jack Smart (then\nin Adelaide, later a colleague at the Australian National University\nand good bushwalking friend thereafter) who encouraged him to go to\nPrinceton for graduate work, as opposed to the then more usual choice\nof UK universities like Cambridge. At Smart’s urging, “as\na brash young man” Sylvan travelled to Princeton with a\nFulbright scholarship for doctoral studies under Alonzo Church to\n“repair and renovate a derelict philosophy of science”\n(Sylvan 2000a, 7). After two and a half years he was awarded an MA\nfrom Princeton University but left before completing his PhD,\ndissatisfied with the intellectual climate there and subsequent lack\nof progress on his project. (He later received a PhD from Princeton in\n1980 for chapter one of Routley 1980.) He accepted a lectureship at\nSydney University in 1962 where he began lecturing undergraduates in\nlogic—introducing modern Russellian theory, displacing John\nAnderson’s long insistence on Aristotelian theory. There he met\nVal Plumwood (then Val Macrae, later Val Routley) and, in 1964, they\nmoved to the University of New England where Sylvan joined Len Goddard\nand a growing department—the first to have begun teaching modern\nlogic in Australia under Goddard in 1957. Goddard and Sylvan founded\nthe first Australian Masters program in logic and formed\nthe Australasian Association of Logic, and with Len Goddard,\nDavid Londey, Ross Brady, Malcolm Rennie and Val Plumwood, he\ndeveloped what became known as the New England Group—working on\nnon-classical logic and paradoxes, among other things—but\nGoddard left a few years later, returning to St Andrews in\nScotland. In 1967, with a year’s sabbatical owing, Sylvan and\nPlumwood married (with Plumwood taking the name Routley) and they\ndrove from the University to St Andrews to continue work with Goddard\n(traversing northern Australia, shipping the car from Darwin to\nSingapore, then overland into India and Pakistan, through the Middle\nEast and Eastern Europe). Upon return, in 1968, Sylvan took a\nposition at Monash University before being appointed to a Senior\nFellowship in Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences at\nthe Australian National University (ANU) in 1971, where he remained\nfor the rest of his career. With only postgraduate students to\nsupervise, his days teaching undergraduates was at an end. A number of\nresearchers from the New England Group subsequently joined him there\nand, with the addition of Bob Meyer, Graham Priest, and others, a\ngroup re-formed around Sylvan at the ANU—the well-known Canberra\nLogic Group that went on to pioneering research in non-classical,\nespecially relevant, logic. Through his contribution to the formation\nof research groups that were both innovative and productive, Sylvan\ninfluenced a whole generation of Australian philosophers and\nlogicians. (For more on this history of modern logic in Australia,\ncf. Routley 1984c, Goddard 1992, and Brady and Mortensen 2014.) \n\nThe natural world also fascinated Sylvan. By the time of his death\nhe had purchased, and worked to conserve, five large tracts of rich\nforest areas—four of which were subsequently bequeathed\nfor conservation.  He took such a delight in nature, not so much the\ndelight that a romantic might take in the overall beauty of it all,\nbut a delight in its richness and complexity, in the detail that he\nfound in the structure of mosses and in the behaviour of\ninsects. … It’s as if in a strange way he was part of it\n….  (quoted in D. Hyde, Introduction to Eckert (ed.)\n2018, xxv). \n\nWithin a year of arriving at the ANU (the centre of Australian\nforestry policy development), he and Plumwood became aware of plans\nfor extensive clearing of “useless” native forest for pine\nplantations across the country and so began work on a sustained\ncritique of Australian forestry practices (Routley and Routley 1973a)\nalongside joint work rethinking issues in environmental\nphilosophy. The critical and “pugilistic” style of the\nbook caused an uproar in forestry—with an attempt to suppress\nits publication (cf. Routley and Plumwood 1986). The repressive nature\nof the Australian forestry industry was widely understood from within,\nwith one forestry insider commenting, on receipt of a letter from\nSylvan early in the project, that: “for an Australian forester,\nreceiving a letter from you is somewhat akin to a new Party member\ngetting a birthday card from Alexander Solzhenitsyn” (Sylvan\nRSC, Box #45). Closer to home, they were also criticised by some\ncolleagues who, in the days before applied philosophy had come of age,\nsaw their work as “propaganda” rather than scholarly\nresearch. Despite resistance though, the book’s successful\npublication helped reform forestry in Australia, being subsequently\ndescribed by a leading forestry expert as “monumentally\nimportant” and “the most incisive and devastating economic\nanalysis of forestry … ever done in Australia” (Byron\n1999, 53). All three editions published through the ANU Press between\n1973 and 1975 sold out but by 1975 Sylvan was, remarkably, banned from\nusing the ANU’s Forestry Department Library (the central store\nfor documents relating to the development of national forestry policy)\nand further, planned editions were effectively stopped. \n\nIn 1975, Sylvan and Plumwood realised their dream of moving “off\ngrid” into the temperate rainforest in the coastal ranges east\nof Canberra where they began building a house from local stone (one of\nfive houses that Sylvan built over his life). Working first from a\ntent, then a shed, over the subsequent five years it took to build the\nhouse they produced much of their key work on relevant logic,\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and environmental philosophy—often\ndiscussing philosophy while building with graduate students and guests\nwho could be roped in to help. After a productive twenty-year\npartnership, Sylvan and Plumwood parted ways in 1983, and he married\nLouise Sylvan (née Merlin). That was also the year he changed\nhis name from ‘Richard Routley’ to ‘Richard\nSylvan’ while Val Routley, as she was then known, became Val\nPlumwood. Sylvan and Plumwood continued to work and correspond on\nclosely related themes in environmental philosophy until\nSylvan’s death in 1996. \n\nWhile his students and research assistants found him supportive and\nkind, Sylvan’s style sometimes offended his peers. He could be\nvery blunt in his assessment of other’s arguments and his shy\ndemeanour and lack of small talk did little to counteract feelings of\nrude-dismissal—friend and colleague Bob Meyer commenting that he\n“was a difficult man; not only did he fail to suffer fools\ngladly, but he often disdained suffering them at all” (Meyer\n1996). Sylvan himself also commented, for example, that his\n“Critique of Deep Ecology” (Sylvan 1985) would “risk\noffending many friends in the deeper ecology movement” (i) and,\nwhile he remained good friends with chief target Arne Naess, some\nwere, no doubt, offended. It earned him the title ‘the bad boy\nof deep ecology’ (Orton 2005, Other Internet\nResources)—still considered a “deep ecologist”\ndespite the substance of his criticism concluding in his rejecting\ndeep ecology in favour of what he termed “deep green\ntheory”. Some who took offense on reading his response to their\nwork would later go on to befriend and work with Sylvan, having gotten\npast his blunt exterior. But with opposing-authority there was rarely\nany rapprochement; his anti-authoritarianism was deep-rooted and his\nanarchist tendencies manifest—in both academic work and in his\nbehaviour. \n\nHis publishing habits also drew attention. Seeking an outlet for\nlonger papers and essays in the late 1970s, and wary of\n“profiteering” publishers, in the do-it-yourself spirit\nthat infused much of Sylvan’s life he began publishing a number\nof pre-print series in the Research School of Social Sciences where he\nworked at the ANU. Beginning with work of the Canberra Logic Group,\nthe “Yellow Series” (as it became known) included over\ntwenty publications by Group members between 1978 and 1985. There\nfollowed other Series including work in logic, metaphysics, the\nphilosophy of science and much of his own work in environmental\nphilosophy. In total, there were over fifty such publications of which\nover half were Sylvan’s own work. The publications ranged from\ntens of pages to hundreds and could be purchased by post from the\ndepartment for a few dollars. The largest, at just over one thousand\npages (Exploring Meinong’s Jungle and Beyond), for\nexample, was available in hardback for $10. Such anomalous publishing\nhabits meant that a considerable amount of his work is now very hard\nto access (though, in some cases, republication through more usual\nchannels is underway—e.g., Eckert (ed.) 2018; Hyde (ed.) 2019;\nand Weber (ed.) 2019). \n\nHe died in June 1996 aged 60, while entering a sacred temple in Bali\nto discuss Hindu philosophy with priests there. (For more details, see\nHyde 2014.) \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work in logic. As in other\nareas of his philosophy, Sylvan was notable for his staunch defence of\nhighly controversial and radical views—most strikingly, that\nclassical logic is wrong, that non-classical logic is right, and that\nsome contradictions may be true (see: dialetheism). What makes\nhis work worth remembering is that he backed up such claims with\nrigorous (if contentious) arguments and mathematical details. \n\nSylvan’s work in logic can be viewed in part as a response to\na wide range of paradoxes, such as the paradoxes of\nself-reference (like the Liar Paradox). He was equally focused on\nparadoxes of implication, and so was a leading developer of\nrelevant logics, logics characterized by their concern that\nthere be a meaningful connection between the antecedent and consequent\nof a conditional. These topics would lead him to be one of the founders\nof the so-called “Australasian school” of\nparaconsistent logic, logics that tolerate inconsistency\nwithout incoherence. He was perennially concerned with the\nuniversality of logic. Along with intrinsic interest, his\nlogical research was always motivated by its eventual application to\nissues in metaphysics, ethics, and beyond. \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work in neutral quantification\ntheory and significance logics. In both cases, he is concerned with\ngranting legitimacy to otherwise discredited or rejected\nentities—the existence (or lack thereof) of objects that seem\nlike perfectly good subjects of quantification in apparently true\nsentences; and the status of “nonsensical” sentences that\nseem like they are essential parts of good reasoning. \n\nFrom his earliest days at Princeton, Sylvan had argued that an\nadequate philosophy of science required quantification over\nnon-existent objects (numbers, frictionless planes, etc.), and an\nadequate semantics for fictional discourse was also best pursued along\nthese lines. (Cf. Routley 1965, 1966a, 1979a; Routley and Routley\n1973b, 1979a.) For reasons discussed in Section 3\nbelow, he followed Meinong in seeking a theory that includes\nnon-existent objects, and a logic that can handle such objects. \n\nA basic idea here (e.g., in Routley 1980) is to reassess the status of\nthe existential quantifier: \\(\\exists\\). It is commonplace\namongst logicians, especially since Russell 1905 and especially\nQuine’s article “On What There Is”, to read this\nas ontologically loaded; so if \\(\\exists x Ax\\) is true then\nsome \\(x\\) exists and has property \\(A\\). Sylvan urges that we\ndistinguish between particular claims (‘some \\(x\\) is\n\\(A\\)’) and existential claims\n(‘an existing \\(x\\) is \\(A\\)’). With the latter\nexistential reading, it is impossible to claim that some things just\ndo not exist; that amounts to saying something both exists and does\nnot exist, so it exists after all. But with the former\nparticular reading, the claim ‘some things do not\nexist’ comes out as intended, with its apparent natural language\nmeaning. Because the existential interpretation of the backward\n‘E’ symbol has become hopelessly entrenched, Sylvan\nintroduced new symbols, ‘P’ (for particular) and its dual\n‘U’ (universal), to act as neutral quantifiers.\nThus the logical ground was laid for subsequent work in neo-Meinongian\nmetaphysics (cf. Section 3). \n\nThis work, both the metaphysics and logic, led to a number of debates\nwith David Lewis. Lewis (1990) argues that the apparently deep\ndisagreement Sylvan has with ontologically loaded quantification might\nbe dispelled by a translation manual, between his unconventional\nMeinongian reading and a conventional one (cf. Priest 2005, Section\n7.9.): \n\nIf this is right, then it appears Sylvan is in danger of doing\nlittle more than quibbling about the use of the word\n‘exists’ when it comes to abstract objects. But Lewis is\nself-critically aware that any misunderstanding may be mutual, and\ncautions that \n\nTo suppose that [Sylvan] mistakes mere terminological difference for\nprofound philosophical disagreement is to accuse him of stupidity far\nbeyond belief (Lewis 1990, 30). \n\nWorry about communication difficulties between classical and\nnon-classical logicians would be voiced by Lewis again, eventually\ndeclining to debate at all (Lewis 1999, and cf. Smart 1977). \n\nWith the formation of the New England Logic Group, we find the first\ninstances of Sylvan pursuing the development of non-classical\nlogics as a response to a range of paradoxes. A preliminary\naspect to this work was the investigation of the fundamental notion of\nsignificance. \n\nEspecially in early 20th century philosophy, a popular\nmeans of dismissing various philosophical theses (say in metaphysics)\nwas “on the grounds that they are nonsense, nonsignificant,\nabsurd, meaningless, unintelligible, or logically odd” (Goddard\nand Routley 1973, 1). Such rejections are characteristic of logical\npositivism, taking a cue from Wittgenstein’s accusation that much\nof philosophy is “not false, but senseless\n[unsinnig]” [Tractatus 4.003] and therefore\neasy to ignore. By the late 1960s, it seemed to Routley and Goddard\nthat Russell and others had succeeded in promoting a\n“meaninglessness” solution to various paradoxes like the Liar\nsentence, or the Russell contradiction, \n\nthe set \\(R\\) of all sets that are not members of themselves is a\nmember of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself \n\nAccording to various Russell/Tarski type theories, sentences are\nregimented to levels of a hierarchy and restricted in scope about what\nthey can express; then liar-type sentences are, on this sort of\nsolution, “nonsense”. Appeal to non-significance is then\nmeant to avoid paradox. Goddard and Routley are concerned that\nphilosophers have been too eager to condemn theses that “are\nneither gibberish nor ungrammatical” (4). \n\nIn response, Routley (1966b), Brady and Routley (1973), and Goddard\nand Routley (1973) argue for a logic of significance for the formal\nstudy of significance. The ideas here can be summed up in three theses.\nFirst, there are grammatically correct natural language\nsentences, containing only recognized vocabulary (say of English),\nwhich “are held to be meaningless” (Goddard and Routley\n1973, 2); but “unlike seriously ungrammatical sentences,\n[they] can figure in valid arguments and can occur as unquoted\ncomponents of grammatical sentences” (Routley 1969, 367).\nSecond, such sentences require a non-classical and\nspecifically three-valued logic. Meaningless sentences still\nmust have some recognized status—and it is some status\nother than ‘true’ or ‘false’ (See Haack 1971,\n1975, and Bradley 1978 for alternatives). As Brady and Sylvan put\nit, \n\nWe believe that the deep structure of natural languages, and hence of\nthe languages in which philosophical problems are characteristically\nformulated, will have to be based on an enriched significance logic\nwhich has a third value—nonsense or nonsignificance—and\nnot on a classical two-valued logic which only has truth and falsity\nas its values (Brady and Routley 1973, 211). \n\nThird, all significance logics will need to be based on a\ncommon context logic, where a fixed context of use or\ncircumstance determines the ‘significance principles’ of\neach logic (Cocchiarella 1984; cf. Ripley 2012, 101). \n\nSylvan and Goddard want a logic that can track (as opposed to simply\ndeny) non-significant sentences, which we may think of as\ntruth-value gaps. Their proposed logic of significance may be\nunderstood (see Szmuc and Omori 2018) as being based on a three-valued\nlogic, weak Kleene, given by the following truth tables: \n\nThe intermediate value, \\(n\\) (for ‘nonsense’), is to\nbe read as, not a truth-value, but rather as a kind of\nmeaninglessness. These matrices respect two basic conditions laid down\nin (Goddard and Routley 1973, 260), that \n\nAn argument is valid on this logic iff there is no\nevaluation that interprets all the premises as true (value \\(t\\))\nbut the conclusion untrue (values \\(f\\) and \\(n\\)). This\nlogic was further investigated by Brady (1980) and Bunder (1979, 1980a,\n1980b). For criticism, see Lambert (1968) and Haack (1971, 1975). \n\nThis early work is transitional. Paradoxical sentences at this stage\nof Sylvan’s thinking may have a value, but certainly not that of\n‘true’ (or ‘false’). This relatively\nconservative attitude would begin to fall away as his thinking\ndeveloped. \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work as part of the Canberra\nLogic Group’s pioneering research on relevant and paraconsistent\nlogics, and applications to naïve set theory. In the mid-1970s,\nRoutley/Sylvan produced a closely interconnected body of work (1975;\nRoutley and Meyer 1976, 1977, 1979; Routley et al. 1982),\nmuch of it in collaboration with Val Plumwood (then Routley), Meyer,\nBrady, and Priest (e.g., Priest and Routley 1983), circling around a\nfew key ideas, the germs of which we have already met: universality;\nimplication and entailment; and inconsistency. We now visit these in\nturn. \n\nIn 1975 Sylvan took up the idea of a universal semantics\ndirectly (although the title of his paper “Universal\nSemantics?” is in the uncertain form of a question). Inspired by\nrecent advances in Montague grammar and categorial languages, he\nbecame speculatively interested in whether there is some common form\nbeneath all natural languages, that could be adequately represented\nthough logical symbolism. Specifically, he was interested in some\n“leading assumptions” of the time, namely (1975, 327): \n\nHere we can see two recurring concerns in Sylvan’s logical\nwork: a sceptical interest in the idea of a model-theoretic reduction\n(to be lambasted most vociferously with Meyer in their paper\n“Extensional Reduction” of 1977), and the uses of worlds\nsemantics to do it. \n\nAs an initial gloss, a universal semantics, whatever else it\nmay be, is intended to be a framework able to express everything that\ncan be expressed. As in Section 2.1, there should not be any\nartificial constraints placed on what we might be able to reason well\nabout (or, by extension, think about or imagine), nonsense or not. And\na universal logic should not have, as theorems, anything that\nis patently incorrect. Putting these two ideas together, Sylvan was\nalready convinced that “classical logic” is too strong to\nserve as the basis for any universal semantics, because\nit cannot express everything that is expressible, such as\nmany intensional notions; and it does deliver apparently\nnonsensical theses such as the paradoxes of material implication (see\nSection 2.2.2 below). (These two aspects of a logic—the extent\nof the class of models it can describe, and the set of validities it\nyields—are inversely proportional; cf. Priest 2008,\n36–7.) \n\nOn these grounds, Sylvan looked increasingly at non-classical logics\nas a better framework or foundation for any universal semantics. His\n1977 manifesto “Ultralogic as universal?” introduces the\ntitular subject (note again the question mark) as follows: \n\nA universal logic, in the intended sense, is one which is applicable\nin every situation whether realised or not, possible or not. Thus a\nuniversal logic is like a universal key, which opens, if rightly\noperated, all locks. It provides a canon for reasoning in every\nsituation, including illogical, inconsistent and paradoxical ones. Few\nprevailing logics stand up to such a test. … [A] universal\nlogic should be adequate for mathematical and philosophical\npurposes—and also for logical functions in other areas such as\nbiology, economics, astrology, theology, and so on (893). \n\nApproaching any universal logic, according to Sylvan, would require\nextending the expressive power of classical logic, and concomitantly\nrestricting its proving power. \n\nTwo possible misinterpretations of this “universalist”\nproject should be flagged. First, Sylvan did not argue that some\nspecific alternative logic is the absolutely correct one, or even that\nthere should be one and only one correct alternative (see Section\n3.3). Second, although he can sound rhetorically partisan and\nideological, Sylvan’s approach was ultimately rather pragmatic:\nhe couched theory choice in practical cost/benefit analyses familiar\nfrom conventional philosophy of science (Routley 1980a). On the\nmeaning of ‘universality’ in this context see Mares (2019)\nand Nolan (2018). Brady’s 2006 book takes its title in part from\nSylvan’s announced project, with a focus on logics for\n“meaning containment”. \n\nFaced with the limitations of classical logic, Sylvan joined in the\nproject of refining C.I. Lewis’s strict implication to\novercome various paradoxes of the conditional. (See the encyclopedia\nentry on indicative conditionals.) For, according to the classical\naccount of material implication \\(\\supset\\), for any three random\ndeclarative sentences \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\) you find on the Internet, \\(\n(p \\supset q) \\lor (q \\supset r) \\) is valid (to take just one\nexample; see Routley et al. 1982, 6–7). One diagnosis\nof the problem here is that all these conditionals, of the form\n‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)’, display irrelevance: the\nantecedent \\(p\\) need not have anything “to do with” the\nconsequent \\(q\\), whereas correct natural language conditionals (so\nthe argument goes) always respect some kind of relevant\nconnection. The problem may be resolved by turning to an appropriate\nrelevant logic. \n\nSylvan is explicit, though, that his “main concern is not really\nrelevance at all—the appropriate sort of relevance is a\nby-product of any good implication relation, which comes out in the\nwash” (Routley et al. 1982, x) after a deeper diagnosis\nof the paradoxes. He emphasizes that what is really at issue for a\nsuccessful account of a conditional is absolute\nsufficiency—that when \\(p\\) really does imply \\(q\\), this\nmeans that \\(p\\) is all that is needed for \\(q\\). \n\nThe central deducibility relation of ultramodal logics, entailment, is\nintended to capture the notion of sufficiency … of the\nantecedent of an entailment on its own, without any additional\nimported truth, especially imported logical truths. …\nSufficiency is a go-anywhere notion, which is not limited by the fact\nthat the situation in which it operates is somehow classically\nincoherent, e.g., inconsistent or paradoxical. If \\(A\\) is sufficient\nfor \\(B\\) then it does not matter what else goes on; logical laws may\ngo haywire but nothing subtracts from \\(A\\)’s sufficiency (1977,\n896). \n\nSo while Sylvan’s contribution to relevant logic was seminal,\nhis concerns diverged from some other “relevantists”. In\nsome otherwise highly critical remarks, Burgess (1983, 45) writes that\n“Routleyanism and Andersonianobelnapianism are so dissimilar\nthat it is misleading to apply a single label\n‘relevantism’ to both. (And indeed, [Sylvan] sometimes\nadopts a different label.)” \n\nThe diagnosis of the paradoxes of implication as failures of respect\nfor sufficiency leads naturally to an alternative path to their\nresolution, of a piece with Sylvan’s concerns about\nuniversality. On this view, the paradoxes of implication are symptoms\nof taking\ntoo few possibilities into account. One may think of\nclassical material implication as taking only one situation\ninto account, giving rise to theorems like ‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\),\nor if \\(q\\) then \\(p\\)’, since either \\(p\\) is true (in which\ncase, \\(p\\) or \\(\\twiddle q\\) is true, and so q materially\nimplies \\(p\\)) or else \\(p\\) is false (in which case, \\(\\twiddle p\\)\nor \\(q\\) is true, and so \\(p\\) materially\nimplies \\(q\\)). This is immediately resolved upon consideration\nof two possibilities,\n\\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\), \n\nand thinking of ‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)’ as meaning\nthat in every world in which \\(p\\), also\n\\(q\\), i.e., \n\nThen ‘\\(p \\rightarrow q, \\mathrm{or}\\, q \\rightarrow p\\)’\nhas a counterexample, points at which p holds\nwithout q and vice versa, showing a failure of sufficiency\nexactly because more worlds are considered. \n\nThe key to solving the paradoxes and approaching universality, on\nthis approach, is to broaden the collection of worlds, in order to\nsieve out what sufficiency relations persist. Sylvan extends this\nstrategy to deal with other paradoxes of implication, such as the\nirrelevant \\( q \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow p) \\).\n\n \n\nSince \\(p\\) does imply \\(p\\), \\(p \\rightarrow p\\), i.e., at\nevery world in which \\(p\\), also \\(p\\), then to show that arbitrary\n\\(q\\) is not sufficient for this self-implication, there needs to be a\ncounterexample: one where \\(q\\) holds without \\(p \\rightarrow\np\\). Generally, to preserve sufficiency, the same strategy goes for\nany logical truth, \\(B\\): if we are to avoid \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) when\n\\(B\\) is logically necessary but irrelevant to \\(A\\), there must be\npoints at which even logical truths fail. For example, there\nwould be a world at which the law of non-contradiction \\(\\twiddle (A\n\\amp \\twiddle A)\\) fails. These points are known as non-normal or\nimpossible worlds, about which there is a growing literature (e.g.,\nNolan 2013; Berto and Jago 2019). \n\nThe logics being proposed here, then, are naturally\nparaconsistent: they do not validate the “spread”\nlaw: (\\(p \\amp \\twiddle p) \\rightarrow q\\), and so can putatively\nhandle inconsistency without collapse into triviality. (In\nSociative Logics, Sylvan refers to these as\npararelevant logics.) Indeed, with counterexamples to the law\nof non-contradiction, there would be worlds where some sentences\nare both true and false. \n\nThe first relevant logics were presented proof theoretically, in terms\nof axioms and closure under rules. The need for a model theoretic\ninterpretation (given in a classical metatheory) resulted in\nSylvan’s co-development with Plumwood of ternary relation\nsemantics for first degree entailment relevant logics (Routley and\nRoutley 1972) and the ensuing Routley-Meyer partnership that proved\nand extended a range of results for relevant logics (cf. Routley,\nMeyer, et al. 1982; and Brady 2003). (Cf. Fine 1974; Urquhart\n1972.) A Routley-Meyer frame \\(\\langle W, N, 0, R, {}^*\n\\rangle\\) consists of: \n\nAn evaluation then assigns formulas a truth-value at each world; so\nsome \\(p\\) may be true at one world but false at another. With the\nRoutley star, these may even be the same world. The conditions on\nimplication and negation are as follows: \n\nNothing prevents both \\(A\\) and \\(\\twiddle A\\) being true at some\nworlds; indeed, respecting relevance demands it. These conditions can\nbe seen as generalizations of more standard ones: in the case\nof implication, if \\(y = z\\) then this is just a modalized material\nconditional in a Kripke frame; in the case of negation, if \\(x = x^*\\)\nthen this is just the clause for negation in classical logic. For\nfurther details, see the entry on relevance logic, Mares (2004), and\nPriest (2008, ch. 10). On the Routley star see Restall (1999). \n\nRoutley/Myer semantics has generated an enormous secondary literature\n(cf. the secondary literature section of the bibliography), for\nexample Copeland 1979, 1983, Thomas 2015. Debates have surrounded:\nthe interpretation of the semantics (e.g., the ternary relation, the\nRoutley-star operator, non-normal worlds); alternative semantics for\nrelevant logics; the adequacy of non-classical responses to semantic\nand set-theoretic paradoxes; dialetheism; and naïve set\ntheory. For recent work about the ternary relation see Beall et al\n2012; for a recent exchange about the Routley star and negation, see\nBerto 2015, De and Omori 2018, and Berto and Restall 2019. \n\nSylvan’s instrumental need for inconsistent worlds in order to\naccount for implication led to tentative endorsement of the\npossibility of true contradictions (dialetheism). Most relevant\nlogicians thought of these “worlds” merely as artefacts of\nthe semantics, not as legitimate possibilities\n(indeed—they’re impossible!); but there the idea was, of\n“dialectical” or contradictory worlds. By (1976), he and\nMeyer consider a rather literal interpretation of Hegelian dialectic,\nand openly question the “Consistency Hypothesis” that the\nworld is consistent. They urge instead a “dialectical”\npossibility. They present the (relevant) logic DL (for\ndialectical logic), and give it an axiomatization that explicitly\nincludes an outright contradiction \\(p \\amp \\twiddle p\\) as\nan axiom. (Smiley calls this “Routley and Meyer’s\nwar work” (Smiley and Priest 1993, 17). See also van Benthem\n1979, Havas 1981.) \n\nWhen Graham Priest arrived in Australia and presented his\n‘Logic of Paradox’ to the 1976 meeting of the Australasian\nAssociation of Logic, another intensely productive partnership was\nstruck. With true contradictions—later to be named\ndialetheia by Sylvan and Priest—in view, the potential\nof surpassing classical logic opened up: \n\nThe liberating effect of giving up the classical faith … is\nimmense: … one is free to return to something like the grand\nsimplicity of naive set theory, to semantically closed natural\nlanguages (having abandoned the towering but ill-constructed and\nmostly unfinished hierarchies of formal languages), and to intuitive\naccounts of truth, of proof, and of many other intensional notions\n(1979b, 302). \n\nDialetheism, especially due to Priest, has prompted a long and growing\ndiscussion (see Priest 1987 [2006] and Beall 2009 for defences and e.g.,\nField 2008 for some useful criticism; see the bibliography in the\nentry on dialetheism for more). \n\nSylvan’s thinking about contradictions evolved, depending on his\nco-author, even over the course of a book. In Relevant Logics and\ntheir Rivals (1982), early chapters float dialetheism as a\nhypothesis, in an “agnostic” spirit (61), or that of\ntaking precautions; whereas later in the book, it states bluntly that\n“mathematics is inconsistent” (255). (The shift is\ncriticized by Urquhart in a 1988 review (Brady 2003, 2).) \n\nAs mentioned in the quote above, Sylvan saw that something like the\n“dialectical logic” DL could be used to\nunderwrite inconsistent but non-trivial mathematical and scientific\ntheories, which had been of interest to him since the start. Of\nparticular note is naïve set theory, used by Cantor, Dedekind,\nand Frege in the foundations of mathematics (see the entry on the\nearly development of set theory), but dealt an apparently fatal blow\nby Russell’s paradox circa 1900. Building from work by Brady\n(1971), naïve set theory as formulated with the implication\nconnective ‘\\(\\rightarrow\\)’ of DL (or the\nslightly weaker DK) takes as axioms that there is a set for\nevery property \\(A\\), i.e.,  \n\nwhere ‘\\(\\in\\)’ is read ‘is a member of’ and\nwith Sylvan’s preferred particular and universal quantifiers\n(see Section 2.1); and that sets are determined by their members,\ni.e., \n\nOn the basis of these axioms, comprehension and\nextensionality, in Routley (1977) he begins to sketch out\nwhat he hopes will be the “rehabilitation” of naïve\nset theory and more using ultralogic. \n\nA basic derivation in this set theory is that the Russell set exists,\nand is both a member of itself and not a member of itself. The\nparadoxes, in other words, are proofs, and the resulting\ncontradictions are theorems (1979b, 302). Sylvan sketches the\nfurther work needed to show that elementary principles such as the\nZermelo-Fraenkel axioms and their immediate consequences can be\nderived. And he speculates, much more ambitiously, that the Axiom of\nChoice and the Continuum Hypothesis could be decided as well; see\nWeber (2012). Priest 2006, chapter 18 is a discussion\nof paraconsistent set theory in this tradition. \n\nThe project was given an essential boost when Brady confirmed the\nnon-triviality of the theory in the late 70s, i.e., that there are\n(absurd) sentences that cannot be proved in this theory,\nresults which appeared as Brady (1989); see (Brady 2006). Further work\nin relevant arithmetic, by Routley, Meyer, Mortensen, Dunn, Priest,\nRestall, and others, followed. This led to the area now known as\ninconsistent mathematics, carried forward especially by\nMortensen (1995, 2010), where e.g., the Routley star is used as a\nfunctor to great effect; see the entry on inconsistent\nmathematics for further references. \n\nThis section mentions briefly some other applications of\nSylvan’s preferred logics to a wide range of philosophical\nproblems. Sylvan saw applications as a test for the choice of such\ntheories over rival logics. Sections 3 and 4 are in a way extended\ndiscussions of such applications. Sylvan argued that relevant and,\nmore broadly, what he termed “sociative logics” had\napplications in areas as diverse as causation, an analysis of\nknowledge, vagueness (including the idea that there are vague objects;\nsee Sylvan and Hyde 1993), and value theory. Here we sketch two such\napplications, in confirmation, and computation. \n\nFollowing Goddard (1977), Sylvan (along with Nola, in 1991) applies\nrelevant logic to solve the paradoxes of confirmation made\nfamous by Hempel. These are problems in philosophy of science about\nformulating inductive generalizations such as \nwhich is confirmed by instances of things which are both black and\nravens; but the universal generalization is logically equivalent to\nits contrapositive form \n\nwhich would similarly be confirmed by any non-black non-raven; but\nsince e.g., a red pencil is obviously not confirmation that\nall ravens are black, something has gone wrong. For Sylvan, the\nproblem—as is often his diagnosis—lies in the\nformalization of the natural language claims—“It is\nwell-known in relevance circles that the most outrageous of these\nparadoxes are automatically removed by replacement of the material\nconditional …” (2000a, 227). “A relevance\nshift,” he argues with typical restraint, “is a sure-fire\nway of knocking out all the paradoxes of confirmation” (2000a,\n232.). For discussion, see Fitelson (2006). \n\nAlong other lines, Sylvan made tentative steps in the foundations of\nrecursion theory, towards a non-classical theory of computation (cf.\nCopeland and Sylvan 1999; Sylvan 2000a). According to work by Turing,\nChurch, and Gödel in the 1930s, computers face logical limits on\nwhat they can compute (see the entry on the Church-Turing thesis and\nthe entry on computability and complexity). Uncomputability proofs,\nthough, bear a very strong resemblance to the derivations of\nRussell’s paradox and other diagonal paradoxes. If\n“dialectical” logic can be used to solve those paradoxes,\nthough—essentially, by accepting that they have truly\ncontradictory conclusions (see Section 2.2 above)—then could the\nsame be done in the case of computers? Then the conclusion would\nbe, not that there are uncomputable algorithms, but rather\n“there are more algorithmic functions than all algorithmic\nfunctions” (2000a, 195). Sylvan envisions “dialeth[e]ic\nmachines”; cf. Weber (2016). \n\nSylvan’s approach to logic is of a piece with his work in\nmetaphysics and ethics: a polemical rebuke of the perceived powers of\nthe day—in the case of logic, the hegemony of classical\nlogic—and a highly imaginative and open-minded attitude towards\nwhat sorts of entities—possible and impossible alike—our\nbest theories should condone. We turn now to these other aspects of\nhis work. \n\nIn this section, we present Sylvan’s work in ontology and\nmetaphysics. As discussed below, Sylvan was deeply inspired by Alexius\nMeinong but, as a matter of terminology, their understanding of\n‘ontology’ and ‘metaphysics’ differ: while\nMeinong would situate metaphysics and ontology as small corners within\na more general object theory, Sylvan situated them the other way\naround. (See, for instance, Meinong 1904, §2 and §11; Sylvan\n1995a, 47). In what follows, we follow Sylvan and employ what we take\nto be contemporary standard usage of ‘ontology’ (roughly\nunderstood as the study of what exists and what does not) and\n‘metaphysics’ (roughly understood as the study of the\nstructure of reality), while acknowledging that Meinong-scholars might\ndispute this use of terms. In Section 3.1, we sketch some of the\nessential features of noneism, that is, Sylvan’s theory\nabout non-existent objects. In Section 3.2, we discuss Sylvan’s\nattempt at expanding the horizons of traditional ontology by\ndeveloping a new theory called sistology. Finally, in Section\n3.3, we summarize Sylvan’s heterodox account of pluralism,\nlabelled plurallism. \n\nFrom 1965 on, Sylvan argued that, through the influence of Quine,\ncontemporary philosophy is committed to a fundamental mistake. Such a\nmistake, labelled the “Ontological Assumption” (cf. 1980),\nis represented by the view that one cannot make true statements about\nwhat does not exist. In opposition to this idea, Sylvan develops a\ntheory about (non-existent) objects or, in Sylvan’s jargon,\nitems—noneism. \n\n[Noneism is] a very general theory of all items whatsoever, of those\nthat are intensional and those that are not, of those that exist and\nthose that do not (…); it is a theory of the logic and\nproperties and kinds of properties of all items (1980,\n5–6) \n\nSylvan’s intuition is that, in order to be able to say something\ntrue about non-existent items, we need to allow for the possibility\nthat non-existent items have properties. For instance, in order to be\nable to say that ‘Sherlock Holmes is a detective’ is true,\nSherlock Holmes needs to have the property of\nbeing a detective. Now, according to Sylvan, a suitable\nphilosophical background for supporting this intuition is\nMeinong’s Theory of Objects. For this reason, in\nExploring Meinong’s Jungle and Beyond (Routley 1980),\nSylvan tries to deliver a modern logical presentation of\nMeinong’s philosophy. He writes: \n\nMeinong’s theory provides a coherent scheme for talking and\nreasoning about all items, not just those which exist, without the\nnecessity for distorting or unworkable reductions; and in doing so it\nattributes … features [properties] to nonentities [non-existent\nobjects] (1980, iv–v). \n\nAt nearly 1000 pages, Routley (1980) develops noneism in great\ndetail. We summarize it in five main theses, which represent the core\nassumptions of what Sylvan calls minimal noneism (from now on\nMN). First of all, following Meinong’s account\nof intentionality, Sylvan believes that: \n\n(1980, 1–2; 352). In other words, every time we refer to\nsomething, we refer to an item. If I tell a story about Sherlock\nHolmes, I tell a story about an item, namely that item that is the\nsubject matter of my story. \n\nThe second thesis is that: \n\n(1980, 2–3). Sylvan follows Meinong in claiming that some items\nexist (e.g., the Eiffel Tower) and some others do not (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes). Like Meinong, Sylvan treats existence as a property: some\nitems have the property of being red and some other items do\nnot; some items have the property of being existent (e.g.,\nthe Eiffel Tower) and some items do not (e.g., Sherlock Holmes). When\nitems do not have the property of being existent, they are\nnon-existent items. In Sylvan’s jargon, they are\n“nonentities”. \n\nFurthermore, according to the third and fourth theses: \n\n(1980, 2–3), and \n\n(1980, 2–3). Thesis (MN3)\ncorresponds to Meinong’s indifference principle: the\nproperties an item has are indifferent to the ontological status of\nthe item itself. Thesis (MN4) corresponds\nto Meinong’s independence principle: an item’s\nhaving properties is independent of whether the item in\nquestion exists or not. \n\nAs many have pointed out (cf. Russell 1905 and 1907; see also Berto\n2013 and Priest 2005), the original theory defended by Meinong faces\nproblems. In particular, Meinong’s theory is threatened by\ntriviality (Berto 2013, 106–107); that is, the\nsituation in which everything exists—including items that\nclearly do not.  E.g., if I refer to not just to Sherlock Holmes but\nto “the\nexisting Sherlock Holmes”, then it seems\nby (MN4) that Sherlock Holmes exists. \n\nIn order to resolve this issue, Sylvan makes two moves. First of all,\nhe introduces the distinction between characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties. The former are necessary in order to\ndefine the essence of an object. A characterizing property is a\nproperty (e.g., being a detective or being smart)\nthat is necessary in order to make a specific item (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes) the item that it is. Using Sylvan’s words: \n\nCharacterizing predicates [or properties] are those which specify what\nan item is like, in itself. They tell how an item is in fact. They\ngive its description. A good dossier of an item would perhaps give its\ncharacterization first, by way of its characterization features [or\nproperties] (Sylvan 1995b). \n\nOn the other hand, the non-characterizing properties are all those\nproperties that are not characterizing. According to Sylvan, the\nproperty of being existent is a non-characterizing\nproperty. \n\nAs it has been extensively argued in the secondary literature (see,\nfor instance, Priest 2005), the difference between these two kinds of\nproperties is unclear. It is also fair to say that, even though some\n(neo-)Meinongians have tried to cash out such a distinction in more\nprecise terms (see, for instance, Jacquette 2015 and 2017; Parsons\n1978 and 1980), there is little consensus that any progress has been\nmade. That being said, even though it is certainly difficult to have\nstrict criteria to separate the characterizing properties from the\nnon-characterizing ones, it is absolutely clear that: \n\n(1980, 2). This is the fifth and last thesis. \n\nThe second move Sylvan makes in response to the triviality problem is\nrepresented by the idea that, even though it is the case that every\ntime we refer to something we refer to an item, the item in question\nhas characterizing properties. Following Berto (2013), we can also say\nthat, consistent with some other neo-Meinongians (i.e., Jacquette 2015;\nParsons 1980), Sylvan argues in favour of the following\ncharacterization principle: \n\nfor any set of characterizing properties, some item satisfies\nit. \n\nConsider, for example, Sherlock Holmes. When we refer to Sherlock\nHolmes, we refer to an item (because of\n(MN1)). Moreover, even though Sherlock\nHolmes does not exist (because of (MN2)),\nhe has some characterizing properties (because of\n(MN3) and\n(MN4)). For instance, according to\nDoyle’s novels, Sherlock Holmes is a smart detective. If so, in\nSherlock Holmes’s set of characterizing properties, there are, at\nleast, two properties: being a detective and being\nsmart. However, the property being non-existent is not in\nthis set because it is a non-characterizing property. And this is\nguaranteed by (MN5). \n\nAs we have already specified above, minimal noneism is merely\nthe core of Sylvan’s noneism which is more elaborate and\nsophisticated than sketched here. Exactly because of its complexity,\nnoneism forces us to rethink some of our traditional approaches to\nimportant philosophical topics. Examples are intensionality,\nnonexistence, impossibilia, and paradoxicality. Moreover, in the light\nof these conceptual innovations, Sylvan also discusses some of the\nrelevant applications of noneism in philosophy of mathematics (cf.\n1980, 769–781 and 791–833), philosophy of perception\n(cf. 1980, 649–678), philosophy of time (cf. 1980,\n361–410); philosophy of science (cf. 1980, 781–791) and\nphilosophy of fiction (cf. 1980, 537–595). \n\nSylvan spent many years developing and defending noneism, but he was\nnot entirely satisfied with it. He had two major complaints. On the\none hand, he thought that his way of presenting noneism was\nrhetorically problematic: EMJB was too long, rambling, and not\nincisive enough. As such, EMJB needed to be rewritten (see Sylvan\n1995b). On the other hand, he aimed at “liberalizing\nnoneism” by allowing all items to have both characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties (Sylvan 1995b). Archival documents show\nthat, to this end, Sylvan tried to develop a new theory that has many\nfeatures in common with so-called “modal Meinongianism”,\nrecently defended by Priest. On these issues, see Casati (2018),\nGriffin (2018), Kroon (2019), Priest (2005). \n\nIn late life, Sylvan aimed at enriching the ideas defended in Routley\n(1980) by developing what he calls “sistology”. On the one\nhand, sistology adopts all the fundamental ideas of noneism. Like\nnoneism, sistology includes items that do not exist (cf. Sylvan 1991,\n837; 1997, 11–12) and it accepts that those items have\nproperties (cf. 1991, 838–39). On the other hand, sistology\ndevelops and enriches noneism in the following ways. \n\nTo begin with, Sylvan tried to move the focus of his attention from\nthe existence (or non-existence) of items to their being\nitems. Using Sylvan’s words, sistology is concerned with\n“all items as having standing” (1991, 838).\nThus, sistology aims at casting a new light on what it means to be\nan item instead of showing that it is possible to have\nnon-existent items. The latter project was the unique task of\nnoneism. \n\nSecondly, Sylvan tried to extend and deepen the catalogue of items he\ndealt with in Routley (1980). In an unpublished manuscript, Sylvan\ndescribed an imaginary museum in which all sorts of items are\naccepted. Among those items that have not been (comprehensively)\ndiscussed in his (1980), Sylvan listed: \n\nIn particular, Sylvan devoted significant effort to this last cluster\nof items, underscoring the idea they require the employment of a\nparaconsistent logic. Given that inconsistent items have inconsistent\nproperties, if classical logic is employed then triviality immediately\nfollows. In order to avoid trivialism, the adoption of a\nparaconsistent logic is required. \n\nConsider, for instance, inconsistent objects. (…) By virtue of\nwhat they are, they have contradictory properties, thereby\ntrivializing any theory built upon mainstream logic. An authentic\nsistology requires logical reformulation of a more demanding\nparaconsistent type (Sylvan 1991, 839). \n\nThe third and last attempt to develop noneism is represented by a\nserious engagement with the notion of a “source”. As he\nhad already discussed, a “source” is what allows us to\nunderstand the charactering properties that an item (cf. 1980, 463;\n1995a). The source of Anna Karenina’s characterizing properties\nis Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina. In sistology, Sylvan aims\nat deepening our understanding of sources by admitting that not all of\nthem are equally reliable. For instance, optical illusions teach us\nthat visual perceptions are not always a trustworthy source for\ncharacterizing the items we see. For this reason, Sylvan suggests\nintroducing two kinds of predicates. The first kind (call them\n“ordinary predicates”) tell us how items look;\nthe second kind (call them “non-ordinary\npredicates”) tell us how items really are. \n\nNot all sources are always reliable or otherwise satisfactory; for\nexample, perceptual sources are notoriously unreliable as to how\nthings really are. (…) Thus, [the] division of\n[ordinary and non-ordinary] properties is presumed (1991, 839; italics\nours). \n\nSistology, which is only sketched by Sylvan, nevertheless anticipates\nsome of the ideas currently debated among neo-Meinongians, for\nexample, as discussed above, with “items in general”.\nRegardless of the existence or non-existence of these items, sistology\nconcerns their “having standing” (1991, 839). In so doing,\nSylvan focuses his attention on one of the most under-researched\nnotions of Meinong’s theory of objects, that is, the so-called\ndoctrine of Outsidebeing [Aussersein]. Only recently\nhave neo-Meinongian started to turn their attention to this topic\n(Casati and Priest 2017; Grossman 1974; Jacquette 2015). So too with\nthe very particular kind of object that is “nothingness”\n(cf. Sylvan 1995a). After a long-standing lack of interest in these\ntopics, neo-Meinongians have begun to take them into serious\nconsideration as well (Casati and Fujikawa 2019; Priest 2014a and\n2014b; Jacquette 2013). \n\nIn the current philosophical landscape, there are many different forms\nof pluralism on offer. For instance, there is an\nontological form of pluralism (there are different ways of\nbeing), truth pluralism (there are different ways of being\ntrue), and there is a logical form of pluralism (there is\nmore than one correct logic; see the entry on logical\npluralism). However, it is almost universally assumed, if mostly\nunstated, that there can be no pluralism about the actual\nworld—this one is the only\nactual one. As should appear clear from this entry, though,\nSylvan was accustomed to challenging the philosophical consensus. He\nbegan by attacking classical logic, he continued by questioning the\nso-called Ontological Assumption and, late in his career, he decided to\nchallenge what he calls one-world-ism, that is, the idea that\nthere is only one actual world. \n\nSylvan argues that there is a plurality of actual worlds we all live\nin. In his Transcendental Metaphysics (1997) he claims: \n\nA theme, to be defended at length, is that while there is\nan actual world, which is suitably external,\nmind-independent, perceiver-independent, and the like, it is not\nunique. There are many actual worlds. That theme is bound to\nstrike others, as it still occasionally strikes me momentarily, as\nutterly outrageous. [My] work and arguments are designed to remove\nthis misconception (1997, 4). \n\nIn order to draw a clear distinction between his pluralism and the\nothers, he refers to his own theory with a neologism:\nplurallism. The aims of such a theory are summarized as\nfollows: \n\nThe overarching themes of plurallism are (…): (1) There is\nno unique world. There is no unique actual universe; (2)\nThere is no one unalterable truth; no single Way of Truth; (3)\nThere is no single correct Scientific Theory (1997,\n4). \n\nIn order to support these ideas, Sylvan presents two sets of\narguments. \n\nSylvan argues indirectly there is a lack of (good) arguments\nin favour of the uniqueness of the actual world. From the fact that\nthere is such a thing as an actual world it does not necessarily\nfollow that such a world is unique, nor is its uniqueness observable\n(cf. 1997, 54–60). \n\nOn the other hand, he directly supports plurallism by arguing\nthat for each area of research, there is (or there could be) a\nplurality of correct theories. His reasoning goes as follows. All\ntheories are grounded on logic because logic is necessary for\nreasoning about both the data used by those theories and the theories\nthemselves. And, if there is, not just one, but a plurality of\ncorrect logics, there is (or there could be) a plurality of\ncorrect theories which spring from all those different, but all\nequally acceptable, ways of reasoning as well (cf. 1997,\n61–74). From this, a plurality of actual worlds follows if we\naccept two enthymematic assumptions. The first one is that any correct\nlogic, in virtue of its being correct, properly describes an actual\nworld. If so, if there is more than one correct logic, there is more\nthan one actual world too. The second assumption, then, is that there\nare many correct logics. This idea was not shared by Sylvan’s\ncontemporaries but one that he came to defend late in his career,\nclaiming (1997, xix) “that not merely is there a plurality of\nlogics, but there is also [a plurality] of correct logics”. The\nidea is elaborated on in Sylvan (1997, ch. 4) and is now widely\ndiscussed in the literature (see, for instance, Beall and Restall\n2000; Russell 2008; Weber 2017b). Sylvan claims that phenomenological\ndata seems to support plurallism as well (cf. 1997,\n118–133). \n\nSylvan’s motivations for developing plurallism are not uniquely\nphilosophical. On the contrary, he believes that the existence of the\nplurality of actual worlds can have important political consequences\ntoo. One of those consequences is the extension and strengthening of\nour idea of tolerance. According to Sylvan, intolerant behaviours are\noften, if not always, grounded on ideologies driven by what he calls\nthe “one-true-way” (1997, 462) or the\n“one-admissible-way” (1997, 462). Governments,\nreligious groups, and even scientists believe that “truth should\nbe imposed” (1997, 462) where truth is what is uniquely\ndetermined by them. Plurallism invites us to entertain the idea that,\nas there is no such thing as a unique actual world, there is no such\nthing as a unique truth. And this should undermine the ideological\nroots of intolerant behaviours. \n\nIn many ways, Sylvan’s philosophical and logical research is\ndevoted to the attempt to be inclusive, open-minded, and, therefore,\ntolerant. Contra the Quinean admiration for desert landscape,\nSylvan admired an over-crowded jungle of ideas in which different\nlogics, all sorts of items, and a plurality of actual worlds could\npeacefully coincide. \n\nIn this section we describe Sylvan’s work in moral philosophy.\nHis seminal and frequently reprinted (1973; see also SEP entry\n“Environmental Ethics” Section 2) was, alongside Naess\n(1973), the first published work in environmental ethics and began a\ncentral debate in the area, one concerned with intrinsic value in\nnature. Elaborated on in Routley and Routley (1979b) and (1980a), this\nwork developed arguments against what he termed “human\nchauvinism”—the view that humans are exceptional in being\nthe sole locus of intrinsic value, all else having merely instrumental\nvalue. Alongside this work in environmental ethics more broadly, which\nwas to continue until his death, he also published in defence of\npacifism, against nuclear war, and was one of the first philosophers\nto point to the emerging moral issues associated with anthropogenic\nglobal warming. \n\nDeveloping out of influential work condemning Australian forestry\npractices in the early 1970s, (cf. Routley and Routley 1973a, Byron\n1999), Routley (1973)—“Is There a Need for a New, an\nEnvironmental, Ethic?”—presents a thought experiment\ndesigned to test what Sylvan took to be a core principle of Western\nethical systems, the Freedom Principle: \n\nOne should be able to do what he wishes, providing (1) that he does\nnot harm others and (2) that he is not likely to harm himself\nirreparably (1973, 15) \n\nHe calls this principle basic human chauvinism “because\nunder it humans, or people [whether present or future], come first and\neverything else a bad last”—a view later characterized as\n“anthropocentric” in the much expanded discussion of The\nLast Man Example in Routley and Routley (1980a, cf. 96). \n\nWe are invited to consider a world in collapse where humanity is\nreduced to a single person who then proceeds to eliminate, to the best\nof their abilities, “every living thing, animal or plant (but\npainlessly if you like, as at the best abattoirs).” (1973, 16)\nWith the demise of the last man (which we may suppose occurs\nimmediately prior to the wholesale destruction unleashed), there are\nno humans—either others or the last man himself—who could\nbe harmed by such an act and so, with clauses (1) and (2) satisfied,\nthe act is permissible according to the “human chauvinist”\nWestern ethical systems. (And even if “others” were\nextended to include non-human sentient creatures, still no harm,\nunderstood as suffering, would accrue given the act is done\n“painlessly”.) Yet, “what he does is wrong”\nand therewith we have a counterexample to such chauvinism and\nassociated Western ethical systems, and a claimed need for a new\nethic, “an environmental ethic”, capable of accounting for\nthe wrongness of the last man’s act. (As in his logical work,\nSylvan’s strategy is to try to isolate what is sufficient (in\nthis case, for wrongness) by considering “distant”\npossible worlds.) \n\nGranting the wrongness of the last man’s act, is a “new\nethic” really required? Preference utilitarianism has been\nconsidered as a “traditional” ethic capable of condemning\nthe last man. (Cf. Elliot 1980, 20 and 23; and Carter 2004,\n51–52 for a more limited condemnation along preference\nutilitarian grounds.) Where there is an overwhelming preference for\npreservation of the world beyond the death of the last man, and its\ndestruction would thus harm those having such a preference, the\nFreedom Principle would already appear to prohibit such an act\n(assuming the aggregated harm outweighs any benefit in the\nsatisfaction of contrary preferences). But notice that condemnation,\non this view, is highly contingent, depending on people’s\npreferences (condemnation is justified only if preferences\nconflict with destruction). Since the condemnation is thought to be\nwarranted with “no ifs and buts”, yet this\n“traditional” response offers the correct judgement only\nin special circumstances, for Sylvan, it counts as “too\nparochial” (Routley 1973, 20). (Cf. Lamb 2018, 532–3 for a\nsimilar point.) \n\nReacting, in part, to Leopold’s call for a “land\nethic”, Sylvan’s subsequent work in the area (much of the\nearly work with Val Routley, later Val Plumwood) proceeds to describe\nand argue for just such a non-anthropocentric, environmental ethic. A\ndominant aspect of this “new” ethic (indeed, a\ncharacterising feature in Elliot 1980) that was fixed on by\nsubsequent authors was the extension of non-instrumental,\n“intrinsic” or “final” values to the non-human\nworld. First mentioned in 1974 in early drafts of Routley and Routley\n(1980a) and subsequently Val Routley (1975), Rolston (1975), and\nCallicott (1979)—who all employ versions of the Last Man\nExample—the extension is described and defended at length in\nRoutley and Routley (1980a). (Sylvan assumes intrinsic value is, in\ngeneral, already assured on the familiar Aristotelian ground that\ninstrumental value requires intrinsic value, lest vicious regress\nensue—cf. Aristotle Metaphysics, 994b9–15.) \n\nSylvan and Plumwood hypothesise that what underpins the deontic\nprohibition of the last man’s act is the truth of the\naxiological claim that entities in non-human nature can possess more\nthan mere instrumental value—non-human nature “can have\nvalue and create obligations not reducible (in any way) to human\ninterests” (1980a, 129). While such items may have instrumental\nvalue, value as a means to human ends, advantaging us in various\nways—e.g., the value of forests in supplying water for human\nconsumption—they might also have “non-instrumental”,\nor what the Routleys called “intrinsic” value (1980a, 126\nand 129). Thus, the rejection of human chauvinism in its deontological\nform (the assertion of and the argument to the falsity of the Freedom\nPrinciple) was accompanied by its rejection in axiological form: not\nonly humans have intrinsic value; non-human nature may also be the\nlocus of intrinsic (non-instrumental) value. \n\nWhile accepting that we may have moral obligations with respect to or\nregarding entities in the non-human world, Routley (1973, 19) and\nRoutley and Routley (1980a, 174ff) deny that this entails our having\nobligations to them and deny, too, their having correlative\nrights. Sylvan rejects such an extension of rights to non-human\nentities. For this reason, he takes the “new environmental\nethic” to “differ markedly” from alternatives like\nLeopold’s land ethic. As it developed, it also differed markedly\nfrom most forms of utilitarianism for a broad range of reasons,\narguing instead for a deontologically constrained “optimisation\napproach to value theory”. (See Routley and Routley 1985; Sylvan\n1992.) Variants of Last Man counterexamples to traditional Western\nethics are also taken to show that the distribution of intrinsic value\nextends beyond sentient individuals—contra “animal\nliberationists” (1980a, 125) like Singer—so that\n“candidates for value … include all objects”\n(1980a, 140). \n\nResisting Sylvan’s broad push for a non-anthropocentric,\nenvironmental ethic are several arguments suggesting the inevitability\nof human chauvinism. Foremost among them are arguments that, he\nclaims, “parallel” arguments for egoism. Their rejection\nfollows similar grounds for rejection of egoism—cf. Routley and\nRoutley (1979b, esp. 47). This paper also distinguishes strong forms\nof human chauvinism (endorsing what Sylvan later termed the sole value\nassumption: that only members of the human class and some of\ntheir possible states have intrinsic value) from weaker forms that\nmerely endorse, for example, “the Greater Value Thesis: the\ninvariable allocation of greater value or preference … to\nhumans, while not however entirely excluding non-humans from moral\nconsideration” (ibid., 36)—a thesis also rejected\nby Sylvan. Paske (1991) defends a qualified version of the thesis; the\nmoral differentiation in favour of most humans can be\njustified (by appeal to deontologically-constrained hedonic\nconsequentialism). Attfield (1981), considering versions of the Last\nMan Example, also rejects strong human chauvinism while defending the\ngreater value thesis, thus defending a weak chauvinism in\nSylvan’s sense. “The good of trees might outweigh some of\nour whims: but it does not outweigh our interests except where our\ninterests depend on it” (1981, 51). \n\nPetersen and Sandin, on the other hand, defend a strong form of human\nchauvinism, arguing that the Last Man Example is subject to varying\nresponses depending on the motives attending the act of\nelimination. They thus reject the hypothesis of intrinsic values in\nnature, arguing instead that any supposed wrongness “can be\nbetter explained by precepts about last man’s character traits\nand motives” (2013, 133). It remains open whether such a\nresponse is adequate for the Last People Example (described by Sylvan\nimmediately following the Last Man Example) who may be said to act\n“for the best of reasons” though they have acted\n“badly” (Routley 1973, 16–17). \n\nA number of arguments against Sylvan’s hypothesised intrinsic\nvalue of natural items focus on supposed problems that attend the\napparently “cosmic” account of value that items are said\nto have in the absence of valuers (e.g., after the demise of the last\nman). Some focus on problems traditionally associated with moral\nobjectivism. If value is conceptually independent of valuers then:\nmoral intuitionism is an unacceptable consequence (cf. Mannison 1980,\n57, the charge of “realism”); moral theory is inconsistent\nwith (the preferred theory) moral projectivism (Carter 2004, who\nclaims a projectivist theory can explain our intuitions concerning the\nlast man); or such value is simply beyond epistemic access and\nirrelevant for decision-making (Justus et al. 2009,\n187–8). The latter point echoes earlier claims in Thompson\n(1990), Grey (1993), and Fox (1995) that the hypothesis of intrinsic\nvalue in nature results in values that, being too far removed from\nhuman concerns, are irrelevant as an ethical guide to human action\n(Thompson 1990, 159–60; Grey 1993, 464) and, in any event, are\nunnecessary—an enlightened anthropocentrism is sufficient. \n\nSylvan’s position on the ontology of values (discussed at length\nin 1980a, esp. 152ff) draws on the Last Man Example to claim that\nthings can, indeed, be valuable at a time when no valuers exist and\nextended thought experiments of a similar kind he takes to further\nestablish that things can be valuable in a world wherein no valuer\nexists at all, though a valuer must exist in some world (1980a, 156,\nfn 67; cf. also Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 143). Values are, he claims,\nconceptually dependent on valuers—thus the slogan “no\nvalue without valuers” remains true, he contends—and\ntherewith the rock of objectivism is said to be avoided (1980a,\n154). Elliot (1980) also contends that a non-objectivist account is\nsufficient for this kind of value engendered by the last man example,\nthough it is one requiring actual evaluators (“no\nvalues without actual valuers”). He goes on to describe\na subjectivist account that further links values to valuers\nin a manner that “makes the valuer the sole determinant of a\nthing’s value” (1980, 19) with value reduced to valuer\nevaluations. \n\nTaking himself to have avoided objectivism, Sylvan nonetheless argues\nagainst subjectivist accounts—intrinsic values are not\nsubjective either (1980a, 154). Intrinsic value in a world,\nwhile depending conceptually on valuers, nonetheless does not reduce\nto valuers in that world in any way. Some have remarked on\nthe apparent similarities between Sylvan’s account of intrinsic\nvalue and secondary qualities, suggesting his account amounted to a\nresponse-dependent account of intrinsic value (cf. Grey 2000). See\nLamb (2018, §IX) for argument to the contrary. \n\nIn the further elaboration of the “new ethic”, Routley and\nRoutley (1980a) develops a multiple factor model combining traditional\nvalues, such as the virtues and creature enjoyment, with environmental\nvalue-making factors, for example: diversity of systems and creatures,\nnaturalness, integrity of systems, stability of systems, and harmony\nof systems (170–171). So the shift to an environmental ethic\ndoes not reject ordinarily acknowledged welfare values for persons or\nhumans, but simply recognises a further set of factors contributing to\nintrinsic value in nature (171). Such value-making factors enter into\na mutually constrained optimisation so that the increase of one need\nnot increase the overall intrinsic value of the entity exemplifying\nit; thus, an increase in diversity in a forest may decrease value\ninsofar as it may come at the cost of naturalness (e.g., if the added\ndiversity comes from the anthropogenic addition of feral species not\nnaturally occurring in that forest). \n\nThe account of value is non-naturalistic in the sense that value is\nargued to be irreducible to natural features, even though\n“grounded” in them. (1980a, §5; Sylvan later\ncommitted to the supervenience of intrinsic value on naturalistic\nfeatures, Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 143). It is Meinongian in a number\nof respects—most obviously, drawing freely on Routley (1980),\ncf. esp. §8.11, values are features had by items but, like\nproperties, they do not exist (1980a, 153ff). Sylvan’s moral\nepistemology also draws heavily on Meinong’s account of\n“emotional presentation” (see Lamb 2018, §VIII):\n“the valued object may be emotionally presented and its\nvalue thus recognised, without its value simply amounting to\nits emotional presentation” (Routley and Routley 1983, 453). The\naccount is articulated at length in Sylvan (1986). Perhaps\nunsurprisingly, Sylvan’s semantic analysis of value (cf. Routley\nand Routley 1983) makes use of non-classical, relevant logic in its\nformal analysis. (Weber 2017a also draws on Sylvan’s work in\nnon-classical logic to develop a “new version” of the Last\nMan Example—the “Ultramodal Last Man”—with a\nview to avoiding an alleged dilemma besetting the original Last Man\nExample, “renewing a role for non-standard logics in value\ntheory”.) \n\nWhile Sylvan views the development of deep ecology sympathetically, he\ndistances himself from the positions being argued for under that\nbanner. His own “deep green ethics” is described most\nclearly in Sylvan and Bennett (1994, ch. 5). Like deep ecology, the\nposition is, using the term originally coined in Naess (1973),\n“deep” since it rejects the sole value assumption and\ngreater value thesis. But unlike deep ecology Sylvan rejects, in\nparticular: \n\narguing instead that some non-living things have intrinsic value and\nthat not all life is intrinsically valuable; and \n\narguing instead for eco-impartiality, thus not valuing members of one\nspecies over those of another simply on the basis of species\nmembership, and noting that evaluative impartiality with respect to\nspecies does not entail their equal value. More generally, Sylvan\n(1985) argues that under the strong West Coast US influence deep\necology commits to an assortment of dubious metaphysical and\npsychological themes—often leading to an anthropocentric\n“person- and consciousness-oriented soufflé”. And\nlinks to religion, in particular pantheism and nature mysticism,\nthreaten to “convert deep ecology into a new religion”.\nWhat results is a “deep ecology” that is\n“conceptually murky” and subject to\n“degeneration”. As noted in Section 1, laying out these\npoints of difference with deep ecologists in uncompromising style\nearned him the title ‘the bad boy of deep ecology’ (Orton\n2005, Other Internet Resources). For responses, see Fox (1986) and\nAttfield (1993). \n\nHis deep green theory is, following his metaphysical and logical\npluralism (cf. Sylvan 2000b), also pluralistic “allow[ing] for\nthe requisite theory dependence and cultural relativity of\nvalues” (1980a, 156), “there is no uniquely determined\ncorrect value system … there are various overlapping\nsystems” though he denies that ethical relativism follows from\nthis (Sylvan 1986, 13). He sees the ongoing cultural project of\ndeveloping an adequate environmental ethic as being in its early\nstages. \n\nGrey (2000) contends that the (proto)theory faces numerous problems;\nfor further analysis as to whether Sylvan’s position has been\nproperly targeted see Lamb (2018, 565–80 passim). \n\nNot content with mere theory, as noted in section 1, Sylvan also\nengaged in ambitious practical conservation work, acquiring high-value\nconservation properties for rehabilitation and protection. But the\nvalue of such rehabilitated landscapes is contested in Elliot (1982)\nand Katz (1992). Defending the idea that naturalness of origin is a\nvaluable aspect of wild nature, they argue that not only is restored\nnature of lesser value than any wilderness that it replaces, but the\nrestored copy could be described as “a fake or a forgery”\n(Elliot 1982, 84); restoration involves a “big lie” as\nKatz puts it. Sylvan thinks they have grossly overstated their case\nand responds in Sylvan (1994)—restored landscapes are not mere\nartifact or fakery. They are not contrived gardens devoid of natural\nvalues, artificial nature falsely presented as the real thing. \n\nConsider an area of restored bushland … The restoration results\nprimarily by nature doing its own thing; it is nothing like furniture\nor pottery making. An ecological restorer, unlike an artisan, does not\nproduce the item, there is no making … Rather there is\nadjustment at margins … and there is helping in\nhealing (Sylvan 1994, 68). \n\nSylvan argues that Elliot and Katz have illicitly extended the notion\nof an artifact, which is widely and wrongfully deployed in such\ndescriptions of restored natural areas and what they (especially Katz)\nhave failed to grasp is the value-enhancing role that restoration\nplays in the many situations where the damage has already been\ndone. Such restoration “is an addition, an attempt … to\nclaim back much more of what has [already] been grabbed and degraded\nor ruined” (Ibid., 75). In many cases restoration\nassists nature in reasserting itself and taking control once\nmore. What results lacks certain properties of the original, to be\nsure, especially natural continuity, but contributing to the\nrestoration of something to close-to-original value (as opposed to\nsome low-value fake) is, Sylvan argues, worthwhile and can result in\nnear-natural areas of enormous value. That is value enough. \n\nThough Sylvan is uneasy using the term ‘wilderness’\n“due to its long history of unfavourable associations and\nconnotation”, he agrees with the broader point being made by\nElliot and Katz—“ecological restoration is not an\nalternative to retaining wilderness, to remnant wildernesses”\n(Sylvan 1994, 75). However, they have overstated their case concerning\nthe value of restored landscapes. Elliot was persuaded, admitting that\nhe paid too little attention to the types of restoration that can be\nachieved and underestimated the value and degree of naturalness that\ncan result. In a book-length response to Sylvan and other critics and\nfellow travellers, Elliot (1997) clarifies his argument. Its Preface\nacknowledged the enormous debt to Sylvan. He is, Elliot came to think,\nquite right. “Mucking with nature” can result in something\nof significant value and it is, Elliot argued, in many cases\nobligatory to try to undo the damage we have done. \n\nA further practical issue which Sylvan sees as requiring theoretical\njustification is predation: the killing of animals for\nfood. “The vegetarian options face, it certainly seems,\ninsuperable difficulties, especially concerning such issues as animal\npredation (which is an important, immensely frequent, and\noften desirable, ecological fact), and concerning the\nreduction in numbers of animals, especially introduced animals, which\nbuild up to ‘pest proportions’ (some reduction is often\nrequired for vegetable growing to operate successfully)”\n(Routley 1982, 5). Sylvan himself, for example, culled feral rabbits\n(a damaging, introduced species in Australia) and he consumed the\nanimals killed. While his environmental ethic demands respect for\nintrinsically valuable non-humans, he argues that the \n\nrespect position is not a reverence position … interference is\nacceptable [in certain cases] … The lives, preferences,\nchoices, and considerations of other species or objects of moral\nconcern are not to be taken as sacred or inviolable [though we]\nrequire that good reasons be given for interfering with the\nenvironment (Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 149). \n\nSee Routley (1982, §4) for a defence (a paper which also presents\na moral defence of limited cannibalism). For a similar view see\nCallicott (1980) and for defence of the contrary claim that we ought,\nwhere possible, act to eliminate predation, even cases of wild animals\ntaking prey for food, see Nussbaum (2007, ch. 6). \n\nIn addition to work in environmental ethics, Sylvan wrote on other\nethical issues including arguments for moral obligations to future\ngenerations (cf. Routley and Routley 1978, Sylvan and Plumwood 1991),\nand the ethics of energy choice (Routley and Routley 1979c). The\nargument offered in the latter paper against nuclear power centres on\nthe (anthropocentric but nonetheless, in Sylvan’s view, salient)\nclaim that bequeathing toxic nuclear waste to future generations\nconstitutes an ethically unacceptable shift of costs onto others. And\na similar argument was mounted against conspicuous consumption of\nfossil fuels from what Sylvan and Plumwood then referred to as\n“atmosphere heating” (Routley and Routley 1979c, §3).\nTheirs appear to be amongst the earliest philosophical discussions\nfocussing on the ethics of climate change. And it is not just the\nclaimed immorality following from the consequences of climate change\nto future humans, though that is given weight; from a deep green\nperspective, the claimed erosion of value outstrips mere\nanthropocentric concerns and needs to take into account non-human\nnature, where the resultant erosion of intrinsic value is taken to\nloom large. \n\nConsidering destructive practices more generally, beyond those\ndestructive of the environment, Sylvan considered violence against\npersons, arguing that not only was nuclear war immoral, but that which\nconditionally promised it, nuclear deterrence, was also immoral (cf.\nRoutley 1984a). In fact, violence in general was, he argued, immoral,\ndefending pacifism and responding to the standard objections to it in\nRoutley (1984b). \n\nIn formal ethics, Sylvan defended a non-classical deontic logic.\nRoutley and Plumwood (1989) argued that the existence of moral\ndilemmas establishes the need both for: (i) a non-classical\npropositional logic underpinning deontic logic; and (ii) the rejection\nof some other central principles of orthodox deontic logic, especially\nthe principle of deontic consistency \n\nand the Kantian principle ought-implies-can (since dilemmas create\nimpossible obligations). He argues that the sentential fragment of\ndeontic logic must be paraconsistent and a relevant logic is\nrecommended (see Section 2). \n\nSylvan saw his ethics as systematically connected with issues in\nsocial and political philosophy, extending out from “deep green\nethics” to a broader “deep green theory” that\n“includes a radical social and political theory, centred upon\nsocial anarchistic forms of organization … and elements of\nradical economic theory … There have to be changes in\nsocial and political arrangements … towards less consumptive,\npopulous and wasteful societies, and so on” (Sylvan and Bennett\n1994, 151). \n\nSome of these ideas are discussed at length in Routley and Routley\n(1980b) where alternative forms of economic and political organisation\nare first considered from an environmental perspective. Sylvan focuses\nhis attention on what he takes to be an evident failure of the\npolitical arrangements proposed in the West. According to him, the\ngreat limitations to the freedom of human beings, the uneven\ndistribution of wealth and, above all, the constant damages caused to\nthe environment are all symptoms of a disease that must be treated.\nSylvan argues for what he calls pluralist anarchism, (a form\nof socialist anarchism) abandoning any form of government, including\nthe minimal one defended by Robert Nozick (2013). \n\nSylvan’s work in moral theory helped pioneer the rise of\nenvironmental philosophy as a new sub-discipline and connected\nenvironmental issues with broader moral issues as well as issues in\npolitical and social philosophy. Drawing on other work in metaphysics\nand logic, he sought new non-anthropocentric moral foundations,\nheavily critical of both traditional ethics and emerging alternatives\nthat lacked clarity and rigour. \n\nThe overall picture that emerges from Sylvan’s work is of a\nbroad philosophy that draws on non-classical (relevant) logic, a\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and a neo-Meinongian value theory as a\nmeans of accounting for “common-sense” ways of talking\n(e.g., about things that do not exist), ways of valuing (e.g., the\nseeming intrinsic value of things in the natural world) and\nsocio-political arrangements (e.g., a pluralist\nanarchism). Sylvan’s work was radical, but rigorous; a rich\nmany-worlds semantics underpins formal analyses. His work was\ncontentious; many traditional philosophical “problems” are\nclaimed to be artefacts of faulty orthodox theories. And his work was\nexpansive; philosophy’s traditional role with the question\n“How are we to live?” is taken seriously. Above all,\nSylvan’s thought was unified and systematic: “What is\nsought is a theory of values which blends both with object-theory and\nwith deeper environmental theory…” (1986, 1). \n\nSylvan’s program was left unfinished when he died. Whatever one\nthinks of his bold statements (“a wild mixture of wonderfully\nincisive ideas and absolutely false claims,” as Meyer put it in\n1996), Sylvan pushes philosophers to recognize that many propositions\ntaken as facts are not unrestrictedly true, but rather are\nrelative to what assumptions one is making about logic,\nontology, and value. Changing those assumptions changes the\npossibilities. And Sylvan’s work urges us to be ready for more\npossibilities—even what is, as he put it, “beyond the\npossible” (this is the title of an unpublished manuscript cited\nin Routley 1980).","contact.mail":"d.hyde@uq.edu.au","contact.domain":"uq.edu.au"},{"date.published":"2019-12-09","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sylvan-routley/","author1":"Dominic Hyde","author2":"Filippo Casati","author1.info":"https://hpi.uq.edu.au/profile/388/dominic-hyde","author2.info":"https://sites.google.com/site/doctorzachweber/home","entry":"sylvan-routley","body.text":"\n\n\n\nRichard Sylvan (born Routley, 1935–1996) was an Australasian\nphilosopher who was instrumental in starting major schools in: logic\n(especially paraconsistent and relevant logic), metaphysics\n(especially Meinongian ontology), and ethics (especially environmental\nethics). In a large body of writing, Sylvan urged that, from logic to\necology, we are not now thinking well about big problems—but\nthat we can and must do better. “Philosophers fiddle while the\nworld begins to burn,” he wrote (Hyde 2014, vi). In response, he\nproposed a highly ambitious and radical philosophical project of\nre-evaluation, from foundations up, that has had ongoing impact in\nphilosophy (Casati, Mortensen & Priest 2018; Eckert (ed.) 2018;\nHyde (ed.) 2019, and Weber (ed.) 2019).\n\n\n\nSylvan is known for proposing and defending some highly controversial\nviews, arguing in favour of inconsistent theories, non-existent\nobjects, and non-human values. Such unorthodox claims were especially\nunpopular in the time Sylvan was writing, in the latter half of the\n20th century. But he thought it was vitally important, for\nphilosophy and for the world, that we take seriously ideas that run\nagainst conventions of the time. (As Robert Meyer put it, “To\nget the counter-suggestible Sylvan to defend some view, one needed\nfirst to remark that the view was now utterly discredited”,\nMeyer 1996.) What were widely thought to be untenable positions, such\nas Meinongianism, or failed theories, such as Cantor/Frege naïve\nset theory, attracted Sylvan’s attention for what he thought of\nas restoration:\n\n\nA large part of my philosophical life has, so it appears, looking back\n(and also looking forward) consisted in rehabilitating abandoned\nphilosophical dwellings, habitats, and landscapes. (Preface, Sylvan\nms. Philosophical Rehabilitation, quoted in Hyde 2014,\n124)\n\n\n\n\nHis contributions are all systematically tied together in the\nservice of a single project, around meaning and value, recognizing the\nlegitimacy and status of marginalized entities; for the landscapes he\nsought to rehabilitate had been, in his view,\n\n\n\nlaid waste or damaged by predecessors—too many of them, as\nthe predecessors adhered to an entirely defective set of\nvalues…(ibid.).\n\n\n\nHe sought to make these philosophical landscapes viable by improving\nthe way we reason about them, thereby casting them in a new light that\nshowed their deep interconnectedness.\n\n\n\nThis entry will use the name ‘Sylvan’, even though he\ndid not begin using that name until 1983. All his work published before\nthen uses his original name of ‘Routley’.\n\n\nSylvan was born in 1935 in Levin, New Zealand. He received his MA in\nPhilosophy from the University of New Zealand (Wellington) in 1957 and\nthe following year completed a first-class Honours degree in\nmathematics there. His MA thesis, a 385-page work entitled Moral\nScepticism was given a mark of 95% by Arthur Prior, though he\nlater commented that this was “not so much a mark as an\nexclamation mark” (quoted in D. Hyde, Introduction to Eckert\n(ed.) 2018, xiv). Blackwell agreed to publish a condensed version\nof the thesis but the required revisions were never undertaken. \n\nIn 1959, his teacher George Hughes then employed Sylvan to build a\nsmall electro-mechanical computer capable of determining whether input\nformulae were logical truths, logical falsehoods, or\nneither—with green, red and amber lights displaying the\nrespective outcomes. He worked out how to build it from scratch using\nrelays and uniselectors discarded by the post office and it was a\nsuccess, but when run some years later it drew so much power that it\nblacked out the building it was housed in, ruining several experiments\nin biology running in the building at the time. The Biology Department\ninsisted that it never be used again (Hyde 2014, 43). \n\nIn mid-1959, while bushwalking in Australia, he met Jack Smart (then\nin Adelaide, later a colleague at the Australian National University\nand good bushwalking friend thereafter) who encouraged him to go to\nPrinceton for graduate work, as opposed to the then more usual choice\nof UK universities like Cambridge. At Smart’s urging, “as\na brash young man” Sylvan travelled to Princeton with a\nFulbright scholarship for doctoral studies under Alonzo Church to\n“repair and renovate a derelict philosophy of science”\n(Sylvan 2000a, 7). After two and a half years he was awarded an MA\nfrom Princeton University but left before completing his PhD,\ndissatisfied with the intellectual climate there and subsequent lack\nof progress on his project. (He later received a PhD from Princeton in\n1980 for chapter one of Routley 1980.) He accepted a lectureship at\nSydney University in 1962 where he began lecturing undergraduates in\nlogic—introducing modern Russellian theory, displacing John\nAnderson’s long insistence on Aristotelian theory. There he met\nVal Plumwood (then Val Macrae, later Val Routley) and, in 1964, they\nmoved to the University of New England where Sylvan joined Len Goddard\nand a growing department—the first to have begun teaching modern\nlogic in Australia under Goddard in 1957. Goddard and Sylvan founded\nthe first Australian Masters program in logic and formed\nthe Australasian Association of Logic, and with Len Goddard,\nDavid Londey, Ross Brady, Malcolm Rennie and Val Plumwood, he\ndeveloped what became known as the New England Group—working on\nnon-classical logic and paradoxes, among other things—but\nGoddard left a few years later, returning to St Andrews in\nScotland. In 1967, with a year’s sabbatical owing, Sylvan and\nPlumwood married (with Plumwood taking the name Routley) and they\ndrove from the University to St Andrews to continue work with Goddard\n(traversing northern Australia, shipping the car from Darwin to\nSingapore, then overland into India and Pakistan, through the Middle\nEast and Eastern Europe). Upon return, in 1968, Sylvan took a\nposition at Monash University before being appointed to a Senior\nFellowship in Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences at\nthe Australian National University (ANU) in 1971, where he remained\nfor the rest of his career. With only postgraduate students to\nsupervise, his days teaching undergraduates was at an end. A number of\nresearchers from the New England Group subsequently joined him there\nand, with the addition of Bob Meyer, Graham Priest, and others, a\ngroup re-formed around Sylvan at the ANU—the well-known Canberra\nLogic Group that went on to pioneering research in non-classical,\nespecially relevant, logic. Through his contribution to the formation\nof research groups that were both innovative and productive, Sylvan\ninfluenced a whole generation of Australian philosophers and\nlogicians. (For more on this history of modern logic in Australia,\ncf. Routley 1984c, Goddard 1992, and Brady and Mortensen 2014.) \n\nThe natural world also fascinated Sylvan. By the time of his death\nhe had purchased, and worked to conserve, five large tracts of rich\nforest areas—four of which were subsequently bequeathed\nfor conservation.  He took such a delight in nature, not so much the\ndelight that a romantic might take in the overall beauty of it all,\nbut a delight in its richness and complexity, in the detail that he\nfound in the structure of mosses and in the behaviour of\ninsects. … It’s as if in a strange way he was part of it\n….  (quoted in D. Hyde, Introduction to Eckert (ed.)\n2018, xxv). \n\nWithin a year of arriving at the ANU (the centre of Australian\nforestry policy development), he and Plumwood became aware of plans\nfor extensive clearing of “useless” native forest for pine\nplantations across the country and so began work on a sustained\ncritique of Australian forestry practices (Routley and Routley 1973a)\nalongside joint work rethinking issues in environmental\nphilosophy. The critical and “pugilistic” style of the\nbook caused an uproar in forestry—with an attempt to suppress\nits publication (cf. Routley and Plumwood 1986). The repressive nature\nof the Australian forestry industry was widely understood from within,\nwith one forestry insider commenting, on receipt of a letter from\nSylvan early in the project, that: “for an Australian forester,\nreceiving a letter from you is somewhat akin to a new Party member\ngetting a birthday card from Alexander Solzhenitsyn” (Sylvan\nRSC, Box #45). Closer to home, they were also criticised by some\ncolleagues who, in the days before applied philosophy had come of age,\nsaw their work as “propaganda” rather than scholarly\nresearch. Despite resistance though, the book’s successful\npublication helped reform forestry in Australia, being subsequently\ndescribed by a leading forestry expert as “monumentally\nimportant” and “the most incisive and devastating economic\nanalysis of forestry … ever done in Australia” (Byron\n1999, 53). All three editions published through the ANU Press between\n1973 and 1975 sold out but by 1975 Sylvan was, remarkably, banned from\nusing the ANU’s Forestry Department Library (the central store\nfor documents relating to the development of national forestry policy)\nand further, planned editions were effectively stopped. \n\nIn 1975, Sylvan and Plumwood realised their dream of moving “off\ngrid” into the temperate rainforest in the coastal ranges east\nof Canberra where they began building a house from local stone (one of\nfive houses that Sylvan built over his life). Working first from a\ntent, then a shed, over the subsequent five years it took to build the\nhouse they produced much of their key work on relevant logic,\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and environmental philosophy—often\ndiscussing philosophy while building with graduate students and guests\nwho could be roped in to help. After a productive twenty-year\npartnership, Sylvan and Plumwood parted ways in 1983, and he married\nLouise Sylvan (née Merlin). That was also the year he changed\nhis name from ‘Richard Routley’ to ‘Richard\nSylvan’ while Val Routley, as she was then known, became Val\nPlumwood. Sylvan and Plumwood continued to work and correspond on\nclosely related themes in environmental philosophy until\nSylvan’s death in 1996. \n\nWhile his students and research assistants found him supportive and\nkind, Sylvan’s style sometimes offended his peers. He could be\nvery blunt in his assessment of other’s arguments and his shy\ndemeanour and lack of small talk did little to counteract feelings of\nrude-dismissal—friend and colleague Bob Meyer commenting that he\n“was a difficult man; not only did he fail to suffer fools\ngladly, but he often disdained suffering them at all” (Meyer\n1996). Sylvan himself also commented, for example, that his\n“Critique of Deep Ecology” (Sylvan 1985) would “risk\noffending many friends in the deeper ecology movement” (i) and,\nwhile he remained good friends with chief target Arne Naess, some\nwere, no doubt, offended. It earned him the title ‘the bad boy\nof deep ecology’ (Orton 2005, Other Internet\nResources)—still considered a “deep ecologist”\ndespite the substance of his criticism concluding in his rejecting\ndeep ecology in favour of what he termed “deep green\ntheory”. Some who took offense on reading his response to their\nwork would later go on to befriend and work with Sylvan, having gotten\npast his blunt exterior. But with opposing-authority there was rarely\nany rapprochement; his anti-authoritarianism was deep-rooted and his\nanarchist tendencies manifest—in both academic work and in his\nbehaviour. \n\nHis publishing habits also drew attention. Seeking an outlet for\nlonger papers and essays in the late 1970s, and wary of\n“profiteering” publishers, in the do-it-yourself spirit\nthat infused much of Sylvan’s life he began publishing a number\nof pre-print series in the Research School of Social Sciences where he\nworked at the ANU. Beginning with work of the Canberra Logic Group,\nthe “Yellow Series” (as it became known) included over\ntwenty publications by Group members between 1978 and 1985. There\nfollowed other Series including work in logic, metaphysics, the\nphilosophy of science and much of his own work in environmental\nphilosophy. In total, there were over fifty such publications of which\nover half were Sylvan’s own work. The publications ranged from\ntens of pages to hundreds and could be purchased by post from the\ndepartment for a few dollars. The largest, at just over one thousand\npages (Exploring Meinong’s Jungle and Beyond), for\nexample, was available in hardback for $10. Such anomalous publishing\nhabits meant that a considerable amount of his work is now very hard\nto access (though, in some cases, republication through more usual\nchannels is underway—e.g., Eckert (ed.) 2018; Hyde (ed.) 2019;\nand Weber (ed.) 2019). \n\nHe died in June 1996 aged 60, while entering a sacred temple in Bali\nto discuss Hindu philosophy with priests there. (For more details, see\nHyde 2014.) \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work in logic. As in other\nareas of his philosophy, Sylvan was notable for his staunch defence of\nhighly controversial and radical views—most strikingly, that\nclassical logic is wrong, that non-classical logic is right, and that\nsome contradictions may be true (see: dialetheism). What makes\nhis work worth remembering is that he backed up such claims with\nrigorous (if contentious) arguments and mathematical details. \n\nSylvan’s work in logic can be viewed in part as a response to\na wide range of paradoxes, such as the paradoxes of\nself-reference (like the Liar Paradox). He was equally focused on\nparadoxes of implication, and so was a leading developer of\nrelevant logics, logics characterized by their concern that\nthere be a meaningful connection between the antecedent and consequent\nof a conditional. These topics would lead him to be one of the founders\nof the so-called “Australasian school” of\nparaconsistent logic, logics that tolerate inconsistency\nwithout incoherence. He was perennially concerned with the\nuniversality of logic. Along with intrinsic interest, his\nlogical research was always motivated by its eventual application to\nissues in metaphysics, ethics, and beyond. \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work in neutral quantification\ntheory and significance logics. In both cases, he is concerned with\ngranting legitimacy to otherwise discredited or rejected\nentities—the existence (or lack thereof) of objects that seem\nlike perfectly good subjects of quantification in apparently true\nsentences; and the status of “nonsensical” sentences that\nseem like they are essential parts of good reasoning. \n\nFrom his earliest days at Princeton, Sylvan had argued that an\nadequate philosophy of science required quantification over\nnon-existent objects (numbers, frictionless planes, etc.), and an\nadequate semantics for fictional discourse was also best pursued along\nthese lines. (Cf. Routley 1965, 1966a, 1979a; Routley and Routley\n1973b, 1979a.) For reasons discussed in Section 3\nbelow, he followed Meinong in seeking a theory that includes\nnon-existent objects, and a logic that can handle such objects. \n\nA basic idea here (e.g., in Routley 1980) is to reassess the status of\nthe existential quantifier: \\(\\exists\\). It is commonplace\namongst logicians, especially since Russell 1905 and especially\nQuine’s article “On What There Is”, to read this\nas ontologically loaded; so if \\(\\exists x Ax\\) is true then\nsome \\(x\\) exists and has property \\(A\\). Sylvan urges that we\ndistinguish between particular claims (‘some \\(x\\) is\n\\(A\\)’) and existential claims\n(‘an existing \\(x\\) is \\(A\\)’). With the latter\nexistential reading, it is impossible to claim that some things just\ndo not exist; that amounts to saying something both exists and does\nnot exist, so it exists after all. But with the former\nparticular reading, the claim ‘some things do not\nexist’ comes out as intended, with its apparent natural language\nmeaning. Because the existential interpretation of the backward\n‘E’ symbol has become hopelessly entrenched, Sylvan\nintroduced new symbols, ‘P’ (for particular) and its dual\n‘U’ (universal), to act as neutral quantifiers.\nThus the logical ground was laid for subsequent work in neo-Meinongian\nmetaphysics (cf. Section 3). \n\nThis work, both the metaphysics and logic, led to a number of debates\nwith David Lewis. Lewis (1990) argues that the apparently deep\ndisagreement Sylvan has with ontologically loaded quantification might\nbe dispelled by a translation manual, between his unconventional\nMeinongian reading and a conventional one (cf. Priest 2005, Section\n7.9.): \n\nIf this is right, then it appears Sylvan is in danger of doing\nlittle more than quibbling about the use of the word\n‘exists’ when it comes to abstract objects. But Lewis is\nself-critically aware that any misunderstanding may be mutual, and\ncautions that \n\nTo suppose that [Sylvan] mistakes mere terminological difference for\nprofound philosophical disagreement is to accuse him of stupidity far\nbeyond belief (Lewis 1990, 30). \n\nWorry about communication difficulties between classical and\nnon-classical logicians would be voiced by Lewis again, eventually\ndeclining to debate at all (Lewis 1999, and cf. Smart 1977). \n\nWith the formation of the New England Logic Group, we find the first\ninstances of Sylvan pursuing the development of non-classical\nlogics as a response to a range of paradoxes. A preliminary\naspect to this work was the investigation of the fundamental notion of\nsignificance. \n\nEspecially in early 20th century philosophy, a popular\nmeans of dismissing various philosophical theses (say in metaphysics)\nwas “on the grounds that they are nonsense, nonsignificant,\nabsurd, meaningless, unintelligible, or logically odd” (Goddard\nand Routley 1973, 1). Such rejections are characteristic of logical\npositivism, taking a cue from Wittgenstein’s accusation that much\nof philosophy is “not false, but senseless\n[unsinnig]” [Tractatus 4.003] and therefore\neasy to ignore. By the late 1960s, it seemed to Routley and Goddard\nthat Russell and others had succeeded in promoting a\n“meaninglessness” solution to various paradoxes like the Liar\nsentence, or the Russell contradiction, \n\nthe set \\(R\\) of all sets that are not members of themselves is a\nmember of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself \n\nAccording to various Russell/Tarski type theories, sentences are\nregimented to levels of a hierarchy and restricted in scope about what\nthey can express; then liar-type sentences are, on this sort of\nsolution, “nonsense”. Appeal to non-significance is then\nmeant to avoid paradox. Goddard and Routley are concerned that\nphilosophers have been too eager to condemn theses that “are\nneither gibberish nor ungrammatical” (4). \n\nIn response, Routley (1966b), Brady and Routley (1973), and Goddard\nand Routley (1973) argue for a logic of significance for the formal\nstudy of significance. The ideas here can be summed up in three theses.\nFirst, there are grammatically correct natural language\nsentences, containing only recognized vocabulary (say of English),\nwhich “are held to be meaningless” (Goddard and Routley\n1973, 2); but “unlike seriously ungrammatical sentences,\n[they] can figure in valid arguments and can occur as unquoted\ncomponents of grammatical sentences” (Routley 1969, 367).\nSecond, such sentences require a non-classical and\nspecifically three-valued logic. Meaningless sentences still\nmust have some recognized status—and it is some status\nother than ‘true’ or ‘false’ (See Haack 1971,\n1975, and Bradley 1978 for alternatives). As Brady and Sylvan put\nit, \n\nWe believe that the deep structure of natural languages, and hence of\nthe languages in which philosophical problems are characteristically\nformulated, will have to be based on an enriched significance logic\nwhich has a third value—nonsense or nonsignificance—and\nnot on a classical two-valued logic which only has truth and falsity\nas its values (Brady and Routley 1973, 211). \n\nThird, all significance logics will need to be based on a\ncommon context logic, where a fixed context of use or\ncircumstance determines the ‘significance principles’ of\neach logic (Cocchiarella 1984; cf. Ripley 2012, 101). \n\nSylvan and Goddard want a logic that can track (as opposed to simply\ndeny) non-significant sentences, which we may think of as\ntruth-value gaps. Their proposed logic of significance may be\nunderstood (see Szmuc and Omori 2018) as being based on a three-valued\nlogic, weak Kleene, given by the following truth tables: \n\nThe intermediate value, \\(n\\) (for ‘nonsense’), is to\nbe read as, not a truth-value, but rather as a kind of\nmeaninglessness. These matrices respect two basic conditions laid down\nin (Goddard and Routley 1973, 260), that \n\nAn argument is valid on this logic iff there is no\nevaluation that interprets all the premises as true (value \\(t\\))\nbut the conclusion untrue (values \\(f\\) and \\(n\\)). This\nlogic was further investigated by Brady (1980) and Bunder (1979, 1980a,\n1980b). For criticism, see Lambert (1968) and Haack (1971, 1975). \n\nThis early work is transitional. Paradoxical sentences at this stage\nof Sylvan’s thinking may have a value, but certainly not that of\n‘true’ (or ‘false’). This relatively\nconservative attitude would begin to fall away as his thinking\ndeveloped. \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work as part of the Canberra\nLogic Group’s pioneering research on relevant and paraconsistent\nlogics, and applications to naïve set theory. In the mid-1970s,\nRoutley/Sylvan produced a closely interconnected body of work (1975;\nRoutley and Meyer 1976, 1977, 1979; Routley et al. 1982),\nmuch of it in collaboration with Val Plumwood (then Routley), Meyer,\nBrady, and Priest (e.g., Priest and Routley 1983), circling around a\nfew key ideas, the germs of which we have already met: universality;\nimplication and entailment; and inconsistency. We now visit these in\nturn. \n\nIn 1975 Sylvan took up the idea of a universal semantics\ndirectly (although the title of his paper “Universal\nSemantics?” is in the uncertain form of a question). Inspired by\nrecent advances in Montague grammar and categorial languages, he\nbecame speculatively interested in whether there is some common form\nbeneath all natural languages, that could be adequately represented\nthough logical symbolism. Specifically, he was interested in some\n“leading assumptions” of the time, namely (1975, 327): \n\nHere we can see two recurring concerns in Sylvan’s logical\nwork: a sceptical interest in the idea of a model-theoretic reduction\n(to be lambasted most vociferously with Meyer in their paper\n“Extensional Reduction” of 1977), and the uses of worlds\nsemantics to do it. \n\nAs an initial gloss, a universal semantics, whatever else it\nmay be, is intended to be a framework able to express everything that\ncan be expressed. As in Section 2.1, there should not be any\nartificial constraints placed on what we might be able to reason well\nabout (or, by extension, think about or imagine), nonsense or not. And\na universal logic should not have, as theorems, anything that\nis patently incorrect. Putting these two ideas together, Sylvan was\nalready convinced that “classical logic” is too strong to\nserve as the basis for any universal semantics, because\nit cannot express everything that is expressible, such as\nmany intensional notions; and it does deliver apparently\nnonsensical theses such as the paradoxes of material implication (see\nSection 2.2.2 below). (These two aspects of a logic—the extent\nof the class of models it can describe, and the set of validities it\nyields—are inversely proportional; cf. Priest 2008,\n36–7.) \n\nOn these grounds, Sylvan looked increasingly at non-classical logics\nas a better framework or foundation for any universal semantics. His\n1977 manifesto “Ultralogic as universal?” introduces the\ntitular subject (note again the question mark) as follows: \n\nA universal logic, in the intended sense, is one which is applicable\nin every situation whether realised or not, possible or not. Thus a\nuniversal logic is like a universal key, which opens, if rightly\noperated, all locks. It provides a canon for reasoning in every\nsituation, including illogical, inconsistent and paradoxical ones. Few\nprevailing logics stand up to such a test. … [A] universal\nlogic should be adequate for mathematical and philosophical\npurposes—and also for logical functions in other areas such as\nbiology, economics, astrology, theology, and so on (893). \n\nApproaching any universal logic, according to Sylvan, would require\nextending the expressive power of classical logic, and concomitantly\nrestricting its proving power. \n\nTwo possible misinterpretations of this “universalist”\nproject should be flagged. First, Sylvan did not argue that some\nspecific alternative logic is the absolutely correct one, or even that\nthere should be one and only one correct alternative (see Section\n3.3). Second, although he can sound rhetorically partisan and\nideological, Sylvan’s approach was ultimately rather pragmatic:\nhe couched theory choice in practical cost/benefit analyses familiar\nfrom conventional philosophy of science (Routley 1980a). On the\nmeaning of ‘universality’ in this context see Mares (2019)\nand Nolan (2018). Brady’s 2006 book takes its title in part from\nSylvan’s announced project, with a focus on logics for\n“meaning containment”. \n\nFaced with the limitations of classical logic, Sylvan joined in the\nproject of refining C.I. Lewis’s strict implication to\novercome various paradoxes of the conditional. (See the encyclopedia\nentry on indicative conditionals.) For, according to the classical\naccount of material implication \\(\\supset\\), for any three random\ndeclarative sentences \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\) you find on the Internet, \\(\n(p \\supset q) \\lor (q \\supset r) \\) is valid (to take just one\nexample; see Routley et al. 1982, 6–7). One diagnosis\nof the problem here is that all these conditionals, of the form\n‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)’, display irrelevance: the\nantecedent \\(p\\) need not have anything “to do with” the\nconsequent \\(q\\), whereas correct natural language conditionals (so\nthe argument goes) always respect some kind of relevant\nconnection. The problem may be resolved by turning to an appropriate\nrelevant logic. \n\nSylvan is explicit, though, that his “main concern is not really\nrelevance at all—the appropriate sort of relevance is a\nby-product of any good implication relation, which comes out in the\nwash” (Routley et al. 1982, x) after a deeper diagnosis\nof the paradoxes. He emphasizes that what is really at issue for a\nsuccessful account of a conditional is absolute\nsufficiency—that when \\(p\\) really does imply \\(q\\), this\nmeans that \\(p\\) is all that is needed for \\(q\\). \n\nThe central deducibility relation of ultramodal logics, entailment, is\nintended to capture the notion of sufficiency … of the\nantecedent of an entailment on its own, without any additional\nimported truth, especially imported logical truths. …\nSufficiency is a go-anywhere notion, which is not limited by the fact\nthat the situation in which it operates is somehow classically\nincoherent, e.g., inconsistent or paradoxical. If \\(A\\) is sufficient\nfor \\(B\\) then it does not matter what else goes on; logical laws may\ngo haywire but nothing subtracts from \\(A\\)’s sufficiency (1977,\n896). \n\nSo while Sylvan’s contribution to relevant logic was seminal,\nhis concerns diverged from some other “relevantists”. In\nsome otherwise highly critical remarks, Burgess (1983, 45) writes that\n“Routleyanism and Andersonianobelnapianism are so dissimilar\nthat it is misleading to apply a single label\n‘relevantism’ to both. (And indeed, [Sylvan] sometimes\nadopts a different label.)” \n\nThe diagnosis of the paradoxes of implication as failures of respect\nfor sufficiency leads naturally to an alternative path to their\nresolution, of a piece with Sylvan’s concerns about\nuniversality. On this view, the paradoxes of implication are symptoms\nof taking\ntoo few possibilities into account. One may think of\nclassical material implication as taking only one situation\ninto account, giving rise to theorems like ‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\),\nor if \\(q\\) then \\(p\\)’, since either \\(p\\) is true (in which\ncase, \\(p\\) or \\(\\twiddle q\\) is true, and so q materially\nimplies \\(p\\)) or else \\(p\\) is false (in which case, \\(\\twiddle p\\)\nor \\(q\\) is true, and so \\(p\\) materially\nimplies \\(q\\)). This is immediately resolved upon consideration\nof two possibilities,\n\\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\), \n\nand thinking of ‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)’ as meaning\nthat in every world in which \\(p\\), also\n\\(q\\), i.e., \n\nThen ‘\\(p \\rightarrow q, \\mathrm{or}\\, q \\rightarrow p\\)’\nhas a counterexample, points at which p holds\nwithout q and vice versa, showing a failure of sufficiency\nexactly because more worlds are considered. \n\nThe key to solving the paradoxes and approaching universality, on\nthis approach, is to broaden the collection of worlds, in order to\nsieve out what sufficiency relations persist. Sylvan extends this\nstrategy to deal with other paradoxes of implication, such as the\nirrelevant \\( q \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow p) \\).\n\n \n\nSince \\(p\\) does imply \\(p\\), \\(p \\rightarrow p\\), i.e., at\nevery world in which \\(p\\), also \\(p\\), then to show that arbitrary\n\\(q\\) is not sufficient for this self-implication, there needs to be a\ncounterexample: one where \\(q\\) holds without \\(p \\rightarrow\np\\). Generally, to preserve sufficiency, the same strategy goes for\nany logical truth, \\(B\\): if we are to avoid \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) when\n\\(B\\) is logically necessary but irrelevant to \\(A\\), there must be\npoints at which even logical truths fail. For example, there\nwould be a world at which the law of non-contradiction \\(\\twiddle (A\n\\amp \\twiddle A)\\) fails. These points are known as non-normal or\nimpossible worlds, about which there is a growing literature (e.g.,\nNolan 2013; Berto and Jago 2019). \n\nThe logics being proposed here, then, are naturally\nparaconsistent: they do not validate the “spread”\nlaw: (\\(p \\amp \\twiddle p) \\rightarrow q\\), and so can putatively\nhandle inconsistency without collapse into triviality. (In\nSociative Logics, Sylvan refers to these as\npararelevant logics.) Indeed, with counterexamples to the law\nof non-contradiction, there would be worlds where some sentences\nare both true and false. \n\nThe first relevant logics were presented proof theoretically, in terms\nof axioms and closure under rules. The need for a model theoretic\ninterpretation (given in a classical metatheory) resulted in\nSylvan’s co-development with Plumwood of ternary relation\nsemantics for first degree entailment relevant logics (Routley and\nRoutley 1972) and the ensuing Routley-Meyer partnership that proved\nand extended a range of results for relevant logics (cf. Routley,\nMeyer, et al. 1982; and Brady 2003). (Cf. Fine 1974; Urquhart\n1972.) A Routley-Meyer frame \\(\\langle W, N, 0, R, {}^*\n\\rangle\\) consists of: \n\nAn evaluation then assigns formulas a truth-value at each world; so\nsome \\(p\\) may be true at one world but false at another. With the\nRoutley star, these may even be the same world. The conditions on\nimplication and negation are as follows: \n\nNothing prevents both \\(A\\) and \\(\\twiddle A\\) being true at some\nworlds; indeed, respecting relevance demands it. These conditions can\nbe seen as generalizations of more standard ones: in the case\nof implication, if \\(y = z\\) then this is just a modalized material\nconditional in a Kripke frame; in the case of negation, if \\(x = x^*\\)\nthen this is just the clause for negation in classical logic. For\nfurther details, see the entry on relevance logic, Mares (2004), and\nPriest (2008, ch. 10). On the Routley star see Restall (1999). \n\nRoutley/Myer semantics has generated an enormous secondary literature\n(cf. the secondary literature section of the bibliography), for\nexample Copeland 1979, 1983, Thomas 2015. Debates have surrounded:\nthe interpretation of the semantics (e.g., the ternary relation, the\nRoutley-star operator, non-normal worlds); alternative semantics for\nrelevant logics; the adequacy of non-classical responses to semantic\nand set-theoretic paradoxes; dialetheism; and naïve set\ntheory. For recent work about the ternary relation see Beall et al\n2012; for a recent exchange about the Routley star and negation, see\nBerto 2015, De and Omori 2018, and Berto and Restall 2019. \n\nSylvan’s instrumental need for inconsistent worlds in order to\naccount for implication led to tentative endorsement of the\npossibility of true contradictions (dialetheism). Most relevant\nlogicians thought of these “worlds” merely as artefacts of\nthe semantics, not as legitimate possibilities\n(indeed—they’re impossible!); but there the idea was, of\n“dialectical” or contradictory worlds. By (1976), he and\nMeyer consider a rather literal interpretation of Hegelian dialectic,\nand openly question the “Consistency Hypothesis” that the\nworld is consistent. They urge instead a “dialectical”\npossibility. They present the (relevant) logic DL (for\ndialectical logic), and give it an axiomatization that explicitly\nincludes an outright contradiction \\(p \\amp \\twiddle p\\) as\nan axiom. (Smiley calls this “Routley and Meyer’s\nwar work” (Smiley and Priest 1993, 17). See also van Benthem\n1979, Havas 1981.) \n\nWhen Graham Priest arrived in Australia and presented his\n‘Logic of Paradox’ to the 1976 meeting of the Australasian\nAssociation of Logic, another intensely productive partnership was\nstruck. With true contradictions—later to be named\ndialetheia by Sylvan and Priest—in view, the potential\nof surpassing classical logic opened up: \n\nThe liberating effect of giving up the classical faith … is\nimmense: … one is free to return to something like the grand\nsimplicity of naive set theory, to semantically closed natural\nlanguages (having abandoned the towering but ill-constructed and\nmostly unfinished hierarchies of formal languages), and to intuitive\naccounts of truth, of proof, and of many other intensional notions\n(1979b, 302). \n\nDialetheism, especially due to Priest, has prompted a long and growing\ndiscussion (see Priest 1987 [2006] and Beall 2009 for defences and e.g.,\nField 2008 for some useful criticism; see the bibliography in the\nentry on dialetheism for more). \n\nSylvan’s thinking about contradictions evolved, depending on his\nco-author, even over the course of a book. In Relevant Logics and\ntheir Rivals (1982), early chapters float dialetheism as a\nhypothesis, in an “agnostic” spirit (61), or that of\ntaking precautions; whereas later in the book, it states bluntly that\n“mathematics is inconsistent” (255). (The shift is\ncriticized by Urquhart in a 1988 review (Brady 2003, 2).) \n\nAs mentioned in the quote above, Sylvan saw that something like the\n“dialectical logic” DL could be used to\nunderwrite inconsistent but non-trivial mathematical and scientific\ntheories, which had been of interest to him since the start. Of\nparticular note is naïve set theory, used by Cantor, Dedekind,\nand Frege in the foundations of mathematics (see the entry on the\nearly development of set theory), but dealt an apparently fatal blow\nby Russell’s paradox circa 1900. Building from work by Brady\n(1971), naïve set theory as formulated with the implication\nconnective ‘\\(\\rightarrow\\)’ of DL (or the\nslightly weaker DK) takes as axioms that there is a set for\nevery property \\(A\\), i.e.,  \n\nwhere ‘\\(\\in\\)’ is read ‘is a member of’ and\nwith Sylvan’s preferred particular and universal quantifiers\n(see Section 2.1); and that sets are determined by their members,\ni.e., \n\nOn the basis of these axioms, comprehension and\nextensionality, in Routley (1977) he begins to sketch out\nwhat he hopes will be the “rehabilitation” of naïve\nset theory and more using ultralogic. \n\nA basic derivation in this set theory is that the Russell set exists,\nand is both a member of itself and not a member of itself. The\nparadoxes, in other words, are proofs, and the resulting\ncontradictions are theorems (1979b, 302). Sylvan sketches the\nfurther work needed to show that elementary principles such as the\nZermelo-Fraenkel axioms and their immediate consequences can be\nderived. And he speculates, much more ambitiously, that the Axiom of\nChoice and the Continuum Hypothesis could be decided as well; see\nWeber (2012). Priest 2006, chapter 18 is a discussion\nof paraconsistent set theory in this tradition. \n\nThe project was given an essential boost when Brady confirmed the\nnon-triviality of the theory in the late 70s, i.e., that there are\n(absurd) sentences that cannot be proved in this theory,\nresults which appeared as Brady (1989); see (Brady 2006). Further work\nin relevant arithmetic, by Routley, Meyer, Mortensen, Dunn, Priest,\nRestall, and others, followed. This led to the area now known as\ninconsistent mathematics, carried forward especially by\nMortensen (1995, 2010), where e.g., the Routley star is used as a\nfunctor to great effect; see the entry on inconsistent\nmathematics for further references. \n\nThis section mentions briefly some other applications of\nSylvan’s preferred logics to a wide range of philosophical\nproblems. Sylvan saw applications as a test for the choice of such\ntheories over rival logics. Sections 3 and 4 are in a way extended\ndiscussions of such applications. Sylvan argued that relevant and,\nmore broadly, what he termed “sociative logics” had\napplications in areas as diverse as causation, an analysis of\nknowledge, vagueness (including the idea that there are vague objects;\nsee Sylvan and Hyde 1993), and value theory. Here we sketch two such\napplications, in confirmation, and computation. \n\nFollowing Goddard (1977), Sylvan (along with Nola, in 1991) applies\nrelevant logic to solve the paradoxes of confirmation made\nfamous by Hempel. These are problems in philosophy of science about\nformulating inductive generalizations such as \nwhich is confirmed by instances of things which are both black and\nravens; but the universal generalization is logically equivalent to\nits contrapositive form \n\nwhich would similarly be confirmed by any non-black non-raven; but\nsince e.g., a red pencil is obviously not confirmation that\nall ravens are black, something has gone wrong. For Sylvan, the\nproblem—as is often his diagnosis—lies in the\nformalization of the natural language claims—“It is\nwell-known in relevance circles that the most outrageous of these\nparadoxes are automatically removed by replacement of the material\nconditional …” (2000a, 227). “A relevance\nshift,” he argues with typical restraint, “is a sure-fire\nway of knocking out all the paradoxes of confirmation” (2000a,\n232.). For discussion, see Fitelson (2006). \n\nAlong other lines, Sylvan made tentative steps in the foundations of\nrecursion theory, towards a non-classical theory of computation (cf.\nCopeland and Sylvan 1999; Sylvan 2000a). According to work by Turing,\nChurch, and Gödel in the 1930s, computers face logical limits on\nwhat they can compute (see the entry on the Church-Turing thesis and\nthe entry on computability and complexity). Uncomputability proofs,\nthough, bear a very strong resemblance to the derivations of\nRussell’s paradox and other diagonal paradoxes. If\n“dialectical” logic can be used to solve those paradoxes,\nthough—essentially, by accepting that they have truly\ncontradictory conclusions (see Section 2.2 above)—then could the\nsame be done in the case of computers? Then the conclusion would\nbe, not that there are uncomputable algorithms, but rather\n“there are more algorithmic functions than all algorithmic\nfunctions” (2000a, 195). Sylvan envisions “dialeth[e]ic\nmachines”; cf. Weber (2016). \n\nSylvan’s approach to logic is of a piece with his work in\nmetaphysics and ethics: a polemical rebuke of the perceived powers of\nthe day—in the case of logic, the hegemony of classical\nlogic—and a highly imaginative and open-minded attitude towards\nwhat sorts of entities—possible and impossible alike—our\nbest theories should condone. We turn now to these other aspects of\nhis work. \n\nIn this section, we present Sylvan’s work in ontology and\nmetaphysics. As discussed below, Sylvan was deeply inspired by Alexius\nMeinong but, as a matter of terminology, their understanding of\n‘ontology’ and ‘metaphysics’ differ: while\nMeinong would situate metaphysics and ontology as small corners within\na more general object theory, Sylvan situated them the other way\naround. (See, for instance, Meinong 1904, §2 and §11; Sylvan\n1995a, 47). In what follows, we follow Sylvan and employ what we take\nto be contemporary standard usage of ‘ontology’ (roughly\nunderstood as the study of what exists and what does not) and\n‘metaphysics’ (roughly understood as the study of the\nstructure of reality), while acknowledging that Meinong-scholars might\ndispute this use of terms. In Section 3.1, we sketch some of the\nessential features of noneism, that is, Sylvan’s theory\nabout non-existent objects. In Section 3.2, we discuss Sylvan’s\nattempt at expanding the horizons of traditional ontology by\ndeveloping a new theory called sistology. Finally, in Section\n3.3, we summarize Sylvan’s heterodox account of pluralism,\nlabelled plurallism. \n\nFrom 1965 on, Sylvan argued that, through the influence of Quine,\ncontemporary philosophy is committed to a fundamental mistake. Such a\nmistake, labelled the “Ontological Assumption” (cf. 1980),\nis represented by the view that one cannot make true statements about\nwhat does not exist. In opposition to this idea, Sylvan develops a\ntheory about (non-existent) objects or, in Sylvan’s jargon,\nitems—noneism. \n\n[Noneism is] a very general theory of all items whatsoever, of those\nthat are intensional and those that are not, of those that exist and\nthose that do not (…); it is a theory of the logic and\nproperties and kinds of properties of all items (1980,\n5–6) \n\nSylvan’s intuition is that, in order to be able to say something\ntrue about non-existent items, we need to allow for the possibility\nthat non-existent items have properties. For instance, in order to be\nable to say that ‘Sherlock Holmes is a detective’ is true,\nSherlock Holmes needs to have the property of\nbeing a detective. Now, according to Sylvan, a suitable\nphilosophical background for supporting this intuition is\nMeinong’s Theory of Objects. For this reason, in\nExploring Meinong’s Jungle and Beyond (Routley 1980),\nSylvan tries to deliver a modern logical presentation of\nMeinong’s philosophy. He writes: \n\nMeinong’s theory provides a coherent scheme for talking and\nreasoning about all items, not just those which exist, without the\nnecessity for distorting or unworkable reductions; and in doing so it\nattributes … features [properties] to nonentities [non-existent\nobjects] (1980, iv–v). \n\nAt nearly 1000 pages, Routley (1980) develops noneism in great\ndetail. We summarize it in five main theses, which represent the core\nassumptions of what Sylvan calls minimal noneism (from now on\nMN). First of all, following Meinong’s account\nof intentionality, Sylvan believes that: \n\n(1980, 1–2; 352). In other words, every time we refer to\nsomething, we refer to an item. If I tell a story about Sherlock\nHolmes, I tell a story about an item, namely that item that is the\nsubject matter of my story. \n\nThe second thesis is that: \n\n(1980, 2–3). Sylvan follows Meinong in claiming that some items\nexist (e.g., the Eiffel Tower) and some others do not (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes). Like Meinong, Sylvan treats existence as a property: some\nitems have the property of being red and some other items do\nnot; some items have the property of being existent (e.g.,\nthe Eiffel Tower) and some items do not (e.g., Sherlock Holmes). When\nitems do not have the property of being existent, they are\nnon-existent items. In Sylvan’s jargon, they are\n“nonentities”. \n\nFurthermore, according to the third and fourth theses: \n\n(1980, 2–3), and \n\n(1980, 2–3). Thesis (MN3)\ncorresponds to Meinong’s indifference principle: the\nproperties an item has are indifferent to the ontological status of\nthe item itself. Thesis (MN4) corresponds\nto Meinong’s independence principle: an item’s\nhaving properties is independent of whether the item in\nquestion exists or not. \n\nAs many have pointed out (cf. Russell 1905 and 1907; see also Berto\n2013 and Priest 2005), the original theory defended by Meinong faces\nproblems. In particular, Meinong’s theory is threatened by\ntriviality (Berto 2013, 106–107); that is, the\nsituation in which everything exists—including items that\nclearly do not.  E.g., if I refer to not just to Sherlock Holmes but\nto “the\nexisting Sherlock Holmes”, then it seems\nby (MN4) that Sherlock Holmes exists. \n\nIn order to resolve this issue, Sylvan makes two moves. First of all,\nhe introduces the distinction between characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties. The former are necessary in order to\ndefine the essence of an object. A characterizing property is a\nproperty (e.g., being a detective or being smart)\nthat is necessary in order to make a specific item (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes) the item that it is. Using Sylvan’s words: \n\nCharacterizing predicates [or properties] are those which specify what\nan item is like, in itself. They tell how an item is in fact. They\ngive its description. A good dossier of an item would perhaps give its\ncharacterization first, by way of its characterization features [or\nproperties] (Sylvan 1995b). \n\nOn the other hand, the non-characterizing properties are all those\nproperties that are not characterizing. According to Sylvan, the\nproperty of being existent is a non-characterizing\nproperty. \n\nAs it has been extensively argued in the secondary literature (see,\nfor instance, Priest 2005), the difference between these two kinds of\nproperties is unclear. It is also fair to say that, even though some\n(neo-)Meinongians have tried to cash out such a distinction in more\nprecise terms (see, for instance, Jacquette 2015 and 2017; Parsons\n1978 and 1980), there is little consensus that any progress has been\nmade. That being said, even though it is certainly difficult to have\nstrict criteria to separate the characterizing properties from the\nnon-characterizing ones, it is absolutely clear that: \n\n(1980, 2). This is the fifth and last thesis. \n\nThe second move Sylvan makes in response to the triviality problem is\nrepresented by the idea that, even though it is the case that every\ntime we refer to something we refer to an item, the item in question\nhas characterizing properties. Following Berto (2013), we can also say\nthat, consistent with some other neo-Meinongians (i.e., Jacquette 2015;\nParsons 1980), Sylvan argues in favour of the following\ncharacterization principle: \n\nfor any set of characterizing properties, some item satisfies\nit. \n\nConsider, for example, Sherlock Holmes. When we refer to Sherlock\nHolmes, we refer to an item (because of\n(MN1)). Moreover, even though Sherlock\nHolmes does not exist (because of (MN2)),\nhe has some characterizing properties (because of\n(MN3) and\n(MN4)). For instance, according to\nDoyle’s novels, Sherlock Holmes is a smart detective. If so, in\nSherlock Holmes’s set of characterizing properties, there are, at\nleast, two properties: being a detective and being\nsmart. However, the property being non-existent is not in\nthis set because it is a non-characterizing property. And this is\nguaranteed by (MN5). \n\nAs we have already specified above, minimal noneism is merely\nthe core of Sylvan’s noneism which is more elaborate and\nsophisticated than sketched here. Exactly because of its complexity,\nnoneism forces us to rethink some of our traditional approaches to\nimportant philosophical topics. Examples are intensionality,\nnonexistence, impossibilia, and paradoxicality. Moreover, in the light\nof these conceptual innovations, Sylvan also discusses some of the\nrelevant applications of noneism in philosophy of mathematics (cf.\n1980, 769–781 and 791–833), philosophy of perception\n(cf. 1980, 649–678), philosophy of time (cf. 1980,\n361–410); philosophy of science (cf. 1980, 781–791) and\nphilosophy of fiction (cf. 1980, 537–595). \n\nSylvan spent many years developing and defending noneism, but he was\nnot entirely satisfied with it. He had two major complaints. On the\none hand, he thought that his way of presenting noneism was\nrhetorically problematic: EMJB was too long, rambling, and not\nincisive enough. As such, EMJB needed to be rewritten (see Sylvan\n1995b). On the other hand, he aimed at “liberalizing\nnoneism” by allowing all items to have both characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties (Sylvan 1995b). Archival documents show\nthat, to this end, Sylvan tried to develop a new theory that has many\nfeatures in common with so-called “modal Meinongianism”,\nrecently defended by Priest. On these issues, see Casati (2018),\nGriffin (2018), Kroon (2019), Priest (2005). \n\nIn late life, Sylvan aimed at enriching the ideas defended in Routley\n(1980) by developing what he calls “sistology”. On the one\nhand, sistology adopts all the fundamental ideas of noneism. Like\nnoneism, sistology includes items that do not exist (cf. Sylvan 1991,\n837; 1997, 11–12) and it accepts that those items have\nproperties (cf. 1991, 838–39). On the other hand, sistology\ndevelops and enriches noneism in the following ways. \n\nTo begin with, Sylvan tried to move the focus of his attention from\nthe existence (or non-existence) of items to their being\nitems. Using Sylvan’s words, sistology is concerned with\n“all items as having standing” (1991, 838).\nThus, sistology aims at casting a new light on what it means to be\nan item instead of showing that it is possible to have\nnon-existent items. The latter project was the unique task of\nnoneism. \n\nSecondly, Sylvan tried to extend and deepen the catalogue of items he\ndealt with in Routley (1980). In an unpublished manuscript, Sylvan\ndescribed an imaginary museum in which all sorts of items are\naccepted. Among those items that have not been (comprehensively)\ndiscussed in his (1980), Sylvan listed: \n\nIn particular, Sylvan devoted significant effort to this last cluster\nof items, underscoring the idea they require the employment of a\nparaconsistent logic. Given that inconsistent items have inconsistent\nproperties, if classical logic is employed then triviality immediately\nfollows. In order to avoid trivialism, the adoption of a\nparaconsistent logic is required. \n\nConsider, for instance, inconsistent objects. (…) By virtue of\nwhat they are, they have contradictory properties, thereby\ntrivializing any theory built upon mainstream logic. An authentic\nsistology requires logical reformulation of a more demanding\nparaconsistent type (Sylvan 1991, 839). \n\nThe third and last attempt to develop noneism is represented by a\nserious engagement with the notion of a “source”. As he\nhad already discussed, a “source” is what allows us to\nunderstand the charactering properties that an item (cf. 1980, 463;\n1995a). The source of Anna Karenina’s characterizing properties\nis Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina. In sistology, Sylvan aims\nat deepening our understanding of sources by admitting that not all of\nthem are equally reliable. For instance, optical illusions teach us\nthat visual perceptions are not always a trustworthy source for\ncharacterizing the items we see. For this reason, Sylvan suggests\nintroducing two kinds of predicates. The first kind (call them\n“ordinary predicates”) tell us how items look;\nthe second kind (call them “non-ordinary\npredicates”) tell us how items really are. \n\nNot all sources are always reliable or otherwise satisfactory; for\nexample, perceptual sources are notoriously unreliable as to how\nthings really are. (…) Thus, [the] division of\n[ordinary and non-ordinary] properties is presumed (1991, 839; italics\nours). \n\nSistology, which is only sketched by Sylvan, nevertheless anticipates\nsome of the ideas currently debated among neo-Meinongians, for\nexample, as discussed above, with “items in general”.\nRegardless of the existence or non-existence of these items, sistology\nconcerns their “having standing” (1991, 839). In so doing,\nSylvan focuses his attention on one of the most under-researched\nnotions of Meinong’s theory of objects, that is, the so-called\ndoctrine of Outsidebeing [Aussersein]. Only recently\nhave neo-Meinongian started to turn their attention to this topic\n(Casati and Priest 2017; Grossman 1974; Jacquette 2015). So too with\nthe very particular kind of object that is “nothingness”\n(cf. Sylvan 1995a). After a long-standing lack of interest in these\ntopics, neo-Meinongians have begun to take them into serious\nconsideration as well (Casati and Fujikawa 2019; Priest 2014a and\n2014b; Jacquette 2013). \n\nIn the current philosophical landscape, there are many different forms\nof pluralism on offer. For instance, there is an\nontological form of pluralism (there are different ways of\nbeing), truth pluralism (there are different ways of being\ntrue), and there is a logical form of pluralism (there is\nmore than one correct logic; see the entry on logical\npluralism). However, it is almost universally assumed, if mostly\nunstated, that there can be no pluralism about the actual\nworld—this one is the only\nactual one. As should appear clear from this entry, though,\nSylvan was accustomed to challenging the philosophical consensus. He\nbegan by attacking classical logic, he continued by questioning the\nso-called Ontological Assumption and, late in his career, he decided to\nchallenge what he calls one-world-ism, that is, the idea that\nthere is only one actual world. \n\nSylvan argues that there is a plurality of actual worlds we all live\nin. In his Transcendental Metaphysics (1997) he claims: \n\nA theme, to be defended at length, is that while there is\nan actual world, which is suitably external,\nmind-independent, perceiver-independent, and the like, it is not\nunique. There are many actual worlds. That theme is bound to\nstrike others, as it still occasionally strikes me momentarily, as\nutterly outrageous. [My] work and arguments are designed to remove\nthis misconception (1997, 4). \n\nIn order to draw a clear distinction between his pluralism and the\nothers, he refers to his own theory with a neologism:\nplurallism. The aims of such a theory are summarized as\nfollows: \n\nThe overarching themes of plurallism are (…): (1) There is\nno unique world. There is no unique actual universe; (2)\nThere is no one unalterable truth; no single Way of Truth; (3)\nThere is no single correct Scientific Theory (1997,\n4). \n\nIn order to support these ideas, Sylvan presents two sets of\narguments. \n\nSylvan argues indirectly there is a lack of (good) arguments\nin favour of the uniqueness of the actual world. From the fact that\nthere is such a thing as an actual world it does not necessarily\nfollow that such a world is unique, nor is its uniqueness observable\n(cf. 1997, 54–60). \n\nOn the other hand, he directly supports plurallism by arguing\nthat for each area of research, there is (or there could be) a\nplurality of correct theories. His reasoning goes as follows. All\ntheories are grounded on logic because logic is necessary for\nreasoning about both the data used by those theories and the theories\nthemselves. And, if there is, not just one, but a plurality of\ncorrect logics, there is (or there could be) a plurality of\ncorrect theories which spring from all those different, but all\nequally acceptable, ways of reasoning as well (cf. 1997,\n61–74). From this, a plurality of actual worlds follows if we\naccept two enthymematic assumptions. The first one is that any correct\nlogic, in virtue of its being correct, properly describes an actual\nworld. If so, if there is more than one correct logic, there is more\nthan one actual world too. The second assumption, then, is that there\nare many correct logics. This idea was not shared by Sylvan’s\ncontemporaries but one that he came to defend late in his career,\nclaiming (1997, xix) “that not merely is there a plurality of\nlogics, but there is also [a plurality] of correct logics”. The\nidea is elaborated on in Sylvan (1997, ch. 4) and is now widely\ndiscussed in the literature (see, for instance, Beall and Restall\n2000; Russell 2008; Weber 2017b). Sylvan claims that phenomenological\ndata seems to support plurallism as well (cf. 1997,\n118–133). \n\nSylvan’s motivations for developing plurallism are not uniquely\nphilosophical. On the contrary, he believes that the existence of the\nplurality of actual worlds can have important political consequences\ntoo. One of those consequences is the extension and strengthening of\nour idea of tolerance. According to Sylvan, intolerant behaviours are\noften, if not always, grounded on ideologies driven by what he calls\nthe “one-true-way” (1997, 462) or the\n“one-admissible-way” (1997, 462). Governments,\nreligious groups, and even scientists believe that “truth should\nbe imposed” (1997, 462) where truth is what is uniquely\ndetermined by them. Plurallism invites us to entertain the idea that,\nas there is no such thing as a unique actual world, there is no such\nthing as a unique truth. And this should undermine the ideological\nroots of intolerant behaviours. \n\nIn many ways, Sylvan’s philosophical and logical research is\ndevoted to the attempt to be inclusive, open-minded, and, therefore,\ntolerant. Contra the Quinean admiration for desert landscape,\nSylvan admired an over-crowded jungle of ideas in which different\nlogics, all sorts of items, and a plurality of actual worlds could\npeacefully coincide. \n\nIn this section we describe Sylvan’s work in moral philosophy.\nHis seminal and frequently reprinted (1973; see also SEP entry\n“Environmental Ethics” Section 2) was, alongside Naess\n(1973), the first published work in environmental ethics and began a\ncentral debate in the area, one concerned with intrinsic value in\nnature. Elaborated on in Routley and Routley (1979b) and (1980a), this\nwork developed arguments against what he termed “human\nchauvinism”—the view that humans are exceptional in being\nthe sole locus of intrinsic value, all else having merely instrumental\nvalue. Alongside this work in environmental ethics more broadly, which\nwas to continue until his death, he also published in defence of\npacifism, against nuclear war, and was one of the first philosophers\nto point to the emerging moral issues associated with anthropogenic\nglobal warming. \n\nDeveloping out of influential work condemning Australian forestry\npractices in the early 1970s, (cf. Routley and Routley 1973a, Byron\n1999), Routley (1973)—“Is There a Need for a New, an\nEnvironmental, Ethic?”—presents a thought experiment\ndesigned to test what Sylvan took to be a core principle of Western\nethical systems, the Freedom Principle: \n\nOne should be able to do what he wishes, providing (1) that he does\nnot harm others and (2) that he is not likely to harm himself\nirreparably (1973, 15) \n\nHe calls this principle basic human chauvinism “because\nunder it humans, or people [whether present or future], come first and\neverything else a bad last”—a view later characterized as\n“anthropocentric” in the much expanded discussion of The\nLast Man Example in Routley and Routley (1980a, cf. 96). \n\nWe are invited to consider a world in collapse where humanity is\nreduced to a single person who then proceeds to eliminate, to the best\nof their abilities, “every living thing, animal or plant (but\npainlessly if you like, as at the best abattoirs).” (1973, 16)\nWith the demise of the last man (which we may suppose occurs\nimmediately prior to the wholesale destruction unleashed), there are\nno humans—either others or the last man himself—who could\nbe harmed by such an act and so, with clauses (1) and (2) satisfied,\nthe act is permissible according to the “human chauvinist”\nWestern ethical systems. (And even if “others” were\nextended to include non-human sentient creatures, still no harm,\nunderstood as suffering, would accrue given the act is done\n“painlessly”.) Yet, “what he does is wrong”\nand therewith we have a counterexample to such chauvinism and\nassociated Western ethical systems, and a claimed need for a new\nethic, “an environmental ethic”, capable of accounting for\nthe wrongness of the last man’s act. (As in his logical work,\nSylvan’s strategy is to try to isolate what is sufficient (in\nthis case, for wrongness) by considering “distant”\npossible worlds.) \n\nGranting the wrongness of the last man’s act, is a “new\nethic” really required? Preference utilitarianism has been\nconsidered as a “traditional” ethic capable of condemning\nthe last man. (Cf. Elliot 1980, 20 and 23; and Carter 2004,\n51–52 for a more limited condemnation along preference\nutilitarian grounds.) Where there is an overwhelming preference for\npreservation of the world beyond the death of the last man, and its\ndestruction would thus harm those having such a preference, the\nFreedom Principle would already appear to prohibit such an act\n(assuming the aggregated harm outweighs any benefit in the\nsatisfaction of contrary preferences). But notice that condemnation,\non this view, is highly contingent, depending on people’s\npreferences (condemnation is justified only if preferences\nconflict with destruction). Since the condemnation is thought to be\nwarranted with “no ifs and buts”, yet this\n“traditional” response offers the correct judgement only\nin special circumstances, for Sylvan, it counts as “too\nparochial” (Routley 1973, 20). (Cf. Lamb 2018, 532–3 for a\nsimilar point.) \n\nReacting, in part, to Leopold’s call for a “land\nethic”, Sylvan’s subsequent work in the area (much of the\nearly work with Val Routley, later Val Plumwood) proceeds to describe\nand argue for just such a non-anthropocentric, environmental ethic. A\ndominant aspect of this “new” ethic (indeed, a\ncharacterising feature in Elliot 1980) that was fixed on by\nsubsequent authors was the extension of non-instrumental,\n“intrinsic” or “final” values to the non-human\nworld. First mentioned in 1974 in early drafts of Routley and Routley\n(1980a) and subsequently Val Routley (1975), Rolston (1975), and\nCallicott (1979)—who all employ versions of the Last Man\nExample—the extension is described and defended at length in\nRoutley and Routley (1980a). (Sylvan assumes intrinsic value is, in\ngeneral, already assured on the familiar Aristotelian ground that\ninstrumental value requires intrinsic value, lest vicious regress\nensue—cf. Aristotle Metaphysics, 994b9–15.) \n\nSylvan and Plumwood hypothesise that what underpins the deontic\nprohibition of the last man’s act is the truth of the\naxiological claim that entities in non-human nature can possess more\nthan mere instrumental value—non-human nature “can have\nvalue and create obligations not reducible (in any way) to human\ninterests” (1980a, 129). While such items may have instrumental\nvalue, value as a means to human ends, advantaging us in various\nways—e.g., the value of forests in supplying water for human\nconsumption—they might also have “non-instrumental”,\nor what the Routleys called “intrinsic” value (1980a, 126\nand 129). Thus, the rejection of human chauvinism in its deontological\nform (the assertion of and the argument to the falsity of the Freedom\nPrinciple) was accompanied by its rejection in axiological form: not\nonly humans have intrinsic value; non-human nature may also be the\nlocus of intrinsic (non-instrumental) value. \n\nWhile accepting that we may have moral obligations with respect to or\nregarding entities in the non-human world, Routley (1973, 19) and\nRoutley and Routley (1980a, 174ff) deny that this entails our having\nobligations to them and deny, too, their having correlative\nrights. Sylvan rejects such an extension of rights to non-human\nentities. For this reason, he takes the “new environmental\nethic” to “differ markedly” from alternatives like\nLeopold’s land ethic. As it developed, it also differed markedly\nfrom most forms of utilitarianism for a broad range of reasons,\narguing instead for a deontologically constrained “optimisation\napproach to value theory”. (See Routley and Routley 1985; Sylvan\n1992.) Variants of Last Man counterexamples to traditional Western\nethics are also taken to show that the distribution of intrinsic value\nextends beyond sentient individuals—contra “animal\nliberationists” (1980a, 125) like Singer—so that\n“candidates for value … include all objects”\n(1980a, 140). \n\nResisting Sylvan’s broad push for a non-anthropocentric,\nenvironmental ethic are several arguments suggesting the inevitability\nof human chauvinism. Foremost among them are arguments that, he\nclaims, “parallel” arguments for egoism. Their rejection\nfollows similar grounds for rejection of egoism—cf. Routley and\nRoutley (1979b, esp. 47). This paper also distinguishes strong forms\nof human chauvinism (endorsing what Sylvan later termed the sole value\nassumption: that only members of the human class and some of\ntheir possible states have intrinsic value) from weaker forms that\nmerely endorse, for example, “the Greater Value Thesis: the\ninvariable allocation of greater value or preference … to\nhumans, while not however entirely excluding non-humans from moral\nconsideration” (ibid., 36)—a thesis also rejected\nby Sylvan. Paske (1991) defends a qualified version of the thesis; the\nmoral differentiation in favour of most humans can be\njustified (by appeal to deontologically-constrained hedonic\nconsequentialism). Attfield (1981), considering versions of the Last\nMan Example, also rejects strong human chauvinism while defending the\ngreater value thesis, thus defending a weak chauvinism in\nSylvan’s sense. “The good of trees might outweigh some of\nour whims: but it does not outweigh our interests except where our\ninterests depend on it” (1981, 51). \n\nPetersen and Sandin, on the other hand, defend a strong form of human\nchauvinism, arguing that the Last Man Example is subject to varying\nresponses depending on the motives attending the act of\nelimination. They thus reject the hypothesis of intrinsic values in\nnature, arguing instead that any supposed wrongness “can be\nbetter explained by precepts about last man’s character traits\nand motives” (2013, 133). It remains open whether such a\nresponse is adequate for the Last People Example (described by Sylvan\nimmediately following the Last Man Example) who may be said to act\n“for the best of reasons” though they have acted\n“badly” (Routley 1973, 16–17). \n\nA number of arguments against Sylvan’s hypothesised intrinsic\nvalue of natural items focus on supposed problems that attend the\napparently “cosmic” account of value that items are said\nto have in the absence of valuers (e.g., after the demise of the last\nman). Some focus on problems traditionally associated with moral\nobjectivism. If value is conceptually independent of valuers then:\nmoral intuitionism is an unacceptable consequence (cf. Mannison 1980,\n57, the charge of “realism”); moral theory is inconsistent\nwith (the preferred theory) moral projectivism (Carter 2004, who\nclaims a projectivist theory can explain our intuitions concerning the\nlast man); or such value is simply beyond epistemic access and\nirrelevant for decision-making (Justus et al. 2009,\n187–8). The latter point echoes earlier claims in Thompson\n(1990), Grey (1993), and Fox (1995) that the hypothesis of intrinsic\nvalue in nature results in values that, being too far removed from\nhuman concerns, are irrelevant as an ethical guide to human action\n(Thompson 1990, 159–60; Grey 1993, 464) and, in any event, are\nunnecessary—an enlightened anthropocentrism is sufficient. \n\nSylvan’s position on the ontology of values (discussed at length\nin 1980a, esp. 152ff) draws on the Last Man Example to claim that\nthings can, indeed, be valuable at a time when no valuers exist and\nextended thought experiments of a similar kind he takes to further\nestablish that things can be valuable in a world wherein no valuer\nexists at all, though a valuer must exist in some world (1980a, 156,\nfn 67; cf. also Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 143). Values are, he claims,\nconceptually dependent on valuers—thus the slogan “no\nvalue without valuers” remains true, he contends—and\ntherewith the rock of objectivism is said to be avoided (1980a,\n154). Elliot (1980) also contends that a non-objectivist account is\nsufficient for this kind of value engendered by the last man example,\nthough it is one requiring actual evaluators (“no\nvalues without actual valuers”). He goes on to describe\na subjectivist account that further links values to valuers\nin a manner that “makes the valuer the sole determinant of a\nthing’s value” (1980, 19) with value reduced to valuer\nevaluations. \n\nTaking himself to have avoided objectivism, Sylvan nonetheless argues\nagainst subjectivist accounts—intrinsic values are not\nsubjective either (1980a, 154). Intrinsic value in a world,\nwhile depending conceptually on valuers, nonetheless does not reduce\nto valuers in that world in any way. Some have remarked on\nthe apparent similarities between Sylvan’s account of intrinsic\nvalue and secondary qualities, suggesting his account amounted to a\nresponse-dependent account of intrinsic value (cf. Grey 2000). See\nLamb (2018, §IX) for argument to the contrary. \n\nIn the further elaboration of the “new ethic”, Routley and\nRoutley (1980a) develops a multiple factor model combining traditional\nvalues, such as the virtues and creature enjoyment, with environmental\nvalue-making factors, for example: diversity of systems and creatures,\nnaturalness, integrity of systems, stability of systems, and harmony\nof systems (170–171). So the shift to an environmental ethic\ndoes not reject ordinarily acknowledged welfare values for persons or\nhumans, but simply recognises a further set of factors contributing to\nintrinsic value in nature (171). Such value-making factors enter into\na mutually constrained optimisation so that the increase of one need\nnot increase the overall intrinsic value of the entity exemplifying\nit; thus, an increase in diversity in a forest may decrease value\ninsofar as it may come at the cost of naturalness (e.g., if the added\ndiversity comes from the anthropogenic addition of feral species not\nnaturally occurring in that forest). \n\nThe account of value is non-naturalistic in the sense that value is\nargued to be irreducible to natural features, even though\n“grounded” in them. (1980a, §5; Sylvan later\ncommitted to the supervenience of intrinsic value on naturalistic\nfeatures, Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 143). It is Meinongian in a number\nof respects—most obviously, drawing freely on Routley (1980),\ncf. esp. §8.11, values are features had by items but, like\nproperties, they do not exist (1980a, 153ff). Sylvan’s moral\nepistemology also draws heavily on Meinong’s account of\n“emotional presentation” (see Lamb 2018, §VIII):\n“the valued object may be emotionally presented and its\nvalue thus recognised, without its value simply amounting to\nits emotional presentation” (Routley and Routley 1983, 453). The\naccount is articulated at length in Sylvan (1986). Perhaps\nunsurprisingly, Sylvan’s semantic analysis of value (cf. Routley\nand Routley 1983) makes use of non-classical, relevant logic in its\nformal analysis. (Weber 2017a also draws on Sylvan’s work in\nnon-classical logic to develop a “new version” of the Last\nMan Example—the “Ultramodal Last Man”—with a\nview to avoiding an alleged dilemma besetting the original Last Man\nExample, “renewing a role for non-standard logics in value\ntheory”.) \n\nWhile Sylvan views the development of deep ecology sympathetically, he\ndistances himself from the positions being argued for under that\nbanner. His own “deep green ethics” is described most\nclearly in Sylvan and Bennett (1994, ch. 5). Like deep ecology, the\nposition is, using the term originally coined in Naess (1973),\n“deep” since it rejects the sole value assumption and\ngreater value thesis. But unlike deep ecology Sylvan rejects, in\nparticular: \n\narguing instead that some non-living things have intrinsic value and\nthat not all life is intrinsically valuable; and \n\narguing instead for eco-impartiality, thus not valuing members of one\nspecies over those of another simply on the basis of species\nmembership, and noting that evaluative impartiality with respect to\nspecies does not entail their equal value. More generally, Sylvan\n(1985) argues that under the strong West Coast US influence deep\necology commits to an assortment of dubious metaphysical and\npsychological themes—often leading to an anthropocentric\n“person- and consciousness-oriented soufflé”. And\nlinks to religion, in particular pantheism and nature mysticism,\nthreaten to “convert deep ecology into a new religion”.\nWhat results is a “deep ecology” that is\n“conceptually murky” and subject to\n“degeneration”. As noted in Section 1, laying out these\npoints of difference with deep ecologists in uncompromising style\nearned him the title ‘the bad boy of deep ecology’ (Orton\n2005, Other Internet Resources). For responses, see Fox (1986) and\nAttfield (1993). \n\nHis deep green theory is, following his metaphysical and logical\npluralism (cf. Sylvan 2000b), also pluralistic “allow[ing] for\nthe requisite theory dependence and cultural relativity of\nvalues” (1980a, 156), “there is no uniquely determined\ncorrect value system … there are various overlapping\nsystems” though he denies that ethical relativism follows from\nthis (Sylvan 1986, 13). He sees the ongoing cultural project of\ndeveloping an adequate environmental ethic as being in its early\nstages. \n\nGrey (2000) contends that the (proto)theory faces numerous problems;\nfor further analysis as to whether Sylvan’s position has been\nproperly targeted see Lamb (2018, 565–80 passim). \n\nNot content with mere theory, as noted in section 1, Sylvan also\nengaged in ambitious practical conservation work, acquiring high-value\nconservation properties for rehabilitation and protection. But the\nvalue of such rehabilitated landscapes is contested in Elliot (1982)\nand Katz (1992). Defending the idea that naturalness of origin is a\nvaluable aspect of wild nature, they argue that not only is restored\nnature of lesser value than any wilderness that it replaces, but the\nrestored copy could be described as “a fake or a forgery”\n(Elliot 1982, 84); restoration involves a “big lie” as\nKatz puts it. Sylvan thinks they have grossly overstated their case\nand responds in Sylvan (1994)—restored landscapes are not mere\nartifact or fakery. They are not contrived gardens devoid of natural\nvalues, artificial nature falsely presented as the real thing. \n\nConsider an area of restored bushland … The restoration results\nprimarily by nature doing its own thing; it is nothing like furniture\nor pottery making. An ecological restorer, unlike an artisan, does not\nproduce the item, there is no making … Rather there is\nadjustment at margins … and there is helping in\nhealing (Sylvan 1994, 68). \n\nSylvan argues that Elliot and Katz have illicitly extended the notion\nof an artifact, which is widely and wrongfully deployed in such\ndescriptions of restored natural areas and what they (especially Katz)\nhave failed to grasp is the value-enhancing role that restoration\nplays in the many situations where the damage has already been\ndone. Such restoration “is an addition, an attempt … to\nclaim back much more of what has [already] been grabbed and degraded\nor ruined” (Ibid., 75). In many cases restoration\nassists nature in reasserting itself and taking control once\nmore. What results lacks certain properties of the original, to be\nsure, especially natural continuity, but contributing to the\nrestoration of something to close-to-original value (as opposed to\nsome low-value fake) is, Sylvan argues, worthwhile and can result in\nnear-natural areas of enormous value. That is value enough. \n\nThough Sylvan is uneasy using the term ‘wilderness’\n“due to its long history of unfavourable associations and\nconnotation”, he agrees with the broader point being made by\nElliot and Katz—“ecological restoration is not an\nalternative to retaining wilderness, to remnant wildernesses”\n(Sylvan 1994, 75). However, they have overstated their case concerning\nthe value of restored landscapes. Elliot was persuaded, admitting that\nhe paid too little attention to the types of restoration that can be\nachieved and underestimated the value and degree of naturalness that\ncan result. In a book-length response to Sylvan and other critics and\nfellow travellers, Elliot (1997) clarifies his argument. Its Preface\nacknowledged the enormous debt to Sylvan. He is, Elliot came to think,\nquite right. “Mucking with nature” can result in something\nof significant value and it is, Elliot argued, in many cases\nobligatory to try to undo the damage we have done. \n\nA further practical issue which Sylvan sees as requiring theoretical\njustification is predation: the killing of animals for\nfood. “The vegetarian options face, it certainly seems,\ninsuperable difficulties, especially concerning such issues as animal\npredation (which is an important, immensely frequent, and\noften desirable, ecological fact), and concerning the\nreduction in numbers of animals, especially introduced animals, which\nbuild up to ‘pest proportions’ (some reduction is often\nrequired for vegetable growing to operate successfully)”\n(Routley 1982, 5). Sylvan himself, for example, culled feral rabbits\n(a damaging, introduced species in Australia) and he consumed the\nanimals killed. While his environmental ethic demands respect for\nintrinsically valuable non-humans, he argues that the \n\nrespect position is not a reverence position … interference is\nacceptable [in certain cases] … The lives, preferences,\nchoices, and considerations of other species or objects of moral\nconcern are not to be taken as sacred or inviolable [though we]\nrequire that good reasons be given for interfering with the\nenvironment (Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 149). \n\nSee Routley (1982, §4) for a defence (a paper which also presents\na moral defence of limited cannibalism). For a similar view see\nCallicott (1980) and for defence of the contrary claim that we ought,\nwhere possible, act to eliminate predation, even cases of wild animals\ntaking prey for food, see Nussbaum (2007, ch. 6). \n\nIn addition to work in environmental ethics, Sylvan wrote on other\nethical issues including arguments for moral obligations to future\ngenerations (cf. Routley and Routley 1978, Sylvan and Plumwood 1991),\nand the ethics of energy choice (Routley and Routley 1979c). The\nargument offered in the latter paper against nuclear power centres on\nthe (anthropocentric but nonetheless, in Sylvan’s view, salient)\nclaim that bequeathing toxic nuclear waste to future generations\nconstitutes an ethically unacceptable shift of costs onto others. And\na similar argument was mounted against conspicuous consumption of\nfossil fuels from what Sylvan and Plumwood then referred to as\n“atmosphere heating” (Routley and Routley 1979c, §3).\nTheirs appear to be amongst the earliest philosophical discussions\nfocussing on the ethics of climate change. And it is not just the\nclaimed immorality following from the consequences of climate change\nto future humans, though that is given weight; from a deep green\nperspective, the claimed erosion of value outstrips mere\nanthropocentric concerns and needs to take into account non-human\nnature, where the resultant erosion of intrinsic value is taken to\nloom large. \n\nConsidering destructive practices more generally, beyond those\ndestructive of the environment, Sylvan considered violence against\npersons, arguing that not only was nuclear war immoral, but that which\nconditionally promised it, nuclear deterrence, was also immoral (cf.\nRoutley 1984a). In fact, violence in general was, he argued, immoral,\ndefending pacifism and responding to the standard objections to it in\nRoutley (1984b). \n\nIn formal ethics, Sylvan defended a non-classical deontic logic.\nRoutley and Plumwood (1989) argued that the existence of moral\ndilemmas establishes the need both for: (i) a non-classical\npropositional logic underpinning deontic logic; and (ii) the rejection\nof some other central principles of orthodox deontic logic, especially\nthe principle of deontic consistency \n\nand the Kantian principle ought-implies-can (since dilemmas create\nimpossible obligations). He argues that the sentential fragment of\ndeontic logic must be paraconsistent and a relevant logic is\nrecommended (see Section 2). \n\nSylvan saw his ethics as systematically connected with issues in\nsocial and political philosophy, extending out from “deep green\nethics” to a broader “deep green theory” that\n“includes a radical social and political theory, centred upon\nsocial anarchistic forms of organization … and elements of\nradical economic theory … There have to be changes in\nsocial and political arrangements … towards less consumptive,\npopulous and wasteful societies, and so on” (Sylvan and Bennett\n1994, 151). \n\nSome of these ideas are discussed at length in Routley and Routley\n(1980b) where alternative forms of economic and political organisation\nare first considered from an environmental perspective. Sylvan focuses\nhis attention on what he takes to be an evident failure of the\npolitical arrangements proposed in the West. According to him, the\ngreat limitations to the freedom of human beings, the uneven\ndistribution of wealth and, above all, the constant damages caused to\nthe environment are all symptoms of a disease that must be treated.\nSylvan argues for what he calls pluralist anarchism, (a form\nof socialist anarchism) abandoning any form of government, including\nthe minimal one defended by Robert Nozick (2013). \n\nSylvan’s work in moral theory helped pioneer the rise of\nenvironmental philosophy as a new sub-discipline and connected\nenvironmental issues with broader moral issues as well as issues in\npolitical and social philosophy. Drawing on other work in metaphysics\nand logic, he sought new non-anthropocentric moral foundations,\nheavily critical of both traditional ethics and emerging alternatives\nthat lacked clarity and rigour. \n\nThe overall picture that emerges from Sylvan’s work is of a\nbroad philosophy that draws on non-classical (relevant) logic, a\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and a neo-Meinongian value theory as a\nmeans of accounting for “common-sense” ways of talking\n(e.g., about things that do not exist), ways of valuing (e.g., the\nseeming intrinsic value of things in the natural world) and\nsocio-political arrangements (e.g., a pluralist\nanarchism). Sylvan’s work was radical, but rigorous; a rich\nmany-worlds semantics underpins formal analyses. His work was\ncontentious; many traditional philosophical “problems” are\nclaimed to be artefacts of faulty orthodox theories. And his work was\nexpansive; philosophy’s traditional role with the question\n“How are we to live?” is taken seriously. Above all,\nSylvan’s thought was unified and systematic: “What is\nsought is a theory of values which blends both with object-theory and\nwith deeper environmental theory…” (1986, 1). \n\nSylvan’s program was left unfinished when he died. Whatever one\nthinks of his bold statements (“a wild mixture of wonderfully\nincisive ideas and absolutely false claims,” as Meyer put it in\n1996), Sylvan pushes philosophers to recognize that many propositions\ntaken as facts are not unrestrictedly true, but rather are\nrelative to what assumptions one is making about logic,\nontology, and value. Changing those assumptions changes the\npossibilities. And Sylvan’s work urges us to be ready for more\npossibilities—even what is, as he put it, “beyond the\npossible” (this is the title of an unpublished manuscript cited\nin Routley 1980).","contact.mail":"filippo.g.e.casati@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2019-12-09","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sylvan-routley/","author1":"Dominic Hyde","author2":"Filippo Casati","author1.info":"https://hpi.uq.edu.au/profile/388/dominic-hyde","author2.info":"https://sites.google.com/site/doctorzachweber/home","entry":"sylvan-routley","body.text":"\n\n\n\nRichard Sylvan (born Routley, 1935–1996) was an Australasian\nphilosopher who was instrumental in starting major schools in: logic\n(especially paraconsistent and relevant logic), metaphysics\n(especially Meinongian ontology), and ethics (especially environmental\nethics). In a large body of writing, Sylvan urged that, from logic to\necology, we are not now thinking well about big problems—but\nthat we can and must do better. “Philosophers fiddle while the\nworld begins to burn,” he wrote (Hyde 2014, vi). In response, he\nproposed a highly ambitious and radical philosophical project of\nre-evaluation, from foundations up, that has had ongoing impact in\nphilosophy (Casati, Mortensen & Priest 2018; Eckert (ed.) 2018;\nHyde (ed.) 2019, and Weber (ed.) 2019).\n\n\n\nSylvan is known for proposing and defending some highly controversial\nviews, arguing in favour of inconsistent theories, non-existent\nobjects, and non-human values. Such unorthodox claims were especially\nunpopular in the time Sylvan was writing, in the latter half of the\n20th century. But he thought it was vitally important, for\nphilosophy and for the world, that we take seriously ideas that run\nagainst conventions of the time. (As Robert Meyer put it, “To\nget the counter-suggestible Sylvan to defend some view, one needed\nfirst to remark that the view was now utterly discredited”,\nMeyer 1996.) What were widely thought to be untenable positions, such\nas Meinongianism, or failed theories, such as Cantor/Frege naïve\nset theory, attracted Sylvan’s attention for what he thought of\nas restoration:\n\n\nA large part of my philosophical life has, so it appears, looking back\n(and also looking forward) consisted in rehabilitating abandoned\nphilosophical dwellings, habitats, and landscapes. (Preface, Sylvan\nms. Philosophical Rehabilitation, quoted in Hyde 2014,\n124)\n\n\n\n\nHis contributions are all systematically tied together in the\nservice of a single project, around meaning and value, recognizing the\nlegitimacy and status of marginalized entities; for the landscapes he\nsought to rehabilitate had been, in his view,\n\n\n\nlaid waste or damaged by predecessors—too many of them, as\nthe predecessors adhered to an entirely defective set of\nvalues…(ibid.).\n\n\n\nHe sought to make these philosophical landscapes viable by improving\nthe way we reason about them, thereby casting them in a new light that\nshowed their deep interconnectedness.\n\n\n\nThis entry will use the name ‘Sylvan’, even though he\ndid not begin using that name until 1983. All his work published before\nthen uses his original name of ‘Routley’.\n\n\nSylvan was born in 1935 in Levin, New Zealand. He received his MA in\nPhilosophy from the University of New Zealand (Wellington) in 1957 and\nthe following year completed a first-class Honours degree in\nmathematics there. His MA thesis, a 385-page work entitled Moral\nScepticism was given a mark of 95% by Arthur Prior, though he\nlater commented that this was “not so much a mark as an\nexclamation mark” (quoted in D. Hyde, Introduction to Eckert\n(ed.) 2018, xiv). Blackwell agreed to publish a condensed version\nof the thesis but the required revisions were never undertaken. \n\nIn 1959, his teacher George Hughes then employed Sylvan to build a\nsmall electro-mechanical computer capable of determining whether input\nformulae were logical truths, logical falsehoods, or\nneither—with green, red and amber lights displaying the\nrespective outcomes. He worked out how to build it from scratch using\nrelays and uniselectors discarded by the post office and it was a\nsuccess, but when run some years later it drew so much power that it\nblacked out the building it was housed in, ruining several experiments\nin biology running in the building at the time. The Biology Department\ninsisted that it never be used again (Hyde 2014, 43). \n\nIn mid-1959, while bushwalking in Australia, he met Jack Smart (then\nin Adelaide, later a colleague at the Australian National University\nand good bushwalking friend thereafter) who encouraged him to go to\nPrinceton for graduate work, as opposed to the then more usual choice\nof UK universities like Cambridge. At Smart’s urging, “as\na brash young man” Sylvan travelled to Princeton with a\nFulbright scholarship for doctoral studies under Alonzo Church to\n“repair and renovate a derelict philosophy of science”\n(Sylvan 2000a, 7). After two and a half years he was awarded an MA\nfrom Princeton University but left before completing his PhD,\ndissatisfied with the intellectual climate there and subsequent lack\nof progress on his project. (He later received a PhD from Princeton in\n1980 for chapter one of Routley 1980.) He accepted a lectureship at\nSydney University in 1962 where he began lecturing undergraduates in\nlogic—introducing modern Russellian theory, displacing John\nAnderson’s long insistence on Aristotelian theory. There he met\nVal Plumwood (then Val Macrae, later Val Routley) and, in 1964, they\nmoved to the University of New England where Sylvan joined Len Goddard\nand a growing department—the first to have begun teaching modern\nlogic in Australia under Goddard in 1957. Goddard and Sylvan founded\nthe first Australian Masters program in logic and formed\nthe Australasian Association of Logic, and with Len Goddard,\nDavid Londey, Ross Brady, Malcolm Rennie and Val Plumwood, he\ndeveloped what became known as the New England Group—working on\nnon-classical logic and paradoxes, among other things—but\nGoddard left a few years later, returning to St Andrews in\nScotland. In 1967, with a year’s sabbatical owing, Sylvan and\nPlumwood married (with Plumwood taking the name Routley) and they\ndrove from the University to St Andrews to continue work with Goddard\n(traversing northern Australia, shipping the car from Darwin to\nSingapore, then overland into India and Pakistan, through the Middle\nEast and Eastern Europe). Upon return, in 1968, Sylvan took a\nposition at Monash University before being appointed to a Senior\nFellowship in Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences at\nthe Australian National University (ANU) in 1971, where he remained\nfor the rest of his career. With only postgraduate students to\nsupervise, his days teaching undergraduates was at an end. A number of\nresearchers from the New England Group subsequently joined him there\nand, with the addition of Bob Meyer, Graham Priest, and others, a\ngroup re-formed around Sylvan at the ANU—the well-known Canberra\nLogic Group that went on to pioneering research in non-classical,\nespecially relevant, logic. Through his contribution to the formation\nof research groups that were both innovative and productive, Sylvan\ninfluenced a whole generation of Australian philosophers and\nlogicians. (For more on this history of modern logic in Australia,\ncf. Routley 1984c, Goddard 1992, and Brady and Mortensen 2014.) \n\nThe natural world also fascinated Sylvan. By the time of his death\nhe had purchased, and worked to conserve, five large tracts of rich\nforest areas—four of which were subsequently bequeathed\nfor conservation.  He took such a delight in nature, not so much the\ndelight that a romantic might take in the overall beauty of it all,\nbut a delight in its richness and complexity, in the detail that he\nfound in the structure of mosses and in the behaviour of\ninsects. … It’s as if in a strange way he was part of it\n….  (quoted in D. Hyde, Introduction to Eckert (ed.)\n2018, xxv). \n\nWithin a year of arriving at the ANU (the centre of Australian\nforestry policy development), he and Plumwood became aware of plans\nfor extensive clearing of “useless” native forest for pine\nplantations across the country and so began work on a sustained\ncritique of Australian forestry practices (Routley and Routley 1973a)\nalongside joint work rethinking issues in environmental\nphilosophy. The critical and “pugilistic” style of the\nbook caused an uproar in forestry—with an attempt to suppress\nits publication (cf. Routley and Plumwood 1986). The repressive nature\nof the Australian forestry industry was widely understood from within,\nwith one forestry insider commenting, on receipt of a letter from\nSylvan early in the project, that: “for an Australian forester,\nreceiving a letter from you is somewhat akin to a new Party member\ngetting a birthday card from Alexander Solzhenitsyn” (Sylvan\nRSC, Box #45). Closer to home, they were also criticised by some\ncolleagues who, in the days before applied philosophy had come of age,\nsaw their work as “propaganda” rather than scholarly\nresearch. Despite resistance though, the book’s successful\npublication helped reform forestry in Australia, being subsequently\ndescribed by a leading forestry expert as “monumentally\nimportant” and “the most incisive and devastating economic\nanalysis of forestry … ever done in Australia” (Byron\n1999, 53). All three editions published through the ANU Press between\n1973 and 1975 sold out but by 1975 Sylvan was, remarkably, banned from\nusing the ANU’s Forestry Department Library (the central store\nfor documents relating to the development of national forestry policy)\nand further, planned editions were effectively stopped. \n\nIn 1975, Sylvan and Plumwood realised their dream of moving “off\ngrid” into the temperate rainforest in the coastal ranges east\nof Canberra where they began building a house from local stone (one of\nfive houses that Sylvan built over his life). Working first from a\ntent, then a shed, over the subsequent five years it took to build the\nhouse they produced much of their key work on relevant logic,\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and environmental philosophy—often\ndiscussing philosophy while building with graduate students and guests\nwho could be roped in to help. After a productive twenty-year\npartnership, Sylvan and Plumwood parted ways in 1983, and he married\nLouise Sylvan (née Merlin). That was also the year he changed\nhis name from ‘Richard Routley’ to ‘Richard\nSylvan’ while Val Routley, as she was then known, became Val\nPlumwood. Sylvan and Plumwood continued to work and correspond on\nclosely related themes in environmental philosophy until\nSylvan’s death in 1996. \n\nWhile his students and research assistants found him supportive and\nkind, Sylvan’s style sometimes offended his peers. He could be\nvery blunt in his assessment of other’s arguments and his shy\ndemeanour and lack of small talk did little to counteract feelings of\nrude-dismissal—friend and colleague Bob Meyer commenting that he\n“was a difficult man; not only did he fail to suffer fools\ngladly, but he often disdained suffering them at all” (Meyer\n1996). Sylvan himself also commented, for example, that his\n“Critique of Deep Ecology” (Sylvan 1985) would “risk\noffending many friends in the deeper ecology movement” (i) and,\nwhile he remained good friends with chief target Arne Naess, some\nwere, no doubt, offended. It earned him the title ‘the bad boy\nof deep ecology’ (Orton 2005, Other Internet\nResources)—still considered a “deep ecologist”\ndespite the substance of his criticism concluding in his rejecting\ndeep ecology in favour of what he termed “deep green\ntheory”. Some who took offense on reading his response to their\nwork would later go on to befriend and work with Sylvan, having gotten\npast his blunt exterior. But with opposing-authority there was rarely\nany rapprochement; his anti-authoritarianism was deep-rooted and his\nanarchist tendencies manifest—in both academic work and in his\nbehaviour. \n\nHis publishing habits also drew attention. Seeking an outlet for\nlonger papers and essays in the late 1970s, and wary of\n“profiteering” publishers, in the do-it-yourself spirit\nthat infused much of Sylvan’s life he began publishing a number\nof pre-print series in the Research School of Social Sciences where he\nworked at the ANU. Beginning with work of the Canberra Logic Group,\nthe “Yellow Series” (as it became known) included over\ntwenty publications by Group members between 1978 and 1985. There\nfollowed other Series including work in logic, metaphysics, the\nphilosophy of science and much of his own work in environmental\nphilosophy. In total, there were over fifty such publications of which\nover half were Sylvan’s own work. The publications ranged from\ntens of pages to hundreds and could be purchased by post from the\ndepartment for a few dollars. The largest, at just over one thousand\npages (Exploring Meinong’s Jungle and Beyond), for\nexample, was available in hardback for $10. Such anomalous publishing\nhabits meant that a considerable amount of his work is now very hard\nto access (though, in some cases, republication through more usual\nchannels is underway—e.g., Eckert (ed.) 2018; Hyde (ed.) 2019;\nand Weber (ed.) 2019). \n\nHe died in June 1996 aged 60, while entering a sacred temple in Bali\nto discuss Hindu philosophy with priests there. (For more details, see\nHyde 2014.) \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work in logic. As in other\nareas of his philosophy, Sylvan was notable for his staunch defence of\nhighly controversial and radical views—most strikingly, that\nclassical logic is wrong, that non-classical logic is right, and that\nsome contradictions may be true (see: dialetheism). What makes\nhis work worth remembering is that he backed up such claims with\nrigorous (if contentious) arguments and mathematical details. \n\nSylvan’s work in logic can be viewed in part as a response to\na wide range of paradoxes, such as the paradoxes of\nself-reference (like the Liar Paradox). He was equally focused on\nparadoxes of implication, and so was a leading developer of\nrelevant logics, logics characterized by their concern that\nthere be a meaningful connection between the antecedent and consequent\nof a conditional. These topics would lead him to be one of the founders\nof the so-called “Australasian school” of\nparaconsistent logic, logics that tolerate inconsistency\nwithout incoherence. He was perennially concerned with the\nuniversality of logic. Along with intrinsic interest, his\nlogical research was always motivated by its eventual application to\nissues in metaphysics, ethics, and beyond. \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work in neutral quantification\ntheory and significance logics. In both cases, he is concerned with\ngranting legitimacy to otherwise discredited or rejected\nentities—the existence (or lack thereof) of objects that seem\nlike perfectly good subjects of quantification in apparently true\nsentences; and the status of “nonsensical” sentences that\nseem like they are essential parts of good reasoning. \n\nFrom his earliest days at Princeton, Sylvan had argued that an\nadequate philosophy of science required quantification over\nnon-existent objects (numbers, frictionless planes, etc.), and an\nadequate semantics for fictional discourse was also best pursued along\nthese lines. (Cf. Routley 1965, 1966a, 1979a; Routley and Routley\n1973b, 1979a.) For reasons discussed in Section 3\nbelow, he followed Meinong in seeking a theory that includes\nnon-existent objects, and a logic that can handle such objects. \n\nA basic idea here (e.g., in Routley 1980) is to reassess the status of\nthe existential quantifier: \\(\\exists\\). It is commonplace\namongst logicians, especially since Russell 1905 and especially\nQuine’s article “On What There Is”, to read this\nas ontologically loaded; so if \\(\\exists x Ax\\) is true then\nsome \\(x\\) exists and has property \\(A\\). Sylvan urges that we\ndistinguish between particular claims (‘some \\(x\\) is\n\\(A\\)’) and existential claims\n(‘an existing \\(x\\) is \\(A\\)’). With the latter\nexistential reading, it is impossible to claim that some things just\ndo not exist; that amounts to saying something both exists and does\nnot exist, so it exists after all. But with the former\nparticular reading, the claim ‘some things do not\nexist’ comes out as intended, with its apparent natural language\nmeaning. Because the existential interpretation of the backward\n‘E’ symbol has become hopelessly entrenched, Sylvan\nintroduced new symbols, ‘P’ (for particular) and its dual\n‘U’ (universal), to act as neutral quantifiers.\nThus the logical ground was laid for subsequent work in neo-Meinongian\nmetaphysics (cf. Section 3). \n\nThis work, both the metaphysics and logic, led to a number of debates\nwith David Lewis. Lewis (1990) argues that the apparently deep\ndisagreement Sylvan has with ontologically loaded quantification might\nbe dispelled by a translation manual, between his unconventional\nMeinongian reading and a conventional one (cf. Priest 2005, Section\n7.9.): \n\nIf this is right, then it appears Sylvan is in danger of doing\nlittle more than quibbling about the use of the word\n‘exists’ when it comes to abstract objects. But Lewis is\nself-critically aware that any misunderstanding may be mutual, and\ncautions that \n\nTo suppose that [Sylvan] mistakes mere terminological difference for\nprofound philosophical disagreement is to accuse him of stupidity far\nbeyond belief (Lewis 1990, 30). \n\nWorry about communication difficulties between classical and\nnon-classical logicians would be voiced by Lewis again, eventually\ndeclining to debate at all (Lewis 1999, and cf. Smart 1977). \n\nWith the formation of the New England Logic Group, we find the first\ninstances of Sylvan pursuing the development of non-classical\nlogics as a response to a range of paradoxes. A preliminary\naspect to this work was the investigation of the fundamental notion of\nsignificance. \n\nEspecially in early 20th century philosophy, a popular\nmeans of dismissing various philosophical theses (say in metaphysics)\nwas “on the grounds that they are nonsense, nonsignificant,\nabsurd, meaningless, unintelligible, or logically odd” (Goddard\nand Routley 1973, 1). Such rejections are characteristic of logical\npositivism, taking a cue from Wittgenstein’s accusation that much\nof philosophy is “not false, but senseless\n[unsinnig]” [Tractatus 4.003] and therefore\neasy to ignore. By the late 1960s, it seemed to Routley and Goddard\nthat Russell and others had succeeded in promoting a\n“meaninglessness” solution to various paradoxes like the Liar\nsentence, or the Russell contradiction, \n\nthe set \\(R\\) of all sets that are not members of themselves is a\nmember of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself \n\nAccording to various Russell/Tarski type theories, sentences are\nregimented to levels of a hierarchy and restricted in scope about what\nthey can express; then liar-type sentences are, on this sort of\nsolution, “nonsense”. Appeal to non-significance is then\nmeant to avoid paradox. Goddard and Routley are concerned that\nphilosophers have been too eager to condemn theses that “are\nneither gibberish nor ungrammatical” (4). \n\nIn response, Routley (1966b), Brady and Routley (1973), and Goddard\nand Routley (1973) argue for a logic of significance for the formal\nstudy of significance. The ideas here can be summed up in three theses.\nFirst, there are grammatically correct natural language\nsentences, containing only recognized vocabulary (say of English),\nwhich “are held to be meaningless” (Goddard and Routley\n1973, 2); but “unlike seriously ungrammatical sentences,\n[they] can figure in valid arguments and can occur as unquoted\ncomponents of grammatical sentences” (Routley 1969, 367).\nSecond, such sentences require a non-classical and\nspecifically three-valued logic. Meaningless sentences still\nmust have some recognized status—and it is some status\nother than ‘true’ or ‘false’ (See Haack 1971,\n1975, and Bradley 1978 for alternatives). As Brady and Sylvan put\nit, \n\nWe believe that the deep structure of natural languages, and hence of\nthe languages in which philosophical problems are characteristically\nformulated, will have to be based on an enriched significance logic\nwhich has a third value—nonsense or nonsignificance—and\nnot on a classical two-valued logic which only has truth and falsity\nas its values (Brady and Routley 1973, 211). \n\nThird, all significance logics will need to be based on a\ncommon context logic, where a fixed context of use or\ncircumstance determines the ‘significance principles’ of\neach logic (Cocchiarella 1984; cf. Ripley 2012, 101). \n\nSylvan and Goddard want a logic that can track (as opposed to simply\ndeny) non-significant sentences, which we may think of as\ntruth-value gaps. Their proposed logic of significance may be\nunderstood (see Szmuc and Omori 2018) as being based on a three-valued\nlogic, weak Kleene, given by the following truth tables: \n\nThe intermediate value, \\(n\\) (for ‘nonsense’), is to\nbe read as, not a truth-value, but rather as a kind of\nmeaninglessness. These matrices respect two basic conditions laid down\nin (Goddard and Routley 1973, 260), that \n\nAn argument is valid on this logic iff there is no\nevaluation that interprets all the premises as true (value \\(t\\))\nbut the conclusion untrue (values \\(f\\) and \\(n\\)). This\nlogic was further investigated by Brady (1980) and Bunder (1979, 1980a,\n1980b). For criticism, see Lambert (1968) and Haack (1971, 1975). \n\nThis early work is transitional. Paradoxical sentences at this stage\nof Sylvan’s thinking may have a value, but certainly not that of\n‘true’ (or ‘false’). This relatively\nconservative attitude would begin to fall away as his thinking\ndeveloped. \n\nThis section describes Sylvan’s work as part of the Canberra\nLogic Group’s pioneering research on relevant and paraconsistent\nlogics, and applications to naïve set theory. In the mid-1970s,\nRoutley/Sylvan produced a closely interconnected body of work (1975;\nRoutley and Meyer 1976, 1977, 1979; Routley et al. 1982),\nmuch of it in collaboration with Val Plumwood (then Routley), Meyer,\nBrady, and Priest (e.g., Priest and Routley 1983), circling around a\nfew key ideas, the germs of which we have already met: universality;\nimplication and entailment; and inconsistency. We now visit these in\nturn. \n\nIn 1975 Sylvan took up the idea of a universal semantics\ndirectly (although the title of his paper “Universal\nSemantics?” is in the uncertain form of a question). Inspired by\nrecent advances in Montague grammar and categorial languages, he\nbecame speculatively interested in whether there is some common form\nbeneath all natural languages, that could be adequately represented\nthough logical symbolism. Specifically, he was interested in some\n“leading assumptions” of the time, namely (1975, 327): \n\nHere we can see two recurring concerns in Sylvan’s logical\nwork: a sceptical interest in the idea of a model-theoretic reduction\n(to be lambasted most vociferously with Meyer in their paper\n“Extensional Reduction” of 1977), and the uses of worlds\nsemantics to do it. \n\nAs an initial gloss, a universal semantics, whatever else it\nmay be, is intended to be a framework able to express everything that\ncan be expressed. As in Section 2.1, there should not be any\nartificial constraints placed on what we might be able to reason well\nabout (or, by extension, think about or imagine), nonsense or not. And\na universal logic should not have, as theorems, anything that\nis patently incorrect. Putting these two ideas together, Sylvan was\nalready convinced that “classical logic” is too strong to\nserve as the basis for any universal semantics, because\nit cannot express everything that is expressible, such as\nmany intensional notions; and it does deliver apparently\nnonsensical theses such as the paradoxes of material implication (see\nSection 2.2.2 below). (These two aspects of a logic—the extent\nof the class of models it can describe, and the set of validities it\nyields—are inversely proportional; cf. Priest 2008,\n36–7.) \n\nOn these grounds, Sylvan looked increasingly at non-classical logics\nas a better framework or foundation for any universal semantics. His\n1977 manifesto “Ultralogic as universal?” introduces the\ntitular subject (note again the question mark) as follows: \n\nA universal logic, in the intended sense, is one which is applicable\nin every situation whether realised or not, possible or not. Thus a\nuniversal logic is like a universal key, which opens, if rightly\noperated, all locks. It provides a canon for reasoning in every\nsituation, including illogical, inconsistent and paradoxical ones. Few\nprevailing logics stand up to such a test. … [A] universal\nlogic should be adequate for mathematical and philosophical\npurposes—and also for logical functions in other areas such as\nbiology, economics, astrology, theology, and so on (893). \n\nApproaching any universal logic, according to Sylvan, would require\nextending the expressive power of classical logic, and concomitantly\nrestricting its proving power. \n\nTwo possible misinterpretations of this “universalist”\nproject should be flagged. First, Sylvan did not argue that some\nspecific alternative logic is the absolutely correct one, or even that\nthere should be one and only one correct alternative (see Section\n3.3). Second, although he can sound rhetorically partisan and\nideological, Sylvan’s approach was ultimately rather pragmatic:\nhe couched theory choice in practical cost/benefit analyses familiar\nfrom conventional philosophy of science (Routley 1980a). On the\nmeaning of ‘universality’ in this context see Mares (2019)\nand Nolan (2018). Brady’s 2006 book takes its title in part from\nSylvan’s announced project, with a focus on logics for\n“meaning containment”. \n\nFaced with the limitations of classical logic, Sylvan joined in the\nproject of refining C.I. Lewis’s strict implication to\novercome various paradoxes of the conditional. (See the encyclopedia\nentry on indicative conditionals.) For, according to the classical\naccount of material implication \\(\\supset\\), for any three random\ndeclarative sentences \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\) you find on the Internet, \\(\n(p \\supset q) \\lor (q \\supset r) \\) is valid (to take just one\nexample; see Routley et al. 1982, 6–7). One diagnosis\nof the problem here is that all these conditionals, of the form\n‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)’, display irrelevance: the\nantecedent \\(p\\) need not have anything “to do with” the\nconsequent \\(q\\), whereas correct natural language conditionals (so\nthe argument goes) always respect some kind of relevant\nconnection. The problem may be resolved by turning to an appropriate\nrelevant logic. \n\nSylvan is explicit, though, that his “main concern is not really\nrelevance at all—the appropriate sort of relevance is a\nby-product of any good implication relation, which comes out in the\nwash” (Routley et al. 1982, x) after a deeper diagnosis\nof the paradoxes. He emphasizes that what is really at issue for a\nsuccessful account of a conditional is absolute\nsufficiency—that when \\(p\\) really does imply \\(q\\), this\nmeans that \\(p\\) is all that is needed for \\(q\\). \n\nThe central deducibility relation of ultramodal logics, entailment, is\nintended to capture the notion of sufficiency … of the\nantecedent of an entailment on its own, without any additional\nimported truth, especially imported logical truths. …\nSufficiency is a go-anywhere notion, which is not limited by the fact\nthat the situation in which it operates is somehow classically\nincoherent, e.g., inconsistent or paradoxical. If \\(A\\) is sufficient\nfor \\(B\\) then it does not matter what else goes on; logical laws may\ngo haywire but nothing subtracts from \\(A\\)’s sufficiency (1977,\n896). \n\nSo while Sylvan’s contribution to relevant logic was seminal,\nhis concerns diverged from some other “relevantists”. In\nsome otherwise highly critical remarks, Burgess (1983, 45) writes that\n“Routleyanism and Andersonianobelnapianism are so dissimilar\nthat it is misleading to apply a single label\n‘relevantism’ to both. (And indeed, [Sylvan] sometimes\nadopts a different label.)” \n\nThe diagnosis of the paradoxes of implication as failures of respect\nfor sufficiency leads naturally to an alternative path to their\nresolution, of a piece with Sylvan’s concerns about\nuniversality. On this view, the paradoxes of implication are symptoms\nof taking\ntoo few possibilities into account. One may think of\nclassical material implication as taking only one situation\ninto account, giving rise to theorems like ‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\),\nor if \\(q\\) then \\(p\\)’, since either \\(p\\) is true (in which\ncase, \\(p\\) or \\(\\twiddle q\\) is true, and so q materially\nimplies \\(p\\)) or else \\(p\\) is false (in which case, \\(\\twiddle p\\)\nor \\(q\\) is true, and so \\(p\\) materially\nimplies \\(q\\)). This is immediately resolved upon consideration\nof two possibilities,\n\\(w_0\\) and \\(w_1\\), \n\nand thinking of ‘if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)’ as meaning\nthat in every world in which \\(p\\), also\n\\(q\\), i.e., \n\nThen ‘\\(p \\rightarrow q, \\mathrm{or}\\, q \\rightarrow p\\)’\nhas a counterexample, points at which p holds\nwithout q and vice versa, showing a failure of sufficiency\nexactly because more worlds are considered. \n\nThe key to solving the paradoxes and approaching universality, on\nthis approach, is to broaden the collection of worlds, in order to\nsieve out what sufficiency relations persist. Sylvan extends this\nstrategy to deal with other paradoxes of implication, such as the\nirrelevant \\( q \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow p) \\).\n\n \n\nSince \\(p\\) does imply \\(p\\), \\(p \\rightarrow p\\), i.e., at\nevery world in which \\(p\\), also \\(p\\), then to show that arbitrary\n\\(q\\) is not sufficient for this self-implication, there needs to be a\ncounterexample: one where \\(q\\) holds without \\(p \\rightarrow\np\\). Generally, to preserve sufficiency, the same strategy goes for\nany logical truth, \\(B\\): if we are to avoid \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) when\n\\(B\\) is logically necessary but irrelevant to \\(A\\), there must be\npoints at which even logical truths fail. For example, there\nwould be a world at which the law of non-contradiction \\(\\twiddle (A\n\\amp \\twiddle A)\\) fails. These points are known as non-normal or\nimpossible worlds, about which there is a growing literature (e.g.,\nNolan 2013; Berto and Jago 2019). \n\nThe logics being proposed here, then, are naturally\nparaconsistent: they do not validate the “spread”\nlaw: (\\(p \\amp \\twiddle p) \\rightarrow q\\), and so can putatively\nhandle inconsistency without collapse into triviality. (In\nSociative Logics, Sylvan refers to these as\npararelevant logics.) Indeed, with counterexamples to the law\nof non-contradiction, there would be worlds where some sentences\nare both true and false. \n\nThe first relevant logics were presented proof theoretically, in terms\nof axioms and closure under rules. The need for a model theoretic\ninterpretation (given in a classical metatheory) resulted in\nSylvan’s co-development with Plumwood of ternary relation\nsemantics for first degree entailment relevant logics (Routley and\nRoutley 1972) and the ensuing Routley-Meyer partnership that proved\nand extended a range of results for relevant logics (cf. Routley,\nMeyer, et al. 1982; and Brady 2003). (Cf. Fine 1974; Urquhart\n1972.) A Routley-Meyer frame \\(\\langle W, N, 0, R, {}^*\n\\rangle\\) consists of: \n\nAn evaluation then assigns formulas a truth-value at each world; so\nsome \\(p\\) may be true at one world but false at another. With the\nRoutley star, these may even be the same world. The conditions on\nimplication and negation are as follows: \n\nNothing prevents both \\(A\\) and \\(\\twiddle A\\) being true at some\nworlds; indeed, respecting relevance demands it. These conditions can\nbe seen as generalizations of more standard ones: in the case\nof implication, if \\(y = z\\) then this is just a modalized material\nconditional in a Kripke frame; in the case of negation, if \\(x = x^*\\)\nthen this is just the clause for negation in classical logic. For\nfurther details, see the entry on relevance logic, Mares (2004), and\nPriest (2008, ch. 10). On the Routley star see Restall (1999). \n\nRoutley/Myer semantics has generated an enormous secondary literature\n(cf. the secondary literature section of the bibliography), for\nexample Copeland 1979, 1983, Thomas 2015. Debates have surrounded:\nthe interpretation of the semantics (e.g., the ternary relation, the\nRoutley-star operator, non-normal worlds); alternative semantics for\nrelevant logics; the adequacy of non-classical responses to semantic\nand set-theoretic paradoxes; dialetheism; and naïve set\ntheory. For recent work about the ternary relation see Beall et al\n2012; for a recent exchange about the Routley star and negation, see\nBerto 2015, De and Omori 2018, and Berto and Restall 2019. \n\nSylvan’s instrumental need for inconsistent worlds in order to\naccount for implication led to tentative endorsement of the\npossibility of true contradictions (dialetheism). Most relevant\nlogicians thought of these “worlds” merely as artefacts of\nthe semantics, not as legitimate possibilities\n(indeed—they’re impossible!); but there the idea was, of\n“dialectical” or contradictory worlds. By (1976), he and\nMeyer consider a rather literal interpretation of Hegelian dialectic,\nand openly question the “Consistency Hypothesis” that the\nworld is consistent. They urge instead a “dialectical”\npossibility. They present the (relevant) logic DL (for\ndialectical logic), and give it an axiomatization that explicitly\nincludes an outright contradiction \\(p \\amp \\twiddle p\\) as\nan axiom. (Smiley calls this “Routley and Meyer’s\nwar work” (Smiley and Priest 1993, 17). See also van Benthem\n1979, Havas 1981.) \n\nWhen Graham Priest arrived in Australia and presented his\n‘Logic of Paradox’ to the 1976 meeting of the Australasian\nAssociation of Logic, another intensely productive partnership was\nstruck. With true contradictions—later to be named\ndialetheia by Sylvan and Priest—in view, the potential\nof surpassing classical logic opened up: \n\nThe liberating effect of giving up the classical faith … is\nimmense: … one is free to return to something like the grand\nsimplicity of naive set theory, to semantically closed natural\nlanguages (having abandoned the towering but ill-constructed and\nmostly unfinished hierarchies of formal languages), and to intuitive\naccounts of truth, of proof, and of many other intensional notions\n(1979b, 302). \n\nDialetheism, especially due to Priest, has prompted a long and growing\ndiscussion (see Priest 1987 [2006] and Beall 2009 for defences and e.g.,\nField 2008 for some useful criticism; see the bibliography in the\nentry on dialetheism for more). \n\nSylvan’s thinking about contradictions evolved, depending on his\nco-author, even over the course of a book. In Relevant Logics and\ntheir Rivals (1982), early chapters float dialetheism as a\nhypothesis, in an “agnostic” spirit (61), or that of\ntaking precautions; whereas later in the book, it states bluntly that\n“mathematics is inconsistent” (255). (The shift is\ncriticized by Urquhart in a 1988 review (Brady 2003, 2).) \n\nAs mentioned in the quote above, Sylvan saw that something like the\n“dialectical logic” DL could be used to\nunderwrite inconsistent but non-trivial mathematical and scientific\ntheories, which had been of interest to him since the start. Of\nparticular note is naïve set theory, used by Cantor, Dedekind,\nand Frege in the foundations of mathematics (see the entry on the\nearly development of set theory), but dealt an apparently fatal blow\nby Russell’s paradox circa 1900. Building from work by Brady\n(1971), naïve set theory as formulated with the implication\nconnective ‘\\(\\rightarrow\\)’ of DL (or the\nslightly weaker DK) takes as axioms that there is a set for\nevery property \\(A\\), i.e.,  \n\nwhere ‘\\(\\in\\)’ is read ‘is a member of’ and\nwith Sylvan’s preferred particular and universal quantifiers\n(see Section 2.1); and that sets are determined by their members,\ni.e., \n\nOn the basis of these axioms, comprehension and\nextensionality, in Routley (1977) he begins to sketch out\nwhat he hopes will be the “rehabilitation” of naïve\nset theory and more using ultralogic. \n\nA basic derivation in this set theory is that the Russell set exists,\nand is both a member of itself and not a member of itself. The\nparadoxes, in other words, are proofs, and the resulting\ncontradictions are theorems (1979b, 302). Sylvan sketches the\nfurther work needed to show that elementary principles such as the\nZermelo-Fraenkel axioms and their immediate consequences can be\nderived. And he speculates, much more ambitiously, that the Axiom of\nChoice and the Continuum Hypothesis could be decided as well; see\nWeber (2012). Priest 2006, chapter 18 is a discussion\nof paraconsistent set theory in this tradition. \n\nThe project was given an essential boost when Brady confirmed the\nnon-triviality of the theory in the late 70s, i.e., that there are\n(absurd) sentences that cannot be proved in this theory,\nresults which appeared as Brady (1989); see (Brady 2006). Further work\nin relevant arithmetic, by Routley, Meyer, Mortensen, Dunn, Priest,\nRestall, and others, followed. This led to the area now known as\ninconsistent mathematics, carried forward especially by\nMortensen (1995, 2010), where e.g., the Routley star is used as a\nfunctor to great effect; see the entry on inconsistent\nmathematics for further references. \n\nThis section mentions briefly some other applications of\nSylvan’s preferred logics to a wide range of philosophical\nproblems. Sylvan saw applications as a test for the choice of such\ntheories over rival logics. Sections 3 and 4 are in a way extended\ndiscussions of such applications. Sylvan argued that relevant and,\nmore broadly, what he termed “sociative logics” had\napplications in areas as diverse as causation, an analysis of\nknowledge, vagueness (including the idea that there are vague objects;\nsee Sylvan and Hyde 1993), and value theory. Here we sketch two such\napplications, in confirmation, and computation. \n\nFollowing Goddard (1977), Sylvan (along with Nola, in 1991) applies\nrelevant logic to solve the paradoxes of confirmation made\nfamous by Hempel. These are problems in philosophy of science about\nformulating inductive generalizations such as \nwhich is confirmed by instances of things which are both black and\nravens; but the universal generalization is logically equivalent to\nits contrapositive form \n\nwhich would similarly be confirmed by any non-black non-raven; but\nsince e.g., a red pencil is obviously not confirmation that\nall ravens are black, something has gone wrong. For Sylvan, the\nproblem—as is often his diagnosis—lies in the\nformalization of the natural language claims—“It is\nwell-known in relevance circles that the most outrageous of these\nparadoxes are automatically removed by replacement of the material\nconditional …” (2000a, 227). “A relevance\nshift,” he argues with typical restraint, “is a sure-fire\nway of knocking out all the paradoxes of confirmation” (2000a,\n232.). For discussion, see Fitelson (2006). \n\nAlong other lines, Sylvan made tentative steps in the foundations of\nrecursion theory, towards a non-classical theory of computation (cf.\nCopeland and Sylvan 1999; Sylvan 2000a). According to work by Turing,\nChurch, and Gödel in the 1930s, computers face logical limits on\nwhat they can compute (see the entry on the Church-Turing thesis and\nthe entry on computability and complexity). Uncomputability proofs,\nthough, bear a very strong resemblance to the derivations of\nRussell’s paradox and other diagonal paradoxes. If\n“dialectical” logic can be used to solve those paradoxes,\nthough—essentially, by accepting that they have truly\ncontradictory conclusions (see Section 2.2 above)—then could the\nsame be done in the case of computers? Then the conclusion would\nbe, not that there are uncomputable algorithms, but rather\n“there are more algorithmic functions than all algorithmic\nfunctions” (2000a, 195). Sylvan envisions “dialeth[e]ic\nmachines”; cf. Weber (2016). \n\nSylvan’s approach to logic is of a piece with his work in\nmetaphysics and ethics: a polemical rebuke of the perceived powers of\nthe day—in the case of logic, the hegemony of classical\nlogic—and a highly imaginative and open-minded attitude towards\nwhat sorts of entities—possible and impossible alike—our\nbest theories should condone. We turn now to these other aspects of\nhis work. \n\nIn this section, we present Sylvan’s work in ontology and\nmetaphysics. As discussed below, Sylvan was deeply inspired by Alexius\nMeinong but, as a matter of terminology, their understanding of\n‘ontology’ and ‘metaphysics’ differ: while\nMeinong would situate metaphysics and ontology as small corners within\na more general object theory, Sylvan situated them the other way\naround. (See, for instance, Meinong 1904, §2 and §11; Sylvan\n1995a, 47). In what follows, we follow Sylvan and employ what we take\nto be contemporary standard usage of ‘ontology’ (roughly\nunderstood as the study of what exists and what does not) and\n‘metaphysics’ (roughly understood as the study of the\nstructure of reality), while acknowledging that Meinong-scholars might\ndispute this use of terms. In Section 3.1, we sketch some of the\nessential features of noneism, that is, Sylvan’s theory\nabout non-existent objects. In Section 3.2, we discuss Sylvan’s\nattempt at expanding the horizons of traditional ontology by\ndeveloping a new theory called sistology. Finally, in Section\n3.3, we summarize Sylvan’s heterodox account of pluralism,\nlabelled plurallism. \n\nFrom 1965 on, Sylvan argued that, through the influence of Quine,\ncontemporary philosophy is committed to a fundamental mistake. Such a\nmistake, labelled the “Ontological Assumption” (cf. 1980),\nis represented by the view that one cannot make true statements about\nwhat does not exist. In opposition to this idea, Sylvan develops a\ntheory about (non-existent) objects or, in Sylvan’s jargon,\nitems—noneism. \n\n[Noneism is] a very general theory of all items whatsoever, of those\nthat are intensional and those that are not, of those that exist and\nthose that do not (…); it is a theory of the logic and\nproperties and kinds of properties of all items (1980,\n5–6) \n\nSylvan’s intuition is that, in order to be able to say something\ntrue about non-existent items, we need to allow for the possibility\nthat non-existent items have properties. For instance, in order to be\nable to say that ‘Sherlock Holmes is a detective’ is true,\nSherlock Holmes needs to have the property of\nbeing a detective. Now, according to Sylvan, a suitable\nphilosophical background for supporting this intuition is\nMeinong’s Theory of Objects. For this reason, in\nExploring Meinong’s Jungle and Beyond (Routley 1980),\nSylvan tries to deliver a modern logical presentation of\nMeinong’s philosophy. He writes: \n\nMeinong’s theory provides a coherent scheme for talking and\nreasoning about all items, not just those which exist, without the\nnecessity for distorting or unworkable reductions; and in doing so it\nattributes … features [properties] to nonentities [non-existent\nobjects] (1980, iv–v). \n\nAt nearly 1000 pages, Routley (1980) develops noneism in great\ndetail. We summarize it in five main theses, which represent the core\nassumptions of what Sylvan calls minimal noneism (from now on\nMN). First of all, following Meinong’s account\nof intentionality, Sylvan believes that: \n\n(1980, 1–2; 352). In other words, every time we refer to\nsomething, we refer to an item. If I tell a story about Sherlock\nHolmes, I tell a story about an item, namely that item that is the\nsubject matter of my story. \n\nThe second thesis is that: \n\n(1980, 2–3). Sylvan follows Meinong in claiming that some items\nexist (e.g., the Eiffel Tower) and some others do not (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes). Like Meinong, Sylvan treats existence as a property: some\nitems have the property of being red and some other items do\nnot; some items have the property of being existent (e.g.,\nthe Eiffel Tower) and some items do not (e.g., Sherlock Holmes). When\nitems do not have the property of being existent, they are\nnon-existent items. In Sylvan’s jargon, they are\n“nonentities”. \n\nFurthermore, according to the third and fourth theses: \n\n(1980, 2–3), and \n\n(1980, 2–3). Thesis (MN3)\ncorresponds to Meinong’s indifference principle: the\nproperties an item has are indifferent to the ontological status of\nthe item itself. Thesis (MN4) corresponds\nto Meinong’s independence principle: an item’s\nhaving properties is independent of whether the item in\nquestion exists or not. \n\nAs many have pointed out (cf. Russell 1905 and 1907; see also Berto\n2013 and Priest 2005), the original theory defended by Meinong faces\nproblems. In particular, Meinong’s theory is threatened by\ntriviality (Berto 2013, 106–107); that is, the\nsituation in which everything exists—including items that\nclearly do not.  E.g., if I refer to not just to Sherlock Holmes but\nto “the\nexisting Sherlock Holmes”, then it seems\nby (MN4) that Sherlock Holmes exists. \n\nIn order to resolve this issue, Sylvan makes two moves. First of all,\nhe introduces the distinction between characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties. The former are necessary in order to\ndefine the essence of an object. A characterizing property is a\nproperty (e.g., being a detective or being smart)\nthat is necessary in order to make a specific item (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes) the item that it is. Using Sylvan’s words: \n\nCharacterizing predicates [or properties] are those which specify what\nan item is like, in itself. They tell how an item is in fact. They\ngive its description. A good dossier of an item would perhaps give its\ncharacterization first, by way of its characterization features [or\nproperties] (Sylvan 1995b). \n\nOn the other hand, the non-characterizing properties are all those\nproperties that are not characterizing. According to Sylvan, the\nproperty of being existent is a non-characterizing\nproperty. \n\nAs it has been extensively argued in the secondary literature (see,\nfor instance, Priest 2005), the difference between these two kinds of\nproperties is unclear. It is also fair to say that, even though some\n(neo-)Meinongians have tried to cash out such a distinction in more\nprecise terms (see, for instance, Jacquette 2015 and 2017; Parsons\n1978 and 1980), there is little consensus that any progress has been\nmade. That being said, even though it is certainly difficult to have\nstrict criteria to separate the characterizing properties from the\nnon-characterizing ones, it is absolutely clear that: \n\n(1980, 2). This is the fifth and last thesis. \n\nThe second move Sylvan makes in response to the triviality problem is\nrepresented by the idea that, even though it is the case that every\ntime we refer to something we refer to an item, the item in question\nhas characterizing properties. Following Berto (2013), we can also say\nthat, consistent with some other neo-Meinongians (i.e., Jacquette 2015;\nParsons 1980), Sylvan argues in favour of the following\ncharacterization principle: \n\nfor any set of characterizing properties, some item satisfies\nit. \n\nConsider, for example, Sherlock Holmes. When we refer to Sherlock\nHolmes, we refer to an item (because of\n(MN1)). Moreover, even though Sherlock\nHolmes does not exist (because of (MN2)),\nhe has some characterizing properties (because of\n(MN3) and\n(MN4)). For instance, according to\nDoyle’s novels, Sherlock Holmes is a smart detective. If so, in\nSherlock Holmes’s set of characterizing properties, there are, at\nleast, two properties: being a detective and being\nsmart. However, the property being non-existent is not in\nthis set because it is a non-characterizing property. And this is\nguaranteed by (MN5). \n\nAs we have already specified above, minimal noneism is merely\nthe core of Sylvan’s noneism which is more elaborate and\nsophisticated than sketched here. Exactly because of its complexity,\nnoneism forces us to rethink some of our traditional approaches to\nimportant philosophical topics. Examples are intensionality,\nnonexistence, impossibilia, and paradoxicality. Moreover, in the light\nof these conceptual innovations, Sylvan also discusses some of the\nrelevant applications of noneism in philosophy of mathematics (cf.\n1980, 769–781 and 791–833), philosophy of perception\n(cf. 1980, 649–678), philosophy of time (cf. 1980,\n361–410); philosophy of science (cf. 1980, 781–791) and\nphilosophy of fiction (cf. 1980, 537–595). \n\nSylvan spent many years developing and defending noneism, but he was\nnot entirely satisfied with it. He had two major complaints. On the\none hand, he thought that his way of presenting noneism was\nrhetorically problematic: EMJB was too long, rambling, and not\nincisive enough. As such, EMJB needed to be rewritten (see Sylvan\n1995b). On the other hand, he aimed at “liberalizing\nnoneism” by allowing all items to have both characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties (Sylvan 1995b). Archival documents show\nthat, to this end, Sylvan tried to develop a new theory that has many\nfeatures in common with so-called “modal Meinongianism”,\nrecently defended by Priest. On these issues, see Casati (2018),\nGriffin (2018), Kroon (2019), Priest (2005). \n\nIn late life, Sylvan aimed at enriching the ideas defended in Routley\n(1980) by developing what he calls “sistology”. On the one\nhand, sistology adopts all the fundamental ideas of noneism. Like\nnoneism, sistology includes items that do not exist (cf. Sylvan 1991,\n837; 1997, 11–12) and it accepts that those items have\nproperties (cf. 1991, 838–39). On the other hand, sistology\ndevelops and enriches noneism in the following ways. \n\nTo begin with, Sylvan tried to move the focus of his attention from\nthe existence (or non-existence) of items to their being\nitems. Using Sylvan’s words, sistology is concerned with\n“all items as having standing” (1991, 838).\nThus, sistology aims at casting a new light on what it means to be\nan item instead of showing that it is possible to have\nnon-existent items. The latter project was the unique task of\nnoneism. \n\nSecondly, Sylvan tried to extend and deepen the catalogue of items he\ndealt with in Routley (1980). In an unpublished manuscript, Sylvan\ndescribed an imaginary museum in which all sorts of items are\naccepted. Among those items that have not been (comprehensively)\ndiscussed in his (1980), Sylvan listed: \n\nIn particular, Sylvan devoted significant effort to this last cluster\nof items, underscoring the idea they require the employment of a\nparaconsistent logic. Given that inconsistent items have inconsistent\nproperties, if classical logic is employed then triviality immediately\nfollows. In order to avoid trivialism, the adoption of a\nparaconsistent logic is required. \n\nConsider, for instance, inconsistent objects. (…) By virtue of\nwhat they are, they have contradictory properties, thereby\ntrivializing any theory built upon mainstream logic. An authentic\nsistology requires logical reformulation of a more demanding\nparaconsistent type (Sylvan 1991, 839). \n\nThe third and last attempt to develop noneism is represented by a\nserious engagement with the notion of a “source”. As he\nhad already discussed, a “source” is what allows us to\nunderstand the charactering properties that an item (cf. 1980, 463;\n1995a). The source of Anna Karenina’s characterizing properties\nis Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina. In sistology, Sylvan aims\nat deepening our understanding of sources by admitting that not all of\nthem are equally reliable. For instance, optical illusions teach us\nthat visual perceptions are not always a trustworthy source for\ncharacterizing the items we see. For this reason, Sylvan suggests\nintroducing two kinds of predicates. The first kind (call them\n“ordinary predicates”) tell us how items look;\nthe second kind (call them “non-ordinary\npredicates”) tell us how items really are. \n\nNot all sources are always reliable or otherwise satisfactory; for\nexample, perceptual sources are notoriously unreliable as to how\nthings really are. (…) Thus, [the] division of\n[ordinary and non-ordinary] properties is presumed (1991, 839; italics\nours). \n\nSistology, which is only sketched by Sylvan, nevertheless anticipates\nsome of the ideas currently debated among neo-Meinongians, for\nexample, as discussed above, with “items in general”.\nRegardless of the existence or non-existence of these items, sistology\nconcerns their “having standing” (1991, 839). In so doing,\nSylvan focuses his attention on one of the most under-researched\nnotions of Meinong’s theory of objects, that is, the so-called\ndoctrine of Outsidebeing [Aussersein]. Only recently\nhave neo-Meinongian started to turn their attention to this topic\n(Casati and Priest 2017; Grossman 1974; Jacquette 2015). So too with\nthe very particular kind of object that is “nothingness”\n(cf. Sylvan 1995a). After a long-standing lack of interest in these\ntopics, neo-Meinongians have begun to take them into serious\nconsideration as well (Casati and Fujikawa 2019; Priest 2014a and\n2014b; Jacquette 2013). \n\nIn the current philosophical landscape, there are many different forms\nof pluralism on offer. For instance, there is an\nontological form of pluralism (there are different ways of\nbeing), truth pluralism (there are different ways of being\ntrue), and there is a logical form of pluralism (there is\nmore than one correct logic; see the entry on logical\npluralism). However, it is almost universally assumed, if mostly\nunstated, that there can be no pluralism about the actual\nworld—this one is the only\nactual one. As should appear clear from this entry, though,\nSylvan was accustomed to challenging the philosophical consensus. He\nbegan by attacking classical logic, he continued by questioning the\nso-called Ontological Assumption and, late in his career, he decided to\nchallenge what he calls one-world-ism, that is, the idea that\nthere is only one actual world. \n\nSylvan argues that there is a plurality of actual worlds we all live\nin. In his Transcendental Metaphysics (1997) he claims: \n\nA theme, to be defended at length, is that while there is\nan actual world, which is suitably external,\nmind-independent, perceiver-independent, and the like, it is not\nunique. There are many actual worlds. That theme is bound to\nstrike others, as it still occasionally strikes me momentarily, as\nutterly outrageous. [My] work and arguments are designed to remove\nthis misconception (1997, 4). \n\nIn order to draw a clear distinction between his pluralism and the\nothers, he refers to his own theory with a neologism:\nplurallism. The aims of such a theory are summarized as\nfollows: \n\nThe overarching themes of plurallism are (…): (1) There is\nno unique world. There is no unique actual universe; (2)\nThere is no one unalterable truth; no single Way of Truth; (3)\nThere is no single correct Scientific Theory (1997,\n4). \n\nIn order to support these ideas, Sylvan presents two sets of\narguments. \n\nSylvan argues indirectly there is a lack of (good) arguments\nin favour of the uniqueness of the actual world. From the fact that\nthere is such a thing as an actual world it does not necessarily\nfollow that such a world is unique, nor is its uniqueness observable\n(cf. 1997, 54–60). \n\nOn the other hand, he directly supports plurallism by arguing\nthat for each area of research, there is (or there could be) a\nplurality of correct theories. His reasoning goes as follows. All\ntheories are grounded on logic because logic is necessary for\nreasoning about both the data used by those theories and the theories\nthemselves. And, if there is, not just one, but a plurality of\ncorrect logics, there is (or there could be) a plurality of\ncorrect theories which spring from all those different, but all\nequally acceptable, ways of reasoning as well (cf. 1997,\n61–74). From this, a plurality of actual worlds follows if we\naccept two enthymematic assumptions. The first one is that any correct\nlogic, in virtue of its being correct, properly describes an actual\nworld. If so, if there is more than one correct logic, there is more\nthan one actual world too. The second assumption, then, is that there\nare many correct logics. This idea was not shared by Sylvan’s\ncontemporaries but one that he came to defend late in his career,\nclaiming (1997, xix) “that not merely is there a plurality of\nlogics, but there is also [a plurality] of correct logics”. The\nidea is elaborated on in Sylvan (1997, ch. 4) and is now widely\ndiscussed in the literature (see, for instance, Beall and Restall\n2000; Russell 2008; Weber 2017b). Sylvan claims that phenomenological\ndata seems to support plurallism as well (cf. 1997,\n118–133). \n\nSylvan’s motivations for developing plurallism are not uniquely\nphilosophical. On the contrary, he believes that the existence of the\nplurality of actual worlds can have important political consequences\ntoo. One of those consequences is the extension and strengthening of\nour idea of tolerance. According to Sylvan, intolerant behaviours are\noften, if not always, grounded on ideologies driven by what he calls\nthe “one-true-way” (1997, 462) or the\n“one-admissible-way” (1997, 462). Governments,\nreligious groups, and even scientists believe that “truth should\nbe imposed” (1997, 462) where truth is what is uniquely\ndetermined by them. Plurallism invites us to entertain the idea that,\nas there is no such thing as a unique actual world, there is no such\nthing as a unique truth. And this should undermine the ideological\nroots of intolerant behaviours. \n\nIn many ways, Sylvan’s philosophical and logical research is\ndevoted to the attempt to be inclusive, open-minded, and, therefore,\ntolerant. Contra the Quinean admiration for desert landscape,\nSylvan admired an over-crowded jungle of ideas in which different\nlogics, all sorts of items, and a plurality of actual worlds could\npeacefully coincide. \n\nIn this section we describe Sylvan’s work in moral philosophy.\nHis seminal and frequently reprinted (1973; see also SEP entry\n“Environmental Ethics” Section 2) was, alongside Naess\n(1973), the first published work in environmental ethics and began a\ncentral debate in the area, one concerned with intrinsic value in\nnature. Elaborated on in Routley and Routley (1979b) and (1980a), this\nwork developed arguments against what he termed “human\nchauvinism”—the view that humans are exceptional in being\nthe sole locus of intrinsic value, all else having merely instrumental\nvalue. Alongside this work in environmental ethics more broadly, which\nwas to continue until his death, he also published in defence of\npacifism, against nuclear war, and was one of the first philosophers\nto point to the emerging moral issues associated with anthropogenic\nglobal warming. \n\nDeveloping out of influential work condemning Australian forestry\npractices in the early 1970s, (cf. Routley and Routley 1973a, Byron\n1999), Routley (1973)—“Is There a Need for a New, an\nEnvironmental, Ethic?”—presents a thought experiment\ndesigned to test what Sylvan took to be a core principle of Western\nethical systems, the Freedom Principle: \n\nOne should be able to do what he wishes, providing (1) that he does\nnot harm others and (2) that he is not likely to harm himself\nirreparably (1973, 15) \n\nHe calls this principle basic human chauvinism “because\nunder it humans, or people [whether present or future], come first and\neverything else a bad last”—a view later characterized as\n“anthropocentric” in the much expanded discussion of The\nLast Man Example in Routley and Routley (1980a, cf. 96). \n\nWe are invited to consider a world in collapse where humanity is\nreduced to a single person who then proceeds to eliminate, to the best\nof their abilities, “every living thing, animal or plant (but\npainlessly if you like, as at the best abattoirs).” (1973, 16)\nWith the demise of the last man (which we may suppose occurs\nimmediately prior to the wholesale destruction unleashed), there are\nno humans—either others or the last man himself—who could\nbe harmed by such an act and so, with clauses (1) and (2) satisfied,\nthe act is permissible according to the “human chauvinist”\nWestern ethical systems. (And even if “others” were\nextended to include non-human sentient creatures, still no harm,\nunderstood as suffering, would accrue given the act is done\n“painlessly”.) Yet, “what he does is wrong”\nand therewith we have a counterexample to such chauvinism and\nassociated Western ethical systems, and a claimed need for a new\nethic, “an environmental ethic”, capable of accounting for\nthe wrongness of the last man’s act. (As in his logical work,\nSylvan’s strategy is to try to isolate what is sufficient (in\nthis case, for wrongness) by considering “distant”\npossible worlds.) \n\nGranting the wrongness of the last man’s act, is a “new\nethic” really required? Preference utilitarianism has been\nconsidered as a “traditional” ethic capable of condemning\nthe last man. (Cf. Elliot 1980, 20 and 23; and Carter 2004,\n51–52 for a more limited condemnation along preference\nutilitarian grounds.) Where there is an overwhelming preference for\npreservation of the world beyond the death of the last man, and its\ndestruction would thus harm those having such a preference, the\nFreedom Principle would already appear to prohibit such an act\n(assuming the aggregated harm outweighs any benefit in the\nsatisfaction of contrary preferences). But notice that condemnation,\non this view, is highly contingent, depending on people’s\npreferences (condemnation is justified only if preferences\nconflict with destruction). Since the condemnation is thought to be\nwarranted with “no ifs and buts”, yet this\n“traditional” response offers the correct judgement only\nin special circumstances, for Sylvan, it counts as “too\nparochial” (Routley 1973, 20). (Cf. Lamb 2018, 532–3 for a\nsimilar point.) \n\nReacting, in part, to Leopold’s call for a “land\nethic”, Sylvan’s subsequent work in the area (much of the\nearly work with Val Routley, later Val Plumwood) proceeds to describe\nand argue for just such a non-anthropocentric, environmental ethic. A\ndominant aspect of this “new” ethic (indeed, a\ncharacterising feature in Elliot 1980) that was fixed on by\nsubsequent authors was the extension of non-instrumental,\n“intrinsic” or “final” values to the non-human\nworld. First mentioned in 1974 in early drafts of Routley and Routley\n(1980a) and subsequently Val Routley (1975), Rolston (1975), and\nCallicott (1979)—who all employ versions of the Last Man\nExample—the extension is described and defended at length in\nRoutley and Routley (1980a). (Sylvan assumes intrinsic value is, in\ngeneral, already assured on the familiar Aristotelian ground that\ninstrumental value requires intrinsic value, lest vicious regress\nensue—cf. Aristotle Metaphysics, 994b9–15.) \n\nSylvan and Plumwood hypothesise that what underpins the deontic\nprohibition of the last man’s act is the truth of the\naxiological claim that entities in non-human nature can possess more\nthan mere instrumental value—non-human nature “can have\nvalue and create obligations not reducible (in any way) to human\ninterests” (1980a, 129). While such items may have instrumental\nvalue, value as a means to human ends, advantaging us in various\nways—e.g., the value of forests in supplying water for human\nconsumption—they might also have “non-instrumental”,\nor what the Routleys called “intrinsic” value (1980a, 126\nand 129). Thus, the rejection of human chauvinism in its deontological\nform (the assertion of and the argument to the falsity of the Freedom\nPrinciple) was accompanied by its rejection in axiological form: not\nonly humans have intrinsic value; non-human nature may also be the\nlocus of intrinsic (non-instrumental) value. \n\nWhile accepting that we may have moral obligations with respect to or\nregarding entities in the non-human world, Routley (1973, 19) and\nRoutley and Routley (1980a, 174ff) deny that this entails our having\nobligations to them and deny, too, their having correlative\nrights. Sylvan rejects such an extension of rights to non-human\nentities. For this reason, he takes the “new environmental\nethic” to “differ markedly” from alternatives like\nLeopold’s land ethic. As it developed, it also differed markedly\nfrom most forms of utilitarianism for a broad range of reasons,\narguing instead for a deontologically constrained “optimisation\napproach to value theory”. (See Routley and Routley 1985; Sylvan\n1992.) Variants of Last Man counterexamples to traditional Western\nethics are also taken to show that the distribution of intrinsic value\nextends beyond sentient individuals—contra “animal\nliberationists” (1980a, 125) like Singer—so that\n“candidates for value … include all objects”\n(1980a, 140). \n\nResisting Sylvan’s broad push for a non-anthropocentric,\nenvironmental ethic are several arguments suggesting the inevitability\nof human chauvinism. Foremost among them are arguments that, he\nclaims, “parallel” arguments for egoism. Their rejection\nfollows similar grounds for rejection of egoism—cf. Routley and\nRoutley (1979b, esp. 47). This paper also distinguishes strong forms\nof human chauvinism (endorsing what Sylvan later termed the sole value\nassumption: that only members of the human class and some of\ntheir possible states have intrinsic value) from weaker forms that\nmerely endorse, for example, “the Greater Value Thesis: the\ninvariable allocation of greater value or preference … to\nhumans, while not however entirely excluding non-humans from moral\nconsideration” (ibid., 36)—a thesis also rejected\nby Sylvan. Paske (1991) defends a qualified version of the thesis; the\nmoral differentiation in favour of most humans can be\njustified (by appeal to deontologically-constrained hedonic\nconsequentialism). Attfield (1981), considering versions of the Last\nMan Example, also rejects strong human chauvinism while defending the\ngreater value thesis, thus defending a weak chauvinism in\nSylvan’s sense. “The good of trees might outweigh some of\nour whims: but it does not outweigh our interests except where our\ninterests depend on it” (1981, 51). \n\nPetersen and Sandin, on the other hand, defend a strong form of human\nchauvinism, arguing that the Last Man Example is subject to varying\nresponses depending on the motives attending the act of\nelimination. They thus reject the hypothesis of intrinsic values in\nnature, arguing instead that any supposed wrongness “can be\nbetter explained by precepts about last man’s character traits\nand motives” (2013, 133). It remains open whether such a\nresponse is adequate for the Last People Example (described by Sylvan\nimmediately following the Last Man Example) who may be said to act\n“for the best of reasons” though they have acted\n“badly” (Routley 1973, 16–17). \n\nA number of arguments against Sylvan’s hypothesised intrinsic\nvalue of natural items focus on supposed problems that attend the\napparently “cosmic” account of value that items are said\nto have in the absence of valuers (e.g., after the demise of the last\nman). Some focus on problems traditionally associated with moral\nobjectivism. If value is conceptually independent of valuers then:\nmoral intuitionism is an unacceptable consequence (cf. Mannison 1980,\n57, the charge of “realism”); moral theory is inconsistent\nwith (the preferred theory) moral projectivism (Carter 2004, who\nclaims a projectivist theory can explain our intuitions concerning the\nlast man); or such value is simply beyond epistemic access and\nirrelevant for decision-making (Justus et al. 2009,\n187–8). The latter point echoes earlier claims in Thompson\n(1990), Grey (1993), and Fox (1995) that the hypothesis of intrinsic\nvalue in nature results in values that, being too far removed from\nhuman concerns, are irrelevant as an ethical guide to human action\n(Thompson 1990, 159–60; Grey 1993, 464) and, in any event, are\nunnecessary—an enlightened anthropocentrism is sufficient. \n\nSylvan’s position on the ontology of values (discussed at length\nin 1980a, esp. 152ff) draws on the Last Man Example to claim that\nthings can, indeed, be valuable at a time when no valuers exist and\nextended thought experiments of a similar kind he takes to further\nestablish that things can be valuable in a world wherein no valuer\nexists at all, though a valuer must exist in some world (1980a, 156,\nfn 67; cf. also Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 143). Values are, he claims,\nconceptually dependent on valuers—thus the slogan “no\nvalue without valuers” remains true, he contends—and\ntherewith the rock of objectivism is said to be avoided (1980a,\n154). Elliot (1980) also contends that a non-objectivist account is\nsufficient for this kind of value engendered by the last man example,\nthough it is one requiring actual evaluators (“no\nvalues without actual valuers”). He goes on to describe\na subjectivist account that further links values to valuers\nin a manner that “makes the valuer the sole determinant of a\nthing’s value” (1980, 19) with value reduced to valuer\nevaluations. \n\nTaking himself to have avoided objectivism, Sylvan nonetheless argues\nagainst subjectivist accounts—intrinsic values are not\nsubjective either (1980a, 154). Intrinsic value in a world,\nwhile depending conceptually on valuers, nonetheless does not reduce\nto valuers in that world in any way. Some have remarked on\nthe apparent similarities between Sylvan’s account of intrinsic\nvalue and secondary qualities, suggesting his account amounted to a\nresponse-dependent account of intrinsic value (cf. Grey 2000). See\nLamb (2018, §IX) for argument to the contrary. \n\nIn the further elaboration of the “new ethic”, Routley and\nRoutley (1980a) develops a multiple factor model combining traditional\nvalues, such as the virtues and creature enjoyment, with environmental\nvalue-making factors, for example: diversity of systems and creatures,\nnaturalness, integrity of systems, stability of systems, and harmony\nof systems (170–171). So the shift to an environmental ethic\ndoes not reject ordinarily acknowledged welfare values for persons or\nhumans, but simply recognises a further set of factors contributing to\nintrinsic value in nature (171). Such value-making factors enter into\na mutually constrained optimisation so that the increase of one need\nnot increase the overall intrinsic value of the entity exemplifying\nit; thus, an increase in diversity in a forest may decrease value\ninsofar as it may come at the cost of naturalness (e.g., if the added\ndiversity comes from the anthropogenic addition of feral species not\nnaturally occurring in that forest). \n\nThe account of value is non-naturalistic in the sense that value is\nargued to be irreducible to natural features, even though\n“grounded” in them. (1980a, §5; Sylvan later\ncommitted to the supervenience of intrinsic value on naturalistic\nfeatures, Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 143). It is Meinongian in a number\nof respects—most obviously, drawing freely on Routley (1980),\ncf. esp. §8.11, values are features had by items but, like\nproperties, they do not exist (1980a, 153ff). Sylvan’s moral\nepistemology also draws heavily on Meinong’s account of\n“emotional presentation” (see Lamb 2018, §VIII):\n“the valued object may be emotionally presented and its\nvalue thus recognised, without its value simply amounting to\nits emotional presentation” (Routley and Routley 1983, 453). The\naccount is articulated at length in Sylvan (1986). Perhaps\nunsurprisingly, Sylvan’s semantic analysis of value (cf. Routley\nand Routley 1983) makes use of non-classical, relevant logic in its\nformal analysis. (Weber 2017a also draws on Sylvan’s work in\nnon-classical logic to develop a “new version” of the Last\nMan Example—the “Ultramodal Last Man”—with a\nview to avoiding an alleged dilemma besetting the original Last Man\nExample, “renewing a role for non-standard logics in value\ntheory”.) \n\nWhile Sylvan views the development of deep ecology sympathetically, he\ndistances himself from the positions being argued for under that\nbanner. His own “deep green ethics” is described most\nclearly in Sylvan and Bennett (1994, ch. 5). Like deep ecology, the\nposition is, using the term originally coined in Naess (1973),\n“deep” since it rejects the sole value assumption and\ngreater value thesis. But unlike deep ecology Sylvan rejects, in\nparticular: \n\narguing instead that some non-living things have intrinsic value and\nthat not all life is intrinsically valuable; and \n\narguing instead for eco-impartiality, thus not valuing members of one\nspecies over those of another simply on the basis of species\nmembership, and noting that evaluative impartiality with respect to\nspecies does not entail their equal value. More generally, Sylvan\n(1985) argues that under the strong West Coast US influence deep\necology commits to an assortment of dubious metaphysical and\npsychological themes—often leading to an anthropocentric\n“person- and consciousness-oriented soufflé”. And\nlinks to religion, in particular pantheism and nature mysticism,\nthreaten to “convert deep ecology into a new religion”.\nWhat results is a “deep ecology” that is\n“conceptually murky” and subject to\n“degeneration”. As noted in Section 1, laying out these\npoints of difference with deep ecologists in uncompromising style\nearned him the title ‘the bad boy of deep ecology’ (Orton\n2005, Other Internet Resources). For responses, see Fox (1986) and\nAttfield (1993). \n\nHis deep green theory is, following his metaphysical and logical\npluralism (cf. Sylvan 2000b), also pluralistic “allow[ing] for\nthe requisite theory dependence and cultural relativity of\nvalues” (1980a, 156), “there is no uniquely determined\ncorrect value system … there are various overlapping\nsystems” though he denies that ethical relativism follows from\nthis (Sylvan 1986, 13). He sees the ongoing cultural project of\ndeveloping an adequate environmental ethic as being in its early\nstages. \n\nGrey (2000) contends that the (proto)theory faces numerous problems;\nfor further analysis as to whether Sylvan’s position has been\nproperly targeted see Lamb (2018, 565–80 passim). \n\nNot content with mere theory, as noted in section 1, Sylvan also\nengaged in ambitious practical conservation work, acquiring high-value\nconservation properties for rehabilitation and protection. But the\nvalue of such rehabilitated landscapes is contested in Elliot (1982)\nand Katz (1992). Defending the idea that naturalness of origin is a\nvaluable aspect of wild nature, they argue that not only is restored\nnature of lesser value than any wilderness that it replaces, but the\nrestored copy could be described as “a fake or a forgery”\n(Elliot 1982, 84); restoration involves a “big lie” as\nKatz puts it. Sylvan thinks they have grossly overstated their case\nand responds in Sylvan (1994)—restored landscapes are not mere\nartifact or fakery. They are not contrived gardens devoid of natural\nvalues, artificial nature falsely presented as the real thing. \n\nConsider an area of restored bushland … The restoration results\nprimarily by nature doing its own thing; it is nothing like furniture\nor pottery making. An ecological restorer, unlike an artisan, does not\nproduce the item, there is no making … Rather there is\nadjustment at margins … and there is helping in\nhealing (Sylvan 1994, 68). \n\nSylvan argues that Elliot and Katz have illicitly extended the notion\nof an artifact, which is widely and wrongfully deployed in such\ndescriptions of restored natural areas and what they (especially Katz)\nhave failed to grasp is the value-enhancing role that restoration\nplays in the many situations where the damage has already been\ndone. Such restoration “is an addition, an attempt … to\nclaim back much more of what has [already] been grabbed and degraded\nor ruined” (Ibid., 75). In many cases restoration\nassists nature in reasserting itself and taking control once\nmore. What results lacks certain properties of the original, to be\nsure, especially natural continuity, but contributing to the\nrestoration of something to close-to-original value (as opposed to\nsome low-value fake) is, Sylvan argues, worthwhile and can result in\nnear-natural areas of enormous value. That is value enough. \n\nThough Sylvan is uneasy using the term ‘wilderness’\n“due to its long history of unfavourable associations and\nconnotation”, he agrees with the broader point being made by\nElliot and Katz—“ecological restoration is not an\nalternative to retaining wilderness, to remnant wildernesses”\n(Sylvan 1994, 75). However, they have overstated their case concerning\nthe value of restored landscapes. Elliot was persuaded, admitting that\nhe paid too little attention to the types of restoration that can be\nachieved and underestimated the value and degree of naturalness that\ncan result. In a book-length response to Sylvan and other critics and\nfellow travellers, Elliot (1997) clarifies his argument. Its Preface\nacknowledged the enormous debt to Sylvan. He is, Elliot came to think,\nquite right. “Mucking with nature” can result in something\nof significant value and it is, Elliot argued, in many cases\nobligatory to try to undo the damage we have done. \n\nA further practical issue which Sylvan sees as requiring theoretical\njustification is predation: the killing of animals for\nfood. “The vegetarian options face, it certainly seems,\ninsuperable difficulties, especially concerning such issues as animal\npredation (which is an important, immensely frequent, and\noften desirable, ecological fact), and concerning the\nreduction in numbers of animals, especially introduced animals, which\nbuild up to ‘pest proportions’ (some reduction is often\nrequired for vegetable growing to operate successfully)”\n(Routley 1982, 5). Sylvan himself, for example, culled feral rabbits\n(a damaging, introduced species in Australia) and he consumed the\nanimals killed. While his environmental ethic demands respect for\nintrinsically valuable non-humans, he argues that the \n\nrespect position is not a reverence position … interference is\nacceptable [in certain cases] … The lives, preferences,\nchoices, and considerations of other species or objects of moral\nconcern are not to be taken as sacred or inviolable [though we]\nrequire that good reasons be given for interfering with the\nenvironment (Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 149). \n\nSee Routley (1982, §4) for a defence (a paper which also presents\na moral defence of limited cannibalism). For a similar view see\nCallicott (1980) and for defence of the contrary claim that we ought,\nwhere possible, act to eliminate predation, even cases of wild animals\ntaking prey for food, see Nussbaum (2007, ch. 6). \n\nIn addition to work in environmental ethics, Sylvan wrote on other\nethical issues including arguments for moral obligations to future\ngenerations (cf. Routley and Routley 1978, Sylvan and Plumwood 1991),\nand the ethics of energy choice (Routley and Routley 1979c). The\nargument offered in the latter paper against nuclear power centres on\nthe (anthropocentric but nonetheless, in Sylvan’s view, salient)\nclaim that bequeathing toxic nuclear waste to future generations\nconstitutes an ethically unacceptable shift of costs onto others. And\na similar argument was mounted against conspicuous consumption of\nfossil fuels from what Sylvan and Plumwood then referred to as\n“atmosphere heating” (Routley and Routley 1979c, §3).\nTheirs appear to be amongst the earliest philosophical discussions\nfocussing on the ethics of climate change. And it is not just the\nclaimed immorality following from the consequences of climate change\nto future humans, though that is given weight; from a deep green\nperspective, the claimed erosion of value outstrips mere\nanthropocentric concerns and needs to take into account non-human\nnature, where the resultant erosion of intrinsic value is taken to\nloom large. \n\nConsidering destructive practices more generally, beyond those\ndestructive of the environment, Sylvan considered violence against\npersons, arguing that not only was nuclear war immoral, but that which\nconditionally promised it, nuclear deterrence, was also immoral (cf.\nRoutley 1984a). In fact, violence in general was, he argued, immoral,\ndefending pacifism and responding to the standard objections to it in\nRoutley (1984b). \n\nIn formal ethics, Sylvan defended a non-classical deontic logic.\nRoutley and Plumwood (1989) argued that the existence of moral\ndilemmas establishes the need both for: (i) a non-classical\npropositional logic underpinning deontic logic; and (ii) the rejection\nof some other central principles of orthodox deontic logic, especially\nthe principle of deontic consistency \n\nand the Kantian principle ought-implies-can (since dilemmas create\nimpossible obligations). He argues that the sentential fragment of\ndeontic logic must be paraconsistent and a relevant logic is\nrecommended (see Section 2). \n\nSylvan saw his ethics as systematically connected with issues in\nsocial and political philosophy, extending out from “deep green\nethics” to a broader “deep green theory” that\n“includes a radical social and political theory, centred upon\nsocial anarchistic forms of organization … and elements of\nradical economic theory … There have to be changes in\nsocial and political arrangements … towards less consumptive,\npopulous and wasteful societies, and so on” (Sylvan and Bennett\n1994, 151). \n\nSome of these ideas are discussed at length in Routley and Routley\n(1980b) where alternative forms of economic and political organisation\nare first considered from an environmental perspective. Sylvan focuses\nhis attention on what he takes to be an evident failure of the\npolitical arrangements proposed in the West. According to him, the\ngreat limitations to the freedom of human beings, the uneven\ndistribution of wealth and, above all, the constant damages caused to\nthe environment are all symptoms of a disease that must be treated.\nSylvan argues for what he calls pluralist anarchism, (a form\nof socialist anarchism) abandoning any form of government, including\nthe minimal one defended by Robert Nozick (2013). \n\nSylvan’s work in moral theory helped pioneer the rise of\nenvironmental philosophy as a new sub-discipline and connected\nenvironmental issues with broader moral issues as well as issues in\npolitical and social philosophy. Drawing on other work in metaphysics\nand logic, he sought new non-anthropocentric moral foundations,\nheavily critical of both traditional ethics and emerging alternatives\nthat lacked clarity and rigour. \n\nThe overall picture that emerges from Sylvan’s work is of a\nbroad philosophy that draws on non-classical (relevant) logic, a\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and a neo-Meinongian value theory as a\nmeans of accounting for “common-sense” ways of talking\n(e.g., about things that do not exist), ways of valuing (e.g., the\nseeming intrinsic value of things in the natural world) and\nsocio-political arrangements (e.g., a pluralist\nanarchism). Sylvan’s work was radical, but rigorous; a rich\nmany-worlds semantics underpins formal analyses. His work was\ncontentious; many traditional philosophical “problems” are\nclaimed to be artefacts of faulty orthodox theories. And his work was\nexpansive; philosophy’s traditional role with the question\n“How are we to live?” is taken seriously. Above all,\nSylvan’s thought was unified and systematic: “What is\nsought is a theory of values which blends both with object-theory and\nwith deeper environmental theory…” (1986, 1). \n\nSylvan’s program was left unfinished when he died. Whatever one\nthinks of his bold statements (“a wild mixture of wonderfully\nincisive ideas and absolutely false claims,” as Meyer put it in\n1996), Sylvan pushes philosophers to recognize that many propositions\ntaken as facts are not unrestrictedly true, but rather are\nrelative to what assumptions one is making about logic,\nontology, and value. Changing those assumptions changes the\npossibilities. And Sylvan’s work urges us to be ready for more\npossibilities—even what is, as he put it, “beyond the\npossible” (this is the title of an unpublished manuscript cited\nin Routley 1980).","contact.mail":"zach.weber@otago.ac.nz","contact.domain":"otago.ac.nz"}]
