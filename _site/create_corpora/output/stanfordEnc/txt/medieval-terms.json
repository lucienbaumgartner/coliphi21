It embraced those\nproperties of linguistic expressions necessary to explain truth,\nfallacy and inference, the three central concepts of logical analysis.\nThe theory evolved out of the work of Anselm and Abelard at the turn\nof the twelfth century, developed steadily through the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries and was still undergoing changes in the fifteenth\nand sixteenth centuries. It is generally agreed that its early stages\nwere closely bound up with the theory of fallacies, but as a general\nsemantic theory, it developed in response to a variety of needs, and\none mistake of modern attempts at interpretation is to seek a unique\nrationale of one notion or another. Each notion evolved continually,\nsatisfying one need at one time and another at a later date, and often\nseveral conflicting needs at the same time. Another mistake is to try\nto map each notion seriatim onto corresponding notions in\ncontemporary semantic theory, but although one can see analogies and\nsimilarities, none of the medieval “properties” matches\nexactly any modern notion.\n\nWilliam of Sherwood, writing from an Oxford perspective in the 1240s,\nidentified four properties of terms: “There are four properties\nof terms that we intend to distinguish now … These properties\nare signification, supposition, copulation, and appellation”\n(tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 105).[1]\n A different tradition is represented by Peter of Spain and Lambert of\nAuxerre, namely, that of Paris. Lambert identifies five properties of\nterms: “there are many properties of a term, namely,\nsupposition, appellation, restriction, distribution, and relation\n… But, because signification is, as it were, the perfection of\na term, and because the properties of a term are founded on\nsignification, one ought for the sake of clarity in what follows to\nsee at the outset what the signification of a term is and how it\ndiffers from supposition” (tr. Maloney, p.\n 253).[2]\n In his treatment he includes ampliation (a correlative to\nrestriction) and thereby matches the sections in Peter of Spain's\nTractatus: De suppositionibus (On Suppositions),\nDe relativis (On Anaphora), De ampliationibus (On\nAmpliations), De appellationibus (On Appellations), De\nrestrictionibus (On Restrictions), De distributionibus\n(On Distribution). \nTo these must be added further properties of terms which were\nimportant in the theory's gestation in the twelfth century but were\nlater no longer included as distinct properties: univocation,\nequivocation, adjectivation, substantivation and so on. From the\nfourteenth century onwards, other properties were also abandoned, so\nthat finally the important lasting properties were signification,\nsupposition, ampliation and restriction, and relation (that is, the\nsupposition of relatives, i.e., anaphora). \nGiven the central importance which it later attained, it is surprising\nhow late supposition was in being identified as one of the properties\nof terms. In the twelfth century, the primary distinction was that\nbetween signification, or univocation, and appellation. As early as\nAnselm's De Grammatico we find a distinction between\nsignificare per se (signify in itself) and significare\nper aliud (signify relatively). The latter was also known as\nappellare (to name or appellate). Whereas in the former\n(per se) what was signified was a form, in the latter what\nwas signified, or appellated, was a thing. A single form is common to\na number of things we call by the same name, so one crucial problem in\nthe philosophy of language is to understand how the different uses of\na name are unified in the face of the distinctness of the many\nindividuals talked about. In this way, we can understand the\nimportance in the twelfth century of univocation in contrast with\nappellation. Proper names, naming single items, are contrasted with\nappellative names, naming many. Univocation is the signification of a\nunivocal word, described in the Fallacie Parvipontane as\n“retaining the signification of the name while varying its\nsupposition/appellation” (my\n translation).[3]\n Thus a fallacy of univocation occurs when one does not realise that\nwhat is being talked about (the supposita or appellata) change. For\nexample, to infer ‘A dodo lives’ from ‘A dodo\nlived’ is a fallacy (of univocation) since the former is false\n(there are no living dodos for ‘dodo’ to stand for) while\nthe latter is true (for the past tense ampliates ‘dodo’ to\nstand for past dodos – see\n section 4).[4] \nThroughout much of the twelfth century, ‘supposition’\nretained the linguistic sense it had had since at least the time of\nPriscian (early 6th century CE), namely, the placing of a name as\n subject.[5]\n The relation of that name as subject to the thing named was called\nits appellation. This was the ability of a univocal appellative noun\nto name different things. The appellation of a name was not fixed,\nhowever. It could be ampliated or restricted by the predicate. So, for\nexample, the predicate ‘opinabilis’ (credible)\nampliates or extends the appellation of a name such as\n‘man’ to cover a wider range, perhaps of no longer\nexisting men, or of men who might have existed, or who might exist in\nthe future. Thus, appellation came to mean the present correct\napplication of a term (William of Sherwood, ed. Lohr et al., p. 265;\ntr. Kretzmann, p. 106), which could be ampliated, or even restricted\nby, say, the apposition of an adjective: ‘white man’\nappellates only white men, not all even presently existing men. \nLater, however, ‘supposition’ came to replace\n‘appellation’, and the latter term underwent its own\ntransformation. Supposition became the leading property of an\noccurrence of a term in a proposition (including now predicates, and\neven parts of predicates), distinguishing what in particular was being\nspoken of on some occasion of utterance by some particular use of a\nword, from that word's general property of meaning (signification).\nThe term ‘man’ signifies the form of man wherever the term\noccurs, but each occurrence of the term ‘man’ supposits\nfor the individuals in possibly distinct classes or groups of men\n(note that it supposits for the men, not the classes). \nGiven the literal meaning of ‘supponere’ as\n“acting as subject”, it is unsurprising that several\nauthors, even as late as Vincent Ferrer in the 1370s, restricted\nsupposition to subject terms, preferring to speak instead of\ncopulation as the corresponding property of the predicate. Those\nreservations aside, however, the natural similarity in function of\nsubject and predicate in picking out varying classes of things while\nremaining a univocal term, led most authors to extend the notion of\nsupposition to all terms. At the same time, talk of univocation was\nsuperseded by signification, by implication univocal signification\nunless equivocation was\n identified.[6]\n Burley (2000, p. 80) says that “supposition properly so called\nis a property of a subject term relative to the predicate”.\nHowever, “supposition taken broadly is a property of a term\nrelative to another in a proposition. In this sense, supposition\nbelongs to the subject as well as to the predicate, and even to the\nverb.”  \nA major shift in focus occurred in the early fourteenth century,\nprobably occasioned by Ockham – certainly, he was the leading\nfigure among the terminists, those who focussed “on terms as the\nbasic unit of logical analysis” (Ashworth 2010, p. 146). On the\none hand, signification came to be understood entirely extensionally,\ngiven Ockham's antipathy towards real universals. Accordingly, what\nwas taken to be signified by a term were the things of which it can be\ntruly predicated instead of a form or property which they share. For\nexample, whereas hitherto the term ‘man’ had been taken to\nsignify humanity, and ‘white’ whiteness, for Ockham the\nformer signifies (all) men and the latter all white things. From this\nperspective, the contrast found in thirteenth century authors between\n(as Peter of Spain called it) natural supposition versus accidental\nsupposition, becomes less important. Natural supposition was the\nterm's natural or nomic extension, accidental supposition that range\nof things it supposited for in a particular proposition. For Peter,\nthe term signifies a form, and supposits naturally for a class of\nobjects, whereas an occurrence of the term supposits accidentally on\nan occasion of use for a group of those objects. For Ockham, the term\nsignifies that class, the form being no more than a fictum (a\nfigment of the mind) or (in his later works) the mental act (of\nconceiving of those things) itself. \nFrom the early fourteenth century, signification and supposition came\nto dominate among the properties. Ampliation and restriction were\nalready functions of supposition (or appellation as it had been),\ncopulation as the naming function of predication is subsumed under\nsupposition, and relatio, the connection of anaphoric terms\nto their antecedents, becomes a discussion of the supposition of those\nterms. Finally, distribution is treated as a particular mode or type\nof supposition, confused and distributive supposition. Indeed, in the\nfinal phase, it could seriously be asked whether supposition was\nindeed a property of terms, as does Albert of Saxony (Quaestiones\ncirca Logicam, q. 12). For like many others, following Peter of\nSpain (2014, p. 240), he defines supposition as ‘acceptio\ntermini’ (the act of acceptance of a term) of various\nkinds, and so supposition is as much a property of the speaker or\nhearer as of the term. \nSignification contrasts with the other properties of terms in one\nmajor respect, for the other properties (perhaps with the exception of\nappellation in some authors, and natural supposition) are all\nproperties of terms relative to their occurrence in particular\npropositions – indeed, they are properties of occurrences of\n terms.[7]\n Signification, however, is independent of a term's particular uses or\noccurrences: “Signification differs from supposition in this\nthat signification is prior to supposition” (Lambert, tr.\nMaloney, p.\n 254).[8]\n Indeed, the other properties are dependent on the signification of\nthe term. For example, an occurrence of a term can only supposit\npersonally (see\n section 3)\n for certain objects in virtue of its signifying them, among others,\nor signifying some property they share. \nA twelfth-century commentary on the Perihermeneias reports\nPorphyry as saying that at the time of Aristotle, there was a great\ndebate over the principal signification of utterances: was it\n‘res’ (things) or incorporeal natures (Plato) or\nsensus (sensations) or imaginationes\n(representations) or intellectus\n (concepts)?[9]\n In fact, medieval philosophers of language were heir to two\nconflicting semantic theories. According to Aristotle, the greatest\nauthority from the ancient world, words name things by signifying\nconcepts in the mind (Boethius translated Aristotle's term as\npassiones animae – affections of the soul) which are\nlikenesses abstracted from them. But Augustine, the greatest of the\nChurch fathers, had held that words signify things by means of those\n concepts.[10]\n This led the medievals to the question: do words signify concepts or\nthings? The question had already been asked by Alexander of\nAphrodisias and his answer was transmitted to the medievals in\nBoethius' second commentary on Aristotle's Perihermeneias\n(De Interpretatione): “Alexander asks, if they are the\nnames of things, why has Aristotle said that spoken sounds are in the\nfirst place signs of thoughts … But perhaps, he says, he puts\nit this way because although spoken sounds are the names of things we\ndo not use spoken sounds to signify things, but [to signify]\naffections of the soul that are produced in us by the things. Then in\nview of what spoken sounds themselves are used to signify he was right\nto say they are primarily signs of them” (tr. Smith, pp.\n 36–37).[11]\n So words primarily signify concepts. \nBut the matter was not settled, other than that whatever view a\nmedieval philosopher took, it had to be made to accord with the\nauthority of Aristotle, perhaps in extremis by reinterpreting\nAristotle's words. Abelard refers to a distinction between\nsignificatio intellectuum (signification of concepts) and\nsignificatio rei (signification of the thing), more properly\ncalled nomination or appellation (see De Rijk, Logica\nModernorum, vol. II(1), pp. 192–5). Similarly, the\nTractatus de proprietatibus sermonum asks whether words\nsignify concepts or things, and responds: both (intellectum et\nrem), but primarily a thing via a concept as medium (op.cit. II\n(2), p. 707). \nA particular novelty of the thirteenth century, however, was to\nconceive of the concept itself as a sign. We find this in Lambert of\nAuxerre: “The signification of a term is the concept of a thing,\nfor which concept of a thing (intellectus rei) a vocal sound\nis imposed at the will of the one instituting it, for, as Aristotle\nproposes in Book One of On Interpretation vocal sounds are\nsigns of affections (passiones) that are in a soul, that is,\nin an intellect, whereas concepts are signs of things” (tr.\nMaloney, p.\n 253).[12]\n Hence by transitivity, utterances which are signs of concepts which\nare signs of things are themselves signs of things: “A vocal\nsign that is a sign of a sign … [will be directly] a sign of\nthe concept and indirectly a sign of the thing” (tr. Maloney, p.\n 254).[13]\n For example, ‘man’ immediately signifies the concept man,\nbut by mediation of the concept it signifies the second substance or\nform of man. Accordingly, it can supposit for what fall under man,\ne.g., Plato and Socrates. But it does not signify Plato or\nSocrates. \nAs noted above, this last distinction was elided by Ockham, in making\nthe mental act the universal, a name of the things. ‘Man’,\nhe says, signifies Plato and Socrates and all men equally, by virtue\nof its subordination to the mental act. Once signification is treated\nextensionally in this way, its only difference from supposition lies\nin its priority: a general term signifies all those things of which it\ncan be truly predicated (Ockham, Summa Logicae I c. 33). \nJust as signification corresponds most closely – though not\nexactly – to contemporary ideas of meaning or sense, so\nsupposition corresponds in some ways to modern notions of reference,\ndenotation and extension. The comparison is far from exact, however.\nOne major difference is that the medievals distinguished many\ndifferent modes (modi) of supposition. Despite the difference\nbetween different authors' semantic theories, particularly as they\ndeveloped over the centuries, there is a remarkable consistency in the\nterminology and interrelation of the different modes. \nThe major division is between material, simple and personal\nsupposition. Material supposition is when a term stands for a\nlinguistic item as such. Often, of course, this will be a case of\nautonymy, when it stands for itself. William Sherwood writes:\n“It is called material when a word itself supposits either [A]\nfor the very utterance itself or [B] for the word itself, composed of\nthe utterance and the signification – as if we were to say [A]\n‘man is a monosyllable’ or [B] ‘man is a\nname’” (tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 107).[14]\n Writing in Paris nearly a hundred years later, Thomas Maulfelt put it\nlike this: “Material supposition is a term standing for itself\nor for another similar to it in sound or writing suppositing in the\nsame way or otherwise which it was not imposed to signify or for some\nother sound which is not inferior to it, and which it does not signify\nnaturally and properly” (my\n translation).[15]\n ‘Noun’ supposits materially for itself when we say\n‘Noun has four letters’ – or ‘The term\n“noun” has four letters’; it doesn't supposit\nmaterially, but personally for itself, when we say ‘A noun is a\npart of speech’. \nSimple and personal supposition are sometimes grouped together as\n“formal supposition” (in contrast to material). Simple\nsupposition is harder to characterize generally. A common description\nis to say it occurs when a term supposits for the universal or form\nwhich it signifies. However, not everyone believed that terms\nsignified universals. (See the entry on the\n Medieval Problem of Universals.)\n So whereas William of Sherwood wrote “It is simple when a word\nsupposits what it signifies for what it signifies” (tr.\nKretzmann p.\n 107),[16]\n and Walter Burley likewise: “supposition is simple when a\ncommon term or an aggregated singular term supposits for what it\nsignifies” (tr. Spade p.\n 82),[17]\n William of Ockham appears to characterize simple supposition quite\ndifferently: “Simple supposition occurs when a term supposits\nfor an intention of the soul and is not functioning\nsignificatively” (tr. Loux p.\n 190).[18]\n But in fact, the difference between them is not in their theories of\nsupposition, but rather of signification. As we noted earlier, Ockham\nbelieves that a general term like ‘man’ signifies\nindividual men like Plato and Socrates; Burley that it signifies a\nsecond substance (the universal), man. Burley appeals to the authority\nof Aristotle: “‘man’ is the name of a second\nsubstance; therefore, the term ‘man’ signifies a second\nsubstance. And it does not signify a second substance that is a genus.\nTherefore, it signifies a species” (tr. Spade p.\n 87).[19]\n Ockham, however, dismissed real universals, and (at least in his\nlater theory represented in Summa Logicae) believed the only\nuniversals were words, including words of the inner mental language,\nmental acts. So for him, a spoken or written term has simple\nsupposition when it stands non-significatively for the mental act to\nwhich it is subordinated by the conventions of signification, that is,\nthe mental act abstracted from those things which the word\nconventionally signifies. \nJohn Buridan (Summulae, tr. Klima, sec 4.3.2, p. 253)\nfamously eliminated simple supposition altogether, for this very\nreason, namely, that universals are words of a mental language, so\nterms suppositing for them are suppositing for a kind of linguistic\nitem, and so such a case should be included under material\nsupposition. \nMaterial and simple supposition are contrasted with personal\nsupposition, what we might call the standard case, where a term stands\nfor ordinary objects – the objects it signifies (for Ockhamists)\nor for its supposita, as for example, Lambert (ed. Alessio, p. 209;\ntr. Maloney, p. 259) or Burley express it: “Supposition is\npersonal when a term supposits for its suppositum or supposita or some\nsingular of which the term is accidentally predicated” (tr.\nSpade p.\n 81).[20]\n The contrast is a useful one, as is shown in the following standard\nfallacies: \nThe premises are true and the conclusion false, so wherein lies the\nfallacy? It is one of equivocation or “four terms”:\n‘homo’ (‘man’) has simple supposition in the\nfirst premise and personal supposition in the second, so there is no\nunambiguous middle term to unite the premises. Again: \nThis time, ‘currens’ (‘running’) supposits\ndifferently in the two premises, materially in the first and\npersonally in the second, explaining why putting the two truths\ntogether fallaciously leads to the false conclusion. In earlier times,\nthese would have been called fallacies of univocation since what\nvaries is the supposition, not the signification, of ‘man’\nand\n ‘running’.[21] \nWhat determines whether a term has material, simple or personal\nsupposition? One view might be that it depends on the intention of the\nspeaker; another, that all propositions are ambiguous. However, the\nprevailing medieval view was that it was determined by the predicate,\nso that, e.g., a predicate like ‘is a noun’ requires\nmaterial supposition for the subject, while ‘is a species’\nrequires simple supposition: “A subject, on the other hand,\nsometimes supposits a form separately and sometimes does not,\ndepending on what the predicate demands, in accordance with the\nfollowing [principle]: Subjects are of such sorts as the predicates\nmay have allowed” (Sherwood, tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 113).[22]\n This slogan, talia subiecta qualia predicata permiserint\n(subjects are such as predicates permit), was commonly attributed to\nBoethius; but Sherwood correctly points out that Boethius' point was\ndifferent, and his phrase was the converse: “talia\n[predicata] qualia subiecta permiserint” – see De\nRijk, Logica Modernorum II (1), p. 561. \nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it became commonplace to\nrequire a nota materialitatis (a sign of the material use)\nfor a term in material supposition. Such a sign was to prefix\n‘iste terminus’ (‘this term’) or\n‘ly’ (taken from the French definite article) to the term.\nWithout such an indication, the term was considered to have personal\nsupposition by\n default.[23]\n The use of inverted commas is a much later innovation. \nPersonal supposition is divided by most authors into discrete and\ncommon supposition, the first that of singular terms (proper names,\ndemonstrative phrases and so on), the latter that of general terms.\nCommon personal supposition is again divided, namely, into determinate\nand confused, and the latter into confused and distributive and merely\nconfused supposition. These three modes are well illustrated by the\nfour categorical forms (see the entry on the\n  Traditional Square of Opposition): \n(A) All A are B. \n(E) No A are B. \n(I) Some A are B. \n(O) Some A are not B. \nThe subject of (I)- and (O)-, and the predicate of (I)-propositions,\nhave determinate supposition; the subject and predicate of (E)-, the\nsubject of (A)-, and the predicate of (O)-propositions have confused\nand distributive supposition; and the predicate of (A)-propositions\nhas merely confused supposition. This is common doctrine; what varies\nis how these modes are characterised. “It is determinate”,\nwrites William of Sherwood, “when the locution can be expounded\nby means of some single thing” (tr. Kretzmann, p. 108), but adds\na doubt: “It seems that when I say ‘a man is\nrunning’ [i.e. an I-proposition] the term ‘man’ does\nnot supposit determinately, since [A] the proposition is indefinite,\nand [B] it is uncertain for whom the term ‘man’ supposits.\nTherefore it supposits [A] indefinitely and [B] uncertainly; therefore\nindeterminately” (pp.\n 115–6).[24]\n But this is simply a matter of terminology, he replies –\ndeterminate supposition means suppositing for one, not for many, but\nfor no particular one, for that would constitute discrete supposition.\nNote, however, that for Ockham, Burley and others, a term with\ndeterminate supposition supposits for everything of which it can be\ntruly predicated. The sense in which it is true of one, rather than\nmany, is that the proposition is true if true of one. The term still\nsupposits for all. As Burley says: “The supposition is called\n‘determinate’, not because a term suppositing\ndeterminately in this way supposits for one suppositum and not for\nanother. Rather the supposition is called ‘determinate' because\nfor the truth of a proposition in which the common term supposits\ndeterminately it is required that the proposition be made true for\nsome determinate suppositum” (tr. Spade pp.\n 102–3).[25] \nAll that William of Sherwood can offer to characterize confused\nsupposition is to say that it is had when a term supposits for many,\nthen resorting to examples for its divisions. Peter of Spain tries\nharder: “Confused supposition is taking a common term in place\nof many by means of a universal sign” (tr. Copenhaver, p.\n 249),[26]\n and confused and distributive when it supposits for all. But this is\nstill unclear, and eventually a solution was found, in the doctrine of\nascent and descent. Call the individual things falling under a general\nterm its “inferiors”, and call the singular proposition\nresulting from a general proposition by replacing a general term (with\nits qualifier) by a term with discrete supposition for one of its\ninferiors, one of the proposition's “singulars”. Then the\ninference from a general proposition to one of its singulars is called\n“descent”, the converse inference, “ascent”.\nIf descent under a term is valid, or at least is valid without\nchanging the rest of the proposition, it is called\n“mobile”, otherwise “immobile”. Walter Burley,\nWilliam of Ockham and their followers could then define the three\nmodes of common personal supposition as follows: \nIn this last case, 2 (ii), Ockham noted: “it is possible to\ndescend by way of a proposition with a disjunctive predicate and it is\npossible to infer the original proposition from any [singular]”\n(tr. Loux p.\n 201).[27]\n Thus the predicate of an A-proposition has merely confused\nsupposition since descents 1 and 2 (i) are invalid, but from\n‘Every man is an animal’ one can validly infer\n‘Every man is this animal or that animal and so on for all\nanimals’, and conversely, from ‘Every man is this\nanimal’ (were it ever true) one could infer that every man was\nan animal. \nA final complication came at the end of the fourteenth century and\nsubsequently, when it was asked: “Are there only three modes of\ncommon personal supposition?” Some answered, ‘Yes’;\nbut others distinguished two modes of merely confused supposition, or\nequivalently distinguished a fourth case, 2 (iii), collective\nsupposition, where descent was permissible to a proposition with a\nconjunctive term. The standard example was ‘All the apostles of\nGod are 12’, which entails ‘Matthew and Mark and so on are\n12’, with a conjunctive\n subject.[28] \nSeveral recent commentators have asked what the medieval theory of\nmodes of common personal supposition was for: was it a theory of\ninference, of quantification, of truth-conditions, of fallacies, or\nwhat? Asking these questions may help us to come to terms with the\ntheory; but if pressed too hard, they are unhelpful. The medievals'\ntheory was none of these things; it was their theoretical basis with\nwhich to pose and answer semantic questions. \nAll modes of supposition so far described fall under what was\nvariously called proper supposition or accidental supposition or,\nexcluding material supposition, formal supposition. Distinct from\nthese were what Peter of Spain called natural supposition, mentioned\nearlier in the discussion of signification, and what Ockham and others\ncall improper supposition, covering metaphor and other figures of\nspeech. \nMoreover, various authors before the fourteenth century, and at least\none fourteenth century author too (namely, Vincent Ferrer) differed a\nlittle from what has been said in not attributing supposition to\npredicate terms, calling the corresponding property of predicates,\n“copulation”. However, even in the early thirteenth\ncentury, this distinction was fading. William of Sherwood makes it\nclearly: substantive names and pronouns supposit, whereas adjectives,\nparticiples and verbs copulate – all those terms which are\nattributed to something by means of the copula ‘is’. Only\nthe modes of common personal supposition are repeated for copulation:\n“every copulating word signifies in adjunction to a substantive\nand thus is copulated personally … [and] every copulating word\nis the name of an accident, but every name of an accident is common;\ntherefore no copulation is discrete” (Sherwood, tr. Kretzmann,\np.\n 121).[29]\n However, even in Lambert and Peter of Spain, there is only an empty\nnod towards copulation. Lambert notes that properly speaking,\nsupposition attaches to substantives, while copulation is appropriate\nfor adjectival terms. But broadly speaking, he says, supposition\nbelongs to both (ed. Alessio, p. 208; tr. Maloney, p. 258). The\ndistinction is clearly unnecessary and useless, and although the term\nis preserved in, e.g., Walter Burley's De Puritate, his\ndiscussion headed ‘On Copulation’ is in fact a discussion\nof the uses of the copula, ‘est’. \nSome words have the effect of widening or narrowing the supposition of\nother terms in a proposition. For example, by qualifying\n‘man’ with the adjective ‘white’, we restrict\nthe supposition of ‘man’ in ‘A white man is\nrunning’ to white men; while a verb in the past tense ampliates\nthe supposition of the subject to include what were its supposita. For\nexample, ‘A white thing was black’ means that something\nwhich is now white or was white in the past was black. \nLambert of Auxerre is typical in describing the many aspects of a\nproposition which can produce ampliation or restriction. Some are\nnatural, as when ‘rational’ restricts ‘animal’\nto supposit only for men by being adjoined to it; other cases are\n‘usualis’ – ‘use-governed’ in\nMaloney's translation (p. 278): when we say ‘The king is\ncoming’, we are taken to mean the king of the country where we\nare, so ‘king’ is restricted to supposit only for that\nking. Some ampliation and restriction is effected by consignification,\nthat is, by an aspect of a word – by the tense of the verb, or\nby the gender of an adjective: in ‘homo alba’, the\nfeminine ending of ‘alba’ restricts ‘homo’ to\nsupposit only for women, indeed, white women. Other ampliation and\nrestriction is effected by the signification of words – as in\nthe case of ‘rational animal’ just mentioned, or in\n‘Socrates' donkey’, where the possessive restricts\n‘donkey’ to supposit only for Socrates' donkeys. \nPeter of Spain (ed. Copenhaver, p. 441) notes that only general terms\ncan be ampliated or restricted, and only terms having personal\nsupposition. \nJust as the past tense ampliates the subject to include past as well\nas present supposita, modal verbs ampliate the subject to possible\nsupposita, as do verbs such as ‘understand’,\n‘believe’, and indeed, notes Albert of Saxony, verbal\nnouns ending in ‘-bile’: ‘possible’,\n‘audible’, ‘credible’, ‘capable of\nlaughter’ and so on. Albert realises that even\n‘supposit’ ampliates the subject: when we say ‘This\nterm supposits for something’, what it supposits for need not\nactually exist, but might be past, future, possible or merely\nintelligible. According to Buridan, ‘must’ ampliates for\npossible supposita, for ‘A must be B’ means\n‘It is not possible that A not be B’,\ncontradictories must clearly ampliate in the same way, and ‘It\nis possible that A not be B’ ampliates for\npossibilia. Ampliation over possibles means care is needed in\ninferences from ‘is’ to ‘can’: ‘A\ncan be B’ need not follow from ‘A is\nB’, for ‘A can be B’ means that\nwhat is or can be A can be B, and even if A is\nB, not everything which can be A might be capable of\nbeing B. For example, ‘Every planet lighting our\nhemisphere can be the sun’ is false even though it is in fact\nthe sun which lights it, since the moon might light our hemisphere but\nthe moon cannot be the\n sun.[30] \nIt is an interesting fact that almost alone among terminist logicians,\nOckham does not speak of ampliation and restriction. (See Priest and\nRead 1981.) The reason appears to be that he disagrees with the\ntruth-condition given above for ‘A white thing was black’,\nand similar cases. This proposition, he says, is ambiguous. Rather\nthan meaning that what is or was white was black, it equivocates\nbetween ‘What is white was black’ and ‘What was\nblack was white’: “in the case of every proposition of the\npast and of the future in which the subject is a general term or a\ndemonstrative pronoun with a general term or a discrete term referring\nto some composite, we must distinguish [two\n senses]”.[31]\n Whether Ockham realized that his theory improved on the ampliative\ntheory is unclear; nonetheless, his account seems to accord better\nwith intuition. For the ampliative account is disjunctive: it says\nthat the proposition is true if either what was white was black or\nwhat is white was black. Then it is true if either disjunct is true;\nwhereas on Ockham's account it has two different senses, and can be\nfalse on one while true on the other – true because something\nnow white used to be black but false if nothing which used to be white\nwas ever black. For a clearer case, take the first sex-change\noperation – for the first time, say, a woman was a man. But no\none who was a woman had ever been a man, so it was (also) false that a\nwoman was a man. The proposition ‘A woman was a man’ is\nambiguous and “est distinguenda ” (i.e.,\ndifferent senses must be distinguished, one true, one false). \nOckham also eschews talk of ampliation in giving his account of modal\npropositions. Does ‘A white thing can be black’ mean that\nwhat is or can be white can be black, i.e., that either what is white\ncan be black or what can be white can be black, as the ampliative\naccount demands? – cf., e.g., Albert of Saxony: “For\n‘A white thing can be black’ signifies that what is white\nor what can be white can be black” (my\n translation).[32]\n No, for this loses the sense in which it is self-contradictory to\nsuggest that it is possible that a white thing be black. The\nproposition is ambiguous, in one sense self-contradictory, in the\nother true, Ockham notes (Summa Logicae II 10), because\n‘This is black’ can be true if uttered pointing to\nsomething white: “‘A white thing can be black’ is\ntrue, because ‘This is black’ is possible, pointing to\nsomething for which ‘white’ supposits; but ‘A white\nthing is black’ is\n impossible”.[33] \nPerhaps the term with the most varied history is\n‘appellatio’, though even so, one can discern a common\nthread running through it. It starts, we saw, as an equivalent of\n‘nominatio’ in Anselm and Abelard, and by the thirteenth\ncentury is used to pick out the present extension of a term, that of\nwhich it can be truly predicated in the present tense: “So now\none should know that appellation is spoken of in four ways … In\nthe fourth way, appellation is said to be the acceptance of a term for\na suppositum or supposita existing actually, and our present focus is\non appellation spoken of in this fourth way” (Lambert, tr.\nMaloney pp.\n 261–2).[34]\n In Burley, at the turn of the fourteenth century, it almost usurps\nthe place of ‘copulatio’, being for him the relation of\nthe predicate to its inferiors: “Thus, just as supposition taken\nstrictly is a property of the subject insofar as it is matched with\nthe predicate, so appellation is a property of the predicate matched\nwith the subject or with an inferior” (tr. Spade p.\n 131).[35]\n There are shades too, of Abelard: “a univocal general term\nappellates its inferiors but does not signify\n them”.[36]\n But the crucial phrase which runs through the history of the term\nappears here too: “the predicate appellates its form”\n(De Puritate, p. 48: “praedicatum appellat suam\nformam”). What he says he means by this is that the predicate be\ntruly predicable at some time, in the present tense, of the supposita\nof the subject. \nIt is ampliation and restriction which distinguish this property of\nthe predicate from properties of the subject. For, on the standard\naccount, as we saw above, ‘A white thing was black’ is\ntrue only if ‘black’ has been truly predicable of the\nsupposita of the subject, namely, of what is or was white. In\ncontrast, ‘A white thing is black’ may never have been\ntrue – indeed, in this case, it never will have since it is\nself-contradictory. So the subject does not always “appellate\nits form”. A consequence pointed out by John Buridan, among\n others,[37]\n is that conversion needs application with care in such cases.\nConsider ‘The just will be justly damned’: this can be\ntrue, if those who are just sin in the future. But ‘Justly will\nthe just be damned’ is false, for ‘Justly are the just\ndamned’ will never be true. Similarly, ‘Socrates\napproaching you know’ can be true while ‘You know Socrates\napproaching’ (the “hooded man” fallacy from\nAristotle's De Sophisticis Elenchis 179b1–3) may be\nfalse (for you know Socrates, but do not recognize him approaching).\nIt is explained by reason of the fact that the predicate appellates\nits form (for ‘You know Socrates approaching’ requires\nthat the predicate ‘know Socrates approaching’ be true of\nyou and so is false), whereas ‘Socrates approaching you\nknow’ requires only that ‘Him you know’ be true,\nreferring to Socrates, and it is true. The doctrine of appellation\ncould thus be used to diagnose familiar fallacies. \nScott, in his discussion of Buridan's treatment of the sophism,\n‘You know the one approaching’ (pp. 42–9), claims\nthat Buridan's concept of appellation (which he misleadingly\ntranslates as ‘connotation’) in his diagnosis is novel,\nand Spade follows him in his commentary on Peter of Ailly (p.109\nn.188). But the notion is clearly continuous with Burley's in that\n‘appellating its form’ requires true predication via a\ndemonstration. Indeed, it is continuous with Lambert's usage, for\n‘chimera’ has no appellata precisely because ‘hoc\nest chimera’ (‘This is a chimera’) is false whatever\nis demonstrated. Admittedly, Buridan explicitly restricts appellation\nto appellative terms, that is, “every term connoting something\nother than what it supposits for” (Summulae de Dialectica:\nTreatise on Suppositions, tr. Klima, p. 291), and it\n“appellates that which it connotes as pertaining to that which\nit supposits for”. Thus ‘white’ connotes whiteness\nand supposits for white things. What appears to be novel in Buridan is\nthe extension of the doctrine to intentional verbs, which, says\nBuridan (and Albert), cause the terms following them (the predicate,\nor part of the predicate) to appellate their rationes, that\nis, the concepts by which they signify what they do. Thus in\n‘You know Socrates approaching’, the expression\n‘Socrates approaching’ appellates its concept, the\nratio ‘Socrates approaching’, and so the\nproposition is false unless you are aware who it is; whereas in\n‘Socrates approaching you know’, the subject\n‘Socrates approaching’ appellates its concept only under\ndisjunction to the rationes of other possible substituents in\nthe same grammatical position, and so it suffices that ‘Him you\nknow’ be true, where ‘him’ refers to Socrates under\nsome concept or\n other.[38] \nLambert of Auxerre (tr. Maloney, p. 290) speaks explicitly of relation\nas a property of terms, but most authors describe the phenomenon as\nthe supposition of relatives. The relation in question is that between\nanaphoric terms and their antecedents. Most treatises consist of a\nrepetition of a standard taxonomy: there are relatives of substance\nand relatives of accident, relatives of identity and relatives of\ndiversity. For example, relatives of substance and of identity are\n‘who’, ‘he’, ‘his’, and among\nthese, reciprocal relatives such as ‘himself’; of\ndiversity are ‘another’ and ‘someone else’.\nThe latter are said to refer back (referre, past participle\nrelatum) to their antecedent but to supposit for something\ndifferent, as in, e.g., ‘Socrates is running and someone else is\ndebating’. Relatives of accident include, first, those of\nidentity, ‘such as’, ‘like’,\n‘when’, and those of diversity, ‘in another\nway’, ‘other’; in, say, ‘Socrates is running\nand Plato is other’, ‘other’ refers back to\n‘running’; in what way it differs will depend on the\nauthor's account of predicates. \nIn contrast to the extensive taxonomy, medieval discussions of\nrelatives before the mid-fourteenth century seem rather short on\ntheory, dealing with puzzles more by common sense and description than\nin any unified way. For example, the prevailing view is that relatives\nof identity preserve the supposition of their antecedent. Why, then,\ncan they usually not replace the antecedent? Consider, e.g.,\n‘Every man sees himself’. Does ‘himself’ have\nthe same supposition as ‘man’ (or ‘every man’)\nand if so, why can the antecedent not replace it? – for\n‘Every man sees every man’ has a very different\nsignification. Lambert (tr. Maloney, p. 299) claims that in the case\nof reciprocal relatives the reciprocal pronoun can replace the\nantecedent unless the antecedent is taken universally, as here. In\nthis case, it still supposits for the same as its antecedent, but in a\ndifferent way, namely, discretely. Ockham spells it out: “in\n‘Every man sees himself’, ‘himself’ supposits\nfor every man by means of confused and distributive mobile\nsupposition: but it does this singularly since it is not possible to\ndescend without altering the other extreme … thus, ‘Every\nman sees himself, therefore, Socrates sees Socrates’” (tr.\nLoux p.\n 218).[39] \nOckham claims that, although non-reciprocal relatives of identity\nalways supposit for that for which their antecedent supposits, those\nwhose antecedent is a general term occurring with personal supposition\ncan never be replaced by their antecedent and result in an equivalent\nproposition. For example, ‘A man runs and he disputes’ is\nnot convertible with ‘A man runs and a man disputes’.\nBuridan has two rules to explain what is happening (Summulae,\ntr. Klima pp. 283–4): \nHence, in e.g., ‘Man is a species and it is predicable of\nmany’, or ‘Socrates runs and he disputes’, the\nrelative can be replaced without loss of meaning by its antecedent.\nBut in ‘A man runs and he disputes’, it cannot, for the\nsupposition would change. ‘He’ supposits only for men who\nare running, whereas ‘a man’, if it replaced it, would\nsupposit for all men. \nAnother issue concerned identifying the contradictory of a proposition\ncontaining a relative. A categorical containing a relative of identity\nsuch as ‘A, which is B, is C’ is\nequivalent to ‘A is B and A is\nC’. Hence its contradictory, ‘A, which is\nB, is not C’, says Albert of Saxony, is equivalent\nto ‘A is not B or A is not C’:\n“The second rule: a negative categorical proposition in which a\nrelative term occurs is equivalent to a disjunctive proposition: e.g.,\n‘Socrates, who is running, is not disputing’ has the same\ntruth-value as ‘Socrates is not running or Socrates is not\ndisputing’. And therefore such a proposition has two causes of\ntruth, each of which is sufficient on its own for its truth. Hence\n‘Socrates, who is running, is not disputing’ is true\neither because Socrates is not running or because Socrates is not\ndisputing. Hence because by the first rule the affirmative is\nequivalent to a conjunction, it follows that the negative\ncontradictory to it is equivalent to a disjunction composed from the\ncontradictories of the conjuncts, since conjunctions and disjunctions\nwith contradictory parts contradict one\n another”.[40] \nThe medievals did not have a solution to every semantic puzzle with\nwhich they were faced, any more than do contemporary philosophers. But\ntheir theory of properties of terms was the basis of a rich semantic\ntheory within which they were able to develop complete and fruitful\ntheories which yielded significant insights – both for them and\nfor us – into a broad range of semantic issues.","contact.mail":"slr@st-and.ac.uk","contact.domain":"st-and.ac.uk"}]
