The name of the school is a reference to the claim\nmade of Buddhism in general that it is a middle path (madhyamā\npratipad) that avoids the two extremes of eternalism—the\ndoctrine that all things exist because of an eternal essence—and\nannihilationism—the doctrine that things have essences while they\nexist but that these essences are annihilated just when the things\nthemselves go out of existence. The conviction of the Madhyamaka\nschool, which can be called the Centrist school in English, is that\nthis middle path is best achieved by a denial that things have any\ninherent natures at all. All things are, in other words, empty of\ninherent natures. This doctrine of universal emptiness of inherent\nnatures (svabhāva-śūnyatā) is the hallmark\nof the school, which places the school solidly in the tradition\nassociated with the Perfection of Wisdom\n(prajñāpāramitā) literature of\nMahāyāna Buddhism.\n\n\n\nThe key texts of the school comprised commentaries to the writings\nof Nāgārjuna—the works of Nāgārjuna most\noften commented upon are the\nMūla-madhyamaka-kārikā (MMK) and\nVigraha-vyāvartanī (VV)—and a number of\nindependent works that expanded on ideas found in Nāgārjuna’s\nwritings. A few of the Sanskrit treatises of the early Madhyamaka\nschool were translated into Chinese and became the basis of a\nshort-lived school of Chinese Buddhism. A significant number of\nSanskrit Madhyamaka texts were eventually translated into Tibetan and\nexerted considerable influence on the intellectual heritage of Tibetan\nBuddhism. This article will deal only with the Madhyamaka school in\nIndia from the fifth through the eighth centuries, during which time\nthe school underwent most of its evolution.\n\n\n\nThere a number of points that all Mādhyamika thinkers have in\ncommon. In all of them one finds some version of the doctrine of two\ntruths, according to which there is a level of understanding that\nconsists of an accurate account of the world as it is experienced in\neveryday life and another level of understanding that is conducive to\nreaching the ultimate goal (paramārtha) of Buddhist\npractice, namely, nirvana, understood as the absence of attachment,\naversion and delusion with no possibility of their return. There is\nalso broad agreement that language is limited to the everyday level of\nunderstanding and that the truth of nirvana is beyond the reach of\nlanguage and of the conceptualization that makes language possible. \n\nWhere differences arise among Mādhyamika thinkers is on the\nissue of how these two truths relate to one another. Does careful\nverbalization and thinking do any good in bringing one closer to\nnirvana, or is it invariably an obstacle? Is there any room within\nMadhyamaka for clear thinking and carefully wrought argumentation, or\nare all attempts to arrive at clear thought and rigorous argumentation\nultimately delusional and therefore to be abandoned along with more\nobvious forms of delusion? \n\nAnother area in which Mādhyamakas differ from one another is in\ntheir attitude toward the other main school of Mahāyāna\nBuddhism, the Yogācāra school, which Mādhyamikas present\nas advocating a kind of subjective idealism. Early Mādhyamikas\ntended to refute the Yogācāra doctrine that all the contents\nwithin awareness arise out of awareness itself and are thus\nontologically at one with consciousness. Later Mādhyamikas found\nroom for that view, usually by portraying Yogācāra as a\nphilosophy that prepares one intellectually and emotionally for the\ndifficult truth that all things are lacking in inherent natures and all\nthat we think of as knowledge is ultimately without grounding. \n\nAccording to traditional accounts preserved in Tibetan and Chinese,\nĀryadeva was born into the royal family in what is now Sri Lanka,\nrenounced his claim to the throne, took monastic vows, studied the\nBuddhist scriptures for several years, and travelled to south India. He\nreportedly became a direct disciple of Nāgārjuna. His\nprincipal writing, the Catuḥśatakaśāstra\n(Four Hundred Verse Treatise), was regarded as a Madhayamaka text and\nwas commented on by Candrakīrti and by prominent Tibetan\nproponents of the Madhyamaka school. \n\nThe first hundred verses of the Four Hundred Verse Treatise deal\nwith four illusions that must be dispelled by someone striving to\nachieve liberation from the root causes of dissatisfaction. The four\nillusions are the beliefs that there are permanent things in the world\nthat escape destruction, that impermanent things can provide true\nsatisfaction, that satisfaction can be derived from intrinsically\nimpure things, and that satisfaction can be attained by being\npreoccupied with oneself. These are standard themes in Buddhist\nwritings. The second set of one hundred verses also deal with standard\nBuddhist themes, namely, cultivating altruistic motivations, ridding\nthe mind of the afflictions of desire, anger, and delusion, and\ndeveloping habits of ethical conduct. While the first half of the\ntreatise is essentially inspirational in nature, the second half\nprovides arguments meant to prove that all things are conditioned and\ntherefore impermanent, that nothing qualifies as an independent and\nenduring self, and that there are no uncaused causes. Most of the\nverses dealing with these topics are polemical in nature and are aimed\nat refuting the doctrines of Brahmanical schools, Jainism and some of\nthe Buddhist scholastics. As is the case with other Mādhyamikas,\nĀryadeva focuses most of his attention on showing the\nincomprehensibility or absurdity of the doctrines under review. His\nmotivation for doing this is suggested in 8.10 (the tenth verse in the\neighth set of twenty-five), where he says attachment to one’s own\nviews and disparaging the views of others is an obstacle to nirvana,\nand tranqillity is impossible for those who engage in doctrinal\ndisputes. His exercise in showing the untenability of various\npositions, then, is presumably done not for the sake of refuting others\nin order to establish his own position, but to help his readers break\nthe habit of firmly holding tenets. \n\nAn example of Āryadeva’s demonstrating an inconsistency\nin a particular position is his critique of the view that there is a\npermanent self. He observes that since a permanent self could not\nundergo change, it could not be harmed or destroyed, and therefore it\nis inconsistent for those who believe in such a self to promote ethical\nguidelines against killing or harming others. While Āryadeva\nendeavors in some chapters to show the inconsistencies in a number of\nparticular doctrines of the Sāṃkhya and Vaiśeṣika\nschools, in the fourteenth chapter he provides a paradigm of an\nargument that can be applied to any number of doctrinal positions. That\nparadigm, which is familiar to readers of Nāgārjuna and other\nMādhyamikas, consists in showing that there is a problem in\nattributing a given predicate to a subject, and in attributing the\nnegation of that predicate, and in attributing both the predicate and\nits negation, and in attributing neither the predicate nor its\nnegation. For example, he argues that one cannot say that a pot is\nsingle, for it has many characteristics, such as color, shape,\nhardness, odor and so forth. It also cannot be said that the pot is\nmany pots, because none of the individual characteristics is a pot. It\ncannot be said that the pot is a single whole with many\ncharacteristics, because some of its components are material and\ntherefore capable of contact and location, while others, such as color\nand odor, are immaterial and have no location; it makes no sense to say\nthat characteristics that have contrary natures form a coherent whole.\nAnd yet to deny that a pot is either one or many is to deny that it\nexists at all, for an existent thing must have either a property or the\nabsence of that property. Āryadeva’s statements of these\narguments in verse is laconic and often difficult to follow; therefore,\nmost readers who study his text do so with the help of one of the many\ncommentaries written by later Sanskrit or Tibetan\nauthors.  \n\nAside from a commentary entitled Akutobhaya (Afraid of\nnothing), which is traditionally ascribed to Nāgārjuna but\nthe authorship of which is questioned by modern scholars, the earliest\nextant commentary to Nāgārjuna’s MMK is the\nMadhyamakavṛtti by Buddhapālita (ca 470–ca\n540). The original Sanskit of this text is not known to exist, but it\nis still extant in Tibetan translation. Buddhapālita’s\ncommentary, like Akutobhaya stays close to the text upon\nwhich it is a commentary. The MMK is written in verse, and\nBuddhapālita’s commentary places the words of the verse text into\nstandard prose word order and offers glosses to disambiguate\npotentially confusing words.  Like the MMK itself, Buddhapālita’s\ncommentary does not offer a positive position but rather shows the\nuntenability of all the apparently possible solutions to the\nphilosophical questions taken up for examination. The principal method\nof examining a position in MMK and in Buddhapālita’s commentary\nis to show that unwelcome consequences are entailed by the position\nunder consideration. \n\nAn example of the approach used by Nāgārjuna and\nBuddhapālita is their discussion of the relation between a cause\nand its effect, the topic taken up in MMK 1.1. There are only four\npossible relationships: the cause is the same as the effect, the cause\nis different from the effect, the cause is both the same as and\ndifferent from the effect, or the cause is neither the same as nor\ndifferent from the effect. This fourth position would be tantamount to\nsaying that there is no cause, and that an effect therefore arises out\nof nothing at all. Each of these four possibilities is rejected in\nturn, each for a different reason. Buddhapālita argues that if an\neffect were identical to its cause, then it would already exist as the\ncause and would have no need of coming into being a second time.\nIdentity of cause and effect defeats the very idea of causality. If the\neffect were different from the cause, on the other hand, then there would\nbe no constraints on what could arise out of what, so long as the cause\nand the effect were different. The third possibility is untenable, says\nBuddhapālita, since it is merely the conjunction of the two\nhypotheses that have just been shown to be untenable. A proposition\nconsisting of the conjunction of two false propositions cannot be true.\nThe fourth possibility, like the first, undermines the very idea of\ncausality. Moreover, says Buddhapālita, it would render all\npractice ineffectual; what he probably had in mind here was\nspecifically Buddhist religious practice, which is predicated on\nidentifying the root causes of dissatisfaction and then eliminating\nthose root causes so that dissatisfaction disappears. \n\nBeyond showing the untenability of each of the relations that were\ndiscussed as possible relations between the relata in a particular\nsituation, Nāgārjuna and Buddhapālita have little to\nsay. Opponents to the Madhyamaka school were critical of this\napproach, saying in effect that there is little value in finding fault\nwith a philosophical view unless one is prepared to offer a better\nview to replace the faulty one. As will become more clear in what\nfollows, it was precisely this issue—that is, whether there is a\nvalue in simply finding faults in philosophical views—that\nbecame controversial among Mādhyamikas. \n\nThe strongest challege to the commentarial tradition of\nBuddhapālita came from Bhāvaviveka, whose approach to\nMadhyamaka became the basis of what Tibetan Buddhists would many\ncenturies after the fact consider a subschool of Madhyamaka that\nrivalled the subschool comprising those who followed\nBuddhapālita. \n\nBhāvaviveka, who was also known as Bhavya and Bhāviveka,\nwas probably active in the middle part of the sixth century. His\ncommentary on MMK, entitled Prajñāpradīpa\n(Lamp of Wisdom), now extant only in Chinese and Tibetan translations,\ncontains not only his interpretation of Nāgārjuna’s thoughts\nbut also critiques of Buddhapālita’s approach to Madhyamaka, about\nwhich more will be said below, and critiques of the Buddhist abhidharma\ntradition. Prajñāpradīpa also incorporates\ncritiques of such non-Buddhist schools as Sāṃkhya,\nVaiśeṣika and the Jains. \n\nIn addition to his commentary to MMK, Bhāvaviveka wrote an\nimportant independent verse treatise on Madhyamaka entitled\nMadhyamakahṛdayakārikā (Verses on the Heart of\nCentrism) to which he provided a prose commentary called\nTarkajvālā (Flame of Reasoning). This combination of\nworks comprises eleven chapters. \n\nAs the titles of the chapters of this work show, Bhāvaviveka\nwas a student of most of the important movements in Indian philosophy\nof his era and sought to stake out the place of the Madhyamaka school\nwithin Buddhism as a whole. His understanding of Madhyamaka was\nimportantly different from Buddhapālita’s. Their different\napproaches turned out to define two of the three important sub-schools\nof Madhyamaka. \n\nA distinguishing characteristic of Bhāvaviveka’s approach to\nMadhyamaka is his conviction that a Mādhyamika should put forward\na positive argument for a position rather than merely showing the\ninadequacies of other positions. His criticism of Buddhapālita was\nfocused primarily on that very point; Buddhapālita offered no\nstatement of what the Mādhyamikas believe but confined himself to\npointing out that what other people believe is untenable in one way or\nanother. To criticize the positions of others but not to venture to\nstate a position of one’s own was regarded by the Indian debate\ntradition as a substandard use of argumentation called\nvitaṇḍā, which literally means making an\nattack. Bhāvaviveka was at pains to show that Mādhyamikas\ncould not legitimately be accused of this sort of philosophical\nsniping. He affirmed that Mādhyamikas do have a conviction that\nthey are prepared to state and defend, namely, that all phenomena are\ndevoid of an inherent nature, that is, a nature that they have\nindependently. All phenomena are conditioned, and such natures as they\nhave are natures that they acquire through their conditions rather than\non their own. The concise Madhyamaka way of saying all this is to say\nthat all phenomena (dharmas) are empty\n(śūnya). Since the Mādhyamikas believe that all\nphenomena are empty, they owe it to their readers to provide reasons\nfor thinking that that is a reasonable thing to believe. \n\nIn providing arguments in favor of the conclusions accepted by\nMādhyamikas, Bhāvaviveka followed the example set by\nDignāga (fl. ca. 510), a Buddhist whose principal contributions\nwere in the area of epistemology and logic. Dignāga, following\nwith some modifications philosophers of the Brahmanical Nyāya\nschool, had devised a canonical form of presenting arguments, which\nconsisted in identifying a topic (pakṣa) and reasoning\non the basis of an observed feature of the topic that it also had\nanother feature not currently available for direct observation. The\nstock example given in Indian logic is that if a particular mountain is\nthe topic, one can reason on the basis of observing smoke associated\nwith that mountain that there is also a fire associated with that\nmountain. Attributing an unobserved feature to a topic on the basis of\nan observed feature is legitimate only if one has previously observed\nthe feature used as evidence together with the feature being inferred,\nand if one has never seen the feature used as evidence in the absence\nof the feature being inferred. Dignāga’s method of presenting an\nargument consists, then, in stating a topic (pakṣa) and\na property used as evidence (sādhaka-dharma) for a\nproperty to be established (sādhya-dharma).\nBhāvaviveka followed this method in arguing for the conclusions of\nwhich he claimed Mādhyamikas are convinced; he also criticized\nBuddhapālita for failing to follow Dignāga’s method. \n\nIn his discussion of MMK 1.1, Bhāvaviveka makes the general\nobservation that when Nāgārjuna negates a proposition, he is\nnegating the entire proposition rather than negating just the\npredicate. If one negates just a predicate, that leaves open the\npossibility that some other predicate can suitably be applied to the\nsubject in question. Negation of a predicate in a proposition\npresupposes the existence of the subject of the proposition, whereas\nnegation of the entire proposition need not rest on such a\npresupposition. So when Nāgārjuna says that a phenomenon does\nnot arise from itself, one should understand that to be a way of saying\n“It is not the case that a phenomenon arises from itself.”\nIf one were to construe Nāgārjuna’s statement as equivalent\nto something like “The arising of a phenomenon is not from the\nphenomenon itself,” then one would naturally take that to be\nsaying that the arising of a phenomenon is from something other than\nitself. Alternatively, one might take it to be saying that the arising\nof a phenomenon is not only from itself but rather from\nsomething that is partly itself and partly something other than itself.\nIf one takes Nāgārjuna’s proposition to be a series of\nconjoined propositions of the form “It is not the case that a\nphenomenon arises from itself and it is not the case that a\nphenomenon arises from something other than itself, and it is\nnot the case that a phenomenon arises from itself in cooperation with\nsomething other than itself, and it is not the case that a\nphenomenon arises from nothing at all,” then there is no paradox\ninvolved in negating both a simple proposition and its contradiction.\nIt is therefore important to make it clear when Nāgārjuna’s\nnegations are sentential negations and when they are term-negations,\nand this Buddhapālita failed to do. \n\nBhāvaviveka goes on to explain that Nāgārjuna\nemployed sentential negations in MMK 1.1, because he was trying to\nestablish a kind of “non-conceptual cognition,” that is, an\ninsight that cannot be expressed in words. The scope of this\nnon-conceptual insight is everything that is capable of being cognized.\nIn other words, Nāgārjuna’s insight was that everything that\none thinks one knows, every explanation one thinks one has to account\nfor one’s experiences, is flawed and must ultimately be abandoned. In\nsaying this, Bhāvaviveka is consistent with a number of important\nstatements in MMK and VV. Nāgārjuna had laid emphasis on the\nclaim that the Buddha had dealt out two kinds of truth, a quotidian\ntransactional or conventional truth (vyavahāra-satya,\nsaṃvṛti-satya) and a truth concerning the highest goal\n(paramārtha-satya), namely, nirvana. Of these, only the\ntransactional truth is capable of being articulated in language. The\nhighest goal, consisting of a silence of the mind in which there is no\nconceptual thinking, is naturally inexpressible in language, since\nlanguage is necessarily bound up with concepts. Some form of this view\nwas shared by all Mādhyamikas. Where they differed with one\nanother was on the issue of how the teachings of Buddhism, which are\ncommunicated in language, relate to the highest goal of Buddhism, which\nlies outside the scope of language. \n\nNāgārjuna wrote in MMK 18.9 that the defining\ncharacteristics of reality (tattva, literally,\n“thatness” or quiddity) are that it is not conditioned by\nsomething other than itself, it is peaceful, it cannot be elaborated\nthrough verbal elaborations, it is non-conceptual, and it is uniform.\nIn his commentary to that verse, Bhāvaviveka expands the meaning\nof the verse by saying that anything that is not conceptual in nature\ncannot be expressed through verbal elaborations or through any other\nkind of sign. In other words, what is non-conceptual in nature cannot\nbe known indirectly, and knowledge gained through language is always\nmediated and indirect. For this reason, reality is entirely outside the\nrange of language. That notwithstanding, says Bhāvaviveka, what\nlanguage can do is convey something about the general nature\nof what is talked about. The statement that phenomena are lacking in\ninherent natures, for example, does convey useful general information\nabout reality. Even though reality itself can be known only directly\nthrough a non-conceptual awareness, language can be helpful in\nconveying that very information, namely, that reality can be\napprehended only directly and not through language. That the\nMādhyamika has, and defends, the view that reality lacks inherent\nnature means that the Mādhyamika is not merely engaging in\nphilosophical sniping of the vitaṇḍā\nvariety. \n\nIn his Tarkajvālā, in which Bhāvaviveka is\nfreed from the constraints of following Nāgārjuna’s texts and\nputs forward his own approach to Madhyamaka, he states that the term\n“highest goal” (paramārtha-satya) has two\naspects. One aspect is that it is free from volitional thought, pure\nand beyond the reach of verbal elaborations. Another aspect is that it is\nvolitional in nature, connected with the accumulation of knowledge and\nmeritorious karma, and connected with verbal elaborations and with the\ntransactional knowledge of everyday life. By seeing the ultimate goal\nin this way, Bhāvaviveka claims to give an account that leaves\nreality intact as a uniform whole about which knowledge can be diverse\nand incremental. This incremental nature of knowledge makes ample room\nfor the traditional Mahāyāna teachings of the gradated\nbodhisattva path whereby one moves from the aspiration for\nenlightenment to the gradual realization of enlightenment. A metaphor\nthat Bhāvaviveka uses for the Buddhist path is that it follows\nverbal teachings which are like a ladder that one slowly ascends until\none can climb over the wall into non-conceptual direct awareness of the\npeaceful reality of nirvana in which there is nothing to be wished for,\nnothing to be understood and no hypothesis to be defended. \n\nAs is usual for the majority of Indian philosophers, very little is\nknown about the life of Candrakīrti. Modern scholars place him at\nthe beginning of the seventh century. His two best-known works are his\ncommentary to MMK entitled Prasannapadā\nMadhyamakavṛtti (Clear-worded Commentary on Centrism), which\nsurvives in Sanskrit as well as in Tibetan translation, and an\nindependent treatise called Madhyamakāvatāra\n(Introduction to Centrism) available only in Tibetan translation.\nMadhyamakāvatāra is a verse text to which\nCandrakīrti provided a prose commentary. It is clearly an earlier\nwork than his commentary to MMK, since in that commentary he refers the\nreader repeatedly to Madhyamakāvatāra for the full\narguments for the positions he endorses. Both\nPrasannapadā and Madhyamakāvatāra have\nbeen studied by modern scholars and a significant number of passages\nhave been translated into modern European languages. In addition to\nthose works, Candrakīrti wrote a number of commentaries to\nrelatively short texts by Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva. \n\nAt the beginning of his commentary to MMK, Candrakīrti offers\nan extended criticism of Bhāvaviveka and a defense of\nBuddhapālita against the criticisms of Bhāvaviveka. Many\ncenturies after he wrote, Buddhist scholastics in Tibet portrayed\nCandrakīrti as the founder of one of the subschools of the\nMadhyamaka that they perceived. Because Bhāvaviveka had advocated\nfor producing independent (svatantra) arguments for the view\nthat all phenomena are empty of inherent natures, the Tibetan\nscholastics dubbed his subschool the Svātantrika school; because\nCandrakīrti criticized that approach and advocated for being\ncontent to show the unwelcome consequences (prasaṅga) of\nall possible positions on any given philosophical issue, his subschool\nwas named by Tibetans the Prāsaṅgika school of Madhyamaka.\nAlthough those terms were not used by Indian Mādhyamikas\nthemselves, it has become standard practice in modern scholarship to\nportray the Madhyamaka school as comprising at least two subschools\nwith those names and to see Bhāvaviveka and Candrakīrti as\nthe founders of those two subschools. \n\nThe earlier of Candrakīrti’s two principal works,\nMadhyamakāvatāra, has ten chapters, one for each of\nthe ten stages of the path of the bodhisattva. At each of these stages\nthe bodhisattva focuses attention on one of the virtues that are to be\nbrought to a stage of perfection (pāramitā). The\nvirtues to be perfected are generosity; good habits of thought, word\nand deed; patience; courage; meditation; wisdom; proselytizing skill;\napplication of vows; strength of character; and transcendental\nknowledge. The chapter dedicated to the sixth stage, at which wisdom is\ncultivated to perfection, is the chapter in which Candrakīrti lays\nout his most detailed exposition of the Madhyamaka school of\nphilosophy. Candrakīrti begins this chapter with the claim that\nwisdom is like a sighted person who is capable of leading a group of\nblind people safely to a destination; similarly, wisdom guides all the\nother virtues to their destination of perfection. As for the content of\nwisdom, it is the realization that no phenomena come into being.\nPhenomena cannot arise from themselves, since that possibility would\nmake arising unnecessary or redundant; if a thing already exists, it\nhas no need to come into being. If, on the other hand, it were allowed\nthat one being might rise out of a being other than itself, then there\nwould be nothing to prevent one from saying that pitch darkness arises\nout of light. Another way of looking at the issue of production from\ncauses is that the effect either already exists in the cause or it does\nnot exist. If it already exists, it has no need or coming into being.\nIf it does not exist, then it cannot be an agent that does the action\nof coming into being; but if there is no agent, then there is no\naction. \n\nAfter showing that there cannot be any intelligible account of the\narising of phenomena, Candrakīrti acknowledges that in everyday\nexperience we encounter phenomena coming into being all the time. This\nleads to a discussion of the two truths. The ultimate truth—that\nis, truth concerning the highest goal—is that phenomena do not\ncome into being; the conventional transactional truth, on the other\nhand, is that things do come into being and that their arising is\nconditioned. This conventional truth can therefore be understood as a\nkind of screen, an obstacle that stands in the way of seeing the\nultimate truth. In other words, the putative truths of quotidian life\nare actually delusions that, if believed, prevent one from attaining\nthe wisdom that is capable of leading to the imperturbable peace of\nnirvana. The truth of the highest goal cannot be conveyed in language;\nit can only be manifested in silence. That notwithstanding, the Buddha\ngave many teachings in words, so how is one to understand that? The\nBuddha, said Candrakīrti, spoke according to the linguistic\nconventions of the people to whom he talked. It is conventional to use\npronouns such as “I” and “you” and words like\n“self”; without such pronouns, grammatically correct\nsentences cannot be formed. It does not follow from grammatical\ncorrectness, however, that those words used in sentences have\nreferents. The Buddha’s insight was that there is no self, and yet he\nused the sort of conventional language that is commonly used by those\nwho do believe that there is a self. Similarly, even though the Buddha\nrealized that there are no phenomena coming into being and perishing,\nhe spoke the same kinds of sentences used by those who believe that\nphenomena come into being through conditions and then perish when the\nconditions that sustain them are no longer operative. If one is going\nto use language at all, then one cannot avoid using words and\nconstructions that apparently commit one to accepting the\npresuppositions upon which language rests. It is the task of the\nMādhyamika philosopher to expose those presuppositions as\nuntenable, to see that language is not grounded in realities but is\npurely conventional in nature. The Buddha, knowing what kinds of\nbeliefs his listeners had, gave doctrines that helped people get past\ntheir false beliefs. For example, to those who believed in an enduring\nand unified and essentially independent self, says Candrakīrti,\nthe Buddha taught that the self is not to be found in any of the\naspects of being human that might be a candidate for being regarded as\na self; he taught that the self is not the body, the personality,\nawareness, thoughts or feelings or anything else that arises through\ncauses and conditions, nor is there anything outside those things that\ncounts as a candidate for what people intuitively take to be their\nselves. To people who were inclined to a materialistic monism, the\nBuddha emphasized the importance of the mind as something that is\nindependent of the body. (About this, more will be said below.) \n\nAs was discussed above\n (section 4.2),\n Bhāvaviveka criticized Buddhapālita for failing to\nstate and defend the thesis of the Mādhyamikas. In the first\nchapter of his commentary to MMK, Candrakīrti comes to\nBuddhapālita’s defense and offers a sustained criticism of\nBhāvaviveka, and of the tradition of Dignāga on whom\nBhāvaviveka had based much of his approach. Bhāvaviveka’s\ncall for an independent argument in favor of a conclusion accepted by\nMādhyamikas, says Candrakīrti, is diametrically opposed to\nwhat Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva had written.\nNāgārjuna had written in VV that he has no thesis to advance.\nHe had also written that he apprehends no objects at all and therefore\nhas no need to affirm or deny anything, and since he neither affirms\nnor denies any proposition, he need not supply any reasons to justify\nhis stance. And Āryadeva had written that a person who makes no\nclaims, either that anything exists or that something does not exist,\ncannot be refuted. Candrakīrti cites those passages with the\nadditional comment that Buddhapālita had understood the spirit of\nMadhyamaka as set forth by those early Mādhyamikas. The\nMādhyamika, Candrakīrti goes on to explain, does not put\nforward counter positions in opposition to the claims of other\nphilosophers; rather, he shows the problems involved in the positions\nof others and argues only until the other philosophers realize the\ninadequacy of their positions and become silent. In the process of\nbringing others to silence, the Mādhyamika need not construct\nformal arguments, nor need he be consistent in what he says. Following\nĀryadeva’s observation, Candrakīrti says that the\nMādhyamika cannot be refuted, precisely because he has no position\nto defend. If Buddhapālita had put forth arguments, then he would\nhave opened himself up to endless disputation; since, however, he knew\nthat the purpose of Madhyamaka is to bring all disputation, and indeed\nall kinds of idle chatter, to an end, he wisely avoided putting forth\nformal arguments that a persistent opponent might take as an invitation\nto debate. If Bhāvaviveka had understood the point of Madhyamaka,\nconcludes Candrakīrti, he would not have made the criticisms he\nmade of Buddhapālita. \n\nAfter offering his criticisms of Bhāvaviveka, Candrakīrti\naddresses the school of Buddhist logic and epistemology founded by\nDignāga. The followers of this school did not present themselves\nas Mādhyamikas, so Candrakīrti does not accuse them of having\nfailed to understand Nāgārjuna properly. He does, however,\nconfront them with having failed to supply a convincing response to the\nradical critique Nāgārjuna had made of the very enterprise of\ngrounding convictions on indisputable foundations. He recapitulates a\npassage of Nāgārjuna’s VV in which it is said that any\nproposition that is supposed to be warranted must rest upon a\nfoundation of either direct experience or one of three kinds of\nreasoning. But the very claim that a proposition is warranted by a\nfoundation is itself a proposition, and as such it must either require\na warrant of its own or be deemed self-validating. If it requires a\nwarrant of its own, the result will be an infinite regress of\npropositions needing warrants; if it is declared self-validating, then\nwhy not say of all propositions they are self-validating? Dignāga\nand his followers went ahead and talked about the grounding of\npropositions as if Nāgārjuna had never questioned the\nenterprise. Unless they provide a clear and convincing response to what\nNāgārjuna said, there is no reason for anyone to take them\nseriously. \n\nOne further Buddhist movement that Candrakīrti criticizes is\nthe Yogācāra school, which he presents as advocating a form\nof subjective idealism. Their claim that the world of experience is\nconsciousness only and that the contents of consciousness cannot be\nobjects external to consciousness itself is supported by several texts\nwithin the Mahāyāna scriptural tradition. Candrakīrti\nexplains these scriptures as examples of teachings that the Buddha gave\nto counter a particular kind of commonly held wrong view. There are,\nsays Candrakīrti, those who mistakenly believe that all their\nsuffering is due to causes outside themselves; they see themselves as\nunfortunate victims of a hostile world. The Buddha, wishing to make it\nclear that the predominant factor in dissatisfaction is the way one\nthinks about one’s experiences, said, in effect “It’s all in the\nmind.” It would be a mistake to take that statement literally and\nto conclude that nothing but consciousness exists and that the world of\nexperience that feels as though it is external to consciousness is in\nfact produced by consciousness or is inseparable from consciousness. The\nYogācāra offers good reasons to show that the contents of\nconsciousness are conditioned and therefore are empty of inherent\nexistence, but they fail to appreciate that exactly the same can be\nsaid of awareness itself. In other words, says Candrakīrti, the\nYogācāra philosophers fail to acknowledge that\neverything, including consciousness itself, is empty. \n\nIn making the kinds of criticisms of other philosophers that\nCandrakīrti makes, he repeatedly advocates for taking ordinary\nexperience seriously and at face value. In everyday experience, we feel\nthat things arise and perish because of causes and conditions, and we\nfeel that we are conscious subjects on whom an external world is\nimpinging. We communicate with one another in readily comprehensible\nlanguage. There is no reason to change any of that, no reason to\nreplace everyday language with a more precise technical language that\nhelps avoid misprepresenting the nature of things. At the same time, it\nis important to be aware that it cannot be shown that things have fixed\nnatures and that there is no reason to believe about any of our beliefs\nthat they are grounded. The task of philosophy for Candrakīrti is\nnot to replace unwarranted beliefs with justified true beliefs, but to\nbreak the habit of forming beliefs, declaring them to be true, and then\nbecoming attached to them. \n\nAccording to traditional biographies, Śāntideva was born\nthe son of a king but abandoned the royal household for life as a\nBuddhist monk. Best estimates of the time of his activity place him at\nthe end of the seventh century. His best-known (and most frequently\ntranslated) work is Bodhicaryāvatāra (Introduction\nto the practice of enlightenment), also called\nBodhisattvacaryāvatāra (Introduction to the practice\nof the bodhisattva). He also compiled\nŚikṣāsamuccaya, an annotated collection of\npassages from Mahāyāna scriptures for students, and he\nauthored a commentary to Vasubandhu’s\nTriṃśikā, a key text in the Yogācāra\ntradition. Partly because he was a masterful stylist and wrote\ndelightfully beautiful Sanskrit verse, and partly because his work\nexerted a strong influence on Tibetan Buddhism, Śantideva has been\nthe focus of a considerable amount of modern scholarship in Japan,\nEurope and North America. All this makes him a good access point into\nMadhyamaka philosophy for those who are not specialists in Indian\nphilosophy. \n\nBodhicaryāvatāra is a verse composition divided\ninto ten chapters, each dealing with a different aspect of the\ntraditional depiction of the bodhisattva’s career. The topics of the\nten chapters are as follows: \n\nAs is the case with most philosophical works written in verse,\nBodhicaryāvatāra is usually studied with a prose\ncommentary. Śāntideva himself provided no prose commentary to\nhis work, but a Sanskrit commentary by Prajñākaramati is\nstill extant and is usually consulted by those who translate the work\ninto English from the original Sanskrit. Śāntideva’s work is\nalso preserved in Tibetan translation and is furnished with several\nTibetan commentaries, which are routinely consulted by those who\ntranslate Bodhicaryāvatāra into English from its\nTibetan translation. \n\nAlthough beautifully written, Bodhicaryāvatāra\ndoes not display much philosophical originality. Its principal\ncontribution is in offering a concise recapitulation of the currents of\nMadhyamaka thought and of Madhyamaka arguments against\nYogācāra monism, which portrays consciousness as the ultimate\nsource of all realities. While that is generally the case, one\ncandidate for novelty occurs in earlier chapters of\nBodhicaryāvatāra, where Śāntideva provides\na line of argument that became standard in discussion of\nMahāyāna ethics. His claim is that pain and unhappiness are\nby definition that which those who experience them wish to avoid. But\ngiven that there are no inherent natures that distinguish one person\nfrom another, or one kind of person from another kind, there is no\nrational basis to prefer one’s own experiences and judgments to those\nof anyone else or to prefer what one perceives as one’s own kind from\nother kinds of people. It is fundamentally irrational to take an\ninterest only in one’s own pain and suffering; the only reasonable\napproach is to be concerned with all the pain and unhappiness\nof which one becomes aware and to try to eradicate all of it without\nmaking artificial distinctions. Since, however, most of what anyone\nfinds painful and unpleasant arises from the conviction that some\nobjects of experience are inherently undesirable or impure, the best\nstrategy to follow in helping oneself and others overcome pain and\nsuffering is to show that there is no basis for the belief that some\nobjects are inherently undesirable or impure. That strategy also works,\nof course, when unhappiness arises from the frustration of not getting\nthings that one falsely believes are inherently desirable and pure. \n\nAs was the case with Candrakīrti’s\nMadhyamakāvatāra, Śāntideva’s\nBodhicaryāvatāra has the most to say about\nMadhyamaka philosophy in the chapter on the pefection of wisdom. A key\nverse in this chapter is 9.35, which says “When neither presence\nnor absence stands before the mind, the mind, having no content, calms\ndown because of the absence of cognition.” This recapitulates a\npoint made by both Nāgārjuna and Candrakīrti that the\nultimate goal of Buddhist practice is nirvana, a stillness of the mind\nin which there is no object being grasped as the focus of awareness, no\nnarratives (prapañca) being told to account for one’s\nexperience, no theorizing and no argumentation. At the outset of the\nchapter on wisdom Śāntideva says that the ultimate truth is\nof a reality that is not within range of the intellect; the intellect\noperates only at the level of conventional truth. In this world there\nare two kinds of human being, which Śāntideva calls ordinary\npeople (prākṛta loka) and meditators\n(yogin). The ordinary people are those who see the world in\nterms of presences and absences, being and non-being, but the\nconventional truths in which they trade are set aside by the truths of\nthe meditators. The principal delusion of those who rely on\nconventional truths is that they mistakenly believe that prospositions\nconventionally accepted as truth are grounded in the natures of things.\nMeditators, on the other hand, come to realize that things do not have\ninherent natures. That things do not have inherent natures cannot be\nestablished directly, but attempts to show that things do have inherent\nnatures can be shown to be faulty. One who has cultivated the intention\nto become enlightened in order to lead others out of their\ndelusion-driven suffering uses language to help people realize the\nlimitations of language and conceptual thinking. In taking this\napproach, Śāntideva is clearly following the lead of\nBuddhapālita and Candrakīrti. \n\nJñānagarbha, who was most probably the teacher of\nŚāntarakṣita, probably lived in the early eighth\ncentury. Because his presentation of Madhyamaka incorporates much of\nthe terminology used by Dharmakīrti, a member of the\nepistemological tradition founded by Dignāga, he is usually\nportrayed as a follower of Bhāvaviveka’s approach to Madhyamaka.\nLike his disciple Śāntarakṣita, Jñānagarbha\nalso incorporates aspects of the Yogācāra philosophy into his\npresentation of Madhyamaka and can therefore be seen as a source of\ninspiration to those who strove to find a synthesis of the two\nprincipal schools of Mahāyāna Buddhism. He wrote a commentary\nto a key Mahāyāna scripture,\nSandhinirmocanasūtra, which was one of the principal\nsources of the Yogācāra philosophy. He is best known for an\nindependent treatise called\nSatya-dvaya-vibhaṅga-kārikā (Verses on the\ndistinction between the two truths), on which he also provided a prose\ncommentary. The verse text along with its commentary can be referred to\ntogether as Satyadvayavibhaṅga. \n\nLike all the Mādhyamika thinkers who came before him,\nJñānagarbha regards it vitally important to have a clear\nunderstanding of two kinds of truth, the conventional and transactional\ntruth of everyday life, and the truth that liberates one from\nattachment, aversion and delusion, this liberation being the ultimate\ngoal (paramārtha) of Buddhism. In talking about these two\ntruths, Jñānagarbha draws liberally from the work of\nDharmakīrti, who had in turn built upon the epistemological\nfoundations laid by Dignāga. Dharmakīrti had said that\nsuccessful action is preceded by correct cognitions; what one deems to\nbe truthful is any cognition that motivates action that leads to\nexpected results. A true belief, then, is one that does not deceive one\nby promising to lead to a desired goal and then failing somehow to lead\nto that goal. A more positive way of expressing this, rather than\nsaying a true belief is non-deceptive, is to say that a true belief is\none that enables the realization of a goal\n(artha-kriyā-samartha). It turns out, said\nDharmakīrti, that correct reasoning is instrumental in helping one\nform beliefs that motivate successful action. Therefore, one can say\nthat conceptual thinking, when done carefully, can be of great value.\nEven when one’s goal is to achieve nirvana by having a direct\nexperience of a still and peaceful awareness that is not conceptual and\ntherefore beyond the range of language, one can arrive at that goal by\nlearning to think carefully and clearly. Clear and careful thinking has\nthe capacity to identify which of the ideas that arise in consciousness\nare ungrounded and delusional and therefore unlikely to motivate\nsuccessful action. Clear and careful thinking about what one hears\nothers say enables one to discard teachings that, if acted upon, are\nunlikely to produce expected results and to follow teachings that, if\nacted upon, will lead one to a desired goal, even the goal of the\nstillness of a mind that is not dealing in narratives and concepts.\nWithout much modification, Jñānagarbha takes up\nDharmakīrti’s terminology and the convictions that go with it. So\nJñānagarbha, like Bhāvaviveka, sees value in\nconceptual thinking and in careful thinking and speaking and sees less\nof a need than Candrakīrti and Śāntideva saw in finding\na way to eliminate all conceptual thinking and theorizing. \n\nJñānagarbha’s indebtedness to the epistemological\ntradition notwithstanding, he is still very much a Mādhyamika in\nthat much of his approach consists in showing the absurdities that lurk\nmenacingly inside all constructed theories. His notion of the ultimate\ngoal, like Candrakīrti’s, is a wordless and concept-free lucid\nawareness, but he sees it as possible to reach that goal by using words\nand thoughts intelligently. Moreover, he agrees with other\nMādhyamikas in his conviction that all thinking, even that which\ncan be called verdical because it leads to expected results, is based\non a presupposition that things have inherent natures—it is,\nafter all, almost impossible to talk without at least an implicit nod\nin the direction of inherent natures and essences—and that that\npresupposition is demonstrably false. So according to\nJñānagarbha rational thinking is simultaneously veridical,\nin that it leads to expected results, and false, in that it is based\nupon the demonstrably false presupposition that things that can be\nnamed are namable because they have inherent natures. While language\noperates within an ontology of causes and effects and various other\nkinds of relationship, such as temporal and spatial relationships, it\ncan be shown that those relationships are all untenable if one thinks\nabout them carefully and investigates them deeply enough. \n\nAt the heart of Jñānagarbha’s argument against the\ntenability of causality is his argument that none of the possible ways\nof looking at the relation of conditions and their effects are\nworkable. There are four possibilities. Either many conditions produce\na single effect, or many conditions produce many effects, or a single\ncondition produces many effects, or a single condition produces a\nsingle effect. His presentation of an explanation for why each of these\npossibilities is untenable is in places terse and difficult to\ndecipher. A single thing, such as vision, cannot be the effect of many\nconditions, such as the eye, visible color, an attentive mind and so\nforth, he says, because the effect has the feature of being one, while\nthe causes are many, but there is nothing to account for what causes\nthe reduction of many things to one. Without some coherent account of\nhow a manifold can be reduced to a singularity, this hypothesis ends up\nbeing merely an assertion. If one imagines that a manifold set of\ncauses produces a complex multiplicity of effects, then one is saying\nin effect that each component of the complex cause is producing one\ncomponent of the complex effect, and this amounts to saying that there\nare many instances of one cause producing one effect. On the other\nhand, if one thinks that each aspect of the complex effect is a single\neffect of the totality of features within the complex cause, then one\nis saying that a single effect has many conditions, which has already\nbeen ruled out. Moreover, one faces the problem of explaining how the\nsame totality of causes can have many distinct effects, each of which\nis a feature of the complex effect putatively arising from the causal\ncomplex. If one imagines that a multiplicity, such as the manifold\nuniverse, arises out of a single cause, such as God or Brahman or\nconsciousness, then one must provide a coherent account of what causes\nthe differentiation among the many effects. What one would expect is\nthat some auxiliary condition combines with the single cause to produce\ndifferent effects; but if that is the case, then a single cause plus an\nauxiliary condition is not really just a single cause. Finally, one\nmight imagine that a single cause produces a single effect, such as\nwhen one momentary phenomenon perishes and in the act of perishing\ngives rise to a subsequent momentary phenomenon of the same kind. That,\nhowever, is impossible, since the putative cause must go entirely out\nof existence before its successor can takes its place, and once the\npreceding phenomenon has ceased to exist, there is nothing to cause its\nsuccessor to arise. Since none of the possible ways of explaining\ncausality turns out to survive close analysis, one can only conclude\nthat the very ideas of causality, and of arising and perishing, and of\nunity and multiplicity cannot correspond to reality. Causality and\narising and perishing and all the various relations that furnish the\nframework of conventional truth may be indispensible to conventional\ntruth, but they cannot be features of reality. Jñānagarbha,\nlike the Mādhyamikas who came before him, sees conventional truth\nas a kind of screen or obstacle to the reality that becomes apparent\nonly to an awareness that is unencumbered by concepts and\nnarratives. \n\nWhile it is difficult to find much reliable information about the\nlives of most Indian philosophers, quite a bit is known about the life,\nespecially the later life, of Śāntarakṣita, details of\nwhose life were recorded by Tibetans when he went to Tibet in about 763\nand became the first abbot of Bsam-yas monastery. He was reportedly\nborn into the royal family of what is now Bengal and spent his adult\nlife in various Buddhist monastic universities. It is clear from his\nwritings that he had studied all branches of Indian philosophy\nextensively. He seems to have been a direct disciple of\nJñānagarbha, and his own disciple, Kamalaśīla,\nwas also an influential thinker. Together Śāntarakṣita\nand Kamalaśīla, both of whom spent many years in Tibet, set\nthe tone for Buddhist scholasticism in the eighth century, and their\ninfluence is felt in Tibetan Buddhism to this day. When\nŚāntarakṣita died in 788, he was succeeded by\nKamalaśīla, who lived until 795. \n\nŚāntarakṣita’s magnum opus is a composition entitled\nTattva-saṃgraha (Summary of reality), which contains\n3645 verses. The work was provided with a prose commentary by\nKamalaśīla called\nTattva-saṃgraha-pañjikā. A modern edition of\nthe verse work and its commentary together runs to more than 1100\npages. Aside from its contribution to the development of Madhyamaka\nthought, the work is also a valuable source of information about the\nstate of Indian philosophy in the eighth century. The work is divided\ninto twenty-six chapters, the topics of which are as follows: \n\nIn addition to Tattvasaṃgraha,\nŚāntarakṣita wrote commentaries on Dharmakīrti’s\nVādanyāya (Methods of debate) and\nJñānagarbha’s Satyadvayavibhaṅga. His most\noriginal contribution to the development of Madhyamaka philosophy is a\nverse treatise called Madhyamakālaṃkāra\n(Ornament of Centrism), which contains ninety-seven stanzas, to which\nhe also provided a prose commentary. \n\nBy the time Śāntarakṣita was active, the philosophy\nof the Yogacāra school had become so influential that it could not\neasily be dismissed. Whereas earlier Mādhyamikas wrote refutations\nof the Yogācara doctrine, which they presented as a kind of\nsubjective idealism, Śāntarakṣita embraced it. Like\nBhāvaviveka and Jñānagarbha,\nŚāntarakṣita adopted much of the terminology and the\nlogic and epistemology of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti and their\nlater followers. But whereas Bhāvaviveka had refrained from\nfollowing Dignāga and Dharmakīrti’s lead into Yogacāra,\nŚāntarakṣita endorsed a kind of subjective idealism,\nalbeit as a stage that prepared one for the Madhyamaka doctrine of the\nemptiness of all phenomena. Toward the end of\nMadhyamakālaṃkāra, in verses 92–93, he\nwrites that by embracing the doctrine of mind only, one stops taking\nexternal objects as real; then by embracing Madhyamaka, one realizes\nthat no objects at all have substance; then, taking the reins of\nreasoning, one rides the chariot of both systems as a single great\nvehicle (mahāyāna). The largest part of this\ntreatise—where the reins of reasoning are taken up—is\ndevoted to an extended version of the “neither one nor\nmany” argument that had been presented by\nJñānagarbha. \n\nMadhyamakālaṃkāra begins with the\nobservation that if a phenomenon has an essential nature, then either\nthat nature is simple or complex, that is, it is either a single thing\nor many things; there is no third possibility. This leads to\ndiscussions of doctrines by several schools of Indian philosophy, both\nBuddhist and non-Buddhist. Each of the schools examined posits at least\none entity that is completely uniform in nature and therefore has no\ninternal differentiations. Several schools posit a uniform entity that\nis said to be the single source of all multiplicity. Drawing on\narguments by earlier Buddhist thinkers such as Dharmakīrti,\nŚāntarakṣita argues that if there were a uniform,\npermanent and unobstructed singularity, then everything it supposedly\ncauses would have to exist all the time. A cause is something in the\npresence of which an effect arises and in the absence of which the\neffect does not arise. But if a cause is permanent, then it is never\nabsent, so none of its putative effects can ever be absent. In a theory\nthat posits a single permanent cause of all things, there is no\nsatisfactory account of all the changes that are experienced in daily\nlife, nor is there any satisfactory account of temporal sequences or\nthe fact that things exist in some places but not in others. This\nargument is applied to discredit the Sāṃkhya doctrine of\nprimordial matter, the Nyāya doctrine of God, and the\nVedāntin doctrine of Brahman. It is also applied to the\nYogācāra doctrine that all things arise from consciousness.\nAfter arguing against the main candidates for singularity nominated by\nthe various schools, Śāntarakṣita turns his attention\nto multiplicity. The very idea of multiplicity, he notes, only makes\nsense if one is talking about a collection of singularities. Given,\nhowever, that there are no singularities, there cannot be any collection\nof them. This being the case, no inherent nature of any entity can be\neither singular or multiple; if an entity has neither a singular nor a\nmultiple inherent nature, it has no inherent nature at all. In other\nwords, all phenomena are empty of inherent natures.","contact.mail":"rhayes@unm.edu","contact.domain":"unm.edu"}]
