We will be concerned only with natural\nlaw theories of ethics: while such views arguably have some\ninteresting implications for law, politics, and religious morality,\nthese implications will not be our focus here.\n\n\nThis article has two central objectives. First, it aims to identify\nthe defining features of natural law moral theory. Second, it aims to\nidentify some of the main theoretical options that natural law\ntheorists face in formulating a precise view within the constraints\nset by these defining features and some of the difficulties for each\nof these options. It will not, however, attempt to recount the history\nof the development of natural law thought. (For a very helpful\ndetailed history of natural law thought up to the beginning of the\nmodern period, see Crowe 1977. For a very helpful detailed history of\nnatural law thought in the modern period, see Haakonssen 1996. For an\narticle-length recap of the entire history of natural law thought, see\nHaakonssen 1992.)\n\nEven though we have already confined ‘natural law theory’\nto its use as a term that marks off a certain class of ethical\ntheories, we still have a confusing variety of meanings to contend\nwith. Some writers use the term with such a broad meaning that any\nmoral theory that is a version of moral realism — that is, any\nmoral theory that holds that some positive moral claims are literally\ntrue (for this conception of moral realism, see Sayre-McCord\n1988)— counts as a natural law view. Some use it so narrowly\nthat no moral theory that is not grounded in a very specific form of\nAristotelian teleology could count as a natural law view. It might be\nthought that there is nothing that can be done to begin a discussion\nof natural law theory in ethics other than to stipulate a meaning for\n‘natural law theory’ and to proceed from there. But there\nis a better way of proceeding, one that takes as its starting point\nthe central role that the moral theorizing of Thomas Aquinas plays in\nthe natural law tradition. If any moral theory is a theory of natural\nlaw, it is Aquinas’s. (Every introductory ethics anthology that\nincludes material on natural law theory includes material by or about\nAquinas; every encyclopedia article on natural law thought refers to\nAquinas.)  It would seem sensible, then, to take Aquinas’s\nnatural law theory as the central case of a natural law position: of\ntheories that exhibit all of the key features of Aquinas’s\nnatural law view we can say that they are clearly natural law\ntheories; of theories that exhibit few of them we can say that they\nare clearly not natural law theories; and of theories that exhibit\nmany but not all of them we can say that they are in the neighborhood\nof the natural law view but nonetheless must be viewed as at most\ndeviant cases of that position. There remain, no doubt, questions\nabout how we determine what are to count as the key features\nof Aquinas’s position. But we may take as the key features those\ntheses about natural law that structure his overall moral view and\nwhich provide the basis for other theses about the natural law that he\naffirms.  \nFor Aquinas, there are two key features of the natural law, features\nthe acknowledgment of which structures his discussion of the natural\nlaw at Question 94 of the Prima Secundae of the Summa\nTheologiae. The first is that, when we focus on God’s role\nas the giver of the natural law, the natural law is just one aspect of\ndivine providence; and so the theory of natural law is from that\nperspective just one part among others of the theory of divine\nprovidence. The second is that, when we focus on the human’s\nrole as recipient of the natural law, the natural law constitutes the\nprinciples of practical rationality, those principles by which human\naction is to be judged as reasonable or unreasonable; and so the\ntheory of natural law is from that perspective the preeminent part of\nthe theory of practical rationality. \nWhile our main focus will be on the status of the natural law as\nconstituting the principles of practical rationality, we should\nconsider for a moment at least the importance within Aquinas’s\nview of the claim that the natural law is an aspect of divine\nprovidence. The fundamental thesis affirmed here by Aquinas is that\nthe natural law is a participation in the eternal law (ST IaIIae 91,\n2). The eternal law, for Aquinas, is that rational plan by which all\ncreation is ordered (ST IaIIae 91, 1); the natural law is the way that\nthe human being “participates” in the eternal law \n(ST IaIIae 91, 2). While nonrational beings have a share in the\neternal law only by being determined by it — their action\nnonfreely results from their determinate natures, natures the\nexistence of which results from God’s will in accordance with\nGod’s eternal plan — rational beings like us are able to\ngrasp our share in the eternal law and freely act on it  (ST\nIaIIae 91, 2). It is this feature of the natural law that justifies,\non Aquinas’s view, our calling the natural law\n‘law.’  For law, as Aquinas defines it (ST IaIIae 90,\n4), is a rule of action put into place by one who has care of the\ncommunity; and as God has care of the entire universe, God’s\nchoosing to bring into existence beings who can act freely and in\naccordance with principles of reason is enough to justify our thinking\nof those principles of reason as law. \nWhen we focus on the recipient of the natural law, that is, us human\nbeings, the thesis of Aquinas’s natural law theory that comes to\nthe fore is that the natural law constitutes the basic principles of\npractical rationality for human beings, and has this status by nature\n(ST IaIIae 94, 2). The notion that the natural law  constitutes\nthe basic principles of practical rationality implies, for Aquinas,\nboth that the precepts of the natural law are universally binding by\nnature (ST IaIIae 94, 4) and that the precepts of the natural law are\nuniversally knowable by nature (ST IaIIae 94, 4; 94, 6).  \nThe precepts of the natural law are binding by nature: no beings could\nshare our human nature yet fail to be bound by the precepts of the\nnatural law. This is so because these precepts direct us toward the\ngood as such and various particular goods (ST IaIIae 94, 2). The good\nand goods provide reasons for us rational beings to act, to pursue the\ngood and these particular goods. As good is what is perfective of us\ngiven the natures that we have (ST Ia 5, 1), the good and these\nvarious goods have their status as such naturally. It is sufficient\nfor certain things to be good that we have the natures that we have;\nit is in virtue of our common human nature that the good for us is\nwhat it is. \nThe precepts of the natural law are also knowable by nature.  All\nhuman beings possess a basic knowledge of the principles of the\nnatural law (ST IaIIae 94, 4). This knowledge is exhibited in our\nintrinsic directedness toward the various goods that the natural law\nenjoins us to pursue, and we can make this implicit awareness explicit\nand propositional through reflection on practice. Aquinas takes it\nthat there is a core of practical knowledge that all human beings\nhave, even if the implications of that knowledge can be hard to work\nout or the efficacy of that knowledge can be thwarted by strong\nemotion or evil dispositions (ST IaIIae 94, 6). \nIf Aquinas’s view is paradigmatic of the natural law position,\nand these two theses — that from the God’s-eye point of\nview, it is law through its place in the scheme of divine providence,\nand from the human’s-eye point of view, it constitutes a set of\nnaturally binding and knowable precepts of practical reason —\nare the basic features of the natural law as Aquinas understands it,\nthen it follows that paradigmatic natural law theory is incompatible\nwith several views in metaphysics and moral philosophy. On the side of\nmetaphysics, it is clear that the natural law view is incompatible\nwith atheism: one cannot have a theory of divine providence without a\ndivine being. It is also clear that the paradigmatic natural law view\nrules out a deism on which there is a divine being but that divine\nbeing has no interest in human matters. Nor can one be an agnostic\nwhile affirming the paradigmatic natural law view: for agnosticism is\nthe refusal to commit either to God’s existence or nonexistence,\nwhereas the paradigmatic natural law view involves a commitment to\nGod’s existence. On the side of moral philosophy, it is clear\nthat the natural law view is incompatible with a nihilism about value,\nthat is, the rejection of the existence of values. It is also\nincompatible with relativist and conventionalist views, on which the\nstatus of value is entirely relative to one’s community or\ndetermined entirely by convention. It is also incompatible with a\nwholesale skepticism about value, for the natural law view commits one\nto holding that certain claims about the good are in fact knowable,\nindeed, knowable by all. \nThe center of Aquinas’s natural law view as described thus far\nconcerns what we might call the metaphysics of morals: its role in\ndivine providence and the universally authoritative character of its\nnorms. What, though, of the normative content of\nAquinas’s natural law position?  Is there anything\ndistinctive about the normative natural law position?  Here it is\ndifficult to say much that is uncontroversial, but we can say a\nsufficient amount about Aquinas’s natural law theory to make\nclear that it is an interesting alternative to utilitarian (and more\ngenerally consequentialist) ethics, Kantian views, and standard\nAristotelian positions. (For a magisterial treatment of\nAquinas’s natural law ethic, see Rhonheimer 2000.) \nAquinas says that the fundamental principle of the natural law is that\ngood is to be done and evil avoided (ST IaIIae 94, 2). This is, one\nmight say, a principle of intelligibility of action (cf. Grisez 1965):\nonly action that can be understood as conforming with this principle,\nas carried out under the idea that good is to be sought and bad\navoided, can be understood as an intelligible action. But no one can\nin acting simply pursue good — one has to pursue some particular\ngood. And Aquinas holds that we know immediately, by inclination, that\nthere are a variety of things that count as good and thus to be\npursued — life, procreation, knowledge, society, and reasonable\nconduct (ST IaIIae 94, 2; 94, 3) are all mentioned by Aquinas (though\nit is not clear whether the mentioned items are supposed to constitute\nan exhaustive list). \nSo on Aquinas’s view it is the good that is fundamental: whether\nan action, or type of action, is right is logically posterior\nto whether that action brings about or realizes or is some\ngood. The good is, on Aquinas’s view, prior to the\nright. But on Aquinas’s view we are, somehow, able to reason\nfrom these principles about goods to guidelines about how these goods\nare to be pursued. Aquinas’s thoughts are along the following\nlines: first, there are certain ways of acting in response to the\nbasic human goods that are intrinsically flawed; and second, for an\nact to be right, or reasonable, is for it to be an act that is in no\nway intrinsically flawed (ST IaIIae 18, 1). \nThe important task, then, is to identify the ways in which an act can\nbe intrinsically flawed. Aquinas does not obviously identify some\nmaster principle that one can use to determine whether an act is\nintrinsically flawed (though for an attempt to identify such a master\nprinciple in Aquinas’s work see Finnis 1998, p. 126), though he\ndoes indicate where to look — we are to look at the features\nthat individuate acts, such as their objects (ST IaIIae 18, 2), their\nends (ST IaIIae 18, 3), their circumstances (ST IaIIae 18, 4), and so\nforth. An act might be flawed through a mismatch of object and end\n— that is, between the immediate aim of the action and its more\ndistant point. If one were, for example, to regulate one’s\npursuit of a greater good in light of a lesser good — if, for\nexample, one were to seek friendship with God for the sake of mere\nbodily survival rather than vice versa — that would count as an\nunreasonable act. An act might be flawed through the circumstances:\nwhile one is bound to profess one’s belief in God, there are\ncertain circumstances in which it is inappropriate to do so (ST\nIIaIIae 3, 2). An act might be flawed merely through its intention: to\ndirect oneself against a good — as in murder (ST IIaIIae 64, 6),\nand lying (ST IIaIIae 110, 3), and blasphemy (ST IIaIIae 13, 2)\n— is always to act in an unfitting way. Aquinas has no illusions\nthat we will be able to state principles of conduct that exhaustively\ndetermine right conduct, as if for every situation in which there is a\ncorrect choice to be made there will be a rule that covers the\nsituation. He allows for the Aristotelian insight that the particulars\nof the situation always outstrip one’s rules, so that one will\nalways need the moral and intellectual virtues in order to act well\n(Commentary on NE, II, 2, 259). But he denies that this means that\nthere are no principles of right conduct that hold everywhere and\nalways, and some even absolutely. On Aquinas’s view, killing of\nthe innocent is always wrong, as is lying, adultery, sodomy, and\nblasphemy; and that they are always wrong is a matter of natural law.\n(These are only examples, not an exhaustive list of absolutely\nforbidden actions.) \nPart of the interest of Aquinas’s substantive natural law ethic\nlies in its not falling into the neat contemporary categories for\nmoral theories. His natural law view understands principles of right\nto be grounded in principles of good; on this Aquinas sides with\nutilitarians, and consequentialists generally, against Kantians. \nBut Aquinas would deny that the principles of the right enjoin us to\nmaximize the good — while he allows that considerations of the\ngreater good have a role in practical reasoning, action can be\nirremediably flawed merely through (e.g.) badness of intention, flawed\nsuch that no good consequences that flow from the action would be\nsufficient to justify it — and in this Aquinas sides with the\nKantians against the utilitarians and consequentialists of other\nstripes. And while Aquinas is in some ways Aristotelian, and\nrecognizes that virtue will always be required in order to hit the\nmark in a situation of choice, he rejects the view commonly ascribed\nto Aristotle (for doubts that it is Aristotle’s view; see Irwin\n2000) that there are no universally true general principles of right.\nThe natural law view rejects wholesale particularism. \nTo summarize: the paradigmatic natural law view holds that (1) the\nnatural law is given by God; (2) it is naturally authoritative over\nall human beings; and (3) it is naturally knowable by all human\nbeings. Further, it holds that (4) the good is prior to the right,\nthat (5) right action is action that responds nondefectively to the\ngood, that (6) there are a variety of ways in which action can be\ndefective with respect to the good, and that (7) some of these ways\ncan be captured and formulated as general rules. \nAquinas was not the only historically important paradigmatic natural\nlaw theorist. Thomas Hobbes, for example, was also a paradigmatic\nnatural law theorist. He held that the laws of nature are divine law\n(Leviathan, xv, ¶41), that all humans are bound by them\n(Leviathan, xv, ¶¶36), and that it is easy to know\nat least the basics of the natural law (Leviathan, xv,\n¶35). He held that the fundamental good is self-preservation\n(Leviathan, xiii, ¶14), and that the laws of nature\ndirect the way to this good (Leviathan, xiv, ¶3). He offered a\ncatalog of laws of nature that constitute the “true moral\nphilosophy” (Leviathan, xv, ¶40). There are also a\nnumber of contemporary writers that affirm the paradigmatic view.\nThese writers, not surprisingly, trace their views to Aquinas as the\nmajor influence, though they do not claim to reproduce his views in\ndetail. (See, for example, Grisez 1983, Finnis 1980,  MacIntyre\n1999, and Murphy 2001.) \nIt is also easy to identify a number of writers, both historical and\ncontemporary, whose views are easily called natural law views, through\nsharing all but one or two of the features of Aquinas’s\nparadigmatic position. Recently there have been nontheistic writers in\nthe natural law tradition, who deny (1): see, for example, the work of\nMichael Moore (1982, 1996) and Philippa Foot (2001). There were a\nnumber of post-Thomistic writers in the medieval and modern periods\nwho in some way denied (2), the natural authority of the natural law,\nholding that while the content of the natural law is fixed\neither wholly or in part by human nature, its preceptive\npower could only come from an additional divine command: the\nviews of John Duns Scotus, Francisco Suarez, and John Locke fit this\nmold.    Arguably the Stoics were natural law thinkers,\nbut they seem to deny (4), holding the right to be prior to the good\n(see Striker 1986). Some contemporary theological ethicists called\n‘proportionalists’ (e.g. Hallett 1995) have taken up the\nnatural law view with a consequentialist twist, denying (6). (For a\ndiscussion of the relationship between proportionalism and natural law\ntheory see Kaczor 2002.) And while some see Aristotle as being the\nsource of the natural law tradition, some have argued that his central\nappeal to the insight of the person of practical wisdom as setting the\nfinal standard for right action precludes the possibility of the sort\nof general rules that would (at least in a theistic context) make\nAristotle’s ethics a natural law position. There is of course no\nclear answer to the question of when a view ceases to be a natural law\ntheory, though a nonparadigmatic one, and becomes no natural law\ntheory at all. \nEven within the constraints set by the theses that constitute the\nparadigmatic natural law position, there are a number of variations\npossible in the view. Here we will consider several issues that must\nbe addressed by every particular natural law view, and some\ndifficulties that arise for possible responses to these issues.  \nIt is essential to the natural law position that there be some things\nthat are universally and naturally good. But how is universal, natural\ngoodness possible?  Given the variability of human tastes and\ndesires, how could there be such universal goods? \nNatural law theorists have at least three answers available to them.\nThe first answer is Hobbesian, and proceeds on the basis of a\nsubjectivist theory of the good. On subjectivist theories of the good,\nwhat makes it true that something is good is that it is desired, or\nliked, or in some way is the object of one’s pro-attitudes, or\nwould be the object of one’s pro-attitudes in some suitable\nconditions. One might think that to affirm a subjectivist theory of\nthe good is to reject natural law theory, given the immense variation\nin human desire. But this is not so. For one might hold that human\nbeings’ common nature, their similarity in physiological\nconstitution, makes them such as to have some desires in common, and\nthese desires may be so central to human aims and purposes that we can\nbuild important and correct precepts of rationality around them. This\nis in fact what Hobbes claims. For while on the Hobbesian view what is\ngood is what is desired, Hobbes thinks that humans are similarly\nconstructed so that for each human (when he or she is properly\nbiologically functioning) his or her central aim is the avoidance of\nviolent death. Thus Hobbes is able to build his entire natural law\ntheory around a single good, the good of self-preservation, which is\nso important to human life that exceptionlessly binding precepts can\nbe formulated with reference to its achievement. \nThe second answer is Aristotelian. The idea here is to reject a\nsubjectivism about the good, holding that what makes it true that\nsomething is good is not that it stands in some relation to desire but\nrather that it is somehow perfective or completing\nof a being, where what is perfective or completing of a being depends\non that being’s nature. So what is good for an oak is what is\ncompleting or perfective of the oak, and this depends on the kind of\nthing that an oak is by nature; and what is good for a dog is what is\ncompleting or perfective of the dog, and this depends on the kind of\nthing that a dog is by nature; and what is good for a human depends on\nwhat is completing or perfective of a human, and this depends on the\nkind of thing a human is by nature. So the fact of variability of\ndesire is not on its own enough to cast doubt on the natural law\nuniversal goods thesis: as the good is not defined fundamentally by\nreference to desire, the fact of variation in desire is not enough to\nraise questions about universal goods. This is the view affirmed by\nAquinas, and the majority of adherents to the natural law\ntradition. \nThe third answer is Platonic. Like the Aristotelian view, it rejects a\nsubjectivism about the good. But it does not hold that the good is to\nbe understood in terms of human nature. The role of human nature is\nnot to define or set the good, but merely to define what the\npossibilities of human achievement are. So one might think that some\nthings — knowledge, beauty, etc. — are just good in\nthemselves, apart from any reference to human desire or perfection,\nbut hold that the pursuit of these are only part of the natural law\ninsofar as they fall within the ambit of human practical possibility.\nThis view of the good is not much defended — in part because of\nthe scathing criticism offered of Plato’s view by Aristotle in\nthe Nicomachean Ethics (NE I, 6) — but it was affirmed\nby Iris Murdoch (1970), and forms part of the natural law view\ndefended by Michael Moore (1982). \nNone of these answers is without difficulties. While there are\ncontemporary defenders of Hobbesian moral theories (see Gauthier\n1986), there is no one who is on record defending Hobbes’s\ninteresting combination of a thoroughgoing subjectivism about the good\nalong with an account of a dominant substantive good around which the\nmoral rules are formulated. The basic reason for this just seems to be\nthat Hobbes’s arguments that the human desire for\nself-preservation is such an entirely dominant desire are implausible,\nand there do not seem to be any better arguments available. The\nPlatonic version of the view has struck many as both too\nmetaphysically ornate to be defensible, on one hand, and as not\nfitting very well with a conception of ethics grounded in nature, on\nthe other. While the Aristotelian version of the view has also been\ncharged with some of the metaphysical excesses that the Platonist view\nallegedly countenances, most contemporary natural law theory is\nAristotelian in its orientation, holding that there is still good\nreason to hold to an understanding of flourishing in nature and that\nnone of the advances of modern science has called this part of the\nAristotelian view into question. (For defenses of such Aristotelian\naccounts of the good, see Foot 2001, Thompson 1995, and Thompson\n2004.)  \nAnother central question that the natural law tradition has wrestled\nwith concerns our knowledge of the basic goods. How can we come to\nknow these fundamental goods? \nReturn to Aquinas’s paradigmatic natural law position. His\naccount of our knowledge of the fundamental goods has been understood\nin different ways (Murphy 2001, ch. 1). Some have understood Aquinas\nas affirming a theory of our knowledge of the fundamental precepts of\nthe natural law that we can label ‘derivationism.’ \nThe idea here is that we can derive from a metaphysical study of human\nnature and its potentialities and actualizations the conclusion that\ncertain things are good for human beings, and thus that the primary\nprecepts of the natural law bid us to pursue these things (cf. Lisska\n1996). One can imagine a Hobbesian version of this view as well. One\nmight say that by a careful study of the human being’s\ndesire-forming mechanisms, one can see that there are certain things\nthat would be necessarily desired by biologically sound human beings,\nand thus that the human good includes these items. (Hobbes in fact\nproduces such arguments at [EL], I, 7.)  While a natural law\ntheorist might downplay the importance of derivationist knowledge of\nthe natural law, it is hard to see how a consistent natural law\ntheorist could entirely reject the possibility of such\nknowledge, given the view that we can provide a substantial account of\nhow the human good is grounded in nature: for to show that the human\ngood is grounded in nature is to show that human nature explains why\ncertain things are goods, and it is hard to see how one could affirm\nthat claim while entirely rejecting the possibility of derivationist\nknowledge of the human good (see Murphy 2001, pp. 16–17). Some\nhave thought, echoing criticisms of natural law theory by those\nentirely hostile to it, that derivationist theories of practical\nknowledge fall prey to ‘Hume’s Law,’ that it is\nimpossible to derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is,’\nthat is, any normative truth from any set of nonnormative truths. The\nmost that this can show, though, is that the natural law theorist\nneeds an account of those bridge truths that enable us to move between\nclaims about human nature and claims about human goods. \nIt must be conceded, however, that a consistent natural law theorist\ncould hardly hold that derivationist knowledge of the human good is\nthe only such knowledge possible. For it is part of the paradigm\nnatural law view that the basic principles of the natural law are\nknown by all, and the sort of arguments that would need to be made in\norder to produce derivationist knowledge of the human good are\ncertainly not had (or even have-able) by all. (Recently Jensen (2015)\nhas offered a thorough defense of a derivationist account that aims to\ntake such worries into account.) Another way that Aquinas’s\naccount of knowledge of the fundamental goods has been understood\n— and it is an understanding better able to come to grips with\nthe widespread knowledge of fundamental goods — can be labeled\n‘inclinationism.’  On this view, one’s explicit\ngrasp of the fundamental goods follows upon but is not derived from\none’s persistent directedness toward the pursuit of certain\nends, which directedness involves an implicit grasp of these items as\ngood. So human beings exhibit a tendency to pursue life, and\nknowledge, and friendship, and so forth; and reflection on this\ntendency occasions an immediate grasp of the truth that life, and\nknowledge, and friendship, and so forth are goods. The affirmation of\nthe claims ‘life is good,’ ‘knowledge is\ngood,’ ‘friendship is good,’ etc. makes intelligible\nthe persistent pursuit of these ends by rational beings like us. \nWhile inclinationism and derivationism are distinct methods, they are\nby no means exclusive: one can hold that knowledge of fundamental\ngoods is possible in both ways. Indeed, it may well be that one way of\nknowing can supplement and correct the other. There may be some goods\nthat are easier to recognize when taking the speculative point of\nview, the point of view of the observer of human nature and its\npotentialities, and some that are easier to recognize when taking the\npractical point of view, the point of view of the actively engaged in\nhuman life. Indeed, by connecting nature and the human good so\ntightly, the natural law view requires that an account of the good\nreconcile these points of view. \nThere are, of course, reasons to be worried about both of these ways\nof knowing basic goods — worries that go beyond general\nskeptical doubts about how we could know any normative truths at\nall.  Derivationists have to explain how we come to know what\ncounts as an actualization of a human potency, and have to explain how\nwe connect these via bridge principles with human goods.\nInclinationists have their own troubles. In particular, they need to\ndeal with the fact that, even if they are not in the business of\nderiving goods from inclinations or identifying the goods precisely\nwith what we tend to pursue, they take as their starting point human\ndirectedness.   And it has been rightly noted that human\ndirectedness is not always a lovely thing. Power and prestige seem to\nbe a matter of human directedness — at least as much so as,\nsay,  aesthetic enjoyment and speculative knowledge — but\nthey do not make it to the natural law theorist’s catalog of\ngoods (though they do appear to be part of the good in\nAristotle’s picture; cf. the discussion in Hare 2001, p. 14).\nWhile these difficulties persist for inclinationist and derivationist\naccounts of knowledge of the basic goods, they may well be eased if\none affirms both accounts: one might be able to use inclinationist\nknowledge to provide some basis for bridge principles between\nknowledge of human nature and knowledge of human goods, and one might\nbe able to use derivationist knowledge to modify, in a non-ad-hoc way,\nthe objectionable elements of the account that one might be bound to\ngive if proceeding on an inclinationist basis alone. (Reconciling the\ninclinationist and derivationist approaches is a theme in Murphy 2001\nand Wall 2010.) \nThe dialectic between inclinationist and derivationist accounts of\nknowledge of the first principles of the natural law is central to\nnatural law epistemology, but there are other accounts of knowledge of\nthe natural law that focus on its social dimension. Alasdair MacIntyre\nhas argued, for example, that the first precepts of the natural law\nare to be understood as those that make possible communal inquiry into\nthe nature of the good: both the positive and the negative precepts\nare enabling rules, norms that enable humans to engage in common\npursuit of knowledge of what is valuable. The norms of the natural law\npreclude our acting toward other potential partners in inquiry in way\nthat would undermine the possibility of common pursuit of the good\n(MacIntyre 1994, 183–184). To come to know the primary precepts\nof the natural law, then, is a matter of coming to know what sorts of\nsocial relationships make possible common pursuit of common goods.\n \nA distinct sort of social emphasis on knowledge of the natural law\nasks why we should think of knowledge of the natural law as arising\nexclusively or even predominantly either from one’s own\nimmediate rational insight into what is implicit grasped or from some\nsort of derivation from the fact that one’s own inclinations of\nthe will have certain determinate objects. One might hold that we have\nexcellent reason to believe that knowledge of the natural law unfolds\nhistorically. Jean Porter, for example, argues that by close attention\nto the various sorts of social structure exhibited cross-culturally,\nwe can extract the necessary “starting points” (Porter\n2005, p.  132) to begin assessing various proposed norms of\naction. And Jonathan Crowe emphasizes knowledge of the natural law as\nthe outcome of the attempt to interpret human practices, and will be\nan historically-extended process that will be necessarily an\nunfinished task (Crowe 2019, pp. 6-7; there is also discussion of\ninterpretation of social practices as a means to knowing the natural\nlaw in Murphy 2007). \nA developed natural law theory includes within it a catalog of the\nfundamental goods, the basic values upon which the principles of right\nare founded. Suppose that we follow at least the inclinationist line,\ntaking it to be faithful to the natural law idea that knowledge of the\nbasic goods is widely distributed. Our task then is to provide an\nexplicit account of those goods implicit knowledge of which is\nmanifested in human inclination toward certain ends. What are the\ngoods affirmation of which makes intelligible these inclinations? \nIt is clear from this way of putting the question that even if natural\nlaw theorists are right that this implicit knowledge is widely\ndistributed, it would be easy for natural law theorists to disagree in\ntheir catalogs of basic goods. For the task here is that of\nformulating propositionally, and in as illuminating a way as possible,\nwhat items need be affirmed as intrinsically good in order to make\nsense out of our inclinations. And there are, unsurprisingly,\ndisagreements in catalogs of basic goods. The goods that Aquinas\nmentions in his account include life, procreation, social life,\nknowledge, and rational conduct. Grisez 1983 includes\nself-integration, practical reasonableness, authenticity, justice and\nfriendship, religion, life and health, knowledge of truth,\nappreciation of beauty, and playful activities (pp. 121–122).\nFinnis 1980 includes life, knowledge, aesthetic appreciation, play,\nfriendship, practical reasonableness, and religion (pp. 86–90).\nChappell 1995 includes friendship, aesthetic value, pleasure and the\navoidance of pain, physical and mental health and harmony, reason,\nrationality, and reasonableness, truth and the knowledge of it, the\nnatural world, people, fairness, and achievements (p. 43). Finnis 1996\naffirms a list much like Grisez 1983, but includes in it “the\nmarital good” (p. 5). Murphy 2001 includes life, knowledge,\naesthetic experience, excellence in work and play, excellence in\nagency, inner peace, friendship and community, religion, and happiness\n(p. 96). Gomez-Lobo 2002 includes life, the family, friendship, work\nand play, experience of beauty, theoretical knowledge, and integrity\n(pp. 10–23). Crowe (2019) includes life, health, pleasure,\nfriendship, play, appreciation, understanding, meaning, and\nreasonableness (p. 35). \nAside from the inevitable differences in lists of goods produced by\nnatural law theorists, there are also more focused debates about the\ninclusion of particular alleged goods within the natural law\ntheorists’ lists. Note, for example, that of the lists above,\nonly Chappell’s includes pleasure and the absence of pain.\nWhatever else we say here, it seems that common sense is initially on\nChappell’s side: what seems more obvious than that pleasure and\nthe avoidance of pain are basic reasons for action?  The reasons\nfor rejecting pleasure and the absence of pain from the list of goods\nare various: some writers argue, following Aristotle, that pleasure is\nnot a good in abstraction from the activity in which pleasure is\ntaken; some that the absence of pain is not a completion or a\nfulfillment of human nature, and thus cannot be among the basic goods;\nsome that the avoidance of pain is simply an instance of some other\nbasic good, such as inner peace. What this debate illustrates is the\nextent to which the formulation of a catalog of goods is not a\nstraightforward matter. Everyone agrees that one who avoids touching a\nhot stove in part to avoid the awful pain has some reason to\navoid touching the stove. The difficulty is to bring together our\nvarious sources of knowledge about the good to formulate an account\nthat explains well precisely why it is that such an act is reasonable.\nThese sorts of debates reappear with respect to goods like life (is\nlife intrinsically or instrumentally good?  is merely being alive\nintrinsically good, or is life only intrinsically good when one is\nenjoying a certain level of vitality?), religion (is harmony with God\nreally a human good?  is it merely a kind of friendship? \ndoes its status as a good depend on whether there is a being such as\nGod?), and what Finnis and Grisez now call the ‘marital\ngood’ (is the good of marriage simply an amalgam of various\nother goods, as friendship, procreation, rational agency, or is it\nreally a distinct, analytically separable value?). Thus\nEcheñique denies that life can be a basic good in the way that\nnatural law theorists typically take it to be (Echeñique 2016);\nCuneo has rejected religion as a basic good (Cuneo 2005, pp.\n116–118); and Macedo has argued against the marital good (Macedo\n1995). \nSuppose that we were to have in hand satisfactory accounts of natural\ngoodness and our knowledge of it, along with a rationally defensible\naccount of the basic goods that are the fundamental reasons for\naction. All that we would have so far is the natural law\ntheorist’s account of what we might call minimally rational\naction — action that seeks to realize some good. What we would\nnot have yet is a full account of right action. For we are frequently\nin situations in which there are various different courses of action\nthat we might pursue, each of which promises to realize some good; are\nthere no guidelines to which we might appeal in order to show some of\nthese choices superior to others?  After all, some of even the\nmost obviously morally wrong actions can be seen to promise some good\n— a robber might kill in order to get the money he needs to\npursue genuine goods — and the natural law theorist wants to be\nable to say why these obviously morally wrong actions are morally\nwrong. As we have seen, the paradigmatic natural law view holds that\nthere are some general rules of right that govern our pursuit of the\nvarious goods, and that these rules of right exclude those actions\nthat are in some way defective responses to the various basic\ngoods. How, though, are we to determine what counts as a defective\nresponse to the goods? \nThere are at least three possibilities. One might appeal to a master\nrule of right that can be used to generate further rules; call this\nthe master rule approach. One might appeal to a\nmethodological principle by which particular rules can be generated;\ncall this the method approach. Or one might appeal to some\nstandard for distinguishing correct and incorrect moral rules that is\nnot understandable as a method; call this (for reasons we shall see\nshortly) the virtue approach. \nOn the master rule approach, the task of the natural law theorist is\nto identify some master rule which bears on the basic goods and,\nperhaps in conjunction with further factual premises, is able to\nproduce a stock of general rules about what sorts of responses to the\nbasic goods are or are not reasonable. While it is far from clear\nwhether there was a single way that Aquinas proceeded in establishing\nmoral norms from the primary precepts of the natural law in the\nSumma Theologiae, John Finnis has argued (Finnis 1998, p.\n126) that Aquinas employed this master rule approach: on his view,\nAquinas held that this master rule is the rule of universal love, that\none should love one’s neighbor as oneself. This rule bids us to\nrespond to the good lovingly wherever it can be realized, and from it\nwe can see that certain ways of responding to the good are ruled out\nas essentially unloving. Grisez clearly employs this approach: he\nwrites that the first principle of morality is that “In\nvoluntarily acting for human goods and avoiding what is opposed to\nthem, one ought to choose and otherwise will those and only those\npossibilities whose willing is compatible with a will toward integral\nhuman fulfillment” (Grisez 1983, p. 184). This first principle,\nGrisez says, contains implicitly within it various “modes of\nresponsibility” from which particular moral rules can be\nderived. \nThe central difficulty with this employment of the master rule\napproach is that of explaining how we are to grasp this first\nprinciple of morality as correct. What is the relationship between our\nknowledge of the basic goods and our knowledge of the master\nrule?  When Grisez defends his master rule, he writes that its\nstatus is due to a certain function that a first principle of morality\nmust perform:  “It must provide the basis for guiding\nchoices toward overall human fulfillment. As a single principle, it\nwill give unity and direction to a morally good life. At the same\ntime, it must not exclude ways of living which might contribute to a\ncomplete human community” (Grisez 1983, p. 184). But this\npresupposes an awful lot: why should we assume in advance that a\nproper response to the basic goods must be one that is oriented toward\na “complete human community”? \nOn the method approach, by contrast, there is no need for a master\nprinciple that will serve as the basis for deriving some particular\nmoral rules. The idea here is the natural law theorist needs not a\nmaster rule but a test for distinguishing correct moral rules from\nincorrect ones. We know from our earlier consideration of the\nparadigmatic natural law view that the test for distinguishing correct\nmoral rules from incorrect ones must be something like the following:\nif a moral rule rules out certain choices as defective that are in\nfact defective, and rules out no choices as defective that are not in\nfact defective, then it is a correct moral rule. What would\ndistinguish different employments of the method approach is their\naccounts of what features of a choice we appeal to in order to\ndetermine whether it is defective. The knowledge that we have to go on\nhere is our knowledge of the basic goods. If a certain choice\npresupposes something false about the basic goods, then it responds\ndefectively to them. So a moral rule can be justified by showing that\nit rules out only choices that presuppose something false about the\nbasic goods. \nThis is very abstract. Here is an example of an employment of this\napproach. While Finnis now affirms Grisez’s master rule\napproach, in his 1980 work he defends various principles of practical\nreasonableness without adverting to a master rule. He argues, for\nexample, that it is always wrong to intend the destruction of an\ninstance of a basic good (Finnis 1980, pp. 118–123). (So, no\nlying, for lying is an intentional attack on knowledge; no murder, for\nmurder is an intentional attack on life, and so forth.)  Why is\nit always wrong to do so?  It would be unreasonable simply to try\nto destroy an instance of a basic good, for no further purpose: for\nthat would treat an instance of a basic good as something that it is\nnot — that is, as valueless. And it would be wrong to destroy an\ninstance of a basic good for the sake of bringing about some other\ninstance of a basic good: for that would make sense only if the good\nbrought about were more valuable than the good destroyed, but on\nFinnis’s view all distinct instances of basic goods are\nincommensurable — none is of more, less, or equal value with any\nother. So the rule forbidding intentional destruction of an instance\nof a basic good is justified because it rules out only choices that\npresuppose something false about the nature of the basic goods. (For a\nworking out of the method approach, see Murphy 2001, ch. 5.) \nThe method approach presupposes less of substance about morality than\nthe master rule approach presupposes. But it requires us to draw upon\nan interesting and rich knowledge of the features of the basic goods.\nWhether this information is available is a matter for debate. But the\nmethod approach has the advantage of firmly rooting natural law\narguments for moral principles in the goods the pursuit of which those\nmoral principles are supposed to regulate. \nNeither the master rule nor the method approach implies that the\nnatural law theorist must hold that all right action can be captured\nin general rules. The natural law view is only that there are some\nsuch rules. It is consistent with the natural law position that there\nare a number of choice situations in which there is a right answer,\nyet in which that right answer is not dictated by any natural law rule\nor set of rules, but rather is grasped only by a virtuous, practically\nwise person. It is, however, open to the natural law theorist to use\nthis appeal to the judgment of the practically wise person more\nwidely, holding that the general rules concerning the appropriate\nresponse to the goods cannot be properly determined by any master rule\nor philosophical method, but can be determined only by appeal to the\ninsight of the person of practical wisdom. If it really is wrong in\nall cases to tell lies, as Aquinas and Grisez and Finnis have argued,\nour grasp of this moral truth is dependent on our possessing, or our\nbeing able to recognize the possessor of, practical wisdom. If such a\nperson never tells lies, because she or he just sees that to tell lies\nwould be to respond defectively to the good, then that lying is always\nwrong is a rule of the natural law. \nIt may be true that by the virtue approach we can learn of some\ngeneral rules of the natural law. What is more interesting is whether\na defender of the virtue approach would be right to dismiss the claims\nof the master rule or method approaches. (For, after all, one might be\nable to learn that lying is wrong either through moral\nargument or through the perceptive insight of practical wisdom.) \nAnd it does not seem that the defender of the master rule or method\napproach should be particularly concerned to discredit the virtue\napproach. For if defenders of the master rule or method approach\nrecognize the existence of a capacity of judgment like practical\nwisdom, then it would be strange to allow that it can be correctly\nexercised on a number of particular occasions while denying that we\nmight learn of general rules from observing patterns of its exercise\non various occasions. \nOne challenge to these various natural law attempts to explain the\nright in terms of the good denies that the natural law theorist can\nprovide adequate explanations of the range of norms of right conduct\nfor which moral theories ought to be able to provide explanations.\nThat is, one might allow for the sake of argument the natural law\ntheorist’s identification of some range of human goods, while\ndenying that he or she can identify, and justify in natural law terms,\nadequately concrete modes of appropriate response to those goods. This\nchallenge cannot be profitably addressed here; what would be required\nwould be a close examination of the merits of particular natural law\nexplanations of particular moral norms (a task taken up in, for\nexample, Grisez 1993). One might also look to recent attempts to apply\nthe natural law view to pressing contemporary moral problems —\nthose of research ethics (Tollefsen 2008), economic justice (Chartier\n2009), environmental ethics (Davison 2009), business ethics (Gonzalez\n2015), the ethics of suicide and euthanasia (Paterson 2015), and\npopulation ethics (Delaney 2016), for example — as tests of the\nfruitfulness of that position. \nA more radical critique of the paradigmatic natural law account of the\nconnection between the good and the right calls into question the very\nidea that one can get principles of moral rightness merely from what\nconstitutes a defective response to the good. According to this\ncritique, while it is true that one might be able to come up with some\nnotion of unreasonableness by appeal to the notion of what is\ndefective response to the human goods, the notion of moral rightness\nbelongs to a family of concepts distinct from that to which the notion\nof reasonableness belongs. On this view, moral rightness belongs to\nthe obligation family, and the concept of obligation is\nirreducibly social: one is under an obligation only if one is\nsubject to some sort of demand in the context of a social relationship\n(see, for an example of this view from a theological voluntarist\nperspective, Adams 1999, pp. 238–241; see, for an example of\nthis view with a Kantian twist, Darwall 2006). It is part of the logic\nof obligation that when one is under an obligation, that condition has\nresulted from a demand imposed on him or her by some other party. So,\naccording to this line of criticism, the paradigmatic natural law view\nis unable to show that the natural law is intrinsically morally\nauthoritative: the precepts of the natural law can be rules that all\nof us human beings are obligated to obey, that it would be\nwrong for us to disobey, and that we would be guilty\nfor flouting only if these precepts are imposed upon us by an\nauthoritative being — perhaps a being like God. \nThe intrinsic moral authority of the natural law has been a matter of\ndebate since Aquinas: it was a central issue dividing Aquinas’s\nview from those of Scotus, Ockham, and Suarez. It continues to be an\nissue between natural law theorists like Grisez (1983) and Finnis\n(1980) on one hand and theological voluntarists like Adams (1999) and\nHare (2001) on the other. Natural law theorists have several options:\nthey can argue against any meaningful distinction between morality and\nthe reasonable more generally (Foot 2000, pp. 66–80); or they\ncan embrace the distinction, but hold that on the clearest conception\nof the moral that we possess, the natural law account of\nreasonableness in action adequately satisfies that conception (Murphy\n2001, pp. 222–227); or they can hold that the notion of\n‘morally right’ is so muddled that it should be\njettisoned, leaving in its stead the notion of the reasonable (cf.\nAnscombe 1958). It is at present far from clear which of these avenues\nof response the natural law theorist has most reason to embrace.","contact.mail":"murphym@georgetown.edu","contact.domain":"georgetown.edu"}]
