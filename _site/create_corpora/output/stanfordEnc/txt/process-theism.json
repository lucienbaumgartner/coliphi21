For both Whitehead and\nHartshorne, it is an essential attribute of God to be fully involved\nin and affected by temporal processes. This idea contrasts neatly with\ntraditional forms of theism that hold God to be or at least conceived\nas being, in all respects non-temporal (eternal), unchanging\n(immutable,) and unaffected by the world (impassible). Process theism\ndoes not deny that God is in some respects eternal,\nimmutable, and impassible, but it contradicts the classical view by\ninsisting that God is in some respects temporal, mutable, and\npassible. The views of Whitehead and Hartshorne should also be\ndistinguished from those that affirm that the divine being, by an act\nof self-limitation, opens itself to influence from the world. Some\nneo-Thomists hold this view and a group of Evangelical Christian\nphilosophers, calling themselves “open theists,” promote\nsimilar ideas. These forms of theism were influenced by process\ntheism, but they deny its claim that God is\nessentially in a give-and-take relationship with the world.\nMoreover, process theism is a genuinely philosophical\ntheology in the sense that it is not grounded in claims of special\ninsight or revealed truth but in philosophical\nreflection. Specifically, process theism is a product of theorizing\nthat takes the categories of becoming, change, and time as\nfoundational for metaphysics. The metaphysical underpinning of process\ntheism is often called process philosophy, a label suggested by the\ntitle of Whitehead’s magnum opus,\nProcess and Reality. In order to bring out this philosophy’s\nemphasis on relatedness, many scholars follow Bernard Loomer in calling\nit process-relational philosophy. Whitehead’s preferred expression for\nhis metaphysical viewpoint is “the philosophy of organism.”\nThis article concerns primarily the concept of God in process theism,\nalthough we shall conclude with a brief discussion of arguments for the\nexistence of God in process thought.\n\n\n\nAlthough Whitehead was Hartshorne’s senior by thirty-six years,\nthe two men began seriously to develop their ideas about God in\nwritten form at roughly the same time. In his Harvard doctoral\ndissertation (1923), Hartshorne argues for the existence of a God that\nis the eminent exemplification of relational and social\nvalues. Whitehead’s writings on the concept of God appear only\nafter 1924, when he moved to America. Between the publication\nof Science and the Modern World (1925) and Process and\nReality (1929)—a time of intense creativity for\nWhitehead—he articulated his metaphysical system, including the\nconcept of God. During Whitehead’s first year at Harvard,\nHartshorne was in Europe for his second year as a Sheldon Traveling\nFellow. When he returned to Harvard in 1925 he was given the dual\nassignment of editing the papers of Charles Sanders Peirce and of\nserving as Whitehead’s assistant. After 1940 Hartshorne became\nthe primary conduit for Whitehead’s theistic ideas. Indeed, the\nelaboration and defense of process theism fell largely to Hartshorne\nand his students at the University of Chicago (1928–1955), Emory\nUniversity (1955–1962), and the University of Texas at Austin\n(1962–2000). So great was Hartshorne’s influence that some\nscholars try to rescue Whitehead from a too Hartshornean\ninterpretation. This fact should serve as a warning that\nHartshorne’s version of process theism is not the same as\nWhitehead’s. We shall see that Hartshorne’s treatment of\ntheism owes much to Whitehead’s metaphysics while departing from\nit in ways that the Englishman would not accept. \n\nHartshorne accepted the task of chronicling process theism’s history\nand showing its importance as a significant alternative to classical\ntheism, pantheism, atheism, and other lesser known options in\nphilosophical theology. His 1953 anthology (republished in 2000),\nPhilosophers Speak of God, edited with the help of his student\nWilliam L. Reese, is a massive critical study of the varieties of\nconcepts of God as they relate to process theism. The book includes\nselections from and commentaries on a wide range of thinkers from\nWestern and Eastern traditions, both well-known and obscure. It is safe\nto say that Hartshorne’s vigorous efforts on behalf of process theism\nare the single most important factor in eroding the consensus among\nphilosophers that an eternal, immutable, and impassible deity should be\nconsidered normative for philosophical theology. \n\nPhilosophers Speak of God demonstrates that Whitehead and\nHartshorne are not the sole representatives of process theism,\nalthough they are its chief exponents. Buddhism, with its twin\nemphases on impermanence and dependent origination, is arguably the\nmost sophisticated ancient form of process philosophy. Buddhist\nphilosophers criticized the notion of a timeless absolute without,\nhowever, developing a form of process theism (e.g. Arnold 1998). Whitehead remarks that\nhis concept of God has more richness than the Buddhist concept of\nnirvana and that his philosophy of religion could be viewed as an\neffort to “true up” the Buddhist idea (Johnson 1983,\n8). Hartshorne maintains that aspects of process theism are in Plato’s\nlater writings—specifically, the Sophist,\nthe Timaeus, and the\nLaws—but they are never brought together into a\ncoherent theory. Hartshorne sees process theism as providing the needed\ncoherence (Dombrowski 2005 and Viney 2007). \n\nIn the generation immediately preceding Whitehead, C. S. Peirce\n(1839–1914) and William James (1842–1910) closely\nanticipated process theism and served as important influences on its\ndevelopment. There was also a cross fertilization of ideas from some\nof Whitehead’s contemporaries: Henri Bergson (1859–1941),\nSamuel Alexander (1859–1938), and William Ernest Hocking\n(1873–1966)—Hocking was one of Hartshorne’s teachers\nat Harvard. Philosophers and religious thinkers who independently\nformulated aspects of process theism in the twentieth century include:\nBernardino Varisco (1850–1933), Nicholas Berdyaev\n(1874–1948), Mohammad Iqbal (1877–1938), Martin Buber\n(1878–1965), Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955), Edgar\nSheffield Brightman (1884–1953), Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan\n(1888–1975), Sri Aurobindo (1892–1950), Hans Jonas\n(1903–1993), and Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907–1972). \n\nBecause process theists reject the idea of a deity whose moral\ncharacter is ever questionable, John Stuart Mill’s essay,\n“Theism,” is not an anticipation of process\ntheism. By parity of reasoning, Peter Forrest’s proposal of a God that\ngrows from pure power to pure love is not a version of theism that\nprocess theists would find appealing (Forrest 2007). Some of the\ncentral themes and arguments of process theism, however, are evident\nin less well-known thinkers scattered throughout history. One can\nmention the names of Levi ben Gerson (1288–1340), Fausto Socinus\n(1539–1604), Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling (1775–1854),\nGustav Theodor Fechner (1801–1887), Rowland Gibson Hazard\n(1801–1888), Jules Lequyer [or Lequier] (1814–1862),\nLorenzo D. McCabe (1817–1897), and Otto Pfleiderer\n(1839–1908). Some might count G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)\nas a forerunner of process theism, but his case is not clear. The idea\nof development is central to Hegel’s thinking about the Absolute\nSpirit.  On the other hand, his philosophy was more influential in\nushering in what he himself called “the death of God” than\nin providing a clearly articulated theistic alternative to\nclassical theism (cf. Küng 1980, 138–42). It is also ironic\nthat it was much less in the positive influence of Hegelian idealism\nthan in the negative reactions to it that process philosophy, and by\nimplication process theism, matured in the twentieth century. \n\nPhilosophers and theologians who have published a monograph defending\nsome variety of process theism informed by Whitehead or Hartshorne\ninclude: Henry Nelson Wieman (1884–1975), Bernard Meland\n(1899–1993), Paul Weiss (1901–2002), Norman Pittenger\n(1905–1997), Daniel Day Williams (1910–1973), John Moskop,\nWilliam L.  Reese, John B. Cobb, Jr., Schubert Ogden, Edgar A. Towne,\nEugene H. Peters (1929–1983), Bowman Clarke (1927–1996),\nJoseph Bracken, Burton Z. Cooper, Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki, Gene\nA.

Keller, Jorge Luis Nobo,\nTyron Inbody, Carol P. Christ, George L. Goodwin, Barry Whitney,\nSantiago Sia, Jay McDaniel, George W. Shields, Donald Viney, Daniel\nA. Dombrowski, Anna Case-Winters, Kurian Kachappilly, Gregory A. Boyd,\nRoland Faber, Thomas Jay Oord, Donna Bowman, Derek Malone-France, and\nJulia Enxing; Williams, Reese, Cobb, Ogden, and Peters were\nHartshorne’s students at Chicago; Clarke and Edwards studied with him\nat Emory; Nobo was Hartshorne’s student at Texas. \n\nThe question of the metaphysical relation of God and creativity is a\nwatershed between process theism and more traditional forms of theism.\nProcess philosophy, modifying a statement from Plato’s Sophist\n(247e), affirms that the most concrete real beings—in\nWhitehead’s language, actual entities—are characterized by the\npower to act and to be acted upon (Plato says real beings act\nor are acted upon). In process metaphysics no actual entity is\nwholly determined by the activity of another; or phrased positively,\nevery actual entity retains some power of self-determination,\nhowever minimal or slight it may be. According to this view, to have\npower in relation to others is to have power in relation to other\nentities with some degree of power. This is process philosophy’s\ndoctrine of universal creativity. Hartshorne says, “To be is to\ncreate” (Hartshorne 1970, 1, 272). The logic of the matter does\nnot change if God is included in the metaphysical scheme. For process\ntheism, God is the supreme or eminent creative power, but not the only\ncreative power. Thus, process theists speak of God and the creatures as\nco-creators (Hartshorne and Reese 2000, 140; Hartshorne 1967a, 113). \n\nProcess theism’s doctrine of creativity differs from that of\nclassical theism according to which God alone is genuinely creative.\nThomas Aquinas says that in the proper sense of the word, only God\ncreates (Summa Theologica I, Q 45, a. 5). Aquinas explains\nthat to create is to bring something from nothing, and this is possible\nonly for deity. This is the famous doctrine of creatio ex\nnihilo, or creation from no pre-existing material. This ex\nnihilo creation is logically distinct from the claim that the\nuniverse is temporally finite. Aquinas, for example, treats the\nquestions whether God is the creator and whether the universe had a\nbeginning under separate headings. Aquinas is clear that he accepts the\ntemporal finitude of the universe as a matter of faith, from\nrevelation, and not because of rational argument. On the other hand,\nlike other traditional theists (Gottfried Leibniz for example), Aquinas\nholds that God could have created a temporally infinite universe, but\nit too would have been created ex nihilo. \n\nProcess theists generally, though not unanimously, deny that the\nuniverse had a first temporal moment. Those wishing to demonstrate the\ncompatibility between process theism and Jewish and Christian\nScripture commonly follow David Griffin’s arguments that the Bible\nneither requires nor implies an absolute beginning of the universe\n(Griffin 2001b, 109–114). There is still the objection, however,\nthat by conceiving both God and the creatures as creative, process\ntheists seem to destroy one of the most meaningful contrasts between\nGod and the world: God as creator and the world as created. Indeed,\nWhitehead says, “It is as true to say that God creates the\nWorld, as that the World creates God” (Whitehead 1978, 348). One\nmust, however, separate Whitehead’s poetic expression from his\nphilosophical meaning.  In process theism, as in traditional theism,\nthe existence of God is in no way precarious, in no way\ndependent upon the activity of other entities; likewise, process\ntheism and traditional theism are in agreement that non-divine\nindividuals are contingent (they can fail to exist)—in the case\nof non-angelic beings, they are born and they die. In Whitehead’s and\nHartshorne’s form of theism, God’s existence is everlasting, but the\nexistence of any particular creature is not. Nevertheless, the\ncreatures, being lesser creators, create something in God, if only the\nknowledge of their own activity. For process theism, the activity of\nthe creatures makes no difference to God’s existence, only to God’s\nexperience of them. \n\nImplicit in traditional theism’s doctrine of creation are the ideas\nthat God’s creative act and God’s knowledge of the world are\nnon-temporal. Augustine, for example, in the Confessions\n(book XI, chapters 13 and 14), considers it nonsensical to ask what\nGod was doing before the creation of the world; God, in creating the\nuniverse, brings time—and with it, relations of before and\nafter—into existence; thus, it is no more meaningful to ask what\ncame\nbefore the first moment of time than it is to ask what is\nnorth of the north pole. In traditional theism, the temporal world is\nspread out before God who can see it in its entirety from an eternal\nvantage point, like an observer on a hill viewing travelers in a\ncaravan. As Boethius says in The Consolation of Philosophy\n(book 5, prose 6), eternity is the complete, simultaneous and perfect\npossession of everlasting life. Process theism takes a contrary view\nthat time is the process of creation. In other words, the\norder of beings in time is the process whereby beings are created. For\nprocess metaphysics, there is no eternal act of divine creation that\nfixes the world in existence and there is no eternal perspective from\nwhich the universe can be considered a finished product. Furthermore,\nthe “creative advance,” as Whitehead calls the universe,\nis inherently open-ended and growing, like a line to which tiny\nsegments are continually being added. Where Aquinas could liken God’s\nprescience to a man viewing a caravan of travelers from a high tower,\nHartshorne says, “There is not (either now or eternally) a fixed\ntotality of travelers for God to survey, but a new totality each\nmoment” (Hartshorne 1970, 135). \n\nWhitehead remarks that, “In all philosophic theory there is an\nultimate which is actual in virtue of its accidents” (Whitehead\n1978, 7). In process thought, this ultimate is creativity. It would be\nmisleading, however, to speak as though creativity were “the\nultimate reality” according to process theism (Hick 1990, 49).\nCreativity is not a metaphysical agency that produces anything;\nrather, it is the character of every concrete fact, from the humblest\nflicker of existence in non-divine actual entities to God. Whitehead’s\npithy summary of process philosophy is, “The many become one,\nand are increased by one” (Whitehead 1978, 21). Creativity,\nthen, is the ultimate metaphysical principle. A principle, however, is\nnot a real being. Whitehead explained to his student A. H. Johnson\nthat God is not a principle but an actuality (Johnson 1983, 5). That\nwhich is best described, in process theism, as the ultimate reality,\nis God. For Whitehead and Hartshorne, God should not be treated as the\nexception to metaphysical principles; otherwise, there can be no\nreasoned discourse about the divine (that is, no theology). Whitehead\nand Hartshorne strive to conceive God as the chief exemplification of\nmetaphysical principles. In process theism, the divine or eminent form\nof creativity provides the basis for cosmic order and achieved\nvalue. In Whitehead’s words, God is “the poet of the\nworld,” leading it with tender patience by the divine vision of\ntruth, beauty, and goodness (Whitehead 1978, 346). \n\nProcess theism is critical of the traditional metaphysical question,\n“Why is there something rather than nothing?” In process\nthought, the proposition, “Something exists,” is a\nnecessary truth (Hartshorne 1971). Insofar as traditional theism\nmaintains the doctrine of the necessary existence of God, it too\naccepts the necessity of something existing. Therefore, the difference\nbetween process theism and traditional theism is not in whether\nsomething necessarily exists, but in the nature of the\nnecessarily existent. According to traditional theism, the\ntotality of non-divine entities is a multiplicity in need of\ngrounding in a primordial unifying activity—the “pure\nact” (actus purus) of existing that is God.\nProcess theism refuses to give a privileged metaphysical status to the\none over the many. In Whitehead’s words, “The term\n‘many’ presupposes the term ‘one,’ and the term\n‘one’ presupposes the term ‘many’”\n(Whitehead 1978, 21). Taking creativity as the category of the ultimate\nis an attempt to keep the one and the many on equal metaphysical\nfooting by taking reality itself as necessarily social. God, considered\nas the ultimate reality in any version of process metaphysics,\nnecessarily exists as a social being in dynamic interaction with all\nnon-divine entities. \n\nClearly, treating creativity as the ultimate metaphysical principle\nhas far-reaching consequences for the concept of God and of God’s\nrelations to others. It is not possible, in process metaphysics, to\nconceive divine activity as a “supernatural” intervention\ninto the “natural” order of events. Process theists usually\nregard the distinction between the supernatural and the natural as a\nby-product of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. In process\nthought, there is no such thing as a realm of the natural in contrast\nto that which is supernatural. On the other hand, if “the\nnatural” is defined more neutrally as “what is in the\nnature of things,” then process metaphysics characterizes the\nnatural as the creative activity of actual entities. In Whitehead’s\nwords, “It lies in the nature of things that the many enter into\ncomplex unity” (Whitehead 1978, 21). It is tempting to emphasize\nprocess theism’s denial of the supernatural and thereby highlight what\nthe process God cannot do in comparison to what the traditional God can\ndo (that is, to bring something from nothing). In fairness, however,\nequal stress should be placed on process theism’s denial of the natural\n(as traditionally conceived) so that one may highlight what the\ncreatures cannot do, in traditional theism, in comparison to what they\ncan do in process metaphysics (that is, to be part creators of the\nworld with God). \n\nProcess theists generally regard the notion of creation ex\nnihilo, as explained above, as going hand-in-hand with the idea\nthat the relations between God and the world are one-way relations. God\ncreates, but the creatures lack all creative power, the one wholly\nuncreated, the other wholly uncreative (Hartshorne 1970, 9). It is not\nwithin the ability of any creature, according to this view, to make a\ndifference to God. Aquinas’s way of expressing this asymmetry is to say\nthat the relation from God to the creatures is real (for it makes a\ndifference, all the difference, to them) whereas the relation from the\ncreatures to God is rational, or in the mind only (for the existence of\nthe creatures makes no difference to the being of God) (Summa\nTheologica I, Q 13, a. 7). Aquinas borrows, and places in a\nChristian context, Aristotle’s terms of “pure act” and\n“unmoved mover” to apply to God. To say that God is pure\nact is to say that anything God could be, God already is—there\nis no potentiality in God for any type of change. To say that God is\nthe unmoved mover is to say that the divine moves others but is unmoved\nby another—this includes the idea that God is impassible,\nliterally, without feeling or emotion. \n\nIn the view of process theism, the denial of real relations in God\nrenders classical theism paradoxical to the point of incoherence.\nAccording to classical theism, God has perfect knowledge of a\ncontingent and changing world, yet nothing in God could be other than\nit is. The one condition, however, contradicts the other (cf.\nHartshorne 1948, 13–14; Shields 1983; Viney 2013). If any event is\ncontingent then it could be otherwise—for example, this bird\nat this place and time is singing rather than sleeping; but if the\nevent could be otherwise, then God’s knowledge of the event could be\notherwise—knowing this bird at this place and time as singing\nrather than as sleeping. The contingency implied for God’s knowing is\nnot that God might have been ignorant of something but that the thing\nthat God knows might have been different. An infallible knower\nnecessarily knows whatever exists; it does not follow, however, that\nwhat exists is necessary unless one adds the premise, taken\nfrom classical theism, that nothing in God could be other than it\nis. Process theism jettisons the premise that there is nothing\ncontingent in God. The only other non-atheistic alternatives, say\nprocess theists, are to follow Aristotle and deny that God knows the\nworld or to follow Spinoza and deny that nothing in God or in the\nworld could be other than it is (Hartshorne 1976, 12). What is\nimpossible is a God with no contingent aspects knowing a contingent\nworld. \n\nThe denial of real relations in God also has\nparadoxical consequences for the concept of divine goodness. If God is\nunaffected by the creatures, then God is impassible, not moved by\ntheir suffering. Anselm, in Proslogion chapter VIII, asks how\nGod can be compassionate towards the creatures without feeling\nsympathy for them. His answer—in effect a kind of theological\nbehaviorism (Dombrowski 2006, 140)—is that the creatures feel\nthe effects of divine compassion but that God feels nothing. This\nleaves unanswered how non-sympathetic compassion is possible. Aquinas\nprovides a less obviously question begging reply. He says that to love\nanother is to will the good of the other; God necessarily wills the\ngood of the other, so God is love (Summa Theologica I, Q 20,\na. 2).  Process theists do not deny that love requires willing the\ngood of the other, but they maintain that it requires something more,\nor at very least that there are greater forms of love of which willing\nthe good of the other is a necessary aspect. Divine love is more than\nbeneficence; it includes sensitivity to the joys and sorrows of the\nbeloved. This idea is expressed in Whitehead’s depiction of God as\n“the great companion—the fellow-sufferer who\nunderstands” (Whitehead 1978, 351). Hartshorne points out that\nAnselm’s God can give us “everything except the right to believe\nthat there is one who, with infinitely subtle and appropriate\nsensitivity, rejoices in all our joys and sorrows in all our\nsorrows” (Hartshorne 1948, 54). \n\nClosely related to the problem of passionless love, for classical\ntheism, is the question of the world’s value. The denial of real\nrelations in God, coupled with the concept that the world and its\ncreatures have no value except as it is borrowed from God, implies that\nthat total reality described by God-and-the-world contains no\nmore value than that described by God-without-the-world. This\nview has two unhappy consequences. First, it implies that there is no\nvalue in God’s creating the world—nothing is gained, or lost,\nin God’s decision to create. Second, it implies that there is no value\nin God’s interaction with the creatures. Process theists point out that\nthese ideas do not square with analogies drawn from human experience.\nThere is value in giving one’s love to another, as for instance,\nbringing children into the world and loving them; there is also value\nin one’s love being received and returned, as when the children mature\nand cherish relations with their parents. Yet, one cannot love another\nunless the other exists, or once existed. Thus, if there is a value in\nlove, it requires the existence of the other, not merely\nthe idea of the existence of the other. Process theism rejects\nthe counter-intuitive claim that the world as actually existing has no\nmore value than the world as possibly existing. By parity of reasoning,\nprocess theism rejects the view that it is no better for God to create\nthe world than to contemplate the possibility of creating it. \n\nPerhaps the most disastrous consequences of the denial of real\nrelations in God, as far as process theists are concerned, are the\nproblems that it poses for free will and creaturely suffering. The\ncreative or causal relation flows one way only, from God\nto the world. The world and its creatures are products of a\nunilateral divine decision that things should be one way rather than\nanother. Hartshorne poses a dilemma for this view. Either biological\nparents are part creators of their children or they are not. If they\nare then God alone is not the creator. On the other hand, if parents\nare not genuine creators of their children then the creatures never\ncreate anything and we don’t know what “create” means, for\nparents having children would seem to be a paradigm of\ncreation—note the word “procreative” (cf. Hartshorne\n1987, 88–89).  Classical theists accept precisely the implication that\nHartshorne finds absurd, namely, that the creatures never create\nanything. The Thomist, for example, holds that one’s parents are not\ncreative; they are the vehicles whereby matter-energy is rearranged so\nas to form (not to create) a new human being. Strictly speaking, for\nAquinas, what God creates is your-parents-having-you. Your\nparents had no part in your creation. \n\nAquinas’s theory poses complications for human freedom. The reality\ndescribed by your-parents-having-you includes the decisions\nthey make in having you. God, in creating that reality, also creates\nthose decisions. Aquinas says that God’s will is perfectly\nefficacious—that is, what God wills comes to pass. Therefore,\nyour parents’ decisions in your-parents-having-you must\noccur. Would this view of decision making jeopardize human freedom?\nAquinas, representing classical theism, says no, but Hartshorne,\nrepresenting process theism, says yes. In Aquinas’s view, one’s free\ndecisions have two sufficient explanations, one’s own will\nand God’s will. In other words, God brings it about not\nonly that one freely decides something, but what one\nfreely decides (Summa Theologica I, Q 19, a. 8). Process\ntheists counter that multiple freedom (whether between God and the\ncreatures or among the creatures) implies the possibility of wills\ncoming into conflict or being in harmony. Hartshorne says, “Risk\nand opportunity go together, not because God chooses to have it so,\nbut because opportunity without risk is meaningless or\ncontradictory” (Hartshorne 1970, 238). If this is true, then it\nmust be possible for the will of the creatures to be at cross purposes\nwith the divine will. We have already seen that classical theists and\nprocess theists agree that God wills the good of the creatures. Human\nbeings, however, do not always will their own good, or the good of\nother people. In those cases, on the classical view, God brings it\nabout that people freely decide not to will the good of\nothers. Process theists argue that this makes God responsible for evil\nand suffering in a way that contradicts divine goodness. On the\nclassical view, for example, the crimes that disfigure human history\nare the fault of human beings, but they are also God’s doing. \n\nClassical theists are not without responses to these criticisms. One\nwell-known reply, used by Augustine and Aquinas, is to invoke the\ndistinction between divine permission and divine causation of human\nwickedness and suffering. On this view, the evil in the world is\npermitted by God in order to bring about a greater good. For example,\nthe Exultet of the Easter Vigil, sometimes ascribed to Ambrose of\nMilan, speaks of the sin of Adam and Eve as a blessed fault (O\nfelix culpa!) that made possible the sacrificial death of Christ.\nProcess theists argue that there can be no distinction between\npermitting and causing in a being that creates the universe ex\nnihilo. On the principles of classical theism, whatever is\ndivinely “permitted” is also divinely created to be as it\nis (cf. Griffin 1976, 63–64 and 82–83)—this is one\nof the few points on which process theism agrees with John Calvin\n(Case-Winters, 1990, 71). On the process view, creaturely decisions\nare themselves acts of creation, which means that the universe is a\njoint product of God and the creatures. Process theists do not see\nhow, in creation ex nihilo, creaturely decisions that God\npermits are not orchestrated by God so as to fulfill the purposes God\nhas for them.  Albert Einstein is reported to have said that God does\nnot play dice with the universe. Although he was not a classical\ntheist, his view on this issue is in accord with that philosophy. God\nmay, as it were, allow or permit the dice to fall where they may, but\nonly if they fall as God desires them to fall; this seems different in\nname only from playing with loaded dice. Hartshorne replies,\n“Einstein’s rejection of a ‘dice-throwing God’\nwas a great man’s error. And human individuals are some of the dice\n…” (Hartshorne 1967a, 113). \n\nThe dominant theological position in the West, which we have been\nreferring to as classical theism, denies all relativity to God. One\nmight suppose that the Christian doctrines of the Trinity and the\nIncarnation of God in Christ would temper disbelief in divine\nrelativity. The trend, however, was to argue that these doctrines do\nnot conflict with the denial of real relations in God. Claims of\nrevealed truth aside, the core doctrine has been that God, to be God,\nmust be in all respects absolute and in no respects relative. As goes\nthe contrast between absolute and relative, so go other metaphysical\ncontrasts. Theists traditionally held that God is in all\nrespects creator, active, infinite, eternal, necessary,\nindependent, immutable, and impassible and in no respects\ncreated, passive, finite, temporal, contingent, dependent, mutable, or\npassible. This view can be interpreted either as a doctrine about the\nnature of God or as a thesis about the parameters of responsible\ndiscourse about God (in the latter case it is called the via\nnegativa, or negative path). Hartshorne complains that, on\neither interpretation, traditional theology is guilty of a\n“monopolar prejudice,” placing God (or talk about God) on\none side of polar contrasts and the world on the other. It is\nmonopolar insofar as deity is characterized by only one side\nof each pair of contrasts; it is prejudicial insofar as it\nholds to the invidious nature of the contrasts. As Hartshorne notes,\n“One pole of each contrary is regarded as more excellent than the\nother, so that the supremely excellent being cannot be described by the\nother and inferior pole” (Hartshorne and Reese 2000, 2). \n\nClassical theists certainly made provisions for speaking of God in\nways that suggested divine passion and even mutability. As Paul\nGavrilyuk argues, for the Church Fathers, divine impassibility was\nless a denial of God’s emotional life than it was a qualifier that\nruled out “passions and experiences that were unbecoming of the\ndivine nature” (Gavrilyuk 2004, 16). In a similar vein, Michael\nDodds emphasizes that Aquinas did not construe divine immutability as\nan attribute of God nor did he think that it implies inertness or\nstagnation. Nevertheless, Dodds, interpreting Aquinas, maintains that\nimmutability “seems to signify divine being (esse) more\nappropriately [than mutability] since it more clearly indicates its\ndistinction from all other things and its transcendence of all human\nthought and language” (Dodds 2008, 157–158). \n\nProcess theists also emphasize our limitations in knowing the reality\nof God, but they are not persuaded that it is best signified by only\none pair of the metaphysical contraries. If one is willing to concede\nthat God should not be conceived as immutable in the bad ways that\ncreatures are unchanging, why may not God be conceived as changeable\nin the good ways that creatures are, with the proviso that God’s\nexcellence necessarily surpasses all else? Hartshorne notes that\nordinary language provides scanty support for and abundant evidence\nagainst the superiority of one pole over the other. We have already\nseen that process theism finds positive value in God’s love being\nactive as well as passive; it is as important that God wills the good\nof the creatures as that God is affected by their joy and\nsuffering. Here is another of Hartshorne’s many examples, expressed\nwith some humor: \n\nHartshorne’s larger point is that the pairs of metaphysical\ncontraries are not related as superior to inferior, but that\nthere are admirable and deficient manifestations of both sides. He sums\nthis up in the principle of the non-invidiousness of the\nmetaphysical contraries (Hartshorne 1970, 268). If this principle\nis correct, and if God is conceived as the eminent embodiment of value\nand supremely worshipful being, then God must be conceived not in\nmonopolar terms but as dipolar, exemplifying the admirable forms of\nboth pairs of metaphysical contrasts. For example, rather than saying\nthat God is in all respects active and in no respects passive, the\nalternative is to say that God is active in some respects and passive\nin other respects, each in uniquely excellent ways. This is one meaning\nof the expression “dipolar theism”; in light of other\nmeanings to be given to “dipolar” in discussions of process\ntheism, it is perhaps clearer to use Hartshorne’s expression for this\nidea: dual transcendence, that is to say, God as the supreme\nembodiment of each pair of metaphysical contraries. \n\nThe most elegant statement of dual transcendence is in the closing\npages of Process and Reality, a line of which we have already\nquoted. The complete quotation reads like a litany: It is as true to say that God is permanent and the world fluent, as\nthat the World is permanent and God is fluent. It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the\nWorld is one and God many. It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual\neminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual\neminently. It is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is\nimmanent in the World. It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World\ntranscends God. It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World\ncreates God. \n\nWe saw above in the discussion of divine creativity that Whitehead\nindulges in poetic expression and that understanding his meaning\nrequires looking more closely at his metaphysical categories. Above\nall, however, what is required is a way of making principled\ndistinctions between different aspects of God so that the doctrine of\ndual transcendence does not collapse into contradiction. Let us examine\nthe different ways in which Whitehead and Hartshorne attempt to save\nthe doctrine of dual transcendence from incoherence. \n\nIn Whitehead’s philosophy, every actual entity has a physical and a\nmental pole. For this reason, Whitehead speaks of actual entities as\n“dipolar” (thus, a second meaning of the word). The\nphysical and mental poles are aspects of every real being (actual\nentities) but they are not real beings themselves. In other words,\nWhitehead is not a mind-body dualist. It is\nalso important to note that, for Whitehead, human consciousness is a\nhigher form of mentality but not the only form. Thus, Whitehead does\nnot claim that every real being is a conscious entity. As with\nLeibniz, Whitehead recognizes a continuum of mind-like qualities\nranging from very primitive feelings to the most advanced form of\nself-awareness.  Whereas Leibniz speaks of every real being—he\ncalls them monads—as having apperception and appetition,\nWhitehead speaks of every actual entity as prehending, or\ngrasping or taking account of, its environment and as striving to\nrealize the\nsubjective aim of coordinating its prehensions in some\ndeterminate fashion. In Process and Reality, Whitehead uses the\nword “feeling” as a synonym for prehension to indicate the\nvector character of feelings—a feeling is always a\nfeeling of something. Whitehead’s belief in a continuum of\nmental qualities fits neatly with evolutionary theory where it is\ncommonplace to conceive differing forms of organic complexity as\nassociated with differing levels of mental capacity. For example, the\nfrontal cortex of a human brain allows for more advanced mentality\nthan one finds in a chimpanzee, whose brain is not as complex. \n\nWhitehead is fully aware that there is an imaginative leap in\napplying these categories to God, but he believes the application can\nbe done in a disciplined and systematic fashion. Whitehead conceives\nGod as an actual entity. In God, the physical and mental poles are\ncalled the consequent nature and the primordial\nnature respectively. As with the physical and mental poles of\nactual entities, so the two “natures” are distinguishable\nbut inseparable aspects of deity. That is to say, neither can exist\napart from the other and each requires the other. The primordial nature\nis God’s envisagement of all possibilities; in the idiom of Leibniz, it\nis God’s knowledge of all possible worlds. It is called\n“primordial” because it represents what could be\nin a sense not tethered to the actual course of events. It is logical\nspace, deficient in actuality apart from the consequent nature says\nWhitehead. The consequent nature is God’s prehensions of the actual\nprocesses of the world. Conversely, it is the world’s influence on God.\nIt is called “consequent” because it is consequent upon, or\ndependent upon, the decisions of non-divine actual entities (Whitehead\ncalls them actual occasions). The consequent nature is the record of\nall achieved fact, a perfect memory of what has been—Whitehead\nspeaks of the “objective immortality” of the world in God.\nThe two natures work in concert in the process of God’s interaction\nwith the creatures. The deity receives the world of actual occasions\ninto its experience; then, comparing what has actually occurred with\nthe realm of pure possibility, God informs the world with new ideals\n(new aims), customized for each actual entity, for what realistically\ncould be achieved. Whitehead sometimes refers to this aspect of the\nprocess as the superjective nature of God. It is God’s\nrelevance for the world as a “lure for feeling,” urging the\ncreatures to strive for whatever perfection of which they are\ncapable. \n\nEach of the statements in Whitehead’s “litany” can be\ninterpreted in terms of the interaction between the two natures and\nGod’s interaction with the world. God is permanent in the sense of\neverlastingly envisioning the realm of possibility; the world is\npermanent as objectively immortal in God’s memory. God is fluent in\nconstantly acquiring new experiences of the world and the world is\nfluent in the rhythm of the birth and death of actual occasions. God is\none in being a single actual entity; but God is many in the graded\nrelevance of possibilities provided for each emergent occasion. The\nworld is one in virtue of God’s experience of it; the world is many\nbecause of the plurality of occasions that make it up. God is eminently\nactual in comparison to the world by achieving a unification of worldly\noccasions in the consequent nature that is beyond any of them taken\nsingly; but the world is eminently actual in comparison to God’s\nprimordial nature, which is not concrete, although it is as infinite as\nthe entire range of possibility. God and the world are immanent in each\nother in that each experiences the other; yet God and the world\ntranscend each other by being realities whose experiences are not\nentirely determined by the other. Finally, as we have seen, God creates\nthe world by informing it with possibilities (technically speaking, God\nprovides “initial aims” for every nascent occasion). The\nworld creates God, not by bringing God into existence, but by creating\nsomething in God, namely the material for what shall become objectively\nimmortal. \n\nHartshorne develops the concept of dual transcendence by drawing a\ndistinction of logical type between, on the one hand, an individual’s\nexistence and enduring characteristics and, on the other hand, the\nactual states of the individual. Using an example dear to his\nornithological interests, Hartshorne says, “That I shall (at\nleast probably) exist tomorrow is one thing; that I shall exist hearing\na blue jay call at noon is another” (Hartshorne 1962, 63). The\nlogical relationship between the two sentences “I shall exist\ntomorrow” and “I shall exist tomorrow as hearing a blue jay\ncall at noon” is that the second cannot be inferred from the\nfirst, but the first can be inferred from the second. The relation of\nentailment between the sentences is a function of the information\nprovided in them. Both sentences speak of the individual’s existence,\nbut only the second sentence speaks of the experience that the\nindividual is having. Hartshorne argues that this logical relation\nbetween the sentences reflects an ontological difference between the\nbare fact of one’s existence and the actual states in which one exists.\nExistence, says Hartshorne, is abstract compared to actuality, which is\nthe concrete. What is true of existence is also true of one’s defining\nor enduring characteristics. The state of affairs described by\n“Hartshorne existing as an ornithologist” is abstract\ncompared to the state of affairs described by “Hartshorne\nexisting as an ornithologist hearing a blue jay call at noon.”\nThe more abstract statement leaves more details concerning the\nindividual’s actuality to be defined. Unless strict determinism is the\ncase—which would require that there is only one future that is\ngenuinely possible—the ornithologist can exist tomorrow without\nhearing a blue jay call at noon (perhaps he will hear another bird, or\nnone at all). \n\nIn effect, Hartshorne lays out a three-fold distinction between\nwhat a thing is (its essence or defining characteristics),\nthat a thing is (its existence), and the particular\nmanner in which it exists (its actual states or actuality).\nHartshorne maintains that this distinction, familiar enough in ordinary\nexperience, is applicable to God and is the basis for speaking of dual\ntranscendence in deity. Between the cases of God and the creatures,\nhowever, there are important differences. Human existence and character\nare fragile and subject to variation. God’s existence and character, on\nthe other hand, are not insecure, unstable, or transient; in a word,\nthey are not contingent. Hartshorne agrees with traditional theism that\nGod exists without the possibility of not existing (sometimes called\nnecessary existence or existence a se) and that God is\nnecessarily supreme in love, knowledge, and power. A closely related\npoint is that, in the divine case, existence and essence are identical,\nwhereas they are not the same thing in the creatures. Aquinas speaks of\nthe “existential composition” of the creatures to indicate\nthat no creature necessarily exists. Hartshorne agrees with Aquinas\nabout this. Since, in God, existence and essence are the same,\nHartshorne customarily abbreviates the distinction among existence,\nessence, and actuality to that between existence and actuality. \n\nThe importance of the distinction between existence and actuality is\nto demonstrate that the necessary aspects of deity do not preclude God\nhaving contingent aspects, provided they do not conflict with the\nnecessary ones. We saw previously, in the discussion of real relations,\nthat there must be contingent aspects of the divine being if it is to\nhave perfect knowledge of contingent things. Aquinas resists this\nconclusion, in part, because he sees contingency as a kind of\nmetaphysical virus that infects the very existence of the one of which\nit is a characteristic. He says that a being whose substance has any\nadmixture of potency is subject to decay (as in physical creatures) or\nannihilation (as in the case of angels) (Summa Contra Gentiles\nI, ch. 16, para. 2). The logical type distinction between existence and\nactuality ensures that contingencies in God pose no threat to the\ndeity’s necessary existence. Thus, Hartshorne says, “That God\nexists is one with his essence and is an analytic truth … but\nhow, or in what actual state of experience or knowledge or will, he\nexists is contingent in the same sense as is our own existence”\n(Hartshorne 1948, 87). It is also part of Hartshorne’s theory that\nGod’s character or essence is supremely excellent. Thus, the\ncontingencies in the divine actuality do not include the possibilities\nof God being selfish, cruel, or wicked as they do in the human\ncase. \n\nThe mention of angelic existence in the previous paragraph brings up a\npoint seldom noticed in discussions of process theism. Aquinas\napproximates the Hartshornean distinction between immutable existence\nand mutable actuality in what he says about the nature of\nangels. (Thomists might say that Hartshorne approximates Aquinas.)\nAquinas holds that angels are not subject to natural decay or\ndestruction for they are incorporeal. Like God, their existence is not\naffected by the flow of time. They are, however, capable of certain\nkinds of change. While their existence is constant, they have free\nwill and their knowledge can increase, and in a certain sense, they\ncan move from place to place. Aquinas says that between the\nunqualified changelessness of God’s eternity and the qualified\nchangeableness of corporeal existence, there is the qualified\nimmutability of angelic being. The technical expression for this\nis æviternity, which is the mean between the extremes\nof eternity and time (Summa Theologica I, Q 19, a. 5). One is\nalmost tempted to say that God, as conceived by Hartshorne,\nis æviternital, except for three important differences:\n(1) angelic existence is unaffected by time, but it is still\ncontingent, unlike the existence of Hartshorne’s God; (2) angelic\nfreedom includes the freedom to be wicked and Hartshorne does not view\nthat as an option for God; (3) angels are entirely nonphysical, but\nHartshorne argues, as we shall see, that God has a body of sorts in\nthe universe itself. \n\nHartshorne often refers to his theism as “neoclassical”\nto indicate both its affinities with and its departures from classical\ntheism—it retains much of what is “classical” in\nclassical theism, but adds something that is new (neo).\nClassical theism holds to the necessity, eternity, infinity,\nindependence, immutability, and impassibility of God. Hartshorne agrees\nthat God can be so characterized, but only with respect to the divine\nexistence and essence. Hartshorne adds that God’s\nactuality is contingent, temporal, finite, dependent, mutable,\nand passible. Indeed, Hartshorne agrees with Whitehead that all\nachieved value is necessarily finite in the sense of not\nexhausting all that can be. Whitehead makes the point that the\nlimitation of God is a necessary condition of God’s goodness. \n\nIt is noteworthy that Whitehead does not say that God is not\ninfinite, but that God is not infinite in all respects. Thus, dual\ntranscendence does not entail that God is in no sense infinite.\nHartshorne locates the infinity of God primarily in the unlimited\ncapacity to influence, know, and care for the creatures in any\nconceivable world. \n\nOne may rightly demand an answer to the question: If\nGod is finite in some respects, what prevents there being a reality\nthat surpasses God? Hartshorne’s response is that there is indeed a\npossible reality that surpasses God in any actual state of the divine\nexistence, but what can surpass God is only a subsequent actual state\nof Godself. Hartshorne calls on Gustav Fechner’s distinction between\n“surpassable by others, including self” and\n“surpassable, but only by self.” It is only the latter\nphrase, according to Hartshorne, that applies to God. This is what\nHartshorne calls R-perfection (for relative perfection), a form of\nperfection that permits a contingent actuality in God that is\nunsurpassed by all others, excluding self. This is by way of\ncontrast with A-perfection (for absolute perfection)—which\napplies to the divine existence and essence—which is to be\nunsurpassable by all others, including self. To speak of God\nas having dual transcendence is to say that God is both R-perfect and\nA-perfect, but in different respects. Thus, one of Hartshorne’s\npreferred definitions of God: “the self-surpassing surpasser of\nall” (Hartshorne 1948, 20). \n\nHartshorne’s version of dual transcendence is quite different from\nWhitehead’s. To be sure, Whitehead and Hartshorne are in firm\nagreement, and are at pains to emphasize, that the relations between\nGod and the world are symmetrical. In addition, both philosophers\nregard God as supremely worshipful not only with respect to the divine\nabsoluteness but also with respect to the divine relativity. Indeed,\none of the main objectives of Hartshorne’s book The Divine\nRelativity (1948) is to show that only by having an eminent form\nof relativity can the deity qualify as worshipful. Nevertheless,\nHartshorne conceives God as an individual who endures through various\nactual states. In the technical language of Whitehead’s philosophy,\nthis makes God a “society,” that is to say, a collection\nof actual entities extended in time, each member of which shares a\ndefining characteristic, passed along from one moment to the next. All\nenduring objects are societies of actual entities; moreover, no actual\nentity endures through various states. Whitehead’s God is not\nan enduring object but a single actual entity. To speak of Whitehead’s\nGod as dipolar is to indicate that God has a physical and a mental\npole. This sense of “dipolar” is different from the\nmeaning that Hartshorne commonly gives the expression. Hartshorne does\nnot deny that actual entities are dipolar, nor does he deny that there\nare physical and mental aspects of deity, but his God is dipolar in\nhaving an enduring character embodied in successive states, the\ncharacter being abstract compared to the concrete actual\nstates—this gives us a third meaning of “dipolar”\n(cf. Griffin’s rather different view on the meanings of dipolarity in\nGod, Griffin 2001a, 150). Hartshorne says, “Unlike Whitehead, I\n… define God as an enduring society of actualities, not a\nsingle actuality. Here I think Whitehead was just mistaken”\n(Hartshorne 1967b, 287). \n\nWhitehead indicated that he considered the possibility of God being\nan enduring object, and thus a society, but rejected it on the grounds\nthat God’s consequent nature loses nothing of the past whereas\nsocieties are characterized by partial loss of the past (Johnson 1983,\n9). This argument is curious, for it would seem to apply to actual\nentities as well as to societies. No non-divine actual entity preserves\nits entire past without distortion and loss; yet Whitehead attributes\nto deity—in the doctrine of objective immortality of the past\nin God—what no other actual entity can accomplish. Hartshorne\nnotes that the unique excellence of retaining the past perfectly in\nmemory must be no less true if God is an actual entity than if God is a\nsociety (Hartshorne 1964, 324). He argues that the consequent nature of\nGod is itself abstract, for it is the generic property of being\nsomehow actual or affected by others (Hartshorne 1972,\n75–76).  Thus, Hartshorne proposes that Whitehead would be more true\nto his own metaphysics by conceiving God as an enduring object, and\nthus as a society, rather than as a single actual entity. Hartshorne\nacknowledged that his own theory is not without its problems. Not\nleast of these is how to coordinate the concept of a divine temporal\nworld-line with the relativistic view of space-time in contemporary\nphysics (Hartshorne 1970, 123–125; Sia 1990, 276; cf. Griffin\n1992). Suffice it to say that the question whether God is best\nconceived as a single actual entity or as an enduring object is a\nmajor parting of the ways between process theists. Griffin, for\nexample, refers to the idea of God as a single everlasting actual\nentity as Whitehead’s “greatest blunder” (Griffin 2001a,\n152). Nevertheless, Whitehead’s view has a number of able defenders,\nincluding Jorge Nobo and Palmyre Oomen (Nobo 1989; Oomen 1998). \n\nThe doctrine of prehension, developed by Whitehead but also\nenthusiastically endorsed by Hartshorne, insures that the world is,\nin some sense, part of God. Actual entities, by virtue of\ntheir prehensions of one another, are internally related to their\npredecessors and externally related to their successors. Whitehead’s\n“organic” philosophy can thereby affirm both that an\nindividual is in the world and the world is in the\nindividual. This generalization applies equally to God, but with\ndifferences that allow for a clear distinction between the divine and\nthe non-divine. Whitehead maintains that events in the world have a\nspecific locus with reference to God, but God has no locus with\nreference to the world (Johnson 1983, 9). Hartshorne says that God is\nthe one individual conceivable a priori—God is\nindividuated by, though not exhausted by, concepts alone (Hartshorne\n1948, 31). This is because God’s scope of interaction is universal\nwhereas the scope of interaction for any creature is localized. To be\nGod is to causally affect and be affected by every real being;\nto be a non-divine entity is to causally affect and be affected by\nsome, but not all, creatures. Whitehead and Hartshorne also\nsay that God and the creatures differ in the quality of interaction.\nFor example, any non-divine individual’s knowledge of others is\nimperfect and partial whereas God’s knowledge is without defect\n(Hartshorne 1967, 40). \n\nWhile both philosophers deny that God has location within the\nuniverse, they consider God to be in some sense a physical or\nmaterial being. Since process thought affirms the goodness of God, it\nis clear that it denies the ancient Manichean and Gnostic ideas that\nthere is something inherently evil in being material. Even so, in order\nto fully appreciate the process view, it is well to keep in mind that\nWhitehead and Hartshorne reject the traditional concept of matter as\ndevoid of any activity or feeling—Whitehead refers to the\ntraditional view of matter as “vacuous actuality.” Because\nactual entities are dipolar, all of them have a physical aspect, but\nnone are entirely lacking in psychic qualities, although in most cases\nthese qualities are negligible. Thus, in process thought, being\nphysical does not mean having no mind-like qualities. The closest\nanticipation of process ideas about mind and body are in Leibniz,\nalthough process thought denies Leibniz’s view that the monads have no\n“windows.” Leibniz maintains that no monad enters into the\ninternal constitution of another; Whitehead’s doctrine of prehension\ninsures that actual entities are internally related to their\npredecessors. \n\nA common criticism of process theism is that it conceives God as\n“needing” the world. In one sense this is true, but in\nanother sense it is false. It is true that, in process metaphysics, the\nstructure of reality is social, and necessarily so. Thus, it promotes a\nsocial view of God—God as necessarily related to non-divine\nactualities. On the other hand, the process God does not require any\nparticular universe in order to exist. Whitehead speaks of a succession\nof “cosmic epochs” which are, in effect, different\nuniverses where the very laws of nature are different. God presides\nover each universe as its eminent creative power, making possible all\nlocalized expressions of creativity, but no universe sustains God’s\nexistence. Hartshorne makes a similar point by comparing God’s\nexistence and actuality to a set that necessarily has members.\n“To say that a class could not be empty is not at all to say that\nits particular members are necessary” (Hartshorne 1970, 144).\nFrom the perspective of process theism, the criticism that God\n“needs” the universe is, at best, simply another way of\nraising the question of how best to conceive the necessarily existent:\nIs it, or is it not, social in nature? \n\nTrinitarians sometimes argue that a social concept of ultimate reality\ncan be formulated if God is necessarily related to the divine\nself. Process theists, especially those who are Christians, are not\naverse to this suggestion. Nevertheless, if this is to be taken\nseriously as a philosophical proposal, then there can be no mere\nappeal to the “mystery” of the Trinity. Some effort should\nbe made to retain the primary meaning of “social” as\nmultiple entities in a network of relations, some of which are\ninternal and some external. That is to say, a genuinely social concept\nof reality is one in which the multiple identities of each of the\ninterrelated and interacting entities are not absorbed into each\nother. Whitehead and Hartshorne claim to do this apart from the\nChristian doctrine of the Trinity, but there is no reason a\npriori to suppose that Trinitarian metaphysics cannot be one\nversion of process metaphysics, or that the latter could not be\nadapted to the former (Boyd 1992; Inbody 1997, ch. 8; Bracken and\nSuchocki 2005). \n\nWhitehead and Hartshorne part company concerning the proper analogy\nfor conceiving the God-world relation. Hartshorne modifies\nPlato’s world-soul analogy in the Timaeus\n(30a–34c). In Plato’s myth, the eternal demiurge creates a\nuniverse that is a living creature, animated by a soul. Hartshorne\nargues that the best philosophical interpretation of the myth is to\nconsider the demiurge and the world-soul as two aspects of the same\ndeity (Hartshorne & Reese 2000, 55). If this is correct, then\nPlato affirms a version of dual transcendence, with one aspect of God\nbeing the universe. According to this interpretation, Plato came close\nto Hartshorne’s view that, “the world is God’s\nbody” (Hartshorne 1941, 185; Dombrowski 2005, chapter 1). This\nis not to say that God has a location within the universe, but that\nthe location of the universe is in God, for the divine\nbeing-in-becoming is all-inclusive. Hartshorne borrows a word invented\nby Karl Krause (1781–1832) to express this\nview: panentheism—everything (pan, all) is in\n(en, in) God (theos, God) (Cooper 2006,\n121). Panentheism is a mediating position between pantheism and\nclassical theism. For pantheism, the world is identical to God; for\nclassical theism, the world is completely external to God; for\npanentheism, the world is within God. \n\nHartshorne makes qualifications to Plato’s analogy. Whereas Plato\napparently conceives the soul-body (or mind-body) relationship as a\none-to-one relation, Hartshorne, following modern biology, argues that\nit is more plausible to construe it as a one-to-many relation. The\nhuman body is a hierarchical society of thousands of kinds of cells.\nThus, Hartshorne maintains that God is related to the universe in a\nmanner similar to the way that a person is related to the cells of his\nor her body. In an important respect, Whitehead can make a better\nclaim than Hartshorne that the relationship of God to the World is\none-to-many. Whitehead’s God is a single actual entity whereas\nHartshorne’s God is a society. Thus, if it is a question of the\nrelations of actual entities, then the God-to-World relation in\nHartshorne’s theism is a many-to-many relation. Hartshorne’s point\nrequires clarification: God, a single enduring object, is related to\nevery non-divine actual entity and society. Clarity on this point\nbrings out another comparison. By conceiving God as an actual entity,\nWhitehead weakens the analogy between God and a person. Donald\nSherburne shows that in Whitehead’s metaphysics, persons are enduring\nobjects of a specific type (Sherburne 1969). Therefore, Hartshorne’s\nview of God as an enduring object apparently provides more of a basis\nfor speaking of God as a person. \n\nRandall E. Auxier and Gary L. Herstein (2017) maintain, on the\ncontrary, that a Whiteheadian view is friendlier to conceiving God as\na person than Hartshorne’s view. Their argument turns on the idea of\nnegative prehensions, that is, experience which “eliminates\n[certain data] from feeling” (Whitehead 1978, 23). According to\nAuxier and Herstein, one cannot be a person or experience temporal\npassage apart from negative prehensions, which, they say, allow\ndistinctions both between what was and\nwhat might-have-been and between what will-be and\nwhat might-be (Auxier and Herstein 2017, 243 and\n265). Hartshorne consistently rejected the idea of negative\nprehensions in God whereas Whitehead, at least in some of his\nstatements, seemed to allow for them. The metaphysical issues run\ndeep; suffice it to say that Hartshorne distinguished the actual and\nthe possible in ways that diverged significantly from Whitehead (see\nRamal 2010, 139–157). \n\nThe analogy of God to a person is, of course, an analogy. A person’s\nfeelings cannot be entirely separated from the feelings of cells in\nthe body—damage to the cells hurts the person. In a similar\nfashion, God is affected by what affects the creatures. On the other\nhand, God knows—in Whiteheadian language, God\nprehends—each “cell” of the divine body in a\nperfectly distinct fashion whereas others experience their\ncells en masse, much as one sees the green of the grass but\nnot each blade. Another difference, as we have seen, is that God is\nnot located within the universe as are non-divine\nindividuals. Hartshorne turns this difference to his advantage by\nfollowing a suggestion in Plato. He says that Plato’s argument\nconcerning the spherical nature of the universe adequately explains\nwhy the divine body has neither internal organs nor sense\norgans. Bodily organs in the creatures, including a central nervous\nsystem, are needed to mediate with an external environment, but there\nis nothing external to the universe (Hartshorne 1984, 134). God’s only\n“environment” is internal to God. Thus, the world-soul\nanalogy does not entail that God has a brain or any other bodily organ\nthat one finds in the creatures. In addition, the lack of an external\nenvironment for God means that there can be no threat to the divine\nexistence from such a source. The “harm” done to God by\ncreaturely suffering can never be fatal. \n\nWhitehead’s view of God as a single actual entity is arguably one\nfactor that prevented him from taking the Platonic analogy as a serious\nproposal. His remarks on the topic are entirely negative. \n\nIt is clear that Whitehead and Hartshorne take the Timaeus\nin very different directions. Whitehead read the dialogue through the\nlens of neo-Platonism, conceiving the world-soul as an emanation from a\nwholly transcendent demiurge. Hartshorne agrees that this is not the\nsolution to the problem of permanence and flux. However, Hartshorne\nsees in Plato’s myth the elements of a solution, provided the demiurge\nand the world-soul are not separate deities, but aspects of the same\ndeity. For this reason, Hartshorne says that Whitehead rejected the\nanalogy for “weak reasons” (Hahn 1991, 642). \n\nLate in his career, Hartshorne saw other advantages to the\nworld-soul analogy that touch on the problem of God and gender. He was\nsympathetic to feminist complaints about the male bias in traditional\ntheology and he made a concerted effort in the closing decades of his\nlife to use inclusive language (Hartshorne 2001, 258). For example, in\nthe 1980s he began using “He-She” when referring to God and\nhe remarked in 1996 that he would title his third book Our Vision\nof God rather than Man’s Vision of God (Auxier and Davies\n2001, 159). Hartshorne goes further than simply worrying about\npronouns. If the world-soul analogy is combined with the\nparent-to-child analogy, then he argues that, “it is the mother,\nnot the father, who furnishes by far the best symbol of deity. The\nfetus-mother relationship is decidedly more intimate than the\nfetus-father relationship” (Hartshorne 1984, 60). Hartshorne\nnever expressed his thoughts on feminism systematically, but it is\ninstructive that Carol P. Christ explicitly develops her\nfeminist philosophy of religion in light of Hartshorne’s metaphysics in\nher book She Who Changes. Generally speaking, feminist\ntheologians have been friendly to process thought, seeing Whitehead and\nHartshorne as articulating ideas about the divine that speak to\nfeminist concerns (Christ 2003, 4–5). \n\nOne objection to the concept of a deity whose “body” is\nthe universe is that it implies that all values, both the good and the\nevil, are within God. Hartshorne counters that this is true, but not in\na sense that compromises divine goodness. As a point of logic, wholes\ndo not necessarily share the characteristics of their parts. On\nHartshorne’s model, the relation of God to any non-divine creature is a\nrelation of whole to part. Indeed, this is the basis of Hartshorne’s\nview of religion as the acceptance of our fragmentariness—we\nare fragments of the cosmos, not the whole of it. Thus, Hartshorne can\nsay that God’s goodness is not diminished if a fragmentary being is\nheedless of the good of others, by indifference or harmful intent.\nNevertheless, precisely because of God’s goodness, the\nsuffering and wickedness of the creatures enter God’s experience. God\nsympathizes with the sufferer and grieves for the criminal in losing an\nopportunity for creating the good. God can feel the contrast between\nwhat could have been and what is. The “what is,” moreover,\nis not unilaterally determined by God but is left, in part, to the\ncreatures; we have seen that God and the creatures are co-creators in\nprocess theism. For this reason, Hartshorne, following Berdyaev, speaks\nof tragic and sublime aspects of divine love (cf. Hartshorne 1953,\nchapter 8). Whitehead agrees that, “there is a tragedy which even\nGod does not escape” (Johnson 1983, 7). \n\nProcess theism provides unique, if controversial, thoughts on the\ntraditional problem of evil. Simply stated, the problem of evil comes\nto this: if God is all-powerful then God has the ability to prevent\nunjustified suffering; if God is perfectly good then God has the\nmotive to prevent unjustified suffering; but unjustified suffering\napparently exists; therefore, there is reason to believe that God is\nnot all-powerful or not perfectly good. The argument can be taken in\nat least two ways. According to one interpretation, the problem of\nevil poses a challenge to belief in God. In other words, it is a\nstepping stone towards atheism. Another interpretation is that it is a\nchallenge to rethink the attributes of God. In this case, if one\nconsiders the argument sound, it is not belief in God that one should\nabandon, but belief in certain concepts of God. Process theists\ngenerally approach the problem of evil in the spirit of the second\ninterpretation.  Moreover, they point out that to assume the first\ninterpretation—that the problem of evil is an argument against\nthe existence of God—is an invitation to beg the question\nagainst alternative proposals about the nature of God such as process\ntheism offers. \n\nA central contention of process theism is that the problem of evil is\naggravated by flawed accounts of omnipotence commonly assumed by\ntheists and their critics. Most theists agree with Aquinas that God\ncannot bring about logically impossible states of affairs, like\ncreating a circle with unequal radii (Summa Contra Gentiles\nII, ch. 25, para. 14). This is not, Aquinas argues, a limitation on\nGod but a condition of responsible theological discourse. To say, as\nDescartes does, that God could have made such irregularly shaped\ncircles, is to utter nonsense according to Aquinas (Cottingham 1991,\n25). Whitehead remarks that some medieval and modern philosophers got\ninto the unfortunate habit of paying God “metaphysical\ncompliments”—that is to say, attributing properties to God\nthat seem to make the divine more worthy of devotion but that are\ncontrary to sound metaphysical reasoning (Whitehead 1925,\n258). Whitehead’s observation is more applicable to Descartes than to\nAquinas. Indeed, process theism has no quarrel with Aquinas on this\npoint. It is rather, the stronger claim that God can bring about any\nstate of affairs the description of which is not contradictory, with\nwhich process theism takes issue. It is a fair question whether\nAquinas held this view (see Summa Theologica I, Q. 25,\na. 3). Nevertheless, it is a widely accepted view of omnipotence as\nGriffin makes clear (Griffin 1976, chapter 17).  In a deliberate play\non J. B. Phillips’ classic, Your God is Too Small, Tyron\nInbody sums up the criticism of traditional accounts of divine power\nby saying, “Your God is too big” (Inbody 1997, 139). \n\nGriffin warns against what he calls “the omnipotence\nfallacy.” This is the fallacy of assuming that if a state of\naffairs is logically possible—that is, its description involves\nno contradiction—then an omnipotent being could single-handedly\nbring it about (Griffin 1976, 263f). Griffin represents all process\ntheists in considering it a fallacy, for it is their contention that\nthere are logically possible states of affairs that no being, including\nGod, could bring about by itself. For example, a contractual agreement\nbetween two individuals or parties is impossible unless each agrees to\nkeep the conditions of the contract. This is expressed colloquially in\nEnglish by saying, “It takes two to tango.” The example of\nmaking contracts is especially relevant since it is a theme in Jewish\nScripture that God enters into numerous covenants with the creatures.\nThe emphasis is invariably on the divine initiative in making the\ncovenants and on God’s reliability in keeping a promise; nevertheless,\nwhen “covenant” is not simply shorthand for God’s promises,\nthe agreements are two-sided affairs, including God’s blessings and\ndemands and human obligations. Arguably, the logic of contracts,\nagreements, and covenants, does not change when one of the parties is\ndivine. These examples are evidence that there are logically possible\nstates of affairs that require something more than the decisions of\nGod. \n\nHartshorne argues the case as follows. Suppose X and\nY are agents who make decisions A and B,\nrespectively. The conjunction, AB, is something that neither\nX nor Y, individually, decided, even if one of\nthe agents is God. Suppose, however, for the sake of argument,\nthat this reasoning does not apply in the divine case. According to\nthis view, if X is God, then it is possible for X to\ndecide not only A, but also AB. We can imagine that\nA represents God loving an individual and B\nrepresents the individual freely accepting God’s love. If God decides\nAB then God must also bring it about that B, that the\nindividual freely accepts God’s love, for this is part of AB.\nHartshorne responds that this view divorces the concept of decision\nmaking from any meaningful connection with lived experience. Numerous\nanalogies have been discussed in the literature for how free creatures\nmight be related to a deity that makes their decisions—the\ncreatures as God’s marionettes; as androids programmed by God; as\nsubjects hypnotized by God; as objects of God’s dreaming; as characters\nin God’s novel. Each analogy faces the dilemma that either the\ndecisions of the person are not fully determined (e.g., the hypnotism\ncase) or the person is not an actual individual (e.g., the fictional\ncharacter case). In ordinary language, an individual that tries to\ncontrol a relationship is called manipulative, overbearing, or\ncolloquially, “a control freak.” Doubtless, it was\nconsidering this kind of analogy that led Hartshorne to speak of\n“the tyrant ideal of power” in classical theism\n(Hartshorne 1984a, 11). In a similar vein, Whitehead speaks of the\nidolatry of fashioning God in the image of imperial rulers: “The\nChurch gave unto God the attributes which belonged exclusively to\nCaesar” (Whitehead 1978, 342). \n\nJames Keller argues that the traditional concept of omnipotence can\nonly be justified by appealing to metaphysical schemes or intuitions\nthat are no better established than omnipotence itself (Keller 2007,\n131). Hartshorne goes further and says that the traditional concept of\nomnipotence was not coherent enough to be false (Hartshorne 1978,\n86). The denial that an individual’s free decisions can be totally\ndetermined by another is what is behind the slogan—often found\nin discussions of process theism—that God acts by\npersuasion rather than by coercion. Whitehead attributes this\nidea to Plato’s later thought, in the Sophist and the\nTimaeus, and calls it, “one of the greatest\nintellectual discoveries in the history of religion” (Whitehead\n1933, 213; ch.  X, sec. III). Unfortunately, the slogan has often been\nmisinterpreted, even by process thinkers. It does not mean that,\naccording to Whitehead and Hartshorne, God acts only as a final cause\nand never as an efficient cause, as Griffin has shown (Griffin 1991,\n98–99). “Coercion,” in the sense intended by the slogan,\nis the ability of one actual being to unilaterally bring about the\ndecision of another actual being. In process metaphysics, no\nindividual possesses this ability. Thus, in a metaphysical sense, it\nis not only God that acts persuasively and not coercively, but every\nactual being. \n\nOf course, “persuasion” and “coercion” have\nmeanings in ordinary language. To persuade is to convince others to do\nsomething of their own will. To coerce is to force one’s will\nupon others who are unwilling. The italicized phrases are\nimportant, for they demonstrate that persuasion and coercion presuppose\nthe ability of the individual who is being persuaded or coerced to make\ndecisions. Even in the case of coercion, the person being coerced\nretains the power to resist, even if only mentally. This indicates that\ncoercion is an inferior form of power, used either out of ignorance or\nwhen persuasion has failed. Cobb says, “In my relations with\nother people, such as my children, the use of such power is a last\nresort which expresses my total powerlessness in all ways that\nmatter” (Cobb 1969, 89). Thus, even if the words\n“persuasive” and “coercive” are taken in their\nordinary, non-metaphysical, senses, it makes sense to speak of the\nsupreme or eminent form of power as persuasive rather than\ncoercive. \n\nDavid Basinger presses the following objection. Coercion in the\nordinary sense may be an inferior form of power, but there is sometimes\na moral imperative to use it, otherwise we would never have a police\nforce. Thus, a deity that possesses both coercive and persuasive power\nis greater than a deity that possesses only persuasive power (Basinger\n1988). Hartshorne, who argues against strict pacifism, agrees that the\nuse of brute force can sometimes be morally justified. In response to\nthe threat of Naziism he wrote, “Freedom must not be free to\ndestroy freedom” (Hartshorne 1941, 173). In process theism,\nhowever, coercion in the ordinary sense represents an indirect\nform of power that is available only for localized beings within the\ncosmos (Hartshorne 1948, 155). It is indirect in the sense that it is\nexerted on aggregates of actual entities and not on actual entities\nthemselves, as when one person prevents another from performing a\nvicious act by restraining the aggressor’s body. God’s power over\naggregates is nothing over and above the direct persuasive power over\nthe actual entities that comprise them. Barry Whitney argues\nthat there is a coercive aspect of God’s power in process theism\ninsofar as the laws of nature are the result of a divine decision that\nno creature is free to abrogate (Whitney 1985, 99–114). That there\nshould be this form of divine power—which is also a form of\nefficient causation—providing for an ordered world that no\ncreature has decided, is a necessary condition for any creaturely\nactivity, Hartshorne believes. “God decides upon the basic\noutlines of creaturely actions, and guaranteed limits within which\nfreedom is to operate. That not everything can be guaranteed does not\nmean that nothing can be” (Hartshorne 1966, 206). \n\nGriffin maintains that it lies at the heart of process theism’s\nanswer to the problem of evil that God’s power is exerted on\nindividuals rather than aggregates (Griffin 1991, 104). Theists of a\nmore traditional bent may view this as an indication of the inadequacy\nof process metaphysics, for there is no provision for a run-of-the-mill\ncoercive power in its concept of God. The idea that persuasion plus\ncoercion is a greater form of power than persuasion alone ignores,\nhowever, a significant difference between God and the creatures. Every\nperson has the power of persuasion and coercion (in their ordinary\nsenses), but neither of these powers involves a violation of the laws\nof nature. In order to attribute both forms of power to God seems to require\nthat God have the power to violate the laws of nature. That may not\nseem unreasonable since God, as traditionally conceived, acts\nmiraculously in ways that break or suspend the laws of nature.\nNevertheless, to speak, as Basinger does, of a moral imperative to act\ncoercively is tantamount, in the divine case, to demanding that the\ndeity contravene the very laws that, according to traditional theism\nand process theism, it imposed in the first place. There is an\nadditional irony where the problem of evil is concerned. Traditional\ntheists fault process theists for, in effect, not attributing to God\nthe power to prevent gratuitous suffering. Traditional theists, on the\nother hand, attribute this power to God but are obliged to argue that\nGod is not at fault for not using it or for using it in ways that we\nfind utterly baffling. \n\nThe felt contrast between what could have been the case and what is\nthe case is the scaffolding on which the problem of evil is built.\nThings do not always work out for the best and it seems that there are\nevents that the world would have been better without. There are\nvarious names in the literature for these occurrences, but Griffin’s\nexpression, “genuine evil” (correlative to “genuine\ngood”) is as good as any. A hallmark of process theism is to\ndraw attention to the value inherent in the twin probabilities of\ngenuine good and evil. Process thought raises the\nquestion—and answers it in the affirmative—whether a world\nwith a probability, not merely a possibility, of genuine good and evil\nis preferable to a world without it. In the closing pages of\nPragmatism, James raises this question by means of a thought\nexperiment. If God asked you before the creation of the universe if\nyou would agree to be part of a world that was not certain to be\nsaved—where there was real adventure and real risk—what\nwould you say? James recognizes that a world where the risk of failure\nis real does not appeal to everyone; but he says that the chances for\nsuccess that it promises brings zest to life and makes it rational to,\n“add our fiat to the fiat of the creator”\n(James 1907, 290–291). \n\nHartshorne says that a universe with\nmultiple freedom or creativity is a universe where the non-identical\ntwins of opportunity and risk are inevitable. As already noted,\nprocess theists do not believe in a God that plays with loaded\ndice. What James’s image adds to this picture is the idea that a\nworld-order with the opportunity for genuine good and the risk of\ngenuine evil is of greater value than a world-order devoid of\nthese opportunities and risks. James’s idea also implies that, in such\na world-order, the risks would be real for deity.  We have already\nseen that process theism affirms tragedy in God. The silver linings on\nthis cloud are: (1) God preserves the universe in the divine memory\nwhich means that the creatures contribute something to God; (2) God,\nconsidered as superject, has an inexhaustible capacity to bring order\nfrom chaos and make fresh beginnings, providing a sense of hope amidst\nthe ruin of our lives. \n\nThe problem of evil is often presented primarily as an ethical\nconcern, but there is an aesthetic dimension to the problem that is\nemphasized by process theism (cf. Whitney 1994). If a perfectly good deity would have the\nmotive to overcome discord and wickedness, it would also have a motive\nto avoid triviality and boredom. This is especially the case in the\nuniverse as conceived by process theism where feeling (prehension) is a\nmetaphysical category. The etymology of “aesthetic” is\naesthesis, which means “feeling,” and process\nthought emphasizes that aesthetic values are fundamentally values for\nan experiencing subject. Moreover, the experiencing subject, in most\ncases, is not human. This fact is evident not only by looking at the\ncontemporary world with its countless varieties of species, but also\nwhen one considers the nearly unfathomable stretches of time on this\nplanet when humans did not exist. Process theism takes the\nnon-anthropocentric, and non-relativist, stance that the experiences of\nnon-human creatures are valuable whether or not humans value them. This\nis not to say that all experience is equally valuable—the\nexperience of a cockroach can have value without being fully comparable\nto human experience. Process metaphysics provides for an aesthetic\ntheory that recognizes objective criteria of value such as unity amid\ncontrast and intensity amid complexity (see Dombrowksi 2004). The long\nprocess of evolution can be charted on a curve of ever increasing\nvarieties and complexities of organisms with augmented capacity for\nvaluable types of experience. As Cobb and Griffin note, the escape from\ntriviality meant an increased risk of discord, but this brings us full\ncircle to James’s thought experiment (Cobb and Griffin 1976, 73). \n\nThe Preacher in Ecclesiastes gives eloquent expression to\nworld-weariness by saying that there is nothing new under the sun.\nNevertheless, process thought reminds us that there was once a time\nwhen the sun itself was new. We noted earlier that in process\nmetaphysics, time is the process of creation. The universe is not a\ntotality, fixed once and for all, but a dynamic vector growing from a\ndeterminate past into an open (partly indeterminate) future. We have\nalso seen that process theism conceives God as being really related to\nthe world through prehensions or feelings. If divine knowing is\nconsidered perfect, then it follows from these premises that God knows\nthe past as fully determinate (as created), the present as the process\nof determination (as being created), and the future as partly\nindeterminate (as yet to be created). Some have criticized process\ntheism for advocating a limited God who is ignorant of the future.\nProcess theists reply that this is incorrect and represents a subtle\nbegging of the question. The question is not whether God knows a fully\ndeterminate future but whether there is a fully determinate future to\nknow. It is the nature of time, not the nature of divine knowing, that\nis at issue. If the future exists as partially indeterminate,\nunsettled, or uncreated, then a perfect knower must know it as\nsuch. \n\nThe fact that process theism construes God’s knowledge as prehensive\nmeans that it is a mistake to interpret it solely in terms of the\ninformation content of declarative sentences. This is not to say that\nGod does not have this information, but it is well to keep in mind\nthat omniscience, for process theism, is more akin to what Bertrand\nRussell calls knowledge by acquaintance than it is to knowledge by\ndescription (Hartshorne 1941, 241). Divine prehensions of the world\ninclude not only information but affective tone (Whitehead calls it\nthe “subjective form” of prehensions); God’s knowledge is\nempathetic, feeling the feelings of the creatures. Again, this\ncontrasts with the traditional account of omniscience which\n“attributes to God the informational content of our perceptions\nwithout the hedonistic content” (Kenny 1979,\n32). E. S. Brightman (Auxier and Davies 2001, 43, 70), Henri\nSimoni-Wastila (1999), and Auxier and Herstein (2017, 264) argue that\nclaiming this kind of knowledge for God is excessive, for it would\nmean, for example, that in knowing a creature’s fear of death, God\nwould also fear death.  Hartshorne’s response is that God\nfeels how we feel without feeling as we feel,\nsimilar to the way in which persons can vividly remember emotions they\nonce experienced without actually having those emotions as their own\nin the present experience of memory (Hartshorne 1984b, 199). This\nissue highlights a tension between Whitehead and Hartshorne. Whitehead\nspeaks of an actual entity’s subjectivity as “perishing”\nas it becomes past, but Hartshorne insists that the divine memory\npreserves the immediacy of our experiences, making them objectively\nimmortal (Whitehead 1978, 351; Hartshorne 1970, 118). \n\nProcess theism provides an account of the mechanics of\nomniscience—that is, an account of how God knows the\nworld—that fits well with analogies drawn from experience. Apart\nfrom complications introduced by quantum physics, events do not occur\nbecause we know about them; we know about them, in part, because they\noccur. Process theism applies the same logic to God. This account\ndiffers from traditional views in two important ways.  First, many\ntheists follow Aquinas in reversing the cognitive relation in God. For\nAquinas, God knows events in the world because God is their cause\n(Summa Theologica I, Q. 14, a. 11). This allows Aquinas to\naffirm omniscience while denying real relations in God; however, it\nalso makes an unambiguous affirmation of the contingency of creaturely\ndecisions difficult if not impossible, as we have already seen in our\ndiscussion of God and creativity. Second, the process view contradicts\nthe Boethian concept of eternity as a non-temporal viewpoint on\ntemporal events. For Boethius (and for Aquinas) events in time are\nrelated to God as the points on the circumference of a circle are\nrelated to its center (Consolation of Philosophy, bk 5, prose\n6; Summa Contra Gentiles I, ch. 66, para. 7). For process\nthought, time is more like a line being added to from moment to\nmoment, but never complete, so there is no vantage from which it can\nbe taken in all at once (Hartshorne 1945, 284). \n\nThere are peculiarities in traditional metaphors for omniscience that\nprocess thought rejects. God, it was said, “sees” all of\ntime in one eternal instant; yet seeing, like knowing, requires real\nrelations in the perceiver; moreover, one cannot see as fully\nactualized that which is still only possibly to be actualized, that is\nto say, the partially indeterminate future. It is noteworthy, however,\nthat process theism retains one element of the traditional view. We\nhave seen that Hartshorne attributes the laws of nature to an act of\nGod. For this reason, God knows the extent to which the future is\nopen—what the laws allow and what they do not allow. The process\nGod must also be aware of the conditions that creaturely decisions set\nupon future actualization, opening up some possibilities and closing\nothers. \n\nProcess theists were not the first to notice the problems that the\nThomistic account poses for human freedom. William of Ockham, for\nexample, despaired of explaining how God could come to know the future\nfree decisions of the creatures (Shields 1993, 298). Luis de Molina\ndeveloped the chief rival in classical theism to Aquinas’s account of\nthe mechanics of omniscience. Molinism has been much discussed in\nrecent literature and vigorously defended (Shields & Viney 2004,\n241, n. 15). Molina claims that there are true statements about what\nany possible creature would freely do in any situation in\nwhich that creature existed. The truth of these statements, called\n“middle knowledge conditionals,” is decided by neither God\nnor the creatures; they are simply eternally true, a kind of innate\ndivine knowledge. Molina agrees with Aquinas that the deity knows the\nproduct of its own creative activity—called “free\nknowledge” (Kenny 1979, 62). Using free knowledge, in\nconjunction with middle knowledge conditionals, God can deduce what\nany actual creature will freely do. The deduction has the\nform: “If individual X were in situation S,\nthen X would freely decide A” (middle\nknowledge conditional); and “X is in S”\n(God’s free knowledge); therefore, “X will freely\ndecide A.” Molina’s theory is designed to save both the\nfreedom of the creatures and the divine immutability and\nimpassibility. Thus, it poses as much of a challenge to process theism\nas does Thomism which claims for itself the same advantages. \n\nNeither Whitehead nor Hartshorne addresses Molinism, but process\nmetaphysics provides resources for a number of criticisms (Shields\n& Viney 2004, 225–233). One objection is that Molinism endows God\nwith an innate knowledge of an elaborate set of contingent truths\nwhich have no explanation. Yet, contingent truths are precisely the\nsorts of truths for which we legitimately seek\nexplanations—indeed, this is one of the marks of contingency\n(Hartshorne 1962, 74). A related problem is that the distinction\nbetween the possible and the actual is finessed. It is common to refer\nto what an actual individual would do in a certain\ncircumstance, for one can speak of that individual’s dispositions and\ncharacter as so far formed. To refer to what a possible\nindividual would do is entirely different.  Possible individuals\nare either fictional (like Sherlock Holmes) or they are tied to the\ncreative powers of the actual world (like a child yet to be\nconceived). The properties of fictional characters are defined by\nsomeone’s imagination and so there is no fixed truth about what they\nwould do. Arguably, persons yet to be conceived can only be said to have the\nproperties that link them to the reproductive potentialities of actual\npersons. Thus, most babies have the capacity to\ngrow up to become parents themselves. What may the first child (call\nit Chris) of a particular newborn (call it Kim) be like? The most that\ncan be said with certainty is that half of Chris’s chromosomes will be\ninherited from Kim. To speak informatively about what Chris would do\nunder any given circumstances presupposes uncountable human decisions\nand years of development beyond Kim’s own childhood. \n\nA third and final criticism of Molinism, from a process perspective,\nis that it doesn’t really preserve the freedom of the creatures in the\nway it claims. Molina verbally accepts the idea that one is\nsignificantly free only if one could have done otherwise in the same\ncircumstances (in the literature this is called incompatibilist\nfreedom). For example, if Oswald’s assassination of President Kennedy\nwas a genuinely free act then if, per impossibile, the clock\ncould be turned back to the moments before the murder, Oswald could\nhave decided not to pull the trigger. Alternately stated, Oswald’s not\npulling the trigger in the exact situation where he in fact did pull\nthe trigger could have become actual. In Hartshorne’s view, and as far\nas incompatibilist freedom is concerned, to be actually possible\nis to be (or to have been) possibly actual. On Molinist\nprinciples, it is difficult to see how Oswald’s not pulling the\ntrigger in those circumstances could have become actual. It is true\nthat, in Molina’s view, there is no contradiction in conceiving Oswald\nin those circumstances not pulling the trigger. But, given the set of\nmiddle knowledge conditionals about Oswald, Oswald’s not pulling the\ntrigger happens in no world that God can create (this is not to say\nthat if a different set of middle knowledge conditionals were true of\nOswald God could not create those possible worlds). The events,\nhowever, that can become actual, that are actually possible, are\nevents in universes created by God. Since, under the assumption of the\nset of middle knowledge conditionals we know to be true of Oswald, no\nuniverse that could be created by God—no possible\nactuality—is one in which Oswald freely refrains from pulling\nthe trigger, Oswald’s act cannot be considered a free act. Of course,\nit may be the case that the set of middle knowledge conditionals\nconcerning Oswald are such that he could have refrained from pulling\nthe trigger had God created a slightly different universe; but it is\nOswald’s freedom in the actual universe that is at issue. \n\nThe problems of the mechanics of omniscience aside, the traditional\ntheist might argue that the process view of God’s knowledge is\nproblematic because it either limits God’s knowledge or it violates\nelementary principles of logic. The argument is apparently\nstraightforward. Every proposition of the form, “p or\nnot-p” is true because one or the other side of the\ndisjunction is true. To use Aristotle’s example from De\nInterpretatione IX, either a sea battle will occur tomorrow or it\nwill not. Let p represent “A sea battle will occur\ntomorrow” and not-p, “A sea battle will not occur\ntomorrow.” In that case, “A sea battle will occur tomorrow\nor a sea battle will not occur tomorrow” is a tautology and hence\ntrue. If God does not know which side of the disjunction is true then\nGod’s knowledge is limited. If the disjunction itself is not true then\nsome tautologies are false. Any theory that commits one to the falsity\nof some tautologies flaunts the fundamental principles of logic and\nthereby faces a steep burden of proof. \n\nAristotle apparently believed that, where future contingents are\nconcerned, “p or not-p” is true but the\ntwo halves of the disjunction have indeterminate truth values. This\nidea seems logically counter-intuitive. If p and not-p\nare indeterminate, shouldn’t “p or not-p”\nalso be indeterminate? For a brief period, Hartshorne defended\nthe Aritotelian idea (Hartshorne 1939), but he discovered a more\nparsimonious solution (Hartshorne 2011c, 123). Instead of locating the\nindeterminacy of the future in truth values, he focused on predicates\nthat reflect the extent to which the future is open for any given\nevent. Either all causal conditions are such that the sea battle will\noccur, or no causal conditions are such that it will occur, or it is\npermitted by some but not all causal conditions (cf. Hartshorne 1970,\n145). It “will” occur means that all the possibilities for\ntomorrow which are still left open involve the occurrence in question;\nwhile it “may” occur means that some of the open\npossibilities involve the occurrence; and it “will not”\noccur means that none of the possibilities involve it (Hartshorne\n1941, 100). \n\nAlthough Hartshorne rejected Aristotle’s view on future contingents,\nhis solution to the problem that Aristotle tried to solve neatly\nparallels Aristotle’s square.  “Z will occur” and\n“Z will not occur” are contraries—they may\nboth be false but they cannot both be true. The contradictory of\n“Z will occur” is “Z may not\noccur”; similarly, the contradictory of “Z will\nnot occur” is “Z may occur.” In A\nChristmas Carol, Scrooge presupposes this schema when he asks the\nGhost of Christmas Yet to Come, “Are these the shadows of the\nthings that Will be or the shadows of things that May be, only?”\nOf this example, Hartshorne said, “There is a master of language\n[i.e. Dickens]. Will and May are nicely distinguished in ordinary\nspeech” (Hartshorne & Viney 2001, 39). \n\nHartshorne maintains that, “the semantic analysis of truth\nwith reference to future events should not be so formulated as to make\n‘will’ and ‘will not’ the sole\npossibilities” (Hartshorne 2011a, 83). Following Hartshorne’s\nsuggestion, George Shields says that, “Z will\noccur” and “Z will not occur” should not be\nsymbolized in the propositional calculus as p and\nnot-p but as p and q, where “If\np then not-q” and “If q then\nnot-p.” The conjunction of these propositions, “If\np then not-q and if q then\nnot-p” mirrors the truth value semantics of contrariety,\nnot contradiction, which is mirrored by “It is false that\n‘p if and only if q,’” or exclusive\ndisjunction. Shields argues that it is question begging to assume that\n“Z will or will not occur” must be an instance of\n“p or not-p”. The question at issue is\nthe formalization of future tense statements; thus, it will not do to\nassume that verb tense makes no difference in the formalization\n(Shields & Viney 2004, 220). \n\nWhitehead says that, “Philosophy never reverts to its old\nposition after the shock of a great philosopher” (Whitehead 1978,\n11). Whether or not Whitehead and Hartshorne are considered great\nphilosophers, they seem to have occasioned a seismic shift in\ncontemporary discussions of the philosophy of religion in which\nphilosophers take the doctrine of real relations in God more seriously.\nFor example, some Neo-Thomists have taken the criticisms of process\ntheism to heart and admitted real relations in God, contrary to the\nteaching of the angelic doctor (Whitney 1985, 75–81). The Jesuit\nphilosopher W. Norris Clarke advises Thomists to “simply\ndrop” the doctrine of the lack of real relations in God and to\nadopt the view that, “[God’s] consciousness is contingently and\nqualitatively different because of what we do” (Clarke\n1979, 92). At times, Clarke almost sounds like a Whiteheadian or a\nHartshornean: “God is the supreme Receiver, gathering\ntogether in His consciousness all that creatures do and responding\nappropriately to it” (Ibid., 93). Another example of a group of\ntheists influenced by process thinking, are those Evangelical Christian\nphilosophers calling themselves “open theists” or\n“free will theists.” While careful to distance themselves\nfrom the more heretical dimensions of process metaphysics, they have\nstirred controversy in their communities of faith by defending aspects\nof process theism (Pinnock et al. 1994; Enxing 2013, ch. 5). \n\nThe extent to which theists outside the process camp accept the\nelements of the doctrine of dual transcendence varies greatly.\nNeo-Thomists like Clarke and some other theists, like William Alston,\naccept real relations in God but retain the timelessness, immutability,\nand non-corporeality of God. Clarke and Alston also affirm creation\nex nihilo. Alston, who was Hartshorne’s student at Chicago,\nrefers to his view as a “via media” (a middle\npath) between Hartshorne and Aquinas (Cobb & Gamwell 1984, 78f).\nHartshorne responded to both Clarke and Alston (Sia 1990, 269f; Cobb\n& Gamwell 1984, 98f). In both replies he emphasizes, among other\nthings, what he takes to be arbitrary divisions among contingency,\npotentiality, and change in their theories. To admit real relations in\nGod is to admit contingency in God. To admit this, but to retain the\nconcept of the non-temporality of deity, requires belief in\ncontingencies eternally fixed in the being of God. The ordinary sense\nof “W is contingent” is “W could\nhave been otherwise,” which presupposes that the future was once\nopen with respect to W. Since there is no future in eternity,\nto speak of contingency in eternity is to lose one’s anchor in\nordinary language which is saturated with temporal\nreference. Likewise, the concept of an eternal “now” has\nlost all moorings with experience where the present is invariably\nnested between past and future. Hartshorne also maintains that there\nare forms of value—specifically, aesthetic values—that do\nnot admit of a maximum.  It may be no more meaningful to speak of\ngreatest possible aesthetic value than it is to speak of a greatest\npositive integer (Hartshorne 1970, 38 and 310; cf. Whitehead 1978,\n111). If this is the case, and if the creatures contribute to the\naesthetic value of the world, then there must be respects in which, as\nthe aesthetic value of the world increases, God increases with it. We\nhave already touched upon this aspect of process theism which\nHartshorne refers to as God’s relative perfection (R-perfection). \n\nOpenness or free will theists are closer to process theism than the\nNeo-Thomists or than Alston. They concur with process theists that God\ncannot determine a creature’s decisions without depriving it of its\nfreedom. They also accept the process view of the nature of time; thus,\nfor God to be influenced by the creatures means that in some respects\nthe future is yet to be determined and God knows it as such. This\nprovides for a straightforward concept of God responding to the\ncreatures and for an interpretive scheme for the dominant Scriptural\nmotif that God is in dynamic interaction with people (in answering\nprayer, for example). On the other hand, it is this aspect of process\ntheism which seems most disturbing to more traditionally minded\nEvangelicals, for the lack of knowledge of a detailed future\ncompromises or at least complicates the doctrine of divine providence.\nHow, they ask, can history be the working out of a divine plan if the\nfuture is uncertain for God (cf. Hall and Sanders, 2003). Open theists\nbelieve that they can mitigate this criticism by not following process\ntheism in the denial of creation ex nihilo. Open theists like\nWilliam Hasker and John Sanders can speak of God as “a\nrisk-taker,” but they insist that God can still perform miracles\nand guarantee the ultimate triumph of good over evil (Pinnock, et al.,\n1994, 151; Sanders 1998). \n\nTo speak of open theism as a school of thought distinct from process\ntheism is ironic since God’s openness to creaturely influence is\nprecisely the shared content of their views. Hartshorne referred to\n“the openness of God” in 1963, more than thirty years\nbefore the openness controversy erupted (Hartshorne 1987, 92). In any\nevent, these controversies began too late for Hartshorne to respond to\nthem. It is noteworthy, however, that he was instrumental in bringing a\nlittle known forerunner of free will theism, Jules Lequyer [or\nLequier], to the attention of philosophers (Hartshorne & Reese\n2000, 227–230). Because of the dominance historically of\nclassical theism, Hartshorne viewed free will theists more as allies\nthan foes, although he was fully aware of his differences from them and\nwas not without arguments against those aspects of their views with\nwhich he disagreed (Viney 1998, 214–230). A vigorous dialogue between process\ntheists and free will theists is on-going (Cobb and Pinnock\n2000; Ramal 2010, part II). \n\nThe most contentious issue is creation ex nihilo. Whitehead\nand Hartshorne share a commitment to the idea that God is the supreme\ncreative power among many lesser creators. Hartshorne is adamant that\nnothing is gained by endowing God with the ability to create\nnon-creative actualities or to refrain from creating altogether.\nNevertheless, process theists are criticized for failing to consider\nthe alternative that God, the sole origin of creative power, graciously\nshares that power with others. Lequyer speaks of “God, who\ncreated me creator of myself”—words that Hartshorne often\nquotes with approval (Lequier 1952, 70; Hartshorne 1970, xi). Lequyer’s\nview is similar to what Nelson Pike calls “over-power,” the\npower to “completely determine which, if any, powers are\npossessed by agents other than oneself” (Pike 1983, 19). Pike\navers that over-power is precisely what most classical theists ascribe\nto deity. Process theists generally disagree (cf. Griffin 1991, 67–68).\nFor example, Aquinas views God as having the ability to determine the\nfree decisions of others, but this ability is not entailed by\nover-power, although Pike sometimes defines over-power in these terms\n(Pike 1982, 151). If God has over-power in the sense of being able to\ndetermine the extent to which others can make free decisions and\nexecute them, it does not follow that God can also determine a\ncreature’s free decisions. The latter claim is much stronger, and it is\nthe one that process theists attribute to most classical theists. \n\nThe process God has what might be called a second cousin to\nover-power. As we have seen, in process theism, God is responsible for\nthe laws of nature and these laws determine the limits of non-divine\ncreativity. Whitehead and Hartshorne deny, however, that God could\ncreate actual entities devoid of creative activity. Moreover,\ndevelopmental and evolutionary categories are central to their\nthinking. It is contrary to process philosophy to imagine God with the\nability to create a fully grown man or woman who did not grow to\nadulthood from having been a child. One’s being actual is\ninseparable from one’s having become actual (Hartshorne 1941,\n233–234). Hartshorne would say that this is also true of God’s actual\nstates, though not of God’s existence. These qualifications\nnotwithstanding, one philosopher working within the process tradition\nadvocates revisions in process theism that would move it in the\ndirection that the critics suggest.  Rem Edwards speaks of divine\nself-limitation in creating the creatures.  For Edwards, God could\ncreate a universe of uncreative beings but chooses not to. He thinks\nthat God could “work an occasional miracle or two.”\nEdwards acknowledges that, from the standpoint of\n“orthodox” process thought, these ideas are “process\nheresy,” but he prefers revising process theism in these ways in\norder to avoid the charge, which he regards as legitimate, that there\nis a “divine power-deficit” in process theism that makes\nits outlook “religiously intolerable” (Edwards 2001,\n256). \n\nThe claim that deity sharing its creative power is an instance of\nself-limitation can perhaps be clarified and placed more in the spirit\nof process theism by referring to it as divine self-augmentation. A\nself-imposed handicap is one that prevents one from achieving a goal or\nperforming a task that one could accomplish without the limitation. As\nInbody notes, any divine self-limitation can be\n“self-unlimited” (Inbody 1997, 149). For example, a\ngovernor on a truck can be designed to inhibit the velocity it could\nattain without the governor. In creating other creators, however, the\ndeity imposes no limits on what it could achieve without them. To be\nsure, God could have unerring knowledge of a determinate future if the\ncreatures had no freedom, but this would not be knowledge of a future\nwith free creatures in it. To imagine a limitation in this case would\nrequire that God could know the future decisions of free creatures, but\nchooses instead to put on a blindfold, so to speak. On the other hand,\nthe existence of non-divine creators opens opportunities for\ncooperative effort (and conflict) that would be impossible without\nthem. One cannot use persuasion on completely unfree beings. Thus, in\ncreating other creators, other beings with some degree of freedom, God\nwould be perfecting the divine power and the uses to which it can be\nput. \n\nEdwards also affirms a version of the doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo and believes that this is compatible with process theism.\nInspired by developments in speculative cosmology among\nastrophysicists—which he insists is really\nmetaphysics—Edwards asks whether our universe may not be one of\nmany actual universes existing within an infinite Superspacetime. This\nsuper matrix of co-existing but independent universes could be\ninterpreted by process theism as the divine body, much as Hartshorne\nviews our universe as God’s body. Edwards maintains that these ideas\nallow for a concept of creation ex nihilo. Within the divine\nSuperspacetime, God can create universes from no pre-existing\nmaterial.  Thus, it is not necessary to conceive our own universe as\ncreated from the dying embers of a previous cosmic epoch. The initial\nsingularity of our universe could represent an absolute\nbeginning. This does not mean that one must jettison the claims of\nprocess theism that God is necessarily social, embodied, and\ncreative. In Edwards’ words: \n\nEdwards notes that his suggestions are not as far removed from the\nmetaphysics of Whitehead and Hartshorne as one might suppose. Whitehead\nspeaks of cosmic epochs and Hartshorne argues that this involves a time\nbeyond what is available to physics that connects various cosmic epochs\n(Hartshorne 1970, 53–54). Edwards views himself as amending\nHartshorne’s idea to include super space as well as super time. \n\nEdwards’ treatment of creation ex nihilo retains the\nessential meaning of the idea—creation from no pre-existing\nmaterial—but it also suggests both less and more than the\nconcept as it was expressed in classical theism. It suggests less in\nthe sense that God’s creative act in traditional theism takes place in\neternity. Superspacetime differs from the Boethian idea of eternity in\nat least this much: it is complex whereas eternity has no parts.\nEdwards also wishes to avoid the deterministic connotations of the\ntraditional idea of creation. To create another creator is not\nto create that creator’s decisions; this is one reason Aquinas denies\nthat God creates other creators, for he regards God as creating, with\nus, the decisions we make in such a way that God’s activity is a\nsufficient explanation of our decisions (although he denies, contrary\nto the charge of process theism, that this deprives us of our freedom).\nFinally, Edwards imports more into the idea of creation ex\nnihilo than was traditionally in the doctrine. As we noted in the\nopening section, the idea that the universe had a first temporal moment\nis not to be identified with creation ex nihilo since,\naccording to traditional theism, God could have created a temporally\ninfinite universe ex nihilo. \n\nEdwards’ revisions of process theism are made largely, though not\nexclusively, in light of criticisms from those who do not share his\ncommitment to process metaphysics. Lewis Ford revises process theism in\na very different direction, mostly in response to difficulties within\nprocess metaphysics that he finds insurmountable. We have already seen\nthat in Whitehead’s metaphysics, the way that one actual entity\ninfluences another is by means of prehensions. According to Ford, an\nadditional mode of influence must be posited, for one must account for\nan actual entity’s ability to prehend. This ability to prehend\nis precisely its portion of creativity. Ford remains within the\nparameters of process metaphysics by denying that the entity’s\nallotment of creativity has its source outside of time in an eternal\nbeing. This leaves only three possible sources for the entity’s\ncreativity, the past, the present, or the future. Ford maintains that\npast actual entities, because they are past, are devoid of any inner\ncreativity—thus, they cannot be the source of an actual\nentity’s creativity. Nor can creativity simply “well up”\nfrom within the present. It is precisely an actual occasion’s\npresent creativity that needs explanation, and it cannot pull\nitself up by its own bootstraps, so to speak. Ford argues, by\nelimination, that a future creativity must be the source of an\noccasion’s ability to prehend. \n\nIn process metaphysics, the future is infinite, indeterminate, and\nits possibilities for actualization are inexhaustible. Ford identifies\nGod with the future so conceived, but with one important departure from\nstandard accounts in process thought. According to Ford, God is the\nactivity of the future. This is contrary to the views of Whitehead\nand Hartshorne for whom the future is the arena of possibility awaiting\ndecision. Creative activity is confined to the present actual entity\n(called its concrescence) and to its effects on subsequent actual\nentities (called transitional creativity) (Whitehead 1978, 211). In\nFord’s view, however, the future is a soundless depth of creativity\nthat endlessly “pluralizes itself into the many finite regions of\nthe present” (Ford 2000, 248). This is a process whereby divine\nfuture activity is “infused” into the present actual\noccasion (Ibid., 253). In Ford’s view, present activity makes the\npast in the sense that what is done today adds to what will be the\naccomplished past of tomorrow. The present is not made by the past but\nby the divine activity of the future. \n\nBecause the divine is indeterminate, it cannot be an object of an\nactual entity’s prehensions. This is dangerously close to saying that\nGod cannot be known, except that Ford understands God to fill a\ndefinite role in his metaphysics, to wit, the infusion of creativity\ninto the present, providing for an immediacy of the divine presence in\nall actualities. Ford also recognizes the difficulty that his view\nposes for God’s knowledge of the past, and hence for divine\nomniscience. The physical prehensions of actual occasions are not only\nthe means whereby the present takes account of the past, but they are\nalso the means whereby the past persists into the present. As\nHartshorne notes, Whitehead’s concept of prehension brings efficient\ncausation and perception under a single category (Hartshorne 1984b,\nchapter 9). If the past were to persist into the future so as to impart\nknowledge to God, it would co-opt the present’s function of preserving\nthe past. In order to avoid the idea that God is ignorant of the past,\nFord posits a kind of knowledge of the past that abstracts from\nefficient causation. In the interstices separating the death of the\npast moment and the birth of the present moment, “God immediately\nperceives the recently emergent past and retains that memory\nforever” (Ford 2000, 284). Since divine memory, on Ford’s\naccount, abstracts from efficient causal relations, it is clear that it\nrecords sequences and correlations of events; it is a fair question\nwhether it also contains information about causal chains. \n\nFord recognizes that his revisions of process theism will strike\nsome thinkers as contrary to the metaphysics that first inspired it. He\ncorrectly observes, “The notion of an active future may be\nregarded as oxymoronic, even as bizarre, but it is certainly\nunique” (Ford 2000, 316). It is indeed unique; it bears a\nresemblance to the Thomistic doctrine of participated being, albeit\ntailored to the categories of process philosophy, as modified in\nvarious ways by Ford. In Thomism, the creatures can exist only by\nparticipating in and channeling the infinite creativity of God. In\nFord’s revised process theism, non-divine actual entities can exist\nonly by borrowing the influx of future divine activity into the\npresent. The parallel with Thomism breaks down insofar as Ford denies\nthat God’s activity explains what the actual entities do with their\nportion of creativity. Ford can affirm the freedom of the creatures\nvis-a-vis God’s activity since deity does not function as a\ndeterministic efficient cause as it does in Thomism and other forms of\ntraditional theism. In Whitehead’s and Hartshorne’s theism, there is an\nefficient causal dimension to God’s creativity, but it is not\ndeterministic. We have already noted that the process God’s fixing of\nthe laws of nature is a form of efficient causation, but Whitehead and\nHartshorne agree with most current scientific thinking that those laws\nare stochastic. \n\nOur task has been to explain the concept of process theism, not to\nargue that the God of process theism exists. Nevertheless, a few words\nare in order about the approaches that process theists take to\njustifying belief in the existence of God. We noted in opening that\nprocess theism does not privilege claims to special insight or\nrevealed truth (cf. Keller 2007, chapter 6). This is not to say that\nsome theologians have not found process thought congenial to their\ninterests (e.g., Ogden 1963; Cobb 1965; Griffin 1973). Whitehead and\nHartshorne did not view themselves as apologists for a particular\nfaith, but neither did they simply dismiss religious experiences as\nuninformative. Whitehead warns against narrowness in the selection of\nevidence. He says, “Philosophy may not neglect the\nmultifariousness of the world—the fairies dance, and Christ is\nnailed to the cross” (Whitehead 1978, 338).  They add, however,\nthat the claims that religious people make, individually (as in the\ncase of mystics) or collectively (as in the case of religious\norganizations), are subject to human fallibility. There may be a God\nwho is infallible but human beings are not, and every putative\nrevelation is sifted through an imperfect human filter (Hartshorne\n1984a, 41). As far as justifying religious belief is concerned,\nWhitehead and Hartshorne try to navigate between appeals to blind\nfaith and knock-down proof. In metaphysics, says Whitehead, “The\nproper test is not that of finality, but of progress” (Whitehead\n1978, 14). \n\nIf process theism is not based on revelation, neither is it based on\nnaïve appeals to science, including the social sciences. It is no\nmore characteristic of process thought to give a\n“scientific” argument for the existence of God than to\ngive a reductionistic account of religious belief by means of a theory\nin sociology or psychology. As far as Whitehead and Hartshorne are\nconcerned, the working assumptions of the sciences are no more or less\nopen to question and clarification than the working assumptions of religion. Process thought\nteaches a modest skepticism about the competencies of science that is\narguably in the spirit of science itself. Indeed, the theory of actual\nentities and their prehensions is Whitehead’s alternative to the\nmetaphysical worldview that developed as a result of the dramatic\nsuccesses of early modern science—Whitehead calls it\n“scientific materialism.” The theory of actual entities is\na response to the idea that the “stuff” of which the world\nis made is devoid of mind-like qualities—Whitehead refers to\nthis as “vacuous actuality.” The theory of prehensions is\na response to the idea that bits of matter can exist at definite\nplaces and times without any essential reference to other places and\ntimes—Whitehead refers to this as “simple location.”\nThe fact is that Whitehead wrote relatively little about God and a\ngreat deal about how his philosophy of organism resolves problems of\nmetaphysics and epistemology inherited from a prior age. \n\nProcess theism is not based on religious doctrine or theology and it\nis not a scientific theory; it is a product of metaphysics, or what\nWhitehead calls “speculative philosophy.” It is, however,\nmetaphysics “in a new key,” to borrow a phrase from Susanne\nLanger. Whitehead says that, “Speculative philosophy is the\nendeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of general\nideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be\ninterpreted” (Whitehead 1978, 3). Metaphysics, so defined, is an\naudacious enterprise, for experience is open-ended and every claim to\nknowledge is perspectival and conditioned. If metaphysicians strive for\na comprehensive vision of things, they must continually remind\nthemselves that there is no standpoint within the world from which to\nspeak confidently for eternity. Whitehead and Hartshorne reject the\nidea that metaphysics proceeds best by deducing theorems from\nself-evident axioms. To be sure, inferences must be made from the\ncategories of one’s metaphysics, but it is the categories themselves\nthat are continually on trial. The court in which metaphysical\nproposals are judged is the community of philosophers, stretching\nthrough history and into the future. Whitehead and Hartshorne, heavily\ninfluenced by Plato, practice philosophy as a dialogue with great\nminds, past and present. Hartshorne, taking a page from Karl Popper,\nsays that, “Objectivity is not in the individual thinker but in\nthe process of mutual correction and inspiration” (Hartshorne\n1962, ix). \n\nWhen it comes to the “God question” Whitehead says that\nhe is not offering proofs. “There is merely the confrontation of\nthe theoretic system with a certain rendering of the facts”\n(Whitehead 1978, 343). Having established to his satisfaction an\nalternative to scientific materialism—that is, the philosophy\nof organism—he asks whether that philosophy’s categories\nrequire reference to God. Ford suggests that Whitehead was surprised to\nfind that they do, for he began his reflections on the philosophy of\nnature as an agnostic (Ford 1977, 27). In keeping with his sensitivity\nto the history of philosophy, Whitehead characterizes his discussion as\nadding another speaker to David Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion. If Whitehead has an “argument” for the\nexistence of God it is implicit in the dual attempt (1) to show the\nreasonableness of process metaphysics and (2) to show the conceptual\nnecessity of God for its overall coherence. Rudolf Carnap says that it\nis one thing to ask what one’s metaphysics commit one to and it is\nsomething else to ask what commits one to one’s metaphysics. Whitehead\nasks both questions. \n\nFord rightly says that, in Whitehead’s writings, the problem and\nnature of God is nowhere explored for its own sake (Ford 1970,\n393). Moreover, during the period when he was introducing the concept\nof God into his metaphysics, beginning in 1925, the very concept of\nGod was in flux. For these reasons, there is an inherent flexibility\nin reconstructing arguments for God’s existence from Whitehead’s work,\nand this is reflected in the critical literature. Hartshorne\nidentified six arguments implicit in Whitehead’s metaphysics\n(Hartshorne 1972, 78–88), but others find fewer (Sherburne 1971) or\nmore (Griffin 2001a, chapter 5). Ford attempted to derive the\nexistence of God analytically, as a theorem from the set of axioms in\nWhitehead’s categoreal scheme in Process and Reality; his\nmuch abbreviated version of Whitehead’s reasoning is this:\n“Actual entities either belong to God or to the World. Given the\nWorld, God must exist. Given God, the World must exist. Since one or\nthe other must exist, both must” (Ford 1970,\n393). Interestingly, the God to which Ford’s reconstructed argument\nconcludes is a single non-temporal actual entity, and no mention is\nmade of developments in Whitehead’s idea of God after Process and\nReality. \n\nMore traditional forms of reasoning can also be found in\nWhitehead. There cannot, to be sure, be a cosmological argument in the\nclassical sense for Whitehead rejects the traditional idea of divine\ncreativity, but he does see a need to explain the initial phase of\neach actual entity. In Whitehead’s view, God customizes the general\npotentiality of the universe for each emergent occasion, providing it\nwith its initial aim. The graded relevance of these potentialities\nanswers to our sense that there are objectively better and worse\noptions. A related problem is how the activities of the many\nactualities that make up the cosmos happen to obey a common set of\nnatural laws. Order implies an ordering power; however, all localized\norder presupposes cosmic order; thus, order on a cosmic scale requires\na cosmic ordering power. The best candidate for the cosmic ordering\npower is God, according to Whitehead (Whitehead 1997, 104)—this\nis a type of design argument. Another consideration is that the realm\nof possibility in terms of which cosmic order is conceived is akin to\nPlato’s Forms. In Whitehead’s system, these “eternal\nobjects” require an ontological ground. The primordial nature of\nGod serves this function (Whitehead 1978, 46).  Finally, the\nconsequent nature of God is the explanation of the fixity of\naccomplished fact and achieved value. “The truth itself is\nnothing else than how the composite natures of the organic actualities\nof the world obtain adequate representation in the divine\nnature” (Whitehead 1978, 12). This sketch of Whitehead’s\nreasoning may suggest that his “arguments” lose their\nforce when abstracted from his metaphysics. Bowman L. Clarke, however,\nproduced a formal theistic argument along Whiteheadian lines using the\nlinguistic framework developed by Nelson Goodman (Clarke 1966,\n162–164). In a different vein, Franklin Gamwell argues that the moral\nlaw must be grounded in the divine good, where the divine\ngood is most parsimoniously conceived in neoclassical terms\n(Gamwell 1990). Another process thinker, Derek Malone-France, argues\nthat the promise of Kant’s transcendental philosophy is best fulfilled\nin a Whiteheadian inspired theistic metaphysics (Malone-France\n2007). Thus, arguing for the existence of Whitehead’s God, or\nsomething like Whitehead’s God, need not be inextricably tied to\nevaluating Whitehead’s metaphysics. \n\nThe debate among Whiteheadians over the existence of God is\ncomplicated by the fact that Whitehead’s views rapidly evolved from\nthe time he began teaching at Harvard in 1924. His view of God is less\na completed philosophical theism than a work in progress that was\nleft to others to try to complete, and many have tried. It is worthy\nof note, however, that an influential group of scholars maintain that\nWhitehead was not true to his finer insights when he included God in\nhis metaphysical system. Donald Sherburne wrote a pivotal article in\n1967, revised in 1971, titled “Whitehead without God.”\nSherburne holds that God can be “exorcised” from\nWhitehead’s metaphysics by showing that the existence of God is\ninconsistent with its categories and by demonstrating that all of the\nfunctions ascribed to deity in the system can be met in other ways.\nDonald Crosby and Frederick Ferré (1933–2013), also within the\nprocess fold, hold similar views. Ferré considers theism\n“optional” in the sense that the premises of theistic\narguments are subject to competing and equally rational value\ncommitments (Ferré 2001, 177f). One of the most careful and\npersistent critics of process theism is Robert Neville (Neville\n1980). Neville does not argue for “Whitehead without God”\nso much as “Whitehead without Whitehead’s God.” He\nbelieves that Whitehead’s critique of scientific materialism and his\nphilosophy of organism are basically correct, but that the ultimate\nexplanation of the universe is in a deity that wholly transcends it\nand creates it ex nihilo (Neville 1968). Griffin forcefully\ncriticized Neville’s views (Griffin 2007, 186–214) and Neville gave a\nspirited response (Neville 2008). \n\nHartshorne was more in the mainstream of philosophical discussions\nabout God than was Whitehead. He spoke of proofs for God’s existence\nand defended them vigorously, although he ceased calling them\n“proofs” when he realized the differences between his\napproach and more traditional ones. Hartshorne is best known for his\nvoluminous writings on the ontological argument—he devotes two\nbooks and numerous articles to the topic (Hartshorne 1962 & 1965a).\nDespite his fondness for his revised ontological argument, he never\nconsidered it sufficient unto itself to make the case for God’s\nexistence. The ontological argument is one strand of a multiple\nargument strategy—which Basil Mitchell calls a\n“cumulative case”—in which the various elements are\nmutually reinforcing. \n\nHartshorne’s versions of the cosmological, teleological (or design),\nmoral, epistemic, and aesthetic arguments complete the set that make up\nthe global argument (Viney 1985). \n\nIn Hartshorne’s view, the importance of the ontological argument is\nto establish that God could not exist contingently. He calls this\n“Anselm’s principle.” If Anselm’s principle is correct then\nif it is possible for God to exist, then God necessarily\nexists. In Hartshorne’s view, Anselm failed to make a convincing case\nfor God’s existence because he failed to show that his concept of God\nis coherently conceivable. Indeed, Hartshorne believes that matters are\nmuch worse for Anselm since he considers Anselm’s form of theism to be\nincoherent, as we have seen. Hartshorne believes that the other\narguments in his own global argument make the case for God’s possible\nexistence. Contingent beings require a divine necessary being\n(cosmological); cosmic order implies a divine cosmic ordering power\n(design); reality should be construed as the actual content of divine\nknowledge (epistemic); the supreme aim in life is to contribute to the\ndivine life (moral); and there is a beauty of the world as a whole that\nonly God can enjoy (aesthetic). The structure of Hartshorne’s argument\nis reminiscent of the elaborate case made by John Duns Scotus in De\nPrimo Principio. Of course, the God whose existence Hartshorne\nseeks to establish is one that “the subtle doctor” would\nfind unacceptable. \n\nHartshorne presents each of the sub-arguments within his cumulative\ncase as a list of options from an exhaustive set, with his neoclassical\ntheistic option rounding out the set. For example, the options in the\ndesign argument are printed as follows (Hartshorne 1970, 281): \n\nThe first three options are the atheistic ones and the last one (T)\nis Hartshorne’s view. The reason for listing the arguments in this way\nis to avoid the pretense of settling important questions by logic\nalone. The conclusion of any valid\ndeductive argument can be rejected provided one is willing to reject\none or more of the premises. In this sense, a valid argument provides\none with options for belief rather than a proof of its conclusion.\nHartshorne denies that one can coerce belief in God with arguments such\nas this. Moreover, he acknowledges that his own choice for neoclassical\ntheism is not without its difficulties. He maintains, therefore, that\none should employ the “principle of least paradox” in\nassessing the options. Since no metaphysical position is without its\nproblems, it will not do to argue for one’s own view by finding the\nproblems in the views of others. “One must decide which paradoxes\nare the really fatal ones, in comparison with those of contending\npositions” (Hartshorne 1970, 88). \n\nHartshorne presents his theistic arguments as a priori, not\nin the sense that they are conclusive demonstrations, but in the sense\nthat they aim at a conclusion about what is true in all possible states\nof affairs. In this he is true to Whitehead’s metaphysical project of\nfinding categories that are universal and necessary. He insists that\nnone of the conclusions of his arguments are empirical. A proposition\nis empirical, in Popper’s sense, if it is falsifiable by some\nconceivable experience. If Anselm’s principle is correct then either\nGod exists without the possibility of not existing or God’s existence\nis impossible. Thus, if God exists, then no conceivable experience\ncould falsify the statement that God exists. For this reason,\nHartshorne finds all empirical arguments—and hence, all\nscientifically based arguments—for God’s existence to be\nfatally flawed since they must conclude to that which is\nnot God, that is, to that which exists contingently. Hartshorne also\npoints out that none of his arguments tell us anything concrete about\nGod. True to his distinction between existence and actuality,\nHartshorne maintains that the arguments concern that which is most\nabstract about deity, its existence and character. This is why\nHartshorne claimed to know so very little about God, even though he\nwrote so many volumes on the subject (Hartshorne & Viney 2001,\n46). \n\nAfter his ninetieth birthday, Hartshorne emphasized a somewhat\ndifferent approach in arguing for God’s existence that incorporates his\nideas about dual transcendence (Hartshorne 1993; Hartshorne 2011b). He notes that\nfrom a purely formal point of view, any pair of metaphysical contraries\nmay apply to God or to the world. For example, either God is in\ndifferent respects necessary and contingent (NC), wholly necessary (N),\nwholly contingent (C), or neither necessary nor contingent (O). The\nsame is true of the world: necessary and contingent (nc), wholly\nnecessary (n), wholly contingent (c), or neither necessary nor\ncontingent (o). This yields sixteen formal options which Hartshorne\narranges in a four by four matrix. Historically significant forms of\ntheism can be found on the matrix—classical theism, for\nexample, is N.c and free will theism is NC.c. Only one of the sixteen\noptions can be true, so Hartshorne develops criteria for judging the\nvarious possibilities. For example, if the contrast itself should be\npreserved, then options like N.n, C.c, and O.o are unacceptable. Of\ncourse, Hartshorne’s conclusion is that NC.nc is the true option.\nArguably, the value of these matrices is as much in mapping concepts of\nGod and the world as it is in arguing for a particular option, for they\nallow a more detailed idea of the views that contradict one’s own.\nHartshorne maintains that one reason classical theism remained\nunchallenged for so long was because philosophers had not considered\nall of the options (Hartshorne 1997, ch. 5). If any two matrices\nare combined, the number of formal options jumps to 256. If we\ngeneralize for any number of pairs n, then the number of\nconcepts of God and the world is 16n. \n\nWe have already mentioned others within the process tradition who have\nmade the case for process theism: Clarke, Gamwell, and\nMalone-France. Schubert Ogden (1963) and David Ray Griffin (2001a and\n2016) should be added to the list. Griffin explicitly employs a\ncumulative case involving eight strands; his argument is indebted to\nboth Whitehead and Hartshorne but includes his own distinctive\ncontributions. Having found the alternatives to process theism\nunsatisfactory, Griffin maintains that “process\nphilosophy’s naturalistic theism is overwhelmingly more\nprobable than the truth of atheism” (2001a, 203). Also of note\nis that Griffin is one of the few process philosophers to have\naddressed the arguments in the literature of the new atheism\n(although, see Viney and Shields forthcoming, chapter 7). \n\nWith Hartshorne, as with Whitehead, what is at stake in theistic\narguments is less a matter of the soundness of a particular piece of\nreasoning than the assessment of an entire metaphysical system. Thus,\nthe sketch given here does not begin to do justice to their arguments.\nNevertheless, the development and defense of a concept of God that is\nfully engaged in temporal processes is perhaps the central pillar and\nthe lasting achievement of their reasoning. After all, one of the\nselling points of process theism over its rivals has been not only its\ntheoretical superiority in dealing with theological puzzles but its\nadequacy to everyday religious sensibilities. Process theists argue\nthat the deity of traditional theism is at once too active and too\nstatic. It is too active in the sense that its control of the universe\nis absolute, leaving nothing for the creatures to do except to\nunwittingly speak the lines and play the parts decided for them in\neternity. It is too static in the sense that it lacks potentiality to\nchange, to participate in the evolving universe it created, and to be\naffected by the triumphs and tragedies of its creatures. In short, it\nis a God who acts but is never acted upon and can therefore never\ninteract. This is summed up in the non-biblical Aristotelian formula\nof God as the unmoved mover. Fritz Rothschild describes the God of\nRabbi Abraham Heschel—a God who feels and is felt by the\ncreatures—as “the Most Moved Mover”\n(Heschel 1959, 24). Hartshorne, who greatly admired Heschel, amends\nthis formula in an attempt to distill the essence of process theism,\n“God is the most and best moved mover”\n(Hartshorne 1997, 6, 39).","contact.mail":"don_viney@yahoo.com","contact.domain":"yahoo.com"}]
