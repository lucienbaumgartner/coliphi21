Many philosophical texts also have a\nhighly polemical style and/or seem deferential to the authoritative\nsources they cite. Further, medieval philosophical thinkers operated\nunder the threat of censure from political and religious authority,\nmoving them, some have argued, to write esoterically or indirectly to\nprotect themselves from persecution for their true views. All these\nliterary and rhetorical features make medieval philosophical texts\nconsiderably more difficult to understand and interpret than modern or\neven classical philosophical texts. Moreover, the broad range of\ngenres used in medieval philosophy raises questions about the nature\nof philosophical writing in general when compared to the much more\nrestricted set of accepted forms in modern and contemporary\nphilosophical works.\n\nMedieval philosophical texts have as their formal sources Greek\ncommentaries, Neoplatonic treatises, dialogues, and allegories, as\nwell as Aristotelian treatises, and the works of Augustine. Before the\nformal development of universities and university curricula that\ndictated the established forms for writing philosophical/theological\ntexts in the 13th century, medieval philosophical texts were written\nin a wide variety of forms. From the 10th to the 12th century, writers\nin the Christian, Jewish, and Arabic traditions composed dialogues,\nallegories, axiomatic works, disputations, and summae, while the 13th\nand 14th centuries in the Latin West were dominated by commentaries,\nprincipally on Peter Lombard’s Sentences and the works\nof Aristotle, various forms of the disputed question, and the summa.\n \nThe sources and history of these different forms will be discussed\nunder each of the forms considered. After the discussion of the\nprincipal literary forms, the role of authoritative authors and\ninfluence of concerns about censorship and persecution on the form and\nrhetoric of medieval philosophical texts, the historical development\nin these literary forms within the medieval period will be\nconsidered. \nThe models for allegorical writings and allegorizing of traditional\ntexts (allegoresis) come to the Middle Ages through\nNeoplatonic sources and, for Jewish and Arabic thinkers, from\ntraditions of biblical commentary and the Qur’an itself (Shatz\n2003; Ivry 2000). As Ivry puts it, the Qur’an effects “a\nsignificant change in the Biblical legacy, treating individual persons\nand events as universal types and symbols. This approach turns the\nQur’anic presentations of Biblical stories into allegories, the\npersons involved into emblems of virtue or vice” (Ivry 2000,\n155). Jewish philosophers themselves read the Hebrew bible and\nrabbinic literature philosophically, interpreting its stories as\nhaving another, esoteric meaning behind the literal one. The Jewish\nphilosopher Philo is the most important figure in the development of\nthis kind of philosophical allegorization, though his influence is\naccepted to be greater on Christian than Jewish thinkers, most\nsignificantly on Augustine. Nonetheless, Jewish philosophers regularly\nallegorize scripture and are also influenced by allegorical readings\ngiven in rabbinic and midrashic literature (Shatz 2003). Neoplatonic\nwriters developed allegorical readings of both Plato and classical\nliterature, finding in these diverse texts figures of the spiritual\njourney from this world to the next. They also composed their own\nallegories on similar themes. \nThe underlying presupposition of allegory is that things can come to\nstand for something else. For the Neoplatonists this possibility is\nbased on the relationship of material things to the One from which\nthey have emanated. Because things come from the One, they are\nfragmentary reflections of the fullness of that goodness. The\nallegorical interpretation of whole texts rather than particular\nepisodes or images dates from the 3rd century. It is based on the idea\nthat the text as a whole reflects the “Neoplatonic ideology of\n‘organic’ order” in which any part of the\ncomposition or cosmos is a symbol of the One, from which everything\nproceeds (Whitman 2000, 36). Aristotle has a role to play as well: his\ndistinction between demonstrative, dialectical, and rhetorical\nreasoning is used to interpret the Qur’an and to justify\ndifferent types of writing for different audiences. Moreover,\nAristotle’s Poetics is used by Avicenna to justify\nwriting in the form of stories (Whitman 2000, 47–8). For those\nwithin the religious traditions of Judaism, Islam, or Christianity,\nallegory is based on the inspired character of scripture into which\nGod has inserted many layers of meaning. Though Islamic philosophers\nhad an independent religious tradition of allegorical literature from\nwhich they could draw, the allegories from medieval Islamic thinkers\ntend to concern the same Neoplatonic themes of the ascent of the soul\nand the Neoplatonic structure of the cosmos, allegorizing the stages\nof emanation from and return to the One. The most common form of\nIslamic philosophical allegory is on the theme of the heavenly ascent\nor journey, a philosophical rather than prophetic rewriting of the\nspiritual journey of the prophet Mohammed. Avicenna wrote two\nallegories of this type, Risâlat at-tair (Treatise\nof the Bird) and Hayy ibn Yaqzân. (Heath 1992, has\nalso translated from Persian an allegory of Avicenna’s,\nMi’râj Nâma, The Book of the Prophet\nMuhammad’s Ascent to Heaven.) In the Treatise of the\nBird, a group of birds fly on a long journey in search of truth\nover nine mountain ranges, each a dangerous and a tempting resting\nplace; in the second, the narrator, consulting Hayy, a sage, makes a\ncosmic journey from west to east, ending in a vision of God (Avicenna\n1980). Ibn Tufayl’s Hayy ibn Yaqzân takes its\nname from Avicenna’s allegory and claims to reveal in it the\nsecrets of Avicenna’s “Oriental philosophy”\n(Avicenna 1980; Ibn Tufayl 2009). Ibn Tufayl’s version may have\nbeen one of the models for Daniel Defoe’s Robinson\nCrusoe. This story of a boy abandoned on an island and raised by\na gazelle recounts the boy’s survival and progress in\nunderstanding from what is necessary for survival, to a grasp of the\nlaws of the universe, culminating in a mystical experience. The\nboy’s progress symbolizes the path and powers of unaided human\nreason, able to advance from complete ignorance to union with the\ndivine. \nIn the Latin West, philosophical allegory flourished in the 12th\ncentury. Authors like Bernard Silvestris, Thierry of Chartres, William\nof Conches, and Alan of Lille took up allegoresis and allegory as a\nway of assimilating works and ideas from classical antiquity,\nespecially the creation myth and cosmology of Plato’s\nTimaeus. One of the most important, Bernard\nSilvestris’s Cosmographia, is an allegorical account of\nthe origins of the world, both narrative and structural. Bernard tells\nthe story of Natura asking Noys to bring some order to prime matter.\nBook I traces the creation of the material world, and book II, the\ncreation of man (Bernard Silvestris 1973). Bernard’s main source\nfor this myth of creation is Plato’s Timaeus but his\nmyth making is combined with philosophical and scientific speculation.\nLike Alan of Lille’s allegories, De Planctu Naturae and\nAnticlaudianus, Bernard’s work is both allegorical and\nencyclopedic, two forms which were also combined in an important\nclassical model for these works, Martianus Capella’s The\nMarriage of Mercury and Philology. What is remarkable about these\nworks is the combination of allegory with science and philosophy.\nThese writers do not think of the mythic and the scientific as\nopposing discourses. Rather, the creation of new myths is associated\nwith the work of creation, linking the work of God as artifex with\nthat of the composer of allegory. Science and allegory are also linked\nby the activity of de-allegorization, the process of extracting the\nabstract and philosophical message hidden in the allegory. According\nto Brian Stock, until the middle of the 12th century, it was taken as\na given that allegories contained hidden philosophical information\n(Stock 1972, 31). \nThe controversial and difficult question is why these medieval\nthinkers chose the allegorical form, and whether the text can be\nunderstood without its allegorical form. Avicenna tells us that what\nhe purports to do by allegory is to convey one message to the\n“many” in sensible imagery they can understand, while\nconveying a different message to the philosophically minded few (Heath\n1992, 150–153). Neoplatonic and Christian writers, although\nciting the importance of not ‘casting one’s pearls before\nswine’, also cite the need to provide access through the senses\nto a non-sensible reality and the need to use obvious metaphors so\nthat their language will not be taken for a literally true\nrepresentation of the divine. In the secondary literature, the most\ncommon interpretation of the reason for the allegorical form is that\nthe allegory is an heuristic device that makes the difficult and\nabstract message easier to understand. On this view, the allegorical\nform can be stripped away without changing the meaning of the text.\nOthers have argued that for some writers, the allegorical form is\nchosen because the mystical message or account of spiritual union with\nthe good exceeds what can be expressed in the literal language of\nlogic and argument (Sweeney 2006, 38–61, 157–175). Some\nhave argued, further, that the indirection of Maimonides’\nGuide, for example, is based both on the inability to\nrepresent the divine nature but also, failing that, designed to\ntransform the reader making his/her way to God (Whitman 2000, 51;\nHarvey 1988, 69–71). On this view, the allegorical form is an\nessential aspect of the text and, hence, cannot be excised without\ndetriment to the author’s meaning. Lastly, some argue that the\nmotive for allegory is esoteric. On this view, most famously\npropounded by Leo Strauss and his followers, writers fearing\npersecution and misinterpretation decided to “hide” their\ntrue views behind the façade of allegory, in order to protect\nboth themselves and their message. (For more on esotericism, see\nsection 4 below.) \nThis form is not terribly common in the medieval period. Two works\nworthy of mention are Al-Farabi’s political aphorisms and a text\nattributed to Hermes Trismegistus, but thought to have been written in\nthe 12th century by a Christian Neoplatonist, called The Book of\nTwenty-Four Philosophers. This text consists of twenty-four\ndefinitions of God, the most famous of which is, “God is an\ninfinite sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is\nnowhere,” quoted by Alan of Lille, Meister Eckhart, and others\n(Hudry 1997). Al-Farabi’s work, known as “Selected\nAphorisms”, gets this title from its opening lines, in which\nAl-Farabi says the work consists of selected aphorisms from the\nancients (Plato and Aristotle) “concerning that by which cities\nought to be governed and made prosperous...” (Butterworth 2001,\n5–6). This “primer for politics” contains discussion\nof the nature of the soul, virtue, the virtuous regime, and happiness.\nIts disjointed character and the way in which Al-Farabi composes it\nnot from his own views but those of Aristotle and Plato make the form\nof the work central to its meaning: Is Al-Farabi endorsing views but\nwithout saying outright that they are his own because to hold them\nmight be dangerous? What are the principles of selection at work? What\nis not being said? The aphoristic form seems to raise some of the same\nquestions about possible esoteric motivations as does the allegorical\nform. In the case of The Book of the Twenty-Four Philosophers\nthe form seems to derive from the inaccessibility of the divine nature\nto human intellection. Thus, one comes closer to avoiding\nmisrepresentation of the divine nature by using paradoxical or\nmetaphoric formulations rather than literal ones. \nSome medieval works fall somewhere between aphorism and axiom in\ngenre, most significantly works connected to the important and\ninfluential Liber de causis. The Liber circulated as\na work of Aristotle under the title Liber Aristotelis de\nexpositione bonitatis purae until the 13th century, when Thomas\nAquinas found its source in Proclus’s Elements of\nTheology. Like Proclus’s theology, the work seems to\npresent its principles as axioms, but the principles and their\nexplanation/derivation is not really demonstrative and the principles\nthemselves are highly abstract Neoplatonic metaphysical principles\nthat are sometimes as paradoxical as they are self-evident.\nBoethius’s theological opuscule known as De\nHebdomadibus (this work is traditionally the third of five\ntheological tractates) and Alan of Lille’s Regulae Caelestis\nIuris are presented as axiomatic but also esoteric, with the\nexpress statement of the author that their principles are not\naccessible to the many. (See section 2.3 below, on axiom, for more\ndiscussion of these works.) \nThere are two different sources for axiomatic works in the Middle\nAges: Euclid and Proclus. For Proclus the axiomatic form mirrors the\nmetaphysical structure of emanation. As all being emanates from the\nOne, all propositions are derived from axioms. In his commentary on\nEuclid, Proclus contends that the scientific structure in which all\npropositions are proved from first principles is peculiar to the\nmathematical sciences, as befitting the middle status of mathematics\nbetween metaphysics and physics. Two important axiomatic works,\nBoethius’ De Hebdomadibus and Alan of Lille’s\nRegulae Caelestis Iuris, seem to follow both Proclus’s\nElements of Theology, taking Neoplatonic metaphysical\nprinciples as their axioms, and the model of deriving conclusions from\nthose principles, the method Proclus attributes to Euclid and to\nmathematics alone. The axiomatic form in Euclid is more complex,\nrelying not just on first principles (communis animi\nconceptio), the only type of principle used by Boethius and Alan,\nbut also on definitions, petitiones, theorems, etc. Euclid is\nthe model for Nicholas of Amiens’s Ars Catholicae\nFidei. However, even when thinkers like Nicholas of Amiens use\nthe Euclidean axiomatic model, they are still relying on the\njustification and principles of Neoplatonic metaphysics, grounding the\nform in the metaphysics of emanation. \nThe influence of this form goes beyond 12th-century attempts to\ncompose axiomatic philosophical/theological works in the tradition of\nBoethius’s De Hebdomadibus (like Alan’s\nRegulae Caelestis Iuris and Nicholas of Amiens’s\nArs Catholicae Fidei). First, the form is taken up by Leibniz\nin his axiomatic works. Second, early medieval notions of science are\nindebted to these Neoplatonic models of science, models that continue\nto be influential even after the reappearance of Aristotle’s\nPosterior Analytics. Further, the geometric methods of\n“analysis” and “synthesis”\n(“resolutio/compositio”), which work to and from\nfirst principles or axioms and is linked to axiomatic method in both\nits Proclusian and Euclidean forms, is important not only for later\nmedieval thinkers like Aquinas, but also for Descartes, Newton, and\nGalileo (Sweeney 1994).  \nThe ancient tradition of commentary on Aristotle begins with the\nedition of Aristotle by Andronicus of Rhodes, although not much\nsurvives from this period. The study of Aristotle became part of the\nNeoplatonic school curriculum, which began with the\nCategories and progressed through the Organon to the\nPhysics and Metaphysics. The curriculum culminated\nin the study of the Platonic dialogues, ending with the\nTimaeus and Parmenides. This school context for\ncommentaries became part of the commentary texts themselves in\nintroductory remarks to the Aristotelian corpus and to individual\nworks. Thus, authors covered a certain number of introductory\nquestions about the context for studying Aristotle and the particular\nAristotelian work under consideration, responses which assume the\nNeoplatonic curriculum. (For more on the ancient commentary tradition,\nsee Sorabji 1990.) The greatest influence in the Middle Ages, both\nLatin and Islamic, is the Neoplatonic tradition of commentary\nbeginning with Porphyry. Porphyry authored a work, no longer extant,\nshowing the ultimate harmony of Plato and Aristotle. In his commentary\non the Peri Hermeneias, Boethius repeated the same view and\nthe ambition to prove it through his work of translation and\ncommentary (Boethius Com. in lib. Peri hermeneias,\n79–80). Porphyry also originates the view of\nAristotle’s Categories as about words not things, and\nmore specifically as about words as they apply to sensible things,\nthus leaving open the possibility that words might operate in a very\ndifferent way when they refer to Platonic forms (Marenbon 1999,\n107–116). This view of the categories as categories of words is\nalso transmitted by Boethius to the Middle Ages where it becomes\nstandard. The larger view of Aristotle’s teachings enshrined in\nthis interpretive shift is that Aristotle and Plato’s view can\nboth be true, and hence, harmonious, if they are understood as writing\nabout different things, Aristotle about the sublunary world and Plato\nabout the world beyond matter and change. Throughout the Middle Ages,\nthere is some degree of Neoplatonic distortion of Aristotle’s\nteaching in commentaries on his works. It tends to be less significant\nin the logical works and in the non-theological portions of the\nPhysics and greater in De Anima and sometimes\nMetaphysics commentaries.  \nThe placement of Aristotelian works in this kind of context is\ntransmitted to the Latin Middle Ages by Boethius. Boethius thus brings\nto the medieval tradition of commentary both the obvious and more\nsubtle Neoplatonic distortions of the Aristotelian corpus. First,\nBoethius’s commentaries are highly indebted to Neoplatonic\nsources. The thesis that Boethius simply copied his commentaries from\na single codex’s collection of Greek commentators’ remarks\nis too extreme, but it is nevertheless clear that Boethius relied\nheavily on Neoplatonic sources. We can see this in his commentary on\nthe Categories, where we have all of Boethius’s\nsources. Here Boethius uses Porphyry as his main source, while\nsupplementing this material with other Neoplatonic sources (Ebbesen\n1990, 376–77). Had Boethius managed to get to the\nPhysics or Metaphysics for commentary, we might have\nseen his own Neoplatonic interpretations of Aristotle emerge more\nstrongly. As it is, such leanings are evident, for example, in his\ncommentary on the Peri Hermeneias. In his discussion of\nfuture contingents, Boethius follows the Neoplatonists, arguing for\nthe view that while there is real contingency in the sublunary world,\nthere is also necessity operating at other levels. Though he does not\nargue for providence until writing his Consolation, he does\nmake room for such a possibility in his Peri Hermeneias\ncommentary. There he argues, following Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nthat some things are necessitated, some subject to human control, and\nsome are matters of chance; Aristotle is right that some things are\nundetermined, yet the Stoics are also right that some things are\nnecessitated and all things, though not necessitated by it, are\nsubject to the divine will (Boethius 1880, 220–236, Sweeney\n2006, 16–20; Chadwick 1981, 159–63). Thus, Boethius\nfollows the Neoplatonic strategy of placing Aristotle’s view\ninto a larger philosophical context where it can be seen as part of\nbut not the whole truth. \nAverroes (Ibn Rushd), who comes to be known as “the\nCommentator” in the Latin West because of his magisterial grasp\nof Aristotle, is another important influence on the medieval\ncommentary tradition. He declares on numerous occasions that his aim\nin commenting on Aristotle is to explain the Aristotelian text, a task\nhe adheres to faithfully and with great success even though he lacked\nany knowledge of Greek. He does not introduce non-Aristotelian\nmaterial to explain Aristotle; he does not even, for example, make\nreference to Porphyry’s introduction to the Categories,\nthe Isagoge, to help make sense of the Categories.\nHe does, however, add to the Aristotelian text in two ways. First and\nmost ubiquitously, he divides Aristotle’s text into sections and\nchapters, some of which follow the divisions we now have, some of\nwhich he devises himself. The origin of the modern textual divisions\nof Aristotle’s work is not known and those divisions are not\nauthoritative. Averroes may have worked with a text that contained no\ndivisions at all; thus he would have had to supply them all\n(Butterworth 1983, 6–8). Further, Averroes adds explanations of\naspects of Aristotle’s text that are especially unclear or\nterse, and adds references to other works in the Aristotelian corpus\nto help explain particular texts. Averroes, like other ancient and\nmedieval commentators, assumed that there was no significant change or\ndevelopment in Aristotle’s views over time and therefore that\nhis different works are consistent with each other. \nAverroes wrote three different kinds of commentaries, which have come\nto be known as “short,” “middle,” and\n“long” commentaries. Scholars have now shown that these\nterms, though used to describe various kinds of commentary by Averroes\nor his editors, are often very fluid and do not mark off clear cut\ngenres (Gutas 1993, 31–42). Nonetheless, it is clear that\nAverroes composes different kinds of commentaries to serve different\npedagogical goals. He writes summaries or synopses of\nAristotle’s works, as well as full-blown commentaries. Some\ncommentaries work toward an explanation of the letter of the text; in\nthese the source text is first cited and then interpreted virtually\nword for word. This is done sometimes in the form of a continuous\ntext, other times in the form of marginal notations to the main text.\nStill other commentaries, the type traditionally known as\n“middle” commentaries, are explanations of the sense\nrather than the letter, paraphrasing rather than commenting thoroughly\non the source text (Gutas 1993, 33–5). \nIn the Latin West during the 12th and 13th centuries the goal of\ncommentary was to explain the author’s intention. However, until\nthe end of the 13th century, commentators worked on the assumption\nthat the author intended to express the truth; thus every effort was\nmade to bring an author’s text into harmony with the truth as\nthe author understands it from what he takes to be authoritative\nsources. This attitude toward texts is generally thought to emerge\nfrom the tradition of biblical exegesis, where the biblical text is\nassumed to be true, to be in accord with the basic articles of faith,\nand, hence, as needing to be interpreted from within those parameters.\nMoreover, as interpreters began to collect different interpretations\nof biblical texts, they tended to deal with conflicts between\nauthorities by attempting to harmonize different opinions rather than\nsimply keeping some and discarding others. So, in an analogous way,\nfor example, Aquinas supports Aristotle’s astronomy even in the\nface of conflicting mathematical evidence from Ptolemy. He argues that\nPtolemy’s account “saves the appearances” but may\nnot in fact be true since the phenomena could be saved in some other\nway (Aquinas 1964, I, lec. 3; Lohr 1982, 93–94). Also, Aquinas\ntries to save Aristotle from unambiguously holding the position that\nthe world is eternal, arguing that Aristotle’s argument for the\neternity of motion might be merely hypothetical (Aquinas 1964, Bk. I,\nlec. 29). In general, medieval Latin commentators through the 13th\ncentury rarely abandon the principle that the text makes some kind of\nsense. Thus, even when the Aristotelian text is extremely cryptic,\ncorrupt, or terse, commentators make every effort to give the text a\nclear and consistent sense, even if it must be almost completely\nconstructed. A very striking example of the commentator’s art in\nthis regard is Aquinas’s commentary on Aristotle’s De\nAnima, especially his commentary on the very difficult passages\non the workings of the intellect (De Anima III, 5; Aquinas\n1994, III, lec. 7–10). As Kenny and Pinborg note, Ockham\njustified a less literal reading of Aristotle by asserting that\nAristotle often speaks metaphorically; at the other extreme, Latin\nAverroists offered views that might be seen as contrary to Church\nteaching by maintaining that they were only interpreting Aristotle,\nnot developing their own view (Kenny and Pinborg 1982, 29–30). A\nless dramatic but nonetheless important change introduced by medieval\ncommentators, continuing in commentaries after 1300, is making\ndivisions of the text and adding descriptions of the overall structure\nand forward progression of its arguments. These divisions and outlines\nof the text serve to give unity and coherence to a text even if it\nmight lack these features on its own. \nStarting in 1255, study in the work of the arts faculty at Paris was\nofficially centered around the works of Aristotle. Further, the\ncommentaries of the masters of arts rather than of theology brought a\ndifferent hermeneutic to the interpretation of Aristotle. No longer\ncommitted to Aristotle as a source for the truth (the truth was\npossessed by theology), the masters of arts did not try to bring\nAristotle into harmony with other authoritative sources and felt free\nto expose rather than try to save Aristotle from holding what they\ntook to be erroneous positions. Because Aristotle was no longer\nconsidered an essentially error-free authoritative source,\ncommentaries shifted to an emphasis on questions arising from the text\nrather than the exposition of text (Lohr 1982, 95–6). This shift\nis heralded by most scholars as marking an important development\ntoward modern notions of both science and commentary. \nNonetheless, even with this change in the status of the Aristotelian\nworks, Aristotle remained an authority in the sense that his texts\nwere still the starting point for discussion, and medieval philosophy\nin general remained centered on authoritative texts and, hence, on\ntheir commentaries. This emphasis on the commentary points to two\nimportant differences between medieval and much contemporary\nphilosophy. First, medieval philosophical writers understood their own\nwork as emerging out of a tradition of authorities rather than in\nabstraction from or in opposition to a tradition (see below section 3,\n“Role of Authorities”). Second, their work emerges out of\nan encounter with texts rather than in unmediated contact with ideas,\nproblems, or arguments. (On the assumptions and characteristics of a\ncommentary-based notion of philosophy see Smith 1991, 3–7.) These ways\nof doing philosophy do not mean that medieval philosophers were\nincapable of originality, only that their original thought comes out\nof an acknowledged connection with what went before. Nor does it mean\nthat medieval philosophers were not engaged with ideas but only words\nand texts. For, they would argue, we can only confront ideas through\nthe language in which they are expressed. \nThe classical source for medieval writers of dialogue should have been\nPlato; but Western writers had no direct access to Plato’s\ndialogues, with the exception of the first half of the\nTimaeus. The number and diversity of dialogues from the\nmedieval period is, hence, surprising, with instances among the works\nof writers from Augustine to Ockham and Nicolas of Cusa, and across\ndifferent religious traditions. Though it has been argued that\ndialogue as a philosophical form dies off in late antiquity,\nespecially in the Christian tradition, this is clearly false in the\nmedieval period (Goldhill 2008, 5–8). Not only are philosophical\ndialogues plentiful but, perhaps because they were not overwhelmed by\nPlato as a model, medieval dialogue writers came up with many\nvariations on the form. While a good number use real or\nrealistically-described characters, there are also many where the\nparticipants are allegorical figures, like Boethius’s Lady\nPhilosophy in the Consolatio or “Reason” in\nAugustine’s Soliloquies. While some instances of this\nform, for example Boethius’s commentary in dialogue form on\nPorphyry’s Isagoge, simply make use of the form as a\nvehicle for straightforward exposition, others make the dialogue form\nintrinsic to the argument. And while the standard form of a\nphilosophical dialogue is between a teacher and student figure, a\nnumber of medieval dialogues ignore this convention. Abelard’s\nDialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian\n(Collationes), for example, traces a dispute between three\nequal partners, none of whom is the “teacher” whom the\nothers more or less meekly follow. Abelard’s dialogue is\nessentially a dispute without a master to resolve it. Even if, as many\nscholars think, the dialogue is unfinished and Abelard meant to add a\nresolution of the dialogue in the form of a final adjudication by\nsomeone playing the role of master, it is noteworthy that, unlike in\nmost philosophical dialogues, the magisterial point of view is absent\nuntil the end rather than being the one that directs the discussion.\n \nOther dialogue writers like Gilbert Crispin, Petrus Alphonsi, Raymund\nLull, and Nicolas of Cusa also write dialogues in which the\nparticipants are representatives of the major religions: Christian,\nJew, Muslim, pagan, or philosopher. While some take care to give the\nvictory to the Christian, even transforming the other participants\ninto converts to Christianity, Gilbert, Petrus, Abelard, and Raymund\nLull all opt for subtler conclusions. Abelard’s dialogue sets up\na “judge” for the debate who never proffers a judgment.\nEven if Abelard had added this final judgment, the dialogue would\nstill not indicate a clear winner. Dialogue is a favorite form in the\ngrowing Adversos Iudaeos literature of the late 11th and 12th\ncenturies. And insofar as the dialogue form was especially prevalent\nin this period, it is part of a growing rationalism. Writers composing\ndialogues between Christian and Jewish (or pagan) spokesmen are at the\nsame time shifting the grounds of those arguments from proof texts\nfrom scripture to arguments grounded in the notion that the truths of\nthe faith were self-evident and could be convincing even to those not\nsharing common beliefs or authoritative texts (Cohen 1999,\n167–218). There are dialogues by Jewish thinkers in which\nphilosophical and different religious perspectives debate, partially\nin response to Christian polemical dialogues, most famously Judah\nHalevi’s dialogue known as the Kuzari. The work is a\ndialogue between a pagan king, who speaks as a philosopher, and a\nJewish sage, and includes the appearance of representatives of Islam\nand Christianity working to convert the king. Though the dialogue form\ncontinues to be used in the Latin West after the 12th century, its\nplace as the form for rational argumentation is overtaken by\nthe more formal and elaborate school form of disputation in the 13th\n(Novikoff 2012, 341–343, 349). \nWhen the convention of composing a dialogue between a teacher and\nstudent is used, usually the author can be identified more or less\nwith the “teacher.” In Ibn Gabirol’s (Avicenbron)\ndialogue, best known by its Latin title, Fons vitae, the\nstudent is mostly restricted to asking the teacher for explanations\nand demonstrations. Anselm’s dialectical partner in Cur Deus\nHomo is the student Boso who as a Christian asks the questions\nthat a non-Christian monotheist would ask about the Incarnation.\nBoethius, however, casts himself as student rather than teacher in the\nConsolatio. Of those who compose dialogues between teacher\nand student a good number, such as those of Augustine, Eriugena,\nAnselm, Boethius, and Nicolas of Cusa expect and trace a conversion or\ntransformation in the “student” figure of the dialogue in\na way that Plato’s dialogues do not. Anselm explicitly makes of\nhis interlocutor a partner in the dialogue who is supposed to\nanticipate conclusions and implications and/or who more truly\nmotivates the entire discussion (Sweeney 1999). Like Anselm, other\nmedieval dialogue writers play with the convention that the teacher\ntakes the lead in the discussion, in effect asking as well as\nanswering questions. In Eriugena’s Periphyseon, it is\nsometimes the student, sometimes the teacher who moves the discussion\nforward. In William of Conches’ dialogue, Dragmaticon\nphilosophiae, the ‘Prince’ asks questions of the\n‘philosopher’ who represents William’s views. In an\ninteresting variation, William of Ockham’s Dialogus has\nthe student ask the questions while the teacher responds reluctantly\nand almost objectively without any attempt to transform or convert the\nstudent. \nThe variety of ways in which the dialogue form is taken up in the\nmedieval period alone is enough to make the form as such quite\ninteresting. In addition, as Jacobi points out, because the dialogue,\nunlike the disputation and commentary, is not a school form, it was\nalways taken up as a choice and with some degree of self-consciousness\non the part of the writer (Jacobi 1999, 10). They chose this form over\nsome other for a reason that affects the argument and the position\nthey take. (For bibliographical listings for some 160 dialogues\nwritten from the 4th century to the 15th as well as essays on the\ndialogues of 19 different medieval dialogue writers, see Jacobi\n1999.) \nGoldhill’s contention that there is something in Christianity\ninhospitable to dialogue is literally false but gets at a more\ndifficult question about how and whether dissent is tolerated in\nmedieval Christianity, with parallel questions that have and should be\nasked about medieval Jewish and Muslim culture. (See below, sections 3\nand 4.) While neither medieval philosophical dialogues nor the forms\nof disputation which grew out of them can be reduced to catechism-like\nquestion and answer (Goldhill 2009, 5), it is a complex matter to\ndetermine whether the rational form of dialogue and disputation foster\nreal open discussion and dissent or control it within strict and\nnon-threatening limits. The same question could, of course, be\nmeaningfully asked about dialogue in antiquity, in non-Christian\nreligious traditions, and in the modern era. In an important sense, it\nis often too much rather than too little faith in reason in the Latin\nWest, expressed in medieval dialogue and disputation, which leads some\nto the notion that reason can prove the truth of Christianity over\nJudaism or Islam, and, then, to condemnation of resistance to\nChristianity as irrational (Cohen 1999; Sweeney 2012a,\n324–5). \nIn the Latin West, as the universities developed in the 13th and 14th\ncenturies, two forms for philosophical and theological speculation\nwere incorporated into the curriculum, the disputed question and the\nSentences Commentary. The De Fallaciis attributed to\nAquinas defines a disputed question as a set of syllogistic arguments\non different sides of a question to be resolved (Bazán 1985,\n22). Bazán gives a more complete definition as follows:\n“a disputed question is a regular form of teaching,\napprenticeship and research, presided over by a master, characterized\nby a dialectical method which consists of bringing forward and\nexamining arguments based on reason and authority which oppose one\nanother on a given theoretical or practical problem and which are\nfurnished by participants, and where the master must come to a\ndoctrinal solution by an act of determination which confirms him in\nhis function as master” (Bazán 1985, 40). Disputations\ntook place both privately between a master and his students, and\npublicly or “solemnly” at an event that replaced regular\nclasses at the university and was attended by the larger university\ncommunity. The latter practice was eventually codified by university\nstatute, which prescribed that masters would hold a certain number of\ndisputations at various times of the year, sometimes as frequently as\nonce a week. Most scholars agree that the process came to be divided\ninto two sessions. In the first session, supporting and opposing\narguments for a given thesis or question were brought forward, and, in\na preliminary way, clarified and determined by a student serving as\nthe respondens under the supervision of the master. During\nthe second session, the master himself would make the determination,\ngive his answer and respond to all the opposing arguments. Some\ndisputed questions we have in written form are clearly taken from the\ndifferent stages in this process, either a reportatio of the\nfirst day’s session, some abbreviation of the debate, or one\nreflecting the master’s answer and response to opposing\nobjections, redacted after the second day’s debate.  \nDisputation arises out of and is an academic formalization of the\nphilosophical dialogue (Novikoff 2012) and comes into the classroom as\nan outgrowth of the lectio, the careful reading and\ncommentary on authoritative texts (Kenny and Pinborg 1982,\n20–25). This type of reading involved the consultation of\nauthoritative sources on those texts. From the differences among\nsources came the need to resolve such differences, a process\neventually formalized into the posing of a question. A question is\ntied to a specific textual problem or conflict, but has, like the\ndisputation, arguments on opposing sides and the response or\nresolution and replies to opposite objections by the master. The\ndisputation is centered around a systematic rather than a textual\nquestion, and the supporting and opposing arguments are supplied by\nstudents. \nA special form of disputation, quodlibetal (quodlibet = any,\nwhatever) questions, differed from ordinary disputations in that they\nwere open to the broader public — other masters, students from\nother schools, other church and civil authorities — and took\nplace only during Advent and Lent. The questions were not set by the\nmaster but could be posed by any member of the audience and without\nany prior notice to the master who would determine the question. These\nquestions might reflect contemporary controversies or might be\ndesigned to pose a question that brought to the fore a difficulty for\nthe particular master of whom it was asked because of his other stated\nviews. The popularity of these public spectacles shows the importance\nand influence of scholastic disputation on the larger culture.\n(Novikoff 2012, 2013). \nAn important function of the master in both quodlibetal and disputed\nquestions is the determinatio, in which the master ordered\nthe various smaller questions into articles of a given question. Like\nthe division of the text that is part of the work of commentary, this\nstrategy involves both making distinctions, for which medieval\nscholastics are well-known, but also a synthesis, finding the unity of\na text and the unity of a set of diverse questions under larger\nquestions in the disputation. The collections that have been made of\nthe quodlibetal literature show how diverse the questions posed were\nand how much less unified the treatment (Glorieux 1925–35;\nSchabel 2006–7). We can also see, by contrast, how much more a\nmatter of literary art the more unified and organized disputed\nquestions are that are based on questions set by and organized in\nsequence by a master. \nAll of these forms, disputation, quaestio, and quodlibetal\nquestion, represent what has been called “the\ninstitutionalization of conflict” in medieval intellectual life.\nRaising questions or objections about anything from basic matters of\nChristian belief — the existence of God, the coherence of the\ndoctrine of the Trinity — to important contemporary\ncontroversies — the power of the papacy or secular princes,\necclesiastical corruption — was not only permitted but\nencouraged as part of the structure of university life. Thus, there\nwas an important kind of intellectual and academic freedom enshrined\nin these practices of formal and public debate. On the other hand,\nthose questions were also in some ways controlled exactly because they\nwere brought into an existing institution and structured in a\nparticular way. Thus, the questions, even though asked, were in\nanother way made less dangerous and subversive by being posed and\ncontrolled from within the university, which itself operated under the\nwatchful eye of the Church. (For a study of the ways in which medieval\nphilosophical disputation made its way out of the university,\naffecting the larger culture, see Novikoff 2013.) \nThe disputation also develops in a different direction within the\nuniversities, into forms whose function was training in argumentative\ntechniques in which the goal is besting an opponent. Different forms\ndeveloped, with different rules for the opponent and respondent. In\nthe better known ars obligatoria, the opponent poses a\nquestion and the respondent answers, while in another form, the\nopponent constructs arguments to refute something held by the\nrespondent, and the respondent must react to the opponent’s\nclaims (Angellelli 1970; Pérez-Ilzarbe 2011, 130–1). (See\nbelow, section 2.9.) \n‘Meditation’ as a term for a form of medieval\nphilosophical writings belongs most properly to Anselm and most\nfamously to his Proslogion and Monologion; it is\nclosely related to soliloquy and Augustine’s\nConfessions, as well as some of the works of Bonaventure.\n(Anselm calls his Proslogion an “address” instead\nof a meditation or soliloquy. The Proslogion is addressed to\nGod, but its method for understanding God is similar to the\nMonologion, which Anselm calls a meditation.) In all these\nworks, the form is that of an introspective search, often in the\nexplicit form of an internal dialogue. While sentence collections and\ndisputed questions make very explicit the different sources and\nvocabularies that clash with each other and with that of the author of\na question, meditation and soliloquy show no particular reliance on\nauthoritative sources.  \nThe source for Anselm’s meditations is the practice of monastic\nmeditation on texts from scripture or on one’s own spiritual\ncondition. Anselm takes these techniques for focusing the mind and\nuses them as mode of inquiry into problems of speculative theology and\nphilosophy. Anselm’s meditations make no direct reference to\noutside sources, either scriptural or philosophical, but represent\nAnselm’s own thought process as he struggles with what he cannot\nquite understand or prove. In monastic style, he has so thoroughly\n‘ruminated’ on his source texts, scripture and\nAugustine’s De Trinitate, that they are essentially\ninvisible to contemporary readers. This independence from authority\nand emphasis on internal exploration also characterizes\nAugustine’s Soliloquies, a ‘dialogue’\nbetween Augustine and ‘Reason’, as well as Abelard’s\nSoliloquium, a ‘dialogue’ between\n“Peter” and “Abelard” on the meaning and\noverlap between the names ‘Christian’,\n‘philosopher’ and ‘logician’. In his\nItinararium mentis in Deum, Bonaventure draws on a\nparticularly Franciscan form of contemplation, following the path of\nSt. Francis’s mystical ascent to God, based on Francis’s\nvision of the six-winged seraph. In Bonaventure, as in Anselm,\nmeditation is connected to the mystical project of achieving union\nwith God. \nAnselm retains the personal and intimate nature of meditation also\ncharacteristic of Augustine’s Confessions. It is worth\nnoting that among the other works that Anselm labels\n‘meditations’ are a “meditation on lost\nvirginity” and a “meditation on redemption.” These\nare highly personal works, concerned with the existential conditions\nof sin and salvation. The Proslogion and Monologion\nshare with them this personal or existential character. As Anselm\nStolz points out, each step of Anselm’s argument in the\nProslogion either takes the form of or concludes in prayer\n(Stolz 1967, 198–201). According to scholars who take the form\nof the Proslogion as meditation seriously, that form makes it\nimpossible to understand the argument as a “proof” for\nGod’s existence designed to convince an agnostic or atheist on a\npurely rational level. Rather, they argue, the text is an attempt by\nAnselm to address and approach God and is thus written by and for a\nbelieving Christian trying to understand and achieve union with God.\nOn the other hand, other scholars take as most significant in the form\nnot Anselm’s prayers but his complete reliance on his own reason\nwithout apparent recourse to authority, making the form itself an\nimportant model for independent and truly philosophical discourse.\nBoth the introspective element and independence from authority are\nretained in Descartes’ Meditations, about which similar\nquestions have been raised concerning its form. In the Middle Ages,\nthe importance of the form shows the continuation of philosophy or\nphilosophical theology as what Pierre Hadot has called a “way of\nlife.” On this view, until the high scholasticism of the 13th\nand 14th centuries, philosophy was essentially a spiritual and\npersonal project of self-discipline and self-transformation, rather\nthan an abstract and school-based problem-solving set of techniques\n(Hadot 1995, 269–70). Christianity before the 13th century,\nHadot argues, presented itself as a philosophy, a way of life, and\nChristian monasticism and its practices of meditations were meant to\nbe a path into this spiritually transformative experience (See Hadot\n1995, 126–141, for the links between ancient “spiritual\nexercises” and “Christian philosophy”.) \nSentences as a genre is a development of earlier collections\nof sayings or citations of the church fathers. Such collections, known\nas florilegia, were collections of citations organized around\nthe order of scripture. The development of the scholastic sentences\ncollection can be attributed jointly to Anselm of Laon, Abelard, and\nPeter Lombard. Anselm of Laon and his school, so famously criticized\nby Abelard in his Historia Calamitatum, can be credited with\ndeveloping a critical approach to the authorities they cited; they\nsometimes disregarded or criticized opinions rather than always\nseeking to preserve them all (Colish 1994, 42–46). The next\nsignificant development is in the organization of these collections,\nfrom an organization following the order of scripture to an\norganization based on systematic questions of theology. Such a change\nbrings speculative and philosophical questions to the fore, questions\nconcerning the divine nature and metaphysics, and anthropological and\nethical problems. Peter Abelard’s Sic et Non opposes\nauthoritative quotations from church fathers on particular questions\narranged in an order and on topics that are systematic rather than\nnarrative. What Abelard attempted in the various versions of\nTheologia but did not ever manage successfully to do was to\ngather those various questions into a systematic organization and\ndivision of theology as a discipline. This was the achievement of\nPeter Lombard.  \nPeter Lombard’s Sentences was by far the most\nsuccessful instance of the form. Commenting on it became an academic\nrequirement for the master of theology in the 13th century, a status\nit retained until the later 15th century, with new commentaries still\nappearing in the 18th (Silano 2007, xxx). (The nature of these\ncommentaries varies quite a bit, early commentaries tending to be line\nby line glosses, and later ones more often a series of\nquaestiones on more or less selected topics raised by Peter.\nSee Evans 2002 and Rosemann 2009.) Though Peter claims in his prologue\nmerely to have made a collection of the views of Church Fathers and\nmost historians have taken him at his word, his advance lies in the\norganization of particular questions into a unified plan, based on\nAugustine’s distinction between things to be enjoyed (God alone)\nand things to be used (everything else). Secondly, Peter offers his\nown responses to questions, engages and refutes the opinions of\ncontemporaries when necessary, and in many cases, uses the form to\narticulate, justify, and create a consensus view. Besides giving\ntheology an organization and making a place for all questions to be\nconsidered, Peter often explicitly leaves some questions open. Peter\nthus invites others to join in the debate and conversation rather than\nsimply accept or reject his views. All of these features made his work\nespecially fruitful for later commentary. Further, Peter Lombard,\nunlike Abelard, attempted to give substantive and metaphysically based\nrather than merely verbal solutions to theological problems, a method\nmore in tune with the 13th century curriculum focused on Aristotle,\nthan the 12th, organized around the trivium arts, also positioning\nPeter’s Sentences for the preeminence it achieved in\nthe 13th century. \nThe great mystery about the Lombard’s Sentences is how\na book so important for centuries has been so greatly neglected by\nscholars, even by those interested in and sympathetic to medieval\nscholasticism. One intriguing suggestion is that it is tied to the\ngenre of the work and the different notion of authorship thereby\nimplied. Giulio Silano argues that the work is most analogous to a\nmodern legal casebook, and that Peter, as the casebook author, is\ngoverned most directly not by his views but those of the authorities,\nand the pedagogical goal is not the expression and promulgation of his\nviews, or even the mere learning of the authorities’ views but\nrather the initiation of the student into a discipline, as in\njurisprudence, a way of thinking and applying past authorities to\npresent questions or conflicts (Silano 2007). Thus we discount and\nmisunderstand Peter Lombard’s achievement if we evaluate it in\nlight of modern notions of authorship and originality. \nAs the disputed question as a form began to fade in importance in the\ntheological faculty, it was replaced by variations on the disputation\nform in the arts faculty, focusing on questions of logic and natural\nphilosophy. Of these three types of literature which become more\nsignificant in the 13th and 14th centuries, obligatio is the\nonly one that unambiguously refers to a form of argument.\nSophismata and insolubilia can refer either to the\npropositions that might be discussed in a debate or treatise or other\nform, or a form of argument for discussing these types of\npropositions. The literature concerning these kinds of problems ranges\nfrom formal disputes on the propositions which attempt to solve or\navoid the problem posed by the statements to treatises or rules about\nhow to solve the puzzles the disputes over them reveal. As a type of\nproposition, sophismata are ambiguous propositions about\nwhich arguments might plausibly be given both that they are true and\nthat they are false. They are, as Ashworth puts it, “the\nmedieval ancestor of ‘the morning star is the evening\nstar’,” that is, a proposition epitomizing a larger\nproblem (Ashworth 1992, 518). Insolubilia are propositions\nthat are either very difficult or impossible to hold as true or false.\nThese propositions are usually self-referential paradoxes such as the\nliar paradox (e.g., ‘everything I say is false’). The\ninfluential view of William Heytesbury was that insolubles should be\nresolved in the context of an obligatio, a specialized form\nof disputation, and Heytesbury proposes rules for solving\ninsolubilia as well as sophismata in this way (Spade\n1982, 252). (For a catalog of insolubilia literature, see\nSpade 1975).  \nSophismata discussed in the form of a disputation usually\ninvolve the offering of arguments both for the truth and for the\nfalsity of the proposition, resolved by a master. The resolution might\nonly be a statement about whether the sophism is true or false; then,\nmore elaborate replies to objections to the master’s view might\nbe discussed. This form can be complicated by the addition of a\nresponse offered and defended and then further attacked, and then once\nagain defended by responses to the new set of opposing arguments. Oral\ndisputations on sophisms, the origin of much of the\nsophismata literature, were an important part of the school\ncurriculum (see Courtenay 1987). Students would serve as opponent and\nthen respondent in a series of disputations under the direction of a\nmaster. Ashworth notes that some sophismata, such as those by\nKilvington and Heytesbury, were original compositions, not edited\nversions of live debates (Ashworth 1992, 519). (For more about\nKilvington’s sophismata, see the edition with\ntranslation and commentary by Kretzmann and Kretzmann 1990.) The\ndiscussion of sophisms occurs in three different settings in the\nmedieval literature: first, sophisms which are discussed in works on\ndifferent topics where the sophism raises certain questions germaine\nto that topic; second, works by a single author which examine a series\nof sophisms (e.g., the sophismata of Albert of Saxony or John\nBuridan), and third, collections of sophisms discussed by diverse\nauthors (Read 1993). \nIn the obligational form of disputation, an opponent puts something\nforward to a respondent. The respondent then ‘obligates’\nhimself to take a certain position on the case put forward by the\nopponent throughout the dispute. There are different types of\nobligations based on the type of claim the opponent proposes and the\nstance the respondent adopts towards it. (On the different types, see\nStump 1982, 319–323.) The goal of the opponent is to trap the\nrespondent into a contradiction and the goal of the respondent is to\navoid the contradiction. The setting of the discussion is crucial\nsince the obligation often involves the evaluation of statements that\ndepend on the disputational context. So, for example, the respondent\nis often obligated to take a position on propositions which make\nreference to their granting or denying something within the\ndisputation (e.g., ‘that you are in Rome must be granted [by\nyou]’) (Stump 1982, 327). In other cases, the difficulty is\ncaused by reference to the passage of time within the dispute. So it\nis posited that something is true at A, but it becomes false and\nimpossible that it be true later in the disputation since the instant\nA has passed (Stump 1982, 328). Often, the dispute between the\nopponent and respondent is set up to result in a paradox. In such\ncases, the solution must happen outside the debate between the two\nparties, in which there is a further distinction or disqualification\nof something originally granted in the disputation. \nAlthough it has usually been supposed that medieval interest in\nsophismata and insolubilia came from medieval\nscholars’ exposure to ancient sources, like Arisotle’s\nSophistical Refutations, rediscovered in the Middle Ages,\nAngel D’Ors has suggested that their origins might instead be\nfound in earlier medieval sources concerned with the problem of\nskepticism, like Augustine’s Soliloquia, and Contra\nAcademicos, as well as Anselm’s De Veritate,\nProslogion and so forth (D’Ors 1997). Ashworth ties\ntheir origin to the 12th c. practice of adducing counter-examples to\npoint out the flaws in reasoning for an apparently plausible thesis\n(Ashworth 1992, 518) D’Ors further suggests that discussions of\nsophisms which continue in theological texts show not the interest in\nsophisms bleeding over into theology, but theological contexts as the\nimpetus for interest in logical sophisms (D’Ors 1997). \nThe aspiration of the summa form is two-fold: first, to\ncompletely emancipate the subject matter, whether logical,\ntheological, or philosophical, from the structure dictated either by\nscripture or authoritative sources; and second, to cover completely an\nentire discipline, often but not always, in summary form.  \nThe summa form was invented by Peter Helias. His Summa\nsuper Priscianum was written around 1150, more than a century\nbefore Peter of Spain composed his logical summa and Thomas\nAquinas his theological summa. Peter Helias’s\nsumma combines a commentary on Priscian’s text with a\nsystematic consideration of all the aspects of grammar (Reilly 1993,\n16). \nWhat Peter Lombard’s Sentences are to the sentences\ngenre, Thomas Aquinas’s two great summae, the Summa\nContra Gentiles and Summa Theologiae are to the\nsumma form. As with sentences collections, there are two\naspects of the form to be considered: the overall organizing structure\nand the method of confronting individual problems or questions. In\nterms of overall structure, the Contra Gentiles is a\nreflection of Aquinas’s distinction between those things which\ncan be known by reason alone (e.g., that God exists) and those things\nwhich cannot be arrived at without revelation (e.g., the Trinity and\nIncarnation). Hence, the first three books of the Summa Contra\nGentiles, dealing with God and creation, use arguments which\ndepend only on reason to reach and support its conclusions. The fourth\nbook is concerned with those things that are known only through\nrevelation, in which revelation offers the principles from which the\nconclusions are drawn. The form for handling individual issues and\nproblems in the Contra Gentiles is not the quaestio\nbut a more affirmative defense of specific positions and against\nspecific heresies. And though it is unclear whether the title\nsumma is original (Jordan 1986, 182–3), the work fits\nthe summa form in its systematic arrangement of topics and\nits attempt to include all possible arguments for a given position and\nagainst its contrary. It has been argued that the Contra\nGentiles is not a polemical but a protreptic work, addressed to\nChristians, calling on them to deepen their understanding of the\nfaith, specifically about how to persuade others to Christian belief\n(Jordan 1986, 190, 194). On this view the gentiles in the\ntitle are not Muslims and Jews but the “pre- or extra-Christian\nman, and metaphorically, the human mind under the tutelage of\nnature” (Jordan 1986, 184). \nThe Summa Theologiae by contrast, uses an abbreviated form of\nthe disputed question. The questions are, however, artificial,\ncarefully composed imitations of disputations, not tied to any actual\noral debate as true disputed questions are. This gives Aquinas the\nopportunity to arrange the objections and authorities so as to achieve\na rhetorical as well as a logical effect. Thus, Aquinas’s\nSumma Theologiae is different from Peter Lombard’s\nSentences in two ways. The gathering of authorities around a\ngiven question is for Peter one of the main purposes of his work, to\nsome degree an end in itself, while for Aquinas those citations serve\nthe end of constructing an answer to the question. Further, while\nPeter dispenses with the question format when he finds an issue\nuncontroversial or largely settled by consensus, Aquinas always places\nissues in the format of a question, always finds arguments on both\nsides of an issue. For Peter, the question format is more a means to\nan end, and when the authorities he surveys are in agreement, he\ntreats the matter like settled case law. But what Aquinas wants to\nteach beginning students of theology, for whom he says the work is\ncomposed, is that speculation, not fixed answers, is at the heart of\nthe philosophical and theological enterprise. What he passes on to\nthose students is not information so much as training in a certain way\nof thinking. \nAt the macro level, the Summa Theologiae is organized into\nthree parts; first, a consideration of God; second, the rational\ncreature’s movement toward God; and third, of Christ as the way\nto God. (For a recent discussion of and summary of the debates over\nhow to understand this organization, see Johnstone 2000.) In his\nprologue, Aquinas claims that the main contribution of his work is in\nits organization of topics and questions, following the order required\nby the subject instead of a book or a particular disputation. In this\nsense, both Aquinas’s summae represent a further and\nalmost complete emancipation from a textual order to a logical order.\nWithin that logical structure, Aquinas devotes long passages to\nscripture, to the Genesis account of creation (Part I, qq.\n67–74), Hebrew scripture considered as the “Old Law”\n(Part II, first part, qq. 98–106) and the life of Christ (Part\nIII, qq. 27–59). Moreover, the work retains its tie to texts in\nindividual questions which, as individual systematic questions are\naddressed, interpret authorities according to their response,\nultimately harmonizing rather than simply discarding discordant\nvoices. \nAfter Aquinas, the summa remains a form for the systematic\norganization of an entire area of study, though often it becomes a\nsummary, a collection of answers, a manual in which to look up answers\nto particular questions rather than a series of questions.\nOckham’s Summa Logicae shares with the summa\ngenre in theology the attempt to organize an entire discipline\nsystematically. Ockham’s principle of organization is first to\ndivide logic into terms and propositions and then to consider the\nvarious types of terms and propositions. Ockham’s form for\nconsidering particular types of terms or propositions is generally\nstraightforward exposition occasionally mixed with a presentation of\nopposing positions and responses to the arguments for that position.\nJohn Buridan’s Summulae de Dialectica from the mid-14th\ncentury, begins as a commentary on Peter of Spain’s Summulae\nLogicales (written between 1220–1250). While Peter’s\nimmensely popular text (used in the 17th century) was a\n“summa” in the sense of short summaries of the topics of\nlogic, Buridan’s important and also popular Summulae\nbased on Peter’s text gives much more systematic explanations\nnot just assertations of definitions and propositions, and is thus a\n“summa” in the sense of a complete set of explanations.\nMoreover, Buridan did not compose his account in dialogue form, but\ngives straightforward answers in his own voice (Zupko, 2003, 9).\nThough clearly a teaching text, Buridan reconfigures the discipline of\nlogic using the “new logic” (or logica moderna)\nto explain the basic concepts in Peter’s text, and, where\nnecessary (e.g., in the account of demonstration) composes both a base\ntext and the explanatory commentary on the topic not covered by Peter\n(Zupko, 2003, 100). As Zupko concludes, Buridan’s\n“Summulae is essentially a compendium of methods, a\n’how-to’ book for the philosopher” (Zupko, 2003,\n135). In form, Ockham’s and Buridan’s works show a\nprogression toward the modern treatise, such as that of Hume or Locke\non human nature or understanding, because their exhaustive\nconsideration of their topic and the presentation of the single voice\nof the author, rather than a dialogue or set of authorities from the\ntradition. \nIf there is one formal characteristic found in medieval philosophical\ntexts of every relevant period and among all the religious\naffiliations of its practitioners, it is the citation of authoritative\ntexts, whether scripture, Plato, Aristotle, or other revered teachers.\nTo contemporary readers, such references seem to show a slavish\ndeference to authority and lack of autonomy or originality in the\nwriter. The explanation of this phenomenon is, of course, a good deal\nmore complex. The main way of approaching authoritative sources used\nby medieval writers was to find ways to forge agreements with and\namong authorities by reinterpreting them. Besides the strategies we\nmight recognize in modern practices of interpretation, there are\nnumber of ways in which medieval authors make a greater effort to\nbring an author’s view into conversation and agreement with\ncontemporary discussions. This sometimes involves placing an\nauthor’s claims in a larger context, such as supporting\nAristotle’s metaphysical claims but in a limited way, as valid\nonly for the sublunary world. So, for example, Maimonides argues that\nAristotle’s account of the eternity of motion makes perfect\nsense as an inference from the world as we now experience it, but is\nlimited to that context. Just as a boy reared on an island without\nwomen would have difficulty imagining how children might be conceived\nand born, Aristotle, Maimonides argues, might simply have had an\nexperience too limited to allow him to develop any other accounts of\nthe origin of things (Maimonides 1974, 295). Maimonides’\nhandling of Aristotle in this example is more colorful and explicit\nthan other medieval thinkers, but the principle he uses is common.\nAlternatively, medieval interpreters often take a given citation out\nof context and assign it a new context. Hence, for example, Aquinas\ncites Augustine in support of his claim that theology is a science\nanalogous to an Aristotelian science as described in the Posterior\nAnalytics; however, Aquinas does not note that Augustine uses the\nterm ‘science’ in a much older and less technical way\n(Aquinas 1981, I, q. 1, a. 2). Alan of Lille supports the Pauline\nclaim that the “invisible things of God are known through the\nvisible things that are made” only after arguing that the kind\nof knowledge in question is the knowledge of faith (Alan of Lille\n1954, 135–6). While Aquinas cites and supports the\ncategorization of sin in terms of Gregory the Great’s scheme of\nthe seven deadly sins, he clearly subordinates Gregory’s\nclassification to his own way of organizing notions of sin (Sweeney\n2012b). Though these examples are chosen to show the difference\nbetween modern and medieval interpretive practice, we cannot attribute\nsuch interpretations to bad faith on the part of writers like Aquinas\nor Alan of Lille or Maimonides. That is, they are not deliberately\nmisinterpreting their sources. Rather their strategies for harmonizing\nauthorities discordant with each other and with their own views are\npart of a hermeneutic whose basic assumption is that these authorities\nare all seeking and attempting to express part of a single truth. It\nis not a distortion or disservice to an authoritative source to put\nits views in a new context, making them appropriate to contemporary\nissues and fitting that source into the picture of the truth as it is\npresently known. The underlying concordance of all authorities is\ntaken as a given and interpreters work toward showing how it might be\noperative in particular cases. As Silano notes, many of the tensions\nand even outright contradictions between authoritative sources would\nhave disappeared had the compilers, commentators, and masters\ndetermining a question placed those authoritative claims in their\nhistorical/cultural context rather than simply set them against each\nother. But they would also, thereby, deprive these sources of their\nnormative status, in the same way in which a judicial decision\ninterpreted in terms of its historical/cultural context is no longer\nbinding (Silano 2007, xxv–xxvi). Silano points out that the task of\nthe 12th and 13th centuries in the Latin West is the establishment of\nauthorities which will form the parameters within which discussion and\ndissention can take place, rather than their dethronement through\nhistorical relativization (Silano 2007, xxv–xxvi). \nThe way in which scripture is cited is somewhat different from the way\nAristotle or even church authorities like Augustine are used. First,\nscripture is a language in which these authors are thoroughly fluent.\nThey cite scripture from memory, almost proverbially. Further, when\nscripture is cited in argumentative forms like the disputation, most\noften it does not carry the weight of the argument. Either scripture\nis cited in opposing arguments on one side or the other, in which case\nscripture passages seem to articulate a limit or boundary the opposing\nview seems to transgress. But the positions or arguments articulated\npro or con on a given question are not the final word but something\nthe master may accept or reject, which will require an interpretation\nof the passage from scripture which accepts, rejects, or qualifies its\nrelevance and apparent position on the question. When scripture is\ncited in the master’s own answer, it functions as a support for\nsomething for which independent arguments are given. Scripture is also\nsometimes used to give a position moral and spiritual weight, to\nreiterate the moral and spiritual center of a writer’s thought.\nIt thus can act as an almost existential reminder of why these\narguments matter and what is at stake in them. \nIf these are strategies that in general characterize the Latin\ntradition until the 13th century, there is a different strategy at\nwork in some philosophers in the Arabic and Jewish traditions. While\nthese authors also attempt in many cases to show the deep concordance\nbetween, for example, scripture and the philosophers, they also at\ntimes use authoritative texts to put forward views which they\nthemselves would like to promulgate even as they leave them in the\nmouths of those other authors, like Aristotle or Plato. \nAs is clear from the development of the sentences collection,\nsumma, and commentary, there are significant changes over\ntime in the ways in which authorities were used and cited (see the\ndiscussion of these individual forms above). It is possible to see the\nevolution of the treatment of authoritative sources as growing\npositively toward a more modern ‘scientific’ attitude\ntowards interpretation and commentary, one which is neutral, critical,\nand historically informed rather than dedicated to finding the\n‘truth’ in a given author no matter how hidden. But while\nthere is considerable development toward modern standards of\nscholarship in the 13th and 14th centuries, there are also virtues in\nthe earlier types of approach to authoritative sources. These earlier\nauthors are highly sophisticated interpreters of biblical and\nphilosophical texts, finding levels of conflict and concord among\ndifferent authors that modern interpreters would tend to miss. \nMany late classical and medieval philosophical texts contain esoteric\nelements. The desire to hide the real message of a text in its earlier\nforms springs from some form of gnosticism. Gnostic sects, needing to\nprotect their knowledge from dissemination among non-initiates, hid\ntheir true message in ways that could only be deciphered by those who\npossessed the secret knowledge. Leo Strauss makes the additional\nargument that the motives for esotericism in Jewish and Islamic\nmedieval thinkers are political. Revelation in Judaism and Islam deals\nfundamentally with law, with the correct social order, whereas in\nChristianity it is the revelation of a creed or set of dogmas, Strauss\nargues. Hence, to interpret revelation in Judaism and Islam is always\na political act. Interpreting law is much further from the task of\nphilosophy than interpreting dogma, placing philosophy on the\nperiphery of Islamic and Jewish society as opposed to being an\nintegral part of the official training of students as it was in the\nChristian West. The inherently marginal character of philosophy in\nthese societies makes it politically dangerous to be a philosopher.\nFurther, Strauss argues, for these thinkers human nature is\nessentially and inevitably divided between “the few” who\nare capable to doing and understanding philosophy, and “the\nmany” who were not capable of digesting the truths of philosophy\nand who must be protected from philosophy. Exposure of the many to\nphilosophy tends to undermine the authority of revelation and the\nreligious and political authority given the power to explain and\npromulgate the revealed law. For Strauss, the difference between\nJewish and Islamic thinkers, on the one hand, and Christian thinkers,\non the other, is also exemplified in the different literary sources on\nwhich they relied. For Christian thinkers, the models are Aristotle\nand Cicero, for Jewish and Islamic thinkers, the models are the\ndialogues of Plato, especially the Republic and the\nLaws. Strauss’s thesis is that these writers hid in\ntheir exoteric teaching an esoteric teaching to be discerned by\nreading between the lines. In practice, this means taking small\ninconsistencies and other discrepancies in the text as indicative of a\ndeeper or hidden view, looking for the author’s\n“real” views in the mouths of characters in a dialogue or\nallegory who are otherwise presented unfavorably, etc. Strauss’s\nviews on how to interpret the literary form of medieval philosophical\ntexts are controversial, but they have made the literary form and\nhermeneutics applied to these texts a question that must, especially\nfor Islamic and Jewish writers, be confronted. For Maimonides, for\nexample, an esoteric or ‘dualist’ reading would claim that\nMaimonides holds Aristotelian positions on the eternity of the world,\nthe possibility of miracles and on other matters which would bring him\ninto conflict with Judaism but must hide such views from political and\nreligious authorities, signalling them only obliquely to the few in\nthe Guide for the Perplexed but expressing non-Aristotelian\nviews in his work commenting on Jewish law and scriptures. Daniel\nFrank (2003, 144–5) argues against this view that Maimonides\n“may best be understood philosophically as engaged in critical\ndialogue with Aristotle, almost invariably disagreeing with him, but\nindebted to Aristotle for his mode of discourse, argument forms, and\nphilosophical vocabulary.” Moreover, Frank points out that the\nplausibility of extreme esotericism in Islamic and Jewish\nphilosophical texts may be exaggerated by an unhistorical dichotomy\nbetween Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism (also discussed above,\nsection 2. 4) (Frank 2003, 142–3). That is, because we see a\nconflict between and author’s Aristotelian and Neoplatonic\nviews, we speculate that one view is their ‘real’ view,\nand the other, their ‘cover’ view, while thinkers in this\ncontext would have seen Aristotelian and Neoplatonic positions as\nquite compatible. (On Maimonides and esotericism, see also Ravitsky\n2005). \nWhile rejecting the extreme position Strauss takes on medieval\nphilosophical texts, many scholars have noted the esoteric elements\npresent in some medieval texts by Christian as well as Islamic and\nJewish writers (see Butterworth 2001). Boethius, for example, presents\nhis theological views not to the many but to his trusted teachers and\nadvisors, writing in a highly dense and technical language in his\nDe Hebdomadibus accessible only to the learned (Boethius\n1973, 38–41). As late as the end of the 12th century, Alan of\nLille writes in theological texts of the need to protect the sacred\ntruths of theology from the incursions of uneducated students in the\nliberal arts (Alan of Lille 1981, 119–122), and, in the 11th\ncentury, Anselm complains of the work he intended only for his fellow\nmonks in the Cur Deus Homo being disseminated without his\nconsent and in a form he did not approve of (Anselm 1998,\n261–2). Like many medieval authors, he expresses great concern\nthat his work will be misunderstood and strives to protect himself\nfrom misinterpretation. \nIn the Latin, Christian world, though philosophy and speculative\ntheology is accepted as a legitimate endeavor, enshrined by the 13th\ncentury in the university curriculum, philosophical writers were\nsometimes censured by theological authorities, and some views were at\nvarious times condemned as false and contrary to the faith, most\nfamously in what is known as the Condemnation of 1277 (Thiessen 1998;\nAertsen, Emery, et al. 2001; and Bianchi 2003). This threat, some have\nargued, influenced some writers to pull their punches, to make\nconcessions or professions of ignorance or humility that were not\nauthentically part of their views. Hence, for example, some have\nargued that Abelard’s statement in his theology disclaiming any\nability or pretense to address the issues necessary for salvation or\nto give anything more than verisimilitudes about the divine, is a\nconcession to his persecutors more than a sincere statement of his\nview of his own work (Abelard 1987, 123, 201; Sweeney 2006,\n90–3). Christian writers operating before the formation of the\nuniversities and the development of acceptable university forms of\nwriting, i.e., commentaries on Aristotle, on the Sentences of\nPeter Lombard, disputed questions, etc., need to justify their\nwriting, to explain the nature of its audience, to show the\nauthor’s submission to the proper authorities. Readers must\nconsider whether these kinds of statements can simply be disregarded\nas obligatory but not sincere, and whether they affect the\npresentation of the philosophical and theological arguments in the\ntext. While it might be tempting to see them merely as pro\nforma, it is clear that complete disregard of such remarks is\nanachronistic. Such views, for example, contributed to the now\nthoroughly rejected view of Abelard as pure rationalist and as a rebel\nagainst church authority. Nonetheless, concern about avoiding conflict\nor censure is real among these writers. For example, after the\ncondemnation of many Aristotelian positions in 1277, authors take care\nto note when they are simply citing or describing a point of view in\norder to consider it or argue against it, signaling with a phrase like\n“dico recitative” that they are not subscribing\nto that position. \nParallel to the highly formalized and structured debate of the\ndisputations in the later Middle Ages, there are also highly\nformalized ways of engaging in debate with one’s contemporaries\nthat shift to some degree over time. In the 12th and 13th centuries,\nfor example, while it is acceptable to attach names of church teachers\nand authorities from earlier generations to opposing positions, even\nto positions opposed by the contemporary writer of a text, one’s\ncontemporaries or from the recent past were never directly named but\nmerely referred to as “someone” or “certain\npeople” who might hold a given position. However, this should\nnot be interpreted as deference to one’s contemporaries or as an\nattempt to quell controversy, since authors became adept at signaling\ntheir opponents without actually naming them, paraphrasing or\nparodying their views or catchphrases as modes of ridicule or play. In\nthe late 13th century, Duns Scotus begins to give partial references\nto the contemporary thinkers and texts with which he is in\nconversation; Peter Aureol in the 14th century gives full and accurate\ncitations. Gregory of Rimini (d. 1358) begins to develop something\ncloser to a “historico-critical approach to theology,”\ncarefully citing authoritative texts. \nThis development parallels one in some medieval sermons, where the\nwriters find ways of referring (often by puns) to themselves as author\nof the sermon. The shift is from an interest in the arguments to\ninterest in the individual thinkers. One cause for these changes might\nbe the internationalization of the writers and texts. In a more\nparochial world, everyone would know who held certain positions; but\nin a wider context, those at Oxford, for example, might not be known\nand needed to be named in Paris. These changes might have also been\ncaused by the growing self-consciousness and sense of individuality\nhistorians have noticed in other aspects of medieval academic and\nsocial life. \nThe Islamic and Jewish traditions, as well as the Latin tradition\nuntil the 13th century, can be characterized by the diversity of\nliterary forms for philosophical texts. A good deal of the\nphilosophical creativity among these writers goes into the form in\nwhich they choose to write. The genres that dominate the 13th and 14th\ncentury, the Sentences commentary, the disputed question, and\nthe logical developments of these forms in obligationes and\nsophismata, are academic, highly choreographed forms. In\ncontrast to the earlier period, these forms do not allow an author\nmuch creative latitude. It is possible to read the development and\nwaning of various forms and the movement toward standard forms in\nmedieval philosophy in different ways. From one point of view, the\nvariety of forms which flourished from the 10th to the 12th century\ncan be seen as the high point from which the narrowing into the\nacademic forms of the 13th and 14th centuries seems like a loss, not\nonly in variety but from the connection to the larger spiritual and\nexistential concerns treated in, for example, the allegories of\nBoethius or Avicenna and the meditations of Anselm. From another point\nof view (the more prevalent assumption of the secondary literature),\nthe disputed question and other forms of high scholasticism are that\ntoward which the earlier centuries made somewhat uneven but steady\nsteps. In these forms, some might argue, philosophy finds its center\nin arguments for and against different positions. (See Kretzmann 1997,\n301, where he argues that issues of style and rhetoric are not\nrelevant to Aquinas’ “unadorned, straightforward, pellucid\nway of expounding, analyzing, and arguing — [which is] ideal for\nphilosophy”.) The assumption, one arguably bequeathed to the\nWestern philosophical tradition through Latin Medieval school forms,\nis that “straightforward argument” is not itself a style,\nrhetoric, and/or genre but the pure form of rationality and, hence,\nphilosophy. At the same time as these developments in the form of\nphilosophical/speculative thought, philosophy also becomes itself as\nthe enterprise of reason alone, functioning independently of theology\nin the arts faculty. We can also see different medieval forms as\nindebted to either Plato or Aristotle as philosophical models. Even\nwithout the Platonic dialogues, the influence of Plato through\nNeoplatonism is evident in the forms that flourish before the 13th\ncentury, in allegory, meditation, and dialogue. These forms emphasize\nboth the spiritual character of the highest truths\nphilosophical/theological discourse strives to discover and reveal,\nand the difficulty, both intellectual and moral, of achieving\ninsight. \nMuch more work needs to be done on the literary forms of medieval\nphilosophy. There are so many forms instantiated in so many ways in\ndifferent periods and from within different religious traditions.\nConsideration of these forms is especially important for a more\ncomplete understanding of medieval philosophical texts because so many\nof these forms are foreign to contemporary readers. Sometimes the form\nis important because an author was constrained by practice or academic\nstatute to use it, as with disputations and Sentences\ncommentaries; hence, how an author comes to use or manipulate a given\nform for his own ends is a significant part of understanding the text.\nWhen an author uses a non-standard form, that form is self-consciously\nchosen and thus in a different way a significant part of an\nauthor’s meaning. It would be helpful to have studies of\nparticular authors who have used different forms, and more studies\ntracing the development of a given genre through different authors and\nperiods (as in Jacobi 1999 on dialogue and Whitman 2000 on allegory,\nEvans 2002 and Rosemann 2009 on Sentence commentaries).\nFinally, more historical work needs to be done by individual scholars\nequipped to look at the different genres across different periods and\nfrom within and across works arising out of Christian, Jewish, and\nArabic religious traditions.","contact.mail":"eileen.sweeney@bc.edu","contact.domain":"bc.edu"}]
