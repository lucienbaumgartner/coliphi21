They are\nemployed for various purposes such an entertainment, education,\nconceptual analysis, exploration, hypothesizing, theory selection,\ntheory implementation, etc. Some applications are more controversial\nthan others. Few would object to thought experiments that serve to\nillustrate complex states of affairs, or those that are used in\neducational contexts. The situation is different, however, with\nrespect to the appropriation of imagined scenarios to investigate\nreality (very broadly conceived to include things like electrons,\ntables, rain, beliefs, morals, people, numbers, universes, and even\ndivine beings). It is this use of thought experiments that attracts\nmost of the attention inside and outside of philosophical discourse.\nSignificant is the overlap here with many other central philosophical\ntopics, such as the nature of the imagination, the importance of\nunderstanding in contrast to explanation, the role of intuition in\nhuman cognition, and the relationship between fiction and truth.\nMoreover, thought experiments are interdisciplinary in two important\nrespects. Firstly, not only philosophers treat them as a topic, but\nalso historians, cognitive scientists, psychologists, etc. Secondly,\nthey can be found in many disciplines, including biology, economics,\nhistory, mathematics, philosophy, and physics (although,\ninterestingly, not with the same frequency in each).\n\n\nMost often thought experiments are communicated in narrative form,\nfrequently with diagrams. It is important to distinguish between the\nimagined scenarios that are featured in thought experiments, on the\none hand, and the narratives that establish the scenarios in\npeople’s mind, on the other. Once a scenario is imagined it may\nassume a life on its own, and this explains partly the creative power\nof a good thought experiment. Experimental results may obtain that\nactually run counter to the narrative that initiated the discussion of\nan imagined scenario. Besides, thought experiments should be\ndistinguished from thinking about experiments, from merely imagining\nany experiments to be conducted outside the imagination, and from\npsychological experiments with thoughts, though there may be some\noverlap. They should also be distinguished from counterfactual\nreasoning in general, as they seem to require an experimental element\n(i.e., visualized, touched, heard, etc.), which explains the\nimpression that something is experienced in a thought experiment\n(Brown 1991 [2011]). In other words, though many call any\ncounterfactual or hypothetical situation a thought experiment (see,\ne.g., Rescher 1991), this appears too encompassing. It is a quite\ndifferent matter as to whether there is a logical structure common to\nall of thought experiments. Based on considerations of logical\nstructure, a taxonomy has been proposed according to which all thought\nexperiments fall into two classes: “Necessity Refuters”\nand “Possibility Refuters” (see Sorensen 1990,\n132–160). Such proposals especially fuel the debate about\nidentity conditions of thought experiments. What modifications to\nlogical structure does a thought experiment tolerate before it ceases\nto exist and a new one is born? In other words, how much emphasis on\npropositional characteristics in appropriate is the analysis of\nthought experiments?\n\n\nLooking at the development of the discussion about thought experiments\nover the past thirty years, it is fair to say that thought experiments\nwere primarily an important topic in the philosophy of science and the\nphilosophy of philosophy (“metaphilosophy”), before the\nscope widened up at a later point. There is a simple reason for that\npath. At the core of the discussion sits a relatively simple\nepistemological challenge that is presented in a particularly powerful\nmanner by numerous thought experiments that the history of science has\nto offer. They suggest that we can learn about the real world by\nvirtue of merely thinking about imagined scenarios. But how can we\nlearn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking in such a\nway? Are there really thought experiments that enable us to acquire\nnew knowledge about nature without new empirical data? If so, where\ndoes the new information come from if not from contact with the realm\nof investigation under consideration in an imagined scenario? Finally,\nhow can we distinguish good from bad instances of thought experiments?\nThese questions seem urgent with respect to scientific thought\nexperiments, because many “recognize them as an occasionally\npotent tool for increasing our understanding of nature.…\nHistorically their role is very close to the double one played by\nactual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thought\nexperiments can disclose nature’s failure to conform to a previously\nheld set of expectations. Second, they can suggest particular ways in\nwhich both expectation and theory must henceforth be revised.”\n(Kuhn 1977, p. 241 and 261) The questions surrounding the\nepistemological challenge that certain scientific thought experiments\npose are also urgent regarding thought experiments outside of the\nsciences. This is especially true with respect to philosophy itself.\nPhilosophy offers numerous examples of thought experiments that play a\nrole similar in importance to some scientific thought experiments. And\nthis fact provokes in turn further inquiries into the relationship\nbetween the sciences and philosophy, especially with respect to\nphenomena that implicate both the sciences and philosophy, such as the\nmind (see Wilkes 1988; Young 2013).\n\n If scientific practice has room for thought experiments, then the\nquestion arises as to why we would want philosophical methodology to\nbe more discriminatory in this respect. One reason that is often\noffered is that results of scientific thought experiments may be\nsubjected to further empirical testing. This can’t be done for\nphilosophical thought experiments. It seems difficult to accept such a\ncategorical separation of science and philosophy. The 17th century saw\nsome of the most brilliant practitioners of thought experimentation in\nGalileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz, all of whom pursued the\nproject of “natural philosophy.” And in our own time, the\ncreation of quantum mechanics and relativity are almost unthinkable\nwithout the crucial role played by thought experiments, most of which\nrelate to important philosophical issues that arise from these\nscientific theories. Besides, much of ethics, philosophy of language,\nand philosophy of mind is based on the results of thought experiments\nin a way that seems very similar to scientific thought experiments\n(though some might contest this), including Searle’s Chinese room,\nPutnam’s twin earth, and Jackson’s Mary the colour\nscientist. Philosophy, even more than the sciences, would be severely\nimpoverished without thought experiments. These observations partly\nexplain why it has been argued that a more “unified” account of\nthought experiments is desirable (see Boniolo 1997; Cooper 2005,\npp. 329–330; Gähde 2000). Of course, it is important not to\ndownplay the significant differences between the sciences and\nphilosophy. But an account of thought experiments seems more powerful\nif it can do justice to the fact that not only in the sciences we find\nmany of them.\n\n\nThere have been several attempts to define “thought\nexperiment” along the lines of traditional conceptual analysis\n(see, e.g., Picha 2011; McComb 2013), but likely it will be better to\nleave the term loosely characterized, so as not to prejudice the\nongoing investigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to what\nthought experiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (see\nHäggqvist 2009), but this does not mean that we need to begin\nwith a technical definition, specifying necessary and sufficient\nconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal with\nremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,\nreligion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to refer\nto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well as\nthose already mentioned, there are Newton’s bucket, Heisenberg’s\ngamma-ray microscope, Einstein’s elevator, Leibniz’s mill, Parfit’s\npeople who split like amoebas, and Thomson’s violinist. Everyone is\nprobably familiar with some of these. Less familiar thought\nexperiments include the mouse that breaks into the tabernacle of a\nmedieval Roman Catholic Church building to feed on the consecrated\nwafers in there (see Fehige 2011). Roman Catholic Christians believe\nthat a consecrated wafer is the body of Christ. The “substance” of the\nwafer, understood in terms of Aristotelian categories, is believed to\nbe replaced. In its place is the “substance” of Christ’s body after\nconsecration by a priest. Only the Aristotelian “accidents” of the\nwafer remain intact (smell, colour, texture, etc.). Does the mouse eat\nthe body of Christ (if any human actually does)? Another example is\n“the dome”which is to prove indeterminism in Newtonian\nphysics. Imagine a mass sitting on a radially symmetric surface in a\ngravitational field. Guided by Newton’s laws of motion one comes to\nrealize that the mass can either remain at rest for all times, or\nspontaneously move in an arbitrary direction (see Norton 2008). This\nthought experiment triggers a number of very interesting questions\nconcerning the nature of Newtonian theory, the meaning of\n“physical”, and the role of idealizations in physics. And,\nof course, does it show what it claims? (see Malament 2008).\n\n\nIn the following we will first provide a characterization of thought\nexperiments in light of examples. A proposal follows for classifying\nthought experiments, before reviewing the state of the debate on\nthought experiments as such, preceded by some remarks about the\nhistory of philosophical inquiry into the nature of thought\nexperiments. We conclude by highlighting some trends in discussions\nsurrounding the so-called laboratory of the mind.\n\nTheorizing about thought experiments usually turns on the details or\nthe patterns of specific cases. Familiarity with a wide range of\nexamples is crucial for commentators, and the list is very long (see,\ne.g., Stuart et al. 2018, pp. 558–560) We will provide a few\nhere. One of the most beautiful early instances (in Lucretius, De\nRerum Natura 1.951–987; see Bailey 1950, pp. 58–59)\nattempts to show that space is infinite: if there is a purported\nboundary to the universe, we can toss a spear at it. If the spear\nflies through, it isn’t a boundary after all; if the spear bounces\nback, then there must be something beyond the supposed edge of space,\na cosmic wall that stopped the spear, a wall that is itself in space.\nEither way, there is no edge of the universe; thus, space is infinite.\nThis example nicely illustrates many of the most common features of\nwhat it means to engage in the conduct of thought experiments: we\nvisualize some situation that we have set up in the imagination; we\nlet it run or we carry out an operation; we see what happens; finally,\nwe draw a conclusion. The example also illustrates the fallibility of\nthought experiments. Since the time of Lucretius, we’ve learned how to\nconceptualize space so that it could be both finite and unbounded.\nImagine a circle, which is a one dimensional space. As we move around,\nthere is no edge, but it is nevertheless finite. The universe might be\na three-dimensional version of this topology. It is, therefore, true\nthat we must try to be mindful of unexpected limitations due to\n“physical scale effects,” (see Klee 2008) or other such things when\nimagining counterfactual scenarios. Figure 1. “Welcome to the edge of the\nUniverse” \nOften a real experiment that is the analogue of a thought experiment\nis impossible for physical, technological, ethical, or financial\nreasons (see, e.g., Sorensen 1992, pp. 200–202); but this\nneedn’t be a defining condition of thought experiments. The main point\nis that we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking, and\ntherein lies the great interest for philosophy. How is it possible\nto learn apparently new things about nature without new empirical\ndata? One possible answer is to claim that we possess a great\nstore of “instinctive knowledge” picked up from\nexperience. This is the solution that Ernst Mach offered (see Mach,\n1897 and 1905; for most instructive assessments of his views see\nKühne 2006, pp. 165–202, and Sorensen 1992, pp.\n51–75). We will get back to his solution further down. It\nremains one of the major accounts of how thought experiments work. One\nof Mach’s favourite examples is due to Simon Stevin (see Mach, 1883,\npp. 48–58). When a chain is draped over a double frictionless\nplane, as in Fig. 2a, how will it move? Add some links as in Fig. 2b.\nNow it is obvious. The initial setup must have been in static\nequilibrium. Otherwise, we would have a perpetual motion machine; and\naccording to our experience-based “instinctive knowledge,”\nsays Mach, this is impossible. We do not have to perform the\nexperiment in the real world, which we could not do, anyway, since it\nwould require a perfectly frictionless plane. Nevertheless the outcome\nseems compelling. (a) (b) Figure 2. “How will it move?” \nJudith Thomson provided one of the most striking and effective thought\nexperiments in the moral realm (see Thomson 1971). Her example is\naimed at a popular anti-abortion argument that goes something like\nthis: the fetus is an innocent person. All innocent persons have a\nright to life. Abortion results in the death of a fetus. Therefore,\nabortion is morally wrong. In her thought experiment we are asked to\nimagine a famous violinist falling into a coma. The society of music\nlovers determines from medical records that you and you alone can save\nthe violinist’s life by being hooked up to him for nine months. The\nmusic lovers break into your home while you are asleep and hook the\nunconscious (and unknowing, hence innocent) violinist to you. You may\nwant to unhook him, but you are then faced with this argument put\nforward by the music lovers: the violinist is an innocent person. All\ninnocent persons have a right to life. Unhooking him will result in\nhis death. Therefore, unhooking him is morally wrong. However, the\nargument, even though it has the same structure as the anti-abortion\nargument, does not seem convincing in this case. You would be very\ngenerous to remain attached for nine months, but you are not morally\nobligated to do so. The parallel with the abortion case is evident.\nThomson’s thought experiment is effective in distinguishing two\nconcepts that had previously been run together: “right to\nlife” and “right to what is needed to sustain life.”\nThe fetus and the violinist might each have the former, but it is not\nevident that either has the latter. The upshot is that even if the\nfetus has a right to life (which Thomson does not believe but allows\nfor the sake of the argument), it may still be morally permissible to\nabort. Those opposed to Thomson’s view have two options. They can\neither dismiss her thought experiment as a useless fiction. In fact,\nthought experiments as a method in ethics have their critics (see,\ne.g., Dancy 1985). Alternatively, they can provide a different\nversion of the same scenario to challenge the conclusion. It is a very\nintriguing feature of thought experiments that they can be\n“rethought” (see Bokulich 2001). Real experiments are\nfrequently open to reinterpretation, too. In this respect there does\nnot seem to be a principled difference.  \nLike arguments, thought experiments can be criticized in different\nways. Perhaps the set up is faulty; perhaps the conclusions drawn from\nthe thought experiment are not justified. Similar criticisms can arise\nin real experiments. Counter thought experiments are perhaps another\nform of criticism. They do not target the premises or conclusions\ninvolved in a particular thought experiment but question the\nphenomenon, i.e. the non-propositional heart of an imagined scenario\n(see Brown 2007). For example, Daniel Dennett is convinced that\nFrank Jackson’s Mary thought experiment is poor evidence to oppose\nphysicalism in philosophy of mind. In Jackson’s version, Mary, who\nknows everything physics and the neurosciences can possibly know about\ncolours but grew up in a colourless environment (seeing only black,\nwhite and grey things), allegedly learns something new when she sees a\nred tomato for the first time. Now she knows what it is like to\nexperience red. This is an argument for qualia as something over and\nabove the physical. Instead of a red tomato, Dennett, in his version\nof the thought experiment, presents Mary with a bright blue banana. In\nhis version of the story (which seems just as plausible as Jackson’s),\nMary balks and says she is being tricked, since she knows that bananas\nare yellow, and this, says Mary, is a consequence of knowing\neverything physical about colour perception. Mary does not learn\nanything new when she sees coloured objects for the first time, so\nthere is no case against physicalism after all. Jackson’s initial\nthought experiment was very persuasive, but Dennett’s was equally so,\nthus, undermining Jackson’s argument. \nClearly, thought experiments are characterized by an intriguing\nplasticity, and this raises the interesting question of what it is\nthat preserves the identity of a thought experiment. Replacing a red\ntomato with a blue banana might still leave us with the same thought\nexperiment––slightly revised. But, at what point do we get\na new thought experiment? This is not merely a question about\nconceptual vagueness. It helps to facilitate a discussion of the\nintuitively most plausible view about the cognitive efficacy of\nthought experiments, according to which this power depends on their\nbeing arguments, in a fairly strict sense of argument. John D. Norton\nholds such a view, which will be discussed below. In light of cases\nwhere the discussion of one and the same thought experiment played an\nimportant role in settling a dispute, the following problem arises:\nhow can one and the same thought experiment support opposing views\nabout a particular matter if the arguments that correspond to the\ndifferent versions of the thought experiment that were entertained by\nthe disputing parties are significantly different? The dilemma is: we\ncould say that if there is more than one argument then there is more\nthan one thought experiment involved in the dispute. But, if that is\ntrue then the disputing parties simply talked pass each other. One\nparty presented an argument that the other party ignored while\npresenting their own. Alternatively, we can say that one thought\nexperiment can correspond to many different arguments. But, if that is\ntrue then it becomes unclear in what non-trivial sense thought\nexperiments are supposed to be identical with arguments (see Bishop\n1999, and the response by Norton 2004, 63–64). \nThe plasticity of thought experiments coheres with another feature of\nthought experiments, namely that they seem to have “evidential\nsignificance only historically and locally, i.e., when and where\npremises that attribute evidential significance to it […] are\nendorsed.” (McAllister 1996, p. 248) \nMany taxonomies can be found in the literature. They are not mutually\nexclusive. We will present three of them. The first follows the type\nof purpose thought experiments serve. A very rudimentary version of it\ncan be found in (Mach, 1897 and 1905). Such a classification makes\nsense, because an “imaginary experiment should be judged on its\nspecific purpose.” (Krimsky 1973, p. 331) Thought experiments\nare conducted for diverse reasons (see, e.g., DeMay 2006; Sorensen\n1992, pp. 7–15), and this in a variety of areas, including the\neconomical (see, e.g., Herfeld 2019; Thoma 2016), educational (Helm\nand Gilbert 1985; Helm et al. 1985, Klassen 2006; Sriraman 2006;\nStonier 1990), historical (see, e.g., Maar 2014; Reiss 2009), literary\n(see, e.g., Davies 2007; Elgin 2004), mathematical (see, e.g. Brown\n1991 [2011], pp. 90–97; Glas 1999), moral (see, e.g., Hauerwas\n1996; Wilson 2016), natural (see Krimsky 1973), socio-political realm\n(see, e.g. Roberts 1993: Thaler 2016), and theological (see, e.g.,\nGregersen 2014; Fehige 2018). Thought experiments may be used to\nentertain. This is probably true of short stories or novels which some\nargue qualify as thought experiments if certain conditions apply (see,\ne.g., Davenport 1983). Some thought experiments fulfil a specific\nfunction within a theory (see Borsboom et al. 2002). Others are\nexecuted because it is impossible to run the experimental scenario in\nthe real world (see, e.g., Sorensen 1992,\npp. 200–202). Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate\nand clarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the\nprocess of understanding (see Behmel 2001). Again others serve as\nexamples in conceptual analysis (see Cohnitz 2006). And, then there\nare those that matter in the process of theory discovery (Praem and\nSteglich–Peterson 2015).  The thought experiments that have\nreceived most of the attention are taken to provide evidence for or\nagainst a theory, putting them on a par with real-world experiments\n(see, e.g., Gendler 2004). The different ways to use thought\nexperiments, of course, do not exclude one another. Most obviously,\nfor example, a thought experiment can both entertain and make a case\nagainst a theory. \nA second taxonomy classifies thought experiments in terms of logical\nstructure (see Sorensen 1992, pp. 132–166). The idea is to\ndivide all thought experiments into two types of “alethic\nrefuters”: “Although there are a number of ways to\nclassify thought experiments, a refutation format scores the most\npoints when judged by familiarity, specificity, and simplicity.\nAccording to this scheme, thought experiments aim at overturning\nstatements by disproving one of their modal consequences. Modalities\nare operators that are applied to propositions to yield new\npropositions. There are deontic modalities (permissible,\nforbidden), epistemic modalities (know, believe), and\nalethic modalities (possible, necessary). The alethic\nmodalities are the best–known and more–basic modality.\nHence, we won’t miss anything by concentrating on them.”\n(Sorensen 1992, p. 135) One type of thought experiment “is\ndesigned to refute a statement by showing that something ruled out as\nimpossible by that statement is really possible after all.”\n(Sorensen 1992, p. 135) The most discussed examples in the\nmetaphilosophical discussion on thought experiments is of such a type,\nnamely the Gettier scenarios (see Grundmann & Horvarth 2014;\nSaint-Germier 2019). They are designed to refute the claim that all\nknowledge is justified, true belief. They serve as a “necessity\nrefuter.” The other type collects examples of “possibility\nrefuters”. They don’t affirm “the possibility of the\nthought experiment’s content”. Instead, they establish\n“copossibilities”. A wonderful example is the scenario of\nan omnipotent God who faces the task of creating a stone too heavy for\nher to lift. It seems God cannot succeed. The notion of divine\nomnipotence causes some headaches here. \nA third taxonomy (see Brown 1986, pp. 4–11), which has not gone\nunchallenged (see Norton 1993b), is more limited than the fist two\ninsofar as it focuses largely on the class of those thought\nexperiments that are taken to function in theory choice, which is the\nuse of thought experiments that has been receiving most of the\nattention. According to this taxonomy, the main division is\nconstructive vs. destructive and resembles Karl Popper’s\ndistinction between apologetic and critical thought\nexperiments. Popper actually distinguishes between three types of\nthought experiments: heuristic (to illustrate a theory),\ncritical (against a theory) and apologetic (in\nfavour of a theory) (see Popper 1959). His case in favour of a\ncritical and against an apologetic use of thought experiments is very\nlimited. He focuses exclusively on quantum physics and doesn’t really\nsay much to address the primary epistemological challenge presented by\nthe success of critical thought experiments. \nAmong destructive thought experiments, the following\nsubtypes can be identified: the simplest of these is to draw out a\ncontradiction in a theory, thereby refuting it. The first part of\nGalileo’s famous falling bodies example does this. It shows that in\nAristotle’s account, a composite body (cannon ball and musket ball\nattached) would have to fall both faster and slower than the cannon\nball alone. A second subtype is constituted by those thought\nexperiments that aim to show that the theory in question is in\nconflict with other beliefs that we hold. Schrödinger’s\nwell-known cat paradox, for instance, does not show that quantum\ntheory (at least on some interpretations) is internally inconsistent\n(see Schrödinger 1935, p. 812; translation: Trimmer 1980, p.\n328): “A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the\nfollowing diabolical device (which must be secured against direct\ninterference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of\nradioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of one\nhour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability,\nperhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a\nrelay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic\nacid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one\nwould say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed.\nThe first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The q-function of the\nentire system would express this by having in it the living and the\ndead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal\nparts.” This thought experiment shows that quantum theory (as\ninterpreted by Bohr) is in conflict with some very powerful common\nsense beliefs we have about macro-sized objects such as\ncats––they cannot be both dead and alive in any sense\nwhatsoever. The bizarreness of superpositions in the atomic world is\nworrisome enough, says Schrödinger, but when it implies that same\nbizarreness at an everyday level, it is intolerable. There is a third\nsubtype of negative thought experiments, namely when, in effect, a\ncentral assumption or premise of the thought experiment itself is\nundermined. For example, as we have seen above, Thomson showed with\nher thought experiment that “right to life” and\n“right to what is needed to sustain life” had been run\ntogether. When distinguished, the argument against abortion is\nnegatively affected. \nA fourth sub-type of negative thought experiments are “counter\nthought experiments” (see Brown 2007). Norton very usefully\nintroduces a related idea:\n“thought-experiment/anti-thought-experiment pairs” (see\nNorton 2004, pp. 45–49). Above, we have already encountered\nthis subtype in our discussion of Lucretius’ spear-thought experiment,\nand with Dennett’s reply to Jackson’s much discussed Mary the colour\nscientist thought experiment. Here we would like to add one more\nexample, namely Mach’s counter thought experiment against absolute\nspace. In his Principia Mathematica, Newton offers a pair of\nthought experiments as evidence for absolute space. One is the bucket\nwith water climbing the wall, the other is a pair of spheres joined by\na cord that maintained its tension in otherwise empty space. The\nexplanation for these phenomena, argues Newton, is absolute space: the\nbucket and the joined spheres are rotating with respect to space\nitself. In response, Mach modifies the scenario and argues, contra\nNewton, that the two spheres would move toward one another thanks to\nthe tension in the cord, and if we rotated a very thick, massive ring\naround a stationary bucket, we would see the water climb the bucket\nwall. (For further discussion of Mach’s counter thought experiment to\nNewton’s see Kühne 2006, pp. 191–202). In short, the point\nof Mach’s counter thought experiments is to describe the phenomena of\nthe thought experiments’ scenarios differently, that is, to declare\nthat different things would happen. Mach’s counter thought experiment\nundermines our confidence in Newton’s. Absolute space might be a\nplausible explanation of the phenomena in Newton’s thought\nexperiments, but now, in light of Mach’s counter thought experiment,\nwe’re not so sure of the phenomena itself and thus of the idea of\nabsolute space. Figure 3. Stages in the bucket experiment Figure 4. Two spheres held by a cord in otherwise empty space \nTo be effective, counter thought experiments needn’t be very plausible\nat all. In a court of law a jury would convict provided guilt is\nestablished “beyond a reasonable doubt.” A common defence\nstrategy is to provide an alternative account of the evidence that has\njust enough plausibility to put the prosecution’s case into some\nmeasure of doubt. That is sufficient to undermine it. A counter\nthought experiment need only do that much to be effective, and in this\nsense it operates like a “necessity refuter” in Sorensen’s\nsense.  \nIn addition to destructive ones, there is a second type, the\nconstructive thought experiments. Unsurprisingly, there are\nmany ways they could provide positive support for a theory. One of\nthese is to provide a kind of illustration that makes a theory’s\nclaims clear and evident. In such cases thought experiments serve as a\nkind of heuristic aid. A result may already be well established, but\nthe thought experiment can lead to a very satisfying sense of\nunderstanding. In his Principia Mathematica, Newton provides\na wonderful example showing how the moon is kept in its orbit in just\nthe same way as an object falls to the earth (see Ducheyne 2006, pp.\n435–437). He illustrates this by means of a cannon shooting a\ncannon ball further and further. In the limit, the earth curves away\nas fast as the ball falls, with the eventual result being that the\ncannon ball will return to the spot where it was fired, and, if not\nimpeded, will go around again and again. This is what the moon is\ndoing. We could arrive at the same conclusion through calculation. But\nNewton’s thought experiment provides that elusive sense of\nunderstanding. It’s a wonderful example of the “aha\neffect” that is so typical of the many powerful thought\nexperiments. Figure 5. “The shot heard around the world” \nThomson’s violinist showed that abortion could be morally permissible\neven when the fetus has a right to life. Similarly, Einstein’s\nelevator showed that light will bend in a gravitational field, because\naccording to the principle of equivalence, there is no difference\nbetween such a frame of reference and one that is accelerating in free\nspace; the laws of physics are the same in all. Suppose then, an\nobserver is inside an elevator sealed off from the outside so that the\nobserver cannot tell whether he is in a gravitational field or\naccelerating. If it were accelerating, and if a light beam were to\nenter one side, then, due to the elevator’s motion, the beam would\nappear to drop or curve down as it crossed the elevator. Consequently,\nit would have to do the same thing if the elevator was in a\ngravitational field. Therefore, gravity ‘bends’ light.\n \nMaxwell’s demon showed that entropy could be decreased: The second law\nof thermodynamics implies that heat won’t pass from a cold body to a\nhot one. In classical thermodynamics this law is quite strict; but in\nMaxwell’s kinetic theory of heat there is a probability, though\nextremely small, of such an event happening. Some thought this a\nreductio ad absurdum of Maxwell’s theory. To show how it is possible\nto violate the second law, Maxwell imagined a tiny creature who\ncontrols a door between two chambers. Fast molecules from the cold box\nare let into the hot box, and slow molecules from the hot are allowed\ninto the cold. Thus, there will be an increase in the average speed in\nthe hot box and a decrease in the average speed of molecules in the\ncold. Since, on Maxwell’s theory, heat is just the average speed of\nthe molecules, there has been a flow of heat from a cold body to a hot\none.  \nParfit’s splitting persons shows that survival is a more important\nnotion than identity when considering personhood (for a critical\ndiscussion see Gendler 2002a). We say they “show” such\nand such, but, “purport to show” might be better, since\nsome of these thought experiments are quite contentious. What they\nhave in common is that they aim to establish something positive.\nUnlike destructive thought experiments, they are not trying to\ndemolish an existing theory, though they may do that in passing. In\nprinciple, given the fact that thought experiments can be rethought\n(see Bokulich 2001), and that the evidential significance is\ndependent on historical and local accomplishments (see McAllister\n1996), it cannot be irrelevant to identify the intention of the\nthought experimenter, if one wants to determine the type of a thought\nexperiment: “An imaginary experiment should be judged on its\nspecific purpose.” (Krimsky 1973, p. 331) \nThe practice of thought experiments is not an invention of modern\nscience, although there can be no doubt that the notion of a thought\nexperiment didn’t come into existence before the 18th century.\nAccordingly, the view is problematic that the Pre-Socratics\n“invented thought experimentation as a cognitive procedure and\npracticed it with great dedication and versatility.” (Rescher\n2005, p. 2) With such a claim one risks underestimating the\nentanglement of concepts and corresponding reality. It is probably\nmuch more correct to say something like the following: “There is\nno ancient Greek term corresponding to what we nowadays refer to as a\nthought experiment, and presumably ancient philosophers did not have\nour modern notion of a thought experiment. But there is no doubt that\nthey did use thought experiments. In fact, they often employed them in\nways similar to those of contemporary philosophers, that is, both for\ndefending their own theories as well as for refuting the theories of\ntheir opponents.”(Ierodiakonou 2018, p. 31; see also Becker\n2018; Diamond 2002, pp. 229–232; Fuhrer 2009; Glas 1999;\nIerodiakonou 2005; Ierodiakonou and Roux (eds.) 2011; Irvine 1991;\nRescher 1991 and 2005, pp. 61–72). The situation is similar\nwith respect to medieval natural philosophy, although there are\nfurther nuances to be considered (see King 1991). According to Edward\nGrant, during the late Middle Ages “the imagination became a\nformidable instrument in natural philosophy and theology in ways that\nwould have astonished ancient Greek natural philosophers, especially\nAristotle.” (Grant 2007, p. 201) But this doesn’t mean that we\nhave reason to think of Aristotle as an opponent of the conduct of\nthought experiments. On the contrary, “Aristotle uses thought\nexperiments for argumentative persuasion and in places where, due to\nthe obscure nature of the subject matter or the counterintuitive\nnature of the thesis they are meant to support, insight cannot be\nreadily communicated by appeal to observational facts.”\n(Corcilius 2018, p. 73) With a few exceptions that involved problems\nof motion, “the scholastics” made no meaningful effort to\ntransform their hypothetical conclusions into specific knowledge about\nthe physical world. They did, however, assume that although these\nhypothetical conclusions were naturally impossible, God could produce\nthem supernaturally if he wished. Special attention received also a\nclass of medieval thought experiments that does not rely on\ncounterfactuals but also depends on theological assumptions to study\nmatters non-theological, namely those thought experiments involving\nangels, whose existence were affirmed at that time (see Perler 2008).\nAngels are gone by now (see Clark 1992), but not thought experiments.\nWhile most thought experiments involving angels have Christianity as\ntheir context, there is evidence of the practice of thought\nexperiments also in the context of Islam and Judaism (see McGinnis\n2018; Fisch 2019). In fact, the case has been made “that Ibn\nSina is the first philosopher in the Aristotelian tradition, and thus\nperhaps the first in Western philosophy overall, to try to identify\nthe psychological processes that go into postulating a hypothetical\nscenario. Ibn Sina also exhibits an interest in accounting for why,\nand to what extent, such psychological acts are thought to carry\nweight in our study of nature.” (Kukkonen 2014, p. 434) \nErnst Mach is commonly credited with introducing the word\n“thought experiment” (Gadankenexperiment) and\nthereby coining a term for philosophical discussion (most recently\nKrauthausen 2015, p. 15). “ This view is incorrect, however!\n[…] it can be substantiated that it was used […] already\nin 1811.” (Witt-Hansen 1976, p. 48; see also Buzzoni 2008, pp.\n14–15; 61–65; Cohnitz 2008; Kühne 2005, pp.\n92–224; Moue et al. 2006, p. 63). The conceptual history of\n“thought experiment” goes back at least to the Danish\n“Tankeexperiment,” as it was used by Hans-Christian\nØrsted. We can go back even further and find in the work of the\nGerman philosopher-scientist Georg Lichtenberg (1742–1799) a\ntacit theory of “experiments with thoughts and ideas.”\nThese experiments help to overcome habits of thought that can inhibit\nscientific progress, and make possible an enlightened philosophy (see\nSchildknecht 1990, pp. 21; 123–169; Schöne 1982).\nLichtenberg’s “aphoristic experiments” (see Stern 1963,\npp. 112–126) reflect “that Lichtenberg’s scientific\npreoccupations are the formal and thematic prolegomena to his work as\na literary artist.” (Stern 1963, p. 126) Lichtenberg’s\nreflections on thought experimentation resemble those of Popper and\nThomas S. Kuhn, and it is plausible to think of him as one important\nfigure of the very first period in the history of philosophical\ninquiry into thought experiments (see Fehige and Stuart 2014).  Accordingly, the modern history of the philosophical investigation\ninto thought experiments can be divided into four stages: in the 18th\nand 19th century the awareness of the importance of thought\nexperiments in philosophy and science emerges. In addition to\nLichtenberg, special mention should be made of Novalis (see Daiber\n2001; Fehige 2013a), and Hans-Christian Ørsted. The topic\nreemerges in a more systematic manner at the beginning of the 20th\ncentury with little relation to the attempts made at the first stage.\nThe stakeholders of the second stage were Pierre Duhem, Mach, and\nAlexius Meinong (see Duhem 1913, pp. 304–311; Mach, 1883, pp.\n48–58, 1897 and 1905; Meinong 1907). A third stage, probably due\nto the rediscovery of the importance of scientific practice for a\nproper understanding of science, followed in the first part of the\nsecond half of the 20th century. Again, the contributions of this\nstage bear little relation to the two previous stages. While the third\nperiod has seen a number of noteworthy contributions (Cole 1983; Dancy\n1985; Dennett 1985; Fodor 1964; Helm; Gilbert 1985; Helm et al. 1985;\nKrimsky 1973; McMullin 1985; Myers 1986; Poser 1984; Prudovsky 1989;\nRehder 1980a,b; Yourgrau 1962 and 1967), the protagonists of this\nperiod were Alexandre Koyré, Kuhn and Popper. The ongoing\nphilosophical exploration of thought experiments began in the 1980s,\nand marks the fourth stage. Arguably, it has been the most prolific\none of all four stages. With some very important sign-postings in\nplace (Horowitz and Massey (eds.) 1991; Sorensen 1992a, b, c; Wilkes\n1988) the ongoing discussion took off in light of a debate between\nJames Robert Brown and John D. Norton (see for a concise statement of\neach position Brown 2004; Norton 2004), which many have found useful\nto establish a contrast with their own alternative accounts of thought\nexperiments. These views “represent the extremes of platonic\nrationalism and classic empiricism, respectively.” (Moue et\nal. 2006, p. 69) They will be described below. \nWe want to emphasize at this point that not all of the numerous\ncontributions to the discussion about thought experiments target\nprimarily the epistemological challenge to which advocates of the\naccounts respond that this section is going to feature in some detail.\nBut, of course, the challenge sits at the centre of the discussion,\nand this explains to a great deal what every contributor remarks about\nit. Our aim in this section is to demonstrate the variety of accounts\nthat have been proposed to makes sense of the cognitive power many\nthought experiments are credited with. We cannot discuss here all the\nauthors who are representative for each type of view which we will\nidentify, including: (A) the “skeptical objection”, (B)\nthe “intuition–based account”, (C) the\n“argument view”, (D) “conceptual\nconstructivism”, (E) “experimentalism”, and (F) the\n“mental–model account”. \n(A) The Sceptical Objection  \nOf course, particular thought experiments have been contested. But for\nthe most part, the practice of thought experiments in the sciences has\nbeen cheerfully accepted. Pierre Duhem, the great historian of\nphysics, is almost alone in what has been understood as an outright\ncondemnation of scientific thought experiments (see Duhem 1913, pp.\n304–311). A thought experiment is no substitute for a real\nexperiment, he claimed, and should be forbidden in science, including\nscience education. However, in view of the important role of actual\nthought experiments in the history of physics — from Galileo’s\nfalling bodies, to Newton’s bucket, to Einstein’s elevator — it\nis unlikely that anyone will feel or should feel much sympathy for\nDuhem’s strictures. We hasten to add that Buzzoni (2018) questions the\nvalidity of this reading of Duhem, and argues that already Mach’s\nreception of Duhem’s views suggests a more nuanced reading of Duhem’s\nposition. \nPhilosophers can be as critical as Duhem when it comes to thought\nexperimenting in their own field (see Cohnitz 2006b; Peijnenburg;\nAtkinson 2003; Thagard 2014; Sorensen 1992a, pp. 7–50;\nStuart 2014; Wilson 2016). At least thought experiments in science,\nthe skeptic claims, can be tested by physical experiment. However,\nthis is clearly false, since frictionless planes and universes empty\nof all material bodies cannot be produced in any laboratory. True, the\nresults of philosophical thought experiments cannot be even\napproximately tested. But, skeptics say little about why thought\nexperiments enjoy such popularity in philosophy. We are inclined to\nsay that skeptics underestimate the importance of thought experiments\nfor the creative mind in any field. \nFew are outright skeptics, however. Many take a more ambiguous stance.\nSören Häggqvist, for example, has developed a normative\nmodel for philosophical thought experiments (see Häggqvist 1996\nand 2009). Surprisingly, none of the commonly accepted philosophical\nthought experiments satisfies his model. And the process of\nidentifying successful thought experiments is only the first step in\naddressing the central epistemological challenge posed by thought\nexperiments. It gets much messier once we begin to ask exactly how\nreliable “successful” thought experiments are. Granted,\nthere is some justice in worrying about the reliability of\nphilosophical thought experiments (see, e.g., Klee 2008). This might\nbe true for ethics (see Dancy 1985, Jackson 1992; Wilson 2016),\nconceptual analysis (see Fodor 1964), and philosophy of mind:\n“A popular strategy in philosophy is to construct a certain sort\nof thought experiment I call intuition pump. […] Intuition\npumps are often abused, though seldom deliberately.” (Dennett\n1985, p. 12) The claim by Dennett and others is that thought\nexperiments too often rest on prejudice and faulty common sense; they\nare inherently conservative, while real science will likely result in\nhighly-counterintuitive outcomes. Dennett believes that thought\nexperiments rest on naive “folk concepts,” which is why they can\nbe so misguided. It is far from clear that this is a fair charge.\nEverything involved in Galileo’s thought experiment that produced\nthe principle of relativity could be called “folk concepts.” If we\nare inside a ship and perform a number of experiments, such as walking\nabout, tossing a ball, watching birds fly about, we could not tell\nwhether we are at rest in port or sailing over a smooth sea. The\nupshot is that nature behaves the same either way; the laws of nature\nare the same in any inertial frame. This result is profound and is\nstill with us in Einstein’s relativity, whether it is folk physics\nor not.  \nFrequently discussed is the skeptical challenge raised by Kathleen\nWilkes. She expresses a deep suspicion of scenarios such as Derek\nParfit’s people splitting like an amoeba (see Parfit 1987; Gendler\n2002a). Wilkes wants philosophy “to use science fact rather than\nscience fiction or fantasy” (Wilkes 1988, p. 1), and therefore\nto refrain from using thought experiments because they are “both\nproblematic and positively misleading.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 2) She\nclaims that thought experiments about personal identity in particular\noften fail to provide the background conditions against which the\nexperiment is set (see Wilkes 1988, p. 7). She thinks we would not\nknow what to say if we encountered someone who split like an amoeba.\nShe insists that a legitimate thought experiment must not violate the\nknown laws of nature. We do agree with Wilkes that underdetermination\ncan be a problem. But instead of dismissing thought experiments in\nphilosophy we should consider it a crucial factor in assessing the\nquality of a thought experiment (see Rescher 2005, pp. 9–14).\nThe more detailed the imaginary scenario in the relevant aspects, the\nbetter the thought experiment (see Brendel 2004, pp. 97–99;\nHäggqvist 1996, p. 28). \nWe also agree that the inferences drawn in thought experimenting are\nhighly problematic if the hypothetical scenario “is inadequately\ndescribed.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 8) But Wilkes seems to think that\nthe lack of description is unavoidable, which supposedly amounts to a\nreason against philosophical thought experiments on personal identity\nbecause persons are not natural kinds. This makes it impossible to\nfill in necessary information to make the thought experiment work\ngiven its unavoidable underdetermination. Wilkes thinks that\n“whenever we are examining the ranges of concepts that do not\npick on natural kinds, the problem of deciding what is or what is not\n‘relevant’ to the success of the thought experiment is yet\nmore problematic than the same question as it arises in science; and,\nunlike the scientific problem, it may not even have an answer in\nprinciple.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 15) She adds that scientific laws\n— especially those describing biological kinds like human beings\n— “are not disjoint and independent, detachable from one\nanother […]. They are interrelated, to varying degrees of\ncourse.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 29) This implies, for example, that\n“a full psychophysiological account of the processes of human\nperception must at some stage link up with part at least of linguistic\nability; for we typically see things under a certain description, and\nthat description may be a very sophisticated one.” (Wilkes\n1988, p. 29) These considerations have her rule out experiments that\nchallenge the human monopoly of personhood. No thought experiment,\nclaims Wilkes, is well conceived if it involves non-human animals or\ncomputers as persons. But also those thought experiments can be ruled\nout which involve the “fission or fusion of humans”\nbecause it is not theoretically possible. “The total impact of\nthe sum of laws that group us together as human beings (a natural kind\ncategory) precludes our splitting into two […] or fusing with\nsomeone else.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 36) \nOne can ascertain here all too well the inherent difficulties in\nthinking about personal identity and the limited benefit some thought\nexperiments might have for what is deemed the proper metaphysics of\npersonal identity. Nevertheless, good reasons have been given in\nfavour of the use of thought experiments about personal identity (see\nBeck 2006; Kolak 1993; Hershenov 2008). We also feel that the\nproblems about thought experiments on personal identity reveal more\nabout the intricate nature of the subject than about the usefulness of\nphilosophical thought experiments. And, disregarding other\nshortcomings in Wilkes’ skepticism (for further discussion of Wilkes’\nviews see Beck 1992; Brooks 1994; Focquaert 2003; Häggqvist\n1996, pp. 27–34), her suggestion that thought experimental\nscenarios would have to satisfy current scientific knowledge about the\nrelevant entities featured in a thought experiment is highly\nimplausible. We learn a great deal about the world and our theories\nwhen we wonder, for instance, what would have happened after the big\nbang if the law of gravity had been an inverse cube law instead of an\ninverse square. Would stars have failed to form? Reasoning about such\na scenario is perfectly coherent and very instructive, even though it\nviolates a law of nature. \nTo some extent we should share Wilkes’s concern that thought\nexperimenting seems to be constrained only by relevant logical\nimpossibilities and what seems intuitively acceptable. This is indeed\nproblematic because intuitions can be highly misleading and relevant\nlogical impossibilities are fairly ungrounded if they cannot be\nsupplemented by relevant theoretical impossibilities based on current\nscience in order to avoid the jump into futile fantasy. But in order\nto dismiss thought experimenting as a useful philosophical tool one\nhas to show that intuition cannot be a source of knowledge and that an\nepistemic tool should be useless because there is a serious chance it\ncan fail. Timothy Williamson has argued that we should forget about\nintuition as a cushion in the philosophical armchair (see Williamson\n2004a,b, 2008, pp. 179–207, and 2009; see also Schaffer 2017).\nThe importance of intuitions in philosophy has been neglected in the\npast (see Williamson 2004b, p. 109–110), and for too long\nintuition didn’t receive the attention it deserves (see, e.g., DePaul\nand Ramsey (eds.) 1998). Besides the traditional divide between\nempiricists, rationalists and skeptics, it is not only a very\nnon-uniform use of the word “intuition” that makes it\ndifficult to assess the progress of the last years of philosophical\ninquiry about intuitions. The situation has been complicated by the\ncontributions of experimental philosophers on intuitions who add\ndifferent reasons to question their reliability (see for a careful\ncritique of those reasons: Ludwig 2007; see also Ludwig 2018).\nGenerally speaking, the reliability of intuitions has been challenged\non two grounds. One stems from an evolutionary explanation of the\ncapacity to intuit; another is due to experiments which supposedly\nshow the cultural relativity or racial and gender sensitivity of\nintuitions (see, e.g., Buckwalter and Stich 2010): “…a\nsubstantial list of philosophical intuitions vary across demographic\ngroups and…they are influenced by a number of prima\nfacies irrelevant factors…Some writers…have urged\nthat these findings justify a thoroughgoing skepticism about the use\nof intuitions as evidence in philosophy…But we think this\nconclusion is much too strong…” (Stich & Toba 2018, p.\n379) After all, knowledge without intuitions (if only common sense assumptions) seems  impossible.  \nThe recent discussion of intuitions in epistemology has barely made an\nimpact on philosophical reflections about thought experiments. As far\nas philosophical thought experiments are concerned, this is as it\nshould be, according to Williamson. In this respect George Bealer can\nbe cited in support of Williamson, because for Bealer the talk about\nphilosophical thought experiments reveals a conceptual confusion.\nPhilosophy, he claims, is about “rational intuitions” and\nthought experiments can be only about “physical\nintuitions” (see Bealer 1998, pp. 207–208, and 2002, p.\n74). To many, this is an implausible claim based on a deeply\nproblematic “phenomenology of intuitions” resulting in a\nstrict separation of “rational intuitions” from\n“physical intuitions”, on such grounds as an alleged\nimmutability of “rational intuitions”. There are good\nreasons to believe that thought experiments appeal to intuitions in\norder to give us new insights about different realms of investigation,\nincluding philosophy. This kind of positive connection is what\nWilliamson has in mind when addressing the role of intuitions in\nphilosophical thought experiments like the famous Gettier cases, which\novernight found acceptance by the philosophical community in their aim\nto refute the view that knowledge is justified true belief. While\nWilliamson expects “armchair methods to play legitimately a more\ndominant role in future philosophy” (Williamson 2009, p. 126),\nhe thinks that “we should stop talking about intuition.”\n(Williamson 2004b, p. 152). This does not impress proponents of what\nwe call an intuition-based account of thought experiments, and\nprobably for good reasons, given the problems in Williamson’s approach\n(see, e.g., Dohrn 2016; Ichikawa and Jarvis 2009; Schaffer 2017),\nand the empirical evidence in favour of the positive role that\nintuitions can play in human cognition. \n(B) The Intuition–Based Account  \nWhat we term the “intuition–based account” of\nthought experiments comes in a naturalistic version (see Brendel 2004;\nGendler 2007), and in a Platonic version (see Brown 1991a [2011]). We\nbegin with a discussion of the latter. Brown holds that in a few\nspecial cases we do go well beyond the old empirical data to acquire a\npriori knowledge of nature (see also Koyré 1968). Galileo\nshowed that all bodies fall at the same speed with a brilliant thought\nexperiment that started by destroying the then reigning Aristotelian\naccount. The latter holds that heavy bodies fall faster than light\nones (H > L). But consider Figure 6, in which a\nheavy cannon ball (H) and light musket ball (L) are\nattached together to form a compound object (H+L);\nthe latter must fall faster than the cannon ball alone. Yet the\ncompound object must also fall slower, since the light part will act\nas a drag on the heavy part. Now we have a\ncontradiction: H+L >\nH and H > H+L. That’s the end\nof Aristotle’s theory. But there is a bonus, since the right account\nis now obvious: they all fall at the same speed (H =\nL = H+L). Figure 6. Galileo: “I don’t even have to look” \nBrown claims this is a priori (though still fallible) knowledge of\nnature, since there are no new data involved, nor is the conclusion\nderived from old data. Moreover, is it some sort of logical truth (for\nthe latest and most technical challenge of this claim see Urbaniak\n2012). This account of thought experiments can be further developed by\nlinking the a priori epistemology to accounts of laws of nature that\nhold that laws are relations among objectively existing abstract\nentities. It is thus a form of Platonism, not unlike Platonic accounts\nof mathematics such as that urged by Kurt Gödel.  \nThe two most often repeated arguments against this sort of Platonism are:\nit does not identify criteria to distinguish good from bad thought\nexperiments, and it violates the principle of ontological parsimony.\nHe would consider these weak objections.  Perhaps they find widespread acceptance\nbecause Platonism seems to be unfashionable these days (see Grundmann\n2018), given the general popularity of various forms of naturalism. If\nintuitions really do the job in a thought experiment, the first\nobjection is weak because neither rationalists nor empiricists have a\ntheory about the reliability of intuitions. So the objection should be\nthat intuitions probably just do not matter in human cognition.\nHowever, there are good reasons to question the truth of this claim\n(see Myers 2004). This is not to marginalize the problems that arise\nwhen admitting intuitions as a source of knowledge and justification,\nespecially in philosophy (see Hitchcock 2012).  \nAs for the second objection, the appeal to Occam’s razor is in general\nproblematic when it is employed to rule out a theory. Whatever we\neliminate by employing the principle of parsimony we can easily\nreintroduce it by an inference to the best explanation (see Meixner\n2000). And this is exactly what a Platonist contends his or her\nPlatonism about thought experimenting to be, while conceding that the\nPlatonic intuition appears miraculous. But are they really more\nmiraculous than sense perception, which seems similar in many respects\nto Platonic intuition? One might want to say yes, because supposedly\nwe have no clue at all how Platonic intuition works but we do have\nsome idea about the nature of sense perception. We know that if an\nobject is far away it appears smaller in vision, and under certain\nlight conditions the same object can look quite different. However, is\nit really impossible to state similar rules to capture the nature of\nPlatonic intuition? If you are drunk or lack attention you most\nprobably will not be very successful in intuiting anything of\nphilosophical value.  \nA review of the relevant psychological literature will reveal further\ncriteria that could be employed to identify good and bad conditions\nfor Platonic intuition while thought experimenting. Yet, proponents of\nthe naturalistic version of the intuition–based account wonder\nhow necessary Platonism is once this move is entertained in defence of\nthe reliability of intuitions (see Miščević 2004).\nElke Brendel defines intuitions as mental propositional attitudes\naccompanied with a strong feeling of certainty. In her view, we can\ntell two stories to make sense of their cognitive power and\nplasticity. One story relates to our biological constitution and\nevolutionary past. The other is about membership in specialized\ncommunities. Brendel’s account raises many questions, but it is\ndifficult to resist its appeal. A universal set is appealing to anyone\nnot trained in logic because most things we are familiar with can come\nin sets, such as books, tables, and philosophers. A set of all sets\nseems intuitively plausible. The intuition disappears once you worked\nyourself through the problems arising from the idea of a set of all\nsets. Brendel is quick to insist that such relativity of our\nintuitions doesn’t imply that they are cognitively useless. Without\nintuitions, we probably wouldn’t have knowledge, and thought\nexperiments are sometimes the only way to access the intuitions that\nguide us in our cognitive lives. (see Brendel 2004) \n(C) The Argument View  \nJohn D. Norton is the most influential advocate of what we call\n“the argument view” of thought experiments (see Norton\n1991, 1993, 1996, 2004a,b, 2008). Even though the argument view seems\nto be a natural option for empiricists, it seems that most empiricists\nfind Norton’s argument view too strong. For this reason, many\nparticipants in the debate about thought experiments place themselves\nbetween the extremes of Norton and Brown, who function as useful foils\nfor apparently more moderate outlooks. Perhaps (with tongue in cheek) they could \nagree with Bernard Shaw on the virtues of\nmoderation, when Shaw said of the typical member of the middle class\nthat he is moderately honest, moderately intelligent, and moderately\nfaithful to his spouse. Norton claims that any thought experiment is\nreally a (possibly disguised) argument; it starts with premises\ngrounded in experience and follows deductive or inductive rules of\ninference in arriving at its conclusion. The picturesque features of\nany thought experiment which give it an experimental flavour might be\npsychologically helpful, but are strictly redundant. Thus, says\nNorton, we never go beyond the empirical premises in a way to which\nany empiricist would object.  \nThere are three objections that might be offered against Norton.\nFirst, his notion of argument is too vague. However, this might not be\nthe best objection: arguments can be deductive (which are perfectly\nclear) or inductive. If the latter are unclear, the fault is with\ninduction, not with Norton’s argument view. Second, it is argued that\nNorton simply begs the question: every real world experiment can be\nrephrased as an argument, but nobody would say that real world\nexperiences are dispensable. The account does not address the question:\nwhere do the premises come from? A thought experiment might be an\nessential step in making the Norton-style reconstruction. Third, a\nthought experiment that is presented in argument form loses its\ntypical force. The soft-point in Brown’s Platonism is linked to the\nstrength of Norton’s account because Norton claims that any other view\nimplies a commitment to “asking the oracle.”\n“Imagine an oracle that claims mysterious powers but never\ndelivers predictions that could not be learned by simple inferences\nfrom ordinary experience. We would not believe that the oracle had any\nmysterious powers. I propose the same verdict for thought experiments\nin science.” (Norton 1996, pp. 1142–1143) Defenders of\nempiricist alternatives deny this dispensability thesis. Brendel\n(2018) offers a most comprehensive review of merits and perils of the\nargument view.  \n(D) Conceptual Constructivism  \n“Conceptual constructivism”, as we could call it, is among\nthe empiricist alternatives to the argument view. The position has\nbeen taken up by Van Dyck (2003) to account especially for\nHeisenberg’s ɣ-ray microscope; but also by Gendler (1998) to\nmakes sense of Galileo’s falling body thought experiment. Gendler’s\nproposal was advanced in more general terms by Camilleri (2014) in\norder to establish a firm middle ground between the views of Norton\nand Brown. Conceptual constructivism was first proposed by Thomas Kuhn\n(1964). He employs many of the concepts (but not the terminology) of\nhis well-known Structure of Scientific Revolutions. On his\nview a well-conceived thought experiment can bring on a crisis or at\nleast create an anomaly in the reigning theory and so contribute to\nparadigm change. Thought experiments can teach us something new about\nthe world, even though we have no new empirical data, by helping us to\nre-conceptualize the world in a new way. Accordingly, Fehige (2013b)\nentertains the option of conceptual constructivism in form of a\nNeo-Kantian reading of Einstein’s famous clock in the box thought\nexperiment. This proposal is inspired by Michael Friedman’s proposal\nto conceive of scientific revolutions as times when a Kantian kind of\nnatural philosophy plays a major role in guiding scientists from one\nparadigm to another. The work of Kuhn left us with a puzzle: if\nscientific rationality is absolutely dependent on a paradigm, and if\nduring scientific revolutions one paradigm replaces another, not in\ndegrees but like a Gestalt switch, then this transition from one\nparadigm to the next cannot be a matter of scientific rationality. Are\nscientific revolutions irrational periods in the history of science?\nNot necessarily, some kind of natural philosophy may guide the\nprocess. Friedman has a Kantian natural philosophy in mind; his\nproposal did not earn wide acceptance, but the problem remains (see\nFisch 2017). \n(E) Experimentalism  \nWhat we might term “experimentalism” encompasses a wide\nrange of different approaches which all assume that thought\nexperiments are a “limiting case” of ordinary experiments.\nExperimentalism was proposed first by Ernst Mach (1897 and 1905). He\ndefines experimenting in terms of its basic method of variation and\nits capacity to destroy prejudices about nature. According to Mach,\nexperimenting is innate to higher animals, including humans. The\nthought experiment just happens on a higher intellectual level but is\nbasically still an experiment. At the centre of thought experimenting\nis a “Gedankenerfahrung”, an experience in thought. Such\nan experience is possible because thought experiments draw from\n“unwillkürliche Abbildungen von Tatsachen”\n(non-arbitrary images of facts) acquired in past experiences of\nthe world. Some thought experiments are so convincing in their results\nthat an execution seems unnecessary; others could be conducted in a\nreal-world experiment, which is the most natural trajectory of a\nscientific thought experiment. In any case thought experiments can\nresult in a revision of belief, thereby demonstrating their\nsignificance for scientific progress. Mach also appreciates the\ndidactic value of thought experiments: they help us to realize what\ncan be accomplished in thinking and what cannot. \nIn the spirit of Mach, Roy A. Sorensen has offered an aspiring version\nof experimentalism that accounts for thought experiments in science\nand philosophy, and tackles many of the central issues of the topic.\nSorensen claims thought experiments are “a subset of unexecuted\nexperiments” (1992, p. 213). By their logical nature they are\nparadoxes that aim to test modal consequences of propositions. The\norigin of our capacity of thought experimentation is explained in\nterms of Darwinian evolution (as in Genz 1999, pp. 25–29),\nthough the explanation has been criticized to be only little more than\na ‘just so story’ that fails, on a posteriori grounds, to\nepistemically underwrite that capacity (see Maffie 1997). Others are\nmore optimistic (see Shepard 2008).  \nExperimentalism does not have to take a naturalistic turn as it does\nin Sorensen’s case. In a number of contributions Marco Buzzoni has\ndefended a Neo-Kantian version of experimentalism (see Buzzoni 2004,\n2007, 2008, 2011, 2011b, 2013, 2013b). Buzzoni (2008) argues for the\ndialectical unity of thought experiments and real-world experiments.\nThought experiments and real-world experiments are claimed to be\nidentical on the “technological-operational” level, and at\nleast in science, one is impossible without the other: without thought\nexperiments there wouldn’t be real-world experiments because we would\nnot know how to put questions to nature; without real-world\nexperiments there wouldn’t be answers to these questions or experience\nfrom which they could draw. Given the many scientific thought\nexperiments that cannot be realized in the real-world, Buzzoni might\nbe conflating thought experiments with imagined experiments to be\ncarried out in the real-world (see Fehige 2012, 2013b; and Buzzoni\n2013b).  \n(F) The Mental–Model Account  \nThe last of the many accounts that emerged in the discussion about\nthought experiments is what could be called the\n“mental–model account”. It attracts the most\nfollowers (see Andreas 2011; Bishop 1998; Cooper 2005; Gendler\n2004; Palmieri 2003; Nersessian 1992, 1993, 2007; McMullin 1985;\nMiščević 1992 and 2007). When we conduct a thought\nexperiment, according to champions of this view, we manipulate a\nmental model instead of a physical model: “The general claim is\nthat in certain problem-solving tasks people reason by constructing a\nmental model of the situations, events, and processes that in dynamic\ncases can be manipulated through simulation.” (Nersessian 2018,\np. 319) Like physical models, mental models are non-propositional in\nnature. This means first of all “that the carefully crafted\nthought–experimental narrative focuses on the construction of a\nmodel of a kind of situation and manipulating that model\nthrough simulation affords epistemic access to certain features of\ncurrent representations in a way that manipulating propositional\nrepresentations using logical rules cannot.” (Nersessian 2018,\np. 319–320) A narrative functions as a kind of user-manual for\nbuilding the model, but it isn’t identical to a thought\nexperiment. \nThe mental–model approach is one of the most promising of all\nthe accounts the literature on thought experiments has to offer, and\nthis for several reasons. First, it does not seem to be much of a\nstretch to draw connections to the intuition–based account. In\nfact, intuitions maybe the missing link to connect the essentially\nnon-propositional activities surrounding mental models, on the one\nhand, and the propositional aspects of thought experiments, on the\nother. After all, thought experiments involve propositional reasoning,\nand somehow the non-propositional and propositional aspects of thought\nexperiments must be linked in any account of thought experiments. This\nis urgent insofar as thought experiments are credited with a\nmeaningful role in theory discovery and theory choice. Second, the\nmental–model approach also allows for inclusion of important\nelements of experimentalism and the argument–view. Thought\nexperiments are realized in the mind on mental models, and the method\nof variation is employed such that the results of the experiment may\nbe subject to a careful reconstruction of propositional lines of\nreasoning to submit it for careful assessment and critique. Fourth,\nthe mental–model approach enables us to bring an aspect into\nfocus that has been widely neglected in the discussion so far: the\nbodily component of (thought) experiments. The exception is the work\nof the late David Gooding (1992, 1993, 1994, and 1999). Fifth, in\ncritical engagement with such naturalistic proposals, those theories\nof the body may be put to work that the philosophical school of\nphenomenology has produced (see Fehige and Wiltsche 2013). To be\nwelcomed, therefore, is the entry of phenomenology into the discussion\non thought experiments (see Hopp 2014; Wiltsche 2018). Sixth, the\nmental–model account also relates naturally to the most\nintriguing discussions about the role of literary fiction in thought\nexperiments.  \nSome have placed “literary fiction on the level of thought\nexperiments.” (Swirski 2007, p. 6) There are two readings of\nsuch a claim. According to the first, some literary fiction may be of\ncognitive power due to the fact that they are thought experiments. In\nother words, we shouldn’t outright reject the idea that literature can\nbe of cognitive value. Dystopian novels such as Orwell’s 1984\nand Huxley’s Brave New World are obvious examples. According\nto the second reading, the power of thought experiments is partially a\nfunction of the narrative that conveys it. The work of Novalis remains\nrelevant for the exploration of this link between narrative\ndevelopment and thought experiment: experimental writing and\nexperiments on imagined scenarios go hand in hand; words and thoughts\ncoincide; mind and matter are entangled (see, e.g., Fehige 2013a)\nAccording to the mental–model approach, both readings have a\nvalid point. Literary fiction and narratives of thought experiments\ncan be powerful in establishing mental models in such a way that we\ncan even learn new things about the world at times from the fictional\nelements of them. The common denominator is the work on mental models\neach may facilitate. It is in this context that an appreciation can\ngrow for Catherine Elgin’s theory of exemplification to argue against\nthe “valorization of truth in epistemology” (2004, p.\n113). This is also the place to consider Andras Kertesz (2015) work on\nconceptual metaphor research in its relevance to the epistemological\npuzzle that thought experiments pose. \nFinally, eighth, mention could be made of visual reasoning in\nmathematics, which often seems closely related to thought experiments.\nThe standard view of mathematics is that the one and only source of\nevidence is a proof, and a proof is a derivation from axioms or first\nprinciples. Let’s overlook the problem of where the first principles\ncome from. A simple example such as the following casts doubt on the\nstandard view. \nTheorem: 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n = n2/2 + n/2 \nProof: See Figure 7. Figure 7. Picture proof. \nThe proof works like this: Start at the top and work down, letting the\nlittle squares represent numbers, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5. The\ntotal number of squares in the picture is equal to this sum. Notice\nalso that the numbers of squares is equal to a large square with sides\nof length 5 that is cut in half along the diagonal, i.e.,\n52/2, plus the shaded bits that were cut off by\nthe diagonal cut, i.e., 5/2. It is plausible to claim that\nthe diagram is a perfectly good proof of the theorem. One can\n“see” complete generality in the picture. Even though it only\nillustrates the theorem for n = 5, somehow we can see that it\nworks for every number, all infinitely many of them. The diagram does\nnot implicitly suggest a “rigorous” verbal or symbolic proof. The\nregular proof of this theorem is by mathematical induction, but the\ndiagram does not correspond to an inductive proof at all, since the\nkey element in an inductive proof is the passage from n to\nn + 1. The simple moral we could draw from the example is\njust this: We can in special cases correctly infer theorems from\npictures, that is, from visualizable situations. There is an intuition\nand from this intuition we can grasp the truth of the theorem. (See\nBrown 1999 [2008].)  \nThis assessment of the current situation is very rough and speculative,\nthough certainly not implausible. Of course, there are challenges to\nsuch a vision of a greater synthesis of the many different takes on\nthought experiments. For example, some see additional support arising\nfor the argument–view from computer simulations (see Beisbart\n2012). Others find that “computational modeling is largely\nreplacing thought experimenting, and the latter will play only a\nlimited role in future practice of science, especially in the sciences\nof complex nonlinear, dynamical phenomena” (see Chandrasekharan\net al. 2012, p. 239). But, there are also proposals such as\nthat by Marcus Schulzke (2014) to think of video games philosophically\nas executable thought experiments. Whatever the merits of this\nparticular proposal, future explorations of the relationship between\ncomputer simulations and thought experiments can build on outcomes of\ncloser inquiries into it (see Behmel 2001, pp. 98–108; Di Paolo\net al. 2000; El Skaf and Imbert 2013; Lenhard 2011;\nStäudner 1998; Lenhard 2018). The work on the nature of the\nimportance of scientific understanding (see, e.g., Stuart 2018) will\ninform that exploration as much as the fruits of continuing efforts to\nclarify the role of the imagination in thought experiments (see, e.g.,\nMeynell 2014; Stuart 2017 and forthcoming (b)). \nWe conclude with an interesting, but still relatively unexplored issue\nthat concerns the relative importance of thought experiments in\ndifferent disciplines. Physics and philosophy use them extensively.\nChemistry, by contrast, seems to have few or none at all. Why is this\nthe case? Perhaps it is merely an historical accident that chemists\nnever developed a culture of doing thought experiments. Perhaps it is\ntied to some deep feature of the discipline itself (see Snooks 2006).\nEconomics and history use thought experiments, but apparently not\nanthropology. A good explanation would likely tell us a lot about the\nstructure of these disciplines. \nRelated to this is the question of the difference, if any, between\nthought experiments in the sciences and those in philosophy.  We have\nassumed throughout this article that they are the same kind of thing.\nNot everyone sees them this way, so perhaps it should be considered an\nopen question.  On the one hand, philosophy and science seem to many\nto be different kinds of activities.  That might suggest that thought\nexperiments would differ in the two areas.  On the other hand, there\nis a huge difference between thought experiments within a single\nfield, e.g., Newton’s bucket attempts to establish absolute space\nwhile Schrodinger’s cat aims to show QM as then understood to be\nabsurd.  Is the difference between them less than the difference\nbetween either of them and Searle’s Chinese Room or Thomson’s\nviolinist?  The case one way or the other is not obvious.  Of course,\nthere are differences between constructive and destructive thought\nexperiments, but this is true within any discipline.  Perhaps for now\nthe default attitude ought to be that there is no principle difference\nbetween scientific and philosophical thought experiments.  This should\nnot be treated as a dogmatic principle, but rather a stimulus to look\ndeeper for important subtle contrasts.","contact.mail":"jrbrown@chass.utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"chass.utoronto.ca"},{"date.published":"1996-12-28","date.changed":"2019-09-26","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thought-experiment/","author1":"James Robert Brown","author1.info":"http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~jrbrown/","author2.info":"https://hps.utoronto.ca/staff/yiftach-fehige/","entry":"thought-experiment","body.text":"\n\n\nThought experiments are basically devices of the imagination. They are\nemployed for various purposes such an entertainment, education,\nconceptual analysis, exploration, hypothesizing, theory selection,\ntheory implementation, etc. Some applications are more controversial\nthan others. Few would object to thought experiments that serve to\nillustrate complex states of affairs, or those that are used in\neducational contexts. The situation is different, however, with\nrespect to the appropriation of imagined scenarios to investigate\nreality (very broadly conceived to include things like electrons,\ntables, rain, beliefs, morals, people, numbers, universes, and even\ndivine beings). It is this use of thought experiments that attracts\nmost of the attention inside and outside of philosophical discourse.\nSignificant is the overlap here with many other central philosophical\ntopics, such as the nature of the imagination, the importance of\nunderstanding in contrast to explanation, the role of intuition in\nhuman cognition, and the relationship between fiction and truth.\nMoreover, thought experiments are interdisciplinary in two important\nrespects. Firstly, not only philosophers treat them as a topic, but\nalso historians, cognitive scientists, psychologists, etc. Secondly,\nthey can be found in many disciplines, including biology, economics,\nhistory, mathematics, philosophy, and physics (although,\ninterestingly, not with the same frequency in each).\n\n\nMost often thought experiments are communicated in narrative form,\nfrequently with diagrams. It is important to distinguish between the\nimagined scenarios that are featured in thought experiments, on the\none hand, and the narratives that establish the scenarios in\npeople’s mind, on the other. Once a scenario is imagined it may\nassume a life on its own, and this explains partly the creative power\nof a good thought experiment. Experimental results may obtain that\nactually run counter to the narrative that initiated the discussion of\nan imagined scenario. Besides, thought experiments should be\ndistinguished from thinking about experiments, from merely imagining\nany experiments to be conducted outside the imagination, and from\npsychological experiments with thoughts, though there may be some\noverlap. They should also be distinguished from counterfactual\nreasoning in general, as they seem to require an experimental element\n(i.e., visualized, touched, heard, etc.), which explains the\nimpression that something is experienced in a thought experiment\n(Brown 1991 [2011]). In other words, though many call any\ncounterfactual or hypothetical situation a thought experiment (see,\ne.g., Rescher 1991), this appears too encompassing. It is a quite\ndifferent matter as to whether there is a logical structure common to\nall of thought experiments. Based on considerations of logical\nstructure, a taxonomy has been proposed according to which all thought\nexperiments fall into two classes: “Necessity Refuters”\nand “Possibility Refuters” (see Sorensen 1990,\n132–160). Such proposals especially fuel the debate about\nidentity conditions of thought experiments. What modifications to\nlogical structure does a thought experiment tolerate before it ceases\nto exist and a new one is born? In other words, how much emphasis on\npropositional characteristics in appropriate is the analysis of\nthought experiments?\n\n\nLooking at the development of the discussion about thought experiments\nover the past thirty years, it is fair to say that thought experiments\nwere primarily an important topic in the philosophy of science and the\nphilosophy of philosophy (“metaphilosophy”), before the\nscope widened up at a later point. There is a simple reason for that\npath. At the core of the discussion sits a relatively simple\nepistemological challenge that is presented in a particularly powerful\nmanner by numerous thought experiments that the history of science has\nto offer. They suggest that we can learn about the real world by\nvirtue of merely thinking about imagined scenarios. But how can we\nlearn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking in such a\nway? Are there really thought experiments that enable us to acquire\nnew knowledge about nature without new empirical data? If so, where\ndoes the new information come from if not from contact with the realm\nof investigation under consideration in an imagined scenario? Finally,\nhow can we distinguish good from bad instances of thought experiments?\nThese questions seem urgent with respect to scientific thought\nexperiments, because many “recognize them as an occasionally\npotent tool for increasing our understanding of nature.…\nHistorically their role is very close to the double one played by\nactual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thought\nexperiments can disclose nature’s failure to conform to a previously\nheld set of expectations. Second, they can suggest particular ways in\nwhich both expectation and theory must henceforth be revised.”\n(Kuhn 1977, p. 241 and 261) The questions surrounding the\nepistemological challenge that certain scientific thought experiments\npose are also urgent regarding thought experiments outside of the\nsciences. This is especially true with respect to philosophy itself.\nPhilosophy offers numerous examples of thought experiments that play a\nrole similar in importance to some scientific thought experiments. And\nthis fact provokes in turn further inquiries into the relationship\nbetween the sciences and philosophy, especially with respect to\nphenomena that implicate both the sciences and philosophy, such as the\nmind (see Wilkes 1988; Young 2013).\n\n If scientific practice has room for thought experiments, then the\nquestion arises as to why we would want philosophical methodology to\nbe more discriminatory in this respect. One reason that is often\noffered is that results of scientific thought experiments may be\nsubjected to further empirical testing. This can’t be done for\nphilosophical thought experiments. It seems difficult to accept such a\ncategorical separation of science and philosophy. The 17th century saw\nsome of the most brilliant practitioners of thought experimentation in\nGalileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz, all of whom pursued the\nproject of “natural philosophy.” And in our own time, the\ncreation of quantum mechanics and relativity are almost unthinkable\nwithout the crucial role played by thought experiments, most of which\nrelate to important philosophical issues that arise from these\nscientific theories. Besides, much of ethics, philosophy of language,\nand philosophy of mind is based on the results of thought experiments\nin a way that seems very similar to scientific thought experiments\n(though some might contest this), including Searle’s Chinese room,\nPutnam’s twin earth, and Jackson’s Mary the colour\nscientist. Philosophy, even more than the sciences, would be severely\nimpoverished without thought experiments. These observations partly\nexplain why it has been argued that a more “unified” account of\nthought experiments is desirable (see Boniolo 1997; Cooper 2005,\npp. 329–330; Gähde 2000). Of course, it is important not to\ndownplay the significant differences between the sciences and\nphilosophy. But an account of thought experiments seems more powerful\nif it can do justice to the fact that not only in the sciences we find\nmany of them.\n\n\nThere have been several attempts to define “thought\nexperiment” along the lines of traditional conceptual analysis\n(see, e.g., Picha 2011; McComb 2013), but likely it will be better to\nleave the term loosely characterized, so as not to prejudice the\nongoing investigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to what\nthought experiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (see\nHäggqvist 2009), but this does not mean that we need to begin\nwith a technical definition, specifying necessary and sufficient\nconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal with\nremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,\nreligion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to refer\nto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well as\nthose already mentioned, there are Newton’s bucket, Heisenberg’s\ngamma-ray microscope, Einstein’s elevator, Leibniz’s mill, Parfit’s\npeople who split like amoebas, and Thomson’s violinist. Everyone is\nprobably familiar with some of these. Less familiar thought\nexperiments include the mouse that breaks into the tabernacle of a\nmedieval Roman Catholic Church building to feed on the consecrated\nwafers in there (see Fehige 2011). Roman Catholic Christians believe\nthat a consecrated wafer is the body of Christ. The “substance” of the\nwafer, understood in terms of Aristotelian categories, is believed to\nbe replaced. In its place is the “substance” of Christ’s body after\nconsecration by a priest. Only the Aristotelian “accidents” of the\nwafer remain intact (smell, colour, texture, etc.). Does the mouse eat\nthe body of Christ (if any human actually does)? Another example is\n“the dome”which is to prove indeterminism in Newtonian\nphysics. Imagine a mass sitting on a radially symmetric surface in a\ngravitational field. Guided by Newton’s laws of motion one comes to\nrealize that the mass can either remain at rest for all times, or\nspontaneously move in an arbitrary direction (see Norton 2008). This\nthought experiment triggers a number of very interesting questions\nconcerning the nature of Newtonian theory, the meaning of\n“physical”, and the role of idealizations in physics. And,\nof course, does it show what it claims? (see Malament 2008).\n\n\nIn the following we will first provide a characterization of thought\nexperiments in light of examples. A proposal follows for classifying\nthought experiments, before reviewing the state of the debate on\nthought experiments as such, preceded by some remarks about the\nhistory of philosophical inquiry into the nature of thought\nexperiments. We conclude by highlighting some trends in discussions\nsurrounding the so-called laboratory of the mind.\n\nTheorizing about thought experiments usually turns on the details or\nthe patterns of specific cases. Familiarity with a wide range of\nexamples is crucial for commentators, and the list is very long (see,\ne.g., Stuart et al. 2018, pp. 558–560) We will provide a few\nhere. One of the most beautiful early instances (in Lucretius, De\nRerum Natura 1.951–987; see Bailey 1950, pp. 58–59)\nattempts to show that space is infinite: if there is a purported\nboundary to the universe, we can toss a spear at it. If the spear\nflies through, it isn’t a boundary after all; if the spear bounces\nback, then there must be something beyond the supposed edge of space,\na cosmic wall that stopped the spear, a wall that is itself in space.\nEither way, there is no edge of the universe; thus, space is infinite.\nThis example nicely illustrates many of the most common features of\nwhat it means to engage in the conduct of thought experiments: we\nvisualize some situation that we have set up in the imagination; we\nlet it run or we carry out an operation; we see what happens; finally,\nwe draw a conclusion. The example also illustrates the fallibility of\nthought experiments. Since the time of Lucretius, we’ve learned how to\nconceptualize space so that it could be both finite and unbounded.\nImagine a circle, which is a one dimensional space. As we move around,\nthere is no edge, but it is nevertheless finite. The universe might be\na three-dimensional version of this topology. It is, therefore, true\nthat we must try to be mindful of unexpected limitations due to\n“physical scale effects,” (see Klee 2008) or other such things when\nimagining counterfactual scenarios. Figure 1. “Welcome to the edge of the\nUniverse” \nOften a real experiment that is the analogue of a thought experiment\nis impossible for physical, technological, ethical, or financial\nreasons (see, e.g., Sorensen 1992, pp. 200–202); but this\nneedn’t be a defining condition of thought experiments. The main point\nis that we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking, and\ntherein lies the great interest for philosophy. How is it possible\nto learn apparently new things about nature without new empirical\ndata? One possible answer is to claim that we possess a great\nstore of “instinctive knowledge” picked up from\nexperience. This is the solution that Ernst Mach offered (see Mach,\n1897 and 1905; for most instructive assessments of his views see\nKühne 2006, pp. 165–202, and Sorensen 1992, pp.\n51–75). We will get back to his solution further down. It\nremains one of the major accounts of how thought experiments work. One\nof Mach’s favourite examples is due to Simon Stevin (see Mach, 1883,\npp. 48–58). When a chain is draped over a double frictionless\nplane, as in Fig. 2a, how will it move? Add some links as in Fig. 2b.\nNow it is obvious. The initial setup must have been in static\nequilibrium. Otherwise, we would have a perpetual motion machine; and\naccording to our experience-based “instinctive knowledge,”\nsays Mach, this is impossible. We do not have to perform the\nexperiment in the real world, which we could not do, anyway, since it\nwould require a perfectly frictionless plane. Nevertheless the outcome\nseems compelling. (a) (b) Figure 2. “How will it move?” \nJudith Thomson provided one of the most striking and effective thought\nexperiments in the moral realm (see Thomson 1971). Her example is\naimed at a popular anti-abortion argument that goes something like\nthis: the fetus is an innocent person. All innocent persons have a\nright to life. Abortion results in the death of a fetus. Therefore,\nabortion is morally wrong. In her thought experiment we are asked to\nimagine a famous violinist falling into a coma. The society of music\nlovers determines from medical records that you and you alone can save\nthe violinist’s life by being hooked up to him for nine months. The\nmusic lovers break into your home while you are asleep and hook the\nunconscious (and unknowing, hence innocent) violinist to you. You may\nwant to unhook him, but you are then faced with this argument put\nforward by the music lovers: the violinist is an innocent person. All\ninnocent persons have a right to life. Unhooking him will result in\nhis death. Therefore, unhooking him is morally wrong. However, the\nargument, even though it has the same structure as the anti-abortion\nargument, does not seem convincing in this case. You would be very\ngenerous to remain attached for nine months, but you are not morally\nobligated to do so. The parallel with the abortion case is evident.\nThomson’s thought experiment is effective in distinguishing two\nconcepts that had previously been run together: “right to\nlife” and “right to what is needed to sustain life.”\nThe fetus and the violinist might each have the former, but it is not\nevident that either has the latter. The upshot is that even if the\nfetus has a right to life (which Thomson does not believe but allows\nfor the sake of the argument), it may still be morally permissible to\nabort. Those opposed to Thomson’s view have two options. They can\neither dismiss her thought experiment as a useless fiction. In fact,\nthought experiments as a method in ethics have their critics (see,\ne.g., Dancy 1985). Alternatively, they can provide a different\nversion of the same scenario to challenge the conclusion. It is a very\nintriguing feature of thought experiments that they can be\n“rethought” (see Bokulich 2001). Real experiments are\nfrequently open to reinterpretation, too. In this respect there does\nnot seem to be a principled difference.  \nLike arguments, thought experiments can be criticized in different\nways. Perhaps the set up is faulty; perhaps the conclusions drawn from\nthe thought experiment are not justified. Similar criticisms can arise\nin real experiments. Counter thought experiments are perhaps another\nform of criticism. They do not target the premises or conclusions\ninvolved in a particular thought experiment but question the\nphenomenon, i.e. the non-propositional heart of an imagined scenario\n(see Brown 2007). For example, Daniel Dennett is convinced that\nFrank Jackson’s Mary thought experiment is poor evidence to oppose\nphysicalism in philosophy of mind. In Jackson’s version, Mary, who\nknows everything physics and the neurosciences can possibly know about\ncolours but grew up in a colourless environment (seeing only black,\nwhite and grey things), allegedly learns something new when she sees a\nred tomato for the first time. Now she knows what it is like to\nexperience red. This is an argument for qualia as something over and\nabove the physical. Instead of a red tomato, Dennett, in his version\nof the thought experiment, presents Mary with a bright blue banana. In\nhis version of the story (which seems just as plausible as Jackson’s),\nMary balks and says she is being tricked, since she knows that bananas\nare yellow, and this, says Mary, is a consequence of knowing\neverything physical about colour perception. Mary does not learn\nanything new when she sees coloured objects for the first time, so\nthere is no case against physicalism after all. Jackson’s initial\nthought experiment was very persuasive, but Dennett’s was equally so,\nthus, undermining Jackson’s argument. \nClearly, thought experiments are characterized by an intriguing\nplasticity, and this raises the interesting question of what it is\nthat preserves the identity of a thought experiment. Replacing a red\ntomato with a blue banana might still leave us with the same thought\nexperiment––slightly revised. But, at what point do we get\na new thought experiment? This is not merely a question about\nconceptual vagueness. It helps to facilitate a discussion of the\nintuitively most plausible view about the cognitive efficacy of\nthought experiments, according to which this power depends on their\nbeing arguments, in a fairly strict sense of argument. John D. Norton\nholds such a view, which will be discussed below. In light of cases\nwhere the discussion of one and the same thought experiment played an\nimportant role in settling a dispute, the following problem arises:\nhow can one and the same thought experiment support opposing views\nabout a particular matter if the arguments that correspond to the\ndifferent versions of the thought experiment that were entertained by\nthe disputing parties are significantly different? The dilemma is: we\ncould say that if there is more than one argument then there is more\nthan one thought experiment involved in the dispute. But, if that is\ntrue then the disputing parties simply talked pass each other. One\nparty presented an argument that the other party ignored while\npresenting their own. Alternatively, we can say that one thought\nexperiment can correspond to many different arguments. But, if that is\ntrue then it becomes unclear in what non-trivial sense thought\nexperiments are supposed to be identical with arguments (see Bishop\n1999, and the response by Norton 2004, 63–64). \nThe plasticity of thought experiments coheres with another feature of\nthought experiments, namely that they seem to have “evidential\nsignificance only historically and locally, i.e., when and where\npremises that attribute evidential significance to it […] are\nendorsed.” (McAllister 1996, p. 248) \nMany taxonomies can be found in the literature. They are not mutually\nexclusive. We will present three of them. The first follows the type\nof purpose thought experiments serve. A very rudimentary version of it\ncan be found in (Mach, 1897 and 1905). Such a classification makes\nsense, because an “imaginary experiment should be judged on its\nspecific purpose.” (Krimsky 1973, p. 331) Thought experiments\nare conducted for diverse reasons (see, e.g., DeMay 2006; Sorensen\n1992, pp. 7–15), and this in a variety of areas, including the\neconomical (see, e.g., Herfeld 2019; Thoma 2016), educational (Helm\nand Gilbert 1985; Helm et al. 1985, Klassen 2006; Sriraman 2006;\nStonier 1990), historical (see, e.g., Maar 2014; Reiss 2009), literary\n(see, e.g., Davies 2007; Elgin 2004), mathematical (see, e.g. Brown\n1991 [2011], pp. 90–97; Glas 1999), moral (see, e.g., Hauerwas\n1996; Wilson 2016), natural (see Krimsky 1973), socio-political realm\n(see, e.g. Roberts 1993: Thaler 2016), and theological (see, e.g.,\nGregersen 2014; Fehige 2018). Thought experiments may be used to\nentertain. This is probably true of short stories or novels which some\nargue qualify as thought experiments if certain conditions apply (see,\ne.g., Davenport 1983). Some thought experiments fulfil a specific\nfunction within a theory (see Borsboom et al. 2002). Others are\nexecuted because it is impossible to run the experimental scenario in\nthe real world (see, e.g., Sorensen 1992,\npp. 200–202). Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate\nand clarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the\nprocess of understanding (see Behmel 2001). Again others serve as\nexamples in conceptual analysis (see Cohnitz 2006). And, then there\nare those that matter in the process of theory discovery (Praem and\nSteglich–Peterson 2015).  The thought experiments that have\nreceived most of the attention are taken to provide evidence for or\nagainst a theory, putting them on a par with real-world experiments\n(see, e.g., Gendler 2004). The different ways to use thought\nexperiments, of course, do not exclude one another. Most obviously,\nfor example, a thought experiment can both entertain and make a case\nagainst a theory. \nA second taxonomy classifies thought experiments in terms of logical\nstructure (see Sorensen 1992, pp. 132–166). The idea is to\ndivide all thought experiments into two types of “alethic\nrefuters”: “Although there are a number of ways to\nclassify thought experiments, a refutation format scores the most\npoints when judged by familiarity, specificity, and simplicity.\nAccording to this scheme, thought experiments aim at overturning\nstatements by disproving one of their modal consequences. Modalities\nare operators that are applied to propositions to yield new\npropositions. There are deontic modalities (permissible,\nforbidden), epistemic modalities (know, believe), and\nalethic modalities (possible, necessary). The alethic\nmodalities are the best–known and more–basic modality.\nHence, we won’t miss anything by concentrating on them.”\n(Sorensen 1992, p. 135) One type of thought experiment “is\ndesigned to refute a statement by showing that something ruled out as\nimpossible by that statement is really possible after all.”\n(Sorensen 1992, p. 135) The most discussed examples in the\nmetaphilosophical discussion on thought experiments is of such a type,\nnamely the Gettier scenarios (see Grundmann & Horvarth 2014;\nSaint-Germier 2019). They are designed to refute the claim that all\nknowledge is justified, true belief. They serve as a “necessity\nrefuter.” The other type collects examples of “possibility\nrefuters”. They don’t affirm “the possibility of the\nthought experiment’s content”. Instead, they establish\n“copossibilities”. A wonderful example is the scenario of\nan omnipotent God who faces the task of creating a stone too heavy for\nher to lift. It seems God cannot succeed. The notion of divine\nomnipotence causes some headaches here. \nA third taxonomy (see Brown 1986, pp. 4–11), which has not gone\nunchallenged (see Norton 1993b), is more limited than the fist two\ninsofar as it focuses largely on the class of those thought\nexperiments that are taken to function in theory choice, which is the\nuse of thought experiments that has been receiving most of the\nattention. According to this taxonomy, the main division is\nconstructive vs. destructive and resembles Karl Popper’s\ndistinction between apologetic and critical thought\nexperiments. Popper actually distinguishes between three types of\nthought experiments: heuristic (to illustrate a theory),\ncritical (against a theory) and apologetic (in\nfavour of a theory) (see Popper 1959). His case in favour of a\ncritical and against an apologetic use of thought experiments is very\nlimited. He focuses exclusively on quantum physics and doesn’t really\nsay much to address the primary epistemological challenge presented by\nthe success of critical thought experiments. \nAmong destructive thought experiments, the following\nsubtypes can be identified: the simplest of these is to draw out a\ncontradiction in a theory, thereby refuting it. The first part of\nGalileo’s famous falling bodies example does this. It shows that in\nAristotle’s account, a composite body (cannon ball and musket ball\nattached) would have to fall both faster and slower than the cannon\nball alone. A second subtype is constituted by those thought\nexperiments that aim to show that the theory in question is in\nconflict with other beliefs that we hold. Schrödinger’s\nwell-known cat paradox, for instance, does not show that quantum\ntheory (at least on some interpretations) is internally inconsistent\n(see Schrödinger 1935, p. 812; translation: Trimmer 1980, p.\n328): “A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the\nfollowing diabolical device (which must be secured against direct\ninterference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of\nradioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of one\nhour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability,\nperhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a\nrelay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic\nacid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one\nwould say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed.\nThe first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The q-function of the\nentire system would express this by having in it the living and the\ndead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal\nparts.” This thought experiment shows that quantum theory (as\ninterpreted by Bohr) is in conflict with some very powerful common\nsense beliefs we have about macro-sized objects such as\ncats––they cannot be both dead and alive in any sense\nwhatsoever. The bizarreness of superpositions in the atomic world is\nworrisome enough, says Schrödinger, but when it implies that same\nbizarreness at an everyday level, it is intolerable. There is a third\nsubtype of negative thought experiments, namely when, in effect, a\ncentral assumption or premise of the thought experiment itself is\nundermined. For example, as we have seen above, Thomson showed with\nher thought experiment that “right to life” and\n“right to what is needed to sustain life” had been run\ntogether. When distinguished, the argument against abortion is\nnegatively affected. \nA fourth sub-type of negative thought experiments are “counter\nthought experiments” (see Brown 2007). Norton very usefully\nintroduces a related idea:\n“thought-experiment/anti-thought-experiment pairs” (see\nNorton 2004, pp. 45–49). Above, we have already encountered\nthis subtype in our discussion of Lucretius’ spear-thought experiment,\nand with Dennett’s reply to Jackson’s much discussed Mary the colour\nscientist thought experiment. Here we would like to add one more\nexample, namely Mach’s counter thought experiment against absolute\nspace. In his Principia Mathematica, Newton offers a pair of\nthought experiments as evidence for absolute space. One is the bucket\nwith water climbing the wall, the other is a pair of spheres joined by\na cord that maintained its tension in otherwise empty space. The\nexplanation for these phenomena, argues Newton, is absolute space: the\nbucket and the joined spheres are rotating with respect to space\nitself. In response, Mach modifies the scenario and argues, contra\nNewton, that the two spheres would move toward one another thanks to\nthe tension in the cord, and if we rotated a very thick, massive ring\naround a stationary bucket, we would see the water climb the bucket\nwall. (For further discussion of Mach’s counter thought experiment to\nNewton’s see Kühne 2006, pp. 191–202). In short, the point\nof Mach’s counter thought experiments is to describe the phenomena of\nthe thought experiments’ scenarios differently, that is, to declare\nthat different things would happen. Mach’s counter thought experiment\nundermines our confidence in Newton’s. Absolute space might be a\nplausible explanation of the phenomena in Newton’s thought\nexperiments, but now, in light of Mach’s counter thought experiment,\nwe’re not so sure of the phenomena itself and thus of the idea of\nabsolute space. Figure 3. Stages in the bucket experiment Figure 4. Two spheres held by a cord in otherwise empty space \nTo be effective, counter thought experiments needn’t be very plausible\nat all. In a court of law a jury would convict provided guilt is\nestablished “beyond a reasonable doubt.” A common defence\nstrategy is to provide an alternative account of the evidence that has\njust enough plausibility to put the prosecution’s case into some\nmeasure of doubt. That is sufficient to undermine it. A counter\nthought experiment need only do that much to be effective, and in this\nsense it operates like a “necessity refuter” in Sorensen’s\nsense.  \nIn addition to destructive ones, there is a second type, the\nconstructive thought experiments. Unsurprisingly, there are\nmany ways they could provide positive support for a theory. One of\nthese is to provide a kind of illustration that makes a theory’s\nclaims clear and evident. In such cases thought experiments serve as a\nkind of heuristic aid. A result may already be well established, but\nthe thought experiment can lead to a very satisfying sense of\nunderstanding. In his Principia Mathematica, Newton provides\na wonderful example showing how the moon is kept in its orbit in just\nthe same way as an object falls to the earth (see Ducheyne 2006, pp.\n435–437). He illustrates this by means of a cannon shooting a\ncannon ball further and further. In the limit, the earth curves away\nas fast as the ball falls, with the eventual result being that the\ncannon ball will return to the spot where it was fired, and, if not\nimpeded, will go around again and again. This is what the moon is\ndoing. We could arrive at the same conclusion through calculation. But\nNewton’s thought experiment provides that elusive sense of\nunderstanding. It’s a wonderful example of the “aha\neffect” that is so typical of the many powerful thought\nexperiments. Figure 5. “The shot heard around the world” \nThomson’s violinist showed that abortion could be morally permissible\neven when the fetus has a right to life. Similarly, Einstein’s\nelevator showed that light will bend in a gravitational field, because\naccording to the principle of equivalence, there is no difference\nbetween such a frame of reference and one that is accelerating in free\nspace; the laws of physics are the same in all. Suppose then, an\nobserver is inside an elevator sealed off from the outside so that the\nobserver cannot tell whether he is in a gravitational field or\naccelerating. If it were accelerating, and if a light beam were to\nenter one side, then, due to the elevator’s motion, the beam would\nappear to drop or curve down as it crossed the elevator. Consequently,\nit would have to do the same thing if the elevator was in a\ngravitational field. Therefore, gravity ‘bends’ light.\n \nMaxwell’s demon showed that entropy could be decreased: The second law\nof thermodynamics implies that heat won’t pass from a cold body to a\nhot one. In classical thermodynamics this law is quite strict; but in\nMaxwell’s kinetic theory of heat there is a probability, though\nextremely small, of such an event happening. Some thought this a\nreductio ad absurdum of Maxwell’s theory. To show how it is possible\nto violate the second law, Maxwell imagined a tiny creature who\ncontrols a door between two chambers. Fast molecules from the cold box\nare let into the hot box, and slow molecules from the hot are allowed\ninto the cold. Thus, there will be an increase in the average speed in\nthe hot box and a decrease in the average speed of molecules in the\ncold. Since, on Maxwell’s theory, heat is just the average speed of\nthe molecules, there has been a flow of heat from a cold body to a hot\none.  \nParfit’s splitting persons shows that survival is a more important\nnotion than identity when considering personhood (for a critical\ndiscussion see Gendler 2002a). We say they “show” such\nand such, but, “purport to show” might be better, since\nsome of these thought experiments are quite contentious. What they\nhave in common is that they aim to establish something positive.\nUnlike destructive thought experiments, they are not trying to\ndemolish an existing theory, though they may do that in passing. In\nprinciple, given the fact that thought experiments can be rethought\n(see Bokulich 2001), and that the evidential significance is\ndependent on historical and local accomplishments (see McAllister\n1996), it cannot be irrelevant to identify the intention of the\nthought experimenter, if one wants to determine the type of a thought\nexperiment: “An imaginary experiment should be judged on its\nspecific purpose.” (Krimsky 1973, p. 331) \nThe practice of thought experiments is not an invention of modern\nscience, although there can be no doubt that the notion of a thought\nexperiment didn’t come into existence before the 18th century.\nAccordingly, the view is problematic that the Pre-Socratics\n“invented thought experimentation as a cognitive procedure and\npracticed it with great dedication and versatility.” (Rescher\n2005, p. 2) With such a claim one risks underestimating the\nentanglement of concepts and corresponding reality. It is probably\nmuch more correct to say something like the following: “There is\nno ancient Greek term corresponding to what we nowadays refer to as a\nthought experiment, and presumably ancient philosophers did not have\nour modern notion of a thought experiment. But there is no doubt that\nthey did use thought experiments. In fact, they often employed them in\nways similar to those of contemporary philosophers, that is, both for\ndefending their own theories as well as for refuting the theories of\ntheir opponents.”(Ierodiakonou 2018, p. 31; see also Becker\n2018; Diamond 2002, pp. 229–232; Fuhrer 2009; Glas 1999;\nIerodiakonou 2005; Ierodiakonou and Roux (eds.) 2011; Irvine 1991;\nRescher 1991 and 2005, pp. 61–72). The situation is similar\nwith respect to medieval natural philosophy, although there are\nfurther nuances to be considered (see King 1991). According to Edward\nGrant, during the late Middle Ages “the imagination became a\nformidable instrument in natural philosophy and theology in ways that\nwould have astonished ancient Greek natural philosophers, especially\nAristotle.” (Grant 2007, p. 201) But this doesn’t mean that we\nhave reason to think of Aristotle as an opponent of the conduct of\nthought experiments. On the contrary, “Aristotle uses thought\nexperiments for argumentative persuasion and in places where, due to\nthe obscure nature of the subject matter or the counterintuitive\nnature of the thesis they are meant to support, insight cannot be\nreadily communicated by appeal to observational facts.”\n(Corcilius 2018, p. 73) With a few exceptions that involved problems\nof motion, “the scholastics” made no meaningful effort to\ntransform their hypothetical conclusions into specific knowledge about\nthe physical world. They did, however, assume that although these\nhypothetical conclusions were naturally impossible, God could produce\nthem supernaturally if he wished. Special attention received also a\nclass of medieval thought experiments that does not rely on\ncounterfactuals but also depends on theological assumptions to study\nmatters non-theological, namely those thought experiments involving\nangels, whose existence were affirmed at that time (see Perler 2008).\nAngels are gone by now (see Clark 1992), but not thought experiments.\nWhile most thought experiments involving angels have Christianity as\ntheir context, there is evidence of the practice of thought\nexperiments also in the context of Islam and Judaism (see McGinnis\n2018; Fisch 2019). In fact, the case has been made “that Ibn\nSina is the first philosopher in the Aristotelian tradition, and thus\nperhaps the first in Western philosophy overall, to try to identify\nthe psychological processes that go into postulating a hypothetical\nscenario. Ibn Sina also exhibits an interest in accounting for why,\nand to what extent, such psychological acts are thought to carry\nweight in our study of nature.” (Kukkonen 2014, p. 434) \nErnst Mach is commonly credited with introducing the word\n“thought experiment” (Gadankenexperiment) and\nthereby coining a term for philosophical discussion (most recently\nKrauthausen 2015, p. 15). “ This view is incorrect, however!\n[…] it can be substantiated that it was used […] already\nin 1811.” (Witt-Hansen 1976, p. 48; see also Buzzoni 2008, pp.\n14–15; 61–65; Cohnitz 2008; Kühne 2005, pp.\n92–224; Moue et al. 2006, p. 63). The conceptual history of\n“thought experiment” goes back at least to the Danish\n“Tankeexperiment,” as it was used by Hans-Christian\nØrsted. We can go back even further and find in the work of the\nGerman philosopher-scientist Georg Lichtenberg (1742–1799) a\ntacit theory of “experiments with thoughts and ideas.”\nThese experiments help to overcome habits of thought that can inhibit\nscientific progress, and make possible an enlightened philosophy (see\nSchildknecht 1990, pp. 21; 123–169; Schöne 1982).\nLichtenberg’s “aphoristic experiments” (see Stern 1963,\npp. 112–126) reflect “that Lichtenberg’s scientific\npreoccupations are the formal and thematic prolegomena to his work as\na literary artist.” (Stern 1963, p. 126) Lichtenberg’s\nreflections on thought experimentation resemble those of Popper and\nThomas S. Kuhn, and it is plausible to think of him as one important\nfigure of the very first period in the history of philosophical\ninquiry into thought experiments (see Fehige and Stuart 2014).  Accordingly, the modern history of the philosophical investigation\ninto thought experiments can be divided into four stages: in the 18th\nand 19th century the awareness of the importance of thought\nexperiments in philosophy and science emerges. In addition to\nLichtenberg, special mention should be made of Novalis (see Daiber\n2001; Fehige 2013a), and Hans-Christian Ørsted. The topic\nreemerges in a more systematic manner at the beginning of the 20th\ncentury with little relation to the attempts made at the first stage.\nThe stakeholders of the second stage were Pierre Duhem, Mach, and\nAlexius Meinong (see Duhem 1913, pp. 304–311; Mach, 1883, pp.\n48–58, 1897 and 1905; Meinong 1907). A third stage, probably due\nto the rediscovery of the importance of scientific practice for a\nproper understanding of science, followed in the first part of the\nsecond half of the 20th century. Again, the contributions of this\nstage bear little relation to the two previous stages. While the third\nperiod has seen a number of noteworthy contributions (Cole 1983; Dancy\n1985; Dennett 1985; Fodor 1964; Helm; Gilbert 1985; Helm et al. 1985;\nKrimsky 1973; McMullin 1985; Myers 1986; Poser 1984; Prudovsky 1989;\nRehder 1980a,b; Yourgrau 1962 and 1967), the protagonists of this\nperiod were Alexandre Koyré, Kuhn and Popper. The ongoing\nphilosophical exploration of thought experiments began in the 1980s,\nand marks the fourth stage. Arguably, it has been the most prolific\none of all four stages. With some very important sign-postings in\nplace (Horowitz and Massey (eds.) 1991; Sorensen 1992a, b, c; Wilkes\n1988) the ongoing discussion took off in light of a debate between\nJames Robert Brown and John D. Norton (see for a concise statement of\neach position Brown 2004; Norton 2004), which many have found useful\nto establish a contrast with their own alternative accounts of thought\nexperiments. These views “represent the extremes of platonic\nrationalism and classic empiricism, respectively.” (Moue et\nal. 2006, p. 69) They will be described below. \nWe want to emphasize at this point that not all of the numerous\ncontributions to the discussion about thought experiments target\nprimarily the epistemological challenge to which advocates of the\naccounts respond that this section is going to feature in some detail.\nBut, of course, the challenge sits at the centre of the discussion,\nand this explains to a great deal what every contributor remarks about\nit. Our aim in this section is to demonstrate the variety of accounts\nthat have been proposed to makes sense of the cognitive power many\nthought experiments are credited with. We cannot discuss here all the\nauthors who are representative for each type of view which we will\nidentify, including: (A) the “skeptical objection”, (B)\nthe “intuition–based account”, (C) the\n“argument view”, (D) “conceptual\nconstructivism”, (E) “experimentalism”, and (F) the\n“mental–model account”. \n(A) The Sceptical Objection  \nOf course, particular thought experiments have been contested. But for\nthe most part, the practice of thought experiments in the sciences has\nbeen cheerfully accepted. Pierre Duhem, the great historian of\nphysics, is almost alone in what has been understood as an outright\ncondemnation of scientific thought experiments (see Duhem 1913, pp.\n304–311). A thought experiment is no substitute for a real\nexperiment, he claimed, and should be forbidden in science, including\nscience education. However, in view of the important role of actual\nthought experiments in the history of physics — from Galileo’s\nfalling bodies, to Newton’s bucket, to Einstein’s elevator — it\nis unlikely that anyone will feel or should feel much sympathy for\nDuhem’s strictures. We hasten to add that Buzzoni (2018) questions the\nvalidity of this reading of Duhem, and argues that already Mach’s\nreception of Duhem’s views suggests a more nuanced reading of Duhem’s\nposition. \nPhilosophers can be as critical as Duhem when it comes to thought\nexperimenting in their own field (see Cohnitz 2006b; Peijnenburg;\nAtkinson 2003; Thagard 2014; Sorensen 1992a, pp. 7–50;\nStuart 2014; Wilson 2016). At least thought experiments in science,\nthe skeptic claims, can be tested by physical experiment. However,\nthis is clearly false, since frictionless planes and universes empty\nof all material bodies cannot be produced in any laboratory. True, the\nresults of philosophical thought experiments cannot be even\napproximately tested. But, skeptics say little about why thought\nexperiments enjoy such popularity in philosophy. We are inclined to\nsay that skeptics underestimate the importance of thought experiments\nfor the creative mind in any field. \nFew are outright skeptics, however. Many take a more ambiguous stance.\nSören Häggqvist, for example, has developed a normative\nmodel for philosophical thought experiments (see Häggqvist 1996\nand 2009). Surprisingly, none of the commonly accepted philosophical\nthought experiments satisfies his model. And the process of\nidentifying successful thought experiments is only the first step in\naddressing the central epistemological challenge posed by thought\nexperiments. It gets much messier once we begin to ask exactly how\nreliable “successful” thought experiments are. Granted,\nthere is some justice in worrying about the reliability of\nphilosophical thought experiments (see, e.g., Klee 2008). This might\nbe true for ethics (see Dancy 1985, Jackson 1992; Wilson 2016),\nconceptual analysis (see Fodor 1964), and philosophy of mind:\n“A popular strategy in philosophy is to construct a certain sort\nof thought experiment I call intuition pump. […] Intuition\npumps are often abused, though seldom deliberately.” (Dennett\n1985, p. 12) The claim by Dennett and others is that thought\nexperiments too often rest on prejudice and faulty common sense; they\nare inherently conservative, while real science will likely result in\nhighly-counterintuitive outcomes. Dennett believes that thought\nexperiments rest on naive “folk concepts,” which is why they can\nbe so misguided. It is far from clear that this is a fair charge.\nEverything involved in Galileo’s thought experiment that produced\nthe principle of relativity could be called “folk concepts.” If we\nare inside a ship and perform a number of experiments, such as walking\nabout, tossing a ball, watching birds fly about, we could not tell\nwhether we are at rest in port or sailing over a smooth sea. The\nupshot is that nature behaves the same either way; the laws of nature\nare the same in any inertial frame. This result is profound and is\nstill with us in Einstein’s relativity, whether it is folk physics\nor not.  \nFrequently discussed is the skeptical challenge raised by Kathleen\nWilkes. She expresses a deep suspicion of scenarios such as Derek\nParfit’s people splitting like an amoeba (see Parfit 1987; Gendler\n2002a). Wilkes wants philosophy “to use science fact rather than\nscience fiction or fantasy” (Wilkes 1988, p. 1), and therefore\nto refrain from using thought experiments because they are “both\nproblematic and positively misleading.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 2) She\nclaims that thought experiments about personal identity in particular\noften fail to provide the background conditions against which the\nexperiment is set (see Wilkes 1988, p. 7). She thinks we would not\nknow what to say if we encountered someone who split like an amoeba.\nShe insists that a legitimate thought experiment must not violate the\nknown laws of nature. We do agree with Wilkes that underdetermination\ncan be a problem. But instead of dismissing thought experiments in\nphilosophy we should consider it a crucial factor in assessing the\nquality of a thought experiment (see Rescher 2005, pp. 9–14).\nThe more detailed the imaginary scenario in the relevant aspects, the\nbetter the thought experiment (see Brendel 2004, pp. 97–99;\nHäggqvist 1996, p. 28). \nWe also agree that the inferences drawn in thought experimenting are\nhighly problematic if the hypothetical scenario “is inadequately\ndescribed.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 8) But Wilkes seems to think that\nthe lack of description is unavoidable, which supposedly amounts to a\nreason against philosophical thought experiments on personal identity\nbecause persons are not natural kinds. This makes it impossible to\nfill in necessary information to make the thought experiment work\ngiven its unavoidable underdetermination. Wilkes thinks that\n“whenever we are examining the ranges of concepts that do not\npick on natural kinds, the problem of deciding what is or what is not\n‘relevant’ to the success of the thought experiment is yet\nmore problematic than the same question as it arises in science; and,\nunlike the scientific problem, it may not even have an answer in\nprinciple.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 15) She adds that scientific laws\n— especially those describing biological kinds like human beings\n— “are not disjoint and independent, detachable from one\nanother […]. They are interrelated, to varying degrees of\ncourse.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 29) This implies, for example, that\n“a full psychophysiological account of the processes of human\nperception must at some stage link up with part at least of linguistic\nability; for we typically see things under a certain description, and\nthat description may be a very sophisticated one.” (Wilkes\n1988, p. 29) These considerations have her rule out experiments that\nchallenge the human monopoly of personhood. No thought experiment,\nclaims Wilkes, is well conceived if it involves non-human animals or\ncomputers as persons. But also those thought experiments can be ruled\nout which involve the “fission or fusion of humans”\nbecause it is not theoretically possible. “The total impact of\nthe sum of laws that group us together as human beings (a natural kind\ncategory) precludes our splitting into two […] or fusing with\nsomeone else.” (Wilkes 1988, p. 36) \nOne can ascertain here all too well the inherent difficulties in\nthinking about personal identity and the limited benefit some thought\nexperiments might have for what is deemed the proper metaphysics of\npersonal identity. Nevertheless, good reasons have been given in\nfavour of the use of thought experiments about personal identity (see\nBeck 2006; Kolak 1993; Hershenov 2008). We also feel that the\nproblems about thought experiments on personal identity reveal more\nabout the intricate nature of the subject than about the usefulness of\nphilosophical thought experiments. And, disregarding other\nshortcomings in Wilkes’ skepticism (for further discussion of Wilkes’\nviews see Beck 1992; Brooks 1994; Focquaert 2003; Häggqvist\n1996, pp. 27–34), her suggestion that thought experimental\nscenarios would have to satisfy current scientific knowledge about the\nrelevant entities featured in a thought experiment is highly\nimplausible. We learn a great deal about the world and our theories\nwhen we wonder, for instance, what would have happened after the big\nbang if the law of gravity had been an inverse cube law instead of an\ninverse square. Would stars have failed to form? Reasoning about such\na scenario is perfectly coherent and very instructive, even though it\nviolates a law of nature. \nTo some extent we should share Wilkes’s concern that thought\nexperimenting seems to be constrained only by relevant logical\nimpossibilities and what seems intuitively acceptable. This is indeed\nproblematic because intuitions can be highly misleading and relevant\nlogical impossibilities are fairly ungrounded if they cannot be\nsupplemented by relevant theoretical impossibilities based on current\nscience in order to avoid the jump into futile fantasy. But in order\nto dismiss thought experimenting as a useful philosophical tool one\nhas to show that intuition cannot be a source of knowledge and that an\nepistemic tool should be useless because there is a serious chance it\ncan fail. Timothy Williamson has argued that we should forget about\nintuition as a cushion in the philosophical armchair (see Williamson\n2004a,b, 2008, pp. 179–207, and 2009; see also Schaffer 2017).\nThe importance of intuitions in philosophy has been neglected in the\npast (see Williamson 2004b, p. 109–110), and for too long\nintuition didn’t receive the attention it deserves (see, e.g., DePaul\nand Ramsey (eds.) 1998). Besides the traditional divide between\nempiricists, rationalists and skeptics, it is not only a very\nnon-uniform use of the word “intuition” that makes it\ndifficult to assess the progress of the last years of philosophical\ninquiry about intuitions. The situation has been complicated by the\ncontributions of experimental philosophers on intuitions who add\ndifferent reasons to question their reliability (see for a careful\ncritique of those reasons: Ludwig 2007; see also Ludwig 2018).\nGenerally speaking, the reliability of intuitions has been challenged\non two grounds. One stems from an evolutionary explanation of the\ncapacity to intuit; another is due to experiments which supposedly\nshow the cultural relativity or racial and gender sensitivity of\nintuitions (see, e.g., Buckwalter and Stich 2010): “…a\nsubstantial list of philosophical intuitions vary across demographic\ngroups and…they are influenced by a number of prima\nfacies irrelevant factors…Some writers…have urged\nthat these findings justify a thoroughgoing skepticism about the use\nof intuitions as evidence in philosophy…But we think this\nconclusion is much too strong…” (Stich & Toba 2018, p.\n379) After all, knowledge without intuitions (if only common sense assumptions) seems  impossible.  \nThe recent discussion of intuitions in epistemology has barely made an\nimpact on philosophical reflections about thought experiments. As far\nas philosophical thought experiments are concerned, this is as it\nshould be, according to Williamson. In this respect George Bealer can\nbe cited in support of Williamson, because for Bealer the talk about\nphilosophical thought experiments reveals a conceptual confusion.\nPhilosophy, he claims, is about “rational intuitions” and\nthought experiments can be only about “physical\nintuitions” (see Bealer 1998, pp. 207–208, and 2002, p.\n74). To many, this is an implausible claim based on a deeply\nproblematic “phenomenology of intuitions” resulting in a\nstrict separation of “rational intuitions” from\n“physical intuitions”, on such grounds as an alleged\nimmutability of “rational intuitions”. There are good\nreasons to believe that thought experiments appeal to intuitions in\norder to give us new insights about different realms of investigation,\nincluding philosophy. This kind of positive connection is what\nWilliamson has in mind when addressing the role of intuitions in\nphilosophical thought experiments like the famous Gettier cases, which\novernight found acceptance by the philosophical community in their aim\nto refute the view that knowledge is justified true belief. While\nWilliamson expects “armchair methods to play legitimately a more\ndominant role in future philosophy” (Williamson 2009, p. 126),\nhe thinks that “we should stop talking about intuition.”\n(Williamson 2004b, p. 152). This does not impress proponents of what\nwe call an intuition-based account of thought experiments, and\nprobably for good reasons, given the problems in Williamson’s approach\n(see, e.g., Dohrn 2016; Ichikawa and Jarvis 2009; Schaffer 2017),\nand the empirical evidence in favour of the positive role that\nintuitions can play in human cognition. \n(B) The Intuition–Based Account  \nWhat we term the “intuition–based account” of\nthought experiments comes in a naturalistic version (see Brendel 2004;\nGendler 2007), and in a Platonic version (see Brown 1991a [2011]). We\nbegin with a discussion of the latter. Brown holds that in a few\nspecial cases we do go well beyond the old empirical data to acquire a\npriori knowledge of nature (see also Koyré 1968). Galileo\nshowed that all bodies fall at the same speed with a brilliant thought\nexperiment that started by destroying the then reigning Aristotelian\naccount. The latter holds that heavy bodies fall faster than light\nones (H > L). But consider Figure 6, in which a\nheavy cannon ball (H) and light musket ball (L) are\nattached together to form a compound object (H+L);\nthe latter must fall faster than the cannon ball alone. Yet the\ncompound object must also fall slower, since the light part will act\nas a drag on the heavy part. Now we have a\ncontradiction: H+L >\nH and H > H+L. That’s the end\nof Aristotle’s theory. But there is a bonus, since the right account\nis now obvious: they all fall at the same speed (H =\nL = H+L). Figure 6. Galileo: “I don’t even have to look” \nBrown claims this is a priori (though still fallible) knowledge of\nnature, since there are no new data involved, nor is the conclusion\nderived from old data. Moreover, is it some sort of logical truth (for\nthe latest and most technical challenge of this claim see Urbaniak\n2012). This account of thought experiments can be further developed by\nlinking the a priori epistemology to accounts of laws of nature that\nhold that laws are relations among objectively existing abstract\nentities. It is thus a form of Platonism, not unlike Platonic accounts\nof mathematics such as that urged by Kurt Gödel.  \nThe two most often repeated arguments against this sort of Platonism are:\nit does not identify criteria to distinguish good from bad thought\nexperiments, and it violates the principle of ontological parsimony.\nHe would consider these weak objections.  Perhaps they find widespread acceptance\nbecause Platonism seems to be unfashionable these days (see Grundmann\n2018), given the general popularity of various forms of naturalism. If\nintuitions really do the job in a thought experiment, the first\nobjection is weak because neither rationalists nor empiricists have a\ntheory about the reliability of intuitions. So the objection should be\nthat intuitions probably just do not matter in human cognition.\nHowever, there are good reasons to question the truth of this claim\n(see Myers 2004). This is not to marginalize the problems that arise\nwhen admitting intuitions as a source of knowledge and justification,\nespecially in philosophy (see Hitchcock 2012).  \nAs for the second objection, the appeal to Occam’s razor is in general\nproblematic when it is employed to rule out a theory. Whatever we\neliminate by employing the principle of parsimony we can easily\nreintroduce it by an inference to the best explanation (see Meixner\n2000). And this is exactly what a Platonist contends his or her\nPlatonism about thought experimenting to be, while conceding that the\nPlatonic intuition appears miraculous. But are they really more\nmiraculous than sense perception, which seems similar in many respects\nto Platonic intuition? One might want to say yes, because supposedly\nwe have no clue at all how Platonic intuition works but we do have\nsome idea about the nature of sense perception. We know that if an\nobject is far away it appears smaller in vision, and under certain\nlight conditions the same object can look quite different. However, is\nit really impossible to state similar rules to capture the nature of\nPlatonic intuition? If you are drunk or lack attention you most\nprobably will not be very successful in intuiting anything of\nphilosophical value.  \nA review of the relevant psychological literature will reveal further\ncriteria that could be employed to identify good and bad conditions\nfor Platonic intuition while thought experimenting. Yet, proponents of\nthe naturalistic version of the intuition–based account wonder\nhow necessary Platonism is once this move is entertained in defence of\nthe reliability of intuitions (see Miščević 2004).\nElke Brendel defines intuitions as mental propositional attitudes\naccompanied with a strong feeling of certainty. In her view, we can\ntell two stories to make sense of their cognitive power and\nplasticity. One story relates to our biological constitution and\nevolutionary past. The other is about membership in specialized\ncommunities. Brendel’s account raises many questions, but it is\ndifficult to resist its appeal. A universal set is appealing to anyone\nnot trained in logic because most things we are familiar with can come\nin sets, such as books, tables, and philosophers. A set of all sets\nseems intuitively plausible. The intuition disappears once you worked\nyourself through the problems arising from the idea of a set of all\nsets. Brendel is quick to insist that such relativity of our\nintuitions doesn’t imply that they are cognitively useless. Without\nintuitions, we probably wouldn’t have knowledge, and thought\nexperiments are sometimes the only way to access the intuitions that\nguide us in our cognitive lives. (see Brendel 2004) \n(C) The Argument View  \nJohn D. Norton is the most influential advocate of what we call\n“the argument view” of thought experiments (see Norton\n1991, 1993, 1996, 2004a,b, 2008). Even though the argument view seems\nto be a natural option for empiricists, it seems that most empiricists\nfind Norton’s argument view too strong. For this reason, many\nparticipants in the debate about thought experiments place themselves\nbetween the extremes of Norton and Brown, who function as useful foils\nfor apparently more moderate outlooks. Perhaps (with tongue in cheek) they could \nagree with Bernard Shaw on the virtues of\nmoderation, when Shaw said of the typical member of the middle class\nthat he is moderately honest, moderately intelligent, and moderately\nfaithful to his spouse. Norton claims that any thought experiment is\nreally a (possibly disguised) argument; it starts with premises\ngrounded in experience and follows deductive or inductive rules of\ninference in arriving at its conclusion. The picturesque features of\nany thought experiment which give it an experimental flavour might be\npsychologically helpful, but are strictly redundant. Thus, says\nNorton, we never go beyond the empirical premises in a way to which\nany empiricist would object.  \nThere are three objections that might be offered against Norton.\nFirst, his notion of argument is too vague. However, this might not be\nthe best objection: arguments can be deductive (which are perfectly\nclear) or inductive. If the latter are unclear, the fault is with\ninduction, not with Norton’s argument view. Second, it is argued that\nNorton simply begs the question: every real world experiment can be\nrephrased as an argument, but nobody would say that real world\nexperiences are dispensable. The account does not address the question:\nwhere do the premises come from? A thought experiment might be an\nessential step in making the Norton-style reconstruction. Third, a\nthought experiment that is presented in argument form loses its\ntypical force. The soft-point in Brown’s Platonism is linked to the\nstrength of Norton’s account because Norton claims that any other view\nimplies a commitment to “asking the oracle.”\n“Imagine an oracle that claims mysterious powers but never\ndelivers predictions that could not be learned by simple inferences\nfrom ordinary experience. We would not believe that the oracle had any\nmysterious powers. I propose the same verdict for thought experiments\nin science.” (Norton 1996, pp. 1142–1143) Defenders of\nempiricist alternatives deny this dispensability thesis. Brendel\n(2018) offers a most comprehensive review of merits and perils of the\nargument view.  \n(D) Conceptual Constructivism  \n“Conceptual constructivism”, as we could call it, is among\nthe empiricist alternatives to the argument view. The position has\nbeen taken up by Van Dyck (2003) to account especially for\nHeisenberg’s ɣ-ray microscope; but also by Gendler (1998) to\nmakes sense of Galileo’s falling body thought experiment. Gendler’s\nproposal was advanced in more general terms by Camilleri (2014) in\norder to establish a firm middle ground between the views of Norton\nand Brown. Conceptual constructivism was first proposed by Thomas Kuhn\n(1964). He employs many of the concepts (but not the terminology) of\nhis well-known Structure of Scientific Revolutions. On his\nview a well-conceived thought experiment can bring on a crisis or at\nleast create an anomaly in the reigning theory and so contribute to\nparadigm change. Thought experiments can teach us something new about\nthe world, even though we have no new empirical data, by helping us to\nre-conceptualize the world in a new way. Accordingly, Fehige (2013b)\nentertains the option of conceptual constructivism in form of a\nNeo-Kantian reading of Einstein’s famous clock in the box thought\nexperiment. This proposal is inspired by Michael Friedman’s proposal\nto conceive of scientific revolutions as times when a Kantian kind of\nnatural philosophy plays a major role in guiding scientists from one\nparadigm to another. The work of Kuhn left us with a puzzle: if\nscientific rationality is absolutely dependent on a paradigm, and if\nduring scientific revolutions one paradigm replaces another, not in\ndegrees but like a Gestalt switch, then this transition from one\nparadigm to the next cannot be a matter of scientific rationality. Are\nscientific revolutions irrational periods in the history of science?\nNot necessarily, some kind of natural philosophy may guide the\nprocess. Friedman has a Kantian natural philosophy in mind; his\nproposal did not earn wide acceptance, but the problem remains (see\nFisch 2017). \n(E) Experimentalism  \nWhat we might term “experimentalism” encompasses a wide\nrange of different approaches which all assume that thought\nexperiments are a “limiting case” of ordinary experiments.\nExperimentalism was proposed first by Ernst Mach (1897 and 1905). He\ndefines experimenting in terms of its basic method of variation and\nits capacity to destroy prejudices about nature. According to Mach,\nexperimenting is innate to higher animals, including humans. The\nthought experiment just happens on a higher intellectual level but is\nbasically still an experiment. At the centre of thought experimenting\nis a “Gedankenerfahrung”, an experience in thought. Such\nan experience is possible because thought experiments draw from\n“unwillkürliche Abbildungen von Tatsachen”\n(non-arbitrary images of facts) acquired in past experiences of\nthe world. Some thought experiments are so convincing in their results\nthat an execution seems unnecessary; others could be conducted in a\nreal-world experiment, which is the most natural trajectory of a\nscientific thought experiment. In any case thought experiments can\nresult in a revision of belief, thereby demonstrating their\nsignificance for scientific progress. Mach also appreciates the\ndidactic value of thought experiments: they help us to realize what\ncan be accomplished in thinking and what cannot. \nIn the spirit of Mach, Roy A. Sorensen has offered an aspiring version\nof experimentalism that accounts for thought experiments in science\nand philosophy, and tackles many of the central issues of the topic.\nSorensen claims thought experiments are “a subset of unexecuted\nexperiments” (1992, p. 213). By their logical nature they are\nparadoxes that aim to test modal consequences of propositions. The\norigin of our capacity of thought experimentation is explained in\nterms of Darwinian evolution (as in Genz 1999, pp. 25–29),\nthough the explanation has been criticized to be only little more than\na ‘just so story’ that fails, on a posteriori grounds, to\nepistemically underwrite that capacity (see Maffie 1997). Others are\nmore optimistic (see Shepard 2008).  \nExperimentalism does not have to take a naturalistic turn as it does\nin Sorensen’s case. In a number of contributions Marco Buzzoni has\ndefended a Neo-Kantian version of experimentalism (see Buzzoni 2004,\n2007, 2008, 2011, 2011b, 2013, 2013b). Buzzoni (2008) argues for the\ndialectical unity of thought experiments and real-world experiments.\nThought experiments and real-world experiments are claimed to be\nidentical on the “technological-operational” level, and at\nleast in science, one is impossible without the other: without thought\nexperiments there wouldn’t be real-world experiments because we would\nnot know how to put questions to nature; without real-world\nexperiments there wouldn’t be answers to these questions or experience\nfrom which they could draw. Given the many scientific thought\nexperiments that cannot be realized in the real-world, Buzzoni might\nbe conflating thought experiments with imagined experiments to be\ncarried out in the real-world (see Fehige 2012, 2013b; and Buzzoni\n2013b).  \n(F) The Mental–Model Account  \nThe last of the many accounts that emerged in the discussion about\nthought experiments is what could be called the\n“mental–model account”. It attracts the most\nfollowers (see Andreas 2011; Bishop 1998; Cooper 2005; Gendler\n2004; Palmieri 2003; Nersessian 1992, 1993, 2007; McMullin 1985;\nMiščević 1992 and 2007). When we conduct a thought\nexperiment, according to champions of this view, we manipulate a\nmental model instead of a physical model: “The general claim is\nthat in certain problem-solving tasks people reason by constructing a\nmental model of the situations, events, and processes that in dynamic\ncases can be manipulated through simulation.” (Nersessian 2018,\np. 319) Like physical models, mental models are non-propositional in\nnature. This means first of all “that the carefully crafted\nthought–experimental narrative focuses on the construction of a\nmodel of a kind of situation and manipulating that model\nthrough simulation affords epistemic access to certain features of\ncurrent representations in a way that manipulating propositional\nrepresentations using logical rules cannot.” (Nersessian 2018,\np. 319–320) A narrative functions as a kind of user-manual for\nbuilding the model, but it isn’t identical to a thought\nexperiment. \nThe mental–model approach is one of the most promising of all\nthe accounts the literature on thought experiments has to offer, and\nthis for several reasons. First, it does not seem to be much of a\nstretch to draw connections to the intuition–based account. In\nfact, intuitions maybe the missing link to connect the essentially\nnon-propositional activities surrounding mental models, on the one\nhand, and the propositional aspects of thought experiments, on the\nother. After all, thought experiments involve propositional reasoning,\nand somehow the non-propositional and propositional aspects of thought\nexperiments must be linked in any account of thought experiments. This\nis urgent insofar as thought experiments are credited with a\nmeaningful role in theory discovery and theory choice. Second, the\nmental–model approach also allows for inclusion of important\nelements of experimentalism and the argument–view. Thought\nexperiments are realized in the mind on mental models, and the method\nof variation is employed such that the results of the experiment may\nbe subject to a careful reconstruction of propositional lines of\nreasoning to submit it for careful assessment and critique. Fourth,\nthe mental–model approach enables us to bring an aspect into\nfocus that has been widely neglected in the discussion so far: the\nbodily component of (thought) experiments. The exception is the work\nof the late David Gooding (1992, 1993, 1994, and 1999). Fifth, in\ncritical engagement with such naturalistic proposals, those theories\nof the body may be put to work that the philosophical school of\nphenomenology has produced (see Fehige and Wiltsche 2013). To be\nwelcomed, therefore, is the entry of phenomenology into the discussion\non thought experiments (see Hopp 2014; Wiltsche 2018). Sixth, the\nmental–model account also relates naturally to the most\nintriguing discussions about the role of literary fiction in thought\nexperiments.  \nSome have placed “literary fiction on the level of thought\nexperiments.” (Swirski 2007, p. 6) There are two readings of\nsuch a claim. According to the first, some literary fiction may be of\ncognitive power due to the fact that they are thought experiments. In\nother words, we shouldn’t outright reject the idea that literature can\nbe of cognitive value. Dystopian novels such as Orwell’s 1984\nand Huxley’s Brave New World are obvious examples. According\nto the second reading, the power of thought experiments is partially a\nfunction of the narrative that conveys it. The work of Novalis remains\nrelevant for the exploration of this link between narrative\ndevelopment and thought experiment: experimental writing and\nexperiments on imagined scenarios go hand in hand; words and thoughts\ncoincide; mind and matter are entangled (see, e.g., Fehige 2013a)\nAccording to the mental–model approach, both readings have a\nvalid point. Literary fiction and narratives of thought experiments\ncan be powerful in establishing mental models in such a way that we\ncan even learn new things about the world at times from the fictional\nelements of them. The common denominator is the work on mental models\neach may facilitate. It is in this context that an appreciation can\ngrow for Catherine Elgin’s theory of exemplification to argue against\nthe “valorization of truth in epistemology” (2004, p.\n113). This is also the place to consider Andras Kertesz (2015) work on\nconceptual metaphor research in its relevance to the epistemological\npuzzle that thought experiments pose. \nFinally, eighth, mention could be made of visual reasoning in\nmathematics, which often seems closely related to thought experiments.\nThe standard view of mathematics is that the one and only source of\nevidence is a proof, and a proof is a derivation from axioms or first\nprinciples. Let’s overlook the problem of where the first principles\ncome from. A simple example such as the following casts doubt on the\nstandard view. \nTheorem: 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n = n2/2 + n/2 \nProof: See Figure 7. Figure 7. Picture proof. \nThe proof works like this: Start at the top and work down, letting the\nlittle squares represent numbers, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5. The\ntotal number of squares in the picture is equal to this sum. Notice\nalso that the numbers of squares is equal to a large square with sides\nof length 5 that is cut in half along the diagonal, i.e.,\n52/2, plus the shaded bits that were cut off by\nthe diagonal cut, i.e., 5/2. It is plausible to claim that\nthe diagram is a perfectly good proof of the theorem. One can\n“see” complete generality in the picture. Even though it only\nillustrates the theorem for n = 5, somehow we can see that it\nworks for every number, all infinitely many of them. The diagram does\nnot implicitly suggest a “rigorous” verbal or symbolic proof. The\nregular proof of this theorem is by mathematical induction, but the\ndiagram does not correspond to an inductive proof at all, since the\nkey element in an inductive proof is the passage from n to\nn + 1. The simple moral we could draw from the example is\njust this: We can in special cases correctly infer theorems from\npictures, that is, from visualizable situations. There is an intuition\nand from this intuition we can grasp the truth of the theorem. (See\nBrown 1999 [2008].)  \nThis assessment of the current situation is very rough and speculative,\nthough certainly not implausible. Of course, there are challenges to\nsuch a vision of a greater synthesis of the many different takes on\nthought experiments. For example, some see additional support arising\nfor the argument–view from computer simulations (see Beisbart\n2012). Others find that “computational modeling is largely\nreplacing thought experimenting, and the latter will play only a\nlimited role in future practice of science, especially in the sciences\nof complex nonlinear, dynamical phenomena” (see Chandrasekharan\net al. 2012, p. 239). But, there are also proposals such as\nthat by Marcus Schulzke (2014) to think of video games philosophically\nas executable thought experiments. Whatever the merits of this\nparticular proposal, future explorations of the relationship between\ncomputer simulations and thought experiments can build on outcomes of\ncloser inquiries into it (see Behmel 2001, pp. 98–108; Di Paolo\net al. 2000; El Skaf and Imbert 2013; Lenhard 2011;\nStäudner 1998; Lenhard 2018). The work on the nature of the\nimportance of scientific understanding (see, e.g., Stuart 2018) will\ninform that exploration as much as the fruits of continuing efforts to\nclarify the role of the imagination in thought experiments (see, e.g.,\nMeynell 2014; Stuart 2017 and forthcoming (b)). \nWe conclude with an interesting, but still relatively unexplored issue\nthat concerns the relative importance of thought experiments in\ndifferent disciplines. Physics and philosophy use them extensively.\nChemistry, by contrast, seems to have few or none at all. Why is this\nthe case? Perhaps it is merely an historical accident that chemists\nnever developed a culture of doing thought experiments. Perhaps it is\ntied to some deep feature of the discipline itself (see Snooks 2006).\nEconomics and history use thought experiments, but apparently not\nanthropology. A good explanation would likely tell us a lot about the\nstructure of these disciplines. \nRelated to this is the question of the difference, if any, between\nthought experiments in the sciences and those in philosophy.  We have\nassumed throughout this article that they are the same kind of thing.\nNot everyone sees them this way, so perhaps it should be considered an\nopen question.  On the one hand, philosophy and science seem to many\nto be different kinds of activities.  That might suggest that thought\nexperiments would differ in the two areas.  On the other hand, there\nis a huge difference between thought experiments within a single\nfield, e.g., Newton’s bucket attempts to establish absolute space\nwhile Schrodinger’s cat aims to show QM as then understood to be\nabsurd.  Is the difference between them less than the difference\nbetween either of them and Searle’s Chinese Room or Thomson’s\nviolinist?  The case one way or the other is not obvious.  Of course,\nthere are differences between constructive and destructive thought\nexperiments, but this is true within any discipline.  Perhaps for now\nthe default attitude ought to be that there is no principle difference\nbetween scientific and philosophical thought experiments.  This should\nnot be treated as a dogmatic principle, but rather a stimulus to look\ndeeper for important subtle contrasts.","contact.mail":"yiftach.fehige@utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"utoronto.ca"}]
