The goods they generate—or, perhaps, of which\nthey consist—are obviously important, both instrumentally and\nnon-instrumentally, for how well individuals’ lives go on\nvarious accounts of what makes a life good: They are highly desired by\nmost people, can bring a lot of pleasure and joy and, at least some of\nthem—such as friendship or love—have objective value. More\nrecently, these goods have also been said to be relevant to\ndetermining individuals’ duties and even rights. In particular,\nthere are several reasons to be concerned with their distribution:\nPersonal relationship goods represent a significant and\nnon-substitutable component of individuals’ well-being, are a\nsignificant kind of personal resource as well as a major determinant\nof individuals’ opportunities.\n\n\nIt seems important to ensure that all individuals enjoy these goods to\na sufficient, or perhaps equal, degree. Theories of\njustice—which have for a long time been mostly preoccupied with\nthe distribution of material goods—started to show interest in\nthe distribution of personal relationship goods. And yet, the claims\nthat there are duties of justice to distribute them and that states\nare (amongst) the bearers of such duties raise several problems.\n\n\nHere, “relationship goods” refers to those goods of\nconstitutive (as well as, often, instrumental) value that accrue to\nindividuals in virtue of them being in relationships with other\npeople, and that could not be enjoyed outside relationships. Examples\ninclude companionship, affection, intimacy, attachment, love,\nfriendship, empathy, social respect, solidarity, trust. The\ndistinction between relationships and some of the relationship goods\nidentified here may be purely analytical: Relationships partly consist\nof these goods, as they would not exists—or would not be the\nkind of relationships they are—in the absence of these\n“goods”. To some extent, our language bears witness to\nthis: we use “love” or “friendship” both in\norder to refer to types of relationships and to refer to the things\nthat individuals “get” out of relationships. Therefore,\ntalking about relationship goods—as well as about distributing\nthem—is artificial, yet helpful for the purpose of the present\nnormative analysis. \nOne sub-category of relationship goods that has received philosophical\nattention recently are familial relationship goods: these are\nrelationship goods that accrue to individuals in virtue of them being\nin an adequate parent-child relationship (Macleod 2002; Brighouse\n& Swift 2014). They include things such as providing authoritative\ncare for a child, the special spontaneous love and intimacy that (it\nhas been argued) is only possible between a child and a parental\nfigure, and a sense of continuity with the past and the future that is\ncreated by being part of a family. Another example of relationship\ngoods are political relationship goods: These are relationship goods\nthat accrue to individuals in virtue of them being in political\nrelationships with each other (personal or not)—for instance\nwith co-citizens or co-nationals, fellow members of the same political\norganization such as a party or a trade union. Examples include voting\nrights, social respect, social trust, social solidarity, as well as\nthose goods that are the focus of relational egalitarianism—a\nstrand of egalitarianism interested in how we relate to each others as\nequals—such as respect, recognition, inclusion, and community\n(Honneth 1992; Wolff 1998; Anderson 1999; Young 1990; Gheaus\n2018). \nThe subject of this entry is a large sub-class of relationship goods,\n“personal relationship goods”; they accrue to individuals\nin virtue of them being in relationships that involve some kind of\ndirect, personalized interaction—for instance with friends,\nfamily members, neighbors, colleagues, people who are active in the\nsame political or social movement, or even strangers with whom one\ngets into direct contact that is substantial enough to be personal.\nRelationships that don’t qualify for this description are often\nanonymous interactions, like one-off interactions with a clerk or a\nmall employee often are. People involved in some personal\nrelationships may also stand in a political relationship, and then the\ngoods realized in the relationships are also political. Examples are\nthe personalized trust, solidarity or loyalty that can bind\nindividuals who relate directly to each other as part of a political\nmovement. Other such goods are personal relationship goods realized in\nnon-political relationships. Examples are companionship, affection,\nattention, sympathy, encouragement, acceptance or loyalty and trust\nthat one gives and receives qua part of a personal\nrelationship. \nExamples of relationship goods that are not personal\nrelationship goods are social solidarity—expressed through the\nexistence of a social security net—social\ninclusion—expressed, for instance, in anti-discrimination\nlaws—or voting rights. One can enjoy these goods even in the\nabsence of direct, personal encounters with other individuals. \nBecause the scope of this entry includes goods that are realized in\nrelationships that are personal but not close, or intimate, this\ndefinition of relationship goods is wider than that implicit in Chiara\nCordelli’s notion of relational resources. These are resources\nmade available through  \nintimate relationships such as relationships of familial love,\nfriendship, and kinship, as well as non-intimate relationships between\ncolleagues, neighbors, members of voluntary associations, and\nparticipants in a common social network  \nbut not through  \nthe more abstract relation of political citizenship. (Cordelli 2015a:\n90)  \nAt the same time, it is a narrower understanding of relational goods\nthan other notions discussed in recent literature (Seglow 2013), which\ninclude relationship goods that do not flow from personal, but from\nmore anonymous, relationships such as those between co-citizens. \n“Personal relationship goods in general” are personal\nrelationship goods that are accessible to, valuable for, and possibly\nowed to people of any age. For the purpose of this entry,\n“personal relationship goods for children” are personal\nrelationship goods that have only been said to be owed to\nchildren. \nThe main philosophical issue raised by personal relationship goods is\nthe following: They are highly valuable for all individuals (in ways\nexplained below) both non-instrumentally and instrumentally. And they\nare especially important for children, because they are essential for\ntheir survival, for flourishing qua children and for\ndevelopmental reasons. For these reasons, it is clear that personal\nrelationships generate weighty reasons for action. The main\ntask of practical philosophers is then to see how weighty these\nreasons are, and, in particular, whether personal relationship goods\nalso generate moral duties: Are there any duties to ensure people\nenjoy (opportunities to) them? And if so, are some of these duties\nduties of justice? Are they enforceable as in a) feasible to enforce\nand b) legitimate to enforce? And what kind of measures can states\ntake to ensure a fairer distribution of these goods? \nTwo bodies of philosophical work, on the ethics of care and on\nassociative duties, are centered around the normative significance of\npersonal relationship goods and the moral and political issues they\nraise. \nAn influential strand of feminist ethics developed over the past four\ndecades, the ethics of care, is one area of philosophy that implicitly\nrecognizes personal relationship goods because “care” is,\nitself, a main relationship good which has been claimed to play a\ncentral role in moral, and, more recently, in political thinking. \nPerhaps the best way to individuate the ethics of care is as a strand\nof ethics concerned with the meeting of the needs of others within\npersonal relationships (Tronto 1993). But “care” is used\nin feminist ethics to refer to slightly different things (Collins\n2015). The reference to needs is the common link between different\naccounts of the proper subject-matter of the ethics of care. (In this\nentry, “needs” and “important interests” are\nused interchangeably). The ethics of care is, first, about a type of\nwork, or labor, as when someone is said to “take care of”\nsomeone else in situations like nursing a baby or looking after an ill\nperson. Some care ethicists ascribe special, if not exclusive, moral\nvalue to caring for those individuals who cannot meet the needs in\nquestion themselves (Bubeck 1995). This meaning often extends to a\nwider range of activities such as education or physical and mental\nhealth care. According to a second view, the ethics of care is about\nclose relationships between persons, based on a special emotional bond\nand including a commitment to each other’s wellbeing (Ruddick\n1998). Much of the ethics of care—at least in early\nstages—has focused on close personal relationships such as\nmothering or friendship; the assumption here is that caring meets the\nneed for bonding, or attachment (Gheaus 2009: 64). In a third way,\n“care” is understood as a disposition to behave in certain\nways: to be attentive and sensitive to other people’s needs and\nwilling to help them. In this sense, “care” is a virtue,\nand the ethics of care a form of virtue ethics. As a virtue, care is a\ngeneral attitude, opposed to callousness and indifference to the needs\nof others. \nWhether understood as an activity, relationship or disposition geared\ntowards meeting needs, care has been attributed universal moral value.\nMany care ethicists were interested in the crucial role of care-giving\nfor agency and for individual and species survival. First, without\nreceiving care within relationships, infants are unlikely to survive,\nlet alone thrive (Ruddick 1989). Moreover, care is necessary for the\ncoming into existence of persons: it is only within relationships with\ngood care-givers that children can acquire moral knowledge and\ndispositions and, ultimately, full agency (Held 1993). Similarly, some\ncare ethicists argue that friendship is necessary for developing a\nrich sense of autonomy, since friends give us the most direct access\nto particular values and conceptions of the good (Friedman 1993)\nSecond, as Eva Kittay argues, care has universal value because most\nindividuals require it to different degrees at different moments\nthroughout their lives beyond infancy or childhood: some of us only\nduring illness and old age, while others—people who are\nchronically ill or disabled—more or less continuously (Kittay\n1999). \nBecause it is necessary for the creation of persons, care ethicists\nhave claimed that care is more basic to morality than rights and\nduties, since in its absence most rights are useless. Care being so\nbasic to our survival and flourishing provides a presumptive reason to\nassume there are duties to ensure that everyone receives sufficient\ncare. It is difficult to determine what some care ethicists think\nabout such a duty, because the ethics of care has, at least in the\nbeginning, been coined in opposition to the language of rights and\nduties (Gilligan 1982; Noddings 1984). More generally, much of the\nethics of care arose from a skepticism concerning moral principles\n(Collins 2015). Thus, the question of whether we have a general duty\nof beneficence to extend our care to those who seem to be left out has\nnot received much attention (but for a recent exception see Collins\n2013). \nMore recently, care ethicists interested in theories of distributive\njustice have defended the view that care is one of the goods whose\ndistribution should concern us. This means that we ought to shape\ninstitutions to ensure that everyone receives care in accordance to\nthe demands of justice. Kittay proposed a principle of distributing\ncare that regulates both the giving and the receiving of care:  \nTo each according to his or her need for care, from each according to\nhis or her capacity for care, and such support from social\ninstitutions as to make available resources and opportunities to those\nproviding care, so that all will be adequately attended in relations\nthat are sustaining. (Kittay 1999: 113)  \nSimilarly, Daniel Engster (2007) believes that care is the core of\nmorality: because human dependency is universal, individuals have a\nmoral duty to care for others as well as a moral right to receive care\nwhen they cannot meet the relevant needs themselves. The duty is to\ngive care, when possible, directly; but, because uncoordinated\nindividuals cannot ensure that everyone receives adequate care,\ngovernments should take on the responsibility to organize it such that\nit reaches all individuals in times of need. \nA new wave of philosophical work (reviewed in\n section 3)\n looks more closely at the goods that are uniquely available through\npersonal relationships, including relationships based on care, and\nprovides a variety of reasons why there may be duties to provide these\ngoods. Most of these views have a particular interest in reasons why\nthe distribution of (access to) these goods is a matter of\njustice. \nBecause of their central concern with meeting needs, care ethicists\nhave identified different goods generated by different types of caring\nrelationships; for instance, according to Ruddick, the three main aims\nof mothering are to protect the child from physical harm, to foster\nher physical, emotional and intellectual growth and to socialize her\n(Ruddick 1989). To fulfill such aims, and especially the second two,\none has to provide a mix of material and non-material care-giving.\nCare ethicists in general have not operated with the distinction\nbetween material and non-material care-giving. This distinction is\ncrucial for establishing which are the goods that can be uniquely\nrealized in caring, and, more generally, in personal relationships.\nAnd some have proposed definitions of care that indirectly exclude\nsome of the personal relationship goods from the scope of care. For\ninstance, according to Engster, care is  \neverything we do directly to help individuals to meet their vital\nbiological needs, develop or maintain their basic capabilities, and\navoid or alleviate unnecessary or unwanted pain and suffering, so that\nthey can survive, develop and function in society. (Engster 2007: 29)\n \nThis implies that meeting some of the psychological needs of an adult\nfriend—those related to flourishing rather than with avoiding\nsuffering—may not qualify as care. \nYet, material care-giving may be available outside any (personal)\nrelationship: for instance, robots can actually or conceivably provide\nit. It is likely that the goods that require only material care-giving\ncan be realized outside any relationship with people and therefore are\nnot personal relationship goods. Note that the distinction between\nmaterial and non-material care-giving does not overlap with that\nbetween material and non-material needs: It may take some non-material\ncare-giving in order to meet a material need—if, for instance,\nit turned out that physical health and normal development depends in\npart on providing emotional nurturance. Further, it might matter\nnon-materially that some material needs are supplied by a person\nrather than a robot. \nIt is normatively important whether some non-material care-giving,\ntoo, can be given outside relationships—for instance, whether\nrobots can successfully be used to meet the psychological needs that\nare usually met by those who relate to us within caring\nrelationships. Some argue that we should use robots to make certain\nkinds of emotional care-giving available—for instance, to ensure\nthat elderly people living alone (usually in highly atomized\nsocieties) have access to robot-provided companionship (Aronson 2014).\nHowever, one can plausibly assume that no robot can provide genuine\ncompanionship, which requires access to another individual’s\nmind. (At least, as Brake (2017) notes, unless and until we will have\ndeveloped true artificial intelligence.) The same is true for other\npersonal relationship goods—attention, affection, sympathy,\nencouragement etc.—which are necessary to meet psychological\nneeds. Therefore, of the senses of “care” outlined above,\nthe most relevant for personal relationship goods is that of caring\nrelationships (see also Brake 2017). \nThe interest in how personal relationships and the goods they produce\ngenerate reasons has given rise to a large and growing body of\nliterature outside the ethics of care (Scheffler 2001; Kolodny 2003;\nKeller 2013; Seglow 2013). Our reasons to be partial towards our close\nassociates often take the form of prima facie duties. Unlike\nsome of the care ethicists (Noddings 2002), its authors do not assume\nthat (close) personal relationships are the paradigm of the rest of\nmorality. Rather, they start from the observation that people have\nspecial permissions towards, and owe special duties to, those with\nwhom they are in personal relationships, such as friends, spouses, or\nfamily members. Often such duties are called associative\nduties. (Although it is also possible that the reasons generated by\npersonal relationships are not moral reasons, in which case they do\nnot generate moral duties; for an argument why not all good reasons\nare moral reasons see Susan Wolf 1992). \nThere is a debate over whether or not all associative duties can be\nreduced to impartial duties. One plausible interpretation is that we\nall have a general duty to protect the vulnerable and those with whom\nwe stand in personal relationships are unusually vulnerable to us; and\nwe have powerful consequentialist reasons to welcome the formation of\npersonal relationships—and hence the generation of associative\nduties—in order to solve coordination problems (Goodin 1985). A\ncommon complaint about reductionist, or impartial, theories is that\nthey are self-effacing (Keller 2013; Collins 2013): it seems\nappropriate for the agent who is subject to the duty to be motivated\nby their attitude towards the individual to whom the duty is owed, or\nmaybe by the value of the relationship, rather than by impartial\nconsiderations. \nAssuming associative duties are indeed irreducible to impartial\nduties, what is their ground? Most prominent families of accounts\npoint to personal projects, to the value the relationship or the value\nof the person to whom the duty is being owed (for a recent critical\ndiscussion see Keller 2013). On the first kind of view, agents’\nground projects—that is, fundamental commitments that are\nclosely connected to their practical identity—give rise to\nreasons (Williams 1981), and possibly duties, and some personal\nrelationships are amongst these projects. According to another view,\nprojects are not morally appropriate grounds for associative duties;\nrather, associative reasons respond to the value of the person with\nwhom one has a personal relationship (Keller 2013). But strangers have\nthe same moral value as our associates; this account will struggle to\nexplain why we only have reasons of partiality towards those with whom\nwe are in relationships. Finally, perhaps the most widespread family\nof views justifies associative duties as grounded in the\nnon-instrumental value of relationships (Scheffler 2001; Seglow 2013),\nor in their final value (Kolodny 2003), or in their moral goodness\n(Jeske 2008). According to some philosophers, moreover, the value of\nsome personal relationships is partly constituted by parties living up\nto their associative duties (Raz 1989; Brighouse & Swift 2014).\nOne version of this view, that is particularly interesting for this\nentry, is Jonathan Seglow’s appeal to relationship goods in\norder to justify associative duties (Seglow 2013). Seglow argues that\nthe most plausible way of interpreting the claim that relationships\ngenerate duties on account of their value is to see how the\nrelationships contribute to the flourishing of the people involved.\nAnd this, in turn, is best understood in terms of the goods uniquely\nmade possible by relationships such as friendships, parent-child\nrelationships and membership in various associations. According to\nSeglow, personal relationship goods are distinctive to these\nrelationships: for instance parents and children owe each other love,\nco-citizens owe each other respect, etc. \nNote that there is also logical space for the possibility that\nsome associative duties exist independently from the value of\nthe relationship, for pragmatic reasons, while others, which some have\ncalled pure associative duties, exist in virtue of the\nnon-instrumental value of the relationship (Macleod 2010a). \nThe existence and weight of personal relationship goods is widely\nacknowledged irrespective of one’s position on these debates,\nnamely whether one thinks that (a) personal relationships generate\nassociative duties or merely (non-moral) reasons, (b) associative\nduties are reducible to impartial duties or not and (c) associative\nreasons are grounded in personal projects, the value of individuals to\nwhom the duty is being owed, or the value of the relationship.\nObviously, some goods that are crucial for most people’s\nwellbeing can only exist due to human beings’ relational nature:\nfriendship, love, emotional care, attention, affection, company\netc. \nPersonal relationship goods are not always easy to individuate. This\nis illustrated in debates about one particular personal relationship,\nand the good that it generates, namely love—a topic that has\nreceived much recent philosophical interest. Love is a form of valuing\nanother individual, whether as an appropriate response to her value\n(Velleman 1999) or by bestowing value on her through the relationship\nwith the beloved (Frankfurt 2004), perhaps by creating a common\nhistory between the individuals in the relationship (Kolodny 2003,\n2010). In either case, love has been said to depend on, or even be\nconstituted by, other personal relationship goods. On David\nVelleman’s (1999) account, according to which love is an\nappraisal of value, an ability to pay special attention to some\nindividuals to whom one is willing to become vulnerable is what makes\npossible love for particular individuals. Others, too, think that\nloving consists in directing one’s attention in order to attend\nto the valuable features of the beloved (Jollimore 2011) and some of Velleman’s\nphilosophical predecessors, such as Iris Murdoch, believed that\nattention is the very essence of love and claimed that “Love is\nthe extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself\nis real” (Murdoch 1959: 51). On this view, love seems to respond\nto a need to be seen by others, to be known as one really is rather\nthan be a mere pretext for other individuals’ projections. An\nalternative view identifies love as a form of robust concern, or care,\nfor the beloved, for her own sake (Soble 1990; LaFollette 1996;\nFrankfurt 1999). \nThe existence of personal relationship goods and of the reasons that\nflow from personal associations create several moral problems: One is\nto explain why it is justified to display partiality towards some\nindividuals, given the standard assumption that morality requires us\nto treat people impartially. The various accounts of associative\nreasons/duties outlined at the beginning of this section grapple with\nthis problem. \nA second problem is that it seems morally objectionable, and possibly\nwrong, that people do not benefit equally from personal relationships\nand the goods they generate. Some people are lonely, out of no choice\nor fault of their own; and those who do enjoy (good) personal\nrelationships have partners who can be very unequally resourceful\nand/or invested in the relationship. This is a distributive objection\n(Scheffler 2001), and it obtains independently from the truth about\nthe existence and nature of associative duties. However, if we do have\nassociative duties towards our near and dear, rather than mere reasons\nto bestow personal relationship goods onto them, the inequalities and\nunfairness are even more evident. Personal relationship goods have\nboth instrumental and non-instrumental value (the next section unpacks\nthese different kinds of value and the way it bears on matters of\njustice). To illustrate, love is non-instrumentally valuable to the\nbeloved, and it also allows the beloved to enjoy other desirable\nthings—such as pleasure, or the advantages of having someone who\nknows her well and who is motivated to serve her interests. Therefore,\nthe enjoyment of functional loving relationships makes one better off.\nFurther, some of the benefits that loving relationships bestow on the\nbeloved can have a positional aspect—that is, they give the\nbeloved a competitive edge over others when it comes to opportunities\nfor goods that are external to the relationship. For instance, the\nformal and informal education that loving and resourceful parents give\nto their children do not merely make these children better off than\nthey would otherwise be; but, because they place them in more\nadvantageous positions in the competition for the social goods, they\nrender children who do not benefit from loving and/or resourceful\nparents worse off (Brighouse & Swift 2006). \nThe distributive objection provides support to the belief that there\nare moral duties to try and associate with those who don’t yet\nbenefit from close relationships in order to give them an opportunity\nto enjoy various personal relationship goods (Collins 2013) or to\ncreate the social conditions in people are likely to form valuable\nrelationships (as surveyed in\n section 6). \nPersonal relationship goods have been argued to have constitutive\nvalue, as explained in 3.1. Maybe even more obviously, they are\nvaluable as instrumental to various important ends, explored by\nsubsections 3.2 to 3.7. Philosophers advance arguments proceeding from\nthe particular kinds of value of personal relationship goods to the\nconclusion that there are duties to provide them. In some cases, they\nmay generate duties of justice and individual entitlements. \nOne of the main insights of the ethics of care is that some goods that\nare only available through close personal relationships are essential\nfor any flourishing life. Other philosophers have, more recently,\ndefended more specific claims. \nFirst, personal relationship goods realized in close relationships are\nconstitutive of good lives (Liao 2006; Lynch et al. 2009; Gheaus 2009,\n2017; Brownlee 2013, 2016a).\nThis is perhaps most obvious for those goods that have an affective\nquality (that is, most of them). The largest longitudinal study in\nadult development to date (Vaillant 2012) indicates that personal\nrelationships are—most likely thanks to the goods they\ngenerate—indispensable to subjective life satisfaction (but also\npositively correlated with other valuable outcomes such as longevity\nand health—see\n 3.2).\n And an extensive study conducted by a team of philosophers and\nsociologists in Ireland revealed that close relationships and the\nunique goods they generate are for many adults the most important\ncomponent of their life plans, or at least more important than other\nforms of advantage (Lynch et al. 2009). For children, too, some\npersonal relationship goods, especially those available in\nparent-children relationships, are constitutive of good lives: it is\nhard to see how a good childhood could be (entirely) devoid of loving\ncare from parental figures, kindness from adults in general and\nfriendship with peers. Familial relationship goods—including the\nspecial sort of intimacy between parents and children and the unique\nfiduciary responsibility of parents—have also been said to be\nconstitutive of (most) potential parents’ full flourishing\n(Brighouse & Swift 2014). On this latter account, the goods have\nconstitutive value in an objective sense. \nFurther personal relationship goods that are political may contribute\nin a constitutive way to good, or flourishing, lives (Brownlee 2013:\n200; Gheaus 2018). These goods include non-discrimination,\nnon-marginalization and non-domination by fellow citizens with whom we\nstand in personal relationships, such as those with whom we work in\npolitical organizations or with whom we repeatedly share public\nspaces.  \nBecause personal relationship goods are part and parcel of good lives,\nsome believe we have duties to extend our friendship to others if we\ncan (Collins 2013). Onora O’Neill (1988) thinks that adults have\na fundamental duty to be kind and cheerful towards children, and\ninvolved in their lives, but perhaps the duty could be extended to all\nindividuals. The duty is, originally, incomplete, or\nimperfect—that is, not owed to all children and up to the agent\nto judge when to exercise. O’Neill acknowledges that part of the\nduty can become perfect—and its recipients can acquire\ncorresponding rights—through institutionalization, which is what\nhappens when children are being taken into care; but she doubts that\nall the moral duties associated with the roles of parent, teacher or\nsocial worker can be institutionalized. More generally, one view is\nthat duties with respect to at least some of the personal relationship\ngoods are matters of benevolence rather than justice, and that\nattempts to institutionalize them would be particularly stigmatizing\nor otherwise self-defeating (Gheaus 2009; Valentini 2016). Another,\npossibly compatible, view, defended by Kimberley Brownlee is that the\nprovision of some personal relationship goods is a matter of justice\nwhen they are constitutive of minimally good lives.\nSpecifically, her claim is that there is a human right to the\nunconditional provision of enough opportunities for decent\ninterpersonal contact (Brownlee 2013, forthcoming). With respect to\nfamilial relationship goods, Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift (2014)\nargue that adults who would make adequate parents are owed an\nopportunity to enjoy the goods of intimate, caring and authoritative\nrelationships with children. \nFirst and foremost, personal relationship goods are necessary for\nminimally functional lives (Kittay 1999; Liao 2006; Gheaus 2009;\nBrownlee 2013, 2016a). As\nalready noted, a foundational claim of the ethics of care is that all\nindividuals go through periods of vulnerability—most notably\nchildhood—during which they cannot survive, let alone flourish,\nwithout the care of another human being. Relying on empirical\nresearch, Brownlee (2013) extends a similar claim to people of all\nages. She argues that chronic lack of adequate social contact  \ngenerates the same threat response as pain, thirst, hunger, or fear by\nsetting off a chain of anxiety-inducing physiological reactions known\nas the ‘fight or flight’ response. (p. 211)  \nand leads to a host of physical and mental health problems such as\nhigh blood pressure, obesity, diminished immunity, alcoholism,\nsuicidal tendencies and depression. Adequate social contact, in this\ncontext, includes ongoing relationships that are not (significantly)\nabusive or neglectful and that provide psychological support and\nacceptance. Not only children’s health, and that of individuals\nwho are ill or disabled, but everybody’s, depends on being in\nsome personal relationship(s). Further, she claims, individuals’\nemotional, linguistic, and social abilities also depend on enough\nsocial contact. \nBrownlee argues that, because “when we are deprived of adequate\nsocial connections … we tend to break down mentally,\nemotionally, and physically” (2016a: 55), we have rights to the\nprovision of those personal relationship goods that make minimally\nadequate lives possible. A group of personal relationship goods that\nhas obvious instrumental value are those realized in very close caring\nrelationships. It is difficult to dispute that some such goods,\nincluding affection, companionship, emotional care, attention,\nencouragement and so on contribute to other aspects of\nindividuals’ wellbeing. More controversially, Matthew Liao\nargues—relying on empirical sources—that lack of love\nthreatens the physical, psychological and social development of\nchildren and therefore entitles them to love (Liao 2006, 2015; Cowden\n2012a). (The alleged duty to\nlove children is more fully discussed in\n section 4). \nCertain personal relationship goods have been argued to be\ninstrumentally valuable in a way that provides a direct reason for\ntheir universal provision: If we cannot develop autonomy without\nenjoying some of these goods, and if we owe individuals help to\ndevelop and preserve their autonomy, then all individuals are entitled\nto the personal relationship goods necessary for autonomy. \nAs we have seen, with respect to children the argument is\nstraightforward: it is difficult to see how one could acquire moral\nresponsibility, and eventually become fully autonomous, without close\nand ongoing relationships with moral mentors. As Virginia Held argues,\nit is the work of parents to create persons (Held 1993). But adults,\ntoo, have been said to require enough decent human constant in order\nto maintain their autonomy: if social deprivation is likely to\nseriously erode mental health, then it will eventually also undermine\nautonomy (Brownlee 2013). One illustration, often discussed by\nBrownlee (2013, forthcoming), is that of prisoners held in isolation\nwho sometimes end up preferring brutal interaction with interrogators\nto continued forced solitude. Even less than minimally decent\nrelationships seem desirable compared to the mental suffering, and\neventual psychological disintegration provoked by complete social\nisolation. \nIf, as the arguments in subsection\n 3.2.\n and\n 3.3.\n indicate, some personal relationship goods are essential for survival\nand health and for developing autonomy, then they are also necessary\nin order to ensure the securing of various (human) rights. This at\nleast will be the case on the interest theory of rights (Brownlee\n2013, forthcoming): If rights protect powerful interests, and if we\nhave powerful interests in surviving, in opportunities to preserve our\nhealth, and to pursue our (reasonable) conception of life etc., then\nour social needs have to be met for our rights to be respected. She\nconcludes this is a reason to believe that we also have an even more\nurgent right to those personal relationship goods that are necessary\nin order to stay alive, remain healthy, develop, and have the physical\nand psychological conditions necessary to pursue any life plans. \nNote that the same logic could apply to a theory focused on\nindividuals’ entitlements to certain capabilities or\nfunctionings, rather than to a theory of human rights. Martha Nussbaum\n(2000; 2011: 33–34), for instance, believes that some of the\ncore capabilities to which we all have a claim of justice are\ncapabilities for affiliation and emotion. If, indeed, being affiliated\nand enjoying the capacity of forming attachments with others are preconditions for\nachieving other capabilities—such as bodily health, practical\nreasoning, or play—then the former are more basic. Similarly, on\none view (Wolff & de-Shalit 2007), some forms of advantage are\n“fertile”, in the sense that their achievement either\nconditions or makes more likely the achievement of other forms of\nadvantage. In this sense, personal relationship goods are\n“fertile”, provided that the above arguments concerning\ntheir instrumental value are correct. \nSeveral arguments support the conclusion that certain personal\nrelationship goods are akin to primary goods in the sense that John\nRawls gives to this term: that is, goods whose distribution is a\nconcern of justice. A first reason is that some personal relationship\ngoods are all-purpose: whatever else one may want, one will need these\ngoods in order to pursue one’s conception of a worthwhile life\n(Kittay 1999; Brake 2017; Cordelli 2015a, 2015b). \nAs Elizabeth Brake (2017) notes, not all goods that are necessary for\nthe pursuit of any life plan are properly conceived of as primary\ngoods:  \nbeing normally needed for the pursuit of plans of life and the\ndevelopment and exercise of the moral powers are necessary, not\nsufficient conditions, for inclusion on the list of primary goods.\nAfter all, oxygen, water, and food are ineliminable to survival, but\nthey are not included on the list of primary goods. (p. 138)  \nHowever, as she further notes, while individuals can buy various care\nservices, especially those concerning the meeting of material needs,\nthey cannot buy caring relationships. This means that the\nimplementation of just distributions of other goods cannot ensure that\nall individuals will have proper access to personal relationship\ngoods. Brake’s example is that of elderly individuals living\nalone, with little mobility and without any social relations, for whom\nno level of material wealth alone can provide adequate conditions for\nforging caring relationships. If we cannot obtain (opportunities to\nenjoy) personal relationship goods in exchange for money, and if these\ngoods are all-purpose goods, then there is a Rawlsian case for\nincluding them on the agenda of justice (Brake 2017). (Note that,\nunder certain conditions, this could also qualify oxygen and clean\nwater as primary goods.) \nSome philosophers (Brake 2017; Cordelli 2015a) claim that certain\npersonal relationship goods are akin to Rawlsian primary goods because\nthey are necessary to develop the two moral powers of persons: a sense\nof justice and the capacity for a conception of the good. If so, this\nis a second Rawlsian argument for them. It appears different from the\nargument in the previous section, since some goods may be all-purpose,\nyet not strictly necessary for developing the two moral powers (for\nexample, money). \nIn this sense, one way in which some personal relationships goods are\nrelevant is because of their role in self-formation and, more or less\ndirectly, in the acquisition of self-respect. Not only care ethicists\n(Held 1993), but also contemporary philosophers influenced by Hegel\nhave noted this; the latter elaborated on the Hegelian idea that we\ngain self-consciousness only through a process of mutual recognition.\nThis insight has been applied to various contexts. The child’s\nsubjectivity is shaped within her the relationship with her primary\ncare-givers—including her identity alongside various categories\nsuch as gender and her future (in)ability to relate to others as\nequals, in non-dominating ways (Benjamin 1988). Through relationships\nin which they receive other people’s recognition, individuals\ngain self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem (Honneth 1992,\n1995: ch. 5). If this is correct, and if the social bases of\nself-respect is a primary good—as Rawls (1971) definitely\nbelieved—this is another reason to think that access to some\npersonal relationship goods is a matter of justice. \nWithin analytical political philosophy, Brake (2017) noted that the\ngoods uniquely created by caring relationships are usually necessary\nat all stages of life in order to exercise the two moral\npowers. This is very likely, given their role in maintaining mental\nhealth; but perhaps even when personal relationship goods are not\nnecessary for mental health, they are required for maintaining as\nsense of justice and revising life plans, as suggested by Cordelli:\n \nmany relational resources should count as primary goods …\nbecause they secure those conditions of support, stability, and the\nself-confidence that foster the development and maintenance of the\nfirst moral power over time. Further, relational resources also play a\nrelevant role in helping individuals revise their life plans.\n(Cordelli 2015a: 97) \nIf they have the instrumental value attributed to them by the above\narguments, then it is plausible that universal enjoyment of personal\nrelationship goods is also necessary in order to ensure (fair)\nequality of opportunity. This is a third Rawlsian argument for being\nconcerned with their distribution. Some argue that a minimum of social\nresources are necessary for an individual to enjoy equal opportunities\n(Cordelli 2015b) and that\n“[s]ocial deprivation conflicts with equality of\nopportunity” (Brownlee 2013, 214). And some egalitarians noted that the quality of\npersonal, micro-interactions between parents and children are an\nimportant determinant of children’s future opportunities (Swift\n2003; Brighouse & Swift 2009, 2014); presumably, some of the\ninfluencing of future opportunities is due to the benefits in\nmotivation and self-confidence that come with being well loved and\nemotionally cared for by one’s parents. \nSome philosophers sympathetic to the aim of including personal\nrelationship goods on the agenda of justice deny that the principle of\nequal opportunities requires a distribution of these goods (other than\nchildcare):  \nAccess to social supports for caring relationships and some material\ncaregiving for adults are not protected by the principle of fair equal\nopportunity. (Brake 2017, 142)  \nShe illustrates this claim with the case of gay people who can have\nequal opportunities for advantageous jobs without having access to\nmarriage. It seems, however, that, if the arguments at\n 3.2\n are correct, some decent social contact that goes beyond occasional\nsocial interactions with strangers is necessary for mental health and\nhence also for equality of opportunity. Further, if the principle of\nfair equality of opportunity applies to all positions of advantage, it\nshould also apply to marriage. \nSome personal relationship goods have been said to be especially\nimportant, and possibly owed only to, children. Alternatively, some of\nthem may be owed to children in a more robust way than they are owed\nto adults—as outcomes to children and as mere opportunities to\nadults (Macleod 2010b; Lindblom 2018). Children can fully enjoy these\ngoods only if they are well cared for; and some of these\ngoods—discussed below—are themselves personal relationship\ngoods. \nDuring childhood, personal relationship goods are instrumental to the\ngood life of children in two ways: by allowing them to enjoy good\nhealth and pleasure during childhood and, due to their developmental\nrole, by contributing to their future adult flourishing, including\ntheir future ability to relate to others (Vaillant 2012). Because of\nthis double aspect, conflicts are in principle possible between\nallowing children to enjoy personal relationship goods in ways that\nmaximize childhood wellbeing versus allowing them to enjoy these goods\nin ways that optimize the wellbeing of the future adult (Hannan 2018).\nFor instance, it is possible that it is best for a child qua\nchild to enjoy as much time as possible in playful interaction with\nloving adults, while for the future adult it may be more\ninstrumentally valuable to use the time for honing competitive\nabilities. An interesting possibility, so far unexplored by normative\ntheorists, is that personal relationship goods are also of\ndevelopmental value for adults. Given that we are capable of some\ndegree of psychological development throughout our lives—or, in\nneurobiological terms, some degree of brain plasticity—it is\npossible that enjoying the goods of personal relationships can help\nfoster psychological development during adulthood. For the purpose of\nthis section, the assumption is that the goods discussed below are of\nparticularly high value to children thanks to their developmental\nrole, and that childhood is a period of life which is developmentally\nspecial, thus requiring that we pay special attention to developmental\ngoods. \nIt is undeniable that children have claims with respect to their\nwellbeing against adults—whether collectively or specifically\nagainst their parents—and many think these are claims of\njustice. Brighouse and Swift (2014) influentially defend the\ninstitution of the family by appeal to family relationship goods, many\nof which are relational: parental love, trustworthy and spontaneous\nintimacy and being subject to beneficial authority from an individual\nwho loves, knows and is responsible for the child. \nBeing part of a family relationship, and enjoying its goods is also\ngood for adults, and possibly part of the distribuenda of\njustice for both children and adults. Brighouse and Swift believe that\nadults’ entitlement is to an opportunity to enjoy family life,\nand it is conditional on them being adequate parents. For children,\npresumably, the entitlement to familial relationship goods is\nunconditional and it is to the actual outcomes rather than to mere\nopportunities. Brighouse and Swift make an exception for one of the\ngoods, namely love; they—like many other\nphilosophers—believe there cannot be a right to be loved. This\nissue deserves a separate discussion. \nOn one view (Liao 2006, 2015) children have a right to be loved on\ngrounds of the huge instrumental value that love has for childhood\nwellbeing and development. He claims that the empirical literature\nshows that children who lack love suffer in terms of physical health\nand development, learning ability, interest in interacting with the\nenvironment, ability to sleep and mental health. The right is said to\nbe held by each child primarily against her biological biological\nparents, but all of us have secondary duties to ensure that all\nchildren are loved. A similar claim, that love is irreplaceably\ninstrumental to children leading meaningful childhoods has been\nrecently endorsed (Ferracioli 2014) but also criticized (Grahle\n2016). \nThere are several objections to Liao’s thesis. The most\nprominent is that there cannot be rights without correlative duties,\nand there cannot be a duty to do what we cannot do; since we cannot\nfully control our love for particular persons, there cannot be a right\nto love (Cowden 2012b; Brighouse & Swift 2014). Against this\nobjection, (which he anticipates) Liao (2006) argues that we can do\nmore than it is commonly assumed in order to control our feelings of\nlove. However, as Brake (2011) noted, love is responsive to the\nqualities of the beloved—which are outside of the lover’s\ncontrol and which can change—and therefore there are important\nlimits to agent’s abilities to control their loving. This may be\nenough to show that there cannot be a duty to love. \nA different objection to the claim that children have a right to be\nloved is that, contra Liao’s interpretation, all that\nthe empirical literature shows is that children require certain\nparental behavior in order the thrive (Cowden 2012a, 339):  \nthe internal emotion of love is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nthe child’s best interests and does not constitute a primary\nessential condition for a good life.  \nIf so, then children have an interest, and possibly a right, only in\nthe behavioral aspects of love which, presumably are possible to\ncontrol. In addition, it may be impossible to measure the impact of\nlove as emotion, rather than as behavior, on children (Cowden 2012a,\n2012b). \nFinally, it is possible that some of the intrinsic value of love\nconsists in the confirmation, or maybe conferral, of value on the\nbeloved. This validation depends on the lover enjoying the beloved for\nher own (the lover’s) sake, independently from the lover’s\nwill (or duty) to enjoy her. In turn, this requires that the emotional\nresponse to the beloved is not fully controlled by the lover but\nconsists, at least in part, in a spontaneous reaction to the beloved\n(Gheaus 2017). In this case, too, there cannot be a duty (and hence a\nright) to be loved, because these would be incompatible with the full\nvalue of love. This is the reason why even a perfect love drug, one\ninducing all the subjective experiences and behaviors associated with\nlove, would not be capable of creating the same value that genuine\nlove creates (Nyholm 2015). \nChildren may have a right to non-parental emotional care received\nwithin enduring, robust, and protected relationships between children\nand adults who are not their parents (Gheaus 2011). Empirical\nliterature seems to indicate that some non-parental care in good\nchildrearing institutions often confers overall benefit to children\nolder than one (Waldfogel 2006). Additional grounds include the\nminimization of the risk of serious failures of care (such as abuse\nand neglect) and a more egalitarian redistribution of opportunities to\ngood care: If all children are exposed to various care-givers and\nstyles of childrearing, it will hopefully be easier for them to\novercome the effects of more minor failings of care (Gheaus 2011).\nFurther, by undermining the parental monopoly of care over children it\nwould diminish objectionable domination of the child (especially\nassuming that non-parental care benefits the child) (Gheaus 2011). \nIn particular, if children have long-term non-parental carers\nalongside with parents, they may have better chances to encounter\npeople able to love them. This consideration is particularly important\nif indeed there cannot be a duty to love. It is an interesting\nquestion whether any of the value of the parent-child bond would be\nlost if more than two people were emotionally and responsibly involved\nlong-term in the life of the child. The experience of living and\nloving in extended families and the general belief that the\nparent-child bond is no less valuable in families with many children\nthan in families with one or two children suggest a negative\nanswer. \nFor both children and adults, periods of solitude can be a condition\nfor a good life (as well as for fully enjoying relationships with\nothers). Unlike adults, children cannot decide to exit all\nrelationships; nor should they, provided they are subject to the\nlegitimate authority of guardians. Therefore they must rely on adults\nin order to have some protected time during which to be free from\nothers’ company if they chose so. Recently, it has been argued\nthat children greatly benefit from having a significant amount of\nunstructured time during which they can realize a number of\ngoods—such as play or creativity—to which they have\nunique, or privileged access (Macleod 2010b, 2014; Brighouse &\nSwift 2014; Brennan 2014; Gheaus 2015a, 2015b). It is possible that\noccasional voluntary solitude is necessary for the full enjoyment of\nsuch goods. The existence of the right will depend on how these goods\ncontribute to children’s wellbeing qua children, to\ntheir developmental interests, and—in cases of conflict between\nthe two—on how we ought to weight the child’s interest in\nwellbeing during childhood against her interest in future\nwellbeing. \nThere are several reasons to be concerned with the distribution of\npersonal relationship goods, yet there are also theoretical\ndifficulties with, and mere peculiarities about, putting these goods\non the agenda of distributive justice. \nPeople vary in the weight they give to personal relationship goods in\ntheir views of how to live, and different ways of distributing\npersonal relationship goods will inevitably reflect some, but not\nother, individuals’ conception of the good. There may be no\nneutral justification for particular ways of attempting to\ndistribute certain relationship goods—even if there are some\nneutral justifications for wanting to distribute some of them in the\nfirst place. To decide on any particular set of institutions, one\nwould need to know how to balance the distribution of a relationship\ngood against the distribution of another, or perhaps against the\ndistribution of non-relational goods. More generally, including\npersonal relationship goods amongst the primary goods will raise the\nindexing problem (Brake 2017) by making it difficult to establish who\nare the worse off without assigning relative weights to different\ngoods such as money and personal relationship goods. Doing this would\ninvolve some kind of perfectionism. \nAgainst this worry, Brake thinks that making caring relationships and\ntheir goods available to all “is relatively low cost and does\nnot interfere with implementing the existing principles” (Brake\n2017, 141), and, in particular, “it would not conflict with\ndistribution of income and wealth” (Brake 2017, 143). Yet, it is\nnot clear this would solve the indexing problem, since trade-offs will\nstill be needed. Moreover, funding institutions and programs to\nfacilitate access to personal relationship goods (of the kind\ndiscussed in\n section 4)\n could be costly, partly because caring relationships and the personal\nrelationship goods they provide take time, and time is expensive. The\nprovision of most personal relationship goods cannot happen without\npeople spending enough time together. For instance, providing parents,\nor adult children, with care breaks and flexible working hours is\ngoing to be expensive. \nAlso, supporting these relationships could take particular forms, each\nof which may reflect different conceptions of the good. Should we\nensure that people may work shorter hours in order to have more time\nfor their personal relationships, or should the state create good\ncaring institutions to try and meet children’s interests in\npersonal relationship goods outside the family, and possibly more\nefficiently? Adults who prefer to work (and earn) more will favor the\nlatter solution, while those who give more weight to personal\nrelationships will favor the former, and there may not be any neutral\njustification to prefer one solution over the other. Similarly, some\npeople will prefer that society be shaped such that the elderly have\nan opportunity to be cared for by their adult children, while others\nwill favor having opportunities to institutional care-giving, or\ncare-giving provided by strangers. In ideal circumstances, all these\npreferences could be equally accommodated—but if and when this\nis not possible, how to decide? \nOne possibility is to appeal to a Dworkinian hypothetical insurance\nscheme (Dworkin 2000) to establish a way of distributing personal\nrelationship goods without violating state neutrality (see Bou-Habib\n2013 for an application of this device to the question of individual\naccess to the material resources needed for child-rearing). For this\nwe should be able to determine what opportunities for personal\nrelationship goods would the average person chose for herself, under\nconditions of perfect information and rationality. \nSo far, the right principle for distributing personal relationship\ngoods has received little attention: views ranged from requiring equal\naccess to love and care (Lynch et al. 2009) to sufficient access to\nsocially decent relationships (Brownlee 2013, 2016a); or, perhaps “different\nprinciples govern the distribution of different relational\nopportunities” (Cordelli 2015a: 103). \nBrownlee thinks that, in order to respect the human right against\nsocial deprivation it is enough to have “minimal opportunities\nfor non-threatening, decent, or supportive social interaction”\n(Brownlee 2013, 206) rather\nthan relationships with friends or loved ones. She doubts that\nequality of social connection is valuable in itself; yet, the rich\narguments that she provides concerning the importance of personal\nrelationship goods suggest that justice requires more than the\nsecuring of the human right she advocates. And her worry that\nrequiring equality instead of sufficiency could lead to leveling down\ncan be assuaged by adopting a prioritarian principle. \nIn this context, it is important to know that sufficiency may ensure\nthe full benefits to which personal relationship goods are\ninstrumental: Some empirical research indicates that, while social\nisolation is a major risk factor, there is little or no variation\nacross moderate to high levels of social relationships (House\n2001). \nDoes the identification of the correct metric of justice bear on the\nthesis that justice requires the distribution of personal relationship\ngoods? According to Cordelli,  \nalthough it might be easier for welfarist or perfectionists to include\nrelational goods within their metric of justice, even those who adopt\na non-welfarist and non-perfectionist, resourcist metric have good\ninternal reasons to include (opportunities for) relational resources.\n(2015a: 89) \nTo judge this, it is useful to operate with the following distinction\n(Gheaus 2018): On the one hand, there is the question of the metric of\njustice, that is, what should we make sure people have a fair amount\nof. Examples include resources, (opportunities for) wellbeing and\ncapabilities. The correct metric of justice has been the subject of a\nlong, and not yet concluded, debate. On the other hand, one can be\nconcerned with the distribuenda of justice—that is,\nwhat should we make sure our institutions and policies make available\nto individuals in order to bring about a just distribution of the\nright metric of justice. Examples include money, rights, leisure time,\nand, possibly, opportunities for relationships. It is possible that\npeople who disagree about the correct metric of justice will—at\nleast occasionally—agree about the distribuenda. \nUnderstood as part of the distribuenda of justice, personal\nrelationship goods—and relationship goods in general—can\nplausibly be accommodated by different conceptions of the right metric\n(Gheaus 2018). Indeed, friendship has been presented as one amongst\nthe many resources to be distributed by justice (Cordelli 2015a) and\nsome see the ability to form and maintain caring, meaningful\nrelationships as a basic capability (Nussbaum 2000: 82–83). Good\nfamily relationships—including childrearing—have been\npresented as a main contributor to wellbeing for at least some\nindividuals (Arneson 2014). \nEven if personal relationship goods can be accommodated by any metric\nof justice, there is another serious objection to seeing them as the\nproper object of (re)distribution. Many egalitarians think that what\nmatters for realizing justice is equality of overall advantage, and\nthat losses of advantage in one area of life can be compensated by\nhigher levels of advantage in another. In this sense, they are\nholistic. If this is correct, it means that it could be just for some\npeople to enjoy hardly any (opportunities for) personal relationship\ngoods—beyond what they need for minimal functioning and\nautonomy—as long as they enjoy other goods more abundantly.\nRejecting holism will make it difficult for a theory to avoid being\n(perhaps, mildly) perfectionistic; at the same time, it seems very\ncounterintuitive that the unchosen lack of certain kinds of\ngoods—which likely include personal relationship\ngoods—from an individual’s life can be adequately\ncompensated for by any amount of other goods. \nOften, the goods that are the object of just distributions are\nrivalrous: money, health care etc. Some personal relationship goods do\nnot seem to be fully rivalrous: with respect to attention, friendship,\nor the emotions of love, it is not true that consumption by one\nindividual prevents simultaneous consumption by others. As Brownlee\nputs it:  \nIf each of us gives love to everyone and seeks love from everyone,\nit’s not the case that there will be an insufficient amount of\nlove to go around. (2016a: 71)  \nAt the same time, since everybody’s resources are finite, there\nare obvious limits to home many people can simultaneously enjoy a\nperson’s love, friendship, attention, company etc. The fact that\npersonal relationship goods are not fully rivalrous should, in\nprinciple, create a relative abundance that facilitates their\ndistribution, especially if the right principle of distribution is\nsufficiency rather than equality. \nSome believe that the duty to provide personal relationship goods is\nprimarily a responsibility of individuals, not of institutions,\nbecause  \n[i]f no one will take on the job of associating with a given person,\nthen that person’s social needs go unmet despite the presence of\nappropriate institutions. (Brownlee 2016a: 69)  \nIt is not obvious that this argument succeeds. We all have an obvious\nand powerful interest in many personal relationship\ngoods—especially in those that are necessary for survival,\nhealth and autonomy—any yet it is often unclear who is under the\nduty to satisfy the interest. So, the question is whether the\nexistence of a right requires a priorly specified duty and\nduty-bearer. Some (Cowden 2012a, b) assume a positive answer, while\nothers (Brighouse & Swift 2014; Brownlee 2013) believe this is not\nnecessary on an interest theory of rights. If rights are grounded in\npowerful interests that can be satisfied without imposing\ndisproportionate burdens on others, it is possible to identify them\nprior to having in place a system that allocates correlative duties to\nparticular individuals. \nAnother question is whether there can be any direct duties to offer\ncompany, affection or even love, or whether duties with respect to\nproviding these goods are in fact merely duties to create the\nconditions in which personal relationships can thrive. One of the\narguments discussed above with respect to a possible right to parental\nlove may generalize to all types of love—romantic, erotic,\nfriendship—and even to lesser kinds of affection. It is possible\nthat one of the psychological needs met by close relationships is that\nothers want us to be part of their lives for self-interested reasons.\nWhen some people want our company for their own sake, this is a\nconfirmation that we are important for their well-being (in some cases\nin a non-fungible way). This kind of validation is possible only if\nthe love, or affection, is not entirely given out of duty. Therefore,\nit seems that a duty to provide this particular personal relationship\ngood—the recognition that one is important for another\nperson’s wellbeing—would be self-defeating, because it\nwould be incompatible with some personal relationship goods having the\nfull the intrinsic value they have when given out of inclination.\nTherefore, it is possible that the reasons for offering love,\nfriendship, and even company may bear on the value of what is offered\nin a way in which the reasons for offering other kinds of goods do\nnot. It is possible that only love, friendship and company given out\nof certain reasons—having to do with the appreciation of the\nindividuality of the one to whom they are offered—will (fully)\ndo. (In contrast, the satisfaction of one’s interests in, say,\nnutrition, shelter or health care, are indifferent to the reasons why\nothers are providing these goods.) Perhaps the best solution to this\nworry is to admit that perfect distributive justice can only be\nrealized indirectly, when people go above and beyond their duty in\nproviding personal relationship goods (Gheaus 2017). \nBoth considerations above suggest that, when people’s powerful\ninterests in certain relationship goods generate duties, these are, in\nthe first instance, collective duties to provide the conditions in\nwhich the kinds of relationships that generate these duties can\nflourish. As the next section shows, there are many policies and\ninstitutions that, individually or together, can achieve this\ngoal. \nThere are obvious problems of implementing requirements of justice\nwith respect to (opportunities for) personal relationship goods that\nhave to do with both the feasibility and the desirability of various\nimplementation methods. It seems important to draw a distinction\nbetween how feasible it is to enforce duties corresponding to the\nright to enjoy personal relationship goods, and how desirable it is to\nenforce the duties in particular circumstances. Some (Cowden 2012b)\nrun the two considerations together, while others (Brownlee 2013)\ndistinguish them. \nFor instance, it may be undesirable to enforce a duty to provide\npersonal relationship goods because we lack a legitimate way of doing\nit—we do not know how to enforce the duty without violating some\nrights. As some have noted (Collins 2013), duties to associate with\nothers in adult personal relationships limits freedom of association;\nbut perhaps freedom of association is much more restrictive in nature\nand scope than we tend to think (Brownlee forthcoming). \nIf a person has a right to a certain good, this means that if the\nright is violated she is owed compensation. But, in some cases, the\nloss cannot be compensated because certain goods have significant and\nunique non-instrumental value. At least some personal relationship\ngoods—such as love and friendship—are like this (Gheaus\n2009). The loss of other personal relationship goods seems impossible\nto compensate due to their instrumental value to survival, functioning\nand autonomy. Even if emotional care for children, or decent social\ninteraction amongst adults, had only instrumental value, if it is true\nthat these goods are necessary for minimally good health, their\nabsence cannot be compensated. \nThe impossibility of compensation may be relevant for the importance\nof protecting the any rights to personal relationship goods—like\nin the case of the right to life. It may count as an argument that it\nis more urgent to provide (opportunities to) personal relationship\ngoods than other goods to the provision of which we have a right. \nA topic so far not discussed by philosophers is that of the fair\ndistribution of the bads of personal relationship goods. We are,\nneuro-biologically, prone to connect to other people, but relationship\noften go badly, creating bads as well as goods—especially when\npeople’s attachments to others are dysfunctional (Bowlby 1968,\n1973, 1980). In particular, bad relationships early in life—with\nparents and parental figures—can make people unable to form and\nmaintain healthy relationships, and this generates relationship bads.\nPsychological evidence indicates that insecure attachment and the\nensuing relationship dysfunctions is inter-generationally transmitted\n(Jones et al. 2015). Whose obligation is it to address the possible\nunfairness that some people, out of no fault or choice of their own,\nhave to shoulder a much larger share of relationship bads than others?\nObviously, we cannot directly distribute relationship bads. And it is\nnot obvious how we could legitimately restrict childrearing to prevent\nthe creation of any such bads, as some of the philosophical literature\non licensing parents suggests (see the discussion in 6.2). Maybe\njustice requires that we share the costs of helping people to overcome\nbad relationship dynamics—for instance through psychotherapy and\ncounseling? This, however, will lead to a fair redistribution only if\nit leaves everybody having (equally good) relationships. If not, it\nwill only be an improvement in the quality of relationships. Such\nimprovement seems desirable, in spite of possible distributional\ncomplaints; this is likely to be an area where leveling down is,\nall-things-considered, undesirable. \nPhilosophers working on justice in childrearing, marriage, and the\nethics of care suggest or defend several institutions and policies\nthat could promote a fair distribution of personal relationship\ngoods. \nThere is general agreement that states cannot distribute personal\nrelationship goods—or the relationships that generate\nthem—directly, but it can shape society in numerous ways that\nwould affect both the existence and the distribution of these goods\n(Brake 2017; Cordelli 2015a). More specifically, policies and\ninstitutions—including social norms—can enable people to\nmeet other people in conditions that make them more likely to relate\nto them in personal ways, encourage people to voluntarily enter\npersonal relationships and influence people’s internal resources\nand abilities to have good relationships (Cordelli 2015a). \nCare ethicists who believe that care-giving should be treated as a\nprimary good advocate the creation of social safety networks to\nsupport care-givers and make sure that, by performing the\ntime-intensive work of care, they do not end up socially disadvantaged\n(Kittay 1999). One view is that we ought to socially support\ncare-giving through a restructuring of economies, such that all\nindividuals have access to jobs remunerated well enough to allow them\nto care for themselves and their dependents (Engster 2007; Cordelli\n2015a) and, moreover, that jobs should not systematically interfere\nwith workers’ ability to care, and that governments should\nensure enough caring services (Engster 2007). \nBut more specific measures have also been proposed in order to ensure\nthat all individuals have access to personal relationships and their\ngoods—including caring relationships. Most generally, states\ncould educate citizens to be competent care-givers (Brake 2017) and\neven target boys as future care-givers (Behrends & Schouten 2017).\nMore generally, states could inculcate sociability through education\n(Cordelli 2015a). Further, states could support the civil society by\nencouraging volunteering and educational organizations (Cordelli\n2015a), for example by using tax-incentives to encourage engagement in\nvoluntary associations—this could mean the provision of each\ncitizen with a voucher or tax-credit to be spent in support of\nqualifying associations that produce personal relationship goods\n(Cordelli 2015a). Also, states could create, run and subsidize\ncultural centers and social clubs (Brake 2017). They could also design\npublic spaces such that people have ample opportunities to socialize\non playgrounds, parks and other public spaces (Brake 2017; Brownlee\n2016a). \nBrake (2010, 2012) defends a radically reformed institution of\nmarriage, justified by reference to the goods created by caring\nrelationships between spouses, but which would allow individuals to\nde-bundle these goods and spread them across several relationships.\nCurrently, spouses can confer various advantages—including\nrelational advantages—on each other, but the institution of\nmarriage restrict access to these advantages by organizing them around\nmonogamous sexuality. If marriage were to be minimal, that is if\npeople could associate with each other for the sake of forming caring\n(and not necessarily sexual) relationships, and also to choose the\nnumber of partners and the kind of relational goods at the center of\ntheir union, this would give them more ample and fair opportunities to\nform and protect their caring relationships. \nBrownlee (2013, forthcoming) advocates a reform of the punishment and\nmedical care institutions to avoid long-term isolation whenever\npossible, in order to ensure that prisoners’ and patients’\nright against social deprivation is not violated. Quarantine, she\nthinks, should only be used when strictly necessary, and even then\nindividuals should be enabled to remain in touch with their near and\ndear with the help of technology; and particular individuals (such as\nparents) ought to be allowed to take more risks than they currently\nmay for the sake of avoiding separation from their children. She also\nargues that the practice of punishing through solitary confinement\nshould be abolished. \nFinally, several philosophers defended the proposal that states should\nensure everybody’s access to caring relationships (which,\npresumably, includes access to some personal relationship goods) by\nrequiring all citizens to spend some time caring for those in need.\nThis policy could mean the creation of a “care corps”\nservice based on conscription (Bubeck 1999; Fabre 2006; Robeyns 2011)\nor voluntary, state-incentivized, participation (Brake 2017).\nDepending on how such a service would be set up, it could encourage\nthe formation of robust, long-term personal relationships—for\ninstance, by enabling continuity in care between the care-givers and\nthose in need for care. Yet, if there cannot be a duty to love, this\nproposal could only work for some, but not all personal relationship\ngoods. \nAs mentioned above, due to personal histories that go back to their\nchildhood, many people fail to enjoy personal relationship goods\naltogether (when they are unable to enter or maintain relationships)\nor else disproportionately struggle with the bads of personal\nrelationships. To the extent to which they are not responsible for\nthis situation, there is a case for arguing that they are entitled to\nsubsidized programs—such as counseling or therapy—to\nremedy their inability to relate to others in healthy ways. \nSome proposals have to do specifically with enabling adults to enjoy\nthe personal relationship goods that families make available. Richard\nArneson (2014) argues that non-parents ought to subsidize parents in\norder to ensure that the less well-off parents—who would\notherwise need to spend most of their time in payed jobs—have\naccess to the meaningful work of childrearing. \nChildren have the strongest case for an entitlement to certain\npersonal relational goods, within ongoing caring relationships, on the\ndouble ground that they are being owed the goods for their wellbeing\nqua children and for the sake of the developmental importance\nof the goods. One of the developmental reasons is to enable the future\nadults to secure personal relationship goods for themselves (Brighouse\n& Swift 2014; Brownlee 2016a). \nAs in the general case, a variety of state measures can ensure a fair\nprovision of personal relationship goods to children. Most basically\nperhaps, the elimination of child poverty—which, in practice\nwould mean the elimination of poverty in general—is needed in\norder to allow all parents to parent well (Brighouse & Swift\n2014). \nFurther, states can and should be held accountable for ensuring that\nchildren have adequate parents or parental figures (Ferracioli 2014).\nThe fair provision of personal relationship goods for children may\nstart with regulating procreation. Lisa Cassidy argues that those\npeople who do not expect to make good parents have a duty to abstain\nfrom having children (Cassidy 2006), and several philosophers argues\nthat people who decide to have children are under a duty to adopt\ninstead of bringing new ones into existence (Friedrich 2013; Collins\n2013; Rulli 2016). Nobody, to the best of my knowledge, argues in\nfavor of enforcing these duties via state policy. A milder,\nand in some conditions possibly justified, approach would be for\nstates to nudge prospective adequate parents to adopt rather than\nprocreate. Another way of curtailing the kind of procreation that\nresults in some children lacking due access to personal relationship\ngoods would be the introduction of parental licenses. Licensing\nprocreators would require those who fail to obtain them to refrain\nfrom procreating. It is however difficult to see what legitimate means\nof enforcing such licenses exist (Engster 2010; De Wispelaere &\nWeinstock 2012). \nWhile it is hard to find legitimate ways to regulate\nprocreation—although perhaps we should not stop searching for\nsolutions—the situation is a bit more hopeful with respect to\nregulating in order to ensure better parenting and, more generally,\nbetter child-rearing. On the first count, there is a convincing case\nfor licensing biological parents (LaFollette 2010) although\nimplementation is difficult. But a bundle of second-best policies\ninclude the introducing of parenting classes, perhaps mandatory (Cutas\n& Bortolotti 2010; De Wispelaere & Weinstock 2012) and the\nencouragement of fathers to take up parental leave in order to be\ninvolved in childcare from the start. \nBeyond improving parental care, states have also been said to have a\nduty to create robust, state-subsidized and mandatory institutional\ncare to complement parental care, with the aim of containing abuse and\nneglect care and giving more children the opportunity to enjoy\npersonal relationship goods (Gheaus 2011). States could also make sure\nthat all schools put the intrinsic goods of justice on their curricula\n(Macleod 2018), including any such goods that are relational in\nnature—for instance, by adding counseling and guidance functions\nto the academic function of schools. Finally, the parents of a growing\nnumber of children world-wide engage in long-term migration. These\nchildren spend a significant time of their childhoods physically\nseparated from their parents and without good alternative parental\nfigures. One remedial solution would be for states to use some of the\nremittances sent by migrant parents in order to organize counseling\nand emotional support for the children left behind (Gheaus 2013). \nSome policies that have been proposed for other reasons may, as a\nside-effect, also ensure that more children enjoy the personal\nrelationship goods they are owed. Such is Arneson’s (2014)\nproposal discussed in the previous subsection; Gina Schouten’s\n(2015) suggestion that states support gender justice by subsidizing\nparental leaves, care breaks for parents and good quality childcare\ninstitutions; and, possibly, Anne Alstott’s (2004) suggestion\nthat states help parents to honor the demanding, non-exit demand of\nparenting through financial support.","contact.mail":"anca.gheaus@upf.edu","contact.domain":"upf.edu"}]
