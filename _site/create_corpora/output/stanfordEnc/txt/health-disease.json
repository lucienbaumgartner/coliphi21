For instance, any\nattempt to educate physicians or regulate heath insurance must employ\nsome standards that can be used to assess whether people are ill or\nnot. Concepts of health and disease also connect in interesting ways\nwith issues about function and explanation in philosophy of the\nbiomedical sciences, and theories of well-being in ethics.\n\nDoctors are called on to deal with many states of affairs. Not all of\nthem, on any theory, are diseases. A doctor who prescribes\ncontraceptives or performs an abortion, for example, is not treating a\ndisease. Some women cannot risk pregnancy for health reasons, and\nhistorically both pregnancy and childbirth have been major killers.\nNevertheless,they are not disease states, and modern women typically\nuse contraception or abortion in the service of autonomy and control\nover their lives. In addition, it is very difficult to find a\nphilosophically or scientifically interesting cleavage between\ndiseases and other complaints (Reznek 1987, 71–73). \nOne dominant strand in modern medicine sees a disease as essentially a\nprocess that recurs across individuals in slightly different forms: a\ndisease is an abstract kind that is realized in different ways (Carter\n2003: Whitbeck 1977). But since a disease is a biological insult,\ndistinguishing it from injury is very difficult. Perhaps injuries are\nnot processes in the relevant sense but events. This essay assumes\nthat the conceptual issues raised by illnesses, injuries and other\nmedical conditions are similar enough to let us put this demarcation\nproblem aside. Disability is another important and neglected topic in\nhealth and well-being. It will be addressed here only slightly, since\nthe contemporary debates on disease and disability tend to go on in\nisolation from each other. Only rarely do authors such as Glackin\n(2010) tackle both. It is worth noting, though, that the disability\ndebate is typically framed in a way that closely resembles the debate\nover disease. Medical model adherents judge disability to be the\nproduct of a functional impairment or failure in human physiology.\nThis resembles what will be called below the naturalistic model of\ndisease, at least as regards assessment of bodily impairment. It\ncontends that people with disabilities, like people with diseases, are\nrendered worse off in virtue of these functional impairments, and the\nexplanatory burden of their disadvantage is borne chiefly by the\nfailure of their physiology or psychology to perform a natural\nfunction. A concept of disability as dysfunction has been resisted by\nrival pictures of disability that have made headway in recent\ndecades. \nAccording to the rival “social model”, disability is not a\ndeparture from normal or healthy human functioning which makes an\natypical condition a “bad difference” from the norm;\nrather it is a “mere difference” (Barnes 2016). Although\ndisabilities may make people worse off in general, this is due to the\nway society is set up, rather than any physical impairment. Disability\nin itself is just variation, analogous to features like sexuality,\ngender and race. The social model was pushed by disability activists\nwho defined disability as “the disadvantage or restriction of\nactivity caused by a contemporary social organisation which takes\nlittle or no account of people who have physical impairments and thus\nexcludes them from participation in the mainstream of social\nactivities” (UPIAS 1975, quoted in Shakespeare 2010). The\nscientific basis for this position appeals to the idea that “the\npartitioning of human variation into the normal versus the abnormal\nhas no firmer footing than the partitioning into races. Diversity of\nfunction is a fact of biology” (Amundson 2000, p. 34). The\nresulting partition, it is held, is a reflection of social norms\nrather than underlying physical impairments. This position resembles\nwhat will here be termed the constructivist position with regard to\nhealth. \nHealth has received less philosophical attention than disease, and\nthis essay will correspondingly have less to say about it. The\nconceptual terrain in the case of health is a little more complex than\nthat of disease; one way of thinking about health says that it is just\nthe absence of disease, so if disease is biological malfunction or\nabnormality, it follows that a healthy person is someone whose\nbiological systems are all in order. But another way of looking at\nhealth insists that it is not just the absence of disease but the\npresence of something more; a positive state. The constitution of the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) defines health “a state of\ncomplete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the\nabsence of disease or infirmity” (WHO 1948). According to views\nlike this, we should think in terms not of health and disease alone,\nbut in terms of health, disease and normality. This essay will look at\ntheories of health after first discussing disease. The focus\nthroughout is on individuals, although some theorists (e.g. Inkpen\n2019) have argued for a seeing humans and their associated microbiomes\nas part of an ecosystem that can be evaluated, like other ecosystems,\nas healthy or not.  \nThe tendency in recent philosophy has been to see disease concepts as\ninvolving empirical judgments about human physiology and normative\njudgments about human behavior or well-being (Bloomfield 2001, Boorse\n1975, Ereshefsky 2009, Culver and Gert 1982, Thagard 1999). First, we\nhave beliefs about the natural functioning of humans – both our\ncommon sense expectations about the body and scientific theories of\nhuman biology. Second, we make judgments about whether some particular\ncondition or way of life is or is not undesirable, in some relevant\nway. This second set of concerns obviously involves normative\ncriteria, to do with the extent to which a life is unnatural,\nundesirable or failing to flourish in some way. (There is not a clear\nconsensus among writers here.) One important and controversial\nquestion is whether the judgments we make concerning our biology are\nalso normative in some way. A further large question concerns the\nrelationship between the two types of judgments, in both medicine and\ncommon sense. \nAnother strain in recent scholarship suggests that our normative\njudgments alone determine who falls under the concepts of health and\ndisease. This view has been less influential in philosophy, but\ncommands widespread adherence in other areas of the humanities and\nsocial sciences (e.g. Kennedy 1983, Brown 1990). Kitcher (1997,\n208–9) summarizes the debate as follows: \nKitcher’s objectivism is nowadays more often called naturalism, and\nthat usage is followed here. The simple naturalist/constructivist\nopposition has also been complicated by more recent work and some of\nthose nuances will be introduced here. The next section starts with\nforms of constructivism and the difficulties they face. Then\nnaturalism will be similarly treated, before the discussion moves to\nhealth. \nKitcher’s claim that an objectivist analysis, as he puts it, is\n“grounded” on facts about the human body is perhaps not as\nclear as it might be. Before arriving at some qualifications, then, we\nshould have straightforward statements of naturalism and\nconstructivism in hand. (Although, since the qualifications are not\nyet in place, perhaps no theorist would fully endorse these bald\nversions of the positions.) There are also taxonomies that cut finer.\nBroadbent (2019, p.93) argues that naturalism and normativism are only\ntwo of the distinctions we need to inform the debate. He thinks of\nthem as “diagonal opposites on a 2×2 matrix of possible\npositions, being Value-Independent Realism and Value-Dependent\nAnti-Realism respectively.” Broadbent also recognizes\nValue-Dependent Realism and his own Value-Independent Anti-Realism.\nWhether or not constructivist analyses should really be seen as\nanti-realist in a metaphysical sense is not always clear, though. For\nreasons outlines below, the philosophical commitments of\nconstructivist views are sometimes hard to grasp. \nAt the bottom of the naturalist conception of disease (most\ninfluentially stated by Boorse (1975) and defended in Boorse (1997,\n2014) is that the human body comprises organ systems that have natural\nfunctions from which they can depart in many ways. Some of these\ndepartures from normal functioning are harmless or beneficial, but\nothers are not. The latter are ‘diseases’. So to call\nsomething a disease involves both a claim about the abnormal\nfunctioning of some bodily system and a judgment that the resulting\nabnormality is a bad one. Boorse uses‘illness’ to describe\nthe concept of a disease that causes one’s life to deteriorate. This\nlanguage is not universal, but the distinction between bodily\nmalfunction and normative judgement is widely used. Naturalists\ncontend that the determination of bodily malfunction is an objective\nmatter to be determined by science. They may also argue (Boorse 1997)\nthat determining whether a malfunction is detrimental to human\nwell-being is also an objective matter, but often they concede that\nnormative considerations are the basis for that judgment. So the\nnaturalist position is that a disease is a bodily malfunction that\ncauses one’s well-being to lessen. This malfunction could take many\nforms: it is not a necessary part of the naturalist case that diseases\nconstitute a natural kind. \nRather, they could be a set of naturally occurring processes that are\nheld together in virtue of our interest in grouping them as a class.\nKinds that work like this include “weed” or\n“vermin” (Murphy 2006): the existence of the superordinate\nclass depends on human interests but the subordinate members are\nnatural kinds whose natures can be investigated scientifically. \nConstructivism, however, argues that human interests do not just\ndefine the superordinate class of diseases. It is human interests, not\nbiological malfunctions, that explain the judgments that subordinate\nmembers have the relevant biological character. Although\nconstructivists accept that disease categories refer to known or\nunknown biological processes they deny that these processes can be\nidentified independently of human values by, for example, a science of\nnormal human nature. Constructivist conceptions of disease are\nnormative through and through, although the precise account of the\nrelevant norms will vary between scholars. Analytically, it seems that\nconstructivism is distinct from the claim that disease is normative.\nHowever, constructivism and normativism do go together. One reason for\nthis often a professed skepticism about the existence of a\nnon-normative concept of malfunction. More broadly, constructivists\nmay think of disease labels as instruments of social control and\nreflections of biologically ungrounded reactions to human difference.\nThere may also exist, though this is less often brought to the fore,\nimportantly different stresses on the kinds of value judgements that\ndifferent theorists think are part of disease categories and their\napplication. Typically, the relevant normative claim is taken to apply\nto the life of the person whose health is under discussion – it is bad\nfor you to be that way. But in some contested cases the judgments are\noften held to be wider value-disvalue claims about society more\nbroadly – it is bad for us if you are that way. To make things even\nmore complicated, theorists will sometimes hold that the second type\nof judgement is what is really doing the work, but it masquerades as\nthe first type. Arguments about disease concepts, as we shall see, are\noften bound up with political and social controversies in which\ndiagnostic labels are impugned as instruments of oppression or social\ncontrol.  \nThe key constructivist contention, as seen in the remark by Amundson\nquoted above, is that there is no natural, objectively definable set\nof human malfunctions that cause disease. Rather, constructivists\nassert that to call a condition a disease is to make a judgment that\nsomeone in that condition is undergoing a specific kind of harm that\nwe explain in terms of bodily processes. But the bodily processes are\nnot objectively malfunctioning; rather, they are merely judged by us\nto be unusual or abnormal because they depart from some shared,\nusually culturally specific, conception of human nature. The crucial\ndifference between the positions then is that for naturalists,\ndiseases are objectively malfunctioning biological processes that\ncause harms. For constructivists, diseases are harms that we blame on\nsome biological process because it causes the harm, not because it is\nobjectively dysfunctional. \nHowever, constructivism is hard to define satisfactorily, for two\nreasons. First, its core claim is a denial of the naturalist thesis\nthat disease necessarily involves bodily malfunction. Since there are\nmany views one might hold about the nature of the biological processes\ninvolved in disease that are compatible with the denial of\nmalfunction, the positive constructivist claim varies across theories\nand is often elusive. Reznek (1987) for example, explicitly denies\nthat malfunction is a necessary condition for disease. He does assert\n(ch 9) that diseases involve “abnormal” bodily processes,\nbut he does not say what that means. Constructivists often, as we will\nsee later, argue that disease judgments appeal to biological processes\nthat are to be understood in terms of human practices rather than\nmembership in some putatively biologically definable class of\nabnormalities or malfunctions. We have decided that some harmful\nconditions are the province of the medical profession, and those are\ndiseases. \nThat brings up the second reason why constructivism can be an elusive\ntarget: it has often rested on (perfectly reasonable) claims about the\nrole that value judgments have played in medical practice, or on the\nprevalence of culturally specific disagreements about abnormal human\nbehavior or physiology. This means, as we shall see, that\nconstructivists, especially in the social sciences, do not tend to\noffer necessary and sufficient conditions. Rather, they often seek to\nreconstruct the concept of disease as revealed by our practices.\nConstructivism, therefore, often looks like a thesis about how inquiry\nis carried on: first we identify a condition we disvalue, then we look\nfor a biological process that causes it and say that, whatever it is,\nit is abnormal. This stress on our practices is a common\nconstructivist trope, whereas objectivists more often seek to analyse\na concept that will clarify what disease really is, however fumbling\nand biased our attempts to uncover it may have been. \nThat both medical practice and lay thought shape disease concepts is\nundeniable. Because of this, we need to introduce a second\ndistinction. Both naturalism and constructivism can take either a\nrevisionist or a conservative form. A conservative view says that our\nfolk concept of illness should constrain a theoretical picture of\nhealth and disease worked out by scientists and clinicians. A\nrevisionist thinks that our existing concepts should be amended in the\nlight of what inquiry uncovers. One could be a conservative or\nrevisionist naturalist, as well as a conservative or revisionist\nconstructivist. \nHealth and disease, like many other concepts, are neither purely\nscientific nor exclusively a part of common sense. They have a home in\nboth scientific theories and everyday thought. That raises a problem\nfor any philosophical account: suppose we try to say what health and\ndisease really amount to, from which it follows that the scientific\nconcept should fit the facts about world. If the picture we end up\nwith deviates too far from folk thought, should we worry? You might\nthink that everyday language puts constraints on a concept of health\nthat need to respected, and that if we move too far from ordinary\nusage we have stopped talking about health and started talking about\nsomething else. Furthermore, it is not really possible to argue that\nscientific and vernacular uses of the concepts are fully independent,\nsince the development of science influences everyday thought, and many\nscientific concepts begin in pre-scientific contexts and carry the\nmarks of those origins deep into their careers. \nAlthough there is a thriving body of work that tries to analyse the\nconcept of disease – as we’ll see in a moment – other\ntheorists dispute the prospects for a successful analysis of the\nconcept of disease. Schwartz (2007) contends that the biomedical\nsciences do not share a general concept of disease that is coherent\nenough to be analyzed. He recommends seeing the proposed analyses as\nintroducing new concepts of disease that are related to existing usage\nbut not bound by it. Concepts so introduced may work in some contexts\nbut not others, and different concepts of disease could be needed for\ndifferent medical purposes. Hesslow (1993) argues that diseases are\nnot interesting theoretical entities in medicine and are irrelevant to\nmost clinical decisions. These focus on how to improve a patient’s\ncondition and do not need to depend on a judgment of disease. \nFurthermore, the concept of disease that is currently employed in most\nareas of medicine has undergone a process of development. For much of\nthe modern era there has been a dialectic between two concepts of\ndisease. On the one hand, there has been the idea that a disease is\njust an observable suite of symptoms with a predictable course\nunfolding. This notion dates back to Sydenham in the late seventeenth\ncentury. Kraepelin applied it to psychiatry as the basis for\ndifferential diagnosis, for example between subtypes of what was later\ncalled schizophrenia (1899, 173–175). The approach was\nsupplanted as medicine matured by the concept of diseases as\ndestructive processes in bodily organs which “divert part of the\nsubstance of the individual from the actions which are natural to the\nspecies to another kind of action” (Snow 1853, 155; for\ndiscussion see Whitbeck 1977, Carter 2003, Broome 2006). This is\nperhaps still the core medical conception of disease. It seeks\nexplanations that cite pathological processes in bodily systems. More\nrecent medicine has tended to weaken this slightly by adopting what\nGreen (2007, ch, 2) calls an ‘actuarial’ model of disease.\nThis model takes the presence of elevated risk, for example as\nindicated by high blood pressure, to be a disease even in the absence\nof overt symptoms or a clearly destructive pathological process (see\nalso Plutynski 2018, ch. 2). \nMedicine recognizes illnesses like hypertension and Cushing’s disease\nthat are the outcome of systems in a poorly regulated state that is\nstable, albeit suboptimal. The idea of a specific pathogenic process\nin medicine includes dysregulation, but this may not accord with folk\nthought. \nModern medicine looks naturalistic about disease. One question, then,\nconcerns the extent to which common sense and biomedical concepts are\nrelated. Perhaps both have naturalist commitments, or perhaps common\nsense is driven by values and medicine is not, or perhaps physicians\nare really constructivists who are self-deceived or arguing in bad\nfaith. \nThere is little reason to expect scientific and common sense concepts\nto agree in general, so if medicine and everyday thought disagree\nabout disease, we may ask which concept should be adopted. If we wish\nto distil a concept that can play a role in medical inquiry, we may\nside with the scientists. But such proposals, which argue for a sharp\nseparation between scientific and folk uses, are not neutral pieces of\nobservation about the language. They are proposals for purging science\nfrom commonsense constraints that hinder its development. A\nrevisionist view of this sort, in this case, says that our concepts of\nhealth and disease might be a necessary starting point but should not\nconstrain where the inquiry ends up. Other forms of revisionism are\npossible. A revisionist naturalist argues that we should follow the\nscience where it takes us and come up with concepts that further\nscientific inquiry, for example, even if that means that we eventually\nuse the language in ways that look bizarre from the standpoint of\ncurrent common sense. But a revisionist constructivist could argue\nthat our thought, whether medical or lay, should be reformed in the\nservice of other goals, such as emancipation for hitherto oppressed\ngroups. Such revisionist thought was important in overturning the\npsychiatric view, dominant until the 1970s, that homosexuality is a\nmental illness. Activists argued that homosexuality was diagnosed for\noffensive moral reasons and not for medical ones and the\nclassification of homosexuality as a disease was changed as a result\nof lobbying on moral grounds rather than on the basis of any new\ndiscovery. Naturalists will respond that this was not an example of\nusing constructivism for emancipatory ends, but of bringing\npsychiatrists to understand that they were not obeying their own\nnaturalist principles about mental disorder, and showing them that\nthere was no good reason to retain the diagnosis. Much debate between\nnaturalists and constructivists involves competing histories in just\nthis way. Constructivists strive to uncover the role that moral and\nsocial values have always played in medical diagnosis and argue that\nour disease categories are hence not properly naturalistic.\nNaturalists, though they must concede that many diagnoses have been\nbased on moral values that we would now renounce, still insist that\nthe concept of disease, when correctly applied, as it often is, is\nthoroughly naturalistic and not impugned by past failures by the\nmedical profession to live up to its own scientific ambitions. \nNaturalists tend towards conceptual conservatism. They typically\nappeal to our intuitions about illness as support for their own\nemphasis on underlying bodily malfunction. This assumes that our\ncurrent concept is in good shape, that common sense and medicine share\na concept of disease, and that medicine should respect lay intuitions\nabout what is or is not a disease. Like many philosophers who think\nabout other concepts with both scientific and common sense uses,\nconservative naturalists about disease think that folk concepts\nspecify what counts as health and disease. The job of medicine is to\nlook at the world and see if anything in nature falls under the\nconcept as revealed by analysis (cf the “Canberra plan” of\nJackson 1998) For revisionists, this understanding of common sense in\nits relation to science is needlessly submissive to folk intuitions. A\nmore revisionist view takes the relevant concepts to be defined by\ntheir role in scientific theories – Boorse (1997) has argued\nthat disease is a term of art in pathology. \nRevisionist naturalists argue that facts about physiological and\npsychological functioning, like other biological facts, obtain\nindependently of human conceptions of the world. Our intuitions might\ntell us that a condition is not a disease. But scientific inquiry\nmight conclude that people with the condition are really suffering\nfrom a biological malfunction. In that case, a conservative would\nrecommend finessing the analysis to ensure that the concept of disease\ndoes not cover this case. A revisionist would say that we must bite\nthe bullet and judge that this case falls under the concept even if\nthat judgment is counterintuitive. A revisionist naturalist regards\nhealth and disease as features of the world to be discovered by\nbiomedical investigation, and therefore loosely constrained, at best,\nby our everyday concepts of health and disease. Lemoine (2013) argues\nthat conceptual analysis always involves a stipulative element\nconcerning controversial or borderline cases. Because contending\nparties will be led by their intuitions to see different stipulations\nas reasonable, conceptual analysis will be very unlikely to decide\nbetween competing analyses that are all reasonably successful at\ncapturing core cases. He suggests that instead philosophers should aim\nto naturalize disease by trying to first understand general features\nof theories in the medical sciences and then looking for perspicuous\nand coherent accounts of different disease types, with a view to\neventually establishing an overall picture of the role disease\nthinking plays in medicine. This approach treats diseases as putative\nnatural kinds and could be highly revisionist, while also leaving open\nthe possibility that some diagnoses represent contingent historical\noutcomes that have left us with an incoherent category. Fuller (2018)\nfollows Lemoine in dissenting from traditional conceptual analyses. He\nargues that we should try to work out what kinds of things diseases\nare rather than worrying about the concept. Fuller reviews the\nontological options and asks first about instances of disease –\nwhat kinds of things are they? – rather than the concept, but,\nlooking at chronic disease, he goes ‘bottom-up’, by\nattempting to work out what instances of chronic disease have in\ncommon and making inductive generalizations about them. Fuller thinks\nof diseases – at least chronic ones but perhaps acute cases too\n– as dispositions (cf Hucklenbroich (2014).  \nLange (2007) starts his account of disease from a similar impulse,\ninsisting that diseases play an absolutely essential role in\nexplaining a patient’s symptoms. He argues that this explanatory role\nis characteristic of natural kinds elsewhere in science, and warrants\nthinking of diseases as natural kinds. Lange views diseases as natural\nkinds of incapacities. Stegenga (2018, ch.2.5), discussing Lange’s\nurging that we dissolve broader disease categories in favour of\nfiner-grained biological descriptions, argues that we should see this\nas an eliminativist position, since it dispenses with the concept of\ndisease altogether and replaces it with diverse successor concepts.\nAny theory of disease could advocate for descriptions at finer grains,\nwhile retaining a broad category, as Stegenga says, for education and\npublic communication even if it has no real scientific application.\nThe extent to which we should see a theoretical reform as\neliminativist or merely very revisionist is hard to answer. In both\ncases we might secure an epistemic advance, but one might worry that\nour new vocabularies will deprive people of their ability to\nunderstand themselves by replacing a familiar vocabulary with a\nremote, scientific one tailored to the demands of experts.  \nConstructivists are usually revisionists. They tend to say that\nconcepts of health and disease medicalize behavior that breaks norms\nor fails in some way to accord with our values; we don’t like pain, so\npainful states count as diseases: we don’t like fat people or drunks,\nso obesity and alcoholism count as diseases. Constructivists will\noften make this case with special vigor when it comes to mental\ndisorder. The critique of the concepts that guide disease applications\nis central to constructivism.  \nConstructivists are often social scientists and their interests may\nnot map neatly on to philosophical concerns. They are not usually\ninterested in conceptual analysis so much as in tracing the social\nprocesses by which categories are formulated and changed over time.\nConrad (2007, 7–8), for example, says he is “not\ninterested in adjudicating whether any particular problem is really a\nmedical problem… I am interested in the social underpinnings of\nthis expansion of medical jurisdiction”. \nBut constructivists often present their theories as unmasking common\nsense or medical conceptions of disease, and hence as a kind of\nrevisionism. They may accept that diagnoses of ill-health involve\nobjective facts that people appeal to, or presume that they can appeal\nto, when they say that somebody is sick. The assumption might be that\ngerms or other medically relevant causal factors are present in a\nperson and have given rise to visible phenomena that indicate\nill-health. But a constructivist will claim that the actual, often\nunacknowledged, judgments driving the initial assertion that someone\nis unhealthy are derived from social norms. We may discover facts\nabout obesity and its relationship to blood pressure or life\nexpectancy. But the constructivist says that our search for the\nrelevant biological findings is undertaken because we have already\ndecided that fat people are disgusting and we are trying to find a set\nof medically significant properties in order to make our wish to\nstigmatize them look like a medical decision rather than a moral or\naesthetic one. The crucial constructivist claim is that we look for\nthe biological facts that ground disease judgments selectively, based\non prior condemnations of some people and not others. Because they\nclaim that social norms rather than disinterested inquiry drive\nmedicine (and especially, psychiatry), constructivists tend to be\nrevisionists about folk concepts, seeking to bring to light the\nunacknowledged sources of our concepts of health and disease. But\nconstructivism could be a conservative view, aimed at uncovering our\nfolk theory of health and disease. A constructivist who takes this\nview says that our folk concept of disease is that of a pattern of\nbehavior or bodily activity that violates social norms.  \nThe most philosophically sophisticated recent constructionist view is\nGlackin’s (2019, p.260). He distinguishes the constitution question,\nwhich asks for the physical basis of a person’s condition, from the\nstatus question, which asks what makes a physical configuration a\ndisease? This way of carving the terrain, and the importance of both\nstatus and constitution, is standard among most people who write about\ndisease. The distinctive feature of social construction, in\nGlackin’s sense, is the priority of value judgements. Glackin\nuses the grounding relation to supply an answer to the problem of the\nrelation between constitution and status. That is, the frame for\ngrounding is fundamentally evaluative; the normative has a\nmetaphysical priority. As Glackin (p. 262) puts it, disease states are\ngrounded by the underlying biology or behaviour, but this grounding\nrelation exists in virtue of a set of normative facts that provide the\nframe (in the sense of Epstein 2015: a set of possible worlds that fix\nthe grounding conditions for social facts).  \nOne could be a constructivist about some diseases, and a naturalist\nabout others. For example, one could be a naturalist about bodily\ndisease but a constructivist about psychiatry. Thomas Szasz (1960,\n1973, 1987), for instance, is usually read as a constructivist who\ndenies that mental illness exists. But in fact Szasz has a very strict\nobjectivist concept of disease as no more than damage to bodily\nstructures. \nSzasz argues that mental disorders cannot exist because they are not\nthe result of tissue damage. He is a naturalist about disease, which\nleads him to deny that mental illness is real and to offer a critical\nanalysis of our psychiatric practices. And indeed claims that we are\nmerely taking conduct we don’t like and calling it pathological are\nmore plausible in psychiatry than in other parts of medicine, since\nthere is a long history of psychiatrists who have done just that.\nSamuel Cartwright argued in 1843 that American slaves who tried to\nescape were afflicted with “drapetomania” or the\n“disease causing slaves to run away” (Cartwright 2004,\n33); slaves were also found uniquely prone to “dyesthaesia\nAethiopica”, which made them neglect the property rights of\ntheir masters (Brown 1990). Nineteenth century physicians regularly\npracticed cliterodectomy to cure women of sexual desire, which\neverybody knew never afflicted normal females of good family (Reznek\n1987, 5–6). More recently, Soviet psychiatrists found that\npolitical dissidents suffered from “sluggish\nschizophrenia”. And Horwitz and Wakefield (2007) have suggested\nthat depression has been severely overdiagnosed by recent generations\nof American psychiatrists, leading to the pathologizing of ordinary\nsadness. \nOur current taxonomy of illness could involve both naturalist\nintuitions about some conditions and constructivist rationalizations\nabout others. You could use this depiction of everyday thought as a\npremise in an argument for revisionism, on the grounds that our folk\nconcepts are too confused to serve as constraints (Murphy 2006 makes\nthis argument with respect to psychiatry). \nConstructivism seems correct about some putative diseases; that is,\nsocieties have at times thought that some human activities were\npathological because of values rather than scientific evidence.\nHowever, it is another task to show that constructivism is correct\nabout our concept of disease. And this would be true even if there\nwere no diseases; it might still be the case that our concept of\ndisorder is naturalist even if nothing falls under it. \nThe chief problem for constructivism is that we routinely make a\ndistinction between the sick and the deviant, or between pathological\nconditions and those that we just disapprove of. Our disease concepts\ncannot just be matter of disvaluing certain people or their\nproperties. It must involve a reason for disvaluing them in a medical\nway rather than some other way. Illness has never been the only way to\nbe deviant. So Szasz is just wrong to claim that “when a person\ndoes something bad, like shoot the president, it is immediately\nassumed that he might be mad” (1974, 91). Most of the time when\npeople do bad things nobody doubts their sanity, just their morals.\nPhysically or mentally ill people, even if they are seen as\nnorm-breakers, are seen as a distinctive class of norm-breakers.\nWhat’s distinctive about them? \nThe problem is that we routinely judge that people are worse off\nwithout thinking they are ill in any way – for example, the\nugly, the poor, people with no sense of humor or lousy taste or a\npropensity for destructive relationships. We don’t treat these\njudgments of comparative disadvantage as a prelude to medical inquiry,\nso why do we do so in some other cases? \nNotice that the problem is not just one of establishing that someone\nis badly off or is in some other disvalued state. Rather, the trouble\nis caused by the requirement that someone is badly off in a specific,\nhealth-related or medically significant way. Rachel Cooper, for\nexample (2002, 272–74), analyzes the concept of disease as a bad\nthing to have that is judged to require medical attention. She deals\nwith the objection that specifying when someone is badly off is very\ndifficult. Cooper admits that it is a hard problem, but replies that\nit is a widespread problem, one which crops up in many areas of moral\nphilosophy. \nThis response is correct as a general point but does not touch the\npresent objection. The objection is not that it is hard to say when\nsomeone is badly off, but that it is hard to isolate the specific\nclass of ways of being badly off that we regard as medically relevant\nwithout relying on a notion of natural malfunction. Glackin (2019,\np.272–3), however, denies that this is a problem at all. He argues\nthat to justify treating some conditions as medical issues, and\n\"others as social or legal, rather than medical, all a normativist\nneeds to say is that this is morally speaking the right thing to do.\"\nFor Glackin, we can defend the claim that someone is sick by saying\nthat according to our values they are sick, and no more need be\nsaid. \nOther scholars do think there is more to say. John Harris, for\nexample, posits an “ER test” (2007, 91) according to which\nwe can think of a disorder as a condition that makes someone worse off\nand is such that emergency room personnel would be negligent if they\ndid not remedy it if they could. But as it stands the ER test is much\ntoo broad. Taken literally the ER tests requires medical personnel to\nteach the local language to immigrants whose lives are worsened by a\nlack of competence in it. A general theory of ill-being would be as\ndesirable as a theory of well-being. But without further elaboration\nit would not discriminate between medical and non-medical forms of\nill-being. Like Cooper, Harris faces the difficulty of specifying what\nis distinctively medical about the conditions that we expect medical\npersonnel to treat: of course, a thesis about what counts as a medical\nintervention that was put in terms of combating disease or pathology\nwould be circular. Reznek (1987, 163) argues that we can delimit a\npurely medical sphere “enumeratively without reference to the\nconcept of disease – in terms of pharmacological and surgical\ninterventions.” However, as we saw at the start of this essay, a\nlot of medical attention is directed at conditions which we do not\ncall diseases. Prescribing contraceptive pills is a pharmacological\nintervention, but it is not directed against a disease; going on the\npill is not like beginning a course of anti-malarial tablets. \nThe naturalist answer to the question what makes some medical\ninterventions directed against disease is that conditions which\ndoctors treat are diseases in so far as they involve natural\nmalfunctions. The constructivist view is that the class of what we\ncall malfunctions is picked out by its involvement in medical\npractice, and not the other way round. Cooper and Harris try to base\ntheir analysis on our practices, but they are unable to distinguish\nmedical practices from non-medical ones.  \nBroadbent (2019) has a value-independent account, but it is also\navowedly anti-realist about disease and so can be treated here.\nBroadbent calls his view of disease subjective but he has a different\nway of dealing with the problem of specifying the human response that\nis characteristic of disease judgments. His theory is that health and\ndisease are secondary qualities like color “that depends on, or\nperhaps is partly constituted by, the dispositions of observers or\nthinkers to have certain perceptual or cognitive reactions”\n(p.108). What human observers bring to physiological states of affairs\nis not value judgments, but a disposition to track them as making\ncharacteristic contributions to survival and reproduction. Broadbent\nis alert to the issue that there might be cross-cultural differences\nin judgments about health and disease, but regards these as compatible\nwith very broad agreement on the extension of healthy and diseased\nstates, just as he thinks there is sufficient agreement on spectral\nphenomena to speak of color in different contexts. The same treatment\nwould need to be given with respect to judgments within a society that\nvary over time, assuming that objects can change color as a society\nalters its color categories.  \nSo apart from Glackin there seems to be agreement that the\nconstructivist needs to explain how the judgments that we direct at\nputative sick or healthy people form a special class of judgments. And\nthat explanation has to show, in addition, why we think the conditions\nthat we single out as diseases with those special judgments are\ncandidates for a particular set of causal explanations. It’s all very\nwell to point out, as Reznek does (p.88) that an etiology only\nexplains a pathology if we have already decided that it is a\npathology. This is correct, but it dodges the conceptual question of\nwhy we first decide that only some people or conditions are\npathological. The naturalist says this: we think some people are worse\noff because of a special kind of causal process, namely a disturbance\nof normal physical or psychological function. It is that causal\njudgment that has conceptual priority, even if, as a matter of timing,\nthe violation of a norm is what is detected first. Note that it does\nnot refute naturalism to point out that the concept of disease is\nsometimes misapplied, so that we think people are sick but discover\nthat they are not. In such cases (e.g. homosexuality) the explanation\nfor why it happened may be that our values caused the initial\njudgment, but that does not show that the concept of disease is\nconstructivist, rather than naturalist. No concept is correctly\napplied every time. \nReznek, for instance, argues that to judge “that homosexuality\nis a disease we first have to make a value-judgment. We have first to\njudge that we would be worse off being homosexual” (1987, 212).\nReznek then says that we could discover that homosexuality is not a\ndisease if we find out that it develops by a normal psychological\nprocess. Reznek calls this is a form of constructivism (or\nnormativism, in his terms) because value judgments have conceptual\npriority: but in fact in the case he describes it seems that value\njudgments are actually only heuristics, drawing our attention to\nwhether something might be wrong with someone. If the initial judgment\ncan be overturned by a biological discovery, then it seems that\nbiological facts are necessary for a final judgment. That is to say\nthat our concept of disease necessarily involves both biological and\nevaluative judgments. That is a version of naturalism, since the\nbiological facts are the ultimate foundation for the judgment. Indeed,\nnaturalism seems to explain why constructivist interpretations are\nsometimes correct. We say now that homosexuality was never a disease,\nand was just diagnosed on moral grounds, because it was not caused by\nmalfunctions according to any even moderately correct theory of human\nbiology or psychology. Values stopped people from getting the science\nright, but homosexuality was correctly understood, and no longer seen\nas a disease, when the science was done in a properly disinterested\nway. \nNaturalism embodies the important insight that we do in fact think\nthat disease involves a causal process that includes biological\nabnormalities. It does not mean, however, that all diseases have to\nreceive the same biological explanation. The class of diseases will\ninclude a variety of different conditions that receive different\ncausal explanations. That is, even if diseases are natural kinds, the\nsuperordinate category of disease may not be. Not just any sort of\nstory about the causes of abnormal behavior will do, and it is\ndifficult to reach a satisfactory specification of the sorts of causes\nthat common sense might recognize. We also distinguish, based on our\ncommon sense understanding of human biology, between pathological and\nnon-pathological versions of the same outward phenomena. Because aging\nis normal we acknowledge that an elderly person will differ from a\nyoung adult, so our assumptions about normality are sensitive to\nbackground conditions. But when aging is abnormal, we call it a\ndisease. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, for instance, causes\nchildren to undergo all the stages of human aging at a bizarrely\naccelerated rate. They nearly always die by seventeen, far gone in\nsenescence. Even though we don’t know much about it, we think of\nHutchinson-Gilford as a disease not just because we don’t like being\nold but because we think it is different from getting old in a way\nthat must be caused by some underlying pathology. The concept of\ndisease necessarily requires, just as naturalism insists, that a\ncondition have a causal history involving abnormal biological systems.\nSo let’s turn to naturalism, and see whether it should be a\nconservative or revisionist position. \nWhen we have decided that someone’s biological systems do not function\nproperly, we still face the question, how should we think about that\nperson’s condition? Naturalists usually admit that there is more to\nthe concept of disease than biological malfunction even if they think\nthat biological malfunction is a necessary condition for disease. This\ninvolves a two-stage picture (Murphy 2006, ch 2) which inverts the\nconstructivist portrayal of our practice. Naturalists who buy the two\nstage picture think that, first, we agree on the biological facts\nabout malfunction. At the second stage we make the normative judgment\nthat the person with the malfunction is suffering in some way. (This\nis the order of conceptual priority, not the chronological sequence in\nwhich judgments are made.) Spitzer and Endicott (1978, 18) for\nexample, say that disease categories are “calls to\naction”; assertions that something has gone wrong within a\nperson’s body in a way that produces consequences we think we need to\nremedy (see also Papineau 1994). \nNormative considerations, on this account, inform our judgments about\ndisease but do not have the conceptual priority accorded them by\nconstructivists. We make judgments that someone is suffering in ways\nwe associate with inner malfunction. We also see people who are\nsuffering but who we don’t think are ill or injured, because we do not\nregard their bodily dysfunction as symptoms of disease: vaccination,\nsurgical incisions, ear-piercing or childbirth are examples. Or\nimagine a skin condition that in some cultures causes the sufferer to\nbe worshiped as a god, or become a sought-after sexual partner. The\ntwo-stage picture is designed to distinguish between the physical\nabnormality and the difference it makes to the life of the person who\nhas it. The idea is that whether someone’s body is not functioning\ncorrectly is a separate question from whether it is bad to be like\nthat. Stegenga (2018, p.23) calls such a theory a hybrid account, as\nit argues both that \"there is a constitutive causal basis of disease\nand a normative basis of disease.\" He also adds a fourth alternative,\nwhich he calls eliminativist, arguing for replacing the notion of\ndisease with successor notions tied more closely to the science. This\ngoes beyond what has here been called revisionist naturalism, in that\nit advocates getting rid of the disease concept altogether, rather\nthan just liberating it from commonsense constraints. Hybrid accounts\nhave been very popular among naturalists since at least the\ndissemination of Wakefield’s (1992) influential discussion of mental\ndisorder  \nThe second stage, the question about whether life is worsened by a\nmalfunction, is omitted by simple naturalism. Simple naturalists say\nthat all there is to disease is the failure of someone’s physiology\n(or psychology) to work normally. The view has fewer adherents, but as\nnoted above, Szasz (1987) uses simple objectivism about disease to\njustify his claims that mental disorder is a myth, and Boorse has long\nadvocated such a view, as does Williams (2007). The popularity of\nhybrid accounts, though, is a problem for scholars like Glackin (2019,\np. 258), who argues that the debate exists between\n“normativists, who think the concept is inherently evaluative,\nand naturalists who think it is purely empirical”. But it is\npossible to think that there is an empirical question about the causal\nbasis of disease and a further normative question about the judgments\nmade on that basis, which hybrid theorists also think are necessary\nfor disease.  \nWe have arrived at a generic naturalism that says judgments of illness\nare sensitive to causal antecedents of the right sort, as well as to\nvalue judgments about the effects of those causes. What are the right\ncausal antecedents? Culver and Gert’s (1982) requirement that the\nantecedents be a “nondistinct sustaining cause” is a\nbiologically noncommittal criterion. Culver and Gert analyze the\nconcept of a malady, which involves suffering evils, or increased risk\nof evil, due to “a condition not sustained by something\ndistinct” from oneself (1982, 72). The cause can be physical or\nmental, (p.87), provided it is a sustaining cause that is not distinct\nfrom the sufferer (p.88). A wrestler’s hammerlock, because its effects\ncome and go with the presence or absence of the cause itself, is an\nexample of a sustaining cause. But because the wrestler is a distinct\nentity from the sufferer, someone in a hammerlock does not have a\nmalady. If the cause is inside the body it is nondistinct just in case\nit is difficult to remove (e.g. a surgical implement left behind in\nthe body) or it is biologically integrated in the body (e.g. a\nretrovirus). This is an attractively simple solution but it is too\ninclusive. Culver and Gert (p.71) say that loss of freedom,\nopportunity or pleasure count as evils. But if that is so, then black\ncitizens of South Africa and Mississippi (among many other places)\nused to suffer from maladies, since they were unfree, unhappy and\noppressed. And they suffered these evils because of black skin, which\nwas a nondistinct sustaining aspect of their nature. But it wasn’t a\ndisease. Of course, the presence of racism, backed up by coercive\nsocial structures, was also necessary, but aspects of the environment\nare implicated in many maladies.  \nThis counterexample is instructive, however, since there are two ways\nof amending the proposal in the light of it. First, perhaps the\nprinciple of nondistinct sustaining causes fails to capture our\nintuitions about causes of disease. A second possibility is that the\nprinciple is a good causal condition, but that the account of evils is\ntoo broad, and needs to be restricted to a more intuitively medical\nset of evils, rather than the broader class of impediments to\nwell-being. The section on health will go over the terrain that’s\nrelevant for the second option; the current discussion is about the\ncausal condition. Boorse (1975, 1976, 1977, 1997) and his followers\nhave opted for a more restrictive view of the causes of disease. They\ncontend that disease necessarily involves biological malfunction.\nBoorse distinguished “disease” from “illness”.\nThe former is the failure to conform to the “species-typical\ndesign” of humans, and the latter is a matter of judgments that\na disease is undesirable, entitles one to special treatment, or\nexcuses bad behavior. An account of malfunction must be parasitic on a\ntheory of function. Boorse thinks a function is a\n‘species-typical’ contribution to survival and\nreproduction (1976, 62–63). Disease is failure to function\naccording to a species design, in which functional efficiency is\neither degraded below the typical level or limited by environmental\nagents (1977, 550, 555, 567; 1997, 32). Boorse understands this as\nfunctioning “more than a certain distance below the population\nmean” (1977, 559) for the relevant set of humans. (Since not all\nmembers of a species have the same design in every respect, we need to\nspecify reference classes according to biologically relevant\nsubgroups.) This cutoff point, he thinks, can only be specified as a\nmatter of convention, but this conventional element does not threaten\nthe objectivity of diagnoses. Responses to Boorse since the original\ntheory was formulated have concentrated on two issues. First is the\napparent existence of states like tooth decay that are widespread, so\napparently statistically normal, yet definitely pathologies. The\nsecond is the“line-drawing problem” Schwartz (2007) which\ncomes in two related guises: how we are to reference classes and how\nwe can distinguish between normal and abnormal levels of functional\nefficiency. \nBoorse’s position has been very influential and shaped the entire\nrecent literature. Williams (2007) retains the spirit of the proposal\nbut departs from it in arguing that disease is realized not in\nsystemic malfunctions but failures of interacting cellular networks;\nhe regards applications of disease language to organs, for example, as\nnot strictly speaking correct. Most theorists, though, have continued\nto emphasis malfunction in physiological mechanisms more broadly. In\npsychiatry, for instance, Wakefield (1992, 1997a, 1997b), follows\nBoorse (1976) in assuming that humans have a species-typical design,\nwhich he assumes is a product of natural selection. Wakefield applies\nthe picture to both mental and physical illness: in Wakefield’s\nversion we first judge that a psychological mechanism is not\nperforming the function for which natural selection designed it;\nsecond, we judge that the malfunction is harmful. An appeal to natural\nfunction, by adding extra commitments to the idea of a cause of\nillness, rules out skin pigment as a cause of evil. \nCooper (2002, p.265) suggests that a straightforward appeal to\ndysfunction must be qualified in light of some apparent\ncounterexamples. A woman taking contraceptive pills, for example, may\nbe interfering with typical functioning, but ingesting contraceptives\nis not a disease. (Boorse would have to call it a self-inflicted\ndisease that does not make the woman ill.) Cooper also raises the\nproblem of individuals with chronic conditions that are controlled by\ndrugs. She argues that these are cases of diseased subjects who\nnonetheless function normally and suggests that the analysis must be\namended to talk of a disposition to malfunction. But, as Cooper sees,\nthe big problem faced by Boorsian accounts is that of coming up with\nan acceptable conception of normal function in the first place.  \nThere are two problems that we can distinguish here. The first is\nwhether a non-normative account of malfunction is possible, about\nwhich much debate has taken place. A second problem has come into\nfocus more recently. If there is a positive scientific account of\nfunction and malfunction that is pertinent to disease, which science\nowns it? The debate deriving from Boorse’s work has assumed that\nphysiologists and pathologists have the last word here. Following\nBoorse, Hausman (2015, p. 9) is explicit that physiologists and\npathologists are the relevant medical specialists whose judgments we\ncare about. Lemoine and Giroux (2016) question the great stress on\nphysiology to the exclusion of other medical specialties in Boorse\n– they think he has backed the wrong doctors. Lemoine and Giroux\nthink we should see physiology as the science of how organisms work\nconsidered as assemblies of organ systems. But they think that the\nscience of health and disease is defined by broader medical\nconsiderations that go beyond the physiological. Tied up with this is\na broad consensus that the correct explanation of disease states is\nmechanistic, though this too has been challenged in the name of more\nabstract explanations from different parts of medicine (Darrason\n2018).  \nThe Boorsian analysis is of a commonsense concept of disease which\nbottoms out in a notion of malfunction as the cause of illness. The\nview is that conceptual analysis determines the empirical commitments\nof our disease concepts and then hands over to the biomedical sciences\nthe problem of finding biological functions and malfunctions. Some\nrecent theorists, notably Wakefield, have argued for an evolutionary\naccount of function as that which has historically been spread by\nnatural selection. Others have argued that the biomedical sciences\nemploy a different conception of function. Besides identifying the\nright concept of function for the job, other problems affect the whole\nnaturalist community. A reliance on scientific, functional\ndecomposition as the ultimate justification of judgments of health and\ndisease requires a revisionist, rather than a conservative, account.\nAlso, it may not always be possible to settle contested cases by an\nappeal to a notion of normal human nature, because that notion is\nitself contested. \nFirst, why suppose that the relevant concept of function is an\nadaptive one, and that dysfunction is a failure of a biological system\nto fulfill its adaptive function? This analysis of function is often\ntermed the etiological account, and although it is widespread in\nphilosophy of biology it seems to be conceptually tied to fitness\nrather than health (Méthot 2011). Advocates of a thoroughgoing\nevolutionary approach to medicine (such as Gluckman, Beedle and Hanson\n2009) can be read as providing a framework within which we can make\nsense of a number of processes that have an effect on health and\ndisease, but not as offering analyses of health and disease that are\ntied to fitness. Gluckman et al. (p.5) consider the difference between\nlactose intolerance, which develops after weaning and is normal for\nmost human populations, and congenital hypolactasia, a condition in\nwhich newborns cannot digest maternal milk. The former is a\nconsequence of the absence of pastoralism in most historical human\npopulations and does not affect fitness in those populations, whereas\nthe latter would have been fatal in the past and thus was selected\nagainst. However, they do not define disease in terms of\nfitness-lowering: they note rather that an evolutionary perspective\ncan make us sensitive to hitherto neglected causes of pathology and\nalso sensitive to over-hasty judgments of pathology in cases where the\ncondition is normal among populations with a given evolutionary\ntrajectory. \nWakefield’s approach is not that of a thoroughgoing evolutionary\ntheorist of disease in that sense. Rather, he plugs an etiological\naccount of function into a Boorsian model, and his approach has been\ndeveloped with little attempt to argue that medicine does in fact use\nan evolutionary, teleological account of function. In opposition,\nSchaffner (1993) has argued that although medicine might use\nteleological talk in its attempts to develop a mechanistic picture of\nhow humans work, the teleology is just heuristic. It can be completely\ndispensed with when the mechanistic explanation of a given organ or\nprocess is complete. Schaffner argues that as we learn more about the\ncausal role a structure plays in the overall functioning of the\norganism, the need for teleological talk of any kind drops out and is\nsuperseded by the vocabulary of mechanistic explanation, and that\nevolutionary functional ascriptions are merely heuristic; they focus\nour attention on “entities that satisfy the secondary [i.e.\nmechanistic] sense of function and that it is important for us to know\nmore about” (1993, 390). \nIn effect, Schaffner is arguing that the biomedical sciences employ a\ncausal, rather than a teleological, concept of function. This is in\nthe spirit of Cummins’s (1975) systemic analysis of function as the\ncausal contribution a structure makes to the overall operation of the\nsystem that includes it. Cummins’s concept of function is not a\nhistorical or evolutionary concept. According to Cummins, a component\nof a system may have a function even it was not designed or selected\nfor. Wakefield has tied disease conceptually to an evolutionary\nconcept of function as a naturally selected capacity. It is doubtful\nif this connection can be found in either science or common sense\nabout disease. Perhaps in some areas of biology functional ascription\nis indeed teleological. However, most theorists who have attended to\nbiomedical contexts agree with Boorse and Schaffner that the function\nof an organ or structure can be understood without thinking of it as\nan adaptation. Lange (2007) explicitly follows the systemic approach\nto function. He argues that diseases are incapacities that explain\nsymptoms in causal-analytic terms.Medical understanding requires that\nfunctional structures can be identified and analyzed in terms of their\ncontribution to the overall maintenance of the organism as a living\nsystem. However, it is also clear that the contribution of some\nsystems – especially reproductive ones – have a purpose that is not\ntied to homeostatic regulation and organisation in this way, which\ncomplicates the picture. Theorists who prefer a causal-historical\naccount to a teleogical one argue that explanation in medicine takes a\nmodel of the normal realization of a biological process and uses the\nmodel to show how abnormalities stem from the failure of normal\nrelations to apply between components of the model. This requires a\nnon-historical function concept, one that is at home in\ncausal-mechanistic, rather than evolutionary, explanation. Proponents\nof a teleogical account can respond that those systems, even if they\nadmit of mechanistic explanation, only exist in the first place\nbecause they have facilitated survival and reproduction, and that the\netiological perspective provides an overall conceptual framework.  \nAn evolutionary approach faces problems in specifying what the overall\nevolved function of a system might be and showing how functions\ncontribute to it. First, it is very difficult to assess the relevant\nevidence that a given biological systems is — as in Wakefield’s\ntreatment — the product of natural selection (Davies 2001,\nChapter 5). Since many ailments do not prevent one from living and\nhaving children, it is even harder to show that a disease is\nnecessarily the product of a malfunction that lowers fitness or\n— as in Boorse — interferes with survival and\nreproduction. Another problem for Wakefield is that if you regard\nevolutionary dysfunction as partly constitutive of disease then if an\nillness depends on structures that have no evolved function, it cannot\nreally be an illness. A biological structure might be a spandrel or a\nby-product, or have some other non-selective history. Such a structure\ncannot malfunction in Wakefield’s sense, and so it cannot be diseased\nin the primary, evolutionary sense.The idea would have to be weakened\nto suggest that it is diseased in a derivative sense in virtue of its\nimplications for other selected effects elsewhere in the system  \nObjections to an evolutionary notion of medical malfunction do not\nshow that there is anything wrong with the general idea of basing\njudgments of health and disease on a scientifically established\npicture of the normal functional decomposition of human beings.\nHowever, on this account, it becomes harder to retain the conservative\nproject that looks for the natural phenomena that fall under, and are\ntherefore constrained by, our folk concepts of health and disease.\nWakefield, for instance, thinks some psychiatric diagnoses flout our\nintuitions by attributing disorder on the basis of behavior alone\nwithout looking for malfunctioning mental mechanisms (1997a). He\nappeals to intuitions to derive necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the folk concept of mental disorder, and assumes that science\nshould search for the psychological processes that fit the concept\nthus defined. But it is one thing to take intuitions as a starting\npoint, and another to say that they are hegemonic. Boorse, too,\nadduces everyday linguistic usage and commonsense intuitions as\nevidence, even though he claims to be discussing the clinical concepts\nof health and disease.  \nA revisionist can say that a condition we currently disvalue but do\nnot regard as a disease may turn out to involve malfunction and hence\nto be a disease, whatever our intuitions say. Conversely, we may think\nsomething is a disease but we might be wrong, just as we were wrong\nabout drapetomania or masturbation, which do not causally depend on\nany biological malfunction. Conservatives resist this possibility.\nWakefield claims that we have intuitions about human nature that make\nit “obvious from surface features” whether underlying\nmechanisms are functional or dysfunctional (Wakefield 1997b, 256). But\nit is an empirical discovery whether one’s physiology or psychology is\nfunctioning properly, not something to be decided from the armchair,\nor even from inspecting surface features. A conservative may, though,\nseek to distinguish debunked intuitions that can be explained away\n(perhaps as products of local norms, as in the masturbation case) from\nmore resilient intuitions that survive debunking and can still feature\nas constraint on analysis.  \nHowever, once we hand over the task of uncovering malfunction to the\nsciences we can no longer make common sense the ultimate arbiter,\nunless we wish to explicitly import, into the concept of disease,\nconsiderations derived from folk theories of what normal human nature\namounts to. \nIt seems that the analysis of disease as depending on malfunctioning\nbiological components requires a functional decomposition of human\nbiology. If that decomposition is to be independent of what we think\npeople should be like, it should not be regulated by common sense\ntheories of human nature, but discovered by science. We must be able\nto ascertain, within acceptable limits of variation, the biological\nstandards that nature has imposed on humans. The goal of finding out\nhow a biological system works is fixed by our interests in health and\nwell-being, but the naturalist’s assumption is that the goal is met by\ndiscovering empirical facts about human biology, not our own,\nculturally defined, norms. So, we diagnose someone as suffering from\nmesenteric adenitis not just because they are in discomfort due to\nfever, abdominal pain and diarrhea, but because the lower right\nquadrant of the mesenteric lymphatic system displays abnormal\ninflammation. This thickening of the nodes is not just the objective\ncause of the discomfort, it is an objective failure of the lymphatic\nsystem to make its normal contribution to the overall system. For the\nnaturalist’s program to work, the biological roles of human organs\nmust be natural facts just as empirically discoverable as the atomic\nweights of chemical elements. That may result in the overturning of\ncommon sense. \nThis raises a further issue. It is widely believed that function\nconcepts are intrinsically normative, since they are teleological (for\na recent review see Barnes 2016). Therefore, the objection continues,\nclaims about natural functional and malfunction introduce normative\nconsiderations into the foundations of medicine, which are supposed to\nbe purely scientific. \nA response might be to maintain that whether or not functional claims\nshould be seen as normative, it is not the socially relative\nnormativity appealed to by constructivists. The crucial point is that\nin the life sciences, some biological system can fail to behave as a\ntheory predicts without impugning the prediction: we can say that the\nsystem is malfunctioning. This contrasts with other sciences, in\nwhich, if a system fails to behave as predicted, the fault lies with\nthe science, not the system. \nGriffiths and Matthewson (2018) attempt to rehabilitate an\nevolutionary account of function in this context. They tie a selected\neffects interpretation of function to life history theory, with the\nadvertised aim of providing an explication of pathology that grounds\nit in a mature science rather than trying to recover some commonsense,\nor even medically prevalent, concept of disease. Their key contention\nis that this gives them a scientifically sound way to make\ndiscrimination that would otherwise be puzzling, such as the\ndistinction between disease states and senescence, and the means to\nsort populations into principled reference classes. The resulting\npicture (Matthewson and Griffiths 2017) is one which generates a\nvariety of evolution-based ways in which organisms can \"go wrong\".\nThis sets up a taxonomy of opportunities for intervention: some\norganisms are malfunctioning; others are working properly but in the\nwrong environment; others are badly off because the environment is\ninhospitable even though it is normal for them and they are working as\nthey have evolved to; still others generate a development pathway\nbased on misleading information about what optimal development will\nrequire. This way of setting up the issues is strongly revisionist,\nand arguably is no longer an attempt to define disease at all as most\nof the scholars we have discussed would understand it. Matthewson and\nGriffiths argue for the congruence of this account with our best\nscience and its stress on the continuity of human and non-human\nbiology. \nSupporters of an evolutionary account of function advertise the ease\nwith which an account of malfunction follows from the theory as one of\nits virtues. Their idea is that we can say when a system is\nmalfunctioning by observing that it is not carrying out the job which\nnatural selection designed it to perform. In contrast, it is widely\nbelieved that systemic accounts of function cannot deal with\nmalfunction at all. The argument goes like this: what a system is\ntaken to do is relative to our explanatory interests, and that a\nputative malfunction can just be understood as a contribution to a\ndifferent property of the system. Davies (2001) argues that the first\nof these claims can be defeated by restricting functional ascriptions\nto hierarchically organized systems in which lower level capacities\nrealize upper level ones. That gives us a characterization of function\nindependent of our explanatory interests. \nGodfrey-Smith (1993) argues that systemic concepts of function do\npermit attributions of malfunction. He argues that a token component\nin a system is malfunctioning when it cannot play the role that lets\nother tokens of the same type feature in the explanation of the larger\nsystem. Davies (2003, 212) denies this. He says that functional types\nare defined in terms of what they can do and that if a component\ncannot carry out its normal contribution to the overall system then it\nceases to be a member of a type. However, Davies’ objection appears to\nfail, at least in medical contexts, if we can identify components\napart from their functional roles. Suppose we can identify biological\ncomponents in terms of their anatomical position and relationships to\nother organs. If so, we can say that an organ in the position\ncharacteristic of its type remains a member of that type even though\nit has lost some capacity characteristic of that type, and hence is\nmalfunctioning. Reasoning like this permits doctors to identify organs\nas normal or abnormal during autopsies, even though every system in a\ncorpse no longer possesses its normal function in Davies’s sense. \nThis leaves unaddressed the issue of how we determine what normal\nfunction is. Wachbroit (1994) argues that when we say that an organ is\nnormal, we employ a biomedical concept of normality that is an\nidealized description of a component of a biological system in an\nunperturbed state that may never be attained in actual systems. Boorse\n(1977, 1997) insists that the notion of normality in biomedical\nconcepts is statistical — how things usually are in a reference\nclass, but this view faces the problem of specifying the reference\nclasses in an informative way. But given the amount of variation\nwithin a species, it will always be hard to find reference classes\nwhich share a design. As Ereshefsky (2009) puts it, Boorse assumes\nthat statistical normality coincides with the kind of normality that\nmedicine cares about, but this looks wrong. Wachbroit (1994, 588)\nargues convincingly that the role of normality in physiology is like\nthe role that pure states or ideal entities play in physical\ntheories. \nStatistically, a textbook heart, for example, may be very rare indeed.\nBut it is the account of the organ that gets into the physiology\ntextbook. The textbook tells you what a healthy organ is like by\nreference to an abstraction – an idealized organ. This concept\nof normality is not justified by appeal to a conceptual analysis that\naims to capture intuitions about what’s normal. It draws all its\nauthority from its predictive and explanatory utility: against the\nbackground of assuming normal heart function, for example, we account\nfor variation in actual hearts (a particular rhythm, say), by citing\nthe textbook rhythmic pattern (which may be very unusual\nstatistically) and identifying other patterns as arrhythmic. The point\nof textbook depictions of human physiology is to identify an ideal\nsystem that enables us to answer “what if things had been\ndifferent questions” (Woodward 2003, Murphy 2006). The role of\nan idealization, in this system, is to let us classify real systems\naccording to their departure from the ideal. So normal human\nbiological nature, in this sense, is an idealization designed to let\nus impose order on variation. \nVariation in biological traits is ubiquitous, and so establishing\nwhether a mechanism is functioning normally is difficult: nonetheless,\nbiologists do it all the time. As Boorse notes, many objections argue\nthat pathological states are aspects of natural variation and conclude\nthat there is no clear distinction between the normal and the\npathological. But he contends that is a non-sequitur, since the\nexistence of widespread and extensive variation is compatible with the\nexistence of pathological states. Boorse (2014, p. 696–8) and\nMatthewson and Griffiths (2017) both point out that biologists often\njudge that members of a species come in forms that are not normal\nvariants but pathological states. \nHowever, how we ascertain what is pathological remains to be\ndetermined. Not all diagnoses can be tied to a break between normal\nand abnormal functioning of an underlying mechanism, such as a failure\nof the kidneys to conserve electrolytes. Nor can we always discover\nsome other abnormality, such as the elevated levels of helicobacter\npylori bacteria that have been found to be causally implicated in\nstomach ulcers (discussed in detail by Thagard 1999). Some conditions,\nsuch as hypertension, involve cutting between normal and pathological\nparts of a continuous variation, even in the absence of clear\nunderlying malfunctions that separate the populations. The Boorsian\ntradition has tried to deal with the problem of variation by tying\nassessments of function and malfunction to reference classes, which\nBoorse (1977) treated as natural classes of organisms that share a\nuniform blueprint. Kingma (2007, 2010) has recently argued that\nreference classes cannot be established without normative judgements,\ncontra Boorse, who takes them to be objectively discoverable parts of\nthe natural order. Kingma contends that Boorse’s account of\nfunction needs to capture not only the qualitative causal contribution\nmade by a system to overall functioning, but also the quantitative\nfeatures of its contribution: a healthy heart is not just a pump, but\na pump that works at a given rate. In addition, a system must be\ncapable of working in a variety of situations, including rare ones\nthat require a physiological response to a crisis. Kingma argues that\nBoorse’s biostatistical theory cannot capture statistically\nunusual yet functional situations, and concludes that we need to\nappeal to situation-specific functions. (Cf. Canguilhem (1991 p. 196),\nwho argued that disease is only abnormal relative to a clearly defined\ncontext.) \nKingma also points out that organs can become diseased even if they do\nact in a situationally appropriate way. Liver damage due to\nparacetamol overdose is obviously not healthy, she says, but the liver\nis not doing anything situationally inappropriate. That is, a reduced\nlevel of function in the context of paracetamol overdose is the\nsituationally appropriate way for the liver to perform. Kingma offers\nBoorse a dilemma. First, he can either abandon the notion of\nsituationally specific functions. This means failing to recognize the\ndynamic nature of physiology and leading to absurdities such as the\nclaim that a gut which is not currently digesting because it is empty\nof food is, in fact, diseased. Or, second, Boorse can acknowledge\nsituation-specific functions, in which case he must say that some\nsystems are healthy (because they are acting as they should in that\nsituation) even though our intuitions insist that they are unhealthy,\nbecause there are diseases that are statistically the norm in some\nsituations. Hausman (2011) responds that from a Boorsian perspective\nthe crucial question is whether the normal response – the\norganism doing its job under stress – renders the system\nincapable. The digestive system may respond appropriately to poison\nbut in doing so it becomes incapable of normal function on average. If\na victim of a poisoning were to a eat a large unpoisoned meal, her\ndigestive system would function much less well than that of the\naverage unpoisoned person in similar circumstances. \nFollowing Boorse, Hausman assumes that there is an average range of\nperformance within a normal population in normal circumstances that\ncan tell us what physiological profile a healthy system ought to have.\nHis reply is developed and expanded by Garson and Piccinini (2014).\nThe issue is whether these normal circumstances can be specified\nwithout begging the question, or whether Wachbroit is correct to think\nof medical normality as an idealization that is unrelated to\nstatistical normality. On any approach, a worry is that if we cite\nbehavioral factors in establishing normality they will reflect\ncontested conceptions of human flourishing. Distinguishing failures to\nflourish from functional abnormalities will always be a special\nproblem for psychiatry. For example, judgments of irrationality are\ncentral to many psychiatric diagnoses, and our standards of rational\nthought reflect not biological findings but standards derived from\nnormative reflection. The possibility of psychiatric explanation\nemploying the methods and models of physical medicine, then, depends\non how much of our psychology is like the visual system – i.e.\ndecomposable into structures to which we can ascribe a natural\nfunction (Murphy 2006). Within medicine more generally, the prospects\nfor a general naturalism about disease depend on our ability to\nunderstand human biology as a set of structures whose functions we can\ndiscover empirically, and our capacity to understand disease causally\nas the product of failures of those structures to perform their\nnatural functions. \nMore could be said on all these topics, but the essay will now shift\nto discuss health. A simple account of health might hold it to be\nsimply the absence of disease, so that if we agree everything is\nfunctioning as it should – subject to the complications outlined\nabove, then one is healthy. But most discussions of health insist that\nhealth is not just the absence of disease but something more.  \nAs noted above, conceptions of health, like conceptions of disease,\ntend to go beyond the simple condition that one is biologically in\nsome state. In the case of health, one view is that a healthy\nindividual is just someone whose biology works as our theories say it\nshould. This is the counterpart, in theories of health, to simple\nobjectivism about disease. It is defended at length by Hausman (2015)\nwho calls it “functional efficiency”. As with disease,\nhowever, most scholars who write about health add further conditions\nhaving to do with quality of life. For instance, Hausman argues that\nwhat we are concerned to measure is the contribution that functional\nefficiency makes to overall well-being. We track not health but the\nthings that make health important. Hausman thus distinguishes disease,\nhealth and the value of health. Other scholars draw a similar\nthreefold distinction in different ways. One might have a partly\nevaluative view of health, like a hybrid view of disease, while also\nthinking that health should be distinguished from a broader concept\nlike well-being or flourishing. Such views dispute the line we find in\nBoorse and Hausman that a non-evaluative conception of health is\nviable. Alexandrova (2018), for instance, argues that health is one of\nmany partly normative concepts that give rise to what she calls\n“mixed claims“ in the social sciences, that relate,\nempirical variables to normatively derived variables. The definition\nand measurement of health, she insists, must depend on normative\njudgments about what it takes to be healthy. \nWhat kinds of normative claims are relevant? Carel (2007, 2008) thinks\nthat the important thing about health is one’s lived experience of\none’s own body, and in particular, that one should not feel estranged\nor alienated from one’s body. Carel argues that health should be\nunderstood phenomenologically as the experience of being at home in\none’s lived body, rather than merely the normal functioning of the\nbody seen as a biological unit. \nFrom the naturalist perspective, one problem with this proposal is\nthat it ignores the fact that one can feel perfectly at ease with\none’s lived body even if one harbors, unaware, a diseased system.\nIndeed, Carel argues that someone who is ill can be, in her sense,\nhealthy, if they are adapted to their bodily predicament; from her\nperspective, objections like the one just mentioned miss the point,\nsince they privilege a biological perspective rather than a\nphenomenological one. Her project is avowedly revisionist: she wishes\nto replace existing concepts of health with views that aim to capture\nthe experience of being healthy (or unwell). \nCarel’s stress on experience is directly challenged by views like\nGadamer’s. He insists (1996, 113) that it is absurd to ask someone if\nthey feel healthy, since health is “not a condition that one\nintrospectively feels in oneself. Rather, it is a condition of being\ninvolved, of being in the world, of being together with one’s fellow\nhuman beings, of active and rewarding engagement in one’s everyday\ntasks”. Gadamer’s healthy person is someone who is in harmony\nwith their social and natural environment, and disease is a\ndisturbance of this harmony. Canguilhem (1991, 2012) thinks of health\nas flexibility, in the sense that a healthy organism can tolerate\nenvironmental impacts, adapts to new situations and possesses a store\nof energy and audacity. This is not something that can be measured by\nphysiology (2012, p.49). Canguilhem’s approach suggests what is wrong\nwith Gadamer’s objection to phenomenological accounts of health. A\nphenomenological account does not have to hold, as Gadamer seems to have\nsupposed, that there is a special feeling that is the feeling of being\nhealthy. Rather, for a view like Canguilhem or Carel’s, healthy people\nexperience the world as an arena to express themselves in rather than\na bunch of threats. Antonovsky (1987) puts this in terms of a sense of\ncoherence which enables one to understand the environment and mobilize\ninternal resources against external stressors. It may well be that\nperspectives like Carel’s are neglected in contemporary medicine, and\nthat they are especially important in disability studies. However, it\ndoes not follow that the concepts of health and disease, rather than\naspects of our practices that employ those concepts, should be\nreformed along the lines she suggests. In general, though, accounts of\nhealth, compared to those of disease, are less concerned with trying\nto capture a scientific or clinical concept. \nGadamer’s view is reminiscent of what Richman (2003) calls\n“embedded instrumentalist” theories, which claim that\nhealth is indexed to goals: how healthy you are depends on how well\nyou can fulfill your goals. Such theories are very popular. Nordenfelt\n(1995) considered two versions of this approach. One version defines\nthe goals relevant to health as needs, which are understood as having\na biological basis. Another view defines goals in terms of the\nambitions and desires of the individual. Nordenfelt (1995, 90) argues\nthat a healthy person is one who can satisfy her “vital\ngoals”, which are those that are necessary and sufficient for\nher to be minimally happy. \nEmbedded instrumentalist theories of health have an obvious appeal.\nOnce we argue that health involves judgments about how well a person’s\nlife is going, we need a way to evaluate that, and an immediately\nattractive idea is that someone’s life goes well if they can achieve\ntheir ambitions or satisfy their goals. An apparent difficulty,\nhowever, is that much the same terrain is covered by theories of\nwell-being, and while people think that being healthy is important to\ntheir well-being (Eid and Larsen 2007), they do not identify the two.\nRather, they think of health as a component of well-being or a\ncontributor to it. \nSome embedded instrumentalist theories, though, appear to be in danger\nof defining health in such a way that it is synonymous with\nwell-being. Richman (2003), for example, develops his view, (the\n“Richman-Budson view”) to deal with objections that\nNordenfelt raises against goal-based views, such as the worry that\nsomeone with very low ambitions will count as healthy just because she\nis easily satisfied. Richman (2003, 56–57) supposes that someone\nis healthy if she can strive for a consistent set of goals that would\nbe chosen by an idealized version of herself if she were fully aware\nof her “objectified subjective interest” (p.45). That is,\nthey are the goals she would choose if she had complete knowledge of\nherself and her environment and perfect rationality. \nIn this case it seems that a theory of health is in danger of becoming\na general theory of well-being, and Richman does not discuss the\nrelationship between the two. A further complication is the\nrelationship between medical interventions designed to cure diseases,\nand other medical interventions which are “enhancement\ntechnologies” (Elliott 2003). The line between enhancement and\ntherapy is very hard to draw: Harris (2007, 21) for example, uses the\nexample of vaccination, which is both a therapeutic protection against\ninfection and an enhancement of our natural immune system. Perhaps,\ntoo, many of us would benefit from a boost to our powers of\nconcentration, or a lift in our mood, which pharmaceuticals might\nsupply. But neurological enhancements, unlike vaccines, can help us to\nmeet our goals without guarding against disease. Perhaps what is\nneeded is a weaker view of the relation between health and\ngoal-directedness, such as that offered by Whitbeck (1981, 620).\nWhitbeck defines health in terms of the psychophysiological capacities\nof an individual that support her “goals, projects and\naspirations in a wide variety of situations”. This view loosens\nthe tight Richman-Budson connection between health and goal-directed\naction, and suggests a view on which we can see biological capacities\nas at the core of health in so far as they help people’s lives to go\nbetter. So there seems to be a broad but not unanimous view that\nwhatever one thinks about the value-ladenness of health we need a\nthreefold distinction between disease, health (which may or may not be\npartly evaluative, and some properties of a person’s life that enable\nus to evaluate how well it is going for them. Not all such properties\nare health problems – someone who is oppressed is not unhealthy\nsimply in virtue of being oppressed (though oppression can certainly\ncause health problems) – oppression itself can be distinguished\nfrom the health problems that may follow from the nature of oppression\n \nSchroeder (2013) has taken issue with the whole idea of defining health as a property or state of an individual. He argues in contrast\nthat “health” is a fundamentally comparative term like\n“tall”. Two human beings can both be tall even if one is\ntaller than the other, whereas it makes no sense to think of two\nstraight lines, one of which is straighter than the other. Schroeder\nargues that if we see health as fundamentally comparative or relational \nwe can recast several conceptual, ethical and policy debates. For\nexample, instead of thinking in terms of non health-related\ndifferences among the healthy we could think in terms of gradations of\nhealth. Schroeder also thinks that his approach makes\nintergenerational or cross-temporal comparisons easier, since we can\nsay that a medieval serf was healthy in their time, but nonetheless\nless healthy than a modern person who is, by our standards,\nchronically ill. An approach like this might offer some traction on\nthe reference class problem outlined above. \nNaturalism and constructivism have been distinguished for analytic\npurposes in this essay but they are not always easy to tell apart in\npractice. The difficulty comes from the fact that there is widespread\nagreement that our thinking about disease pays attention to both human\nvalues and biological phenomena, and it is not always easy to tell how\na theorist explains the interactions of these factors, nor whether a\ngiven analysis is descriptive or prescriptive. For naturalists the\nrelevant biological processes are departures from good human\nfunctioning, construed in one of several ways about which controversy\nrages, but to be determined by the relevant science. These biological\nproblems result in what we judge to be difficulties in living, which\nmay or may not be partly constitutive of disease, just as positive\nqualities may or may not be partly constitutive of health. For a\nconstructivist, it is the problems people face in their lives that\ntake priority. Their biological underpinnings are ones we count as\nabnormal because we have judged them to be both relevant to the\nconditions we disvalue and also the subject matter of a specific,\nmedical, class of interventions, therapies and other practices. The\nobstacle to a successful development of naturalism is the problem of\nestablishing a satisfactory, science-based, distinction between normal\nand abnormal human functioning. Overcoming this difficulty will\nrequire a closer engagement by theorists of disease with the relevant\ndebates in the philosophy of biology. \nFor constructivists, the big problem is to say why we judge some human\nphenomena to be symptoms of disease whereas others are taken as\nevidence that someone is criminal or ugly or possessed by demons or\nsomething else we do not admire. It is not generally true that we\nthink that if someone’s life goes badly it is because he or she is\nunhealthy, so constructivists owe us an account of what makes a\ncertain class of judgments distinctively medicalized.
