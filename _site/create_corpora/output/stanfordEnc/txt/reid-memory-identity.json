Like his direct\nrealism about perception, Reid developed his account as an alternative\nto the model of the mind that he called ‘the theory of\nideas.’ On such a theory, mental operations such as perception\nand memory have mental states—ideas or impressions—as\ntheir direct objects. These mental states are understood as\nrepresentations that encode information about their causes. The mind\nis directed towards and reads off from these representations,\ninformation about extra-mental items. By contrast, Reid holds that the\ndirect objects of memory and perception are extra-mental. In the case\nof perception, the mind is directed to present material objects and\nproperties; in the case of memory, the mind is directed towards past\nevents to which the person was agent or witness. In other words,\naccording to Reid, when we remember, we do not recall previous\nexperiences. In memory, the mind is directed neither towards an idea\nexperienced previously nor towards an idea of a previous\nexperience. Rather, we recall events, experienced\npreviously.\n\n\n\nReid is interested in the notion of memory not only for its own sake\nbut also because of its conceptual connection to the notion of personal\nidentity. Reid criticizes Locke’s theory of personal\nidentity for inferring a metaphysical hypothesis now called the Memory\nTheory from the conceptual connection between memory and personal\nidentity. On this theory, personal identity consists in\nmemory; sameness of memory is metaphysically necessary and sufficient\nfor sameness of persons. According to Reid, memory is neither necessary\nnor sufficient for personal identity, metaphysically speaking.\nIndeed, Reid holds that it is impossible to account for personal\nidentity in any terms other than itself. Personal identity is\nsimple and unanalyzable. Though memory is not the metaphysical ground\nof personal identity, according to Reid, it provides first-personal\nevidence of personal identity. I know that I was present at my\ngraduation because I remember being there. Memories do not\nmake one the same person over time. Rather, memories\nallow one to know one’s own past, immediately and directly.\n\n\n\nReid traces the target of his criticisms back to the Ancients, whom he\ndepicts as holding that the mind is a sensorium—a repository of\npast ideas and impressions (Essays,\n 280).[1] \n On this\ntheory, perception, memory and imagination are causal processes\nbeginning with purely physiological events: impressions on the\nbrain. These physiological states are taken to have mental\ncorrelates—sensations or ideas of sense or sense\nimpressions—which are the objects of perception, memory and\nimagination. These ideas or impressions are representations in the\nsense that they preserve, or re-present information from their\nphysiological correlates.  According to Reid, this view recognizes no\ndistinction between imagination and memory. Each consists in having a\npicture-like impression that remains after the object that\nimpressed upon the senses is gone. The only difference between the two\nis in the fidelity of the imagistic impression to its cause. Memory\nconsists in the preservation of images imprinted in the mind from\nprevious experiences, while imagination consists in constructing\nimages that lack a duplicate in experience. \n\nReid offers two criticisms of the ancient theory, as he understands\nit. First, the theory falls afoul of one of Reid’s own\nmethodological strictures, namely, that a theory must adhere to\nNewton’s regulae philosophandi, or rules of\nphilosophizing (Inquiry, 12). The first rule is to posit\nno merely theoretical causes and in Reid’s view the second rule\nforbids positing causes insufficient to explain the phenomenon in\nquestion. According to Reid, there is no observational evidence\nof the existence of impressions on the brain—they are merely\ntheoretical entities (Essays, 281). Furthermore, even if\nwe granted the otherwise theoretical existence of impressions, such\nentities would not be sufficient to explain memory. We might\nestablish a correlation between impressions and memories, but it would\nremain at best just that: a correlation, not a causal\nexplanation. Having learned Hume’s lessons about causation,\nReid denies any necessary connections between impressions and memories\nsufficient to regard the former as a cause of the latter. Reid\nalso considers whether resemblance could ground such a causal\nexplanation, but, having learned Berkeley’s lessons about\nresemblance, he denies that any mental states can resemble material\nstates such as impressions on the brain. Reid’s second\ncriticism is that even if we were to grant that impressions remain\nafter the objects that impressed upon the senses are gone, this would\nentail that we should continue to perceive objects rather than remember\nthem, since on the ancient theory, impressions are the immediate causes\nand objects of perception (Essays, 282). \n\nThough Reid identifies his target as having ancient origins, his\nprimary concern is with what he regards as its modern equivalent.\nThis modern theory was introduced by Locke and, according to Reid,\nextended to its inevitable idealist and skeptical conclusions by\nBerkeley and Hume. Reid excerpts passages from Locke’s\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding to illustrate the\nmisleading metaphors Locke inherits from the ancient\ntheory—metaphors of the mind as a storehouse and of ideas and\nimpressions as pictures. \n\nAs this passage illustrates, Locke himself acknowledges that the\nnotion that the mind is a kind of repository or storehouse is\nmetaphorical. According to Locke’s own theory, ideas and\nimpressions cannot be stored. Locke is committed to the thesis\nthat ideas are momentary and non-continuous and to the thesis that\nidentity over time requires continuous existence. These two\ntheses jointly entail that numerically identical ideas cannot be stored\nover time. Nevertheless, Reid criticizes Locke for being unable\nto extricate himself from metaphor when Locke claims that in memory,\n“the mind, as it were, paints ideas anew on it self.”\nOn what model does the mind paint the idea anew? In order to use\na previous idea as its model, the mind must remember it. But then\nthe ability to paint ideas anew upon itself presupposes rather than\nexplains memory. \n\nLocke offers a non-metaphorical account of memory when he claims\nthat memory consists of two perceptions: a present perception and a\nbelief about that present perception, namely that one has enjoyed the\nperception before. Because Locke is committed to the thesis that\nnumerically identical ideas cannot be stored over time, the belief must\nbe the belief that one has previously enjoyed a perception\nqualitatively similar to the present perception, rather than\nnumerically identical with it. Reid criticizes this account as\ncircular, once more. A first-personal belief that one’s\npresent perception is qualitatively similar to a perception one had in\nthe past requires remembering having had that previous perception and\nrecalling its quality and character. As before, Locke’s\naccount presupposes rather than explains the phenomenon of memory\n(Essays, 285). \n\nReid criticizes Hume’s account of memory for duplicating\nLocke’s mistakes. He quotes from Hume’s Treatise\nof Human Nature: \n\nLike Locke, Hume holds that ideas have no continued existence.\nAnd so, Reid argues, Hume cannot claim that a numerically identical\nidea can reappear. In addition, Hume’s account faces the\nsame circularity objection as Locke’s. Hume accounts for\nmemory by appealing to an idea that is qualitatively similar to, but\nless forceful and vivacious than a previous idea. But the ability\nto judge qualitative similarity and degrees of force and vivacity\nbetween present ideas and past impressions presupposes memory. \n\nReid provides additional criticisms of Hume’s account of\nmemory. First, Reid interprets Hume’s account of memory as\ncommitting him to the position that we have the power to repeat ideas\n(though notice that Hume does not commit to this in the quoted\npassage). Reid argues that this position is inconsistent with\nHume’s claim that impressions are the efficient causes of\nideas. Reid’s second criticism is more insightful; he\nargues that differences in degrees of force and vivacity are\ninsufficient to sustain the distinctions between perception, memory and\nimagination. Reid interprets Hume as holding that these three\nfaculties do not differ in kind, but rather in the degree of force and\nvivacity of the ideas that are their objects. Ideas with the\ngreatest degree of force and vivacity are perceptions, those with a\nlesser degree are memories, and those with the least degree of force\nand vivacity are imaginings. Reid criticizes this taxonomy on\nphenomenological grounds. Some perceptions are less forceful and\nlively than some memories, as when lost in reminiscence, and some\nmemories are less forceful and lively than imaginings, as when lost in\nreverie. Furthermore, increasing the degree of force and vivacity\ndoes not transform a memory or an imagining into a perception.\nReid compares striking one’s head against the wall to lightly\ntouching it to the wall. The latter has much less force and\nvivacity than the former, yet lightly touching one’s head to the\nwall is neither a memory nor an imagining (Essays, 289). \n\nReid grants that perceptions, memories and imaginings often differ in\ndegree of force and vivacity, but, he argues, this difference is\ninsufficient to account for the special quality of presentness\nrepresented in perceptions, the special quality of pastness\nrepresented in memories, and the special quality of atemporality\nrepresented in imaginings (Inquiry, 197). While memories may\nbe faint, or weak, these features are not necessary to these states\nbeing memories, and so cannot be used to individuate them. In\naddition, a present idea—whatever its degree of force and\nvivacity—cannot ground judgments about events in the past\nbecause present ideas represent events as present. \n\nPresent ideas contain no information, qualitatively or\nrepresentationally, that could serve as the basis of judgments about\npast events. As a result, no reflection on present ideas and\ntheir quality or character is sufficient for a representation of events\nin the past, as past. \n\nContemporary philosophers and cognitive scientists recognize that\nmemory is a diverse phenomenon and they draw some useful distinctions\namong varieties of\n memory.[2]\nFor example, Endel Tulving distinguishes\nbetween episodic memory, semantic memory and procedural memory.\nRemembering how to ride a bike is an example of procedural\nmemory. Remembering that Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo is an\nexample of a semantic memory. Remembering one’s tenth\nbirthday party is an example of an episodic memory. \n\nThe distinction most relevant to the issues Reid, Locke and Hume raise\nfor memory and personal identity is between semantic and episodic\nmemory. Henri Bergson and Bertrand Russell developed a similar\ndistinction, and Russell’s distinction between factual and personal\nmemory accords with that between semantic and episodic memory.\nSemantic memories are properly reported using a factive\ncomplement—a that-clause—after the verbs\n‘remember’ or ‘recall’, as in ‘Jane\nremembers that Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo’. In\nparticular, a semantic memory\ncannot be reported using the form ‘S\nremembers/recalls [x] f-ing’, as in ‘Jane\nrecalls her tenth birthday party,’ or ‘John remembers\nfalling off his bike.’ Only episodic memories may be\nproperly reported using this form. No one today can properly\nreport ‘I remember Napoleon being defeated at Waterloo,’\nthough many may properly report ‘I remember that\nNapoleon was defeated at Waterloo.’ On the other hand, an\nepisodic memory can be reported using the same form by which\nsemantic memories are reported because episodic memories may ground\nsemantic memories under certain circumstances. It is legitimate\nto state both ‘I recall my tenth birthday party,’ in\nreporting an episodic memory of that event and to state ‘I\nremember that I had a tenth birthday party’, in reporting a\nsemantic memory, whose justification would appeal to the previous\nepisodic memory. \n\nEpisodic memories are further distinguished from semantic memories\nby the Previous Awareness Condition on episodic memory. The\nPrevious Awareness Condition has been developed and examined by Sydney\nShoemaker (1970), among\n others.\nPut simply, one has an episodic memory of\nan event only if one was agent or witness to the event\nremembered. The Previous Awareness Condition is a necessary but\ninsufficient condition on episodic memory. If one has an\nexperience as of being lost in a store as a child, but one was not in\nfact lost in a store as a child, such an experience is not an episodic\nmemory. On the other hand, each of us has been agent or witness\nto many events of which we have no episodic memory. For example,\none may not remember one’s third birthday party and so lack an\nepisodic memory of an event to which one was surely witness. \n\nReid is most interested in episodic memory. Though Reid does\nnot use the contemporary terminology, his theory draws upon both the\ndistinction between episodic and semantic memory and the Previous\nAwareness Condition on episodic memory. As he puts the matter: \n\nThough Reid uses the term ‘acquaintance,’ the things\nretained through memory are things previously perceived or\nexperienced. The term ‘acquaintance’ has acquired a\ntechnical sense that it did not have in Reid’s day, so it is\nbetter to see Reid as holding that memory preserves contact with events\npreviously apprehended through perception and thereby known by\nacquaintance. Acquaintance presupposes apprehension, and prior\nepisodes of apprehension are necessary for retained acquaintance. \n\nAccording to Reid, episodic memory is not a current apprehension of a\npast event, nor is it a current apprehension of a past\nexperience. These theoretical options were ruled out by\nReid’s criticism of Locke and Hume. Rather, according to\nReid, memory is an act that preserves a past apprehension. Reid\ncharacterizes memory as exhibiting what we now call the Previous\nAwareness Condition. He holds that reports of episodic memory are\ntrue only if the person reporting satisfies the condition, and that\nexperiences that otherwise appear to be episodic memories, but\nwhich fail the condition, are not episodic memories (Essays,\n264). \n\nReid does not count what we term ‘semantic memories’ as\nmemories in the proper sense. He discounts them not because they fail to\nmeet the Previous Awareness Condition, but because he holds that\nsemantic memories are better classified as beliefs or knowledge rather\nthan memories. For example, he would hold that a person today who\nreports remembering that Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo\nexpresses a belief or knowledge rather than a memory. He holds\nthis because he requires a distinction between two sorts of beliefs\nthat would otherwise be obscured by the fact that each sort can be\nexpressed in the form of a semantic memory report. The distinction is\nbetween beliefs that play a role in preserving past apprehension\n(and which are constituents of episodic memory), and those\nthat do not play a role in preserving past apprehension (and which are\nnot, strictly speaking, memories). For example, Jane believes\nthat she dined with a friend last night. Jane has an episodic\nmemory of this event, and according to Reid, her belief ‘that I\ndined with a friend last night,’ plays a role in preserving\nJane’s past apprehension of dining with her friend. On the\nother hand, Jane’s belief that she had a third birthday party\ndoes not play a role in preserving her past apprehension of her third\nbirthday party; she has no episodic memory of her third birthday\nparty. The difference between these two sorts of belief is\nobscured by the fact that each may be expressed by using the factive\ncompliment: ‘Jane remembers that she dined with a friend\nlast night,’ and ‘Jane remembers that she had a\nthird birthday party.’ \n\nAccording to Reid, a memory consists in a conception of a past event\nand a belief about that past event, that it happened to the person who\nis represented in that memory as agent or witness (Essays,\n228, 232, 254, 257). This conception-belief structure mirrors Reid’s\naccounts of perception and consciousness, each of which also consist\nin a conception and belief. Folescu (2018a) examines whether memorial\nconception differs from or is the same as the kind of conception\ningredient in perception, consciousness, and other intentional mental\nstates. The belief that is a constituent of memory, on Reid’s view, is\na belief of some past event, that it happened. In particular, it is a\nbelief that it happened to me, where the pronoun is indexed to the\nperson who is represented in the memory as agent or witness to the\nevent (Essays, 255, 262). The belief is about\nor of the event because the other constituent of\nmemory—the conception—supplies the event, which is the\nobject of the belief. On Reid’s view, the objects of memory are the\nevents presented in past apprehensions. Memory preserves past\napprehensions by relating us to the events originally presented in\nperception—memory preserves past apprehension through conception\nand belief. In particular, the objects of memory are not the past\napprehensions themselves but that which is presented in the past\napprehensions, namely, the original event (Inquiry,\n28). Folescu (2018b) examines a tension in Reid’s accounts of memory\nand perception. According to Reid, we remember events that were\napprehended in the past by perception. But Reid insists that\nperception is confined to the present. Because perception is confined\nto the present, we cannot perceive events, which have a duration. How,\nthen, can we remember what we cannot have perceived?  \n\nReid holds that memory is not a current apprehension of an event\nalready presented in a past apprehension. In other words, we do\nnot remember events by re-apprehending them. Rather, the\npast apprehension is itself preserved by the act of remembering the\nevent apprehended. Memory is an act of preservation through\nconception and belief. Such preservation does not itself\nconstitute an additional apprehension over and above the\napprehension preserved. Indeed, according to Reid, it is\nimpossible to currently apprehend any events in the past; apprehension\nis confined to perceiving present objects or being conscious of present\nmental operations (Essays, 23, 253). Reid does not deny\nthat memory is itself a current mental state, nor does he deny that\nmemory presupposes a past apprehension. He denies only that\nmemory is a current apprehension, and that the object of a memory is a\npast apprehension (Essays, 253). Memory preserves past\napprehension by conceiving of an event previously apprehended and\nbelieving, of this event, that it happened to me. \n\nReid holds that memory, like perception, is immediate. Neither\nthe conception nor the belief that are the ingredients of memory are\nformed on the basis of reasoning or testimony. Memory is an\noriginal faculty of our constitution governed by what Reid calls\n“the first principles of contingent truths.” In the\ncase of memory, the governing principle is that “those things did\nreally happen which I distinctly remember” (Essays,\n474). On Reid’s view, a normally functioning human does not\nand need not infer to a past event in episodic memory. In order\nto infer to a past event, one must have some prior, non-inferential\nrelation to the event if it is to be a memory rather than a belief or\nknowledge. But then this prior, non-inferential relation would be\nan episodic memory. In addition, if episodic memory involved an\ninference to the effect that the event happened to me, the inference\nwould be otiose because, as Reid claims, such a belief is already an\nimmediate, non-inferential component of episodic memory. In\nprinciple, one could infer from the conception and belief that are\ningredients in memory to a further belief that the event\nhappened. But if such a belief plays a role in preserving past\napprehension then it is superfluous—such a belief, subject to\nthe Previous Awareness Condition, is already embedded in episodic\nmemory. If the belief does not play a role in preserving past\napprehension then it is a semantic memory, which, according to Reid, is\namong the species of belief or knowledge rather memory. \n\nThe distinction between beliefs that are ingredients in episodic\nmemories and beliefs that are based on, but not ingredients in,\nepisodic memories allows Reid to account for cases in which a memorial\nexperience continues to represent an event as having happened, even\nwhen the person who seems to remember the event has what she regards as\nan overriding reason to believe that the event did not occur. The\nbelief that is an ingredient in the experience represents the event as\nhaving happened to the person who seems to remember it. Further, the\nbelief will continue to represent the event as having happened to the\nperson, even under conditions in which she forms a separate belief, not\nembedded in the memorial experience, to the effect that it did not\nhappen to her. \n\nThe distinction also allows Reid to satisfy a constraint on any\nadequate theory of memory; namely, that it explain why memory\nrepresents events as having the special quality of being in the\npast. If belief were not an ingredient in episodic memory, then\nthough we might believe that the events we remember are in the\npast, memory could not represent events as past. If\nbelief were not an ingredient in memory, then memory alone would relate\nus to an event previously apprehended. But the apprehension\npreserved is an apprehension of an event that was, at that time,\nrepresented in that apprehension as present. The pastness of the\nevent apprehended is not part of the content of the past\napprehension. But because a belief that the event happened to me\nis embedded in the memory itself, memory represents not merely past\nevents, but past events as having occurred. In other words, the\nbelief that is partly constitutive of episodic memory is tensed. \n\nOne might wonder whether Reid’s account of memory is subject to the\nsame criticisms he levels against Locke and Hume. Does Reid appeal to\nthe storehouse metaphor when he claims that memory is preserved past\napprehension? Reid criticizes Locke and Hume for begging the\nquestion. Yet by holding that memory is in part constituted by a\nbelief, does Reid not also assume the very phenomenon to be explained?\nReid can avoid the criticisms to which the theory of ideas is\nvulnerable by insisting that memory is not a current apprehension, but\nrather a preserved past apprehension. His theory of memory is a direct\nrealist theory because, according to Reid, memory is not directed\ntowards any present perceptions, ideas, or impressions—stored or\notherwise. Neither is memory directed towards any past perceptions,\nideas, or impressions—stored or otherwise. Memory is directed\ntowards the events presented in past apprehensions. Because\napprehensions, perceptions, ideas, and impressions are never the\nobjects of memory, they do not need to be stored for use by\nmemory. Likewise, the belief that is an ingredient in memory is not\nabout any present or past apprehensions. If it were, Reid’s theory\nwould be subject to the same circularity objection he presses against\nLocke and Hume. \n\nOn Reid’s theory of memory, an apprehension establishes a\ndirect relation to an event, which relation is preserved in memory by\nthe acts of conceiving the event and believing of the event conceived\nthat it happened to the person who remembers. It is a direct\nrealist theory of memory because it departs from the model on which\nmemory is a current apprehension of a past event or a current\napprehension of a past apprehension. On the direct realist view,\nmemory preserves past apprehension of an event through conception and\nbelief. Reid’s theory captures how memory, like perception,\nrepresents the world, rather than our experiences of the world. \n\nReid, Locke and others are interested in the notion of episodic memory\nnot only for its own sake, but also because of its conceptual\nconnection to the notion of personal identity. If Joe remembers,\nepisodically, winning the World Series, then Joe must have existed at\nthe time of his winning the World Series. This is why the Previous\nAwareness Condition characterizes episodic but not semantic\nmemory. Unlike Joe’s memory that Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo,\nhis memory of winning the World Series logically entails Joe’s\nexistence at the time of the event remembered. In other words,\nepisodic memory is logically sufficient for personal identity: if\nS remembers at time tn\n(episodically) an event at time t1, then\nS existed at time t1. In addition, memory\nreports are often taken to be prima facie evidence for\nstatements about the past history of the person reporting. \n\nReid’s main criticism of Locke’s theory of personal identity is that\nLocke moves from these truisms concerning the conceptual and\nevidential relations among the notions of memory and personal identity\nto a hypothesis concerning the metaphysical relations among them\n(Essays, 277). In this, Reid follows Butler’s influential\ndissertation “Of Personal Identity,” appended to The\nAnalogy of Religion in 1736. \n\nReid interprets\nLocke as holding what is now called the Memory Theory of personal\nidentity (Essays, 277). On this theory, personal\nidentity consists in memory; sameness of episodic memory is\nmetaphysically necessary and sufficient for sameness of persons.\nIn other words, on the Memory Theory, what makes a person\nidentical with herself over time is her remembering or being able to\nremember the events to which she was witness or agent. If she\ncannot episodically remember an event, then she is not identical with\nany of the persons who was witness or agent to the event. In such\na case, she would bear the same relation to that event as any other\nperson for whom a memory of the event could rise at best to the level\nof a semantic memory. If she can episodically remember an event,\nthen her recollection or ability to recall that event makes her\nidentical with the person represented in that memory as agent or\nwitness to the event. \n\nBut there is a secondary, more subtle line of disagreement between\nReid and Locke. Much of Locke’s chapter Identity and\nDiversity is dedicated to establishing that the self is not a\nsubstance, material or immaterial. By contrast, Reid holds that\nthe self is a simple, unanalyzable immaterial substance with active\npowers. Reid argues that Locke cannot sustain both the thesis\nthat the self is not a substance and the thesis that self remains\nidentical over time. While Reid’s criticisms of the Memory\nTheory are more well known, his criticism of Locke’s insistence\nthat the self is not a substance reveals two very different accounts of\nthe metaphysics of identity. While Locke argues that the identity\nconditions for different kinds of things differ, so that the conditions\nunder which a mass of matter, and an animal, and a person are not the\nsame, Reid holds that identity is confined solely to substances that\nhave a continued, uninterrupted existence and which do not have\nparts. In other words, according to Reid, strictly speaking the\nonly real identity is personal identity (Essays,\n266–267). “The identity…we ascribe to bodies,\nwhether natural or artificial, is not perfect identity; it is rather\nsomething which, for the conveniency of speech, we call identity”\n(Essays, 266). \n\nReid begins his interpretation and criticism of Locke’s theory\nby noting that Locke defines the term ‘person’ as meaning\n“a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and\nreflection…” (Locke Essay, Book\nII.xxvii.9). Reid is friendly to this characterization of the\nself. But, Reid notes, Locke appears to equivocate between the\nnotion of a person as a ‘thinking Being,’ and the notion of\na person as that which is preserved through consciousness and\nmemory. Reid paraphrases a passage from Locke’s Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding: \n\nThe passage in Locke differs from Reid’s paraphrase: \n\nReid’s first criticism rests on his interpreting Locke’s\ndefinition as committing him to the position that a person is a subject\nof thought, which Reid regards as implying that a person is a thinking\nsubstance. At the same time, Locke appears to be committed to an\nanalysis of personal identity in terms of memory, or, as Locke would\nput it, consciousness of the past. Reid notes that Locke is aware\nof some of the consequences of the Memory Theory: if sameness of\nconsciousness or memory is necessary and sufficient for sameness of\nperson, then it is possible for there to be sameness of person without\nsameness of thinking Being. In other words, it is logically and\nmetaphysically possible for a person to be “transferred from one\nintelligent being to another,” or for “two or twenty\nintelligent beings to be the same person” (Essays,\n276). Locke’s response to these worries, as well as worries\nabout periods of interrupted consciousness, as in sleep, highlights\nReid’s criticism: “…[I]n all these\ncases…doubts are raised whether we are the same thinking thing;\ni.e. the same substance or no. Which however reasonable,\nor unreasonable, concerns not personal Identity at all.\nThe Question being what makes the same Person, and not whether\nit be the same Identical Substance…” (Locke,\nEssay, Book II.xxvii.10). Reid’s criticism is not\nthat cases of transfer or fission are incoherent, though he thinks they\nare. Rather, his criticism is that the possibility of sameness of\nperson without sameness of thinking Being that the Memory Theory allows is\ninconsistent with Locke’s characterization of a person as a\n‘thinking Being’. Given that Reid thinks that this\ninitial characterization is correct, he regards this as a\nreductio of the Memory Theory. \n\nReid’s second criticism is his most famous and is often\nreferred to as the case of the Brave Officer: \n\nAccording to the Memory Theory, personal identity consists in\nmemory; that is, sameness of memory is metaphysically necessary and\nsufficient for sameness of person. On this account, given that\nsameness of memory is sufficient for sameness of person, if a person\nat time tn remembers (episodically) an\nevent that occurred at time t1 then the person at\ntime tn is identical with the person who\nwas witness or agent to the event at time t1. If\nthe brave officer who has just taken the flag of the enemy remembers\nbeing beaten at school, then the brave officer is identical with the\nboy who was beaten. So too, if the general remembers taking the\nenemy’s flag, then the general is identical with the brave officer. If\nthe general is identical with the brave officer, and the brave officer\nis identical with the boy, then by the transitivity of identity, the\ngeneral is identical with the boy. \n\nHowever, on this account, given that sameness of memory is a necessary\ncondition for sameness of person, if a person at time\ntn does not remember (episodically) an\nevent that occurred at time t1, then the person at\ntime tn cannot be identical with any\nperson who was witness or agent to the event at time\nt1. If the general cannot remember being beaten at\nschool, he cannot be identical with the boy who was beaten. Thus, the\nMemory Theory is committed to mutually incompatible theses: that the\nGeneral is identical with the boy and that he is not. \n\nReid’s third criticism is terminological: he argues that Locke\nconfounds consciousness with memory—elsewhere Reid also argues\nthat Locke confounds consciousness with reflection (Essays,\n58). Consciousness and memory are distinct phenomena, according\nto Reid. The former is directed towards present mental acts and\noperations, while the latter is directed towards past events to which\none was agent or witness. If consciousness could extend to past\nevents, then memory would be redundant (Essays, 277). \n\nAccording to Reid, memory is neither necessary nor sufficient for\npersonal identity, metaphysically speaking, despite the conceptual and\nevidential relations memory bears to personal identity. It is not a\nnecessary condition because each us has been agent or witness to many\nevents that we do not now remember. “I may have other good\nevidence of things which befell me, and which I do not remember: I\nknow who bare me, and suckled me, but I do not remember these\nevents” (Essays, 264). It is not a sufficient\ncondition, for, as Butler showed, while having an episodic memory of\nan event entails that one existed at the time of the event remembered,\nit is not the recollection or the ability to recall that\nmakes one identical with the person who was witness or agent\nto the event.  “It may here be observed…that it is not my\nremembering any action of mine that makes be to be the person who did\nit. This remembrance makes me know assuredly that I did it; but I\nmight have done it, though I did not remember it”\n(Essays, 265). Reid’s fourth criticism is that while memory\nis tied to personal identity conceptually and evidentially, such ties\ndo not entail a metaphysical connection that would license analyzing\nthe latter in terms of the former (Essays, 277). \n\nReid’s final criticism is that the Memory Theory is committed to the\nabsurdity that identity consists in something that has no continued\nexistence (Essays, 278). Reid and Locke agree that memory,\nconsciousness, thought, and other mental operations have no continued\nexistence. They are fleeting and non-continuous. But they also agree\nthat identity, and in particular personal identity, requires a\ncontinued existence over time. As Locke puts it, “one thing\ncannot have two beginnings of Existence, nor two things one\nbeginning” (Locke, Essay, Book II.xxvii.1). But these\ncommitments are jointly inconsistent with the thesis that personal\nidentity consists in memory. \n\nA theory of personal identity is intended to account for how a\nperson remains identical over time. When analyzed in terms of\nitems that are fleeting and non-continuous—ideas, memories,\nthoughts—identity is reduced to diversity; that is, it is\neliminated. By contrast, if one locates personal identity in that\nwhich thinks and remembers, and which has a continued, uninterrupted\nexistence, one purchases personal identity at the cost of admitting\nthat the self is a substance. Reid captures Locke on the horns of\na dilemma: either the self is a substance, in which case it remains\nidentical over time, or the self is not a substance, in which case\nthere is no personal identity. Reid holds that this dilemma\napplies with equal force against any reductionist account of personal\nidentity that employs the theory of ideas, for example Hume’s\nbundle theory of the self (Essays, 473–474). \n\nThose familiar with the contemporary literature on personal identity,\nwith its emphasis on the necessary and sufficient conditions under\nwhich a person remains identical over time, may wonder: if Reid holds\nthat memory is not the criterion of identity, and if Reid’s substance\ndualism rules out bodily identity as a criterion of personal\nidentity, in what does personal identity consist? Reid’s\nanswer is that identity cannot be accounted for in any terms other\nthan itself. This is neither quietism nor epistemic humility on Reid’s\npart. Rather, Reid argues that the nature of personal\nidentity—its simplicity and indivisibility—rules out any\nreductive account that appeals to notions other than identity in\nexplaining how a person persists over time. \n\nReid holds that numerical identity is, strictly speaking,\nindefinable, but it can be contrasted with other relations, such as\ndiversity, similarity and dissimilarity (Essays, 263). It\nrequires a continued existence over time—a duration—and\nrequires that there be no two beginnings of existence. Because\nmental states are fleeting and non-continuous they cannot remain\nidentical over time. A mental state may be indistinguishable from\na previous mental state, but because mental states do not have a\ncontinued existence, no mental state at one time can be numerically\nidentical with another at a different time. As a result, persons\ncannot be identified with their thoughts, actions or feelings\n(Essays, 264). However, according to Reid, thoughts,\nactions, feelings and all other mental operations are had or performed\nby a subject that has a continued existence and that bears the same\nrelation to all them. The subject is an immaterial substance that\nthinks, acts and feels. According to Reid, this substantial self\nhas no parts—it is indivisible—which contributes to its\nresistance to reductive explanation. Reid appeals to\nLeibniz’s notion of a monad to describe the\nindivisibility of this immaterial, substantial self (Essays,\n264). \n\nThough memory is not the metaphysical ground of personal identity,\nit provides first-personal evidence of it. Reid notes that the\nevidence we use to make judgments about our own pasts is different from\nthe evidence we use to make judgments about other people and their\npasts (Essays 266). Memory justifies first-personal\nreports about one’s own witnessed past, while judgments of\nqualitative similarity justify third-personal statements about the\nidentities of other persons. I know that I was present at my\nwedding because I remember being there. I know that the man I\nlive with was at my wedding because he looks like the man I\nmarried. \n\nFirst-personal, memorial reports about one’s own past are\neither true or false: if the memorial experience is a genuine episodic\nmemory, then it is impossible for it to testify falsely concerning\none’s presence at the event remembered. This aspect of\nepisodic memory reports is often expressed by saying that they are\nimmune to error through misidentification. If the memorial\nexperience testifies falsely concerning one’s presence at the\nevent remembered, then it cannot be an episodic memory. For\nexample, if I have an experience as of having been lost in a shopping\nmall as a child, but I was never lost, I cannot be said to remember\nhaving been lost, strictly speaking. The upshot is that\nfirst-personal memorial reports, if they are episodic memory reports,\nprovide certainty concerning one’s presence at the event\nremembered. Because third-personal judgments about the pasts of\nother persons are based on judgments of qualitative similarity rather\nthan episodic memory, they are never certain; they are only ever more\nor less well justified (Essays 264–265). \n\nIt is important to notice that while Reid uses the term\n‘evidence,’ when describing the role that memory plays in\nfirst-personal knowledge of one’s own past, memory is not\nused by persons to justify judgments or beliefs about their\nown pasts. In other words, people do not remember events and then\nconclude from having remembered them, that it was\nthey who were witness to the events. Rather, memory\nitself represents one’s presence at the event remembered.\nAccording to Reid, a memory consists in a conception of an event and a\nbelief, about the event conceived, that it happened to me, where the\npronoun is indexed to the person who is represented in the memory as\nagent or witness. In other words, memory consists in part in a\njudgment that represents one’s presence at the event. Any\nfurther judgment, justified by memory, to the effect that I\nwas the person who was there would be superfluous—memory\nalready testifies to my having been there. This is why Reid calls\nthe evidence of memory immediate: first-personal statements\nabout one’s own past are memory statements, not statements made\non the basis of memory. \n\nReid’s picture is one on which each of us is immediately and\njustifiably aware of our own past because each of us remembers\nhaving been there. This is the moral of the story concerning the\nlogical relationship between the concept of memory and the concept of\npersonal identity. Memories do not make me the same\nperson as the person represented in my memories. Rather, memories\nallow me to know my own past, immediately and directly.","contact.mail":"rebeccac@lclark.edu","contact.domain":"lclark.edu"}]
