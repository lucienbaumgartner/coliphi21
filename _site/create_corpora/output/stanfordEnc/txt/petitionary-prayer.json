When people\npray, they attempt to communicate with special persons or entities,\nsuch as a God or gods, or dead relatives, or exemplary human beings\nwho are believed to occupy some special status.\n\n\nPeople pray for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes people pray in order\nto give thanks, sometimes to offer praise and adoration, sometimes to\napologize and seek forgiveness, and sometimes to ask for things. The\nfocus of this article is petitionary prayer, in which a petitioner\nrequests something. Historically, the most interesting philosophical\npuzzles concerning petitionary prayer have arisen in connection with\nthe traditional monotheism shared by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nAccording to traditional monotheism, God is omniscient (knows\neverything that can be known), omnibenevolent (perfectly good),\nomnipotent (can do everything that is compatible with the other\nattributes mentioned above), impassible (unable to be affected by an\noutside source), immutable (unchanging), and free. In this article, we\nwill explore the most prominent philosophical puzzles that arise in\nconnection with the idea of offering petitionary prayers to God, as\nunderstood along the lines just described, along with the most\ninfluential attempts to solve them. (For a more complete inventory of\nthese puzzles and attempts to resolve them, see Davison 2017.) \n\nWhat would it mean to say that a petitionary prayer to God had been\neffective? Petitionary prayers often make a difference to those who\noffer them (see Phillips 1981 and Brümmer 2008), but the more\ninteresting question is whether or not such prayers make a difference\nto God. And the question is not whether God simply hears or notices\nsuch prayers—after all, we have assumed that God knows\neverything that happens in the world and is perfectly good. Typically,\nwhen philosophers discuss the effectiveness of petitionary prayer,\nthey wonder whether petitionary prayers ever move God to act. What\nwould it mean to say this? \nPhilosophers usually assume that a prayer is effective if and only if\nGod brings about the thing requested because of the prayer, so that\nhad the prayer not been offered, the thing in question would not have\noccurred. So if you pray to God for rain tomorrow and it does rain\ntomorrow, this all by itself is not enough to say that your prayer for\nrain was effective—it must also be the case that God actually\nbrought about the rain at least in part because of your prayer. If it\nwould have rained anyway, without your prayer for rain, then it\ndoesn’t seem that your prayer for rain was effective. So an\neffective prayer would be a prayer that made a difference by\ninfluencing God to act. (For more on this question, see Flint 1998,\nchapter 10, and Davison 2017, chapter 2.) \nAs mentioned above, traditional theists believe that God is immutable\n(cannot change) and impassible (cannot be affected by anything\nexternal). These ideas are related to one another, but not identical:\nif God is immutable, then God is impassible. But just because God is\nimpassible, it does not follow that God is immutable—God might\nbe able to change without being affected by any external source. If\nGod is both immutable and impassible, then it seems that no\npetitionary prayers are effective.  \nA number of responses are open to traditional theists at this point.\nSome theists have argued that there are independent reasons for saying\nthat God is neither immutable nor impassible. For example, many people\nhave argued that God is both compassionate and forgiving. But to be\ncompassionate or forgiving seems to require being responsive to the\nactions of others, so perhaps we should not say that God is immutable\nor impassible after all (see the entry on\n concepts of God).\n  \nA different response to the puzzle here would involve characterizing\nthe concepts of divine immutability and impassibility so that they\napply to God in a way that does not rule out the effectiveness of\npetitionary prayers. This is an interesting philosophical project in\nits own right (see the discussions in Creel 1985 and the entries on\n Concepts of God\n and\n immutability),\n but its prospects for success fall beyond the scope of this\narticle. \nFinally, a third response would involve claiming that in cases of\napparently effective prayer, God is not really responding to the\nprayer but instead bringing about events as part of a providential\nplan, a plan that includes both the prayer and the apparent answer to\nit. Such a position is suggested by the following remark from St.\nThomas Aquinas: “We pray not in order to change the divine\ndisposition but for the sake of acquiring by petitionary prayer what\nGod has disposed to be achieved by prayer (quoted and discussed at\nlength in Stump 1979).” Given the way that we have characterized\neffective prayer above, though, this approach seems to deny that\npetitionary prayers are effective, so it would not solve the problem\nat hand.  \nA different puzzle concerning the effectiveness of petitionary prayer\narises in connection with divine omniscience, the idea that God knows\neverything that can be known. If God already knows the future, for\ninstance, then how can petitionary prayer make a difference? The\nfuture, after all, is just the set of things that will happen. If God\nknows the future in all of its detail, then it seems that there is no\nroom for petitionary prayers to be effective: either the thing\nrequested in prayer is something that God already knows will be done,\nor it isn’t, and either way, it looks like the prayer can make\nno difference. Like many other questions in theology, this puzzle\nraises an interesting question about the limits of God’s\nknowledge. Is it possible for anyone, including God, to know the\nfuture in all of its detail? Philosophers disagree sharply about this.\nHere we will explore briefly three possible answers to this question.\n(For more on this, see Borland 2006 (Other Internet Resources) and the\nentries on\n omniscience\n and\n prophecy.) \nFirst, according to the view known as “open theism,” God\ncannot know those parts of the future that are yet to be determined,\nsuch as the future free actions of human beings, either because there\nare no truths to be known yet or because there is no way for anyone,\nincluding God, to know them (see Hasker 1989, Rissler 2006, Other\nInternet Resources). This does not mean the God is not omniscient,\naccording to open theists, because God still knows everything that can\nbe known (and that is what it means to be omniscient). So open theists\nhave a way to defuse the puzzle for petitionary prayer involving\nomniscience concerning the future: if our prayers are free, or\nGod’s decision whether or not to answer them is free (or both),\nthen those things cannot be part of a determined future and God cannot\nknow about them in advance. But open theism is controversial because\n(among other things: see Rissler 2006) it appears to deny something\nthat theists have affirmed traditionally, namely, that God knows the\nfuture in all of its detail. \nSecond, there something called the “middle knowledge”\nview. This positions hold that God knows the future in all of its\ndetail as a result of knowing both (1) what everyone and everything\nwould do in any possible situation and (2) which situations everyone\nand everything will be placed in actually (see Flint 1998). According\nto this picture, God knows the future in all of its detail, but what\nGod knows about the future free choices of human beings depends on\nwhat they would choose—and that is something that is up to the\nhuman beings in question, not up to God. Even though God knows what\nyou will do in the future, according to this picture, it is still up\nto you. In fact, when you make a free choice, you have the ability to\ndo something such that were you to do it, God would have always known\nsomething different from what he knows in fact. (This is often called\nhaving “counterfactual power” with respect to God’s\nknowledge: see Flint 1998.) \nAccording to the proponents of middle knowledge, then, petitionary\nprayer can still make a difference because God can take into account\nthose prayers that be offered in the future when God plans how to\ncreate the world over time. The mere fact that God knows the future in\nall of its detail does not mean that this future is determined. So the\nproponents of middle knowledge have a way to answer the puzzle\nconcerning omniscience. But the theory of middle knowledge is very\ncontroversial; critics wonder whether there are truths about what\neveryone and everything would do in every situation, and even if there\nwere, how God could know such things (see the entry on\n prophecy.)\n and Zagzebski 2011). \nFinally, defenders of a view called “timeless eternity”\nhold that God knows all of history at once, from a point of view\noutside of time altogether (see the entry on\n eternity.)\n Like the proponents of middle knowledge, the defenders of timeless\neternity will say that just because God knows the future, this does\nnot mean that God determines it. They will also say that God’s\nsingle act of creation from outside of time has many effects in time,\nincluding, perhaps, answers to prayers that God anticipates from the\npoint of view of eternity. In this way, the defenders of timeless\neternity can answer the puzzle concerning omniscience. But like open\ntheism and the theory of middle knowledge, the idea that God is\ntimelessly eternal is controversial too (see Hasker 1989 and Zagzebski\n2011). \nIt is worth noting, in this section, that some philosophers have\nargued that not only does it make sense to pray for the future if God\nexists, but also it makes sense to pray for the past as\nwell—such prayers could be effective, depending on the extent of\nGod’s knowledge. For example, given the way we have described\neffective petitionary prayer, it could be possible for a prayer for\nsomething to have happened yesterday to be effective, as long as the\nthing in question actually did happen yesterday. This is because God\ncould know that I would offer the prayer in the future, and could have\ntaken this into account yesterday, as long as God can know the future.\nSo defenders of middle knowledge and timeless eternity can say that\nprayers for the past might be effective (but open theists, it seems,\ncannot say this: for more on this question, see Timpe 2005). \nTheists have traditionally recognized a number of limits on\nGod’s actions. For instance, it is common to insist that\nGod’s omnipotence does not imply that God can do impossible\nthings, such as create stones that are too heavy for God to lift. It\nis also common to insist that God cannot do that which is\nintrinsically evil, because God is morally perfect. (For a discussion\nof petitionary prayers for bad things, see Smilansky 2012.) Since God\nis provident, one might also suspect that God would not answer\npetitionary prayers for things that would interfere with God’s\nprovidential plans for the world. Within these limits, one might\nwonder whether there is enough room among the space of God’s\nreasons for petitionary prayers to make a difference, and what kinds\nof reasons such prayers could provide for God. \nSome have argued that God’s moral perfection implies that\npetitionary prayers cannot make a difference because God will do what\nis best for everyone whether or not anyone ever offers petitionary\nprayers for those things. If this were so, then it would seem that\npetitionary prayers are never effective in the sense described\nabove. \nIn response to this worry, a number of authors have suggested that it\nwould be better, in some cases, for God to bring certain things about\nin response to petitionary prayers than to bring about those same\nthings independently of any such requests. In order to explore this\nidea, it is helpful to draw a distinction. Sometimes people pray for\nthemselves, and sometimes they pray for others. Let’s call the\nfirst kind of prayer “self-directed,” and let’s call\nthe second kind of prayer “other-directed.” \nFirst, consider self-directed prayers. Eleonore Stump argues that in\nsome cases, God waits for us to ask for something before granting it\nin order to avoid spoiling or overwhelming us. We could be spoiled by\nGod if God answered all of our prayers automatically, and we could be\noverwhelmed by God if God provided everything good for us without\nwaiting for us to ask first (Stump 1979). In a similar vein, Michael\nMurray and Kurt Meyers argue that by making the provision of certain\nthings dependent on petitionary prayer, God helps us to avoid\nidolatry, which is a sense of complete self-sufficiency that fails to\nrecognize God as the source of all good things. They also say that\nrequiring petitionary prayer in some cases helps us to learn about\nGod’s will as we recognize the patterns in prayers answered (and\nnot answered: see Murray and Meyers 1994 and section 5 below). \nSecond, consider other-directed prayers. Murray and Meyers argue that\nif God makes the provision of certain things for others dependent on\nour prayers for them, then this can help to build interdependence and\ncommunity (Murray and Meyers 1994). By contrast, Richard Swinburne and\nDaniel and Frances Howard-Snyder argue that by requiring petitionary\nprayers in some cases, God gives us more responsibility for the\nwell-being of ourselves and others than we would enjoy otherwise\n(Swinburne 1998, Howard-Snyder and Howard-Snyder 2011). Critics of\nthis approach have wondered whether this involves God using others as\na means to an end (Basinger 1983) or whether this really extends our\nresponsibility for others (Davison 2017, chapter 7). \nFinally, some philosophers (for example, Basinger 2004) note that\nthere are a number of ways to understand God’s obligations\ntoward created persons, only some of which suggest that God’s\ngoodness would be compromised if God withheld things because\npetitionary prayers were not offered. So there are a number of\nresponses that theists can make to the puzzle of petitionary prayer\nthat stems from divine moral perfection. (For more on this question,\nsee Davison 2017, chapter 6.) \nWould it ever be possible to know or reasonably believe that God has\nanswered a particular petitionary prayer? Different authors disagree\nabout this question. Some theists think that for all we know, for any\nparticular event that happens, God may have had independent reasons\nfor bringing it about, so we cannot know whether or not God has\nbrought it about because of a prayer (as opposed to bringing it about\nfor some other reason—for more on this argument, see Basinger\n2004 and Davison 2017, chapter 4). This line of thought is especially\ninteresting in light of the recent popularity of so-called skeptical\ntheism, which responds to the problem of evil by claiming that we can\nnever know exactly how particular events are connected with each other\nand with good or bad consequences, some of which may be beyond our\nunderstanding (see McBrayer 2010, Other Internet Resources). Others\nargue that as long as people are justified in believing, in general\nterms, that God sometimes answers prayers, then it is possible to\nbelieve reasonably that one’s petitionary prayer has been\nanswered when one knows that the thing requested has come to pass (see\nMurray and Meyers 1994, Murray 2004). \nA number of people have tried to conduct statistical studies to\ndetermine whether or not petitionary prayer is effective. These\nstudies try to measure the differences between groups of people, one\nof which is the subject of petitionary prayers, and the other of which\nis not. Although some earlier studies suggested a positive correlation\nbetween patient recovery and petitionary prayer (see Byrd 1998;\nHarris, et al. 1999; and Leibovici 2001), more recent studies\nhave suggested that the offering of petitionary prayer (and the\nknowledge that such prayers were offered) is not positively correlated\nwith patient recovery (see Benson et al. 2006). \nSome have suggested, though, that these kinds of studies are flawed\nfrom the outset (see Brümmer 2008 and Davison 2017, chapter 5).\nIt would be difficult to to ensure that some group of people is the\nsubject of no petitionary prayers, for instance, since it is\nimpossible to prevent people from praying for those whom they know.\nAlso, God is typically assumed to be a free person, not a natural\nforce that acts automatically in all similar cases, so we cannot\nassume that God will simply ignore those people for whom petitionary\nprayers have not been offered. This means that even if a study showed\nsome statistically significant difference between the two groups of\npeople, we could not be sure that it was due to the offering of\npetitionary prayers alone, as opposed to some other factor or factors.\n","contact.mail":"s.davison@moreheadstate.edu","contact.domain":"moreheadstate.edu"}]
