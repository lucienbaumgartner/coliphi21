Surely if anything\nmatters in our attempts to understand law, it matters how judges do\nand/or should decide cases, and that we have an account which\nadequately explains and can perhaps be used to guide or justify their activities.\nThe recent history of legal philosophy abounds with many and various\nattempts to address these issues and others which have been viewed as\nfalling within the ambit of legal reasoning. Is legal reasoning an\nactivity which is exclusive to the adjudicative institutions of legal\nsystems or is any reasoning about the law to be regarded as legal\nreasoning, no matter where or by whom it is undertaken? Does legal\nreasoning take on a special character when it is undertaken in courts\nand by judges? Are there special methods or modes of reasoning which\nare unique to or at least distinctive of the law, or is legal reasoning\njust like reasoning in any other sphere of human activity, distinctive\nonly in the subject matter to which it is applied? This last question\nis particularly relevant to present concerns, as it is one task of this\nentry to discuss various views concerning whether and to what extent\ninterpretation and coherence have a special role to play in legal\nreasoning, because of the nature of law itself. \n\n\n\nAfter a brief clarificatory consideration of the ambit of the term,\n‘legal reasoning’, the entry deals first with\ninterpretation and then with coherence, and discusses various views\nconcerning these concepts and their relevance for law. Throughout, the\ndiscussion focuses upon the role which interpretation and coherence\nplay within legal reasoning, and the reasons why these concepts are\nregarded by some as being distinctive of reasoning about the law.\n\n\n\nThis may seem like an easy question, for surely legal reasoning is\nsimply reasoning about the law, or about how judges should decide\ncases. On closer inspection, however, our ease may evaporate, for both\nof these formulations are ambiguous, at least according to some ways of\nthinking about the law.  Some legal theorists regard the questions,\n‘what is the law?’, and ‘how should judges decide\ncases?’ as distinct questions with distinct answers (see e.g.\nHart 1994; Kelsen 1967; Raz 1979 & 1994). That is to say, their\naccounts of law and their accounts of adjudication are not one and the\nsame, and they contend that in settling disputes which come before\nthem, the remit of judges is wider than merely trying to establish what\nthe law is as regards the issues in the case at hand. In adjudication,\nsuch theorists claim, extra-legal considerations can come into play,\nand judges may have discretion to modify existing law or to fill in\ngaps where existing law is indeterminate. This being so, for some legal\ntheorists, the first formulation above, that legal reasoning is\nreasoning about the law, is ambiguous between: (a) reasoning to\nestablish the content of the law as it presently exists, and (b)\nreasoning from that content to the decision which a court should reach\nin a case which comes before it.  \n\nMoreover, the second formulation of the ambit of legal reasoning\ngiven above, i.e. that legal reasoning is about how judges should\ndecide cases, is also ambiguous on some approaches to legal theory.\nThis is because the answer to the question, “how should a court\ndecide a case, reasoning from the existing law applicable to it?”\n(i.e. legal reasoning in the sense given in (b) above) and the answer\nto the question, “how should a court decide a case, all things\nconsidered?”, may sometimes come apart. A particular instance\nmight be the kind of situation which could arise for a judge in a\n‘wicked’ legal system where the law on some issue is so\nmorally odious that, all things considered, the judge should not decide\nthe case according to the law at all, but rather should refuse to apply\nthe law (see Hart 1958; Hart 1994, chapter 9, section 3; Raz 1994,\nessay 14. This possibility is also noted by Dworkin 1986, chapter 3,\n101–108, in discussing whether the Nazis had law). \n\nThere are thus three things (at least, there may be others) which\nlegal theorists could mean by legal reasoning: (a) reasoning to\nestablish the existing content of the law on a given issue, (b)\nreasoning from the existing content of the law to the decision which a\ncourt should reach in a case involving that issue which comes before\nit, and (c) reasoning about the decision which a court should reach in\na case, all things considered. \n\nIt should be noted that some legal theorists, most notably for\npresent purposes Ronald Dworkin, do not carve up the questions and\nissues on this topic in the way outlined above. For Dworkin, when\njudges decide a case according to law, they do no more than ascertain\nthe content of the law and apply it to the facts of the case. In other\nwords, judges never resort to extra-legal considerations in deciding\ncases according to law: all the considerations which they are entitled\nto take into account are part of the law. This means that, according to\nDworkin, when judges reason about the law in sense (b), what they are\ndoing amounts to no more nor less than reasoning about the law in sense\n(a), i.e. reasoning to establish the content of the law (see Dworkin\n1977 & 1986). \n\nThis entry is concerned with legal reasoning in senses (a) and (b),\nand with sense (b) in particular. It should be noted that the\ndiscussion does not directly address the different accounts of the\nnature and limits of law which are revealed by those varying views\nmentioned above regarding what it is that judges do when they reason\nabout the law in sense (b). Where such differences have a bearing upon\nissues pertaining to the role of interpretation and coherence in legal\nreasoning, they will be mentioned in the text. For further discussion\nof the nature and limits of law, see various entries under nature\nof law in this volume. \n\nRecent interest in the role of interpretation in legal reasoning\nsprings from several sources. For some, interpretation is where we\nshould look in order to find the solution, or at least the only\npossible response, to the problem of linguistic indeterminacy in law\nwhich they perceive (in turn, renewed interest in the problems of\nlinguistic indeterminacy in law seems to have stemmed at least in part\nfrom the resurgence in the last twenty years in scholarship addressing\nWittgenstein's remarks on rule-following in the Philosophical\nInvestigations (see e.g. Holtzman & Leich (eds.) 1981; Kripke\n1982; Baker & Hacker, 1984 & 1985), and the migration of these\nconcerns from philosophy of language into philosophy of law (see e.g.\nMarmor 1992 and the revised edition of that work, Marmor 2005; Stone\n1995; Smith 1990). Certain aspects of this trend, most notably that of\nacademic lawyers employing ill-digested Wittgenstein to dubious ends,\nare criticised by Bix 1993). According to this line of thinking, if\nwords, and legal rules composed of words, have no intrinsic meaning\nand hence cannot, in and of themselves, constrain legal reasoning,\nthen it must be we—readers or interpreters—who supply such\nmeaning via the process of interpretation (see Fish 1989; Cornell\n1992. Stone 1995 criticises this understanding of the role of\ninterpretation in legal reasoning, but notes its adoption by various\nlegal theorists). In the case of other theorists, interest in this\ntopic stems from a wish to investigate the parallels and divergences\nbetween interpretation in law and interpretation in literature\n(Levinson 1982; Dworkin 1985; Fish 1989).  The arrival on the\njurisprudential scene in the mid-1980s of Ronald Dworkin's powerful\nnew account of law as an interpretive concept, with concomitant\nimplications for the activities of both judges and legal theorists\n(see Dworkin 1986) also did much to contribute to interest in the role\nof interpretation in legal reasoning. Moreover, this account seemed to\nrouse Dworkin's legal positivist adversaries into elaborating more\nfully upon something which he has always claimed has been seriously\nunderdeveloped in their work (see e.g. Dworkin 1977), namely an\naccount of the nature of adjudication, and of the role of\ninterpretation within it (Marmor 1992 & 2005; Raz 1995; Raz 1996a\n& 1996b). Recent scholarship in constitutional theory concerning\nthe distinctive challenges posed by the interpretation of\nconstitutions has also helped fuel continuing interest in the topic of\ninterpretation in legal reasoning (see, for example, Bobbit 1991 &\n1996; Raz 1998b; Rubenfeld 1998; Kavanagh 2002, 2003 & 2009 part\nI; Sager 2004; Marmor 2005 ch. 9, Waluchow 2006 and the entry\n constitutionalism). \nIn some jurisdictions academic and public interest in interpretation\nin legal reasoning may have been sparked by changes in particular\nlegal arrangements: for example, as a result of the enactment of the\nHuman Rights Acts 1998 in the United Kingdom with its section 3 duty\nto read and give effect to primary and subordinate legislation in a\nway which is compatible with European Convention rights, or as a\nresult of the doctrine of consistent interpretation or indirect effect\ndeveloped by the European Court of Justice, requiring European Union\nMember States' courts to interpret domestic law so that it is\nconsistent with EU law, so far as it is possible to do so.   \n\nAs might be expected, as a result of these different (although often\nintertwining) intellectual backgrounds and sources of interest in\ninterpretation, legal theorists approach this subject with very\ndifferent questions and concerns to which they give concomitantly\ndifferent answers. For all this, however, a surprising number of legal\ntheorists agree—at least at an abstract level—about\none central characteristic of interpretation, namely that\ninterpretation is a Janus-faced concept, encompassing both a\nbackward-looking conserving component, and a forward-looking creative\none. In other words, an interpretation of something is an\ninterpretation of something—it presupposes that there\nis a something, or an original, there to be interpreted, and to which\nany valid interpretation must be faithful to some extent, thus\ndifferentiating interpretation from pure invention—but it is\nalso an interpretation of something, i.e. an attempt not\nmerely to reproduce but to make something of or bring something out of\nan original. (See e.g. Fiss 1982; Dworkin 1986; Marmor 1992 &\n2005; Endicott 1994; Raz 1996b & 1996c.)  \n\nMuch jurisprudential writing on interpretation in legal reasoning is\nconcerned with how to strike the right balance between the conserving\nand creative elements in interpretation, and with the constraints which\nare and/or should be operative upon judges as they undertake this\nbalancing act. Some theorists claim that such concerns about how one\nought to interpret the law indicate that it is part of the way that we\nthink about this practice that we regard rival interpretations as\nsubject to objective evaluation as good or bad, better or worse,\ncorrect or incorrect (Dworkin 1986; Raz 1996b and 1996c). On this view,\ncharacterisations of interpretation which attempt to impugn the\nobjectivity of such evaluations (e.g. Levinson 1982) are to be\nunderstood as revisionist accounts which attempt to persuade us that\nall is not as it appears to be with our practice of judging\ninterpretations to be good or bad, better or worse, correct or\nincorrect as we currently understand it (see e.g. Raz 1996b). \n\nIt is important to consider how interpretation, as characterised in\nsubsection 2.2 above, fits into the discussion of the ambit of the term\nlegal reasoning in the opening section of this entry. The key to this\nissue lies in interpretation's dualistic nature, i.e. that it has both\na backward-looking conserving aspect and a forward-looking creative\none. This dualism would seem to indicate that in interpreting the law,\njudges both seek to capture and be faithful to the content of the law\nas it currently exists, and to supplement, modify, or bring out\nsomething new in the law, in the course of reasoning from the content\nof the law to a decision in a particular case. In turn, this would seem\nto indicate that interpretation, because of its dualistic nature, has a\nrole to play in both legal reasoning in sense (a), i.e. reasoning to\nestablish the existing content of the law on a given issue, and legal\nreasoning in sense (b), namely reasoning from the existing content of\nthe law to the decision which a court should reach in a case involving\nthat issue which comes before it.  \n\nOne legal theorist who adopts exactly this approach, and so views\ninterpretation in legal reasoning as ‘straddling the\ndivide’ between identifying existing law, and developing and\nmodifying the law, is Joseph Raz (see Raz 1996a and 1996b). According\nto Raz, the fact that interpretation has a role to play in both of\nthese activities assists in explaining why we do not find a two-stage\nor clearly bifurcated approach to legal reasoning in judicial\ndecisions. Judges do not first of all engage in legal reasoning in\nsense (a), having recourse only to legal materials, and then, having\nestablished what the existing law is and determined how far it can take\nthem in resolving the instant case, then move on to a separate stage of\nlegal reasoning in sense (b) which requires them to look to extra-legal\nmaterials in order to complete the job, because much of their reasoning\nis interpretive and interpretation straddles the divide between legal\nreasoning in senses (a) and (b). This point may assist Raz in defusing\nsome of the criticisms which have been levelled at the legal positivist\napproach to legal reasoning such as that positivism's account is\nphenomenologically inaccurate because when we examine cases, we do not\nfind two distinct stages to judicial reasoning, one to establish\nwhether any legal rules bear upon the problem at hand, and one wherein\njudges effectively legislate to fill in the gaps when the legal rules\n‘run out’ (see e.g. Dworkin 1977 & 1986). As Raz\nhimself notes, however (especially in Raz 1996b), this\n‘straddling the divide’ approach may in fact seem to\nundermine the very ideas that there is a tenable distinction between\nlegal reasoning in senses (a) and (b), and that there are gaps in the\nlaw. Interpretation appears to blur or even erase the line between the\nseparate law-finding and law-creating roles which many legal\npositivists ascribe to judges, and the fact that courts always seem to\nbe able to decide cases by interpreting the law may also seem to cast\ndoubt on the idea that the law is incomplete, and hence that judges\nsometimes have to reach outside of the law in the adjudication process.\nInterest in the pervasiveness of interpretation in legal reasoning, and\nin the Janus-faced nature of interpretation may thus form part of the\nbackground which has led legal theorists like Dworkin to deny that the\ndistinction between identifying existing law, and developing and\nchanging the law, as understood by certain legal positivists, is a\ntenable or coherent one. That interpretation appears to operate at\nevery stage in the legal reasoning process may also have influenced\nDworkin's denial that there are gaps in the law, and his counter-claim,\ncontra Hart and Raz, that everything which a judge is entitled to rely\non in deciding a case is already part of the law (see Dworkin\n1986). \n\nLegal theorists disagree about the proper characterisation of many\naspects of the schematic account of the interpretive process given in\nsubsections 2.2 and 2.3 above. A few of these disagreements will be\nsurveyed here in order to give a fuller picture of some of the issues\nand views which are relevant to this topic. Accounts of the role of\ninterpretation in legal reasoning, then, differ regarding the following\nmatters (n.b. several of the following points overlap to some extent):  \n\n(1) What exactly is the original or object which is\nbeing interpreted in the case of law: the law as a whole?; certain\naspects of legal practice?; statutes?; judicial decisions?;\nauthoritative legal decisions?; legal texts? Raz 1996b claims that the\nprimary objects of interpretation are the decisions of legal\nauthorities. He reaches this conclusion as a result of his view that\nlaw is an institutionalised normative system wherein the institutions\nconcerned operate by issuing purportedly authoritative directives\nconcerning what ought to be done. According to Raz, then, the central\nrole which authority plays in law means that when we come to interpret\nthe law, what we are primarily seeking to do is to establish the\nexistence and meaning of any purportedly authoritative directives of\nlegal institutions, and it is, therefore, the decisions of those\ninstitutions which constitute the originals to be interpreted in the\ncase of law. (See further the discussion of Raz's views in subsection\n2.5 below). This stance can be contrasted with that adopted by Ronald\nDworkin. The process of ‘constructive interpretation’\n(Dworkin 1986, and see also the entry\n interpretivist theories of law)\n which\nplays such a central role in Dworkin's jurisprudential thought involves\ninterpreters, ‘imposing purpose on an object or practice in order\nto make of it the best possible example of the form or genre to which\nit is taken to belong.’ (Dworkin 1986, p52). Moreover, in the\ncase of legal interpretation, Dworkin appears to settle for the\nargumentative social practice of law as the original to be interpreted\n(Dworkin 1986, p63). This being so, for Dworkin, the object of legal\ninterpretation appears to be broader than that adopted by Raz. For Raz,\nwe interpret in order to establish whether any authoritative legal\ndirectives are currently in force and bear upon the legal issue at\nhand, and so we should look to the decisions establishing those\ndirectives in getting the interpretive process off the ground.\nDworkinian interpretation, however, seems to have a more abstract and\nglobal feel to it, in the sense that it is the social practice of law\nas a whole (Dworkin 1986, 87–88), including the entire legal history of\na given jurisdiction, as well as any data speaking to the point or\npurpose of legal practice in general, which constitutes the original to\nbe interpreted. \n\n(2) How much emphasis is to be placed on the\nconserving vs. the creative elements in interpretation? At the\nconserving extreme, we find accounts such as ‘originalism’\nin US constitutional interpretation which claims that in interpreting\na particular provision of the Constitution, judges should seek to\nestablish the way in which the provision was originally understood by\nthose who ratified it (see e.g. Bork 1990). As close as possible\nconformity with those original intentions thus furnishes us with the\nstandard of correctness in constitutional interpretation on this\napproach. According to Bork 1990, adherence to originalism in US\nconstitutional interpretation is necessary to ensure that the\njudiciary confines itself to its proper sphere of authority, thus\npreserving the separation of powers and structure of government in the\nform in which the founders of the US intended. Ronald Dworkin has\nrecently addressed directly the topic of originalism in US\nConstitutional Interpretation and has argued that fidelity to the\nConstitution's text does not exhaust constitutional interpretation,\nand that the search for constitutional integrity (see further point 6\nbelow, and the section on Coherence in Legal Reasoning) might require\ninterpreters to depart from the best interpretation of the\nconstitutional text considered apart from the history of its\nenforcement (Dworkin 2006, ch.5). Accounts such as that offered by\nLevinson (1982) are at the other end of the spectrum: they reject\noriginalism and give far more weight to the role of innovation in\nlegal interpretation. Indeed, Levinson contends that all US\nconstitutional interpretation is necessarily creative, due to radical\nand pervasive linguistic indeterminacy in the law. If such approaches\nwish to claim that there are standards by which we can judge\ninterpretations to be better or worse, correct or incorrect, then they\nmust find such standards other than in the conserving aspect of\ninterpretation, as the requirement that one be faithful to the meaning\nof an original seems to be obliterated on such views. As was noted at\nthe end of subsection 2.2 above, some such views may wish to claim\nthat our practice of accounting interpretations as good or bad,\ncorrect or incorrect is incoherent. One other possibility, however, is\nthat the notion of ‘correctness’ can be salvaged by being\npegged to the communal reactions of the relevant interpretive\ncommunity; our interpretations are the right ones when they accord\nsufficiently with those of our similarly situated fellow interpreters\n(see e.g. Kripke 1982 and those works discussed in\npoint (3) below).  Some commentators have poured\nscorn on the idea that this sort of approach could yield standards of\ncorrectness worthy of the name. See for example Baker & Hacker\n1984, who contend that Kripke's position amounts to the view that,\n‘an unjustified stab in the dark is unobjectionable as long as\nit is made in good company.’ (Baker and Hacker 1982, 81–82). \n\n(3) Following on from point (2)\nabove: how big a role does the requirement that judges must be faithful\nto an original play in constraining legal interpretation, and are there\nany additional constraints which supplement the constraints generated\nby the need to be faithful to an original which guide judges as they\ninterpret the law? For example, for Owen Fiss (1982),\n‘disciplining rules’ in the form of those standards which\nare constitutive of the profession of judging supply constraints upon\njudicial interpretation which supplement the rules of language which\nalready constrain all language users in their attempts to understand\ntexts. According to Fiss, then, judges are constrained both by the need\nto be faithful to the original legal text which they are interpreting,\nand by supplementary norms of interpretation which are constitutive of\nthe judicial role (Fiss lists the requirement that judges must always\nconsult history when interpreting the law as an example of a\n‘disciplining rule’). Fiss' view is criticised by Stanley\nFish (1989), who contends that Fiss' ‘disciplining rules’\nwould themselves require interpretation in order for judges to know\nwhat they mean and require of them, and hence cannot supply constraints\nupon judicial interpretation. Fish's contention that all potential\ncandidates which might constrain interpretation are themselves\nsusceptible to being interpreted in a variety of ways results in his\nclaiming that texts or originals cannot constrain judges at all in the\nway in which is commonly supposed, as texts do not have meanings in\nadvance of particular interpretations of them. This seemingly radical\nindeterminacy is deceptive, however, for although Fish removes the\nconstraints on interpretation provided by legal texts or supplementary\nnorms of the judicial profession, he replaces them with the\nconditioning and training processes of ‘interpretive\ncommunities’, which ensure that, ‘…readers are already\nand always thinking within the norms, standards, criteria of evidence,\npurposes and goals of a shared enterprise’, such that, ‘the\nmeanings available to them have been preselected by their professional\ntraining.’ (Fish 1989, 133). \n\n(4) Whether or not it is possible to have a general\ntheory of interpretation. Raz 1996a rejects the possibility of\ntwo types of general theories of interpretation:\n‘operational’ or recipe-like theories which are designed to\nguide judges to the right decision in a case which comes before them,\nand theories which, although they may not aim to guide judges to the\ncorrect decision, nonetheless claim to provide us with criteria via\nwhich to distinguish good interpretations from bad, and so enable us to\ncheck the correctness of decisions which have been made. According to\nRaz, theories of the former kind are impossible because morality (to\nwhich recourse must be had as regards the innovative aspect of legal\ninterpretation) is not susceptible to explanation via\n‘operational’ theories, i.e., ‘theories which would\nenable a person whose moral understanding and judgement are suspect to\ncome to the right moral conclusions regarding situations he may face by\nconsulting the theory.’ (Raz 1996a, p21. In this he follows\nsimilar claims made by several contemporary moral philosophers, e.g.\nWilliams 1985; Dancy 1993). Moreover, claims Raz, theories which\npurport to tell us how to differentiate good interpretations from bad\nare also impossible because, by its very nature, innovation defies\ngeneralisation, such that it is futile to attempt to construct a\ngeneral theory which differentiates good interpretations from bad as\nregards the forward-looking aspect of interpretation. It should be\nnoted that (as is apparent from the discussions in this entry as a\nwhole), Raz does believe that it is possible to have an account which\nexplains certain aspects of the nature and role of interpretation in\nlegal reasoning; what he doubts is that it is possible to have a\ncertain kind of account of interpretation, namely an account in the\nform of a theory which purports either to operate as a recipe for\nconcocting good interpretations, or to provide us with a general\naccount of how to evaluate interpretations as good or bad, right or\nwrong (on this point see also Raz 2009 essay 12 section IX). \n\nRonald Dworkin, by contrast, does purport to offer judges a general\ntheory of legal interpretation which they can use to guide their\ninterpretive activities, and which, if followed correctly, will lead\nthem to the ‘one right answer’ in the case before them (on\nDworkin's ‘one right answer’ thesis, see further point\n(7) below). For Dworkin, it is the aim of all legal\ninterpretation to ‘constructively interpret’ the social\npractice of law, by imposing purpose upon it such as, ‘to make\nof it the best possible example of the form or genre to which it is\ntaken to belong.’ (Dworkin 1986, p52). The more specific theory\nwhich he believes that judges should follow in fulfilling this\ntask—‘law as integrity’—‘instructs\njudges to identify legal rights and duties, so far as possible, on the\nassumption that they were created by a single author—the\ncommunity personified’ (see subsections 2.5 and 3.4, and the\nentry\n interpretivist theories of law).\n It\nshould be noted, however, that while Dworkin's general theory of\ninterpretation is designed to assist in guiding judges to the one right\nanswer in a case which comes before them, he claims that it is not\nrecipe-like in the sense of providing judges with a detailed step by\nstep programme for correct judicial decision-making: ‘I have not\ndevised an algorithm for the courtroom. No electronic magician could\ndesign from my arguments a computer program that would supply a verdict\neveryone would accept once the facts of the case and the text of all\npast statutes and judicial decisions were put at the computer's\ndisposal’ (Dworkin 1986, p. 412). \n\nDworkin's pro-theory stance has attracted criticism from a variety\nof quarters. Fish (1989, essays 4, 5 and 16) claims that ‘law as\nintegrity’ is not a theory which judges can use to guide their\ninterpretive activities because it is a strategy which they cannot help\nbut put into practice, and to which they are always and already\ncommitted simply in virtue of their membership in the judicial\ninterpretive community. Sunstein 1996 also warns against the kind of\n‘high-level theories’ which Dworkin instructs judges to\nconstruct and follow in deciding cases. Sunstein is suspicious of the\nvalue of such theorising on the grounds that, ‘it takes too much\ntime and may be unnecessary; because it may go wrong insofar as it\noperates without close reference to actual cases; because it often\nprevents people from getting along at all; and because general\ntheorizing can seem or be disrespectful insofar as it forces people to\ncontend, unnecessarily, over their deepest and most defining moral\ncommitments.’ (Sunstein 1996, p50). Instead, Sunstein advocates a\nspecial role for ‘incompletely theorized agreements’ in\njudicial decision-making. Such agreements can occur where judges agree\non the outcomes of individual cases even though they disagree on which\ngeneral theory best accounts for those outcomes, or agree on a general\nprinciple, but not on what that principle requires in particular cases,\nor agree on a ‘mid-level’ principle (see Sunstein 1996,\np36) but disagree about both the general theory underlying it and\nparticular cases falling under it. Sunstein regards incompletely\ntheorised agreements as vital to legal reasoning, because they allow\nthe diverse individuals who constitute the judiciary to agree on\noutcomes against the background of certain institutional constraints\nsuch as that they have, ‘a weak democratic pedigree and limited\nfact-finding capacity’ (Sunstein 1996, p6), must make many\ndecisions, make them fairly quickly, show adequate respect, to\nlitigants, and to each other, and avoid error insofar as is possible.\nSunstein presents a strong case for the role of incompletely theorised\nagreements in law in general, pointing out that the institution of such\nagreements is one of the most important social functions of legal\nrules, as rules are capable of allowing agreement in the face of\ndisagreement, in the sense that sometimes judges can agree on outcomes\nto cases governed by a rule whilst disagreeing about the rule's\njustification (on this important function of legal rules see also Raz\n2001). \n\n(5) Whether or not interpretation is always of\nsomething which to some extent already has meaning, or whether\ninterpretation is the fundamental determinant of the meaning\nof linguistic expressions in, for example, legal texts. Marmor 1992,\n2005 & Stone 1995 deny that interpretation is the fundamental\ndeterminant of the meaning of linguistic expressions and contend that,\nfollowing a certain reading of Wittgenstein's remarks on\nrule-following (namely the kind of reading offered by McDowell 1984\nand Baker and Hacker 1985), it must be possible for us to grasp the\nmeaning of, for example, a legal rule, in a way which does not require\nrecourse to interpretation. Cornell 1992 & Fish 1989 deny this,\nand contend that interpretation is all-pervasive, and is the\nfundamental and inescapable determinant of meaning, ‘all the way\ndown’, in all cases. In the minds of some legal theorists at\nleast, this point has strong links with with the issue of linguistic\nindeterminacy in law mentioned in subsection 2.1 above (see e.g. Fish\n1989; Cornell 1992).  Those theorists who contend that interpretation\nis the fundamental determinant of the meaning of linguistic\nexpressions often claim that such interpretation is necessary because\nlegal rules expressed in language do not have determinate meanings and\nhence cannot determine their own correct application; in John\nMcDowell's terminology, those rules, by themselves, cannot have\n‘normative reach.’ (McDowell 1984 & 1992). This being\nthe case, so this line of thinking goes, interpretation is required in\norder to bridge the gap between the inert legal rule and the\nsituations to which it applies.  For these theorists, the pertinent\nissue then becomes: how do we know that one interpretation rather than\nanother is in accordance with the rule, if the rule itself cannot\ndetermine its own correct application?  As Wittgenstein notes in his\nremarks on rule-following, it seems that: ‘ ‘Whatever I do\nis, on some interpretation, in accord with the rule’’,\nsuch that we can, ‘…give one interpretation after another; as\nif each one contented us at least for a moment, until we thought of\nyet another standing behind it.’ (Wittgenstein 1967, §198\nand §201 respectively). Some theorists, e.g. Fish 1989, seem to\nembrace this potential infinite regress of alternative interpretations\nof rules (see also point (3) above) and attempt to\navoid the radical linguistic indeterminacy which it seems to entail by\nreplacing the standards of correctness demarcated by rules with the\nconditioning and training processes of interpretive communities. For\ntheorists like Marmor (1992 & 2005) and Stone (1995) who deny that\ninterpretation is the fundamental determinant of the meaning of\nlinguistic expressions, the Wittgensteinian challenge is seen as a\nkind of reductio ad absurdum which indicates that we have\ngone astray in our understanding of how rules operate. Such theorists\nseek to avoid linguistic indeterminacy, and reject interpretation as\nthe fundamental determinant of meaning by denying that there is a gap\nwhich needs to be bridged between grasping a rule and understanding\nthose actions which it requires. As was noted above, this denial\nusually proceeds via a non-sceptical reading of Wittgenstein's remarks\non rule-following, along the lines of that offered by McDowell 1984\nand Baker and Hacker 1985. \n\n(6) Which values judges should attempt to realise\nin legal interpretation, and how those values are to be balanced\nagainst one another. One debate on this issue is that between Dworkin\n(1986), who champions the role of the value of integrity in\ninterpreting the law, and those who, like Raz (1994a), and\nRéaume (1989), doubt whether Dworkinian integrity is a\nvalue which should be pursued in legal interpretation. The value of\ncoherence in legal reasoning is addressed further in Section 3 of this\nentry. \n\n(7) Whether interpretation in legal reasoning can\nlead judges to the ‘one right answer’ as regards the legal\nissue at hand. For example, Finnis 1987 denies that it is possible for\ninterpretation in legal reasoning to lead judges to one right answer\nin the sense claimed in Dworkin 1986, because of pervasive\nincommensurabilities in the criteria by reference to which we are\nsupposed to adjudge one interpretation to be better than another.\nFinnis argues, contra Dworkin, that while we should seek good\nanswers and avoid bad ones, we should not delude ourselves into\ndreaming of uniquely correct answers to issues of legal\ninterpretation, for to do so commits us to, ‘utilitarianism's\ndeepest and most flawed assumption: the assumption of the\ncommensurability of basic goods and thus of the states of affairs\nwhich instantiate them.’ (Finnis 1987, p. 375). Dworkin (1986\n& 1991) remains firmly committed to the one right answer thesis,\nalthough it should be noted that in Dworkin 1986 chapter 11 he makes\nthe point that in a sense there can be different ‘right\nanswers’ for different interpreters: ‘For every route that\nHercules took from that general conception to a particular verdict,\nanother lawyer or judge who began in the same conception would find a\ndifferent route and end in a different place, as several of the judges\nin our sample cases did. He would end differently because he would\ntake leave of Hercules, following his own lights, at some branching\npoint sooner or later in the argument.’ (Dworkin, 1986,\np. 412). Raz 2009 contends that interpretive pluralism is a basic\nfeature of the concept of interpretation as we understand it,\ni.e. that there can be several different and incompatible\ninterpretations of the same object, all of which can be good.  \n\nThe points of disagreement surveyed above speak to differing views\nregarding how judges should go about interpreting the law, and how we\nshould understand their activities. Such concerns, however, do not\ndirectly address the important question of whether there is something\nabout the nature of law which makes it either desirable or necessary\nthat interpretation should play a role in legal reasoning in the first\nplace. In other words: why is legal reasoning interpretive at all?  \n\nRaz 1996c contends that while some conventions of legal\ninterpretation vary according to time and place, there are other\nfeatures which legal interpretation necessarily exhibits, owing to the\nnature of law itself. While we can debate about the desirability of\nconventions of interpretation falling into the former category (e.g. we\ncan consider the value of allowing the work of legal academics, or\nrecords of Parliamentary debates to serve as aids to interpretation in\na particular jurisdiction), the latter category of features leave us no\nroom for manoeuvre: courts cannot help but have recourse to them in\ninterpreting the law. According to Raz, assigning a limited role to the\nintentions of legislators in the interpretation of legislation is one\nsuch necessary feature of legal interpretation. It is, he claims,\nsimply part of our way of thinking about legislative institutions that\ntheir procedures and modes of operation are designed so as to allow\nlegislators to make the law which they intend to make. To assume\notherwise, Raz contends, is to render unintelligible any possible\njustification for entrusting law-making powers to those institutions.\nThis being so, when judges come to interpret the decisions of\nlegislative institutions, they must do so such that the law thus\ninterpreted reflects the intentions of those who made it. \n\nThese considerations may also seem to speak mainly to the issue of\nhow we are to go about interpreting aspects of the law. However, the\nreasons why it is important to pay attention to the intentions of\nlaw-making institutions when we interpret the law also furnish us with\nRaz's answer to the question of why legal reasoning is interpretive at\nall. We pay attention to the intentions of law-making institutions\nbecause it is important to establish which legal rules those\ninstitutions have laid down, and what they mean. In turn, it is\nimportant to establish the existence and meaning of legal rules laid\ndown by law-making institutions because of law's purportedly\nauthoritative nature. For Raz, legal institutions claim to express\nbinding and authoritative judgements regarding what ought to be done\nwhich are designed to allow people to better conform to reason if they\nfollow the decisions of the authority than if they try to follow those\nother reasons which apply to them directly (see Raz 1994, ch.10). In\ndeciding cases according to law, then, we have a responsibility to try\nto establish the existence and meaning of any purportedly\nauthoritatively binding legal rules which have a bearing on the\nsituation under consideration, and we do so by interpreting the\ndecisions of law-making institutions in a way which accords with the\nintentions of those institutions in making the decisions in question.\nFor Raz, then, it is the authoritative nature of law which explains why\nlegal reasoning is interpretive, whereas, for example, moral reasoning\nis not. Law, unlike morality, stems from social sources (on the role of\nsocial sources in understanding law, see Raz 1979 and the entry on\n legal positivism),\n from institutions\nissuing purportedly authoritative directives which claim to express a\nbinding judgement about what ought to be done. Part of our task in\nreasoning about the law is thus to establish the existence and meaning\nof those directives, and, in order to do so, we must interpret the\ndecisions of law-making institutions in accordance with the intentions\nof the law-makers in order to try to establish the content and meaning\nof the law which they intended to make (see also Raz 1996a and\n1996b). \n\nIt is interesting to compare Raz's stance on the reasons why legal\nreasoning is necessarily interpretive with Ronald Dworkin's views on\nthis topic. Rather than being based on the view that in ascertaining\nthe content and meaning of the law, we should look to authoritative\nsocial sources, Dworkin's contention that legal reasoning is\nnecessarily interpretive rests on an account of law which expressly\nrepudiates the Razian understanding of law as source-based. According\nto Dworkin, the view that law is to be identified by reference to\nauthoritative social sources yields a grossly inadequate account of the\nargumentative nature of legal practice, and of the nature and depth of\ndisagreement within it (see Dworkin 1986 ch.1). He contends that an\nadequate account of these features of legal practice can only be gained\nwhen we understand that law is an interpretive concept, i.e. that it is\na social practice wherein a certain interpretive attitude has taken\nhold. The attitude in question comprises two components: the assumption\nthat the practice does not merely exist, but has a purpose or point,\nand the further assumption that the rules of the practice are not\nnecessarily what they have always been taken to be, but rather are\nsensitive to, and can be revised in light of, its point (Dworkin 1986\nch.2; also, the entry on\n interpretivist theories of law).\n For Dworkin, then, it is these features of the social practice\nof law: that members of that practice dispute and disagree about what\nthe best interpretation of the rules of the practice are, in light of\nits point, which dictate that legal reasoning is necessarily\ninterpretive. Once the interpretive attitude has taken hold amongst the\nparticipants in a social practice, the only way to understand it\nadequately is to do as the participants in that practice do: i.e. join\nthe practice and make the same kind of interpretive claims concerning\nthe point of the practice, and what the rules of it are in light of\nthat point, as they do. For Dworkin, this point holds good for the\nactivities of judges and legal theorists alike: anyone reasoning about\nthe law is required to treat it as an interpretive social practice and\noffer interpretations of what it requires in light of the purpose or\npoint which they assign to it. \n\nAs several commentators have noted (see Kress 1984; Marmor 1992; Raz\n1994a), coherence theories, long influential in other areas of\nphilosophy (see, for example, the entries on the\n coherence theory of truth\n and\ncoherentist theories of epistemic justification) have more recently\nfound their way into the philosophy of law (for a general survey of\ncoherence theories in law which also considers them in the context of\ncoherence theories of truth, justified belief, ethics and justice, see\nKress 1996). While this migration may be attributed in part to the\nfrequent influence of the general philosophical climate upon the\nintellectual weather systems of jurisprudential theorising, it also\nmakes sense to ask whether there is something about the nature of law\nwhich makes it particularly ripe for explanation via coherence\naccounts. For example, those commentators who view Ronald Dworkin's\ntheory of law as integrity as a coherence account appear to answer\nthis question in the affirmative (see e.g. Kress 1984; Hurley 1989):\ncoherence, in the sense of interpreting the law as speaking with one\nvoice as integrity requires, is a value which is supposed to have\nspecial relevance in the legal realm, in terms of the role which it\nshould play in guiding judges seeking to interpret the law\ncorrectly. It has also been noted that features of the law such as the\ndoctrine of precedent, arguments from analogy, and the requirement\nthat like cases be treated alike seem particularly apt to be\nilluminated via some kind of coherence explanation. (See Kress 1984.\nRaz 1994a notes the temptation here, but contends that there is\nnothing inherent in arguments from analogy or in the requirement that\nlike cases be treated alike which demands that they be understood in\nterms of a coherence account of adjudication. On the role of arguments\nfrom analogy in legal reasoning more generally, see Weinreb 2005, and\nalso the entry\n precedent and analogy in legal reasoning.)\n Moreover, the idea of coherence as a special virtue of\ninterpretation in legal reasoning plays an important role in the work\nof several major continental legal philosophers (see e.g. Peczenik\n1989; Alexy 1989; Aarnio 1987; Alexy & Peczenik 1990).  \n\nThe following discussion attempts to explore some of these issues\nconcerning whether and why considerations of coherence have an\nimportant role to play in understanding law. As this entry seeks to\nilluminate the role of coherence in legal reasoning, the emphasis here\nis on coherence accounts of adjudication, and on examining the role\nwhich coherence plays in courts' reasoning about how to decide cases\naccording to law. This being so, this part of the entry discusses legal\nreasoning in the sense outlined in formulation (b) in Section 1 (\"What\nDo Legal Theorists Mean By ‘Legal Reasoning’?\"), i.e.\nreasoning from the content of the existing law on a given issue to the\ndecision which a court should reach in a case involving that issue\nwhich comes before it. \n\nTwo central questions must be addressed in considering the role of\ncoherence in legal reasoning: what is the nature of the coherence\nrelation which features in coherence accounts of adjudication, and what\nrole does coherence play in explaining or justifying judicial decisions\nin such accounts?  \n\nAmongst those legal theorists taking an interest in the role of\ncoherence in legal reasoning, there is general agreement both that the\ncoherence in question must amount to more than logical consistency\namongst propositions (see Kress 1984; MacCormick 1984; Marmor 1992\n& 2005; Alexy & Peczenik 1990) and that it is not clear from\nmany coherence accounts exactly what this something more amounts to\n(see Kress 1984; Peczenik 1989; Marmor 1992). MacCormick 1984 views\ncoherence in terms of unity of principle in a legal system, contending\nthat the coherence of a set of legal norms consists in their being\nrelated either in virtue of being the realisation of some common value\nor values, or in virtue of fulfilling some common principle or\nprinciples. Raz 1994a also characterises coherence in law in terms of\nunity of principle. On his view, the more unified the set of\nprinciples underlying those court decisions and legislative acts which\nmake up the law, the more coherent law is. \n\nOther writers have attempted to supply a more formal definition of,\nfor example, a minimally coherent legal system (see Levenbook 1984), or\notherwise to flesh out in a more detailed manner the criteria of\ncoherence. Alexy and Peczenik 1990 define coherence in terms of the\ndegree of approximation to a perfect supportive structure exhibited by\na set of propositions, and list ten criteria by reference to which\ncoherence thus defined can be evaluated (the criteria are: (1) the\nnumber of supportive relations, (2) the length of the supportive\nchains, (3) the strength of the support, (4) the connections between\nsupportive chains, (5) priority orders between reasons, (6) reciprocal\njustification, (7) generality, (8) conceptual cross-connections, (9)\nnumber of cases a theory covers, and (10) diversity of fields of life\nto which the theory is applicable). Such an approach raises many\nquestions, such as how these various criteria of coherence are to be\nweighed and balanced against each other, and whether it is always the\ncase that the weighing operation will result in a complete ranking of\ngiven sets of propositions as either more or less coherent than each\nother, so that when faced with competing such sets, it is always\npossible to find the most coherent set of propositions according to the\nten criteria. Alexy and Peczenik recognise that weighing and balancing\nthe criteria of coherence will be a complex matter, but appear to\nassume that it will always be possible to establish which is the most\ncoherent of rival sets of propositions. \n\nA further characterisation of the kind of coherence which is to be\nsought in legal reasoning may be found in Ronald Dworkin's work. Many\nwriters regard Dworkin's account of integrity in adjudication as an\nexample of a coherence account. (See Hurley 1989 & 1990; Marmor\n1992 & 2005. Kress 1984, although writing before Dworkin had fully\ndeveloped his account of law as integrity, also views Dworkin as\noffering a coherence account of adjudication. Raz 1994a disputes the\nidea that Dworkin's account of law should be understood as a coherence\naccount.)  On this view, judges should try to realise the value of\ncoherence in judicial decisions by interpreting the law as\n‘speaking with one voice’, i.e. they should identify legal\nrights and duties on the basis that they were all created by a single\nauthor, the community personified. \n\nThe next issues to consider are (1) what is to be made coherent in\ncoherence accounts of legal reasoning, and (2) what role coherence\nplays in explaining or justifying judicial decisions on such accounts.\nRegarding the question of what is to be made coherent in coherence\naccounts of legal reasoning, Raz 1994a contends that coherence\naccounts, when applied to law, require a ‘base’ or\nsomething which is to be made coherent, which differs in character in\nsome crucial respects from the sort of base which features in coherence\naccounts in other areas of philosophy. Raz points out that while\ncoherence accounts of justified belief take each person's belief set as\ntheir ‘base’ or as that which is to be made coherent,\ncoherence accounts of law cannot be person-relative in this way, on\npain of failing to offer an account which is in touch with the concrete\nreality of law in the jurisdiction under consideration. Raz's\ncontention is that the law of a given jurisdiction does not vary with\nthe beliefs of those subject to it, and in his view, that law is\nobjective in this way means that there must be a common base to which\ncoherence accounts in law are addressed. His suggestion in this regard\nis that coherence accounts in law take court decisions and legislative\nand regulatory acts as their base, and hold law to be the set of\nprinciples that makes the most coherent sense of that base. Raz further\ndistinguishes between coherence accounts of law and coherence accounts\nof adjudication. The essential difference between them is the stage at\nwhich considerations of coherence come into play. In the case of a\ncoherence account of law, the whole of what the law is is\ndetermined by applying a coherence test to those court decisions and\nlegislative and regulatory acts of a given jurisdiction. A coherence\naccount of adjudication, however, accepts that the vagaries of politics\nand the influence of political considerations on legislative and\njudicial decisions make it unlikely that the settled law of a\njurisdiction will exhibit coherence to any great extent. This being so,\nif we are to apply a coherence account in order to determine how judges\nought to decide cases according to law (legal reasoning in sense (b)),\nthen we should assume a coherence-independent test to identify the\nsettled law of a jurisdiction first, and then bring in considerations\nof coherence at a later stage, and hold that courts ought to adopt that\noutcome to a case which is favoured by the most coherent set of\npropositions which, were the settled rules of the system justified,\nwould justify them.  \n\nMacCormick 1984 espouses a similar view of the role which coherence\ncan play in adjudication and gives an indication of how we might think\nof the links between interpretation and coherence in legal reasoning.\nAccording to MacCormick, in deciding a case according to law, courts\nshould first of all interpret the existing law in order to establish a\ncoherent view of some branch of the law, and they should do this by\nshowing how that branch of law is justified according to some coherent\nset of principles or values which underlie it. The court should then\nuse this view of the law in order to justify its decision in a new case\nwhich comes before it. On such an approach, then, once courts establish\nwhat the settled law is, they should then interpret law in applying it\nto a new case such that their decision is in accord with the most\ncoherent account which justifies that settled law. \n\nOnce a stance has been taken on the nature of the coherence relation in\nthe case of law, many further questions concerning the role which\nconsiderations of coherence are to play in legal reasoning come to the\nfore. One important issue is that of how much emphasis is to be placed\non coherence in justifying a judicial decision. Is exhibiting some\ndegree of coherence with the existing law a necessary requirement of\nany justified judicial decision? Is it both a necessary and sufficient\nrequirement, such that an account of the role of coherence in\nadjudication supplies us with a complete explanation of how judges\nshould decide cases according to law? Or is coherence rather to be\nregarded as a desirable feature of judicial decision making, but one\nwhich can be overridden by other considerations in certain\ncircumstances?  \n\nAt this point in the discussion, it is possible to draw out some\nfurther possible links between the two concepts with which this entry\nis concerned, namely interpretation and coherence. If we hold that\nlegal reasoning in sense (b), namely reasoning from the content of the\nlaw to the outcome which judges should adopt in a case before them, is\nwholly (Dworkin 1986) or mainly (Raz 1996a) interpretive, then we can\nreformulate some of the questions raised above concerning how much\nemphasis is to be placed upon coherence in adjudication in terms of the\nextent to which, in interpreting the law, we should interpret it in\nsuch a way as to realise the value of coherence in judicial decisions.\nSo, for example, is coherence the sole desideratum which should guide\njudges in interpreting the law, or is it merely one feature of a\nsuccessful such interpretation, and, moreover, is it a necessary\nfeature, or one which, although desirable, may be overridden by\ncompeting values which judges should also try to realise in\ninterpreting the law? \n\nLevenbook 1984 contends that it is a necessary condition for a\njudicial decision to be legally justified that it coheres with some\npart of the established law. She contrasts her understanding of this\nrequirement with that adopted by MacCormick 1978. According to\nLevenbook, while MacCormick also holds that minimal coherence with some\npart of the established law is a necessary condition of a judicial\ndecision being justified, he nevertheless contends that, so long as\nthis minimal standard is met, further considerations of coherence which\nare also relevant to the decision can be defeated on consequentialist\ngrounds. Levenbook's view is that this approach gives coherence too\nmodest a role to play in legal reasoning; once a very minimal\nrequirement of coherence is met, this value is too easily defeasible by\nother considerations. Levenbook finds this account of adjudication\ntroubling because, in her view, it fails to do justice to judges'\nresponsibility to be faithful to pre-existing law, a responsibility\nwhich places the judiciary in a quite different situation from the\nlegislature when it comes to the question of how law ought to be\ndeveloped. She contends that a judge who, within the limits allowed to\nhim by the law, adopts a decision which is better on moral grounds over\none which displays greater congruence with the trend or spirit of the\nexisting law has made a mistake, and has adopted a legally unjustified\ndecision. Levenbook very succinctly focuses the dilemma which judges\nmust confront in deciding how much weight is to be placed on\nconsiderations of coherence in judicial decisions: should judges always\nadopt the outcome to a case which best coheres with the pre-existing\nlaw, or can they ever be justified in adopting an outcome which is less\ncoherent but morally preferable? This way of focusing the dilemma which\njudges may face brings out another important aspect of coherence in\nlegal reasoning, namely that granting a strong role to considerations\nof coherence is to place considerable emphasis on the backward-looking\naspect of adjudication, as such an approach may require judges to place\ngreater value on adhering to what has gone before, rather than on doing\nwhat would otherwise, on moral grounds, be the right thing. \n\nRaz (1994a), who contends that coherence in legal reasoning is\nsometimes desirable, but certainly defeasible, poses essentially the\nsame dilemma, but seems to place the burden of proof on those grasping\nthe other horn of it. That is to say, Raz asks not how could it ever be\njustified for judges to deviate from the trend of the existing law in\norder to adopt a less coherent but otherwise morally preferable\ndecision, but rather why should judges ever deviate from what is\notherwise the morally best solution to a case before them on grounds of\ncoherence? The burden of proof point is important because Raz's view\nseems to be that arguments in favour of a strong role for coherence in\nlegal reasoning go through too easily, or are too readily adopted as a\ndefault position, perhaps because of the fact that reasoning by analogy\nis a common feature of many legal systems and seems to lend itself to\nbeing characterised in coherence terms, such that the facts speak for\nthemselves in favour of the conclusion that considerations of coherence\nhave a special role to play in legal reasoning. Pointing out that\nreasoning by analogy is not a necessary fact of life in all legal\nsystems, and that, even where it does feature, it is still necessary to\nprovide an explanation of the rationale of arguments from analogy, and\nthe links between such arguments and coherence accounts of\nadjudication, Raz seeks to shift the burden of proof onto those who\nchampion coherence. If judges are sometimes to deviate from what would\notherwise be, according to law, the morally best outcome to a case\nbefore them on grounds of coherence, then, Raz contends, we are in need\nof a convincing positive argument why this should be so. \n\nOne such argument may well be found in a point already mentioned in\npassing above, i.e. that judges are in a different position from\nlegislators when it comes to deciding how the law ought to be\ndeveloped. Raz (1979 and 1994a) argues that when faced with the choice\nof adopting the (according to law) morally best outcome to a case over\nan outcome which coheres better with the settled law, courts have to\nbear in mind that if they choose the former route, then some\nproblematic consequences may ensue, such as that they may introduce\nconflicting rules reflecting conflicting social and economic purposes\ninto the law, and hence create a considerable degree of dissonance with\nregard to existing legal doctrines in a given area of law. Such\nconsequences need not dog legislative attempts to develop the law in a\nway which deviates from the doctrinal past, because legislative\ninstitutions have the power to sweep away the past in introducing new\nlegislation, and to do so in such a way as to radically reform a whole\narea of law at one stroke. Courts, by contrast, can only make decisions\nconcerning the issues arising in the case before them, and have\nconsiderably less opportunity to engage in radical reform of the law.\nThese factors mean that judicial reform of the law will always be\npartial in nature, and, as was noted above, such partial reform brings\nwith it the possibility of introducing dissonance and conflict into the\nlaw in the meantime. This may provide one reason why sometimes courts\nshould give greater weight to considerations of coherence with\npre-existing law in deciding cases which come before them, rather than\nstriking out in a (albeit otherwise morally preferable) direction which\ncoheres less well with settled law.  \n\nOn Dworkin's account of adjudication—at least when that account\nis understood as a coherence account (see subsection 3.1 above)—we\nfind a different kind of answer to the question of why coherence has a\nspecial role to play in legal reasoning. As was noted in subsection\n2.4, for Dworkin, in adjudicating cases, judges should seek to\nconstructively interpret the law, i.e. to impose purpose on it in order\nto make of it the best possible example of the form or genre to which\nit is taken to belong (see Dworkin 1986, chs.2 & 3, and the entry\non\n interpretivist theories of law).\n For Dworkin, the form or genre of law is to provide a\nconvincing justification for the exercise of state coercion (see\nDworkin 1986, passim;), and, as\nhe regards both judges and legal theorists as engaging in constructive\ninterpretation (see Dworkin 1986, p90), Dworkin further contends that\nany adequate jurisprudential account of law must explain how what it\ntakes to be law provides a general justification for the exercise of\nthe coercive power of the state (for discussion of this point, see Dickson 2001,\n chs. 5 & 6, Dickson 2004 and cf. the entry on\n interpretivist theories of law). \n In Law's Empire, Dworkin\nargues that such a justification can best be provided when the law is\nviewed as the organised and coherent voice of what he refers to as a\n‘community of principle’ i.e. a community whose members\naccept that their fates are linked by virtue of the fact that their\nrights and responsibilities are governed by common principles. So for\nDworkin, we must interpret law as coherent, in the sense of speaking\nwith one voice, because by so doing, we understand law as the voice of\na community of principle, and so as capable of providing a general\njustification for the exercise of state coercion (see Dworkin\n1986). \n\nSome theorists are not so concerned to provide a\n‘law-specific’ explanation of why coherence has an\nimportant role to play in legal reasoning. For example, although\nacknowledging that there may be much more to be said about what is\ndistinctive about legal reasoning, Hurley 1990 is largely content to\nexplore the consequences for legal reasoning which ensue from the\ncoherentist account of general practical reasoning which she\nespouses. \n\nIn considering the role of coherence in legal reasoning, a final point\nto mention is that of how much of the law is to be made coherent\naccording to various jurisprudential accounts granting a role to\nconsiderations of coherence. Are we talking of global coherence, such\nthat judges should strive to reach judicial decisions which cohere to\nsome extent with the settled law of an entire legal system, or should\nthe coherence we seek be more local in nature, e.g. coherence with\nparticular branches or areas of law?  \n\nLevenbook 1984 is a supporter of local coherence, and criticises\nthose who, like Sartorius (1968 and 1971) and Dworkin (1977, and,\nalthough not yet written at the time of Levenbook's article, Dworkin\n1986), hold that justified judicial decisions are those which best\ncohere with the law as a whole. According to Levenbook, champions of\nglobal coherence ignore the fact that sometimes a legally justified\ndecision is supported by, in the sense of cohering with, principles\nwhich are distinctive of one area or branch of the law, but the\nprinciples concerned differ substantially from, and hence do not cohere\nwell with principles from other branches of law. On this line of\nthinking, the judicial decision which coheres best with the principles\nunderlying some specific field of law may not result in increased\ncoherence of the entire system of law. That global coherence theorists\nmay well be led to reject such a decision, and to hold that an\nalternative decision which coheres well with the overall system of law,\nbut which increases incoherence locally is the more strongly justified,\nis, for Levenbook, a good reason to reject their theories: she contends\nthat any plausible account of adjudication must make room for the kind\nof ‘area-specific coherence’ which she believes is\nnecessary in the case of law. Raz 1994a also champions local over\nglobal coherence in adjudication, and his argument mentioned in the\nprevious section concerning the limitations on the reforming role of\ncourts, and the way in which this sometimes militates in favour of\ncoherence playing a role in judicial decision making, is intended to\nsupport local coherence only. Peczenik 1994 claims that while the goal\nof the kind of doctrinal interpretation undertaken by legal scholars\n(which he refers to as ‘legal dogmatics’) is to establish\nthe unity of an entire legal system, the judicial interpretation\nundertaken by judges is of a far more local variety, as it is concerned\nmerely with the norms applicable to the case in question, and because a\ncoherent interpretation of those norms may decrease their coherence\nwith other legal norms. \n\nWhile, as Levenbook 1984 notes, Dworkin's account of integrity in\nadjudication requires judges to attempt to view the legal system as a\nwhole as exhibiting coherence and speaking with one voice in\ninterpreting the law, Dworkin does also recognise that\ncompartmentalisation into different branches or areas of law is an\nindisputable feature of legal practice, and he accordingly attempts to\nintegrate it within his vision of adjudicative integrity. He does so\nvia his doctrine of local priority in interpretation, i.e. that if a\ngiven principle justifying a judicial decision does not fit at all\nwell with the area of law which the case is classified as falling\nunder, then this counts dramatically against deciding the case in\naccordance with that principle, no matter how well such an\ninterpretation coheres with other areas of the law (see Dworkin 1986,\nch. 7). However, because of the strong pull toward global coherence in\nlaw as integrity—expressed in Dworkin's claim that it is\nnecessary to strive to view the legal system as a whole as speaking\nwith one voice, the voice of an authentic political community, in\norder that law can be seen as justifying state coercion—the\ncurrent compartmentalisation of the law is not an unrevisable given\nfor judges deciding cases, rather, it, too, is something which is\nsubject to the Dworkinian process of constructive interpretation. This\nbeing so, he claims, when the compartmentalisation of the law does not\ntrack widely held principles of those subject to the law accounting\ncurrent classificatory boundaries as important, then the doctrine of\nlocal priority is to be given much less force. Indeed, where there is\na serious mismatch between the current compartmentalisation and actual\nviews about relevant similarities and differences between areas of law\nheld by those subject to it, it might be possible for judges to\ndiscard the doctrine of local priority altogether, and undertake\nradical reform of some departments of law in order to make them cohere\nbetter with others, or even to erase entire the alleged boundaries\nbetween certain branches of law in the course of interpreting the law\nand applying it to new cases.","contact.mail":"julie.dickson@law.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"law.ox.ac.uk"}]
