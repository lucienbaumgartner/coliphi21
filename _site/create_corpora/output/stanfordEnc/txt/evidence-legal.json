Even within Western legal\ntraditions, there are significant differences between Anglo-American\nlaw and Continental European law (see Damaška 1973, 1975,\n1992, 1994, 1997). This entry focuses on the modern concept of\nevidence that operates in the legal tradition to which Anglo-American\nlaw belongs.[1]\n\nIt may seem obvious that there must be a legal concept of\nevidence that is distinguishable from the ordinary concept of\nevidence.  After all, there are in law many special rules on what can\nor cannot be introduced as evidence in court, on how evidence is to be\npresented and the uses to which it may be put, on the strength or\nsufficiency of evidence needed to establish proof and so forth. But\nthe law remains silent on some crucial matters. In resolving the\nfactual disputes before the court, the jury or, at a bench trial, the\njudge has to rely on extra-legal principles. There have been academic\nattempts at systematic analysis of the operation of these principles\nin legal fact-finding (Wigmore 1937; Anderson, Schum and Twining\n2009). These principles, so it is claimed, are of a general nature. On\nthe basis that the logic in “drawing inferences from evidence to\ntest hypotheses and justify conclusions” is governed by the same\nprinciples across different disciplines (Twining and Hampsher-Monk\n2003: 4), ambitious projects have been undertaken to develop a\ncross-disciplinary framework for the analysis of evidence (Schum 1994)\nand to construct an interdisciplinary “integrated science of\nevidence” (Dawid, Twining and Vasilaki 2011; cf. Tillers\n2008).\n\nWhile evidential reasoning in law and in other contexts may share\ncertain characteristics, there nevertheless remain aspects of the\napproach to evidence and proof that are distinctive to law (Rescher\nand Joynt 1959). Section 1 (“conceptions of evidence”)\nidentifies different meanings of evidence in legal discourse. When\nlawyers talk about evidence, what is it that they are referring to?\nWhat is it that they have in mind? Section 2 (“conditions for\nreceiving evidence”) approaches the concept of legal evidence\nfrom the angle of what counts as evidence in law. What are the\nconditions that the law imposes and must be met for something to be\nreceived by the court as evidence? Section 3 (“strength of\nevidence”) shifts the attention to the stage where the evidence\nhas already been received by the court. Here the focus is on how the\ncourt weighs the evidence in reaching the verdict. In this connection,\nthree properties of evidence will be discussed: probative value,\nsufficiency and degree of completeness.\n\nStephen (1872: 3–4, 6–7) long ago noted that legal\nusage of the term “evidence” is ambiguous. It sometimes\nrefers to that which is adduced by a party at the trial as a means of\nestablishing factual claims. (“Adducing evidence” is the\nlegal term for presenting or producing evidence in court for the\npurpose of establishing proof.) This meaning of evidence is reflected\nin the definitional section of the Indian Evidence Act (Stephen 1872:\n149).[2] When\nlawyers use the term “evidence” in this way, they have in\nmind what epistemologists would think of as “objects of sensory\nevidence” (Haack 2004: 48). Evidence, in this sense, is divided\nconventionally into three main\ncategories:[3]\noral evidence (the testimony given in court by witnesses),\ndocumentary evidence (documents produced for inspection by the\ncourt), and “real evidence”; the first two are\nself-explanatory and the third captures things other than documents\nsuch as a knife allegedly used in committing a crime. The term “evidence” can, secondly, refer to a\nproposition of fact that is established by evidence in the first\nsense.[4] This\nis sometimes called an “evidential fact”. That the\naccused was at or about the scene of the crime at the relevant time\nis evidence in the second sense of his possible involvement in the\ncrime. But the accused’s presence must be proved by producing\nevidence in the first sense. For instance, the prosecution may call a\nwitness to appear before the court and get him to testify that he saw\nthe accused in the vicinity of the crime at the relevant\ntime. Success in proving the presence of the accused (the evidential\nfact) will depend on the fact-finder’s assessment of the\nveracity of the witness and the reliability of his testimony. (The\nfact-finder is the person or body responsible for ascertaining where\nthe truth lies on disputed questions of fact and in whom the power to\ndecide on the verdict vests. The fact-finder is also called\n“trier of fact” or “judge of fact”.\nFact-finding is the task of the jury or, for certain types of cases\nand in countries without a jury system, the judge.) Sometimes the\nevidential fact is directly accessible to the fact-finder. If the\nalleged knife used in committing the crime in question (a form of\n“real evidence”) is produced in court, the fact-finder\ncan see for himself the shape of the knife; he does not need to learn\nof it through the testimony of an intermediary. A third conception of evidence is an elaboration or extension of\nthe second. On this conception, evidence is relational. A factual\nproposition (in Latin, factum probans) is evidence in the\nthird sense only if it can serve as a premise for drawing an\ninference (directly or indirectly) to a matter that is material to\nthe case (factum probandum)\n(see section 2.2 below for the concept of\nmateriality). The fact that the accused’s fingerprints were\nfound in a room where something was stolen is evidence in the present\nsense because one can infer from this that he was in the room, and\nhis presence in the room is evidence of his possible involvement in\nthe theft. On the other hand, the fact that the accused’s\nfavorite color is blue would, in the absence of highly unusual\ncircumstances, be rejected as evidence of his guilt: ordinarily, what\na person’s favorite color happens to be cannot serve as a\npremise for any reasonable inference towards his commission of a\ncrime and, as such, it is irrelevant (see discussion of relevance\nin section 2.1 below). In the third sense of\n“evidence”, which conceives of evidence as a premise for\na material inference, “irrelevant evidence” is an\noxymoron: it is simply not evidence. Hence, this statement of Bentham\n(1825: 230):[5]  To say that testimony is not pertinent, is to say\nthat it is foreign to the case, has no connection with it, and does\nnot serve to prove the fact in question; in a word, it is to say, that\nit is not evidence. There can be evidence in the first sense without evidence in the\nsecond or third sense. To pursue our illustration, suppose it emerges\nduring cross-examination of the expert that his testimony of having\nfound a finger-print match was a lie. Lawyers would describe this\nsituation as one where the “evidence” (the testimony of\nthe expert) fails to prove the fact that it was originally produced to\nprove and not that no “evidence” was adduced on the\nmatter.  Here “evidence” is used in the first\nsense—evidence as testimony—and the testimony remains in\nthe court’s record whether it is believed or not. But lawyers\nwould also say that, in the circumstances, there is no\n“evidence” that the accused was in the room, assuming that\nthere was nothing apart from the discredited expert testimony of a\nfingerprint match to establish his presence there. Here, the\nexpert’s testimony is shown to be false and fails to establish\nthat the accused’s fingerprints were found in the room, and\nthere is no (other) factual basis for believing that he was in the\nroom. The factual premise from which an inference is sought to be\ndrawn towards the accused’s guilt is not established. Fourthly, the conditions for something to be received (or, in\ntechnical term “admitted”) as evidence at the trial are\nsometimes included in the legal concept of evidence. (These conditions\nare discussed in section 2\nbelow.) On this conception, legal evidence is that which counts as\nevidence in law. Something may ordinarily be treated as evidence and\nyet be rejected by the court. Hearsay is often cited as an example. It\nis pointed out that reliance on hearsay is a commonplace in ordinary\nlife. We frequently rely on hearsay in forming our factual beliefs. In\ncontrast, “hearsay is not evidence” in legal proceedings\n(Stephen 1872: 4–5). As a general rule, the court will not rely\non hearsay as a premise for an inference towards the truth of what is\nasserted. It will not allow a witness to testify in court that another\nperson X (who is not brought before the court) said\nthat p on a certain occasion (an out-of-court statement) for\nthe purpose of proving that p. In summary, at least four possible conceptions of legal evidence\nare in currency: as an object of sensory evidence, as a fact, as an\ninferential premise and as that which counts as evidence in law. The\nsense in which the term “evidence” is being used is seldom\nmade explicit in legal discourse although the intended meaning will\noften be clear from the context. This section picks up on the fourth conception of evidence. To\nrecall, something will be accepted by the court as evidence—it\nis, to use Montrose’s term, receivable as evidence in\nlegal proceedings—only if three basic conditions are\nsatisfied: relevance, materiality\nand admissibility (Montrose 1954). These three conditions of\nreceivability are discussed in turn below. The concept of relevance plays a pivotal role in legal\nfact-finding.  Thayer (1898: 266, 530) articulates its significance\nin terms of two foundational principles of the law of evidence:\nfirst, without exception, nothing which is not relevant may be\nreceived as evidence by the court and secondly, subject to many\nexceptions and qualifications, whatever is relevant is receivable as\nevidence by the court.  Thayer’s view has been influential and\nfinds expression in sources of law, for example, in Rule 402 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence in the United\nStates.[6]\nThayer claims, and it is now widely accepted, that relevance is a\n“logical” and not a legal concept;\nin section 2.1.3, we will examine this\nclaim and the dissent expressed by Wigmore. Leaving aside the\ndissenting view for the moment, we will turn first to consider\npossible conceptions of relevance in the conventional sense of\nlogical relevance. Evidence may be adduced in legal proceedings to prove a fact only\nif the fact is relevant. Relevance is a relational concept. No fact is\nrelevant in itself; it is relevant only in relation to another fact.\nThe term “probable” is often used to describe this\nrelation. We see two instances of this in the following well-known\ndefinitions. According to Stephen (1886: 2, emphasis added):  The word “relevant” means that any two\nfacts to which it is applied are so related to each other that\naccording to the common course of events one either taken by itself or\nin connection with other facts proves or renders probable the\npast, present, or future existence or non-existence of the\nother. The second definition is contained in the United States’\nFederal Rule of Evidence 401 which (in its restyled version) states\nthat evidence is relevant if “it has a tendency to make a fact\nmore or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence” (emphasis added). The word “probable” in\nthese and other standard definitions is sometimes construed as\ncarrying the mathematical meaning of\nprobability.[7]\nIn a leading article, Lempert gave this example to show how relevance\nturns on the likelihood ratio. The prosecution produces evidence that\nthe perpetrator’s blood found at the scene of the crime is type\nA. The accused has the same blood type. Suppose fifty percent of the\nsuspect population has type A blood. If the accused is in fact\nguilty, the probability that the blood found at the scene will be\ntype A is 1.0. But if he is in fact innocent, the probability of\nfinding type A blood at the scene is 0.5—that is, it matches\nthe background probability of type A blood from the suspect\npopulation. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the first\nprobability to the second—1.0:0.5 or, more simply, 2:1.\nEvidence is considered relevant so long as the likelihood ratio is\nother than 1:1 (Lempert 1977). If the ratio is 1:1, that means that\nthe probability of the evidence is the same whether the accused is\nguilty or innocent. The conventional view is that relevance in law is a binary concept:\nevidence is either relevant or it is not. So long as the likelihood\nratio is other than 1:1, the evidence is considered\nrelevant.[8]\nHowever, the greater the likelihood ratio deviates from 1:1, the\nhigher the so-called probative value of the evidence (that is, on one\ninterpretation of probative value). We will take a closer look at\nprobative value in section 3.1\nbelow. While the likelihood ratio may be useful as a heuristic device in\nanalysing evidential reasoning, it is controversial as to whether it\ncaptures correctly the concept of relevance. In the first place, it is\nunclear that the term “probable” in the standard\ndefinitions of relevance was ever intended as a reference to\nmathematical probability. Some have argued that relevance should be\nunderstood broadly such that any evidence would count as relevant so\nlong as it provides some reason in support of the conclusion that a\nproposition of fact material to the case is true or false (Pardo 2013:\n576–577). The mathematical conception of relevance has been disputed. At a\ntrial, it is very common for the opposing sides to present competing\naccounts of events that share certain features. To use Allen’s\nexample, the fact that the accused drove to a particular town on a\nparticular day and time is consistent with the prosecution’s\ncase that he was driving there to commit a murder and also with the\ndefence’s case that he was driving there to visit his mother.\nThis fact, being a common feature of both sides’ explanations of\nthe material events, is as consistent with the hypothesis of guilt as\nwith the hypothesis of innocence. On the likelihood ratio conception\nof relevance, this fact should be irrelevant and hence evidence of it\nshould not be allowed to be adduced. But in such cases, the court will\nlet the evidence in (Park et al. 2010: 10). The mathematical theory of\nrelevance cannot account for this. It is argued that an alternative\ntheory of relevance better fits legal practice and is thus to be\npreferred. On an explanatory conception of relevance, evidence is\nrelevant if it is explained by or provides a reason for believing the\nparticular explanation of the material events offered by the side\nadducing the evidence, and it remains relevant even where, as in our\nexample, the evidence also supports or forms part of the explanation\noffered by the opponent (Pardo and Allen 2008: 241–2; Pardo\n2013: 600). One possible response to the above challenge to the likelihood\nratio theory of relevance is to deny that it was ever meant to be\nthe exclusive test of relevance. Evidence is relevant if the\nlikelihood ratio is other than 1:1. But evidence may also be relevant\non other grounds, such as when it provides for a richer narrative or\nhelps the court in understanding other evidence. It is for these\nreasons that witnesses are routinely allowed to give their names and\nparties may present diagrams, charts and floor plans (so-called\n“demonstrative evidence”) at the trial (McCormick 2013:\n995). The admission of evidence in the scenario painted by Allen above\nhas been explained along a similar line (Park et al. 2010: 16). The concept of relevance examined in the preceding section is\ncommonly known as “logical relevance”. This is somewhat of\na misnomer: “Relevance is not a matter of logic, but depends on\nmatters of fact” (Haack 2004: 46). In our earlier example, the\nrelevance of the fact that the accused has type A blood depends\nobviously on the state of the world. On the understanding that\nrelevance is a probabilistic relation, it is tempting to think that in\ndescribing relevance as “logical”, one is subscribing to a\nlogical theory of probability (cf. Franklin 2011). However, the term\n“logical relevance” was not originally coined with this\nconnotation in mind. In the forensic context, “logic” is\nused loosely and refers to the stock of background beliefs or\ngeneralisations and the type of reasoning that judges and lawyers are\nfond of labelling as “commonsense” (MacCrimmon\n2001–2002; Twining 2006: 334–335). A key purpose of using the adjective “logical” is to\nflag the non-legal character of relevance. As Thayer (1898: 269)\nfamously claimed, relevance “is an affair of logic and not of\nlaw.” This is not to say that relevance has no legal dimension.\nThe law distinguishes between questions of law and questions of fact.\nAn issue of relevance poses a question of law that is for the judge to\ndecide and not the jury, and so far as relevance is defined in legal\nsources (for example, in Federal Rule of Evidence 401 mentioned\nabove), the judge must pay heed to the legal definition. But legal\ndefinitions of relevance are invariably very broad. Relevance is said\nto be a logical, and non-legal, concept in the sense that in answering\na question of relevance and in applying the definition of relevance,\nthe judge has necessarily to rely on extra-legal resources and is not\nbound by legal precedents. Returning to Federal Rule of Evidence 401,\nit states generally that evidence is relevant if “it has a\ntendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without\nthe evidence”. In deciding whether the evidence sought to be\nadduced does have this tendency, the judge has to look outside the\nlaw. Thayer was most insistent on this. As he put it, “[t]he law\nfurnishes no test of relevancy. For this, it tacitly refers to logic\nand general experience” (Thayer 1898: 265). That the\naccused’s favorite color is blue is, barring extraordinary\ncircumstances, irrelevant to the question of his intention to commit\ntheft. It is not the law that tells us so but “logic and general\nexperience”. On Thayer’s view, the law does not control or\nregulate the assessment of relevance; it assumes that judges are\nalready in possession of the (commonsense) resources to undertake this\nassessment. Wigmore adopts a different position. He argues, against Thayer,\nthat relevance is a legal concept. There are two strands to his\ncontention.  The first is that for evidence to be relevant in law,\n“a generally higher degree of probative value” is required\n“than would be asked in ordinary reasoning”;  legal relevance denotes…something more than\na minimum of probative value. Each single piece of evidence must have\na plus value. (cf. Pattenden 1996–7: 373)  As Wigmore sees it, the requirement of\n“plus value” guards against the jury “being\nsatisfied by matters of slight value, capable to being exaggerated by\nprejudice and hasty reasoning” (Wigmore 1983b: 969,\ncf. 1030–1031).  Opponents of Wigmore acknowledge that there\nmay be sound policy reasons for excluding evidence of low probative\nvalue. Receiving the evidence at the trial might raise a multiplicity\nof issues, take too much time and expense, confuse the jurors or\nproduce undue prejudice in their mind. When the judge excludes\nevidence for any of these reasons, and the judge has the discretion\nto do so in many countries, the evidence is excluded despite\nit being relevant (e.g., United States’ Federal Rule of\nEvidence 403).  Relevance is a relation between facts and the\naforesaid reasons for exclusion are extrinsic to that relation; they\nare grounded in considerations such as limitation of judicial\nresources and jury psychology. The notion of “plus value”\nconfuses relevance with extraneous considerations (James 1941;\nTrautman 1952). There is a second strand to Wigmore’s contention that\nrelevance is a legal concept. Relevance is legal in the sense that the\njudge is bound by previously decided cases (“judicial\nprecedents”) when he has to make a ruling on the relevance of a\nproposed item of evidence.  So long as Courts continue to declare…what\ntheir notions of logic are, just so long will there be rules of law\nwhich must be observed. (Wigmore 1983a: 691)\n  Wigmore cites in support the judgment of Cushing\nC.J. in State v LaPage where it was remarked:  [T]here are many instances in which the evidence of\nparticular facts as bearing on particular issues has been so often the\nsubject of discussion in courts of law, and so often ruled upon, that\nthe united logic of a great many judges and lawyers may be said to\nfurnish…the best evidence of what may be properly\ncalled common-sense, and thus to acquire the authority of\nlaw.  (1876 57 N.H. 245 at 288 [Supreme Court, New\nHampshire]) Wigmore’s position on relevance is strangely at odds with his\nstrong stand against the judge being bound by judicial precedents in\nassessing the weight or credibility of evidence (Wigmore 1913). More\nimportantly, the second strand of his argument also does not sit well\nwith the first strand. If, as Wigmore contends, evidence must have a\nplus value to make it legally relevant, the court has to consider the\nprobative value of the evidence and to weigh it against the amount of\ntime and expense likely to be incurred in receiving the evidence, the\navailability of other evidence, the risk of the evidence misleading or\nconfusing the trier of fact and so forth. Given that the assessment of\nplus value and, hence, legal relevance is so heavily contextual, it is\ndifficult to see how a judicial precedent can be of much value in\nanother case in determining a point of legal relevance (James 1941:\n702). We have just considered the first condition of receivability,\nnamely, relevance. That fact A is relevant to fact B is\nnot sufficient to make evidence of fact A receivable in\ncourt. In addition, B must be a “material”\nfact. The materiality of facts in a particular case is determined by\nthe law applicable to that case. In a criminal prosecution, it depends\non the law which defines the offence with which the accused is charged\nand at a civil trial, the law which sets out the elements of the legal\nclaim that is being brought against the defendant (Wigmore 1983a,\n15–19; Montrose 1954: 536–537). Imagine that the accused is prosecuted for the crime of rape and\nthe alleged victim’s behaviour (fact A) increases the\nprobability that she had consented to have sexual intercourse with the\naccused (fact B). On the probabilistic theory of relevance that\nwe have considered, A is relevant to B. Now suppose that\nthe alleged victim is a minor. Under criminal law, it does not matter\nwhether she had consented to the sexual intercourse. If B is of\nno legal consequence, the court will not allow evidence of A to\nbe adduced for the purpose of proving B: the most obvious\nreason is that it is a waste of time to receive the evidence. Not all material facts are necessarily in dispute. Suppose the\nplaintiff sues the defendant for breach of contract. Under the law of\ncontract, to succeed in this action, the plaintiff must prove the\nfollowing three elements: that there was a contract between the\nparties, that the defendant was in breach of the contract, and that\nthe plaintiff had suffered loss as a result of that breach. The\ndefendant may concede that there was a contract and that he was in\nbreach of it but deny that the plaintiff had suffered any loss as a\nresult of that breach. In such a situation, only the last of the\nmaterial facts is disputed. Following Stephen’s terminology, a\ndisputed material fact is called a “fact in issue”\n(Stephen 1872: 28). The law does not allow evidence to be adduced to prove facts that\nare immaterial or that are not in issue. “Relevance” is\noften used in the broader sense that encompasses the concepts under\ndiscussion. Evidence is sometimes described as\n“irrelevant” not for the reason that no logical inference\ncan be drawn to the proposition that is sought to be proved (in our\nexample, A is strictly speaking relevant to B) but\nbecause that proposition is not material or not disputed (in our\nexample, B is not \nmaterial).[9] \nThis broader usage of the term\n“relevance”, though otherwise quite harmless, does not\npromote conceptual clarity because it runs together different\nconcepts (see James 1941: 690–691; Trautman 1952: 386; Montrose\n1954: 537). A further condition must be satisfied for evidence to be received\nin legal proceedings. There are legal rules that prohibit evidence\nfrom being presented at a trial even though it is relevant to a\nfactual proposition that is material and in issue. These rules render\nthe evidence to which they apply “inadmissible” and\nrequire the judge to “exclude” it. Two prominent examples\nof such rules of admissibility or rules of exclusion are the rule\nagainst hearsay evidence and the rule against character evidence. This\nsection considers the relation between the concept of relevance and\nthe concept of admissibility. The next section\n(section 2.3.2) discusses general arguments\nfor and against exclusionary or admissibility rules. Here, again, the terminology is imprecise. Admissibility and\nreceivability are not clearly distinguished. It is common\nfor irrelevant evidence, or evidence of\nan immaterial fact to be described as\n“inadmissible”. What this means is that the court will\nrefuse to receive evidence if it is irrelevant or immaterial. But,\nimportantly, the court also excludes evidence for reasons other than\nirrelevance and immateriality. For Montrose, there is merit in\nrestricting the concept of “inadmissibility” to the\nexclusion of evidence based on those other reasons (Montrose 1954:\n541–543). If evidence is rejected on the ground of irrelevance,\nit is, as Thayer (1898: 515) puts it, “the rule of reason that\nrejects it”; if evidence is rejected under an admissibility or\nexclusionary rule, the rejection is by force of law. The concepts of\nadmissibility and materiality should also be kept apart. This is\nbecause admissibility or exclusionary rules serve purposes and\nrationales that are distinct from the law defining the crime or civil\nclaim that is before the court and it is this law that determines the\nmateriality of facts in the dispute. Thayer (1898: 266, 530) was influential in his view that the law of\nevidence has no say on logical relevance and that its main business is\nin dealing with admissibility. If the evidence is logically\nirrelevant, it must for that reason be excluded. If the evidence is\nlogically relevant, it will be received by the court unless the\nlaw—in the form of an exclusionary or admissibility\nrule—requires its exclusion. In this scheme, the concept of\nrelevance and the concept of admissibility are distinct: indeed,\nadmissibility rules presuppose the relevance of the evidence to which\nthey apply. Stephen appears to hold a different view, one in which the concept\nof admissibility is apparently absorbed by the concept of relevance.\nTake, for example, Stephen’s analysis of the rule that in\ngeneral no evidence may be adduced to prove “statements as to\nfacts made by persons not called as witnesses”, in short,\nhearsay (Stephen 1872: 122). As a general rule, no evidence may be\ngiven of hearsay because the law prohibits it. The question then\narises as to the rationale for this prohibition. Stephen’s\nanswer to this question is often taken to be that hearsay is not\n“relevant” and he is criticised for failing to see the\ndifference between relevance and admissibility (Whitworth 1881: 3;\nThayer 1898: 266–268; Pollock 1876, 1899; Wigmore 1983a:\n§12). His critics point out that hearsay has or can have\nprobative value and evidence of hearsay is excluded despite or\nregardless of its relevance. On the generalisation that there is no\nsmoke without fire, the fact that a person claimed that p in a\nstatement made out-of-court does or can have a bearing on the\nprobability that p, and p may be (logically relevant to)\na material fact in the dispute. Interestingly, Stephen seemed to have conceded as much. He\nacknowledged that a policeman or a lawyer engaged in preparing a case\nwould be negligent if he were to shut his ears to hearsay. Hearsay is\none of those facts that are “apparently relevant but not really\nso” (Stephen 1872: 122; see also Stephen 1886: xi). In claiming\nthat hearsay is irrelevant, Stephen appears to be merely stating the\neffect of the law: the law requires that hearsay be treated as\nirrelevant. He offered a variety of justifications for excluding\nhearsay evidence: its admissibility would “present a great\ntemptation to indolent judges to be satisfied with second-hand\nreports” and “open a wide door to fraud”, and\n“[e]veryone would be at the mercy of people who might tell a\nlie, and whose evidence could neither be tested nor\ncontradicted” (Stephen 1872: 124–125). For his detractors,\nthese are reasons of policy and fairness and it disserves clarity to\nsneak such considerations into the concept of relevance. Although there is force to the criticism that Stephen had\nunhelpfully conflated admissibility and relevance (understood as\nlogical relevance), something can perhaps be said in his defence.\nExclusionary rules or rules of admissibility—at any rate, many\nof them—are more accurately seen as excluding forms of\nreasoning rather than prohibiting proof of certain types of facts\n(McNamara 1986). This is certainly true of the hearsay rule. On one\nauthoritative definition of the rule (decision of the Privy Council\nin Subramaniam v PP, (1956) 1 Weekly Law Reports\n965), what it prohibits is the use of a hearsay statement to prove\nthe truth of the facts asserted\ntherein.[10]\nThe objection is to the drawing of the inference that p\nfrom X’s out-of-court statement that p\nwhere X is not available to be examined in court. But the\ncourt will allow the evidence of X’s hearsay statement\nto be admitted—it will allow proof of the statement—\nwhere the purpose of adducing the evidence is to persuade the court\nthat X did make the statement and this fact is relevant for\nsome other purpose. For instance, it may be relevant as to the state\nof mind of the person hearing the statement, and his state of mind\nmay be material to his defence of having acted under duress. Hence,\ntwo writers have commented that “there is no such thing as\nhearsay evidence, only hearsay uses” (Roberts\nand Zuckerman 2010: 385). Other admissibility rules are also more accurately seen as targeted\nat forms of reasoning and not types of facts. In the United States,\nFederal Rule of Evidence 404(a)(1) bars the use of evidence of a\nperson’s character “to prove that on a particular occasion\nthe person acted in accordance with the character” and Federal\nRule of Evidence 404(b)(1) provides that evidence of a crime or wrong  is not admissible to prove a person’s\ncharacter in order to show that on a particular occasion the person\nacted in accordance with the character.\n  It is doubtful that evidence of a person’s\ncharacter and past behaviour can have no probabilistic bearing on his\nbehaviour on a particular occasion; on a probabilistic conception of\nrelevance, it is difficult to see why the evidence is not\nrelevant. Even so, there may be policy, moral or other reasons for\nthe law to prohibit certain uses of character evidence. In declaring\na fact as irrelevant for a particular purpose, we are not necessarily\nsaying or implying anything about probability. We may be expressing a\nnormative judgment. For policy, moral or other reasons, the law takes\nthe position that hearsay or the accused’s character or\nprevious misconduct must not be used as the premise for a particular\nline of reasoning. The line of reasoning might be morally\nobjectionable (“give a dog a bad name and hang him for\nit”) or it might be unfair to permit the drawing of the\ninference when the opponent was not given a fair opportunity to\nchallenge it (as in the hearsay situation) (Ho 2008: chs. 5, 6). If\nwe take a normative conception of relevance instead of a logical or\nprobabilistic one, it is not an abuse of language to describe\ninadmissible evidence as irrelevant if what is meant is that the\nevidence ought not to be taken into account in a certain way. On one historical account, admissibility or exclusionary rules are\nthe product of the jury system where citizens untrained in assessing\nevidence sit as judges of fact. These rules came about because it was\nthought necessary to keep away from inexperienced jurors certain types\nof evidence that may mislead or be mishandled by them—for\ninstance, evidence to which they are likely to give too much weight or\nthat carries the risk of creating unfair prejudice in their minds\n(Thayer 1898; Wigmore 1935: 4–5). Epistemic paternalism is\nsupposedly at play (Leiter 1997: 814–5; Allen and Leiter 2001:\n1502).  Subscription to this theory has generated pressure for the\nabolition of exclusionary rules with the decline of the jury system\nand the replacement of lay persons with professional judges as triers\nof fact.  There is doubt as to the historical accuracy of this\naccount; at any rate, it does not appear capable of explaining the\ngrowth of all exclusionary rules (Morgan 1936–37; Nance 1988:\n278–294). Even if the theory is right, it does not necessarily follow that\nexclusionary rules should be abolished once the jury system is\nremoved.  Judges may be as susceptible to the same cognitive and other\nfailings as the jury and there may be the additional risk that judges\nmay over-estimate their own cognitive and intellectual abilities in\ntheir professional domain. Hence, there remains a need for the\nconstraints of legal rules (Schauer 2006: 185–193). But the\nefficacy of these rules in a non-jury system is questionable. The\nprocedural reality is that judges will have to be exposed to the\nevidence in order to decide on its admissibility. Since a judge cannot\nrealistically be expected to erase the evidence from his mind once he\nhas decided to exclude it, there seems little point in excluding the\nevidence; we might as well let the evidence in and allow judge to give\nthe evidence the probative value that it deserves (Mnookin 2006;\nDamaška 2006; cf. Ho 2008: 44–46). Bentham was a strong critic of exclusionary rules. He was much in\nfavour of “freedom of proof” understood as free access to\ninformation and the absence of formal rules that restrict such access\n(Twining 2006: 232, n 65). The direct object of legal procedure is the\n“rectitude of decision”, by which he means the correction\napplication of substantive law to the true facts. The exclusion of\nrelevant evidence—evidence capable of casting light on the\ntruth—is detrimental to this end. Hence, no relevant evidence\nshould be excluded; the only exceptions he would allow are where the\nevidence is superfluous or its production would involve preponderant\ndelay, expense or vexation (Bentham 1827: Book IX; Bentham 1825: Book\nVII; Twining 1985: ch. 2). Bentham’s argument has been\nchallenged on various fronts. It is said that he overvalued the\npursuit of truth, undervalued procedural fairness and procedural\nrights, and placed too much faith in officials, underestimating the\nrisk of abuse when they are given discretion unfettered by rules\n(Twining 1985: 70–71). Even if we agree with Bentham that rectitude of decision is the aim\nof legal procedure and that achieving accuracy in fact-finding is\nnecessary to attain this aim, it is not obvious that a rule-based\napproach to admissibility will undermine this aim in the long run.\nSchauer has defended exclusionary rules of evidence along a\nrule-consequentialist line. Having the triers of fact follow rules on\ncertain matters instead of allowing them the discretion to exercise\njudgment on a case-by-case basis may produce the greatest number of\nfavourable outcomes in the aggregate. It is in the nature of a formal\nrule that it has to be followed even when doing so might not serve the\nbackground reason for the rule. If hearsay evidence is thought to be\ngenerally unreliable, the interest of accuracy may be better served\noverall to require such evidence to be excluded without regard to its\nreliability in individual cases. Given the imperfection of human\nreason and our suspicion about the reasoning ability of the\nfact-finder, allowing decisions to be taken individually on the\nreliability and admissibility of hearsay evidence might over time\nproduce a larger proportion of misjudgements than on the rule-based\napproach (Schauer 2006: 180–185; Schauer 2008). However, this\nargument is based on a large assumption about the likely effects of\nhaving exclusionary rules and not having them, and there is no strong\nempirical basis for thinking that the consequences are or will be as\nalleged (Goldman 1999: 292–295; Laudan 2006: 121–122). Other supporters of exclusionary rules build their arguments on a\nwide range of different considerations. The literature is too vast to\nenter into details. Here is a brief mention of some arguments. On one\ntheory, some exclusionary rules are devices that serve as incentives\nfor lawyers to produce the epistemically best evidence that is\nreasonably available (Nance 1988). For example, if lawyers are not\nallowed to rely on second-hand (hearsay) evidence, they will be forced\nto seek out better (first-hand) evidence. On another theory,\nexclusionary rules allocate the risks of error. Again, consider\nhearsay. The problem with allowing a party to rely on hearsay evidence\nis that the opponent has no opportunity to cross-examine the original\nmaker of the statement and is thus deprived of an important means of\nattacking the reliability of the evidence. Exclusionary rules in\ngeneral insulate the party against whom the evidence is sought to be\nadduced from the risks of error that the evidence, if admitted, would\nhave introduced. The distribution of such risks is said to be a\npolitical decision that should not be left to the discretion of\nindividual fact-finders (Stein 2005; cf. Redmayne 2006 and Nance\n2007a: 154–164). It has also been argued that the hearsay rule\nand the accompanying right to confront witnesses promote the public\nacceptance and stability of legal verdicts. If the court relies on\ndirect evidence, it can claim superior access to the facts (having\nheard from the horse’s mouth, so to speak) and this also reduces\nthe risk of new information emerging after the trial to discredit the\ninference that was drawn from the hearsay evidence (the original maker\nof the statement might turn up after the trial to deny the truth of\nthe statement that was attributed to him) (Nesson 1985:\n1372–1375; cf. Park 1986; Goldman 1999: 282; Goldman 2005:\n166–167). Section 2 above dealt with\nthe conditions that must be satisfied for a witness’s testimony,\na document or an object to be received as evidence in legal\nproceedings. Suppose the judge decides to let the evidence be\npresented at the trial. Having heard or seen the evidence, the\nfact-finder now has to weigh it in reaching the verdict. Weight can\nrefer to any of the following three properties of evidence: (a) the\nprobative value of individual items of evidence, (b) the sufficiency\nof the whole body of evidence adduced at the trial in meeting the\nstandard of proof, or (c) the relative completeness of this body of\nevidence.  The first two aspects of weight are familiar to legal\npractitioners but the third has been confined to academic\ndiscussions. These three ideas are discussed in the same order\nbelow. In reaching the verdict, the trier of fact has to assess the\nprobative value of the individual items of evidence which have been\nreceived at the trial. The concept of probative value can also play a\nrole at the prior stage (which was the focus\nin section 2) where the judge\nhas to make a ruling on whether to receive the evidence in the first\nplace. In many legal systems, if the judge finds the probative value\nof a proposed item of evidence to be low and substantially outweighed\nby countervailing considerations, such as the risk of causing unfair\nprejudice or confusion, the judge can refuse to let the jury hear or\nsee the evidence (see, e.g., Rule 403 of the United States’\nFederal Rules of Evidence). The concept of probative value (or, as it is also called, probative\nforce) is related to the concept of\nrelevance. Section 2.1.2 above introduced\nand examined the claim that the likelihood ratio is the measure of\nrelevance. To recapitulate, the likelihood of an item of\nevidence, E (in our previous example, the likelihood of a\nblood type match) given a hypothesis H (that the accused is in\nfact guilty) is compared with the likelihood of E given the\nnegation of H (that the accused is in fact innocent). Prior to\nthe introduction of E, one may have formed some belief\nabout H based on other evidence that one already has. This\nprior belief does not affect the likelihood ratio since its\ncomputation is based on the alternative assumptions that H is\ntrue and that H is false (Kaye 1986a; Kaye and Koehler 2003;\ncf. Davis and Follette 2002 and 2003). Rulings on relevance are\ntypically made in the course of the trial as and when an objection is\nraised to the introduction of evidence. The relevance of an item of\nevidence is supposedly assessed on its own, without consideration of\nother evidence (Mnookin 2013:\n1544–5).[11] Probative value, as with relevance, has been explained in terms of\nthe likelihood ratio (for detailed examples, see Nance and Morris\n2002 and Finkelstein and Levin 2003).  It was noted earlier that\nevidence is either relevant or not, and, on the prevailing\nunderstanding, it is relevant so long as the likelihood ratio\ndeviates from 1:1. But evidence can be more or less probative\ndepending on the value of the likelihood ratio. In our earlier\nexample, the probative value of a blood type match was 1.0:0.5 (or\n2:1) as 50% of the suspect population had the same blood type as the\naccused. But suppose the blood type is less common and only 25% of\nthe suspect population has it. The probative value of the evidence is\nnow 1.0:0.25 (or 4:1). In both cases, the evidence is relevant; but\nthe probative value is greater in the latter than in the former\nscenario. It is tempting to describe probative value as the degree of\nrelevance but this would be misleading as relevance in law is a\nbinary concept. There is a second way of thinking about probative value. On the\nsecond view, but not on the first, the probative value of an item of\nevidence is assessed contextually. The probative value of E may\nbe low given one state of the other evidence and substantial given a\ndifferent body of other evidence (Friedman 1986; Friedman and Park\n2003; cf. Davis and Follette 2002, 2003). Where the other evidence\nshows that a woman had died from falling down an escalator at a mall\nwhile she was out shopping, her husband’s history of spousal\nbattery is unlikely to have any probative value in proving that he was\nresponsible for her death. But where the other evidence shows that the\nwife had died of injuries in the matrimonial home, and the question is\nwhether the injuries were sustained from an accidental fall from the\nstairs or inflicted by the husband, the same evidence of spousal\nbattery will now have significant probative value. On the second view, the probative value of an item of evidence\n(E) is not measured simply by the likelihood ratio as it is on\nthe first view. Probative value is understood as the degree to\nwhich E increases (or decreases) the probability of the\nproposition or hypothesis (H) in support of (or against)\nwhich E is led. The probative value of E is measured by\nthe difference between the probability of H given E (the\nposterior probability) and the probability of H absent E\n(the prior probability) (Friedman 1986; James 1941: 699). Probative value of \\(E = P(H | E) - P(H)\\) \\(P(H | E)\\) (the posterior probability) is derived by applying\nBayes’ theorem—that is, by multiplying the prior\nprobability by the likelihood ratio (see discussion\nin section 3.2.2 below). On the\npresent view, while the likelihood ratio does not itself measure the\nprobative value of E, it is nevertheless a crucial component in\nthe assessment. A major difficulty with both of the mathematical conceptions of\nprobative value that we have just examined is that for most evidence,\nobtaining the figures necessary for computing the likelihood ratio is\nproblematic (Allen 1991: 380). Exceptionally, quantitative base rates\ndata exist, as in our blood type example. Where objective data is\nunavailable, the fact-finder has to draw on background experience and\nknowledge to come up with subjective values. In our blood type\nexample, a critical factor in computing the likelihood ratio was the\npercentage of the “suspect population” who had the same\nblood type as the accused. “Reference class” is the\ngeneral statistical term for the role that the suspect population\nplays in this analysis.  How should the reference class of\n“suspect population” be defined? Should we look at the\npopulation of the country as a whole or of the town or the street\nwhere the alleged murder occurred? What if it occurred at an\ninternational airport where most the people around are foreign\nvisitors? Or what if it is shown that both the accused and the victim\nwere at the time of the alleged murder inmates of the same prison?\nShould we then take the prison population as the reference class? The\ndistribution of blood types may differ according to which reference\nclass is selected. Sceptics of mathematical modelling of probative\nvalue emphasize that data from different reference classes will have\ndifferent explanatory power and the choice of the reference class is\nopen to—and should be subjected to—contextual argument and\nrequires the exercise of judgment; there is no a priori way of\ndetermining the correct reference class. (On the reference class\nproblem in legal fact finding, see, in addition to references cited in\nthe rest of this section, Colyvan, Regan and Ferson 2001; Tillers\n2005; Allen and Roberts 2007. Some writers have proposed quantifiable ways of selecting, or\nassisting in the selection, of the appropriate reference class. On one\nsuggestion, the court does not have to search for the optimal\nreference class. A general characteristic of an adversarial system of\ntrial is that the judge plays a passive role; it is up to the parties\nto come up with the arguments on which they want to rely and to\nproduce evidence in support of their respective arguments. This\nadversarial setting makes the reference class problem more manageable\nas the court need only to decide which of the reference classes relied\nupon by the parties is to be preferred. And this can be done by\napplying one of a variety of technical criteria that statisticians\nhave developed for comparing and selecting statistical models (Cheng\n2009). Another suggestion is to use the statistical method of\n“feature selection” instead. The ideal reference class is\ndefined by the intersection of all relevant features of the case, and\na feature is relevant if it is correlated to the matter under enquiry\n(Franklin 2010, 2011: 559–561). For instance, if the amount of\ndrug likely to be smuggled is reasonably believed to co-vary with the\nairport through which it is smuggled, the country of origin and the\ntime period, and there is no evidence that any other feature is\nrelevant on which data is available, the ideal reference class is the\nclass of drug smugglers passing through that airport originating from\nthat country and during that time period. Both suggestions have\nself-acknowledged limitations: not least, they depend on the\navailability of suitable data. Also, as Franklin stresses, while\nstatistical methods “have advice to offer on how courts should\njudge quantitative evidence”, they do so “in a way that\nsupplements normal intuitive legal argument rather than replacing it\nby a formula” (Franklin 2010: 22). The reference class problem is not confined to the probabilistic\nassessment of the probative value of individual items of evidence. It\nis a general difficulty with a mathematical approach to legal\nproof. In particular, the same problem arises on a probabilistic\ninterpretation of the standard of proof when the court has to\ndetermine whether the standard is met based on all the evidence\nadduced in the case. This topic is explored\nin section 3.2 below but it is convenient\nat this juncture to illustrate how the reference class problem can\nalso arise in this connection. Let it be that the plaintiff sues Blue\nBus Company to recover compensation for injuries sustained in an\naccident. The plaintiff testifies, and the court believes on the basis\nof his testimony, that he was run down by a recklessly driven bus.\nUnfortunately, it was dark at the time and he cannot tell whether the\nbus belonged to Blue Bus Company. Assume further that there is also\nevidence which establishes that Blue Bus Company owns 75% of the buses\nin the town where the accident occurred and the remaining 25% is owned\nby Red Bus Company. No other evidence is presented. To use the data as\nthe basis for inferring that there is 0.75 probability that the bus\ninvolved in the accident was owned by Blue Bus Company would seem to\nprivilege the reference class of “buses operating in the\ntown” over other possible reference classes such as “buses\nplying the street where the accident occurred” or “buses\noperating at the time in question” (Allen and Pardo 2007a: 109).\nDifferent reference classes may produce very different likelihood\nratios. It is crucial how the reference class is chosen and this is\nultimately a matter of argument and judgment. Any choice of reference\nclass (other than the class that shares every feature of the\nparticular incident, which is, in effect, the unique incident itself)\nis in principle contestable. Critics of the mathematization of legal proof raise this point as\nan example of inherent limitations to the mathematical modelling of\nprobative value (Allen and Pardo\n2007a).[12]\nAllen and Pardo propose an alternative, the explanatory theory of\nlegal proof. They claim that this theory has the advantage of\navoiding the reference class problem because it does not attempt to\nquantify probative value (Pardo 2005: 374–383; Pardo and Allen\n2008: 261, 263; Pardo 2013: 600–601). Suppose a man is accused\nof killing his wife. Evidence is produced of his extra-marital\naffair. The unique probative value of the accused’s infidelity\ncannot be mathematically computed from statistical base rates of\ninfidelity and uxoricides (husbands murdering wives). In assessing\nits probative value, the court should look instead at how strongly\nthe evidence of infidelity supports the explanation of the material\nevents put forward by the side adducing the evidence and how strongly\nit challenges the explanation offered by the opponent. For instance,\nthe prosecution may be producing the evidence to buttress its case\nthat the accused wanted to get rid of his wife so that he could marry\nhis mistress, and the defence may be advancing the alternative theory\nthat the couple was unusual in that they condoned extra-marital\naffairs and had never let it affect their loving relationship. How\nmuch probative value the evidence of infidelity has depends on the\nstrength of the explanatory connections between it and the competing\nhypotheses, and this is not something that can be quantified. But the disagreement in this debate is not as wide as it might\nappear. The critics concede that formal models for evaluating evidence\nin law may be useful. What they object to is  scholarship arguing … that such models\nestablish the correct or accurate probative value of evidence, and\nthus implying that any deviations from such models lead to inaccurate\nor irrational outcomes. (Allen and Pardo 2007b: 308)\n  On the other side, it is acknowledged that there\nare limits to mathematical formalisation of evidential reasoning in\nlaw (Franklin 2012: 238–9) and that context, argument and\njudgment do play a role in identifying the reference class (Nance\n2007b). In the section 3.1 above, we\nconcentrated on the weight of evidence in the sense of probative value\nof individual items of evidence. The concept of weight can also apply\nto the total body of evidence presented at the trial; here\n“weight” is commonly referred to as the “sufficiency\nof evidence”. The law assigns the legal burden of proof between\nparties to a dispute. For instance, at a criminal trial, the accused\nis presumed innocent and the burden is on the prosecution to prove\nthat he is guilty as charged. To secure a conviction, the body of\nevidence presented at the trial must be sufficient to meet the\nstandard of proof. Putting this generally, a verdict will be given in\nfavour of the side bearing the legal burden of proof only if, having\nconsidered all of the evidence, the fact-finder is satisfied that the\napplicable standard of proof is met. The standard of proof has been\ngiven different interpretations. On one interpretation, the standard of proof is a probabilistic\nthreshold. In civil cases, the standard is the “balance of\nprobabilities” or, as it is more popularly called in the United\nStates, the “preponderance of evidence”. The plaintiff\nwill satisfy this standard and succeed in his claim only if there is,\non all the evidence adduced in the case, more than 0.5 probability of\nhis claim being true. At criminal trials, the standard for a guilty\nverdict is “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”. Here the\nprobabilistic threshold is thought to be much higher than 0.5 but\ncourts have eschewed any attempt at authoritative quantification.\nTypically, a notional value, such as 0.9 or 0.95, is assumed by\nwriters for the sake of discussion. For the prosecution to secure a\nguilty verdict, the evidence adduced at the trial must establish the\ncriminal charge to a degree of probability that crosses this\nthreshold. Where, as in the United States, there is an intermediate\nstandard of “clear and convincing evidence” which is\nreserved for special cases, the probabilistic threshold is said to lie\nsomewhere between 0.5 and the threshold for proof beyond reasonable\ndoubt. Kaplan was among the first to employ decision theory to develop a\nframework for setting the probabilistic threshold that represents the\nstandard of proof. Since the attention in this area of the law tends\nto be on the avoidance of errors and their undesirable consequences,\nhe finds it convenient to focus on disutility rather than utility. The\nexpected disutility of an outcome is the product of the disutility\n(broadly, the social costs) of that outcome and the probability of\nthat outcome. Only two options are generally available to the court:\nin criminal cases, it must either convict or acquit the accused and in\ncivil cases, it has to give judgment either for the plaintiff or for\nthe defendant. At a criminal trial, the decision should be made to\nconvict where the expected disutility of a decision to acquit is\ngreater than the expected disutility of a decision to convict. This is\nso as to minimize the expected disutilities. To put this in the form\nof an equation: P is the probability that the accused is guilty on the basis\nof all the evidence adduced in the case, Dag is the\ndisutility of acquitting a guilty person and Dci is the\ndisutility of convicting an innocent person. A similar analysis\napplies to civil cases: the defendant should be found liable where the\nexpected disutility of finding him not liable when he is in fact\nliable exceeds the expected disutility of finding him liable when he\nis in fact not liable. On this approach, a person should be convicted of a crime only\nwhere P is greater than: The same formula applies in civil cases except that the two\ndisutilities (Dag and Dci) will have to be replaced\nby their civil equivalents (framed in terms of the disutility of\nawarding the judgment to a plaintiff who in fact does not deserve it\nand disutility of awarding the judgment to a defendant who in fact\ndoes not deserve it).  On this formula, the crucial determinant of\nthe standard of proof is the ratio of the two disutilities. In the\ncivil context, the disutility of an error in one direction is deemed\nequal to the disutility of an error in the other direction. Hence, a\nprobability of liability of greater than 0.5 would suffice for a\ndecision to enter judgment against the defendant (see Redmayne 1996:\n171). The situation is\ndifferent at a criminal trial. Dci, the disutility of\nconvicting an innocent person is considered far greater\nthan Dag, the disutility of acquitting a guilty\nperson.[13]\nHence, the probability threshold for a conviction should be much\nhigher than 0.5 (Kaplan 1968: 1071–1073; see also Cullison\n1969). An objection to this analysis is that it is incomplete. It is not\nenough to compare the costs of erroneous verdicts. The utility of an\naccurate conviction and the utility of an accurate acquittal should\nalso be considered and factored into the equation (Lillquist 2002:\n108).[14]\nThis results in the following modification of the formula for setting\nthe standard of proof: Ucg is the utility of convicting the guilty, Uag\nis the utility of acquitting the guilty, Uai is the utility\nof acquitting the innocent and Uci the utility of convicting\nthe innocent. Since the relevant utilities depend on the individual\ncircumstances, such as the seriousness of the crime and the severity\nof the punishment, the decision-theoretic account of the standard of\nproof would seem, on both the simple and the modified version, to lead\nto the conclusion that the probabilistic threshold should vary from\ncase to case (Lillquist 2002; Bartels 1981; Laudan and Saunders\n2009). In other words, the standard of proof should be a flexible or\nfloating one. This view is perceived to be problematic. First, it falls short descriptively. The law requires the court to\napply a fixed standard of proof for all cases within the relevant\ncategory. In theory, all criminal cases are governed by the same high\nstandard and all civil cases are governed by the same lower standard.\nThat said, it is unclear whether factfinders in reality adhere\nstrictly to a fixed standard of proof (see Kaplow 2012:\n805-809). The argument is better interpreted as a normative argument—as\nadvancing the claim about what the law ought to be and not what it\nis. The standard of proof ought to vary from case to case. But this\nproposal faces a second objection. For convenience, the objection will\nbe elaborated in the criminal setting; in principle, civil litigants\nhave the same two rights that we shall identify. According to Dworkin\n(1981), moral harm arises as an objective moral fact when a person is\nerroneously convicted of a crime. Moral harm is distinguished from the\nbare harm (in the form of pain, frustration, deprivation of liberty\nand so forth) that is suffered by a wrongfully convicted and punished\nperson. While accused persons have the right not to be convicted if\ninnocent, they do not have the right to the most accurate procedure\npossible for ascertaining their guilt or innocence. However, they do\nhave the right that a certain weight or importance be attached to the\nrisk of moral harm in the design of procedural and evidential rules\nthat affect the level of accuracy. Accused persons have the further\nright to a consistent weighting of the importance of moral harm and\nthis further right stems from their right to equal concern and\nrespect.  Dworkin’s theory carries an implication bearing on the\npresent debate. It is arguable that to adopt a floating standard of\nproof would offend the second right insofar as it means treating\naccused persons differently with respect to the evaluation of the\nimportance of avoiding moral harm. This difference in treatment is\nreflected in the different level of the risk of moral harm to which\nthey are exposed. There is a third objection to a floating standard of\nproof. Picinali (2013) sees fact-finding as a theoretical exercise\nthat engages the question of what to believe about the disputed\nfacts. What counts as “reasonable” for the purposes of\napplying the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt is accordingly\na matter for theoretical as opposed to practical reasoning. Briefly,\ntheoretical reasoning is concerned with what to believe whereas\npractical reasoning is about what to do. Only reasons for belief are\ngermane in theoretical reasoning. While considerations that bear on\nthe assessment of utility and disutility provide reasons for action,\nthey are not reasons for believing in the accused’s\nguilt. Decision theory cannot therefore be used to support a variable\napplication of the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The third criticism of a flexible standard of proof does not\ndirectly challenge the decision-theoretic analysis of the standard of\nproof. On that analysis, it would seem that the maximisation of\nexpected utility is the criterion for selecting the appropriate\nprobabilistic threshold to apply and it plays no further role in\ndeciding whether that threshold, once selected, is met on the\nevidence adduced in the particular case. It is not incompatible with\nthe decision-theoretic analysis to insist that the question of\nwhether the selected threshold is met should be governed wholly by\nepistemic considerations. However, it is arguable that what counts as\ngood or strong enough theoretical reason for judging, and hence\nbelieving, that something is true is dependent on the context, such\nas what is at stake in believing that it is true. More is at stake at\na trial involving the death penalty than in a case of petty\nshop-lifting; accordingly, there should be stronger epistemic\njustification for a finding of guilt in the first than in the second\ncase. Philosophical literature on epistemic contextualism and on\ninterest-relative accounts of knowledge and justified belief has been\ndrawn upon to support a variant standard of proof (Ho 2008: ch. 4;\nsee also Amaya 2015:\n525–531).[15] The premise of the third criticism is that the trier of fact has to\nmake a finding on a disputed factual proposition based on his belief\nin the proposition. This is contentious. Beliefs are involuntary; we\ncannot believe something by simply deciding to believe it. The\ndominant view is that beliefs are context-independent; at any given\nmoment, we cannot believe something in one context and not believe it\nin another.  On the other hand, legal fact-finding involves choice and\ndecision making and it is dependent on the context; for example,\nevidence that is strong enough to justify a finding of fact in a civil\ncase may not be strong enough to justify the same finding in a\ncriminal case where the standard of proof is higher. It has been\nargued that the fact-finder has to base his findings not on what he\nbelieves but what he accepts (Cohen 1991, 1992: 117–125,\nBeltrán 2006; cf. Picinali 2013: 868–869). Belief and\nacceptance are propositional attitudes: they are different attitudes\nthat one can have in relation to a proposition. As Cohen (1992: 4)\nexplains,  to accept that p is to have or adopt a\npolicy of deeming, positing or postulating\nthat p—i.e. of including that proposition or rule\namong one’s premises for deciding what to do or think in a\nparticular context. Understanding standards of proof in terms of mathematical\nprobabilities is controversial. It is said to raise a number of\nparadoxes (Cohen 1977; Allen 1986, 1991; Allen and Leiter 2001;\nRedmayne 2008). Let us return to our previous example. The defendant,\nBlue Bus Company, owns 75% of the buses in the town where the\nplaintiff was injured by a recklessly driven bus and the remaining 25%\nis owned by Red Bus Company. No other evidence is presented. Leaving\naside the reference class problem discussed above, there is a 0.75\nprobability that the accident was caused by a bus owned by the\ndefendant. On the probabilistic interpretation of the applicable\nstandard of proof (that is, the balance of probabilities), the\nevidence should be sufficient to justify a verdict in the\nplaintiff’s favour. But all lawyers would agree that the\nevidence is insufficient. The puzzle is why this is so. Various\nattempts have been made to solve this puzzle (for surveys of these\nattempts, see Enoch and Fisher 2015: 565–571; Redmayne 2008, Ho\n2008: 135–143, 168–170). On the solution offered by\nThomson, the statistical evidence (the 75% ownership of buses) is not\ncausally connected with the fact sought to be proved (the accident)\nand as such cannot justify belief in or knowledge of the fact (Thomson\n1986). But it is questionable that the court should aim at knowledge\nof the disputed fact and not simply at accuracy in its finding (Enoch,\nSpectre and Fisher 2012; Enoch and Fisher 2015). There is another paradox in the mathematical interpretation of the\nstandard of proof. This is the “conjunction paradox”. To\nsucceed in a civil claim (or a criminal prosecution), the plaintiff\n(or the prosecution) will have to prove the material facts—or\n“elements”—that constitute the civil claim (or\ncriminal charge) that is before the court (see discussion of\n“materiality” in section 2.2\nabove). Imagine a claim under the law of negligence that rests on two\nelements: a breach of duty of care by the defendant (element A)\nand causation of harm to the plaintiff (element B). To win the\ncase, the plaintiff is legally required to prove A\nand B. For the sake of simplicity, let A and B be\nmutually independent events. Suppose the evidence establishes A\nto a probability of 0.6 and B to a probability of 0.7. On the\nmathematical interpretation of the civil standard of proof, the\nplaintiff should succeed in his claim since the probability with\nrespect to each of the elements exceeds 0.5. However, according to the\nmultiplication rule of conventional probability calculus, the\nprobability that A and B are both true is the product of\ntheir respective probabilities; in this example, it is only 0.42\n(obtained by multiplying 0.6 with 0.7). Thus, the overall probability\nis greater that the defendant deserves to win than that the plaintiff\ndeserves to win, and yet the verdict is awarded in favour of the\nplaintiff. One way of avoiding the conjunction paradox is to take the position\nthat it should not be enough for each element to cross the\nprobabilistic threshold; the plaintiff (or the prosecution) should win\nonly if the probability of the plaintiff’s (or\nprosecution’s) case as a whole exceeds the applicable\nprobabilistic threshold. So, in our example, the plaintiff should lose\nsince the overall probability is below 0.5. But this suggested\nsolution is unsatisfactory. The required level of overall probability\nwould then turn on how many elements the civil claim or criminal\ncharge happens to have. The greater the number of elements, the higher\nthe level of probability to which, on average, each of them must be\nproved. This is thought to be arbitrary and hence objectionable. As\ntwo commentators noted, the legal definition of theft contains more\nelements than that for murder. Criminal law is not the same in all\ncountries. We may take the following as a convenient approximation of\nwhat the law is in some countries: murder is (1) an act that caused\nthe death of a person (2) that was done with the intention of causing\nthe death, and to constitute theft, there must be (1) an intention to\ntake property, (2) dishonesty in taking the property, (3) removal of\nthe property from the possession of another person and (4) lack of\nconsent by that person.  Since the offence of theft contains twice the\nnumber of elements as compared to murder, the individual elements for\ntheft would have to be proved to a much higher level of probability\n(in order for the probability of their conjunction to cross the\noverall threshold) than the individual elements for the much more\nserious crime of murder (Allen and Leiter 2001: 1504–5). This is\nintuitively unacceptable. Another proposal for resolving the conjunction paradox is move away\nfrom thinking of the standard of proof as a quantified threshold of\nabsolute probability and to construe it, instead, as a probability\nratio. The fact-finder has to compare the probability of the evidence\nadduced at the trial under the plaintiff’s theory of the case\nwith the probability of the evidence under the defendant’s\ntheory of the case (the two need not add to 1), and award the verdict\nto the side with a higher probability (Cheng 2013). One criticism of\nthis interpretation of the standard of proof is that it ignores, and\ndoes not provide a basis for ignoring, the margin by which one\nprobability exceeds the other, and the difference in probability may\nvary significantly for different elements of the case (Allen and Stein\n2013: 598). There is a deeper problem with the probabilistic conception of the\nstandard of proof. There does not seem to be a satisfactory\ninterpretation of probability that suits the forensic context. The\nonly plausible candidate is the subjective meaning of probability\naccording to which probability is construed as the strength of\nbelief. The evidence is sufficient to satisfy the legal standard of\nproof on a disputed question of fact—for example, it is\nsufficient to justify the positive finding of fact that the accused\nkilled the victim—only if the fact-finder, having considered\nthe evidence, forms a sufficiently strong belief that the accused\nkilled the victim.  Guidance on how to process evidence and form\nbeliefs can be found in a mathematical theorem known as Bayes’\ntheorem; it is the method by which an ideal rational fact-finder\nwould revise or update his beliefs in the light of new\nevidence.[16]\nTo return to our earlier hypothetical scenario, suppose the\nfact-finder initially believes the odds of the accused being guilty\nis 1:1 (“prior odds”) or, putting this differently, that\nthere is a 0.5 probability of guilt. The fact-finder then receives\nevidence that blood of type A was found at the scene of the crime and\nthat the accused has type A blood. Fifty percent of the population\nhas this blood type. On the Bayesian approach, the posterior odds are\ncalculated by multiplying the prior odds (1:1) by the likelihood\nratio (which, as we saw in section 2.1.2\nabove, is 2:1). The fact-finder’s belief in the odds of guilt\nshould now be revised to 2:1; the probability of guilt is now\nincreased to 0.67 (Lempert 1977). The subjectivist Bayesian theory of legal fact-finding has come\nunder attack (see generally Amaya 2015: 82–93; Pardo 2013:\n591). First, as we already saw in section\n3.1, ascertainment of the likelihood ratios is highly\nproblematic. Secondly, the Bayesian theory is not sensitive to the\nweight of evidence which, roughly put, is the amount of evidence that\nis available. This criticism and the concept of weight are further\nexplored in section 3.3. Thirdly, while the Bayesian theorem offers a method for updating\nprobabilities in the light of new evidence, it is silent on what the\ninitial probability should be. In a trial setting, the initial\nprobability cannot be set at zero since this means certainty in the\ninnocence of the accused. No new evidence can then make any\ndifference; whatever the likelihood ratio of the evidence, multiplying\nit by zero (the prior probability) will still end up with a posterior\nprobability of zero. On the other hand, starting with an initial\nprobability is also problematic. This is especially so in a criminal\ncase. To start a trial with some probability of guilt is to have the\nfact-finder harbouring some initial belief that the accused is guilty\nand this is not easy to reconcile with the presumption of\ninnocence. (Tribe 1971: 1368–1372; cf. Posner 1999: 1514,\nsuggesting starting the trial with prior odds of 50:50, criticized by\nFriedman 2000.) Fourthly, we have thus far relied for ease of illustration on\nhighly simplified—and therefore unrealistic—examples. In\nreal cases, there are normally multiple and dependent items of\nevidence and the probabilities of all possible conjunctions of these\nitems, which are numerous, will have to be computed. These\ncomputations are far too complex to be undertaken by human beings\n(Callen 1982: 10–15). The impossibility of complying with the\nBayesian model undermines its prescriptive value. Fifthly, according to Haack, the Bayesian theory has it the wrong\nway round. What matters is not the strength of the\nfact-finder’s belief itself. The standard of proof should be\nunderstood instead in terms of what it is reasonable for the\nfact-finder to believe in the light of the evidence presented, and\nthis is a matter of the degree to which the belief is warranted by\nthe evidence. Evidence is legally sufficient where it warrants the\ncontested factual claim to the degree required by law. Whether a\nfactual claim is warranted by the evidence turns on how strongly the\nevidence supports the claim, on how independently secure the evidence\nis, and on how much of the relevant evidence is available to the\nfact-finder (that is, the comprehensiveness of the evidence—see\nfurther discussion in section 3.3\nbelow). Haack is against identifying degrees of warrant with\nmathematical probabilities. Degrees of warrant do not conform to the\naxioms of the standard probability calculus. For instance, where the\nevidence is weak, neither p nor not-p may be warranted;\nin contrast, the probability of p and the probability of\nnot-p must add up to 1. Further, where the probability\nof p and the probability of q are both less than 1, the\nprobability of p and q, being the product of the\nprobability of p and the probability of q, is less than\nthe probability of either. On the other hand, the degree of warrant\nfor the conjunction of p and q may be higher than the\nwarrant for \neither.[17] \n(See Haack 2004, 2008a,b, 2012, 2014 for\nthe legal application of her general theory of epistemology. For her\ngeneral theory of epistemology, see Haack 1993: ch. 4; Haack 2009:\nch. 4; Haack 2003: ch. 3.) Sixthly, research in experimental psychology suggests that\nfact-finders do not evaluate pieces of evidence one-by-one and in the\nunidirectional manner required under the mathematical model (Amaya\n2015: 114–5). A holistic approach is taken instead where the\ndiscrete items of evidence are integrated into large cognitive\nstructures (variously labelled as “mental models”,\n“stories”, “narratives” and “theories of\nthe case”), and they are assessed globally against the legal\ndefinition of the crime or civil claim that is in dispute (Pennington\nand Hastie 1991, 1993; Pardo 2000). The reasoning does not progress\nlinearly from evidence to a conclusion; it is bi-directional, going\nforward and backward: as the fact-finder’s consideration of the\nevidence inclines him towards a particular verdict, his leaning\ntowards that conclusion will often produce a revision of his original\nperception and his assessment of the evidence (Simon 2004, 2011). The holistic nature of evidential reasoning as revealed by these\nstudies has inspired alternative theories that are of a\nnon-mathematical nature. One alternative, already mentioned, is the\n“explanatory” or “relative plausibility”\ntheory advanced by Allen together with Pardo and other collaborators\n(Allen 1986, 1991, 1994; Pardo 2000; Allen and Leiter 2001; Allen and\nJehl 2003; Pardo and Allen 2008; cf. Nance 2001, Friedman\n2001).[18]\nThey contend that fact-finders do not reason in the fashion portrayed\nby the Bayesian model. Instead, they engage in generating\nexplanations or hypotheses on the available evidence by a process of\nabductive reasoning or drawing “inferences to the best\nexplanation”, and these competing explanations or hypotheses\nare compared in the light of the\nevidence.[19]\nThe comparison is not of a hypothesis with the negation of that\nhypothesis, where the probability of a hypothesis is compared with\nthe probability of its negation. Instead, the comparison is of one\nhypothesis with one or more particular alternative hypotheses as\nadvocated by a party or as constructed by the fact-finder himself. On\nthis approach, the plausibility of X, the factual account of the case\nthat establishes the accused’s guilt or defendant’s\nliability, is compared with the plausibility of a hypothesis Y, a\nspecific alternative account that points to the accused’s\ninnocence or the defendant’s non-liability, and there may be\nmore than one such specific alternative account. On this theory, the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the\npreponderance of proof standard when the best-available hypothesis\nthat explains the evidence and the underlying events include all of\nthe elements of the claim. Thus, in a negligence case, the\nbest-available hypothesis would have to include a breach of duty of\ncare by the plaintiff and causation of harm to the defendant as these\nare the elements that must be proved to succeed in the legal\nclaim. For the intermediate “clear-and-convincing”\nstandard of proof, the best-available explanation must be\nsubstantially better than the alternatives. To establish the standard\nof proof beyond reasonable doubt, there must be a plausible\nexplanation of the evidence that includes all of the elements of the\ncrime and, in addition, there must be no plausible explanation that is\nconsistent with innocence (Pardo and Allen 2008: 238–240; Pardo\n2013: 603–604). The relative plausibility theory itself is perceived to have a\nnumber of shortcomings. First, the theory portrays the assessment of\nplausibility as an exercise of judgment that involves employment of\nvarious criteria such as coherence, consistency, simplicity,\nconsilience and more. However, the theory is sketchy on the meaning\nof plausibility and the criteria for evaluating plausibility are left\nlargely unanalyzed.[20] A second criticism of the relative plausibility theory is that,\ndespite the purported utilisation of “inference to the best\nexplanation” reasoning, the verdict is not controlled by the\nbest explanation. For instance, even if the prosecution’s\nhypothesis is better than the defence’s hypothesis, neither may\nbe very good. In these circumstances, the court must reject the\nprosecution’s hypothesis even though it is the best of\nalternatives (Laudan 2007). One suggested mitigation of this criticism\nis to place some demand on the epistemic effort that the trier of fact\nmust take (for example, by being sufficiently diligent and thorough)\nin constructing the set of hypotheses from which the best is to be\nchosen (Amaya 2009: 155). The third criticism is targeted at holistic theories of evidential\nreasoning in general and not specifically at the relative plausibility\ntheory. While it may be descriptively true that fact-finders decide\nverdicts by holistic evaluation of the plausibility of competing\nexplanations, hypotheses, narratives or factual theories that are\ngenerated from the evidence, such forms of reasoning may conceal bias\nand prejudice that stand greater chances of exposure under a\nsystematic approach such as Bayesian analysis (Twining 2006: 319;\nSimon 2004, 2011; Griffin 2013). A hypothesis constructed by the\nfact-finder may be shaped subconsciously by a prejudicial\ngeneralisation or background belief about the accused based on a\ncertain feature, say, his race or sexual history. Individuating this\nfeature and subjecting it to Bayesian scrutiny has the desirable\neffect of putting the generalisation or background belief under the\nspotlight and forcing the fact-finder to confront the problem of\nprejudice. A third idea of evidential weight is prompted by this insight from\nKeynes (1921: 71):  As the relevant evidence at our disposal increases,\nthe magnitude of the probability of the argument may either decrease\nor increase, according as the new knowledge strengthens the\nunfavourable or the favourable evidence; but something seems\nto have increased in either case,—we have a more substantial\nbasis upon which to rest our conclusion. I express this by saying that\nan accession of new evidence increases the weight of an\nargument. New evidence will sometimes decrease the probability of an\nargument, but it will always increase its\n“weight”. At its simplest, we may think of weight in the context of legal\nfact-finding as the amount of evidence before the court. Weight is\ndistinguishable from probability. The weight of evidence may be high\nand the mathematical probability low, as in the situation where the\nprosecution adduces a great deal of evidence tending to incriminate\nthe accused but the defence has an unshakeable alibi (Cohen 1986:\n641).  Conversely, the state of evidence adduced in a case might\nestablish a sufficient degree of probability—high enough to\ncross the supposed threshold of proof on the mathematical conception\nof the standard of proof—and yet lack adequate weight. In the\nmuch-discussed gate-crasher’s paradox, the only available\nevidence shows that the defendant was one of a thousand spectators at\na rodeo show and that only four hundred and ninety nine tickets were\nissued. The defendant is sued by the show organiser for gate-crashing.\nThe mathematical probability that the defendant was a gate-crasher is\n0.501 and this meets the probabilistic threshold for civil liability.\nBut, according to the negation principle of mathematical probability,\nthere is probability of 0.499 that the defendant did pay for his\nentrance. In these circumstances, it is intuitively unjust to find him\nliable (Cohen 1977: 75). A possible explanation for not finding him\nliable is that the evidence is too flimsy or of insufficient\nweight. Proponents of the mathematical conception of the standard of proof\nhave stood their ground even while acknowledging that weight has a\nrole to play in the Bayesian analysis of probative value and the\nsufficiency of evidence. If a party does not produce relevant evidence\nthat is in his possession, resulting in the court facing an evidential\ndeficiency, it may draw an adverse inference against him when\ncomputing the posterior probability (Kaye 1986b: 667; Friedman\n1997). One criticism of this approach is that, in the absence of\ninformation about the missing evidence, the drawing of the adverse\ninference is open to the objection of arbitrariness (Nance 2008:\n274). A further objection is that the management of parties’\nconduct relating to evidence preservation and presentation should be\nleft to judges and not to the jury. What a judge may do to optimize\nevidential weight is to impose a burden of producing evidence on a\nparty and to make the party suffer an adverse finding of fact if he\nfails to produce the evidence. This will serve as an incentive for the\nparty to act in a manner that promotes the interest in evidential\ncompleteness (Nance 2008, 2010). Cohen suggests that the standard of proof should be conceived\nentirely as a matter of evidential weight which, on his theory, is a\nmatter of the number of tests or challenges to which a factual\nhypothesis is subjected to in court. He offers an account of legal\nfact-finding in terms of an account of inductive probability that was\ninspired by the work of writers such as Francis Bacon and J.S. Mill.\nInductive probability operates differently from the classical calculus\nof probability. It is based on inductive support for the common-sense\ngeneralisation that licences the drawing of the relevant inference.\nInductive support for a generalisation is graded according to the\nnumber of tests that it has passed, or, putting this in another way,\nby the degree of its resistance to falsification by relevant\nvariables.  The inductive probability of an argument is equal to the\nreliability grade of the inductive support for the generalisation\nwhich covers the argument. Proof beyond reasonable doubt represents the maximum level of\ninductive probability. The prosecution may try to persuade the court\nto infer that the accused was guilty of burglary by producing\nevidence to establish that he was found in the vicinity of the\nvictim’s house late at night with the stolen object on\nhim. This inference is licensed by the generalisation that normally\nif a stranger is found immediately after a burglary in possession of\nthe stolen object, he intentionally removed it himself. The defence\nmay try to defeat the inference by showing that the generalization\ndoes not apply in the particular case, for example, by presenting\nevidence to show that the accused had found the object on the\nstreet. The prosecution’s hypothesis is now challenged or put\nto the test. As a counter-move, it may produce evidence to establish\nthat the object could not have been lying in the street as\nalleged. If the generalisations on which the prosecution’s case\nrest survive challenges by the defence at every possible point, then\nguilt is proved beyond reasonable\ndoubt.[21]\nThe same reasoning structure applies in the civil context except that\nin a civil case, the plaintiff succeeds in proof on the preponderance\nof evidence so long as the conclusion to be proved by him is more\ninductively probable than its negation. (Cohen 1977, 1986; cf. Schum\n1979.)[22] Cohen’s theory seems to require that each test to which a\nhypothesis is put can be unequivocally and objectively resolved. But\nusually this is not the case. In our example, we may not be entirely\nconvinced that the accused found or did not find the object on the\nstreet, and our evaluation would involve the exercise of judgment that\nis no less subjective as the sort of judgments required when applying\nthe standard probabilistic conception of proof (Nance 2008:\n275–6; Schum 1994: 261).","contact.mail":"lawhohl@nus.edu.sg","contact.domain":"nus.edu.sg"}]
