Warren","author1.info":"http://www.macalester.edu/academics/philosophy/facultystaff/karenwarren/","entry":"feminism-environmental","body.text":"\n\n Early positions of “feminist environmental philosophy”\nfocused mostly on ethical perspectives on the interconnections among\nwomen, nonhuman animals, and nature (e.g., Carol Adams 1990; Deborah\nSlicer 1991). As it matured, references to feminist environmental\nphilosophy became what it is now—an umbrella term for a variety\nof different, sometimes incompatible, philosophical perspectives on\ninterconnections among women of diverse races/ethnicities,\nsocioeconomic statuses, and geographic locations, on the one hand, and\nnonhuman animals and nature, on the other. For the purposes of this\nessay, “feminist environmental philosophy” refers to this\ndiversity of positions on the interconnections among women, nonhuman\nanimals and nature within Western philosophy—what will be\ncalled, simply, “women-nature connections”. Unless\nspecifically or separately identified, nonhuman animals are included\nin the concept of “nature”. (It is beyond the scope of\nthis essay to consider non-Western philosophical positions concerning\nthe environment.)\n\n\nA feminist issue provides ways of understanding, eliminating, and\ncreating alternatives to the oppression of women. Minimally, nature\n(used interchangeably in this essay with “the\nenvironment”) is a feminist issue because an understanding of\nnature and environmental problems often helps one understand how and\nwhy women's oppression is linked with the unjustified domination or\nexploitation of nature. (The distinction between\n“oppression” and “domination” is discussed\nin Section 3.2.) For example, data show that\nwomen—especially poor, rural women in less developed countries\n(LDCs) who are heads of households—suffer disproportionate harms\ncaused by such environmental problems as deforestation, water\npollution, and environmental toxins. Knowing this helps one understand\nhow the lives and status of women are connected to contemporary\nenvironmental problems. (Greta Gaard and Lori Gruen 2005).  Such data\nmake deforestation, water pollution, and environmental toxins a\nfeminist issue. In fact, some have claimed that “nature is a\nfeminist issue” might be the informal slogan of feminist\nenvironmental philosophy (Warren 2000). \nAs used throughout the essay, “canonical Western\nphilosophy” refers to the Western philosophical tradition\ntraceable to Ancient Greece. It includes the works by the philosophers\nwho are most commonly taught at the majority of colleges and\nuniversities throughout the English speaking Western world. In this\ntradition, there is a striking degree of agreement about the\n“conceptual framework”—the basic beliefs, values,\nattitudes, assumptions, and concepts—that define “the\ncanon”. These include the following: (a) a commitment\nto rationalism, the view that reason (or rationality) is not\nonly the hallmark of being human; it is what makes humans superior to\nnonhuman animals and nature; (b) a conception of humans as\nrational beings who are capable of abstract reasoning, entertaining\nobjective principles, and understanding or calculating the\nconsequences of actions; (c) conceptions of both the ideal moral agent\nand the knower as impartial, detached\nand disinterested; (d) a belief in\nfundamental dualisms, such as reason versus emotion, mind\nversus body, culture versus nature, absolutism versus relativism, and\nobjectivity versus subjectivity; (e) an assumption that there is\nan ontological divide between humans and nonhuman animals and\nnature; and (f) universalizability as a criterion for\nassessing the truth of ethical and epistemological principles (see\nWarren 2009). Many of these key features of canonical Western philosophy are\nchallenged by positions in feminist environmental philosophy. When,\nwhere and how this occurs is addressed throughout the essay. \nThere are three distinct kinds of positions \nwithin feminist environmental\nphilosophy. They are: (1) positions whose historical beginnings\nare located in non-feminist Western environmental philosophies; (2)\npositions that were initially identified with\n“ecofeminism” (or “ecological feminism”)\ngenerally, but, since the late 1980s and early 1990s, are more\naccurately identified with\n“ecofeminist philosophy,” specifically; and (3)\nnew or emerging “stand alone”\npositions that offer novel or unique perspectives on\n“women-nature connections” that are not identified with\neither (1) or (2). Discussion of these three sorts of positions\nconstitutes the subject matter of Section 2. Although environmental issues have been addressed by philosophers\nsince Ancient Greece, Western environmental philosophies did not take\nshape until the early 1970s (e.g., Arne Naess 1973; John Passmore\n1973).  Increasingly, unsettling empirical data surfaced concerning\nhuman mistreatment of nonhuman animals (e.g., factory farming), nature\n(e.g., clear-cutting old growth forests), and destructive human-nature\nrelationships (e.g., human creation of unmanaged toxic landfills,\nespecially in communities of color). In addition, many canonical\nassumptions were called into question, such as the view that humans\nand culture are superior to nonhuman animals and nature. Western\nenvironmental philosophies, both feminist and non-feminist, emerged\nfrom such applied and theoretical concerns. The historical beginnings of Western environmental philosophy are\nin environmental ethics. Unlike canonical Western ethics, Western\nenvironmental ethics (both feminist and non-feminist) is\npredicated on the claim that humans have moral responsibilities (or\nobligations) to nonhuman animals and/or nature, although they disagree\nabout the basis of these responsibilities. Some argue that the basis\nis the intrinsic (or inherent) value of nonhuman animals and/or\nnature, in contrast with the canonical view that they have merely\ninstrumental (or extrinsic) value. Some argue that there are\nproperties that nonhuman animals and/or nature have (such as,\nsentiency, rights, or interests) by virtue of which they deserve moral\nconsideration in their own right (or, have moral standing). Despite\ndisagreements about the basis of these human responsibilities, Western\nenvironmental philosophy asserts what canonical philosophy\ndenies— that humans have moral responsibilities to nonhuman\nanimals and/or nature themselves, and not just to humans where\nnonhuman animals and/or nature are concerned. As a kind of Western\nenvironmental philosophy, feminist environmental philosophy supports\nthe claim that canonical Western philosophy does not generate\na bona fide environmental philosophy, since it fails to\nrecognize that humans have moral obligations (or responsibilities) to\nnonhuman animals and/or nature themselves. (Throughout the remainder\nof the essay, any reference to philosophy, environmental philosophy or\nfeminist environmental philosophy is to Western philosophy.) A “revised” environmental philosophy is one that uses\nkey concepts and theories of canonical philosophy,\nbut extends them to include nonhuman animals in the moral\ncommunity. It does so by granting moral status (or, moral standing) to\nnonhuman animals.  “Animal Ethics” is one such revised\nposition (see the entry on the\n moral status of animals). Feminist animal ethicists oppose the same practices (e.g., factory\nfarming, vivisection, and hunting) that are opposed by the two\noriginal non-feminist versions of animal ethics, Peter Singer's\nutilitarian version (1975) and Tom Regan's right-based version\n(1982). Singer opposes these practices because they cause unnecessary\npain and suffering to sentient beings. Regan opposes them because they\nviolate the rights to life of what he calls “subjects of a\nlife”. But feminist animal ethics goes further by providing a\ngendered perspective on such practices and on animal protection\ngenerally (see feminist animal ethics of care discussed in Section 3.8). \n\nHow does it do this? There are six ways feminist animal ethics has\nmade distinct contributions to traditional, non-feminist positions in\nanimal ethics: (1) it emphasizes that canonical Western philosophy's\nview of humans as rational agents, who are separate from and superior\nto nature, fails to acknowledge that humans are also animals—even\nif rational animals—and, as such, are a part of nature; (2) it\nmakes visible the interconnections among violence against women,\nviolence against nature, and pornography (see Adams 1990, 2004; Carol\nAdams and Josephine Donovan 1995; Susan Griffin 1981; Pattrice Jones\n2011); (3) it demonstrates the role played by language in creating,\nmaintaining, and perpetuating the interconnected exploitations of\nwomen and animals (See Section 3.3); (4) it shows how bedrock dualisms\nin canonical philosophy—such as culture versus nature and mind\nversus body—have historically not been gender-neutral; they have\nassociated males/men with superior culture and mind, and both\nfemales/women and animals with inferior nature and body (Gruen and\nKari Weil 2011); (5) it locates the exploitation of women and animals\nin mutually reinforcing systems and practices of unjustified\ndomination, particularly sexism and speciesism (or, the prejudicial\ndiscrimination against other beings based on their membership in\n(allegedly) inferior nonhuman species) (Gaard 2011); and (6) it raises the\nissue whether the absence of a gendered perspective in traditional\nanimal ethics makes those positions on the mistreatment of nonhuman\nanimals incomplete or inadequate (see Adams 1994; Adams and Donovan\n1995; Gaard 1993; Gruen 1996; Slicer 1991). An “expanded” environmental philosophy is one that does\ntwo things: it retains some of the key features of revised\nenvironmental philosophy (e.g., consequentialist and rights-based\ntheories) while also introducing genuinely new features—ones\nthat had not yet been part of a moral theory. This essay considers\nonly one “expanded” environmental philosophy, Aldo\nLeopold's “land ethic”, published as an essay, “The\nLand Ethic”, in his 1949 book The Sand County\nAlmanac. Many environmental philosophers consider Leopold's land\nethic the first genuinely environmental ethic (not just an\n“animal ethic”).  It is discussed here because many\nfeminist environmental philosophers defend positions that draw on\nLeopold's land ethic (e.g., Chris Cuomo 1998; Deane Curtin 1999;\nWarren 2000). Leopold's land ethic advances four key claims (stated here roughly\nas Leopold stated them): (1) the moral community should include soils,\nwaters, plants, and animals, or, what Leopold calls, collectively,\n“the land” (Leopold 1949 [1977]: 204); (2) the role\nof homo sapiens should be changed from conqueror to plain\nmember of the land community (204); (3) we can be moral only in\nrelation to something we can see, feel, understand, love, respect,\nadmire, or otherwise have faith in (214, 223, 225); and (4) “a\nthing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and\nbeauty of the biotic community; it is wrong when it tends\notherwise” (224–225), what some regard as Leopold's\nultimate moral maxim. \nMany environmental philosophers regard claim (4) as the moral maxim of\nLeopold's land ethic; it claims that the rightness or wrongness of\nactions is determined by reference to the consequences of those\nactions—a familiar consequentialist ethical principle. However,\nfor Leopold, the relevant consequences are the “integrity,\nstability, and beauty of the biotic community”. Since these\nconsequences are new to ethics, Leopold's land ethic expands ethics\ninto new territory—territory beyond even revised environmental\nphilosophy. The same is true for the other three claims,\n(1)–(3): they introduce moral concepts that go beyond those made\nby either canonical philosophy or revised environmental ethics (such\nas animal ethics). It is this “going beyond” feature that\nmakes Leopold's land ethic an expanded ethic. \n\nMany feminist environmental philosophers adopt key aspects of\nLeopold's land ethic. For example, many defend a notion of the self as\na relational, ecological being who is a member of the larger biotic\n(living, organic, ecological) community. Many agree that “moral\nemotions”, such as empathy and care, are important to any ethic,\nincluding any environmental ethic (see, for example, Cuomo 2005;\nVrinda Dalmiya 2002; Mathews 1994b; Plumwood 1993; Warren 2000). In\naddition, many feminist environmental philosophers acknowledge that\nembryonic forms of a gendered environmental ethic can be\nfound in the opening lines of “The Land Ethic”, where\nLeopold wrote, “The girls [Odysseus's slave girls] were\nproperty. The disposal of property was then, as now, a matter of\nexpediency, not of right and wrong” (Leopold 1949 [1977]:\n201). Lastly, some feminist environmental philosophers endorse\nLeopold's understanding of the interconnections between cultural\ndiversity and ecological (or “bio”) diversity. Consider\nwhy and how understanding these interconnections is important to\nfeminist environmental philosophy.\n \n\nLeopold claimed that an ecological interpretation of history shows\nthat “the rich diversity of the world's cultures reflects a\ncorresponding diversity in the wilds that gave them birth” (1949\n[1977]: 188). For example, Leopold wrote that cultural diversity is\n“often based in wildlife. Thus the plains [sic] Indian not only\nate buffalo, but buffalo largely determined his architecture, dress,\nlanguage, arts, and religion” (1949 [1977]: 177). Cultural\ndiversity reflects ecological diversity. Assuming that the\npreservation of the rich diversity of the world's\ncultures—cultural diversity—is a good thing, then\nunderstanding the connections between that and the preservation of\necological (or “bio”) diversity is also a good thing. The\nconverse is also true: ecological diversity reflects cultural\ndiversity. For example, many Western development projects in Asia and\nAfrica replace ecologically diverse (multispecies) indigenous\nforests—forests that are managed by women and are integral to\nmaintaining subsistence (not money-based) economies—with\nmonoculture eucalyptus and teak plantations that are managed by men\nand where trees are primarily a cash crop for export. Many feminist\nenvironmental philosophers argue against these development projects;\nthe loss of ecological diversity (provided by indigenous forests)\ndirectly and disproportionately harms women, subsistence economies,\nand the cultural communities to which women belong. These examples\nillustrate ways that Leopold's insightful awareness of the\ninterdependencies between cultural diversity and ecological (bio)\ndiversity informs a feminist environmental perspective on women-nature\nconnections (see also Sections\n 3.5 and 3.6). \nA “radical” environmental philosophy challenges\nfoundational assumptions and claims of canonical philosophy in the\ncontext of environmental issues. These challenges are\n“radical” in the etymological sense that they “go to\nthe roots” of environmental problems—typically, the\nconceptual roots—and in the historical sense that they had never\nbefore been part of a moral theory. (This description permits that\nwhat was “radical” at one time may no longer be radical.)\nOne of the most influential radical positions is “deep\necology”.  \n\nNorwegian philosopher Arne Naess coined the term “deep\necology” to refer to the (deep) conceptual roots of the\nenvironmental crisis (Naess 1973). Naess contrasted deep ecology with\n“shallow ecology”. Both are concerned, for example, with\nresolving such “applied” environmental problems as air and\nwater pollution, use of natural resources, human overconsumption and\noverpopulation. But, according to Naess, only deep ecology provides an\nunderstanding of these issues in terms of false or problematic\nunderlying assumptions, concepts, beliefs and values of canonical\nphilosophy. \n\nHistorically, the emergence of ecofeminist philosophy was intimately\nlinked to deep ecology.  However, during the 1980s and 1990s, that\nlink was contested; the so-called “deep ecology-ecofeminism\ndebate” that emerged took centerstage in discussions of environmental\nphilosophy (see Jim Cheney 1987; Cuomo 1994; Kheel 1990; Plumwood\n1993; Salleh 1984; Warren 1999). The ecofeminism-deep ecology debate focused on two features of\nspecial significance to ecofeminist philosophy. The first is deep\necology's criticism of canonical Western philosophy for its\nanthropocentric (human-centered) thinking about human-nature\nrelationships. The second is the notion of the self that is described\nby deep ecology's basic “principle of\nself-realization”. Both features are critiqued by Val Plumwood,\none of the pioneers of ecofeminist philosophy (Plumwood 1993). Her\ncritique is summarized here since it provides insight into some basic\nclaims of ecofeminist philosophy\n(Section 3).   According to deep ecology, canonical Western philosophy's\nunacceptable anthropocentrism is rooted in several\nproblematic value dualisms, including\nthe “culture versus nature” dualism. Plumwood argues that\ndeep ecology's criticism of anthropocentrism fails to see that\ncanonical philosophy's anthropocentrism has functioned\nhistorically as andropocentrism (male-centered thinking). She\nclaims that its failure to see this leads deep ecologists to make two\nfalse assumptions—that one can disentangle anthropocentrism and\nandropocentrism as distinct and separate ways of thinking, and that\none can critique the “culture versus nature” dualism\nwithout providing a gendered analysis of how this dualism has\nfunctioned historically to “justify” the dominations of\nwomen and nature. (This criticism of the “culture versus\nnature” dualism is discussed\nthroughout Section 3.) The second problematic feature of deep ecology concerns the\nprinciple of self-realization, which claims that the\nhuman self (small ‘s’) is actualized only when it\nbecomes merged with the cosmos, a Self (capital\n‘S’). Plumwood argues that this principle is false because\nit keeps intact “the discontinuity thesis”—the\nthesis that there is a clear ontological divide between humans (or the\nsphere of culture) and nature. Culture and nature are\n“discontinuous” because humans are separate from and different\nin kind from nature. For Plumwood, the discontinuity thesis is false\nand any environmental philosophy that assumes it is conceptually\nflawed. Plumwood argues that since deep ecology assumes, rather than\ndenies (as deep ecologists claim), the discontinuity thesis, deep\necology is a conceptually flawed environmental philosophy. How does deep ecology do this—presuppose a thesis that it\nsets out to deny? Plumwood's answer is that the discontinuity thesis\nis kept intact by deep ecology's commitment to three faulty\nconceptions of the self. She calls them “the Indistinguishable\nSelf”, “the Expanded Self”, and “the\nTranscendent Self” (Plumwood 1993). The “Indistinguishable Self” rejects any and all\nboundaries between humans and nature; humans are just one strand in a\ngreater biotic web. This conception of the self presumes what Plumwood\ncalls an “identity thesis:” the human self is an\necological self. The problem with the identity thesis is that it\nmistakenly solves the discontinuity problem by\nobliterating all divisions between humans and nature. For just\nthis reason, Plumwood rejects the identity thesis and the notion of\nthe Indistinguishable Self. If the principle of self-realization is\nabout the Indistinguishable Self, the principle is false. In contrast,\nPlumwood defends a conception of the self that makes\nhumans both continuous with and distinct from nature, both\nindividual selves (who are different from nature) and ecological\nselves (who are a part of nature). The “Expanded Self” distinguishes between the\nparticular, individual human self and an expanded, greater\n“cosmic” Self. Plumwood claims that whatever is\nmeant by a “cosmic Self” (it isn't clear), the Expanded\nSelf denies the importance of individuals as\nindividuals—as distinct human beings who have their own\nparticular attachments and are in various dependency relationships\n(such as parent and child, care giver and the cared for) that are\nunique to each self. Plumwood argues that, given that most of the\nworld's women lack many of the human rights, civil liberties, and\neducational opportunities that men have (as individual selves), it is\nfar too early to abandon a notion of the human self as an individual\n(a self) in favor of some nebulous, undifferentiated,\nexpanded, “cosmic” Self. If the principle of\nself-realization is about the Expanded Self, the principle is\nfalse. The “Transcendent Self” refers to the individual self\nwho overcomes its particularity to become a more self-aware,\ntransformed self. Plumwood claims that the Transcendent Self\npresupposes a “triumph-over thesis”—the Transcendent\nSelf triumphs over highly particularistic attachments, emotions,\nwants, and desires that individual selves have toward themselves and\neach other. The Transcendent Self falsely rejects a view of selves\nthat Plumwood defends: human selves are emotionally interdependent,\necological, relational beings whose actualization requires a rejection\nof rationalism (the identification of humans with reason or\nrationality) and mind-body dualism. Plumwood's conception of the self\nis not a rejection of particularity and individuality; it is\na recognition that individual selves are also interdependent\nbeings-in-relationships, not Transcendent Selves who triumph over such\ninterdependencies and relationships. If the principle of\nself-realization is about the Transcendent Self, the principle is\nfalse. We already have been introduced to ecofeminist philosophy in connection\nwith animal ethics (Section 2.2),\nLeopold's Land Ethic \n(Section 2.3), and deep ecology\n (Section 2.4). This section explores\n the nature of ecofeminist philosophy\nas a distinct kind of environmental philosophy. French feminist Françoise d'Eaubonne coined the term\n“ecological feminisme” in 1974 to call attention\nto women's potential to bring about an ecological revolution.\nInitially, “ecofeminism” referred generically to a wide\nvariety of “women-nature” connections, often based in\ndifferent disciplinary perspectives (such as History, Literary\nCriticism, Political Science, Sociology, and Theology). This is\nimportant because ecofeminism did not emerge as a\ndistinctly philosophical position until the late 1980s and\nearly- to mid 1990s. For purposes of this essay, a general, common-denominator\ncharacterization of “ecofeminist philosophy” is that it:\n(1) explores the nature of the connections between the unjustified\ndominations of women and nature; (2) critiques male-biased Western\ncanonical philosophical views (assumptions, concepts, claims,\ndistinctions, positions, theories) about women and nature; and (3)\ncreates alternatives and solutions to such male-biased views. A note about terminology is relevant here. Many ecofeminist\nphilosophers distinguish between the oppression of women and\nthe (unjustified) domination of nature. They do so on the\ngrounds that only those beings that have such characteristics as\nrationality, cognitive capacity, or sentiency can be oppressed. In\nWestern contexts, nonhuman natural entities such as rocks, plants,\nrivers, or (generically) nature are presumed to not have any such\ncharacteristics. As such, unlike women, they cannot be oppressed\n(although they can be unjustly dominated). What about nonhuman\nanimals? Many ecofeminist philosophers include animals, especially\ndomesticated animals, among those beings that are capable of being\noppressed, but deny that nature has this capability. They talk about\nthe oppression of animals (but not of nature). For purposes of this\nessay, the word “oppression” will not be applied to\nnature; its applicability to animals will be left an open question.\nAccordingly, for example, ecofeminist philosophical perspectives on\nwomen-nature connections will not refer to “the oppression of\nnature”, “the twin oppressions of women and nature,“\nor “the mutually reinforcing oppressions of women and\nnature”. However, they will refer to the unjustified dominations\nof women, nonhuman animals, and nature. A conceptual framework is a set of basic beliefs, values,\nattitudes, and assumptions that shape and reflect how one sees oneself\nand one's world (Warren 2000, 2005). Some conceptual frameworks\nare oppressive. An oppressive conceptual framework is one\nthat functions to explain, maintain, and “justify”\ninstitutions, relationships and practices of unjustified domination\nand subordination. When an oppressive conceptual framework\nis patriarchal, it functions to justify the subordination of\nwomen by men. Sexism, racism, classism, heterosexism, and ethnocentrism are\nexamples of what Warren calls unjustified “isms of\ndomination” (1990, 2000). Warren argues that these isms of\ndomination share conceptual roots in five features of an oppressive\nconceptual framework. The first feature is value-hierarchical,\nUp-Down thinking that attributes greater value to that which is\n“Up” than to that which is “Down”. In\ncanonical philosophy, value hierarchical thinking (typically) puts men Up and\nwomen Down, culture Up and nature Down. By attributing greater value\nto that which is higher, the Up-Down organization of reality serves to\nlegitimate inequality “when, in fact, prior to the metaphor of\nUp-Down, one would have said only that there existed diversity”\n(Elizabeth Dodson Gray 1981: 20)\n\n The second feature is oppositional (rather than\ncomplementary) and mutually exclusive (rather than\ninclusive) value dualisms, which place greater value (status,\nprestige) on one disjunct over the other. In canonical Western\nphilosophy, the dualisms of male versus female and culture versus\nnature have historically done this; they have ascribed greater value\nto that which is identified with males or culture than to that which\nis identified with females or nature.  According to these value\ndualisms, it is better to be male or culture-identified than to be\nfemale or nature-identified. The third and fourth features of oppressive conceptual frameworks\nare that they conceive of power and privilege in\nways that systematically advantage the Ups over the Downs (whether or\nnot the Ups choose to exercise that power and privilege). In a\nclassist society, wealthy people have the power and privilege to\nmobilize resources to self-determined ends. Sometimes this power and\nprivilege enables the wealthy to not notice the ways socioeconomic\nstatus is a significant challenge to equality of opportunity. For\nexample, poor people may be viewed as inferior, and thereby\nundeserving of the same opportunities or rights of the wealthy, often\non the grounds that their poverty is “their own\nfault”. The fifth and philosophically most important feature of an\noppressive conceptual framework is the “logic of\ndomination”. This is the moral premise that superiority\njustifies subordination. The logic of domination provides the\n(alleged) moral justification for keeping Downs down. Typically this\njustification takes the form that the Up has some characteristic\n(e.g., reason) that the Down lacks and by virtue of which the\nsubordination of the Down by the Up is justified. Note that it is possible to have the first four features of an\noppressive conceptual framework yet not have a case of\noppression or unjustified domination. For example, responsible parents\nmay exercise legitimate power and privilege over their children (such\nas the power to decide when to put their child to bed or have the\nprivilege to drive), without thereby being involved in any sort of\noppressive parent-child relationship. Parent-child relationships are\nonly oppressive if the logic of domination is in place; it is what\nprovides the (alleged) justification for treating children as inferior\nand justifiably dominated. Warren argues that the five features of an oppressive conceptual\nframework spotlight some of the shared conceptual roots of the\nunjustified dominations of women, nonhuman animals, and nature. Many\necofeminist philosophers explore the ways these shared conceptual\nroots function in real life to keep intact unjustified institutions\nand practices of oppression and domination. \nLudwig Wittgenstein argues that the language one uses mirrors and\nreflects one's view of oneself and the world—one's conceptual\nframework. According to ecofeminist philosophers, language plays a key\nrole in the formation of problematic concepts of women, animals, and\nnature—concepts that reinforce the five features of an\noppressive conceptual framework and contribute to the\n“justification” of the dominations of women, animals, and\nnature. Consider some examples of how language does this. The English language animalizes and naturalizes\nwomen in cultural contexts where women and nonhuman animals are\nalready viewed as inferior to men and male-identified culture. Women\nare referred to pejoratively as dogs, cats, catty, pussycats, pussies,\npets, bunnies, dumb bunnies, cows, sows, foxes, chicks, bitches,\nbeavers, old bats, old hens, old crows, queen bees, cheetahs, vixen,\nserpents, bird-brains, hare-brains, elephants, and whales. Women\ncackle, go to hen parties, henpeck their husbands, become old biddies\n(old hens no longer sexually attractive or able to reproduce), and\nsocial butterflies. Animalizing women in a sexist (or, patriarchal)\nculture that views animals as inferior to “humans”\nreinforces and attempts to legitimate women's alleged inferior\nstatus to men (see Adams 1990; Joan Dunayer 1995; Warren 2000).\nSimilarly, the English language feminizes nature in cultural\ncontexts that view women and nature as inferior to men and\nmale-identified culture. Mother Nature (not Father Nature) is raped,\nmastered, controlled, conquered, mined; her (not his) secrets are\npenetrated, and her womb (men don't have one) is put into the service\nof the man of science (not woman of science, or simply\nscientist). Virgin timber is felled, cut down. Fertile (not potent)\nsoil is tilled, and land that lies fallow is useless or barren, like a\nwoman unable to conceive a child. In these examples, the exploitations of nature and animals are\njustified by feminizing (not masculinizing) them; the\nexploitation of women is justified by animalizing (not\nhumanizing) and naturalizing (not “culturizing”)\nwomen. As Carol Adams argues (1990), language that feminizes nature\nand naturalizes women describes, reflects, and perpetuates unjustified\npatriarchal domination by failing to see the extent to which the\ndominations of women, nonhuman animals, and nature are culturally (not\njust metaphorically) analogous and sanctioned. The point of these examples is not to claim that only females are\ndenigrated by use of animal or nature language. That would be\nfalse. In the English language, animal terms also are used\npejoratively against men. For example, men are called wolves, sharks,\nskunks, snakes, toads, jackasses, old buzzards, and goats. Nor is it\nto claim that all uses of animal or nature language are\nderogatory. That would also be false. In Western culture, it is\ngenerally complimentary to describe someone as busy as a bee,\neagle-eyed, lion-hearted, or brave as a lion. Rather, the point is\nthat, within patriarchal contexts, the majority of animal and\nnature terms used to describe women, and the majority of female terms\nused to describe animals and nature, function differently from the\nanimal and nature terms used to describe men.  Within a\npatriarchal context, they function to devalue women, animals, and\nnature in a way that reinforces the unjustified dominations of all three.\n Historical perspectives on the causes of the unjustified\ndominations of women and nature are conflicting and inconclusive. One\nof the earliest and most widely referenced is ecofeminist historian\nCarolyn Merchant's perspective (Merchant 1980). Merchant argues that\nthe separation of culture from nature (or, the culture/nature dualism)\nis a product of the scientific revolution. She describes two\nconflicting images of nature: an older, Greek image of nature as\norganic, benevolent, nurturing female, and a newer,\n“modern” (1500–1800s) image of nature as inert, dead, and\nmechanistic. Merchant argues that the historical shift from an organic\nto a mechanistic model helped to justify the exploitation of the earth\nby conceiving of it as inert matter. For example, mining was\nprohibited in antiquity because it was thought to be “mining the\nearth's womb”; early Greek metaphors of nature as alive and\n“nurturing female” supported the view that mining was\nwrong. According to Merchant, a conception of nature as inert matter\nremoved moral barriers to mining that were in place when nature was\nconceived as organic, nurturing female. For many ecofeminist philosophers,\nMerchant's historical perspective informs their analyses of the deep\nconceptual roots of the unjustified dominations of women and nature.\n\n According to Marxist-informed “materialist\necofeminism”, socioeconomic conditions are central to the\ninterconnected dominations of women and nature (see Rosemary Hennessy\nand Chrys Ingraham 1997; Maria Mies and Vandana Shiva 1993; Ariel\nSalleh 1997). Mellor argues that while both men and women mediate\nbetween culture and nature, they do not do so equally. She argues\nagainst “capitalist patriarchy” by drawing on the Marxist\nnotions of the means of production, which includes the raw\nmaterials, land and energy resources, and the forces of\nproduction, which includes the factories, machinery, technology, and\naccumulated skills of the workers. Mellor argues that the system of\npredominantly male ownership of the means and forces\nof production results in a male-biased allocation and distribution of\na society's economic resources that systematically disadvantages women\neconomically and exploits nature (Mellor 1997, 2000, 2005). Socioeconomic conditions are also central to Vandana Shiva's\naccount of Western development as “systematic\nunderdevelopment” or “maldevelopment” (1988). Shiva\nargues that this maldevelopment began with European colonization\nthroughout Asia and Africa; it resulted in the creation of cash-based\neconomies that were modeled after Europe.  The colonizers replaced\nnative food crops and forests with such monoculture crops as\nsunflowers, eucalyptus, and teak, which were cash crops created\nprimarily for export. In addition, the colonizers introduced a\ngendered division of labor, where men were employed in cash-based\neconomic relationships with the colonizers and women were responsible\nfor all the household duties associated with (non-money based)\nsubsistence economies. By destroying subsistence economies,\nmaldevelopment projects created material poverty where, before, there had been\nnone. According to Shiva, it thereby contributed to the very real\n“feminization of poverty”, subordination of women, and\ndegradation of nature. Ecofeminist epistemology extends feminist epistemology's concerns\nwith ways that gender influences conceptions of knowledge, the knower,\nand methods of inquiry and justification (see the entry on \n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\n It does so by showing how these concerns involve women-nature\n connections.\n\n Consider an example often discussed by ecofeminist philosophers. In 1974,\ntwenty-seven women of Reni in northern India took simple but effective\naction to stop tree felling of indigenous forests. They threatened to\nhug the trees if the lumberjacks attempted to cut them down. The\nwomen's protest, known as “the Chipko Movement”\n(“chipko” in Hindi means “to embrace” or\n“hug”), saved 12,000 square kilometers of sensitive\nwatershed. The Chipko movement also gave visibility to two main\ncomplaints of local people: commercial felling by contractors damages\na wide variety of species of trees, and it replaces valuable,\nmultispecies indigenous forests with monoculture plantations of teak\nand eucalyptus.  This commercial felling also disproportionately\nharmed women by: increasing the amount of time women spent collecting\nfirewood; reducing women's abilities to maintain household economies\nthat are dependent upon trees for food, fuel, fodder, and products for\nthe home; and, decreasing opportunities for women to make\nincome-generating wood products for sale at local markets (Louise\nFortmann and Diane Rocheleau 1985; Fortmann and John Bruce 1991). The Chipko movement shows that often it is rural women (such as the\nChipko women), not the “outside” Western-trained forester,\nwho are the experts (“the knowers”) on how to use\nindigenous forests for multiple purposes (e.g., for food, fuel, fodder\nfor cattle, dyes, herbs, medicines, building materials, and household\nutensils).  Similarly, in Sierra Leone a study by feminist foresters\nrevealed that, on the average, local men could name only eight\ndifferent uses of local species of trees, while local women could name\nthirty-two uses of the same species of trees. The epistemological\nclaim is that women of Sierra Leone have “indigenous technical\nknowledge” (ITK) about forest uses and production that is\nbased on their daily, lived, gendered experiences in connection\nwith forest use and management (Sally Fairfax and Fortmann 1990:\n267). Their knowledge is borne from their situated, gendered,\nconcrete, daily experiences as women. An ecofeminist epistemology also shows that a gendered\nenvironmental perspective is important to understanding\nepistemological methods of inquiry and forms of justification\nconcerning women and nature. Consider orthodox Western forestry. Too\noften it has assumed that activities that fall outside the realm of\ncommercial fiber production are less important than those that fall\ninside that realm. Yet the latter are precisely the activities that\nrural women in many parts of Africa and India engage in on a daily\nbasis. Failure to understand the importance of these activities often\nmakes women “invisible”. This invisibility helps explains\nwhy many orthodox, Western foresters\n literally do not see trees that are used as hedgerows or living\nfence poles; trees that provide materials for basketry, dyes,\nmedicines, or decorations; trees that provide sites for honey barrels;\ntrees that provide fodder; trees that have religious significance;\ntrees that provide shade; or trees that provide human food.  \nBecause many foresters literally do not see the enormous variety in\nthe use of trees, they frequently do not see the vast number of\nspecies that are useful … that men and women may have very\ndifferent uses for the same tree or may use different trees for\ndifferent purposes. (Fairfax and Fortmann 1990: 268–9) When Western foresters literally do not see these activities, they\nalso do not see different methods women have for using different trees\nfor different purposes. They do not see gendered environmental\nknowledge that is based on what local women do and know best. These examples and data challenge canonical conceptions of\nknowledge as objective and of the knower as impartial, detached, and\ngender-neutral.  They also challenge traditional research\nmethodologies by encouraging researchers to situate themselves and\ntheir research projects within specific historical, cultural, and\neconomic contexts. They also illustrate ways theory and practice are\ninterdependent: theory must “fit the facts” and “the\nfacts” (e.g., the empirical data) must inform the theory. Feminist political philosophy critiques ways in which traditional\nunderstandings of the political world, including the nature of the\npublic sphere, freedom, democracy, political speech, solidarity, and\nparticipation, fail to adequately address feminist concerns (see entry\non \n feminist political philosophy).\n Ecofeminist political philosophy tends to\nexpand these critiques to include ecologically informed visions for\nconceptualizing politics, political analyses, and the nature of\ndemocracy.   During the 1980s, women's activism in a variety of social\nmovements—the environmental, peace, animal liberation, and\nenvironmental justice movements—came together and a new form of\nactivism emerged, ecofeminist political activism. By the\n1990s, this political activism had given rise to a diversity of\necofeminisms: liberal, Marxist, socialist, radical,\ncultural/spiritual, and social ecofeminisms. These different\necofeminisms are mentioned here because each is grounded in a\ndifferent ecofeminist political perspective—liberalism, Marxism,\nsocialism, radical feminism, indigenous and spiritual politics,\nanarchism, and social ecology. And each political perspective provides\na different answer to questions about the nature of ecofeminist\nactivism, green politics, and ecofeminism political philosophy. Ariel Salleh, for example, claims that the basic premise of ecofeminist political\nanalysis is that the ecological crisis\n  is the inevitable effect of a Eurocentric capitalist\npatriarchal culture built on the domination of nature, and domination\nof Woman ‘as nature’. Or, to turn the…equation\naround the other way, it is the inevitable effect of a culture\nconstructed on the domination of women, and the domination of Nature,\n‘as feminine’. (Salleh 1997: 12–13) Catriona Sandilands' ecofeminist political perspective starts with\n  the premise that ecofeminism contains an inherently\ndemocratic vision…[that] needs to be located in the context of\ncontemporary democratic theory. (Sandilands 1999: xvii)\n \nSandilands argues that traditional understandings of democracy, the\npublic sphere, political speech, and coalition-building fail to\nadequately address the need for an ecologically informed democratic\npolitics— an “ecological democracy”. For both Salleh\nand Sandilands, ecofeminist political analysis is not “politics\nas usual”; it is a gendered, ecologically informed perspective\nthat uses its understanding of the unjustified dominations of women,\nanimals and nature to reconceive notions of the public sphere,\ndemocracy, citizenship, and free speech.  Deane Curtin (1999) agrees that the environmental crisis is a\ncrisis of citizenship and of traditional democracy. Unlike the sense\nof “democracy” that refers to culturally specific\ninstitutions created by Western liberalism, a feminist informed\n“ecological democracy” refers to a vision of democracy\nthat recognizes that we all live in both cultural and ecological\ncommunities—in familiar, enduring, socially diverse\nrelationships to people and places, culture and nature. Ecological\ncommunities are democratic when they are committed to reconciling\nculture with nature in ways appropriate to what it is to be an\necological citizen—one who exercises civic virtues that foster\nthe health of all humans and the planet (see also Katherine Pettus\n1997; Sherilyn MacGregor 2004). There is a very different sort of ecofeminist political philosophy\nthat is developing within Continental philosophy and phenomenology. It\nadvances views of nature as a subject with agency, subjectivity,\n“voice”, and the ability to enter into political dialogue\nas co-interlocutor with humans. This approach to ecofeminist political\ntheory deserves to be acknowledged, though it is not discussed further\nhere (see Patricia Glazebrook 2001, 2008; Chaone Mallory 2008;\nSandilands 1999, 2002). “Ecofeminist philosophical ethics” (henceforth,\n“ecofeminist ethics”) is the sub-field of ecofeminist\nphilosophy that has received the most scholarly attention. (It has\nalready been discussed in connection with animal ethics, Leopold's\nland ethics, and deep ecology.) Ecofeminist ethics is a kind of\nfeminist ethics. As such, it involves a twofold commitment to critique\nmale bias in ethics wherever it occurs and to develop ethics that are\nnot male-biased. As a feminist ethic, it also involves articulation of\nvalues (e.g., values of care, empathy, and friendship) often lost or\nunderplayed in mainstream Western ethics. What makes its critiques of\ntraditional ethical theories “ecofeminist” is that they\nfocus on women-nature connections. There is not one definition of ecofeminist ethics. However, there\nare some themes that run through ecofeminist ethics. These themes are\nabout the nature of ecofeminist ethics generally, not about any particular\necofeminist ethic. One theme is that ecofeminist ethics is a critique and elimination\nof time-honored, mutually exclusive value dualisms, especially the\nculture versus nature dualism. As Plumwood argues\n(Section 2.4), a rejection of the\nculture-nature dualism has implications for an ecofeminist conception\nof the self: humans are both individual selves that are distinct from\nnature and ecological selves that are continuous with nature (see also\nMathews 1994b; Cuomo 2005). A related second theme is that ecofeminist ontologies take selves\nto be\n  fundamentally relational, and therefore deeply social,\nhistorical, and ecological, without losing sight of the great ethical\nand political significance of individual experience, intentions and\nvolitions. (Cuomo 2005: 203)\n \nAs Chris Cuomo argues, if one begins with the awareness that\nrelational selves are interdependent selves, then “the stage is\nset to discuss the relationships between selves and others, and\nbetween community and individuality, without replicating inaccurate\nideas about humans ” (2005: 203). Inaccurate views include those\nbased only on positing human identity in terms of individual\ninterests, autonomy, and separation from nature. Caring for oneself,\nfor example, will involve more than protection of individual rights\nand liberties; it will also involve protection of the ecological\nwell-being of others (including nature) with whom we are in\nrelationship. For ecofeminist ethicists, relationships\nthemselves, and not just the moral status of\nthe relators in those relationships, have moral value and are\nsubject to moral critique. This means that how humans are in\nrelationship to others (including nature) matters morally. A third theme is that ecofeminist ethics is (or at least aims to\nbe) both inclusive and contextual: it views ethical discourse and\npractice as emerging from a diversity of “narratives” or\n“voices” (especially women's voices) of beings located in\ndifferent historical and cultural circumstances. This contrasts with a\nview of ethical theory and discourse as imposed on situations as a\nderivation from some predetermined abstract rule or principle. The\ncontextual inclusivity of ecofeminist ethics involves a shift in\nethics from a monist focus on absolute ethical rules, principles,\nrights, and duties to a pluralist focus on a variety of values, rules,\nand principles in ethics, ethical decision-making, and ethical\nconduct. A fourth theme is that ecofeminist ethics makes no attempt to\nprovide an “objective” moral point of view, since it\nassumes that, in contemporary culture, there really is no such point\nof view. As such, it does not claim to be “unbiased” in\nthe sense of gender-neutral. But it does assume that the gender bias\nit has is a better bias than those of other environmental ethics that\ndo not recognize or include in their ethical theories anything about\nthe varieties of women-nature connections that have been described in\nthis essay. These themes provide a general characterization of ecofeminist\nethics. Consider now three kinds of positions in ecofeminist ethics\nthat have not yet been addressed: care-focused ethics, environmental\nvirtue ethics, and environmental justice ethics. Of these, the most\nwidely defended positions in ecofeminist ethics are care-focused ethics\n(see, for example, Adams and Donovan 2008; Gruen\n2011; Kheel 2007; Warren\n2000). Ecofeminist care-focused ethics hails back to the work of Carol\nGilligan (1982); it often\nrevolves around “the justice versus care debate” (see\nthe section on care-focused approaches in the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n That debate was about two\ndifferent perspectives: the “justice perspective” of\ncanonical ethics, which emphasized individual rights and duties and\nappealed to universalizable rules (or principles), ascertainable through\nreason, for a morally assessment of human conduct; and the “care\nperspective”, which emphasizes such values as care and empathy\nthat are neither reducible to individual rights or duties nor\nascertained through appeal to ahistorical rules or principles. As ecofeminist care-focused ethics matured, it included a defense\nof care and empathy as “moral emotions” that are necessary\nto ethics, ethical-decision making, and ethical conduct. It drew on\nthe emerging body of research on “emotional\nintelligence”—a form of intelligence that is different\nfrom but connected to reason or “rational\nintelligence”—by cognitive psychologists, neuroscientists,\nand neurosurgeons (e.g., Daniel Goleman 1995). According to this\nresearch, “The intellect (rational mind) simply cannot work\neffectively without emotional intelligence” (Goleman 1995:\n28). What we do and ought to do in life is determined by both. This\nresearch provides scientific evidence that those who are unable to\nempathize or care (e.g., because of damage to the part of the\nbrain—the amygdala—where care and empathy reside) do not\nsimply engage in bad ethical reasoning; they do not engage in ethical\nreasoning at all. This research on emotional intelligence validated the care-focused\nnature of ecofeminist ethics (see Warren 2000). It affirmed, on\nscientific grounds, that the ability to care and empathize is\nnecessary for ethical reasoning or practice; a failure to care about\nothers (for example, to care about animal suffering or destruction of\nthe planet) is a moral wrong. Humans are beings who can and must learn\nto care about the health or well being of others, including animals\nand nature. A second kind of ecofeminist ethic is a version of environmental\nvirtue ethics. Ecofeminist virtue ethics asks what a morally good or\nvirtuous person would do, and which character traits, attitudes or\ndispositions a virtuous person would exhibit, in order to predispose\nthe nonhuman natural environment to survive and “flourish”\nin a healthy way. Chris Cuomo (1998) defends a virtue-based\n“ethic of flourishing”. She argues that humans ought to\nact in ways that nurture and enhance the health and well being (or\n“flourishing”) of individuals, species, and communities,\nincluding ecological communities. A third kind of ecofeminist ethic is environmental justice-focused\nethics. This kind of ethic appeals to (mainly) distributive models of\nsocial justice to show why, for example, the disproportionate\ndistribution of environmental harms to women and children\n(particularly poor women of color who are single heads of households\nwith children under the age of eighteen) constitutes a social and\nenvironmental injustice. They focus on ways these harms are caused by\nsuch environmental problems as unsanitary water, the location of\nhazard waste sites, and environmental toxins (Gaard and Gruen 2005;\nWarren 2000).\n \nThe scholarship in feminist environmental philosophy is expanding in a\nvariety of novel ways. This expansion reveals a wide diversity in\nrange of topics and theoretical perspectives beyond those discussed\nin this essay. Their mention here is intended mainly to identify and highlight\nsome additional, and in some cases surprising, ways that feminist\nenvironmental philosophy is continuing to expand and unfold. Some theoretical perspectives within feminist environmental\nphilosophy (not mentioned before in this essay) that are emerging are: \nThe diversity of topics or areas of research for which an ecofeminist\n(or, feminist environmental) philosophical perspective is provided\ninclude the following: \nThe evolving scholarship also provides unique feminist environmental\nphilosophical perspectives on many historical figures: \nThis sampling of new or evolving perspectives in feminist environmental\nphilosophy illustrates that feminist environmental philosophy is an\nexpanding field of scholarship—one rich with possibilities of\nnew ways of thinking about women, animals, and nature.","contact.mail":"kjwarren@umn.edu","contact.domain":"umn.edu"}]
