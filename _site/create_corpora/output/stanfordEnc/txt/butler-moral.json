In addition to his importance as a\nmoral philosopher Butler was also an influential Anglican theologian.\nUnsurprisingly his theology and philosophy were connected — his\nmain writings in moral philosophy were published sermons, a work of\nnatural theology, and a brief dissertation attached to that work.\nAlthough most of Butler’s moral arguments make rich use of passages\nfrom scripture and familiar Christian stories and concepts, they make\nlittle reference to — and depend little on the reader having\n— any particular religious commitments. Indeed many of his\narguments do not rest on the reader having any religious commitments\nat all. His Analogy of Religion was aimed to convince deists\nof the truth of core doctrines of natural and revealed theology but\nthe argument only assumes the premises Butler shared with them. This\nhas led to his philosophy being of interest to both secular and\nChristian moralists, and to debate as to how much and what of his\nethics rests on his Christian commitments.\n\n\n\nButler was born in 1692 and attended a dissenting academy where he\nread current philosophy — including up to date logic, and works\nof John Locke and Samuel Clarke. While a student there Butler wrote a\nletter to Clarke pointing out two problems in Clarke’s arguments\nfor God’s unicity and God’s omnipresence in Demonstration\nof the Being and Attributes of God. Butler’s criticisms led to a\nmutually admiring correspondence. Clarke arranged to have the\ncorrespondence published in 1716, although Butler’s letters\nappeared anonymously. Shortly thereafter Butler joined the Church of\nEngland, attended Oxford, and was ordained. This led to his\nappointment as preacher at Rolls Chapel, the chapel associated with\nthe London equity courts, where he served until 1726. During this\nperiod he also earned a law degree. In 1726 he published a selection\nof his sermons as Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel. It\nappeared in a second edition in 1729 with corrections and with the\naddition of an important synoptic “Preface”. In 1736\nButler published his major work of natural theology, the Analogy\nof Religion, the work for which he was best known in his\nlifetime, with two brief but important dissertations: “Of\nPersonal Identity” and “Of the Nature of Virtue”\n(hence “Dissertation on Virtue”). In the same year he was\nappointed Queen Caroline’s cleric, and after her death the\nfollowing year he rose to become Bishop of Bristol (1738) and\neventually Bishop of Durham (1750). A number of his sermons from the\nlatter part of his career were published individually. Some of them\nwere collected as Six Sermons on Public Occasions and published in\n1749. This was followed by the “Durham Charge” (a work\nexhorting the clergy of his diocese) published a year before\nButler’s death in 1752 (For more on Butler’s life see\nCunliffe 2008, from which most of the above information is derived;\nsee also Cunliffe 1992 and Tennant 2011). \n\nButler’s moral philosophy is characterized by a very high degree of\nanalytic rigor and argumentative care. This is all the more surprising\nfor the fact that many of these rigorous arguments are presented in\nsermons (and particularly in footnotes to sermons). The manner in\nwhich Butler argues, and the details of the particular arguments, are\nindeed what many philosophers who have engaged with him have found\nmost inspiring, even when they have rejected his conclusions\nwhole-heartedly. Butler’s first three sermons provide a general\nframework for his moral philosophy via a teleological account of human\nnature. On the basis of this account of human nature Butler argues\nthat self-love and benevolence or virtue -- principles that other\nmoral philosophers have seen as in tension — are not only not in\ntension but mutually supporting when properly understood. The\nremaining sermons consider a number of key features of moral\npsychology — self-deception, benevolence, forgiveness,\ncompassion — and further develop the discussions of self-love\nand virtue initiated in the first three sermons. They make manifest\nthat Butler thought that the details of moral psychology when\ncarefully presented and rigorously sorted ruled out many questionable\ncommitments that looser philosophers took them to warrant. These\nparticular moral psychological inquiries are followed by a discussion\nof love of God. For Butler this was a central and unifying sentiment\nthat showed the continuity between morals and natural religion. Butler\nconcluded the Sermons with a discussion of human ignorance, which in\nconjunction with his discussions of self-deceit underscored one of his\ncentral themes: the limits of human self-knowledge and knowledge of\ndivine design, limits that had to be continuously in mind when making\nmoral arguments.  Butler’s later sermons, the “Dissertation on\nVirtue”, and the sections of the Analogy of Religion\nthat concern moral philosophy, also continue to develop many of these\nthemes. \n\nIn his “Preface” to the 2nd edition of his Sermons Butler\nsketched his vision of “Morals, considered as a Science”,\n(“Preface”, §6) — i.e. speculative moral\nphilosophy in need of defense from speculative objections as opposed\nto practical moral counsel or revealed religion. Morals considered as\na science proceeds either from abstract relations of things or from\nmatters of fact (“Preface”, §12). Clarke and William\nWollaston were influential philosophers who argued primarily from\nabstract relations to moral obligations, duties, virtues, etc. in\ntheir moral systems. Clarke in particular had argued that we have a\npriori access to the eternal “fitnesses” of things through\ncertain, abstract, and necessary quasi-mathematical arguments (Clarke\n1706) that entail necessary moral obligations and duties insofar as\nactions accord with or fail to accord with eternal and immutable\nrealities. In his correspondence with Clarke, the young Butler noted\nhis discovery of a new method for establishing truths in morals\n(Butler/Clarke 1716, §1). Although the correspondence took place\na few years before Butler delivered the Sermons, it seems likely that\nthe method he alluded to in the correspondence was the nascent method\nthat he would deploy in the first three sermons (which Butler stressed\nwere argued strictly from matters of fact (“Preface”\n§13). \n\nButler had little doubt that arguments from abstract relations and\narguments from matters of fact were complementary, but he held that\nthe latter had major advantages over the former as a method in ethics.\nFirst it was in “a peculiar Manner adapted to satisfie a fair\nMind; and is more easily applicable to the several particular\nRelations and Circumstances in Life” (“Preface”,\n§12). In other words, arguments from matters of fact allowed us\nto discern moral standards in human actions and for the standards to\nbe accessible to and motivating for ordinary reflecting agents (to be\ndiscussed in 3.).  Whereas the abstract relations of things might\nestablish for Clarke or Wollaston that “Vice is contrary to the\nNature and Reasons of Things” (“Preface”, §12),\narguments of matter of fact established that vice is “a\nviolation or breaking in upon our own Nature,”\n(“Preface”, §12). These fitnesses or proportions were\nto be discovered in our nature and although they might be consistent\nwith a priori metaphysical relations, the norms and values that they\ndetermined were obliging and motivating in absence of access to said\nrelations. As such they were relativized to human nature,\nauthoritative for it, and accessible via reflection on and observation\nof our actions and those of others \n\nBut one might still worry that moral judgments that rested on probable\nmatters of fact were less secure than those found to be in accordance\nwith eternal fitnesses, even with the aforementioned advantages. Seven\nyears later, Butler offered a methodological argument in the\n“Introduction” to the Analogy that might respond\nto this objection if applied to morals (although Butler framed the\npoint more generally). Although deductive arguments like those\nchampioned by Clarke were secure when considered abstractly, they were\nopen to doubt when applied to matters of fact about actions or\ncharacters. This was because one needed a hypothesis of how to apply\nthe abstract demonstrative truths to observed facts\n(“Introduction” §7) — how to fit the fitnesses\nto actions so to speak — and this hypothesis itself was not\ndeductively secure. Butler offered the analogy of Cartesian\nphysiology. Cartesian physiology applies Cartesian geometry to living\nbodies. But one needs a probable hypothesis to move from the abstract\ntruths of Cartesian geometry to actual bodies and diseases. For\nexample, “this spleen is roughly an oval and the way it\ninteracts with the liver roughly results in this sort of\nmechanism”. The mechanism itself as represented abstractly is a\ncertain geometrical relationship. But in order to apply the mechanism\nto blood and guts, one needs to have a probable, i.e. not certain,\nhypothesis about how the ideal mechanism fits with the facts on the\nground — that this arrangement of blood and guts is best\ncaptured by this mechanism not that one. A similar problem arises when\napplying eternal and abstract relations to particular moral\ncircumstances and actions. The need for a hypothesis as to how the\nrelations might fit actual actions rendered the evaluation of the\naction merely probable even though the rightness and wrongness to\nwhich the action was to conform — the eternal fitness —\nwas known certainly. \n\nSince both Clarke’s method and Butler’s method were\nprobable, Clarke’s probable in application to actions and\nButler’s in relying on matters of fact about human nature in\nestablishing facts about vice and virtue, one might conclude\nskeptically that both failed. But Butler argued that a probable course\nof action could still be morally obligatory. He claimed that probable\nreasoning could result in sufficient certainty for moral action when\nan action could be shown to be more probably good than either inaction\nor an opposed action. Lacking further evidence the more probably good\naction is morally obligatory. This suggested a way in which probable\nevidence, for example probable evidence for the existence of an\nafterlife, could be obliging on us and was crucial to his arguments\nfor the reasonableness of basic Christian teachings in\nthe Analogy. \n\nBecause of the absence of a priori demonstrative premises, a moral\nphilosopher arguing from matters of fact had to have detailed knowledge\nof the principles of action in human nature and of moral psychology as\nwell as arguments to show how these principles had bearing on virtue\nand vice. Human beings, according to Butler, had within their nature\nvarious instincts and principles of action: desires for particular\npleasures, benevolence, self-love, and conscience. The practitioner of\nmoral science aimed to discover what these principles are and the ways\nin which these desires, reasons, and motivations fit together. This is\ndifficult in practice since the actions that we observe in ourselves\nand in others almost always draw on more than one principle. For\nexample both self-love and the particular passions often go into the\nmotivation or justification for particular actions. Consequently the\nmoral scientist could be said to bring a version of Locke’s negative\nprogram of underbrush clearing in the theory of knowledge to moral\nphilosophy, by analyzing and disambiguating principles, motivations,\nand passions which give rise to actions which we judge to be virtuous\nand vicious. At the same time Butler’s way of thinking about\nmorality as dictated by nature had strong resonances with the Stoics\nand other ancient moralists. \n\nIn order to show how these principles, motivations, and passions bear\non virtue and vice Butler distinguished between three senses of\n“nature” (Sermon 2). Nature (N1) can refer to any\nprinciple or element that belongs to or motivates human beings. It can\nalso refer (N2) to the strongest among a group of principles, i.e., it\nis in our nature to get angry, not to giggle, when unjustly\naccused. Finally it can refer (N3) to natural supremacy, i.e., that a\nprinciple acts as a law, guide, or authority to other principles or\npassions. Butler suggests that whatever is naturally supreme unites\nvarious principles in a teleological system. Consequently Butler can\nbe seen to be arguing that when we take a survey of all that belongs\nto human nature (N1) we discover that conscience has natural supremacy\n(N3) in a united hierarchy (although see Section Five for\nButler’s claim that self-love is also a supreme principle). N1\nprinciples can be identified piecemeal, particular passions that\nbelong to the human frame. N2 principles are relational, i.e. the\nstrongest of a group of principles.  N3 principles are relational as\nwell but they are also rational and they unify other sorts of\nprinciples. By educing a hierarchy in the principles of human nature,\nand by showing that the hierarchy is independent of the strength (N2)\nof the principles as motivations for action, we can demonstrate that\nwhat we ought to do morally (N3) may differ from what we are most\nstrongly motivated to do (N2) without reflection. \n\nButler’s best-known arguments for the natural hierarchy of\nprinciples draw on a number of analogies: to a watch\n(“Preface”), to a civil constitution (Sermon III), to a\ntree, and to a machine (Sermon 3 Note 1). Just as a clock is not an\nindividual gear, or a pile of gears, but is what it is due to the ways\nin which the gears move together towards an end, so too human nature is\nnot a particular principle of action, or a bundle of principles, but\nthe interaction of principles, desires, and reasons, as a system\ntowards ends. That our nature is structured towards ends, which Butler\ntakes to be empirically evident, gives evidence of a hierarchy of\nprinciples to attain the ends, a hierarchy where some principles must\nbe naturally subordinate to others (N3). This shows that there is\nsomething natural to us in the sense of N3, in addition to N1 and N2\n(both of which are a matter of observed fact). “A civil\nconstitution implies in it united strength, various subordinates under\none direction … a superior faculty whose office it is to adjust,\nmanage, and preside over them,” (Sermon III §2). The governing\nfaculty has authority. When a civil constitution is violated or\noverthrown by “meer power” this goes against the nature of the\nconstitution. When a machine’s or a tree’s parts no longer\nbear proportionate relations among themselves and are no longer guided\nby superior principles, it is broken or sick. By analogy, when forceful\nprinciples and passions (N2) go against authoritative principles (N3),\nor when the principles and passions no longer bear the same relations\nor are in conflict this goes against our nature and is unnatural. The\nanalogy suggests that it is unnatural when a N2 principle overpowers a\nN3 principle. The subordination of N2 principles to N3 principles is\nnatural and preserves and guides our natures. N3 principles are what we\nought to act on or act in accordance with. Deciding whether Butler\nholds that we ought to act on them just because they are in accordance\nwith our nature or we ought to act on them because they are morally\nright and in accordance with our nature has led to some of the most\nsalient objections to Butler’s moral philosophy (see Section\n4). \n\nThe supremacy of conscience in human nature can also be shown by a\ncomparison of the constitutions and natures of animals with human\nnature. Animals are driven by principles similar to (or identical to)\nthose that give rise to human actions: they share many of our\npassions and they too are driven by self-interest. When animals act\naccording to these principles they act appropriately to their natures\n(in senses N1 and N2). But humans have a principle, conscience, which\nanimals lack. This suggests that humans do not act suitably to\nwhat is distinctive to their whole nature, and in particular suitable\nto that end which draws on many of the principles of human nature when\nthey act only from those principles that they share with animals and\nnot according to conscience. \n\nInterpreters of Butler have disagreed about the degree to which they\nhold that Butler’s teleological and hierarchical account of human\nnature relies on theological premises, and on what sort of teleology is\nat play. Some interpreters hold that Butler’s arguments that there are\nN3 principles only go through if we assume that God created human\nbeings for a purpose and in accordance with providence (Darwall 1995;\nPenelhum 1985). On this account what human beings ought to be or\nought to do follows from what they were designed for. Humans were\ndesigned for virtue and so they ought to be virtuous. Others suggest\nthat the argument has support without recourse to theological\narguments, and that the teleological facts about human nature imply\nnorms and values that are obliging without reference to design\n(Wedgwood 2007; Irwin 2008). \n\nLike Shaftesbury, Butler held that conscience is a reflective\nprinciple. Shaftesbury asserted that “every reasoning or\nreflecting Creature is, by his Nature, forc’d to endure\nthe Review of his own Mind, and Actions; and to have\nRepresentations of himself, and his inward Affairs, constantly passing\nbefore him, obvious to him, and revolving in his Mind,” (Shaftesbury\n1699 II.1 [119] For Butler conscience is more specifically a reflection\non prospective or retrospective actions of oneself and others according\nto moral principles. When we judge characters we reflect on actions in\nrelation to the capacities of agents (“Dissertation on\nVirtue” §5). Butler presumes that all ordinary human beings\nhave a sense of right and wrong in presuming that the moral principles\nare accessible for reflection, and that the many ways of describing\nthis sense of right and wrong all point to one and the same capacity:\n“Conscience, moral Reason, moral sense, or divine Reason…\nas a Sentiment of the Understanding, or as a Perception of the\nHeart” (“Dissertation on Virtue” §1). There are\na number of elements in the natural supremacy of conscience that help\nus to understand the nature of its authority. \n\nFirst, according to Butler conscience has a unique authority among\nthe principles belonging to human nature. As evidenced in the civil\nconstitution analogy, we recognize that it should direct other\nprinciples and not vice-versa and that the authority is proper to\nconscience and no other principle. Further we recognize that any\nordinary reasonable person has a conscience and ought to obey it.\nThe term “conscience” was commonly employed in both\ntheological and philosophical contexts (Shaftesbury identified it with\nreflective reason) but was also a legal term of art among the equity\nlawyers to whom Butler preached his sermons. In the legal context it\nhad the sense of acting minimally as an ordinary reasonable person\nwould and maximally as a fully informed, ideal reasoner would (see\nGarrett 2012). \n\nNext, conscience is closely connected to autonomy: when we act\naccording to conscience we act as a law unto ourselves or according to\na law of our own nature. By being a law unto oneself Butler seemed to\nmean being motivated by our inner sense of moral rightness and\nwrongness and not being motivated by considerations external to the\nrightness or wrongness of acting or not acting (Sermon III §6).\nFor Butler, like Clarke, moral law, duty, obligation, or virtue, is\nright or wrong, morally good or bad independent of any punishment or\nreward (“Preface” § 29; “Dissertation on\nVirtue” §8). Butler criticized those forms of natural law\nand Hobbesian accounts of motivation that held that I am morally\nmotivated and given an authoritative reason for acting by a law\nsanctioned with rewards and punishments by a divine or civil\nlegislator. He argued that insofar as sanctions are superadded to the\nmoral rightness or wrongness of the act there is no connection between\nthe sanction and the rightness or wrongness of the action beyond the\narbitrary will of the legislator.  This connection is insufficient for\nmoral motivation. When I act primarily or only due to an external\nsanction I am not acting from a law unto myself (see Darwall\n1992). \n\nThis law of conscience is readily accessible to us —\n“the most near and intimate, the most certain and known”\n(“Preface”, § 26) — in a way that probable\nconsequences of prudential or interested actions are not. That an\nauthoritative principle dictates that we ought to intend a good action\ndoes not depend on external factors that might prevent or mitigate the\ndesired prudential outcome (but see McNaughton 2012). Relatedly, ends\nmay vary but conscience is “fixed, steady, and immovable”. \n\nButler argued in the Sermons that conscience was a principle\nsuperior to and governing of the particular passions, affections, and\ninstincts and established a hierarchy among them (Sermon XIII §7).\nAs previously discussed the hierarchy is natural. But due to\nambiguities in Butler’s presentation, in particular due to differences\nin the aims of individual sermons, there are a number of ways to\nunderstand the relation between conscience and the other\nprinciples. On one reading conscience is authoritative over the\nother main principles discussed by Butler — self-love and benevolence\n(if it is a principle — see Section 5) — and all when properly\nunderstood promote the same actions in accordance with our nature. When\nwe seek our own goods and those of others in accordance with conscience\nor reflection we act virtuously and we also promote our private\nhappiness. But, there are also passages that suggest that Butler held\nself-love to be a principle on par with conscience (Sidgwick III.12\n§2) or even above it (Sermon IX §15). And there are\npassages where Butler suggests that benevolence contains all the\nvirtues, and consequently this too seems to be a principle on par with\nor identical with conscience. Consequently there are multiple plausible\nhierarchies. Interpreters who advocate hierarchies which place\nself-love or benevolence on par with (or even above) conscience\nnormally either argue that they are still consistent with the supremacy\nof conscience or see this as showing a serious problem in\nButler’s arguments. \n\nHere are few of the problems. If it is reasonable to obey conscience,\nthen “the rules that Conscience lays down” are either\nreasonable in and of themselves or they are “the dictates of an\narbitrary authority” (Sidgwick, III.13 §2). If the latter,\nthen it is hard to see what justifies this arbitrary authority. But if\nthe former, then Sidgwick argues that there is no independent moral\nauthority for conscience — a conclusion which Sidgwick thought\nperfectly reasonable — and Butler is caught in the same\njustificatory circle that the Stoic arguments for life according to\nnature were: “it is reasonable to live according to Nature, and\nit is natural to live according to Reason” (ibid.). A related\nobjection is that since both conscience and self-love are rational\nprinciples and in general cannot be in conflict, conscience just\ndictates whatever self-love dictates and vice-versa. Consequently\nconscience cannot have a distinctive authority. Sturgeon identified a\ndifferent circularity connected with the justification of the\nsupremacy of conscience. Since Butler held that virtuous actions are\nthose in conformity to the nature of the agent and vicious ones not\nin conformity, according to Sturgeon “the doctrine of natural\nauthority of conscience is entirely superfluous” (Sturgeon,\n316). This is because if conscience points to the wrongness of an\naction the wrongness must be due to the action’s conformity or\nnon-conformity with our nature — i.e. due to a conflict among\nprinciples. Conscience can’t be pointing to a conflict with itself\nsince that would be circular.  So it must be a conflict with the next\nhighest principle: self-interest. But then conscience just asserts\nwhat self-interest dictates, and so the testimony of conscience is\nredundant and has no special authority. Put differently, Butler\nassumes that his argument that virtue is natural entails an argument\nfor the supremacy of conscience. But there is no good reason to assume\nthe entailment — in fact the two are not only independent, but\nin conflict. There have been a number of responses to\nSturgeon. Penelhum, notably, denied that Butler was committed to the\n“Full Naturalistic Thesis” and argued that Butler instead\nheld “the independent existence of the judgments of right and\nwrong” from judgments of “naturalness and\nunnaturalness” (Penelhum 1990, 68; see also Irwin 2008 §707\nand McNaughton 2012).  As previously noted Butler discusses two other important\nconstituents of human nature in addition to conscience and the\nparticular passions: self-love and benevolence. Central to\nButler’s analysis of self-love is his extremely influential\ndismissal of psychological egoism — in C. D. Broad’s words\n“he killed the theory so thoroughly that he sometimes seems to\nthe modern reader to be flogging dead horses” (Broad 1930, 55;\nbut see Penelhum 1985; Henson 1988; Sober 1992). For Butler, the kind\nof egoism exemplified for him by Hobbes — “the selfish\ntheory” in eighteenth century parlance — rests on the\nfailure to distinguish principles from passions. There is a trivial\nsense in which all of our passions are our own and the pleasure we\nhave in discharging or pursuing any passion is “self”\nlove. But it is also uninteresting: we can’t conclude much from\nthe fact that every passion we take pleasure in is our passion. We\ncertainly can’t conclude that human beings are always motivated\nby selfishness. That selfish theorists thought we could was due in\npart to their confusing the “ownership of an impulse with its\nobject” (Broad 1930, 65)—the inference from that the\npassions are ours to that we are the objects of the passions. Although\nthe passions belong to us it does not therefore follow that our\n“self”, or our self-gratification, is the object of the\npassion. \n\nThis mistake is connected to another: confusing the principle of\nself-love, which has the happiness of the self as its object, with\nparticular passions and desires. Once we recognize that “the pain\nof hunger and shame, and the delight from esteem, are no more self-love\nthan they are any thing in the world” (Sermon I, Note 3) —\nthey are particular passions and desires with particular objects — we\nsee that from the fact that we take pleasure in our passions and that\nthey are our passions it does not follow that we are guided by selfish\nprinciples. Passions do make us happy or unhappy. But that we have an\ninterest in being happy or unhappy is distinct from the particular\npassions, their objects, or the happiness arising from the passions —\nalthough it may be a reason to prefer one passion over another. This\nwas connected to Butler’s belief that passions are not interested\nin themselves. They have particular ends whereas self-love is our\ngeneral interest in securing our happiness. \n\nLike Shaftesbury and Francis Hutcheson, Butler thought it prima facie\nevident that human beings had benevolent motivations, and he thought\nit obvious that these benevolent motivations could make us happy and\nbe consistent with self-interest. The onus was on advocates of the\nselfish theory to provide a compelling case against. Butler placed\nmore stress on the exceptions than Shaftesbury had and stressed that\nthey are “naturally” consistent, i.e. that they are\nconsistent in our nature and the natural course of things although the\nunnatural and intemperate actions of others might interfere locally\n(Analogy III §5; §27). He saw Hobbes’\nreduction of all other-directed motivations -- such as compassion --\nto selfish motivations in disguise to deny an evident matter of fact\nfor theoretical reasons, i.e. in order to reconcile benevolence and\ncompassion with Hobbes’ general hypothesis about human nature.\nBut once a compassionate motivation is recast as a selfish motivation,\nfor Hobbes as a type of fear, it conflicts with the sense of the term\nbeing explained to the point that it engenders contradiction. For\nexample: we feel compassion strongly towards our friends. If\ncompassion were a fear then we would fear our friends strongly, which\nseems to conflict with the agreed use of the word\n“compassion”. \n\nWhich was not to deny of course that people act from selfishness,\nself-partiality, and confused self-interest. Selfishness and\nself-partiality often mix with benevolent motivations to give rise to\nbenevolent and even compassionate actions (Sermon V Note 1). Unlike\nShaftesbury and Hutcheson, Butler stressed that human beings often act\nfrom mixed and opaque motives (as will be discussed in Section 6). But\nthe existence of mixed motivations presumes non-interested motivations\nwith which selfishness is mixed, not the reducibility of all motivations\nto selfishness or self-partiality. This also has the virtue of being a\nsimpler explanation than the more complicated selfish motivations\noffered by Hobbes’ theory. \n\nAccording to Butler, once clarified self-love is properly understood\nas “regard to our own Interest, Happiness, and private Good” (Sermon IX\n§8). Butler further suggests that self-love can be pursued better\nand worse, and that it is best reflected on via reason in a cool and\nimpartial way. By “cool” Butler understood\n“impartial” in the sense of not being swayed away from the\ntruth by particular loves and hates or by self-partiality. And by\n“reason” Butler understood the faculty of discerning truth\n(Sermon XIII §5). Self-love worked best and our\ninterest was best served when we impartially seek what is truly in our\ninterest. When understood in this way it can clearly suggest actions\nthat conflict with selfishness. Conversely resolute selfishness and\nself-partiality are not the best course for self-love. To satisfy\na particular desire may or may not make us happy in either the short or\nlong-term and may not educe to our private good. And although\nsatisfying a desire may make us happy, and all of our happiness may be\nthe result of particular passions, no particular passion has happiness\nin general as its object. \n\nConversely we might fruitlessly seek our interest but have no\nparticular object in mind. Or we might obsess over our interest to such\na degree that we would continually be exercising the principle of\nself-love but not actually satisfying our particular passions and\nconsequently not be happy. “Happiness consists in the\nGratification of certain Affections, Appetites, Passions, with Objects\nwhich are by Nature adapted to them,” (Sermon IX §16).\nSelf-love is a principle governing actions leading to the\nsatisfaction or avoidance of the particular passions. Both\nself-love and the particular passions are necessary for the proper\nnatural functioning of human beings. \n\nOnce self-love is distinguished from selfishness, self-partiality and\nthe particular passions it becomes clearer that the conflict between\nself-love and benevolence is mostly an illusion when considered in the\nlong term. Particular passions like compassion are perfectly\nconsistent with self-love, indeed Butler held that to take pleasure in\nbenevolent and virtuous acts and view them as part of one’s happiness\nis “itself the Temper of Satisfaction and Enjoyment.” In\nthe Analogy, Butler provided further arguments that the natural\ntendency of virtue was the reward of happiness, and the natural\npunishment for vice, misery. We often fail to see this natural\ntendency because we focus on accidents or a limited range of examples\nto the detriment of the consistent long-term tendencies. Butler\nsuggested a thought experiment of a monarchy run on virtuous\nprinciples (Analogy III §20) and argued that it would tend to be\nhappier and more powerful than other regimes if allowed to flourish,\neventually becoming a universal monarchy. The natural tendency of\nhappiness, power, and virtue all coincide in its flourishing, growth,\nand moral governance. And happiness as coupled to virtue in this life\npoints to happiness as the consistent reward for virtue in the next\nwhen accidents do not threaten to derail the natural tendency. \n\nWhich is not to suggest that conscience, virtue, and self-love are\nidentical, although Butler connected them very deeply (Frey 1992 and\nn.p.). Although virtue tends to coincide with interest it tends to\ncoincide because a virtuous life is a life with the right balance of\nbenevolent passions and dispositions to make one happy and a life which\nresponds to the unchanging and immediate moral authority of conscience\n-- although they are approved of and motivated by self-love as\nwell. \n\nButler uses benevolence mainly to refer to a particular\npassion or a cluster of passions (McNaughton 1992), although sometimes\nhe also refers to it and cognate terms (“love of thy neighbor”) as\nprinciples that might have particular passions as their objects. There\nis still a fair amount of scholarly disagreement as to which sense is\nmore central in Butler’s arguments (nicely summarized in Irwin\n2008). Benevolence as a particular passion, like ambition or revenge,\nis never interested or disinterested in and of itself. It is only\ninterested or disinterested in so far as it is guided by or in\naccordance with our self-love. Acting in a benevolent manner might make\nus happy. Indeed it seems to be the case that benevolent actions and\naffections often do make people happy. And we might initially decide to\ngratify the passions of benevolence from self-love. But the passions\nthemselves have no more or less connection to interest than any other\npassion does. \n\nNot being made happy by benevolent actions would point to a defect\nof temper or a lack of balance in one’s nature if the result was\ndiminished happiness and going against the dictates of conscience. As\nnoted, for both Butler and Shaftesbury, self-love and virtue converge\nwhen properly understood. But importantly according to Butler,\nShaftesbury erred in not recognizing that they could conflict in\nparticular cases, and if they did conflict the distinctive authority of\nconscience would trump our apparent prudential motivations. This did\nnot mean that our general interest conflicted with conscience, but\nrather that local prudential information could give reasons for\nparticular reasons for action that conflicted with conscience. \n\nThere is also some (more contested) evidence that Butler\nthought of benevolence as a ruling principle (Rorty 1978). Butler referred to\nthe general principle of charity or “love of our neighbor as thyself”\nas a virtuous principle or as the reason-guided endeavor to promote the\nhappiness of proximate others to the same degree that one attempts to\npromote one’s own good (although he also identified “love of\nneighbor” with the particular passion of compassion). This\nwas a regulating principle of action, perhaps distinct from benevolent\npassions. Butler suggested in Sermon IX that we have a fundamental\nobligation to the happiness of sensible creatures other than ourselves\ninsofar as they are capable of pleasure and pain, an obligation that\ncan only be ignored in order to bring about greater happiness (to be\nfurther discussed in Section 6). Although this appears to be a\nfundamental moral obligation to maximize welfare a few years later\nButler strongly criticized theories on which the overall happiness is\nwhat makes an action good or evil and argued that our conscience holds\nactions to be morally good or bad independent of the expected or actual\nconsequences for happiness (“Dissertation”, §5).\nMost of the secondary literature takes Butler to generally be an\nanti-utilitarian (but see Louden 1995 and in a different way see Frey),\nbut there is disagreement as to whether Butler held a consistent\nposition or changed his mind (see McPherson 1948–9). Some even argue\nthat he might be able to embrace a form of consequentialism (see\nMcNaughton 2017). \n\nFinally, Butler claimed that benevolence is the whole of virtue in\nSermon XII, although he qualified the claim later in Sermon XII and\nqualified it even more strongly in the “Dissertation on\nVirtue”. Butler did not mean that to act benevolently in each and\nevery action was the entirety of virtue, for example as we shall see in\nthe next section moral resentment was an appropriate attitude for a\nvirtuous agent. Rather he meant that to act according to and to\nbe motivated by the principle of loving one’s neighbor generally leads\nto virtuous and morally approved actions. Although self-partiality\ntends in the opposite direction, benevolence offsets this tendency and\nbrings benevolent and self-partial affections in proper proportion.\nConversely self-partiality brings benevolence in line with self-love\nsuch that it balances properly in our nature. \n\nAccording to Butler when we approve of virtue in an agent this gives\nrise to benevolence towards the agent. The ultimate object of this love\nof benevolent moral agents is our love of God, the most benevolent\nagent. In stressing the continuity between love of neighbor and love of\nGod, Butler also stressed the continuity between our approval of moral\nagents and natural theology. Finally, to have a character such that\nbenevolent actions make one happy is normally to have a character that\nencompasses all of the virtues. \n\nCompassion was besides the love of God the most important of the\nparticular passions involving benevolence for Butler. He defined\ncompassion as “real sorrow and concern for the misery of our fellow\ncreatures” giving rise to the desire to relieve their distress. The\npassion of compassion arose from the imaginative ability to substitute\nanother for oneself and thereby to be affected by the distresses of\nthat other with whom one compassionates as towards oneself (Sermon V\nNote 1). Butler readily admitted that the psychological process\nthat gives rise to compassion included both pleasure in the fact that\nwe were not suffering the distress as well and awareness of our own\nsusceptibility to the ills prompting distress in the object of our\ncompassion. But although the process of giving rise to compassion also\ngives rise to and even includes self-partial thoughts, “compassion”\nrefers strictly to a “real sorrow and concern for the misery of our\nfellow creatures” (Sermon V Note 1). To identify it with a self-partial\npleasure in the fact that we were not in distress or with the desire to\nalleviate distress in order to no longer be annoyed by it was to be\nconfused about the meaning of word. Although according to Butler\ncompassion, like any affection, must be governed by reason, the\nmotivation to virtuous actions that compassion gives rise to would not\nbe given rise to by reason alone. Consequently the passion of\ncompassion has a central role in our moral actions. Moreover, the\nprinciple of private self-love is not sufficient to serve our welfare\nwithout compassion, i.e., compassion is an important ingredient in our\nwell being in addition to being an important moral passion. Its\nimportance for our well being can be seen, according to Butler, in the\nfact that those who lack compassion, who have “hardness of heart”, tend\nto have diminished happiness blocking the scope and degree of their\nhappiness. \n\nResentment or anger was somewhat more difficult for Butler to deal\nwith insofar as it was ubiquitous to human beings but conflicted with\nthe Christian command to love our enemies. Butler made two\ndistinctions, between settled (or deliberate) and hasty (or sudden)\nresentment and between resentment raised by non-moral harm or\nresentment raised by moral injury. He further distinguished between\nresentment and the negative passion of malice (although he denies the\nexistence of disinterested, cool, direct ill-will or malice). Hasty\nresentment is an immediate response to “mere harm without appearance of\nwrong or injustice,” (Sermon VIII, §7). It can be excessive and\nmisguided, and one can be morally culpable for excessive and misguided\nexpressions of it, but hasty resentment serves an important end of\nself-preservation and care of one’s near and dear. Settled resentment\nis an affection that has moral evil or injustice as its object.\nAlthough moral evil gives rise to pain which can strengthen this\nsettled resentment, the object of the resentment is not the pain or\nharm done but instead the design or intention to morally injure, harm,\ndo wrong and injustice. And the goal of resentment is to cause\nappropriate injury in a wrongdoer, not malign injury or revenge that\nare distinguished from resentment. For Butler, settled resentment has\nan important moral end in drawing men together to pursue justice, in\nmaking them fear engendering resentment in mankind due to their\nactions, and to extirpate moral wickedness: it is “one of the common\nbonds by which society is held together, a fellow feeling, which each\nindividual has in behalf of the whole species, as well as oneself.”\nIndeed Butler goes so far as to suggest that communal moral resentment\nand the justice it gives rise to is what separates us from the state of\nnature where each man is arbiter of his own punishment which quickly\ndevolves into revenge (a point developed further in Six\nSermons). \n\nThis raises a central problem for resentment as a moral sentiment or\npassion: unless kept strictly within bounds it devolves into revenge\nand conflicts with benevolence and virtue. Part of the answer is that\nhowever extreme an injury done, and however settled the resentment\nrising in response, the execution of justice does not supersede the\nprior obligation of good will we have to all humans insofar as they are\ncapable of happiness and misery. Rather we harm wrong doers to\npreserve “the quiet and happiness of the world” and this “general\nand more enlarged obligation destroys a more particular and confined\none of the same kind, inconsistent with it. Guilt and injury then does\nnot dispense with or supersede the duty of goodwill,” (Sermon IX\n§15). Another part of the answer is that since the proper object\nis the injustice, to resent someone’s whole character as opposed to the\nparticular aspect of character that gave rise to the harm, i.e. to\nportray them as wholly monstrous, is to move beyond the appropriate\nbounds. This pitfall is easier to avoid when we recognize our own mixed\ncharacters and flaws. Relatedly, and perhaps most importantly one must\nrecognize that self-partiality is often fueling a desire for revenge\nagainst those we resent insofar as they have injured us. We ought to\nattempt to view injuries to us from as distant and unprejudiced a human\nviewpoint as possible — with full awareness of our own future\nnon-existence and final judgment -- and when we do we will be able to\nrecognize that our enemies are as often as not mistaken or\nacting inadvertently. \n\nThe awareness of our own flaws, and our acceptance of the\nnon-existence of cool, disinterested and malign wills as well as our\nrecognition of the ubiquity of mixed characters also gives rise to\ncompassion and the desire to forgive. But notably for Butler\nforgiveness does not entail giving up resentment for moral wrongs\n(Griswold 2008; Garcia 2011). Rather it entails checking inappropriate resentment,\nanger, and revenge, being aware when what appears to be a moral harm is\nin fact an inadvertent injury whose putative moral injustice is\ninflated by our own partiality, and treating others who harm us with\nthe same compassion that we hold all humans due good-will should be\ntreated (Radzik 2014). \n\nButler devoted three of his Sermons to issues connected with\nself-deceit (IV, VI, X). The focus on the pervasiveness of self-deceit\nas a serious moral problem is an important difference between Butler\nand his more optimistic confreres Hutcheson and Shaftesbury. For Butler\nwe are often self-deceived even when we think we are doing what is\nmorally right (in fact if we think we are wholly in the right we are\nalmost always deceived (Sermon X §13)) and we often only recognize\nour self-deception — if at all -- upon later reflection. That we\nare so prone to self-deception is mainly due to a lack of reflection\nwhen acting prompted by self-partiality. \n\nAccording to Butler, most of us can access what the right thing is to\ndo in most circumstances, and most of us often wish to do the right\nthing when it doesn’t conflict with our self-partiality. But we\nare also susceptible to engage in self-deceit in order to justify\nacting on self-partial motives even when it conflicts with what is\nmorally right. Butler illustrated this sort of self-deceit by\nreference to the example of Balaam, a prophet who had been asked to\ncurse the Israelites by the Moabites. Even though God expressly forbade\nBalaam, he still considered cursing the Israelites when greater rewards\nwere offered by Moabite ambassadors. The puzzle was how could Balaam\nknow what was right but still be motivated to do what was wrong?\nButler’s answer was not so much to try to solve the problem of\nakrasia as to describe the moral psychology of\nself-deceit. \n\nBalaam’s moral failure was effected by his avoiding reflecting\non his actions, by a pervasive asymmetry in how we view ourselves and\nhow we view others due to native self-partiality that can only be\ncorrected by reflection, and by a difficulty in discerning the exact\ndegree to which we are obliged to act morally. The three are\ninterconnected. We are normally happy to unreflectively cut more slack\nfor ourselves than we are willing to cut for others due to\nself-partiality or an “overfondness for ourselves” (Sermon\nX §6). When a morally right action is a matter of degree, it is\neasy and common to avoid reflection and to err on the side of\nself-partiality in the degree in which the moral action is undertaken.\nThis allows one to engage in more and more immoral acts while\nconvincing oneself that each undermining of the rule is justified and\nreasonable. In the story of Balaam, Balaam invites the ambassadors to\nstay the night under the aegis of hospitality. By analogy for Butler we\nundermine rules under the aegis of ordinary sociability and civility\n– for example we engage in self-serving malicious gossip under\nthe aegis of being sociable — and gradually undermine our capacity to\nact from the dictate of conscience when called upon to do so. \n\nSince conscience is authoritative and proximate for Butler, and\nsince the dictates of conscience coincide with our self-love,\nself-deceit only gets off the ground if we avoid reflection or if we\nreflect poorly. In addition to the oversimplifying and bad faith just\ndescribed, we give self-deceit a foothold by refusing to look at or\navoiding the facts of the matter when we feel these facts will go\nagainst our self-partial desires — Butler gives the example of\nprofligate spenders not looking at the state of their finances (Sermon\nX §11) — and by relying piecemeal on the counsel of others\nwhen these counsels serve our interest. \n\nIn one of his less read sermons (Sermon IV) Butler suggests that\ncareful government of the tongue is important to one’s moral well\nbeing. The role of others — both our oppositions to and\nagreements with others — and its relation to self-governance is\nparticularly crucial for Butler in explaining this sort of self-deceit.\nOur tendency to paint the characters of others in black and white\nallows us to justify our immoral actions by virtue of the fact that we\nself-deceptively (and self-righteously) cast ourselves and our\nmotivations as wholly good in opposition to our opponent who is wholly\nevil, and so we can treat them however we see fit. We also draw on the\nidle comments of others that conform with our self-partial desires to\nserve as external justification of our immoral actions. \n\nThe problem then is given human beings great capacity for self-deceit,\nhow can it be prevented? Is not the attempt to prevent self-deceit as\nprone to self-deceit as anything else? Butler’s answer is that\nhabitual and systematic self-reflection and self-governance by rigid\nrules are the best response. In a manner reminiscent of Epictetus’\nfamous maxim one must watch oneself as an enemy lying in ambush, and\nview one’s actions as an enemy would judging them harshly, Butler\nsuggests a two part rule to this end “One is, to substitute\nanother for yourself, when you take a survey of any part of your\nbehavior, or consider what is proper and fit and reasonable for you to\ndo on any occasion: the other part is, that you… consider\nyourself as the person affected by such a behavior,” (Sermon X\n§15). The rule “itself may be dishonestly applied”\nbut even the misguided attempt to apply it may reveal more truth than\nnot applying it at all. In the Analogy Butler argued that one\nof the central moral purposes of this life is as a probationary period\nin the acquisition of habits of self-governance (Analogy\nV). That these habits are not fool-proof is a consequence of the fact\nthat our ability to apply them seriously to ourselves is one of the\nbases for our ultimate punishment and reward. \n\nThe problem of self-deceit is connected to another of Butler’s abiding\nthemes, human ignorance of the larger design of God. In Sermon XV\n“Upon Human Ignorance” (notably the final sermon of the\ncollection), the Analogy and the “Dissertation on\nVirtue”, Butler stressed that our knowledge of design is\nprobable at best. Sermon XV concludes with an exhortation reminiscent\nof Locke.  Since we have such limited knowledge of providence and of\nGod’s design, we should turn our attention to that which we can have\nknowledge of: our nature insofar as it bears on our moral governance\nand conduct. \n\nThe argument of the Analogy and the “Dissertation on\nVirtue” were both premised on this. In the Analogy,\nButler argued that we have probable evidence that our morally right\nand wrong actions will be judged and rewarded and punished by God and\nthat this life is a probationary period where we act in ways that will\nultimately be judged. \n\nButler’s Sermons were read in the eighteenth century, in\nparticular after the publication of the Analogy, and went\nthrough multiple editions. The Analogy was reprinted many\ntimes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as were\nButler’s works. His initial influence seems to have been\ngreatest on Scottish philosophers, including (perhaps) his\ncontemporary Francis Hutcheson, George Turnbull, David Fordyce, David\nHume, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, and their fellow travellers —\nnotably Edmund Burke. Hume sought to meet Butler and emended the\nmanuscript copy of A Treatise on Human Nature he gave to him\nfor fear it would cause offense. Hume’s and Smith’s\naccounts of sympathy, compassion, resentment, justice, and their\nempirical attitude towards moral psychology (and to the centrality of\nmoral psychology for ethics) and the limits of metaphysical\nexplanations in morals bear Butler’s influence.  Hume’s\ndiscussion of induction in his\nTreatise has also been seen as a criticism of Butler’s\nprocedure in the Analogy (Russell 2008). Butler was also\nwidely read in Germany. Solomon Maimon, for example, quotes\nButler’s “Dissertation on Virtue”in the Preface to\nhis Autobiography.  In the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth century Butler’s Sermons became more\ninfluential than the Analogy, due to their influence at\nOxford and Cambridge and particularly on William Whewell (see Tennant\n195–199) and Sidgwick. Throughout the later nineteenth century\nand the twentieth century they were discussed by and had great impact\non many of the central moral philosophers of the Anglo-American\ntradition — G. E. Moore, H. A. Pritchard, and particularly\nW. D. Ross, among many.  Butler’s influence and importance has\npersisted (see, for example, the section on Butlerian Accounts in the\nentry on\n forgiveness).","contact.mail":"garrett@bu.edu","contact.domain":"bu.edu"}]
