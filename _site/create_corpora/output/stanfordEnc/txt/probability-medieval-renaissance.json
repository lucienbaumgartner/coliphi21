Terms such as ‘probable’\n(probabilis), ‘credible’ (credibilis) or\n‘truth-like’ (verisimilis) were used to assess\nphilosophical claims, qualify uncertain conclusions, gauge the force\nof arguments and temper academic disagreement. Beyond that, they had a\nsignificant impact on the regulation of legal proceedings, moral\naction and everyday life. The probability-related terminology of the\nMiddle Ages descended from ancient sources such as Aristotle, Cicero\nand Boethius. There is no precedent, however, for many medieval ways\nof connecting these terms to rules and principles for legal and\npractical decision-making.\n\n\nMedieval scholastic uses of probability evolved into the significantly\ndifferent probability discourses of early modern scholasticism and\nhumanism, which both were finally eclipsed by modern quantitative\nnotions of probability in the eighteenth century. Much is still\nunknown concerning these processes, but a fuller understanding can\nonly be approached by accounting for their medieval origins. This\nbackground is also important for charting the shifting borders of\ncertainty and uncertainty, or knowledge and opinion, in European\nphilosophy.\n\nModern notions of probability are quantitative (Hájek 2011).\nThey underlie the representation of probabilities by real (initially:\nfractional) numbers from the interval between 0 and 1. On this basis,\na probability calculus with its own mathematical rules (the Kolmogorov\naxioms) has\n arisen.[1]\n The present mathematics of probability marks the end-point of a\ndevelopment which began in the middle of the seventeenth century with\nthe calculation of chances in games of fortune by Pascal, Fermat, and\nHuygens. These early calculations were considerably refined in the\neighteenth century by the Bernoullis, Montmort, De Moivre, Laplace,\nBayes, and others (Daston 1988; Hacking 2006; Hald 2003). Modern\nconceptualizations of probability emerged at the same time. They\nevolved around the ideas of a ratio of possibilities, a relative\nfrequency of events, a degree of belief, or a degree of\nconfirmation. \nPre-modern notions of probability were very different. No\npre-modern notion of probability was numerical. A calculus of\nprobabilities simply did not exist before the seventeenth\n century.[2]\n Pre-modern probability was a qualitative predicate mainly applied to\npropositions (e.g., by calling an opinion probable), but extending to\nother subject matters as well. The use of the word\n‘probable’ in ordinary language still resembles this older\nusage to some extent (Franklin 2001, 126; Hacking 2006, 18). Yet,\nwhereas the mathematics of probability was invented in the early\nmodern era, some continuities in the meaning(s) of probability exist.\nThese continuities will be discussed in Section 6. Until that point,\nit is best to forget the connotations of modern notions of probability\nand to approach medieval probability-related terms without modern\npreconceptions. For their vocabulary, medieval and Renaissance authors\ncould draw on a well-stocked ancient Greek and Roman store of\nprobability-related terms. In consequence, a variety of Latin terms\nwere in use, which are today translated as ‘probable’,\n‘plausible’, ‘reputable’\n(probabilis); ‘truth-like’, ‘apparently\ntrue’ (verisimilis); ‘credible’,\n‘worthy of belief’ (credibilis,\nopinabilis); or ‘most often’,\n‘frequently’ (ut frequenter). Modern readers may\nnot always find it obvious that these terms relate to probability;\nbut, in fact, they are highly relevant for its conceptual evolution.\nUp to the nineteenth century, when philosophers spoke about\nprobability their claims were still often rooted in medieval notions\nof probability. \nMedieval and Renaissance philosophers used probability-related\nvocabulary; but they did not analyze the underlying concepts in depth,\nat least in comparison with the thoroughness of their investigations\ninto the notions of knowledge or science (scientia).\nProbability-related terms were usually introduced in passing, and the\nmost differentiated treatments extended to a folio page at best.\nNevertheless, issues of probability were not peripheral to medieval\nthought. Probability-related terms and concepts played an enormous\nrole in the regulation of everyday conduct and in many arts and\nsciences. Rhetoric and dialectic were by definition concerned with\npersuasion, credibility, and probability. Yet medieval thinkers were\nalso highly aware that many claims in jurisprudence, theology, and\nmedicine could not be derived with certainty from indubitable\npremises. Hence, arguments in these fields had to rely more often than\nnot on probable reasoning. The notorious disagreements between\nscholastic academics in their fields of inquiry, nourished and\nrepresented by the practice of scholastic disputation, further\nincreased the demand for probable reasoning. Wherever disagreement was\nlicit and impossible to extirpate by argument, the claims of all sides\ncounted as merely probable. Since medieval theologians and lawyers\nwere no more in agreement concerning the ascription of sins (or of\nmoral actions) than on other matters, the guidance of human conduct by\nconfessors was also a matter of probability. In this domain, the\nregulation of decisions of conscience relied on a systematic framework\nof probable reasoning and decision in conditions of uncertainty. In\nshort, for a satisfactory understanding of the medieval intellectual\nedifice, inspection of the uses of probability seems\nindispensable. \nThis is true for the medieval period, the Renaissance, and in\ndifferent ways for early modern scholasticism until the eighteenth\ncentury. We should not assume, however, that the uses and\nunderstanding of probability remained unchanged throughout this long\nspan of time. For this reason, the period from roughly 1200–1500\nis singled out here for discussion. It is the period of mature\nmedieval scholasticism and covers much of the Renaissance. In the\nsixteenth century, the discourse on probability underwent significant\nchanges, on the scholastic as well as the humanist side. This early\nmodern discourse needs to be clearly differentiated from its medieval\nprecursor and is therefore excluded from consideration here (but see\nthe references in Sections 4.3 and 6). \nWithin the period under consideration, a distinction between\nscholastic and humanist uses of probability can be made. This is not\nto say that there was a big divide between them. The same terms were\nused by scholastics and humanists with similar meanings. The normative\nand regulatory uses of probability, however, were anchored in\nscholastic theology and jurisprudence; therefore, they are in the\nforeground here. At least some Renaissance humanists used\nprobability-related terms differently from the scholastic mainstream;\nand these differences will be addressed in Section 5. \nThat the conceptualization of probability was not exclusively a\nEuropean affair also deserves attention. Many cultures around the\nworld tilled the conceptual field of probability, in antiquity and not\nleast in the medieval era. The question of the extent to which\nnon-Western notions and uses of probability shaped the treatment of\nprobability in the Latin Middle Ages (or vice versa) cannot be\nanswered here; however, some of the scholastic authors discussed below\nexplicitly referred to Islamic sources in their accounts of\nprobability. \nTerms, such as the Latin probabilis were already in use in\nthe early Middle Ages and can, for instance, be found in Carolingian\ntexts on rhetoric (e.g., Alcuin, Rhetoric, 113). The ancient\nauthorities on the subject were Cicero and Boethius, whereas\nAristotle’s most seminal statements on probability-related\nconcepts became known only after the middle of the twelfth century\n(see Cox and Ward 2006; Fredborg 1988, 150; Greenberg-Pedersen 1984).\nParticularly significant in this respect were the introduction of\nAristotle’s Topics into academic discourse in the\nmiddle of the twelfth century (but the full impact was not felt before\n1200) and the new translations of Aristotle’s Nicomachean\nEthics and Rhetoric in the thirteenth\n century.[3]\n By the end of this century, Aristotle’s definitions had largely\n(though not entirely) supplanted those of Cicero and Boethius in\nscholastic thought. The impact of this change should not be\nexaggerated because the notions of probability held by Cicero and, in\nparticular, Boethius were in significant respects close to those of\nAristotle.  \nThe main probability-related terms in this period were\nprobabilis, verisimilis, credibilis,\nopinabilis, and some expressions indicating frequency such as\nut frequenter, ut in pluribus, and\nfrequentius. We need to look carefully at the specific\nmeanings of these words and phrases before proceeding to concepts of\nprobability in a narrower sense.  \nProbabilis was the most important probability-related\npredicate in the Middle Ages (and in the whole scholastic tradition).\nIt is often possible to translate probabilis as\n‘probable’ in an ordinary language sense, but attention\nshould be paid to meanings arising from a combination with particular\nnouns. The predicate probabilis mainly pertained to\npropositions, sentences, or opinions, but these are not the only\nmeaningful referents. Sometimes persons were described as probable, as\nin the phrase “the more probable philosophers”\n(philosophi probabiliores). Thomas Deman (1933, 262) renders\nthis phrase as “the philosophers who deserve most\nconsideration”; but one could also translate it as “the\nphilosophers who are more likely to find the truth”. Signs were\nalso sometimes called probable (signum probabile), as in\nSilvester de Prierio’s Summa under the heading\n‘probabile’. Last but not least, probability was\nattributed to events, for instance, when Thomas Aquinas, in Summa\ntheologiae II-II, q. 32, 5, 1322, says “according as things\nprobably and generally occur / according to what probably and\ngenerally occurs” (secundum ea quae probabiliter et in\npluribus occurrunt). As we shall see, however, it is conceivable\nthat all these assertions are elliptic references to the probability\nof propositions. \nA proposition was probable (probabilis) if specific\nindicators of truth justified assent (i.e., holding it true) or\nacceptance as a premise for\n action.[4]\n The main justifications for judgments of probability will be\ndiscussed in more detail in Section 3, on “Scholastic Concepts\nof Probability”. For the moment, it is enough to say that\nauthority, testimony, a sufficient (but not maximal) appearance of\ntruth, and frequent truth could buttress an ascription of\nprobability. \nThe most prolific category of probable propositions were opinions in\nthe medieval technical sense of this term. An opinion\n(opinio) was often defined as a proposition held to be true\nbut which the person holding it feared might be wrong (see Byrne 1968,\nFranklin 2001). This was only one of several medieval understandings\nof opinion. Robert Grosseteste (∼1175–1253) reminded his\nreaders that opinio could be understood in three\n ways.[5]\n According to the simplest meaning, opinion stood for any cognition\ncharacterized by assent; and, in this understanding, propositions\nexpressing knowledge or conviction were also opinions. According to a\nmore proper definition, opinion denoted assent to a proposition with a\nfear that the opposite might be true. Finally, according to the most\nprecise definitions, opinions were limited to contingent propositions\nto which assent was given and the opposite of which were somehow\nfeared to be true. Grosseteste’s distinctions show that\nthirteenth-century scholastics were already aware that the term\nopinio was used far from uniformly by contemporary authors.\nThat said, it should nevertheless be kept in mind that medieval\ndiscussions of the use of probable opinions predominantly operated on\nthe basis of the second meaning of opinio as a proposition to\nwhich assent was given and which was accompanied by a fear that the\nopposite might be true. The fear in question resulted at least in part\nfrom an awareness that one’s judgment might be fallible.\nAccording to a widely observed medieval ranking of epistemological\nconfidence and doxological firmness, the category of opinion stood\nbelow faith or full conviction (fides) and knowledge\n (scientia).[6]\n All three epistemic attitudes involved assent, but only faith and\nknowledge implied full subjective certainty (certitudo). \nOn this basis, “probable opinion” (opinio\nprobabilis) became a standard term for a class of propositions\nheld to be true, which humans had to be content with in many fields of\ninvestigation. In these fields, human fallibility or the changeable\nnature of the subject matter precluded full knowledge\n(scientia), and a lack of religious relevance or accepted\ntheological contentiousness prevented the intervention of faith\n(fides). The scope of this domain was enormous. In\nphilosophical theory, it was the home-ground for dialectical\nargumentation and dialectical syllogisms (see Section 4.1); on a\npractical level, it was regulated by counselors of conscience and\nlawyers.  \nFor the regulation of consciences, another standard term was\n‘probable certainty’ (certitudo probabilis).\nProbable certainty forestalled sin by enabling one to base one’s\nactions on correct probable reasoning. Since reasoning which went\nbeyond the probable was virtually unattainable in many moral contexts,\nan agent satisfied her or his epistemic duties by relying on sound\nprobable reasoning, thus acquiring a subjective certainty of having\ndone all that could be expected of an agent to avoid sin (Gardeil\n1911; Schuessler 2003, 50). In the opinion of many medieval\nscholastics, probable reasoning could not generate epistemological\ncertainty; the phrase “probable certainty”, however,\nsprang from compliance with moral demands (which we would call\nepistemic duties today) and not from strong conviction based on\nevidence. Perhaps because of the risk of misunderstanding it implied,\n‘probable certainty’ was largely supplanted, from the\nfifteenth century onward, by the similar concept of ‘moral\ncertainty’ (certitudo moralis), (Franklin 2001, 69;\nKnebel 2000, 55; Schuessler 2009). \nIn the field of jurisprudence, the term probabilis was\ntypically combined with presumptions (presumptiones). A\nprobable presumption for or against a culprit was one that in itself\ndid not suffice to incline a reasonable judge to a verdict (only\nvehement or violent presumptions could achieve that). Nevertheless,\nprobable presumptions had some juridical weight (in contrast to\ncareless presumptions, presumptiones temerariae) and could be\naggregated to justify a verdict (Franklin 2001, 43). \nIn medieval usage, verisimilis meant what it literally said:\nthat something was ‘truth-like’. This did not, however,\nimply that the thing was actually close to truth, because it might\nhave only the appearance – possibly spurious or superficial\n– of truth. Signs, images, and circumstantial evidence were\noften called verisimilis if they satisfied these conditions.\nMedieval lawyers spoke of ‘truth-like circumstantial\nevidence’ (indicia verisimilia), and Albert of Cologne\n(Logica, 241) maintained that what was\n‘truth-like’ resided in ‘signs’\n(verisimile est in\n signis).[7] \nWas verisimilis used as a synonym for probabilis by\nmedieval scholastics? Albert (ibid.) claims straightforwardly that\n“probable things are truth-like” (probabilia …\nsunt\n verisimilia).[8]\n Other scholastic uses of these words suggest instead a mere relation\nof frequent mutual implication. Probable opinions were usually\ntruth-like because their probability prima facie justified an\nassumption of truth. Truth-like signs often justified an ascription of\nprobability to an assertion. The widespread combination of\nprobabilis with particular kinds of proposition (Aristotelian\nendoxa; see Section 3.1) and of verisimilis with\nsigns are nevertheless good reasons to assume that these predicates\nwere not synonymous. The distinction between the terms may reflect\nestablished differences in ancient Greek terminology, tying\nprobabilis to pithanon (persuasive, adoptable) and\nverisimilis to eikos (truth-like). Such differences\narguably already pervaded Cicero’s usage of probabilis\nand verisimilis, although the matter is\n contentious.[9] \nA proposition was regarded as credibilis or\nopinabilis if it could legitimately be accepted as\none’s opinion. The underlying criteria were often the same as\nfor probabilis. Propositions which did not satisfy the\nrespective criteria were called inopinabilis or\nimprobabilis, and deserved to be rejected by rational and\nresponsible epistemic agents. This meant that improbable propositions\nought not to be taken for true or accepted as a premise for action,\nbut not necessarily that they must be regarded as\n false.[10] \nA host of frequency terms such as “frequently”\n(frequenter), “more frequently” (ut\nfrequentius) and “for the most part” (ut in\npluribus), or their converses such as “rarely”\n(ut in paucioribus), often accompanied ascriptions of\nprobability in medieval scholasticism. What frequently or usually\nhappened was prima facie considered to be probable. Scholastic usage\nof frequency terms followed ancient precedent, most notably\nAristotle’s statements of what is true or false “in most\ncases” (hōs epi to polu). Whether this background\nin Aristotelian science and methodology justifies the assumption of a\nmedieval frequency concept of probability will be discussed in Section\n3.2. \nIn some areas of medieval thought, probability-related terms were\nimportant for the regulation of decision-making and conduct. In these\ncontexts, the term “probable” (probabilis) took\non a specific significance. Whether a merchant wanted to follow an\nopinion concerning the moral legitimacy of a contract or a lawyer\nformulated a presumption, it had to be probabilis to possess\nmoral or juridical weight. It is now necessary to discuss the most\nimportant medieval understandings of probabilis, grounding\nthem in ancient definitions or precedent.  \nUntil the thirteenth century, the definitions of\n“probable” by Cicero and Boethius very much shaped the\nmedieval understanding of probability: \nThat is probable which for the most part usually comes to pass, or\nwhich is a part of the ordinary beliefs of mankind, or which contains\nin itself some resemblance to these qualities, whether such\nresemblance be true or false. (Cicero, De inventione,\nI.29.46) \nSomething is readily believable (probabilis) if it seems true\nto everyone or to the most people or to the wise – and of the\nwise, either to all of them or most of them or to the most famous and\ndistinguished – or to an expert in his own field, for example,\nto a doctor in the field of medicine or to a pilot in the navigation\nof ships, or, finally, if it seems true to the person with whom one is\nhaving the conversation or who is judging it. (Boethius, De\ntopicis, 1180b28) \nFor Cicero, probability represents the usual course of events,\ncommonly held beliefs, or what resembles them. His characterization of\nprobability thus contains the roots of at least two different concepts\nof probability. Boethius repeats Aristotle’s definition of an\nendoxon (see Section 3.1) as a readily believable proposition\nalmost verbatim and calls it probabilis. In this respect, he\nprepared the way for the reception of Aristotle’s original\ndefinition; but note that Boethius addresses the role of experts more\nexplicitly than Aristotle, who in medieval translations summarily\nrefers to sapientes, the\n wise.[11] \nAristotle replaced Cicero and Boethius as supreme authority on\nprobability in the thirteenth century. This is also the time when\nmedieval probability discourse fully unfolded. For the period from\n(roughly) 1200 to 1500, it is possible to identify four different\nconcepts of probability: the endoxic, proto-frequentist, testimonial\nor juridical, and semantic. The number of concepts is, however, a\nmatter of interpretation since it is possible to split up the\njuridical category of probability\n further.[12] \nThe use of probability-related terms was almost certainly wider than\nthe concepts of probability listed above suggest. In philosophical and\ntheological debates, as well as in the regulation of action,\nprobabilis could be used as a predicate for the argumentative\nsupport which a proposition had (translatable as\n“plausible” or “rationally tenable”). In the\nearly modern era, this aspect of medieval probability became\nexplicitly integrated into the definition of a probable opinion\n(Knebel 2000; Maryks 2008; Schuessler 2019; Tutino 2018). It\nwas not, however, expressly addressed in medieval and, in particular,\nscholastic characterizations of probability. Here, the focus will be\non such characterizations in medieval sources.  \nThe most prominent scholastic understanding of probability derived\nfrom Aristotle’s notion of endoxon, which shaped the\nconcept of “probable opinion” (opinio\nprobabilis). Aristotle defines endoxon in\nTopics I, 100b20 as: \n[T]hose opinions are reputable [endoxa] which are accepted by\neveryone or by the majority or by the wise – i.e., by all, or by\nthe majority, or by the most notable and reputable of them. \nBoethius and medieval commentators on the Topics translated\nendoxa as probabilia (“probable things”)\nor opiniones probabiles (“probable opinions”). In\nlight of the rise of Aristotelianism, it is thus unsurprising that\nThomas Aquinas and other scholastics turned to this understanding of\nprobability when they discussed conclusions from uncertain\n premises:[13] \n[P]ropositions are called probable because they are more known to the\nwise or to the multitude. (Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on the\nPosterior Analytics, I.8.35) \nMany scholastic characterizations or definitions of probability\ncontain an explicit reference to Topics I, such as this one\nby Gregory of Rimini: \nMoreover, since “probable things” mean “what appears\ntrue to the many or the wise” according to the Philosopher\n[i.e., Aristotle] in Topics I, which also agrees with\nAugustine’s Contra Cresconium, Book III, where he says\nthat things are called probable because “they are endorsed, that\nis, approved and believed”, [to which] add “to be\ntrue”, it follows that approbation by the authority of the wise\nof this world is a reason which generates probability (ratio\n probabilis).[14] \nAs this quotation shows, Augustine’s understanding of\nprobability was thought to coincide with Aristotle’s, a fact\nthat must have buttressed the endoxic notion of probability. Yet,\nwhile Augustine is not often referred to in medieval definitions of\nprobability, a reference to Topics I became a\ncommonplace. It seems immediately clear why an endoxic understanding\nof probabilis led to the modern translations\n“reputable”, “plausible”,\n“believable”, “approvable”, or\n“approved”. Reputability and approval, however, are not\nnecessarily indicators of truth, and therefore the role that\nendoxa played for Aristotle and for the scholastics needs\nclarification. \nEndoxa were important for ancient rhetoric and dialectic.\nRhetoric aims at persuasion, and opinions which are generally accepted\nor backed up by the intellectual reputation of their sources tend to\nbe persuasive. In rhetorical usage, therefore, endoxon and\nprobabilis can be equated to a proposition with\n“expected persuasiveness”. Dialectic is concerned with\ndisputes and inquiry through the exchange of arguments.\nEndoxa, in ancient dialectic, were starting, intermediate,\nand often also endpoints of such activities; and, to this extent, they\nmight be seen as instruments for intellectual training. This, however,\nwould create the wrong impression of the overall role of\nendoxa in Aristotle’s methodology of the sciences\n(Haskins 2004; Kraut 2006; Renon 1998). He also takes them to be\nreasonable starting points for scientific inquiry, as well as material\nfor testing its results. The process of inquiry should select the\nright endoxa and order them systematically. In this respect,\nthe connection between likely truth and being held true by many or\nwise people is presumed by Aristotle. There is no guarantee, however,\nthat an endoxon is true, which makes it an apt object of\ninquiry. \nScholastic usage of opinio probabilis conformed less to the\nrhetorical and more to the dialectical and methodological roles of\nendoxa (see also Section 4.1) – even if the opinions in\nquestion were applied in oratory and preaching. A scholastic author,\nin particular from the thirteenth century onward, who called a\nphilosophical position or a theological claim probable alluded to an\nepistemic quality which justified serious consideration over and above\na proposition’s suitability for inducing agreement in hearers.\nSensory perception is sometimes mentioned as a basis for probable\nopinions which are held by all people (“Snow is\n white”).[15]Apparently,\n the opinions of the uneducated (rudes) and laymen\n(idiotae) did not qualify as probable, unless they were\nobservation statements, for which uneducated people had as much\ncompetence as the educated. Competence in judging a matter was\ntherefore the key to scholastic ascriptions of probability. The\ncategory of the “wisest” in medieval definitions of\nprobability was a stand-in for “expert”, including\ntop-ranking lawyers, theologians, medical doctors and philosophers\n– or even architects, engineers and other virtuosi of\nmechanical arts (as in Boethius’s definition of probable\nopinion). This expert status was acquired through training in a\nuniversity or with a master. Moreover, an expert counted as such only\nin his field of\n expertise.[16]\n The sapientes to which the definition of probable opinion\nrefers nevertheless had to possess at least some positive\nnon-epistemic traits: they had to be decent (probus) and\ntrustworthy people in order to possess weighty opinions.  \nThe role of authority in the endoxic definition of probability has\nbeen widely discussed and\n criticized.[17]\n Although the word auctoritas does not occur regularly in\ndefinitions of “the probable”, it seems indisputable that\nthese definitions refer to authority as the basis of probability. The\nauthority in question is, in principle, intellectual or epistemic\n(based on expertise); but the distinction between epistemic and\nhierarchical authority was always blurry, and the latter could (and\noften did) prevail in practice. Given the dismal training of parish\npriests, this was surely often the case because the uneducated were\ncalled on to accept the opinions of their parish priest or confessor\n(Thomas Aquinas, Quodlibetales, III, q. 4, 2, 47; and\nAntoninus, Summa, I, 3, 10, 64). Moreover, scholastic\nreliance on institutional indicators for competence may have impeded a\nclear distinction between epistemic and hierarchical authority, since\nepistemic authority was to some extent tied to hierarchical success in\nacademia. Students, for instance, were prima facie expected to believe\nthe opinions of their professors (i.e., masters).  \nThe distinction between hierarchical and epistemic authority should\nnot be confused with the distinction between external and internal\nreasons for holding a proposition true. Endoxic probability seems to\nbe entirely based on the opinions of others and thus on external (or\nindirect) reasons for holding a proposition true. (Internal or direct\nreasons are those a person herself can assess.) Yet some difficulties\nwith the view that medieval probability was wholly external and thus\nauthority-based deserve to be addressed. Endoxic probability was not\nthe only concept of probability in medieval scholasticism, and others\nwere (as we shall see) more open to internal reasons. Moreover, an\nexpert might claim probability for his own judgment – something\nnot excluded by the definition of endoxon. Nevertheless,\nagents were often asked to conform to the opinion of a qualified\nmajority (“the larger and more reasonable part”, maior\net sanior pars) of competent\n evaluators.[18]\n This requirement shows that the endoxic understanding of probable\nopinions was indeed skewed towards external\n authority.[19] \nHacking (1975) famously claimed that frequentist conceptions of\nprobability largely arose as a side-product of the seventeenth century\nrevolution in probability. Historians of ideas quickly identified the\nweaknesses in Hacking’s thesis (Brown 1987; Daston 1988; Garber\nand Zabell 1979). An understanding of probability as what happens most\nof the time or for the most part (hōs epi to polu) can\nalready be found in Aristotle and the scholastics. The frequentist\nnotion of probability therefore seems to possess a long pre-modern\n history.[20]\n Unfortunately, things are far more complicated. Modern frequentism\narose as a complex of ideas in the nineteenth century, perhaps\nevolving only in the twentieth century into a full-fledged conception\nof probability (Gillies 2000, 88–113). Hence, early modern uses\n(such as Jacob Bernoulli’s) of the relative frequency of\noccurrences in a sequence of events are not yet frequentist in the\nmodern sense. Medieval (and ancient) uses of ut frequenter\nconsiderations differ, in turn, from early modern (proto-)frequentism\n(see Schuessler 2019, chap. 12). Having made this point, in\nwhat follows, proto-frequentism will be used without the qualification\n“medieval”. \nAs has been shown, medieval readers could have gleaned frequentist\nideas from Cicero even before the rise of Aristotelianism in the\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries. Cicero stipulates that\nprobabilis can mean “for the most part”, and\nmedieval authors who followed him therefore held a proto-frequentist\nconception of probability. Later on, such a conception was often\nderived from the works of Aristotle. Did this make any difference? Let\nus look at four examples: \nPassage (i) should not be understood as granting probable certainty\n(certitudo probabilis) whenever a person is more often right\nthan wrong. The few exceptions mentioned ought to be really\nexceptional in order to allow for a probable certainty, which was\ndeemed sufficient for blameless moral action. Probable certainty was\nthus a threshold rather than a frequency concept. \nPassage (ii) refers to the high likelihood that at least some among a\nlarge number of people will possess a desired trait. This is a\nproto-statistical statement, but it does not show that probability\nmeans frequent occurrence. The claim that, among a large\nnumber of people, some will have a rare trait can easily be believed\n– depending on the trait in question – by a multitude or\nby “the wise”. Consequently, ut in pluribus\nclaims might often have been indicators of endoxic probability rather\nthan expressions of an independent concept of probability. \nPassage (iii) postulates a natural regularity. Sexual conception\nusually results in “perfect” (as opposed to deformed or\n“monstrous”) offspring. This ut in pluribus claim\nrefers to a majority of occurrences, but its background in\nAristotelian natural philosophy is significant. Scholars debate\nwhether Aristotle’s understanding of “for the most\npart” judgments is equivalent to a frequentist concept of\nprobability (Judson 1991; Kraut 2006; Winter 1997). Aristotelian\n“for the most part” judgments imply much more in terms of\nlaw-like or natural connections than can be captured by mere reference\nto relative frequencies. It is therefore plausible to assume the same\nfor medieval Aristotelians, in particular for those who wrote about\nnatural processes. \nPassage (iv) is probably closest to implicit statistical reasoning and\nrefers, not by chance, to an economic context. The passage quoted\ndeals with fairness requirements between buyers and sellers of life\nannuities. A lump sum payment of a buyer and his or her (widows liked\nto buy annuities) uncertain stream of income require an equitable\nbalance. The uncertainty or risk in question pertains to the possible\ndeath of the owner of an annuity; and it is claimed that persons who\nare 25 years old will probably live more than eight further years. It\nmay be apt to speak in this case of a probability of more than 0.5 for\nfurther survival. Medieval considerations concerning insurance or\nannuities show that numerical probability was never too far away,\nwhich adds to our amazement that this step did not occur before the\nseventeenth century. Passage (iv), however, contains two\nprobability-related terms: the buyer is favored by what occurs more\noften (frequentius) and is more probable\n(probabilius). Kantola assumes that the words\nfrequentius and probabilius are synonymous here, as\nin several other cases in which they occur\n together.[23]\n Yet why would scholastic authors repeat two synonymous words if one\nwould do? The combined use of “frequent” and\n“probable” often occurs in matter of fact contexts (as in\nour example) which require no rhetorical flourishes. There is no\napparent need for emphasis through a repetition of synonyms. A\nplausible answer is that the two terms are not, in fact, synonymous\nand that frequency justifies an ascription of probability, although\nprobability means something else. It would make sense to\ncombine both terms precisely because frequency justifies a probability\nascription in the given case, but only probability confers legitimacy\non actions or contracts. In short, frequent occurrence might only have\nserved as indicator of endoxic probability for medieval scholastics.\nThe frequency of events may have prima facie justified the assumption\nthat everyone, a majority or the experts will believe that the events\nin question will occur. \nShould proto-frequentism therefore be dropped as a genuine concept of\nprobability? This step would be premature as long as the\ninterpretation of medieval ut frequenter statements is still\nbeing debated. Continuity with ancient notions of probability also\nsuggests that we should tread carefully. For this reason,\nproto-frequentism is included here among the medieval concepts of\nprobability. \nTestimonial probability arises from the testimony of witnesses. It is\none of the two kinds of probability which Silvester de Prierio listed\nin his Summa summarum (the other is endoxic probability):\n“‘Probable’ is used in two ways. First as the\nopposite of hidden, that is, what is proved by witnesses\n …”[24]\n The rapid growth of jurisprudence after the twelfth century nourished\na great interest in witness\n testimony.[25]\n It was very difficult to rely on circumstantial evidence in medieval\njurisprudence; so the testimony of witnesses was in many ways the key\nto a court decision. A complicated system of “half proofs”\nand proofs was designed to safe-guard the rationality of juridical\nprocedures (Evans 2002; Franklin 2001, 15; Rosoni 1995, 89). Moreover,\neven outside the narrow confines of jurisprudence, witness testimony\nplayed an important role. Thomas Aquinas, for instance, described a\ncertainty sufficient for action: \nAnd yet the fact that in so many it is not possible to have certitude\nwithout fear of error is no reason why we should reject the certitude\nwhich can probably be had [quae probabiliter haberi potest]\nthrough two or three witnesses … (Thomas Aquinas, Summa\ntheologiae, II-II, q. 70, 2, 1488) \nThomas’s remark alludes to the norm that the testimony of one\neye-witness confers probability on an assertion, whereas the\n(uncontested) testimony of two or more witnesses creates probable\ncertainty. \nA related but wider field for using the predicate\n“probable” in juridical terminology was the classification\nof presumptions. A “probable presumption” (probabilis\npresumptio) had some force in inclining a judge towards or\nagainst a verdict (Hubert 2009; Motzenbäcker 1958, 120, 159).\nMoreover, witness testimony was just one kind of evidence which could\nrender a presumption probable. Probability could also result from\n“truth-like circumstantial evidence” (indicia\nverisimilia), as this statement from Huguccio documents:\n“Probable is what is accepted because of common human opinion or\ntruth-like circumstantial evidence\n (indicia).”[26]\n Huguccio’s reference to common opinion shows that endoxic\nprobability was also relevant in the law\n courts.[27]\n Nevertheless, the treatment of signs and indicia as\nprobability generating evidence, which was strongly promoted by\nscholastic jurists, created an important precedent for connecting the\nnotion of probability to the direct evidence of an observer. \nAristotle tied the notion of probability to questions of necessity and\ncontingency. The probable did not follow with necessity but only\ncontingently (and for the most part) from the nature of things. In\nmedieval scholasticism, this connection was often stated in semantic\nterms. Boethius of Dacia called probability: “a property which\ndisposes (habilitans) but does not necessitate a subject to\nthe partaking of a\n predicate”.[28]\n Probability is here a degree of participation of a predicate in a\nsubject. Full participation under all conditions stands for necessity;\nparticipation under most conditions (for the most part) leads to\nprobability. The semantic notion of probability as conditioned\nparticipation of a predicate in a subject is thus closely related to\nthe proto-frequentist interpretation discussed above. It is, however,\nformally distinct as a notion of probability, not least because some\nscholastics addressed it as such. Peter Richeri, Topica\nAristotelis (A. 37), I q. 2, 117ra–118ra,\nreferred to Boethius (the ancient one, not the medieval philosopher of\nDacia) in this context: \nYet Boethius defines probable things differently in his\nTopics I: probable things are those to which the mind readily\nacquiesces, although it does not possess a firmness of truth in them,\nas in this proposition: “If she is a mother, she loves [her\nchild].” With respect to this explication, it should moreover be\nknown that a proposition is called probable when its subject contains\na property which disposes, but does not necessitate, it to partake of\nthe predicate\n ….[29] \nThe semantic relation to which Richeri refers is not explicit in\nBoethius’s definition. What mainly matters here, however, is\nRicheri’s use of a semantic notion of probability. Albert of\nCologne displays the same notion in connection with a perception-based\nexplanation; such propositions are held true by everyone, the most, or\nthe\n wise.[30]\n The less sense-based and the more intellectual a perception is the\nmore is it restricted to the wise and the thoughtful, according to\nAlbert. Interestingly, he acknowledges Arabic sources for this view\n(Albert Logica, I, 1, 2, 241; Bach 1881; Cortabarria Beita\n1953). He does not mention a specific source, but this hint uncovers\nan important connection indicating that medieval Islamic philosophy,\ntheology, and law were no less based on probability than their\nChristian counterparts (Black 1990, 108; Daiber 1990, 218; Miller\n1984, 55). \nSyllogisms are patterns of logical argumentation. A syllogism with\nmerely probable premises was called dialectical in medieval and\nRenaissance philosophy. Since dialectic was the “art of rational\ndisputation” or “controversial inquiry” (ars\ndisserendi), and disputation was a characteristic activity of\nuniversities in the Middle Ages, argumentation with probable\npropositions possessed an enormous significance for medieval thought.\nIt is also characteristic of logic-fed scholasticism that probable\nreasoning was mainly conceived as logical deduction from probable\n premises.[31]\n After the rise of Aristotelianism, these premises were mostly framed\nas endoxa. Thomas Aquinas writes: \nThe dialectician is concerned only with proceeding from propositions\nwhich are as acceptable as possible. These are propositions which seem\ntrue to most people and especially to the wise. (Thomas Aquinas,\nPosterior Analytics, I, 31, 3, 142) \nIt is not, however, clear whether authors who summarily refer to\nprobable premises only intend endoxa in their definitions of\ndialectical syllogism, or whether they operate, like Albert of\nCologne, with a broader notion of probable premise. Albert\n(Logica, I, 4, 2, 278) speaks with respect to the dialectical\nsyllogism about premises which are always or most often (in\npluribus) true. There was also some discussion about the\nepistemic status of the argumentative scheme of the dialectical\nsyllogism and the conclusions from probable premises. The common\nassumption was that the dialectic syllogism is an indubitably valid\ndeductive scheme, but that probable premises produce only probable\nconclusions or opinions (Buridan, Quaestiones, 19; Buridan,\nSummulae, 347). \nOckham offers some remarkable comments in Summa logicae\nIII.1.1 concerning probability in the dialectical\n syllogism.[32]\n Like many others, Ockham assumes that the dialectical syllogism\nstarts from merely probable propositions (probabilia), which\nhe characterizes as endoxa. Yet he then claims that probable\npropositions are true and necessary, even though they are not per se\nor derivatively known to be true with certainty (probabilia sunt\nilla, quae cum sint vera et necesseria, non tamen per se nota, nec ex\nper se notis syllogizabilia, nec etiam per experientiam evidenter\nnota, nec ex talibus sequentia). Probability, thus, hinges on an\nepistemically deficient state of an observer. However, a dialectical\nsyllogism need not produce uncertainty in an observer since it need\nnot produce fear of error but can instead engender firm conviction in\nits\n conclusion.[33]\n Ockham deviates here from some familiar scholastic assumptions\nconcerning probability. His probabilia cannot be probable\nopinions in the third sense of Grosseteste (see above), which are by\ndefinition contingent. The conclusion of a dialectical syllogism is\nalso not necessarily a probable opinion because then it would be\naccompanied by fear of error. This cluster of sentences is\nnevertheless all Ockham has to say about probability in the Summa\nlogicae (and Burley, Buridan, and others say even less in their\nlogical works). No deeper analysis concerning the role of\nprobabilia in his philosophy or theology ensues, and his\nuncommon remarks apparently did not spark any discussion by\n others.[34]\n Elsewhere in his work, Ockham judges specific philosophical theses to\nbe probable or more probable in the same way as other scholastic\nauthors did. If his short comments on probabilia in the\nSumma logicae offer a glimpse of the deeper modal and\nontological ramifications of probability, they also document that\nthese ramifications were hardly pursued by medieval\n scholastics.[35] \nHowever important dialectical syllogisms may have been for medieval\ndisputation, it should also be recognized that action-planning in\nconscience was conceived as deduction from (partly) probable premises.\nThe dialectical syllogism therefore provided a logical basis for moral\ndecisions and served as a tool for moral theology. \nThe humanist dialectic of the Renaissance shared many assumptions\nconcerning the dialectical syllogism with the scholastics, but some\nauthors developed a different understanding of dialectic. These\ndevelopments will be discussed in Section 5. \nPre-modern probability was not a number or ratio, but mainly a binary\nproperty which a proposition either had or did not have. Yet\npre-modern probability was also an ordinal concept. Some propositions\nwere regarded as more probable (probabilior,\nprobabilius) than others. More probable opinions were a\nsubclass of probable opinions. Consequently, an opinion had at least\nto be probable in order to be more probable than another opinion. In\nline with these premises, strict order relations (i.e.\n“>” and “<”) for opinions were common in\nmedieval and Renaissance philosophy. Interestingly, ascriptions of\nequal probability seem to be rare before the sixteenth century (see\nSchuessler 2016). An equal balance of reasons gave rise to doubt\n(dubium). The moral rules for decisions in doubt, however,\nwere different from those for the choice between probable opinions.\nHence, doubt should not straightforwardly be equated with equal\nprobability, in particular in medieval scholasticism. Further research\nis needed to uncover the role of equi-probability in the period\n1200–1500; until then, we can only be sure that in this period\nthe possibility of a strict ordering was envisaged for\nprobabilities. \nScholastic authors often ascribed probability at the same time to a\nproposition and its negation or to a proposition and a\ncounter-proposition which was logically incompatible with it. A\nproposition could even be regarded as more probable\n(probabilior) without its negation losing probability. In\nfact, calling an opinion more probable than another regularly implied\nthat the other was also probable, because comparison and choice\nbetween probable alternatives was intended. \nFor some modern commentators, this impugns an understanding of\n“probable” as readily affirmable or adoptable. It seems to\nbe a minimum requirement of being affirmable that a proposition\nx is judged to be more likely true than false, that is,\nhaving probability p(x) > 0.5. Since a proposition and\nits negation cannot both have p > 0.5, they cannot both be\naffirmable at the same time. The scholastics, of course, did not\noperate with such numerical considerations. For them,\n“both-sided probability” (as I have termed it) resulted\nnaturally from the endoxic concept of probability. A proposition and\nits negation can both be held true at the same time by different\n experts.[36] \nIt is not possible, of course, to assume both-sided probability based\non a proto-frequentist or semantic understanding of probability.\nContradictory sentences cannot both be most often true. Yet this\nproblem did not impugn medieval ascriptions of both-sided probability\nin academic debates or in the practice of the confessional, which\nusually explicitly or implicitly proceeded on the basis of the endoxic\nunderstanding of probability. \nThere are two different ways in which an evaluator can consider a\nproposition as more probable and a counter-proposition as probable at\nthe same time. First, the evaluator can believe that more and/or\nbetter experts hold x true than y, although\ny is approved by a sufficient number of experts to count as\n probable.[37]\n Second, the evaluator may consider a proposition as more probable\naccording to her own weighing up of the reasons, while the\ncounter-proposition is considered probable because it is the opinion\nof many or weighty\n experts.[38]\n Both options show that there is no obvious logical problem with the\nassumption that two incompatible propositions can both be regarded as\nrationally\n affirmable.[39]\n This does not, however, invalidate the claim that only one of the\npropositions can be rationally affirmed at a given time and by a given\nperson from her own standpoint. The person in question can, it seems,\nonly rationally affirm what she regards as more probable than its\nnegation. Consequently, regarding a rival opinion as probable means\nconsidering it as affirmable by others – or, in modern\nterminology, by one’s epistemic\n peers.[40]\n This insight is an important step towards opinion pluralism and the\nconceptualization of reasonable disagreement, and it is significant\nthat it is in nuce implied in the both-sided probability of\nmedieval scholastics. \nThe epistemological difficulties of both-sided probability (and of\nreasonable disagreement between competent reasoners) were not,\nhowever, analyzed in depth by medieval scholastics. Nor did they\ninvestigate how an epistemology of acceptance of probable opinions as\npremises for action differs from one which assumes assent or\naffirmation of the opinions in question. All this happened much later\nin the scholastic tradition, in the seventeenth century; but this is\nanother story (Deman 1936; Fleming 2006; Gay 2012; Knebel 2000;\nSchuessler 2019; Schwartz 2019; Tutino 2018). The developments\nin question were linked to the rise of a new scholastic doctrine\ncalled probabilism in the seventeenth century. Probabilism, as\nunderstood at the time (the modern understanding of the term is quite\ndifferent), legitimizes a specific way of using probable\n opinions.[41]\n It is not synonymous with any kind of probabilistic\nreasoning. However, we need not deal with scholastic probabilism any\nfurther because the doctrine did not exist in the period now under\nconsideration. It is sometimes attributed to medieval authors, but\nsuch ascriptions should be contested and, in any case, should not be\naccepted without deeper discussion for authors who wrote before\n1500. \nThe question of whether medieval forms of probability were subjective\nor objective has long puzzled modern researchers (Kantola 1994). It is\ndifficult to come up with an answer, not least because medieval\nauthors did not employ the (characteristically modern) terminology of\nsubjectivity and objectivity with respect to judgments of\n probability.[42]\n Nevertheless, the discussion above of medieval uses of\nprobability-related terms sheds some light on matters of subjectivity\nand objectivity. \nAs has been shown, probabilis or verisimilis were\npredicates for the qualitative support a body of evidence gave to the\ntruth of a proposition or the fittingness of a sign. We have already\nseen what kinds of evidence for probability were accepted at the time.\nA subjective aspect of probability ascriptions thus consisted in a\nbelief obtained by the supporting relationship in a particular case.\nAn objective aspect depended on the actual existence of the supporting\nbasis. \nThis kind of objectivity does not make probability a feature of the\nworld or a theoretical construct based on facts of nature. Such\nstronger forms of objectivity underlie, for instance, a true\nproto-frequentist understanding of\n probability.[43]\n If probability means “what frequently happens”,\nprobability will often derive from objective features of the world. If\nfrequent occurrence of x is only an indicator for the\naffirmability of sentences about x, medieval\nproto-frequentist probability is not strongly objective in this way.\nNevertheless, at least the medieval semantic notion of probability\nseems to be objective in the strong sense. A proposition, the\npredicate of which mostly inheres in its subject, is at least in some\ncases objectively probable on ontological grounds from a scholastic\npoint of view. Facts of nature determine the degree to which\npredicates inhere in a subject, so that it becomes objectively\nprobable that a mother loves her child. \nMoreover, medieval probability ascriptions were in significant\nrespects inter-subjectively testable – and it is characteristic\nof scholasticism to assume that communities are in a position to\nassess individual claims of\n rationality.[44]\n Propositions can be identified as semantically probable through the\ncommon use of terms. A communitarian basis also existed for the\nendoxic notion of probability, which in principle derives from\nobservable majorities or a shared ascription of wisdom or expertise.\nEndoxic probability could thus become an instrument of social (and\nmoral) control. Yet, although collective control of endoxic\nprobability ascriptions may have existed, it was never absolute in the\nperiod under discussion. Often, no consensus concerning the relative\nweight of experts existed; and it therefore remained contentious which\nside was “larger and more reasonable” (maior et\nsanior) or even whether a proposition was supported by enough\nleading experts to count as probable. On these grounds, some\nperspectival variation became possible. Walter Burley wrote that a\nthing can be probable to one person and improbable to\n another.[45]\n This statement shows that a limited multi-perspectival variety of\nprobability ascriptions was acknowledged in the late Middle Ages.  \nThe Renaissance is considered here as a cultural movement which\nbridged two historical epochs, the Middle Ages and early modernity.\nThere is notorious disagreement on the temporal boundaries of the\nRenaissance. One familiar view is that it covers the period from the\nmiddle of the fourteenth century to the end of the sixteenth. The\nRenaissance is closely linked to the rise of humanism as a style of\nthought, and humanism is often conceived of as a rival and antagonist\nof scholasticism. Recent scholarship has found less clear-cut\nboundaries between humanism and scholasticism than were formerly\nassumed, and this is also true for humanist and scholastic uses of\nprobability-related terms. The whole range of Latin\nprobability-related words was used by Renaissance humanists and\nmedieval scholastics alike, with roughly similar meanings based on\nancient precedent. In the period from 1200–1500, there were no\ngreat debates on probability; and what Renaissance authors, like their\ncontemporaries, had to say about the subject fills a few lines at most\nin their works. Nonetheless, the differences between humanist and\nscholastic uses of probability should be noted.  \nHumanist concern with probability was largely stimulated by attempts\nto clarify the relationship between rhetoric and dialectic. A second,\nbut related, field in which probability-terms became important for\nhumanists was the translation, recovery, and interpretation of ancient\ntexts, such as Aristotle’s Topics or Quintilian’s\nInstitutio oratoria. Yet the renewed attention to the texts\nof Cicero and Quintilian, or those of Aristotle’s Greek\ncommentators, in the fifteenth century does not seem to have produced\nan immediate challenge to scholastic usages of probability. In\ngeneral, the terms probabilis or probabilitas appear\nto have been less central for humanists than for scholastic (moral)\ntheology and jurisprudence. Many humanists prolifically used the word\nprobabilis, but some shunned it and spoke instead of\nworthiness of belief (credibilitas). This may often signal\nnot much more than a predilection for the Latin of some ancient\nauthor. A contrast to scholastic usage can at best be expected from\nauthors who intended to make a break with scholastic dialectic such as\nLorenzo Valla and Rudolph Agricola (Mack 1993, 31, 146; Nauta 2009,\n233; Spranzi-Zuber 2011, 65). \nLorenzo Valla (Repastinatio, 253) attacked scholastic\ndialectic, referring to worthiness of belief and belief-worthy things\n(credibilia) rather than to probability and\nprobabilia. He follows Quintilian’s (the complete text\nof the Institutio oratoria was rediscovered in the\nLatin West in 1416) division of belief-worthiness into very firm\n(firmissimum), strongly disposed (propensius), and\nnot ill-disposed (non\n repugnans).[46]\n Credibility and truth-likeness are also related to the modal category\nof possibility. Valla assumes degrees of possibility. Something can be\nvery or slightly possible. Only propositions qualified as very\npossible were worthy of belief and truth-like (verisimilis).\nIn this context, Valla never once uses the word probabilis.\nBut he approvingly quotes Cicero’s connection of argumentation\nwith probable (probabilis) invention in Book 3 of his\nRepastinatio dialecticae, where he gets down to dialectic and\nlogic after much previous analysis of language. On the whole,\nValla’s probability-related concepts do not seem to differ too\nstarkly from the semantic and proto-frequentist notions of probability\n(or belief-worthiness) which he shared with the scholastics.  \nRudolph Agricola, another humanist innovator, put the word\nprobabilis center stage in his path-breaking reinterpretation\nof dialectic. For him, dialectic was the art of speaking with\nprobability on whatever issue. This definition appears traditional\nenough, but Agricola (De inventione dialectica, 210)\nexplicitly distanced himself from Aristotle’s endoxon\nas the basis for probability in dialectic. As has been noted by modern\nscholars, “speaking with probability” is a feature of a\nprocess for Agricola rather than one grounded in a property of\npropositions used in a dialectical syllogism. Probability arises from\nthe argumentative quality (argumentosus), aptness\n(aptus), and fittingness (consentaneus) of a\nreasoning process (Agricola, De inventione dialectica, 210,\n306; Mack 1993, 170; Spranzi-Zuber 2011, 89). This directs dialectic\naway from the reliance on authority implied by Aristotle’s\ndefinition of reputable opinion. It is also significant that Valla and\nAgricola focus on the production of conviction (fides)\ninstead of mere opinion. They thus seem to call for more rhetorical\npersuasion or for higher epistemological standards in\ndialectic’s quest for truth. It is difficult, however, to\ndevelop an uncontentious interpretation of what Agricola exactly meant\nby his peculiar, but undoubtedly influential, view of probability. In\nsixteenth-century century humanist discourse on probability,\nAgricola’s dialectic was a key innovation, as were the new\ninterest in Aristotle’s Topics, the rise of a\nProtestant tradition of dialectic, and much more. Together with\nadvancements in early modern scholasticism, these developments provide\na justification for ending the present survey around 1500. \nMedieval and Renaissance notions of probability largely derived from\nthe same ancient sources and remained related to each other through\ninterchanges between scholastics and humanists. Yet soon after 1500,\npre-modern probability discourse began to assume a new shape. Although\nthe many differences between medieval and early modern scholastic and\nhumanist uses of “the probable” cannot be summarized here,\nthey should not be underestimated. Above all, at the end of the\nsixteenth century, the Aristotelian endoxon gave way in moral\ntheology to a two-tiered definition of probability as either intrinsic\n(based on known reasons) or extrinsic (based on the opinions of\nothers). How much such innovations fostered the rise of numerical\nprobability in the middle of the seventeenth century is still largely\nan open question. Knebel (2000) and Schuessler (2019) show that\nit is reasonable to assume a significant contribution by early modern\nscholasticism. Maryks (2008) claims that the humanist precedent\nprompted the Jesuits to introduce the distinction between internal and\nexternal probability. At present, however, the cross-pollinations\nbetween early modern humanism and scholasticism are scarcely better\nunderstood than the developments leading to the invention of numerical\nprobability. \nIn any case, the notions of probability of many philosophers, from\nDescartes and Locke to Kant, recognizably rely on a stock of meanings\nwith roots in Renaissance humanism and medieval scholasticism. The\nphilosophers in question deviated notably from this stock, but so did\ntheir scholastic contemporaries. The modernization of probability\ntherefore occurred along a broad front of schools, trends and\ntraditions in the seventeenth century. It is instructive to relate the\nfour medieval concepts of probability listed above to their modern\nsuccessors. On the modern side, three major groups of interpretations\nor concepts of probability have emerged (Hájek 2011): \nThe first category mainly contains classical and logical concepts of\n probability.[47]\n Classical concepts define probability through the equal possibility\nof states of affairs. Logical concepts focus on evidential support for\nthe truth of propositions. The most prominent variants of the second\ncategory are Bayesian theories of probability and mathematical\nrepresentations of subjective expectation. The last category comprises\nfrequentist and propensity interpretations of\n probability.[48]\n For frequentists, probability is the limit of a relative frequency in\na series of events; for the propensity view, it is an irreducible\nfeature of the physical world. \nMedieval notions of probability exhibit parallels to all modern groups\nof probability concepts. Endoxic and juridical probability are species\nof quasi-logical probability because they arise from evidential\nsupport for holding a proposition true. Endoxa, that is,\nprobable opinions of others, are evidence for holding a proposition\ntrue. The witness testimony and indicia of juridical notions\nof probability are also, of course, kinds of evidence. The second\ncategory of modern interpretations of probability is related to\nmedieval probability understood as a specific amount of confidence in\nthe truth of a proposition. It is the confidence that characterizes\nopinions as the lowest rank of an epistemological order leading via\nfides (standing for fully confident belief or faith) to\nknowledge. Finally, probability is a feature of the world in modern\npropensity views, as well as for the medieval semantic notion of\nprobability. Whether this also holds for proto-frequentist probability\nis, as indicated, a matter of interpretation. \nConspicuously lacking in the period from 1200–1500 is an\nancestor of the “classical” notion of probability,\ngrounded on the equal possibility of events. This, then, seems to be a\ngenuinely modern interpretation of\n probability.[49]","contact.mail":"rudolf.schuessler@uni-bayreuth.de","contact.domain":"uni-bayreuth.de"}]
