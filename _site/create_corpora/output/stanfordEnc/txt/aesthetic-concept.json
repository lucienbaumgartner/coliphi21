For the\nmost part, aesthetic theories have divided over\nquestions particular to one or another of these designations:\nwhether artworks are necessarily aesthetic objects; how to square the\nallegedly perceptual basis of aesthetic judgments with the fact that\nwe give reasons in support of them; how best to capture the elusive\ncontrast between an aesthetic attitude and a practical one; whether to\ndefine aesthetic experience according to its phenomenological or\nrepresentational content; how best to understand the relation between\naesthetic value and aesthetic experience. But questions of\nmore general nature have lately arisen, and these have tended\nto have a skeptical cast: whether any use of ‘aesthetic’\nmay be explicated without appeal to some other; whether agreement\nrespecting any use is sufficient to ground meaningful theoretical\nagreement or disagreement; whether the term ultimately answers to any\nlegitimate philosophical purpose that justifies its inclusion in the\nlexicon. The skepticism expressed by such general questions did not\nbegin to take hold until the later part of the 20th century, and this\nfact prompts the question whether (a) the concept of the aesthetic is\ninherently problematic and it is only recently that we have managed to\nsee that it is, or (b) the concept is fine and it is only recently\nthat we have become muddled enough to imagine otherwise. Adjudicating\nbetween these possibilities requires a vantage from which to take in\nboth early and late theorizing on aesthetic matters.\n\n\n\nThe concept of the aesthetic descends from the concept of taste. Why\nthe concept of taste commanded so much philosophical attention during\nthe 18th century is a complicated matter, but this much is clear:\nthe eighteenth-century theory of taste emerged, in part, as a\ncorrective to the rise of rationalism, particularly as applied to\nbeauty, and to the rise of egoism, particularly as applied to virtue.\nAgainst rationalism about beauty, the eighteenth-century theory of\ntaste held the judgment of beauty to be immediate; against egoism about\nvirtue, it held the pleasure of beauty to be disinterested. \n\nRationalism about beauty is the view that judgments of beauty are\njudgments of reason, i.e., that we judge things to be beautiful by\nreasoning it out, where reasoning it out typically involves inferring\nfrom principles or applying concepts. At the beginning of the\n18th century, rationalism about beauty had achieved dominance on\nthe continent, and was being pushed to new extremes by “les\ngéomètres,” a group of literary theorists who aimed\nto bring to literary criticism the mathematical rigor that Descartes\nhad brought to physics. As one such theorist put it: \n\nIt was against this, and against more moderate forms of rationalism\nabout beauty, that mainly British philosophers working mainly within an\nempiricist framework began to develop theories of taste. The\nfundamental idea behind any such theory—which we may call the\nimmediacy thesis—is that judgments of beauty are not (or at least\nnot canonically) mediated by inferences from principles or applications\nof concepts, but rather have all the immediacy of straightforwardly\nsensory judgments. It is the idea, in other words, that we do not\nreason to the conclusion that things are beautiful, but rather\n“taste” that they are. Here is an early expression of the\nthesis, from Jean-Baptiste Dubos’s Critical Reflections on\nPoetry, Painting, and Music, which first appeared in 1719: \n\nAnd here is a late expression, from Kant’s 1790 Critique\nof the Power of Judgment: \n\nBut the theory of taste would not have enjoyed its\neighteenth-century run, nor would it continue now to exert its\ninfluence, had it been without resources to counter an obvious\nrationalist objection. There is a wide difference—so goes the\nobjection—between judging the excellence of a ragout and judging\nthe excellence of a poem or a play. More often than not, poems and\nplays are objects of great complication. But taking in all that\ncomplication requires a lot of cognitive work, including the\napplication of concepts and the drawing of inferences. Judging the\nbeauty of poems and plays, then, is evidently not immediate and so\nevidently not a matter of taste. \n\nThe chief way of meeting this objection was first to distinguish\nbetween the act of grasping the object preparatory to judging it and\nthe act of judging the object once grasped, and then to allow the\nformer, but not the latter, to be as concept- and inference-mediated as\nany rationalist might wish. Here is Hume, with characteristic\nclarity: \n\nHume—like Shaftesbury and Hutcheson before him, and Reid after\nhim (Cooper 1711, 17, 231; Hutcheson 1725, 16–24; Reid 1785,\n760–761)—regarded the faculty of taste as a kind of\n“internal sense.” Unlike the five “external” or\n“direct” senses, an “internal” (or\n“reflex” or “secondary”) sense is one that\ndepends for its objects on the antecedent operation of some other\nmental faculty or faculties. Reid characterizes it as follows: \n\nBecause of the highly complex natures or structures of many\nbeautiful objects, there will have to be a role for reason in their\nperception. But perceiving the nature or structure of an object is one\nthing. Perceiving its beauty is another. \n\nEgoism about virtue is the view that to judge an action or trait\nvirtuous is to take pleasure in it because you believe it to serve\nsome interest of yours. Its central instance is the Hobbesian\nview—still very much on early eighteenth-century\nminds—that to judge an action or trait virtuous is to take\npleasure in it because you believe it to promote your safety. Against\nHobbesian egoism a number of British moralists—preeminently\nShaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume—argued that, while a judgment\nof virtue is a matter of taking pleasure in response to an action or\ntrait, the pleasure is disinterested, by which they meant that it is\nnot self-interested (Cooper 1711, 220–223; Hutcheson 1725, 9,\n25–26; Hume 1751, 218–232, 295–302). One argument\nwent roughly as follows. That we judge virtue by means of an immediate\nsensation of pleasure means that judgments of virtue are judgments of\ntaste, no less than judgments of beauty. But pleasure in the beautiful\nis not self-interested: we judge objects to be beautiful whether or\nnot we believe them to serve our interests. But if pleasure in the\nbeautiful is disinterested, there is no reason to think that pleasure\nin the virtuous cannot also be (Hutcheson 1725, 9–10). \n\nThe eighteenth-century view that judgments of virtue are judgments of\ntaste highlights a difference between the eighteenth-century concept\nof taste and our concept of the aesthetic, since for us the\nconcepts aesthetic and moral tend oppose one another\nsuch that a judgment’s falling under one typically precludes its\nfalling under the other. Kant is chiefly responsible for introducing\nthis difference. He brought the moral and the aesthetic into\nopposition by re-interpreting what we might call the disinterest\nthesis—the thesis that pleasure in the beautiful is\ndisinterested (though see Cooper 1711, 222 and Home 2005, 36–38\nfor anticipations of Kant’s re-interpretation). \n\nAccording to Kant, to say that a pleasure is interested is not to\nsay that it is self-interested in the Hobbesian sense, but rather that\nit stands in a certain relation to the faculty of desire. The pleasure\ninvolved in judging an action to be morally good is interested because\nsuch a judgment issues in a desire to bring the action into existence,\ni.e., to perform it. To judge an action to be morally good is to become\naware that one has a duty to perform the action, and to become so aware\nis to gain a desire to perform it. By contrast, the pleasure involved\nin judging an object to be beautiful is disinterested because such a\njudgment issues in no desire to do anything in particular. If we can be\nsaid to have a duty with regard to beautiful things, it appears to be\nexhausted in our judging them aesthetically to be beautiful. That is\nwhat Kant means when he says that the judgment of taste is not\npractical but rather “merely contemplative” (Kant 1790,\n95). \n\nBy thus re-orienting the notion of disinterest, Kant brought the\nconcept of taste into opposition with the concept of morality, and so\ninto line, more or less, with the present concept of the aesthetic. But\nif the Kantian concept of taste is continuous, more or less, with the\npresent-day concept of the aesthetic, why the terminological\ndiscontinuity? Why have we come to prefer the term\n‘aesthetic’ to the term ‘taste’? The not very\ninteresting answer appears to be that we have preferred an adjective to\na noun. The term ‘aesthetic’ derives from the Greek term\nfor sensory perception, and so preserves the implication of immediacy\ncarried by the term ‘taste.’ Kant employed both terms,\nthough not equivalently: according to his usage,\n‘aesthetic’ is broader, picking out a class of judgments\nthat includes both the normative judgment of taste and the\nnon-normative, though equally immediate, judgment of the agreeable.\nThough Kant was not the first modern to use ‘aesthetic’\n(Baumgarten had used it as early as 1735), the term became widespread\nonly, though quickly, after his employment of it in the third Critique.\nYet the employment that became widespread was not exactly Kant’s,\nbut a narrower one according to which ‘aesthetic’ simply\nfunctions as an adjective corresponding to the noun\n“taste.” So for example we find Coleridge, in 1821,\nexpressing the wish that he “could find a more familiar word than\naesthetic for works of taste and criticism,” before going on to\nargue: \n\nThe availability of an adjective corresponding to\n“taste” has allowed for the retiring of a series of awkward\nexpressions: the expressions “judgment of taste,”\n“emotion of taste” and “quality of taste” have\ngiven way to the arguably less offensive ‘aesthetic\njudgment,’ ‘aesthetic emotion,’ and ‘aesthetic\nquality.’ However, as the noun ‘taste’ phased out, we\nbecame saddled with other perhaps equally awkward expressions,\nincluding the one that names this entry. \n\nMuch of the history of more recent thinking about the concept of the\naesthetic can be seen as the history of the development of the\nimmediacy and disinterest theses. \n\nArtistic formalism is the view that the artistically relevant\nproperties of an artwork—the properties in virtue of which it is\nan artwork and in virtue of which it is a good or bad one—are\nformal merely, where formal properties are typically regarded as\nproperties graspable by sight or by hearing merely. Artistic formalism\nhas been taken to follow from both the immediacy and the disinterest\ntheses (Binkley 1970, 266–267; Carroll 2001, 20–40). If you take the\nimmediacy thesis to imply the artistic irrelevance of all properties\nwhose grasping requires the use of reason, and you include\nrepresentational properties in that class, then you are apt to think\nthat the immediacy thesis implies artistic formalism. If you take the\ndisinterest thesis to imply the artistic irrelevance of all properties\ncapable of practical import, and you include representational\nproperties in that class, then you are apt to think that the\ndisinterest thesis implies artistic formalism. \n\nThis is not to suggest that the popularity enjoyed by artistic\nformalism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries owed mainly to\nits inference from the immediacy or disinterest theses. The most\ninfluential advocates of formalism during this period were\nprofessional critics, and their formalism derived, at least in part,\nfrom the artistic developments with which they were concerned. As a\ncritic Eduard Hanslick advocated for the pure music of Mozart,\nBeethoven, Schumann, and later Brahms, and against the dramatically\nimpure music of Wagner; as a theorist he urged that music has no\ncontent but “tonally moving forms” (Hanslick 1986, 29). As\na critic Clive Bell was an early champion of the post-Impressionists,\nespecially Cezanne; as a theorist he maintained that the formal\nproperties of painting—“relations and combinations of\nlines and colours”—alone have artistic relevance (Bell\n1958, 17–18). As a critic Clement Greenberg was abstract\nexpressionism’s ablest defender; as a theorist he held painting’s\n“proper area of competence” to be exhausted by flatness,\npigment, and shape (Greenberg 1986, 86–87). \n\nNot every influential defender of formalism has also been a\nprofessional critic. Monroe Beardsley, who arguably gave formalism its\nmost sophisticated articulation, was not (Beardsley 1958). Nor is Nick\nZangwill, who recently has mounted a spirited and resourceful defense\nof a moderate version of formalism (Zangwill 2001). But formalism has\nalways been sufficiently motivated by art-critical data that once\nArthur Danto made the case that the data no longer supported it, and\nperhaps never really had, formalism’s heyday came to an end.\nInspired in particular by Warhol’s Brillo Boxes, which\nare (more or less) perceptually indistinguishable from the\nbrand-printed cartons in which boxes of Brillo were delivered to\nsupermarkets, Danto observed that for most any artwork it is possible\nto imagine both (a) another object that is perceptually indiscernible\nfrom it but which is not an artwork, and (b) another artwork that is\nperceptually indiscernible from it but which differs in artistic value.\nFrom these observations he concluded that form alone neither makes an\nartwork nor gives it whatever value it has (Danto 1981, 94–95; Danto\n1986, 30–31; Danto 1997, 91). \n\nBut Danto has taken the possibility of such perceptual indiscernibles\nto show the limitations not merely of form but also of aesthetics, and\nhe has done so on the grounds, apparently, that the formal and the\naesthetic are co-extensive. Regarding a urinal Duchamp once exhibited\nand a perceptual indiscernible ordinary urinal, Danto maintains\nthat  But the inference from the limits of the artistically formal to\nthe limits of the artistically aesthetic is presumably only as strong\nas the inferences from the immediacy and disinterest theses to\nartistic formalism, and these are not beyond question. The inference\nfrom the disinterest thesis appears to go through only if you employ a\nstronger notion of disinterest than the one Kant understands himself\nto be employing: Kant, it is worth recalling, regards poetry as the\nhighest of the fine arts precisely because of its capacity to employ\nrepresentational content in the expression of what he calls\n‘aesthetic ideas’ (Kant 1790, 191–194; see Costello\n2008 and 2013 for extended treatment of the capacity of Kantian\naesthetics to accommodate conceptual art). The inference from the\nimmediacy thesis appears to go through only if you employ a notion of\nimmediacy stronger than the one Hume, for example, takes himself to be\ndefending when he claims (in a passage quoted in section1.1) that\n“in many orders of beauty, particularly those of the fine arts,\nit is requisite to employ much reasoning, in order to feel the proper\nsentiment” (Hume 1751, 173). It may be that artistic formalism\nresults if you push either of the tendencies embodied in the immediacy\nand disinterest theses to extremes. It may be that the history of\naesthetics from the 18th century to the mid-Twentieth is largely\nthe history of pushing those two tendencies to extremes. It does not\nfollow that those tendencies must be so pushed. \n\nConsider Warhol’s Brillo Boxes. Danto is right to maintain\nthat the eighteenth-century theorist of taste would not know how to\nregard it as an artwork. But this is because the eighteenth-century\ntheorist of taste lives in the 18th century, and so would be\nunable to situate that work in its twentieth-century art-historical\ncontext, and not because the kind of theory he holds forbids him from\nsituating a work in its art-historical context. When Hume, for\ninstance, observes that artists address their works to particular,\nhistorically-situated audiences, and that a critic therefore\n“must place himself in the same situation as the audience”\nto whom a work is addressed (Hume 1757, 239), he is\nallowing that artworks are cultural products, and that the properties\nthat works have as the cultural products they are are among the\n“ingredients of the composition” that a critic must grasp\nif she is to feel the proper sentiment. Nor does there seem to be\nanything in the celebrated conceptuality of Brillo Boxes, nor\nof any other conceptual work, that ought to give the\neighteenth-century theorist pause. Francis Hutcheson asserts that\nmathematical and scientific theorems are objects of taste (Hutcheson\n1725, 36–41).  Alexander Gerard asserts that scientific\ndiscoveries and philosophical theories are objects of taste (Gerard\n1757, 6). Neither argues for his assertion. Both regard it as\ncommonplace that objects of intellect may be objects of taste as\nreadily as objects of sight and hearing may be.  Why should the\npresent-day aesthetic theorist think otherwise? If an object is\nconceptual in nature, grasping its nature will require intellectual\nwork. If grasping an object’s conceptual nature requires situating it\nart-historically, then the intellectual work required to grasp its\nnature will include situating it art-historically. But—as Hume\nand Reid held (see section 1.1)—grasping the nature of an object\npreparatory to aesthetically judging it is one thing; aesthetically\njudging the object once grasped is another. \n\nThough Danto has been the most influential and persistent critic of\nformalism, his criticisms are no more decisive than those advanced by\nKendall Walton in his essay “Categories of Art.”\nWalton’s anti-formalist argument hinges on two main theses, one\npsychological and one philosophical. According to the psychological\nthesis, which aesthetic properties we perceive a work as having depends\non which category we perceive the work as belonging to. Perceived as\nbelonging to the category of painting, Picasso’s\nGuernica will be perceived as “violent, dynamic, vital,\ndisturbing” (Walton 1970, 347). But perceived as belonging to the\ncategory of “guernicas”—where guernicas are works\nwith “surfaces with the colors and shapes of Picasso’s\nGuernica, but the surfaces are molded to protrude from the\nwall like relief maps of different kinds of\nterrain”—Picasso’s Guernica will be\nperceived not as violent and dynamic, but as “cold, stark,\nlifeless, or serene and restful, or perhaps bland, dull, boring”\n(Walton 1970, 347). That Picasso’s Guernica can be\nperceived both as violent and dynamic and as not violent and not\ndynamic might be thought to imply that there is no fact of the matter\nwhether it is violent and dynamic. But this implication holds only on\nthe assumption that there is no fact of the matter which category\nPicasso’s Guernica actually belongs to, and this\nassumption appears to be false given that Picasso intended that\nGuernica be a painting and did not intend that it be a\nGuernica, and that the category of paintings was well-established in\nthe society in which Picasso painted it while the category of guernicas\nwas not. Hence the philosophical thesis, according to which the\naesthetic properties a work actually has are those it is perceived as\nhaving when perceived as belonging to the category (or categories) it\nactually belongs to. Since the properties of having been intended to be\na painting and having been created in a society in which painting is\nwell-established category are artistically relevant though not\ngraspable merely by seeing (or hearing) the work, it seems that\nartistic formalism cannot be true. “I do not deny,” Walton\nconcludes, “that paintings and sonatas are to be judged solely on\nwhat can be seen or heard in them—when they are perceived\ncorrectly. But examining a work with the senses can by itself reveal\nneither how it is correct to perceive it, nor how to perceive it that\nway” (Walton 1970, 367). \n\nBut if we cannot judge which aesthetic properties paintings and\nsonatas have without consulting the intentions and the societies of the\nartists who created them, what of the aesthetic properties of natural\nitems? With respect to them it may appear as if there is nothing to\nconsult except the way they look and sound, so that an aesthetic\nformalism about nature must be true. Allen Carlson, a central figure in\nthe burgeoning field of the aesthetics of nature, argues against this\nappearance. Carlson observes that Walton’s psychological thesis\nreadily transfers from works of art to natural items: that we perceive\nShetland ponies as cute and charming and Clydesdales as lumbering\nsurely owes to our perceiving them as belonging to the category of\nhorses (Carlson 1981, 19). He also maintains that the philosophical\nthesis transfers: whales actually have the aesthetic properties we\nperceive them as having when we perceive them as mammals, and do not\nactually have any contrasting aesthetic properties we might perceive\nthem to have when we perceive them as fish. If we ask what determines\nwhich category or categories natural items actually belong to, the\nanswer, according to Carlson, is their natural\nhistories as discovered by natural science (Carlson\n1981, 21–22). Inasmuch as a natural item’s natural history will\ntend not to be graspable by merely seeing or hearing it, formalism is\nno truer of natural items than it is of works of art. \n\nThe claim that Walton’s psychological thesis transfers to\nnatural items has been widely accepted (and was in fact anticipated, as\nCarlson acknowledges, by Ronald Hepburn (Hepburn 1966 and 1968)). The\nclaim that Walton’s philosophical thesis transfers to natural\nitems has proven more controversial. Carlson is surely right that\naesthetic judgments about natural items are prone to be mistaken\ninsofar as they result from perceptions of those items as belonging to\ncategories to which they do not belong, and, insofar as determining\nwhich categories natural items actually belong to requires scientific\ninvestigation, this point seems sufficient to undercut the plausibility\nof any very strong formalism about nature (see Carlson 1979 for\nindependent objections against such formalism). Carlson, however, also\nwishes to establish that aesthetic judgments about natural items have\nwhatever objectivity aesthetic judgments about works of art do, and it\nis controversial whether Walton’s philosophical claim transfers\nsufficiently to support such a claim. One difficulty, raised by Malcolm\nBudd (Budd 2002 and 2003) and Robert Stecker (Stecker1997c), is that\nsince there are many categories in which a given natural item may\ncorrectly be perceived, it is unclear which correct category is the one\nin which the item is perceived as having the aesthetic properties it\nactually has. Perceived as belonging to the category of Shetland\nponies, a large Shetland pony may be perceived as lumbering; perceived\nas belonging to the category of horses, the same pony may be perceived\nas cute and charming but certainly not lumbering. If the Shetland pony\nwere a work of art, we might appeal to the intentions (or society) of\nits creator to determine which correct category is the one that fixes\nits aesthetic character. But as natural items are not human creations\nthey can give us no basis for deciding between equally correct but\naesthetically contrasting categorizations. It follows, according to\nBudd, “the aesthetic appreciation of nature is endowed with a\nfreedom denied to the appreciation of art” (Budd 2003, 34),\nthough this is perhaps merely another way of saying that the aesthetic\nappreciation of art is endowed with an objectivity denied to the\nappreciation of nature.  The eighteenth-century debate between rationalists and theorists\nof taste (or sentimentalists) was primarily a debate over the\nimmediacy thesis, i.e., over whether we judge objects to be beautiful\nby applying principles of beauty to them. It was not primarily a\ndebate over the existence of principles of beauty, a matter over which\ntheorists of taste might disagree. Kant denied that there are any such\nprinciples (Kant 1790, 101), but both Hutcheson and Hume affirmed\ntheir existence: they maintained that although judgments of beauty are\njudgments of taste and not of reason, taste nevertheless operates\naccording to general principles, which might be discovered through\nempirical investigation (Hutcheson 1725, 28–35; Hume 1757,\n231–233). \n\nIt is tempting to think of recent debate in aesthetics between\nparticularists and generalists as a revival of the eighteenth-century\ndebate between rationalists and theorists of taste. But the accuracy of\nthis thought is difficult to gauge. One reason is that it is often\nunclear whether particularists and generalists take themselves merely\nto be debating the existence of aesthetic principles or to be debating\ntheir employment in aesthetic judgment. Another is that, to the degree\nparticularists and generalists take themselves to be debating the\nemployment of aesthetic principles in aesthetic judgment, it is hard to\nknow what they can be meaning by ‘aesthetic judgment.’ If\n‘aesthetic’ still carries its eighteenth-century\nimplication of immediacy, then the question under debate is whether\njudgment that is immediate is immediate. If ‘aesthetic’ no\nlonger carries that implication, then it is hard to know what question\nis under debate because it is hard to know what aesthetic judgment\ncould be. It may be tempting to think that we can simply re-define\n‘aesthetic judgment’ such that it refers to any judgment in\nwhich an aesthetic property is predicated of an object. But this\nrequires being able to say what an aesthetic property is without\nreference to its being immediately graspable, something no one seems to\nhave done. It may seem that we can simply re-define ‘aesthetic\njudgment’ such that it refers to any judgment in which any\nproperty of the class exemplified by beauty is predicated of an object.\nBut which class is this? The classes exemplified by beauty are\npresumably endless, and the difficulty is to specify the relevant class\nwithout reference to the immediate graspability of its members, and\nthat is what no one seems to have done. \n\nHowever we are to sort out the particularist/generalist debate,\nimportant contributions to it include, on the side of particularism,\nArnold Isenberg’s “Critical Communication” (1949) Frank\nSibley’s “Aesthetic Concepts” (in Sibley 2001) and Mary\nMothersill’s Beauty Restored (1984) and, on the side of\ngeneralism, Monroe Beardsley’s Aesthetics (1958) and\n“On the Generality of Critical Reasons” (1962), Sibley’s\n“General Reasons and Criteria in Aesthetics” (in Sibley\n2001), George Dickie’s Evaluating Art (1987), Stephen\nDavies’s “Replies to Arguments Suggesting that Critics’ Strong\nEvaluations Could not be Soundly Deduced” (1995), and John\nBender’s “General but Defeasible Reasons in Aesthetic\nEvaluation: The Generalist/Particularist Dispute” (1995). Of\nthese, the papers by Isenberg and Sibley have arguably enjoyed the\ngreatest influence. \n\nIsenberg concedes that we often appeal to descriptive features of\nworks in support of our judgments of their value, and he allows that\nthis may make it seem as if we must be appealing to principles in\nmaking those judgments. If in support of a favorable judgment of some\npainting a critic appeals to the wavelike contour formed by the figures\nclustered in its foreground, it may seem as if his judgment must\ninvolve tacit appeal to the principle that any painting having such a\ncontour is so much the better. But Isenberg argues that this cannot be,\nsince no one agrees to any such principle: \n\nBut if in appealing to the descriptive features of a work we are not\nacknowledging tacit appeals to principles linking those features to\naesthetic value, what are we doing? Isenberg believes we are offering\n“directions for perceiving” the work, i.e., by singling out\ncertain its features, we are “narrow[ing] down the field of possible\nvisual orientations” and thereby guiding others in “the\ndiscrimination of details, the organization of parts, the grouping of\ndiscrete objects into patterns” (Isenberg 1949, 336). In this way\nwe get others to see what we have seen, rather than getting them to\ninfer from principle what we have so inferred. \n\nThat Sibley advances a variety of particularism in one paper and a\nvariety of generalism in another will give the appearance of\ninconsistency where there is none: Sibley is a particularist of one\nsort, and with respect to one distinction, and a generalist of another\nsort with respect to another distinction. Isenberg, as noted, is a\nparticularist with respect to the distinction between descriptions and\nverdicts, i.e., he maintains that there are no principles by which we\nmay infer from value-neutral descriptions of works to judgments of\ntheir overall value. Sibley’s particularism and generalism, by\ncontrast, both have to do with judgments falling in between\ndescriptions and verdicts. With respect to a distinction between\ndescriptions and a set of judgments intermediate between descriptions\nand verdicts, Sibley is straightforwardly particularist. With respect\nto a distinction between a set of judgments intermediate between\ndescriptions and verdicts and verdicts, Sibley is a kind of generalist\nand describes himself as such. \n\nSibley’s generalism, as set forth in “General Reasons and\nCriteria in Aesthetics,” begins with the observation that the\nproperties to which we appeal in justification of favorable verdicts\nare not all descriptive or value-neutral. We also appeal to properties\nthat are inherently positive, such as grace, balance, dramatic\nintensity, or comicality. To say that a property is inherently\npositive is not to say that any work having it is so much the better,\nbut rather that its tout court attribution implies value. So\nalthough a work may be made worse on account of its comical elements,\nthe simple claim that a work is good because comical is intelligible\nin a way that the simple claims that a work is good because yellow, or\nbecause it lasts twelve minutes, or because it contains many puns, are\nnot. But if the simple claim that a work is good because comical is\nthus intelligible, comicality is a general criterion for aesthetic\nvalue, and the principle that articulates that generality is true. But\nnone of this casts any doubt on the immediacy thesis, as Sibley\nhimself observes: \n\nThe “elsewhere” referred to in the first sentence is\nSibley’s earlier paper, “Aesthetic Concepts,” which argues\nthat the application of concepts such as ‘balanced,’\n‘tragic,’ ‘comic,’ or ‘joyous’ is\nnot a matter of determining whether the descriptive (i.e.,\nnon-aesthetic) conditions for their application are met, but is rather\na matter of taste. Hence aesthetic judgments are immediate in\nsomething like the way that judgments of color, or of flavor, are: \n\nBut Sibley recognizes—as his eighteenth-century forebears did\nand his formalist contemporaries did not—that important\ndifferences remain between the exercise of taste and the use of the\nfive senses. Central among these is that we offer reasons, or something\nlike them, in support of our aesthetic judgments: by talking—in\nparticular, by appealing to the descriptive properties on which the\naesthetic properties depend—we justify aesthetic judgments by\nbringing others to see what we have seen (Sibley 2001, 14–19). \n\nIt is unclear to what degree Sibley, beyond seeking to establish\nthat the application of aesthetic concepts is not condition-governed,\nseeks also to define the term ‘aesthetic’ in terms of their\nnot being so. It is clearer, perhaps, that he does not succeed in\ndefining the term this way, whatever his intentions. Aesthetic concepts\nare not alone in being non-condition-governed, as Sibley himself\nrecognizes in comparing them with color concepts. But there is also no\nreason to think them alone in being non-condition-governed while also\nbeing reason-supportable, since moral concepts, to give one example, at\nleast arguably also have both these features. Isolating the aesthetic\nrequires something more than immediacy, as Kant saw. It requires\nsomething like the Kantian notion of disinterest, or at least something\nto play the role played by that notion in Kant’s theory. \nGiven the degree to which Kant and Hume continue to influence thinking\nabout aesthetic judgment (or critical judgment, more broadly), given\nthe degree to which Sibley and Isenberg continue to abet that\ninfluence, it is not surprising that the immediacy thesis is now very\nwidely received. The thesis, however, has come under attack, notably\nby Davies (1990) and Bender (1995). (See also Carroll (2009), who\nfollows closely after Davies (1990), and Dorsch (2013) for further\ndiscussion.) \nIsenberg, it will be recalled, maintains that if the critic is arguing for her verdict, her argumentation must go something as follows: \n\nSince the critical principle expressed in premise 1 is open to\ncounter-example, no matter what property we substitute for p, Isenberg\nconcludes that we cannot plausibly interpret the critic as arguing for\nher verdict. Rather than defend the principle expressed in premise 1,\nDavies and Bender both posit alternative principles, consistent with\nthe fact that no property is good-making in all artworks, which they\nascribe to the critic. Davies proposes that we interpret the critic as\narguing deductively from principles relativized to artistic type, that\nis, from principles holding that artworks of a specific types or\ncategories—Italian Renaissance paintings, romantic symphonies,\nHollywood Westerns, etc.—having p are better for having it\n(Davies 1990, 174). Bender proposes that we interpret the critic as\narguing inductively from principles expressing mere tendencies that\nhold between certain properties and artworks—principles, in\nother words, holding that artworks having p tend to be better for\nhaving it (Bender 1995, 386). \nEach proposal has its own weaknesses and strengths. A problem with\nBender’s approach is that critics do not seem to couch their verdicts\nin probabilistic terms. Were a critic to say that a work is likely to\nbe good, or almost certainly good, or even that she has the highest\nconfidence that it must be good, her language would suggest that she\nhad not herself experienced the work, perhaps that she had judged the\nwork on the basis of someone else’s testimony, and that she was,\ntherefore, no critic at all. We would therefore have good reason to\nprefer Davies’s deductive approach if only we had good reason for\nthinking that relativizing critical principles to artistic type\nremoved the original threat of counterexample. Though it is clear that\nsuch relativizing reduces the relative number of counterexamples, we\nneed good reason for thinking that it reduces that number to zero, and\nDavies provides no such reason. Bender’s inductive approach, by\ncontrast, cannot be refuted by counterexample, but only by\ncounter-tendency. \nIf the critic argues from the truth of a principle to the truth of a\nverdict—as Davies and Bender both contend—it must be\npossible for her to establish the truth of the principle before\nestablishing the truth of the verdict. How might she do this? It seems\nunlikely that mere reflection on the nature of art, or on the natures\nof types of art, could yield up the relevant lists of good- and\nbad-making properties. At least the literature has yet to produce a\npromising account as to how this might be done. Observation therefore\nseems the most promising answer. To say that the critic establishes\nthe truth of critical principles on the basis of observation, however,\nis to say that she establishes a correlation between certain artworks\nshe has already established to be good and certain properties she has\nalready established those works to have. But then any capacity to\nestablish that works are good by inference from principles evidently\ndepends on some capacity to establish that works are good without any\nsuch inference, and the question arises why the critic should prefer\nto do by inference what she can do perfectly well without. The answer\ncannot be that judging by inference from principle yields\nepistemically better results, since a principle based on observations\ncan be no more epistemically sound than the observations on which it\nis based. \nNone of this shows that aesthetic or critical judgment could never be\ninferred from principles. It does however suggest that such judgment\nis first and foremost non-inferential, which is what the immediacy\nthesis holds. \n\nThe Kantian notion of disinterest has its most direct recent\ndescendents in the aesthetic-attitude theories that flourished from the\nearly to mid 20th century. Though Kant followed the British in\napplying the term ‘disinterested’ strictly to pleasures,\nits migration to attitudes is not difficult to explain. For Kant the\npleasure involved in a judgment of taste is disinterested because such\na judgment does not issue in a motive to do anything in particular. For\nthis reason Kant refers to the judgment of taste as contemplative\nrather than practical (Kant 1790, 95). But if the judgment of taste is\nnot practical, then the attitude we bear toward its object is\npresumably also not practical: when we judge an object aesthetically we\nare unconcerned with whether and how it may further our practical aims.\nHence it is natural to speak of our attitude toward the object as\ndisinterested. \n\nTo say, however, that the migration of disinterest from pleasures to\nattitudes is natural is not to say that it is\ninconsequential. Consider the difference between Kant’s aesthetic\ntheory, the last great theory of taste, and Schopenhauer’s aesthetic\ntheory, the first great aesthetic-attitude theory. Whereas for Kant\ndisinterested pleasure is the means by which we discover things to\nbear aesthetic value, for Schopenhauer disinterested attention (or\n“will-less contemplation”) is itself the locus of aesthetic\nvalue. According to Schopenhauer, we lead our ordinary, practical\nlives in a kind of bondage to our own desires (Schopenhauer 1819,\n196). This bondage is a source not merely of pain but also of\ncognitive distortion in that it restricts our attention to those\naspects of things relevant to the fulfilling or thwarting of our\ndesires. Aesthetic contemplation, being will-less, is therefore both\nepistemically and hedonically valuable, allowing us a desire-free\nglimpse into the essences of things as well as a respite from\ndesire-induced pain:\n  The two most influential aesthetic-attitude theories of the 20th\ncentury are those of Edward Bullough and Jerome Stolnitz. According to\nStolnitz’s theory, which is the more straightforward of the two,\nbearing an aesthetic attitude toward an object is a matter of\nattending to it disinterestedly and sympathetically, where to attend\nto it disinterestedly is to attend to it with no purpose beyond that\nof attending to it, and to attend to it sympathetically is to\n“accept it on its own terms,” allowing it, and not one’s\nown preconceptions, to guide one’s attention of it (Stolnitz 1960,\n32–36). The result of such attention is a comparatively richer\nexperience of the object, i.e., an experience taking in comparatively\nmany of the object’s features. Whereas a practical attitude limits and\nfragments the object of our experience, allowing us to “see only\nthose of its features which are relevant to our purposes,….  By\ncontrast, the aesthetic attitude ‘isolates’ the object and\nfocuses upon it—the ‘look’ of the rocks, the sound\nof the ocean, the colors in the painting.” (Stolnitz 1960, 33,\n35). \n\nBullough, who prefers to speak of “psychical distance”\nrather than disinterest, characterizes aesthetic appreciation as\nsomething achieved \n\nBullough has been criticized for claiming that aesthetic\nappreciation requires dispassionate detachment: \n\nBut such a criticism seems to overlook a subtlety of\nBullough’s view. While Bullough does hold that aesthetic\nappreciation requires distance “between our own self and its\naffections” (Bullough 1995, 298), he does not take this to\nrequire that we not undergo affections but quite the opposite: only if\nwe undergo affections have we affections from which to be distanced.\nSo, for example, the properly distanced spectator of a well-constructed\ntragedy is not the “over-distanced” spectator who feels no\npity or fear, nor the “under-distanced” spectator who feels\npity and fear as she would to an actual, present catastrophe, but the\nspectator who interprets the pity and fear she feels “not as\nmodes of [her] being but rather as characteristics of the\nphenomenon” (Bullough 1995, 299). The properly distanced\nspectator of a tragedy, we might say, understands her fear and pity to\nbe part of what tragedy is about. \n\nThe notion of the aesthetic attitude has been attacked from all\ncorners and has very few remaining sympathizers. George Dickie is\nwidely regarded as having delivered the decisive blow in his essay\n“The Myth of the Aesthetic Attitude” (Dickie 1964) by\narguing that all purported examples of interested or distanced\nattention are really just examples of inattention. So consider the case\nof the spectator at a performance of Othello who becomes\nincreasingly suspicious of his own wife as the action proceeds, or the case\nof the impresario who sits gauging the size of the audience, or the\ncase of the father who sits taking pride in his daughter’s\nperformance, or the case of the moralist who sits gauging the moral\neffects the play is apt to produce in its audience. These and all such\ncases will be regarded by the attitude theorist as cases of interested\nor distanced attention to the performance, when they are actually\nnothing but cases of inattention to the performance: the jealous\nhusband is attending to his wife, the impresario to the till, the\nfather to his daughter, the moralist to the effects of the play. But if\nnone of them is attending to the performance, then none of them is\nattending to it disinterestedly or with distance (Dickie 1964,\n57–59). \n\nThe attitude theorist, however, can plausibly resist Dickie’s\ninterpretation of such examples. Clearly the impresario is not\nattending to the performance, but there is no reason to regard the\nattitude theorist as committed to thinking otherwise. As for the\nothers, it might be argued that they are all attending. The jealous\nhusband must be attending to the performance, since it is the action of\nthe play, as presented by the performance, that is making him\nsuspicious. The proud father must be attending to the performance,\nsince he is attending to his daughter’s performance, which is an\nelement of it. The moralist must be attending to the performance, since\nhe otherwise would have no basis by which to gauge its moral effects on\nthe audience. It may be that none of these spectators is giving the\nperformance the attention it demands, but that is precisely the\nattitude theorist’s point. \n\nBut perhaps another of Dickie’s criticisms, one lesser known,\nultimately poses a greater threat to the ambitions of the attitude\ntheorist. Stolnitz, it will be recalled, distinguishes between\ndisinterested and interested attention according to the purpose\ngoverning the attention: to attend disinterestedly is to attend with no\npurpose beyond that of attending; to attend interestedly is to attend\nwith some purpose beyond that of attending. But Dickie objects that a\ndifference in purpose does not imply a difference in attention: \n\nThere is again much here that the attitude theorist can resist. The\nidea that listening is a species of attending can be resisted: the\nquestion at hand, strictly speaking, is not whether Jones and Smith\nlisten to the music in the same way, but whether they\nattend in the same way to the music they are listening to. The\ncontention that Jones and Smith are attending in the same way appears\nto be question-begging, as it evidently depends on a principle of\nindividuation that the attitude theorist rejects: if Jones’s\nattention is governed by some ulterior purpose and Smith’s is\nnot, and we individuate attention according to the purpose that governs\nit, their attention is not the same. Finally, even if we reject the\nattitude theorist’s principle of individuation, the claim that\nthere is but one way to attend to music is doubtful: one can seemingly\nattend to music in myriad ways—as historical document, as\ncultural artifact, as aural wallpaper, as sonic\ndisturbance—depending on which of the music’s features one\nattends to in listening to it. But Dickie is nevertheless onto\nsomething crucial to the degree he urges that a difference in purpose\nneed not imply a relevant difference in attention. Disinterest\nplausibly figures in the definition of the aesthetic attitude only to\nthe degree that it, and it alone, focuses attention on the features of\nthe object that matter aesthetically. The possibility that there are\ninterests that focus attention on just those same features implies that\ndisinterest has no place in such a definition, which in turn implies\nthat neither it nor the notion of the aesthetic attitude is likely to\nbe of any use in fixing the meaning of the term\n‘aesthetic.’ If to take the aesthetic attitude toward an\nobject simply is to attend to its aesthetically relevant properties,\nwhether the attention is interested or disinterested, then determining\nwhether an attitude is aesthetic apparently requires first determining\nwhich properties are the aesthetically relevant ones. And this task\nseems always to result either in claims about the immediate\ngraspability of aesthetic properties, which are arguably insufficient\nto the task, or in claims about the essentially formal nature of\naesthetic properties, which are arguably groundless. \n\nBut that the notions of disinterest and psychical distance prove\nunhelpful in fixing the meaning of the term ‘aesthetic’\ndoes not imply that they are mythic. At times we seem unable to get by\nwithout them. Consider the case of The Fall of Miletus—a\ntragedy written by the Greek dramatist Phrynicus and staged in Athens\nbarely two years after the violent Persian capture of the Greek city of\nMiletus in 494 BC. Herodotus records that \n\nHow are we to explain the Athenian reaction to this play without\nrecourse to something like interest or lack of distance? How, in\nparticular, are we to explain the difference between the sorrow\nelicited by a successful tragedy and the sorrow elicited in this case?\nThe distinction between attention and inattention is of no use here.\nThe difference is not that the Athenians could not attend to The\nFall whereas they could attend to other plays. The difference is\nthat they could not attend to The Fall as they could attend to\nother plays, and this because of their too intimate connection to what\nattending to The Fall required their attending to. \n\nTheories of aesthetic experience may be divided into two kinds\naccording to the kind of feature appealed to in explanation of what\nmakes experience aesthetic. Internalist theories appeal to features\ninternal to experience, typically to phenomenological features, whereas\nexternalist theories appeal to features external to the experience,\ntypically to features of the object experienced. (The distinction\nbetween internalist and externalist theories of aesthetic experience is\nsimilar, though not identical, to the distinction between phenomenal\nand epistemic conceptions of aesthetic experience drawn by Gary\nIseminger (Iseminger 2003, 100, and Iseminger 2004, 27, 36)). Though\ninternalist theories—particularly John Dewey’s (1934) and\nMonroe Beardsley’s (1958)—predominated during the early and\nmiddle parts of the 20th century, externalist\ntheories—including Beardsley’s (1982) and George\nDickie’s (1988)—have been in the ascendant since.\nBeardsley’s views on aesthetic experience make a strong claim on\nour attention, given that Beardsley might be said to have authored the\nculminating internalist theory as well as the founding externalist one.\nDickie’s criticisms of Beardsley’s internalism make an\nequally strong claim, since they moved Beardsley—and with him\nmost everyone else—from internalism toward externalism. \n\nAccording to the version of internalism Beardsley advances in his\nAesthetics (1958), all aesthetic experiences have in common\nthree or four (depending on how you count) features, which “some\nwriters have [discovered] through acute introspection, and which each of\nus can test in his own experience” (Beardsley 1958, 527). These\nare focus (“an aesthetic experience is one in which attention is\nfirmly fixed upon [its object]”), intensity, and unity, where\nunity is a matter of coherence and of completeness (Beardsley 1958,\n527). Coherence, in turn, is a matter of having elements that are\nproperly connected one to another such that \n\nCompleteness, by contrast, is a matter having elements that\n“counterbalance” or “resolve” one another such\nthat the whole stands apart from elements without it: \n\nDickie’s most consequential criticism of Beardsley’s\ntheory is that Beardsley, in describing the phenomenology of aesthetic\nexperience, has failed to distinguish between the features we\nexperience aesthetic objects as having and the features aesthetic\nexperiences themselves have. So while every feature mentioned in\nBeardsley’s description of the coherence of aesthetic\nexperience—continuity of development, the absence of gaps, the\nmounting of energy toward a climax—surely is a feature we\nexperience aesthetic objects as having, there is no reason to think of\naesthetic experience itself as having any such features: \n\nDickie raises a similar worry about Beardsley’s description of\nthe completeness of aesthetic experience: \n\nThough these objections turned out to be only the beginning of the\ndebate between Dickie and Beardsley on the nature of aesthetic\nexperience (See Beardsley 1969, Dickie 1974, Beardsley 1982, and Dickie\n1987; see also Iseminger 2003 for a helpful overview of the\nBeardsley-Dickie debate), they nevertheless went a long way toward\nshaping that debate, which taken as whole might be seen as the working\nout of an answer to the question “What can a theory of aesthetic\nexperience be that takes seriously the distinction between the\nexperience of features and the features of experience?” The\nanswer turned out to be an externalist theory of the sort that\nBeardsley advances in the 1982 essay “The Aesthetic Point of\nView” and that many others have advanced since: a theory\naccording to which an aesthetic experience just is an experience having\naesthetic content, i.e., an experience of an object as having the\naesthetic features that it has. \n\nThe shift from internalism to externalism has not been without\ncosts. One central ambition of internalism—that of fixing the\nmeaning of ‘aesthetic’ by tying it to features peculiar to\naesthetic experience—has had to be given up. But a second,\nequally central, ambition—that of accounting for aesthetic value\nby tying it to the value of aesthetic experience—has been\nretained. Indeed most everything written on aesthetic experience since\nthe Beardsley-Dickie debate has been written in service of the view\nthat an object has aesthetic value insofar as it affords valuable\nexperience when correctly perceived. This view—which has come to\nbe called empiricism about aesthetic value, given that it\nreduces aesthetic value to the value of aesthetic experience—has\nattracted many advocates over the last several years (Beardsley 1982,\nBudd 1985 and 1995, Goldman 1995 and 2006, Walton 1993, Levinson 1996\nand 2006, Miller 1998, Railton 1998, and Iseminger 2004), while\nprovoking relatively little criticism (Zangwill 1999, Sharpe 2000, D.\nDavies 2004, and Kieran 2005). Yet it can be wondered whether\nempiricism about aesthetic value is susceptible to a version of the\ncriticism that has done internalism in. \n\nFor there is something odd about the position that combines\nexternalism about aesthetic experience with empiricism about aesthetic\nvalue. Externalism locates the features that determine aesthetic\ncharacter in the object, whereas empiricism locates the features that\ndetermine aesthetic value in the experience, when one might have\nthought that the features that determine aesthetic character just are\nthe features that determine aesthetic value. If externalism and\nempiricism are both true, there is nothing to stop two objects that\nhave different, even wholly disparate, aesthetic characters from\nnevertheless having the very same aesthetic value—unless, that\nis, the value-determining features of an experience are bound logically\nto the character-determining features of the object that affords it\nsuch that only an object with those features could afford an experience\nhaving that value. But in that case the value-determining features of\nthe experience are evidently not simply the phenomenological features\nthat might have seemed best suited to determine the value of the\nexperience, but perhaps rather the representational or epistemic\nfeatures of the experience that it has only in relation to its object.\nAnd this is what some empiricists have been urging of late: \n\nBut there is an unaddressed difficulty with this line of thought.\nWhile the representational or epistemic features of an aesthetic\nexperience might very plausibly contribute to its value, such features\nvery implausibly contribute to the value of the object affording such\nan experience. If the value of the experience of a good poem consists,\nin part, in its being an experience in which the poem is properly\nunderstood or accurately represented, the value of a good poem cannot\nconsist, even in part, in its capacity to afford an experience in which\nit is properly understood or accurately represented, because, all\nthings being equal, a bad poem presumably has these capacities in equal\nmeasure. It is of course true that only a good poem rewards an\nunderstanding of it. But then a good poem’s capacity for\nrewarding understanding is evidently to be explained by the\npoem’s already being good; it is evidently in virtue of its\nalready being good that a poem rewards us on condition that we\nunderstand it. \n\nOther empiricists have taken a different tack. Instead of trying to\nisolate the general features of aesthetic experience in virtue of which\nit and its objects are valuable, they simply observe the impossibility,\nin any particular case, of saying much about the value of an aesthetic\nexperience without also saying a lot about the aesthetic character of\nthe object. So, for example, referring to the values of the experiences\nthat works of art afford, Jerrold Levinson maintains that \n\nThere is no denying that when we attempt to describe, in any detail,\nthe values of experiences afforded by particular works we quickly find\nourselves describing the works themselves. The question is what to make\nof this fact. If one is antecedently committed to empiricism, it may\nseem a manifestation of the appropriately intimate connection between\nthe aesthetic character of a work and the value of the experience that\nthe work affords. But if one is not so committed, it may seem to\nmanifest something else. If, when attempting to account for the\naesthetic value of Bartok’s Fourth String Quartet in terms of the\nvalue of the experience it affords, we find ourselves unable to say\nmuch about the value of that experience without saying something about\nthe quartet’s “particular turns and twists,” this may\nbe because the value resides in those twists and turns and not in the\nexperience of them. To affirm such a possibility, of course, is not to\ndeny that the value the quartet has in virtue of its particular twists\nin turns is a value that we experience it as having. It is rather to\ninsist on sharply distinguishing between the value of experience and\nthe experience of value, in something like the way Dickie insisted on\nsharply distinguishing between the unity of experience and the\nexperience of unity. When the empiricist maintains that that value of\nBartok’s Fourth String Quartet, with its particular twists and\nturns, consists in the value of the experience that it affords, which\nexperience is valuable, at least in part, because it is an experience\nof a quartet with those twists and turns, one may wonder whether a\nvalue originally belonging to the quartet has been transferred to the\nexperience, before being reflected back, once again, onto the\nquartet.","contact.mail":"shelljr@auburn.edu","contact.domain":"auburn.edu"}]
