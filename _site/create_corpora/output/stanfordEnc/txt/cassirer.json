His work pays equal attention to foundational and\nepistemological issues in the philosophy of mathematics and natural\nscience and to aesthetics, the philosophy of history, and other issues\nin the “cultural sciences” broadly conceived. More than any\nother German philosopher since Kant, Cassirer thus aims to devote equal\nphilosophical attention both to the (mathematical and) natural sciences\n(Naturwissenschaften) and to the more humanistic disciplines\n(Geisteswissenschaften). In this way, Cassirer, more than any\nother twentieth-century philosopher, plays a fundamental mediating role\nbetween C. P. Snow’s famous “two cultures.” He also plays a\nsimilarly mediating role between the two major traditions in\ntwentieth-century academic philosophy – the\n“analytic” and “continental” traditions –\nwhose radically different (and often mutually uncomprehending)\nperspectives on the relationship between scientific and humanistic\nelements in their subject gave rise to a fundamental split or gulf\nbetween philosophy as it came to be practiced in the Anglo-American\nworld, on the one side, and as it was practiced in most of the rest of\nthe world, on the other. Cassirer, by contrast, had fruitful\nphilosophical relations with leading members of both traditions –\nwith Moritz Schlick, the founder and guiding spirit of the Vienna\nCircle of logical empiricists, whose work in logic and the philosophy\nof science had a decisive influence on the development of philosophy in\nthe United States, and with Martin Heidegger, the creator of a radical\n“existential-hermeneutical” version of Husserlian\nphenomenology which quickly became dominant in continental Europe.\n\n\n\nCassirer was born on July 28, 1874, to a wealthy and cosmopolitan\nJewish family, in the German city of Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland).\nPart of the family lived in Berlin, including Cassirer’s cousin Bruno\nCassirer, the distinguished publisher, who later published most of\nCassirer’s writings. Cassirer entered the University of Berlin in 1892.\nIn 1894 he took a course on Kant with Georg Simmel, who recommended\nHermann Cohen’s writings on Kant in particular. Cohen, the first Jew to\nhold a professorship in Germany, was the founder of the so-called\nMarburg School of neo-Kantianism, famous for interpreting Kant’s\ntranscendental method as beginning with the “fact of\nscience” and then arguing regressively to the presuppositions or\nconditions of possibility of this “fact.” Kant was thus\nread as an “epistemologist [Erkenntniskritiker]”\nor methodologist of science rather than as a\n“metaphysician” in the tradition of post-Kantian German\nidealism. After learning of Cohen’s writings from Simmel, Cassirer\n(then nineteen years old) proceeded to devour them, whereupon he\nimmediately resolved to study with Cohen at Marburg. He studied at\nMarburg from 1896 to 1899, when he completed his doctoral work with a\ndissertation on Descartes’s analysis of mathematical and natural\nscientific knowledge. This appeared, in turn, as the Introduction to\nCassirer’s first published work, a treatment of Leibniz’s philosophy\nand its scientific basis [Cassirer 1902]. Upon returning to Berlin in\n1903, Cassirer further developed these themes while working out his\nmonumental interpretation of the development of modern philosophy and\nscience from the Renaissance through Kant [Cassirer 1906, 1907a]. The\nfirst volume of this work served as his habilitation at the University\nof Berlin, where he taught as an instructor or Privatdozent\nfrom 1906 to 1919. \n\nIn 1919 Cassirer was finally offered professorships at two newly\nfounded universities at Frankfurt and Hamburg under the auspices of the\nWeimar Republic. He taught at Hamburg from 1919 until emigrating from\nGermany in 1933. During these years Cassirer completed his three-volume\nPhilosophy of Symbolic Forms [Cassirer 1923, 1925, 1929b],\nwhich broke fundamental new ground beyond the neo-Kantianism of the\nMarburg School and articulated his own original attempt to unite\nscientific and non-scientific modes of thought (“symbolic\nforms”) within a single philosophical vision. In 1928 Cassirer\noffered a defense of Weimar [Cassirer 1929a] at the University’s\ncelebration of the tenth anniversary of the Republic, and in 1929–30 he\nserved as the rector of the University, as the first Jew to hold such a\nposition in Germany. In the Spring of 1929 Cassirer took part in a\nfamous disputation with Martin Heidegger in Davos, Switzerland, where\nHeidegger explicitly took Cohen’s neo-Kantianism as a philosophical\ntarget and defended his radical new conception of an “existential\nanalytic of Dasein” in the guise of a parallel interpretation of\nthe philosophy of Kant [Heidegger 1929]. Cassirer, for his part,\ndefended his own new understanding of Kant in the philosophy of\nsymbolic forms – against Heidegger’s insistence on the\nineluctability of human finitude – by appealing to genuinely\nobjectively valid, necessary and eternal truths arising in both moral\nexperience and mathematical natural science (see\n[Friedman 2000] [Gordon 2010]). \n\nAfter his emigration Cassirer spent two years lecturing at Oxford\nand then six years at the University of Göteborg in Sweden. During\nthis time he developed his most sustained discussion of morality and\nthe philosophy of law as a study of the Swedish legal philosopher Axel\nHägerström [Cassirer 1939a] (see [Krois 1987, chap. 4]). He\nalso articulated his major statement on the relationship between the\nnatural sciences and the “cultural sciences” [Cassirer\n1942], which contained, among other things, an explicit rejection of\nRudolf Carnap’s “physicalism” (see [Friedman 2000, chap.\n7]). Cassirer, like so many German émigrés during this\nperiod (including Carnap) then finally settled in the United States. He\ntaught at Yale from 1941 to 1944 and at Columbia in 1944–45. During\nthese years he produced two books in English [Cassirer 1944, 1946],\nwhere the first, An Essay on Man, serves as a concise\nintroduction to the philosophy of symbolic forms (and thus Cassirer’s\ndistinctive philosophical perspective) as a whole and the second,\nThe Myth of the State, offers an explanation of the rise of\nfascism on the basis of Cassirer’s conception of mythical thought. Two\nimportant American philosophers were substantially influenced by\nCassirer during these years: Arthur Pap, whose work on the\n“functional a priori” in physical theory [Pap 1946] took\nshape under Cassirer’s guidance at Yale, and Susanne Langer, who\npromulgated Cassirer’s philosophy of symbolic forms in aesthetic and\nliterary circles (see, e.g., [Langer 1942]). Cassirer’s American\ninfluence thus embraced both sides of his philosophical personality.\nOne can only speculate on what this influence might have been if his\nlife had not been cut short suddenly by a heart attack while walking on\nthe streets of New York City on April 13, 1945. \n\nAs indicated above, Cassirer’s first writings were largely\nhistorical in character – including a discussion of Leibniz’s\nphilosophy in its scientific context [Cassirer 1902] and a large-scale\nwork on the history of modern thought from the Renaissance through\nKant, Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophie und Wissenschaft der\nneueren Zeit [Cassirer 1906, 1907a]. The latter, in particular, is\na magisterial and deeply original contribution to both the history of\nphilosophy and the history of science. It is the first work, in fact,\nto develop a detailed reading of the scientific revolution as a whole\nin terms of the “Platonic” idea that the thoroughgoing\napplication of mathematics to nature (the so-called mathematization of\nnature) is the central and overarching achievement of this revolution.\nAnd Cassirer’s insight was explicitly acknowledged by such seminal\nintellectual historians as E. A. Burtt, E. J. Dijksterhuis, and\nAlexandre Koyré, who developed this theme later in the century\nin the course of establishing the discipline of history of science as\nwe know it today (see, e.g., [Burtt 1925], [Koyré 1939],\n[Dijksterhuis 1959]). Cassirer, for his part, simultaneously\narticulates an interpretation of the history of modern philosophy as\nthe development and eventual triumph of what he calls “modern\nphilosophical idealism.” This tradition takes its inspiration,\naccording to Cassirer, from idealism in the Platonic sense, from an\nappreciation for the “ideal” formal structures\nparadigmatically studied in mathematics, and it is distinctively modern\nin recognizing the fundamental importance of the systematic application\nof such structures to empirically given nature in modern mathematical\nphysics – a progressive and synthetic process wherein\nmathematical models of nature are successively refined and corrected\nwithout limit. For Cassirer, it is Galileo, above all, in opposition to\nboth sterile Aristotelian-Scholastic formal logic and sterile\nAristotelian-Scholastic empirical induction, who first grasped the\nessential structure of this synthetic process; and the development of\n“modern philosophical idealism” by such thinkers as\nDescartes, Spinoza, Gassendi, Hobbes, Leibniz, and Kant then consists\nin its increasingly self-conscious philosophical articulation and\nelaboration. \n\nIn both the Leibniz book and Das Erkenntnisproblem, then,\nCassirer interprets the development of modern thought as a whole from\nthe perspective of the basic philosophical principles of Marburg\nneo-Kantianism: the idea that philosophy as epistemology\n(Erkenntniskritik) has the articulation and elaboration of the\nstructure of modern mathematical natural science as its primary task;\nthe conviction that, accordingly, philosophy must take the “fact\nof science” as its starting point and ultimately given datum;\nand, most especially, the so-called “genetic” conception of\nscientific knowledge as an ongoing, never completed synthetic process\n(see below). From a contemporary point of view, Cassirer’s history may\ntherefore appear as both “Whiggish” and\n“triumphalist,” but it cannot be denied that his work is,\nnevertheless, extraordinarily rich, extraordinarily clear, and\nextraordinarily illuminating. Cassirer examines an astonishing variety\nof textual sources (including both major and minor figures) carefully\nand in detail, and, without at all neglecting contrary tendencies\nwithin the skeptical and empiricist traditions, he develops a\ncompelling portrayal of the evolution of “modern philosophical\nidealism” through Kant which, even today, reads as extremely\ncompelling and acute. \n\nCassirer must thus be ranked as one of the very greatest\nintellectual historians of the twentieth-century – and, indeed,\nas one of the founders of this discipline as it came to be practiced\nafter 1900. He continued to contribute to intellectual history broadly\nconceived throughout his career (most notably, perhaps, in his\nfundamental studies of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment [Cassirer\n1927a, 1932]), and he had a major influence on intellectual history\nthroughout the century. Aside from the history of science (see above),\nCassirer also decisively influenced intellectual historians more\ngenerally, including, notably, the eminent intellectual and cultural\nhistorian Peter Gay and the distinguished art historian Erwin Panofsky\n(see, e.g., [Gay 1977], [Panofsky 1939]). As we shall see below,\nintellectual (and later cultural) history is an integral part of\nCassirer’s distinctive philosophical methodology, so that, in his case,\nthe standard distinction between “historical” and\n“systematic” work in philosophy ends up looking quite\nartificial. \n\nIt was noted above that Cassirer’s early historical works interpret\nthe development of modern thought as a whole (embracing both philosophy\nand the sciences) from the perspective of the philosophical principles\nof Marburg neo-Kantianism, as initially articulated in [Cohen 1871]. On\nthe “genetic” conception of scientific knowledge, in\nparticular, the a priori synthetic activity of thought – the\nactivity Kant himself had called “productive synthesis”\n– is understood as a temporal and historical developmental\nprocess in which the object of science is gradually and successively\nconstituted as a never completed “X” towards which the\ndevelopmental process is converging. For Cohen, this process is\nmodelled on the methods of the infinitesimal calculus (in this\nconnection, especially, see [Cohen 1883]). Beginning with the idea of a\ncontinuous series or function, our problem is to see how such a series\ncan be a priori generated step-by-step. The mathematical concept of a\ndifferential shows us how this can be done, for the differential at a\npoint in the domain of a given function indicates how it is to be\ncontinued on succeeding points. The differential therefore\ninfinitesimally captures the rule of the series as a whole, and thus\nexpresses, at any given point or moment of time, the general form of\nthe series valid for all times, \n\nCassirer’s first “systematic” work, Substance and\nFunction [Cassirer 1910], takes an essential philosophical step\nbeyond Cohen by explicitly engaging with the late nineteenth-century\ndevelopments in the foundations of mathematics and mathematical logic\nthat exerted a profound influence on twentieth-century philosophy of\nmathematics and natural science. Cassirer begins by discussing the\nproblem of concept formation, and by criticizing, in particular, the\n“abstractionist” theory characteristic of philosophical\nempiricism, according to which general concepts are arrived at by\nascending inductively from sensory particulars. This theory, for\nCassirer, is an artifact of traditional Aristotelian logic; and his\nmain idea, accordingly, is that developments in modern formal logic\n(the mathematical theory of relations) allows us definitively to\nreject such abstractionism (and thus philosophical empiricism) on\nbehalf of the genetic conception of knowledge. In particular, the\nmodern axiomatic conception of mathematics, as exemplified especially\nin Richard Dedekind’s work on the foundations of arithmetic and David\nHilbert’s work on the foundations of geometry, has shown that\nmathematics itself has a purely formal and ideal, and thus entirely\nnon-sensible meaning. Pure mathematics describes abstract\n“systems of order” – what we would now call\nrelational structures – whose concepts can in no way be\naccommodated within abstractionist or inductivist philosophical\nempiricism. Cassirer then employs this “formalist”\nconception of mathematics characteristic of the late nineteenth\ncentury to craft a new, and more abstract, version of the genetic\nconception of knowledge. We conceive the developmental process in\nquestion as a series or sequence of abstract formal structures\n(“systems of order”), which is itself ordered by the\nabstract mathematical relation of approximate backwards-directed\ninclusion (as, for example, the new non-Euclidean geometries contain\nthe older geometry of Euclid as a continuously approximated limiting\ncase). In this way, we can conceive all the structures in our sequence\nas continuously converging, as it were, on a final or limit structure,\nsuch that all previous structures in the sequence are approximate\nspecial or limiting cases of this final structure. The idea of such an\nendpoint of the sequence is only a regulative ideal in the Kantian\nsense – it is only progressively approximated but never in fact\nactually realized.  Nevertheless, it still constitutes the a priori\n“general serial form” of our properly empirical\nmathematical theorizing, and, at the same time, it bestows on this\ntheorizing its characteristic form of objectivity. \n\nIn explicitly embracing late nineteenth-century work on the\nfoundations of mathematics, Cassirer comes into very close proximity\nwith early twentieth-century analytic philosophy. Indeed, Cassirer\ntakes the modern mathematical logic implicit in the work of Dedekind\nand Hilbert, and explicit in the work of Gottlob Frege and the early\nBertrand Russell, as providing us with our primary tool for moving\nbeyond the empiricist abstractionism due ultimately to Aristotelian\nsyllogistic. The modern “theory of the concept,”\naccordingly, is based on the fundamental notions of function, series,\nand order (relational structure) – where these notions, from the\npoint of view of pure mathematics and pure logic, are entirely formal\nand abstract, having no intuitive relation, in particular, to either\nspace or time. Nevertheless, and here is where Cassirer diverges from\nmost of the analytic tradition, this modern theory of the concept only\nprovides us with a genuine and complete alternative to Aristotelian\nabstractionism and philosophical empiricism when it is embedded within\nthe genetic conception of knowledge. What is primary is the generative\nhistorical process by which modern mathematical natural science\nsuccessively develops or evolves, and pure mathematics and pure logic\nonly have philosophical significance as elements of or abstractions\nfrom this more fundamental developmental process of “productive\nsynthesis” aimed at the application of such pure formal\nstructures in empirical knowledge (see especially [Cassirer\n1907b]). \n\nCassirer’s next important contribution to scientific epistemology\n[Cassirer 1921] explores the relationship between Einstein’s general\ntheory of relativity and the “critical” (Marburg\nneo-Kantian) conception of knowledge. Cassirer argues that Einstein’s\ntheory in fact stands as a brilliant confirmation of this conception.\nOn the one hand, the increasing use of abstract mathematical\nrepresentations in Einstein’s theory entirely supports the attack on\nAristotelian abstractionism and philosophical empiricism. On the other\nhand, however, Einstein’s use of non-Euclidean geometry presents no\nobstacle at all to our purified and generalized form of\n(neo-)Kantianism. For we no longer require that any particular\nmathematical structure be fixed for all time, but only that the\nhistorical-developmental sequence of such structures continuously\nconverge. Einstein’s theory satisfies this requirement perfectly well,\nsince the Euclidean geometry fundamental to Newtonian physics is indeed\ncontained in the more general geometry (of variable curvature) employed\nby Einstein as an approximate special case (as the regions considered\nbecome infinitely small, for example). Moritz Schlick published a\nreview of Cassirer’s book immediately after its first appearance\n[Schlick 1921], taking the occasion to argue (what later became a\nprominent theme in the philosophy of logical empiricism) that\nEinstein’s theory of relativity provides us with a decisive refutation\nof Kantianism in all of its forms. This review marked the beginnings of\na respectful philosophical exchange between the two, as noted above,\nand it was continued, in the context of Cassirer’s later work on the\nphilosophy of symbolic forms, in [Cassirer 1927b] (see [Friedman 2000,\nchap. 7]). \n\nCassirer’s assimilation of Einstein’s general theory of relativity\nmarked a watershed in the development of his thought. It not only gave\nhim an opportunity, as we have just seen, to reinterpret the Kantian\ntheory of the a priori conditions of objective experience (especially\nas involving space and time) in terms of Cassirer’s own version of the\ngenetic conception of knowledge, but it also provided him with an\nimpetus to generalize and extend the original Marburg view in such a\nway that modern mathematical scientific knowledge in general is now\nseen as just one possible “symbolic form” among other\nequally valid and legitimate such forms. Indeed, [Cassirer 1921] first\nofficially announces the project of a general “philosophy of\nsymbolic forms,” conceived, in this context, as a philosophical\nextension of “the general postulate of relativity.” Just\nas, according to the general postulate of relativity, all possible\nreference frames and coordinate systems are viewed as equally good\nrepresentations of physical reality, and, as a totality, are together\ninterrelated and embraced by precisely this postulate, similarly the\ntotality of “symbolic forms” – aesthetic, ethical,\nreligious, scientific – are here envisioned by Cassirer as\nstanding in a closely analogous relationship. So it is no wonder that,\nsubsequent to taking up the professorship at Hamburg in 1919, Cassirer\ndevotes the rest of his career to this new philosophy of symbolic\nforms. (Cassirer’s work in the philosophy of natural science in\nparticular also continued, notably in [Cassirer 1936].) \n\nAt Hamburg Cassirer found a tremendous resource for the next stage\nin his philosophical development – the Library of the Cultural\nSciences founded by Aby Warburg. Warburg was an eminent art historian\nwith a particular interest in ancient cult, ritual, myth, and magic as\nsources of archetypal forms of emotional expression later manifested in\nRenaissance art, and the Library therefore contained abundant materials\nboth on artistic and cultural history and on ancient myth and ritual.\nCassirer’s earliest works on the philosophy of symbolic forms appeared\nas studies and lectures of the Warburg Library in the years 1922–1925,\nand the three-volume Philosophy of Symbolic Forms itself\nappeared, as noted above, in 1923, 1925, and 1929 respectively. Just as\nthe genetic conception of knowledge is primarily oriented towards the\n“fact of science” and, accordingly, takes the historical\ndevelopment of scientific knowledge as its ultimate given datum, the\nphilosophy of symbolic forms is oriented towards the much more general\n“fact of culture” and thus takes the history of human\nculture as a whole as its ultimate given datum. The conception of human\nbeings as most fundamentally “symbolic animals,”\ninterposing systems of signs or systems of expression between\nthemselves and the world, then becomes the guiding philosophical motif\nfor elucidating the corresponding conditions of possibility for the\n“fact of culture” in all of its richness and diversity. \n\nCharacteristic of the philosophy of symbolic forms is a concern for\nthe more “primitive” forms of world-presentation underlying\nthe “higher” and more sophisticated cultural forms –\na concern for the ordinary perceptual awareness of the world expressed\nprimarily in natural language, and, above all, for the mythical view of\nthe world lying at the most primitive level of all. For Cassirer, these\nmore primitive manifestations of “symbolic meaning” now\nhave an independent status and foundational role that is quite\nincompatible with both Marburg neo-Kantianism and Kant’s original\nphilosophical conception. In particular, they lie at a deeper,\nautonomous level of spiritual life which then gives rise to the more\nsophisticated forms by a dialectical developmental process. From\nmythical thought, religion and art develop; from natural language,\ntheoretical science develops. It is precisely here that Cassirer\nappeals to “romantic” philosophical tendencies lying\noutside the Kantian and neo-Kantian tradition, deploys an historical\ndialectic self-consciously derived from Hegel, and comes to terms with\nthe contemporary Lebensphilosophie of Wilhelm Dilthey, Henri\nBergson, Max Scheler, and Georg Simmel – as well as with the\nclosely related philosophy of Martin Heidegger. \n\nThe most basic and primitive type of symbolic meaning is\nexpressive meaning, the product of what Cassirer calls the\nexpressive function (Ausdrucksfunktion) of thought, which is\nconcerned with the experience of events in the world around us as\ncharged with affective and emotional significance, as desirable or\nhateful, comforting or threatening. It is this type of meaning that\nunderlies mythical consciousness, for Cassirer, and which explains its\nmost distinctive feature, namely, its total disregard for the\ndistinction between appearance and reality. Since the mythical world\ndoes not consist of stable and enduring substances that manifest\nthemselves from various points of view and on various occasions, but\nrather in a fleeting complex of events bound together by their\naffective and emotional “physiognomic” characters, it also\nexemplifies its own particular type of causality whereby each part\nliterally contains the whole of which it is a part and can thereby\nexert all the causal efficacy of the whole. Similarly, there is no\nessential difference in efficacy between the living and the dead,\nbetween waking experiences and dreams, between the name of an object\nand the object itself, and so on. The fundamental Kantian\n“categories” of space, time, substance (or object), and\ncausality thereby take on a distinctive configuration representing the\nformal a priori structure, as it were, of mythical thought. \n\nWhat Cassirer calls representative symbolic meaning, a\nproduct of the representative function (Darstellungsfunktion)\nof thought, then has the task of precipitating out of the original\nmythical flux of “physiognomic” characters a world of\nstable and enduring substances, distinguishable and reidentifiable as\nsuch. Working together with the fundamentally pragmatic orientation\ntowards the world exhibited in the technical and instrumental use of\ntools and artifacts, it is in natural language, according to Cassirer,\nthat the representative function of thought is then most clearly\nvisible. For it is primarily through the medium of natural language\nthat we construct the “intuitive world” of ordinary sense\nperception on the basis of what Cassirer calls intuitive space and\nintuitive time. The demonstrative particles (later articles) and tenses\nof natural language specify the locations of perceived objects in\nrelation to the changing spatio-temporal position of the speaker\n(relative to a “here-and-now”), and a unified\nspatio-temporal order thus arises in which each designated object has a\ndeterminate relation to the speaker, his/her point of view, and his/her\npotential range of pragmatic activities. We are now able to distinguish\nthe enduring thing-substance, on the one side, from its variable\nmanifestations from different points of view and on different\noccasions, on the other, and we thereby arrive at a new fundamental\ndistinction between appearance and reality. This distinction is then\nexpressed in its most developed form, for Cassirer, in the linguistic\nnotion of propositional truth and thus in the propositional copula.\nHere the Kantian “categories” of space, time, substance,\nand causality take on a distinctively intuitive or\n“presentational” configuration. \n\nThe distinction between appearance and reality, as expressed in the\npropositional copula, then leads dialectically to a new task of\nthought, the task of theoretical science, of systematic inquiry into\nthe realm of truths. Here we encounter the third and final function of\nsymbolic meaning, the significative function\n(Bedeutungsfunktion), which is exhibited most clearly,\naccording to Cassirer, in the “pure category of relation.”\nFor it is precisely here, in the scientific view of the world, that the\npure relational concepts characteristic of modern mathematics, logic,\nand mathematical physics are finally freed from the bounds of sensible\nintuition. For example, mathematical space and time arise from\nintuitive space and time when we abstract from all demonstrative\nrelation to a “here-and-now” and consider instead the\nsingle system of relations in which all possible\n“here-and-now”-points are embedded; the mathematical system\nof the natural numbers arises when we abstract from all concrete\napplications of counting and consider instead the single potentially\ninfinite progression wherein all possible applications of counting are\ncomprehended; and so on. The eventual result is the world of modern\nmathematical physics described in Cassirer’s earlier scientific works\n– a pure system of formal relations where, in particular, the\nintuitive concept of substantial thing has finally been replaced by the\nrelational-functional concept of universal law. So it is here, and only\nhere, that the generalized and purified form of (neo-)Kantianism\ndistinctive of the Marburg School gives an accurate characterization of\nhuman thought. This characterization is now seen as a one-sided\nabstraction from a much more comprehensive dialectical process which\ncan no longer be adequately understood without paying equal attention\nto its more concrete and intuitive symbolic manifestations; and it is\nin precisely this way, in the end, that the Marburg “fact of\nscience” is now firmly embedded within the much more general\n“fact of culture” as a whole. \nCassirer emphasizes the kinship between his Philosophy of\nSymbolic Forms and Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit\nin the Prefaces to both the second (1925) and third (1929)\nvolumes. Recent commentators ([Skidelsky 2008] [Moss 2015]) have\nilluminatingly built on this circumstance in further articulating the\nrelationship between Cassirer and Hegel. Considerable light is\nshed on this relationship by Cassirer’s treatment of the problem\nof the Naturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften\nin The Logic of the Cultural Sciences (1942).  \n\nHegel had conceived nature (Natur) and spirit\n(Geist) as two different expressions of a single divine\ninfinite Reason, which manifests itself temporally from two different\npoints of view. His project of an encyclopedia of philosophical\nsciences had three parts, the logic, the philosophy of nature, and the\nphilosophy of spirit, where the logic had the task of depicting the\ndialectical conceptual structure of infinite divine Reason\nitself. But this Hegelian project for securing the ultimate\nlogico-metaphysical identity of nature and spirit found ever fewer\nfollowers as the century progressed, as the rising tide of\nneo-Kantianism – aided by further developments within the natural\nsciences instigated by Hermann von Helmholtz – undermined the\nappeal of the original Naturphilosophie of Schelling and Hegel\ntogether with their Absolute Reason. The result was the problem\nof the Naturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften\nas it presented itself to the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. [Cassirer 1942] develops a characteristically\nmethodological perspective on this problem by treating both disciplines\nas empirical rather than “speculative” sciences\n(in the sense of Schelling and Hegel) and elucidating their\nmethodological relationship within the philosophy of symbolic\nforms. \n\n[Cassirer 1942] argues that the empirical evidential basis for the\ncultural sciences starts from the same realm of perceived physical\nobjects and processes distributed in space and time as do the natural\nsciences – in this case documents, artifacts, rituals,\nperformances – but it goes on to imbue them with a symbolic\n“sense” or “meaning” that is not at issue in\nthe natural sciences. We must distinguish, in particular, between\nthe representative function (Darstellungsfunktion) and the\nexpressive function (Ausdrucksfunktion) of thought, and only a\nprejudice privileging “thing perception\n[Dingwahrnehmen]” over “expressive perception\n[Ausdruckswahrnehmen]” can support the idea that the\nnatural sciences have a more secure evidential basis than he cultural\nsciences. (It is precisely this prejudice which, according to\nCassirer, lies behind Carnap’s “physicalism.”) \nFor Cassirer, by contrast, both forms of perception are equally\nlegitimate. While the natural sciences take their evidence from\nthe sphere of thing perception, the cultural sciences take theirs from\nthe sphere of expressive perception – and, in the first instance,\nfrom our lived experience in a human community sharing a common system\nof “cultural meanings.”  \n\nYet we also have the capacity, in the cultural sciences, to\nextend such meanings beyond their originally local contexts. \nWhereas intersubjective validity in the natural sciences rests on\nuniversal laws of nature ranging over all (physical) places and times,\nan analogous type of intersubjective validity arises in the cultural\nsciences independently of such laws. Although every\n“cultural object” has its own individual place in\n(historical) time and (geographical-cultural) space, it can still\ncontinuously approach a universal cultural meaning (in history or\nethnography) as it is continually interpreted and\nreinterpreted from the perspective of other times and\nplaces. Universal cultural meaning thereby emerges only\nasymptotically, in a way similar to the genetic conception of knowledge\nof the Marburg School (now seen as based on the significative function\nof thought). Rather than an abstract mathematical relation of\nbackwards-directed inclusion, however, we are concerned, in the\nhistorical cultural sciences, with a hermeneutical relation of\nbackwards-directed interpretation and reinterpretation – and, as a\nresult, there is no possibility, in these sciences, of reliably\npredicting the future. \n\nWe can further illuminate Cassirer’s evolving attempt to\nsituate himself between Kant and Hegel by considering his evolving\nrelationship to Heidegger. In the 1929 Disputation at Davos\nCassirer challenged Heidegger’s radical “finitism” by\nappealing to the presumed necessary and eternal validity found in both\nthe mathematical sciences and morality. And after the Disputation\nCassirer added five footnotes to Being and Time (1927) in\nThe Phenomenology of Knowledge before its publication, where\nhe suggested that his attempt to begin the Hegelian phenomenology with\nmythical thought rather than ordinary sense perception could also\naddress Heidegger’s concerns. In 1931, however, Cassirer\npublished a review of [Heidegger 1929], which took a different approach\nfrom his remarks at Davos. Instead of primarily emphasizing the\n“eternal” validity found in the mathematical sciences,\nCassirer now placed his main emphasis on the ethical and aesthetic\ndimensions of Kant’s thought, as expressed in the Critique of\nPractical Reason and the Critique of the Power of\nJudgement. His main point was that, whereas the\nTranscendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason may\nindeed be written from the perspective of human finitude, the rest of\nKant’s system embeds this perspective within a wider conception\nof “the intelligible substrate of humanity.”  \n\n[Cassirer 1931] mirrors his just-completed attempt to embed the\nMarburg genetic conception of knowledge within a wider conception of\nthe development of human culture as a whole. The way in which\nCassirer situates his new philosophy of culture with respect to both\nHegel and Heidegger then illuminates his fundamental divergence from\nHegel – as it came to be expressed in Cassirer’s works on\nhistory and culture after he left Germany for good in 1933. By\nbuilding the Marburg conception of knowledge, in his new philosophy of\nculture, on top of the more primitive forms of mythical thought\n[Ausdruckswahrnehmen] and ordinary language\n[Dingwahrnehmen], Cassirer takes himself to have done justice\nto the insights of both Hegel and Heidegger while avoiding both the\ninfinite divine reason of the former and the radical human finitude of\nthe latter. Yet he has now conceded to Heidegger that\nKant’s theory of human cognition involves only the notion of\npotential rather than actual infinity. In particular,\nKant’s treatment of the regulative use of the ideas of reason\nfrom a merely theoretical point of view leaves their actual\ncontent quite indeterminate. In the case of the idea of\ntranscendental freedom, for example, we are only able to determine it\nnegatively (from a theoretical point of view), as a species of\ncausality that is not bound by the conditions of\ntime-determination governing the phenomenal world.  \n\nIn the Critique of Practical Reason, however, Kant asserts\nthat transcendental freedom acquires a determinate content from pure\npractical reason, through our immediate awareness of the moral\nlaw as normatively binding on our will (as a fact of reason), and that\nthe (practical) objective reality thereby conferred on this idea can\nthen be transferred to the ideas of God and Immortality. This is\nbecause the moral law unconditionally commands us to seek the Highest\nGood – the realization of the Kingdom of Ends here on\nearth – which is an infinite task requiring\ninfinite (practical) faith and hope. The resulting\ndivergence from the indeterminate and merely potential infinity arising\nwithin theoretical reason is visible in the famous passage on the\nstarry heavens above me and the moral law within me at the end of the\nCritique of Practical Reason, from which Cassirer quotes in\nhis 1931 review of Heidegger. \n\nWhat the Critique of the Power of Judgement adds to this\nconception is then the further idea that rigorous mathematical\nscientific understanding of the phenomenal world\n(“mechanistic” understanding) runs out considerably before\nwe arrive at the history of human culture, so that the future is in\nprinciple open to the possibility of our continuously approximating the\nHighest Good without limit. But Cassirer, as we have just seen,\nhas now achieved a parallel result though his methodological\ndistinction between the natural and the cultural sciences. He is\nthereby in a position to replace what he takes to be the oppressive\n(speculative) infinity of Hegel’s Absolute Reason with the\nliberating (practical) infinity of our human (practical) reason\n[Cassirer 1939, 28]: “In his philosophy of history Hegel\nwanted to provide the definitive speculative demonstration that reason\nis substance and infinite power. For this, however, we must,\naccording to him, above all attain the insight that reason is\n‘not so powerless as to pass for a mere ideal, a mere\nought.’ This form of proof has become shaky; the\ncritique of the foundations of the Hegelian system has pulled the\nground out from under it. If we turn back from the Hegelian\nmeaning of idea to the Kantian, from the idea as ‘absolute\npower’ back to the idea as ‘infinite problem,’ we\nmust of course give up the speculative optimism of the Hegelian view of\nhistory. But, at the same time, we thereby also avoid fatalistic\npessimism with its prophecies and visions of decline. [Our]\nacting again has a free path to decide for itself out of its own force\nand responsibility, and it knows that the direction and future of\nculture will depend on the manner of this decision.” It is\nin this way, for Cassirer, that our cultural future always lies open\nand is always up to us.","contact.mail":"mlfriedman@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
