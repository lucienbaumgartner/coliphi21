As such, it counts\nwithin its domain a broad range of questions and puzzles, including:\nIs morality more a matter of taste than truth? Are moral standards\nculturally relative? Are there moral facts? If there are moral facts,\nwhat is their origin? How is it that they set an appropriate standard\nfor our behavior?  How might moral facts be related to other facts\n(about psychology, happiness, human conventions…)? And how do\nwe learn about the moral facts, if there are any?  These questions\nlead naturally to puzzles about the meaning of moral claims as well as\nabout moral truth and the justification of our moral\ncommitments. Metaethics explores as well the connection between\nvalues, reasons for action, and human motivation, asking how it is\nthat moral standards might provide us with reasons to do or refrain\nfrom doing as it demands, and it addresses many of the issues commonly\nbound up with the nature of freedom and its significance (or not) for\nmoral\n responsibility.[1]\n\n\n\nThe range of issues, puzzles and questions that fall within\nmetaethics’ purview are consistently abstract. They reflect the\nfact that metaethics involves an attempt to step back from particular\nsubstantive debates within morality to ask about the views,\nassumptions, and commitments that are shared by those who engage in\nthe debate. By and large, the metaethical issues that emerge as a\nresult of this process of stepping back can be addressed without\ntaking a particular stand on substantive moral issues that started the\nprocess. In fact, metaethics has seemed to many to offer a crucial\nneutral background against which competing moral views need to be seen\nif they are to be assessed properly. Some metaethicists early in the\ntwentieth century went so far as to hold that their own work made no\nsubstantive moral assumptions at all and had no practical\n implications.[2]\n Whether any view that is recognizably still a\nview about the nature and status of ethics could manage this is\ndubious. But there is no doubt that, whatever\nmetaethics's substantive assumptions and practical implications\nmight be, it involves reflecting on the presuppositions and commitments\nof those engaging in moral thought, talk, and practice and so\nabstracting away from particular moral\njudgments. \n\nSuch reflection quickly reveals the extent to which various aspects of\nmorality might reasonably be seen as both intellectually and\npractically problematic. On the intellectual side, many have worried\nthat there is no good way to vindicate the assumptions and commitments\nof morality. A careful and clear-eyed study of morality will reveal,\nsome argue, that morality is a myth; others argue that the various\nprinciples that are presented as authoritative standards for all are\nactually merely expressions of emotion or projections of the\nidiosyncratic attitudes of those advocating the principles; still\nothers argue that in some other way morality is not what it pretends\nto be and not what it needs to be if it is to be legitimate. On the\npractical side, many have pressed the difficulty of getting people to\njudge themselves and others impartially; others have worried that,\nwhile we have an interest in convincing others to conform to morality,\nwe ourselves rarely have any reason, really, to conform; still others\nhave thought that the sort of freedom morality assumes is not\navailable to humans as they actually are.  \n\nOf course these worries and arguments regularly find counterparts on\nthe other side, with people maintaining that, properly understood,\nmorality is no myth, that its pretensions can be vindicated, that we\nhave all the reason we need to embrace morality and meet its demands,\nand that people, at least some people under some circumstances, have\nwhatever sort of freedom it is that morality might require.  \n\nNone of the arguments, on either side, can go quickly or easily.  They\nall depend, first, on identifying and defending the presuppositions\nand commitments one takes to be at issue and then, second, on showing\nthat they either cannot, or can, be defended.  What is at stake is, at\nleast, an understanding of what is an important part of most\npeoples’ lives, but there is potentially a lot more at stake to\nthe extent the presuppositions and commitments people take for granted\nturn out to be suspect. For then, not only will our\nunderstanding of that part of our lives be compromised, our\nsense that it is important may well disappear as well.   \n\nDespite the abstract and deeply controversial nature of metaethics,\nits central concerns arise naturally — perhaps even inevitably\n— as one reflects critically on one's own moral convictions. So\nit is no surprise that, in Plato's Republic,\nPolemarchus’ claim that being a just person enhances one's life\ndeveloped quickly into a decidedly metaethical discussion of the\norigin and nature of justice. Early in Book I, for instance,\nThrasymachus defends the idea that justice is whatever is in the\ninterest of the stronger, arguing that morality is a human creation\ndesigned by the rich and powerful to control and exploit others. A\nmyth for the weak-minded, arranged for the advantage of a few, justice\nimposes burdens most have reason to set aside. So Thrasymachus argues.\nGlaucon follows up, in Book II, with an alternative, and less cynical,\nproposal. While he too sees morality as a human creation, he sees it\nas a salutary solution to the serious problems we would otherwise\nface. He argues that people naturally find themselves unable\nsuccessfully to ensure that their own wills will rule while,\nsimultaneously, being subject regularly to the will of others.  The\nprinciples of justice are, he thinks, reasonably introduced and\nenforced by all as a good way to ensure peace and stability in\nsociety. Socrates, in contrast, rejects the idea that justice is a\nhuman invention and argues instead that justice provides independent\nand eternal standards against which human practices, conventions, and\ninstitutions can be judged. These different views will likely have\nimplications for what value justice might have. At the same time,\nthough, accepting one or the other view of the nature of justice is\ncompatible with a range of substantive views about what, specifically,\njustice consists in and about its value.   \n\nAccording to many, Socrates's position fits well with\nmorality's pretensions. It fits well also with the thought\nthat whatever standards humans might put in place are, one and all,\nliable to moral criticism. Of course, Socrates's position\nbrings along a suite of puzzles concerning the nature of these\ntranscendent standards. What is their origin and from where do\nthey derive their authority?   \n\nMany have thought the right answers to these questions are found in an\nappeal to God. On their view, moral principles are the expression of\nGod's will — they are His commands to us — and they get\ntheir authority from their source. In important ways, though, this\nmerely shifts the puzzles back a step.  Whatever problems one might\nhave making sense of eternal transcendent standards re-emerge when\ntrying to make sense of an eternal transcendent being who might issue\ncommands. And, as Plato emphasized in Euthyphro, one is also\nleft with the difficulty of explaining why God's commands are\nauthoritative.   \n\nOne plausible answer might be that God's perfect knowledge of right\nand wrong, or God's own moral perfection, explains why his commands\nserve legitimately as standards for us. But that answer assumes that\nstandards of morality exist independently of God's will (either as\nobjects of his knowledge or as standards in light of which He counts\nas morally perfect), in which case speaking of morality as consisting\nof God's commands will not explain the origin or nature of these\nindependently existing standards.  \n\nAlternatively, one might eschew an appeal to God's knowledge or\ngoodness and claim that there is no independent standard for God's\nwill and nature. But that leaves in place the puzzle concerning the\nauthority of moral principles. If we reject the idea that God's\ncommands reflect His knowledge of right and wrong, and reject as well\nthe idea that God is all good, it seems reasonable to wonder why his\ncommands have any special\n authority.[3] \n\nOne might here point to God's power to punish or to His role in our\ncreation. But neither consideration seems to establish legitimate\nauthority on its own. In general, at least, the mere fact that one has\nthe power to enforce one's commands does not establish those commands\nas legitimate, nor does it ensure that one has a right to punish those\nwho fail to conform to one's commands. Similarly, in general, the mere\nfact that one created something does not establish that one properly\nhas absolute control over what one has created.  Of course, room\nremains to argue that there is something special about God's power, or\nabout His role as creator, that makes his commands distinctively\nlegitimate. What is needed is an account of what is special. And, in\nthis context, it needs to be an account that explains how God's\ncommands, as opposed to the commands that others might issue, have an\nauthority. Moreover, if appealing to God is to solve the metaethical\npuzzle posed by Euthyphro, the account offered must not itself rely\non, or presuppose, the sort of transcendent standards we have been\nattempting to explain. \n\nOne appealing feature of Glaucon's account of morality as a mutually\nadvantageous convention is that it renders morality's origin and\nnature non-mysterious. Moral facts, on this sort of view, emerge as no\nmore puzzling than facts about what is legal or polite. In each case,\nthe standing of some behavior (as moral, or legal, or polite) depends\non its conforming to, or conflicting with, various standards that have\nbeen put in place. Glaucon's account also makes clear why it is that\npeople might care deeply about morality's demands (even as they are,\nin their own cases, tempted to violate them when they believe they can\nwith impunity), since the relevant conventions are mutually\nadvantageous.  \n\nYet conventionalist views such as Glaucon's have real difficulties\nfitting with the common idea that the fundamental principles of\nmorality are universal. Conventions, after all, are contingent\ncreations that differ from place to place and come in to, and go out\nof, existence. Moreover, conventions seem liable to arbitrariness in\nways that threaten to undermine their claim to authority unless they\nare recognized (at least implicitly) as satisfying some\nconvention-independent standard. That some convention demands\nsomething seems to provide reason to conform to the demand only when\nthe convention is, itself, just or reasonable, or in some other way\ngood. And this suggests that, to whatever extent specific moral rules\nand principles are products of convention, their claim to authority\nrelies on some standards that are not products of convention.  \n\nNeedless to say, these considerations are not decisive, and those who\nsee morality as a kind of convention have a variety of plausible ways\nto address the worries mentioned above. As a result, the view remains\nattractive. Still, many — even many who think an appeal to\nconvention is essential to making sense of morality — think that\nthe proper account of morality cannot be a matter of conventions\n“all the way \ndown.”[4]\n  But that does not mean that they think that the standards that serve\nto justify the demands of (some) conventions are mysterious. Some, for\ninstance, argue that what makes a convention good, and so serves to\njustify its demands, is its contribution to overall happiness, while\nothers see the measure of conventions in their ability to advance the\ninterests of each considered singly, and still others maintain that\nthe value of conventions is found in their capacity to secure the\napproval of those who consider them impartially. On all such accounts,\nvalue is convention-independent, but it is nonetheless metaphysically\nnon-mysterious. Each of these accounts portrays value as, at bottom, a\nfamiliar, completely natural, feature of the world.  Moreover, while\n(on these accounts) particular claims concerning value will prove hard\nto establish and controversial, there is no special puzzle about what\nwe would be trying to discover or what would count as relevant\nevidence.  \n\nAll of these views, conventionalist and not, identify various moral\nproperties with non-problematic natural features of the world. As a\nresult, they are commonly characterized as versions of naturalism and\nare contrasted with non-naturalist views that see morality as\npresupposing, or being committed to, properties over and above those\nthat would be countenanced by natural science. Non-naturalism comes\nwith two distinctive burdens: (i) accounting for how the realm of\nmoral properties fits in with familiar natural properties and (ii)\nexplaining how it is that we are able to learn anything about these\nmoral properties. Naturalism, in contrast, avoids these metaphysical\nand epistemological burdens. \n\nDespite its advantages, naturalism has difficulty capturing well what\npeople take to be the true nature of morality. In saying something is\ngood or right or virtuous we seem to be saying something more than, or\nat least different from, what we would be saying in describing it as\nhaving certain natural features.  Correspondingly, no amount of\nempirical investigation seems by itself, without some moral\nassumption(s) in play, sufficient to settle a moral question.  \n\nDavid Hume seemed to have these points in mind when he observed that\nan ‘ought’ cannot be derived from an\n ‘is.’[5]\n There is substantial debate about just what Hume meant, and similarly\nsubstantial debate as well about whether he was right. But at least\npart of Hume's concern seems to have been that no set of claims about\nplain matters of fact (‘is’ claims) entail any evaluative\nclaims (‘ought’ claims). That is, he seems to have\nthought, that one can infer the latter from the former only if, in\naddition to premises concerning plain matters of fact, one has on hand\nas well at least one evaluative premise. If, for instance, one infers\nfrom the fact that someone is feeling pain that something bad is\nhappening, one is at least presupposing that pain is bad. And that\npresupposition, in turn, is not entailed by any claims concerned\nsolely with plain matters of fact. If Hume is right, every valid\nargument for an evaluative conclusion either includes or presupposes\nsome evaluative premise. And, as a result, there is no value neutral\nargument for an evaluative conclusion. \n\nComing at the same issues from a different direction, G. E. Moore\nargued (at the beginning of the twentieth century) that no naturalist\naccount of morality could do justice to what we are actually thinking\nand claiming when we make moral\n judgments.[6] \n Moore had in mind a variety\nof naturalist views that, at the time, had come to be seen as, on\nbalance, the most attractive accounts of the nature of morality. \nWhile these views differed among themselves as to what goodness,\nrightness, virtue and justice might consist in, they shared a\ncommitment to seeing morality as a wholly natural phenomenon and they\nall saw moral judgment as a matter of thinking that actions,\ninstitutions, or characters had some particular natural property or\nother. According to these views, moral properties were to be\nidentified with some natural property or other (e.g. with what is\npleasant, or what satisfies someone's desire, or what conforms to\nsocial rules that are in force). \n\nConsidering specifically views that identified goodness either with\npleasure or with being the object of a desire one desires to have,\nMoore maintained that such views confused the property goodness with\nsome other property that good things might happen to have. In support\nof his claim, Moore offered a simple test. Take whichever account you\nwill — say, one according to which to be good is to be pleasant\n— and then consider whether a person who understands the terms\ninvolved might nonetheless intelligibly ask whether something she\nacknowledges to be pleasant is good. It seems she could. And it seems\ntoo that in asking the question she would not then be revealing any\nkind of conceptual confusion or incompetence. The question is, as\nMoore put it, a genuinely open one. But then we must grant that to\nthink something is pleasant is not identical to thinking it\ngood. Otherwise, wondering whether something that is, admittedly,\npleasant, is good would be as senseless as wondering whether a given\npleasant thing was pleasant. If, though, to think something good is\ndifferent than thinking it pleasant, such thoughts (Moore assumed)\nmust involve attributing distinct properties.  \n\nMoore was quick to point out that granting that the question is open,\nin the sense his argument supposes, is compatible with discovering\nthat, as a matter of fact, everything that is pleasant is also\ngood. Moore's point is that the question is not settled — not\nclosed — on conceptual grounds (whereas it would be if thinking\nsomething good were just a matter of thinking it pleasant).  Because\nanalogous questions remain open for all the candidate naturalist\nproposals, Moore argued that no such proposal could legitimately be\ndefended as a conceptual truth and that they all failed to capture\naccurately what we are thinking in thinking of something that it is\ngood. \n\nMoore's argument had a tremendous impact, striking most people at the\ntime as decisive. As a result, non-naturalism got a new lease on life\nwith a number of people working in metaethics trying to articulate,\nsystematize, and defend accounts of morality that resisted the\ntemptation to identify moral properties with natural\n properties.[7] \n Much of the\nattention was given, by those who have come to be called intuitionists,\nto defending the idea that moral knowledge, while not based on our\nsenses and on the empirical data we might collect, was nonetheless on\nas secure a footing as, say, our knowledge of mathematics or of the\nfundamental concepts (of, say, causation and necessity) that play\ncrucial roles in science. Much of the work in metaethics pursued\na strategy of finding companions in guilt, of showing that the status\nof moral properties as non-natural and the attendant implications for\nwhat we must suppose about the nature of moral evidence, if we are to\ntake ourselves as having any, did not leave morality any worse off than\nother respected fields of knowledge. \n\nYet Moore's casual slide from claims about what we are thinking to the\nnature of the properties we are attributing in thinking as we do,\noffered an important point of resistance. As Moore saw things, to make\na moral claim is to express a distinctive belief (that might be true\nor false) about how things are. Specifically, it is to express the\nbelief that some course of action, or institution, or character trait\nhad the property of being right, or good, or virtuous. The challenge\n(Moore assumed) is to figure out what property it is that we are\ntaking a thing to have, in thinking of it as right, or good, or\nvirtuous. And the place to look, he thought, is at the content of our\nbeliefs. \n\nAccording to many, while Moore's Open Question argument does show that\nmoral thinking is distinctive and should not be treated as part and\nparcel of thinking about non-moral matters, Moore was wrong in holding\nthat the important difference should be traced to the nature of the\nproperties we are taking things to have. According to some of these\ncritics, Moore's mistake is in thinking we are attributing properties\nat all, when we think of something as right, or good, or virtuous;\naccording to others, his mistake was in thinking that how we think of\na property reveals the true nature of the\n property.[8] \n\nThe first line of criticism emerged soon after Moore first offered his\nOpen Question Argument, with philosophers suggesting that in thinking\nmorally we may well not be attributing properties at\n all.[9] \n Agreeing that it was a mistake to see moral claims as attributing\nnatural properties to things, non-cognitivists argue that Moore's\nmistake was in thinking that moral claims attribute any sort of\nproperty to things, and so he was also wrong in thinking that moral\nclaims have propositional content and express genuine beliefs. The\nOpen Question is always open, they argue, not because we are, in\nmaking a moral judgment, attributing some non-natural property to\nthings, but because we are not attributing any property at all. We are\nnot saying anything that might be true or false, nor are we expressing\na belief. We are doing something altogether different: taking a stand,\nor expressing an emotion, or prescribing something. On these views,\nmoral judgments express some attitude other than belief and lack the\nsort of cognitive content that would allow them to be true or\nfalse. \nFrom the start non-cognitivists have had an eye on both (i) the\nnon-cognitive attitudes that are expressed in making a moral\nclaim and (ii) what people are doing in making such claims.\nWhen focusing on the first, they emphasize that moral terms get their\nmeaning not by their link to beliefs that represent the world as being\na certain way, but by their connection to non-cognitive attitudes\n— e.g., reactions to the way the world is, or desires for how\nthe world might be. Here their attention, in giving an account of the\n“meaning” of moral terms is on those terms'\nconventionally-established connection to certain attitudes. (Of course\npeople can use such a term without actually having the corresponding\nattitudes, but understanding the term is a matter of seeing that it is\na linguistically appropriate way to express the attitude.) When\nfocusing on the second, non-cognitivists emphasize moral language's\nrole as tool for influencing the others.  Here their attention is on\nin claiming that something is, say, wrong, people are consistently not\njust expressing their opposition to it but telling others not to do\nit, or working to persuade them not to, or in some other way working\nto direct action. The two ideas go together naturally, since if the\nfirst is right, then it would help explain why people can and do use\nmoral language in the way the second suggests. But the ideas are\nseparable. And many think that the expressivist idea advanced by the\nfirst goes to the heart of the matter, while thinking that\nconcentrating on the directive or prescriptive use of moral\nlanguage can at best be secondary.         \nWhatever the details, the non-cognitivists share the idea that\none can admit that something is pleasant, or the object of a desire,\nor such that it conforms to some rule in force, and nonetheless not\ntake a stand regarding it, or not have any particular emotion\nconcerning it, or not have any interest in prescribing anything\nrelating to it. The Open Question is open, they hold, precisely\nbecause the attitudes expressed by a moral judgment all involve\nsomething other than merely believing of something that it has certain\nfeatures (whether natural or not). At the same time, the\nnon-cognitivists’ proposals fit well with granting Hume's claim\nconcerning the gap between ‘is’ and ‘ought’:\nwhatever facts one grants, whatever ‘is’ claims one\nendorses, there is no logical inconsistency involved in failing to\ntake a relevant stand, or to express a emotion towards it, or to\nprescribe something related to it. Between the beliefs we might have\nand the other attitudes we might form, no entailment relations hold at\nall.   \nNon-cognitivists, of course, need to explain why it seems so plausible\nto see moral judgment as an expression of belief and as a matter of\nattributing properties to actions, institutions and characters.  And\nthey need to explain why moral thought seems appropriately subject to\nthe rules of logic, whereas the various attitudes that play central\nroles in the non-cognitivist accounts all seem to fall outside of that\nrealm. Taking the challenge head-on, recent versions of expressivism,\nflying the banner of “quasi-realism,” have taken as a\ncentral project explaining, on non-cognitivist foundations, how and\nwhy moral language has all the trappings of being cognitivist and\nrealist.  These views start with a picture of the world as having\nneither moral properties nor people believing in moral properties\n(though they have other beliefs), and then explain how a practice of\nthinking and talking about moral properties, moral beliefs, moral\ntruth, and moral facts, might naturally and properly emerge.\nThe central idea is that we can see our thought and talk as\nfundamentally a matter of our expressing our affective attitudes or\ncommitments which gives rise to legitimate thought and talk about\ncorresponding properties, beliefs, truths and facts. Two moves\nunderwrite this idea. One is to hold that talk of properties, beliefs,\ntruths and facts comes cheap: Once one holds sincerely that\n“Lying is wrong,” no additional commitments come with\nadding “Lying has the property of being wrong” or “I\nbelieve that lying is wrong” or “It is true that lying is\nwrong” or that “It is a fact that lying is wrong.”\nThese are all, in effect, just different ways of saying the same\nthing.  And if, in the first place, sincerely saying “Lying is\nwrong” is a matter of expressing an attitude or a commitment\nthen so too are these alternative ways of saying the same thing.  The\nsecond move that underwrites quasi-realism is that the question of\nwhether the cognitivist and realist sounding discourse is legitimate\nis, itself, an evaluative question judged in light of one's attitudes\nand commitments.  There is, on this view, no independent standard of,\nsay, “matching the world” that one can deploy without, in\nchoosing that standard, expressing one's attitudes and\n commitments.[10] \n\nVarious versions of non-cognitivism, and in particular versions of\nquasi-realist expressivism, remain among the most attractive ways of\nresisting the non-naturalist implications of Moore's Open Question\nArgument.[11]\nBut they are not the only option.  Many argue that, while Moore's\nargument shows that thinking something is good is different\nthan thinking it is pleasant (or the object of a desire, or\nsuch as to conform to some norm that is in force), it does not show\nthat being good is different from being pleasant (or\nthe object of a desire, or such as to conform to some norm that is in\nforce). After all, they point out, thinking that some liquid is\nH2O is different from thinking it is water\nand one might intelligibly wonder whether what one grants to be water\nreally is H2O. Yet that does not show that being\nwater is anything other than being H20. Far\nfrom it. A difference between the thoughts does not establish a\ndifference in the properties. Thus, for all the Open Question Argument\nshows, it might turn out that a naturalist account of the nature of\nmoral properties is correct. The naturalist account cannot be defended\nsimply as a conceptual truth but it also cannot be rejected, as Moore\nthought it could be, as obviously confusing one property (the natural\nproperty) for another one (the moral property). This sort of\ncognitivism has no trouble explaining why it seems so plausible to see\nmoral judgment as an expression of belief and as a matter of\nattributing properties to actions, institutions and characters. Moral\njudgments are in fact, on this sort of account, the expression of\nbelief and they do involve attributing properties to actions,\ninstitutions and characters (though the account holds that the true\nnature of the property being attributed is something that might come\nas a surprise to some). Similarly, this sort of cognitivism can\nexplain why moral thought seems appropriately subject to the rules of\nlogic: it seems appropriately subject to these rules because it\nis. Problems emerge, however, when it comes to explaining the\napparently distinctive nature of moral thinking. If thinking that\nsomething is good or right is a matter of attributing to the thing\nsome natural property or other, then what explains the apparently\ndistinctive nature of moral thought?   \n\nCognitivists and non-cognitivists face a common challenge: to account\nfor the nature of moral thought and talk that simultaneously does\njustice to its distinctive nature without failing to appreciate the\nsignificant ways in which it is continuous with non-moral thought and\ntalk. Cognitivism has a relatively easy time accommodating the\ncontinuity between moral and non-moral thought and talk, but,\nespecially when combined with naturalism, it faces a real challenge in\nmarking the distinctive nature of moral thought and talk;\nnon-cognitivism has no trouble making room for the distinctive nature\nof moral thought and talk, but it has trouble accommodating the\ncontinuity.  \n\nWhat has always been attractive about Moorean non-naturalism is its\ncapacity to combine the continuity and the difference into a coherent\npicture. There is room, at least, to account for moral thought's\ncontinuity with other thought by emphasizing that it is all a matter\nof attributing properties (albeit different properties) to things; and\nthere is room too for locating the distinctive nature of moral thought\nin the putatively authoritative standing of the properties\nattributed. Of course leaving room for an account is not the same as\nactually providing one, and Moore himself does not actually offer much\nat all by way of an explanation of the normative authority (as we\nmight call it) of moral properties. In any case, what has always been\ntroubling about Moore's view is that the coherent picture that emerges\nseems to presuppose (i) the existence of metaphysically dubious\nproperties that fall outside the causal nexus and, so, are such that\n(ii) it would be a complete mystery how we could every reliably learn\nanything about them, if they were to exist.  Moore, and the\nintuitionists who followed him, work in various ways to address these\nconcerns. Error theorists, in contrast, hold that the coherent picture\npainted by Moore is, at least roughly, the right account of what moral\nthought and talk involves, but they go on to argue that the\nmetaphysically and epistemically troubling implications of that\npicture properly undermine its credibility.  They argue that we have\ncompelling reasons to reject the presuppositions of moral\n thought.[12] \n\nThe error theorists’ position regarding morality is the\ncounterpart, with respect to moral thought, of the atheist's position\nwith respect to views concerning God's will and ways. In both cases,\nthe suggestion is that the thoughts at issue involve a mistake or a\nfailed presupposition, and that, because of this, they cannot be\ntrue. The error theorist's position, it is worth noting, requires\nestablishing two claims that have each met a lot of resistance: that\nmoral thought really has the presuppositions the error theorist\nsupposes and that those presuppositions are as untenable as the error\ntheorist maintains. At the same time, though, anyone who hopes to\nvindicate moral thought has the burden of showing that its actual\npresuppositions and implications are, after all, defensible. \n\nAnyone mounting such a defense needs to offer some account of how it\nis we might successfully justify one set of moral judgments as over\nagainst others. When we turn to morality, what counts as good grounds\nfor holding one view rather than other?  What sort of evidence might\nbe available? If Hume and Moore are right, no evidence that appeals\nsolely to non-evaluative considerations will be sufficient (unless we\npresuppose some principle of inference that connects non-moral\npremises to moral conclusions). But if we need to rely on evaluative\npremises or principles in order to infer substantive moral conclusions\nfrom non-moral premises (e.g. non-moral premises regarding the impact\nof a course of action on pleasure or on the satisfaction of human\ninterests), the question immediately arises, “How might we\njustify these evaluative premises or principles?”  \n\nOne answer often offered is that, at a suitably abstract level, there\nare premises or principles that everyone in fact accepts.  Perhaps\n'Murder is wrong', or 'pain is bad', or 'everyone should be treated\nequally', would qualify. But of course such claims hardly do much work\nsince questions immediately arise about which killings constitute\nmurder and about how different pains should be compared and about\nwhich way of treating people counts as treating them equally in the\nrelevant way. No moral claim that is plausibly offered as actually\naccepted by all, or nearly all, people can possibly be substantive\nenough to help settle on one view rather than another as better\njustified.  \n\nOne might, in light of this, offer a more substantive principle, not\nas one that people actually all accept, but as one that they are all,\nin fact, committed to (though they may not realize it). This strategy\noffers the prospect of identifying a principle rich enough in content\nto serve as the justifying ground for other moral judgments. Yet it\nrequires showing how the principle(s) identified work to justify the\nmore specific judgments they are meant to support.  Moreover, one who\ntakes this approach needs also to justify the claim that people are\nactually committed to the principle in the first place. And this\nraises the suspicion that claiming there are certain principles to\nwhich everyone is committed simply relocates the original challenge,\nwithout actually meeting it.  \n\nIn any case, even if there are suitably substantive principles to\nwhich people are committed, and this can be shown, and even if there\nis a way to establish as well that the principles in question would\n(if right) actually justify more specific moral judgments, one might\nunderstandably worry about the status of the resulting structure. Why\nnot think of it as a castle in the sky, a structure with no\nappropriate foundation?  After all, the fact that we happen to accept,\nor are committed to accepting, some principle, seems a long way from\nshowing that the principle is true or right.  \n\nOur moral judgments (about particular cases as well as about general\nprinciples) seem to float disconcertingly free from our normal sources\nof evidence concerning the nature of the world. We cannot see, touch,\ntaste, or smell value or rightness or virtue, even as we can see,\ntouch, taste, or smell some of the things that have value or that are\nright or that manifest virtue. So how do we learn about value and\nrightness and virtue themselves?  What grounds do we have for thinking\nour various moral judgments link up appropriately with what they are\njudgments of? \n\nOf course moral judgments are not the only judgments that face such a\nchallenge. Many mathematical, modal, and religious judgments face a\nsimilar challenge. They all apparently concern matters that are not\ndirectly available to the senses and that are, in various ways,\nmysterious. That establishes some companions in guilt, but also\nprovides the hope that reasonable accounts of how we might learn (or\nnot) about numbers, possibility and necessity, and God, might provide\ninsight into the evidence (if any) we are able to secure concerning\nmorality.  \n\nIt is worth emphasizing that positive theories of moral epistemology\nare inevitably bound up with accounts of the nature of moral judgment\nand their metaphysical presuppositions and commitments. On some\naccounts, there is nothing to know and so no need for an\nepistemological theory at all. On others, a proper understanding of\nmoral judgments will reveal that justifying them is of a piece with\njustifying other judgments for which we have, or hope to have, a\nplausible epistemology, so the epistemology of morality will be\ncontinuous with epistemological theories of other domains. On still\nother accounts, moral judgments are such that only a sui\ngeneris epistemology would make sense of our capacity to acquire\nmoral knowledge. No matter which of these options one takes,\nepistemological skepticism looms as a real possibility. And in the\nfirst case, where there is by implication nothing to know, it does not\nmerely loom, it arrives inevitably.  Even if one succeeds in\ndeveloping a positive theory of moral epistemology in light of which\nmoral knowledge might be possible, the substantive challenge of\nshowing that knowledge has actually been secured remains\nformidable. \n\nAt the same time, much of morality seems clearly a matter of knowing\nhow — how to respond to the need of others, how to\nrespond to threats, how to carry oneself in various situations —\nand not primarily (if at all) a matter of knowing that\nsomething is the case. No doubt, focusing on knowing how, rather than\nknowing that, does not address skepticism concerning the claims we\nmight make as to which know how is morally significant. But paying\nattention to the degree to which people count as moral (or immoral)\nnot because of what they say or believe, but because of how they act,\nis important to appreciating both the nature of morality and what all\na plausible account of moral knowledge must encompass. \n\nAmong morality's distinctive features, all agree, is its apparently\nintimate connection to action. In making moral judgments, for\ninstance, we seem to be making a claim that, if true, establishes that\nsomeone or other has a reason to act or be a certain way. This marks\nan important difference between moral claims and claims concerning,\nsay, color. The claim that something is red is, even if true, only\ncontingently connected to whether anyone has any reason at all to act\nor be a certain way.  Whereas if a certain thing is morally good it\nseems that everyone necessarily has at least some reason (perhaps\noverrideable or defeasible, but still some reason) to promote, pursue,\nprotect, or respect it — at least if they recognize that it is\ngood.  Moreover, many have thought, to judge sincerely that something\nis good (whether or not one is right) is to have some motivation\n(again, perhaps overrideable or defeasible, but still some motivation)\nto promote, pursue, protect, or respect it.  \n\nThus there seem to be necessary connections between moral properties\nand reasons and also between moral judgments and motivations. Some\nhave thought as well that there is a necessary connection between\nmoral judgments and reasons, such that if one judges that something is\ngood or right then (whether one is right or not) one had a reason to\nact or be a certain way. Others have thought that there is a\nconnection, again, a necessary connection, between there being a\nreason for someone to act or be a certain way and that person being,\nor at least being able to be, motivated in a\n certain\n way.[13] \nThis last suggestion, that (say) one can have reason to do only what\none might be motivated to do, has implications as well for what might\ncount as good, if something is good only if one has a reason to act in\na certain way with respect to\n it.[14] \n\nEach of these supposed necessary connections is controversial and yet\neach has plausibly been taken to be at the heart of what is\ndistinctive about morality. At the same time, different proposed\nconnections fit more or less well with different accounts of morality\nand at least some of the supposed connections are flat out\nincompatible with some of the accounts. Thus those versions of\nnon-cognitivism that see making a moral judgment as a matter of\nexpressing some motivating attitude have an easier time explaining the\ninternal connection (if there is one) between sincerely making a moral\njudgment and having an appropriate motive, while certain naturalist\ncognitivist proposals, for instance those that identify goodness with\nhaving the capacity to garner approval from someone who is fully\ninformed, must hold that a person might sincerely judge that something\nwould secure that approval and yet be utterly unmotivated by that\n fact.[15] \n\nWorking through the ways in which a proper appreciation of the\nrelations between morality, reasons, and motivation constrain and\ninform an account of morality has been a central issue in\nmetaethics. In fact, Glaucon's original proposal concerning the nature\nof morality (according to which morality is a conventional solution to\nproblems we would otherwise have to face) was introduced as a way of\npressing a worry about morality: Morality pretends to provide reason\nto all, virtue is supposed to be its own reward, and a person is told\nshe should do the right thing because it is right and not because she\nhopes for some reward, yet, in the face of the demands morality\nsometimes makes, these claims concerning its nature and value all seem\ndubious. Specifically, if morality is (as Glaucon's proposal would\nhave it) constituted solely by a set of conventional rules we put in\nplace to secure the benefits we receive from the restraint of others,\nit looks as if the only reason (and the only motive) we would each\nhave for conforming to the rules would be found in the consequences we\nhope such compliance would secure.  In cases where we could get the\nbenefits without the restraint (as when our failure to restrain\nourselves would be undetected) we would have neither reason nor motive\nnot to violate the rules. Thus, if Glaucon is right about the nature\nof morality, then morality (properly understood) would only provide\nreason to some, under some circumstances, not reason to all,\nalways. Moreover, virtue would not be its own reward. And morality\nwould not be such that it would make sense for a person to do the\nright thing (as defined by the rules in place) for its own sake, since\nthe sole value of the relevant rules is found in the benefits that\ncome from others complying with those rules. \n\nGlaucon's ultimate aim was to get from Socrates an account of morality\nthat — unlike his own — would serve to vindicate\nmorality's pretensions. He assumed that if no such account was\nforthcoming morality's claim on our allegiance would have been\nundermined even as we might continue to have our own reasons for\nperpetuating the myth and for working to see that others comply with\nits rules. Much of the Republic is then given over to\nSocrates’ attempt to develop first an account of the nature of\nmorality (specifically, of justice) and then, second, to arguing that\nbeing moral is valuable regardless of the consequences. Socrates'\nconcern, in showing that being moral is valuable, is to show\nspecifically that it is valuable to the person who is moral, that the\nvirtuous person, and not just others, benefits from her\nvirtue. Indeed, he tries to show that being moral is so valuable to\nthe person who is moral, that whatever the consequences of injustice\nmight be, however great the rewards, they could never be valuable\nenough to outweigh the loss of one's virtue.  \n\nSocrates’ own account of the metaphysical and epistemological\nunderpinnings of his view (his appeal to eternal, non-physical\nPlatonic Forms and to our intellectual access to those Forms) commits\nhim unmistakably to non-naturalism and to something like\nintuitionism. Yet his account of the nature of justice and the\nspecific features of justice that he takes to establish its value, all\nappeal to considerations that are as available to a naturalist as to a\nnon-naturalist.  \n\nIn any case, the question underlying Glaucon's concern — Why\nshould I be moral? — has consistently been at the center of\nattempts to explain the connection between morality and what we have\nreason to\n do.[16] \n Some have argued that the question is\nmisplaced, at least if it assumes there must be some non-moral reason\nto be moral. Others have held that the question is easily answered\non the grounds that the fact that some action is morally required, for\ninstance, entails that one has reason to do it. And still others\nhave maintained that the question presses the single most important\nchallenge to morality's legitimacy, since morality's claim\non our allegiance depends on our having reason to comply with its\ndemands, yet explaining why we might have those reasons is\nextraordinarily difficult.  \n\nWhatever view one ends up adopting concerning the connections that\nhold (or do not hold) among moral properties, moral judgments, reasons\nfor action, and effective motivations, no account is plausible as a\nvindication of morality unless it makes sense of how and why moral\nconsiderations might properly figure in practical deliberation that\nresults in decision and action. Doing this successfully is, in\nprinciple, compatible with thinking moral properties do not always\nprovide reasons, compatible too with holding that moral judgments some\ntimes fail to motivate, and, finally, compatible as well with the idea\nthat one might have a reason to perform some action that one has no\nmotivation to perform. Of course, these various views are each\nthemselves quite controversial and involve rejecting what others have\nthought to be necessary truths.   \n\nMaking sense of how moral considerations might figure in practical\ndeliberation is especially important when it comes to explaining when\nand why people are responsible for what they do or fail to do.  Some\nof that explanatory job is a matter of moral theory, not metaethics,\nand involves figuring out what counts as good excuses, legitimate\njustifications, and appropriate burdens. A theory of moral\nresponsibility inevitably relies on substantive moral theory. \n\nYet there are important metaethical issues bound up in giving an\naccount of moral responsibility. They emerge most sharply as one\nconsiders the nature and significance of free will. Does\nresponsibility presuppose free will?  If so, when does someone count\nas having a free will?  It cannot merely be a matter of her will being\nuncaused. After all, a person whose will was utterly random,\nresponsive neither to her nor to the reasons she had for doing things,\nwould be a person no freer (in the relevant sense) than a person whose\nwill was fully and directly controlled by someone else as a puppeteer\nmight control a puppet. What would it take for her will to count as\nappropriately responsive, either to her or to her reasons?  Is this\nappropriate responsiveness a matter of being undetermined or of being\ndetermined by the right things or in the right way?  In any case, if\none has the sort of free will that moral responsibility requires\n(whatever that turns out to be) how are we to understand the\nconnection between the will, and what influences it, on the one hand,\nand the various psychological and physical causes that apparently\ndetermine the behavior that is identified as the action one performs\nwillingly, on the other? How do agents with a free will fit within a\nnatural world? \n\nNot surprisingly, the range of answers that have been offered to these\nquestions covers an exceedingly broad spectrum. Some hold that moral\nresponsibility requires a certain kind of freedom and then argue that\nwe lack that sort of freedom or, alternatively, that we at least\nsometimes have it. Others, though, maintain that freedom is irrelevant\nand that holding people morally responsible makes sense only if we see\ntheir wills as determined. And others identify a truly free will not\nwith a will that is undetermined, but with one that is determined by\nreason. And still others argue that the right understanding of moral\nresponsibility will show that metaphysical questions concerning the\nnature of the will are irrelevant.   \n\nThe history of moral theory is a history of attempts to identify,\narticulate, and defend general moral principles that serve to explain\nwhen and why various types of action, institutions, or characters\ncount as right or wrong, just or unjust, virtuous or vicious. The\nassumption has consistently been that there is a general and\nprincipled account of morality to be given. And this assumption has\nsurvived the fact that few people think any particular set of\nprinciples that we have actually succeeded in articulating, is fully\nadequate.  What explains the assumption?  Why not hold, as\nparticularists do, that there may well be no set of general principles\nthat adequately mark moral distinctions?  Or, why not think, as\nskeptics do, that our repeated failures actually to identify fully\nadequate principles shows that morality is a chimera?  \n\nWrestling with these questions returns one immediately and directly to\nwondering about the nature of morality and the role it is supposed to\nplay in human life. What is it about morality's nature, or its role,\nthat would make sense of the idea that general principles are\nessential to it?  Why not suppose that one case of cruelty might be\nwrong, and another not wrong, without there being any ground that\nwould justify treating them as different?  Why is it so natural to\nsuppose that there must be some other difference — say a\ndifference in their consequences, or a difference in what has led up\nto the act of cruelty — that underwrites and justifies the\nthought that one is wrong, but not the other?  Why not grant that one\nof the two just happened to be wrong and the other happened not to be?\nCould not moral properties just happen to have been distributed\nrandomly so that, in the end, there is no justification for one action\nhaving a certain moral standing while another, otherwise the same, has\na different standing?  These suggested possibilities are, I believe,\nnot real possibilities at all. They would each entail that moral\ndemands are fundamentally arbitrary in a way that is incompatible with\nmorality's claim to authority. But what is it about morality that\nprecludes it being fundamentally arbitrary?  A good answer, I suspect,\nwill lead one away from the idea that moral properties are merely\nthere in the world to be found, wholly independent of our concerns and\npractices. But a good answer is needed.  And a good answer is not\nprovided simply by supplying, if one could, a consistent and coherent\nset of principles that successfully systematized particular moral\njudgments about acts, institutions, and characters.  The challenge\nhere is not simply to show that moral judgments can be seen to fit a\npattern; the challenge is to show that the pattern they fit —\nthe principle(s) to which they conform — work to explain and\njustify their importance.\n   ","contact.mail":"sayre-mccord@unc.edu","contact.domain":"unc.edu"}]
