Lewis was perhaps the most important American\nacademic philosopher active in the 1930s and 1940s. He made major\ncontributions in epistemology and logic, and, to a lesser degree,\nethics. Lewis was also a key figure in the rise of analytic philosophy\nin the United States, both through the development and influence of\nhis own writings and through his influence, direct and indirect, on\ngraduate students at Harvard, including some of the leading analytic\nphilosophers of the last half of the 20th century.\n\nC.I. Lewis was born on April 12, 1883 in Stoneham, Massachusetts and\ndied on February 2, 1964 in Menlo Park, California. He was an\nundergraduate at Harvard from 1902–1906, where he was influenced\nprincipally by the pragmatist, William James, and the idealist, Josiah\nRoyce. Royce also supervised Lewis’s 1910 Harvard Ph.D.\ndissertation “ The Place of Intuition in Knowledge”. While\nserving as Royce’s teaching assistant in logic, Lewis read\nWhitehead’s and Russell’s Principia Mathematica,\na book he both admired and criticized. Later, while teaching at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley from 1911–1920, his\nprincipal research interests switched to logic. Lewis wrote a series\nof articles on symbolic logic culminating in his 1918 monograph A\nSurvey of Symbolic Logic (SSL) (Lewis 1918) in which he both\nsurveyed developments in symbolic logic from Leibniz up to his own day\nand presented his own modal system of strict implication. However, in\nresponse to criticism of his account of strict implication, Lewis\ndeleted these sections from reprints of SSL and revised his treatment\nof their topics for his co-authored 1932 book Symbolic Logic\n(SL) (Lewis and Langford 1932) — “the first comprehensive\ntreatment of systems of strict implication (or indeed of systems of\nmodal logic at all)”, according to Hughes and Cresswell (1968,\n216).  \nLewis returned to Harvard in 1920, where he taught until his\nretirement in 1953, becoming Edgar Peirce Professor of Philosophy in\n1948. At Harvard, Lewis’ major research interest switched back\nto epistemology. Starting with his much reprinted 1923 article,\n“A Pragmatic Conception of the A Priori” (Lewis\n1923), he developed a distinctive position of his own which he labeled\n“conceptual pragmatism” and which he presented in a\nsystematic way in his 1929 book Mind and the World Order\n(MWO) (Lewis 1929). MWO established Lewis as a major figure on the\nAmerican philosophical scene. In the 1930s and 1940s, partly in\nresponse to the challenge of positivism, the form and focus of\nLewis’ views changed, and, arguably, in subtle ways, some of the\nsubstance. In his 1946 book Analysis of Knowledge and\nValuation (AKV), based on his 1944 Carus lectures, Lewis (1946)\nprovided a systematic and carefully analytic presentation of his\nmature philosophical views. The first two thirds of the book consist\nof a thorough refinement and more precise presentation of his theory\nof meaning and of his epistemological views, and the last third\nconsists of a presentation of his theory of value. \nAfter retirement from Harvard, Lewis taught and lectured at a number\nof universities, including Princeton, Columbia, Indiana, Michigan\nState, and Southern California, but principally at Stanford. His 1954\nWoodbridge Lectures at Columbia and 1956 Mahlon Powell Lectures at\nIndiana resulted in two last short books in ethics, The Ground and\nthe Nature of the Right (Lewis 1955) and Our Social\nInheritance (Lewis 1957). Lewis was the subject of a posthumously\npublished “Library of Living Philosophers” volume (Schilpp\n1968) in which, unfortunately, his replies to critics were limited by\nillness, but which, nonetheless, was an honour that indicates his\nstanding in and perceived significance for American philosophy in the\n1950s.  \nIn his over thirty years at Harvard, Lewis taught some of the most\neminent American philosophers of the last half of the twentieth\ncentury as graduate students, including W.V. Quine, Nelson Goodman,\nRoderick Chisholm, Roderick Firth, and Wilfrid Sellars. Although only\nChisholm and Firth of these five were supervised by Lewis, and Sellars\nleft Harvard without graduating, all five refer occasionally to Lewis\nin their writings, usually critically, and their own views sometimes\ndeveloped in reaction to his. (Baldwin 2007 has an excellent\ndiscussion of the influence of Lewis on Quine, and of Lewis’s\nphilosophy generally.) \nIn MWO, Lewis (1929, Chp. 1) argued that the proper method of\nphilosophy isn’t transcendental but reflective. Philosophy seeks\nto elicit the criteria or principles of the real, the right, the\nbeautiful, and the logically valid that are implicit in human\nexperience, thought, and activity.  \nLewis (1929, 37–8) believed that, on reflection and analysis, we\ncan distinguish three elements in perceptual knowledge: (1) the given\nor immediate data of sense, (2) the act of interpreting the given as\nan experience of one sort of thing as opposed to another, and (3) the\nconcept by which we so interpret the given by relating it to other\npossibilities of experience. Our experience of the real is not given\nto us in experience but is constructed by us from the data of sense\nthrough acts of interpretation. When I know that I am looking at a\ntable and reflect on my experience, I realize, on analysis, that there\nare certain highly specific sensuous qualities presented to me that I\nam immediately aware of. Moreover, I realize that, in the light of\nthis and other experiences I recall, I expect, with some likelihood, I\nwould have certain other experiences, e.g. of feeling something\napparently hard, were I to have the experience of performing certain\nacts, e.g. of reaching out with my hand. In doing so, it is the\nconcept of seeing a table that I am applying to my experience rather\nthan that of seeing a horse or that of hallucinating a table, either\nof which would have involved different expectations of experience\nconsequent upon action. Only an active being can therefore have\nknowledge, and the principal function of empirical knowledge “is\nthat of an instrument enabling transition from the actual present to a\nfuture which is desired and which the present is believed to\nsignalize” (Lewis 1946, 4). \nStatements expressing our beliefs about reality are translatable into,\nand thus entail and are entailed by, an indefinitely large set of\ncounterfactual statements about what experiences we would have or\nwould be likely to have, were we to be presented with certain sensory\ncues and were we to carry out further tests (Lewis 1929, 142; 1946,\n180, 208). Objectively, what we actually experience may depend on the\nphysical circumstances of perception, e.g. lighting conditions, and\nthe bodily actions we perform, e.g. moving our eyes, as well, of\ncourse, as the character of objects in our environment. However, what\nmatters ultimately for the meaning and confirmation of statements\nabout objective reality, as Lewis makes clear in AKV, are only the\n“felt experience” of action and the directly presentable\nsense experiences contained in sensory cues and forming the\nexperiential circumstances of action (Lewis 1946, 178–9,\n245–6), as well, of course, as the directly presentable sense\nexperiences they lead us to expect. The idea of a reality neither\nconfirmable nor disconfirmable in principle by experience was thus for\nLewis without meaning. What distinguished his view, he thought, from\nthe superficially similar verification principle of meaning of the\nlogical positivists was his emphasis on the mediating role of agency\n(Lewis 1941a, in Lewis 1970, 94).  \nWhether our objective beliefs are true depends on their verifiable or\nconfirmable implications for future possible experience. However, in\norder to guide action effectively now while saving us from the hazards\nof action without foresight, empirical belief and its expectations for\nexperience must be justified (rationally credible, warranted) now,\nantecedent to future verification (Lewis 1946, 254–7).\nJustification, as opposed to verification, is the focus of AKV much\nmore so than MWO. Nonetheless, throughout Lewis’ career from MWO\nto the end, there are common claims. First, empirical knowledge\n(rationally credible, justified, or warranted belief) is probable\nknowledge or belief. Second, probability is a logical or inferential\nrelation between a conclusion or a belief and its premises or grounds.\nThird, the ultimate premises or grounds relative to which a conclusion\nor belief is probable, as opposed to more immediate or proximate ones,\ncannot themselves be probable but must be certain (Lewis 1929,\n328–9, 340–1; Lewis 1946, 186–7; Lewis 1952a). \nThe direct apprehension of immediately given sense presentations, and\nstatements expressing them, are incorrigible, indubitable, not in need\nof verification, and not subject to error, and so, in these various\n(and distinct) senses, “certain”. (For a useful discussion\nof senses of “certainty” in Lewis, see Firth 1964 and\nFirth 1968 in Schilpp 1968.) However, with no possibility of error or\nincorrectness to contrast with the immediate awareness of the given,\nLewis decides the normative label “knowledge”\nshouldn’t really be applied to it. Our objective interpretations\nof experience, on the other hand, are not only fallible—given\nand recalled experience doesn’t guarantee the satisfaction of\nour expectations about future experience--but are always subject to\nrevision in the light of action and further experience. Past\nexperience and our recollection of it play a key role in the\ncredibility of these interpretations. In MWO, Lewis (1929, 337) says\nthat memory itself is an interpretation of given present recollection,\nand, as such, probable knowledge with testable or verifiable\nimplications for future experience. However, this doesn’t\nexplain what warrants the interpretation and its expectations, a\nlacuna AKV corrects. Knowing for Lewis occurs in a\nnon-instananeous “epistemological present” of sense\npresentation embedded in a mass of recollections or sense of past\nexperience (Lewis 1946, 331). What is given and indubitably certain in\nthis present are these sense presentations and these rememberings\n(Lewis 1946, 354, 362)), but what we recall of past experience is\nprima facie and non-inductively credible for us, just because\nso ostensibly remembered or recalled (Lewis 1946, 334), and thus can\nserve to make our expectations of future experience rationally\ncredible as well.  \nDespite their lack of theoretical certainty, the beliefs we form by\napplying concepts to experience may count as knowledge so long as they\nare true and sufficiently warranted or justified. The members of a set\nof beliefs that already have some degree of confirmation or antecedent\nprobability in relation to present and past experience may become even\nmore credible if the antecedent probability of any one would be\nincreased by assuming the others as given (Lewis 1946, 187, 338, 349,\n351, 352). The congruence of a mature system of beliefs which exhibits\nthis complex interlocking pattern of probability relations to each\nother and to experience helps to explain how many of these beliefs can\nrise to the standards for knowledge and be practically certain enough\nto be counted on in action.  \nOrdinary beliefs and interpretations, including perceptual beliefs,\nare, for Lewis, typically the product of habit or association in which\nwe are guided by the elements of the given in the epistemological\npresent but rarely if ever attend to them. Nonetheless, the\njustification of these beliefs as rationally credible requires that\nthere be an inferential or logical relationship of a belief or a\nstatement of it to grounds or reasons in experience that constitute\nevidence, largely inductive, for it (Lewis 1946, 315, Lewis 1952a,\nreprinted in Lewis 1970, 326). For Lewis, “the critical question\nfor the validity of empirical knowledge is not whether grounds\nsufficient for the justification of the belief are actually contained\nin the explicit psychological state of the believer, but whether the\nknower’s situation in empirical belief is such that sufficient\ngrounds could be elicited upon inquiry, or whether it is such that\nthis is even theoretically impossible” (Lewis 1946, 330).\nRestricting the term “knowledge” to cases where grounds\nare explicit would “be so rigoristic as to exclude most, if not\nall, of our attempted cognitions and would obscure the important\ndistinction of practically valuable knowledge from\n‘ignorance’ and from ‘error’” (Lewis\n1946, 330), just as restricting the term to what we are certain of\nwould. Nor should we think that the act of reflecting on and eliciting\nwhat in the epistemological present justifies our beliefs loses or\ntakes us beyond the epistemological present (Lewis 1946, 330–2),\nand thus is an impossible ideal.  \nIn MWO Lewis argues that probable empirical knowledge requires, on\npain of infinite regress, some a priori knowledge of analytic\nprinciples explicating our concepts, the logical relationships among\nthem, and the criteria for applying them to experience and determining\nwhat is real and what isn’t real. Moreover, this knowledge must\nbe “more than probable” and “certain”, which\nsuggests that they have a degree of warrant greater than the degree of\nprobability empirical considerations could yield (Lewis 1929,\n311–12, 317, 321). In AKV, he also says that mathematical and\nlogical cognitions “may be certain” (Lewis, 1946, 29), at\nleast in certain cases, but he worries how they can refer to anything\nbeyond the cognition itself, and be classified as knowledge, if their\ntruth is simply the unthinkability of their falsity, given our\nconcepts or way of thinking. The answer is that we can be mistaken\nabout what is implicit in our concepts. We can fail to observe what is\nimplicit in our concepts and what their adoption consistently commits\nus to in our thinking, and that contrast with error allows him to\nclassify a priori apprehension as knowledge. Nonetheless, any\nof these mistakes is “intrinsically possible of correction\nmerely by taking thought of the matter” (Lewis 1946, 155)\nwithout empirical investigation. The correctness of the principles\ngoverning our concepts can be known a priori, independently\nof confirmation in experience, in so far as they can be certified or\nassured simply by analysis of meaning or reflection on the content of\nour concepts and our explicative principles (Lewis 1946, 151,165). So,\nquite apart from issues about certainty, the degree to which we are\nwarranted in our a priori apprehensions needn’t\ncorrespond to and isn’t a function of their probability on the\ntotal set of empirical considerations (cf. Lewis 1926, reprinted in\nLewis 1970, 243–4).  \nWhat then is tested and confirmed or disconfirmed by experience is the\ninterpretation of experience in the light of our concepts, ordinary\nempirical concepts like dog as well as more abstract categories like\ncausality or the concepts of logic. What isn’t tested by\nexperience is the validity of the concepts themselves, or the logical\nrelationships amongst them, or the principles for applying them.\nAgents bring them to experience and the only criteria they answer to\nare pragmatic ones of utility or convenience (Lewis 1929,\n271–2).That implies that they are also revisable on pragmatic\ngrounds, as Lewis himself recognizes he is doing to some extent with\nthe concept of knowledge itself (Lewis 1946, 27–29, 183) .  \nRight at the heart of Lewis’ philosophical system, then, are\nseveral theses that weren’t original to Lewis, but the critical\ndiscussion (and sometimes rejection) of which, often in the form Lewis\ngave to them, was central to much analytic philosophy in the last half\nof the twentieth century. Among them are: (1) a sharp\nanalytic/synthetic, a priori/ a posteriori distinction, (2)\nreductionism concerning the meaning of a physical object statement to\nthe actual and possible sense experiences that would confirm the\nstatement, (3) a foundation for all empirical knowledge in our direct\napprehension or immediate awareness of the given character of\nexperience and our recollections of it, and (4) the division of\nexperience into its given content or character, on the one hand, and\nthe form we impose on it, or the concepts in the light of which we\ninterpret it, on the other. (Quine (1951 [1953]) famously called (1)\nand (2) the “two dogmas of empiricism”; Sellars (1963)\ncalled (3) the “myth of the given”; and Davidson\n(1973–1974 [1984]) called (4) the “third dogma of\nempiricism”, although in Lewis’ mind (4) may owe more to\nKant—on whom Lewis taught a course regularly at\nHarvard—than to the empiricists.) \nAt the same time, Lewis (1946, 9–11, 254–9) also laid down\na framework of assumptions, most explicitly in AKV, within which\nanalytic epistemology flourished in the last half of the\n20th century: (1) knowledge is sufficiently justified\n(warranted, rationally credible) true belief , (2) a belief may be\njustified without being true and true without being justified, and (3)\nepistemology seeks to elicit criteria or principles of justification\nor rationally credibility.  \nIn SSL Lewis (1918) surveyed and discussed developments in symbolic\nlogic from Leibniz to his own day and followed his discussion of\nsystems of material implication with a penultimate chapter presenting\nhis own system of strict implication (omitted from the 1960 Dover\nreprint). In the concluding chapter (also omitted from the 1960 Dover\nreprint), Lewis distinguished three possible types of “logistic\nprocedure” and resultant system (Lewis 1918, 354–62,\n367–72). The first restricts proofs in mathematics to special\ncases of the propositions of symbolic logic, but grants branches of\nmathematics their own primitive or undefined ideas and postulates\ndistinct from those of symbolic logic. The second goes further,\nreducing mathematics to symbolic logic by defining or analyzing the\nideas and postulates of the former in terms of those of the latter.\nHowever, the third “heterodox” or “external”\nconception of mathematics – “mathematics without\nmeaning” – treats mathematical and logical systems alike\nas purely formal, abstract systems performing operations on\nrecognizable ideographic marks and strings of marks in ways that are\nindependent of what they denote or mean, or even the type of thing\nthey are interpreted as standing for, e.g. concept or proposition, and\nthus independent of the truth of strings of marks. What matters\ninstead are simply the types of order and relation with which\nrecognizable marks or complexes of marks are distributed and\n“extra-logical” rules or principles for manipulating them,\nlike the consistent substitution of marks for marks within a string of\nmarks. Post (1921) credited Lewis as the first to make substitution an\nexplicit rule for logic, whether under an orthodox conception as with\nhis system of strict implication (Lewis 1918, 295) between\npropositions, or under a heterodox conception concerning recognizable\nmarks and their order (Lewis 1918, 355,358), and cited Lewis’\ndiscussion of the heterodox conception as a stimulus for his own\nformalist research. \nLewis was dissatisfied with the extensional truth functional logic\nPrincipia Mathematica, and with its understanding of\nimplication as material implication, according to which the truth of\nthe if-then conditional \\(p \\supset q\\) expressing the\nmaterial implication of \\(q\\) by \\(p\\) is a function just of\nthe truth or falsity of \\(p\\) and \\(q. p \\supset q\\) is equivalent to \\({\\sim}(p \\amp{\\sim}q)\\) and is\ntrue just in case it isn’t the case both that \\(p\\) is true\nand \\(q\\) is false. As a result, among the theses of\nPrincipia Mathematica are \\(p \\supset(q \\supset p)\\) and \\({\\sim}p \\supset(p \\supset q)\\). In\nother words, a true proposition, whatever it happens to be, is implied\nby any proposition whatsoever, true or false, and a false proposition,\nwhatever it happens to be, implies any proposition whatsoever, true or\nfalse. Lewis didn’t deny these theses, properly understood\nrelative to the definition of material implication. However, he did\nthink that these so-called “paradoxes of material\nimplication” meant that material implication doesn’t\nprovide a proper understanding of any ordinary notion of implication,\naccording to which one proposition implies another just in case the\nlatter logically follows from and is deducible from the former. \nTo explicate this notion he defined strict implication, according to\nwhich the if-then conditional \\(p \\fishhook q\\)\nexpressing the strict implication of \\(q\\) by \\(p\\) is\nequivalent to \\({\\sim}\\Diamond(p \\amp{\\sim}q)\\), and is true just\nin case it is not possible that \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is\nfalse. Strict implication is an intensional notion, and the logic of\nstrict implication is a form of modal logic. The system of strict\nimplication developed in SSL (Lewis 1918) was distinguished from\nearlier modal logics by its axiomatic presentation in the light of the\nwork of Whitehead and Russell. However, Lewis faced a number of\ncriticisms, including one by Emil Post that one of Lewis’\npostulates led to the result that it was indeed impossible that\n\\(p\\) just in case it was false that \\(p\\), so that\nLewis’ SSL system reduced to an extensional one. Lewis (Lewis\nand Langford 1932) eliminated these problems in SL and provided\ndistinct systems of strict implication or modal logic, S1–S5,\neach stronger than its predecessor (with S3 the system of SSL). S1\ncontained the following axioms: \nS2 adds to S1 the consistency postulate \nwhich allows one to show that if \\(p \\fishhook q\\) is a\ntheorem, then so is \\({\\sim}\\Diamond{\\sim}p \\fishhook{\\sim}\\Diamond{\\sim}q\\),\ni.e., \\(\\Box p \\fishhook \\Box q\\), expressing the\nstrict implication of the necessity of \\(q\\) by the necessity of\n\\(p\\). S3 adds to S1 the postulate \nS4 adds to S1 the iterative axiom: \nS5 adds to S1 the iterative axiom: \nCritics objected that strict implication posed its own alleged\nparadoxes. Within Lewis’ systems S2–S5, a necessarily true\nproposition is strictly implied by any proposition whatsoever, and a\nnecessarily false proposition strictly implies any proposition\nwhatsoever. However, Lewis (Lewis and Langford 1932) replied in SL\nthat these alleged paradoxes are simply the result of entirely natural\nassumptions about valid deductive inference and entailment quite apart\nfrom the systems of strict implication, and thus are not a problem for\nthe claim that strict implication provides an explication of\ndeducibility and entailment. (The presentation in this and the\nprevious two paragraphs owes much to the excellent account and\ndiscussion of Lewis’ systems of strict implication in Hughes and\nCresswell (1968, Chapters 12–13).) \nLewis thought that there are an unlimited number of possible systems\nof logic. One example is the extensional propositional calculus of\nPrincipia according to which there are two truth values, true\nand false; other examples are the various systems of many valued logic\nthat Lewis surveyed in SL, and, of course, Lewis’ own various\nmodal systems S1–S5. Lewis thought that each of these systems is\nvalid so long as it is internally consistent. The principles of the\nvarious alternatives simply define the meaning of the logical concepts\nand operators such as negation, truth/falsity, disjunction,\nimplication, and thus they are all true (Lewis 1932, in Lewis 1970,\n401). Bivalent systems simply have a different notion of truth and\nfalsity from non-bivalent ones. Nonetheless, some systems may accord\nbetter than others with notions of truth or implication or deduction\nthat are implicit in our everyday reasoning. Logics can thus be\nassessed pragmatically by their sufficiency for the guidance and\ntesting of our usual deductions, systematic simplicity and\nconvenience, and accord with our psychological limitations and mental\nhabits. However, Lewis denied that he was claiming that principles of\nlogic could be true without being necessarily true, or necessarily\ntrue without being necessarily necessary. A logic in which\n\\(\\Box p \\fishhook \\Box \\Box p\\) holds simply\noperates with a different notion of necessity from one in which it\ndoesn’t. \nLewis (1946, Chps. 3, 6) distinguished several modes of meaning in\nAKV. The denotation of a term is the class of actual things\nto which the term applies and is distinct from the\ncomprehension — the class of possible or consistently\nthinkable things to which it applies. The signification of a\nterm is the property the presence of which in a thing makes the term\napplicable, and the intension or connotation of a\nterm is what is applicable to any possible thing to which the term is\napplicable. Intension can be linguistic intension or meaning, in which\ncase it is the conjunction of terms applicable to any possible thing\nto which the term is applicable and thus substitutable for the term\nsalva veritate. However, since definitions must have criteria\nof application and these must ultimately be non-circular, the more\nbasic dimension of intension is sense meaning. Sense meaning\nis the criterion in mind in terms of sense experience for classifying\nobjects and applying a term-- a schema or rule that speakers have in\nmind whereby a term applies to an actual or thinkable thing or\nsignifies some property, and which would exist even if there were no\nlinguistic expression for it. \nSince linguistic intension is implicitly holistic and verbal\ndefinition eventually circular, Lewis (1929, 107) said in MWO that\nlogical analysis isn’t reduction to primitive terms, but is a\nmatter of relating terms to each other. Concepts consist in relational\nstructures of meaning. They require criteria of application in\nexperience and the total meaning of a term for an individual consists\nof the concept it expresses and the sensory criteria for its\napplication. Yet, the latter needn’t be identical across\nindividuals for there to be common concepts, Lewis argued (1929, 115).\nInstead, common concepts just require shared structures of linguistic\ndefinition and common or congruent modes of behaviour, in particular\nco-operative behaviour that is guided by these concepts, a social\nachievement of a common world that Lewis thought our community of\nneeds and interests produces. One problem with this suggestion was\npointed out by Quine (1960) in Word and Object with his\nindeterminacy of translation argument. From the standpoint of an\ninterpreter, there can be alternative translation manuals or schemes\nthat are consistent with the total set of a speaker’s verbal and\nother behavioural dispositions. This is a problem that Lewis (1946,\n144–5, 164) may have been aware of in AKV. In any case, in AKV\nhe seems to draw back from the discussion of common concepts in MWO\nand to rest content with pointing out that any attribution of\nlinguistic meaning or sense meaning to another is inductive and thus\nonly probable, and any attribution of linguistic or sense meaning\nsimilar to ours is likewise inductive, fallible, and problematic. \nLewis (1946, 84–5, 93–5) drew a sharp distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic truth. Analytic (or analytically true)\nstatements are true by virtue of the definition of the terms they\ncontained, and have zero intension (and universal comprehension). They\nare necessarily true, true in all possible worlds, no matter what else\nmight be true of a world or thing, and yet are not equivalent in\nmeaning to each other only due to the distinct intensions of their\nconstituents. In MWO Lewis occasionally claimed that we create\nnecessary truth by adopting concepts and criterial principles; in AKV\nhe was more circumspect. It is a matter of convention or legislation\nthat a term has the meaning it does, including sense meaning, but\nLewis (1946, 155–7) denied that analytic truth was truth by\nconvention. “A dog is an animal” is analytically true by\nvirtue of the sense meaning of “dog” and\n“animal”, in particular, the inclusion of the criterion\nfor applying the latter in the criterion for applying the former, and\nthat isn’t a matter of convention. However, Lewis never tried to\ndefine such inclusion further. Quine (1951 [1953]) explicitly\ncriticized Lewis and the analytic/synthetic distinction in “Two\nDogmas of Empiricism”, and would have objected to the idea of\nresting the analytic/synthetic distinction on an undefined notion of\nmeaning inclusion. Lewis (1946, 154), on the other hand, thought that\nmeaning inclusion is as unproblematic and recognizable a fact as the\ninclusion of one plan in another, e.g. a plan to visit France in a\nplan to visit Paris, and didn’t need further explication.\nNonetheless, taking meaning inclusion to be a primitive fact also\nmakes it more difficult to distinguish Lewis’ analytic necessity\nfrom the rationalists’ synthetic necessity, despite his (Lewis\n1946, 157) vigorous rejection of the latter. This is especially so\nsince Lewis (1946, 129) denied that analytic truth is usefully\nelucidated as one that is reducible to logical truth with the\nsubstitution of definitions. For Lewis, the adequacy of a definition\nitself is a matter of analytic truth and what makes a truth a logical\ntruth is that it is an analytic truth concerning certain symbols. \nLewis (1946, 29–31) thought that necessary truths are knowable\na priori, independently of experience. In applying concepts\nlike those of red or apple to current experience, and so interpreting\nexperience, we form expectations and make predictions about future\nexperience, conditional on actions we might perform. Our beliefs\nconstitute empirical knowledge in so far as past experience gives us\ngood reason (largely inductive) for making these predictions. However,\nwe aren’t making predictions about future experience simply in\nstating what these concepts are, and what their definitions are, and\nwhat defining criteria they provide for applying them to experience.\nSuch statements are explicative, not predictive, and so neither\nfalsifiable by failed prediction nor verifiable by successful\nprediction nor justified by inductive evidence. The a priori\nis what we are not required to abandon, no matter what experience may\nbring, and in that sense, true no matter what, and in that sense\nnecessary (Lewis 1929, 267.) However, a priori principles are\nneither principles that are universal nor ones that we have to accept.\nThe acceptance of a set of concepts is a matter of decision or\nlegislation or the adoption of an intention to employ certain criteria\nin the interpretation of experience, something for which there are\nalternatives but for which the criteria are not empirical but\npragmatic.  \nIn MWO Lewis (1929, 254) also thought that the a priori\nextended to fundamental laws of nature defining basic concepts like\nmass or energy or simultaneity, and thus included some of what are\ntypically regarded as the basic principles of a scientific theory.\nFurther, besides criteria like convenience and conformity to human\nbent, pragmatic considerations mentioned in MWO (Lewis 1929, 267)\ninclude factors like intellectual simplicity, economy,\ncomprehensiveness, and thus the overall achievement of intellectual\norder. However, unlike Wilfrid Sellars and many others in the latter\nhalf of the 20th century, Lewis never recognized such\nfactors as criteria of empirical justification. The reason seems to be\nthat Lewis (1936b, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 286) didn’t think\nthat these factors make a hypothesis any more probable, in contrast,\npresumably, to conformity to standard criteria of induction:\n“What such simplicity and convenience determine is not truth or\neven probability but merely simplicity and convenience, which have\ntheir reasonable place in the choice of working hypotheses when no\nmore decisive criterion is presently at hand”. At the same time,\nhe thought that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories\nwasn’t entirely empirical. The choice of a system of concepts\nand a priori explicative principles to apply to experience\nand to interpret it in the light of is determined by pragmatic\nconsiderations, not truth or probability. The simpler set of\nscientific concepts and explicative principles is no more true or\nlikely to be true than the simpler logic is more true or valid.\nMoreover, pragmatic considerations might lead us in the face of\nexperience to abandon our scientific concepts and a priori\nprinciples explicating them without making the latter empirically\nunwarranted or any less a priori warranted. \nEmpirical belief and a priori belief aren’t logically\nseparated but intertwined for Lewis. The empirical belief that there\nare no unicorns presupposes the concepts of negation and unicorn, and\nthus more general a priori principles governing negation and\nexplicating the concept of unicorn, e.g. unicorns are horse-like\ncreatures with a horn in their nose. Repeatedly failing to apply the\nconcept of unicorn successfully to experience may make it extremely\nlikely that there are no unicorns and eventually lead us to drop the\nconcept altogether from our conceptual repertoire as useless clutter,\nalong with beliefs explicating the concept, but it doesn’t do so\nby disconfirming or making any less likely the belief that if anything\nis a unicorn, it is a horned horse-like creature. More important cases\nLewis discusses are ones where we discover that there are no Euclidean\nfigures in our space and cease employing Euclidean geometry to\ninterpret experience, or ones where cruder categories for interpreting\nexperience are replaced by more fine grained ones that carve up\nexperience in novel ways that are more valuable for our purposes, or\nones where inventions open up the bounds of experience and lead us to\nabandon an old theory that can accommodate such experience but in a\nless simple way than a novel one. Categories for Lewis don’t\nreally change or alter but are given up and replaced, and old a\npriori truths are replaced by new ones, not contradicted by them\nand not made false by them (Lewis 1929, 267–8).  \nThe most radical challenge to Lewis came from Quine (1951 [1953]) who\nargued that the distinction between so called a priori truths\nand a posteriori truths is just one of degree. The argument\nhas two steps. First, empirical hypotheses have implications for\nexperience only in conjunction with various empirical generalizatons\nand other background assumptions, e.g. about the circumstances of\nperception. Recalcitrant experience thus tells us only that some\nbelief or assumption in the total set that implies a contrary\nexperience is false, not which one, and thus any statement can be held\ntrue, no matter what experience brings, so long as we make enough\nadjustments to the rest of our beliefs and assumptions. Second,\nempirical hypotheses can’t logically imply anything about\nexperience except against a background of assumed laws of logic.\nRecalcitrant experience can, in principle, then, lead us to revise an\nassumed logical principle in our web of belief rather one of our other\nbeliefs.  \nWith respect to the second step, some philosophers might object that\nlogic is part of the framework within which beliefs have logical\nimplications and can’t be part of the same system of belief\nitself. However, Lewis himself might have trouble with this\nsuggestion, since he recognized the possibility of alternative logics,\nand presumably, any decision, even pragmatic, about the adoption or\nrejection of a logic must operate on some logical assumptions. In any\ncase, Lewis himself recognizes that in principle experience could lead\nus to abandon logical beliefs and replace them with others. What he\nwill deny is that it does so by making these principles empirically\nimprobable, and thus any less a priori warranted. Arguably,\nhe may be assuming an excessively narrow view of what makes for\nprobability.  \nWith respect to the first step, Lewis (1946) in AKV will deny\nQuine’s assumption that objective statements never entail\nconditionals about experience without supposing other objective\nstatements true and his assumption that the antecedents of these\nconditionals are never themselves certain, as we shall see in the next\ntwo sections. Moreover, objective hypotheses, despite their various\ninterconnections in a system of empirical belief, aren’t tested\nas a “block”, but have separable and distinct\nprobabilistic connections to others (but not thereby to all) and to\nexperience establishing differing antecedent probabilities and degrees\nof confidence, in the light of which the relevance of tests for the\nprobability of the various hypotheses needs to be assessed\ndifferentially. (Lewis, 1936b, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 285–6,\nLewis 1946, 349–52). However, even so, there may be room for\nalternative ways of modifying systems of hypotheses and their degrees\nof credibility in the light of experience, and different responses to\nprobabilities that are unsettled and may change with future testing.\nSo, in an unpublished lecture, Lewis (1936b, 282–7) says we are\nleft with pragmatic factors like economy, convenience, simplicity, or\nmaking the least alteration to beliefs, at least for the time being,\nto choose “working hypotheses” even if they don’t\ncount as empirical knowledge. Lewis (1946) omits this discussion from\nAKV. Nonetheless it highlights the need for Lewis to provide a\npositive account of non-empirical, non-inductive a priori\nknowledge of principles explicating our concepts and how we have it,\nnot just a negative account that simply contrasts it with empirical\nknowledge.  \nIn MWO, he says the a priori is knowable by the reflective\nand critical formulation of our own principles of classification, at\nleast with respect to meaning connections explicitly before the mind\n(Lewis 1929, 287–8) and in AKV that a priori truths are\ncertifiable by reference to meanings alone (and their relations like\ninclusion), and tested simply by what we can think or imagine being so\n(Lewis 1946, 35, 151–3). However, the only explanation he gives\nof why this should warrant us in thinking anything necessary or\npossible is that “as what we intend at the moment at least, a\nmeaning seems to be as open to direct examination as anything we are\nlikely to discover” (Lewis 1946, 145). It is this that warrants\nus as dismissing any apparent Euclidean triangle the sum of whose\nangles isn’t 180 degrees as either a mismeasurement or not a\nEuclidean triangle rather than a counterexample to Euclidean geometry.\nBarring certainty, there seems to be a half-acknowledged,\nnon-inductive, basic principle of a priori credibility\nassumed here, to the effect that if on reflection on our concepts and\nmeanings and classificatory intentions, we think A includes B, then we\nare at least prima facie warranted in thinking A does include\nB. In the next section, we shall see that Lewis isn’t in\nprinciple averse to non-inductively supported principles of prima\nfacie warrant.  \nIn AKV, Lewis distinguished three classes of empirical statements.\nFirst, there are expressive statements formulating what is\npresently given in experience and about the truth of which we can be\ncertain (Lewis 1946, 171–71, 183, 204, 327). Second, there are\nterminating judgements and statements formulating and\npredicting what we would experience were we to be presented with some\nsensory cue and perform some action. The form of terminating\njudgements is:  \nwhere \\(S, A\\), and \\(E\\) all are formulated in\nexpressive language and concern particular presentable experiences\nabout which we can be certain, and “\\(\\rightarrow\\)” is neither\nlogical entailment nor material implication but what Lewis calls\n“real connection” that gives rise to subjunctive or\ncounterfactual conditionals. Real connections (an example of which are\ncausal connections) are inductively established correlations by virtue\nof which one observable item may indicate another. Terminating\njudgements, as expressing a general claim about a repeatable mode of\naction and a sequent experience, Lewis (1946, 219) claimed, are not\ndecisively verifiable but are decisively falsifiable. Third, there are\nnon-terminating judgements, including objective\njudgment, that are confirmable and disconfirmable by experience,\nthanks to their sense meaning, but are neither decisively verifiable\nnor decisively falsifiable.  \nObjective judgements include not only perceptual judgements like\n“There is a white piece of paper before me” in which we\nconceptualize and interpret a given experience by relating it to other\npossible experiences, but also a vast number of other beliefs about\nthe material world supported by our perceptual beliefs, e.g.\nstatements about the future outcome of space explorations, or\ngeneralizations like “All men have noses”, or non-analytic\nstatements about theoretical entities. Objective judgements\ndon’t strictly imply terminating judgements of the form\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow E\\) (Lewis 1946, 237).\nInstead, the sense meaning of objective judgments consists of an\nindefinitely large set of general probabilistically qualified\nconditional judgements of the form “If it were the case that\n\\(S \\amp A\\), then, in all likelihood,\n\\(E\\)” (Lewis, 1946, 237). Any objective perceptual\njudgement \\(P\\) thus analytically entails and is entailed by, an\nindefinitely large set of hypothetical or conditional judgements of\nthe form, \nNone of these conditional judgements are decisively verifiable or\nfalsifiable by experience. (Lewis (1946, 247) sometimes calls the\nstatements that constitute the empirical content of objective\nstatements terminating judgements nonetheless). However, as expressing\nreal connections, they are nonetheless confirmable and disconfirmable\nby experience, as are the objective judgements whose sense meaning\nthey constitute.  \nFor example, to use Lewis’s examples, suppose \\(P\\) is\n“a sheet of paper lies before me”. Its analytic\nentailments might include, “If \\(S_1\\) (I were to\nseem to see a sheet of paper before me) and \\(A_1\\) (I\nwere to seem to move my eyes), then, probably, \\(E_1\\)\n(I would seem to see the sheet of paper displaced)”, as well as\n“If \\(S_2\\) (I were to seem to feel paper with my\nfingers), and \\(A_2\\) (I were to seem to pick it up and\ntear it), then, probably, \\(E_2\\) (I would seem to see\nor feel torn paper)”, and so on. On the other hand, suppose\n\\(P\\) is “There is a doorknob before me”. Its truth\nmight then entail the truth of a complex set of conditionals like\n“If I were to seem to see a doorknob, and were to seem to reach\nout towards it and grasp it, then, probably, I would seem to feel\nsomething hard and round”, etc. \nIn MWO Lewis says in one place not only that appearances are\nphysically conditioned by objects and the physical circumstances of\none’s body and perception, which is certainly a reason for\nwanting to know such physical facts, but that these conditions enter\ninto the basic understanding or meaning of material object statements:\n“It is such conditions which are expressed in the\n‘if’ clause of those ‘If … then\n…’ propositions in which the predictions implicit in an\ninterpretation may be made explicit” (Lewis 1929, 286). However,\nin AKV he explicitly rejects this position: “Thus those\nconditions which are directly pertinent to a confirmation and\ngenuinely ascertainable are not objective facts but must be included\namongst the given appearances. They must be items of direct\npresentation; and we might think of them as already covered by\n‘\\(S\\)’ in our paradigm: \\(S\\) being given, if\n\\(A\\) then, with probability \\(M, E\\)” (Lewis 1946,\n246). The result is that \\(S\\) in Lewis’ paradigm strictly\nspeaking won’t just include the visual presentation of a\ndoorknob, for example, but the appearance of daylight or the feeling\nof being clear headed as part of the whole presentation. Arguably,\nthat, together with the probability qualifier, allows him to avoid\nQuine’s worries about circumstances of perception and the\ntestable implications of empirical beliefs (Lewis 1946, 242–6).\n \nNo number of successful or failed tests will render the objective\njudgement true or false with theoretical certainty. However, Lewis\nthought the principle of inverse probabilities meant that the\njudgement can be highly probable with a few positive confirmations,\neven practically certain, in so far as the probability of \\(P\\) when\n\\(S\\) and \\(A\\) and \\(E\\) obtain may approach certainty as the\nimprobability of \\(E\\) approaches certainty when \\(S\\) and \\(A\\) and\nnot \\(P\\) obtain. The principle also explains why further tests may\ncontinue to increase our warranted assurance in the judgement even\nmore, though not as dramatically as earlier tests increased our\nwarrant (Lewis 1946, 190–92). Since confirming and gaining\nassurance that \\(P\\) gives us assurance in all the predictions that\n\\(P\\) entails about future experience (Lewis 1946, 239), the principle\nof inverse probabilities may explain how we can act on these\npredictions with increasing confidence. Even though experience of\ninstances of \\(S\\) and \\(A\\) and \\(E\\) can confirm and increase the\nprobability of one sensory conditional entailed by \\(P\\) independent\nof direct experiential confirmation of the other sensory conditionals\nentailed by \\(P\\), experiential confirmation of one conditional increases the\nprobability of the others, and vice versa (Lewis 1946, 348,\nfootnote 6).  \nOur empirical knowledge of objects and objective events and\nproperties, the generalizations they support concerning patterns of\nobjective events and properties, and the use we make of all this for\nfurther inductions, has a complex “many-storied\ncharacter”. Nonetheless, the “whole edifice still rests at\nbottom on these primitive generalizations which we make in terms of\ndirect experience” (Lewis 1946, 261). (Lewis (1929, 332; 1946,\n261) contrasted these primitive generalizations that underlie our\nobjective beliefs with what he says we normally call “empirical\ngeneralizations” that concern patterns of objective events and\nmay formulate natural laws supporting causal explanations.) However,\nthe empirical justification for these primitive generalizations and\nultimately for our objective beliefs can’t rest on current sense\nexperience alone and requires evidence concerning the past. At the\nsame time, what is given to us isn’t the past itself about which\nwe can never be certain, but just current sense presentation and\ncurrent recollection or sense of past experience.  \nLewis appreciated the problem memory posed for his epistemology much\nmore clearly in AKV than in MWO. In AKV, Lewis (1946, 334) argued that\nwhatever we ostensibly remember, whether as explicit recollection or\nmerely in our sense of the past, is prima facie credible just\nbecause so remembered. So there are data of sense presentation and\nalso data of “seeming to remember” or “present\nmemory” (Lewis 1946, 353, 354) that constitute our ultimate\nevidence, and it is only through the latter and the principle of\nmemorial prima facie credibility that empirical\ngeneralizations and the beliefs they support can be inductively\nsupported by premises about past experience as well as about directly\napprehended present experience. Further the credibility of our\nrecollections, together with the whole range of empirical beliefs more\nor less dependent on them, can be solidified and increased through the\nmutual support or congruence of the whole, or can be diminished\nthrough incongruence.  \nA set of beliefs is congruent for Lewis (1946, 338) when the\nantecedent probability of each is increased by the assumption of the\ntruth of the rest. A physical object statement \\(P\\) and the set\nof sensory conditionals that constitute its content form a congruent\nset, as we have seen. Indeed, by virtue of exhausting the empirical\ncontent of \\(P\\), Lewis (1946, 348–9, footnote 6) thinks\nthe sensory conditionals constitute a congruent set by themselves. In\nany case, the degree of warrant enjoyed by the various elements of a\nmature system of empirical belief, especially one that counts as\nknowledge, depends on the inferential support the elements\nprovide each other and the total empirical and memorial data present.\nHowever, Lewis emphasizes that for the members of a congruent system\nto have any degree of probability, “it is absolutely requisite\nthat some at least of the set of statements possess a degree of\ncredibility antecedent to and independent of the remainder of those in\nquestion, and derivable from the relation of them to direct\nexperience” (Lewis 1946, 339). \nAs a result, the “whole\nintricate network” of the empirically credible, Lewis notes,\n“will be constituted at bottom by linkages of ground and\nconsequence, which is in general a one way relation” (Lewis\n1946, 351). Disentangling the network would reveal particular linkages\nof prior probability relationships that would confer some\ndegree of initial probability not just on what we recall of past\nexperience but on simple generalizations from past experience and the\nexpectations of future experiences and thus interpretations of\nexperience these recollections inductively support, even in the\nhypothetical absence of (other) objective beliefs with which they are\ncongruent. Moreover, the recollections that support them and form part\nof an overall congruent system must have some degree of credibility\nindependent of each other and the rest. The improbability of\nindependently probable congruent recollections all being true were the\nbeliefs they inferentially support and that inferentially support them\nnot true makes it unlikely that they are illusions of memory and\nincreases the initial probability enjoyed antecedently by the\nrecollections and what they support (Lewis 1946, 352–3).\nSpelling out the antecedent and independent probability constraints is\ntricky, to which Lewis devotes an extended discussion (Lewis 1946,\n332–57).  \nThe principle of the prima facie credibility of mnemic\npresentation of past experience can’t itself be justified\ninductively for Lewis, on pain of circularity. Nor did he think it is\nsimply a postulate — something we have to assume for empirical\nknowledge to be possible. Instead, he argued that it is constitutive\nof the lived world of experience and something for which there is no\nmeaningful alternative. Sceptical alternatives designed to undermine\nthe principle are ones that are inaccessible to knowledge and thus\nones for which there is no criterion in experience. So it is an\n“analytic statement” that the past is knowable, and a\nsimilar claim was made for the relevance of past experience to the\nfuture, and thus for the knowability of empirical reality. The\nphilosophical problem for Lewis (1946, 360–2) is to formulate\ncorrectly the criteria that “delimit empirical reality and\nexplicate our sense of it”.  \nIn MWO, he defended induction in more detail by arguing that not every\nprediction is compatible with an evidence base, and that successive\nrevision of one’s predictions in the light of new experience\ncan’t help but make for more successful predictions (Lewis 1929,\n367, 386). Nelson Goodman’s well known “grue”\nexample (Goodman 1955) poses problems for the relevance of the first\nclaim and the force of the second. At other times, Lewis simply\nfollowed Hans Reichenbach in claiming that we can be assured only that\nif any procedures will achieve success in prediction, inductive ones\nwill, without clearly distinguishing that claim from any attempt at an\nanalytic justification of induction. \nRationally credible or warranted or justified belief, Lewis thought,\nis probable on the evidence, but the presentation of his views on\nprobability was underdeveloped in MWO, and complex, and sometimes\nconfusing, in AKV. In AKV, Lewis defended an a priori account\nof probability or what he sometimes called expectation.\nHowever, he rejected the Principle of Indifference often associated\nwith a priori accounts, understood as the principle that in\nthe absence of any reason for thinking one a priori\npossibility more likely than another, they are equiprobable (Lewis\n1946, 306–314). The expectation or probability\n\\(a/b\\) of a proposition \\(P\\) is always relative\nto some set of empirical data or premises \\(D\\). The expectation\ncorresponds to an a priori valid estimate of the frequency of\nsome property mentioned in \\(P\\) in some reference class\nmentioned in \\(P\\) , which estimate is derived from data or\npremises \\(D\\), given the a priori valid principles of\nprobabilistic inference, including the principles of induction.\nHypothetical or conditional probability statements that are a\npriori valid license valid probabilistic inferences from premises\nabout evidence or data to probabilistic conclusions. However, for\nLewis, both hypothetical and categorical probability are always\nrelativized to an evidence base, despite his occasional apparent talk\nof a priori valid probability statements as licensing\ninferences from empirical evidence to a (detachable) conclusion\n“Probably, P”. \nLewis rejected the view that probabilities are empirically based\nestimates of the limiting value of the frequency of instances of a\nproperty in a population, and thus expressed in non-terminating\njudgments. First, he thought that any attempt to define probabilities\nas the ratio of instances of one property among instances of another\nproperty as the latter approaches infinity would make probability\njudgments empirically untestable. Second, he argued that, if\nprobability judgements were empirical frequency claims, then the\nprobability judgements would themselves only be probable, something\nthat can’t be coherently accounted for. Nonetheless, Lewis\nrecognized the need to assure ourselves rationally that the frequency\nas validly estimated from the data is closely in accord with the\nactual frequency and that there is nothing in the case at hand\naffecting the occurrence of the property which isn’t taken into\naccount in the specification of the reference class. Lewis dubbed this\nthe reliability of the determination of probability or\nexpectation. He thought that reliability is a function of the adequacy\nof data (e.g. size of sample), the uniformity with which the frequency\nof some property in the data as a whole also holds for subsets of the\ndata, and the proximateness or degree of resemblance of the\ncase at hand in P to the data, all of which he also thought are\nlogical relations. \nThus, in AKV, Lewis (1946, 305) claimed that the full statement of a\nprobability judgement should be of the form “That \\(c\\),\nhaving property \\(F\\), will also have property \\(G\\), is\ncredible on data \\(D\\), with expectation \\(a/b\\)\nand reliability \\(R\\)”, and is assertable in whatever sense\n\\(D\\) is. The judgement is valid when, in accordance with the\na priori rules of probability and the correct rules of\njudging reliability, \\(D\\) gives the estimate\n\\(a/b\\) of the frequency of \\(F\\)s among\n\\(G\\)s, and \\(D\\)’s adequacy, uniformity, and\nproximateness to the case in point, yields reliability \\(R\\). A\nvalid probability judgement is true when \\(D\\) is true, and is a\ncategorical rather than a hypothetical judgement when \\(D\\) is\ncategorically asserted as true. The assertion of the empirical data\n\\(D\\) is the only empirical element in the probability judgement,\nwhich otherwise has no testable implications for experience. However,\nthe belief \\(P\\), that \\(c\\) which has \\(F\\) is also\n\\(G\\), is an empirical belief that may be rationally credible,\nempirically justified, and warranted, in so far as \\(D\\) is given\nand the degree of assurance or belief corresponds to an a\npriori degree of probability (expectation) of \\(P\\) on\n\\(D\\) that is sufficiently reliable. Further, acceptance of\n\\(P\\) counts as empirical knowledge in so far as,\nfirstly, \\(P\\) is true, secondly, the degree of probability or\nexpectation of \\(P\\) on \\(D\\) is sufficiently high as to\napproach practical certainty, and, thirdly, \\(D\\) consists of all\nrelevant data (Lewis, 1946, 314–15). \nIt is important to distinguish probabilistically qualified\ncounterfactual statements of the form \\((S \\amp A)\n\\rightarrow(h)E\\) from a priori probability\nstatements of the form \\(“\\text{Prob}(E, \\text{ on } S \\text{ and }\nA) \\gt .5”.\\) Both express conditional probabilities.\nHowever, the former express ‘real’ connections knowable by\ninduction from past experience (Lewis 1946, 250). They constitute the\nanalytically entailed consequences of an objective material objective\nstatement \\(P\\), but can’t themselves be analytic truths.\nThe latter, on the other hand, if true, are analytically true,\nknowable a priori, with zero intension, and entailed by any\nstatement whatsoever, and so can hardly constitute the empirical\nmeaning of contingently true material object statements. Yet, apart\nfrom denying that “\\(\\rightarrow\\)” can be understood either as\nmaterial implication or strict implication, Lewis had little to say in\nprint about what the truth conditions of subjunctive or counterfactual\nconditionals are. Murphey (2005, 332) quotes correspondence from Lewis\ncomplaining that Goodman and Chisholm in their writings miss the\nobvious interpretation of “If \\(A\\) were the case, then\n\\(B\\) would be the case”, namely that \\(A\\) plus other\npremises of the (actual or hypothetical) case inductively justify the\nconclusion \\(B\\). Lewis needs to say more then about what, if\nanything, distinguishes \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow E\\) from \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\). Is it the degree of probability of \\(E\\)\non the premises, practically certain in the former case, only somewhat\nprobable in the latter? Another problem is to interpret the remark so\nas to avoid turning counterfactuals into a priori analytic\ntruths, albeit ones concerning probabilities. Nonetheless, Lewis\nemphasized their importance, and the importance of the real\nconnections they express, for the possibility of realism about the\nmaterial world and the rejection of any sort of idealism or view that\nphysical objects are simply mind-dependent collections of experiences\n(Lewis 1946, 226, Lewis 1955, in Lewis 1970). The sensory conditionals\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow E\\) and \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) can be true, as can the\nmaterial object statement \\(P\\) that entails them, quite apart\nfrom the truth of the expressive statements \\(S\\) and \\(A\\).\n \nChisholm (1948) raised an important challenge to Lewis’ claim\nthat a physical object statement \\(P\\) entails a set of\ncounterfactual statements expressing claims about what experiences one\nwould have or would be likely to have were one to (seem to) carry out\ncertain tests upon being presented with certain sensory cues. If\n\\(P\\) entails \\(T\\), then for any \\(Q\\) consistent with\n\\(P, P\\) and \\(Q\\) also entail \\(T\\). However,\nChisholm argued, for any material object statement \\(P\\) and for\nany sensory conditional \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\), there will be some other material object\nstatement \\(M\\) about the circumstances of perception that is\nconsistent with \\(P\\), such that \\(P\\) and \\(M\\) can\nboth be true while \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\) is false. For example, suppose \\(P\\) is\n“There is a doorknob before one” and \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) is “If one were to\nseem to see a doorknob and have the experience of reaching out with\none’s hand, then, in all likelihood, one would seem to feel\nsomething hard and round”, and \\(M\\) is “One’s\nfingertips have been permanently anaesthetized”. (Expanding the\nunderstanding of \\(S\\) to include sensory correlates of\ncircumstances of perception, as Lewis (1946, 245–6) suggests,\npresumably just requires expanding the understanding of \\(M\\)\nwith some imagination.) A material object statement like \\(P\\),\ntherefore, doesn’t entail sensory conditionals like \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) . Instead of\nLewis’ empiricism about the meaning and justification of\nmaterial object statements, Chisholm proposed that our spontaneous\nperceptual beliefs about the world, e.g. that one is seeing a\ndoorknob, are prima facie justified just by virtue of being\nsuch spontaneous perceptual beliefs, quite apart from any inductive\njustification from present and past experience that might be\nreconstructed. Lewis’ own defence of the prima facie\ncredibility of memory, Chisholm thought, prepared the way for his\nalternative. Quine (1969), on the other hand, thought that\nChisholm’s problem just shows that what have consequences for\nexperience and are tested by experience are never individual material\nobject statements in isolation from each other but only sets of them\nor theories. Quine saved empiricism by drawing a holistic moral from\nthe sort of problem Chisholm posed.  \nIn a rare reply to critics, Lewis (1948, reprinted in Lewis 1970,\n322–3) objected that Chisholm had misunderstood the implication\nof the probability qualifier. The familiar rule “If \\(P\\)\nentails \\(T\\), then for any \\(Q, P\\) and \\(Q\\)\nentail \\(T\\)” doesn’t apply, he claims, when\n\\(T\\) is any kind of probability statement. \\(E\\) not being\nprobable on \\(P\\) and \\(M\\) and \\(S\\) and \\(A\\) is\nperfectly consistent with \\(E\\) being probable on \\(P\\) and\n\\(S\\) and \\(A\\) and its truth doesn’t undermine the\ntruth of the claim that \\(P\\) entails \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\). Chisholm might respond that\nthe familiar rule is simply a consequence of the meaning of entailment\nor strict implication, according to which it is not possible that\n\\(P\\) and not \\(T\\). Furthermore, Lewis isn’t simply\nasserting that \\(E\\) is probable on \\(P\\) and \\(S\\) and\n\\(A\\), but, as Lewis (1946, 248–50) himself says in his\nformal summary of his view, that the subjunctive conditional\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) is an\nanalytic consequence of \\(P\\), at least in the way \\(X\\)\nis coloured is a consequence of \\(X\\) is red, and is\n(strictly) implied by \\(P\\), as a conclusion to a premise, even\nif not solely by reference to the “rules of deductive\nlogic”. Of course, “\\(P\\) strictly implies\n\\(((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E)\\)”\nitself strictly implies “\\((P \\amp S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) ” (but not\nconversely), and neither is contradicted by “\\((P \\amp S \\amp A \\amp M) \\rightarrow\\)\nnot\\((h)E\\)”. However, \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) expresses in its own right\nan “in all likelihood” relation of probability between\n\\(E\\) and the possibly counterfactual \\(S\\) and \\(A\\)\n(Lewis 1946, 250), quite apart from \\(P\\), a relation that, for\nLewis, holds when it is in accord with the a priori rules of\nprobability (including inductive inference) relative to the empirical\ndata D (Lewis 1946, 305,314), e.g. in the simplest case, recollections\nof past instances of \\(E\\) usually following \\(S\\) and\n\\(A\\). Chisholm’s challenge seems to remain, whether it is\npossible for \\(P\\) and \\(M\\) to be true and \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) false.  \nNonetheless, as Lewis (1948, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 318–321)\nnotes in a breakdown of cases, the probabilistically qualified\nsubjunctive \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\) (“If one were to seem to see a doorknob\nand have the experience of reaching out with one’s hand, then,\nin all likelihood, one would seem to feel something hard and\nround”) is compatible with occasional failures of prediction.\nThus, he can point out that in cases where the truth of \\(M\\)\n(“One’s fingertips have been permanently\nanaesthetized”) somehow doesn’t affect the sensory cues\nand is recent enough to have not (yet) significantly altered the\npatterns in the data D, e.g. of instances of \\(E\\) usually\nfollowing \\(S\\) and \\(A, (S \\amp A)\n\\rightarrow(h)E\\) remains true when \\(P\\)\n(“There is a doorknob before one”) and \\(M\\) are\ntrue. That’s because in such cases \\((S \\amp A)\n\\rightarrow(h)E\\) is still supported by the extant data of\nexperience and memory D in accord with the a priori rules,\ndespite the truth of \\(M\\), and the reliability of that\nprobability assessment is still warranted by the data and rules for\njudging reliability, although \\(M\\) might affect the actual\nreliability of the probability assessment in the cases at hand, and\nmight eventually affect the actual frequency of \\(E\\) over time.\nMuch depends here on the understanding of probability statements and\nconditionals, and Lewis’ account isn’t without its\ntensions. In different (but more normal) cases where \\(M\\) does\nmanifest itself by affecting the sensory cues, making \\(S_1\\)\ntrue, for example, one seems to have tingly, numb fingertips, in\naddition to \\(S\\), one seems to see a doorknob, \\((S \\amp S_1 \\amp A) \\rightarrow\\) not \\((h)E\\) might\nindeed be true, but, as Lewis would emphasize, it is consistent with\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\). Finally,\nin yet different (and bizarre) cases where the longstanding truth of\n\\(M\\) when \\(P\\) was true in the past didn’t affect\nthe sensory cues but significantly affected the pattern with\n\\(E\\), making D1, e.g. \\(E\\) not usually following\n\\(S\\) and \\(A\\) in recalled instances, the actual empirical\ndata, rather than D as in the first case, it seems that D1\nwouldn’t have led us to expect \\(E\\) upon \\(S\\) and\n\\(A\\). However, that expectation is constitutive in part of our\nobjective thought \\(P\\), and thus, as Firth (1950) suggests, the\nfailure of the sensory conditional \\((S \\amp A)\n\\rightarrow(h)E\\) to hold relative to D1 is arguably\nirrelevant to its entailment by the thought we express by\n“P”. In any case, one might wonder how sensory\nconditionals like \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\), which, for Lewis, express generalizations\nconcerning what any one would (likely) experience and which must do so\nif they are to provide the empirical content of objective judgements\nabout an interpersonal material world, can nonetheless be warranted\ninductively by premises concerning only patterns in the personal\nexperience of the putative knower, in particular how their probability\ncan be judged to be sufficiently reliable, without reference to any\nbackground beliefs about how the material world interacts with persons\ngenerally and their bodies to affect experience.  \nYet, if Lewis were simply to drop the analytic entailment claim that\ngives probabilistically qualified sensory conditionals like \\((S \\amp\nA) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) a privileged semantic role, and rest content with\nthe various consistent probability statements relating \\(E\\) to \\(P\\),\n\\(S\\), \\(A\\), and \\(M\\), the character of his empiricism would become\npuzzling. If the consistent relative probability statements in\nquestion are the probabilistically qualified subjunctive conditionals,\n\\(“(P \\amp S \\amp A \\rightarrow(h)E”\\) and\n\\(“(P \\amp S \\amp A \\amp M) \\rightarrow \\text{not}(h)E)”,\\) then the statements in question are empirical\npropositions justified by induction. The justification for them thus\nwill presuppose prior knowledge of the truth of material object\nstatements like \\(P\\) and \\(M\\), perhaps in the way Chisholm suggests,\nrather than explain why and how we can know such propositions solely\non the basis of present and past experience of the given. On the other\nhand, if the relative probability statements are\na priori analytic statements in their own right, then it is\nthe total set of such statements that will constitute the empirical\nmeaning of \\(P\\), statements like as much as \nthus including statements containing other\nmaterial object statements like \\(M\\). Even when the relativization to\nother background material object statements isn’t explicit, the\nprobability statement would seem to be implicitly relative to some\nbackground assumption of material normality. In other words, Lewis\nwould have abandoned reductionism for Quine’s holistic\nconclusion that individual material object statements like \\(P\\),\napart from other material object statements, have “no fund of\nexperiential implications to call their own” (Quine 1969,\n79). \nAs noted earlier, Lewis (1929, 286) and Lewis (1936b) flirts with a\nversion of Quine’s alternative. However, in AKV and in his reply\nto Chisholm, Lewis clearly repudiates it: if Chisholm were right that\n“no statement of objective fact had consequences for direct\nexperience without further premises specifying objective conditions of\nperception”, then, Lewis says, “the type of empiricism of\nwhich my account is one variant—verification-theories and\nconfirmation-theories—will be altogether indefensible”\n(Lewis 1948, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 318). The result, he adds, would\nbe a fatally flawed “coherence theory of empirical truth”\nthat leaves us with “nothing..but skepticism”.  \nLewis’ views about the given are at once among his best known\nand among his most criticized. The pre-analytic datum for\nphilosophical reflection is our “thick” experience and\nknowledge of the world around us, but reflection on this experience\nand knowledge reveals two elements: the given or immediate data of\nexperience and the activity of thought whereby we conceptually\ninterpret the given. The given in sense experience consists of\nspecific sensuous qualities that we are immediately aware of when, for\nexample, we take ourselves to be seeing or hearing or tasting or\nsmelling or touching something, or even to be hallucinating or\ndreaming instead. These distinct qualities or qualia\n(singular quale) are the repeatable felt characters of\nexperience, and include the felt goodness or felt badness of\nparticular experiences or stretches of experience, as well as\nqualities of sight, sound, taste, smell, touch, motion, and other\nfamiliar modes of experience. On the other hand, the repeatability of\nthese qualities, or the similarity of current instances to past\ninstances, isn’t something that is given to us. When we\nconceptually interpret the given, we form hypothetical expectations\nand make predictions, in the light of past experience, concerning\nexperiences we would have were we to engage in specific actions, and\nso, in applying concepts, as Kant suggests, we relate our experiences\nto each other. However, usually, we do so automatically and without\nconscious reflection, in ways that express habitual attitudes and\nassociations rather than engaging in (explicit) inference. The given,\nunlike our conceptual interpretation of it, isn’t alterable by\nour will. It consists of what remains when we subtract from ordinary\nperceptual cognition all that could conceivably be mistaken (Lewis\n(1946), 182–3). Our apprehension of the given isn’t,\ntherefore, subject to any error and isn’t subject to correction\nor verification or disconfirmation from further experience, and\nisn’t, as a result, to be classified as knowledge. Any\ncomparative classification of experience in terms of similarities and\ndifferences with other experiences, on the other hand, relates\nexperiences to each other and and isn’t certain. What we recall\nof past experience, even immediately, isn’t given to us or\ncertain, but, as Lewis makes clear in AKV, our immediate recollection\nor sense of past experience as having been so and so is.  \nIn MWO, Lewis (1929, 401) says that the given in experience never\noccurs in the absence of interpretation and characterizes the\ndistinction as an “abstraction” of elements that are\nsynthesized in our judgment, but which we may realize are common to\nquite different conceptualizations such as those of the adult and the\nchild (Lewis 1929, 49–50). AKV is more circumspect. Although the\ngiven is what we are immediately aware of or directly apprehend as it\nguides and corrects our interpretations, it isn’t something we\nfocus on or attend to or are “clearly conscious”of in our\nautomatic interpretations (Lewis 1946, 153) any more than in riding a\nbicycle we attend to or focus on the various sensory and motion and\nbalance sensations that are elements in and guide our activity, though\nwe could on reflection and perhaps did in learning (Lewis 1946, 10).\nIn perceptual cognition, what is given in sense experience serves as a\nnatural sign of future experience contingent on action in the light of\npast experience, and prompts the anticipation of such experience. What\nis given is of no interest to active beings apart from what it\nsignifies for future experience and anticipations it prompts for\naction. (Lewis 1946, 10).  \nNonetheless, Lewis (1952a, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 326) says\n“the validity of this interpretation is that and that\nonly which could attach to it as an inductive inference from the given\nvisual presentation...the incorrigible presentational element”.\nWhat matters for the credibility or warrant or validity of the belief\nis that there is a logical, inferential relation between the belief\nand grounds in experience that prompt it in the light of past\nexperience and that can be elicited on critical reflection and the\ncharacter of the relation made clear enough for our theoretical\npurposes. However, the credibility or validity of the belief\nisn’t created by the reflective attempt to elicit sufficient\ngrounds (Lewis 1946, 186, 189, 262, 329–32) The given, thus,\nplays both a causal role as the ultimate or remote ground responsible\nfor belief and an epistemic role as the ultimate justifying grounds of\nempirical belief. (Lewis 1946, 262, 328–30).  \nProbability, for Lewis, concerns a logical relation between a\nconclusion and premises, and a statement is categorically assertable\nwith a degree of probability or credibility, or a belief warranted or\ncredible to that degree, as opposed to being merely hypothetically\nprobable a priori to that degree on premises, only to the\nextent that the premises or data are sufficiently credible or\nwarranted or probable. (Lewis 1946, 315–27). Ultimately, the\nconclusion must be warranted or credible or probable on premises or\ndata that are certain, not just true, and that are not just warranted\nor credible only on other premises or data, even if we may never reach\nthese ultimate premises ordinarily in showing probability or\njustification. Otherwise we have “an indefinite regress of the\nmerely probable...and the probability will fail to be genuine”\n(Lewis 1946, 186). Here he echoes MWO where he says that the validity\nof a probability judgement is a relation between the judgement and\n“ultimate premises” that (a) “may verbally be quite\nremote”, unlike the “immediate premises” we might\ninitially and normally cite, that (b) must be a\n“certainty” rather than merely probable on yet further\npremises, and that (c) must be “actual given data for the\nindividual” (Lewis 1929, 328–9). Lewis is defending a\nnormative standard for empirical knowledge that he thinks is implicit\nin cognition and revealed on reflection but which is also\npsychologically and verbally remote from everyday cognitive practices\nof justifying beliefs to ourselves or others in the light of more\nproximate assumptions taken for granted in the context of inquiry or\ndiscussion. Some pragmatists might feel there is tension here.  \nIn MWO, Lewis (1929, 53) also famously says that the given is\n“ineffable”. So how can what is ineffable even be true,\nand how can what is neither true nor false, nor as a result, neither\nprobably true nor probably false, serve as the ultimate premises of\na priori valid logical probability relations licensing\nbelief or assertion with probability or credibility? And how can we\nanticipate or predict future experience that isn’t yet given,\nexcept in conceptual or comparative terms that won’t allow for\ndecisive falsification? Again, there may seem to be tension in\nLewis’ views of the given and the epistemic role he assigns it.\nLewis (1936a and 1936b, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 155–7,\n292–3) clearly recognizes the logical and epistemological\nproblems, and he responds by introducing categories of\nexpressive statements and the expressive use of\nlanguage. This carries over into AKV. Expressive statements like\n“It seems as though I am seeing a red round thing” serve\nto convey or express or denote what we directly apprehend in\nexperience without conceptualizing and interpreting it. They are true\nby virtue of the qualitative character of experience they express and\nare verified by it, and false only when we knowingly lie about our\nexperience, and the ineffability of what they express just consists in\ntheir not implying possibilities of further experience. Moreover,\ntheir truth is something that we know, or, as he more carefully and\nrepeatedly says in AKV, something about which we are certain (Lewis\n1946, 171–2, 183, 204, 327). The expressive use of language is\nto convey or express what is not only directly apprehended but what\nmay be directly apprehensible in the future or, perhaps, was directly\napprehensible in the past. (Lewis 1946, 179). Nonetheless, Lewis notes\nthat the expressive use of language is needed only for the discussion\nof knowledge, not for knowledge itself (Lewis 1946, 183; 1952a,\nreprinted in Lewis 1970, 327). So perhaps it isn’t surprising\nthat later he also talks of “immediately given facts of\nsense” and “facts of our seeming to remember” (Lewis\n1946, 327, 353) and “datum facts” and “logical\nrelations of facts” (Lewis 1952a, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 325).\n \nSellars (1963, 132) thought that the classical empiricist given was an\ninconsistent triad of three claims: (1) being appeared to as if there\nwere something red entails non-inferentially knowing that one is\nappeared redly to, (2) the ability to be appeared to is unacquired,\nand (3) the ability to know facts of the form x is F is acquired.\nLewis clearly denied (1), but he recognized this was the result of a\nchoice about how to use “know” and that others,\n“without fault”, might choose to extend it to direct\napprehensions of sense because they are certain for us (Lewis 1946,\n183). However, if Lewis followed suit and granted (1), it seems he\nwould deny (3) on the grounds that the ability to be certain of the\ngiven wasn’t acquired. Sellars might question whether such\ncertainty, or the expressive language in which it was couched, was\nsufficiently rich in content to support other knowledge inferentially.\nIn any case, Lewis’ defense of the certainty of the given rests\non two claims. First, it is just an undeniable fact, apparent to\nanyone who reflects on experience, that there is a sensuous character\nof experience which we are aware of and can’t be mistaken about\nand which, until it fades to memory, isn’t subject to correction\nand isn’t further confirmable. As Lewis (1952a, reprinted in\nLewis 1970, 329) put it in his symposium on the given with Reichenbach\n(1952) and Goodman (1952), there is no requirement of “inductive\nconsistency” on protocols or expressive statments. Second, the\nsupposition that probability is always relative to something else that\nis itself only probable means that probabilities can never get off the\nground. As Lewis famously says, “if anything is to be probable,\nsomething must be certain” (Lewis 1946, 186). Goodman (1952), in\nhis symposium contribution, argued that the premises relative to which\nother statements are credible or probable just have to be initially\ncredible on their own to some degree, not certain, though subject to\nfuture confirmation or disconfirmation in the light of further\nexperience. So long as they are initially credible on their own rather\nthan because something else is initially credible, Lewis’\nregress fails. This is a view that attracted many epistemologists\nafter Lewis in some form or other.  \nLewis’ response is instructive for his understanding of\nepistemology. For Lewis (1952a, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 330), a\nprincipal task of epistemology is with the “validity” of\nknowledge, that is to say with the justification or warrant for\ncognition that distinguishes empirically warranted belief from lucky\nor unlucky guess or hazard of belief. If a class of beliefs in\nprinciple may be false, we need some reason or grounds for thinking\nits members true or likely to be true, especially if we plan to base\nother beliefs on them. That requires present or past justifying\ngrounds of belief, not just future potential for verification or\nconfirmation as he thinks Goodman proposes. Otherwise, we confuse\njustification with verification, or ignore the former for the latter.\nNor can the grounds consist solely in other beliefs that might be\nmistaken without grounds for thinking them true or likely to be true,\nor in beliefs that stand in conditional probabilistic relations to\neach other, as he thinks Reichenbach proposes, without any antecedent\nprobabilities deriving from something else (Lewis 1952a, reprinted in\nLewis 1970, 328). Lewis acknowledges that his (somewhat traditional)\nconcerns with validation or justification, skepticism, and the need\nfor given justifying grounds, lead him to depart from or supplement\nstandard pragmatic theories.  \nFinally, we can’t directly verify the existence of other\nsubjects of experience or what is given to them in their experience.\nNonetheless, Lewis (1934, 1941b) claimed that by empathy, in terms of\nour own conscious experience, we can imagine or envisage the conscious\nexperience of others, rather than simply our own experience of others\nand their bodies and our interactions with them. Moreover, the\nsupposition of another consciousness like ours, with a body like ours,\ncan be indirectly confirmed and supported by induction. However, Lewis\nprovided no details concerning this inductive support for our belief\nin other minds.  \nIn contrast with those logical positivists who thought that statements\nof value merely express attitudes, pro or con, to\nobjects, persons, or situations, but are neither true nor false, Lewis\n(1946, 396–98) thought that statements of value were as true or\nfalse as other empirical statements, and every bit as empirically\nverifiable or falsifiable, confirmable or disconfirmable. True, felt\nvalue qualia, felt goodness and badness, are given to us and\ndirectly apprehended in experience or stretches of experience, and\n“expressive” statements must be used to indicate or convey\nthem. However, such statements, like Lewis’ other\n“expressive” statements, may be true or false (see\nprevious section), and simply convey the occurrence of given\nqualia in experience and no more, instead of indicating the\nexistence of objects, situations, or persons, and expressing our\nattitudes to them. Moreover, there are also for Lewis terminating\njudgments of value concerning what the felt value of some experiences\nindicates about the felt value of further experiences. Finally, there\nare “objective” judgements of value: judgements\nattributing value to persons, objects, and objective situations, in so\nfar as they have the potential, depending on circumstances, to produce\nfelt goodness or badness in us or others. These are non-terminating\njudgements of value and are empirically confirmable or disconfirmable\nby induction just like any other objective empirical judgement. Lewis\nthus claims that his theory of value is thoroughly naturalistic and\nhumanistic, rather than transcendental, but still objectivist.  \nThe felt goodness of experience is what is intrinsically good or\nvaluable for its own sake. It is only experience in so far as it has\nsuch value quality that is intrinsically good rather than merely\nextrinsically valuable for its contribution to something else that is\nintrinsically valuable. Value and disvalue are modes or aspects of\nexperience to which desire and aversion are “addressed”\n(Lewis 1946, 403). Lewis denies that “pleasure” is\nadequate to the wide variety of what is found directly good in\nexperience, and thus thinks it inadequate as a synonym for\n“good”. However, as Frankena (1964) argues, for Lewis\ndirectly found goodness still seems to be as natural a quality or\nproperty of certain experiences as any other qualia directly\napprehended in experience. Nonetheless, the value of a stretch of\nexperience, indeed a whole life, isn’t just the value (and\ndisvalue) of the parts, and in AKV, Lewis criticized Bentham’s\nattempt at a calculus of values. For Lewis, the intrinsic value found\nin the experience of a symphony isn’t just the sum of the\nintrinsic value of the movements taken individually, but reflects the\ncharacter of the symphony as a temporal Gestalt. What is\nultimately good for Lewis is the quality of a life found good\nin the living of it. (Lewis 1952b in Lewis 1970, 179) The constituent\nexperiences thus might have value for their own sake, but also value\nfor their contribution to the value of the whole life of which they\nare parts. \nHowever, Lewis thought that judgements about how a valued experience\ncontributes to the value of a life as a whole, unlike some terminating\njudgements about how one valued experience will yield another valued\nexperience, are not decisively verifiable or falsifiable. First, any\nattempt to apprehend a life as a whole and the value of it as\nexperienced goes beyond the specious present of experience and relies\non memory and expectation of past and future experience and their\nvalues, and thereby leaves room for error. Second, any attempt to\nsimplify the problem by breaking a whole life into parts and\napprehending their value, and then calculating the probability of\ntheir contributing to a good life as a whole, also leaves room for\nerror. \nThe value of an object consists in its potentiality for conducing to\nintrinsically valuable experiences, and is thus a real connection\nbetween objects, persons, and the character of experience, which we\ncan be empirically warranted in accepting on the basis of the\nempirical evidence and the probability on the evidence of such objects\nyielding such intrinsically valuable experiences. For Lewis (1946,\n432), therefore, no object has intrinsic value. Nonetheless, objects\ncan have inherent value in so far as the good which they\nproduce is disclosable in the presence or observation of the object\nitself rather than some other object. Lewis (1946, Ch. 14) contrasted\naesthetic value with cognitive and moral value, not by virtue of\ndistinctive characters of their felt goods, but chiefly by distinctive\nattitudes to experience. The aesthetic attitude is one of\ndisinterested interest in the presented, attentiveness to the given in\nits own right, as opposed to the cognitive attitude’s concern\nwith prediction and significance for future experience, and the\nconcern on the part of the attitude of action or morality with the\npursuit of absent but attainable goods. Thanks to these differences,\naesthetic values in experience tend to be of high degree and long\nlasting and don’t require exclusive possession, and aesthetic\nvalues in objects are inherent ones. \nLewis recognized that potentialities are in various ways relative to\nparticular circumstances and manners of observation. There is thus a\nplurality of judgements of the value of objects, of the various ways\nin which they can contribute and fail to contribute to intrinsically\nvaluable experiences, and an apparent contradictory nature to\nincomplete verbal statements of them (e.g., “\\(X\\) is\ngood”, “\\(X\\) isn’t good”). For Lewis\n(1946, 528), issues about the relativity or subjectivity of judgements\nof the value of objects aren’t issues about the empirical truth\nof attributions of value to objects, but just issues about whether the\nconditions under which an object produces directly apprehended value\nare peculiar to the nature and capacities of a particular person and\nthus not indicative of the possibility of similar value finding on the\npart of other persons. Quine (1981) argued that variation within and\namong individuals and societies, and the variable and open ended\ncharacter of what they find valuable, means that predicates like\n“pleases” or “ feels good” don’t support\ninductive inferences from case to case in the way that\n“green” or “conducts electricity” do.\nSkepticism concerning the prospects for empirical content and\nempirical truth of attributions of value to objects is thus in order.\nLewis (1946, 323), on the other hand, seems to have thought that this\ncontention implies that no one could ever act with empirical warrant\nto improve his own lot in life or do others any good, an absurdity in\nhis view. Lewis argued at length for the possibility of empirically\nwarranted judgements of the social or impersonal value of objects. The\nkey is that “value to more than one person is to be assessed as\nif their several experiences were to be included in that of a single\nperson” (Lewis (1946, 550). Rawls (1971, 188–90)\ncriticized Lewis for mistaking impersonality for impartiality, and\ndenied the relevance of Lewis’ account of impersonal value for\nquestions of justice, at least, for which impartiality is key.  \nAn action, for Lewis (1955, 49), is subjectively right, and one we are\nnot to be blamed for doing, if we think it objectively right. An\naction is objectively right if it is correctly judged on the evidence\nthat its consequences are such as it will be right to bring about.\nThat requires that their pursuit violates no categorical\nrational imperative or principle. \nLewis (1952b, 1952c, 1955, Chapter 5) outlines categorical rational\nimperatives of doing and thinking, or versions of one rational\nimperative, in various ways, formulations, and detail. The general\nidea is laid out briefly in AKV (Lewis (1946, 480–82). To be\nsubject to imperatives is to find a constraint of action or thought in\nwhat is not immediate. To be rational is to be capable of constraint\nby prevision of some future good or ill, and subjection to imperatives\nis simply a feature of living in human terms. Rationality turns on\nconsistency, and the logical is derivative from the rational. Indeed,\nconsistency of thought is for the sake of and aimed at consistency in\naction, which in turn derives from consistency in willing, i.e., of\npurposing and setting a value on. Logical consistency turns on nowhere\nrepudiating that to which we anywhere commit ourselves to in our\nthought, and consistency in general consists in not accepting now what\nwe are unwilling to commit to elsewhere or later. Consistency in what\nwe think and do requires and is required by conformity to\nprinciples.  \nSo there is a categorical rational imperative of consistency,\n“ Be consistent in valuation and in thought and action”\n(Lewis 1946, 481) the basis of which is simply a datum of human\nnature, and a broader imperative of cogency or basing one’s\nbeliefs on cogent reasoning from evidence (Lewis 1952b, 1952c), an\nimperative of prudence, “Be concerned about yourself in future\nand on the whole”, and an imperative of justice, “No rule\nof action is right except one which is right in all instances and\ntherefore right for everyone” (Lewis 1946, 481–2). These\nprinciples are simply a priori explications of the rational\nor moral sense possessed by most humans. Certainly, this might be\nchallenged. In any case, Lewis thinks that where that sense is\nlacking, argument for the principles is pointless, and he concludes\nAKV by claiming that “valuation is always a matter of empirical\nknowledge” but “what is right and what is just can never\nbe determined by empirical facts alone” (Lewis 1946, 554). \nThe problem remains of reconciling the imperatives of prudence and\n(social) justice in practice, of reconciling the good for oneself with\nthe good for others in our self-directed, principled, thinking and\ndoing. What aids us is that, through language and civilization, humans\nremember as a species and not merely as individuals. What we are\njustified in thinking thereby is that human achievement and social\nprogress require autonomous, self-criticizing and self-governing\nindividuals, and that individual achievement and realization of\ncherished goods requires membership in a social order of individuals\nco-operating in the pursuit of values cherished in common. The\ncontrast between individual prudence and social justice seems\nfundamental, Lewis concludes, perhaps rather optimistically, only by\nforgetting this (Lewis 1952b).","contact.mail":"bruce.hunter@ualberta.ca","contact.domain":"ualberta.ca"}]
