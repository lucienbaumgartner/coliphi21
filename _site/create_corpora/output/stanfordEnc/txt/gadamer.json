Trained in neo-Kantian scholarship, as\nwell as in classical philology, and profoundly affected by the\nphilosophy of Martin Heidegger, Gadamer developed a distinctive and\nthoroughly dialogical approach, grounded in Platonic-Aristotelian as\nwell as Heideggerian thinking, that rejects subjectivism and\nrelativism, abjures any simple notion of interpretive method, and\ngrounds understanding in the linguistically mediated happening of\ntradition. Employing a more orthodox and modest, but also more\naccessible style than Heidegger himself, Gadamer’s work can be seen as\nconcentrated in four main areas: the first, and clearly the most\ninfluential, is the development and elaboration of a philosophical\nhermeneutics; the second is the dialogue within philosophy, and within\nthe history of philosophy, with respect to Plato and Aristotle in\nparticular, but also with Hegel and Heidegger; the third is the\nengagement with literature, particularly poetry, and with art; and the\nfourth is what Gadamer himself terms ‘practical\nphilosophy’ (Gadamer 2001, 78–85) encompassing contemporary\npolitical and ethical issues. The ‘dialogical’ character\nof Gadamer’s approach is evident, not merely in the central\ntheoretical role he gives to the concept of dialogue in his thinking,\nbut also in the discursive and dialogic, even\n‘conversational’, character of his writing, as well as in\nhis own personal commitment to intellectual engagement and\nexchange. Indeed, he is one of the few philosophers for whom the\n‘interview’ has become a significant category of\nphilosophical output (see Hahn 1997, 588–599; also Gadamer 2001,\n2003).  Although he identified connections between his own work and\nEnglish-speaking ‘analytic’ thought (mainly via the later\nWittgenstein, but also Donald Davidson), and has sometimes seen his\nideas taken up by thinkers such as Alasdair McIntyre (see MacIntyre\n2002), Ronald Dworkin (see Dworkin 1986), Robert Brandom (see Brandom\n2002), John McDowell (see McDowell 1996, 2002), and especially Richard\nRorty (Rorty 1979), Gadamer is perhaps less well known, and certainly\nless well-appreciated, in philosophical circles outside Europe than\nare some of his near-contemporaries. He is undoubtedly, however, one\nof the most important thinkers of the twentieth century, having had an\nenormous impact on a range of areas from aesthetics to jurisprudence,\nand having acquired a respect and reputation in Germany, and elsewhere\nin Europe, that went far beyond the usual confines of academia.\n\n\n Born on February 11, 1900, in Marburg, in Southern Germany,\nGadamer grew up in Breslau (now Wroclaw in Poland), where his father\nwas Professor of Pharmacy at the University of Breslau, later taking\nthe Chair of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Marburg. Gadamer’s family\nbackground was Protestant, and his father was sternly Prussian. His\nmother died of diabetes when Gadamer was only four, and he had no\nsurviving brothers or sisters. Showing an early interest in humanistic\nstudies, Gadamer began university studies in Breslau in 1918 (studying\nwith Richard Hoenigswald), moving to Marburg with his father in\n1919. Gadamer completed his doctoral studies at Marburg in 1922 (in\nhis own words, ‘too young’—see Gadamer 1997b, 7)\nwith a dissertation on Plato. In that same year, Gadamer also\ncontracted poliomyelitis, from which he recovered only slowly, and the\nafter-effects of which remained with him for the rest of his life. Gadamer’s early teachers at Marburg were Paul Natorp and Nicolai\nHartmann. Paul Friedlander introduced him to philological study, and\nGadamer also received encouragement from Rudolf Bultmann. It was,\nhowever, Martin Heidegger (at Marburg from 1923–1928) who exerted the\nmost important and enduring effect on Gadamer’s philosophical\ndevelopment. Gadamer had first met Heidegger in Frieburg in early\n1923, having also corresponded with him in 1922. Yet although Gadamer\nwas a key figure in Heidegger’s Marburg circle, working as Heidegger’s\nunpaid assistant, by 1925 Heidegger had became quite critical of\nGadamer’s philosophical capacities and contributions. As a result,\nGadamer decided to abandon philosophy for classical\nphilology. (Gadamer was not alone in being the recipient of such\ncriticism—Heidegger was also unimpressed by Jacob Klein and was\ncertainly prone to deliver harsh judgments on his students and\ncolleagues—but Gadamer seems to have been more particularly\naffected by it.) Through his philological work, however, Gadamer seems\nto have regained Heidegger’s respect, passing the State Examination in\nClassical Philology in 1927, with Friedlander and Heidegger as two of\nthe three examiners, and then going on to submit his habilitation\ndissertation (‘Plato’s Dialectical Ethics’, [1991]), in\n1928, under Friedlander and Heidegger’s guidance. Gadamer’s\nrelationship with Heidegger remained relatively close throughout their\nrespective careers, even though it was also a relationship that held\nconsiderable tension—at least on Gadamer’s side. Gadamer’s first academic appointment was to a junior position in\nMarburg in 1928, finally achieving a lower-level professorship there\nin 1937. In the meantime, from 1934–35, Gadamer held a temporary\nprofessorship at Kiel, and then, in 1939, took up the Directorship of\nthe Philosophical Institute at the University of Leipzig, becoming\nDean of the Faculty in 1945, and Rector in 1946, before returning to\nteaching and research at Frankfurt-am-Main in 1947. In 1949, he\nsucceeded Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg, officially retiring (becoming\nProfessor Emeritus) in 1968. Following his retirement, he travelled\nextensively, spending considerable time in North America, where he was\na visitor at a number of institutions and developed an especially\nclose and regular association with Boston College in\nMassachusetts. \nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Gadamer was able to accommodate himself,\non his account, reluctantly, first to National Socialism and then\nbriefly, to Communism. While Gadamer did not identify himself strongly\nwith either regime (he was never a member of the National Socialist\nParty, although he did belong to the affiliated National Socialist\nTeachers Union), neither did he draw attention to himself by outright\nopposition. However some have seen his stance as too acquiescent, and\nothers have argued that he was indeed supportive of the Nazi\ndictatorship or of some aspects of it (see Wolin 2000 as well as the\nreply in Palmer 2002; see also the discussion in Krejewski 2003,\n169–306; for Gadamer’s own comments on this issue, see\nGadamer 2001). \nIn 1953, together with Helmut Kuhn, Gadamer founded the highly\ninfluential Philosophische Rundschau, but his main\nphilosophical impact was not felt until the publication of Truth\nand Method in 1960 (1989b). Gadamer’s best known\npublications almost all date from the period after Truth and\nMethod, and in this respect much of his philosophical reputation\nrests on publications either after or in the decade just before his\ntransition to emeritus status (in 1968). The important debates in\nwhich Gadamer engaged with Emilio Betti, Jürgen Habermas and\nJacques Derrida all took place in this latter part of Gadamer’s\nphilosophical career, and the translation of his work into English\nalso began only quite late, in the 1970s. \nGadamer was twice married: in 1923, to Frida Kratz (later divorced),\nwith whom he had one daughter (born in 1926), and, in 1950, to\nKäte Lekebusch. Gadamer received numerous awards and prizes\nincluding, in 1971, Knight of the ‘Order of\nMerit’—the highest academic honor awarded in\nGermany. Remaining intellectually active until the very end of his\nlife (he held regular office hours even in his nineties), Gadamer died\nin Heidelberg on March 13, 2002, at the age of 102. \n\nGadamer’s thinking began and always remained connected with Greek\nthought, especially that of Plato and Aristotle. In this respect,\nGadamer’s early engagement with Plato, which lay at the core of both\nhis doctoral and habilitation dissertations, was determinative of much\nof the character and philosophical direction of his thinking. Under\nthe influence of his early teachers such as Hartmann, as well as\nFriedlander, Gadamer developed an approach to Plato that rejected the\nidea of any ‘hidden’ doctrine in Plato’s thought, looking\ninstead to the structure of the Platonic dialogues themselves as the\nkey to understanding Plato’s philosophy. The only way to understand\nPlato, as Gadamer saw it, was thus by working through the Platonic\ntexts in a way that not only enters into the dialogue and dialectic\nset out in those texts, but also repeats that dialogic movement in the\nattempt at understanding as such. Moreover, the dialectical structure\nof Platonic questioning also provides the model for a way of\nunderstanding that is open to the matter at issue through bringing\noneself into question along with the matter itself. Under the\ninfluence of Heidegger, Gadamer also took up, as a central element in\nhis thinking, the idea of phronesis (‘practical\nwisdom’) that appears in Book VI of Aristotle’s Nichomachean\nEthics. For Heidegger the concept of phronesis is\nimportant, not only as a means of giving emphasis to our practical\n‘being-in-the world’ over and against theoretical\napprehension, but it can additionally be seen as constituting a mode\nof insight into our own concrete situation (both our practical\nsituation and, more fundamentally, our existential situation, hence\nphronesis constitutes a mode of self-knowledge). The way in\nwhich Gadamer conceives of understanding, and interpretation, is as\njust such a practically oriented mode of insight—a mode of\ninsight that has its own rationality irreducible to any simple rule or\nset of rules, that cannot be directly taught, and that is always\noriented to the particular case at hand. The concept of\nphronesis can itself be seen as providing a certain\nelaboration of the dialogic conception of understanding Gadamer had\nalready found in Plato. Taken together, phronesis and\ndialogue provide the essential starting point for the development of\nGadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics. \n\nTraditionally, hermeneutics is taken to have its origins in problems\nof biblical exegesis and in the development of a theoretical framework\nto govern and direct such exegetical practice. In the hands of\neighteenth and early nineteenth century theorists, writers such as\nChladenius and Meier, Ast and Schleiermacher, hermeneutics was\ndeveloped into a more encompassing theory of textual interpretation in\ngeneral—a set of rules that provide the basis for good interpretive\npractice no matter what the subject matter. Inasmuch as hermeneutics\nis the method proper to the recovery of meaning, so Wilhelm Dilthey\nbroadened hermeneutics still further, taking it as the methodology for\nthe recovery of meaning that is essential to understanding within the\n‘human’ or ‘historical’ sciences (the\nGeisteswissenschaften). For these writers, as for many\nothers, the basic problem of hermeneutics was methodological: how to\nfound the human sciences, and so how to found the science of\ninterpretation, in a way that would make them properly\n‘scientific’.  Moreover, if the mathematical models and\nprocedures that appeared to be the hallmark of the sciences of nature\ncould not be duplicated in the human sciences, then the task at issue\nmust involve finding an alternative methodology proper to the human\nsciences as such—hence Schleiermacher’s ambition to develop a\nformal methodology that would codify interpretive practice, while\nDilthey aimed at the elaboration of a ‘psychology’ that\nwould elucidate and guide interpretive understanding. \n\nAlready familiar with earlier hermeneutic thinking, Heidegger\nredeployed hermeneutics to a very different purpose and within a very\ndifferent frame. In Heidegger’s early thinking, particularly the\nlectures from the early 1920s (‘The Hermeneutics of Facticity’),\nhermeneutics is presented as that by means of which the investigation\nof the basic structures of factical existence is to be pursued—not\nas that which constitutes a ‘theory’ of textual\ninterpretation nor a method of ‘scientific’ understanding,\nbut rather as that which allows the self-disclosure of the structure\nof understanding as such. The ‘hermeneutic circle’ that\nhad been a central idea in previous hermeneutic thinking, and that had\nbeen viewed in terms of the interpretative interdependence, within any\nmeaningful structure, between the parts of that structure and the\nwhole, was transformed by Heidegger, so that it was now seen as\nexpressing the way in which all understanding was ‘always\nalready’ given over to that which is to be understood (to\n‘the things themselves’—‘die Sachen\nselbst’). Thus, to take a simple example, if we wish to\nunderstand some particular artwork, we already need to have some prior\nunderstanding of that work (even if only as a set of paint marks on\ncanvas), otherwise it cannot even be seen as something to be\nunderstood. To put the point more generally, and in more basic\nontological terms, if we are to understand anything at all, we must\nalready find ourselves ‘in’ the world ‘along\nwith’ that which is to be understood. All understanding that is\ndirected at the grasp of some particular subject matter is thus based\nin a prior ‘ontological’ understanding—a prior\nhermeneutical situatedness. On this basis, hermeneutics can be\nunderstood as the attempt to ‘make explicit’ the structure\nof such situatedness. Yet since that situatedness is indeed prior to\nany specific event of understanding, so it must always be presupposed\neven in the attempt at its own explication. Consequently, the\nexplication of this situatedness—of this basic ontological mode of\nunderstanding—is essentially a matter of exhibiting or\n‘laying-bare’ a structure with which we are already\nfamiliar (the structure that is present in every event of\nunderstanding), and, in this respect, hermeneutics becomes one with\nphenomenology, itself understood, in Heidegger’s thinking, as just\nsuch a ‘laying bare’. \n\nIt is hermeneutics, in this Heideggerian and phenomenological sense,\nthat is taken up in Gadamer’s work, and that leads him, in conjunction\nwith certain other insights from Heidegger’s later thinking, as well as\nthe ideas of dialogue and practical wisdom, to elaborate a\nphilosophical hermeneutics that provides an account of the nature of\nunderstanding in its universality (where this refers both to the\nontologically fundamental character of the hermeneutical situation and\nthe all-encompassing nature of hermeneutic practice) and, in the\nprocess, to develop a response to the earlier hermeneutic tradition’s\npreoccupation with the problem of interpretive method. In these\nrespects, Gadamer’s work, in conjunction with that of Heidegger,\nrepresents a radical reworking of the idea of hermeneutics that\nconstitutes a break with the preceding hermeneutical tradition, and yet\nalso reflects back on that tradition. Gadamer thus develops a\nphilosophical hermeneutics that provides an account of the proper\nground for understanding, while nevertheless rejecting the attempt,\nwhether in relation to the Geisteswissenschaften or elsewhere,\nto found understanding on any method or set of rules. This is not a\nrejection of the importance of methodological concerns, but rather an\ninsistence on the limited role of method and the priority of\nunderstanding as a dialogic, practical, situated activity. \n\nIn 1936 Heidegger gave three lectures on ‘The Origin of the Work\nof Art’. In these lectures, not published until 1950, Heidegger\nconnects art with truth, arguing that the essence of the artwork is\nnot its ‘representational’ character, but rather its\ncapacity to allow the disclosure of a world. Thus the Greek temple\nestablishes the ‘Greek’ world and in so doing allows\nthings to take on a particular appearance within that world. Heidegger\nrefers to this event of disclosure as the event of\n‘truth’. The sense of truth at issue here is one that\nHeidegger presents in explicit contrast to what he views as the\ntraditional concept of truth as ‘correctness’. Such correctness\nis usually taken to consist in some form of correspondence between\nindividual statements and the world, but so-called\n‘coherence’ accounts of truth, according to which truth is\na matter of the consistency of a statement with a larger body of\nstatements, can also be viewed as based upon the same underlying\nnotion of truth as ‘correctness’. While Heidegger does not\nabandon the notion of truth as ‘correctness’, he argues that it\nis derivative of a more basic sense of truth as what he terms\n‘unconcealment’. Understood in this latter sense, truth is\nnot a property of statements as they stand in relation to the world,\nbut rather an event or process in and through which both the things of\nthe world and what is said about them come to be revealed at one and\nthe same time—the possibility of ‘correctness’ arises on the\nbasis of just such ‘unconcealment’. \n\nIt is important to recognize, however, that the unconcealment at issue\nis not a matter of the bringing about of some form of complete and\nabsolute transparency. The revealing of things is, in fact, always\ndependent upon other things being simultaneously concealed (in much\nthe same way as seeing something in one way depends on not seeing it\nin another). Truth is thus understood as the unconcealment that allows\nthings to appear, and that also makes possible the truth and falsity\nof individual statements, and yet which arises on the basis of the\nongoing play between unconcealment and concealment—a play\nthat, for the most part, remains itself hidden and is never capable of\ncomplete elucidation. In the language Heidegger employs in ‘The\nOrigin of the Work of Art’, the unconcealment of\n‘world’ is thereby grounded in the concealment of\n‘earth’. It is this sense of truth as the emergence of\nthings into unconcealment that occurs on the basis of the play between\nconcealing and unconcealing that is taken by Heidegger as the essence\n(or ‘origin’) of the work of art. This idea of truth, as\nwell as the poetic language Heidegger employed in his exposition, had\na decisive effect on Gadamer’s own thinking. Indeed, Gadamer described\nhis philosophical hermeneutics as precisely an attempt “to take up and\nelaborate this line of thinking from the later Heidegger” (Gadamer\n1997b, 47) \n\nThere are two crucial elements to Gadamer’s appropriation of Heidegger\nhere: first, the focus on art, and the connection of art with truth;\nsecond, the focus on truth itself as the event of prior and partial\ndisclosure (or more properly, of concealment/unconcealment) in which\nwe are already involved and that can never be made completely\ntransparent. Both of these elements are connected with Gadamer’s\nresponse to the subjectivist and idealist elements in German thought\nthat were present in the neo-Kantian tradition, and, more\nspecifically, in romantic hermeneutics and aesthetic theory. As\nGadamer saw it, aesthetic theory had, largely under the influence of\nKant, become alienated from the actual experience of art—the\nresponse to art had become abstracted and\n‘aestheticised’—while aesthetic judgment had become\npurely a matter of taste, and so of subjective response. Similarly,\nunder the influence of the ‘scientific’ historiography of\nthose such as Ranke, together with the romantic hermeneutics associated with\nSchleiermacher and others, the desire for objectivity had led to the\nseparation of historical understanding from the contemporary situation\nthat motivates it, and to a conception of historical method as based\nin the reconstruction of the subjective experiences of the\nauthor—a reconstruction that, as Hegel made clear, is surely\nimpossible (see Gadamer 1989b, 164–9). \n\nBy turning back to the direct experience of art, and to the concept of\ntruth as prior and partial disclosure, Gadamer was able to develop an\nalternative to subjectivism that also connected with the ideas of\ndialogue and practical wisdom taken from Plato and Aristotle, and of\nhermeneutical situatedness taken from the early Heidegger. Just as the\nartwork is taken as central and determining in the experience of art,\nso is understanding similarly determined by the matter to be\nunderstood; as the experience of art reveals, not in spite of, but\nprecisely because of the way it also conceals, so understanding is\npossible, not in spite of, but precisely because of its prior\ninvolvement. In Gadamer’s developed work, the concept of\n‘play’ (Spiel) has an important\nrole here. Gadamer takes play as the basic clue to the ontological\nstructure of art, emphasizing the way in which play is not a form of\ndisengaged, disinterested exercise of subjectivity, but is rather\nsomething that has its own order and structure to which one is given\nover. The structure of play has obvious affinities with all of the\nother concepts at issue here—of dialogue, phronesis, the\nhermeneutical situation, the truth of art.  Indeed, one can take all\nof these ideas as providing slightly different elaborations of what is\nessentially the same basic conception of understanding—one that\ntakes our finitude, that is, our prior involvement and partiality, not\nas a barrier to understanding, but rather as its enabling\ncondition. It is this conception that is worked out in detail in\nTruth and Method. \n\nOne might respond to Gadamer’s emphasis on our prior hermeneutic\ninvolvement, whether in the experience of art or elsewhere, that such\ninvolvement cannot but remain subjective simply on the grounds that it\nis always determined by our particular dispositions to experience\nthings in certain ways rather than others—our involvement, one\nmight say, is thus always based on subjective prejudice. Such\nan objection can be seen as a simple reiteration of the basic tendency\ntowards subjectivism that Gadamer rejects, but Gadamer also takes\nissue directly with this view of prejudice and the negative\nconnotations often associated with the notion, arguing that, rather\nthan closing us off, our prejudices are themselves what open us up to\nwhat is to be understood. In this way Gadamer can be seen as\nattempting to retrieve a positive conception of prejudice (German\nVorurteil) that goes back to the meaning of the term\nas literally a pre-judgment (from the Latin\nprae-judicium) that was lost during the Renaissance. In\nTruth and Method, Gadamer redeploys the notion of our prior\nhermeneutical situatedness as it is worked out in more particular\nfashion in Heidegger’s Being and Time (first published in\n1927) in terms of the ‘fore-structures’ of understanding, that\nis, in terms of the anticipatory structures that allow what is to be\ninterpreted or understood to be grasped in a preliminary fashion. The\nfact that understanding operates by means of such anticipatory\nstructures means that understanding always involves what Gadamer terms\nthe ‘anticipation of completeness’—it always\ninvolves the revisable presupposition that what is to be understood\nconstitutes something that is understandable, that is, something that\nis constituted as a coherent, and therefore meaningful, whole. \n\nGadamer’s positive conception of prejudice as pre-judgment is\nconnected with several ideas in his approach to hermeneutics. The\nway in which our prejudgments open us up to the matter at issue in\nsuch a way that those prejudgments are themselves capable of being\nrevised exhibits the character of the Gadamerian conception of\nprejudgment, and its role in understanding, as itself constituting a\nversion of the hermeneutic circle. The hermeneutical priority Gadamer\nassigns to prejudgment is also tied to Gadamer’s emphasis on the\npriority of the question in the structure of understanding—the\nlatter emphasis being something Gadamer takes both from Platonic\ndialectic and also, in Truth and Method, from the work of\nR. G. Collingwood. Moreover, the indispensable role of prejudgment in\nunderstanding connects directly with Gadamer’s rethinking of the\ntraditional concept of hermeneutics as necessarily involving, not\nmerely explication, but also\napplication. In this respect, all interpretation, even of the\npast, is necessarily ‘prejudgmental’ in the sense that it is always\noriented to present concerns and interests, and it is those present\nconcerns and interests that allow us to enter into the dialogue with\nthe matter at issue. Here, of course, there is a further connection\nwith the Aristotelian emphasis on the practical—not only is\nunderstanding a matter of the application of something like ‘practical\nwisdom’, but it is also always determined by the practical context out\nof which it arises. \n\nThe prejudicial character of understanding means that, whenever we\nunderstand, we are involved in a dialogue that encompasses both our\nown self-understanding and our understanding of the matter at\nissue. In the dialogue of understanding our prejudices come to the\nfore, both inasmuch as they play a crucial role in opening up what is\nto be understood, and inasmuch as they themselves become evident in\nthat process. As our prejudices thereby become apparent to us, so they\ncan also become the focus of questioning in their own turn. While\nGadamer has claimed that ‘temporal distance’ can play a\nuseful role in enabling us better to identify those prejudices that\nexercise a problematic influence on understanding (Gadamer\nacknowledges that prejudices can sometimes distort—the point is\nthat they do not always do so), it seems better to see the dialogical\ninterplay that occurs in the process of understanding itself as the\nmeans by which such problematic elements are identified and worked\nthrough. One consequence of Gadamer’s rehabilitation of prejudice is a\npositive evaluation of the role of authority and tradition as\nlegitimate sources of knowledge, and this has often been seen, most\nfamously by Jürgen Habermas, as indicative of Gadamer’s\nideological conservatism—Gadamer himself viewed it as merely\nproviding a proper corrective to the over-reaction against these ideas\nthat occurred with the Enlightenment. \n\nInasmuch as understanding always occurs against the background of our\nprior involvement, so it always occurs on the basis of our\nhistory. Understanding, for Gadamer, is thus always an\n‘effect’ of history, while hermeneutical\n‘consciousness’ is itself that mode of being that is conscious\nof its own historical ‘being effected’—it is\n‘historically-effected consciousness’\n(wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein). Awareness of the\nhistorically effected character of understanding is, according to\nGadamer, identical with an awareness of the hermeneutical situation\nand he also refers to that situation by means of the phenomenological\nconcept of ‘horizon’\n(Horizont)—understanding and interpretation thus always\noccurs from within a particular ‘horizon’ that is\ndetermined by our historically-determined situatedness.  Understanding\nis not, however, imprisoned within the horizon of its\nsituation—indeed, the horizon of understanding is neither static\nnor unchanging (it is, after all, always subject to the effects of\nhistory). Just as our prejudices are themselves brought into question\nin the process of understanding, so, in the encounter with another, is\nthe horizon of our own understanding susceptible to change. \n\nGadamer views understanding as a matter of negotiation between oneself\nand one’s partner in the hermeneutical dialogue such that the process\nof understanding can be seen as a matter of coming to an\n‘agreement’ about the matter at issue. Coming to such an\nagreement means establishing a common framework or\n‘horizon’ and Gadamer thus takes understanding to be a\nprocess of the ‘fusion of horizons’\n(Horizontverschmelzung). In phenomenology, the\n‘horizon’ is, in general terms, that larger context of\nmeaning in which any particular meaningful presentation is\nsituated. Inasmuch as understanding is taken to involve a\n‘fusion of horizons’, then so it always involves the\nformation of a new context of meaning that enables integration of what\nis otherwise unfamiliar, strange or anomalous. In this respect, all\nunderstanding involves a process of mediation and dialogue between\nwhat is familiar and what is alien in which neither remains\nunaffected. This process of horizonal engagement is an ongoing one\nthat never achieves any final completion or complete\nelucidation—moreover, inasmuch as our own history and tradition\nis itself constitutive of our own hermeneutic situation as well as\nbeing itself constantly taken up in the process of understanding, so\nour historical and hermeneutic situation can never be made completely\ntransparent to us. As a consequence, Gadamer explicitly takes issue\nwith the Hegelian ‘philosophy of reflection’ that aims at\njust such completion and transparency. \n\nIn contrast with the traditional hermeneutic account, Gadamer thus\nadvances a view of understanding that rejects the idea of understanding\nas achieved through gaining access to some inner realm of subjective\nmeaning. Moreover, since understanding is an ongoing process, rather\nthan something that is ever completed, so he also rejects the idea that\nthere is any final determinacy to understanding. It is on this basis\nthat Gadamer argues against there being any method or technique for\nachieving understanding or arriving at truth. The search for a\nmethodology for the Geisteswissenschaften that would place\nthem on a sound footing alongside the ‘sciences of nature’ (the\nNaturwissenschaften)—a search that had characterized\nmuch previous hermeneutical inquiry—is thus shown to be\nfundamentally misguided. Not only is there no methodology that\ndescribes the means by which to arrive at an understanding of the\nhuman or the historical, but neither is there any such methodology\nthat is adequate to the understanding of the non-human or the\nnatural. Gadamer’s conception of understanding as not reducible to\nmethod or technique, along with his insistence of understanding as an\nongoing process that has no final completion, not only invites\ncomparison with ideas to be found in the work of the later\nWittgenstein, but can also be seen as paralleling developments in\npost-Kuhnian philosophy of science. \n\nThe basic model of understanding that Gadamer finally arrives at in\nTruth and Method is that of conversation. A conversation\ninvolves an exchange between conversational partners that seeks\nagreement about some matter at issue; consequently, such an exchange\nis never completely under the control of either conversational\npartner, but is rather determined by the matter at issue. Conversation\nalways takes place in language and similarly Gadamer views\nunderstanding as always linguistically mediated. Since both\nconversation and understanding involve coming to an agreement, so\nGadamer argues that all understanding involves something like a common\nlanguage, albeit a common language that is itself formed in the\nprocess of understanding itself. In this sense, all understanding is,\naccording to Gadamer, interpretative, and, insofar as all\ninterpretation involves the exchange between the familiar and the\nalien, so all interpretation is also translative. Gadamer’s commitment\nto the linguisticality of understanding also commits him to a view of\nunderstanding as essentially a matter of conceptual articulation. This\ndoes not rule out the possibility of other modes of understanding, but\nit does give primacy to language and conceptuality in hermeneutic\nexperience.  Indeed, Gadamer takes language to be, not merely some\ninstrument by means of which we are able to engage with the world, but\nas instead the very medium for such engagement. We are\n‘in’ the world through being ‘in’\nlanguage. This emphasis on the linguisticality of understanding does\nnot, however, lead Gadamer into any form of linguistic relativism.\nJust as we are not held inescapably captive within the circle of our\nprejudices, or within the effects of our history, neither are we held\ncaptive within language. Language is that within which anything that\nis intelligible can be comprehended, it is also that within which we\nencounter ourselves and others. In this respect, language is itself\nunderstood as essentially dialogue or conversation. Like Wittgenstein,\nas well as Davidson, Gadamer thus rejects the idea of such a thing as\na ‘private language’—language always involves others,\njust as it always involves the world. \n\nGadamer claims that language is the universal horizon of hermeneutic\nexperience; he also claims that the hermeneutic experience is itself\nuniversal. This is not merely in the sense that the experience of\nunderstanding is familiar or ubiquitous. The universality of\nhermeneutics derives from the existential claim for hermeneutics that\nHeidegger advanced in the 1920s and that Gadamer made into a central\nidea in his own thinking. Hermeneutics concerns our fundamental mode\nof being in the world and understanding is thus the basic phenomenon\nin our existence. We cannot go back ‘behind’\nunderstanding, since to do so would be to suppose that there was a\nmode of intelligibility that was prior to understanding. Hermeneutics\nthus turns out to be universal, not merely in regard to knowledge,\nwhether in the ‘human sciences’ or elsewhere, but to all\nunderstanding and, indeed, to philosophy itself.  Philosophy is, in\nits essence, hermeneutics. Gadamer’s claim for the universality of\nhermeneutics was one of the explicit points at issue in the debate\nbetween Gadamer and Habermas (see Ormiston & Schrift [eds.] 1990);\nit can also be seen as, in a certain sense, underlying the engagement\nbetween Gadamer and Derrida (see Michelfelder & Palmer [eds.]\n1989), although in Derrida’s case this consisted in a denial of the\nprimacy of understanding, and the possibility of agreement, on which\nhermeneutics itself rests. \n\nGadamer’s commitment to the historically conditioned character of\nunderstanding, coupled with the hermeneutic imperative that we engage\nwith our historical situatedness, means that he takes philosophy to\nitself stand in a critical relation to the history of philosophy.\nGadamer’s own thought certainly reflects a hermeneutical commitment to\nboth philosophical dialogue and historical engagement. His public\ndebates with contemporary figures such as Habermas and Derrida,\nalthough they have not always lived up to Gadamer’s own ideals of\nhermeneutic dialogue (at least not in respect of Derrida), have\nprovided clear evidence of Gadamer’s own commitment to such engagement.\nThe dialogue with philosophy and its history also makes up a large part\nof Gadamer’s published work and, while that dialogue has encompassed a\nrange of thinkers, its primary focus has been on Plato, Aristotle,\nHegel and Heidegger.  \n\nIn the case of Plato and Aristotle (see Gadamer 1980, 1986a, 1991),\nGadamer has argued for a particular way of reading both thinkers that\nattends to the character of their texts, that takes those texts to\ndisplay a high degree of consistency, and that, particularly in the\nlater work, also views Plato and Aristotle as holding essentially\nsimilar views. In The Beginning of Philosophy (1997a),\nGadamer also takes Plato and Aristotle as providing the indispensable\npoint of entry to an understanding of Pre-Socratic thought. When it\ncomes to Hegel (see Gadamer 1971), although there is much that\nGadamer finds sympathetic to his own hermeneutic project (particularly\nHegel’s attempt to move beyond the dichotomy of subject and object, as\nwell as aspects of Hegel’s revival of ancient dialectic), Gadamer’s\ncommitment to a hermeneutics of finitude (and so to what Hegel terms\n‘bad infinity’) places him in direct opposition to the\nHegelian philosophy of reflection that aims at totality and\ncompletion. It is with Heidegger, however, that Gadamer had his most\nsignificant, sustained and yet also most problematic philosophical\nengagement (see especially Gadamer 1994a). Although Gadamer\nemphasized the continuities between his own work and that of\nHeidegger, and was clearly gratified by those occasions when Heidegger\ngave his approval to Gadamer’s work, he can also be seen as involved\nin a subtle reworking of Heidegger’s ideas. On a number of points,\nthat reworking has a rather different character from that which is\nexplicit in Heidegger. In particular, Gadamer argues that Heidegger’s\nattempts, in his later thinking, to find a\n‘non-metaphysical’ path of thought led Heidegger into a\nsituation in which he experienced a ‘lack of (or need for)\nlanguage’ (a Sprachnot). Gadamer’s own\nwork can thus be seen as an attempt to take up the path of Heidegger’s\nlater thought in a way that does not abandon, but rather attempts to\nwork with our existing language. Similarly, while Heidegger views the\nhistory of philosophy as characterized by a ‘forgetting’\nof being—a forgetting that is inaugurated by Plato—Gadamer takes\nthe history of philosophy to have no such tendency. In this respect,\nmany of the differences between Gadamer and Heidegger become clearest\nin their differing readings of the philosophical tradition, as well as\nin their approaches to poets such as Hölderlin. \n\nThe engagement with literature and art has been a continuing feature\nthroughout Gadamer’s life and work and, in particular, Gadamer has\nwritten extensively on poets such as Celan, Goethe, Hölderlin,\nand Rilke (see especially Gadamer 1994b, 1997c). Gadamer’s engagement\nwith art is strongly influenced by his dialogue with the history of\nphilosophy, and he draws explicitly on Hegel as well as Plato. At the\nsame time, that engagement provides an exemplification of Gadamer’s\nhermeneutics as well as a means to develop it further, while his\nhermeneutic approach to art itself constitutes a rethinking of\naesthetics through the integration of aesthetics into hermeneutics. In\ncontrast to much contemporary aesthetics, Gadamer takes the experience\nof beauty to be central to an understanding of the nature of art and\nin the final pages of Truth and Method, he discusses the\nbeautiful as that which is self-evidently present to us (as\n‘radiant’) exploring also the close relationship between\nthe beautiful and the true. Of particular importance in his writing\nabout art and literature are the three ideas that appear in the\nsubtitle to ‘The Relevance of the Beautiful’ (1986b): art\nas play, symbol and festival. The role of play is a central notion in\nGadamer’s hermeneutic thinking generally, providing the basis for\nGadamer’s account of the experience both of art and understanding (see\n Aesthetics and Subjectivism\n above). The symbolic character of the artwork is seen, by Gadamer,\nnot in terms of any form of simple ‘representationalism’,\nbut instead in terms of the character of art as always showing\nsomething more than is literally present to us in the work (this\naspect of art as referring outside itself is also taken up by Gadamer\nelsewhere in relation to the character of art as\n‘imitation’—mimesis). The artwork, no matter\nwhat its medium, opens up, through its symbolic character, a space in\nwhich both the world, and our own being in the world, are brought to\nlight as a single, but inexhaustibly rich totality. In the experience\nof art, we are not merely given a ‘moment’ of vision, but\nare able to ‘dwell’ along with the work in a way that\ntakes us out of ordinary time into what Gadamer calls\n‘fulfilled’ or ‘autonomous’ time.  Thus the artwork\nhas a festive, as well as symbolic and playful character, since the\nfestival similarly takes us out of ordinary time, while also opening\nus up to the true possibility of community. \n\nGadamer’s emphasis on application in understanding already implies\nthat all understanding has a practical orientation in the sense of\nbeing determined by our contemporary situation. Gadamer has himself\nengaged, however, in more direct reflection on a range of contemporary\nissues (see Gadamer 1976a, 1989a, 1993b, 1998b, 1999, 2001, see also\nKrajewski 2003). Much of Gadamer’s discussion of these issues depends\nupon the hermeneutic ideas he has worked out elsewhere. A central\nconcern in many of Gadamer’s essays is the role of Europe, and\nEuropean culture, in the contemporary world—something that was\nespecially pressing for Gadamer with the advent of German\nreunification and the expansion of the European community (see\nespecially Gadamer 1989a). Here, however, a number of other closely\nconnected issues also come into view: the nature and role of modern\nscience and technology (see especially 1976a, 1998b), and together\nwith this, the role of the humanities; the question of education and,\nin particular, of humanistic education (1992); the issue of\nunderstanding between cultures, and especially between religions. In\naddition, Gadamer has written on matters concerning law, ethics, the\nchanging character of the modern university, the connection between\nphilosophy and politics, and the nature of medical practice and the\nconcept of health (see especially Gadamer 1993b).  In almost all of these areas, Gadamer’s approach is characterized,\nnot by the attempt to apply any pre-existing theory to the domain in\nquestion, but rather by the attempt to think from within that domain,\nand in a way that is attentive to it. As Gadamer comments in Truth\nand Method, ‘application is neither a subsequent nor merely\nan occasional part of the phenomenon of understanding, but\nco-determines it as a whole from the beginning’ (Gadamer 1989b,\n324). Theory and application do not occur, then, in separation from\none another, but are part of a single hermeneutical\n‘practice’. Gadamer’s interest in practical philosophy has been reflected in\nthe way his work has itself been taken up within many other\ndomains—within, for instance, medical practice (e.g., Svenaues\n2003), intercultural studies (e.g., Garfield 2002, Lammi 2008)),\neducation (e.g., Fairfield 2012), environmental education and ecology\n(e.g., Grün 2005), literary studies (e.g., Weinsheimer 1991),\narchitecture (e.g., Snodgrass and Coyne 2006), law (e.g., Mootz 2007\n(Other Internet Resources)), and also theology (e.g., Lawrence\n2002—on all of these topics, see also the various chapters in\nSection V of Malpas & Gander 2014).","contact.mail":"Jeff.Malpas@utas.edu.au","contact.domain":"utas.edu.au"}]
