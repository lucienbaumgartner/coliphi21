His Introduction to Logic, written in the middle of the\ncentury, was one of the four most influential textbooks on logics in\nthe 13th century, along with Lambert of Auxerre’s Summary,\nRoger Bacon’s Art and Science of Logic, and Peter of Spain’s\nSummaries of Logic. Roger Bacon in his Opus tertium\n(1267) singles Sherwood out for high praise, describing him as\n“much wiser than Albert [the Great]; for in philosophia\ncommunis no one is greater than he” (Kretzmann 1966, pp.\n5–6; Kretzmann 1968, pp. 3–4).\n\nWilliam of Sherwood was born between 1200 and 1205, probably in\nNottinghamshire, and died between 1266 and 1272. His school career is\nuncertain, but given references to his works and his influence on\npeople such as Peter of Spain, Lambert of Auxerre, Albert the Great,\nand Thomas Aquinas, it is likely that he was teaching logic at the\nUniversity of Paris between 1235 and 1250. After that period, he seems\nto have left logic. He was a master at Oxford in 1252 and treasurer of\nthe cathedral of Lincoln about two years later; still later, he was\nrector at Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, and Attleborough, in Norfolk.\nHe was still alive in 1266 but dead by 1272 (Kretzmann 1968, p.\n3). \nPart of the difficulty with establishing his biography is that he has\npreviously been conflated with various other 13th-century Englishmen\nnamed William, such as William of Leicester (d. 1213) and William of\nDurham (d. 1249) (cf. Grabmann 1937, pp. 11–13; Kretzmann 1966, p. 3;\nMullinger 1873, p. 177). He has also sometimes been identified with\nothers bearing the same surname, such as the author of commentary, now\nlost, on the Sentences of Peter Lombard with the title\nShirovodus super sententias, a work that was known to John\nLeland in the 16th century (Kretzmann 1966, p. 12), or Ricardus de\nSchirewode, who wrote a treatise on insolubles surviving in Cambridge,\nSt John’s MS 100. This confusion, along with the usual problems\npresented by anonymous material, makes it difficult to identify\nWilliam’s works with certainty. \nTwo works can be confidently ascribed to Sherwood, an Introduction\nto Logic and a treatise on syncategorematic terms, the\nSyncategoremata. The Introduction survives in complete\nform in only one manuscript, Bibliothèque Nationale MS. Lat.\n16,617, from the late 13th or 14th century, which begins with the\nheading Introductiones Magistri Guilli. de Shyreswode in\nlogicam, “Introduction to Logic of Master William of\nSherwood”. The Syncategoremata immediately follows, and\nis likewise explicitly attributed to Sherwood. The\nSyncategoremata also survives in a second manuscript, Bodleian\nMS Digby 55, where it is again explicitly labeled, Sincategoreumata\nMagistri Willielmi de Sirewode “[Treatise on]\nSyncategorematics of Master William of Sherwood”, and Chapter\nFive of the Introduction survives in a second manuscript, MS\nWorcester Cath. Q. 13, written around 1293/94, and edited by Pinborg\n& Ebbesen (1984). \nThe Introduction was almost certainly written while William was\nlecturing on logic at the University of Paris. It was first edited by\nGrabmann (1937) and translated into English by Kretzmann (1966). A new\ncritical edition was produced by Brands and Kann (1995), accompanied\nby a translation into German. It has been argued (Mullinger 1873, p.\n177) that this book was heavily influenced by a Synopsis\ntreatise written by the 11th-century Byzantine logician Michael\nConstantine Psellus. The Introduction contains the first\nappearance of the syllogistic mnemonic verse ‘Barbara,\nCelarent…’, which Augustus de Morgan described as “magic\nwords … more full of meaning than any that ever were made”, and\nSherwood may even have been the inventor of the verse, though\nreferences to individual names appear earlier (Kretzmann 1966, pp.\n66–67). \nSherwood’s treatise on syncategorematic terms has long been held to be\nif not the earliest such treatise, then the earliest still accessible\n(Boehner 1952, p. 7). The text was first edited by O’Donnell (1941),\nand this edition along with the Paris MS was the basis of Kretzmann’s\n1968 translation into English. O’Donnell’s edition has since been\nsuperceded by the critical edition of Kann and Kirchhoff (2012), which\nalso includes a translation into German.  Kirchhoff (2008) is an extensive discussion and commentary on the Syncategormeta. \nThree other logical treatises follow the Introductiones and the\nSyncategoremata in the Paris manuscript, which have as a result\nbeen tentatively attributed to Sherwood. The first is a treatise on\ninsolubles, ff. 46–54, edited by Roure (1970), and the second a\ntreatise on obligationes found in Paris, Bibl. Nat. 16617. This\ntext was edited by Green (1963), who tentatively attributed it to\nSherwood. The third is the text Petitiones Contrariorum, edited\nby de Rijk (1976), covering puzzles arising from hidden contradictions\nin sets of premises. Sherwood may also be the author of the\nFallaciae magistri Willelmi “Fallacies, of Master\nWilliam” preserved in British Museum, King’s Library MS 9 E XII,\nas well as the treatise ascribed to Richard of Sherwood noted\nabove. \nThree further treatises have previously also been attributed to\nSherwood, but the evidence for their attribution is less clear: the\ncommentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard noted above, a\nDistictiones theologicae, and a Concionces, or\ncollection of sermons (Kretzmann 1968, p. 4). \nAlong with Peter of Spain, Lambert of Auxerre, and Roger Bacon,\nWilliam of Sherwood was one of the first terminist logicians, working\nin a context where the newly discovered and translated Aristotelian\nmaterial of the 12th century had become fully integrated into the\nlogical and philosophical curricula through the works of people such\nas John le Page (Uckelman & Lagerlund, 2016). The terminist period\nof logic was marked by the development of logical genres and\ntechniques that go beyond Aristotle and mere commentaries on his\nworks. The two primary branches of terminist logic are the study of\nthe properties of terms and the study of the meaning and function of\nsyncategorematic words. Sherwood’s Introduction picks up the\nfirst of these two branches in its fifth chapter, and his\nSyncategoremata deals with the second. The remainder of the\nIntroductiones is devoted to the standard Aristotelian\nmaterial: Chapter One on statements corresponds to On\nInterpretation; Chapter Two on predicables to the\nCategories; Chapter Three on syllogisms to the Prior\nAnalytics; Chapter Four on dialectical reasoning to the\nTopics; and Chapter Six on sophistical reasoning to the\nSophistical Refutations. We will focus our attention in this\narticle on the unusual or distinctive aspects of his logical and\nsemantic theory, as found in Chapter Five of the Introduction and in the Syncategoremata. \nIn his Introduction, Sherwood gives two definitions for\n‘mode’, depending on whether the term is being used\nbroadly or strictly: “Broadly speaking, a mode is the\ndetermination of an act, and in this respect it goes together with\nevery adverb”, while strictly speaking we count not all adverbs\nas modes but only those which determine the inherence of the predicate\nin the subject (Kretzmann 1966, p. 40).  Thus, on the broad conception\nof ‘mode’, both “Socrates is necessarily\nrunning” and “Socrates is swiftly running” count as\nmodal statements, but on the narrow conception, only the former\ndoes. The six modes are ‘true’, ‘false’,\n‘possible’, ‘contingent’,\n‘impossible’, and ‘necessary’, though\n“the first two do not distinguish a modal proposition from an\nassertoric statement” (Kretzmann 1966, pp. 40–41). The\nother four modes give rise to properly modal propositions, and in\nstatements expressing these propositions, the associated modal adverbs\nare ‘possibly’, ‘contingently’,\n‘impossibly’, and ‘necessarily’.  Each of\nthese modal adverbs is a syncategorematic term; and in\nthe Syncategoremata, Sherwood devotes an entire chapter\nto necessario (‘necessarily’)\nand contingenter (‘contingently’). \nHere it must be noted that Sherwood’s views of modality differ\nsignificantly from modern views. Modern modal logic interprets modes\nin a nominal way, e.g., ‘necessary:’,\n‘impossible:’, etc. But Sherwood is reluctant to admit a\nstatement such as “That Socrates is running is necessary”\nas genuinely modal (Kretzmann 1966, p. 43), instead viewing this as an\nassertoric categorical statement predicating ‘necessary’\nof “that Socrates is running”. Similarly, “Socrates\nis running necessarily” does not count as a modal statement,\nbecause here ‘necessarily’ modifies ‘running’,\nnot “the inherence of the predicate in the subject”. The\nonly genuinely modal construction is that exhibited by “Socrates\nis necessarily running” (Kretzmann 1966, p. 42).  The importance\nof the adverbial construction, where the modal adverb modifies the\ninherence of the predicate with the subject, is emphasized in the\ndiscussions of modal adverbs in Syncategoremata, which include\nnot only the chapter mentioned above but also analyses of how modal\nadverbs interact with other syncategorematic terms such as\n“only”, “unless”, and “if”\n(Uckelman 2020, §5). \nSince Aristotle it was standard practice to note that\n‘possible’ can be used in two ways. In the first\n‘possible’ is compatible with ‘necessary’, but\nin the second, that which is necessary is not (merely) possible. This\nsecond way is usually called ‘contingent’. Sherwood\nmentions this distinction, but goes on to say that he will be using it\nin a broader sense, in which possibility is compatible with necessity\n(Kretzmann 1966, p. 41). However, he makes a further distinction,\nwhich he does maintain, between the two ways that\n‘impossible’ and ‘necessary’ can be used.\nThese different ways are expressed in temporal notions: \n[impossible] is used in one way of whatever cannot be true now or in\nthe future or in the past; and this is ‘impossible per\nse’ … It is used in the other way of whatever cannot be\ntrue now or in the future although it could have been true in the\npast … and this is ‘impossible per accidens’.\nSimilarly, in case something cannot be false now or in the future or\nin the past it is said to be ‘necessary per se’ … But it\nis ‘necessary per accidens’ in case something cannot be\nfalse now or in the future although it could have been [false] in the\npast (Kretzmann 1966, p. 41). \nSherwood says that the reason it is important to separate modal\npropositions from assertoric ones is that \n[s]ince our treatment is oriented toward syllogism, we have to\nconsider them under those differences that make a difference in\nsyllogism. These are such differences as … modal, assertoric; and\nothers of that sort. For one syllogism differs from another as a\nresult of those differences (Kretzmann 1966, p. 39). \nDespite this, there is “no treatment of modal syllogisms in any\nof the works that have been ascribed to Sherwood” (Kretzmann\n1966, p. 39, fn. 58). For more on Sherwood’s account of modality, see\n(Uckelman 2008). \nThe theory of the “properties of terms” forms the basis of\nmedieval semantic theory and provides an account of how terms function\nwithin the broader context of sentences, as well as how these\ndifferent functions can account for the different rules governing\ninference. Sherwood identifies the four main properties of terms as\n(1) signification; (2) supposition; (3) copulation; and (4)\nappellation (Kretzmann 1966, p. 105). In this classification he\ndiffers from other accounts which mention (1) signification; (2)\nsupposition and copulation; (3) ampliation and restriction; (4)\nappellation; and (5) relation. \nSherwood defines ‘signification’ as “a presentation\nof the form of something to the understanding”, a definition\nharking back to 12th-century semantic theory (Kretzmann 1966, p. 105,\nfn. 2). Supposition and copulation are symmetrically related to each\nother; ‘supposition’ is “an ordering of the\nunderstanding of something under something else” while\n‘copulation’ is “an ordering of the understanding of\nsomething over something else” (Kretzmann 1966, p. 105). Only\nsubstantive nouns, pronouns, and definite descriptions can have\nsupposition, while only adjectives, participles, and verbs can have\ncopulation (Kretzmann 1966, p. 106). \nFinally, ‘appellation’ is “the present correct\napplication of a term — i.e., the property with respect to which what\nthe term signifies can be said of something through the use of the\nverb ‘is’” (Kretzmann 1966, p. 106). That is, the\nappellata of a term are the presently existing things of which\nthe term can currently be truly predicated. Appellation is between\nsupposition and copulation: Substantive nouns, adjectives, and\nparticiples can have appellation, but pronouns and verbs cannot\n(Kretzmann 1966, p. 106). \nThe central notion of these three is supposition, and the majority of\nthe chapter is devoted to the division of supposition into its various\nkinds: \nFor a discussion of most of the notions in this division as well as a\ncomparison of Sherwood’s views to those of his 13th-century\ncontemporaries and his 14th-century posterity, see the article\n Medieval Theories: Properties of Terms.\n We briefly comment on ‘manerial’ supposition, a type\nwhich does not appear outside of Sherwood. Some have considered\nmanerialis an error for materialis, and considered\nSherwood to have been talking here about material supposition\n(Grabmann 1937). However, the manuscript shows n rather than\nt, and the type of supposition is not the same as the material\nsupposition, which is distinguished from formal supposition, but is\nitself a type of formal supposition. Sherwood says that manerial\nsupposition is a type of simple supposition in which “a word can\nbe posited for its significatum without any connection with\nthings”, and he gives as an example “Man is a\nspecies”. The explanation is that this is manerial supposition\nbecause ‘man’ “supposits for the specific character\nin itself” (Kretzmann 1966, p. 111). The notion of\nmaneries meaning ‘character, way, mode, manner’ can\nbe found in 12th-century discussions of universals; for example, John\nof Salisbury notes that Joscelin, Bishop of Soissons, says that\nsometimes the words genus and species “are to be\nunderstood as things of a universal kind” and sometimes he\n“interprets them as modes (maneries) of things”\n(Hall, Book II, ch. 17, p. 84). John says he does not know where\nJoscelin got such a distinction, but it occurs in Abelard and in the\n12th-century Fallacie Parvipontane (Hall, Book II, ch. 17, p.\n84, fnn. a, b; de Rijk 1962, pp. 139, 562). \nStatements are composed of two types of parts: principal and\nsecondary. The principal parts of a statement are the nouns and verbs,\nthat is, the subjects and predicates whose properties are the focus of\nthe first branch of terminist logic. The secondary parts are those\nthat remain: “the adjectival name, the adverb, and conjunctions\nand prepositions, for they are not necessary for the statement’s\nbeing” (Kretzmann 1968, p. 13). These are words which do not\nhave signification in themselves, but only in conjunction with other\nsignificative words, namely the subject and predicate (Kretzmann 1966,\np. 24). Because these words do not have signification in themselves,\nthey do not have any of the usual properties of terms — supposition,\ncopulation, and ampliation. Nevertheless, they still have a\nsignificative function. Explaining this function is the focus of\nSherwood’s treatise on syncategorematic terms. \nIt is in this treatise that we can see evidence for what some have\nsaid is a distinctively English approach to syncategorematic terms\n(Uckelman & Lagerlund 2016). Sherwood and his English contemporary\nBacon both consider distributive terms such as ‘every’ to\nbe syncategorematic, while in continental works such as those by John\nle Page, Peter of Spain, and Nicholas of Paris, distributive terms are\nusually considered in summary treatises in the chapter on distribution\n(a chapter found in no English summary) (Braakhuis 1981, pp. 138–139).\nIn his consideration of ‘every’, Sherwood argues that\npropositions involving ‘all’ require that there be at\nleast three things for which the predicate term truly stands: \nRule [II] The sign ‘every’ or ‘all’ requires\nthat there be at least three appellata (Kretzman 1968, p. 23). \n(Remember that an appellatum is something which both exists and\nwhich the subject stands for or refers to.) The justification for this\nis taken from Aristotle, who Sherwood quotes as saying “Of two\nmen we say that they are two, or both, and not that they are\nall” (Kretzmann 1968, p. 23). That is, if there were fewer than\nthree, it would be more appropriate to say ‘Both’ or\n‘One’ rather than ‘All’. \nSherwood is also noteworthy for being the first logician we know of to\ntreat ‘is’ as a syncategorematic term (Kretzmann 1968, p.\n90). He argues that ‘is’ is equivocal, in that it can\nindicate either (1) actual being (esse actuale) or (2) habitual\nbeing (esse habituale) (Kretzmann 1968, p. 92, Kretzmann 1966,\np. 125; Kretzmann translates habituale as\n‘relational’ in Kretzmann 1966 and as\n‘conditional’ in Kretzmann 1968). As a result, the\nsentence “Every man is an animal” is ambiguous. When\n‘is’ is taken to indicate actual being, “Every man\nis an animal” “is false when no man exists”\n(Kretzmann 1968, p. 93). When ‘is’ is taken to indicate\nhabitual being, then “insofar as [”Every man is an animal“] is\nnecessary it has the force of this conditional: ‘if it is man it\nis an animal’” (Kretzmann 1966, p. 125). In analyzing\nuniversal affirmative categorical sentences in this way, Sherwood can\nbe seen as an ‘early adopter’ of our modern truth\nconditions for these sentences. A consequence of this view is a\ncommitment to the existence of possibilia, things that could\nexist but which do not; such possibilia have a diminished sort\nof being (esse diminutum) (Kretzmann 1968, p. 93). This was an\nunusual position in the thirteenth century (Knuuttila 1993), and it\nwas later denounced by William of Ockham (Freddoso & Schuurman\n1980, p. 99). \nBacon’s approbation of Sherwood is not the only explicit reference we\nhave to him by his contemporaries. The copy of Chapter Five of the\nIntroduction found in MS Worcester Cath. Q. 13 mentioned\nearlier is followed by a collection of anonymous notes (also edited in\nPinborg & Ebbesen 1984 and there called the Dubitationes).\nPinborg and Ebbesen argue that these lecture notes, composed either\nfor a teacher’s or a student’s use, are unlikely to have been written\nin response to lectures given in the 1290s, i.e., when the manuscript\nwas copied, but rather date from the 1260s or the 1270s, favoring a\ndate around 1270 (Pinborg and Ebbesen 1984, p. 104). This text thus\nprovides evidence that Sherwood’s works continued to be taught and\ncirculated. \nBeyond these explicit mentions, it is clear that Sherwood’s works were\nwidely influential among logicians at the University of Paris in the\nsecond half of the 13th century. The most direct line of influence\nruns from William of Sherwood to his much better-known colleague Peter\nof Spain. It was for many years believed that Peter was the first\nperson to translate Psellus’s text (Mullinger 1873, p. 176), prior to\nthe rediscovery of Sherwood’s Introduction, which pre-dates\nPeter by two decades and which is closer to Psellus’s work. Peter’s\nSummary of Logic is clearly indebted to Sherwood. Kretzmann\nnotes that “many of the features of the Summulae that\nmade it far and away the most popular logic textbook in the Middle\nAges seem quite plainly to have developed as modifications of more\ndifficult discussions and less felicitous mnemonic devices in the\nIntroductiones” (Kretzmann 1968, p. 6). On the other\nhand, Sherwood appears to have been influenced by Peter’s treatise on\nsyncategorematic terms in writing his own; Kretzmann provides a\nsummary of passages in Sherwood’s treatise which “can be read as\nallusions to positions taken by Peter” (1968, p. 7). Other\ninfluences can be found in Albert the Great, who used Sherwood’s\nnotion of appellation rather than Peter of Spain’s (Kretzmann 1966, p.\n5), and Thomas Aquinas, whose analysis of modal propositions follows\nSherwood (Kretzmann 1966, p. 5; Uckelman 2008). Though Sherwood’s indirect influence on the development of logic and semantics, via his influence on Peter of Spain, should not be underestimated, his direct influence beyond the 13th century was more minimal, in part because the influence of Peter of Spain was so great.  In the 14th century, any influence Sherwood’s approach to the properties of terms might have still had was almost entirely eclipsed by figures such as William of Ockham, John Buridan, and Albert of Saxony (Bos 2011, p. 773).","contact.mail":"s.l.uckelman@durham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"durham.ac.uk"}]
