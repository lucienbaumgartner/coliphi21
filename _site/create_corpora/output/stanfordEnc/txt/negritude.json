Who are we?\nWhat are we in this white world?” And he commented:\n“That’s quite a problem” (Césaire 2005, 23).\n“Who am I?” is a question Descartes posed, and a reader of\nthe French philosopher naturally understands such a question to be\nuniversal, and the subject who says “I” here to stand for\nany human being. But when “who am I?” has to be translated\nas “who are we?” everything changes especially\nwhen the “we” have to define themselves against a world\nwhich leaves no room for who and what they are because they are black\nfolks in a world where “universal” seems to naturally mean\n“white”.\n\n\n\n“Négritude”, or the self-affirmation of black peoples,\nor the affirmation of the values of civilization of something defined\nas “the black world” as an answer to the question\n“what are we in this white world?” is indeed “quite a\nproblem”: it poses many questions that will be examined here\nthrough the following headings:\n\n\n\nThe concept of Négritude emerged as the expression of a revolt\nagainst the historical situation of French colonialism and racism. The\nparticular form taken by that revolt was the product of the encounter,\nin Paris, in the late 1920s, of three black students coming from\ndifferent French colonies: Aimé Césaire (1913–2008) from\nMartinique, Léon Gontran Damas (1912–1978) from Guiana and\nLéopold Sédar Senghor (1906–2001) from Senegal. Being\ncolonial subjects meant that they all belonged to people considered\nuncivilized, naturally in need of education and guidance from Europe,\nnamely France. In addition, the memory of slavery was very vivid in\nGuiana and Martinique. Aimé Césaire and Léon Damas\nwere already friends before they came to Paris in 1931. They were\nclassmates in Fort-de-France, Martinique, where they both graduated\nfrom Victor Schoelcher High School. Damas came to Paris to study Law\nwhile Césaire had been accepted at Lycée Louis Le Grand\nto study for the highly selective test for admission to the prestigious\nÉcole Normale Supérieure on rue d’Ulm. Upon his arrival at\nthe Lycée on the first day of classes he met Senghor who had\nalready been a student at Louis le Grand for three years. \n\nCésaire has described his first encounter with Senghor as\nfriendship at first sight which would last for the rest of their fairly\nlong lives. He has also added that their personal friendship meant the\nencounter between Africa and the African\n Diaspora.[1]\nCésaire, Damas and Senghor\nhad individual lived experiences of their feeling of revolt against a\nworld of racism and colonial domination. In the case of Césaire\nthat feeling was expressed in his detestation of Martinique which, as\nhe confessed in an interview with French author Françoise Vergès, he\nwas happy to leave after high school: he hated the “colored\npetit-bourgeois” of the island because of their\n“fundamental tendency to ape Europe” (Césaire 2005,\n19). As for Senghor, he has written that in his revolt against his\nteachers at College Libermann high school in Dakar, he had discovered\n“négritude” before having the concept: he refused to accept\ntheir claim that through their education they were building\nChristianity and civilization in his soul where there was nothing but\npaganism and barbarism before. Now their encounter as people of African\ndescent regardless of where they were from would lead to the\ntransformation of their individual feelings of revolt into a concept\nthat would also unify all Black people and overcome the separation\ncreated by slavery but also by the prejudices born out of the different\npaths taken. Césaire has often evoked the embarrassment felt by\npeople from the Caribbean at the idea of being associated with Africans\nas they shared Europe’s ideas that they were now living in the\nlands of the civilized. He quotes as an example a\n“snobbish” young Antillean who came to him protesting that\nhe talked too much about Africa, claiming that they had nothing in\ncommon with that continent and its peoples: “they are savages, we\nare different” (Césaire 2005, 28). \n\nBeyond the encounter between Africa and the French Caribbean\nCésaire, Senghor and Damas also discovered together the American\nmovement of Harlem Renaissance. At the “salon”, in Paris,\nhosted by sisters from Martinique, Jane, Paulette and Andrée\nNardal, they met many Black American writers, such as Langston Hughes\nor Claude McKay. With the writers of the Harlem Renaissance movement\nthey found an expression of black pride, a consciousness of a culture,\nan affirmation of a distinct identity that was in sharp contrast to\nFrench assimilationism. In a word they were ready to proclaim the\nnégritude of the “new Negro” to quote the title of the\nanthology of Harlem writers by Alain Locke which very much impressed\nSenghor and his friends (Vaillant 1990, 93–94). An important precision needs to be made here about the space\ncreated by the Nardal sisters for Negritude. Thus, T. Deanan\nSharpley-Whiting calls attention to the fact that a “masculinist\ngenealogy constructed by the poets and shored up by literary\nhistorians, critics, and Africanist philosophers continues to elide\nand minimize the presence and contributions of black women, namely\ntheir francophone counterparts, to the movement’s evolution”\n(Sharpley-Whiting, 2000, 10). And she quotes a letter from Paulette\nNardal, written in 1960, in which she “‘bitterly\ncomplained’ of the erasure of her and Jane Nardal’s roles in the\npromulgation of the ideas that would later become the hallmarks of\nCésaire, Damas, and Senghor” (Sharpley-Whiting, 2000,\n10). It must be recalled, in particular, concerning the\n“genealogy” of the movement, that an article by Jane\nNardal, entitled “Internationalisme noir”, published in\n1928, predated by more than ten years the first important theoretical\narticle published by Senghor: “What the Black Man\nContributes” (published in 1939). What Jane Nardal says in her\nshort article about a “Negro sprit” transcending the\ndifferences inevitably created by the course of history, about the\nimportance of “turning back toward Africa (…) in remembering a\ncommon origin”, or about the significance, first and foremost\nfor the Africans themselves, of the discovery by Europeans (first the\n“snobs and artists” among them) of “Negro art”\nand, more generally, “the centers of African civilizations,\ntheir religious systems, their forms of government, their artistic\nwealth” (Nardal, 2002, 105–107), are all notions and themes that\nwill be developed by Senghor, Césaire, and Damas. \n\nThe proclamation of Negritude would be done when the three friends founded the journal\nL’Etudiant noir, in 1934–1935 where the word was coined\nby Aimé Césaire. It was meant to be (and, above all, to\nsound like) a provocation. Nègre,\nderived from the Latin “niger”, meaning\n“black”, is used in French only in relation to black people\nas in “art nègre”. Applied to a black person it had\ncome to be charged with all the weight of racism to the point that the\ninsult “sale nègre” (dirty\nnègre) would be almost redundant, “sale” being\nsomehow usually understood in “nègre”. So to coin\nand claim the word “Négritude”\n(Négrité, using the French suffix\n–ité instead of -itude was considered\nand dropped) as the expression of the value of “blackness”\nwas a way for Césaire, Senghor and Damas of defiantly turning\n“nègre” against the white supremacists who used it\nas a slur. In sum the word was and has continued to be an irritant.\nIndeed the “fathers” of the movement themselves would often\nconfess how irritated they were too by the word. Thus, Césaire\ndeclared at the beginning of a lecture he gave on February 26, 1987, at\nthe International University of Florida in Miami: “…I\nconfess that I do not always like the word Négritude even if I am the\none, with the complicity of a few others, who contributed to its\ninvention and its launching” adding that, still, “it\ncorresponds to an evident reality and, in any case to a need that\nappears to be a deep one” (Césaire 2004, 80). “What\nis that reality?” Césaire proceeded then asking. That is\nindeed the question: is there a content and a substance of the concept\nof Négritude beyond the revolt and the proclamation? In other\nwords, is Négritude mainly a posture of revolt against oppression the\nmanifestation of which is primarily the poetry it produced, or is it a\nparticular philosophy characteristic of a black worldview? One of the\nmost eloquent expression of Négritude as a posture primarily is to be\nfound in an Aimé Césaire’s address delivered in\nGeneva on June 2nd 1978 on the occasion of the creation by\nRobert Cornman of a cantata entitled Retour and inspired\nby the Notebooks of a Return to the Native Land. In that\naddress reproduced in Aimé Césaire, pour regarder le\nsiècle en face, the poet from Martinique declares: \n\nIn fact both answers have been given to that question of posture of\nrevolt vs. philosophical substance, at different moments and in\ndifferent circumstances by Négritude writers. Nevertheless, it can be\nsaid that Césaire and Damas have put more emphasis on the\ndimension of poetic revolt while Senghor has insisted more on\narticulating Négritude as a philosophical content, as “the sum\ntotal of the values of civilization of the Black World”, thus\nimplying that it is an ontology, an aesthetics, an epistemology, or a\npolitics. \n\nFollowing the example of Alain Locke, Leon Damas in 1947 and\nLéopold Sédar Senghor a year later published\nAnthologies of poetry to manifest the existence of Négritude\nas an aesthetics and as a literary movement. \n\nIn the “Introduction” to his Poètes\nd’expression française 1900–1945, Damas proclaimed\nthat “the time of blocking out and inhibition” had now\ngiven place to “another age: that in which the colonized man\nbecomes aware of his rights and of his duties as a writer, as a\nnovelist or a story-teller, an essayist or a poet.” And he stated\nthe literary and political significance of his Anthology in\nnon ambiguous terms: “Poverty, illiteracy, exploitation of man by\nman, social and political racism suffered by the black or the yellow,\nforced labor, inequalities, lies, resignation, swindles, prejudices,\ncomplacencies, cowardice, failures, crimes committed in the name of\nliberty, of equality, of fraternity, that is the theme of this\nindigenous poetry in French” (Damas 1947, 10). It is\nimportant to notice that he meant his anthology to be a\nmanifesto, not so much for Négritude, than for the Colonized in\ngeneral, as he insisted that the sufferings of colonialism were the\nburden of “the black and the yellow” and as he featured in\nthe selection poets from Indochina and Madagascar. Or rather Damas\nunderstood the concept of Négritude (in fact the word does not appear\nin the “Introduction” to the anthology) to encompass people\nof color in general as they were under the domination of European\ncolonialism. This is a broader meaning of Négritude that the\n“fathers” of the movement always kept in mind. Damas’\nview about the substance of the poetry he was presenting, about what\nthe poets gathered in his book had in common besides living the same\ncolonial situation, is generally the same as Etienne\nLéro’s, whose “Misère d’une\npoésie” (“Poverty of a Poetry”) he\nquotes\n abundantly.[2]\n In a vitalistic language that characterizes Négritude\nLéon Damas opposes, using Léro’s language, the vitality\nof this “new poetry” to what he denounced as “white\nliterary decadence” (to be contrasted with the revolutionary\nnature of surrealist philosophy and literature). He quoted in\nparticular Léro’s denunciation of writers from the Caribbean\n“mulatto society, intellectually … corrupt and\nliterarily nourished with white decadence” to the point that\nsome of them would make it a matter of pride that a white person could\nread their whole book without being able to tell “what their\nactual complexion was” (Damas 1947, 13). The\n“Introduction” was indeed a manifesto for Négritude\nas a vital poetic force that Damas (and Léro) identified as\n“the wind rising from Black America” which in turn\nexpresses “the African love for life, the African joy in love,\nthe African dream of death” (Damas 1947, 13). \n\nSenghor’s Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie\nnègre et malgache de langue française, (An Anthology\nof the New Negro and Malagasy Poetry in French), published in 1948,\nwould eventually overshadow Damas’ anthology and his\n“Introduction” to it as a manifesto for the Négritude\nmovement. Senghor’s own “Introduction” is just five\nshort paragraphs as it devoted only to the technicalities of selecting\nthe poets gathered in the book (interestingly, unlike Damas, his choice\nis restricted to the “Blacks”, the Malagasies being\naccording to him “mélaniens” (Senghor 1948,\n2)). But what contributed greatly to the fame of the Anthology\nand propelled Négritude into the broad intellectual conversation was\nthe “Preface” written for it by French philosopher and\npublic intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre (1906–1980). The title of the\n“preface”, Black Orpheus, referring to the Greek\nmyth about the evocative force of poetry but also about its eventual\nimpotence in front of fate and death, fully expresses what can be\ncalled the kiss of death the existentialist philosopher gave to the\nmovement. \n\nBy writing Black Orpheus as an account of the ultimate\nmeaning of the black poetry gathered in the Anthology Sartre\ntransformed Négritude into an illustration of his own philosophical\ntheses and durably set the terms in which the concept was to be\ndiscussed from then on. \n\nOne important point made by Sartre was that Négritude was first and\nforemost a black poetic appropriation of the French language. Unlike\nother nationalisms, he explained, which reclaimed the tongue of the\npeople against the imperialist imposition of the language by which they\nwere governed, black people had to use the language of domination\nimposed by French colonialism as cement for their shared Négritude and\nas “miraculous\n weapons”[3]\nagainst that same domination. In so doing they\nradically transformed it, manifesting through their poetry that there\nwas nothing natural and unquestionable in the way in which the language\nwould identify Being with Good, Beautiful, Right and White. The simple\nsong of a black poet chanting in French the beauty of the naked\nblackness of the woman he loved, Sartre wrote, would then appear to the\nears of French people a fundamental violence against their linguistic\nand indeed ontological self assurance; in spite of the fact that the\npoem was not even meant for them, or rather because of that. In the\npoetry of Négritude they would be struck by the discovery of their own\nlanguage as unfamiliar and hitherto unheard of, especially when that\npoetry makes the best of surrealist writing as it “smashes [the\nwords] together, breaks their customary associations, and couples them\nby force” (Sartre 1976, 26). But then again one knows that such\nan unsettling of language and indeed its “auto destruction”\nis the “profound aim of French poetry … from\nMallarmé to the Surrealists” (1976, 25). Therefore, Sartre\nconcludes, Négritude has achieved that goal: the poets of Négritude\nhave taken to its end what surrealist writers had been calling for. \n\nSo while he praised Négritude as the revolutionary poetry of the\ntime, Sartre maintained the traditional Marxist view about the\nproletariat being the sole true revolutionary class and actor of\nhistory. Just as Eurydice was the creation of Orpheus’ power of\nevocation, Négritude was a creation of poetry, a “Myth dolorous\nand full of hope” and like “a woman who is born to\ndie” (Sartre 1976, 63). History and its laws had already\ncondemned Négritude to be just a Poem, indeed a swan song: the future\nof liberation was in the hand of the proletariat, the universal class\nwho was going to bring effective revolution and liberation from all\noppressions. When all is said and done and Négritude has permitted the\nblacks to “raise relentlessly the great negro cry until the\nfoundations of the world shall tremble” (Césaire’s\nLes armes miraculeuses quoted by Sartre as the last words of\nBlack Orpheus), it will have to be shed “to the profit\nof the Revolution” (1976, 65) by the only true actor of history\nwhich is the proletariat. In other words the “being-in-the-world\nof the Negro” as Sartre defined Négritude using Heideggerian\nlanguage is “subjective” while class is\n“objective”: the notion of race is concrete and particular,\nSartre writes, while that of class is universal and abstract; in the\nterminology of Karl Jaspers the first resorts to\n“comprehension” while the latter resorts to\n“intellection” (1976, 59). \n\nAgain, Sartre’s preface was a real kiss of death as it played\nan immense role in popularizing the Négritude movement and contributed\nto establishing Senghor’s Anthology as its manifesto,\nbut at the same time dismissed its historical significance by\nemphasizing that its being was ultimately only poetic, without\nreal\n substance.[4]\n And in fact, ironically, Black Orpheus contained and\nannounced most of the criticisms that would be directed at\nNégritude afterwards. First the criticism which very quickly\ncame from certain Marxists who accused Négritude of creating\nthe distraction of “race” where there should be only a\nfocus on objective social contradictions in the historic phase of the\nstruggle of the Proletariat to bring authentic liberation to the\noppressed workers in Europe and the dominated peoples in the\n world.[5] \n To that criticism some would add that by emphasizing the particular\nand the concrete of race over the objective and the universal of the\nstruggle against capitalism and imperialism, the “fathers”\nof Négritude, Senghor more specifically (since he led his\ncountry to independence and became its president for twenty years),\nseemed to imply that some cultural recognition and reconciliation was\nall that was needed: they accused Négritude of being, for that\nreason, an ideology for neocolonialism. Sartre’s “preface”\nalso foreshadowed the accusation of being an unfounded essentialism\npromoting the notion that black people shared a common identity,\npartaking in some enduring African-ness that defines them beyond\ndifferences in historical trajectories and circumstances, personal or\ncollective. \n\nThe paradox of Sartre’s preface to the Anthology by\nSenghor is that in many respects the Négritude movement had, after\nBlack Orpheus, to define itself against Sartre’s positioning\nof its philosophical meaning. It did so (1) by insisting that it was\nnot a mere particularism defined as the antithesis to a white\nsupremacist view (with black self affirmation using the figure of\ninversion that Sartre characterized as an anti-racist racism (1976,\n59)), before some dialectical post-racial synthesis; (2) by\nshowing that there was something substantial (and not just poetic) in\nthe reference to African values of civilization by which Senghor had\ndefined Négritude: that Négritude was indeed an\nontology, an epistemology, an aesthetics and a politics. \n\nWhen it comes to defining the substance of Négritude, there is\nan important difference between the three “fathers” of the\nmovement. Damas, a poet more than a theorist, spoke of it in the\n“introduction” of his anthology as the vital force behind\nany new and true—that is liberating—poetry. As to\nCésaire, he has often insisted that Négritude was\nprimarily the reclaiming of a heritage in order to regain\ninitiative. He declared:  \n\nUnlike Damas and Césaire, Senghor affirmed that\nNégritude was also the expression of a philosophy to be read in\nthe cultural products of Africa; and above all in African\nreligions. Different as they are from one region to another, from one\nculture to another, there is still ethnographical evidence that many\nof them share to be founded on an ontology of life forces. “The\nwhole system”, Senghor declares, in a lecture “On\nNégritude” delivered at Lovanium University in Kinshasa,\n“is founded on the notion of vital force.  Pre-existing,\nanterior to being, it constitutes being. God has given vital force not\nonly to men, but also to animals, vegetables, even minerals. By which\nthey are. But it is the purpose of this force to increase”\n(1993, 19). Senghor then explains that in the human being the increase\nof the force is the process of her becoming a\nperson “by being freer and freer within an\ninterdependent community” (1993, 19). He adds that the ultimate\nmeaning of religion is to assure the continuous increase of the vital\nforce of the living, in particular through the main ritual of the\nsacrifice of an animal. This ontology of life forces has been\nsummarized by Belgian philosopher Leo Apostel in the following\npropositions: \n\nPoint 6 in particular constitutes a good summary of the view shared\nby many African religions characterized as “animism” while\nthe other points help understand the particular type of causality that\nhas been labeled magical thinking. As early as in 1939, at a time when\nLeon Damas had already published his first collection of poems,\nPigments (1937) and Césaire had just finished a version\nof his Cahier d’un retour au pays natal (“Notebook\nof a return to my Native Land” (Césaire 2000a)), Senghor\nhad published an essay on the philosophy of Négritude entitled\n“Ce que l’homme noir apporte” (“What the Black\nMan Contributes”). As he explored in that essay the notion of\nrhythm as constitutive of what he called “the negro style”,\nSenghor was trying to say that the productions of African art were to\nbe understood first and foremost as the language of an ontology of\nvital forces. \n\nSo it is not surprising that he was so enthusiastic when, six years\nlater, he discovered a book by Reverend Father Placide Tempels diving a\nclear exposition of Bantu Philosophy as resting upon such an\nontology (Tempels 1945). Tempels was a Belgian Franciscan priest who\nwent to the Congo as a missionary. He had the view that in order to be\nmore efficient preaching the Gospel to the Bantu people he had first to\nunderstand the principles underlying their belief system, their\ncustomary law, their cultural habits, and so on. He explained that he\ncame to realize that one could and should go beyond mere ethnographical\ndescription of those characteristics of the people’s lives and\ndig out a set of ontological principles on which they were founded. In\nother words that there existed a Bantu philosophy of being\nunderlying their laws, behaviors, beliefs, politics, etc. The book,\nfirst written in Flemish then published in French in 1945 by\nPrésence africaine under the title La philosophie\nbantoue, became quite an event: it was one of the very first times\nthat an African people was associated with philosophy, an intellectual\npursuit considered at least since Hegel to be the unique telos\nof Western civilization. \n\nNothing probably is more indicative of the difference between\nLéopold Sédar Senghor and his friend Aimé\nCésaire than their respective reactions to the widely celebrated\nbook by Father Tempels. While Senghor embraced it as going along the\nsame lines he was exploring in his 1939 essay, Césaire’s\nreaction was one of rejection. It is not that Césaire did not\naccept the substance of Tempels’ theses. In fact the summary he\nmakes of them is perfectly adequate: “Now then, know that Bantu\nthought is essentially ontological”, he writes in his 1955\nDiscours sur le colonialisme\n [8],“that\nBantu ontology is based on the\ntruly fundamental notions of a life force and a hierarchy of life\nforces; and that for the Bantu the ontological order which defines the\nworld comes from God and, as a divine decree, must be respected”\n(Césaire 2000b, 58). In fact what provoked Césaire’s\nskepticism and sarcasm vis-à-vis Tempels’ work was its\nimplications as a tool to justify and perpetuate the colonial order.\n“Since Bantu thought is ontological”, he tittered,\n“the Bantu only ask for satisfaction of an ontological nature.\nDecent wages! Comfortable housing! Food! These Bantu are pure spirits,\nI tell you …” (Césaire 2000b, 58) Above\nall, there is for Césaire, the way in which the colonial order\nis made by Tempels a new part of Bantu ontology and therefore\nlegitimized and even sanctified in the eyes of the Bantu themselves:\n“As for the government, why should it complain?” Since the Rev.\nTempels notes with obvious satisfaction, “from their first\ncontact with the white man, the Bantu considered us from the only point\nof view that was possible to them, the point of view of their Bantu\nphilosophy” and “integrated us into their hierarchy of\nlife forces at a very high level” (Césaire 2000b,\n58). The final result being then that “the Bantu\ngod will take responsibility for the Belgian colonialist order, and any\nBantu who dare to raise his hand against it will be guilty of\nsacrilege” (Césaire 2000b, 58). \n\nIn sum, in the eyes of Senghor, Tempels’ Bantu\nphilosophy, along with Bergson’s philosophy of\nélan vital, provided the language of life\nphilosophy which he considered characteristic of the cultures of Africa\nand those of African\n origin.[9]\nFor him Négritude is an ontology of life forces\nto be described as a vitalism. Césaire who was more skeptical\nabout a philosophical content of the word dismissed Tempels’\nenterprise not on the basis of its substance but because of what he\nconsidered the intention behind the text of Bantu philosophy:\nan attempt to reform colonialism in order to perpetuate it.\n \n\nThe aspect on which Senghor insists the most is that of Négritude as\na philosophy of African art. One of the main activities of Senghor when\nhe first arrived in Paris at the end of the 1920s was to visit\nthe ethnographical museum at Place Trocadéro in Paris. By then\nthe vogue of art nègre (black art) had already produced\nits effects on modern European art. Pablo Picasso, in particular, in\n1906 had made the turn of making African sculptures and masks part of\nhis artistic pursuit: his Demoiselles d’Avignon, painted\nin 1906, manifested that move. The 1930s, the years when\nSenghor, Césaire and Damas started writing, is the time when\nwhat was labeled “primitive objects” were now more widely\nperceived as art, beyond the circles of the artistic avant-garde. The\nUniversal Exposition in Paris in 1931 showed that\nnew\n “sensibility”.[10] \n\nSenghor wanted Négritude to be the philosophy of the geometrical\nforms so characteristic of African masks and sculptures across\ndifferent regions and cultures. He would often explain that the raison\nd’être of art in Africa is not to reproduce or embellish\nreality but to establish the connection with what he labeled the\nsub-reality that is the universe of vital forces. What modern\nart understood from the consideration of art nègre is\nthat the issue was not anymore to simply reproduce sensible appearances\nbut to deal with the forces hidden beneath the surface of things. That\nis why the African objects at the Trocadéro museum were at once\nreligious and artistic artifacts. \n\nPlastic forms are life forces, they are rhythms. So objects such as\nmasks or sculptures are to be read as combinations of rhythms as we can\nsee in the following aesthetic analysis by Senghor of a feminine\nstatuette from Baule culture (in today Ivory Coast): “In it, two\nthemes of sweetness sing an alternating song. The breasts are ripe\nfruits. The chin and the knees, the rump and the calves are also\nfruits or breasts. The neck, the arms and the thighs are columns\nof black\n honey.”[11]\nThis reading establishes the object as a\ncomposition of two rhythmic series (what is referred to here,\npoetically, as two themes of sweetness): the concave forms of the\nbreasts, chin, knees, rump and calves, on the one hand; on the other\nhand, the cylindrical forms that are the neck, the arms and the thighs.\nThis example indicates what Senghor understands by “rhythm”\nand illustrates what he sees as its omnipresence in Black aesthetic\nproducts, as he certainly remembers here the notion expressed, ten\nyears before by Jane Nardal, of a “rule of rhythm, the sovereign master\nof [black] bodies” (Nardal, 2002, 105). In his first essay on\nNégritude, “What the Black Man Contributes”,\nSenghor wrote: \n\nSeventeen years later he would reiterate the same credo: \n\nIn 1966, L.S. Senghor, then the President of Senegal since the\ncountry became independent in 1960, organized in Dakar an international\nevent that he obviously intended to be a great moment of celebration of\nwhat he had been pursuing his whole life: the World Festival of Black\nArts, meant to be the concrete manifestation of black aesthetics in all\nits dimensions. Aimé Césaire, one of the most celebrated\nguests of honor at the Festival, was invited to give a “Lecture\non African Art” (“Discours sur\nl’art\n africain”).[13]\nHe first insisted on the question of the role\nand significance of art in general in the modern world, quoting the\npoet Saint-John Perse: “When mythology falls apart, it is in\npoetry that the divine finds refuge … it is from poetic\nimagination that the fierce passion of people seeking light gets its\nflame” (Thébia-Melsan 2000, 22). What Négritude poets did\neven if he does not like the word Négritude at all, declares\nCésaire, and in spite of their failings, was just that: to be\nlight bearers for Africa. Then he proceeded to ask whether African art\nof the past will be a catalyst for African art in the present and the\nfuture the way it had been for European art at the beginning of the\ntwentieth century. That was a way for him of calling the attention on\nthe questions at the core of his thinking about aesthetics (but also\npolitics): how to regain initiative? How to avoid the lack of\nauthenticity of sheer imitation or mimesis: mimesis of Europe\nas well as mimesis of one’s own artistic tradition. \n\nAs to his philosophy of art as such, Césaire’s views\nfollow consistently from his surrealist poetics and eventually converge\nwith his friend Senghor’s. Césaire’s notion of the\nprimordial role that should be played by the Dionysian in art\nversus the Apollonian. These are categories that\nCésaire and Senghor adopted from Nietzsche’s philosophy\n(Nietzsche’s Birth of Tragedy) to express the opposition\nbetween the primal, obscure force of life considered as an organic\nwhole (the Dionysian) on the one hand, and on the other hand the\nplastic beauty or the form which brings into light the individuality of\nthe object (the Apollonian): the Dionysian speaks to our emotion while\nthe Apollonian speaks to our intellectuality. Césaire evokes\nsuch a contrast when he states that: “The poetically beautiful is\nnot merely beauty of expression or muscular euphoria. A too Apollonian\nor gymnastic idea of beauty paradoxically runs the risk of skinning,\nstuffing, and hardening it.” This is the seventh and final thesis\nof the propositions summarizing his views about Poetry\nand\n Knowledge[14]\nand it is in perfect resonance with\nSenghor’s view of African art as the language of the ontology of\nvital forces. \n\nIn conclusion, Négritude as aesthetics is predicated on such\noppositions as those between sub-reality (or sur-reality) and\nappearance, force and form, emotion and intellect, Dionysian and\nApollonian. Césaire, Damas (as shown in the preface of his\nanthology) and Senghor all agreed that art was a vital\nresponse to the mechanistic and de-humanizing philosophy that produced\n(and was produced by) modern Europe. And like Nietzsche, they believed\nthat art was another approach by which a sense of the world as totality\nwould be restored. These lines from Césaire’s\n“Discourse on African Art” delivered in Dakar on April 6,\n1966, at the opening of the “World Festival of Negro Arts”\nsummarize Négritude philosophy of the significance of art, especially\nblack art: “Through art, the reified world becomes again the\nhuman world, the world of living realities, the world of communication\nand participation. From a collection of things, poetry and art remake\nthe world, a world which is whole, which is total and harmonious. And\nthat is why poetry is youth. It is the force that gives back to the\nworld its prime vitality, which gives back to everything its aura of\nmarvelous by replacing it within the original totality”\n(Thébia-Melsan, 2000, 21). \n\nAnd it can be argued that it is because of that significance of art\nthat Négritude also presented itself as another type of knowledge or\nepistemology and as another politics. \n\nIn the same 1939 essay in which he explored what he called the\n“rhythmic attitude” by which we enter in profound\nconnection with the object of art, its reality or its sub-reality,\nSenghor wrote the statement which is probably the most controversial of\nall his formulations of the philosophy of Négritude: “Emotion is\nNegro, as reason is Hellenic” (“L’émotion\nest nègre, comme la raison héllène”).\n(Senghor 1964, 288) The criticism was that the formula was an\nacceptance of the ethnological discourse of the Levy-Bruhlian type\nmaking a distinction between western societies suffused with\nrationality and the colonized world of what he labeled “inferior\nsocieties”, under the rule of “primitive mentality”.\nWhile rationality is defined by the use of the logical principles of\nidentity, contradiction and excluded middle and the empirical notion of\ncausality, primitive mentality functions according to a law of\n“participation” and magical thinking. The law means that a\nperson can be herself and at the same time be –or rather\nparticipate in the being of—her totem animal ignoring (or rather\nindifferent to) the principle of contradiction, and magical thinking,\nsuperposing a supernatural world to reality, allows for example action\nfrom distance in the absence of any causal link between two phenomena.\n(Levy-Bruhl 1926) For his critics, Senghor’s formula did ratify\nthe view of Lucien Levy-Bruhl, while the ethnologist himself eventually\nrecanted them in his Notebooks of Lucien Levy-Bruhl\nposthumously published ten years after his death in 1939. Aimé\nCésaire’s famous lines from The Notebook for a Return\nto the Native Land echo Senghor’s formula: \n\nJean-Paul Sartre who quoted these verses in Black Orpheus,\n(1976, 43–44) immediately after made this remark: “Upon\nreading this poem, one cannot help but think of the famous distinction\nwhich Bergson established between intelligence and intuition”\n(1976, 44). That remark makes an important point:\n“emotion” and “intuition” as approaches to\nreality in Négritude philosophy have more to do with Bergsonian\nphilosophy than with Levy-Bruhlian ethnology. Donna Jones rightly\nspeaks of Negritude as an “Afro-Bergsonian epistemology”. (Jones,\n2010) Senghor did use the language of the author of Primitive\nMentality, (Levy-Bruhl 1923) for example when he wrote in his\n1956 article on “Negro African Aesthetics” that\n“European reason is analytical by utilization, Negro reason is\nintuitive by participation” (1964, 203). But he also stated\nclearly, as early as in 1945, six years after the essay in which the\n(in)famous formula was written: “But are the differences not in\nthe ratio between elements more than in their nature? Underneath the\ndifferences, are there not more essential similarities? Above all,\nis reason not\nidentical among men? I do not believe in\n‘prelogical mentality.’ The mind cannot be\nprelogical, and it can even less be alogical” (1964, 42). This\naffirmation is clearly directed at Levy-Bruhl. So the influence on his\nthinking claimed by Senghor is rather Henri Bergson’s. The poet\noften refers to the importance of the “1889 Revolution”, in\nreference to the year of publication of Bergson’s Essay on\nthe immediate data of consciousness. Bergson, for Senghor, has\ngiven a philosophical expression to a new paradigm which, unlike\nCartesianism and, even before it, Aristotelianism, makes room for a type\nof knowledge which does not divide by analysis the subject from the\nobject and the object into its constitutive separated parts: different\nfrom the reason-that-separates, says Senghor following Bergson, there\nis a reason-that-embraces, which makes us experience “the lived\nidentity of knowledge and the known, the lived and the thought, the\nlived and the real” (1971, 287). That approach of reality is the\nother side of our analytical intelligence: according to Bergson, the\npush of life in evolution, the élan vital, has produced\nconsciousness. Now “consciousness, in man, is pre-eminently\nintellect. It might have been, it ought, so it seems, to have\nbeen also intuition. Intuition and intellect represent two\nopposite directions of the work of consciousness: intuition goes in the\nvery direction of life, intellect goes in the inverse direction, and\nthus finds itself naturally in accordance with the movement of\nmatter. A complete and perfect humanity would be that in which\nthese two forms of conscious activity should attain their full\ndevelopment” (Bergson 1944, 291–292). Clearly Bergson does not see\n“intuition” and “intelligence” as dividing\nhumanity into different types: he calls for their equal development in\na fully accomplished humanity.  \n\nTwo conclusions can be drawn from Senghor’s Bergsonism. First, the\nepistemology of Négritude, what he calls a Negro way of knowing\ndoes not simply reproduce Levy-Bruhl’s radical cognitive dualism which\nultimately divides humanity into two categories, the European and the\nnon-European. It is rather a way of emphasizing the role played by\nwhat Bergson has called “intuition” in the production of\nAfrican cultural objects, more particularly African art. Because, and\nthis is the second conclusion, when he speaks of an African\nepistemology in fact Senghor is still speaking about art and\naesthetics. He is speaking about art as knowledge, art as a particular\napproach to reality, art as the realm par excellence of intuitive\nknowledge or emotion. The meaning of “emotion” in\nSenghor’s formula corresponds to its definition by Jean-Paul Sartre as\na way of seeing the world as a “non-instrumental\ntotality”: “in this case, writes Sartre, the categories of\nthe world will act upon consciousness immediately. They are present to\nit without distance” (Sartre 1989, 52,90). \n\nWe can now conclude with a reexamination of Senghor’s\ninfamous formula, which he kept explaining again and again:\n“Emotion is Negro as Reason is Hellenic”. To pay\nattention to the context in which it was written is to recall that\nSenghor, in the late 1930s was absorbing not only ethnological\nliterature but also writings about “art nègre”. In\nparticular a book that he refers to in a simple footnote but which was\nvery influential on his thinking: Primitive Negro Sculpture by\nPaul Guillaume and Thomas Munro, published in the US in 1926 and\ntranslated into French in 1929. One of the main points made in\nthe book was to contrast Greco-Roman statuary expressing the ideal of\nthe beautiful form as it exists in reality even if it is transfigured\nby art and African sculpture as a manifestation of the life force\nbeneath the appearances of things. When that context is taken into\naccount, it becomes clear that Senghor’s neatly crafted formula\n(it is an alexandrine in French) can be read as an analogy: Hellenic\nart is to analytic reason what African art is to emotion. And thus it\nbecomes less scandalous as the simple expression of the Nietzschean way\nin which Senghor’s Négritude has considered art as knowledge and\naesthetics as epistemology. As Abiola Irele has rightly remarked:\n“Senghor’s theory of the African method of knowledge and\nhis aesthetic theory” are not just “intimately related\n[but] even coincide” (Irele 1990, 75). \n\nIn 1956 Aimé Césaire wrote a resounding public letter to\nMaurice Thorez, then the General Secretary of the French Communist\nParty, telling him that he was resigning from the party. He had been a\nmember for more than ten years and had been elected in 1946 as a\ncommunist mayor of Fort-de-France then as a Representative of France\nin the French Assembly. The three “fathers” of\nNégritude found themselves members of the same French\nParliament: Senghor who had been elected a deputy from Senegal in 1946\nwas sitting with the Socialists and so was Léon Damas who got\nelected to represent Guiana in 1948. \n\nIn his Letter to Maurice Thorez, Césaire started by\nenumerating his many grievances against a communist party that had\nuncritically pledged total allegiance to Russia before he came to\n“considerations related to [his] position as a man of\ncolor.”[15]\n As a person of African descent, he\ndeclared, his position expressed the singularity of a “situation\nin the world which cannot be confused with any other … of\n… problems which cannot be reduced to any other problem\n… [and] of [a] history, constructed out of terrible\nmisfortunes, that belong to no one else” (Césaire, 2010,\n147).  That is why “black peoples”, he argued, needed to\nhave their own organizations, “made for them, made by them, and\nadapted to ends that they alone [could] determine”\n(Césaire, 2010, 148).  Césaire insisted also that\nStalinist “fraternalism,” with its notions of the\n“advanced people” who must help “peoples who are\nbehind,” says nothing different than “colonialist\npaternalism.” (Césaire, 2010, 149) \n\nUltimately, what Césaire was seeking in formulations such as\n“it should be Marxism and communism at the service of black\npeoples, not black peoples at the service of the doctrine” was\nto define the notion of a people by means of culture rather than\npolitics. And consequently he was refusing to just dilute the cultural\ndimension of the existential response of black peoples to colonial\nnegation in Marxist universalism: Césaire’s\n“letter” was also, eight years later, a political response\nto Jean-Paul Sartre’s Black Orpheus. Is my decision an\nexpression of “provincialism”, Césaire asked at the\nend of his letter. “Not at all”, he answered.  “I am\nnot burying myself in a narrow particularism. But neither do I want to\nlose myself in an emaciated universalism.  There are two ways to lose\noneself: walled segregation in the particular or dilution in the\n‘universal’” (Césaire, 2010, 152). \n\nCésaire called then for the promotion of an “African\nvariety of communism” as a way of avoiding both pitfalls. Senghor\nalso has insisted on an African socialism born of a “Negro\nAfrican re-reading of Marx.” This African socialism of Senghor\ncould be presented briefly in two fundamental points: first the\ninsistence that it is the early Marx who can truly inspire an African\ndoctrine of socialism, second the understanding that socialism is a\nnatural development of African societies and cultures. So in article\ntitled “Marxism and humanism” and published in 1948 in\nRevue socialiste (a Journal sponsored by the French Socialist\nParty) Senghor notes that which will later be the point of departure\nfor Louis Althusser’s reading of Marx: between the early Marx and\nthe Marx who writes The Capital, there is an\nepistemological break. It is to be recalled here that in 1844 in\nParis, Marx wrote a certain number of texts that he just abandoned\nafterwards to “the criticism of the mice”. Those texts,\nknown as The 1844 Manuscripts were later discovered and\npublished in Leipzig in 1932. They manifest that Marx’s thinking\nand language were then fundamentally ethical as he was outraged by\nhuman condition under capitalist regime characterized by reification\nand alienation: human beings are alienated because, Marx writes, the\nproduct of their work sucks out their life force and stands in front of\nthem as strange and hostile artifacts. Alienation is the sentiment of\nliving in exile and imprisoned in a de-humanized world. The Marx who\nwrites the Capital will abandon that moral language and\nanalyze the condition of the working class through technical concepts,\nfor example that of extortion of surplus value. While Althusser\nconsidered this break the advent of Marxist science as an\n“anti-humanist theory” Senghor saw it as self-betrayal by\nMarx repudiating his identity as a philosopher and giving to his views\nthe appearance of dogmatic economic petrifactions. The task of an\nAfrican re-reading of Marx is then \n\nThe concept of alienation in particular, so central in the writings\nof the early Marx are at the heart of Senghor’s reflections on\nMarxism and liberation. Liberation for Senghor is liberation from all\nforces of alienation, natural and sociopolitical. And in his 1948\narticle he writes about the early works of Marx: “For us, men of\n1947, men living after two world wars, we who have just escaped the\nbloodthirsty contempt of dictators and who are threatened by other\ndictatorships, what profit is to be had in these works of youth!\nThey so nicely encapsulate the ethical principles of Marx, who proposes\nas the object of our practical activity the total liberation of\nman.” In Senghor’s vitalistic philosophy, total liberation\nwill be reached when the human being reaches the stage when her\nartistic end can now flourish, when the evolution from homo\nfaber to homo sapiens has now given birth to homo\nartifex. \n\nReflecting on what has been achieved by the Négritude movement,\nLucius Outlaw notes that for all the criticisms it has received,\n“nonetheless, the Négritude arguments, fundamentally,\ninvolved a profound displacement of the African invented by\nEuropeans.” And he continues: “It is this African challenge\nand displacement, through radical critique and counter-construction,\nthat have been deconstructive in particularly powerful and influential\nways: involving direct attacks on the assumed embodiment of the paragon\nof humanity in whites of Europe, an attack that forces this embodiment\nback upon itself, forces it to confront its own historicity, its own\nwretched history of atrocities, and the stench of the decay announcing\nthe impending death of the hegemonic ideal of the Greco-European\nRational Man” (Outlaw 1996, 67). \n\nL. Outlaw acknowledges that that was the main point of\nSartre’s Black Orpheus. It could now be argued that the\nquestion, today, is no longer that of a “deconstructive\nchallenge” to “the hegemonic ideal of the Greco-European\nRational Man” but that of what Outlaw calls “the\nreconstructive aspects of this challenge” (Outlaw 1996, 68). Has\nNégritude anything to contribute, today, to that\nreconstructive aspect? What does it say about the present and future of\nBlack arts, since Négritude as ontology, as epistemology, and even as\npolitics takes us back, according to Césaire and Senghor, to the\nphilosophy of art considered as a vital knowledge of a reality\nconceived as a web of forces? \n\nTo such a question, it can be said that Césaire had given an\nanswer in the conclusion of his 1966 Dakar address. There could\nbe no prescription of what African art should be. There is no model it\nshould imitate not even its own past. It has to continuously invent\nitself and that self invention is not to be separated from the question\nof Africa’s self invention. “African art of tomorrow will\nbe worth what Africa and the African of tomorrow are worth”,\nCésaire declared before ending his lecture with these final\nwords: “… the future of African art is in our hands. That\nis why to the African Heads of States who say: African artists, work to\nsave African art, here is what we respond: people of Africa and first\nof all you, African politicians, because you have more responsibility,\ngive us good African politics, make us a good Africa, create for us an\nAfrica where there are still reasons for hope, means for fulfillment,\nreasons to be proud, give back to Africa dignity and health, and\nAfrican art will be saved” (Thébia Melsan 2000, 25–26).\n \n\nOne way of raising the question of political relevance is to ask: is\nthere any room for a version of Négritude in what could be\nconsidered as a philosophical foundation of black\nsolidarity?[16]\nIn September 1956, at the First Meeting of Black Writers and Artists\nheld in Paris, at the Sorbonne, Aimé Césaire gave a\nlecture on “Culture and Colonization” (Césaire\n1956). This was quite a historic reflection, at a time of maturity for\nthe Négritude movement and just a few months before the shaking\nof decolonizations started with the independence of Ghana, on the\nrelationship between Négritude and Pan-Africanism. “What\nis the common denominator”, Césaire started his lecture\nby asking, “in this assembly gathering people as diverse as\nAfricans from Black Africa, North Americans, Caribbeans and\nMalagasies?” The first obvious answer, he declared, was that\nthey all lived in a situation that could be described as colonial,\nsemi-colonial or para-colonial. In fact, he continued, there are two\naspects in the solidarity of people of African descent gathered then\nat the Sorbonne: one that could be characterized as\n“horizontal” and one “vertical”. The\nhorizontal solidarity is political: Pan-Africanism or Black solidarity\nbetween Africans and the African Diaspora is their common response to\nthe situation of submission to colonialism and racism. The vertical\nsolidarity or “solidarity throughout time” is the way\npeople of African descent manifest different faces of an African\ncivilization. Not to be misunderstood, Césaire hastens\nto make the precision, with cultural commonality. African cultures in\nAfrica and in the African Diaporas are at least as different as Italian\nculture would be from Norwegian culture. But they share civilizational\ntraits in the same way Norwegian and Italian cultures share European\ntraits. Césaire’s distinction between cultures\n(characterized by difference) and civilization (defined by the\nexistence of commonalities) would mean that the “vertical”\ndimension of Pan-Africanism is what could be identified as Négritude.\nHow do we see Pan-Africanism today? \n\nOur times are dominated by the postcolonial and anti-essentialist\nview that differences should not be subsumed under a notion of Black\nidentity which might have worked as a response to colonial negation but\ndoes not have any substantial meaning (just what Sartre said in 1948,\nwhen he labeled Négritude an “anti-racist racism”, which\nSenghor and Césaire forcefully dismissed, insisting that their\nantiracist combat should never be confused with racism, even a counter\nor a reverse one). As an example, the créolité\nmovement in the Caribbean claimed creoleness as a continuous process of\nhybridization (“Neither Europeans, nor Africans, nor Asians, we\nproclaim ourselves Creoles”, the Créolité writers\nfamously stated at the beginning of the manifesto (Bernabé,\nChamoiseau, and Confiant 1990, 75)) turning its back on\nCésaire’s Négritude and his claim of an African heritage\nas constitutive of his identity: Négritude is ante-creole,\nthey wrote. This movement established itself as following from Edouard\nGlissant’s philosophy of creolization. This philosophy is based\non a distinction between what Glissant calls “atavistic\ncultures” grounded in some “creation myth of the\nworld” (a group to which sub-Saharan African cultures belong),\nand what he calls “composite cultures” “born from\nhistory” (Glissant 2003, 111). Thus, he asks, “my own\ngenesis, what is it if not the belly of the slave ship?” Not\nAfrica, then, where the ship was coming from with its hideous freight,\nbut the journey itself, the unpredictable becoming of the voyage to new\nshores, to new continuously proliferating, rhizomatic identities. The\nAfricanness of African-Americans could be another example. The demand\nto be called African-Americans after having been “Negroes”\nthen “Blacks” has certainly more to do with the internal\nidentity politics of being Americans in the same way Irish-Americans or\nChinese-Americans are than with any claim of substantial solidarity\nwith Africans. Pan-Africanism that is engagement and solidarity with\nthe African continent has always been the concern of a tiny elite among\nAfrican Americans (even if it is associated with considerable names\nsuch as Marcus Garvey or W.E.B. Dubois). \n\nWithin the African continent, there is today a renewed attempt at\nreviving Pan-Africanism under the form of African unity, what is\nreferred to sometimes as “the United States of Africa”. The\nAfrican Union has thus divided the continent into six great regions\nthat should achieve economic and political integration in a near future\nas a significant step towards continental unity. It is significant that\nthe decision was made to consider the African Diasporas a symbolic\nsixth region. Is that a gesture which will remain simply symbolic, a\nlast tip of the hat from the new pragmatic Pan-Africanism to the\nlyricism of Négritude about Black Solidarity (it should be noted that\nPan-Africanism means that the divide between sub-Saharan Africa and the\nMaghreb has no significance and that Africans are black as well as of\nEuropean or Asian descent)? In 1956, Césaire seemed to have been\nconscious that a “horizontal solidarity” as a response to a\nshared condition of living under colonial and racist domination was\nless problematic than a vertical solidarity throughout time binding\ntogether peoples who have come to develop very different cultures or,\nwithin the same nations, very different subcultures. He still believed\nin that shared “Négritude” as a “civilization”\nunder which those differences would be subsumed. But above all he\nbelieved, against any “incarcerating conception of\nidentity” (2004, 92) that Négritude, ultimately, amounts to the\ncontinuing fight against racism: “one can renounce the\nheritage”, he declared in his Miami address but “has one\nthe right to renounce the fight” when one understands that what\nis at stake today is not Négritude but racism, “seats of\nracism” here and there which need to be confronted if we are to\n“conquer a new and larger fraternity”? (2004, 90–92) \n\nTo dismiss too quickly Négritude as an essentialism of the past,\nwhich might have been necessary as a “deconstructive\nchallenge” to an oppressive colonial order but has nothing to say\nwhen it comes to the call for cosmopolitanism and creolization, would\nmiss an important dimension of that multifaceted\n movement.[17] The\nessentialist language is pervasive in Négritude literature, no doubt,\nbut so is the language of hybridity which can be seen as undermining it\nthe way Penelope used to undo at night what she had woven during the\nday. Senghor is as much a thinker of “métissage”\n(mixture) than he is a thinker of Négritude. His watchword,\n“everyone must be mixed in their own way” is as central to\nNégritude as the defense and illustration of the values of civilization\nof the black world. There is in fact a de-racialized use of the word\n“nègre” by Senghor which is crucial to understand\nwhy painter Pablo Picasso, poets Paul Claudel, Charles Péguy or\nArthur Rimbaud, philosopher Henri Bergson, etc. have been somehow\nenrolled by Senghor under the banner of “Négritude”. The\nmessage being, ultimately and maybe not so paradoxically, that one does\nnot have to be black to be a “nègre”.","contact.mail":"sd2456@columbia.edu","contact.domain":"columbia.edu"}]
