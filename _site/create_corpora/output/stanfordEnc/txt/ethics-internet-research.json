The Internet, as a field, a tool, and a venue,\nhas specific and far-reaching ethical issues. Internet research ethics\nis a subdiscipline that fits across many disciplines, ranging from\nsocial sciences, arts and humanities, medical/biomedical, and natural\nsciences. Extant ethical frameworks, including\n consequentialism,\n deontology,\n virtue ethics,\n and\n feminist ethics,\n have contributed to the ways in which ethical issues in Internet\nresearch are considered and evaluated.\n\n\nConceptually and historically, Internet research ethics is most\nrelated to computer and information ethics and includes such ethical\nissues as participant knowledge and consent, data privacy, security,\nanonymity and confidentiality, and integrity of data, intellectual\nproperty issues, and community, disciplinary, and professional\nstandards or norms. Throughout the Internet’s evolution, there\nhas been continued debate whether there are new ethical dilemmas\nemerging, or if the existing dilemmas are similar to dilemmas in other\nresearch realms (Elgesem 2002; Walther 2002; Ess & AoIR 2002;\nMarhkam & Buchanan 2012). These debates are similar to\nphilosophical debates in computer and information ethics. For example,\nmany years ago, James Moor (1985) asked “what is special about\ncomputers” in order to understand what, if anything, is unique\nethically. Reminding us, however, that research itself must be guided\nby ethical principles, regardless of technological intervention, van\nHeerden et al. (2020) and Sloan et al. (2020) stress that the\n“fundamental principles of conducting ethical social research\nremain the same” (Ess & AoIR 2002; King 1996; Samuel and\nBuchanan, 2020).\n\n\nYet, as the Internet has evolved into a more social and communicative\ntool and venue, the ethical issues have shifted from purely\ndata-driven to more human-centered. “On-ground” or\nface-to-face analogies, however, may not be applicable to online\nresearch. For example, the concept of the public park has been used as\na site where researchers might observe others with little ethical\ncontroversy, but online, the concepts of public versus private are\nmuch more complex (SACHRP 2013). Thus, some scholars suggest that the\nspecificity of Internet research ethics calls for new regulatory\nand/or professional and disciplinary guidance. For these reasons, the\nconcept of human subjects research policies and regulation, informs\nthis entry, which will continue discussions around ethical and\nmethodological complexity, including personal identifiability,\nreputational risk and harm, notions of public space and public text,\nownership, and longevity of data as they relate to Internet research.\nSpecifically, the emergence of the social web raises issues around\nsubject or participant recruitment practices, tiered informed consent\nmodels, and protection of various expectations and forms of privacy in\nan ever-increasing world of diffused and ubiquitous technologies.\nAdditional ethical concerns center on issues of anonymity and\nconfidentiality of data in spaces where researchers and their subjects\nmay not fully understand the terms and conditions of those venues or\ntools, challenges to data integrity as research projects can be\noutsourced or crowdsourced to online labor marketplaces, and\njurisdictional issues as more research is processed, stored, and\ndisseminated via cloud computing or in remote server locales,\npresenting myriad legal complexities given jurisdictional differences\nin data laws. Further, the dominance of big data research has\ncontinued across research spaces, with the notions of\n“real-world data” and pervasive computing readily accepted\nand used in all disciplines. The ease of access and availability to\nuse big data sets in myriad ways has enabled AI (artificial\nintelligence) and ML (machine learning) to grow as standard tools for\nresearchers.\n\n\nAs a result, researchers using the Internet as a tool for and/or a\nspace of research—and their research ethics boards (REBs), also\nknown as institutional review boards (IRBs) in the United States or\nhuman research ethics committees (HRECs) in other countries such as\nAustralia—have been confronted with a series of new ethical\nquestions: What ethical obligations do researchers have to protect the\nprivacy of subjects engaging in activities in “public”\nInternet spaces? What are such public spaces? Is there any reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in an era of pervasive and ubiquitous\nsurveillance and data tracking? How is confidentiality or anonymity\nassured online? How is and should informed consent be obtained online?\nHow should research on minors be conducted, and how do you prove a\nsubject is not a minor? Is deception (pretending to be someone you are\nnot, withholding identifiable information, etc.) an acceptable online\nnorm or a harm? How is “harm” possible to someone existing\nin an online space? How identifiable are individuals in large data\nsets? Do human subjects protections apply to big data? As more\nindustry-sponsored research takes place, what ethical protections\nexist outside of current regulatory structures? As laws, such as the\nEU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016) are enacted,\nwhat are the global implications for data privacy and individual\nrights?\n\n\nA growing number of scholars have explored these and related questions\n(see, for example, Bromseth 2002; Bruckman 2006; Buchanan 2004;\nBuchanan & Ess 2008; Johns, Chen & Hall 2003; Kitchin 2003,\n2008; King 1996; Mann 2003; Markham & Baym 2008; McKee &\nPorter 2009; Thorseth 2003; Ess 2016; Zimmer & Kinder-Kurlanda\n(eds.) 2017; Samuel & Buchanan, 2020), scholarly associations have\ndrafted ethical guidelines for Internet research (Ess &\nAssociation of Internet Researchers 2002; Markham, Buchanan, and AoIR\n2012; franzke et al., 2020; Kraut et al. 2004), and non-profit\nscholarly and scientific agencies such as AAAS (Frankel & Siang\n1999) are confronting the myriad of ethical concerns that Internet\nresearch poses to researchers and research ethics boards (REBs).\n\n\nGiven that over 50% of the world population uses the Internet, and\nthat 97% of the world population now lives within reach of a mobile\ncellular signal and 93% within reach of a 3G (or higher) network\n(International Telecommunications Union, 2019), continued exploration\nof the ethical issues related to research in this heavily mediated\nenvironment is critical.\n\nThe commonly accepted definition of Internet research ethics (IRE) has\nbeen used by Buchanan and Ess (2008, 2009), Buchanan (2011), and Ess\n& Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) (2002): \nIRE is defined as the analysis of ethical issues and\napplication of research ethics principles as they pertain to research\nconducted on and in the Internet. Internet-based research, broadly\ndefined, is research which utilizes the Internet to collect\ninformation through an online tool, such as an online survey; studies\nabout how people use the Internet, e.g., through collecting data\nand/or examining activities in or on any online environments; and/or,\nuses of online datasets, databases, or repositories. \nThese examples were broadened in 2013 by the United States\nSecretary’s Advisory Committee to the Office for Human Research\nProtections (SACHRP 2013), and included under the umbrella term\nInternet Research: \nA critical distinction in the definition of Internet research ethics\nis that between the Internet as a research tool versus a research\nvenue. The distinction between tool and venue plays out across\ndisciplinary and methodological orientations. As a tool, Internet\nresearch is enabled by search engines, data aggregators, digital\narchives, application programming interfaces (APIs), online survey\nplatforms, and crowdsourcing platforms. Internet-based research venues\ninclude such spaces as conversation applications (instant messaging\nand discussion forums, for example), online multiplayer games, blogs\nand interactive websites, and social networking platforms. \nAnother way of conceptualizing the distinction between tool and venue\ncomes from Kitchin (2008), who has referred to a distinction in\nInternet research using the concepts of “engaged web-based\nresearch” versus “non-intrusive web-based\nresearch:” \nNon-intrusive analyses refer to techniques of data collection that do\nnot interrupt the naturally occurring state of the site or\ncybercommunity, or interfere with premanufactured text. Conversely,\nengaged analyses reach into the site or community and thus engage the\nparticipants of the web source (2008: 15). \nThese two constructs provide researchers with a way of recognizing\nwhen considering of human subject protections might need to occur.\nMcKee and Porter (2009), as well as Banks and Eble (2007) provide\nguidance on the continuum of human-subjects research, noting a\ndistinction between person-based versus text-based. For example, McKee\nand Porter provide a range of research variables (public/private,\ntopic sensitivity, degree of interaction, and subject vulnerability)\nwhich are useful in determining where on the continuum of text-based\nversus how person-based the research is, and whether or not subjects\nwould need to consent to the research (2009: 87–88). \nWhile conceptually useful for determining human subjects\nparticipation, the distinction between tool and venue or engaged\nversus non-intrusive web-based research is increasingly blurring in\nthe face of social media and their third-party applications. Buchanan\n(2016) has conceptualized three phases or stages of Internet research,\nand the emergence of social media characterize the second phase, circa\n2006–2014. The concept of social media entails \nA group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological\nand technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation\nand exchange of user-generated content (Kaplan & Haenlein 2010:\n61). \nA “social network site” is a category of websites with\nprofiles, semi-persistent public commentary on the profile, and a\ntraversable publicly articulated social network displayed in relation\nto the profile. \nThis collapse of tool and venue can be traced primarily to the\nincreasing use of third-party sites and applications such as Facebook,\nTwitter, or any of the myriad online research tools where subject or\nparticipant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and data\ndissemination can all occur in the same space. With these collapsing\nboundaries, the terms of “inter-jurisdictional\ncoordination” (Gilbert 2009: 3) are inherently challenging;\nGilbert has specifically argued against the terms of use or end-user\nlicense agreement stipulations in virtual worlds, noting that such\nagreements are often “flawed”, as they rely on laws and\nregulations from a specific locale and attempt to enforce them in a\nnon place-based environment. Nonetheless, researchers now make\nfrequent use of data aggregation tools, scraping data from user\nprofiles or transaction logs, harvesting data from Twitter streams, or\nstoring data on cloud servers such as Dropbox only after agreeing to\nthe terms of service that go along with those sites. The use of such\nthird party applications or tools changes fundamental aspects of\nresearch, oftentimes displacing the researcher or research team as the\nsole owner of their data. These unique characteristics implicate\nconcepts and practicalities of privacy, consent, ownership, and\njurisdictional boundaries. \nA key moment that typified and called attention to many of these\nconcerns emerged with the 2014 Facebook Emotional Contagion study\n(Booth, 2014). By virtue of agreeing to Facebook’s Terms of\nService, did users consent to participation in research activities?\nShould there have been a debriefing after the experiment? How\nthoroughly did a university research ethics board review the study?\nShould industry-sponsored research undergo internal ethics review? In\nresponse to the outcry of the Contagion study, Ok Cupid’s\nChristian Rudder (2014\n [OIR])\n defended these sorts of experiments, noting \nWe noticed recently that people didn’t like it when Facebook\n“experimented” with their news feed. Even the FTC is\ngetting involved. But guess what, everybody: if you use the Internet,\nyou’re the subject of hundreds of experiments at any given time,\non every site. That’s how websites work. \nThe phenomenon of the social web forces an ongoing negotiation between\nresearchers and their data sources, as seen in the Facebook contagion\nstudy and the subsequent reaction to it. Moreover, with the growing\nuse and concentration of mobile devices, the notion of Internet\nresearch is expanding with a movement away from a\n“place-based” Internet to a dispersed reality. Data\ncollection from mobile devices has increased exponentially. For\nexample, mobile devices enable the use of synchronous data collection\nand dissemination from non-place based environments. Researchers using\ncloud-enabled applications can send and receive data to and from\nparticipants synchronously. The impact of such research possibilities\nfor epidemiological research is staggering for its scientific\npotential while demanding for the concurrent ethical challenges, as we\nare seeing with mobile-based COVID-19 research (Drew et al., 2020) and\nthe sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in\nreal-time (Hubach et al., forthcoming). As Internet research has grown\nfrom a niche methodology into a nearly ubiquitous and often invisible\npractice, the traditional concepts of human subjects research require\ncareful consideration. \nThe practical, professional, and theoretical implications of human\nsubjects protections has been covered extensively in scholarly\nliterature, ranging from medical/biomedical to social sciences to\ncomputing and technical disciplines (see Beauchamp & Childress\n2008; Emanual et al. 2003; PRIM&R et al. 2021; Sieber 1992; Wright\n2006). Relevant protections and regulations continue to receive much\nattention in the face of research ethics violations (see, for example,\nSkloot 2010, on Henrietta Lacks; the U.S. Government’s admission\nand apology to the Guatemalan Government for STD testing in the 1940s\n(BBC 2011); and Gaw & Burns 2011, on how lessons from the past\nmight inform current research ethics and conduct). \nThe history of human subjects protections (Sparks 2002 [see\n Other Internet Resources aka OIR])\n grew out of atrocities such as Nazi human experimentation during\nWorld War II, which resulted in the Nuremberg Code (1947);\nsubsequently followed by the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical\nPrinciples for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects (World\nMedical Association 1964/2008). Partially in response to the Tuskegee\nsyphilis experiment, an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932\nand 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service studying the natural\nprogression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in\nAlabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the\ngovernment, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services put forth\na set of basic regulations governing the protection of human subjects\n(45 C.F.R. § 46) (see the links in the Other Internet Resources\nsection, under Laws and Government Documents). This was\nlater followed by the publication of the “Ethical\nPrinciples and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of\nResearch” by the National Commission for the Protection of Human\nSubjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, known as the Belmont\nReport (NCPHSBBR 1979). The Belmont Report identifies three\nfundamental ethical principles for all human subjects research:\nRespect for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice. \nTo ensure consistency across federal agencies in the United States\ncontext in human subjects protections, in 1991, the Federal Policy for\nthe Protection of Human Subjects, also known as the “Common\nRule” was codified; the Revised Common Rule was released in the\nFederal Register on 19 January 2017, and went into effect 19 July\n2018. Similar regulatory frameworks for the protection of human\nsubjects exist across the world, and include, for example, the\nCanadian Tri-Council, the Australian Research Council, The European\nCommission, The Research Council of Norway and its National Committee\nfor Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and Humanities (NESH 2006;\nNESH 2019), and the U.K.’s NHS National Research Ethics Service\nand the Research Ethics Framework (REF) of the ESRC (Economic and\nSocial Research Council) General Guidelines, and the Forum for Ethical\nReview Committees in Asia and the Western Pacific (FERCAP). \nIn the United States, the various regulatory agencies who have signed\non to the Common Rule (45 C.F.R. 46 Subpart A) have not issued formal\nguidance on Internet research (see the links in the Other Internet\nResources section, under Laws and Government Documents). The\nPreamble to the Revised Rule referenced significant changes in the\nresearch environment, recognizing a need to broaden the scope of the\nRule. However, substantial changes to the actual Rule in regards to\nInternet research in its broadest context, were minimal. \nFor example, the Preamble states: \nThis final rule recognizes that in the past two decades a paradigm\nshift has occurred in how research is conducted. Evolving\ntechnologies—including imaging, mobile technologies, and the\ngrowth in computing power—have changed the scale and nature of\ninformation collected in many disciplines. Computer scientists,\nengineers, and social scientists are developing techniques to\nintegrate different types of data so they can be combined, mined,\nanalyzed, and shared. The advent of sophisticated computer software\nprograms, the Internet, and mobile technology has created new areas of\nresearch activity, particularly within the social and behavioral\nsciences (Federal Register 2017 and HHS 2017). \nModest changes to the definition of human subjects included changing\n“data” to “information” and\n“biospecimens;” the definition now reads: \nHowever, the Revised Rule does have a provision that stands to be of\nimport in regards to Internet research; the Rule calls for\nimplementing departments or agencies to, \nAs of this writing, there has not yet been a reexamination of the\nconcepts of “identifiable private information” or\n“identifiable biospecimens”. However, as data analytics,\nAI, and machine learning continue to expose ethical issues in human\nsubjects research, we expect to see engaged discussion at the federal\nlevel and amongst research communities (PRIM&R 2021). Those\ndiscussions may refer to previous conceptual work by Carpenter and\nDittrich (2012) and Aycock et al. (2012) that is concerned with risk\nand identifiability. Secondary uses of identifiable, private data, for\nexample, may pose downstream harms, or unintentional risks, causing\nreputational or informational harms. Reexaminations of\n“identifiable private information” can not occur without\nserious consideration of risk and “human harming\nresearch”. Carpenter and Dittrich (2012) encourage \n“Review boards should transition from an informed consent driven\nreview to a risk analysis review that addresses potential harms\nstemming from research in which a researcher does not directly\ninteract with the at-risk individuals” (p. 4) as “[T]his\ndistance between researcher and affected individual indicates that a\nparadigm shift is necessary in the research arena. We must transition\nour idea of research protection from ‘human subjects\nresearch’ to ‘human harming research’” (p.\n 14).[1] \nSimilarly, Aycock et al. (2012) assert that \nResearchers and boards must balance presenting risks related to the\nspecific research with risks related to the technologies in use. With\ncomputer security research, major issues around risk arise, for\nsociety at large especially. The risk may not seem evident to an\nindividual but in the scope of security research, larger populations\nmay be vulnerable. There is a significant difficulty in quantifying\nrisks and benefits, in the traditional sense of research\nethics….An aggregation of surfing behaviors collected by a bot\npresents greater distance between researcher and respondent than an\ninterview done in a virtual world between avatars. This distance leads\nus to suggest that computer security research focus less concern\naround human subjects research in the traditional sense and\nmore concern with human harming research (p. 3, italics\noriginal). \nThese two conceptual notions are relevant for considering emergent\nforms of identities or personally identifiable information (PII) such\nas avatars, virtual beings, bots, textual and graphical information.\nWithin the Code of Federal Regulations (45 C.F.R. § 46.102(f)\n2009): New forms of representations are considered human subjects if\nPII about living individuals is obtained. PII can be obtained by\nresearchers through scraping data sources, profiles or avatars, or\nother pieces of data made available by the platform. Fairfield agrees:\n“An avatar, for example, does not merely represent a collection\nof pixels—it represents the identity of the user” (2012:\n701). \nThe multiple academic disciplines already long engaged in human\nsubjects research (medicine, sociology, anthropology, psychology,\ncommunication) have established ethical guidelines intended to assist\nresearchers and those charged with ensuring that research on human\nsubjects follows both legal requirements and ethical practices. But\nwith research involving the Internet—where individuals\nincreasingly share personal information on platforms with porous and\nshifting boundaries, where both the spread and aggregation of data\nfrom disparate sources has become the norm, and where web-based\nservices, and their privacy policies and terms of service statements,\nmorph and evolve rapidly—the ethical frameworks and assumptions\ntraditionally used by researchers and REBs are frequently\nchallenged. \nResearch ethics boards themselves are increasingly challenged with the\nunique ethical dimensions of internet-based research protocols. In a\n2008 survey of U.S. IRBs, less than half of the ethical review boards\nidentified internet-based research was “an area of concern or\nimportance” at that time, and only 6% had guidelines or\nchecklists in place for reviewing internet-based research protocols\n(Buchanan & Ess 2009). By 2015, 93% of IRBs surveyed acknowledged\nthat are ethical issues unique to research using “online\ndata”, yet only 55% said they felt their IRBs are well versed in\nthe technical aspects of online data collection, and only 57% agreed\nthat their IRB has the expertise to stay abreast of changes in online\ntechnology. IRBs are now further challenged with the growth of big\ndata research (see\n §4.5 below),\n which increasingly relies on large datasets of personal information\ngenerated via social media, digital devices, or other means often\nhidden from users. A 2019 study of IRBs revealed only 25% felt\nprepared to evaluate protocols relying on big data, and only 6% had\ntools sufficient for considering this emerging area of internet\nresearch (Zimmer & Chapman 2020). Further, after being presented\nvarious hypothetical research scenarios utilizing big data and asked\nhow their IRB would likely review such a protocol, numerous viewpoints\ndifferent strongly in many cases. Consider the following scenario: \nResearchers plan to scrape public comments from online newspaper pages\nto predict election outcomes. They will aggregate their analysis to\ndetermine public sentiment. The researchers don’t plan to inform\ncommenters, and they plan to collect potentially-identifiable user\nnames. Scraping comments violates the newspaper’s terms of\nservice. \n18% of respondents indicated their IRB would view this as exempt, 21%\nindicated expedited review, 33% suggested it would need full board\nreview, while 28% did not think this was even human subjects research\nthat would fall under their IRB’s purview (Zimmer & Chapman\n2020). This points to potential gaps and inconsistencies in how IRBs\nreview the ethical implications of big data research protocols. \nAn extensive body of literature has developed since the 1990s around\nthe use of the Internet for research (S. Jones 1999; Hunsinger,\nKlastrup, & Allen (eds.) 2010; Consalvo & Ess (eds.) 2011;\nZimmer & Kinder-Kurlanda (eds.) 2017), with a growing emphasis on\nthe ethical dimensions of Internet research. \nA flurry of Internet research, and explicit concern for the ethical\nissues concurrently at play in it, began in the mid-1990s. In 1996,\nStorm King recognized the growing use of the Internet as a venue for\nresearch. His work explored the American Psychological\nAssociation’s guidelines for human subjects research with\nemergent forms of email, chat, listservs, and virtual communities.\nWith careful attention to risk and benefit to Internet subjects, King\noffered a cautionary note: \nWhen a field of study is new, the fine points of ethical\nconsiderations involved are undefined. As the field matures and\nresults are compiled, researchers often review earlier studies and\nbecome concerned because of the apparent disregard for the human\nsubjects involved (1996: 119). \nThe 1996 issue of Information Society dedicated to Internet\nresearch is considered a watershed moment, and included much seminal\nresearch still of impact and relevance today (Allen 1996;\nBoehlefeld 1996; Reid 1996). \nSherry Turkle’s 1997 Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age\nof the Internet called direct attention to the human element of\nonline game environments. Moving squarely towards person-based versus\ntext-based research, Turkle pushed researchers to consider human\nsubjects implications of Internet research. Similarly, Markham’s\nLife Online: Researching Real Experience in Virtual Space\n(1998) highlighted the methodological complexities of online\nethnographic studies, as did Jacobson’s 1999 methodological\ntreatment of Internet research. The “field” of study\nchanged the dynamics of researcher-researched roles, identity, and\nrepresentation of participants from virtual spaces. Markham’s\nwork in qualitative online research has been influential across\ndisciplines, as research in nursing, psychology, and medicine has\nfound the potential of this paradigm for online research (Flicker et\nal. 2004; Eysenbach & Till 2001; Seaboldt & Kupier 1997; Sharf\n1997). \nThen, in 1999, the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS), with a contract from the U.S. Office for Protection from\nResearch Risks (now known as the Office for Human Research\nProtections), convened a workshop, with the goal of assessing the\nalignment of traditional research ethics concepts to Internet\nresearch. The workshop acknowledged \nThe vast amount of social and behavioral information potentially\navailable on the Internet has made it a prime target for researchers\nwishing to study the dynamics of human interactions and their\nconsequences in this virtual medium. Researchers can potentially\ncollect data from widely dispersed population sat relatively low cost\nand in less time than similar efforts in the physical world. As a\nresult, there has been an increase in the number of Internet studies,\nranging from surveys to naturalistic observation (Frankel & Siang\n1999: 1). \nIn the medical/biomedical contexts, Internet research has grown\nrapidly. Also in 1999, Gunther Eysenbach wrote the first editorial to\nthe newly formed Journal of Medical Internet Research. There\nwere three driving forces behind the inception of this journal, and\nEysenbach called attention to the growing social and interpersonal\naspects of the Internet: \nFirst, Internet protocols are used for clinical information and\ncommunication. In the future, Internet technology will be the platform\nfor many telemedical applications. Second, the Internet revolutionizes\nthe gathering, access and dissemination of non-clinical information in\nmedicine: Bibliographic and factual databases are now world-wide\naccessible via graphical user interfaces, epidemiological and public\nhealth information can be gathered using the Internet, and\nincreasingly the Internet is used for interactive medical education\napplications. Third, the Internet plays an important role for consumer\nhealth education, health promotion and teleprevention. (As an aside,\nit should be emphasized that “health education” on the\nInternet goes beyond the traditional model of health education, where\na medical professional teaches the patient: On the Internet, much\n“health education” is done\n“consumer-to-consumer” by means of patient self support\ngroups organizing in cyberspace. These patient-to-patient interchanges\nare becoming an important part of healthcare and are redefining the\ntraditional model of preventive medicine and health promotion). \nWith scholarly attention growing and with the 1999 AAAS report\n(Frankel & Siang 1999) calling for action, other professional\nassociations took notice and began drafting statements or guidelines,\nor addendum to their extant professional standards. For example, The\nBoard of Scientific Affairs (BSA) of the American Psychological\nAssociation established an Advisory Group on Conducting Research on\nthe Internet in 2001; the American Counseling Association’s 2005\nrevision to its Code of Ethics; the Association of Internet\nResearchers (AoIR) Ethics Working Group Guidelines, the National\nCommittee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the\nHumanities (NESH Norway), among others, have directed researchers and\nreview boards to the ethics of Internet research, with attention to\nthe most common areas of ethical concern (see\n OIR\n for links). \nWhile many researchers focus on traditional research ethics\nprinciples, conceptualizations of Internet research ethics depend on\ndisciplinary perspectives. Some disciplines, notably from the arts and\nhumanities, posit that Internet research is more about context and\nrepresentation than about “human subjects”, suggesting\nthere is no intent, and thus minimal or no harm, to engage in research\nabout actual persons. The debate has continued since the early 2000s.\nWhite (2002) argued against extant regulations that favored or\nprivileged specific ideological, disciplinary and cultural\nprerogatives, which limit the freedoms and creativity of arts and\nhumanities research. For example, she notes that the AAAS report\n“confuses physical individuals with constructed materials and\nhuman subjects with composite cultural works”, again calling\nattention to the person versus text divide that has permeated Internet\nresearch ethics debates. Another example of disciplinary differences\ncomes from the Oral History Association, which acknowledged the\ngrowing use of the Internet as a site for research: \nSimply put, oral history collects memories and personal commentaries\nof historical significance through recorded interviews. An oral\nhistory interview generally consists of a well-prepared interviewer\nquestioning an interviewee and recording their exchange in audio or\nvideo format. Recordings of the interview are transcribed, summarized,\nor indexed and then placed in a library or archives. These interviews\nmay be used for research or excerpted in a publication, radio or video\ndocumentary, museum exhibition, dramatization or other form of public\npresentation. Recordings, transcripts, catalogs, photographs and\nrelated documentary materials can also be posted on the Internet\n(Ritchie 2003: 19). \nWhile the American Historical Association (A. Jones 2008) has argued\nthat such research be “explicitly exempted” from ethical\nreview board oversight, the use of the Internet could complicate such\na stance if such data became available in public settings or available\n“downstream” with potential, unforeseeable risks to\nreputation, economic standing, or psychological harm, should\nidentification occur. \nUnder the concept of text rather than human subjects, Internet\nresearch rests on arguments of publication and copyright; consider the\nvenue of a blog, which does not meet the definition of human subject\nas in 45 C.F.R. § 46.102f (2009), as interpreted by most ethical\nreview boards. A researcher need not obtain consent to use text from a\nblog, as it is generally considered publicly available, textual,\npublished material. This argument of the “public park”\nanalogy that has been generally accepted by researchers is appropriate\nfor some Internet venues and tools, but not all: Context, intent,\nsensitivity of data, and expectations of Internet participants were\nidentified in 2004 by Sveninngsson as crucial markers in Internet\nresearch ethics considerations. \nBy the mid-2000s, with three major anthologies published, and a\ngrowing literature base, there was ample scholarly literature\ndocumenting IRE across disciplines and methodologies, and\nsubsequently, there was anecdotal data emerging from the review boards\nevaluating such research. In search of empirical data regarding the\nactual review board processes of Internet research from a human\nsubjects perspective, Buchanan and Ess surveyed over 700 United States\nethics review boards, and found that boards were primarily concerned\nwith privacy, data security and confidentiality, and ensuring\nappropriate informed consent and recruitment procedures (Buchanan\n& Ess 2009; Buchanan & Hvizdak 2009). \nIn 2008, the Canadian Tri-Council’s Social Sciences and\nHumanities Research Ethics Special Working Committee: A Working\nCommittee of the Interagency Advisory Panel on Research Ethics was\nconvened (Blackstone et al. 2008); and in 2010, a meeting at the\nSecretary’s Advisory Committee to the Office for Human Research\nProtections highlighted Internet research (SACHRP 2010). Such\nprominent professional organizations as the Public Responsibility in\nMedicine and Research (PRIM&R) and the American Educational\nResearch Association (AERA) have begun featuring Internet research\nethics regularly at their conferences and related publications. \nRecently, disciplines not traditionally involved in human subjects\nresearch have begun their own explorations of IRE. For example,\nresearchers in computer security have actively examined the tenets of\nresearch ethics in CS and ICT (Aycock et al. 2012; Dittrich, Bailey,\n& Dietrich 2011; Carpenter & Dittrich 2012; Buchanan et al.\n2011). Notably, the U.S. Federal Register requested comments on\n“The Menlo Report” in December 2011, which calls for a\ncommitment by computer science researchers to the three principles of\nrespect for persons, beneficence, and justice, while also adding a\nfourth principle on respect for law and public interest (Homeland\nSecurity 2011). SIGCHI, an international society for professionals,\nacademics, and students interested in human-technology and\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI), has increasingly focused on how IRE\napplies to work in their domain (Frauenberger et al. 2017; Fiesler et\nal. 2018). \nPrinciples of research ethics dictate that researchers must ensure\nthere are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and\nto maintain the confidentiality of any data collected. A violation of\nprivacy or breach of confidentiality presents a risk of serious harm\nto participants, ranging from the exposure of personal or sensitive\ninformation, the divulgence of embarrassing or illegal conduct, or the\nrelease of data otherwise protected under law. \nResearch ethics concerns around individual privacy is often expressed\nin terms of the level of linkability of data to individuals, and the\npotential harms from disclosure of information As Internet research\nhas grown in complexity and computational sophistication, ethics\nconcerns have focused on current and future uses of data, and the\npotential downstream harms that could occur. Protecting research\nparticipants’ privacy and confidentiality is typically achieved\nthrough a combination of research tactics and practices, including\nengaging in data collection under controlled or anonymous\nenvironments, the scrubbing of data to remove personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), or the use of access restrictions and related data\nsecurity methods. And, the specificity and characteristics of the data\nwill often dictate if there are regulatory considerations, in addition\nto the methodological considerations around privacy and\nconfidentiality. For example, personally identifiable information\n(PII) typically demands the most stringent protections. The National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), for example, defines PII as: \nany information about an individual maintained by an agency,\nincluding, but not limited to, education, financial transactions,\nmedical history, and criminal or employment history and information\nwhich can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s\nidentity, such as their name, SSN, date and place of birth,\nmother’s maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any\nother personal information that is linked or linkable to an individual\n(NIH 2010). \nTypically, examples of identifying pieces of information have included\npersonal characteristics (such as date of birth, place of birth,\nmother’s maiden name, gender, sexual orientation, and other\ndistinguishing features and biometrics information, such as height,\nweight, physical appearance, fingerprints, DNA and retinal scans),\nunique numbers or identifiers assigned to an individual (such as a\nname, address, phone number, social security number, driver’s\nlicense number, financial account numbers), and descriptions of\nphysical location (GIS/GPS log data, electronic bracelet monitoring\ninformation). \nThe 2018 EU General Data Protection Regulation lays out the legal and\nregulatory requirements for data use across the EU. Mondschein &\nMonda (2018) provides a thorough discussion on the different types of\ndata that are considered in the GDPR: Personal data, such as names,\nidentification numbers, location data, and so on; Special categories\nof personal data, such as race or ethic origin, political opinions, or\nreligious beliefs; Pseudonymous data, referring to data that has been\naltered so the subject cannot be directly identified without having\nfurther information; Anonymous data, information which does not relate\nto an identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered\nanonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer\nidentifiable. They also advise researchers to consider \ndata protection issues at an early stage of a research project is of\ngreat importance specifically in the context of large-scale research\nendeavours that make use of personal data (2018: 56). \nInternet research introduces new complications to these longstanding\ndefinitions and regulatory frameworks intended to protect subject\nprivacy. For example, researchers increasingly are able to collect\ndetailed data about individuals from sources such as Facebook,\nTwitter, blogs or public email archives, and these rich data sets can\nmore easily be processed, compared, and combined with other data (and\ndatasets) available online. In numerous cases, both researchers and\nmembers of the general public have been able to re-identify\nindividuals by analyzing and comparing such datasets, using\ndata-fields as benign as one’s zip code (Sweeny 2002), random\nWeb search queries (Barbaro & Zeller 2006), or movie ratings\n(Narayanan & Shmatikov 2008) as the vital key for reidentification\nof a presumed anonymous user. Prior to widespread Internet-based data\ncollection and processing, few would have considered one’s movie\nratings or zipcode as personally-identifiable. Yet, these cases reveal\nthat merely stripping traditional “identifiable”\ninformation such as a subject’s name, address, or social\nsecurity number is no longer sufficient to ensure data remains\nanonymous (Ohm 2010), and requires the reconsideration of what is\nconsidered “personally identifiable information” (Schwartz\n& Solove 2011). This points to the critical distinction between\ndata that is kept confidential versus data that is truly anonymous.\nIncreasingly, data are rarely completely anonymous, as researchers\nhave routinely demonstrated they can often reidentify individuals\nhidden in “anonymized” datasets with ease (Ohm 2010). This\nreality places new pressure on ensuring datasets are kept, at the\nleast, suitably confidential through both physical and computational\nsecurity measures. These measures may also include requirements to\nstore data in “clean rooms”, or in non-networked\nenvironments in an effort to control data transmission. \nSimilarly, new types of data often collected in Internet research\nmight also be used to identify a subject within a previously-assumed\nanonymous dataset. For example, Internet researchers might collect\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses when conducting online surveys or\nanalyzing transaction logs. An IP address is a unique identifier that\nis assigned to every device connected to the Internet; in most cases,\nindividual computers are assigned a unique IP address, while in some\ncases the address is assigned to a larger node or Internet gateway for\na collection of computers. Nearly all websites and Internet service\nproviders store activity logs that link activity with IP addresses, in\nmany cases, eventually to specific computers or users. Current U.S.\nlaw does not hold IP addresses to be personally identifiable\ninformation, while other countries and regulatory bodies do. For\nexample, the European Data Privacy Act at Article 29, holds that IP\naddresses do constitute PII. Buchanan et al. (2011), note, however,\nthat under the U.S. Civil Rights Act, for the purposes of the HIPAA\n Act,[2]\n IP addresses are considered a form of PII (45 C.F.R. § 164.514\n 2002).[3]\n There could potentially be a reconsideration by other federal\nregulatory agencies over IP addresses as PII, and researchers and\nboards will need to be attentive should such change occur. \nA similar complication emerges when we consider the meaning of\n“private information” within the context of Internet-based\nresearch. U.S. federal regulations define “private\ninformation” as: \n[A]ny information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an\nindividual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is\ntaking place, and information that has been provided for specific\npurposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably\nexpect will not be made public (for example, a medical record) (45\nC.F.R. § 46.102(f) 2009). \nThis standard definition of “private information” has two\nkey components. First, private information is that which subjects\nreasonably expect is not normally monitored or collected. Second,\nprivate information is that which subjects reasonably expect is not\ntypically publicly available. Conversely, the definition also suggests\nthe opposite is true: if users cannot reasonably expect data\nisn’t being observed or recorded, or they cannot expect data\nisn’t publicly available, then the data does not rise to the\nlevel of “private information” requiring particular\nprivacy protections. Researchers and REBs have routinely worked with\nthis definition of “private information” to ensure the\nprotection of individuals’ privacy. \nThese distinctions take on greater weight, however, when considering\nthe data environments and collection practices common with\nInternet-based research. Researchers interested in collecting or\nanalyzing online actions of subjects—perhaps through the mining\nof online server logs, the use of tracking cookies, or the scraping of\nsocial media profiles and feeds—could argue that subjects do not\nhave a reasonable expectation that such online activities are not\nroutinely monitored since nearly all online transactions and\ninteractions are routinely logged by websites and service providers.\nThus, online data trails might not rise to the level of “private\ninformation”. However, numerous studies have indicated that\naverage Internet users have incomplete understandings of how their\nactivities are routinely tracked, and the related privacy practices\nand policies of the sites they visit (Hoofnagle & King 2008\n [OIR];\n Milne & Culnan 2004; Tsai et al. 2006). Hudson and Bruckman\n(2005) conducted empirical research on users’ expectations and\nunderstandings of privacy, finding that participants’\nexpectations of privacy within public chatrooms conflicted with what\nwas actually a very public online space. Rosenberg (2010) examined the\npublic/private distinction in the realm of virtual worlds, suggesting\nresearchers must determine what kind of social norms and relations\npredominate an online space before making assumptions about the\n“publicness” of information shared within. Thus, it\nremains unclear whether Internet users truly understand if and when\ntheir online activity is regularly monitored and tracked, and what\nkind of reasonable expectations truly exist. This ambiguity creates\nnew challenges for researchers and REBs when trying to apply the\ndefinition of “private information” to ensure subject\nprivacy is properly addressed (Zimmer 2010). \nThis complexity in addressing subject privacy in Internet research is\nfurther compounded with the rise of social networking as a place for\nthe sharing of information, and a site for research. Users\nincreasingly share more and more personal information on platforms\nlike Facebook or Twitter. For researchers, social media platforms\nprovide a rich resource for study, and much of the content is\navailable to be viewed and downloaded with minimal effort. Since much\nof the information posted to social media sites is publicly viewable,\nit thus fails to meet the standard regulatory definition of\n“private information”. Therefore, researchers attempting\nto collect and analyze social media postings might not treat the data\nas requiring any particular privacy considerations. Yet, social media\nplatforms represent a complex environment of social interaction where\nusers are often required to place friends, lovers, colleagues, and\nminor acquaintances within the same singular category of\n“friends”, where privacy policies and terms of service are\nnot fully understood (Madejski et al. 2011), and where the technical\ninfrastructures fail to truly support privacy projections (Bonneau\n& Preibush 2010) and regularly change with little notice (Stone\n2009\n [OIR];\n Zimmer 2009\n [OIR]).\n As a result, it is difficult to understand with any certainty what a\nuser’s intention was when posting an item onto a social media\nplatform (Acquisti & Gross 2006). The user may have intended the\npost for a private group but failed to completely understand how to\nadjust the privacy settings accordingly. Or, the information might\nhave previously been restricted to only certain friends, but a change\nin the technical platform suddenly made the data more visible to\nall. \nOhm (2010) warns that \nthe utility and privacy of data are linked, and so long as data is\nuseful, even in the slightest, then it is also potentially\nreidentifiable (2010: 1751). \nWith the rapid growth of Internet-based research, Ohm’s concern\nbecomes even more dire. The traditional definitions and approaches to\nunderstanding the nature of privacy, anonymity, and precisely what\nkind of information deserves protection becomes strained, forcing\nresearchers and REBs to consider more nuanced theories of privacy\n(Nissenbaum 2009) and approaches to respecting and projecting subject\nprivacy (Markham 2012; Zimmer 2010). \nDepending on the type of Internet research being carried out,\nrecruitment of participants may be done in a number of ways. As with\nany form of research, the study population or participants are\nselected for specific purposes (i.e., an ethnographic study of a\nparticular group on online game players), or, can be selected from a\nrange of sampling techniques (i.e., a convenience sample gleaned from\nthe users of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing\n platform[4]).\n In the U.S. context, a recruitment plan is considered part of the\ninformed consent process, and as such, any recruitment script or\nposting must be reviewed and approved by an REB prior to posting or\nbeginning solicitation (if the project is human subjects research).\nFurther, the selection of participants must be impartial and unbiased,\nand any risks and benefits must be justly distributed. This concept is\nchallenging to apply in Internet contexts, in which populations are\noften self-selected and can be exclusive, depending on membership and\naccess status, as well as the common disparities of online access\nbased on economic and social variables. Researchers also face\nrecruitment challenges due to online subjects’ potential\nanonymity, especially as it relates to the frequent use of pseudonyms\nonline, having multiple or alternative identities online, and the\ngeneral challenges of verifying a subject’s age and demographic\ninformation. Moreover, basic ethical principles for approaching and\nrecruiting participants involve protecting their privacy and\nconfidentiality. Internet research can both maximize these\nprotections, as an individual may never be known beyond a screen name\nor avatar existence; or, conversely, the use of IP addresses,\nplacement of cookies, availability and access to more information than\nnecessary for the research purposes, may minimize the protections of\nprivacy and confidentiality. \nMuch recruitment is taking place via social media; examples include\npush technologies, a synchronous approach in which a text or tweet is\nsent from a researcher to potential participants based on profile\ndata, platform activity, or geolocation. Other methods of pull\ntechnologies recruitment include direct email, dedicated web pages,\nYouTube videos, direct solicitation via “stickies” posted\non fora or web sites directing participants to a study site, or data\naggregation or scraping data for potential recruitment. Regardless of\nthe means used, researchers must follow the terms of the\nsite—from the specific norms and nuances governing a site or\nlocale to the legal issues in terms of service agreements. For\nexample, early pro-anorexia web sites (see Overbeke 2008) were often\ntreated as sensitive spaces deserving spcicial consideration, and\nresearchers were asked to respect the privacy of the participants and\nnot engage in research (Walstrom 2004). In the gaming context,\nReynolds and de Zwart (2010) ask: \nHas the researcher disclosed the fact that he or she is engaged in\nresearch and is observing/interacting with other players for the\npurposes of gathering research data? How does the research project\nimpact upon the community and general game play? Is the research\nproject permitted under the Terms of Service? \nColvin and Lanigan (2005: 38) suggest researchers \nSeek permission from Web site owners and group moderators before\nposting recruitment announcements, Then, preface the recruitment\nannouncement with a statement that delineates the permission that has\nbeen granted, including the contact person and date received. Identify\na concluding date (deadline) for the research study and make every\neffort to remove recruitment postings, which often become embedded\nwithin Web site postings. \nBarratt and Lenton, among others, agree: \nIt is critical, therefore, to form partnerships with online community\nmoderators by not only asking their permission to post the request,\nbut eliciting their feedback and support as well (2010: 71). \nMendelson (2007) and Smith and Leigh (1997) note that recruitment\nnotices need to contain more information than the typical flyers or\nadvertisements used for newspaper advertisements. Mentioning the\napproval of moderators is important for establishing authenticity, and\nso is providing detailed information about the study and how to\ncontact both the researchers and the appropriate research ethics\nboard. \nGiven the array of techniques possible for recruitment, the concept of\n“research spam” requires attention. The Council of\nAmerican Survey Research warns \nResearch Organizations should take steps to limit the number of survey\ninvitations sent to targeted respondents by email solicitations or\nother methods over the Internet so as to avoid harassment and response\nbias caused by the repeated recruitment and participation by a given\npool (or panel) of data subjects (CASRO 2011: I.B.3). \nUltimately, researchers using Internet recruitment measures must\nensure that potential participants are getting enough information in\nboth the recruitment materials and any subsequent consent documents.\nResearchers must ensure that recruitment methods do not lead to an\nindividual being identified without their permission, and if such\nidentification is possible, are there significant risks involved? \nAs the cornerstone of human subjects protections, informed consent\nmeans that participants are voluntarily participating in the research\nwith adequate knowledge of relevant risks and benefits. Providing\ninformed consent typically includes the researcher explaining the\npurpose of the research, the methods being used, the possible outcomes\nof the research, as well as associated risks or harms that the\nparticipants might face. The process involves providing the recipient\nclear and understandable explanations of these issues in a concise\nway, providing sufficient opportunity to consider them and enquire\nabout any aspect of the research prior to granting consent, and\nensuring the subject has not been coerced into participating. Gaining\nconsent in traditional research is typically done verbally or in\nwriting, either in a face-to-face meeting where the researcher reviews\nthe document, through telephone scripts, through mailed documents,\nfax, or video, and can be obtained with the assistance of an advocate\nin the case of vulnerable populations. Most importantly, informed\nconsent was built on the ideal of “process” and the\nverification of understanding, and thus, requires an ongoing\ncommunicative relationship between and among researchers and their\nparticipants. The emergence of the Internet as both a tool and a venue\nfor research has introduced challenges to this traditional approach to\ninformed consent. \nIn most regulatory frameworks, there are instances when informed\nconsent might be waived, or the standard processes of obtaining\ninformed consent might be modified, if approved by a research ethics\n board.[5]\n Various forms of Internet research require different approaches to\nthe consent process. Some standards have emerged, depending on venue\n(i.e., an online survey platform versus a private Facebook group).\nHowever, researchers are encouraged to consider waiver of consent\nand/or documentation, if appropriate, by using the flexibilities of\ntheir extant regulations. \nWhere consent is required but documentation has been waived by an\nethical review board, a “portal” can be used to provide\nconsent information. For example, a researcher may send an email to\nthe participant with a link a separate portal or site information page\nwhere information on the project is contained. The participant can\nread the documentation and click on an “I agree”\nsubmission. Rosser et al. (2010) recommend using a\n“chunked” consent document, whereby individuals can read\nspecific sections, agree, and then continue onwards to completion of\nthe consent form, until reaching the study site. \nIn addition to portals, researchers will often make use of consent\ncards or tokens; this alleviates concerns that unannounced researcher\npresence is unacceptable, or, that a researcher’s presence is\nintrusive to the natural flow and movement of a given locale. Hudson\nand Bruckman (2004, 2005) highlighted the unique challenges in gaining\nconsent in chat rooms, while Lawson (2004) offers an array of consent\npossibilities for synchronous computer-mediated communication. There\nare different practical challenges in the consent process in Internet\nresearch, given the fluidity and temporal nature of Internet\nspaces. \nIf documentation of consent is required, some researchers have\nutilized alternatives such as electronic signatures, which can range\nfrom a simple electronic check box to acknowledge acceptance of the\nterms to more robust means of validation using encrypted digital\nsignatures, although the validity of electronic signatures vary by\njurisdiction. \nRegardless of venue, informed consent documents are undergoing changes\nin the information provided to research participants. While the basic\nelements of consent remain intact, researchers must now acknowledge\nwith less certainty specific aspects of their data longevity, risks to\nprivacy, confidentiality and anonymity (see\n §4.1 Privacy, above),\n and access to or ownership of data. Research participants must\nunderstand that their terms of service or end user license agreement\nconsent is distinct from their consent to participate in research.\nAnd, researchers must address and inform participants/subjects about\npotential risk of data intrusion or misappropriation of data if\nsubsequently made public or available outside of the confines of the\noriginal research. Statements should be revised to reflect such\nrealities as cloud storage (see\n §4.4 below)\n and data sharing. \nFor example, Aycock et al. (2012: 141) describe a continuum of\nsecurity and access statements used in informed consent documents: \nThis use of encryption in the last statement may be necessary in\nresearch including sensitive data, such as medical, sexual, health,\nfinancial, and so on. Barratt and Lenton (2010), in their research on\nillicit drug use and online forum behaviors, also provide guidance\nabout use of secure transmission and encryption as part of the consent\nprocess. \nIn addition to informing participants about potential risks and employing technological protections, NIH-funded researchers whose work includes projects with identifiable, sensitive information will automatically be issued a Certificate of Confidentiality: \nCoCs protect the privacy of research subjects by prohibiting\ndisclosure of identifiable, sensitive research information to anyone\nnot connected to the research except when the subject consents or in a\nfew other specific situations (NIH 2017\n [OIR]). \nHowever, these do not protect against release of data outside of the\nU.S. Given the reality of Internet research itself, which inherently\nspans borders, new models may be in order to ensure confidentiality of\ndata and protections of data. Models of informed consent for\ntraditional international research are fundamentally challenging due\nto cultural specificity and norms (Annas 2009; Boga et al. 2011;\nKrogstad et al. 2010); with Internet research, where researchers may\nbe unaware of the specific location of an individual, consent takes on\nsignificantly higher demands. While current standards of practice show\nthat consent models stem from the jurisdiction of the researcher and\nsponsoring research institution, complications arise in the face of\nage verification, age of majority/consent, reporting of adverse\neffects or complaints with the research process, and authentication of\nidentity. Various jurisdictional laws around privacy are relevant for\nthe consent process; a useful tool is Forrester’s Data Privacy\nHeat Map, which relies on in-depth analyses of the data\nprivacy-related laws and cultures of countries around the world,\nhelping researchers design appropriate approaches to privacy and data\nprotection given the particular context (see\n OIR). \nIn addition, as more federal agencies and funding bodies across the\nglobe encourage making research data publicly-available (i.e., NSF,\nNIH, Wellcome Trust, Research Councils U.K.), the language used in\nconsent documents will change accordingly to represent this intended\nlongevity of data and opportunities for future, unanticipated use.\nGiven the ease with which Internet data can flow between and among\nInternet venues, changes in the overall accessibility of data might\noccur (early “private” newsgroup conversations were made\n“publicly searchable” when Google bought DejaNews), and\nreuse and access by others is increasingly possible with shared\ndatasets. Current data sharing mandates must be considered in the\nconsent process. Alignment between a data sharing policy and an\ninformed consent document is imperative. Both should include\nprovisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality,\nsecurity, and intellectual property. \nThere is general agreement in the U.S. that individual consent is not\nnecessary for researchers to use publicly available data, such as\npublic Twitter feeds. Recommendations were made by The National Human\nSubjects Protection Advisory Committee (NHRPAC) in 2002 regarding\npublicly available data sets (see\n OIR).\n Data use or data restriction agreements are commonly used and set the\nparameters of use for researchers. \nThe U.K. Data Archive\n (2011 [OIR])\n provides guidance on consent and data sharing: \nWhen research involves obtaining data from people, researchers are\nexpected to maintain high ethical standards such as those recommended\nby professional bodies, institutions and funding organisations, both\nduring research and when sharing data. Research data — even\nsensitive and confidential data — can be shared ethically and\nlegally if researchers pay attention, from the beginning of research,\nto three important aspects: \n\n• when gaining informed consent, include provision for data\nsharing \n\n• where needed, protect people’s identities by anonymising\ndata \n\n• consider controlling access to data These measures should be\nconsidered jointly. The same measures form part of good research\npractice and data management, even if data sharing is not envisioned.\nData collected from and about people may hold personal, sensitive or\nconfidential information. This does not mean that all data obtained by\nresearch with participants are personal or confidential. \nData sharing made public headlines in 2016 when a Danish researcher\nreleased a data set comprised of scraped data from nearly 70,000 users\nof the OkCupid online dating site. The data set was highly\nreidentifiable and included potentially sensitive information,\nincluding usernames, age, gender, geographic location, what kind of\nrelationship (or sex) they’re interested in, personality traits,\nand answers to thousands of profiling questions used by the site. The\nresearcher claimed the data were public and thus, such sharing and use\nwas unproblematic. Zimmer (2016) was among many privacy and ethics\nscholars who critiqued this stance. \nThe Danish researchers did not seek any form of consent or debriefing\non the collection and use of the data, nor did they have any ethics\noversight. Many researchers and ethics boards are, however, attempting\nto mitigate some of these ethical concerns by including blanket\nstatements in their consent processes, indicating such precautions for\nresearch participants. For example, \nI understand that online communications may be at greater risk for\nhacking, intrusions, and other violations. Despite these\npossibilities, I consent to participate. \nA more specific example comes from the Canadian context when\nresearchers propose to use specific online survey tools hosted in the\nUnited States; REBs commonly recommend the following type language for\nuse in informed consent documents: \nPlease note that the online survey is hosted by Company ABC which is a\nweb survey company located in the U.S.A. All responses to the survey\nwill be stored and accessed in the U.S.A. This company is subject to\nU.S. Laws, in particular, to the U.S. Patriot Act/Domestic Security\nEnhancement Act that allows authorities access to the records that\nyour responses to the questions will be stored and accessed in the\nU.S.A. The security and private policy for Company ABC can be viewed\nat\n http://…/.[6] \nResearchers are also encouraged to review the Terms of Use and Terms\nof Service of the application that are being used, demonstrating its\ndetails to the REB in the application and informing participants of\nsuch details in the informed consent form or script. Researchers are\nalso encouraged to consider broader contextual factors of the data\nsource and research goals when weighing the possible violation of a\nplatform’s Terms of Service (Fiesler, Beard, & Keegan\n2020). \nInternet research poses particular challenges to age verification,\nassent and consent procedures, and appropriate methodological\napproaches with minors. Age of consent varies across countries,\nstates, communities, and locales of all sorts. For research conducted\nor supported by U.S. federal agencies bound by the Common Rule,\nchildren are \npersons who have not attained the legal age for consent [18, in the\nU.S.] to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the\napplicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be\nconducted (45 C.F.R. § 46.402(a) 2009). \nGoldfarb (2008) provides an exhaustive discussion of age of majority\nacross the U.S. states, with a special focus on clinical\nresearch, noting children must be seven or older to assent to\nparticipation (see 45 C.F.R. § 46 Subpart D 2009). \nSpriggs (2010), from the Australian context, notes that while no\nformal guidance exists on Internet research and minors under the\nNational Statement, she advises: \nTo assist with the consent process, age verification measures can be\nused. These can range from more technical software applications to\nless formal knowledge checks embedded in an information sheet or\nconsent document. Multiple confirmation points (asking for age, later\nasking for year of birth, etc.) are practical measures for\nresearchers. Depending on the types of data, sensitivity of data, use\nof data, researchers and boards will carefully construct the\nappropriate options for consent, including waiver of consent, waiver\nof documentation, and/or waiver of parental consent. \nRecent developments in cloud computing platforms have led to unique\nopportunities—and ethical challenges—for researchers.\nCloud computing describes the deployment of computing resources via\nthe Internet, providing on-demand, flexible, and scalable computing\nfrom remote locations. Examples include web-based email and\ncalendaring services provided by Google or Yahoo, online productivity\nplatforms like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365, online file\nstorage and sharing platforms like Dropbox or Box.net, and large-scale\napplication development and data processing platforms such as Google\nApps, Facebook Developers Platform, and Amazon Web Services. \nAlongside businesses and consumers, researchers have begun utilizing\ncloud computing platforms and services to assist in various tasks,\nincluding subject recruitment, data collection and storage,\nlarge-scale data processing, as well as communication and\ncollaboration (Allan 2011\n [OIR];\n X. Chen et al. 2010\n [OIR]);\n Simmhan et al. 2008; Simmhan et al. 2009). \nAs reliance on cloud computing increases among researchers, so do the\nethical implications. Among the greatest concerns is ensuring data\nprivacy and security with cloud-based services. For researchers\nsharing datasets online for collaborative processing and analysis,\nsteps must be taken to ensure only authorized personnel have access to\nthe online data that might contain PII, but also that suitable\nencryption is used for data transfer and storage, and that the cloud\nservice provider maintains sufficient security to prevent breaches.\nFurther, once research data is uploaded to a third-party cloud\nprovider, attention must be paid to the terms of service for the\ncontracted provider to determine what level of access to the data, if\nany, might be allowed to advertisers, law enforcement, or other\nexternal agents. \nAlongside the privacy and security concerns, researchers also have an\nethical duty of data stewardship which is further complicated when\nresearch data is placed in the cloud for storage or processing. Cloud\nproviders might utilize data centers spread across the globe, meaning\nresearch data might be located outside the United States, and its\nlegal jurisdictions. Terms of service might grant cloud providers a\nlicense to access and use research data for purposes not initially\nintended or approved of by the subjects involved. Stewardship may\nrequire the prompt and complete destruction of research data, a\nmeasure complicated if a cloud provider has distributed and backed-up\nthe data across multiple locations. \nA more unique application of cloud computing for research involves the\ncrowdsourcing of data analysis and processing functions, that is,\nleveraging the thousands of users of various online products and\nservices to complete research related tasks remotely. Examples include\nusing a distributed network of video game players to assist in solving\nprotein folding problems (Markoff 2010), and leveraging Amazon’s\nMechanical Turk crowdsourcing marketplace platform to assist with\nlarge scale data processing and coding functions that cannot be\nautomated (Conley & Tosti-Kharas 2014; J. Chen et al. 2011). Using\ncloud-based platforms can raise various critical ethical and\nmethodological issues. \nFirst, new concerns over data privacy and security emerge when\nresearch tasks are widely distributed across a global network of\nusers. Researchers must take great care in ensuring research data\ncontaining personal or sensitive information isn’t accessible by\noutsourced labor, or that none of the users providing crowdsourced\nlabor are able to aggregate and store their own copy of the research\ndataset. Second, crowdsourcing presents ethical concerns over trust\nand validity of the research process itself. Rather than a local team\nof research assistants usually under a principal investigator’s\nsupervision and control, crowdsourcing tends to be distributed beyond\nthe direct management or control of the researcher, providing less\nopportunity to ensure sufficient training for the required tasks.\nThus, researchers will need to create additional means of verifying\ndata results to confirm tasks are completed properly and\ncorrectly. \nTwo additional ethical concerns with crowdsourcing involve labor\nmanagement and authorship. Mechanical Turk users were not originally\nintended to be research subjects, first and foremost. However,\nresearchers using Mechanical Turks must ensure that the laborers on\nthe other end of the cloud-based relationship are not being exploited,\nthat they are legally eligible to be working for hire, and that the\nincentives provided are real, meaningful, and appropriate (Scholz\n2008; Williams 2010\n [OIR). \nFinally, at the end of a successful research project utilizing\ncrowdsourcing, a researcher may be confronted with the ethical\nchallenge of how to properly acknowledge the contributions made by\n(typically anonymous) laborers. Ethical research requires the fair and\naccurate description of authorship. Disciplines vary as to how to\nreport relative contributions made by collaborators and research\nassistants, and this dilemma increases when crowdsourcing is used to\nassist with the research project. \nAlgorithmic processing is a corollary of big data research, and\nnewfound ethical considerations have emerged. From “algorithmic\nharms” to “predictive analytics”, the power of\ntoday’s algorithms exceeds long-standing privacy beliefs and\nnorms. Specifically, the National Science and Technology Council\nnote: \nWhile the concept of big data is not new, and the term has been in\ntechnical discourses since the 1990s, public awareness and response to\nbig data research is much more recent. Following the rise of social\nmedia-based research, Buchanan (2016) has delineated the emergence of\n“big data”-based research from 2012 to the present, with\nno signs of an endpoint. \nBig data research is challenging for research ethics boards, often\npresenting what the computer ethicist James Moor would call\n“conceptual muddles”: the inability to properly\nconceptualize the ethical values and dilemmas at play in a new\ntechnological context. Subject privacy, for example, is typically\nprotected within the context of research ethics through a combination\nof various tactics and practices, including engaging in data\ncollection under controlled or anonymous environments, limiting the\npersonal information gathered, scrubbing data to remove or obscure\npersonally identifiable information, and using access restrictions and\nrelated data security methods to prevent unauthorized access and use\nof the research data itself. The nature and understanding of privacy\nbecome muddled, however, in the context of big data research, and as a\nresult, ensuring it is respected and protected in this new domain\nbecomes challenging. \nFor example, the determination of what constitutes “private\ninformation”—and thus triggering particular privacy\nconcerns—becomes difficult within the context of big data\nresearch. Distinctions within the regulatory definition of\n“private information”—namely, that it only applies\nto information which subjects reasonably expect is not normally\nmonitored or collected and not normally publicly\navailable—become less clearly applicable when considering the\ndata environments and collection practices that typify big data\nresearch, such as the wholesale scraping of Facebook news feed content\nor public OKCupid accounts. \nWhen considered through the lens of the regulatory definition of\n“private information”, social media postings are often\nconsidered public, especially when users take no visible, affirmative\nsteps to restrict access. As a result, big data researchers might\nconclude subjects are not deserving of particular privacy\nconsideration. Yet, the social media platforms frequently used for big\ndata research purposes represent a complex environment of\nsocio-technical interactions, where users often fail to understand\nfully how their social activities might be regularly monitored,\nharvested, and shared with third parties, where privacy policies and\nterms of service are not fully understood and change frequently, and\nwhere the technical infrastructures and interfaces are designed to\nmake restricting information flows and protecting one’s privacy\ndifficult. \nAs noted\n in §4.1 above\n it becomes difficult to confirm a user’s intention when sharing\ninformation on a social media platform, and whether users recognize\nthat providing information in a social environment also opens it up\nfor widespread harvesting and use by researchers. This uncertainty in\nthe intent and expectations of users of social media and\ninternet-based platforms—often fueled by the design of the\nplatforms themselves—create numerous conceptual muddles in our\nability to properly alleviate potential privacy concerns in big data\nresearch. \nThe conceptual gaps that exist regarding privacy and the definition of\npersonally identifiable information in the context of big data\nresearch inevitably lead to similar gaps regarding when informed\nconsent is necessary. Researchers mining Facebook profile information\nor public Twitter streams, for example, typically argue that no\nspecific consent is necessary due to the fact the information was\npublicly available. It remains unknown whether users truly understood\nthe technical conditions under which they made information visible on\nthese social media platforms or if they foresaw their data being\nharvested for research purposes, rather than just appearing onscreen\nfor fleeting glimpses by their friends and followers (Fiesler &\nProferes, 2018). In the case of the Facebook emotional contagion\nexperiment (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock 2014), the lack of\nobtaining consent was initially rationalized through the notion that\nthe research appeared to have been carried out under Facebook’s\nextensive terms of service, whose data use policy, while more than\n9,000 words long, does make passing mention to “research”.\nIt was later revealed, however, that the data use policy in effect\nwhen the experiment was conducted never mentioned\n“research” at all (Hill 2014). \nAdditional ethical concerns have arisen surrounding the large scale\ndata collection practices connected to machine learning and the\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence. For example, negative public\nattention have surrounded algorithms designed to infer sexual\norientation from photographs and facial recognition algorithms trained\non videos of transgender people. In both cases, ethical concerns have\nbeen raised about both the purpose of these algorithms and the fact\nthat the data that trained them (dating profile photos and YouTube\nvideos, respectively) was “public” but collected from\npotentially vulnerable populations without consent (Metcalf 2017;\nKeyes 2019). While those building AI systems cannot always control the\nconditions under which the data they utilize is collected, their\nincreased use of big datasets captured from social media or related\nsources raises a number of concerns beyond what typically is\nconsidered part of the growing focus on AI ethics: fairness,\naccountability and transparency in AI can only be fully possible when\ndata collection is achieved in a fair, ethical, and just manner (Stahl\n& Wright 2018; Kerry 2020). \nThe Facebook emotional contagion experiment, discussed above, is just\none example in a larger trend of big data research conducted outside\nof traditional university-based research ethics oversight mechanisms.\nNearly all online companies and platforms analyze data and test\ntheories that often rely on data from individual users. Industry-based\ndata research, once limited to marketing-oriented “A/B\ntesting” of benign changes in interface designs or corporate\ncommunication messages, now encompasses information about how users\nbehave online, what they click and read, how they move, eat, and\nsleep, the content they consume online, and even how they move about\ntheir homes. Such research produces inferences about\nindividuals’ tastes and preferences, social relations,\ncommunications, movements, and work habits. It implies pervasive\ntesting of products and services that are an integral part of intimate\ndaily life, ranging from connected home products to social networks to\nsmart cars. Except in cases where they are partnering with academic\ninstitutions, companies typically do not put internal research\nactivities through a formal ethical review process, since results are\ntypically never shared publicly and the perceived impact on users is\nminimal. \nThe growth of industry-based big data research, however, presents new\nrisks to individuals’ privacy, on the one hand, and to\norganizations’ legal compliance, reputation, and brand, on the\nother hand. When organizations process personal data outside of their\noriginal context, individuals may in some cases greatly benefit, but\nin other cases may be surprised, outraged, or even harmed. Soliciting\nconsent from affected individuals can be impractical: Organizations\nmight collect data indirectly or based on identifiers that do not\ndirectly match individuals’ contact details. Moreover, by\ndefinition, some non-contextual uses—including the retention of\ndata for longer than envisaged for purposes of a newly emergent\nuse—may be unforeseen at the time of collection. As Crawford and\nSchultz (2014) note, \nhow does one give notice and get consent for innumerable and perhaps\neven yet-to-be-determined queries that one might run that create\n“personal data”? (2014: 108) \nWith corporations developing vast “living laboratories”\nfor big data research, research ethics has become a critical component\nof the design and oversight of these activities. For example, in\nresponse to the controversy surrounding the emotional contagion\nexperiment, Facebook developed an internal ethical review process\nthat, according to its facilitators, \nleverages the company’s organizational structure, creating\nmultiple training opportunities and research review checkpoints in the\nexisting organizational flow (Jackman & Kanerva 2016: 444). \nWhile such efforts are important and laudable, they remain open for\nimprovement. Hoffmann (2016), for example, has criticized Facebook for\nlaunching \nan ethics review process that innovates on process but tells us little\nabout the ethical values informing their product development. \nFurther, in their study of employees doing the work of ethics inside\nof numerous Silicon Valley companies, Metcalf and colleagues found\nconsiderable tension between trying to resolve thorny ethical dilemmas\nthat emerge within an organization’s data practices and the\nbroader business model and corporate logic that dominates internal\ndecision-making (Metcalf, Moss, & boyd 2019). \nWhile many researchers and review boards across the world work without\nformal guidance, many research ethics boards have developed guidelines\nfor Internet research. While many such guidelines exist, the following\nprovides examples for researchers preparing for an REB review, or for\nboards developing their own policies. \nAdditional resources are found in\n Other Internet Resources\n below.","contact.mail":"buchanan.elizabeth@marshfieldresearch.org","contact.domain":"marshfieldresearch.org"},{"date.published":"2012-06-22","date.changed":"2021-01-12","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-internet-research/","author1":"Elizabeth A.

The Internet, as a field, a tool, and a venue,\nhas specific and far-reaching ethical issues. Internet research ethics\nis a subdiscipline that fits across many disciplines, ranging from\nsocial sciences, arts and humanities, medical/biomedical, and natural\nsciences. Extant ethical frameworks, including\n consequentialism,\n deontology,\n virtue ethics,\n and\n feminist ethics,\n have contributed to the ways in which ethical issues in Internet\nresearch are considered and evaluated.\n\n\nConceptually and historically, Internet research ethics is most\nrelated to computer and information ethics and includes such ethical\nissues as participant knowledge and consent, data privacy, security,\nanonymity and confidentiality, and integrity of data, intellectual\nproperty issues, and community, disciplinary, and professional\nstandards or norms. Throughout the Internet’s evolution, there\nhas been continued debate whether there are new ethical dilemmas\nemerging, or if the existing dilemmas are similar to dilemmas in other\nresearch realms (Elgesem 2002; Walther 2002; Ess & AoIR 2002;\nMarhkam & Buchanan 2012). These debates are similar to\nphilosophical debates in computer and information ethics. For example,\nmany years ago, James Moor (1985) asked “what is special about\ncomputers” in order to understand what, if anything, is unique\nethically. Reminding us, however, that research itself must be guided\nby ethical principles, regardless of technological intervention, van\nHeerden et al. (2020) and Sloan et al. (2020) stress that the\n“fundamental principles of conducting ethical social research\nremain the same” (Ess & AoIR 2002; King 1996; Samuel and\nBuchanan, 2020).\n\n\nYet, as the Internet has evolved into a more social and communicative\ntool and venue, the ethical issues have shifted from purely\ndata-driven to more human-centered. “On-ground” or\nface-to-face analogies, however, may not be applicable to online\nresearch. For example, the concept of the public park has been used as\na site where researchers might observe others with little ethical\ncontroversy, but online, the concepts of public versus private are\nmuch more complex (SACHRP 2013). Thus, some scholars suggest that the\nspecificity of Internet research ethics calls for new regulatory\nand/or professional and disciplinary guidance. For these reasons, the\nconcept of human subjects research policies and regulation, informs\nthis entry, which will continue discussions around ethical and\nmethodological complexity, including personal identifiability,\nreputational risk and harm, notions of public space and public text,\nownership, and longevity of data as they relate to Internet research.\nSpecifically, the emergence of the social web raises issues around\nsubject or participant recruitment practices, tiered informed consent\nmodels, and protection of various expectations and forms of privacy in\nan ever-increasing world of diffused and ubiquitous technologies.\nAdditional ethical concerns center on issues of anonymity and\nconfidentiality of data in spaces where researchers and their subjects\nmay not fully understand the terms and conditions of those venues or\ntools, challenges to data integrity as research projects can be\noutsourced or crowdsourced to online labor marketplaces, and\njurisdictional issues as more research is processed, stored, and\ndisseminated via cloud computing or in remote server locales,\npresenting myriad legal complexities given jurisdictional differences\nin data laws. Further, the dominance of big data research has\ncontinued across research spaces, with the notions of\n“real-world data” and pervasive computing readily accepted\nand used in all disciplines. The ease of access and availability to\nuse big data sets in myriad ways has enabled AI (artificial\nintelligence) and ML (machine learning) to grow as standard tools for\nresearchers.\n\n\nAs a result, researchers using the Internet as a tool for and/or a\nspace of research—and their research ethics boards (REBs), also\nknown as institutional review boards (IRBs) in the United States or\nhuman research ethics committees (HRECs) in other countries such as\nAustralia—have been confronted with a series of new ethical\nquestions: What ethical obligations do researchers have to protect the\nprivacy of subjects engaging in activities in “public”\nInternet spaces? What are such public spaces? Is there any reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in an era of pervasive and ubiquitous\nsurveillance and data tracking? How is confidentiality or anonymity\nassured online? How is and should informed consent be obtained online?\nHow should research on minors be conducted, and how do you prove a\nsubject is not a minor? Is deception (pretending to be someone you are\nnot, withholding identifiable information, etc.) an acceptable online\nnorm or a harm? How is “harm” possible to someone existing\nin an online space? How identifiable are individuals in large data\nsets? Do human subjects protections apply to big data? As more\nindustry-sponsored research takes place, what ethical protections\nexist outside of current regulatory structures? As laws, such as the\nEU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016) are enacted,\nwhat are the global implications for data privacy and individual\nrights?\n\n\nA growing number of scholars have explored these and related questions\n(see, for example, Bromseth 2002; Bruckman 2006; Buchanan 2004;\nBuchanan & Ess 2008; Johns, Chen & Hall 2003; Kitchin 2003,\n2008; King 1996; Mann 2003; Markham & Baym 2008; McKee &\nPorter 2009; Thorseth 2003; Ess 2016; Zimmer & Kinder-Kurlanda\n(eds.) 2017; Samuel & Buchanan, 2020), scholarly associations have\ndrafted ethical guidelines for Internet research (Ess &\nAssociation of Internet Researchers 2002; Markham, Buchanan, and AoIR\n2012; franzke et al., 2020; Kraut et al. 2004), and non-profit\nscholarly and scientific agencies such as AAAS (Frankel & Siang\n1999) are confronting the myriad of ethical concerns that Internet\nresearch poses to researchers and research ethics boards (REBs).\n\n\nGiven that over 50% of the world population uses the Internet, and\nthat 97% of the world population now lives within reach of a mobile\ncellular signal and 93% within reach of a 3G (or higher) network\n(International Telecommunications Union, 2019), continued exploration\nof the ethical issues related to research in this heavily mediated\nenvironment is critical.\n\nThe commonly accepted definition of Internet research ethics (IRE) has\nbeen used by Buchanan and Ess (2008, 2009), Buchanan (2011), and Ess\n& Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) (2002): \nIRE is defined as the analysis of ethical issues and\napplication of research ethics principles as they pertain to research\nconducted on and in the Internet. Internet-based research, broadly\ndefined, is research which utilizes the Internet to collect\ninformation through an online tool, such as an online survey; studies\nabout how people use the Internet, e.g., through collecting data\nand/or examining activities in or on any online environments; and/or,\nuses of online datasets, databases, or repositories. \nThese examples were broadened in 2013 by the United States\nSecretary’s Advisory Committee to the Office for Human Research\nProtections (SACHRP 2013), and included under the umbrella term\nInternet Research: \nA critical distinction in the definition of Internet research ethics\nis that between the Internet as a research tool versus a research\nvenue. The distinction between tool and venue plays out across\ndisciplinary and methodological orientations. As a tool, Internet\nresearch is enabled by search engines, data aggregators, digital\narchives, application programming interfaces (APIs), online survey\nplatforms, and crowdsourcing platforms. Internet-based research venues\ninclude such spaces as conversation applications (instant messaging\nand discussion forums, for example), online multiplayer games, blogs\nand interactive websites, and social networking platforms. \nAnother way of conceptualizing the distinction between tool and venue\ncomes from Kitchin (2008), who has referred to a distinction in\nInternet research using the concepts of “engaged web-based\nresearch” versus “non-intrusive web-based\nresearch:” \nNon-intrusive analyses refer to techniques of data collection that do\nnot interrupt the naturally occurring state of the site or\ncybercommunity, or interfere with premanufactured text. Conversely,\nengaged analyses reach into the site or community and thus engage the\nparticipants of the web source (2008: 15). \nThese two constructs provide researchers with a way of recognizing\nwhen considering of human subject protections might need to occur.\nMcKee and Porter (2009), as well as Banks and Eble (2007) provide\nguidance on the continuum of human-subjects research, noting a\ndistinction between person-based versus text-based. For example, McKee\nand Porter provide a range of research variables (public/private,\ntopic sensitivity, degree of interaction, and subject vulnerability)\nwhich are useful in determining where on the continuum of text-based\nversus how person-based the research is, and whether or not subjects\nwould need to consent to the research (2009: 87–88). \nWhile conceptually useful for determining human subjects\nparticipation, the distinction between tool and venue or engaged\nversus non-intrusive web-based research is increasingly blurring in\nthe face of social media and their third-party applications. Buchanan\n(2016) has conceptualized three phases or stages of Internet research,\nand the emergence of social media characterize the second phase, circa\n2006–2014. The concept of social media entails \nA group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological\nand technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation\nand exchange of user-generated content (Kaplan & Haenlein 2010:\n61). \nA “social network site” is a category of websites with\nprofiles, semi-persistent public commentary on the profile, and a\ntraversable publicly articulated social network displayed in relation\nto the profile. \nThis collapse of tool and venue can be traced primarily to the\nincreasing use of third-party sites and applications such as Facebook,\nTwitter, or any of the myriad online research tools where subject or\nparticipant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and data\ndissemination can all occur in the same space. With these collapsing\nboundaries, the terms of “inter-jurisdictional\ncoordination” (Gilbert 2009: 3) are inherently challenging;\nGilbert has specifically argued against the terms of use or end-user\nlicense agreement stipulations in virtual worlds, noting that such\nagreements are often “flawed”, as they rely on laws and\nregulations from a specific locale and attempt to enforce them in a\nnon place-based environment. Nonetheless, researchers now make\nfrequent use of data aggregation tools, scraping data from user\nprofiles or transaction logs, harvesting data from Twitter streams, or\nstoring data on cloud servers such as Dropbox only after agreeing to\nthe terms of service that go along with those sites. The use of such\nthird party applications or tools changes fundamental aspects of\nresearch, oftentimes displacing the researcher or research team as the\nsole owner of their data. These unique characteristics implicate\nconcepts and practicalities of privacy, consent, ownership, and\njurisdictional boundaries. \nA key moment that typified and called attention to many of these\nconcerns emerged with the 2014 Facebook Emotional Contagion study\n(Booth, 2014). By virtue of agreeing to Facebook’s Terms of\nService, did users consent to participation in research activities?\nShould there have been a debriefing after the experiment? How\nthoroughly did a university research ethics board review the study?\nShould industry-sponsored research undergo internal ethics review? In\nresponse to the outcry of the Contagion study, Ok Cupid’s\nChristian Rudder (2014\n [OIR])\n defended these sorts of experiments, noting \nWe noticed recently that people didn’t like it when Facebook\n“experimented” with their news feed. Even the FTC is\ngetting involved. But guess what, everybody: if you use the Internet,\nyou’re the subject of hundreds of experiments at any given time,\non every site. That’s how websites work. \nThe phenomenon of the social web forces an ongoing negotiation between\nresearchers and their data sources, as seen in the Facebook contagion\nstudy and the subsequent reaction to it. Moreover, with the growing\nuse and concentration of mobile devices, the notion of Internet\nresearch is expanding with a movement away from a\n“place-based” Internet to a dispersed reality. Data\ncollection from mobile devices has increased exponentially. For\nexample, mobile devices enable the use of synchronous data collection\nand dissemination from non-place based environments. Researchers using\ncloud-enabled applications can send and receive data to and from\nparticipants synchronously. The impact of such research possibilities\nfor epidemiological research is staggering for its scientific\npotential while demanding for the concurrent ethical challenges, as we\nare seeing with mobile-based COVID-19 research (Drew et al., 2020) and\nthe sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in\nreal-time (Hubach et al., forthcoming). As Internet research has grown\nfrom a niche methodology into a nearly ubiquitous and often invisible\npractice, the traditional concepts of human subjects research require\ncareful consideration. \nThe practical, professional, and theoretical implications of human\nsubjects protections has been covered extensively in scholarly\nliterature, ranging from medical/biomedical to social sciences to\ncomputing and technical disciplines (see Beauchamp & Childress\n2008; Emanual et al. 2003; PRIM&R et al. 2021; Sieber 1992; Wright\n2006). Relevant protections and regulations continue to receive much\nattention in the face of research ethics violations (see, for example,\nSkloot 2010, on Henrietta Lacks; the U.S. Government’s admission\nand apology to the Guatemalan Government for STD testing in the 1940s\n(BBC 2011); and Gaw & Burns 2011, on how lessons from the past\nmight inform current research ethics and conduct). \nThe history of human subjects protections (Sparks 2002 [see\n Other Internet Resources aka OIR])\n grew out of atrocities such as Nazi human experimentation during\nWorld War II, which resulted in the Nuremberg Code (1947);\nsubsequently followed by the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical\nPrinciples for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects (World\nMedical Association 1964/2008). Partially in response to the Tuskegee\nsyphilis experiment, an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932\nand 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service studying the natural\nprogression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in\nAlabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the\ngovernment, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services put forth\na set of basic regulations governing the protection of human subjects\n(45 C.F.R. § 46) (see the links in the Other Internet Resources\nsection, under Laws and Government Documents). This was\nlater followed by the publication of the “Ethical\nPrinciples and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of\nResearch” by the National Commission for the Protection of Human\nSubjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, known as the Belmont\nReport (NCPHSBBR 1979). The Belmont Report identifies three\nfundamental ethical principles for all human subjects research:\nRespect for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice. \nTo ensure consistency across federal agencies in the United States\ncontext in human subjects protections, in 1991, the Federal Policy for\nthe Protection of Human Subjects, also known as the “Common\nRule” was codified; the Revised Common Rule was released in the\nFederal Register on 19 January 2017, and went into effect 19 July\n2018. Similar regulatory frameworks for the protection of human\nsubjects exist across the world, and include, for example, the\nCanadian Tri-Council, the Australian Research Council, The European\nCommission, The Research Council of Norway and its National Committee\nfor Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and Humanities (NESH 2006;\nNESH 2019), and the U.K.’s NHS National Research Ethics Service\nand the Research Ethics Framework (REF) of the ESRC (Economic and\nSocial Research Council) General Guidelines, and the Forum for Ethical\nReview Committees in Asia and the Western Pacific (FERCAP). \nIn the United States, the various regulatory agencies who have signed\non to the Common Rule (45 C.F.R. 46 Subpart A) have not issued formal\nguidance on Internet research (see the links in the Other Internet\nResources section, under Laws and Government Documents). The\nPreamble to the Revised Rule referenced significant changes in the\nresearch environment, recognizing a need to broaden the scope of the\nRule. However, substantial changes to the actual Rule in regards to\nInternet research in its broadest context, were minimal. \nFor example, the Preamble states: \nThis final rule recognizes that in the past two decades a paradigm\nshift has occurred in how research is conducted. Evolving\ntechnologies—including imaging, mobile technologies, and the\ngrowth in computing power—have changed the scale and nature of\ninformation collected in many disciplines. Computer scientists,\nengineers, and social scientists are developing techniques to\nintegrate different types of data so they can be combined, mined,\nanalyzed, and shared. The advent of sophisticated computer software\nprograms, the Internet, and mobile technology has created new areas of\nresearch activity, particularly within the social and behavioral\nsciences (Federal Register 2017 and HHS 2017). \nModest changes to the definition of human subjects included changing\n“data” to “information” and\n“biospecimens;” the definition now reads: \nHowever, the Revised Rule does have a provision that stands to be of\nimport in regards to Internet research; the Rule calls for\nimplementing departments or agencies to, \nAs of this writing, there has not yet been a reexamination of the\nconcepts of “identifiable private information” or\n“identifiable biospecimens”. However, as data analytics,\nAI, and machine learning continue to expose ethical issues in human\nsubjects research, we expect to see engaged discussion at the federal\nlevel and amongst research communities (PRIM&R 2021). Those\ndiscussions may refer to previous conceptual work by Carpenter and\nDittrich (2012) and Aycock et al. (2012) that is concerned with risk\nand identifiability. Secondary uses of identifiable, private data, for\nexample, may pose downstream harms, or unintentional risks, causing\nreputational or informational harms. Reexaminations of\n“identifiable private information” can not occur without\nserious consideration of risk and “human harming\nresearch”. Carpenter and Dittrich (2012) encourage \n“Review boards should transition from an informed consent driven\nreview to a risk analysis review that addresses potential harms\nstemming from research in which a researcher does not directly\ninteract with the at-risk individuals” (p. 4) as “[T]his\ndistance between researcher and affected individual indicates that a\nparadigm shift is necessary in the research arena. We must transition\nour idea of research protection from ‘human subjects\nresearch’ to ‘human harming research’” (p.\n 14).[1] \nSimilarly, Aycock et al. (2012) assert that \nResearchers and boards must balance presenting risks related to the\nspecific research with risks related to the technologies in use. With\ncomputer security research, major issues around risk arise, for\nsociety at large especially. The risk may not seem evident to an\nindividual but in the scope of security research, larger populations\nmay be vulnerable. There is a significant difficulty in quantifying\nrisks and benefits, in the traditional sense of research\nethics….An aggregation of surfing behaviors collected by a bot\npresents greater distance between researcher and respondent than an\ninterview done in a virtual world between avatars. This distance leads\nus to suggest that computer security research focus less concern\naround human subjects research in the traditional sense and\nmore concern with human harming research (p. 3, italics\noriginal). \nThese two conceptual notions are relevant for considering emergent\nforms of identities or personally identifiable information (PII) such\nas avatars, virtual beings, bots, textual and graphical information.\nWithin the Code of Federal Regulations (45 C.F.R. § 46.102(f)\n2009): New forms of representations are considered human subjects if\nPII about living individuals is obtained. PII can be obtained by\nresearchers through scraping data sources, profiles or avatars, or\nother pieces of data made available by the platform. Fairfield agrees:\n“An avatar, for example, does not merely represent a collection\nof pixels—it represents the identity of the user” (2012:\n701). \nThe multiple academic disciplines already long engaged in human\nsubjects research (medicine, sociology, anthropology, psychology,\ncommunication) have established ethical guidelines intended to assist\nresearchers and those charged with ensuring that research on human\nsubjects follows both legal requirements and ethical practices. But\nwith research involving the Internet—where individuals\nincreasingly share personal information on platforms with porous and\nshifting boundaries, where both the spread and aggregation of data\nfrom disparate sources has become the norm, and where web-based\nservices, and their privacy policies and terms of service statements,\nmorph and evolve rapidly—the ethical frameworks and assumptions\ntraditionally used by researchers and REBs are frequently\nchallenged. \nResearch ethics boards themselves are increasingly challenged with the\nunique ethical dimensions of internet-based research protocols. In a\n2008 survey of U.S. IRBs, less than half of the ethical review boards\nidentified internet-based research was “an area of concern or\nimportance” at that time, and only 6% had guidelines or\nchecklists in place for reviewing internet-based research protocols\n(Buchanan & Ess 2009). By 2015, 93% of IRBs surveyed acknowledged\nthat are ethical issues unique to research using “online\ndata”, yet only 55% said they felt their IRBs are well versed in\nthe technical aspects of online data collection, and only 57% agreed\nthat their IRB has the expertise to stay abreast of changes in online\ntechnology. IRBs are now further challenged with the growth of big\ndata research (see\n §4.5 below),\n which increasingly relies on large datasets of personal information\ngenerated via social media, digital devices, or other means often\nhidden from users. A 2019 study of IRBs revealed only 25% felt\nprepared to evaluate protocols relying on big data, and only 6% had\ntools sufficient for considering this emerging area of internet\nresearch (Zimmer & Chapman 2020). Further, after being presented\nvarious hypothetical research scenarios utilizing big data and asked\nhow their IRB would likely review such a protocol, numerous viewpoints\ndifferent strongly in many cases. Consider the following scenario: \nResearchers plan to scrape public comments from online newspaper pages\nto predict election outcomes. They will aggregate their analysis to\ndetermine public sentiment. The researchers don’t plan to inform\ncommenters, and they plan to collect potentially-identifiable user\nnames. Scraping comments violates the newspaper’s terms of\nservice. \n18% of respondents indicated their IRB would view this as exempt, 21%\nindicated expedited review, 33% suggested it would need full board\nreview, while 28% did not think this was even human subjects research\nthat would fall under their IRB’s purview (Zimmer & Chapman\n2020). This points to potential gaps and inconsistencies in how IRBs\nreview the ethical implications of big data research protocols. \nAn extensive body of literature has developed since the 1990s around\nthe use of the Internet for research (S. Jones 1999; Hunsinger,\nKlastrup, & Allen (eds.) 2010; Consalvo & Ess (eds.) 2011;\nZimmer & Kinder-Kurlanda (eds.) 2017), with a growing emphasis on\nthe ethical dimensions of Internet research. \nA flurry of Internet research, and explicit concern for the ethical\nissues concurrently at play in it, began in the mid-1990s. In 1996,\nStorm King recognized the growing use of the Internet as a venue for\nresearch. His work explored the American Psychological\nAssociation’s guidelines for human subjects research with\nemergent forms of email, chat, listservs, and virtual communities.\nWith careful attention to risk and benefit to Internet subjects, King\noffered a cautionary note: \nWhen a field of study is new, the fine points of ethical\nconsiderations involved are undefined. As the field matures and\nresults are compiled, researchers often review earlier studies and\nbecome concerned because of the apparent disregard for the human\nsubjects involved (1996: 119). \nThe 1996 issue of Information Society dedicated to Internet\nresearch is considered a watershed moment, and included much seminal\nresearch still of impact and relevance today (Allen 1996;\nBoehlefeld 1996; Reid 1996). \nSherry Turkle’s 1997 Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age\nof the Internet called direct attention to the human element of\nonline game environments. Moving squarely towards person-based versus\ntext-based research, Turkle pushed researchers to consider human\nsubjects implications of Internet research. Similarly, Markham’s\nLife Online: Researching Real Experience in Virtual Space\n(1998) highlighted the methodological complexities of online\nethnographic studies, as did Jacobson’s 1999 methodological\ntreatment of Internet research. The “field” of study\nchanged the dynamics of researcher-researched roles, identity, and\nrepresentation of participants from virtual spaces. Markham’s\nwork in qualitative online research has been influential across\ndisciplines, as research in nursing, psychology, and medicine has\nfound the potential of this paradigm for online research (Flicker et\nal. 2004; Eysenbach & Till 2001; Seaboldt & Kupier 1997; Sharf\n1997). \nThen, in 1999, the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS), with a contract from the U.S. Office for Protection from\nResearch Risks (now known as the Office for Human Research\nProtections), convened a workshop, with the goal of assessing the\nalignment of traditional research ethics concepts to Internet\nresearch. The workshop acknowledged \nThe vast amount of social and behavioral information potentially\navailable on the Internet has made it a prime target for researchers\nwishing to study the dynamics of human interactions and their\nconsequences in this virtual medium. Researchers can potentially\ncollect data from widely dispersed population sat relatively low cost\nand in less time than similar efforts in the physical world. As a\nresult, there has been an increase in the number of Internet studies,\nranging from surveys to naturalistic observation (Frankel & Siang\n1999: 1). \nIn the medical/biomedical contexts, Internet research has grown\nrapidly. Also in 1999, Gunther Eysenbach wrote the first editorial to\nthe newly formed Journal of Medical Internet Research. There\nwere three driving forces behind the inception of this journal, and\nEysenbach called attention to the growing social and interpersonal\naspects of the Internet: \nFirst, Internet protocols are used for clinical information and\ncommunication. In the future, Internet technology will be the platform\nfor many telemedical applications. Second, the Internet revolutionizes\nthe gathering, access and dissemination of non-clinical information in\nmedicine: Bibliographic and factual databases are now world-wide\naccessible via graphical user interfaces, epidemiological and public\nhealth information can be gathered using the Internet, and\nincreasingly the Internet is used for interactive medical education\napplications. Third, the Internet plays an important role for consumer\nhealth education, health promotion and teleprevention. (As an aside,\nit should be emphasized that “health education” on the\nInternet goes beyond the traditional model of health education, where\na medical professional teaches the patient: On the Internet, much\n“health education” is done\n“consumer-to-consumer” by means of patient self support\ngroups organizing in cyberspace. These patient-to-patient interchanges\nare becoming an important part of healthcare and are redefining the\ntraditional model of preventive medicine and health promotion). \nWith scholarly attention growing and with the 1999 AAAS report\n(Frankel & Siang 1999) calling for action, other professional\nassociations took notice and began drafting statements or guidelines,\nor addendum to their extant professional standards. For example, The\nBoard of Scientific Affairs (BSA) of the American Psychological\nAssociation established an Advisory Group on Conducting Research on\nthe Internet in 2001; the American Counseling Association’s 2005\nrevision to its Code of Ethics; the Association of Internet\nResearchers (AoIR) Ethics Working Group Guidelines, the National\nCommittee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the\nHumanities (NESH Norway), among others, have directed researchers and\nreview boards to the ethics of Internet research, with attention to\nthe most common areas of ethical concern (see\n OIR\n for links). \nWhile many researchers focus on traditional research ethics\nprinciples, conceptualizations of Internet research ethics depend on\ndisciplinary perspectives. Some disciplines, notably from the arts and\nhumanities, posit that Internet research is more about context and\nrepresentation than about “human subjects”, suggesting\nthere is no intent, and thus minimal or no harm, to engage in research\nabout actual persons. The debate has continued since the early 2000s.\nWhite (2002) argued against extant regulations that favored or\nprivileged specific ideological, disciplinary and cultural\nprerogatives, which limit the freedoms and creativity of arts and\nhumanities research. For example, she notes that the AAAS report\n“confuses physical individuals with constructed materials and\nhuman subjects with composite cultural works”, again calling\nattention to the person versus text divide that has permeated Internet\nresearch ethics debates. Another example of disciplinary differences\ncomes from the Oral History Association, which acknowledged the\ngrowing use of the Internet as a site for research: \nSimply put, oral history collects memories and personal commentaries\nof historical significance through recorded interviews. An oral\nhistory interview generally consists of a well-prepared interviewer\nquestioning an interviewee and recording their exchange in audio or\nvideo format. Recordings of the interview are transcribed, summarized,\nor indexed and then placed in a library or archives. These interviews\nmay be used for research or excerpted in a publication, radio or video\ndocumentary, museum exhibition, dramatization or other form of public\npresentation. Recordings, transcripts, catalogs, photographs and\nrelated documentary materials can also be posted on the Internet\n(Ritchie 2003: 19). \nWhile the American Historical Association (A. Jones 2008) has argued\nthat such research be “explicitly exempted” from ethical\nreview board oversight, the use of the Internet could complicate such\na stance if such data became available in public settings or available\n“downstream” with potential, unforeseeable risks to\nreputation, economic standing, or psychological harm, should\nidentification occur. \nUnder the concept of text rather than human subjects, Internet\nresearch rests on arguments of publication and copyright; consider the\nvenue of a blog, which does not meet the definition of human subject\nas in 45 C.F.R. § 46.102f (2009), as interpreted by most ethical\nreview boards. A researcher need not obtain consent to use text from a\nblog, as it is generally considered publicly available, textual,\npublished material. This argument of the “public park”\nanalogy that has been generally accepted by researchers is appropriate\nfor some Internet venues and tools, but not all: Context, intent,\nsensitivity of data, and expectations of Internet participants were\nidentified in 2004 by Sveninngsson as crucial markers in Internet\nresearch ethics considerations. \nBy the mid-2000s, with three major anthologies published, and a\ngrowing literature base, there was ample scholarly literature\ndocumenting IRE across disciplines and methodologies, and\nsubsequently, there was anecdotal data emerging from the review boards\nevaluating such research. In search of empirical data regarding the\nactual review board processes of Internet research from a human\nsubjects perspective, Buchanan and Ess surveyed over 700 United States\nethics review boards, and found that boards were primarily concerned\nwith privacy, data security and confidentiality, and ensuring\nappropriate informed consent and recruitment procedures (Buchanan\n& Ess 2009; Buchanan & Hvizdak 2009). \nIn 2008, the Canadian Tri-Council’s Social Sciences and\nHumanities Research Ethics Special Working Committee: A Working\nCommittee of the Interagency Advisory Panel on Research Ethics was\nconvened (Blackstone et al. 2008); and in 2010, a meeting at the\nSecretary’s Advisory Committee to the Office for Human Research\nProtections highlighted Internet research (SACHRP 2010). Such\nprominent professional organizations as the Public Responsibility in\nMedicine and Research (PRIM&R) and the American Educational\nResearch Association (AERA) have begun featuring Internet research\nethics regularly at their conferences and related publications. \nRecently, disciplines not traditionally involved in human subjects\nresearch have begun their own explorations of IRE. For example,\nresearchers in computer security have actively examined the tenets of\nresearch ethics in CS and ICT (Aycock et al. 2012; Dittrich, Bailey,\n& Dietrich 2011; Carpenter & Dittrich 2012; Buchanan et al.\n2011). Notably, the U.S. Federal Register requested comments on\n“The Menlo Report” in December 2011, which calls for a\ncommitment by computer science researchers to the three principles of\nrespect for persons, beneficence, and justice, while also adding a\nfourth principle on respect for law and public interest (Homeland\nSecurity 2011). SIGCHI, an international society for professionals,\nacademics, and students interested in human-technology and\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI), has increasingly focused on how IRE\napplies to work in their domain (Frauenberger et al. 2017; Fiesler et\nal. 2018). \nPrinciples of research ethics dictate that researchers must ensure\nthere are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and\nto maintain the confidentiality of any data collected. A violation of\nprivacy or breach of confidentiality presents a risk of serious harm\nto participants, ranging from the exposure of personal or sensitive\ninformation, the divulgence of embarrassing or illegal conduct, or the\nrelease of data otherwise protected under law. \nResearch ethics concerns around individual privacy is often expressed\nin terms of the level of linkability of data to individuals, and the\npotential harms from disclosure of information As Internet research\nhas grown in complexity and computational sophistication, ethics\nconcerns have focused on current and future uses of data, and the\npotential downstream harms that could occur. Protecting research\nparticipants’ privacy and confidentiality is typically achieved\nthrough a combination of research tactics and practices, including\nengaging in data collection under controlled or anonymous\nenvironments, the scrubbing of data to remove personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), or the use of access restrictions and related data\nsecurity methods. And, the specificity and characteristics of the data\nwill often dictate if there are regulatory considerations, in addition\nto the methodological considerations around privacy and\nconfidentiality. For example, personally identifiable information\n(PII) typically demands the most stringent protections. The National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), for example, defines PII as: \nany information about an individual maintained by an agency,\nincluding, but not limited to, education, financial transactions,\nmedical history, and criminal or employment history and information\nwhich can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s\nidentity, such as their name, SSN, date and place of birth,\nmother’s maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any\nother personal information that is linked or linkable to an individual\n(NIH 2010). \nTypically, examples of identifying pieces of information have included\npersonal characteristics (such as date of birth, place of birth,\nmother’s maiden name, gender, sexual orientation, and other\ndistinguishing features and biometrics information, such as height,\nweight, physical appearance, fingerprints, DNA and retinal scans),\nunique numbers or identifiers assigned to an individual (such as a\nname, address, phone number, social security number, driver’s\nlicense number, financial account numbers), and descriptions of\nphysical location (GIS/GPS log data, electronic bracelet monitoring\ninformation). \nThe 2018 EU General Data Protection Regulation lays out the legal and\nregulatory requirements for data use across the EU. Mondschein &\nMonda (2018) provides a thorough discussion on the different types of\ndata that are considered in the GDPR: Personal data, such as names,\nidentification numbers, location data, and so on; Special categories\nof personal data, such as race or ethic origin, political opinions, or\nreligious beliefs; Pseudonymous data, referring to data that has been\naltered so the subject cannot be directly identified without having\nfurther information; Anonymous data, information which does not relate\nto an identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered\nanonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer\nidentifiable. They also advise researchers to consider \ndata protection issues at an early stage of a research project is of\ngreat importance specifically in the context of large-scale research\nendeavours that make use of personal data (2018: 56). \nInternet research introduces new complications to these longstanding\ndefinitions and regulatory frameworks intended to protect subject\nprivacy. For example, researchers increasingly are able to collect\ndetailed data about individuals from sources such as Facebook,\nTwitter, blogs or public email archives, and these rich data sets can\nmore easily be processed, compared, and combined with other data (and\ndatasets) available online. In numerous cases, both researchers and\nmembers of the general public have been able to re-identify\nindividuals by analyzing and comparing such datasets, using\ndata-fields as benign as one’s zip code (Sweeny 2002), random\nWeb search queries (Barbaro & Zeller 2006), or movie ratings\n(Narayanan & Shmatikov 2008) as the vital key for reidentification\nof a presumed anonymous user. Prior to widespread Internet-based data\ncollection and processing, few would have considered one’s movie\nratings or zipcode as personally-identifiable. Yet, these cases reveal\nthat merely stripping traditional “identifiable”\ninformation such as a subject’s name, address, or social\nsecurity number is no longer sufficient to ensure data remains\nanonymous (Ohm 2010), and requires the reconsideration of what is\nconsidered “personally identifiable information” (Schwartz\n& Solove 2011). This points to the critical distinction between\ndata that is kept confidential versus data that is truly anonymous.\nIncreasingly, data are rarely completely anonymous, as researchers\nhave routinely demonstrated they can often reidentify individuals\nhidden in “anonymized” datasets with ease (Ohm 2010). This\nreality places new pressure on ensuring datasets are kept, at the\nleast, suitably confidential through both physical and computational\nsecurity measures. These measures may also include requirements to\nstore data in “clean rooms”, or in non-networked\nenvironments in an effort to control data transmission. \nSimilarly, new types of data often collected in Internet research\nmight also be used to identify a subject within a previously-assumed\nanonymous dataset. For example, Internet researchers might collect\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses when conducting online surveys or\nanalyzing transaction logs. An IP address is a unique identifier that\nis assigned to every device connected to the Internet; in most cases,\nindividual computers are assigned a unique IP address, while in some\ncases the address is assigned to a larger node or Internet gateway for\na collection of computers. Nearly all websites and Internet service\nproviders store activity logs that link activity with IP addresses, in\nmany cases, eventually to specific computers or users. Current U.S.\nlaw does not hold IP addresses to be personally identifiable\ninformation, while other countries and regulatory bodies do. For\nexample, the European Data Privacy Act at Article 29, holds that IP\naddresses do constitute PII. Buchanan et al. (2011), note, however,\nthat under the U.S. Civil Rights Act, for the purposes of the HIPAA\n Act,[2]\n IP addresses are considered a form of PII (45 C.F.R. § 164.514\n 2002).[3]\n There could potentially be a reconsideration by other federal\nregulatory agencies over IP addresses as PII, and researchers and\nboards will need to be attentive should such change occur. \nA similar complication emerges when we consider the meaning of\n“private information” within the context of Internet-based\nresearch. U.S. federal regulations define “private\ninformation” as: \n[A]ny information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an\nindividual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is\ntaking place, and information that has been provided for specific\npurposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably\nexpect will not be made public (for example, a medical record) (45\nC.F.R. § 46.102(f) 2009). \nThis standard definition of “private information” has two\nkey components. First, private information is that which subjects\nreasonably expect is not normally monitored or collected. Second,\nprivate information is that which subjects reasonably expect is not\ntypically publicly available. Conversely, the definition also suggests\nthe opposite is true: if users cannot reasonably expect data\nisn’t being observed or recorded, or they cannot expect data\nisn’t publicly available, then the data does not rise to the\nlevel of “private information” requiring particular\nprivacy protections. Researchers and REBs have routinely worked with\nthis definition of “private information” to ensure the\nprotection of individuals’ privacy. \nThese distinctions take on greater weight, however, when considering\nthe data environments and collection practices common with\nInternet-based research. Researchers interested in collecting or\nanalyzing online actions of subjects—perhaps through the mining\nof online server logs, the use of tracking cookies, or the scraping of\nsocial media profiles and feeds—could argue that subjects do not\nhave a reasonable expectation that such online activities are not\nroutinely monitored since nearly all online transactions and\ninteractions are routinely logged by websites and service providers.\nThus, online data trails might not rise to the level of “private\ninformation”. However, numerous studies have indicated that\naverage Internet users have incomplete understandings of how their\nactivities are routinely tracked, and the related privacy practices\nand policies of the sites they visit (Hoofnagle & King 2008\n [OIR];\n Milne & Culnan 2004; Tsai et al. 2006). Hudson and Bruckman\n(2005) conducted empirical research on users’ expectations and\nunderstandings of privacy, finding that participants’\nexpectations of privacy within public chatrooms conflicted with what\nwas actually a very public online space. Rosenberg (2010) examined the\npublic/private distinction in the realm of virtual worlds, suggesting\nresearchers must determine what kind of social norms and relations\npredominate an online space before making assumptions about the\n“publicness” of information shared within. Thus, it\nremains unclear whether Internet users truly understand if and when\ntheir online activity is regularly monitored and tracked, and what\nkind of reasonable expectations truly exist. This ambiguity creates\nnew challenges for researchers and REBs when trying to apply the\ndefinition of “private information” to ensure subject\nprivacy is properly addressed (Zimmer 2010). \nThis complexity in addressing subject privacy in Internet research is\nfurther compounded with the rise of social networking as a place for\nthe sharing of information, and a site for research. Users\nincreasingly share more and more personal information on platforms\nlike Facebook or Twitter. For researchers, social media platforms\nprovide a rich resource for study, and much of the content is\navailable to be viewed and downloaded with minimal effort. Since much\nof the information posted to social media sites is publicly viewable,\nit thus fails to meet the standard regulatory definition of\n“private information”. Therefore, researchers attempting\nto collect and analyze social media postings might not treat the data\nas requiring any particular privacy considerations. Yet, social media\nplatforms represent a complex environment of social interaction where\nusers are often required to place friends, lovers, colleagues, and\nminor acquaintances within the same singular category of\n“friends”, where privacy policies and terms of service are\nnot fully understood (Madejski et al. 2011), and where the technical\ninfrastructures fail to truly support privacy projections (Bonneau\n& Preibush 2010) and regularly change with little notice (Stone\n2009\n [OIR];\n Zimmer 2009\n [OIR]).\n As a result, it is difficult to understand with any certainty what a\nuser’s intention was when posting an item onto a social media\nplatform (Acquisti & Gross 2006). The user may have intended the\npost for a private group but failed to completely understand how to\nadjust the privacy settings accordingly. Or, the information might\nhave previously been restricted to only certain friends, but a change\nin the technical platform suddenly made the data more visible to\nall. \nOhm (2010) warns that \nthe utility and privacy of data are linked, and so long as data is\nuseful, even in the slightest, then it is also potentially\nreidentifiable (2010: 1751). \nWith the rapid growth of Internet-based research, Ohm’s concern\nbecomes even more dire. The traditional definitions and approaches to\nunderstanding the nature of privacy, anonymity, and precisely what\nkind of information deserves protection becomes strained, forcing\nresearchers and REBs to consider more nuanced theories of privacy\n(Nissenbaum 2009) and approaches to respecting and projecting subject\nprivacy (Markham 2012; Zimmer 2010). \nDepending on the type of Internet research being carried out,\nrecruitment of participants may be done in a number of ways. As with\nany form of research, the study population or participants are\nselected for specific purposes (i.e., an ethnographic study of a\nparticular group on online game players), or, can be selected from a\nrange of sampling techniques (i.e., a convenience sample gleaned from\nthe users of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing\n platform[4]).\n In the U.S. context, a recruitment plan is considered part of the\ninformed consent process, and as such, any recruitment script or\nposting must be reviewed and approved by an REB prior to posting or\nbeginning solicitation (if the project is human subjects research).\nFurther, the selection of participants must be impartial and unbiased,\nand any risks and benefits must be justly distributed. This concept is\nchallenging to apply in Internet contexts, in which populations are\noften self-selected and can be exclusive, depending on membership and\naccess status, as well as the common disparities of online access\nbased on economic and social variables. Researchers also face\nrecruitment challenges due to online subjects’ potential\nanonymity, especially as it relates to the frequent use of pseudonyms\nonline, having multiple or alternative identities online, and the\ngeneral challenges of verifying a subject’s age and demographic\ninformation. Moreover, basic ethical principles for approaching and\nrecruiting participants involve protecting their privacy and\nconfidentiality. Internet research can both maximize these\nprotections, as an individual may never be known beyond a screen name\nor avatar existence; or, conversely, the use of IP addresses,\nplacement of cookies, availability and access to more information than\nnecessary for the research purposes, may minimize the protections of\nprivacy and confidentiality. \nMuch recruitment is taking place via social media; examples include\npush technologies, a synchronous approach in which a text or tweet is\nsent from a researcher to potential participants based on profile\ndata, platform activity, or geolocation. Other methods of pull\ntechnologies recruitment include direct email, dedicated web pages,\nYouTube videos, direct solicitation via “stickies” posted\non fora or web sites directing participants to a study site, or data\naggregation or scraping data for potential recruitment. Regardless of\nthe means used, researchers must follow the terms of the\nsite—from the specific norms and nuances governing a site or\nlocale to the legal issues in terms of service agreements. For\nexample, early pro-anorexia web sites (see Overbeke 2008) were often\ntreated as sensitive spaces deserving spcicial consideration, and\nresearchers were asked to respect the privacy of the participants and\nnot engage in research (Walstrom 2004). In the gaming context,\nReynolds and de Zwart (2010) ask: \nHas the researcher disclosed the fact that he or she is engaged in\nresearch and is observing/interacting with other players for the\npurposes of gathering research data? How does the research project\nimpact upon the community and general game play? Is the research\nproject permitted under the Terms of Service? \nColvin and Lanigan (2005: 38) suggest researchers \nSeek permission from Web site owners and group moderators before\nposting recruitment announcements, Then, preface the recruitment\nannouncement with a statement that delineates the permission that has\nbeen granted, including the contact person and date received. Identify\na concluding date (deadline) for the research study and make every\neffort to remove recruitment postings, which often become embedded\nwithin Web site postings. \nBarratt and Lenton, among others, agree: \nIt is critical, therefore, to form partnerships with online community\nmoderators by not only asking their permission to post the request,\nbut eliciting their feedback and support as well (2010: 71). \nMendelson (2007) and Smith and Leigh (1997) note that recruitment\nnotices need to contain more information than the typical flyers or\nadvertisements used for newspaper advertisements. Mentioning the\napproval of moderators is important for establishing authenticity, and\nso is providing detailed information about the study and how to\ncontact both the researchers and the appropriate research ethics\nboard. \nGiven the array of techniques possible for recruitment, the concept of\n“research spam” requires attention. The Council of\nAmerican Survey Research warns \nResearch Organizations should take steps to limit the number of survey\ninvitations sent to targeted respondents by email solicitations or\nother methods over the Internet so as to avoid harassment and response\nbias caused by the repeated recruitment and participation by a given\npool (or panel) of data subjects (CASRO 2011: I.B.3). \nUltimately, researchers using Internet recruitment measures must\nensure that potential participants are getting enough information in\nboth the recruitment materials and any subsequent consent documents.\nResearchers must ensure that recruitment methods do not lead to an\nindividual being identified without their permission, and if such\nidentification is possible, are there significant risks involved? \nAs the cornerstone of human subjects protections, informed consent\nmeans that participants are voluntarily participating in the research\nwith adequate knowledge of relevant risks and benefits. Providing\ninformed consent typically includes the researcher explaining the\npurpose of the research, the methods being used, the possible outcomes\nof the research, as well as associated risks or harms that the\nparticipants might face. The process involves providing the recipient\nclear and understandable explanations of these issues in a concise\nway, providing sufficient opportunity to consider them and enquire\nabout any aspect of the research prior to granting consent, and\nensuring the subject has not been coerced into participating. Gaining\nconsent in traditional research is typically done verbally or in\nwriting, either in a face-to-face meeting where the researcher reviews\nthe document, through telephone scripts, through mailed documents,\nfax, or video, and can be obtained with the assistance of an advocate\nin the case of vulnerable populations. Most importantly, informed\nconsent was built on the ideal of “process” and the\nverification of understanding, and thus, requires an ongoing\ncommunicative relationship between and among researchers and their\nparticipants. The emergence of the Internet as both a tool and a venue\nfor research has introduced challenges to this traditional approach to\ninformed consent. \nIn most regulatory frameworks, there are instances when informed\nconsent might be waived, or the standard processes of obtaining\ninformed consent might be modified, if approved by a research ethics\n board.[5]\n Various forms of Internet research require different approaches to\nthe consent process. Some standards have emerged, depending on venue\n(i.e., an online survey platform versus a private Facebook group).\nHowever, researchers are encouraged to consider waiver of consent\nand/or documentation, if appropriate, by using the flexibilities of\ntheir extant regulations. \nWhere consent is required but documentation has been waived by an\nethical review board, a “portal” can be used to provide\nconsent information. For example, a researcher may send an email to\nthe participant with a link a separate portal or site information page\nwhere information on the project is contained. The participant can\nread the documentation and click on an “I agree”\nsubmission. Rosser et al. (2010) recommend using a\n“chunked” consent document, whereby individuals can read\nspecific sections, agree, and then continue onwards to completion of\nthe consent form, until reaching the study site. \nIn addition to portals, researchers will often make use of consent\ncards or tokens; this alleviates concerns that unannounced researcher\npresence is unacceptable, or, that a researcher’s presence is\nintrusive to the natural flow and movement of a given locale. Hudson\nand Bruckman (2004, 2005) highlighted the unique challenges in gaining\nconsent in chat rooms, while Lawson (2004) offers an array of consent\npossibilities for synchronous computer-mediated communication. There\nare different practical challenges in the consent process in Internet\nresearch, given the fluidity and temporal nature of Internet\nspaces. \nIf documentation of consent is required, some researchers have\nutilized alternatives such as electronic signatures, which can range\nfrom a simple electronic check box to acknowledge acceptance of the\nterms to more robust means of validation using encrypted digital\nsignatures, although the validity of electronic signatures vary by\njurisdiction. \nRegardless of venue, informed consent documents are undergoing changes\nin the information provided to research participants. While the basic\nelements of consent remain intact, researchers must now acknowledge\nwith less certainty specific aspects of their data longevity, risks to\nprivacy, confidentiality and anonymity (see\n §4.1 Privacy, above),\n and access to or ownership of data. Research participants must\nunderstand that their terms of service or end user license agreement\nconsent is distinct from their consent to participate in research.\nAnd, researchers must address and inform participants/subjects about\npotential risk of data intrusion or misappropriation of data if\nsubsequently made public or available outside of the confines of the\noriginal research. Statements should be revised to reflect such\nrealities as cloud storage (see\n §4.4 below)\n and data sharing. \nFor example, Aycock et al. (2012: 141) describe a continuum of\nsecurity and access statements used in informed consent documents: \nThis use of encryption in the last statement may be necessary in\nresearch including sensitive data, such as medical, sexual, health,\nfinancial, and so on. Barratt and Lenton (2010), in their research on\nillicit drug use and online forum behaviors, also provide guidance\nabout use of secure transmission and encryption as part of the consent\nprocess. \nIn addition to informing participants about potential risks and employing technological protections, NIH-funded researchers whose work includes projects with identifiable, sensitive information will automatically be issued a Certificate of Confidentiality: \nCoCs protect the privacy of research subjects by prohibiting\ndisclosure of identifiable, sensitive research information to anyone\nnot connected to the research except when the subject consents or in a\nfew other specific situations (NIH 2017\n [OIR]). \nHowever, these do not protect against release of data outside of the\nU.S. Given the reality of Internet research itself, which inherently\nspans borders, new models may be in order to ensure confidentiality of\ndata and protections of data. Models of informed consent for\ntraditional international research are fundamentally challenging due\nto cultural specificity and norms (Annas 2009; Boga et al. 2011;\nKrogstad et al. 2010); with Internet research, where researchers may\nbe unaware of the specific location of an individual, consent takes on\nsignificantly higher demands. While current standards of practice show\nthat consent models stem from the jurisdiction of the researcher and\nsponsoring research institution, complications arise in the face of\nage verification, age of majority/consent, reporting of adverse\neffects or complaints with the research process, and authentication of\nidentity. Various jurisdictional laws around privacy are relevant for\nthe consent process; a useful tool is Forrester’s Data Privacy\nHeat Map, which relies on in-depth analyses of the data\nprivacy-related laws and cultures of countries around the world,\nhelping researchers design appropriate approaches to privacy and data\nprotection given the particular context (see\n OIR). \nIn addition, as more federal agencies and funding bodies across the\nglobe encourage making research data publicly-available (i.e., NSF,\nNIH, Wellcome Trust, Research Councils U.K.), the language used in\nconsent documents will change accordingly to represent this intended\nlongevity of data and opportunities for future, unanticipated use.\nGiven the ease with which Internet data can flow between and among\nInternet venues, changes in the overall accessibility of data might\noccur (early “private” newsgroup conversations were made\n“publicly searchable” when Google bought DejaNews), and\nreuse and access by others is increasingly possible with shared\ndatasets. Current data sharing mandates must be considered in the\nconsent process. Alignment between a data sharing policy and an\ninformed consent document is imperative. Both should include\nprovisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality,\nsecurity, and intellectual property. \nThere is general agreement in the U.S. that individual consent is not\nnecessary for researchers to use publicly available data, such as\npublic Twitter feeds. Recommendations were made by The National Human\nSubjects Protection Advisory Committee (NHRPAC) in 2002 regarding\npublicly available data sets (see\n OIR).\n Data use or data restriction agreements are commonly used and set the\nparameters of use for researchers. \nThe U.K. Data Archive\n (2011 [OIR])\n provides guidance on consent and data sharing: \nWhen research involves obtaining data from people, researchers are\nexpected to maintain high ethical standards such as those recommended\nby professional bodies, institutions and funding organisations, both\nduring research and when sharing data. Research data — even\nsensitive and confidential data — can be shared ethically and\nlegally if researchers pay attention, from the beginning of research,\nto three important aspects: \n\n• when gaining informed consent, include provision for data\nsharing \n\n• where needed, protect people’s identities by anonymising\ndata \n\n• consider controlling access to data These measures should be\nconsidered jointly. The same measures form part of good research\npractice and data management, even if data sharing is not envisioned.\nData collected from and about people may hold personal, sensitive or\nconfidential information. This does not mean that all data obtained by\nresearch with participants are personal or confidential. \nData sharing made public headlines in 2016 when a Danish researcher\nreleased a data set comprised of scraped data from nearly 70,000 users\nof the OkCupid online dating site. The data set was highly\nreidentifiable and included potentially sensitive information,\nincluding usernames, age, gender, geographic location, what kind of\nrelationship (or sex) they’re interested in, personality traits,\nand answers to thousands of profiling questions used by the site. The\nresearcher claimed the data were public and thus, such sharing and use\nwas unproblematic. Zimmer (2016) was among many privacy and ethics\nscholars who critiqued this stance. \nThe Danish researchers did not seek any form of consent or debriefing\non the collection and use of the data, nor did they have any ethics\noversight. Many researchers and ethics boards are, however, attempting\nto mitigate some of these ethical concerns by including blanket\nstatements in their consent processes, indicating such precautions for\nresearch participants. For example, \nI understand that online communications may be at greater risk for\nhacking, intrusions, and other violations. Despite these\npossibilities, I consent to participate. \nA more specific example comes from the Canadian context when\nresearchers propose to use specific online survey tools hosted in the\nUnited States; REBs commonly recommend the following type language for\nuse in informed consent documents: \nPlease note that the online survey is hosted by Company ABC which is a\nweb survey company located in the U.S.A. All responses to the survey\nwill be stored and accessed in the U.S.A. This company is subject to\nU.S. Laws, in particular, to the U.S. Patriot Act/Domestic Security\nEnhancement Act that allows authorities access to the records that\nyour responses to the questions will be stored and accessed in the\nU.S.A. The security and private policy for Company ABC can be viewed\nat\n http://…/.[6] \nResearchers are also encouraged to review the Terms of Use and Terms\nof Service of the application that are being used, demonstrating its\ndetails to the REB in the application and informing participants of\nsuch details in the informed consent form or script. Researchers are\nalso encouraged to consider broader contextual factors of the data\nsource and research goals when weighing the possible violation of a\nplatform’s Terms of Service (Fiesler, Beard, & Keegan\n2020). \nInternet research poses particular challenges to age verification,\nassent and consent procedures, and appropriate methodological\napproaches with minors. Age of consent varies across countries,\nstates, communities, and locales of all sorts. For research conducted\nor supported by U.S. federal agencies bound by the Common Rule,\nchildren are \npersons who have not attained the legal age for consent [18, in the\nU.S.] to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the\napplicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be\nconducted (45 C.F.R. § 46.402(a) 2009). \nGoldfarb (2008) provides an exhaustive discussion of age of majority\nacross the U.S. states, with a special focus on clinical\nresearch, noting children must be seven or older to assent to\nparticipation (see 45 C.F.R. § 46 Subpart D 2009). \nSpriggs (2010), from the Australian context, notes that while no\nformal guidance exists on Internet research and minors under the\nNational Statement, she advises: \nTo assist with the consent process, age verification measures can be\nused. These can range from more technical software applications to\nless formal knowledge checks embedded in an information sheet or\nconsent document. Multiple confirmation points (asking for age, later\nasking for year of birth, etc.) are practical measures for\nresearchers. Depending on the types of data, sensitivity of data, use\nof data, researchers and boards will carefully construct the\nappropriate options for consent, including waiver of consent, waiver\nof documentation, and/or waiver of parental consent. \nRecent developments in cloud computing platforms have led to unique\nopportunities—and ethical challenges—for researchers.\nCloud computing describes the deployment of computing resources via\nthe Internet, providing on-demand, flexible, and scalable computing\nfrom remote locations. Examples include web-based email and\ncalendaring services provided by Google or Yahoo, online productivity\nplatforms like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365, online file\nstorage and sharing platforms like Dropbox or Box.net, and large-scale\napplication development and data processing platforms such as Google\nApps, Facebook Developers Platform, and Amazon Web Services. \nAlongside businesses and consumers, researchers have begun utilizing\ncloud computing platforms and services to assist in various tasks,\nincluding subject recruitment, data collection and storage,\nlarge-scale data processing, as well as communication and\ncollaboration (Allan 2011\n [OIR];\n X. Chen et al. 2010\n [OIR]);\n Simmhan et al. 2008; Simmhan et al. 2009). \nAs reliance on cloud computing increases among researchers, so do the\nethical implications. Among the greatest concerns is ensuring data\nprivacy and security with cloud-based services. For researchers\nsharing datasets online for collaborative processing and analysis,\nsteps must be taken to ensure only authorized personnel have access to\nthe online data that might contain PII, but also that suitable\nencryption is used for data transfer and storage, and that the cloud\nservice provider maintains sufficient security to prevent breaches.\nFurther, once research data is uploaded to a third-party cloud\nprovider, attention must be paid to the terms of service for the\ncontracted provider to determine what level of access to the data, if\nany, might be allowed to advertisers, law enforcement, or other\nexternal agents. \nAlongside the privacy and security concerns, researchers also have an\nethical duty of data stewardship which is further complicated when\nresearch data is placed in the cloud for storage or processing. Cloud\nproviders might utilize data centers spread across the globe, meaning\nresearch data might be located outside the United States, and its\nlegal jurisdictions. Terms of service might grant cloud providers a\nlicense to access and use research data for purposes not initially\nintended or approved of by the subjects involved. Stewardship may\nrequire the prompt and complete destruction of research data, a\nmeasure complicated if a cloud provider has distributed and backed-up\nthe data across multiple locations. \nA more unique application of cloud computing for research involves the\ncrowdsourcing of data analysis and processing functions, that is,\nleveraging the thousands of users of various online products and\nservices to complete research related tasks remotely. Examples include\nusing a distributed network of video game players to assist in solving\nprotein folding problems (Markoff 2010), and leveraging Amazon’s\nMechanical Turk crowdsourcing marketplace platform to assist with\nlarge scale data processing and coding functions that cannot be\nautomated (Conley & Tosti-Kharas 2014; J. Chen et al. 2011). Using\ncloud-based platforms can raise various critical ethical and\nmethodological issues. \nFirst, new concerns over data privacy and security emerge when\nresearch tasks are widely distributed across a global network of\nusers. Researchers must take great care in ensuring research data\ncontaining personal or sensitive information isn’t accessible by\noutsourced labor, or that none of the users providing crowdsourced\nlabor are able to aggregate and store their own copy of the research\ndataset. Second, crowdsourcing presents ethical concerns over trust\nand validity of the research process itself. Rather than a local team\nof research assistants usually under a principal investigator’s\nsupervision and control, crowdsourcing tends to be distributed beyond\nthe direct management or control of the researcher, providing less\nopportunity to ensure sufficient training for the required tasks.\nThus, researchers will need to create additional means of verifying\ndata results to confirm tasks are completed properly and\ncorrectly. \nTwo additional ethical concerns with crowdsourcing involve labor\nmanagement and authorship. Mechanical Turk users were not originally\nintended to be research subjects, first and foremost. However,\nresearchers using Mechanical Turks must ensure that the laborers on\nthe other end of the cloud-based relationship are not being exploited,\nthat they are legally eligible to be working for hire, and that the\nincentives provided are real, meaningful, and appropriate (Scholz\n2008; Williams 2010\n [OIR). \nFinally, at the end of a successful research project utilizing\ncrowdsourcing, a researcher may be confronted with the ethical\nchallenge of how to properly acknowledge the contributions made by\n(typically anonymous) laborers. Ethical research requires the fair and\naccurate description of authorship. Disciplines vary as to how to\nreport relative contributions made by collaborators and research\nassistants, and this dilemma increases when crowdsourcing is used to\nassist with the research project. \nAlgorithmic processing is a corollary of big data research, and\nnewfound ethical considerations have emerged. From “algorithmic\nharms” to “predictive analytics”, the power of\ntoday’s algorithms exceeds long-standing privacy beliefs and\nnorms. Specifically, the National Science and Technology Council\nnote: \nWhile the concept of big data is not new, and the term has been in\ntechnical discourses since the 1990s, public awareness and response to\nbig data research is much more recent. Following the rise of social\nmedia-based research, Buchanan (2016) has delineated the emergence of\n“big data”-based research from 2012 to the present, with\nno signs of an endpoint. \nBig data research is challenging for research ethics boards, often\npresenting what the computer ethicist James Moor would call\n“conceptual muddles”: the inability to properly\nconceptualize the ethical values and dilemmas at play in a new\ntechnological context. Subject privacy, for example, is typically\nprotected within the context of research ethics through a combination\nof various tactics and practices, including engaging in data\ncollection under controlled or anonymous environments, limiting the\npersonal information gathered, scrubbing data to remove or obscure\npersonally identifiable information, and using access restrictions and\nrelated data security methods to prevent unauthorized access and use\nof the research data itself. The nature and understanding of privacy\nbecome muddled, however, in the context of big data research, and as a\nresult, ensuring it is respected and protected in this new domain\nbecomes challenging. \nFor example, the determination of what constitutes “private\ninformation”—and thus triggering particular privacy\nconcerns—becomes difficult within the context of big data\nresearch. Distinctions within the regulatory definition of\n“private information”—namely, that it only applies\nto information which subjects reasonably expect is not normally\nmonitored or collected and not normally publicly\navailable—become less clearly applicable when considering the\ndata environments and collection practices that typify big data\nresearch, such as the wholesale scraping of Facebook news feed content\nor public OKCupid accounts. \nWhen considered through the lens of the regulatory definition of\n“private information”, social media postings are often\nconsidered public, especially when users take no visible, affirmative\nsteps to restrict access. As a result, big data researchers might\nconclude subjects are not deserving of particular privacy\nconsideration. Yet, the social media platforms frequently used for big\ndata research purposes represent a complex environment of\nsocio-technical interactions, where users often fail to understand\nfully how their social activities might be regularly monitored,\nharvested, and shared with third parties, where privacy policies and\nterms of service are not fully understood and change frequently, and\nwhere the technical infrastructures and interfaces are designed to\nmake restricting information flows and protecting one’s privacy\ndifficult. \nAs noted\n in §4.1 above\n it becomes difficult to confirm a user’s intention when sharing\ninformation on a social media platform, and whether users recognize\nthat providing information in a social environment also opens it up\nfor widespread harvesting and use by researchers. This uncertainty in\nthe intent and expectations of users of social media and\ninternet-based platforms—often fueled by the design of the\nplatforms themselves—create numerous conceptual muddles in our\nability to properly alleviate potential privacy concerns in big data\nresearch. \nThe conceptual gaps that exist regarding privacy and the definition of\npersonally identifiable information in the context of big data\nresearch inevitably lead to similar gaps regarding when informed\nconsent is necessary. Researchers mining Facebook profile information\nor public Twitter streams, for example, typically argue that no\nspecific consent is necessary due to the fact the information was\npublicly available. It remains unknown whether users truly understood\nthe technical conditions under which they made information visible on\nthese social media platforms or if they foresaw their data being\nharvested for research purposes, rather than just appearing onscreen\nfor fleeting glimpses by their friends and followers (Fiesler &\nProferes, 2018). In the case of the Facebook emotional contagion\nexperiment (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock 2014), the lack of\nobtaining consent was initially rationalized through the notion that\nthe research appeared to have been carried out under Facebook’s\nextensive terms of service, whose data use policy, while more than\n9,000 words long, does make passing mention to “research”.\nIt was later revealed, however, that the data use policy in effect\nwhen the experiment was conducted never mentioned\n“research” at all (Hill 2014). \nAdditional ethical concerns have arisen surrounding the large scale\ndata collection practices connected to machine learning and the\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence. For example, negative public\nattention have surrounded algorithms designed to infer sexual\norientation from photographs and facial recognition algorithms trained\non videos of transgender people. In both cases, ethical concerns have\nbeen raised about both the purpose of these algorithms and the fact\nthat the data that trained them (dating profile photos and YouTube\nvideos, respectively) was “public” but collected from\npotentially vulnerable populations without consent (Metcalf 2017;\nKeyes 2019). While those building AI systems cannot always control the\nconditions under which the data they utilize is collected, their\nincreased use of big datasets captured from social media or related\nsources raises a number of concerns beyond what typically is\nconsidered part of the growing focus on AI ethics: fairness,\naccountability and transparency in AI can only be fully possible when\ndata collection is achieved in a fair, ethical, and just manner (Stahl\n& Wright 2018; Kerry 2020). \nThe Facebook emotional contagion experiment, discussed above, is just\none example in a larger trend of big data research conducted outside\nof traditional university-based research ethics oversight mechanisms.\nNearly all online companies and platforms analyze data and test\ntheories that often rely on data from individual users. Industry-based\ndata research, once limited to marketing-oriented “A/B\ntesting” of benign changes in interface designs or corporate\ncommunication messages, now encompasses information about how users\nbehave online, what they click and read, how they move, eat, and\nsleep, the content they consume online, and even how they move about\ntheir homes. Such research produces inferences about\nindividuals’ tastes and preferences, social relations,\ncommunications, movements, and work habits. It implies pervasive\ntesting of products and services that are an integral part of intimate\ndaily life, ranging from connected home products to social networks to\nsmart cars. Except in cases where they are partnering with academic\ninstitutions, companies typically do not put internal research\nactivities through a formal ethical review process, since results are\ntypically never shared publicly and the perceived impact on users is\nminimal. \nThe growth of industry-based big data research, however, presents new\nrisks to individuals’ privacy, on the one hand, and to\norganizations’ legal compliance, reputation, and brand, on the\nother hand. When organizations process personal data outside of their\noriginal context, individuals may in some cases greatly benefit, but\nin other cases may be surprised, outraged, or even harmed. Soliciting\nconsent from affected individuals can be impractical: Organizations\nmight collect data indirectly or based on identifiers that do not\ndirectly match individuals’ contact details. Moreover, by\ndefinition, some non-contextual uses—including the retention of\ndata for longer than envisaged for purposes of a newly emergent\nuse—may be unforeseen at the time of collection. As Crawford and\nSchultz (2014) note, \nhow does one give notice and get consent for innumerable and perhaps\neven yet-to-be-determined queries that one might run that create\n“personal data”? (2014: 108) \nWith corporations developing vast “living laboratories”\nfor big data research, research ethics has become a critical component\nof the design and oversight of these activities. For example, in\nresponse to the controversy surrounding the emotional contagion\nexperiment, Facebook developed an internal ethical review process\nthat, according to its facilitators, \nleverages the company’s organizational structure, creating\nmultiple training opportunities and research review checkpoints in the\nexisting organizational flow (Jackman & Kanerva 2016: 444). \nWhile such efforts are important and laudable, they remain open for\nimprovement. Hoffmann (2016), for example, has criticized Facebook for\nlaunching \nan ethics review process that innovates on process but tells us little\nabout the ethical values informing their product development. \nFurther, in their study of employees doing the work of ethics inside\nof numerous Silicon Valley companies, Metcalf and colleagues found\nconsiderable tension between trying to resolve thorny ethical dilemmas\nthat emerge within an organization’s data practices and the\nbroader business model and corporate logic that dominates internal\ndecision-making (Metcalf, Moss, & boyd 2019). \nWhile many researchers and review boards across the world work without\nformal guidance, many research ethics boards have developed guidelines\nfor Internet research. While many such guidelines exist, the following\nprovides examples for researchers preparing for an REB review, or for\nboards developing their own policies. \nAdditional resources are found in\n Other Internet Resources\n below.","contact.mail":"michael.zimmer@marquette.edu","contact.domain":"marquette.edu"}]
