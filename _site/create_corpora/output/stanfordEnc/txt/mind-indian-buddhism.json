While Buddhists share with other \nIndian philosophers the view that the domain of the mental \nencompasses a set of interrelated faculties and processes, they do \nnot associate mental phenomena with the activity of a substantial, \nindependent, and enduring self or agent. Rather, Buddhist theories of\nmind center on the doctrine of\n not-self[1]\n (Pāli anatta, \n Skt.[2]anātma), which postulates that human beings are \nreducible to the physical and psychological constituents and \nprocesses which comprise them.\n\n\n\nIndian Buddhist analyses of the mind span a period of some fifteen\ncenturies, from the earliest discourses of the Buddha (ca. 450 B.C.E.)\nto the systematic developments of late Mahāyāna Buddhism\n(500–1000 C.E.). Although philosophical accounts of mind emerge\nonly within the Abhidharma scholastic traditions (roughly 150\nB.C.E. to 450 C.E.), their roots are found in the Buddha's teachings\nof the not-self doctrine. At the same time, these accounts parallel\nsimilar theoretical developments within the Brahmanical traditions,\nwith which they share a common philosophical vocabulary (and a general\nview of mental processes as hierarchical and discrete). This article\nfocuses on the picture of mind and mental phenomena that emerges from\nthe canonical literature, the theories of mind advanced by the main\nAbhidharma scholastic traditions, and the epistemological issues of\nperception and intentionality debated by philosophers such as\nVasubandhu, Dignāga, Dharmakīrti, Candrakīrti,\nŚāntarakṣita, and Dharmottara.\n\n\n\nAll references to the canonical literature are to the major \ncollections of texts in the Pāli Canon, primarily to the \nLong, Middle, and Connected Discourses of \nthe Buddha (the Dīgha, Majjhima, and \nSaṃyutta Nikāyas respectively). For the\nAbhidharmic account of mind and related phenomena I draw almost\nexclusively from Vasubandhu's Treasury of Higher Knowledge\n(Abhidharmakośa and its bhāṣya;\nhereafter AKBh), a foundational text for most of the philosophical\ndevelopments of late Indian Buddhism. For other frequently quoted\nsources see\n §3.1,\n §6.3,\n §7\n and the \n list of abbreviations.\n \n\n\n\nBuddhist conceptions of mind evolved from early attempts to offer a \nsystematic account of human experience as described in the large body\nof discourses attributed to the Buddha. The Buddha offered an account\nof the human individual as a composite of various psychological and \nphysical elements that challenged the prevailing philosophical views,\ndominated by the Upaniṣadic idea of an enduring, substantive \nself (ātman). This aggregated view of persons became \nthe object of early and extensive scholastic debates as Buddhists \nsought to explain how we come to mistakenly apprehend an unchanging \nand enduring self in a stream of causally interconnected phenomena. \nThe notion that the habitual patterns of behavior which condition \nhuman existence are the direct result of an entrenched and abiding \nbelief that we are (or have) an enduring, unchanging, and independent\ncore or self, sets this aggregated view of persons apart from all \nother philosophical accounts of personal identity in classical India.\n \n\nIn one of his earlier discourses, the Buddha declares that we ought \nto regard any form of sensation and consciousness, whether \n“past, future, or present; internal or external; manifest or \nsubtle...as it actually is...: ‘This is not mine. This is not \nmy self. This is not what I am’” (Majjhima \nNikāya I, 130). \n\nThis rejection of a permanent self as the agent of sensory and mental\nactivity posed a significant challenge for the early Buddhists.\nIndeed, if there is no agent (kartṛ), and if actions\n(karman) are merely transient events arising within a\ncontinuum of causally interconnected states, then how is the efficacy\nof karma or rebirth to be explained? Historically, at least one\nBuddhist school, that of the Vātsīputrīyas or\nPudgalavādins (‘personalists’), does appear to\nendorse the reality of persons as conceived in reliance upon the\ncollection of aggregates (see\n §5.5\n for a detailed discussion).  \n\nDisagreement among modern interpreters of the not-self doctrine attests to\nthe difficulty of providing a definitive account of this core aspect \nof Buddhist philosophy. Thus, the early Pāli scholar Caroline \nRhys Davids (1924, 75) thought that the way Buddhists understood \nand used the term consciousness was not very different that the way \nUpaniṣadic philosophers talked about the self. Similarly, \nIsaline Horner (1936, 145) suggested that some canonical passages \n(e.g., Anguttara Nikāya I, 149–50) actually \nprovide support for the notion of self as an ‘unchanging \nwitness’ (Pāli sakkhi, Skt. \nsākṣin), a view also defended in a recent \nphilosophical reworking of the notion of ‘witness \nconsciousness’ by Miri Albahari (2006). Although he \nacknowledged the confusion generated by the tendency to attribute to \nearly Buddhism something analogous to the Upaniṣadic doctrine \nof self, Edward Conze nonetheless asserted that one's true identity \nis that of an Absolute, which he presumed to be none other than the \nBuddhist view of consciousness (1962, pp. 43, 127). Perhaps the most \ndetailed attempt to support a two-tier understanding of the doctrine \nof not-self comes from Kamaleswar Bhattacharya (1973, 64 and \npassim), who forcibly argued that the denial of self in \nBuddhism most often targets common views such as those that associate\nthe self with the psycho-physical aggregates, and not the \nmetaphysical notion of self.  \n\nThe prevailing view, however, is that such interpretations are \ntenuous. Indeed, later Buddhist traditions develop specific \nnotions, such as that of mind-stream, life-continuum mind, and \nrepository consciousness (citta-santāna, \nbhavaṅga-citta, and \nālaya-vijñāna, respectively) precisely in\norder to avoid the metaphysical implications of the traditional notion\nof self. Extensive critiques of the attempt to find support in the\ncanonical literature for the existence of a higher self, perhaps\nequated with consciousness, are found in Warder (1970), Collins\n(1982), Kalupahana (1987), Harvey (1995), and De Silva (2005).\nVasubandhu’s Treatise on the Negation of the Person\n(Pudgala-pratiṣedha-prakaraṇa, which forms the\n9th chapter of his Abhidharmakośa) provides one of most\ndetailed Buddhist critiques of the personalist view (also targeting\nBrahmanical conceptions of self) (see  §5.5).\n  \n\nThus Harvey (1995, 22) argues that the notion of a ‘self which\nwitnesses’ most probably refers to deeper aspects of\nconsciousness (citta) acting as ‘conscience.’ In\na similar vein, Collins (1982, 87–115) delineates several points\nsupporting the not-self view as the correct account: (1) the\nmetaphysical notion of self as eternal and unchanging is actually just\nplain erroneous (a defect of speculative opinion); (2) taking the body\nto be the self is a mistaken view; (3) consciousness itself is not the\nself; (4) it is impossible to speak of a self apart from experience;\n(5) a false sense of self may be acquired from the habitual use of\npronominal forms such as ‘I’ and ‘mine.’\nFurthermore, in his detailed and thorough analysis of Buddhist and\nBrahmanical views on personal identity, Oetke (1988) interprets the\nnot-self doctrine as reflective of a “revisionary” metaphysics which\ndenies not a self as such but rather the self as something qualified\nby the property of being the subject of experience or as the referent\nof such subjective experience.  The denial of a permanent self, as well as the refusal to treat \npersons as referring to anything real and permanent, forms an \nintegral part of the Buddhist analysis of consciousness. The frequent\nuse of indexicals such as ‘I’ (ahaṃ) and \n‘mine’ (mama) does not indicate that the Buddha \naccepts the conventional reality of persons either. Rather, as \nCollins (1982, 72) suggests, a good way to avoid such \nmisapprehensions is to offer more elegant translations of Pāli \nand Sanskrit compounds in which the term self (atta, \nātma) is used. For instance, ‘master of \nhimself’ (attādhīna) could be also rendered \nas ‘free’ or ‘independent,’ ‘at peace \nwith himself’ (khematta) could be translated as \n‘tranquil,’ while ‘self-guarded’ \n(rakkhitatta) could be simply translated as \n‘prudent’. \n\nThe centrality of the not-self doctrine in Buddhist thought is \nexplained on the basis of its pragmatic role in guiding the adept on \nthe path to enlightenment. Furthermore, the \nnot-self doctrine provides a justification for treating endurance, \nindependence, and self-subsistence as neither desirable nor \nattainable, but rather as what they are: mistaken notions resulting \nfrom the habitual tendency to construct an identity from a stream of \nphysical and subjective phenomena. The Buddhist claims that our sense\nof self as an autonomous being is imputed, and our attribution of \ninherent existence to it habitually acquired (see Saṃyutta \nNikāya IV, 102; Majjhima Nikāya I, 130), just\nas Hume claims that a self is never apprehended in the series of \nperceptions that are characteristic of the mental domain (the \nparallelism between the Buddhist and Humean reductive analyses of the\nself is explored at some lenght in Giles 1993, Tillemans 1996, \nand Kapstein 2001). This routine misapprehension of the discrete \nphenomena of experience as a self leads to a dualistic perspective: \nthings appear and are categorized as either objective (thus external,\nbut empirically accessible) or as subjective (thus internal, and \nimmediately accessible to consciousness). Puzzled by this dualistic \noutlook, we cope by constructing an imaginary self as the permanent \nlocus of experience.  \n\nThis imaginary self, usually conceived in substantial terms as an\nunchanging reality behind the changing phenomenal world, is in effect\nthe root cause of the pervasive ignorance which afflicts the human\ncondition. From a metaphysical point of view, however, the not-self\ndoctrine extends beyond the domain of subjective experience, to\ncharacterize all phenomena. Indeed, it is not just persons that are\nsaid to be selfless but all the elements of existence as well. To\nappreciate the uniqueness of the Buddhist not-self doctrine scholars\nsometimes contrast it with the two most common alternatives:\neternalism and annihilationism (or physicalism). The eternalist,\nusually the Upaniṣadic philosopher, claims that the innermost\npart of ourselves, the subtle and abiding self, sometimes equated with\npure consciousness, exists for all eternity even as the ordinary\nperson undergoes constant change, ultimately resulting in his or her\ndemise. At the opposite end of the spectrum we find the physicalist\nwho sees human nature as contingent and finite.  The Buddhist\nperspective, called the ‘middle path between extremes’ or\nsimply the ‘middle way’ (madhyamā-pratipad)\noffers a very different account of human existence: what we routinely\ncall ego, self, soul, individual personality, are merely conventional\nterms that do not apply to anything real. \n\nIn espousing the doctrine of not-self with its aggregated view of \npersons, the Buddha claims to be offering a solution to the problem \nof human suffering. Not only is the idea of a permanent self a \nconceptual fiction, but adopting such a view leads to grasping after \nnotions such as ‘I,’ ‘me,’ and \n‘mine’ with deleterious effects for our psychological \nwell being: attachment to such a fictional ‘I’ is the \nroot cause of a range of negative emotions, including selfishness, \ncraving, hatred, conceit, and ill-will. These negative emotions, in \nturn, fuel the general feeling of unsatisfactoriness that pervades \nthe unenlightened human condition, and ultimately are responsible for\nall the troubles that ordinarily afflict our world. The not-self \ndoctrine offers not merely an enlightened metaphysical perspective on\nthe ultimate nature of things, but also an effective remedy for \neradicating ignorance and achieving nirvāṇa, the \nsummum bonum of the Buddhist path and the antithesis of \ncyclical existence (with the caveat that Mahāyāna Buddhist \ntraditions generally place less emphasis on \nnirvāṇa, focusing instead on the enlightened and \ncompassionate attitude of the Buddhist saint or \n‘bodhisattva’). \n\nIn his first public discourse, known as the Turning of the Wheel \nof Dharma (Pāli Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, SN \n56, 11), Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha, lays out what is \nconsidered to be the foundation of Buddhist doctrine and practice: \nthe middle path approach to understanding the nature of phenomena. At\nthe level of affect the middle path steers clear of the extremes of \nindulgence and austerity, while at the mental level it avoids the \nextreme metaphysical positions of eternalism and annihilationism. \nThus, the middle path “leads to insight and wisdom, produces \ncalm, knowledge, enlightenment, and \nnirvāṇa” (Saṃyutta \nNikāya, V, 420). Following his exposition of the middle \npath, the Buddha proceeds to outline the four noble truths and the \neightfold noble path, which together represent the most basic aspects\nof Buddhist teachings. The middle path, thus, is intended both as an \nethical method and as a primer for correct reasoning. In this second \nsense, the middle path relies on a particular understanding the \nnature of reality as being marked by, or displaying, three specific \ncharacteristics (tri-lakṣaṇa): \nunsatisfactoriness (duḥkha), impermanence \n(anitya), and the lack of an abiding self \n(anātman).  \n\nThe general leitmotif of Buddhist teachings, which is also the first \nof the four noble truths, is the realization that unsatisfactoriness \nor suffering (Skt. duḥkha, Pāli dukkha) \nis a pervasive aspect of conditioned existence. With the recognition \nof this fundamental truth about the nature of phenomena comes the \nrealization of the cause of discontent and of its finality (the \nsecond and third noble truths, respectively). Lastly, undertaking the\ncourse of action that leads to its cessation (the fourth noble truth)\nforms the basis and the main motivating principle of the Buddhist \npath.  \n\n1. Unsatisfactoriness (duḥkha). As the first mark of \nconditioned existence, unsatisfactoriness presents both an \nopportunity and a challenge: as an undesirable condition, \nunsatisfactoriness itself is a motivator for its own overcoming. But \nwithout a proper understanding of its root cause, unsatisfactoriness \ncan become a source of aversion (toward unpleasant states) and of \ngrasping (after pleasant states). The cause of this \nunsatisfactoriness is ignorance (avidyā), understood \nnot simply as lacking knowledge about particular states of affairs, \nbut rather as a basic misunderstanding about how things truly are. \nThe Buddhist Abhidharma traditions break this unsatisfactoriness into\nthree categories:  \n\n2. Impermanence (anitya). As the second mark of existence,\nimpermanence pervades all compounded phenomena. It forms an integral\npart of the theory of momentariness\n(kṣaṇikavāda), which asserts that phenomena\ndo not endure for more than a moment. In the Shorter Discourse to\nSaccaka (Majjhima Nikāya, I, 230, 35), the Buddha\nexplains that all formations (feeling, perception, etc.) and in effect\nall things are to be regarded as impermanent.  \n\n3. Not-self (anātman). This Buddhist view of the \nimpermanence of all phenomena works against the natural tendency to \nassume that knowledge and experience are attributable to a self that \nis permanent, stable, and unchanging. Instead of reifying each moment\nof existence, and operating with the assumption that continuity is \nthe hallmark of our lives, the Buddhist view presents a fluid account\nof experience as an ever-changing stream of psycho-physical events. \nThis dynamic model of human existence comprises the five classes \nof phenomena the Buddha referred to as the “aggregates of \ngrasping” (upādāna-skandha), on account of \nour tendency to grasp after and identify with them (see \n §2.3).\n These classes of phenomena are to be understood purely in causal \nterms, and not as the attributes and activities of a substantive \nself. There is no self or substantive mind that either supervenes on or \nexists apart from these aggregates. Rather, as the term \n‘aggregate’ suggests, the Buddhist tradition introduces a\nnew and unique way of talking about human experience by avoiding the \nmetaphysical pitfalls of reification. \n\nWhat is the relationship between thoughts, or even thoughts about\nthoughts, and actions? The Buddhist answers this question by\nintroducing a new theory of causality based on the principle of\ndependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). All things,\nincluding all cognitive events, arise in dependence upon a multitude\nof causes and conditions. Thus, the Buddhist appears to reject both\ntop-down (viz., cognitivist) and bottom-up (viz., strongly\ndeterminist) approaches to cognition: thoughts are neither prior to\nactions, and thus causally determine them, nor do they lack causal\nforce, and are thus epiphenomenal. The best known formulation of this\nprinciple captures the sense of transience and interdependence of all\nphenomena: “This being, that becomes; from the arising of this,\nthat arises; this not being, that does not become; from the ceasing of\nthis, that ceases” (Majjhima Nikāya, II, 32). \n\nThe Buddhist tradition conceives of the human individual as \nconsisting of five types of aggregates that serve as the bases of what we\nordinarily designate as persons: (1) material form or body \n(rūpa); (2) sensations (vedanā); (3) \napperception (saṃjña); (4) volitions or \ndispositional formations (saṃskāra); and (5) \nconsciousness (vijñāna). This aggregated view of \npersons informs all aspect of Buddhist thought and is indispensable \nto any account of cognition. Thus, in replacing the agent or \ncognizing ‘I’ with a play of causal factors resulting in \nmomentary cognitive events, the Buddhist tradition treats the \ncognizing agent as merely another way of referring to the embodied \nand dynamic functioning of the five aggregates. The specific nature \nof these aggregates is the subject of the Abhidharma descriptive \nanalytic (see \n §3).\n Following Vasubandhu's Treasury of Higher Knowledge (AKBh \nad I, 14–16), the five aggregates may be defined as \nfollows: \n\nForm. The first collection of aggregates, form or \nmateriality (rūpa-skandha), stands for objects regarded\nas compounded entities (saṃskṛta). Form is \nunderstood to be ‘compounded’ in only one of the two \nsenses in which compoundedness can be interpreted: that of being the \nproduct of causes and conditions (the other refers to entities that \nare produced by putting parts together). The category of form also \nincludes the sensory systems, which from an anatomical and \nphysiological point of view are material forms. \n\nFeeling. The second collection includes the aggregates of \nsensation or feeling (vedanā-skandha) and defines the \nquality of the impressions that result from contact between the sense\nand its object. Sensations are generally divided into pleasant, \nunpleasant and neutral and depend on the sensory modality in which \nthey originate. As internal mental states, sensations are both \nconditioned by, and conditioning of, the habitual tendencies of past \nkarmic activity.  \n\nApperception. The third collection of aggregates consists of\napperception (saṃjña-skandha), and refers to the \ncapacity to comprehend the specific marks (nimitta) of \nphenomenal objects. The characteristic mark of a phenomenon is its \ndistinctive quality. The term itself is a derivative from \nsaṃ + jñā, meaning ‘to \nunderstand,’ ‘to be aware of,’ or more \nappropriately ‘to make intelligible’ or ‘to cause \nto be understood,’ thus indicating the causative function of \nperception predicates. As a synthetic mode of apprehension, \napperception is caused by a multiplicity of factors including \nmemories, expectations, dispositions, etc. In this generic sense, \napperception might be understood as broadly equivalent to the \nAristotelian sensus communis, the faculty that binds \ntogether the sensory input into a coherent representation of the \nobject, or to Kant's notion of the transcendental unity of \napperception. \n\nVolitions. The fourth collection of aggregates includes \ndispositional formations or volitions \n(saṃskṛta-skandha). Volitions are primarily \nresponsible for bringing forth future states of existence. They \ninclude all the conditioned factors that are intrinsic to \nconsciousness (saṃprayuktasaṃskāra) as well\nas factors that are dissociated from consciousness \n(viprayuktasaṃskāra). Support for the view that \nmental factors dissociated from thought are to be included in the \ncategory of dispositional formations is found in the \nSaṃyukta-Nikāya (V, 450): “Delighting in \nsuch volitional formations, they generate volitional formations that \nlead to birth, generate volitional formations that lead to aging, \ngenerate volitional formations that lead to death, generate \nvolitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, \ndispleasure, and despair.” Volitions, thus, are habitual \nlatencies that predispose and motivate an individual to have a \ncertain type of experience while at the same time conditioning the \nresponse to that experience. \n\nConsciousness. The fifth and last collection contains the \naggregates of consciousness (vijñāna-skandha). In \ncontrast to apperception, consciousness is defined as the impression \n(vijñapti) of each object or as the bare apprehension \nof each object. Glossing on this definition, later Abhidharma \ncommentators treat consciousness (vijñāna) as \nreferring to an awareness of the object alone \n(vastumātra) (see Yaśomitra's \nVyākhyā ad AK I, 16). Unlike sensation \nand apperception, which apprehend the specific characteristics of \nobjects, consciousness acts as an integrating and discerning factor \nof experience. \n\nIn the schematic analysis of the five aggregates only form is a\nphysical aggregate stricto sensu. While sensations,\napperception, and volitions can acquire an objectual aspect,\nthey are not empirical objects proper. Thus, a sensation such as pain\nis not reducible to the physical substrate, say a finger, in which it\nis instantiated. Rather, as object-oriented cognitive aspects,\nsensations, apperception, and volitions are included in the broader\nAbhidharma category of mental factors (caitasika).\nFurthermore, the empirical approach that characterizes the Buddhist\nanalysis of materiality does not imply physicalism, at least not in\nthe sense that everything is or supervenes on the physical. Rather,\nmateriality is analyzed as being reducible to the phenomenal content\nof experience. Thus, the formal properties of material objects are\nanalyzed either in terms of how they are impacted by contact or as\nfactors that oppose resistance. These properties, however, do not\nextend to the atoms themselves, which according to the Abhidharma form\nthe building blocks of materiality. As monadic units the atoms are\nseen as devoid of any formal properties\n(rūpaṇa). It is only as atomic compounds\n(saṃghātastha,\nsaṃcita) that atoms are subject to the same properties\nof resistance and destruction as composite material entities (see \n §4.2).\n  \n\nSpeculations on the nature and function of consciousness have a long \nand complex history in Indian Buddhism. In the canonical literature \nthe term that most often translates as consciousness \n(vijñāna) is synonymously used for designating \n‘mind’ or the ‘life principle’ in the most \ngeneric sense of those terms. In a technical sense, consciousness \ndesignates either the type of awareness that arises depending on any \nof the six sensory domains (āyatana) or awareness as \none of the five aggregates of existence. In addition, consciousness \nis also listed as one of the twelve factors or causes \n(nidana) in the chain of dependently arising \n(pratītyasamutpāda) phenomena. However, it is only\nin the Abhidharma scholastic that we come across systematic attempts \nto understand the dynamic processes of consciousness and cognition. \nIndeed, the Abhidharma synthesis may be rightly viewed as a theory of\nconsciousness (cf. Piatigorsky 1984, 8). \n\nA few clarifications about the origins and scope of the Abhidharma\nscholastic are necessary before we explore its analysis of mind.\nFirst, as the name suggest, the Abhidharma (‘about’\n(abhi) + ‘the doctrine’ (dharma),\nusually translated as ‘higher doctrine’) is concerned with\nthe notion of dharma, its central and most difficult\nconcept. Depending on the context, a dharma may be taken to\ndesignate either the body of teachings attributed to the Buddha or a\nbasic element or unit of existence and/or experience, better captured\nby the notion of phenomenon. In the Abhidharmic analysis of mind and\nmental constituents, a dharma most closely refers to a\ntemporal instance in the stream of cognitive events, which is\nmomentary and discrete, that arises together with a moment of\ncognitive awareness (a vijñāna). In this extended\nsense, a dharma designates both an indivisible unit of\nexperience and an object of conceptual analysis, which means that\nfactors contributing to the arising of cognitive awareness can in turn\nbecome objects of reflective inquiry.  \n\nA large body of literature concerned with examining the received \nteachings had emerged roughly three centuries after the death of the \nBuddha (ca. 150 B.C.E.). The origins of the Abhidharma schools are \nthus traceable to the diverse interpretations of the Buddha's \nteachings. Two main branches of Abhidharma \nare extant: that of the Theravāda (‘Doctrines of the \nElders’), which became dominant in Sri Lanka and southeast \nAsia, and that of the Sarvāstivāda (the ‘All Exists \nSchool’), which flourished in North India and provided the \nbasis for the development of later Abhidharma and Mahāyāna \nschools in India, and later on in Central and East Asia. The \nfoundational texts for these two branches of Abhidharma are the \nKathāvatthu (‘Points of Controversy’) and \nthe Mahāvibhāṣā (‘The Great \nCommentary’). \n\nThe four main schools of Indian Buddhism emerge almost exclusively \nfrom the Northen branch of Abhidharma. The \nMahāvibhāṣā itself is associated with \nthe first of these schools, the Vaibhāṣika \n(‘Follower of the \nVibhāṣā’). The other three schools are\nthose of the Sautrāntika (‘Follower of the \nSūtra’), Madhyamaka (‘Middle Way School’) and \nYogācāra (‘Practice of Yoga School’). The \nSautrāntika doctrines survive primarily in later texts such as \nVasubandhu's Abhidharmakośa (‘Treasury of Higher \nKnowledge,’ ca. 360 C.E.) and Vimalamitra's \nAbhidharmadīpa (‘Light of Higher \nKnowledge,’ ca. 500 C.E.). The Madhyamaka School is associated \nwith the emergence of the vast corpus of \nPrajñapāramitā (‘Perfection of \nWisdom’) literature and with the works of the prominent \nBuddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna (fl. ca. 150 C.E.), \nprincipally with his magnum opus, the \nMūlamadhyamakakārikās (‘Verses on the \nFoundation of the Middle Way’). Lastly, the Yogācāra,\nwhich became the dominant philosophical school in India from the 5th \nthrough the 12th century traces it origins to the encyclopedic work \nof Asaṅga (ca. 315–390) and his half brother Vasubandhu \n(320–380). Asaṅga is credited with the authorship of the \nMahāyānasaṃgraha (‘Compendium of the \nGreat Vehicle’) and the encyclopedic \nYogācārabhūmiśāstra \n(‘Treatise on the Stages of the Practice of Yoga,’ most \nlikely a compilation by various authors). Vasubandhu is the author of\nsome of the most influential works of Indian Buddhist philosophy, \nwhich include, apart from his Treasury of Higher Knowledge \n(written from a Sautrāntika perspective) such seminal texts as \nthe Madhyāntavibhāgabhāṣya \n(‘Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from \nExtremes’), the Trisvabhāvanirdeśa \n(‘Teaching of the Three Self-Natures’), and the pithy but\ninfluential Viṃśatikākārikā \n(‘The Twenty Verses’) and \nTriṃśikakārikā (‘Thirty \nVerses’) (see \n §6.3\n for a discussion of the main arguments for idealism presented by \nVasubandhu in the Twenty Verses). \n\nA wide gulf separates works such as Vasubandhu's Treasury of\nHigher Knowledge, a foundational text for most of the\nphilosophical developments of late Indian Buddhism, from the simple\nand pragmatic teachings of the Buddha. The Abhidharma scholastic\nevolved from mnemonic lists (mātṛka) that were\ninitially intended to work as summaries of various topics discussed in\nthe canonical texts. These lists were usually structured around five\nmain categories: form or matter (rūpa), mind or\nconsciousness (citta), mental constituents (caitta),\nconditioned factors dissociated from consciousness\n(cittaviprayukta saṃskāra), and unconditioned\nelements (asaṃskṛta) such as cessation or\nnirvāṇa. In composing his Treasury of Higher\nKnowledge, Vasubandhu mainly relied on three Abhidharma texts:\nDharmaśri's An Epitome of Abhidharma\n(Abhidharmasāra), Ghoṣaka's The Nectar of\nAbhidharma (Abhidharmāmṛtaśāstra)\nand Kātyāyanīputra's Method of Knowing\n(Jñānaprasthāna) (see Frauwallner 1963, 1971a,\n1971b). From these three works Vasubandhu adopted his categorical\nclassification of Abhidharma topics according to the five\naggregates. The analytic models of the five categories and the five\naggregates represent, thus, “an attempt to record exhaustively\nall the elements of being and order them systematically”\n(Frauwallner 1995, 146). Such efforts were not new: indeed, the\nBuddhist attempt mirrors similar undertakings in the Brahmanical\ntradition. A good example of such undertakings is the\nSāṃkhya scheme of the mental and physical elements and\ntheir derivatives.  \n\nThe Sanskrit term most commonly associated with sensory activity, \nindriya (‘sensation’ or ‘power’), is\nfound in the Rg Veda (I, 55; II, 16), a collection of hymns \ndealing with various religio-philosophical topics central to the \nBrahmanical tradition. Here the senses are likened to lesser deities \nacting on behalf of Indra, the king of the gods, as messengers to the\nlower realms. As manifestations of Indra's specific powers, the \nsenses thus understood correspond to his capacity for knowledge \n(buddhīndriya) and action (karmendriya). This \nearly mythological narrative in which lesser deities are the agencies\nof sensory activity in humans bears some structural similarity to \nDescartes’ account in his Treatise of Man and \nPassions of the Soul of the animal spirits which flowing \nfrom the pineal gland control the activity of sensation, imagination,\nas well as bodily movements. In the Upaniṣads, this \nmythological account gives way to a philosophically nuanced view of \nsensory activity as the direct result of contact between the self and\nthe world. According to the Upaniṣadic understanding of \nperception, the senses are created from the substance of \nsense-objects and with the specific purpose of revealing the latter. \nThe revealing agent, however, is the self (see Kaṭha \nUpaniṣad, I, iii, 4). \n\nBuddhist authors, unlike their Brahmanical opponents, make a clear \ndistinction between the activity or faculty of sensing \n(indriyagocara) and the medium which implements it, as for \ninstance in distinguishing between the faculty of vision \n(cakṣurvijñānadhātu) and the visual \nsystem (cakṣurdhātu). Moreover, the senses are \nconceived as receptacles of experience \n(indriyādhiṣṭhāna) rather than \nphysical organs interacting with empirical objects. Instead of \ntreating the senses as the faculties of an internal agent, the \nBuddhists regard them as instruments or mediums joining together the \nexternal spheres of sensory activity with the internal spheres of \nperception (see Abhidharmasamuccayabhāṣya \nad I, 4.). In the Treasury of Higher Knowledge \n(AKBh ad I, 17), Vasubandhu provides the following list to \naccount for the causal relations that obtain between the sensory \nsystems and their bases or domains of activity \n(āyatana):  \n\nThus the Buddhist accounts for sensory activity and cognitive \nawareness by reducing experience to its contents and analyzing it in \nterms of its constitutive elements and functions. In the often quoted\nformula of dependent arising (see below \n §3.3),\n any of the six types of cognitive awareness in the first column \narises in dependence upon a corresponding element in columns 2 and 3.\nThus, instead of construing cognitive awareness as the activity of an\nabiding self, the Buddhist uses the notion of ‘aggregate’\nin the original sense of the Sanskrit term skandha: \nsomething which is fashioned by the collective combination of \nmultiple causes and conditions (see AKBh ad I, 7). These \nconstitutive parts, which collectively make the psycho-physical \ncontinuum that we ordinarily associate with persons, exist as part of\na causal continuum of interdependently arising phenomena.  \n\nOrdinary mentation is bound up with expectations, judgments, and \ndesires. The Buddhist philosophical term used for describing the \nstate of ordinary mentation is prapañca (lit. \n‘fabrication,’ usually translated as ‘conceptual \nproliferation’)[see Samyutta Nikāya, IV, 72]. We \ndon't simply apprehend an object. Rather, we apprehend it as the \nlocus of a multiplicity of associations: in seeing a tree we perceive\nan entity made of trunk, branches, and foliage but also something \nthat can provide shade and lumber. In perception we are ordinarily \nassailed by a stream of conceptualizing tendencies, which have their \nultimate source in linguistic conventions and categorizing practices.\nThese conceptualizing tendencies overwhelm and distort the perceptual\nexperience. \n\nIn the canonical literature conceptual proliferation is associated \nwith sensory activity rather than consciousness [see Samyutta \nNikāya, I, 100, IV, 52; Majjhima Nikāya, I, \n65]. These proliferating tendencies, which are sustained by a \nconstant flow of sense impressions, give rise to the common sense \nconceptual schema that informs our ordinary, habitual coping \npractices. Thus cognition, in its perceptual aspect, has a dual form:\nsubjectively, it discloses a bare consciousness that merely attends \nto the flow of sensations; objectively, it corresponds to each \nspecific domain of empirical awareness: visual objects to visual \nawareness, sounds to auditory awareness, etc. \n\nAn inevitable outcome of this dual aspect view of perception is the \ntendency of most Buddhist philosophy of mind toward metaphysical \nidealism, since the diversity and manifoldness of the perceived world\nsuggest not a rich and variegated ontology, but a profligate mind. \nAlternatively, the Buddhist philosophy of mind could be interpreted \nas a type of phenomenology, since it argues that empirical awareness \nopens us to a world that is not entirely free from our own mental \npropensities (see \n §5.4\n and \n §6.3).\n It is primarily on account of this proliferating tendency of the \nordinary mind that notions such as self and other are superimposed \nupon the constant flow of phenomena. Such superimpositions are the \nmain cause for the reification of perceptual content, leading to the \nall too familiar propensity to operate with notions such as existence\nand non-existence, self and other. As the Abhidharma traditions \nmaintain, concepts are superimposed upon the constant flow of \nphenomena in dependence upon the presence or absence of stimuli at \nthe sense-doors. \n\nThe canonical literature presents us with a standard formula for the \ndependently arising phenomenon of consciousness: \n\nAs this passage illustrates, a specific type of consciousness \naccompanies each of the sensory modalities, in this case the \nexperience of visual awareness. No one element in this nexus of \ninteractions has causal priority. Rather, these associations between \nperception and thinking are due to the habitual tendency of the mind \ntowards conceptual proliferation, for as the Buddha declares in his \ndiscourses, the perceptual experience of ordinary people is replete \nwith mistaken apprehensions. Note that while sense, object, and \nconscious apprehension come together as a consequence of past \nhabituations and other conditioning factors, the ensuing cognitive \nawareness appears to both sustain and be sustained by these factors. \n\nNow, in the canonical literature consciousness \n(vijñāna) is treated as a synonym of apperception \n(saṃjñā) [see Sutta Nipata, 538, \n806]. This lack of clear dissociation between apperception, \nunderstood here as the empirical apprehension of phenomena, and \nconsciousness as the apprehending faculty, is made obvious by \nfrequent references to saṃjñā as being the \ncause of attachment to agreeable physical objects and mental states. \nFurthermore, apperception is often contrasted with wisdom thus \nsuggesting that what is meant by it is not sensory activity proper \nbut rather the awareness that bears upon it. Likewise, \nvijñāna does not denote consciousness as a \ncognitive phenomenon distinct from sense perception. Rather, it \nrefers to the consciousness of a specific sense modality (e.g., \nvisual-awareness, auditory-awareness). Because the mental faculty is \nalso regarded as a sensory system, the type of awareness that bears \nupon it is termed mental or ‘introspective awareness’ \n(manovijñāna). The arising of consciousness, thus,\ndepends on sense perception, but it also depends on attention, since \nsensory activity alone does not give rise to perception. The latter \nactivity requires attending to the stimuli: the amorphous mass of the\nsense data gives rise to a percept only when sensation is coupled \nwith attention. In the formula of dependent arising that we encounter\nat several places in the canonical literature, consciousness is said \nto arise in dependence upon the sense and the physical object. But \nthe appearance of phenomena itself depend in turn upon this empirical\nawareness. Thus, the Buddha declares: \n\nPassages such as this present a metaphysical picture of mental and \npsychological individuation as arising in dependence upon the \nactivity of empirical consciousness. Consciousness, however, is not \ntreated as the direct cause for the manifestation of body, feelings \nand perceptions. Rather, the Buddhist tradition assigns this causal \nrole to the four elements. The structure is one of mutual entailment: \non the one hand, feelings, perceptions, and volitions are caused by \ncontact resulting from intentional states of cognitive awareness; on \nthe other hand, the psycho-physical aggregates in turn condition the \nmanifestation of consciousness. \n\nThus, the Nikāyas do not offer a comprehensive picture of \nconsciousness as a distinct phenomenon, but only as something that \narises and passes away as a result of the activity of all the other \npsycho-physical elements. Its characteristic aspect is determined by \nthe sensory system with which it happens to be associated. Thus, the \ndistinctive aspect of visual consciousness is determined by the \nmakeup of the visual sense and not by any intrinsic properties of its\nown. \n\nThe rejection of an immutable self abiding in each individual seems \nto have undermined all attempts to analyze consciousness on its own \nterms. Even though the Sanskrit term vijñāna \n(which in the Upaniṣads designates consciousness as an abiding \ncharacteristic of the self) is adopted by the Buddhists as an \nappropriate designation for consciousness, the interpretations found \nin the Nikāyas and the early Abhidharma deny its immutability \nand instead regard it as indistinct from perceptual cognition. At \nthis early stage in the development of a Buddhist theory of mind, \nvijñāna still retains its double meaning: (1) that\nof ‘consciousness’ as a factor in the chain of \ndependently arisen phenomena that is essential for the continuity of \nthe karmic process; and (2) that of ‘cognition’, a \nfaculty that is associated with each of the five sensory modalities \nand with the mind [see Samyutta Nikāya, III, 87; \nMajjhima Nikāya, I, 292]. In later Abhidharma \ntraditions, such as those of the Sautrāntika and \nYogācāra Schools, consciousness is discussed mainly in \nrelation to the aggregates of cognition \n(vijñānaskandha), which are primarily the senses \nand the mental faculty [see AKBh ad I, 16a]. \n\nAlready in the earliest strata of the canonical literature we find a \ntripartite model of cognition in which a clear distinction is made \nbetween the phenomenal world, its mode of apprehension, and the \nspecific type of consciousness by which it is apprehended. However, \nwhat is meant by world (loka) in this context is not an \nexternal reality of physical entities and processes, but the \nphenomenal world of perception (lokasaṃjñā) \nthat arises in dependence upon the proliferating activities of mind. \nThus, the notion that consciousness acts as a causal condition for \nthe appearance of phenomena, while not a direct rejection of \nexternal, mind-independent objects, does seem to anticipate the \nidealist tendencies of the Yogācāra School (see \n §6.3).\n  \n\nIn the canonical literature intentional acts are often assimilated to\nkarmic tendencies in such a way as to suggest that intentions or \nvolitions (cetanā) are not separate from the \npropensities generated by past experience. Abhidharma traditions, on \nthe other hand, operate with the assumption that all cognitions are \ninherently intentional. Indeed, for the Vaibhāṣika all \ntypes of consciousness are intentional: they are about an object that\nmust necessarily exist. However, a detailed account of intentionality\nis only found in later philosophical developments associated with the\nBuddhist logico-epistemological school of Dignāga and \nDharmakīrti (see \n §7.3).\n  \n\nFor instance, in the Treasury of Higher Knowledge (AKBh \nad I, 1ab), Vasubandhu defines action (karman) as \nvolition (cetanā) and its ensuing result. However, the \naction in fact comprises two distinct types of activity: the volition\nitself and the intentional act (cetayitvā). \nFurthermore, the action itself, conceived as a dual process of \nvolition and its result, in fact consists of three discrete stages: \nbodily, verbal, and mental action, corresponding respectively to the \nbasis of the action (or how it is realized), its own nature, and the \ncause which prompts it. Each of these three stages, although \napparently separate, are in fact the same action viewed from three \ndifferent angles. From the perspective of its basis, the action is \ngrounded in the body, which serves as its instrumental medium. From \nthe perspective of its nature, an action consists in its verbal \nand/or habitual expression. Finally, as far as its motivation is \nconcerned, an action finds its ultimate cause in the realm of the \nmental. Thus conception and verbal expression, represent forms of \nactivity that manifest an individual's intention to express certain \nideas or engage with a certain object of experience. This \nintentionality springs from continuous residual impressions \n(vāsanā) resulting from past associations of names\nwith the things they designate.  \n\nIn explaining the relationship between volition and action, \nVasubandhu points to traces left by past volitions to demonstrate \nthat intentional acts are not entirely determined by the present \nvolition. For example, the intention to break a rule of conduct such \nas not lying, is conditioned both by the present volition and by \ntraces left by similar volitional acts. In his Treatise on \nAction (Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa, III, 2, 40), \nVasubandhu expands on his idea that impressions of past experience \nare instrumental in effecting the karmic continuum that constitutes \nthe individual personality, by appealing to the notion of receptacle \nconsciousness (ālaya-vijñāna). A receptacle \nconsciousness (as the name suggests), can form the basis for the \nreception of consciousness traces \n(vijñānavāsanā), whereas a self, if \nconceived as a singular and immutable agent, is incapable of \nproviding such a support. For Vasubandhu and all followers of the \nYogācāra theory of consciousness, the analysis of \nintentionality cannot be properly conducted without reference to this\nreceptacle consciousness, a subliminal form of cognitive awareness \nthat serves as a basis for all the propensities, habits, and \ntendencies that inform and direct individual actions (see \n §5.4).\n  \n\nNearly all discussions that focus on the type of consciousness that \nis associated with a specific perceptual occasion (e.g., visual \nconsciousness with an instance of visual perception), seek to answer \nthe question of causal priority (which is prior, sensation or \ncognitive apprehension?) by examining the nature of contact itself. \nThus, whereas in the Nikāyas contact (sparśa) is \nthe primary cause of the arising of cognitive awareness, in the \nAbhidharma it becomes a derivative aspect of empirical consciousness \nitself (or indeed a dharma in its own right) (see \nVisuddhimagga XVII, 223–225; AKBh ad III, \n30). However, the mere presence of objects in the range of perception\ndoes not by itself give rise to cognitive awareness. For the content \nof experience to enter the domain of awareness, attention must be \ndirected to whatever is sensed. For this reason, attention \n(āvartana), understood as the mind's turning toward a \ncertain object, is not a key term in the canonical literature, where \nvarious cognitive functions are treated as distinct forms of \nconsciousness. The term becomes significant in the Abhidharma, where \nthe generality of consciousness is replaced with more concrete mental\nfunctions that perform specific tasks. However, Buddhaghosa in the \nAtthasālinī maintains that while consciousness can\narise without attention, it cannot arise in the absence of an \nobjective cognitive support (cf. Williams 1981, 230). \n\nThe role of attention in cognition becomes obvious if we take into \naccount the fact that the mere coming together of object, sense \nfaculty, and consciousness is not sufficient for a cognitive event to\narise. Rather, cognition occurs only when consciously attending to a \ngiven object. In normal circumstances, the senses always process a \nsteady and continuous stream sensory impressions. But this sense data\nbecomes a concrete object of apprehension only when attention is \ndirected toward specific regions of the perceptual field. Why is it \nthat causation must be understood from the perspective of \nconsciousness? Because, given the generally pragmatic concerns of the\nBuddhist explanatory account, consciousness is central to effecting \nthe changes that are necessary for an individual engaged on the noble\neight-fold path to make any real progress. Thus, whereas contact \ncannot be prevented so long as consciousness (citta) \ninhabits, and is conditioned by, the mental constituents \n(caitta, caittasika), feelings and perceptions that\nresult from contact are within the purview of consciousness. \n\nIn the Buddhist philosophical vocabulary there are at least three \nterms for what is ordinarily designated as ‘mind’: \nmanas (‘mental power’ or ‘mental \nfaculty’), vijñāna \n(‘discernment’ or ‘consciousness faculty’) \nand citta (‘mind’ or ‘thought’). The\nterm that most generally translates as ‘mind’ in the \nAbhidharma traditions is citta. But citta also \ndenotes thought and it is usually used in conjunction with the \n‘mental constituents’ (caitta) with which it \nstands in a reciprocal relation. Thus, whereas citta denotes\nthe subjective aspect of the mental domain (e.g., a state of pure \nawareness), caitta refers to specific cognitive states, such\nas sensations, perceptions, feelings, volitions, etc. These mental \nconstituents are understood specifically as cognitive domains \n(āyatana) or as sensed textures that mold our \nexperience and give it its qualitative aspects—the phenomenal \ncharacter of “what it is like”. Note that in works such \nas Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga and Vasubandhu's Treasury\nof Higher Knowledge, manas, vijñāna,\nand citta are used more or less synonymously as designating \nthe same mental reality (cf. Lamotte 1938, 15). However, in the \nMahāyānasaṃgraha (I, 6), Asaṅga takes \nthe three terms as designating different realities: citta is\nsaid to stand for the Yogācāra notion of receptacle \nconsciousness (ālaya-vijñāna), manas\nrefers to the mental domain and its afflictive tendencies, and \nvijñāna to the six types of cognitive awareness \n(bodily, sensory, apperceptive, etc).  \n\nThe Buddhist analysis of mind and mental phenomena relies on the\nexpansive taxonomies of the Abhidharma traditions, which seek to\nexplain human experience by reducing it to its most fundamental\nelements. These elements (e.g., sensations,\nvolitions, etc.) are effectively the irreducible units of experience\nthat any analysis of persons must ultimately reveal. Breaking every\nexperience down to its irreducible constituents holds the key to\nunderstanding both the dynamics of the mental and the resulting\nactivities that are associated with the karmic process. But the\nultimate aim of this reductive analysis is its overriding\nsoteriological (or even therapeutic) concern: mapping the mental\ndomain so that afflictive tendencies\n(kliṣṭa-manas) may be properly identified and\ncountered. \n\nAn important, and perhaps unintended, consequence of this project of \nreductive analysis is that momentariness is revealed to be not only a\nprinciple of the nature of reality, but also (and more significantly)\nof cognitive awareness itself. In the formula of dependent arising \n(quoted above in \n §3.3),\n the awareness that arises in conjunction with the activity of a given\nsensory system is itself impermanent and momentary: visual awareness \nand visual object, for instance, are both events within a mental \nstream of continuing relations. The question that Abhidharma \nphilosophers must confront is precisely what accounts for the sense \nof recollection that accompanies these cognitive series. In other \nwords, if discrete, episodic cognitive events are all that \nconstitutes the mental domain, how does appropriation and grasping, \nfor instance, occur? The causal account, it seems, gives only an \nincomplete picture of the mental, for even as the Sanskrit term for \ncognitive awareness, vijñāna, conveys the sense of\ndifferentiation and discernment, it is not exactly clear how such \ndiscernment also sorts between an inner and an outer domain of \nexperience. Indeed, consciousness is not merely a faculty for \ndiscerning and sorting through the constitutive elements of \nexperience, but itself an event in a series of interdependent causes \nand conditions. As we shall see below, it is only later with the \ndevelopment of the Yogācāra notion of reflexive awareness, \nthat this issue is properly addressed. \n\nThis account of the mental in terms of the irreducible units of \nexperience or dharmas is not without it problems (see \nPiatigorsky 1984, 181; Waldron 2003, 52). If what we take to be mind \nand mental phenomena are in fact discrete and momentary series of \ncognitive events, how are we to account for those elements in the \nmental stream that appear to subsist and continue? The dual use of \nvijñāna in the early Abhidharma literature to \ndesignate both a momentary discerning faculty and a persisting \nsentience, simply masks the problematic: a descriptive account of \nvijñāna in terms of a succession of momentary\ncognitive events, which alone are real and causally efficacious,\ncannot explain how past events outside the immediate causal series can\naffect the present. In its second use as pure consciousness or pure\nsensation, vijñāna takes on the role of\nexplanans. The possibility that this secondary sense of\nvijñāna could be mistakenly taken as suggestive of\nan abiding, enduring reality, explains in part why the Abhidharma \npsychological vocabulary includes terms such as pudgala \n(‘individual’ or ‘person’) and \ncitta-santāna (‘mind-steam’). \n\nIn the canonical literature, afflictive tendencies resulting from the\naccumulation of residual habits are seen as a pervasive aspect of the\nmental life even for the Buddhist adept. In\nthe Majjhima-Nikāya  (I, 433), for instance, we see the\nBuddha instructing his disciples about the latent nature of such\nafflictive underlying dispositions as the ‘self-view’\n(Pāli\nsakkāyadiṭṭhi, Skt. \nsatkāyadṛṣṭi). The example given here\nis that of an infant who has a latent disposition toward manifesting the\nview of personhood despite presently lacking such a notion. Using \nthis example, the Buddha then contrasts the state of the infant with \nthat of a mature person who, not having learned about the not-self \ndoctrine, habitually holds the view that she is or has a personality.\n \n\nAfflictive tendencies are not the only factors conditioning the \narising of cognitive awareness. The Abhidharma tradition also \nidentifies various types of limitations imposed upon the senses by \nvirtue of their natural constitution and the natural constitution of \ntheir apprehended objects. Vasubandhu, for instance, describes three \ntypes of resistance by which objects limit the activity of a given \nsense (see AKBh ad I, 14): \n\nAs this account of the types of limitations that restrict cognition \ndemonstrates, the Abhidharma tradition seems unambiguous about the \nultimate basis for cognition: this is to be found in the sensory \ndomain itself, given that cognitions change following modifications \nat the level of sense rather than in the mind (see AKBh ad \nI, 45ab). In the case where changes in the mental stream occasion in \nthe absence of any sensory stimulus, these are said to be the result \nof unconscious traces of past experience rather than endogenous to \nmind itself. \n\nThe Abhidharma analysis of the proper basis for the arising of \ncognition reveals another important aspect of the Buddhist cognitive \nmodel: cognition follows the sense rather than the object (see AKBh \nad I 28ab). This is obvious, for instance, in the specific \nterminology used to describe conscious cognitive activity: thus, a \nconsciousness which accompanies seeing is designated as “visual\nconsciousness” (cakṣurvijñāna) rather \nthan “consciousness of the visible” \n(rūpavijñāna). Seeing or having conscious \nvisual experiences is the result of being endowed with a visual \nsystem even as the seeming transparency of the experience of seeing \nmight suggest that visual awareness is of the object itself. \n\nThe notion that cognition has its basis in the sense rather than the\nobject is of tremendous philosophical import for the Sautrāntika\nand Yogācāra Schools, whose philosophical perspectives are\nbest described as phenomenalism. Thus terms used to designate physical\nobjects (viṣaya) are replaced with terms which\ndesignate cognitive aspects (ākāra).  For the\nYogācāras in particular, the denial of the existence of\nexternal objects may be interpreted simply as a rebuttal of the\ntendency to assign ontological status to empirical objects outside, or\nindependent of, the cognitive events in which they are instantiated\n(cf. Lusthaus 2002, 121), a view reminiscent of Berkeley's likeness\nprinciple. Similar reasons are at work in the Yogācāra\nperspective of epistemologists like Dharmakīrti, who take the\nview that consciousness is inherently intentional, a position which\nhas been recently termed ‘epistemic idealism’ (which is\ncontrasted with ‘external realism,’ presumably the\nposition adopted by the Sautrāntikas) (Dunne 2004, 59; see also\nDreyfus 1997; 2007). However, insofar as Dharmakīrti is primarily\nconcerned with epistemological issues, his commitment to the notion\nthat we are immediately aware of our cognitive states holds regardless\nof whether he adopts an idealist or a phenomenalist stance (cf. Arnold\n2008, 5 and passim). \n\nThe traditional model of mind found in canonical literature undergoes\nseveral systematic developments with the rise of the various\nAbhidharma schools. Among the most significant theories to emerge from\nthese systematic appraisals are the Theravāda theory of the\nlife-continuum mind (bravaṅga-citta), the\nSarvāstivāda theory of appropriation (prāpti)\nin the mental stream, the Sautrāntika theory of seeds\n(bīja) in the mental stream, and the Yogācāra\ntheory of repository consciousness\n(ālaya-vijñāna). In addition, we will also\nlook at Vasubandhu's critical response to the Pudgalavādins, and\nthe issue of whether the reality of persons can be ascertained at the\nconventional level without undermining the metaphysical underpinings\nof the Buddhist not-self doctrine. \n\nAs we saw above \n (§2.2)\n in the dynamic process of dependently arising phenomena that \nencompass the five aggregates, cognitive awareness \n(vijñāna) plays a double role: it is both the \nstream of conscious episodes that characterize the life of the mind \nand, at the same time, the principle of continuity of awareness, by \nvirtue of which some sense of identity is maintained over time (cf. \nJohansson 1979, 63f; Krizer 1999, 195f). Thus cognitive awareness \nprovides the basis for further cognitive activity, while also \nsupporting the formative karmic activities \n(saṃskāra) of sensation, perception, volition, \netc. that perpetuate the life cycle. \n\nThe double function of this cognitive awareness as a conditioned and \nconditioning factor within the overall dynamics of the five \naggregates is explained in causal terms by means of an analysis of \nthe underlying factors that play a role in the arising of each \ncognitive event. The lists of the types of causes, conditions, and \nresults in the Abhidharma discourse of causality vary only slightly \nfrom school to school. The classical Sarvāstivāda theory of\ncausality, for instance, explains the patterns of conditioning \nthrough the intermediary of six causes (hetu) and four types\nof conditions (pratyaya), as follows (see AKBh ad \nII 49–73): \n\nCauses \n\nConditions \n\nDetailed accounts of causality such as this are usually followed by\nlengthy debates about the precise nature and role of these patterns of\nconditioning. For instance, on the model of the homogeneous and\nimmediately antecedent condition (no. 2 above) a particular dharma\nconditions that arising of a dharma of a similar type: a moment of\njoy, therefore, may only give rise to another moment of joy. What this\nmodel cannot explain is how karmic maturation can arise from causes\nthat are different, especially when the fruit of karmic activity is\nnot the result of immediately preceding causes but of a heterogeneous\nand temporally distant causal chain (see Waldron 2003, 65\nand passim). It is precisely this sort of issues that\nprecipitated the development of notions such as the mind-continuum\n(citta-santana) and receptacle consciousness\n(ālaya-vijñāna). More to the point, Abhidharma\nphilosophers were pressed to counter the possibility that latent\ndispositions could persist in an unexplained way in the mental stream\nso that even skillful thoughts, for instance of generosity or\nloving-kindness, could not be free of them. The alternative scenario,\nin which the causal chain might be interrupted by a single thought,\nfor instance of enlightenment, is no less puzzling: such an\ninterruption could bring about sudden enlightenment. \n\nIncidentally, developments in Chinese Buddhist thought linked with \nthe Platform Sūtra would arrive at precisely such a \nconclusion: that enlightenment is not a gradual but an instantaneous \nprocess. Thus, advocates of the gradual path of cultivation (Skt. \nbhāvanā-krama, Chinese chien) would \nhenceforth debate proponents of sudden enlightenment (Skt. \nyugapat, Chinese tun-wu) such as we find, for \ninstance, in the Great Debate of Lhasa (ca. 792) between the Chinese \nand Korean Ho-shangs teachers and the highly scholastic Indian \ntradition of Yogācāra-Mādhyamaka represented by \nŚāntarakṣita and his disciple Kamalaśīla \n(see Demiéville 1947, 1952, Gomez 1987, Lai 1987, McRae 1987, \nGregory 1987, Ruegg 1989). \n\nThe challenge posed by the need to account for the continuity of mind\nin the absence of an enduring, substantive self, was met with mixed \nsuccess by early Abhidharma authors. Thus, most Ābhidharmikas \nunderstood mind primarily as a species of mental cognition and, as \nsuch, explained the continuity of the mental stream as a successive \nseries of cognitive events conditioned by such factors as karmic \nformations, appropriation, and mind itself. \n\nThe Theravāda authors extended this account of the continuity of\nthe mental stream by introducing the notion of mind as factor of \nexistence (bhava-aṅga). Thus, for the \nTheravādins, this life-continuum mind became just another factor\nconditioning the arising of cognitive awareness. The new formula for \nthis dependent arising of cognitive awareness suggest a significant \ndeparture from the basic canonical account. As Buddhaghoṣa \nnotes in the classical compendium of Theravāda Abhidharma, the \nPath to Purity (Visuddhimagga XV, 39), \n“mental awareness arises dependent on the life-continuum mind, \nmental content, and attention”. But continuity in the \nlife-stream is also supported by the body, even though it is possible\nto assume the absence of bhava-aṅga in states of deep \nmeditative absorption (cf. Collins 1982, 246). Outside these rare \nstates of absorption, the bhava-aṅga-mind or mind as \nfactor of existence is essential for continuity in the life-stream. \nThe most common tropes used in this context are those of a stream or \nbeads strung together on common thread. Collins sums up rather well \nthe imagery used for explicating the function of the life-continuum \nmind: \n\nModern interpreters have proposed that we regard the function of this\nlife-continuum mind as being primarily subliminal, although its \nprecise operations are not clearly specified. Thus, Cousins (1981, \n28–30) and Nyayatiloka (1980, 27f) suggest that the principal \nfunction of bhava-aṅga may well be that of either \naccessing or carrying forth the dispositions, habits, and essential \ncharacteristics of the person. As such, it may not be a conditioning \nfactor for the arising of cognitive awareness, but rather merely a \nsubliminal level of mental processing. \n\nIn seeking to reconcile the Abhidharma analysis of mind, and its \nsynchronic model of momentary cognitive events, with the diachronic \nphenomenon of karmic activity, the Abhidharma philosophers came up \nwith different solutions. The Vaibhāṣika (also referred in\nthe literature as the Sarvāstivādins), solved the problem \nof the continuity of karmic potential by proposing an ontology of the\nconstitutive elements of reality (or dharmas) as existing in\nall three temporal dimensions: past, present, and future. On this \nontological model, dharmas do not change, only their temporal \ncondition does. The principal reason for adopting this peculiar \nontology is the theory of the momentariness \n(kṣaṇikavāda) of all phenomena: if nothing \nendures for more than a moment how, then, can a cause that is no \nlonger present lead to a manifest result? Similarly, if the \naccumulated karmic potential from past experience is no longer \npresent, how could it affect the present condition? But in \npostulating the existence of the constituent elements of experience \nthroughout the three temporal dimensions, the \nSarvāstivādins simply shifted the Abhidharma problematic: \nhaving presumably explained what accounts for the efficacy of \naccumulated karmic potential, the question now is why a karmic result\narises at one time rather than another? [for detailed discussions of \nVaibhāṣika ontology and its analysis of mind see Williams \n1981, Bastow 1994, and Cox 1995]  \n\nThe Vaibhāṣika solution consists in the introduction of a \nnew type of dharma, that of appropriation (prāpti), \nwhose persistence in the mental stream is not due to any other \nfactors, including the results of past actions, but rather to its own\ncapacity to replicate itself. The presence of a factor of \nappropriation in the mental stream thus ensures the karmic \nefficacy of past causal chains. It also explains why mental factors \nand events remain associated with a given mental stream. This new \ndharma of appropriation is classified as being dissociated from \nthought and as neutral; it is also classified as being one of the \ndetermining factors for differentiating one mental stream from \nanother (see AKBh ad II 35). Furthermore, it explains why \ncertain dispositions, such as aversion, persist in the mental stream \nof an individual (because appropriation follows the initial \nexperience of a first moment of aversion), and how it is possible to \novercome such dispositions (when appropriation is associated with \nfactors that condition non-aversive states of mind). In both cases, \nthe concept of appropriation provides an account of continuity in the\nmental stream that goes against the stipulations of the Abhidharmic \nprinciple of the momentariness of mental states. Thus, the \nVaibhāṣika solution to reconciling the theory of causality\nwith the theory of the momentariness of all phenomena rests on a \nnotion that itself defies explanation, prompting traditional critics \nsuch as Vasubandhu to ask whether appropriation is a real entity or a\nmerely conventional one, and in the end to dismiss it altogether (see\nAKBh ad II 36cd).  \n\nThe theory of seeds (bīja) in the mental stream, which\nis associated with the Sautrāntikas, represents a direct response\nto the Vaibhāṣika efforts toward an unified account of\ncausality and momentariness. A ‘seed’ in this case stands\nfor two sets of phenomena: (1) latent dispositions underlying the\nkarmic process; and (2) the capacity or power of certain causal chains\nto bring about a given result. Unlike the Sarvāstivāda\nconcept of appropriation, the notion of seeds is used here only in a\nconventional sense and thus does not designate any real element of\nexistence whether associated with, or dissociated from, thought.\nTaking memory as an example, Vasubandhu explains the metaphorical use\nof the notion of seeds in the mental stream as simply designating\n“the capacity for recollection to arise originating from\nexperiential knowledge” just as, for instance, sprouts have the\ncapacity “to produce a grain of rice from a previous grain of\nrice” (AKBh ad V 1d-2a). \n\nThe theory of seeds in the mental stream thus provides a mode of \ntalking about causality that does not exclude the notions of latency \nand disposition. By applying the organic imagery that is associated with \nseeds and sprouting to mind and mental phenomena the \nSautrāntikas open the door for an understanding of mentation as \na dynamic and creative process. A causal account of the mental \nconditioning has thus been supplemented by a dispositional account of\nmental states (even though ultimately these dispositions are not \nreally true factors of existence). Furthermore, given the association\nof intentional mental states with consciousness or cognitive \nawareness, cognitive events are regarded as the main force sustaining\nand perpetuating the life cycle, even though Buddhist traditions also\nadmit that in certain states of meditative absorption there is no \nmental activity. For the Sautrāntikas it is the body with its \nsense organs and various other conditioning factors that are \nappropriated in consciousness, ensuring thus that some type of \nmentation whether in a conscious, subliminal, or subtle mental form \n(viz., dreamless sleep), is always ongoing. A debate only arises when\nconsidering the causal mechanism that permits the emergence of \nconsciousness from cessation. \n\nThe debate between the Vaibhāṣikas and the \nSautrāntikas concerning the emergence of consciousness from the \nattainment of cessation casts further light on the theoretical \npositions of these two schools regarding the nature of mind and mental phenomena. \nDrawing from the canonical literature, Buddhaghosa describes the \nattainment of cessation (Pāli, nirodha-samāpatti) \nas “the non-occurrence of consciousness and its concomitants \nowing to their progressive cessation” (Path to Purity,\n23, 18; Ñānamoli 1956, 824), in which progressive cessation\nstands for all three types of activities (viz., physical, mental, and\nverbal). The Vaibhāṣika position is that in the attainment\nof cessation there are no mental events. Given the \nVaibhāṣika's commitment to the causal account of the \nhomogeneous and immediately antecedent condition \n(samanantarapratyaya), which states that mental events have \nas the necessary condition for their occurrence an immediately \npreceding mental event within the same mental series, he must answer \nthe following questions, clearly identified by Griffiths (1986, 61): \nDoes the last moment of consciousness prior to the attainment of \ncessation “posses an immediately antecedent and homogeneous \ncondition but is not itself one?” And, conversely, does the \nfirst moment of consciousness following the attainment of cessation \noccur “without an immediately antecedent and homogeneous \ncondition while itself being one for the moment that follows \nit?” \n\nThe Vaibhāṣika answers these questions, again, by appealing\nto the theory of the trans-temporal existence of dharmas and the \npossibility of a temporal separation between an immediately \nantecedent condition and its effects: thus, even in the case of \nlonger (that is, non-momentary) temporal discontinuities in the \nmental stream, the causal principle of the immediately antecedent \ncondition ensures that consciousness arises again from an instance \nsimilar to the one that preceded the attainment of cessation (cf. \nGriffiths 1986, 63). \n\nThe main point of disagreement between the Vaibhāṣika and \nthe Sautrāntikas concerns the possibility of causation at a \ndistance: that is, whether it is possible for the cognitive awareness\npreceding the attainment of cessation to serve as the immediately \nantecedent condition for the arising of consciousness after \ncessation. In assuming that mental activity is absent in the \nattainment of cessation, the Vaibhāṣikas explain continuity\nin the mental stream by appealing to the principle of causation at a \ndistance, specifically by relying on their trans-temporal view of \ndharmas. Furthermore, for the Vaibhāṣikas, given that they\naccept the existence of past dharmas, the thought of cessation \n(samāpatticitta) becomes the immediately antecedent and\nhomogeneous condition for the thought of awakening \n(vyutthānacitta).  \n\nFor their part, the Sautrāntika accept neither causation at a \ndistance nor the existence of constitutive elements of experience in\nall three temporal dimensions. Rather, as Vasubandhu and his \ncommentators Yaśomitra and Sthiramati argue, the consciousness \nthat emerges immediately following the attainment of cessation has as\nits cause the physical body: this is because mind and body are in a \nconstant and reciprocal relation of causation, that is, “the \nmind and the body with its perceptual systems mutually seed one \nanother” (AKBh ad II 44d; Poussin 1980, vol. I, 212). \nOther Sautrāntikas, such as Vasumitra, content that in effect a \nsubtle form of consciousness continues even after the attainment of \ncessation, for to assume otherwise would be equivalent to claiming \nthat life can continue without consciousness (an untenable position \nfor the Buddhist). \n\nThe Vaibhāṣika rebuttal to the notion that some subtle \nform consciousness persists even after the attainment of cessation \npoints to the tripartite nature of the dependently arising cognitive \nphenomena: cognitive awareness, being inherently intentional, is \nalways directed toward an object, and whenever there is contact with \nsuch an object there is feeling and apperception. In response, the \nSautrāntika insists that not all contact leads automatically to \nsensation (as is the case with advanced contemplatives such as the \nArhats) and furthermore that the notion of attainment itself \n(samāpatti) in fact implies the presence of a conscious\nstate of the attainment of cessation. That state of attainment is not\nsustained by any substantive elements of existence (viz., the \ntrans-temporal dharmas of the Vaibhāṣika) but rather by \nthe thought of attainment itself (samāpatticitta). It \nis this thought of attainment that prevents, for as long as a \nmeditator is able to sustain it, the arising of any other thoughts. \nThe attainment of cessation, then, is simply a temporary state of \nnon-mentation. \n\nNeither the theory of appropriation nor that of seeds in the mental \nstream seem to offer a satisfactory account of non-mentation. The \nlimitations of the two views are clearly spelled out by Sthiramati \n(see Ṭikā ad AKBh VIII, 33): First, in the case \nof the Vaibhāṣikas, consciousness or the arising of \nconsciousness cannot have as its immediately antecedent and \nhomogeneous condition the cessation of consciousness for that \nviolates the causal principle itself, even assuming that body and \nsensory systems provide a basis for this arising. Second, by claiming\nthat consciousness can indeed arise from the body and its sensory \nsystems, the Sautrāntikas fall short of identifying the specific\ncause which assures (on the basis of the causal principle of the \nhomogeneity of the species) that consciousness arises at precisely \nthe right moment. Even assuming that mind and body seed each other \nprior to the attainment of cessation, there is no causal mechanism to\nexplain why a particular type of consciousness arises and not \nanother: in the absence of a cause that ensures the homogeneity of \nthe species, with just the body and its sensory systems as the basis,\nany type of consciousness could arise, rendering the causal process \nrandom and arbitrary. The function of the causal principle of the \nhomogeneity of the species is precisely that of ensuring that, say, \nwhen visual system and visible object come together, it is visual \nconsciousness rather than auditory or olfactory consciousness that \narises [for a detailed analysis of the complex issues surrounding the\nattainment of cessation, see Griffiths 1986, 66 and passim].\n \n\nThe theoretical developments that led to the notion of repository \nconsciousness (ālaya-vijñāna), which is \nassociated with the Yogācāra School, are already \nforeshadowed in these Abhidharma debates about how best to \naccount for continuity in the mental stream and the efficacy of \naccumulated karmic potential. The notion of repository consciousness \nappears perhaps for the first time in Asaṅga’s \nencyclopedic work, Stages of the Practice of Yoga \n(Yogācārabhūmi, cf. Schmithausen 1987, 12, \n18). The new type of consciousness, closely connected with the living\nbody, retains much of the original use of vijñāna \nto designate both consciousness and cognition. The function of the \nrepository consciousness is explained in a seminal Yogācāra\nwork such as the Sutra Explaining the Profound Meaning \n(Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra, V. 2, Lamotte 1935, 230) \nas having the primary function of ‘descending’ in the \nmother's womb, ‘appropriating’ the sensory systems and \ntheir respective cognitive support, and thus creating the \npredisposition toward mental proliferation (cf. Waldron 2003, 95 and \npassim). \n\nThe Yogācāra thus explains the cognitive process as a \nmaturation of the flow of discrete elements of consciousness. This \nflow of consciousness, which the Sautrāntikas call \nmind-continuum (citta-santāna), ultimately supports all\ntypes of perceptual activity, including self-awareness. In its \nindeterminate state, this flow of consciousness is the repository of \nall non-aspectual types of cognitive awareness \n(nirvikalpa-jñāna). This repository mind is said \nto arise together with all the seeds, thus suggesting the imagery of \na repository of all the elements of consciousness and cognition.  \n\nIn the Compendium of the Great Vehicule \n(Mahāyānasaṃgraha; hereafter MSG), Asanga \ndefines the receptacle consciousness \n(ālaya-vijñāna) as the basis or support of \nthat which is cognizable (jñeyāśraya) and \nexplains the term ‘receptacle’ (ālaya) as \nsuggestive of a double function: (1) that of acting as a repository \nfor the afflictive tendencies, and (2) that of providing the causal \npotentiality of the dharmas themselves (MSG I, 1–5). \nFurthermore, the receptacle consciousness is described as having the \nuncommon characteristic of being the seed for the sense spheres (MSG \nI, 59): the obvious implication here is that our experience of the \nworld is as perception reveals it. And since the sense spheres are in\neffect seeded by this receptacle consciousness, the world we inhabit \nis ultimately a minded world. \n\nIn his analysis of consciousness in the Thirty Verses \n(Triṃśikā-kārikā, I, 1) Vasubandhu\ntreats apprehending subject and apprehended phenomena are emergent \nproperties of the threefold transformation of consciousness \n(vijñānapariṇama). This transformation \nbegins when the maturating seeds of consciousness take the form of \nperception and thought processes. Following this process of \nmaturation and in dependence upon the repository consciousness there \nevolves a reflexive awareness whose object is none other than this \nsubliminal or repository consciousness itself. This theory of \ncognitive emergence presumably provides a better account of the role \nthat the residual forces of past cognitions play in \n‘seeding‘ the repository consciousness. It is the \ndynamics of these residual forces which ultimately generates the \nintentional forms of cognitive awareness that support all other forms\nof cognitive activity.  \n\nOne group of Buddhist philosophers, the Pudgalavādins (lit. \npersonalists), usually identified with the \nVātsīputrīyas, seem to have advocated the view that \npersons can be said to conventionally exist, insofar as they are \nconceived in dependence upon the five aggregates and the six types of\ncognitive awareness (cf. Priestley 1999). The Pudgalavādins took\npersons to be as real as the collection of aggregates and regarded \nthem as neither identical nor different from the aggregates. Direct \naccounts of the Pudgalavāda doctrine survive primarily in the \ncritiques of their opponents (and in three short texts preserved only\nin Chinese and in the \nSaṃmitīyanikāyaśāstra). \n\nVasubandhu offers what is perhaps the most detailed account of the \npersonalist theory in his Treasury of Higher Knowledge, \nalong with a refutation of the Brahmanical view of persons advocated \nby the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. The relevant \nsection of the text, the Treatise on the Negation of the \nPerson (AKBh IX), begins with the standard warning that clinging\nto any substantive view of the self is detrimental to one's progress \ntoward liberation. Insofar as the notion of “self” or \n“person” is retained this should not be taken to \ndesignate anything other than the aggregates. \n\nThe arguments that the Pudgalavādins advance in support of the \nreality of persons may be summarized as follows: \n\nIn introducing the views of the personalists, Vasubandhu draws a \ndistinction between the substantive and the conceptual view of the \nself. Thus, if ‘person’ (pudgala) is taken to \ndesignate a substantive entity that is separate from the bundle of \nthe five aggregates and unconditioned, then that cannot be the \nBuddhist view (per contra that is the Brahmanical view of \nthe self). On the other hand, if the notion of ‘person’ \ndesignates a collection of aggregates, then it is admissible to talk \nabout persons being conventionally real (for detailed discussions of \nVasubandhu's critique of the personalist view see Duerlinger 1993, \n2003). Drawing on some contemporary discussions in the philosophy of \nmind, Siderits (2003: 89–96) makes a good case for taking the \nPudgalavādins as proposing something analogous to the notion \nthat persons non-reductively supervene on the aggregates. A common stylistic feature of the Buddhist canonical literature is\nthe use of similes and parables, of which perhaps the best known is\nthe simile of the raft. In the Middle Length Discourses, the\nBuddha is seen explaining to an old man that his body of teachings is\nlike a raft: it serves the purpose of crossing over (viz., from the\nshore of afflictions to that of nirvāṇa) and should be\nabandoned once the crossing has been effected (Majjhima\nNikāya, III, 22; Ñānamoli & Bodhi 1995,\n228f). The simile of the raft marks the pragmatic (Jayatilleke (1963,\n357) calls it ‘utilitarian’) approach of the Buddha's\nteachings, and is also suggestive of a core aspect of Buddhist praxis:\nthe notion of expedient means\n(upāya-kauśalya). Ganeri has recently proposed that\nwe identify the nature of Buddha's discourses as being essentially\nprotreptic, similar to the Stoic exhortation which invites the adept\nto reconsider and rethink her ethical and metaphysical position\n(cf. Ganeri 2007, 100 and passim). Thus, the notion of\nexpedient means—this specifically Buddhist\nprotreptic—operates as a cautionary device against the tendency\nto assume that Buddhist doctrines may be seen as articulating a\nparticular type of metaphysics whose principles are to be examined\nwithout any appeal to context or target audience. It is primarily in response to the Buddha's use of expedient means\n(and the expansion of the Buddhist canonical literature with the\nadvent of Mahāyāna sūtras) that Abhidharma traditions\ndevelop the hermeneutics of two truths: depending on scholastic\naffiliation, doctrinal positions are henceforth classified as either\nin need of interpretation (neyārtha) or as already\npossessing the definitive meaning (nītārtha) (see\nLopez 1988, and contributions therein). The hermeneutics of two truths is central to Madhyamaka dialectics\nand its deconstructive analysis of key metaphysical concepts,\nincluding those of causation, essence, and the self. In\nthe Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way\n(Mūlamadhyamakakārikās; hereafter MMK),\nNāgārjuna extends the notion that phenomena lack intrinsic\nexistence (svabhāva) to apply to the self, which is\nusually conceived in dependence upon the five aggregates (MMK, IX,\n12). While considering various ways of conceiving of the self (viz.,\nas distinct from the psychophysical aggregates, as unchanging, as a\nunifying principle, or as an agent), Nāgārjuna concludes\nthat none of them actually make sense on account of the fact that\nnothing can be said to be prior to the cognitive activities of seeing,\nhearing, etc. (MMK, IX, 7, 10). A metaphysical self, conceived as an\nabiding and substantive entity, is therefore inconceivable. However, the mistaken apprehension of a self in a stream of\ncausally interconnected cognitive events does not preclude endorsing a\nconventional notion of self for ordinary individuals who lack a proper\nunderstanding of actions and their consequences. Indeed, Āryadeva\n(ca. 150 C.E.), an immediate disciple of Nāgārjuna, invokes\nthe expedient means device to endorse precisely such a view: for\ncertain classes of individuals adherence to a conventional view of\nself is more profitable than the denial of self. The not-self view,\nclaims Āryadeva, is primarily reserved for those of a superior\ndisposition, who alone can grasp the definite meaning of the Buddha's\nteachings (cf. Catuḥśataka, 12.12-14). However,\nultimately the Buddha's teachings are interpreted as endorsing not any\nspecific view, but rather the relinquishing of all views—which\nis only possible in a non-positional awareness that captures the\nparadoxical nature of the Madhyamaka dialectic (detailed discussions\nof the Madhyamaka dialectic of emptiness as applied to the self are\nfound in Sprung 1979, Huntington 1989, Tillemans 1990, Garfield 1995,\nand Westerhoff 2009).\n \n\nAlthough all Abhidharma schools admit the ultimate reality of \ndharmas, only the Vaibhāṣika (or Sarvāstivāda) \nSchool contends that dharmas exist in all three temporal dimensions \n(past, present, and future). The main arguments for this view \nare found in the Vijñānakāya and the \nMahā-Vibhaṣā, as well as in Vasubandhu's \nAbhidharmakośa, where they are systematically debated \nand refuted. In all, three types of arguments are put forward to \nsupport the notion that the past and future basic units of existence \n(dharmas) are presently real: \n\nA plausible rationale for the Sarvāstivādin’s \nassertion of the continuing existence of past and future \ndharmas concerns the first and third arguments: it is \nimpossible to conceive of a non-existent intentional object or the \ncausal efficacy of a non-existent dharma. Given the \nprinciple of momentariness, which states that things exist only as \npoint instants, it would be impossible to explain the arising of a \nparticular type of cognitive awareness in the absence of an already \nexisting preceding cause. Cognitive awareness, which arises in \ndependence upon the object and the corresponding sense faculty, would\nlack support if past dharmas were unreal. In his commentary to \nthe verse portion of the Treasury of Higher Knowledge, \nVasubandhu explains the standpoint of the Sarvāstivādin as \nfollows:  \n\nFor the Vaibhāṣikas the justification for maintaining the \nexistence of dharmas in all three temporal dimensions is provided by \ntheir causal theory of cognition: since cognitive awareness cannot \narise in the absence of an objective support, the cognition must be \ncausally related to the object. The object, therefore, must be real, for \nnonexistent objects lack causal efficacy (as we discussed in \n §5.1).\n  \n\nNominalism is primarily associated with a specific philosophical \nposition adopted by Buddhist philosophers of the \nlogico-epistemological tradition concerning the ontological status of\nuniversals. However, long before the development of Buddhist \nNominalism, Buddhist philosophers had adopted what might be properly \ntermed as a nominalist stance in regards to the nature of composite \nentities, including persons. Thus, discussions about the ontological \nstatus of the various elements of experience in the early Abhidharma \ntraditions were already framed by the distinction between things \nthat existed substantively (dravyasat) versus those that had\nonly nominal or conventional existence (prajñaptisat). \n\nIn the celebrated dialogue between the Buddhist philosopher \nNāgasena and King Milinda (often identified with the \nGreco-Bactrian King Menander I, ca. 150 B.C.E.), we come across one \nof the first references to the notion that an individual exists only \nas an appellation or conventional designation (Pāli \npaññatti, Skt, prajñapti). As \nNāgasena declares in response to the King's question about who \nhe is or what is he known as: “Nāgasena and so on—is\nonly a generally understood term, a designation in common use. For \nthere is no permanent individuality (or self) involved in the \nmatter” (Questions of King Milinda, II, 1, 25). \nNāgasena's claim frames the nominalist tendency that is already \nat work in the Buddhist canonical literature: just as words such as \n‘chariot’ are used only when certain parts are arranged \ntogether to form a spatio-temporal entity we ordinarily designate as \nsuch, so also an individual (satto) is nothing but a \nconventional designation that applies to the five aggregates.  \n\nAlthough Abhidharma philosophical views on the kinds of entities that\nhave only nominal existence range widely, it is generally agreed that\npersons or individuals are always to be taken as nothing more than \nmerely conventional designations established on the basis of the five\naggregates, the domains of perceptual activity, and their respective \nelements. Note, however, that Abhidharma philosophers do not deny the\nphysical reality of aggregated entities and persons. Indeed, \nmateriality or form (rūpa), which is also one of five \ncollections of aggregates, is generally considered to be an external,\nnon-mental reality. Rather, the two-tiered approach to the existence \nof phenomena, which distinguishes between substantial and nominal \nexistents, is meant to reject not the existence of extra mental \nentities proper, but rather the existence of all partite entities \nsuch as chairs, pots, and tables (cf. Kapstein 2001, 90 and \npassim; Siderits 2003, 33 and passim). \n\nIn the Abhidharma ontology only the atoms that compose the four \nelements are ultimately real. Thus, the theory of two levels of \nexistents implies a philosophical perspective that is best described \nas reductionism. On this view, only partless entities (i.e., atoms) \ncan be said to properly exist. The property-particulars of phenomenal\nexperience (the svalakṣaṇas) are real only \ninsofar as their atomic configurations provide a causal basis for the\narising of perceptual apprehension. But the Buddhist reductionist, as\nSiderits (2003, 13 and passim) has clearly argued, is not an\neliminativist. Unlike the eliminative materialist who regards \nconventional, folk-psychological discourse about persons as \nunsupported by, say, neuroscientific data (and thus is willing to \ndispense with a theory of persons altogether), the Buddhist \nreductionist merely points to the conventional nature of persons as \nordinarily conceived. Whether we consider the view of Buddhist \npersonalists such as the Vātsīputrīyas (or \nPudgalavādins), who hold that persons non-reductively supervene \nupon the psychophysical aggregates, or that of Buddhist reductionists\nwho treat persons as conventional designations, a theory of persons \nis retained.  \n\nThe Yogācāra school, which is associated with the works of\nthe half-brothers Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, its founders and\nprincipal exponents, is often identified by later Buddhist\ndoxographers as the Mind-only or Cognition-only School\n(Cittamātra or\nVijñaptimātra), on account of its internalist \nepistemology. In texts such as Vasubandhu's Twenty Verses: A \nDemonstration on Existence of Consciousness Only \n(Viṃśatikā \nVijñaptimātratāsiddhi; hereafter VVS) and \nDignāga's Investigation of the Cognitive Support \n(Ālambanaparīkṣā; and its \nVṛtti; hereafter APV) we are presented with a \nmetaphysical picture of cognitive awareness or consciousness as the \nonly ultimately existing reality.  \n\nIn the Twenty Verses, Vasubandhu offers an elaborate defense\nof idealism. His arguments may be summarized as follows: Because\nnon-existing entities can be consciously apprehended, consciousness\nmust have ontological priority (VVS I, 1). The typical realist\nobjection to an assertion of this sort concerns the causal function of\nperception: indeed, if mental content can be said to consciously arise\nwithout any reference to external objects, then why does it arise at a\nspecific time and place and not everywhere and at any given moment?\n(VVS ad 2) In his response, Vasubandhu appeals to the dream\nargument: objects in a dream appear as having determined\nspatio-temporal coordinates without there being any correspondence to\nexternal realities. As he explains, dream objects arise in dependence\nupon the transformation of residual impressions\n(vāsanās), stock examples of which include the\nphenomenon of nocturnal emission of semen (VVS\nad 3–4). Similarly, to the objection that cognition \nmust have a basis (āyatana) for its arising, Vasubandhu\nresponds by appealing to the theory of seeds in the mental stream: \nthe physical object and the cognitive faculty which together provide \nthe basis for the arising of a particular type of cognitive awareness\nare now seen as an object-oriented cognitive aspect and its internal \nrepresentation. It only seems as though a patch of color and the \nvisual system which processes it are the basis for color qualia. In \nreality, claims Vasubandhu, it is the residual traces (viz., the \ntransforming seeds) in the mental stream that take the form of \ntangible object and tactile sense (VVS ad 9). \n\nA stronger objection, however, pertains to certain aspects of \ndoctrine: if consciousness has the capacity to appear as bearing the \ncharacteristics of material objects, then what purpose do canonical \nteachings about the material bases for the arising of consciousness \nserve? The answer to the second objection is twofold: first, \nVasubandhu appeals to the hermeneutical strategies of Buddhist \nschools such as Madhyamaka and Yogācāra, which distinguish \nbetween direct and indirect meaning (thus interpreting earlier \nteachings as having only an implied meaning (neyārtha),\nwhich is only made explicit (nītārtha) in the \nlatter texts of the Mahāyāna, and in particular of the \nYogācāra tradition); second, Vasubandhu, relies on the dual\naspect theory of cognition with its internalist perspective (which \nregards the appearance of objectual aspects in cognition as the \nresult of residual traces stemming from the receptacle consciousness)\n(see VVS ad 10). \n\nHowever, Vasubandhu's most compelling proof for idealism appeals to \nthe method of mereological reduction: wholes, being merely \ncollections of minimal parts, do not actually exist as perceived. But\nwholes, which are extended objects, must necessarily be made of \nparts, the ultimate building blocks of which are the atoms. And since\natoms, conceived as partless point-instant are ultimately \ninsubstantial, the realist argument for the existence of material \nobjects as conglomerates of parts must be false (VVS ad \n11–14; for detailed discussion of some of these arguments, see \nKapstein 1988; Tola & Dragonetti 2004, 98–110; Gold 2006). \n\nVasubandhu's refutation of the reality (and causal efficacy) of \nexternal objects as spatio-temporal entities raises some \nimportant mereological issues and has a number of consequences for \nperception: \n\nIn his Investigation of the Cognitive Support Dignāga\ntakes up, as the title suggests, one of the specific issue debated by\nVasubandhu in his Twenty Verses: what exactly should count as\nan object of cognition? Dignāga's definition of the cognitive\nsupport invokes the principle of the concomitance of cause and effect\n(kāryakāraṇabhāva). Thus, for an object\nto count as a support (ālambana) for cognitive awareness\nit must (i) produce a cognition, and (ii) that cognition must take the\nform of the object (see APV ad Iad). In large measure\nDignāga follows Vasubandhu's line of argumentation in his\nrefutation of the realistic atomism of the Vaibhāṣikas (and\nof the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika tradition). His innovations\nconsist mainly in appealing to the principle of the coexistence of\ncause and effect and to the Yogācāra theory of mental\naspects. As proof that internal aspects, which provide a basis for\ncognition, arise simultaneously with cognition itself, Dignāga\ncites the principle of the concomitance of cause and effect\n(kāryakāraṇabhāva): although the causal\nrelation is understood sequentially, by virtue of the necessary\ndependence of cause and effect, whenever a cause is present its effect\nmust also be present. The theory of cognitive aspects serves to\nfurther demonstrate that it is the appearance of an internally\ncognizable aspect that is the actual cognitive support. Because\ncognitions which arise taking the form of an apparently external\nobject are the determining factor for the arsing of subsequent\ncognitions, the external object (say, a visible entity) and the sense\nfaculty (visual sense) are merely projective aspects of this initial\naspectual cognition (APV ad VII b).  \n\nThus, Dignāga effectively argues that cognition arises bearing \ntwo aspects: that of the object and that of the cognition itself, \nsuch that cognition and cognized object are not different: they are \nboth manifestations of cognitive awareness itself. \n\nWhether the Yogācāra ontology of mind is idealist or can be\ninterpreted as a type of phenomenalism depends of course on how one \ninterprets one of its key technical concepts: the \nvijñapti-mātra (lit. ‘cognition only’\nor ‘nothing but cognition.’). May (1971) and Schmithausen\n(1973) are among the strongest proponents of the idealist\ninterpretation. Schmithausen in particular claims that the idealist\nformulation arose not out of purely theoretical or doctrinal concerns,\nbut rather as a generalization based on the insights derived from\nmeditative practice. In an innovative metaphilosophical essay on\nWestern idealism as seen through Yogācāra eyes, Garfield\n(1998) argues that idealism is a contrastive ontology, in which mind\nand mental constituents are assigned a fundamental reality that is\ndenied to external objects. Thus, while Berkeley, Kant, Hegel,\nSchopenhauer, and Bradley may hold different views on the nature of\nmind, they all presumably agree on its ontological primacy. Likewise,\nclaims Garfield, regardless of how Yogācārins like\nVasubandhu conceive of the mind, to the extent that they ascribe to it\nany sort of ontological primacy over external objects, they are\nidealists in this contrastive ontological sense. \n\nWayman (1965) is perhaps the first scholar to have challenged the\nidealist interpretation of the Yogācāra notion\nof vijñapti-mātra routinely advanced by both\nhistorical opponents, such as the Mādhyamikas and orthodox\nBrahmanical philosophers, as well as by early generations of Buddhist\nscholars. His argument is that Yogācārins like Vasubandhu do\nnot really deny the reality of external objects; rather, they simply\ncontent that cognitive activity can arise even in the absence of an\nexternal object. Wayman's critique (reprised in Wayman 1996) has set\nthe platform for an entire generation of scholars who have argued\nagainst the idealist interpretation of Yogācāra ontology\n(see Kochumutton 1982; Kalupahana 1987; Powers 1996; Lusthaus 2002;\nDunne 2004).  \n\nThere is no general consensus at present on how best to\nrepresent the metaphysical position of the Yogācāras:\nproposals vary from realistic pluralism, to pragmatism, neutral\nmonism, epistemic idealism, to a realist phenomenology on the model of\nHusserl and Merleau-Ponty.  Alternative interpretations present the\nYogācāra school as a system\noutlining a “therapeutic course of action (ācāra)\nrooted in meditation (yoga)” (Anacker 1984, 194) or as providing\nan account of the “unconscious structuring of experience”\n(Waldron 2002; 2003: xi). \n\nSomething analogous to a phenomenalist stance is adopted by the \nSautrāntikas. In the commentary portion to the \nTreasury of Higher Knowledge Vasubandhu, arguing from the\nperspective of the Sautrāntikas, provides a phenomenalist account\nof experience. On this view, form does not refer to the material\naspect of an independently existing entity but rather to how it is\nphenomenally disclosed in perception. Form is thus defined as\nsomething that can either be disrupted by impact or as something that\nopposes resistance (pratighāta). However, these\nproperties do not extend to the atoms themselves, which form the\nbuilding blocks of materiality. Although as monadic units the atoms\nare seen as devoid of any formal properties, as atomic compounds\n(saṃghātastha, saṃcita) the atoms\nare subject to the same properties of resistance and destruction as\nany other material entities. \n\nThe difficulty of reconciling atomism—a fundamental tenet of \nBuddhist metaphysics—with the phenomenology of perception is \napparent in early Abhidharma debates between Realists (chiefly the \nVaibhāṣikas) and the Phenomenalists (the \nSautrāntikas). The debate between the Vaibhāṣikas and\nthe Sautrāntikas on the issue of whether the sensible qualities \nof objects (viz., color, shape, etc.) supervene on the atoms is a \ntelling point. For the Vaibhāṣikas, secondary properties \nsuch as color (varṇa) are in fact substances \n(dravya) similar to the four great elements. For the \nSautrāntikas, color is a derived property that lacks the \nelemental nature of primary dharmas like fire, water, etc. \nRather, secondary properties are treated by the Sautrāntikas as \npotentialities that reside in aggregated entities. Moreover, the \nSautrāntikas conceive of atoms not as substantial impartite \nentities, but rather as the most subtle collection of material \nelements (see AKBh ad II, 22ab). \n\nOn this Sautrāntika view, as presented by Vasubandhu, perceived \nmaterial properties, both primary (e.g., solidity) and secondary \n(e.g., color) are in fact emergent properties of subtle collections \nof elements whose phenomenal properties reflect the constitution and \nfunction of the perceptual systems. For instance, fluidity in the \ncase of water may be classified both as a primary property of water \natoms and also as a secondary property reflecting a specific \nconfiguration of water atoms. The same atoms of water, when \nconfigured as ice, may produce the sensation of hardness instead of \nthat of fluidity. \n\nA phenomenal object is such that it affects an individual by \noccasioning different types of experience. For example, water causes \nthe experience of wetness and fluidity, rocks the experience of \nresistance or hardness, irregular surfaces the experience of \nroughness, etc. The material aspect of the experienced object as \nexperienced, although arising in dependence upon the activity of\nthe corresponding sense sphere, at the same time obstructs and limits\nit: a wall limits movement, night restricts vision, etc. This is the \ntypical phenomenological stance: physical entities are mind \nindependent, but we have no way of knowing how they are in themselves\napart from the way we perceive and conceive them.  \n\nAn often quoted passage from the Abhidharma literature reads: \n“One sees the blue, but one does not see ‘it is \n blue’.”[3]\n This statement captures an essential aspect of Buddhist \nphenomenalism: indirect perception, rather than providing a \ndefinitive picture of the content of non-conceptual awareness, \ninstead distorts and misrepresents this content. The Buddhist \npreoccupation with the pure datum of experience is in large measure \nmotivated by a deep suspicion of “any sort of theorizing about \nthe world that we experience” (Matilal 1986, 315). This is one \nof the main reasons why philosophers of the logico-epistemological \ntradition invite us to go beyond our ordinary language intuitions. \n\nNeither the canonical literature nor the early Abhidharma schools \nprovide detailed accounts of the means by which we may discriminate \nbetween veridical and non-veridical states of cognitive awareness. \nWorks such as the Kathāvatthu (ca. 150 C.E.) do concern\nthemselves with the rules and the various types of debate and \nconsider a wide range of views, but there is no systematic account of\nthe criteria that ensure certainty. For systematic treatments of the \nepistemological import of various states of cognitive awareness we \nmust turn to the Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition \n(pramāṇavāda) initiated by Dignāga (ca.\n480–540) and Dharmakīrti (ca. 600–660) [I will refer \nto these two thinkers, and to their followers, as \n‘epistemologists’ so as to highlight that their concerns \nare primarily epistemological]. It is generally agreed that this \ntradition sprang out of a growing preoccupation with issues of logic \nand language among those Buddhists who regarded polemical engagement \nwith their Brahmanical opponents as vital to their philosophical \nenterprise (see Frauwallner 1959, Hattori 1968, Hayes 1988, Matilal \n1998). In spearheading his model of epistemological inquiry \nDignāga (and following him, Dharmakīrti) significantly \nchanged the course of Buddhist philosophy in India.  \n\nThe two most influential works of the Buddhist logico-epistemological\ntradition are Dignāga’s Collection on Valid\nCognition (Pramāṇasamuccaya; hereafter PS)\nand Dharmakīrti’s Commentary on Valid Cognition\n(Pramāṇavārttika; hereafter PV).\nDharmakīrti’s work, essentially a commentary on\nDignāga’s, is to be singled out as one of the most\noutstanding contributions to Indian Buddhist thought, presenting a\ndefinite account of what later generations of philosophers in India\ntook to be the normative Buddhist view. Dharmakīrti influenced\nthe views of later Buddhist philosophers such as\nŚāntarakṣita (725–783), Kamalaśīla\n(740–795), Jñānagarbha (8th century), Dharmottara\n(750–810), Jñānaśrīmitra (ca.\n975–1050), Ratnakīrti (11th century)\nRatnākaraśānti (11–12th century) and\nMokṣakaragupta (1150–1202). \n\nThe Buddhist logico-epistemological enterprise rests on two \nmajor viewpoints: (i) the domains of language and conceptual thought \nare identical; and (ii) direct perception can in fact provide access \nto the simple, further irreducible, data of experience or the \nparticular as such (the svalakṣaṇa). It is \ndebatable, however, whether this position on the intrinsic validity \nof perceptual cognitions implies that the Buddhist epistemologists \npursue a kind of epistemic foundationalism (akin to that of modern \nsense datum theorists) or, rather, that they are concerned with the \nintentional character of the phenomenal contents of experience (see \nSiderits 2004, Dreyfus 1996, Tillemans 1999, 2003, Coseru 2012). \n\nPhilosophers of the Abhidharma traditions had argued that our \ncognitive propensities are beginningless, each thought being merely \nthe continuation of an endless series of previous thoughts, which \nconstantly inform, influence, and direct the cognitive process (see \nAKBh ad III, 19). They maintained that these cognitive \npropensities are most vividly manifest in traces of memory and in the\nactivity of conceptual thought. The Buddhist epistemologists, \nhowever, came to reject both memory (sṃrti) and \nconceptual elaboration (kalpanā) as reliable sources of\nknowledge. These cognitive modalities were completely dissociated \nfrom direct perception, the only type of cognitive awareness that \nDignāga regarded as warranted. \n\nThe Buddhist epistemologists adopt a parsimonious epistemology: only \ntwo sources or instruments of cognition (pramāṇa)\nare accepted are reliable: perception (pratyakṣa) and \ninference (anumāna). Dignāga gives a most basic \nreason why we ought to accept only these two sources as warranted: \nthat is, because there are only two types of objects, those bearing \ntheir own characteristic mark (i.e., particulars) and those whose \ncharacteristic is that of universality (i.e., universals), each \ncorresponding to a specific mode of apprehension (PSV ad I, \n2; Hattori 1968, 24, 79). What we have here is an attempt to \ntranslate the two fundamental categories of particular and universal \nback to their specific knowledge source: particulars to perception \nand universals to inferential reasoning. Dignāga, thus, appears \nto be claiming that all objects of cognition, whether external or \ninternal, cannot be properly understood if separated from the types \nof cognitive events in which they are instantiated, a view best \ndescribed as phenomenalism. \n\nThe Buddhist epistemologists limit warranted perception to direct,\nunmediated experience only. Perception is regarded as necessarily\ninvolving contact (sparśa, sannikarṣa)\nbetween the sense and the object. Dignāga (following Vasubandhu)\nnotes that perception is named after the sense rather than after the\nobject (see AKBh ad I, 45ab). Thus perception, following the\nsense rather than the object, cognizes inexpressible particularities\nor the object as a particular domain of experience. Indirect\nperception, which is usually understood as involving some degree of\nconceptual discrimination (vikalpakajñāna) is not\ntreated as perception proper. Unlike their principal opponents, the\nNaiyāyikas and the Mīmāṃsākas, the Buddhist\nepistemologists do not regard indirect perception as an essential step\nin the transition from pure sense data to full blown conceptual\napprehension.  \n\nIn his principal work, the Collection on Valid Cognition (PS\nI, k5a-6cd; Hattori 1968, 27) Dignāga discusses what appear to \nbe three distinct types of cognition under the rubric of perception: \nsense perception, mental perception, and perception of the yogi. \nDignāga also admits self-awareness (svasaṃvedana)\nas a distinct type of cognition, although there is some debate about \nwhether this is to be interpreted as a type of perception (see \n §7.2\n for a discussion of svasaṃvedana). The disagreement \ncenters on whether self-awareness should be understood as a dual \naspect cognition (Nagatomi 1979) or as a new type of perception. \nWayman (1991), following Hattori (1968), argues that it should, \nwhereas Franco (1986, 1993) argues to the contrary. Franco bases \nhis argument on a piece of textual evidence that appears to endorse \nthe view that Dignāga takes the self-apprehension of internal \nstates such as desire to be a case of mental perception. Drawing from\nthe commentarial literature on Dignāga preserved in Chinese, Yao\n(2004) offers some compelling arguments as to why scholars, from \ntraditional commentators such as Prajñākaragupta (ca. 800) \nto Franco appear to have consistently misunderstood the relationship \nbetween self-awareness and mental perception. Yao maintains that the \nresolution to the question of whether Dignāga does or does not \naccept four types of perception depends on correctly understanding \nthe function of mental perception, which he takes to apply only to \nthe direct apprehension of mental objects (2004, 63). Thus, for Yao \nmental perception (manasa-pratyakṣa) and the mental \nfaculty of cognitive awareness (mano-vijñāna) are \nto be clearly differentiated, the first being just an aspect of the \nlatter. Likewise, self-awareness and yogic perception too are taken \nto be just different states of this mental cognitive awareness (see \nTillemans 1989; Steinkellner 1978, 1982, 1999; and Dunne 2006 for \ndiscussions of this issue). \n\nBoth Dignāga and Dharmakīrti take objects of perception to \nhave causal efficacy (see e.g., PV III, 3). What is generally termed \nperception is said to consist in a series of distinct cognitive \nevents that are causally related. On this model of perception, \ncontact between sense and object gives rise to a perceptual image \n(ākāra) which represents the specific \ncharacteristics of that object. The relationship between the \nperceptual image and the empirical object is one of similarity \n(sādṛśya). The perceptual image is causally \ndetermined by the object, but the manner of its appearance is \ndetermined by factors that are intrinsic to cognition itself (see, \ne.g., PV III, 333–338). Although both Dignāga and \nDharmakīrti appear to adopt an empirical standpoint in regards \nto the status of external objects, their analysis of perceptual \naspects reflects an internalist epistemology that denies the ultimate\nreality of external objects (see PV III, 301–319; \n333–341; and Dunne 2004, 84–91). Dharmakīrti's \nposition regarding the reality of external objects is highly \nambivalent depending on whether he operates from a Sautrāntika \nperspective, which admits the existence of external objects, or from \na Yogācāra perspective, which denies their existence (for \ndetailed discussions of this aspect of Dharmakīrti's thought see\nDreyfus 1998, 83, 99; Dunne 2004, 53 and passim).  \n\nThere is some dispute as to whether or not Dharmakīrti retains \nthe causal model of perception in the case of internal objects. Thus,\nDreyfus (1997, 336f) takes the view that Dharmakīrti is \neffectively compelled to admit that for a perceptual aspect to \nacquire cognitive status it must be interpreted. As such, it acquires\nthe status of an internal mental representation, which Dreyfus claims\nto be “a highly uncomfortable position” for \nDharmakīrti given his commitment to the view that perception \nmust be foundational for knowledge.  \n\nIn examining Dharmakīrti’s causal model of perception, \nDunne (2004, 100) singles out numerical correspondence as the main \nissue in establishing how perceptual images come to correspond to the\nmaterial objects they represent: the perceptual image of the object \nis singular, but the object, as an extended entity, is made of an \ninfinitesimal number of particles in accord with the atomistic \nontology to which Dharmakīrti subscribes. Thus, identifying the \nprecise causal mechanism by which percepts relate to their \ncorresponding empirical objects is further complicated by \nDharmakīrti’s view of particulars. In maintaining that \nparticulars (svalakṣaṇa) are partless, \nDharmakīrti is forced to admit that in perception we apprehend a\nparticular in its entirely, something that of course is not borne by \nempirical data: ordinarily, in perceving a given object, say a \ndragonfly, we only perceive its visible parts from our unique vantage\npoint; we do not perceive it in its entirety.  \n\nIn the Commentary on Valid Cognition (PV III, 194-–224)\nDharmakīrti’s addresses the issue of whether perception, as\na source of knowledge, apprehends distinct spatio-temporal entities as\naggregated wholes or aggregation is a conceptual construct and thus\noutside the domain of perceptual awareness. Neither of these positions\nis acceptable, for Dharmakīrti, as is well known, follows\nDignāga in admiting only direct, non-conceptual types of\ncognitive awareness under the rubric of perception: thus, wholes, that\nis, entities composed or distributed over their parts, cannot be\nperceptually apprehended. Commenting on this aspect of\nDharmakīrti's philosophy of perception, Dunne (2004, 102) thinks\nthat in rejecting these two positions, Dharmakīrti effectively\nundermines his antirealist critique of the notion that perception can\napprehend real aggregated objects. In response to the objections of\nhis realist (chiefly the Naiyāyika) opponent that by admitting\nthat perception has the capacity to apprehend aggregates as unitary\nwholes he is thus forced to admit that universals too are perceptible,\nDharmakīrti replies that “aggregation” does not refer\nto the particular proper. Rather, it refers to a configuration of\nparticles such that it can causally support the arising of a\nperceptual image without that image being in any way related to the\nexternal aggregated object that supervenes on those particles (see\ndiscussion of this issue in Dunne 2004, 103 and\npassim). \n\nAs we noted above, Dignāga and, following him, Dharmakīrti \nrestrict perception to types of cognitive awareness that lack \nconceptual determination (kalpanāpoḍha). But even\ndirect perception is not always warranted, given the possibility of \nperceptual illusions. For this reason, Dharmakīrti adds a \nfurther constraint, by admitting as reliable only those perceptions \nthat lack conceptual determination and also are non-erroneous \n(abhrānta) (see \nPramāṇaviniścaya I, 252). In fact, by adding\nthe qualifier ‘non-erroneous’ Dharmakīrti is simply \nfollowing an established tradition of excluding from perception \ninstances of perceptual illusions of the sort produced by, say, the \nrapid rotation of a firebrand, or cases of sensory impairment as in \ncataracts. For perceptions to be reliable their object must be \ncausally effective. The Buddhist epistemologist solves the problem \nof the efficacy of perceptions by adopting a representationalist \nstance: perception can only reveal its object by assuming its form. \nThus, an intermediary realm of cognitive aspects \n(ākāra) is posited between perception and \nconception. \n\nAttempts to define the nature of these cognitive aspects and their \ncognitive function are the origin of a lengthy dispute that cuts \nacross doctrinal and scholastic boundaries. Thus Dignāga and \nDharmakīrti follow the Sautrāntika and Yogācāra \nBuddhists who maintain that cognitive awareness has an aspectual \ncharacter: that is, cognition takes the form of whatever object it \ncognizes (a position known as \nsākārāvāda). The Vaibhāṣikas \nand some Mādhyamikas take the opposite view: consciousness is \nmirror-like in its nature, reflecting an object without being \nmodified by it (cf. Kajiyama 1965, 428; Moriyama 1984; Tillemans \n1990, 41f). The representational model of cognition adopted by the \nepistemologists resembles Western variants of representationalism as \nproposed by, among others, Descartes and Locke. \n\nFor Dignāga and Dharmakīrti the apprehension of a \nresemblance (sādṛśya) between different \nobjects, which marks the transition from an indistinct perceptual \nexperience to a distinct cognitive awareness, is in itself a form of \nconceptual elaboration. In keeping with the Abhidharma traditions, \nthe epistemologists admit that perception is mediated by our internal\npropensities as well as by the range of our perceptual systems. However,\nthey do not accept the reality of resemblance relations, even though \nthey admit that cognitive aspects (specifically those by which an object is \napprehended) are pragmatically effective. A difficulty arises when \nattempting to explain extension in the case of empirical objects, \nwhich are apprehended by means of a cognitive aspect. This difficulty\nis overcome by adopting the Yogācāra perspective on the \nself-revealing (svaprakāśa) nature of cognitive \nawareness. On this perspective, each instance of cognitive awareness \nhas a dual aspect: that of a subjective appearance \n(svābhāsa) and that of an objective appearance \n(viṣayābhāsa) (see Collection on Valid \nCognition, PS I, k9a; Hattori 1968, 28). The subjective aspect \n(grāhakākāra) denotes the sense of \nintimation that accompanies each cognitive event, while the objective\naspect (grāhyākāra) captures the intentional \ncharacter of cognition or its object-directedness. This dual aspect \ntheory of cognitive awareness endorses the existence\nof a meta-cognitive level of analysis, which explains why cognition does \nnot happen “in the dark”; rather, it is always accompanied by \nself-intimation, by an experience of “what it is like” to\nbe apprehending a given object (cf. Ganeri 1999). \n\nBuddhist authors are divided on the issue of the possibility of \nreflexive awareness (svasaṃvedana). In general, \nphilosophers of the Dignāga-Dharmakīrti school accept the \nreality of reflexive awareness in the classical Yogācāra \nsense of self-luminosity (svaprakāśa) and support \ntheir arguments with the example of a lamp that illuminates itself \nwhile at the same time revealing other objects. However, this notion \nthat consciousness or cognitive awareness is inherently reflexive is \nrejected by Mādhyamika authors such as Candrakīrti (ca. \n600–650) and Śāntideva (fl. 8th century), who contend \nthat consciousness cannot be thought of as being inherently reflexive, even on a\nconventional level, since that would imply that consciousness is \nself-validating (see e.g., Madhyamākavatāra VI, \n74–75). Candrakīrti takes issue in particular with the \ncharacteristically Yogācāra view that the object of \ncognition is not extrinsic to cognition, but is an aspect of that \ncognition itself. \n\nBuddhist philosophers who take consciousness to be inherently reflexive are generally \nclassified in the doxographical literature as \nSākāravādins. Following Śāntarakṣita's\nOrnament of the Middle Way \n(Madhyamakālaṃkāra 11–92) five \nepistemological positions may be identified on the nature of \nconsciousness and the subject-object relation (see Kajiyama 1968; \n1978, 117–132; Blumenthal 2004, 91 and passim):  \n\nIt suffices to mention that the epistemologists, who adopt an \nontological position that most closely aligns with the \nSautrāntikas, take consciousness to be inherently reflexive \nand describe it not with the aid of mirror \nmetaphors—consciousness as a mirror reflecting back the nature of\nperceived phenomena—but rather with plastic metaphors in which \nconsciousness is said to assume the form of whatever object it \ncognizes. \n\nIt is generally agreed that the main argument for reflexive awareness\nis offered by Dignāga. As we saw above, Dignāga, following \nVasubandhu, adopts a dual-aspect theory of cognition. Ultimately, \nthe adoption of this theory reflects his commitment to an internalist\nepistemology, which he develops at length in his Investigation of\nCognitive Support. But unlike his Brahmanical opponents \n(chiefly the Naiyāyikas and the \nMīmāṃsākas), Dignāga is also committed to \nthe view that the instruments or sources of knowledge themselves (the\npramāṇas) are not different from the ensuing\ncognitions (pramāṇa-phala). This view is\nmotivated, at least in part, by a radical and essential separation of\nperception from conception. For Dignāga, as for all Buddhist\nepistemologists, only perception can provide an empirical foundation\nand a neutral ground for ascertaining the nature of particulars\n(svalakṣaṇas). \n\nDignāga's views may be summarised as follows (after his \nCollection on Valid Cognition): \n\nThe epistemologists who follow Dignāga's account of \nperception thus agree that cognitive awareness is a self-revealing \ntype of cognition. As such it accompanies (by virtue of arising \ntogether with) each perceptual event. And perception, specifically \nany type of perception lacking conceptual elaboration \n(kalpanāpoḍha), is associated with knowledge of \nparticulars. It is precisely this aspect of Dignāga's theory of \nperception that is an object of criticism by Mādhyamika \nphilosophers like Candrakīrti (see \nMadhyamākavatāra VI, 72–78), even if only \nindirectly: Candrakīrti's arguments target primarily the \nYogācāra doctrine of three natures. As explained in works \nsuch as Vasubandhu's Trisvabhāvanirdeśa and \nMadhyāntavibhāgabhāṣya, the three \nnatures or forms of existence are: \n\nFor the Yogācāras all phenomena and all aspects of the \nmental domain can be subsumed under these there natures (cf. Nagao \n1991, 62 and passim). Similarly, Dignāga's \nunderstanding of direct perception \n(nirvikalpa-pratyakṣa) as lacking any conceptual \nelaboration captures the sense of the perfected nature. \n\nAn axiomatic principle of all Madhyamaka philosophy, following \nNāgārjuna's Foundation of the Middle Way, is that \nall things, including all cognitive episodes, by virtue of being the \nproduct of cause and conditions, lack inherent existence \n(svabhāva) and are thus empty \n(śūnya). That is, nothing truly exits on its own, \nand no entity or mental state has its characteristics intrinsically. \nCandrakīrti's critique of reflexive awareness, then, targets \nthis notion that there is a class of cognitive events that are \nessentially self-characterizing: they reveal their own content \nwithout recourse to an additional instance of cognitive awareness. \nMore specifically, Candrakīrti rejects the notion that reflexive\nawareness has this unique property of giving access to the pure datum\nof experience (as Tillemans (1990: 49, n.109) observes, \nCandrakīrti does not seem to want to concede that there is a \ndifference between ‘seeing’ and ‘seeing as,’ \nand rests his criticism of reflexivity on the notion that all seeing \nis in effect seeing as). \n\nIt is precisely with the intention of answering critics like \nCandrakīrti that Śāntarakṣita identifies the \ncharacter of cognition as being contrary to insentient objects: \n“Cognitive awareness arises as something that is excluded from \nall insentient objects. This reflexive awareness of that cognition is\nnone other than its non-insentience” \n(Tattvasaṃgraha 2000). In effect, \nŚāntarakṣita simply follows Dharmakīrti's \ncritique of the physicalist claim that consciousness arises from the \nfour elements. Dharmakīrti rejects the physicalist view on the \ngrounds that if the four elements, or a special transformation \nthereof, are the ultimate basis of consciousness, then consciousness \nought to arise whenever the elements occur, which is to say \neverywhere (see Prajñākagupta's PVBh ad II, 35; \nFranco 1997, 171f). Even if consciousness were said to arise at a \nparticular point in time, claims Dhamakīrti, it cannot arise \nfrom something that is not sentient. \n\nSimilarly, Dharmottara, as an innovative interpreter of \nepistemologists’ account of the reflexive nature of awareness, \nclarifies the issue by invoking in his Commentary on \nDharmakīrti's Drop of Reasoning \n(Nyāyabinduṭikā; hereafter NBṬ) the \nintentional character of cognition: what sets apart the occasioning \nof a cognitive event is that it accomplishes more that the causal \nprocess by which it arises allows for it—that is, it \naccomplishes its goal by revealing the object as the pragmatic \noutcome of cognition (NBṬ ad I, 1, 4.1). \nDharmottara contrasts the intentional character of cognitive \nawareness with merely causal accounts of generation, such as is the \ncase with seeds and sprouts: “Sprouts are not established [as \nthe result] though their production is invariably concomitant with \n[causes like] seeds. Thus, even though a cognition arises as \nestablishing a given object, it has the function of causing it to \narrive as [its object] necessarily, by means of which its goal is \naccomplished.” (NBṬ ad I, 19, 14.21). Elsewhere,\nDharmottara explains that the relation between cognition and object \ncognized is unlike that of elements in a causal chain, which exist as\nthe relation between producer and produced. Rather, it is like the \nrelation between the establishing factor and what it has established \n(vyavasthāpravyavasthāpakabhāva), that is, \nbetween reflexive awareness and the intentional object as intended \n(NBṬ ad I, 19, 15.3). \n\nFor the epistemologists, then, consciousness as reflexive \nawareness is not just another phenomenon in the chain of \ndependently arising phenomena: rather, it is precisely that which has\nthe unique function of disclosing itself in the process of revealing \nthe other. For as Dharmakīrti declares in the Ascertainment \nof Valid Cognition (PVin I, 55): “If ascertaining were not\nitself [directly] perceived, the perception of objects would not be \nestablished.” \n\nThe Indian Buddhist account of reflexive awareness has also been\ninterpreted as corresponding to certain positions in Western\nphilosophy. Thus, Paul Williams (1998, 234f) notes that\nŚāntarakṣita's assertion of the unity of consciousness\nas reflexive awareness goes against the sort of reductive explanation\nof cognition that discriminates between agent, act, and object or\ncognizer, cognized, and cognizable. As such, it parallels Aristotle's\nview of reflexivity as found in De Anima and, more recently,\nthe views of Brentano and Sartre, who contend that to talk about\nconsciousness as lacking self-intimation effectively amounts to\naltogether denying the possibility of conscious awareness itself [for\na defense of the Madhyamaka critique of the notion of reflexive\nawareness, drawing primarily from the reception of this debate in\nTibet see Garfield 2006]. Similarly, Arnold (2005a, 88; 2005b, 78)\nproposes that the Indian philosophical debates concerning the nature\nof svasaṃvedana, which he translates as apperception,\nparallel Kant's discussion of the transcendental unity of\napperception, and indeed post-Kantian debates on the precise meaning\nof this doctrine. Contrasting Dharmakīrti's views on reflexive\nawareness with Husserl's account of intentionality Dreyfus (2007, 109)\nargues for the notion that perception, at least in meditative states,\ndisplays something like a phenomenal type of intentionality. Recently,\nDignāga's understanding of reflexive awareness\nhas also been interpreted as being analogous to the notion of embodied\nself-awareness developed by Merleau-Ponty in his phenomenological\naccount of perception (see Coseru 2012). On this view, the intentional\ncharacter of reflexive awareness may be understood as corresponding to\nthe immediate sense of embodied agency that is characteristic of\ninternal states such as desire, pain, etc. ","contact.mail":"coseruc@cofc.edu","contact.domain":"cofc.edu"}]
