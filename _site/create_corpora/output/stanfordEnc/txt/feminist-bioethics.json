Utilizing the resources of feminist philosophy,\nsocial theory and related fields, feminists have critiqued and\nextended the prevailing framework(s) of mainstream bioethics. This\narticle considers feminist criticism of mainstream bioethics, and\nchronicles the evolution and growth of feminist bioethics, considering\nthe areas of scholarship and activism that have informed it; its\nemergence as a distinctive academic sub-field; its contributions to\nthe analysis of substantive bioethical issues, bioethical theory and\nmethodology; and current, emerging and future areas of activity.\n\n\n\n\nBioethics and second wave feminism both independently gathered\nmomentum during the 1960s, a pivotal era for social transformation in\nmany areas of the world. Something that might be called the bioethics\n“movement” was first triggered by widespread protest\nagainst such gross abuses of medical authority as the Nazi\ndoctors’ experiments on unconsenting concentration camp inmates,\nculminating in the Nuremberg Doctors’ Trial of 1946 (Weindling\n2004), and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, a forty-year study of poor\nblack men with untreated syphilis in the American Deep South (Reverby\n2009). Over the decades since then bioethics has blossomed into an\ninterdisciplinary field that borrows from a cluster of interrelated\nareas of scholarship including philosophy, theology, law, medicine,\nand the social and biological sciences, and that (in the United States\nin particular) has become highly professionalized. Bioethics has\ngenerated a massive literature ranging over a broad array of moral\nproblems that arise within biomedical and life science research, the\nhealthcare professions, and the institutions and bodies that deliver\nhealthcare services. Increasingly, its remit goes beyond what are\ntraditionally deemed medical topics to include public health issues\nand areas of social care that interact with medical and life\nsciences. Its reach extends from the beginning to the end of human\nlife, to areas of biology and genetics on which medicine draws, to\nresearch that seeks to expand the knowledge base of medicine; and many\ncontemporary bioethicists are also interested in the societal impacts\nof the life sciences in general. In some countries bioethicists now\nalso enjoy considerable professional prestige. Some serve on public\npolicy panels and in medical school faculties, and others have been\nengaged as consultants to industry. Conferences introduce newcomers to\nthe field and disseminate recent bioethical scholarship. Many\nprofessional medical and allied health organizations require bioethics\ntraining for certification, while regulations in the United States and\nother countries now expect medical schools to include research ethics\nin their curricula. A few bioethicists have even become media\ncelebrities. And as the field of bioethics has professionalized and diversified,\nquestions have arisen about its direction and focus. Notwithstanding\nits early attention to instances of exploitation and abuse, some\ncritics have discerned an increasing conservatism in bioethics that\nneglects the concerns of marginalized groups. These critics argue that\nwith institutionalization, bioethics is losing sight of its radical\norigins (Holmes 1999; Purdy 2001; Eckenwiler and Cohn 2007).\nBioethicists are tending to frame issues and formulate theory from the\nvantage point of privileged social and professional groups, even in\nthe developing regions of the world as local bioethicists there seek a\nshare in the prestige of high technology medicine (Salles and Bertomeu\n2002; Luna 2006). During the 1980s, feminists in particular argued\nthat bioethics was developing in a way that gave too little attention\nto gender-specific disparities in healthcare research and therapy, or\nto the effects of other power disparities, such as class and\nethnicity, on quality of healthcare. By the early 1990s, feminist bioethics had emerged as a distinctive\nacademic concentration offering sustained critique of mainstream\nbioethics. These critiques evolved out of several lines of influence.\nOne was the late twentieth century women’s health movement.. In\nthe early years of second wave feminism, activist feminists directed\nattention to areas of health care where women’s interests were\nmost obvious, and yet were severely neglected: access to birth control\nand abortion, pregnancy, and the control of representations of female\nsexuality. An upsurge of concern about sexist biases in medical\nresearch and practice was rekindled by the protest movements of the\n1960s and awareness of the increasing medicalization and\ncommodification of women’s bodies. Public notice of the\nwidespread and, it has to be said, continuing under-representation of\nwomen in clinical trials increased that momentum (Baylis, Downie and\nSherwin 1999). Feminists campaigned on clinical issues with direct\nrelevance to women’s biology: for increased research into breast\ncancer, more convenient and cheaper contraceptive methods, more\nresearch into the physiology of menopause, and the avoidance of\nunnecessary surgical interventions (e.g., hysterectomies, cesarean\nsections, radical mastectomies) where less alternatives are available.\nThese campaigns were supported by several advocacy groups in the\nUnited States, United Kingdom and elsewhere, and later on by a number\nof global women’s health movements. These groups and movements\nstruggled to raise public awareness of women’s health issues,\ninfluence national health policy, and act as a counterbalance to the\npriorities of professional medicine and the pharmaceutical\nindustry. Engaging with these activist concerns, feminists drew on late\ntwentieth century scholarship in feminist moral and social theory that\nutilizes sex, gender, and other marginalizing characteristics as\ncategories of analysis that are bound up with power relations across\npublic and private life. (Alison Jaggar’s 2001 Encyclopedia\nof Ethics entry on “Feminist Ethics” provides an\nexcellent summary of many of the key features of second wave feminism\nthat influenced feminist bioethics.) This research called attention to\nthe need for theoretical grounding to provide a framework for\npractical strategies to curtail oppressive practices in medicine and\nhealthcare.  It is within this context of attention to practical\nissues combined with the drive to provide a conceptual underpinning\nfor analysis and, ultimately, reform, that the emergence of feminist\nbioethics should be understood. Feminists working in bioethics today\nspeak in many different voices, reflecting their disparate social\npositioning and academic backgrounds, and the new global reach of the\nfield.  Nonetheless, they share significant commonalities, both in\ntheir criticisms of dominant structures and in their efforts to build\na more adequate framework that is responsive to the diversity of the\ncircumstances of women and other groups. In doing so they call\nattention to neglected voices that are seldom represented within\nmainstream bioethics. Notably, feminist discourse highlights the way\nin which hierarchical rankings that categorize people by sex, race,\nethnicity, age, disability, or susceptibility to genetic disease, can\nperpetuate unjust practices in health and social care, research, and\npublic health. Some feminists integrate cross-disciplinary analysis of\nstructural and social frameworks that divide and marginalize people\nwith insights from the women’s health movement, others\nconcentrate their analysis on a specific axis of oppressive practice,\nbut all recognize interrelationships among such practices. Feminist critique also addresses the fundamental theory of\nmainstream bioethics. Feminist-friendly bioethicists have noted\nsystemic weaknesses in the explanatory framework that grounds the\nbioethical analysis of research and clinical practices and\nincreasingly also of public health measures. Critics fault both the\nabstract character of much bioethical theory and inattention to such\nkey components of morality as the contexts that frame health care and\nthe relational networks that inform patient decision making. The\ntendency to ground theory in a set of abstract principles that are\nonly subsequently applied to practical problems makes it easy to\nignore (bio)ethically relevant particulars such as the unequal burden\nborne by women by virtue of their conventional reproductive and\nnurturing roles, or inequities between social and economic\ngroups. Finally, some feminist theorists are developing alternative\nmethodologies to remedy the epistemological shortcomings of the\ndominant bioethical model of reasoning. By the 1980s bioethics as a discipline was growing, courses were\nproliferating and increasing the market for bioethics texts, but the\nmarginalization of feminist perspectives persisted in both course\ntexts and bioethics journals. Essays by feminists in the leading texts\nwere limited primarily to treatment of reproductive issues such as\nabortion and maternal-fetal relations. Less initial attention was\ngiven to interconnections between these issues and more pervasive\nbioethical concerns such as the limits of physician authority,\nconflicts between commercial interests and patient wellbeing, or the\nconflation of moral and medical values. In these early days, feminist\ncommentary on innovative reproductive interventions was also beginning\nto appear (e.g., Arditti, Klein and Minden 1984; Corea 1985; Stanworth\n1987; Rapp 2000). In 1992 a collection of articles previously\npublished in the journal Hypatia was brought out\nas Feminist Perspectives in Medical Ethics (Holmes and Purdy\n1992). Susan Sherwin published No Longer Patient: Feminist Ethics\nand Health Care, the first book-length treatment of feminist\nbioethical theory (1992).  To bring attention to disregard of feminist\nperspectives, Susan Wolf undertook a project at the Hastings Center\nwhich led to the anthology Feminism and Bioethics: Beyond\nReproduction (1996). This collection incorporates feminist\nperspectives on many issues that had seldom been discussed in standard\ncourse texts, including the under-representation of women subjects in\nmedical research, the pervasive influence of the abstract\nindividualistic conception of personal autonomy, and stigmatizing\nportrayals of HIV-positive women.  At around the same time Susan Bordo\n(1993) and Mary Mahowald (1993) published volumes critiquing medical\nand cultural attitudes toward women’s bodies. Susan\nWendell’s The Rejected Body (1996) pressed this theme\nfurther, integrating the experiences of disabled people into\ndiscussions of bodily life. A further milestone in the development of\nfeminist bioethics was the publication of Rosemary\nTong’s Feminist Approaches to Bioethics: Theoretical\nReflections and Practical Applications (1997). Gradually, mainstream bioethics journals and organizations began to\nrecognize feminist approaches. Several journals featured special\nissues by feminist scholars spanning a cluster of topics including\nAIDS, reconfiguration of the principle of autonomy, gender issues in\npsychiatry, and the global dimensions of feminist bioethics. Bioethics\nconferences in a number of countries began to schedule sessions that\nexplicitly addressed feminist approaches and topics, and more\nfeminists were included on the general program, while the market for\nmore feminist-friendly teaching texts has expanded and publishers have\nbeen responsive (see e.g., Teays and Purdy 2001; Fulford, Dickenson\nand Murray 2002; Baylis, Downie, Hoffmaster and Sherwin 2004; Singer\nand Viens 2008). These and similar efforts resulted in feminist\nwritings on an increasing diversity of substantive topics\nbeginning to appear in bioethics journals and anthologies. Feminist\ncritiques of bioethical theory also gained some currency,\nthough they tended to be classified among “alternative”\napproaches (along with communitarianism, casuistry, and the ethics of\ncare). Thus the healthcare priorities of women and other underserved\ngroups still received disproportionally little bioethical\nattention. And despite these advances, concerns persisted that\nfeminists were under-represented on governmental panels formulating\npublic policy. The strategic importance of feminist involvement at the\npolicy-making level to redress injustices and promote more equitable\npolicy choices was emphasized by Sherwin and Baylis (2003), while\nother feminists have highlighted the need to reframe public policy and\nthe research that underpins it to include the social impact of gender\nand other biases (Rogers 2006; Mahowald 2006). Coinciding with the appearance of a critical mass of feminist\nbioethics scholarship, in 1993 the International Network on Feminist\nApproaches to Bioethics (FAB) was founded to provide a congenial home\nfor feminists working in bioethics, to encourage international\ncross-fertilization, and to influence the agenda of mainstream\nbioethics. FAB aims to foster development of a more inclusive theory\nof bioethics at both the academic and grassroots levels. Three goals\nhave been central: extension of bioethical theory to integrate\nfeminist concerns; development of theory to include analyses not just\nof gender but also of class, ethnicity and other social categories;\nand creation of new strategies and methodologies that include socially\nmarginalized experiences and perspectives. The articulation of these\nobjectives represents an effort to systematize prevailing\ncommonalities among feminists working in the field and stimulate\nfurther collaborative work. FAB’s central focus includes\nadaptation of the theoretical grounding of bioethics to more fully\nreflect key components of moral life, including power differences that\nstructure physician/patient and researcher/subject relationships, the\ninfluence of wider social and institutional relationships, and\ncross-cultural perspectives on bioethical issues that reflect\nintersections between specific technologies and the social, political\nand economic structures within which they are embedded.  FAB has held its own Congress every 2 years since 1996, usually\nimmediately before the World Congress of Bioethics (WCB) organized by\nthe International Association of Bioethics, and taking themes which\nrelate to the WCB theme but giving them a particularly feminist slant.\nPapers presented at these Congresses have been published in four\nanthologies (Donchin and Purdy 1999; Tong, Anderson and Santos 2001;\nTong, Donchin and Dodds 2004; Scully, Baldwin-Ragaven and Fitzpatrick\n2010), while another volume focusing on postmodern approaches includes\na selection of papers from the 2000 FAB conference (Shildrick and\nMykitiuk 2005). To encourage more work in feminist bioethics and disseminate it\nmore widely, in 2007 FAB established its own journal,\nthe International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics\n(IJFAB).  IJFAB has provided a new forum within\nbioethics for feminist thought and debate. It is currently published\nsemiannually, and the initial issue “Doing Feminist\nBioethics” appeared in Spring 2008. IJFAB invites\nsubmissions approaching any problem or topic in bioethics from the\nresources of feminist scholarship for its open issues, and encourages\nproposals for special thematic issues that have covered topics such as\nresearch ethics, ethical issues in psychiatry, aging and long-term\ncare, disability, vulnerability, transnational reproductive travel,\nfood ethics, fitness, and climate change. IJFAB also invites\nindividual commentaries or conversations among groups of scholars on\ncontemporary problems in bioethics, as well as personal narratives\nthat illuminate topics in bioethics. From its\nbeginning, IJFAB has been committed to expanding the field of\nbioethics beyond a narrow focus on science and technology to include\nattention to public health and the social determinants of health, as\nwell as broader issues such as food, the environment, labor, or\nglobalization, that are directly related to community health. Further\ndetails on IJFAB can be found in\nOther Internet Resources. In the following sections this article turns to consider\nsubstantive issues addressed by feminist bioethics; feminist\nbioethical work on bioethical theory; and feminist contributions to\nbioethical methodology. What follows is not intended to be an exhaustive list of\nsubstantive topics, past and present, in feminist bioethics, but\nrather an indication of some central and longstanding areas of\ninterest, directions in which these might be going, and examples of\nareas where feminist bioethics has brought a fresh and, feminists\nwould argue, valuable perspective. The early years of feminist bioethics were dominated by a focus on\nreproductive issues, which were seen as being of particular salience\nto women and an area of life within which women are commonly\ndiscriminated against and oppressed. The focus is understandable, not\nleast because it is often easier for non-feminist bioethicists to see\nreproductive issues as “feminist” simply by virtue of the\nfact that both biologically and socially they tend to affect women\nmore than men. It is important to realize, however, that the early\nwork on abortion, surrogacy or assisted conception is identified as\nfeminist not simply because it addressed issues that reflect\nwomen’s interests, but because a feminist framework brought a\ndistinctive approach to the examination of reproductive medicine and\nassisted conception: distinctive not just in taking the experiential\nperspective of women rather than men, but analytically in having an\neye to the structural and interpersonal power differentials that shape\nboth the experience and the delivery of these technologies in many\ndifferent societies and cultures across the globe. For example,\nseveral authors have critiqued the oversimplified dichotomization\nbetween the popular slogans “pro-life” and\n“pro-choice” in the abortion debate (Sherwin 2008;\nTooley et al. 2009). A key insight of feminist bioethics is\nthat, because women bear a disproportionate share of the associated\nrisks and burdens, new reproductive technologies are not gender\nneutral, a fact frequently ignored in debates about the ethics of\nassisted reproduction. The assessment of the social and ethical implications of\nreproductive medical innovations persists, growing ever more complex\nwith the proliferation of techniques to generate, test and manipulate\nembryos (e.g., Gupta 2000; Shanley 2001; Kukla 2005; Mullin 2005;\nHarwood 2007; the issue of Bioethics on reproductive autonomy\nedited by Carolyn McLeod 2009; Baylis and McLeod 2014). Two concerns\nremain paramount: that the availability of genetic testing and\nscreening technologies in the context of reproductive medicine exerts\npressure on women (and men) to utilize prenatal techniques to produce\nonly “perfect” children (Rapp 2000; Rothman 2001) and that\nas it becomes easier to identify impairments prenatally, and prevent\nthe birth of children with those impairments, the stigma experienced\nby disabled children and by their families will increase. Authors\nvoice concern that future development of enhancement techniques,\nwhether genetic or other, will exacerbate these tendencies and pose\neven greater threats to social equality, alongside the health benefits\nthey may offer. Many of these issues overlap with others, such as the\nimpact of caregiving responsibilities on the caregiver, and the effect\nof particular economic policies on socially marginalized groups. Branching off from looking at reproductive issues per se\nis feminist bioethics’ significant and distinctive contributions\nto the bioethical analysis of the donation of reproductive tissues,\nfor research or for reproductive purposes. Feminist bioethics’\ninsight into the politics of the use of eggs, embryos and other\nreproductive tissues in medicine and research, including stem cell\nresearch, a key topic in in the bioethical landscape of the last\ndecade, opens up questions about the potential exploitation of women\nand women’s bodies—and the meaning of\n“exploitation” in complex worlds in which therapy and\nresearch overlap (Nisker et al. 2010; Tremain 2006). Donna\nDickenson (2007) in particular is noted here for her extensive work on\nproperty and ownership of the body and body parts, as is Cathy Waldby\nfor her examination of the global economy of reproductive tissues\n(Waldby and Mitchell 2006; Cooper and Waldby 2014). A further area of strong feminist bioethical interest is the\ninteraction between medicine, health status, and family and social\ncare. Feminist bioethicists have argued that there are legitimate\nquestions to be asked about the scope of and justification for claims\nabout the forms of care offered, and the balance between individual,\nfamilial, state and commercial suppliers of medical and social care.\nThese questions are being asked more widely in mainstream bioethics,\nprompted by longterm changes to the shape of family life across\ndifferent societies and, as a result, the way families interact with\nmedical and social care. At the same time, the demographic changes\nleading to aging populations are combining with economic and political\nforces to drive the retrenchment of health and welfare structures\nacross many western countries. As a result, care responsibilities are\nincreasingly falling back onto families, and implicitly onto\ntraditional family structures in which responsibility for the care of\ndependent members is assumed to lie with women members of the family.\nFeminist critics have pressed for both empirical and normative\nconsideration of familial versus societal responsibilities in the\nareas of health and other forms of care, asking critical questions\nabout how these responsibilities come to exist and are enacted in a\nrange of situations. In 2011 a group of leading scholars, both\nfeminist and others, established an international consortium,\nthe Network of Ethics of Families, specifically to provide a\nmore robust theoretical ethical framework in this area (Verkerk et\nal. 2014, in Other Internet Resources). Feminist scholars have also called for greater clarity about the\nmeaning of care (or sometimes, dependency) work and who it is done by,\nwarning against the conflation of the types of care performed by\nnurse, nurse-aides, home helps, and family members, and equally\nagainst the invisibility of the unpaid care work provided by family\nmembers compared to the world of (even relatively low-) paid care\nwork. Noting the gendered nature of much longterm care work, a number\nof feminist bioethicists (Tong 2009; Lanoix 2013a,b) have been\nexamining the ethics of the national and international arrangements of\ncare for children, elderly and chronically ill people, and the\nassociated development of international migrant care work (Weir 2008;\nEckenwiler 2011, 2013). Bioethics overall has seen an explosion of interest in public\nhealth ethics, distinct from the more clinically-focused ethical\nquestions that dominated the field in its early decades. In many ways,\nthe central perspectives and current concerns of public health ethics\nwere long anticipated by feminist health care movements and feminist\nbioethics. Public health ethics is concerned with the multiple\nactivities of public health, carried out by a range of health\nprofessionals and agents, and is necessarily concerned with health\ninequities both nationally and globally, how they operate and how they\ncan be minimized or eradicated in public health, but also crucially\nbringing a broader perspective that includes an interest in how these\ninequities come about in the first place. As Rogers notes, a feminist approach leads us to examine not only\nthe connections between gender, disadvantage, and health, but also the\ndistribution of power in the processes of public health, from policy\nmaking through to programme delivery. (Rogers 2006: 351; Baylis, Kenny\nand Sherwin 2008) The increasing interest in public health\n research ethics in general has also led to some work focusing\n specifically on women’s interests and vulnerabilities (e.g.,\n Macklin 2011). A notably vibrant and fruitful strand of feminist bioethics\nengagement in the early twenty-first century has been with issues of\nembodiment and particularly disability. As Baldwin-Ragaven and Scully\n(2010) note, feminist bioethics has necessarily contained a\nlongstanding discussion about what it means bioethically to have/be a\n“non-standard” body, given that the female body has\ngenerally been seen as nonstandard within the biomedical and\nbioethical contexts. Feminist bioethical scholarship has sometimes\noverlapped with the growing company of feminist disability scholars,\nmany of whom write about disability as a form of embodied social\nexclusion that can intersect or synergize with gender. This engagement\nhas produced a body of work that problematizes the construal of the\nimpaired body in bioethics as a problem to be solved by biomedical\nmeans and for which the key bioethical issues are to do with\nregulating the technologies that can be applied to prevent or cure\ndisability (Silvers, Wasserman and Mahowald 1998; Fine and Asch 1988;\nParens and Asch 2000; Wong 2002; Tremain 2005; Scully 2008; Ho 2011;\nHall 2011). A special issue of IJFAB on disability appeared\nin 2010 (volume 3, number 2).  There has also been rich theoretical\nwork on the social and cultural expectations of normality, and the\npolitical choices that are made in the area of prevention of and\nsupport for disabled people, contributed through feminist discussion\nof the norms of dependency (Kittay 1999) and vulnerability (Scully\n2014). A different slant on embodiment is provided by the existing and\ngrowing body of feminist work on medicalization, particularly the\nmedicalization of non-standard embodiments or embodied states and\ntheir classification as pathologies, and the questions of autonomy and\nchoice that such medicalization raises (Purdy 2001, 2006; Garry 2001).\nFeminists writing in this area include Alison Reiheld (2010) and Laura\nGuidry-Grimes and Elizabeth Victor (2012). The pathologization of the\nobese body and its relationship to fat stigma and cultural beauty\nstandards has been extensively discussed on the IJFAB blog,\nwhile other sites of attention are the medicalization of intersex\n(M. Holmes 2008; Feder 2014) and of altered states of consciousness\n(Harbin 2014). Feminist bioethics has also generated a growing body of\nwork on transgendered embodiment (Draper and Evans 2006; J.L. Nelson\n2014), Given a history in which women’s voices and experiences have\nfrequently been discounted as “mad”, it is perhaps not\nsurprising that feminist bioethics has also pioneered the critical\nethical examination of mental health issues, in particular the role of\npsychiatry and its treatment of women. Revealingly, as early as 2001\nthe Journal of Medicine and Philosophy published a special\nissue devoted to feminist bioethics and containing some key \npapers on psychiatric issues (volume 26, number\n4). In a special issue of IJFAB (volume 4, number1, 2011)\nseveral authors examined questions of mental health and\nillness. Again, this scrutiny is not unique to feminist bioethics;\nwhat is distinctive is the way these issues are refracted through a\nfeminist lens that pays close attention to thorny questions of power,\nauthority and the silencing of anomalous voices.  Especially pertinent\nin this area is the question of epistemic power—judgments about\nthe validity of subjective experiences, symptoms, or perceptions that\nmay lie outside the norm—with a close eye to the power of\ninstitutions such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), and\nwhat some critics see as the pharmaceutical industry’s\nproblematic investment in the medicalization of people’s\ndistress. As the preceding discussion illustrates, feminists have\nparticipated in scholarly discussion of virtually all the major topics\nin bioethics.  Their contributions are distinctive not least because\nof the foundational relationship of feminist scholarship to activism,\nwhich means that the scholarly treatment of these topics is grounded\nin a critique of the background norms and conditions that produce\nobservable and persistent injustices in medicine and healthcare. This\nis one reason why feminist bioethical theory tends to have a practical\norientation. Its criticisms most characteristically address the\nadequacy of mainstream bioethical theory that emphasizes universal\nmoral principles framed abstractly, individualistically and isolated\nfrom context (the most widely cited example of such a theoretical\nframework is Beauchamp and Childress’ Principles of\nBiomedical Ethics). Though some feminist criticism objects to any\nattempt to formulate universal principles at all, most is more\ncircumscribed, directed principally against theoretical frameworks\nthat presuppose a generic individual subject that is abstract,\ndisembodied and socially disembedded, in a way that has enabled\nmorally relevant particulars to be ignored, and that privileges the\nperspective of an elite, historically mostly male group (Walker\n2008). Feminist critics point out that this theoretical orientation\ngenerally has the consequence of justifying the prevailing status\nquo, thereby inhibiting any real consideration of social\nchange. Feminist bioethics’ theoretical approaches also take some\ndistinctive approaches to ontology and epistemology that challenge\ntraditional philosophical positions on the way that knowledge,\nsubjectivity and moral agency are mobilized within ethical discourse.\nThe search for a more satisfactory moral grounding for bioethics has\ntaken feminist scholars in several directions. A few favor dispensing\nwith principles entirely and reconstituting bioethics through\nnarrative case-specific interpretation along the lines pioneered by\nNel Noddings (1984) and her followers. Others, without going this far,\nare nevertheless convinced that narrative approaches have useful\napplications in bioethics (e.g., H.L. Nelson 2001). Yet others have\ncriticized the abstract universal approach to theory construction from\nthe perspective of European thought (e.g., Mary Rawlinson 2001);\nnoting the masculine markings of the allegedly generic human subject\nin philosophy, they decry the failure of purported universalists to\nrecognize the particularities of women’s disparate conditions.\nOther groups of feminists have ventured along the different routes of\npost-structuralist and postmodern theory on the one hand (Shildrick\n1997; Shildrick and Mykitiuk 2005) and particularism (Little 2001) on\nthe other, to challenge other kinds of claim to universality . And yet\nother feminists think a framework that incorporates universal\nprinciples can and should continue to constitute one dimension of an\nadequate bioethical theory, provided that these principles are\nformulated in non-exclusionary terms that reflect the relational\ncontext and empirical realities of individual lives. Two distinct and distinctive areas of contribution to theory by\nfeminist bioethics are in care ethics/ethics of care, and in the\nconceptualization of autonomy. Originating in the work of feminist psychologist Carol Gilligan\n(1982) and the proliferation of scholarship stimulated by her\ninsights, care theorists have emphasized patterns of moral reasoning\nthat are allegedly characteristic of women—reasoning that\nprioritizes caring, relationships, and responsibilities—and\ncontrasted them with modes of reasoning that privilege justice and\nrights, and which Gilligan and her followers have taken to be more\ncharacteristic of men.  (It should be noted here, however, that the\nspecifically gendered contours of care and justice in this\nwork have been challenged by those who see the difference as more to\ndo with the forms of moral reasoning mobilized by socially and\npolitically marginalized groups, women being one of these: see e.g.,\nCortese 1990). Care theorists distrust traditional moral principles\nand emphasize the necessity of values such as love, care, and\nresponsibility to capture contextual subtleties and relational bonds\nthat are overlooked within principle-oriented ethical frameworks. Both feminists and others have voiced doubts about the capacity of\nan ethics based in care alone to address some of the concerns of\nfeminist bioethics. The first anthology to consider this\ncontroversy, Women and Moral Theory, juxtaposed some of the\nleading care theorists with critics who question the significance of a\ngender-differentiated morality and its relevance to political and\nlegal issues (Kittay and Meyers 1987). Critics acknowledge that\ngendered social structures must be taken into account, but they take\nexception to the distinction between masculine and feminist\n“voices” embedded in Gilligan’s orientation. In her\n1992 work, No Longer Patient: Feminist Ethics and Health\nCare, Susan Sherwin extends this critique of care ethics, arguing\nthat not only have its advocates too readily accommodated a tradition\nthat views women’s character as always and essentially different\nfrom men’s, but that the care orientation lacks an overt\npolitical perspective that can adequately account for and unsettle\npatterns of domination and oppression that affect women. Numerous\nother feminists have expressed reservations that overlap with\nSherwin’s concerns here, including Bartky (1990), H.L. Nelson\n(1992), Kuhse (1995), and Gould (1998). In a 1996 article titled “Rehabilitating Care”, Alisa\nCarse and Hilde Lindemann Nelson attempted to respond to leading\ncriticisms of care ethics by arguing that there are resources within\nthe ethic of care that can address each of the major problems noted by\ncritics and that can assist in developing the ethic more fully. Such\nreformulation has continued since, as feminists who support some\ndimensions of care theory integrate these features into a more\ncomprehensive moral framework that gives serious attention to issues\nof justice (Noddings 2002; Ruddick 1989; Held 1993, 1995, 2006),\nmoving care ethics beyond interpersonal problems to social and\npolitical issues that require more generalized treatment. For example,\nKittay and others call attention to the universal dimensions of\ndependency. They focus on the disproportionate prestige afforded to\nhigh-tech medicine and the low status attached to more mundane work\nthat provides necessary care to sick, elderly and disabled people\n(Kittay 1999; Kittay and Feder 2002; Eckenwiler 2014). Though caring\nvalues count heavily in providing high caliber healthcare, the caring\ntasks of medicine are often demeaned as “housekeeping\nissues” that attract little interest and even less remuneration,\nwhile “crisis issues” dominate theoretical attention and\nin practice reward their practitioners rather better. Later work has\ncontinued to bring attention to this situation, particularly as it\naffects those who require extended care. Both Jennifer\nParks’s No Place Like Home: Feminist Ethics and Home Health\nCare (2003) and Rosalind Ladd et al.’s\nanthology Ethical Issues in Home Health Care (2002) address\nquestions with exceptional import to the welfare of elderly and\ndisabled people, bringing to their task much recent feminist work on\njustice and care. In the years since then, the care needs of an aging\npopulation in most parts of the world have only increased. In\nresponse, IJFAB devoted a special issue to aging and\nlong-term care (volume 6, number 2, 2013), including key papers by\nLanoix, Kittay, Tong, Martha Holstein and others (all 2013). Related work on care has branched off in a number of\ndirections. The anthology Socializing Care builds on Joan\nTronto’s 1993 call for a political theory that integrates the\npractice of care into the qualities needed for democratic citizens to\nlive well together in a pluralistic society (Hamington and Miller\n2006). Authors in this anthology stress power imbalances embedded in\nrecent tendencies to privatize care, and the need for a public ethics\nof care. Others have applied care theory to nursing ethics (e.g.,\nKuhse 1997). Ruth Groenhout (2004) and Susan Dodds (2007) both develop\nversions of feminist bioethics that combine a care perspective with\nvirtue theory. Both Groenhout and Dodds emphasize the holistic nature\nof human persons, their particular social contexts, the centrality of\nemotional responses in ethical reasoning, and the implausibility of\njudging actions separated from the lived narratives that confer\nmeaning on them.  Groenhout draws examples from several fields\nincluding new reproductive technologies. She notes that adoption of\ncare theory here would require consideration of many factors beyond\nthe desires of particular patients, including costs and benefits to\neveryone affected by particular medical interventions, the impact of\nsuch services on other healthcare needs, and the risk that technology\nwill intensify the commodification of children and the bodily\nfunctions of the women who bear them. Scully\n(2010a) has considered care\nin the context of disability, focusing on the hidden care labor that\ndisabled people carry out for nondisabled people rather than the care\nthat disabled people receive. In recent years several feminist\nbioethicists have been working to tease out the complex connections\nbetween central moral notions of care, dependence, independence, and\nautonomy. A particularly strong line of work here focuses on\nvulnerability as a concept within bioethics (Luna 2006, 2009; Rogers,\nMackenzie and Dodds 2012). A special issue of IJFAB on\nvulnerability (volume 5, number 2, 2012) addressing a number of topics\nincluded a discussion of a global ethics approach to vulnerability,\ninjection drug use, and the particular vulnerability of pregnant\nresearch subjects. A recent collection co-edited by Catriona\nMackenzie, Rogers and Dodds (2014) has further pursued work on this\ntheme. Another major stream of feminist work addresses the construction of\na theory of autonomy that is more reflective of reality than that\ncommonly favored in the bioethics literature. Feminist critique here\nnotes first that the traditional model of autonomy is inadequate: it\ndirects no attention to the contextual details of personal experience\nor of the situations within which autonomy in real life is exercised\nto a greater or lesser degree. As Sherwin notes, we need to move away from the familiar Western\n understanding of autonomy as self-defining, self-interested, and\n self-protecting, as if the self were simply some special kind of\n property to be preserved. (Sherwin et al. 1998: 35) In a related form of decontextualization, some\nbioethicists and physicians reduce autonomy to informed consent and\nrestrict its exercise in medical practice to a patient’s\nselection of choices from a limited set of clinical options (Dodds\n2000). This formulation of the principle of respect for autonomy\nignores background conditions that patients bring to their medical\nexperience, the institutional power relationships and social contexts\nthat influence their options, and the medical research priorities\nthat shape them. Expanding on this critique Carolyn Ells adopts\nFoucault’s analysis of biopower to argue that informed choice\nmust be understood in explicitly relational terms that construe power\nrelations as diffused throughout society (2003). Ells argues here\nthat the standard conception of choice relies on a false model of\npersons that situates them outside relations of power. Once this is\nrecognized, the need for an understanding of autonomy that grapples\nwith the complexities of power relations becomes obvious. This perspective shares with care theory the conviction that human\nagents are not fundamentally single-minded, rational, self-interested\nchoice-makers but social beings whose selfhood is constituted and\nmaintained within overlapping relationships and communities.\nRecognizing the complexity of connection among individuals, their\nsocial milieu, their cultural matrix, and political position, some\nfeminists are now calling for adoption of a relational model of\nautonomy that stresses the web of interconnected (and sometimes\nconflicting) relationships that shape individuality. The key anthology\nhere, Mackenzie and Soljar’s Relational Autonomy\n(2000), contains a comprehensive introduction that characterizes\nfeminist critiques of the standard model of autonomy, and constructive\nreformulations, in more detail. The more relational view of the self\ndeveloped by feminist moral theory has clear implications for thinking\nabout autonomy. While accepting that the principle of respect for\nautonomy has been essential to the protection of individual liberty,\nincluding of course that of women, the mainstream concepts of\nautonomy, based on the picture of the self described above, has little\nrelevance to the lives of marginalized groups for whom the\npossibilities of self-determination are severely constrained by\nmaterial, social and political structures. A relational conception of\nautonomy argues that agents’ identities are formed within the\ncontext of social relationships and shaped by a complex of\nintersecting social determinants, such as race, class, gender, and\nethnicity.  (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000: 4) Early social relationships provide the\ngroundwork for the later development of self-determination. In its\nstrongest version, relational accounts argue that the activities that\nconstitute self-determination are inherently social; relationships,\nfar from undermining autonomy, provide the conditions of possibility\nfor the exercise of self-determination and self-actualization\n(Donchin 2000: 239; Scully 2008: 161–162). Other work in feminist bioethics attempts to reconfigure autonomy\nto give fuller consideration to patient agency. These approaches view\nautonomy not solely as a property possessed by all competent adults\nbut also as an aspirational achievement that requires moral\ndevelopment, social cooperation, and supportive institutions. They\nemphasize the importance of encouraging the development of autonomy\ncapacities to balance disparities in education and status that distort\nphysician-patient, and other, communications. A more adequate\nconception would make visible how social norms and pressures influence\nthe choices offered to patients, and would emphasize the obligations\nof healthcare providers to actively support patient autonomy and\ndecision making. Yet other scholars have noted features beyond power relationships\nthat can affect autonomy. In addition to oppressive social\nenvironments, trauma (Brison 2001) and illness (Donchin 2000) can\neasily impair autonomy, as the body one has trusted to pursue\none’s plans and projects is shown to be vulnerable, fragile, and\nunprotected. The relationship between trust and autonomy is further\nexplored by McLeod (2002), who has presented a conception of\nself-trust within a feminist theoretical framework, thereby adding a\nnew dimension to the reframing of personal autonomy as\nrelational. Drawing her illustrations principally from reproductive\ncontexts, she argues that encounters with healthcare providers can\nundermine a woman’s self-trust, thereby threatening her\nautonomy. Conversely, providers can respect patient autonomy by\nattending to their power to influence patients’ self-trust. Her\nconceptual innovations have been extended to further healthcare\ncontexts (e.g., Goering 2009). In addition to major substantive issues and bioethical theory,\nfeminist bioethics has also made distinctive contributions to\nbioethical methodology. Feminist bioethics is characterized by shared\ntheoretical and political orientations that favor certain\nmethodological approaches, including a focus on empirical experience;\nattention to the effects of social, political or epistemic power; and\na commitment to influencing social and political change. Feminism is based on the observation that experience is gendered:\nthat is, a person’s experience can differ in significant ways\ndepending on whether that person is male or female, and attention\nneeds to be paid to that experience if these differences are not to be\nsubsumed in the discourse of the most powerful. There is therefore an\nassociated methodological bias towards methods that ground theory in\nlived experience, and that retain a sensitivity to morally relevant\ndifferences in experience that can result from gender, but also from\ndifferences in class, ethnicity, sexuality and so on. Hence although\nfeminist bioethics is not alone in doing so, it is more likely than\nmainstream bioethics to draw on empirical data or narrative and\nphenomenological accounts, in order to ensure that both description\nand normative claims are anchored in the realities of natural, social,\npolitical and institutional worlds. As a result feminist bioethics has\noften drawn on the methods of qualitative social science and health\nresearch, to capture important empirical information about the\nsituated encounter with medicine and healthcare. Feminist thought also takes seriously the existence and effects of\npower relationships of all kinds, not just those that operate most\nobviously in the medical context. This means that feminist methods\nalso have the cognitive habit of attending to the disclosure and\nexamination of social structures and practices that are oppressive and\ndisadvantageous to women, extending the examination of such power\nrelations beyond the clinic and even the healthcare system, to take\naccount of social and global economic arrangements that maintain\nentrenched patterns of social and political domination. Finally, it should also be remembered that feminist bioethics is an\nacademic discipline that, like other areas of feminist scholarship,\noriginated in and alongside a social movement which has the goal of\nachieving global justice and equality for women. Hence, feminist\nbioethics aims at going beyond the diagnosis and analysis of a\nproblem, and pointing towards a future of social and political change. Feminist bioethicists can never avoid asking the\nquestion, how does this work in the lives of real women and men,\nand in the current political frameworks in which we exist?\n(Scully 2010b: 136)\n Feminist bioethicists continue to bring new issues to bioethics,\nand fresh perspectives on existing ones. As a field, bioethics\nnecessarily must attend to the novel ethical dilemmas that are raised\nby advances in medicine and life science technologies, but also social\nand political developments that lead to transformations in healthcare\npractices. Feminist bioethics offers its own particular style of\nanalysis to the debate. Thus, as the area of public health bioethics\nmatures, so too do feminist bioethics’ contributions to\nidentifying, examining and understanding the role of gender and other\ninequalities in public health (Rogers 2006). Or, to give a very\ndifferent example, as mitochondrial donation has emerged as a\npotential means to avoid the transmission of mitochondrial disease to\nsubsequent generations, feminist bioethicists have been able to raise\nthe same sorts of critical questions about the sources of\nmitochondria, and the potential for exploitation of women in obtaining\nthem, as they have raised about the circulation of other forms of\nreproductive tissue (Baylis 2013; Dickenson 2013). In recent years feminist activists have turned their attention to\nhealth needs in developing regions of the world and the formation of\ninternational health policies. Several feminist advocacy groups have\nextended their reach to encourage recognition of universal\nhealth-related human rights. A FAB committee contributed to the 2008\nrevision of the Helsinki Declaration that specifies international\nstandards for the ethical conduct of medical research. Many of the\namendments to the Declaration originated within that committee\n(Eckenwiler et al. 2008; Goodyear et al.\n2008). Members of FAB also participated in formulation of the UNESCO\nDeclaration on Universal Norms on Bioethics (Rawlinson and Donchin\n2005). Their work is complemented by non-governmental organizations in\nnumerous developing countries. Among the foreseeable developments in years to come is a further\nincrease in feminist bioethics’ global reach. This is distinct\nfrom its (already strong) international focus: a feminist\nconsciousness not simply of the way that bioethical issues diversify\nbetween countries, but of the global economic and political systems\nthat can hold locally specific regimes of oppression and\ndiscrimination in place (see, e.g., Nie 2005). Feminist bioethicists\nhave made significant contributions to the literature on global\nissues. Collaboration between feminists in the more and the less\nindustrialized regions of the world supported the publication of four\nanthologies based on papers from international FAB conferences\n(Donchin and Purdy 1999; Tong, Anderson and Santos 2001; Tong, Donchin\nand Dodds 2004; Scully, Baldwin-Ragaven and Fitzpatrick 2010). Each of\nthese in different ways documents how dominant Western technological\npractices are crossing geographical boundaries, influencing developing\neconomies, and often diverting scarce resources from basic healthcare\nservices that could reduce preventable morbidity and mortality. Of\nparticular concern are the consequences for those who lack the power\nto alter externally imposed conditions that control their lives. The\nfirst volume calls attention to the traditional mind/body dualism,\nwhile contributors to the second volume sought to transcend the usual\ndichotomies dividing the contemporary world into developed/developing\neconomies and technological/nontechnological societies, to address a\nbroad array of concerns at the intersection of feminism and global\nissues. Some chapters focused on the tendency of science to become a\ncollective project of the international community, others on tensions\nbetween specific cultural practices and features of common humanity\nthat override geographical and cultural differences, including\nchildbirth, illness, disability, and death. The 2004 volume draws on\nand extends human rights discourse pertinent to health issues and\namplifies debate about global ethics. It takes account of\nconsiderations infrequently addressed in the bioethics literature\nincluding the economic, social, and political effects of globalized\ncapitalism, and continues the discussion of tensions between cultural\nimperialism and cultural relativism, thereby extending analysis to the\nneeds of marginalized people diversely situated within the global\neconomy. In the 2010 volume, entitled Feminist Bioethics: At the Center,\nOn the Margins, several authors grappled with the ethically\ntroubling and morally unresolved divides between the global North and\nSouth (Baldwin-Ragaven and Scully 2010). Writers in this volume noted\nthat feminist bioethics needs to respond to the voices that criticize\n(mainly Western) white female privilege, as well as to the North\nAmerican Black and Latina scholars who charged late twentieth century\nfeminist with ignoring their concerns. Feminist bioethics has from its\nbeginnings made a point of advertising its own disciplinary and\ngeographical plurality. The current website of the International\nNetwork on Feminist Approaches to Bioethics (see Other Internet\nResources) contains the following (as of December 16, 2015): FAB has worked since 1992 to create a global community of\nscholarship, debate, and action around problems in bioethics... [and]\nfosters respect within bioethics for differences among people, while\ncritically examining the effects of oppression and disadvantage.\n \nThe willingness to face squarely the theoretical, professional as well\nas political tensions that may result is an example of the critical\nand avowedly self-critical nature of feminist bioethics. Expanding moral perception is an ongoing process. As the 2010 FAB\nanthology noted, feminist bioethics is in the paradoxical position\nthat it continues to stand at the margins of bioethics, and yet many\nof its insights have been and continue to be taken up by the\nmainstream.  Examples include the so-called empirical turn in\nbioethics, or bioethics’ recent calls for greater attention to\nbe paid to public health issues. This is a double-edged\nsword. Obviously, feminists want their views to transform the\nbioethical work going on at the “center”, and yet in doing\nso there is a danger that the radical and critical edge of feminist\ncritique will lose its force. Some scholars see feminist bioethics\ntrying to take a bidirectional trajectory into the future, moving\ncloser to the heart of mainstream bioethical scholarship while at the\nsame time maintaining a home for activists and theorists working at\nthe margins, and this is likely to remain a point of tension within\nthe field (Nelson 2000).  Nevertheless, while the incorporation of some feminist\nthought has blurred the lines between mainstream and marginal\nbioethics, and calls into question feminist bioethics’ own\ndistinctiveness, it is also clear that mainstream bioethics’\nassimilation of feminism is very partial: while it may have adopted\nsome of feminist bioethics’ theoretical and methodological\napproaches, it has not taken on board its specific goals of gender and\nsocial justice. The irreducible minimum on which feminist ethics\nstands is what Alison Jaggar defined as commitment to the ideas that\n“the subordination of women is morally wrong and that the moral\nexperience of women is worthy of respect” (Jaggar 1991:\n95). This is what makes feminist contributions to bioethics\nimmediately recognizable, and powerful.","contact.mail":"jackie.scully@newcastle.ac.uk","contact.domain":"newcastle.ac.uk"}]
