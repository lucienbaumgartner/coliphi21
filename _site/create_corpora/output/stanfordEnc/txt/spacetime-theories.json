A proper understanding of motion, in particular, has been seen\nto be crucial for deciding questions about the natures of space and\ntime, and their interconnections. Since the time of Newton and\nLeibniz, philosophers' struggles to comprehend these concepts\nhave often appeared to take the form of a dispute between\nabsolute conceptions of space, time and motion, and\nrelational conceptions. This article guides the reader\nthrough some of the history of these philosophical struggles. Rather\nthan taking sides in the (alleged) ongoing debates, or reproducing the\nstandard dialectic recounted in most introductory texts, we have\nchosen to scrutinize carefully the history of the thinking of the\ncanonical participants in these debates — principally Descartes,\nNewton, Leibniz, Mach and Einstein. Readers interested in following up\neither the historical questions or current debates about the natures\nof space, time and motion will find ample links and references\nscattered through the discussion and in the\n Other Internet Resources\nsection below.\n\n\n\nThings change. A platitude perhaps, but still a crucial feature of the\nworld, and one which causes many philosophical perplexities —\nsee for instance the entry on \n Zeno's Paradoxes.\n For Aristotle, motion (he would have called it\n‘locomotion’) was just one kind of change, like\ngeneration, growth, decay, fabrication and so on.  The atomists held\non the contrary that all change was in reality the motion of atoms\ninto new configurations, an idea that was not to begin to realize its\nfull potential until the Seventeenth Century, particularly in the work\nof Descartes. (Of course, modern physics seems to show that the\nphysical state of a system goes well beyond the geometrical\nconfiguration of bodies. Fields, while perhaps determined by the states of\nbodies, are not themselves configurations of bodies if interpreted\nliterally, and in quantum mechanics bodies have ‘internal\nstates’ such as particle spin.) \n\nNot all changes seem to be merely the (loco)motions of bodies in\nphysical space. Yet since antiquity, in the western tradition, this\nkind of motion has been absolutely central to the understanding of\nchange. And since motion is a crucial concept in physical theories,\none is forced to address the question of what exactly it is. The\nquestion might seem trivial, for surely what is usually meant by\nsaying that something is moving is that it is moving\nrelative to something, often tacitly understood between\nspeakers. For instance: the car is moving at 60mph (relative to the\nroad and things along it), the plane is flying (relative) to London,\nthe rocket is lifting off (the ground), or the passenger is moving (to\nthe front of the speeding train). Typically the relative reference\nbody is either the surroundings of the speakers, or the Earth, but\nthis is not always the case. For instance, it seems to make sense to\nask whether the Earth rotates about its axis West-East diurnally or\nwhether it is instead the heavens that rotate East-West; but if all\nmotions are to be reckoned relative to the Earth, then its rotation\nseems impossible. But if the Earth does not offer a unique frame of\nreference for the description of motion, then we may wonder whether\nany arbitrary object can be used for the definition of motions: are\nall such motions on a par, none privileged over any other? It is\nunclear whether anyone has really, consistently espoused this view:\nAristotle, perhaps, in the Metaphysics; Descartes and Leibniz\nare often thought to have but, as we'll see, those claims are suspect;\npossibly Huygens, though his remarks remain cryptic; Mach at some\nmoments perhaps. If this view were correct, then the question of\nwhether the Earth or heavens rotate would be ill-formed, those alternatives being merely\ndifferent but equivalent expressions of the facts. \n\nBut suppose, like Aristotle, you take ordinary language accurately to\nreflect the structure of the world. Then you could recognize\nsystematic everyday uses of ‘up’ and ‘down’\nthat require some privileged standards — uses that treat things\ncloser to a point at the center of the Earth as more\n‘down’ and motions towards that point as\n‘downwards’. Of course we would likely explain this usage in\nterms of the fact that we and our language evolved in a very\nnoticeable gravitational field directed towards the center of the\nEarth, but for Aristotle, as we shall see, this usage helped identify\nan important structural feature of the universe, which itself was\nrequired for the explanation of weight. Now a further question arises:\nhow should a structure, such as a preferred point in the universe,\nwhich privileges certain motions, be understood? What makes that point\nprivileged? One might expect that Aristotle simply identified it with\nthe center of the Earth, and so relative to that particular body; but\nin fact he did not adopt that tacit convention as fundamental, for he\nthought it possible for the Earth to move from the ‘down’\npoint. Thus the question arises (although Aristotle does not address\nit explicitly) of whether the preferred point is somewhere picked out\nin some other way by the bodies in the universe —the center of\nthe heavens perhaps? Or is it picked out quite independently of the\narrangements of matter? \n\nThe issues that arise in this simple theory help frame the debates\nbetween later physicists and philosophers concerning the nature of\nmotion; in particular, we will focus on the theories of Descartes,\nNewton, Leibniz, Mach and Einstein, and their interpretations. But\nsimilar issues circulate through the different contexts: is there any\nkind of privileged sense of motion, a sense in which things can be\nsaid to move or not, not just relative to this or that reference body,\nbut ‘truly’? If so, can this true motion be analyzed in\nterms of motions relative to other bodies — to some special\nbody, or to the entire universe perhaps? (And in relativity, in which\ndistances, times and measures of relative motion are frame-dependent,\nwhat relations are relevant?) If not, then how is the privileged kind\nof motion to be understood, as relative to space itself —\nsomething physical but non-material — perhaps? Or can some kinds\nof motion be best understood as not being spatial changes —\nchanges of relative location or of place — at all? \n\nTo see that the problem of the interpretation of spatiotemporal\nquantities as absolute or relative is endemic to almost any kind of\nmechanics one can imagine, we can look to one of the simplest theories\n— Aristotle's account of natural motion (e.g., On the\nHeavens I.2). According to this theory it is because of their\nnatures, and not because of ‘unnatural’ forces, that that\nheavy bodies move down, and ‘light’ things (air and fire)\nmove up; it is their natures, or ‘forms’, that constitute\nthe gravity or weight of the former and the levity of the latter. This\naccount only makes sense if ‘up’ and ‘down’\ncan be unequivocally determined for each body.  According to\nAristotle, up and down are fixed by the position of the body in\nquestion relative to the center of the universe, a point coincident\nwith the center of the Earth. That is, the theory holds that heavy\nbodies naturally move towards the center, while light bodies naturally\nmove away. \n\nDoes this theory involve absolute or merely relative quantities? It\ndepends on the nature of the center. If the center were identified\nwith the center of the Earth, then the theory could be taken to eschew\nabsolute quantities: it would simply hold that the natural motions of\nany body depend on its position relative to another, namely the Earth.\nBut Aristotle is explicit that the center of the universe is not\nidentical with, but merely coincident with the center of the Earth\n(e.g., On the Heavens II.14): since the Earth itself is\nheavy, if it were not at the center it would move there! So the center\nis not identified with any body, and so perhaps direction-to-center is\nan absolute quantity in the theory, not understood fundamentally as\ndirection to some body (merely contingently as such if some body\nhappens to occupy the center). But this conclusion is not clear\neither.  In On the Heavens II.13, admittedly in response to a\ndifferent issue, Aristotle suggests that the center itself is\n‘determined’ by the outer spherical shell of the universe\n(the aetherial region of the fixed stars). If this is what he intends,\nthen the natural law prescribes motion relative to another body after\nall — namely up or down with respect to the mathematical center\nof the stars. \n\nIt would be to push Aristotle's writings too hard to suggest that he\nwas consciously wrestling with the issue of whether mechanics required\nabsolute or relative quantities of motion, but what is clear is that\nthese questions arise in his physics and his remarks impinge on them.\nHis theory also gives a simple model of how they arise: a\nphysical theory of motion will say that ‘under such-and-such\ncircumstances, motion of so-and-so a kind will occur’ —\nand the question of whether that kind of motion makes sense in terms\nof the relations between bodies alone arises automatically. Aristotle\nmay not have recognized the question explicitly, but we see it as one\nissue in the background of his discussion of the center. \n\nThe issues are, however, far more explicit in the entry on\n Descartes' physics;\n and since the form of his theory is different the ‘kinds of\nmotion’ in question are quite different — as they change\nwith all the different theories that we discuss. For Descartes argued\nin his 1644 Principles of Philosophy (see Book II) that the\nessence of matter was extension (i.e., size and shape) because any\nother attribute of bodies could be imagined away without imagining\naway matter itself. But he also held that extension constitutes the\nnature of space, hence he concluded that space and matter were one and\nthe same thing. An immediate consequence of the identification is the\nimpossibility of the vacuum; if every region of space is a region of\nmatter, then there can be no space without matter. Thus Descartes'\nuniverse is ‘hydrodynamical’ — completely full of\nmobile matter of different sized pieces in motion, rather like a\nbucket full of water and lumps of ice of different sizes, which has\nbeen stirred around. Since fundamentally the pieces of matter are\nnothing but extension, the universe is in fact nothing but a system of\ngeometric bodies in motion without any \n gaps.[1] \n\nThe identification of space and matter poses a puzzle about motion: if\nthe space that a body occupies literally is the matter of the body,\nthen when the body — i.e., the matter — moves, so does the\nspace that it occupies. Thus it doesn't change place, which is to say\nthat it doesn't move after all! Descartes resolved this difficulty by\ntaking all motion to be the motion of bodies relative to one another,\nnot a literal change of space. \n\nNow, a body has as many relative motions as there are bodies but it\ndoes not follow that all are equally significant. Indeed, Descartes\nuses several different concepts of relational motion. First there is\n‘change of place’, which is nothing but motion relative to\nthis or that arbitrary reference body (II.13). In this sense no motion\nof a body is privileged, since the speed, direction, and even curve of\na trajectory depends on the reference body, and none is singled out.\nNext, he discusses motion in ‘the ordinary sense’\n(II.24). This is often conflated with mere change of arbitrary place,\nbut strictly it differs because according to the rules of ordinary\nspeech one correctly attributes motion only to bodies whose motion is\ncaused by some action, not to arbitrary relative motion. (For\ninstance, a person sitting on a speeding boat is ordinarily said to be\nat rest, since ‘he feels no action in himself’.) This\ndistinction is important in some passages, but arguably not in those\nthat we discuss. Finally, he defined motion ‘properly\nspeaking’ (II.25) to be a body's motion relative to the matter\ncontiguously surrounding it, which the impossibility of a vacuum\nguarantees to exist. (Descartes' definition is complicated by the fact\nthat he modifies this technical concept to make it conform more\nclosely to the pre-theoretical sense of ‘motion’; however,\nin our discussion transference is all that matters, so we will ignore\nthose complications.) Since a body can only be touching one set of\nsurroundings, Descartes (dubiously) argued that this standard of\nmotion was unique. \n\nWhat we see here is that Descartes, despite holding motion to be the\nmotion of bodies relative to one another, also held there to be a\nprivileged sense of motion; in a terminology sometimes employed by\nwriters of the period, he held there to be a sense of ‘true\nmotion’, over and above the merely relative\nmotions. Equivalently, we can say that Descartes took motion\n(‘properly speaking’) to be a complete predicate: that is,\nmoves-properly-speaking is a one-place predicate. (In\ncontrast, moves-relative-to is a two-place predicate.) And\nnote that the predicate is complete despite the fact that it is\nanalyzed in terms of relative motion. (Formally, let\ncontiguous-surroundings be a function from bodies to their\ncontiguous surroundings, then x\nmoves-properly-speaking is analyzed as x\nmoves-relative-to contiguous-surroundings(x).) \n\nThis example illustrates why it is crucial to keep two questions\ndistinct: on the one hand, is motion to be understood in terms of\nrelations between bodies or by invoking something additional,\nsomething absolute; on the other hand, are all relative motions\nequally significant, or is there some ‘true’, privileged\nnotion of motion?  Descartes' views show that eschewing absolute\nmotion is logically compatible with accepting true motion; which is of\ncourse not to say that his definitions of motion are themselves\ntenable. \n\nThere is an interpretational tradition which holds that Descartes only\ntook the first, ‘ordinary’ sense of motion seriously, and\nintroduced the second notion to avoid conflict with the Catholic\nChurch. Such conflict was a real concern, since the censure of\nGalileo's Copernicanism took place only 11 years before publication of\nthe Principles, and had in fact dissuaded Descartes from\npublishing an earlier work, The World. Indeed, in the\nPrinciples (III.28) he is at pains to explain how\n‘properly speaking’ the Earth does not move, because it is\nswept around the Sun in a giant vortex of matter — the Earth\ndoes not move relative to its surroundings in the vortex. \n\nThe difficulty with the reading, aside from the imputation of\ncowardice to the old soldier, is that it makes nonsense of Descartes'\nmechanics, a theory of collisions. For instance, according to his laws\nof collision if two equal bodies strike each other at equal and\nopposite velocities then they will bounce off at equal and opposite\nvelocities (Rule I). On the other hand, if the very same bodies\napproach each other with the very same relative speed, but at\ndifferent speeds then they will move off together in the direction of\nthe faster one (Rule III). But if the operative meaning of motion in\nthe Rules is the ordinary sense, then these two situations are just\nthe same situation, differing only in the choice of reference frame,\nand so could not have different outcomes — bouncing apart\nversus moving off together. It seems inconceivable that\nDescartes could have been confused in such a trivial way.\n(Additionally, as Pooley 2002 points out, just after he claims that\nthe Earth is at rest ‘properly speaking’, Descartes argues\nthat the Earth is stationary in the ordinary sense, because common\npractice is to determine the positions of the stars relative to the\nEarth. Descartes simply didn't need motion properly speaking to avoid\nreligious conflict, which again suggests that it has some other\nsignificance in his system of thought.) \n\nThus Garber (1992, Chapter 6–8) proposes that Descartes actually took\nthe unequivocal notion of motion properly speaking to be the correct\nsense of motion in mechanics. Then Rule I covers the case in which the\ntwo bodies have equal and opposite motions relative to their\ncontiguous surroundings, while Rule VI covers the case in which\nthe bodies have different motions relative to those\nsurroundings — one is perhaps at rest in its surroundings.\nThat is, exactly what is needed to make the rules consistent is the\nkind of privileged, true, sense of motion provided by Descartes'\nsecond definition. Insurmountable problems with the rules remain, but\nrejecting the traditional interpretation and taking motion properly\nspeaking seriously in Descartes' philosophy clearly gives a more\ncharitable reading. \n\nIn an unpublished essay — De Gravitatione (Newton,\n2004) — and in a Scholium to the definitions given in\nhis 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (see\nNewton, 1999 for an up-to-date translation), Newton attacked both of\nDescartes' notions of motion as candidates for the operative notion in\nmechanics. (See Stein 1967 and Rynasiewicz 1995 for important, and\ndiffering, views on the issue; for lessons to be drawn from both see\nHuggett 2012. Newton's critique is studied in more detail in the entry\n Newton's views on space, time, and motion.) \n\nThe most famous argument invokes the so-called ‘Newton's\nbucket’ experiment. Stripped to its basic elements one\ncompares: \n \nAs is familiar from any rotating system, there will be a tendency for\nthe water to recede from the axis of rotation in the latter case: in\n(i) the surface of the water will be flat (because of the Earth's\ngravitational field) while in (ii) it will be concave. The analysis of\nsuch ‘inertial effects’ due to rotation was a major topic of\nenquiry of ‘natural philosophers’ of the time, including\nDescartes and his followers, and they would certainly have agreed with\nNewton that the concave surface of the water in the second case\ndemonstrated that the water was moving in a mechanically significant\nsense. There is thus an immediate problem for the claim that proper\nmotion is the correct mechanical sense of motion: in (i) and (ii)\nproper motion is anti-correlated with the mechanically\nsignificant motion revealed by the surface of the water. That is, the\nwater is flat in (i) when it is in motion relative to its immediate\nsurroundings — the inner sides of the bucket — but curved\nin (ii) when it is at rest relative to its immediate\nsurroundings. Thus the mechanically relevant meaning of rotation is\nnot that of proper motion. (You may have noticed a small lacuna in\nNewton's argument: in (i) the water is at rest and in (ii) in motion\nrelative to that part of its surroundings constituted by the air above\nit. It's not hard to imagine small modifications to the example to\nfill this gap.) \n\nNewton also points out that the height that the water climbs up the\ninside of the bucket provides a measure of the rate of rotation of\nbucket and water: the higher the water rises up the sides, the greater\nthe tendency to recede must be, and so the faster the water must be\nrotating in the mechanically significant sense. But suppose, very\nplausibly, that the measure is unique, that any particular height\nindicates a particular rate of rotation. Then the unique height that\nthe water reaches at any moment implies a unique rate of rotation in a\nmechanically significant sense. And thus motion in the sense of motion\nrelative to an arbitrary reference body, is not the mechanical sense,\nsince that kind of rotation is not unique at all, but depends on the\nmotion of the reference body. And so Descartes' change of place\n(and for similar reasons, motion in the ordinary sense) is not the\nmechanically significant sense of motion. \n\nIn our discussion of Descartes we called the sense of motion operative\nin the science of mechanics ‘true motion’, and the phrase\nis used in this way by Newton in the Scholium. Thus Newton's\nbucket shows that true (rotational) motion is anti-correlated with,\nand so not identical with, proper motion (as Descartes proposed\naccording to the Garber reading); and Newton further argues that the\nrate of true (rotational) motion is unique, and so not identical with\nchange of place, which is multiple. Newton proposed instead that true\nmotion is motion relative to a temporally enduring, rigid,\n3-dimensional Euclidean space, which he dubbed ‘absolute\nspace’. Of course, Descartes also defined motion as relative to\nan enduring 3-dimensional Euclidean space; the difference is that\nDescartes space was divided into parts (his space was identical with a\nplenum of corpuscles) in motion, not a rigid structure in\nwhich (mobile) material bodies are embedded. So according to Newton,\nthe rate of true rotation of the bucket (and water) is the rate at\nwhich it rotates relative to absolute space. Or put another way,\nNewton effectively defines the complete predicate x\nmoves-absolutely as x moves-relative-to absolute space;\nboth Newton and Descartes offer competing complete predicates as\nanalyses of x moves-truly. \n\nNewton's proposal for understanding motion solves the problems that he\nposed for Descartes, and provides an interpretation of the concepts of\nconstant motion and acceleration that appear in his laws of motion.\nHowever, it suffers from two notable interpretational problems, both\nof which were pressed forcefully by Leibniz (in the Leibniz-Clarke\nCorrespondence, 1715–1716) — which is not to say that\nLeibniz himself offered a superior account of motion (see below). (Of\ncourse, there are other features of Newton's proposal that turned out\nto be empirically inadequate, and are rejected by in relativity theory: Newton's\naccount violates the relativity of simultaneity and postulates a\nnon-dynamical spacetime structure.) First, according to this account,\nabsolute velocity is a well-defined quantity: more simply, the\nabsolute speed of a body is the rate of change of its position\nrelative to an arbitrary point of absolute space. But the Galilean\nrelativity of Newton's laws (see the entry on\n space and time: inertial frames)\n means that the evolution of a closed\nsystem is unaffected by constant changes in velocity; Galileo's\nexperimenter cannot determine from observations inside his cabin\nwhether the boat is at rest in harbor or sailing smoothly. Put another\nway, according to Newtonian mechanics, in principle Newton's absolute\nvelocity cannot be experimentally determined. So in this regard\nabsolute velocity is quite unlike acceleration (including rotation). \nNewtonian acceleration is understood in absolute space as the rate of\nchange of absolute velocity, and is, according to Newtonian mechanics,\nin general measurable; for instance by measuring the height that the\nwater ascends the sides of the bucket. (It is worth noting that Newton\nwas well-aware of these facts; the Galilean relativity of his theory\nis demonstrated in Corollary V of the laws of the Principia,\nwhile Corollary VI shows that acceleration is unobservable if all\nparts of the system accelerate in parallel at the same rate, as they\ndo in a homogeneous gravitational field.) Leibniz argued (rather\ninconsistently, as we shall see) that since differences in absolute\nvelocity are unobservable, they are not be genuine differences at all;\nand hence that Newton's absolute space, whose existence would entail\nthe reality of such differences, must also be a fiction. Few\nphilosophers today would immediately reject a quantity as\nunreal simply because it was not experimentally determinable, but this\nfact does justify genuine doubts about the reality of absolute\nvelocity, and hence of absolute space. \n\nThe second problem concerns the nature of absolute space. Newton quite\nclearly distinguished his account from Descartes' — in\nparticular with regards to absolute space's rigidity versus Descartes'\n‘hydrodynamical’ space, and the possibility of the vacuum\nin absolute space. Thus absolute space is definitely not material. On\nthe other hand, presumably it is supposed to be part of the physical,\nnot mental, realm. In De Gravitatione, Newton rejected both\nthe traditional philosophical categories of substance and attribute as\nsuitable characterizations. Absolute space is not a substance for it\nlacks causal powers and does not have a fully independent existence,\nand yet it is not an attribute since it would exist even in a vacuum, which\nby definition is a place where there are no bodies in which it might\ninhere. Newton proposes that space is what we might call a\n‘pseudo-substance’, more like a substance than property,\nyet not quite a substance. (Note that Samuel Clarke, in his\nCorrespondence with Leibniz, which Newton had some role in\ncomposing, advocates the property view, and note further that when\nLeibniz objects because of the vacuum problem, Clarke suggests that\nthere might be non-material beings in the vacuum in which space might\ninhere.) In fact, Newton accepted the principle that everything that\nexists, exists somewhere — i.e., in absolute space. Thus he\nviewed absolute space as a necessary consequence of the existence of\nanything, and of God's existence in particular — hence space's\nontological dependence.  Leibniz was presumably unaware of the\nunpublished De Gravitatione in which these particular ideas\nwere developed, but as we shall see, his later works are characterized\nby a robust rejection of any notion of space as a real thing rather\nthan an ideal, purely mental entity. This is a view that attracts even\nfewer contemporary adherents, but there is something deeply peculiar\nabout a non-material but physical entity, a worry that has influenced\nmany philosophical opponents of absolute space. \n\nAfter the development of relativity (which we will take up below), and\nits interpretation as a spacetime theory, it was realized\nthat the notion of spacetime had applicability to a range of theories\nof mechanics, classical as well as relativistic. In particular, there\nis a spacetime geometry — ‘Galilean’ or\n‘neo-Newtonian’ spacetime — for Newtonian mechanics\nthat solves the problem of absolute velocity; an idea exploited by a\nnumber of philosophers from the late 1960s (e.g., Earman 1970,\nFriedman 1983, Sklar 1974 and Stein 1968).  For details the reader is\nreferred to the entry on\n spacetime: inertial frames,\n but the general idea is that although a spatial distance is\nwell-defined between any two simultaneous points of this spacetime,\nonly the temporal interval is well-defined between non-simultaneous\npoints. Thus things are rather unlike Newton's absolute space, whose\npoints persist through time and maintain their distances: in absolute\nspace the distance between p-now and q-then (where\np and q are points) is just the distance between\np-now and q-now. However, Galilean spacetime has an\n‘affine connection’ which effectively specifies for every\npoint of every continuous curve, the rate at which the curve is\nchanging from straightness at that point; for instance, the straight\nlines are picked out as those curves whose rate of change from\nstraightness is zero at every point. (Another way of thinking about\nthis space is as possessing — in addition to a distance between\nany two simultaneous points and a temporal interval between any points\n— a three-place relation of colinearity, satisfied by three\npoints just in case they lie on a straight line.) \n\nSince the trajectories of bodies are curves in spacetime, the affine\nconnection determines the rate of change from straightness at every\npoint of every possible trajectory. The straight trajectories thus\ndefined can be interpreted as the trajectories of bodies moving\ninertially (i.e., without forces), and the rate of change from\nstraightness of any trajectory can be interpreted as the acceleration\nof a body following that trajectory. That is, Newton's First Law can\nbe given a geometric formulation as ‘bodies on which no net\nforces act follow straight lines in spacetime’; similarly, the Second\nLaw can be formulated as ‘the rate of change from straightness\nof a body's trajectory is equal to the forces acting on the body\ndivided by its mass’. The significance of this geometry is that\nwhile acceleration is well-defined, velocity is not — in accord\nwith the empirical determinability of acceleration but not of\nvelocity, according to Newtonian mechanics. (A simple analogy helps\nsee how such a thing is possible: betweenness on a curve, but not\n‘up’ is a well-defined concept in Euclidean space.)  Thus\nGalilean spacetime gives a very nice interpretation of the choice that\nnature makes when it decides that the laws of mechanics should be\nformulated in terms of accelerations not velocities. \n\nPut another way, we can define the complete predicate x\naccelerates as trajectory(x)\nhas-non-zero-rate-of-change-from-straightness, where\ntrajectory maps bodies onto their trajectories in Galilean\nspacetime. And this predicate, defined this way, applies to the water\nin the bucket if and only if it is rotating, according to Newtonian\nmechanics formulated in terms of the geometry of Galilean spacetime;\nit is the mechanically relevant sense of the word in this theory. But\nthis theoretical formulation and definition have been given in terms of the\ngeometry of spacetime, not in terms of the relations between bodies; acceleration is\n‘absolute’ in the sense that there is a preferred (true)\nsense of acceleration in mechanics and which is not defined in terms\nof the motions of bodies relative to one another. (Note that this\nsense of ‘absolute’ is broader than that of motion\nrelative to absolute space, which we defined earlier. In the remainder\nof this article we will use it in the broader sense. The reader should\nbe aware that the term is used in many ways in the literature, and\nsuch equivocation often leads to significant misunderstandings.) Thus if\nany of this analysis of motion is taken literally then one arrives at\na position regarding the ontology of spacetime rather like that of\nNewton's regarding space: it is some kind of ‘substantial’\n(or maybe pseudo-substantial) thing with the geometry of\nGalilean spacetime, just as absolute space possessed Euclidean\ngeometry. This view regarding the ontology of spacetime is usually\ncalled ‘substantivalism’ (Sklar, 1974). The Galilean\nsubstantivalist usually sees himself as adopting a more sophisticated\ngeometry than Newton but sharing his substantivalism (though there is\nroom for debate on Newton's exact ontological views; see DiSalle,\n2002). The advantage of the more sophisticated geometry is that\nalthough it allows the absolute sense of acceleration apparently\nrequired by Newtonian mechanics to be defined, it does not allow one\nto define a similar absolute speed or velocity — x\naccelerates can be defined as a complete predicate in terms of the\ngeometry of Galilean spacetime but not x moves in general\n— and so the first of Leibniz's problems is resolved. Of course\nwe see that the solution depends on a crucial shift from speed and\nvelocity to acceleration as the relevant senses of\n‘motion’: from the rate of change of position to the rate\nof rate of change. \n\nWhile this proposal solves the first kind of problem posed by Leibniz,\nit seems just as vulnerable to the second. While it is true that it\ninvolves the rejection of absolute space as Newton conceived it, and\nwith it the need to explicate the nature of an enduring space, the\npostulation of Galilean spacetime poses the parallel question of the\nnature of spacetime. Again, it is a physical but non-material\nsomething, the points of which may be coincident with material bodies.\nWhat kind of thing is it? Could we do without it? As we shall see\nbelow, some contemporary philosophers believe so. \n\nThere is a ‘folk-reading’ of Leibniz that one finds either\nexplicitly or implicitly in the philosophy of physics literature which\ntakes account of only some of his remarks on space and motion. The\nreading underlies vast swathes of the literature: for instance, the\nquantities captured by Earman's (1999) ‘Leibnizian\nspacetime’ do not do justice to Leibniz's view of motion (as\nEarman acknowledges). But it is perhaps most obvious in introductory\ntexts (e.g., Ray 1991, Huggett 2000 to mention a couple). According to\nthis view, the only quantities of motion are relative quantities,\nrelative velocity, acceleration and so on, and all relative motions\nare equal, so there is no true sense of motion. However, Leibniz is\nexplicit that other quantities are also ‘real’, and his\nmechanics implicitly — but obviously — depends on yet\nothers. The length of this section is a measure, not so much of the\nimportance of Leibniz's actual views, but the importance of showing\nwhat the prevalent folk view leaves out regarding Leibniz's views on\nthe metaphysics of motion and interpretation of mechanics. (For\nfurther elaboration of the following points the reader is referred\nto the entry on\n Leibniz's philosophy of physics) \n\nThat said, we shall also see that no one has yet discovered a fully\nsatisfactory way of reconciling the numerous conflicting things that\nLeibniz says about motion. Some of these tensions can be put down\nsimply to his changing his mind (see Cover and Hartz 1988 for an\nexplication of how Leibniz's views on space developed). However, we\nwill concentrate on the fairly short period in the mid 1680–90s during\nwhich Leibniz developed his theory of mechanics, and was most\nconcerned with its interpretation. We will supplement this\ndiscussion with the important remarks that he made in his\nCorrespondence with Samuel Clarke\naround 30 years later\n(1715–1716); this discussion is broadly in line with the earlier\nperiod, and the intervening period is one in which he turned to other\nmatters, rather than one in which his views on space were dramatically\nevolving. \n\nArguably, Leibniz's views concerning space and motion do not have a\ncompletely linear logic, starting from some logically sufficient basic\npremises, but instead form a collection of mutually supporting\ndoctrines. If one starts questioning why Leibniz held certain views\n— concerning the ideality of space, for instance — one is\napt to be led in a circle. Still, exposition requires starting\nsomewhere, and Leibniz's argument for the ideality of space in the\nCorrespondence with Clarke is a good place to begin. But bear\nin mind the caveats made here — this argument was made later\nthan a number of other relevant writings, and its logical relation to\nLeibniz's views on motion is complex. \n\nLeibniz (LV.47 — this notation means Leibniz's Fifth letter,\nsection 47, and so on) says that (i) a body comes to have the\n‘same place’ as another once did, when it comes to stand\nin the same relations to bodies we ‘suppose’ to be\nunchanged (more on this later).  (ii) That we can define ‘a\nplace’ to be that which any such two bodies have in common (here\nhe claims an analogy with the Euclidean/Eudoxan definition of a\nrational number in terms of an identity relation between ratios). And\nfinally that (iii) space is all such places taken together. However,\nhe also holds that properties are particular, incapable of\nbeing instantiated by more than one individual, even at different\ntimes; hence it is impossible for the two bodies to be in\nliterally the same relations to the unchanged bodies. Thus the thing\nthat we take to be the same for the two bodies — the place\n— is something added by our minds to the situation, and only\nideal. As a result, space, which is constructed from these\nideal places, is itself ideal: ‘a certain order, wherein the\nmind conceives the application of relations’. \n\nIt's worth pausing briefly to contrast this view of space with those\nof Descartes and of Newton. Both Descartes and Newton claim that space\nis a real, mind-independent entity; for Descartes it is matter, and\nfor Newton a ‘pseudo-substance’, distinct from matter. And\nof course for both, these views are intimately tied up with their\naccounts of motion.  Leibniz simply denies the mind-independent\nreality of space, and this too is bound up with his views concerning\nmotion. (Note that fundamentally, in the metaphysics of monads that\nLeibniz was developing contemporaneously with his mechanics,\neverything is in the mind of the monads; but the point that\nLeibniz is making here is that even within the world that is logically\nconstructed from the contents of the minds of monads, space is\nideal.) \n\nSo far (apart from that remark about ‘unchanged’ bodies)\nwe have not seen Leibniz introduce anything more than relations of\ndistance between bodies, which is certainly consistent with the folk\nview of his philosophy. However, Leibniz sought to provide a\nfoundation for the Cartesian/mechanical philosophy in terms of the\nAristotelian/scholastic metaphysics of substantial forms (here we\ndiscuss the views laid out in Sections 17–22 of the 1686 Discourse\non Metaphysics and the 1695 Specimen of Dynamics, both\nin Garber and Ariew 1989). In particular, he identifies primary matter\nwith what he calls its ‘primitive passive force’ of\nresistance to changes in motion and to penetration, and the\nsubstantial form of a body with its ‘primitive active\nforce’. It is important to realize that these forces are not\nmere properties of matter, but actually constitute it in some sense,\nand further that they are not themselves quantifiable. However because\nof the collisions of bodies with one another, these forces\n‘suffer limitation’, and ‘derivative’ passive\nand active forces result.  (There's a real puzzle here. Collision\npresupposes space, but primitive forces constitute matter\nprior to any spatial concepts — the primitive active\nand passive forces ground motion and extension respectively. See\nGarber and Rauzy, 2004.) Derivative passive force shows up in the\ndifferent degrees of resistance to change of different kinds of matter\n(of ‘secondary matter’ in scholastic terms), and\napparently is measurable. Derivative active force however, is\nconsiderably more problematic for Leibniz. On the one hand, it is\nfundamental to his account of motion and theory of mechanics —\nmotion fundamentally is possession of force. But on the other\nhand, Leibniz endorses the mechanical philosophy, which precisely\nsought to abolish Aristotelian substantial form, which active force\nrepresents. Leibniz's goal was to reconcile the two philosophies, by\nproviding an Aristotelian metaphysical foundation for modern\nmechanical science; as we shall see, it is ultimately an open question\nexactly how Leibniz intended to deal with the inherent tensions in\nsuch a view. \n\nThe texts are sufficiently ambiguous to permit dissent, but arguably\nLeibniz intends that one manifestation of derivative active force is\nwhat he calls vis viva — ‘living\nforce’. Leibniz had a famous argument with the Cartesians over\nthe correct definition of this quantity. Descartes defined it as\nsize times speed — effectively as the\nmagnitude of the momentum of a body. Leibniz gave a brilliant argument\n(repeated in a number of places, for instance Section 17 of the\nDiscourse on Metaphysics) that it was size times\nspeed2 — so (proportional to) kinetic\nenergy. If the proposed identification is correct then kinetic energy\nquantifies derivative active force according to Leibniz; or looked at\nthe other way, the quantity of virtus (another term used by\nLeibniz for active force) associated with a body determines its\nkinetic energy and hence its speed. As far as the authors know,\nLeibniz never explicitly says anything conclusive about the relativity\nof virtus, but it is certainly consistent to read him (as\nRoberts 2003 does) to claim that there is a unique quantity of\nvirtus and hence ‘true’ (as we have been using\nthe term) speed associated with each body. At the very least, Leibniz\ndoes say that there is a real difference between possession and\nnon-possession of vis viva (e.g., in Section 18 of the\nDiscourse) and it is a small step from there to true, privileged\nspeed.  Indeed, for Leibniz, mere change of relative position is not\n‘entirely real’ (as we saw for instance in the\nCorrespondence) and only when it has vis viva as its\nimmediate cause is there some reality to it. (However, just to muddy\nthe waters, Leibniz also claims that as a matter of fact, no body ever\nhas zero force, which on the reading proposed means no body is ever at\nrest, which would be surprising given all the collisions bodies\nundergo.) An alternative interpretation to the one suggested here\nmight say that Leibniz intends that while there is a difference\nbetween motion/virtus and no motion/virtus, there is\nsomehow no difference between any strictly positive values of those\nquantities. \n\nIt is important to emphasize two points about the preceding account of\nmotion in Leibniz's philosophy. First, motion in the everyday sense\n— motion relative to something else — is not\nreally real. Fundamentally motion is possession of virtus,\nsomething that is ultimately non-spatial (modulo its interpretation as\nprimitive force limited by collision). If this reading is right\n— and something along these lines seems necessary if we aren't\nsimply to ignore important statements by Leibniz on motion —\nthen Leibniz is offering an interpretation of motion that is radically\ndifferent from the obvious understanding. One might even say that for\nLeibniz motion is not movement at all! (We will leave to one side the\nquestion of whether his account is ultimately coherent.) The second\npoint is that however we should understand Leibniz, the folk reading\nsimply does not and cannot take account of his clearly and repeatedly\nstated view that what is real in motion is force not relative\nmotion, for the folk reading allows Leibniz only relative\nmotion (and of course additionally, motion in the sense of force is a\nvariety of true motion, again contrary to the folk reading). \n\nHowever, from what has been said so far it is still possible that the\nfolk reading is accurate when it comes to Leibniz's views on the\nphenomena of motion, the subject of his theory of mechanics. The case\nfor the folk reading is in fact supported by Leibniz's\nresolution of the tension that we mentioned earlier, between the\nfundamental role of force/virtus (which we will now take to\nmean mass times speed2) and its\nassociation with Aristotelian form. Leibniz's way out (e.g.,\nSpecimen of Dynamics) is to require that while considerations\nof force must somehow determine the form of the laws of motion, the\nlaws themselves should be such as not to allow one to determine the\nvalue of the force (and hence true speed). One might conclude that in\nthis case Leibniz held that the only quantities which can be\ndetermined are those of relative position and motion, as the folk\nreading says.  But even in this circumscribed context, it is at best\nquestionable whether the interpretation is correct. \n\nConsider first Leibniz's mechanics. Since his laws are what is now\n(ironically) often called ‘Newtonian’ elastic collision\ntheory, it seems that they satisfy both of his requirements. The laws\ninclude conservation of kinetic energy (which we identify with\nvirtus), but they hold in all inertial frames, so the kinetic\nenergy of any arbitrary body can be set to any initial value. But they\ndo not permit the kinetic energy of a body to take on any values\nthroughout a process. The laws are only Galilean relativistic, and so\nare not true in every frame. Furthermore, according to the laws of\ncollision, in an inertial frame, if a body does not collide then its\nLeibnizian force is conserved while if (except in special cases) it\ndoes collide then its force changes. According to Leibniz's laws one\ncannot determine initial kinetic energies, but one certainly can tell\nwhen they change. At very least, there are quantities of motion\nimplicit in Leibniz's mechanics — change in force and true\nspeed — that are not merely relative; the folk reading is\ncommitted to Leibniz simply missing this obvious fact. \n\nThat said, when Leibniz discusses the relativity of motion —\nwhich he calls the ‘equivalence of hypotheses’ about the\nstates of motion of bodies — some of his statements do suggest\nthat he was confused in this way. For another way of stating the\nproblem for the folk reading is that the claim that relative motions\nalone suffice for mechanics and that all relative motions are on a par is\na principle of general relativity, and could Leibniz — a\nmathematical genius — really have failed to notice that his laws\nhold only in special frames? Well, just maybe. On the one hand, when\nhe explicitly articulates the principle of the equivalence of\nhypotheses (for instance in Specimen of Dynamics) he tends to\nsay only that one cannot assign initial velocities on the\nbasis of the outcome of a collision, which requires only Galilean\nrelativity.  However, he confusingly also claimed (On\nCopernicanism and the Relativity of Motion, also in Garber and\nAriew 1989) that the Tychonic and Copernican hypotheses were\nequivalent. But if the Earth orbits the Sun in an inertial frame\n(Copernicus), then there is no inertial frame according to which the\nSun orbits the Earth (Tycho Brahe), and vice versa: these hypotheses\nare simply not Galilean equivalent (something else Leibniz could\nhardly have failed to notice).  So there is some textual support for\nLeibniz endorsing general relativity for the phenomena, as the folk reading maintains. \n\nA number of commentators have suggested solutions to the puzzle of the\nconflicting pronouncements that Leibniz makes on the subject: Stein\n1977 argues for general relativity, thereby imputing a\nmisunderstanding of his own laws to Leibniz; Roberts 2003 argues for\nGalilean relativity, thereby discounting Leibniz's apparent statements\nto the contrary; see also Lodge 2003. Jauernig 2004 and 2008 points\nout that in the Specimen, Leibniz claims that all motions are\ncomposed of uniform rectilinear motions: an apparently curvilinear\nmotion is actually a series of uniform motions, punctuated by\ndiscontinuous collisions. This observation allows one to restrict the\nscope of claims of the kind ‘no motions can be attributed on the\nbasis of phenomena’ to inertial motions, and so helps read\nLeibniz as more consistently advocating Galilean relativity, the\nreading Jauernig favors (see also Huggett's 2006 ‘Can Spacetime\nHelp Settle Any Issues in Modern Philosophy?’, in the Other\nInternet Resources, which was inspired by Jauernig's work). Note that\neven in a pure collision dynamics the phenomena distinguish a body in\nuniform rectilinear motion over time, from one that undergoes\ncollisions changing its uniform rectilinear motion over time: the laws\nwill hold in the frame of the former, but not in the frame of the\nlatter. That is, apparently contrary to what Jauernig says, Leibniz's\naccount of curvilinear motion does not collapse Galilean relativity\ninto general relativity. In that case, Leibniz's specific claims of\nthe phenomenal equivalence of Copernican and Tychonic hypotheses still\nneed to be accommodated. \n\nSo the folk reading simply ignores Leibniz's metaphysics of motion, it\ncommits Leibniz to a mathematical howler regarding his laws, and it is\narguable whether it is the best rendering of his pronouncements\nconcerning relativity; it certainly cannot be accepted\nunquestioningly. However, it is not hard to understand the temptation\nof the folk reading. In his Correspondence with Clarke,\nLeibniz says that he believes space to be “something merely\nrelative, as time is, … an order of coexistences, as time is an\norder of successions” (LIII.4), which is naturally taken to mean\nthat space is at base nothing but the distance and temporal relations\nbetween bodies.  (Though even this passage has its subtleties, because\nof the ideality of space discussed above, and because in Leibniz's\nconception space determines what sets of relations are\npossible.) And if relative distances and times exhaust the\nspatiotemporal in this way, then shouldn't all quantities of\nmotion be defined in terms of those relations? We have seen two ways\nin which this would be the wrong conclusion to draw. Force\nseems to involve a notion of speed that is not identified with any\nrelative speed. And (unless the equivalence of hypotheses is after all\na principle of general relativity), the laws pick out a standard of\nconstant motion that need not be any constant relative motion. Of\ncourse, it is hard to reconcile these quantities with the view of\nspace and time that Leibniz proposes — what is speed in\nsize times speed2 or constant speed if\nnot speed relative to some body or to absolute space? Given Leibniz's\nview that space is literally ideal (and indeed that even relative\nmotion is not ‘entirely real’) perhaps the best answer is\nthat he took force and hence motion in its real\nsense not to be determined by motion in a relative sense at all, but\nto be primitive monadic quantities. That is, he took x moves\nto be a complete predicate, but he believed that it could be fully\nanalyzed in terms of strictly monadic predicates: x moves iff\nx possesses-non-zero-derivative-active-force. And this\nreading explains just what Leibniz took us to be supposing when we\n‘supposed certain bodies to be unchanged’ in the\nconstruction of the idea of space: that they had no force, nothing\ncausing, or making real any motion. \n\nIt's again helpful to compare Leibniz with Descartes and Newton, this\ntime regarding motion. Commentators often express frustration at\nLeibniz's response to Newton's arguments for absolute space: “I\nfind nothing … in the Scholium that proves or can\nprove the reality of space in itself. However, I grant that there is a\ndifference between an absolute true motion of a body and a mere\nrelative change …” (LV.53). Not only does Leibniz apparently\nfail to take the argument seriously, he then goes on to concede the\nstep in the argument that seems to require absolute space! But with\nour understanding of Newton and Leibniz, we can see that what he says\nmakes perfect sense (or at least that it is not as disingenuous as it\nis often taken to be). Newton argues in the Scholium that\ntrue motion cannot be identified with the kinds of motion that\nDescartes considers; but both of these are purely relative motions,\nand Leibniz is in complete agreement that merely relative motions are\nnot true (i.e., ‘entirely real’). Leibniz's\n‘concession’ merely registers his agreement with Newton\nagainst Descartes on the difference between true and relative motion;\nhe surely understood who and what Newton was refuting, and it was a\nposition that he had himself, in different terms, publicly argued\nagainst at length. But as we have seen, Leibniz had a very different\nanalysis of the difference to Newton's; true motion was not, for him,\na matter of motion relative to absolute space, but the possession of\nquantity of force, ontologically prior to any spatiotemporal\nquantities at all. There is indeed nothing in the Scholium\nexplicitly directed against that view, and since it does potentially\noffer an alternative way of understanding true motion, it is not\nunreasonable for Leibniz to claim that there is no deductive inference\nfrom true motion to absolute space. \n\nThe folk reading which belies Leibniz has it that he sought a theory\nof mechanics formulated in terms only of the relations between bodies.\nAs we'll see presently, in the Nineteenth Century, Ernst Mach indeed\nproposed such an approach, but Leibniz clearly did not; though certain\nsimilarities between Leibniz and Mach — especially the rejection\nof absolute space — surely helps explain the confusion\nbetween the two. But not only is Leibniz often misunderstood, there\nare influential misreadings of Newton's arguments in the\nScholium, influenced by the idea that he is addressing\nLeibniz in some way. Of course the Principia was written 30\nyears before the Correspondence, and the arguments of the\nScholium were not written with Leibniz in mind, but Clarke\nhimself suggests (CIV.13) that those arguments — specifically\nthose concerning the bucket — are telling against Leibniz. That\nargument is indeed devastating to the parity of all relative motions but we have seen\nthat it is highly questionable whether Leibniz's equivalence of\nhypotheses amounts to such a view. That said, his statements in the\nfirst four letters of the Correspondence could understandably\nmislead Clarke on this point — it is in reply to Clarke's\nchallenge that Leibniz explicitly denies the parity of relative\nmotions. But interestingly, Clarke does not present a true version of\nNewton's argument — despite some involvement of Newton in\nwriting the replies. Instead of the argument from the uniqueness of\nthe rate of rotation, he argues that systems with different velocities\nmust be different because the effects observed if they were\nbrought to rest would be different. This argument is of course\nutterly question begging against a view that holds that there is no\nprivileged standard of rest (the view Clarke mistakenly attributes to Leibniz)! \n\nAs we discuss further in Section 8, Mach attributed to Newton the fallacious\nargument that because the surface of the water curved even when it was\nnot in motion relative to the bucket, it must be rotating relative to\nabsolute space. Our discussion of Newton showed how misleading such a\nreading is. In the first place he also argues that there must be some\nprivileged sense of rotation, and hence not all relative motions are\nequal. Second, the argument is ad hominem against Descartes,\nin which context a disjunctive syllogism — motion is either\nproper or ordinary or relative to absolute space — is\nargumentatively legitimate. On the other hand, Mach is quite correct\nthat Newton's argument in the Scholium leaves open the\nlogical possibility that the privileged, true sense of rotation (and\nacceleration more generally) is some species of relative motion; if\nnot motion properly speaking, then relative to the fixed stars\nperhaps. (In fact Newton rejects this possibility in De\nGravitatione (1962) on the grounds that it would involve an\nodious action at a distance; an ironic position given his theory of\nuniversal gravity.) \n\nHowever the kind of folk-reading of Newton that underlies much of the\ncontemporary literature replaces Mach's interpretation with a more\ncharitable one. According to this reading, Newton's point is that his\nmechanics — unlike Descartes' — could explain why\nthe surface of the rotating water is curved, that his explanation\ninvolves a privileged sense of rotation, and that absent an\nalternative hypothesis about its relative nature, we should accept\nabsolute space.  But our discussion of Newton's argument showed that\nit simply does not have an ‘abductive’, ‘best\nexplanation’ form, but shows deductively, from Cartesian\npremises, that rotation is neither proper nor ordinary motion. \n\nThat is not to say that Newton had no understanding of how such\neffects would be explained in his mechanics. For instance, in\nCorollaries 5 and 6 to the Definitions of the Principles he\nstates in general terms the conditions under which different states of\nmotion are not — and so by implication are —\ndiscernible according to his laws of mechanics. Nor is it to say that\nNewton's contemporaries weren't seriously concerned with explaining\ninertial effects. Leibniz, for instance, analyzed a rotating body (in\nthe Specimen). In short, parts of a rotating system collide\nwith the surrounding matter and are continuously deflected, into a\nseries of linear motions that form a curved path. (Though the system\nas Leibniz envisions it — comprised of a plenum of elastic\nparticles of matter — is far too complex for him to offer any\nquantitative model based on this qualitative picture. So he had no\nserious alternative explanation of inertial effects.) \n\nAlthough the argument is then not Newton's, it is still an important\nresponse to the kind of relationism proposed by the folk-Leibniz,\nespecially when it is extended by bringing in a further example from\nNewton's Scholium. Newton considered a pair of identical\nspheres, connected by a cord, too far from any bodies to observe any\nrelative motions; he pointed out that their rate and direction of\nrotation could still be experimentally determined by measuring the\ntension in the cord, and by pushing on opposite faces of the two globes\nto see whether the tension increased or decreased. He intended this\nsimple example to demonstrate that the project he intended in the\nPrincipia, of determining the absolute accelerations and\nhence gravitational forces on the planets from their relative motions,\nwas possible. However, if we further specify that the spheres and cord\nare rigid and that they are the only things in their\nuniverse, then the example can be used to point out that there are\ninfinitely many different rates of rotation all of which agree on the\nrelations between bodies. Since there are no differences in the\nrelations between bodies in the different situations, it follows that\nthe observable differences between the states of rotation\ncannot be explained in terms of the relations between\nbodies. Therefore, a theory of the kind attributed to the folk's\nLeibniz cannot explain all the phenomena of Newtonian mechanics, and\nagain we can argue abductively for absolute space. (Of course, the\nargument works by showing that, granted the different states of\nrotation, there are states of rotation that cannot merely be relative\nrotations of any kind; for the differences cannot be traced to any\nrelational differences. That is, granted the assumptions of the\nargument, rotation is not true relative motion of any kind.) \n\nThis argument (neither the premises nor conclusion) is not Newton's,\nand must not be taken as a historically accurate reading, However,\nthat is not to say that the argument is fallacious, and indeed many\nhave found it attractive, particularly as a defense not of Newton's\nabsolute space, but of Galilean spacetime. That is, Newtonian\nmechanics with Galilean spacetime can explain the phenomena associated\nwith rotation, while theories of the kind proposed by Mach cannot\nexplain the differences between situations allowed by Newtonian\nmechanics, but these explanations rely on the geometric structure of\nGalilean spacetime — particularly its affine connection, to interpret\nacceleration. And thus — the argument goes — those\nexplanations commit us to the reality of spacetime — a manifold\nof points — whose properties include the appropriate geometric\nones. This final doctrine, of the reality of spacetime with its\ncomponent points or regions, distinct from matter, with geometric\nproperties, is what we earlier identified as\n‘substantivalism’. \n\nThere are two points to make about this line of argument. First, the\nrelationist could reply that he need not explain all situations which\nare possible according to Newtonian mechanics, because that theory is\nto be rejected in favor of one which invokes only distance and time\nrelations between bodies, but which approximates to Newton's if matter\nis distributed suitably. Such a relationist would be following Mach's\nproposal, which we will discuss next. Such a position would be\nsatisfactory only to the extent that a suitable concrete replacement\ntheory to Newton's theory is developed; Mach never offered such a\ntheory, but recently more progress has been made. \n\nSecond, one must be careful in understanding just how the argument\nworks, for it is tempting to gloss it by saying that in Newtonian\nmechanics the affine connection is a crucial part of the explanation of the\nsurface of the water in the bucket, and if the spacetime which carries\nthe connection is denied, then the explanation fails too. But this\ngloss tacitly assumes that Newtonian mechanics can only be understood\nin a substantial Galilean spacetime; if an interpretation of Newtonian\nmechanics that does not assume substantivalism can be constructed,\nthen all Newtonian explanations can be given without a literal\nconnection.  Both Sklar (1974) and van Fraassen (1985) have made\nproposals along these lines. Sklar proposes interpreting\n‘true’ acceleration as a primitive quantity not defined in\nterms of motion relative to anything, be it absolute space, a\nconnection or other bodies. (Notice the family resemblance between\nthis proposal and Leibniz's view of force and speed.) Van Fraassen\nproposes formulating mechanics as ‘Newton's Laws hold in\nsome frame’, so that the form of the laws and the\ncontingent relative motions of bodies — not absolute space or a\nconnection, or even any instantaneous relations — pick out a\nstandard of true motion, namely with respect to such an\n‘inertial frame’. These proposals aim to keep the full\nexplanatory resources of Newtonian mechanics, and hence admit\n‘true acceleration’, but deny any relations between bodies\nand spacetime itself. Like the actual Leibniz, they allow absolute\nquantities of motion, but claim that space and time themselves are\nnothing but the relations between bodies. Some may question how the\nlaws can be such as to privilege frames without prior spacetime\ngeometry. Huggett 2006 proposes that the laws be understood as a\nHumean ‘best system’\n(see the entry on\n laws of nature) for a\nworld of bodies and their relations; the laws don't reflect prior\ngeometric structure, but systematic regularities in patterns of\nrelative motions. For obvious reasons, this proposal is called\n‘regularity relationism’. Note that Sklar and van\nFraassen are committed to the idea that in some sense Newton's laws\nare capable of explaining all the phenomena without recourse to\nspacetime geometry; that the connection and the metrical properties\nare explanatorily redundant. This idea is at the core of the\n‘Dynamical Approach’, discussed below. \n\nBetween the time of Newton and Leibniz and the 20th century, Newton's\nmechanics and gravitation theory reigned essentially unchallenged, and\nwith that long period of dominance, absolute space came to be widely\naccepted. At least, no natural philosopher or physicist offered a\nserious challenge to Newton's absolute space, in the sense of offering\na rival theory that dispenses with it. But like the action at a\ndistance in Newtonian gravity, absolute space continued to provoke\nmetaphysical unease. Seeking a replacement for the unobservable\nNewtonian space, Neumann (1870) and Lange (1885) developed more\nconcrete definitions of the reference frames in which Newton's laws\nhold. In these and a few other works, the concept of the set of\ninertial frames was first clearly expressed, though it was implicit in\nboth remarks and procedures to be found in the\nPrincipia. (See the entries on \n space and time: inertial frames\n and\n Newton's views on space, time, and motion)\n The most sustained, comprehensive, and influential attack on absolute\nspace was made by Ernst Mach in his Science of Mechanics\n(1883). \n\nIn a lengthy discussion of Newton's Scholium on absolute\nspace, Mach accuses Newton of violating his own methodological\nprecepts by going well beyond what the observational facts teach us\nconcerning motion and acceleration. Mach at least partly\nmisinterpreted Newton's aims in the Scholium, and inaugurated\na reading of the bucket argument (and by extension the globes\nargument) that has largely persisted in the literature since. Mach\nviewed the argument as directed against a ‘strict’ or\n‘general-relativity’ form of relationism, and as an\nattempt to establish the existence of absolute space. Mach points out\nthe obvious gap in the argument when so construed: the experiment only\nestablishes that acceleration (rotation) of the water with respect\nto the Earth, or the frame of the fixed stars, produces the\ntendency to recede from the center; it does not prove that a strict\nrelationist theory cannot account for the bucket phenomena, much less\nthe existence of absolute space. (The reader will recall that Newton's\nactual aim was simply to show that Descartes' two kinds of motion are\nnot adequate to accounting for rotational phenomena.) Although Mach\ndoes not mention the globes thought experiment specifically, it is\neasy to read an implicit response to it in the things he does say:\nnobody is competent to say what would happen, or what would be\npossible, in a universe devoid of matter other than two globes. So\nneither the bucket nor the globes can establish the existence of\nabsolute space. \n\nBoth in Mach's interpretations of Newton's arguments and in his\nreplies, one can already see two anti-absolute space viewpoints\nemerge, though Mach himself never fully kept them apart. The first\nstrain, which we may call ‘Mach-lite’, criticizes Newton's\npostulation of absolute space as a metaphysical leap that is neither\njustified by actual experiments, nor methodologically sound. The\nremedy offered by Mach-lite is simple: we should retain Newton's\nmechanics and use it just as we already do, but eliminate the\nunnecessary posit of absolute space. In its place we need only\nsubstitute the frame of the fixed stars, as is the practice in\nastronomy in any case. If we find the incorporation of a reference to\ncontingent circumstances (the existence of a single reference frame in\nwhich the stars are more or less stationary) in the fundamental laws\nof nature problematic (which Mach need not, given his official\npositivist account of scientific laws), then Mach suggests that we\nreplace the 1st law with an empirically equivalent mathematical\nrival: \n\nThe sums in this equation are to be taken over all massive bodies in\nthe universe. Since the top sum is weighted by distance, distant\nmasses count much more than near ones. In a world with a (reasonably)\nstatic distribution of heavy distant bodies, such as we appear to live\nin, the equation entails local conservation of linear momentum in\n‘inertial’ frames. The upshot of this equation is that the\nframe of the fixed stars plays the role of absolute space in\nthe statement of the 1st law. (Notice that this equation, unlike\nNewton's first law, is not vectorial.) This proposal does not, by\nitself, offer an alternative to Newtonian mechanics, and as Mach\nhimself pointed out, the law is not well-behaved in an infinite\nuniverse filled with stars; but the same can perhaps be said of\nNewton's law of gravitation (see Malament 1995, and Norton\n 1993). But Mach did not offer this equation as a proposed law valid in any\ncircumstances; he avers, “it is impossible to say whether the\nnew expression would still represent the true condition of things if\nthe stars were to perform rapid movements among one another.”\n(p. 289) \n\nIt is not clear whether Mach offered this revised first law as a first\nstep toward a theory that would replace Newton's mechanics, deriving\ninertial effects from only relative motions, as Leibniz desired. But\nmany other remarks made by Mach in his chapter criticizing absolute\nspace point in this direction, and they have given birth to the\nMach-heavy view, later to be christened “Mach's Principle”\nby Albert\n Einstein.[2]\n The Mach-heavy viewpoint calls for a new mechanics that invokes only\nrelative distances and (perhaps) their 1st and 2nd time derivatives,\nand thus ‘generally relativistic’ in the sense sometimes\nread into Leibniz's remarks about motion. Mach wished to eliminate\nabsolute time from physics too, so he would have wanted a proper\nrelationist reduction of these derivatives also. The Barbour-Bertotti\ntheories, discussed below, provide this. \n\nMach-heavy apparently involves the prediction of novel effects due to\n‘merely’ relative accelerations. Mach hints at such\neffects in his criticism of Newton's bucket: \n\nThe suggestion here seems to be that the relative rotation in stage\n(i) of the experiment might immediately generate an outward force\n(before any rotation is communicated to the water), if the sides of\nthe bucket were massive enough. (Note that this response could not\nhave been made by Leibniz — even if he had wanted to defend\nMachian relationism — because it involves action at a distance\nbetween the water and the parts of the bucket.) \n\nMore generally, Mach-heavy involves the view that all inertial effects\nshould be derived from the motions of the body in question relative to\nall other massive bodies in the universe. The water in Newton's bucket\nfeels an outward pull due (mainly) to the relative rotation of all the\nfixed stars around it. Mach-heavy is a speculation that an effect\nsomething like electromagnetic induction should be built into gravity\ntheory. (Such an effect does exist according to the General Theory of\nRelativity, and is called ‘gravitomagnetic induction’. The\nrecently finished Gravity Probe B mission was designed to measure the\ngravitomagnetic induction effect due to the Earth's rotation.) Its\nspecific form must fall off with distance much more slowly than\n1/r2, if it is to be empirically similar to Newtonian\nphysics; but it will certainly predict experimentally testable novel\nbehaviors. A theory that satisfies all the goals of Mach-heavy would\nappear to be ideal for the vindication of strict relationism and the\nelimination of absolute quantities of motion from mechanics. \n\nDirect assault on the problem of satisfying Mach-heavy in a classical\nframework proved unsuccessful, despite the efforts of others besides\nMach (e.g., Friedländer 1896, Föpl 1904, Reissner 1914,\n1915), until the work of Barbour and Bertotti in the 1970s and\n80s. (Between the late 19th century and the 1970s, there was of course\none extremely important attempt to satisfy Mach-heavy: the work of\nEinstein that led to the General Theory of Relativity. Since\nEinstein's efforts took place in a non-classical\n(Lorentz/Einstein/Minkowski) spacetime setting, we discuss them in the\nnext section.) Rather than formulating a revised law of\ngravity/inertia using relative quantities, Barbour and Bertotti\nattacked the problem using the framework of Lagrangian mechanics,\nreplacing the elements of the action that involve absolute quantities\nof motion with new terms invoking only relative distances, velocities\netc. Their first (1977) theory uses a very simple and elegant action,\nand satisfies everything one could wish for from a Mach-heavy theory:\nit is relationally pure (even with respect to time: while simultaneity\nis absolute, the temporal metric is derived from the field equations);\nit is nearly empirically equivalent to Newton's theory in a world such\nas ours (with a large-scale uniform, near-stationary matter\ndistribution); yet it does predict novel effects such as the ones Mach\nposited with his thick bucket. Among these is an ‘anisotropy of\ninertia’ effect — accelerating a body away from the\ngalactic center requires more force than accelerating it perpendicular\nto the galactic plane — large enough to be ruled out\nempirically. \n\nBarbour and Bertotti's second attempt (1982) at a relational\nLagrangian mechanics was arguably less Machian, but more empirically\nadequate. In it, solutions are sought beginning with two\ntemporally-nearby, instantaneous relational configurations of the\nbodies in the universe. Barbour and Bertotti define an\n‘intrinsic difference’ parameter that measures how\ndifferent the two configurations are. In the solutions of the theory,\nthis intrinsic difference quantity gets minimized, as well as the\nordinary action, and in this way full solutions are derived despite\nnot starting from a privileged inertial-frame description. The theory\nthey end up with turns out to be, in effect, a fragment of Newtonian\ntheory: the set of models of Newtonian mechanics and gravitation in\nwhich there is zero net angular momentum. This result makes perfect\nsense in terms of strict relationist aims. In a Newtonian world in\nwhich there is a nonzero net angular momentum (e.g., a lone rotating\nisland galaxy), this fact reveals itself in the classic\n“tendency to recede from the center”. Since a strict\nrelationist demands that bodies obey the same mechanical laws even in\n‘rotating’ coordinate systems, there cannot be any such\ntendency to recede from the center (other than in a local subsystem),\nin any of the relational theory's models. Since cosmological\nobservations, even today, reveal no net angular momentum in our world,\nthe second Barbour & Bertotti theory can lay claim to exactly the\nsame empirical successes (and problems) that Newtonian physics\nhad. The second theory does not predict the (empirically falsified)\nanisotropy of inertia derivable from the first; but neither does it\nallow a derivation of the precession of the orbit of Mercury, which\nthe first theory does (for appropriately chosen cosmic\nparameters). \n\nMach-lite, like the relational interpretations of Newtonian physics\nreviewed in\n section 5,\n offers us a way of understanding Newtonian physics without accepting\nabsolute position, velocity or acceleration. But it does so in a way\nthat lacks theoretical clarity and elegance, since it does not delimit\na clear set of cosmological models. We know that Mach-lite makes the\nsame predictions as Newton for worlds in which there is a static frame\nassociated with the stars and galaxies; but if asked about how things\nwill behave in a world with no frame of fixed stars, or in which the\nstars are far from ‘fixed’, it shrugs and refuses to\nanswer. (Recall that Mach-lite simply says: “Newton's laws hold\nin the frame of reference of the fixed stars.”) This is\nperfectly acceptable according to Mach's philosophy of science, since\nthe job of mechanics is simply to summarize observable facts in an\neconomical way. But it is unsatisfying to those with stronger realist\nintuitions about laws of nature. \n\nIf there is, in fact, a distinguishable privileged frame of reference\nin which the laws of mechanics take on a specially simple form,\nwithout that frame being determined in any way by relation to the\nmatter distribution, a realist will find it hard to resist the\ntemptation to view motions described in that frame as the\n‘true’ or ‘absolute’ motions. If there is a\nfamily of such frames, disagreeing about velocity but all agreeing\nabout acceleration, she will feel a temptation to think of at least\nacceleration as ‘true’ or ‘absolute’. If such\na realist believes motion to be by nature a relation rather than a\nproperty (and as we saw in the\n Section 1,\n not all philosophers accept this) then she will feel obliged to\naccord some sort of existence or reality to the structure —\ne.g., the structure of Galilean spacetime — in relation to which\nthese motions are defined. For philosophers with such realist\ninclinations, the ideal relational account of motion would therefore\nbe some version of Mach-heavy. \n\nThe Special Theory of Relativity (STR) is notionally based on a\nprinciple of relativity of motion; but that principle is\n‘special’ — meaning, restricted. The relativity\nprinciple built into STR is in fact nothing other than the Galilean\nprinciple of relativity, which is built into Newtonian\n physics.[3]\n In other words, while there is no privileged standard of velocity,\nthere is nevertheless a determinate fact of the matter about whether a\nbody has accelerated or non-accelerated (i.e., inertial) motion. In\nthis regard, the spacetime of STR is exactly like Galilean spacetime\n(defined in section 5 above).  In terms of the question of whether all\nmotion can be considered purely relative, one could argue that there\nis nothing new brought to the table by the introduction of Einstein's\nSTR — at least, as far as mechanics is concerned. (Once again refer\n to the entry on \n  space and time: inertial frames\n for a more detailed discussion.) \n\nAs Dorling (1978) first pointed out, however, there is a sense in\nwhich the standard absolutist arguments against ‘strict’\nrelationism using rotating objects (buckets or globes) fail in the\ncontext of STR. Maudlin (1993) used the same considerations to show\nthat there is a way of recasting relationism in STR that appears to be\nvery successful. \n\nSTR incorporates certain novelties concerning the nature of time and\nspace, and how they mesh together; perhaps the best-known examples are\nthe phenomena of ‘length contraction’, ‘time\ndilation’, and the ‘relativity of\n simultaneity.’[4]\n Since in STR both spatial distances and time intervals — when\nmeasured in the standard ways — are observer-relative (observers\nin different states of motion ‘disagreeing’ about their\nsizes), it is arguably most natural to restrict oneself to the\ninvariant spacetime separation given by the interval between\ntwo points: [dx2 + dy2 +\ndz2 — dt2] — the\nfour-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem, for spacetime\ndistances. If one regards the spacetime interval relations between\nmasses-at-times as one's basis on which space-time is built up as an\nideal entity, then with only mild caveats relationism works: the\n‘relationally pure’ facts suffice to uniquely fix how the\nmaterial systems are embeddable (up to isomorphism) in the\n‘Minkowski’ spacetime of STR. The modern variants of\nNewton's bucket and globes arguments no longer stymie the relationist\nbecause (for example) the spacetime interval relations among bits of\nmatter in Newton's bucket at rest are quite different from the\nspacetime interval relations found among those same bits of matter\nafter the bucket is rotating. For example, the spacetime\ninterval relation between a bit of water near the side of the\nbucket, at one time, and itself (say) a second later is\nsmaller than the interval relation between a center-bucket\nbit of water and itself one second later (times referred to\ninertial-frame clocks). The upshot is that, unlike the situation in\nclassical physics, a body at rest cannot have all the same spatial\nrelations among its parts as a similar body in rotation. We cannot put\na body or system into a state of rotation (or other acceleration)\nwithout thereby changing the spacetime interval relations between the\nvarious bits of matter at different moments of time. Rotation and\nacceleration supervene on spacetime interval relations. \n\nIt is worth pausing to consider to what extent this victory for (some\nform of) relationism satisfies the classical ‘strict’\nrelationism traditionally ascribed to Mach and Leibniz. The\nspatiotemporal relations that save the day against the bucket and\nglobes are, so to speak, mixed spatial and temporal distances. They\nare thus quite different from the spatial-distances-at-a-time\npresupposed by classical relationists; moreover they do not correspond\nto relative velocities (-at-a-time) either. Their oddity is forcefully\ncaptured by noticing that if we choose appropriate bits of matter at\n‘times’ eight minutes apart, I-now am at zero\ndistance from the surface of the sun (of eight minutes\n‘past’, since it took 8 minutes for light from the sun to\nreach me-now). So we are by no means dealing here with an innocuous,\n‘natural’ translation of classical relationist quantities\ninto the STR setting. On the other hand, in light of the relativity of\nsimultaneity (see note [4]),\nit can be argued that the absolute simultaneity presupposed by\nclassical relationists and absolutists alike was, in fact, something\nthat relationists should always have regarded with misgivings. From\nthis perspective, instantaneous relational configurations —\nprecisely what one starts with in the theories of Barbour and Bertotti\n— would be the things that should be treated with suspicion. \n\nIf we now return to our questions about motions — about the\nnature of velocities and accelerations — we find, as noted\nabove, that matters in the interval-relational interpretation of STR\nare much the same as in Newtonian mechanics in Galilean\nspacetime. There are no well-defined absolute velocities, but there\nare indeed well-defined absolute accelerations and rotations. In fact,\nthe difference between an accelerating body (e.g., a rocket) and an\ninertially moving body is codified directly in the cross-temporal\ninterval relations of the body with itself. So we are very\nfar from being able to conclude that all motion is relative motion of\na body with respect to other bodies. It is true that the\nabsolute motions are in 1–1 correlation with patterns of spacetime\ninterval relations, but it is not at all correct to say that they are,\nfor that reason, eliminable in favor of merely relative\nmotions. Rather we should simply say that no absolute acceleration can\nfail to have an effect on the material body or bodies accelerated. But\nthis was already true in classical physics if matter is modeled\nrealistically: the cord connecting the globes does not merely tense,\nbut also stretches; and so does the bucket, even if imperceptibly,\ni.e., the spatial relations change. \n\nMaudlin does not claim this version of relationism to be victorious\nover an absolutist or substantivalist conception of Minkowski\nspacetime, when it comes time to make judgments about the theory's\nontology. There may be more to vindicating relationism than merely\nestablishing a 1–1 correlation between absolute motions and patterns\nof spatiotemporal relations. \n\nThe simple comparison made above between STR and Newtonian physics in\nGalilean spacetime is somewhat deceptive. For one thing, Galilean\nspacetime is a mathematical innovation posterior to\nEinstein's 1905 theory; before then, Galilean spacetime had not been\nconceived, and full acceptance of Newtonian mechanics implied\naccepting absolute velocities and, arguably, absolute positions, just\nas laid down in the Scholium. So Einstein's elimination of\nabsolute velocity was a genuine conceptual advance. Moreover, the\nScholium was not the only reason for supposing that there\nexisted a privileged reference frame of ‘rest’: the\nworking assumption of almost all physicists in the latter half of the\n19th century was that, in order to understand the wave theory of\nlight, one had to postulate an aetherial medium filling all space,\nwave-like disturbances in which constituted electromagnetic\nradiation. It was assumed that the aether rest frame would be an\ninertial reference frame; and physicists felt some temptation to\nequate its frame with the absolute rest frame, though this was not\nnecessary.  Regardless of this equation of the aether with absolute\nspace, it was assumed by all 19th century physicists that the\nequations of electrodynamic theory would have to look different in a\nreference frame moving with respect to the aether than they did in the\naether's rest frame (where they presumably take their canonical form,\ni.e., Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law.) So while\ntheoreticians labored to find plausible transformation rules for the\nelectrodynamics of moving bodies, experimentalists tried to detect the\nEarth's motion in the aether. Experiment and theory played\ncollaborative roles, with experimental results ruling out certain\ntheoretical moves and suggesting new ones, while theoretical advances\ncalled for new experimental tests for their confirmation or — as\nit happened — disconfirmation. \n\nAs is well known, attempts to detect the Earth's velocity in the\naether were unsuccessful. On the theory side, attempts to formulate the\ntransformation laws for electrodynamics in moving frames — in\nsuch a way as to be compatible with experimental results — were\ncomplicated and \n inelegant.[5]\n A simplified way of seeing how Einstein swept away a host of problems\nat a stroke is this: he proposed that the Galilean principle of\nrelativity holds for Maxwell's theory, not just for mechanics. The\ncanonical (‘rest-frame’) form of Maxwell's equations\nshould be their form in any inertial reference frame. Since\nthe Maxwell equations dictate the velocity c of\nelectromagnetic radiation (light), this entails that any inertial\nobserver, no matter how fast she is moving, will measure the velocity\nof a light ray as c — no matter what the relative\nvelocity of its emitter. Einstein worked out logically the\nconsequences of this application of the special relativity principle,\nand discovered that space and time must be rather different from how\nNewton described them. STR undermined Newton's absolute time just as\ndecisively as it undermined his absolute space. \n\nEinstein's STR was the first clear and empirically successful physical\ntheory to overtly eliminate the concepts of absolute rest and absolute\nvelocity while recovering most of the successes of classical\nmechanics and 19th century electrodynamics. It therefore deserves to\nbe considered the first highly successful theory to explicitly\nrelativize motion, albeit only partially. But STR only recovered most\nof the successes of classical physics: crucially, it left out\ngravity. And there was certainly reason to be concerned that Newtonian\ngravity and STR would prove incompatible: classical gravity acted\ninstantaneously at a distance, while STR eliminated the privileged\nabsolute simultaneity that this instantaneous action presupposes. \n\nSeveral ways of modifying Newtonian gravity to make it compatible with\nthe spacetime structure of STR suggested themselves to physicists in\nthe years 1905–1912, and a number of interesting Lorentz-covariant\ntheories were proposed (set in the Minkowski spacetime of STR).\nEinstein rejected these efforts one and all, for violating either\nempirical facts or theoretical desiderata. But Einstein's chief reason\nfor not pursuing the reconciliation of gravitation with STR's\nspacetime appears to have been his desire, beginning in 1907, to\nreplace STR with a theory in which not only velocity could be\nconsidered merely relative, but also acceleration. That is to say,\nEinstein wanted if possible to completely eliminate all absolute\nquantities of motion from physics, thus realizing a theory that\nsatisfies at least one kind of ‘strict’\nrelationism. (Regarding Einstein's rejection of Lorentz-covariant\ngravity theories, see Norton 1992; regarding Einstein's quest to fully\nrelativize motion, see Hoefer 1994.) \n\nEinstein began to see this complete relativization as possible in\n1907, thanks to his discovery of the Equivalence Principle. Imagine we\nare far out in space, in a rocket ship accelerating at a constant rate\ng = 9.98 m/s2. Things will feel\njust like they do on the surface of the Earth; we will feel a clear\nup-down direction, bodies will fall to the floor when released,\netc. Indeed, due to the well-known empirical fact that gravity affects\nall bodies by imparting a force proportional to their matter (and\nenergy) content, independent of their internal constitution, we know\nthat any experiment performed on this rocket will give the same\nresults that the same experiment would give if performed on the\nEarth. Now, Newtonian theory teaches us to consider the apparent\ndownward, gravity-like forces in the rocket ship as\n‘pseudo-forces’ or ‘inertial forces’, and\ninsists that they are to be explained by the fact that the ship is\naccelerating in absolute space. But Einstein asked whether there is\nany way for the person in the rocket to regard him/herself as being\n‘at rest’ rather than in absolute (accelerated)\nmotion? And the answer he gave is: Yes. The rocket traveler may\nregard him/herself as being ‘at rest’ in a homogeneous and\nuniform gravitational field. This will explain all the observational\nfacts just as well as the supposition that he/she is accelerating\nrelative to absolute space (or, absolutely accelerating in Minkowski\nspacetime). But is it not clear that the latter is the truth, while\nthe former is a fiction? By no means; if there were a uniform\ngravitational field filling all space, then it would affect all the\nother bodies in the world — the Earth, the stars, etc, imparting\nto them a downward acceleration away from the rocket; and that is\nexactly what the traveler observes. \n\nIn 1907, Einstein published his first gravitation theory (Einstein\n1907), treating the gravitational field as a scalar field that also\nrepresented the (now variable and frame-dependent) speed of light.\nEinstein viewed the theory as only a first step on the road to\neliminating absolute motion. In the 1907 theory, the theory's\nequations take the same form in any inertial or uniformly\naccelerating frame of reference. One might say that this theory\nreduces the class of absolute motions, leaving only rotation and other\nnon-uniform accelerations as absolute. But, Einstein reasoned, if\nuniform acceleration can be regarded as equivalent to being at rest in\na constant gravitational field, why should it not be possible also to\nregard inertial effects from these other, non-uniform motions as\nsimilarly equivalent to “being at rest in a (variable)\ngravitational field”? Thus Einstein set himself the goal of\nexpanding the principle of equivalence to embrace all forms of\n‘accelerated’ motion. \n\nEinstein thought that the key to achieving this aim lay in further\nexpanding the range of reference frames in which the laws of physics\ntake their canonical form, to include frames adapted to any arbitrary\nmotions. More specifically, since the class of all continuous and\ndifferentiable coordinate systems includes as a proper subclass the\ncoordinate systems adapted to any such frame of reference, if he could\nachieve a theory of gravitation, electromagnetism and mechanics that\nwas generally covariant — its equations taking the same\nform in any coordinate system from this general class — then the\ncomplete relativity of motion would be achieved. If there are no\nspecial frames of reference in which the laws take on a simpler\ncanonical form, there is no physical reason to consider any particular\nstate or states of motion as privileged, nor deviations from those as\nrepresenting ‘absolute motion’. (Here we are just laying\nout Einstein's train of thought; later we will see reasons to question\nthe last step.)  And in 1915, Einstein achieved his aim in the General\nTheory of Relativity (GTR). \n\nThere is one key element left out of this success story, however, and\nit is crucial to understanding why most physicists reject Einstein's\nclaim to have eliminated absolute states of motion in GTR.  Going back\nto our accelerating rocket, we accepted Einstein's claim that we could\nregard the ship as hovering at rest in a universe-filling\ngravitational field. But a gravitational field, we usually suppose, is\ngenerated by matter. How is this universe-filling field linked to\ngenerating matter? The answer may be supplied by Mach-heavy. Regarding\nthe ‘accelerating’ rocket which we decide to regard as\n‘at rest’ in a gravitational field, the Machian says: all\nthose stars and galaxies, etc., jointly accelerating downward\n(relative to the rocket), ‘produce’ that gravitational\nfield. The mathematical specifics of how this field is generated will\nhave to be different from Newton's law of gravity, of course; but it\nshould give essentially the same results when applied to low-mass,\nslow-moving problems such as the orbits of the planets, so as to\ncapture the empirical successes of Newtonian gravity. Einstein\nthought, in 1916 at least, that the field equations of GTR are\nprecisely this mathematical replacement for Newton's law of gravity,\nand that they fully satisfied the desiderata of Mach-heavy\nrelationism.  But it was not so. (See the entry on\n early philosophical interpretations of general relativity.) \n\nIn GTR, spacetime is locally very much like flat Minkowski\nspacetime. There is no absolute velocity locally, but there are clear\nlocal standards of accelerated vs non-accelerated motion, i.e., local\ninertial frames. In these ‘freely falling’ frames bodies\nobey the usual rules for non-gravitational physics familiar from STR,\nalbeit only approximately. But overall spacetime is curved, and local\ninertial frames may tip, bend and twist as we move from one region to\nanother. The structure of curved spacetime is encoded in the metric\nfield tensor gab, with the curvature\nencoding gravity at the same time: gravitational forces are so to\nspeak ‘built into’ the metric field, geometrized\naway. Since the spacetime structure encodes gravity and inertia, and\nin a Mach-heavy theory these phenomena should be completely determined\nby the relational distribution of matter (and relative motions),\nEinstein wished to see the metric as entirely determined by the\ndistribution of matter and energy. But what the GTR field equations\nentail is, in general, only a partial-determination relation. \n\nWe cannot go into the mathematical details necessary for a full\ndiscussion of the successes and failures of Mach-heavy in the GTR\ncontext. But one can see why the Machian interpretation Einstein hoped\nhe could give to the curved spacetimes of his theory fails to be\nplausible, by considering a few simple ‘worlds’ permitted\nby GTR. In the first place, for our hovering rocket ship, if we are to\nattribute the gravity field it feels to matter, there has got to\nbe all this other matter in the universe. But if we regard\nthe rocket as a mere ‘test body’ (not itself substantially\naffecting the gravity present or absent in the universe), then we can\nnote that according to GTR, if we remove all the stars, galaxies,\nplanets etc. from the world, the gravitational field does not\ndisappear. On the contrary, it stays basically the same locally, and\nglobally it takes the form of empty Minkowski spacetime, precisely the\nquasi-absolute structure Einstein was hoping to eliminate. Solutions\nof the GTR field equations for arbitrary realistic configurations of\nmatter (e.g., a rocket ship ejecting a stream of particles to push\nitself forward) are hard to come by, and in fact a realistic two-body\nexact solution has yet to be discovered. But numerical methods can be\napplied for many purposes, and physicists do not doubt that something\nlike our accelerating rocket — in otherwise empty space —\nis possible according to the\n theory.[6]\n We see clearly, then, that GTR fails to satisfy Einstein's own\nunderstanding of Mach's Principle, according to which, in the absence\nof matter, space itself should not be able to exist. A second example:\nGTR allows us to model a single rotating object in an\notherwise empty universe (e.g., a neutron star). Relationism of the\nMachian variety says that such rotation is impossible, since it can\nonly be understood as rotation relative to some sort of absolute\nspace. In the case of GTR, this is basically right: the rotation is\nbest understood as rotation relative to a ‘background’\nspacetime that is identical to the Minkowski spacetime of STR, only\n‘curved’ by the presence of matter in the region of the\nstar. \n\nOn the other hand, there is one charge of failure-to-relativize-motion\nsometimes leveled at GTR that is unfair.  It is sometimes asserted\nthat the simple fact that the metric field (or the connection it\ndetermines) distinguishes, at every location, motions that are\n‘absolutely’ accelerated and/or ‘absolutely\nrotating’ from those that are not, by itself entails that GTR\nfails to embody a folk-Leibniz style general relativity of motion\n(e.g.  Earman (1989), ch. 5). We think this is incorrect, and leads to\nunfairly harsh judgments about confusion on Einstein's part. The local\ninertial structure encoded in the metric would not be\n‘absolute’ in any meaningful sense, if that structure were\nin some clear sense fully determined by the relationally specified\nmatter-energy distribution. Einstein was not simply confused\nwhen he named his gravity theory. (Just what is to be understood by\n“the relationally specified matter-energy distribution” is\na further, thorny issue, which we cannot enter into here.) \n\nGTR does not fulfill all the goals of Mach-heavy, at least as\nunderstood by Einstein, and he recognized this fact by 1918 (Einstein\n1918). And yet … GTR comes tantalizingly close to achieving\nthose goals, in certain striking ways. For one thing, GTR does predict\nMach-heavy effects, known as ‘frame-dragging’: if we could\nmodel Mach's thick-walled bucket in GTR, it seems clear that it would\npull the water slightly outward, and give it a slight tendency to\nbegin rotating in the same sense as the bucket (even if the big\nbucket's walls were not actually touching the water. While GTR does\npermit us to model a lone rotating object, if we model the object as a\nshell of mass (instead of a solid sphere) and let the size of the\nshell increase (to model the ‘sphere of the fixed stars’\nwe see around us), then as Brill & Cohen (1966) showed, the\nframe-dragging becomes complete inside the shell. In other words: our\noriginal Minkowski background structure effectively disappears, and\ninertia becomes wholly determined by the shell of matter, just as Mach\nposited was the case. This complete determination of inertia by the\nglobal matter distribution appears to be a feature of other models,\nincluding the Friedman-Robertson-Walker-Lemâitre Big Bang models\nthat best match observations of our universe. \n\nFinally, it is important to recognize that GTR is generally covariant\nin a very special sense: unlike all other prior theories (and unlike\nmany subsequent quantum theories), it postulates no fixed\n‘prior’ or ‘background’ spacetime\nstructure. As mathematicians and physicists realized early on, other\ntheories, e.g., Newtonian mechanics and STR, can be put into a\ngenerally covariant form. But when this is done, there are inevitably\nmathematical objects postulated as part of the formalism, whose role\nis to represent absolute elements of spacetime structure. What is\nunique about GTR is that it was the first, and is still the only\n‘core’ physical theory, to have no such absolute elements\nin its covariant equations. The spacetime structure in GTR,\nrepresented by the metric field (which determines the connection), is\nat least partly ‘shaped’ by the distribution of matter and\nenergy. And in certain models of the theory, such as the Big Bang\ncosmological models, some authors have claimed that the local\nstandards of inertial motion — the local ‘gravitational\nfield’ of Einstein's equivalence principle — are entirely\nfixed by the matter distribution throughout space and time, just as\nMach-heavy requires (see, for example, Wheeler and Cuifollini\n1995). \n\nAbsolutists and relationists are thus left in a frustrating and\nperplexing quandary by GTR. Considering its anti-Machian models, we\nare inclined to say that motions such as rotation and acceleration\nremain absolute, or nearly-totally-absolute, according to the\ntheory. On the other hand, considering its most Mach-friendly models,\nwhich include all the models taken to be good candidates for\nrepresenting the actual universe, we may be inclined to say: motion\nin our world is entirely relative; the inertial effects\nnormally used to argue for absolute motion are all understandable as\neffects of rotations and accelerations relative to the cosmic matter,\njust as Mach hoped. But even if we agree that motions in our world are\nin fact all relative in this sense, this does not automatically settle\nthe traditional relationist/absolutist debate, much less the\nrelationist/substantivalist debate. Many philosophers (including, we\nsuspect, Nerlich 1994 and Earman 1989) would be happy to acknowledge\nthe Mach-friendly status of our spacetime, and argue nevertheless that\nwe should understand that spacetime as a real thing, more like a\nsubstance than a mere ideal construct of the mind as Leibniz\ninsisted. Some, though not all, attempts to convert GTR into a quantum\ntheory would accord spacetime this same sort of substantiality that\nother quantum fields possess. Since 2000 a new approach to the issue of the nature of space-time\nstructures has emerged, in the works of Robert Disalle, and especially\nOliver Pooley and Harvey Brown.  The latter's ‘dynamical\napproach’ asserts that the space-time structure of our world is\nwhat it is because of the dynamical laws of nature and their\nsymmetries. That is, the dynamical laws are (at least, relative to\nspace-time) fundamental, and space-time structure is derivative.\nCorrespondingly, the dynamical approach (DA) rejects the view that\nputs the explanatory arrow in the opposite direction, i.e., the claim\nthat the dynamical laws are how they are, in part, because they are\nconstrained to “fit” the independently real structure of\n(substantival or absolute, in some sense(s) at least) space-time. There is a tight relationship between the geometrical symmetries of\na spacetime and the (spatiotemporal) symmetries of a theory that\ndescribes the physics of matter (in a broad sense, including fields)\nin it. (Theories such as GTR, in which spacetime has its own dynamics\nare more complicated, and will be discussed later.) Each is a set of\ntransformations, with a rule of composition: formally a\n‘group’. (For instance, the group of rotations in the\nplane has a distinct element for every angle in the range 0–360\ndegrees; the composition of two rotations is of course the single\nrotation through the sum of their angles.) There are good reasons to\nhold that the symmetry groups of theory and spacetime must\nagree. First, since the theory describes matter, and hence (arguably)\nwhat is measurable, any theoretical symmetries not reflected in the\npostulated spacetime structure indicate unmeasurable geometry: for\ninstance, if an absolute present were postulated in relativistic\nphysics. While in the other direction, if there were extra spacetime\nsymmetries not beyond those found in the dynamics, then per\nimpossible one could measure nonexistent geometric quantities:\nfor instance, a theory that depends on absolute velocities cannot be\nformulated in Galilean spacetime.. (Earman 1989, Chapter 3 is a good\ndiscussion.) A given geometry for spacetime thus formally constrains the\nallowable theories to those with the just the right symmetries —\nnot too many, and not too few. It was an assumption of many\nsubstantivalists that this constraint was not merely formal, but\nontological: that the geometry (hence the manifold itself) is more\nfundamental than the laws, or that geometry offers a\n‘real’ explanation of the form of the laws. (For instance,\nsuch a line of thought is implicit in Earman 1989, 125.) However, that\nthe symmetries should agree does not specify any direction of\ndependence, and it could be reversed, so that the geometric symmetries\nare ontologically determined by those of the laws of the theory\n— hence the geometry itself is an expression of the dynamics of\nmatter. In the words of Brown and Pooley (2006) (making these points\nabout STR): “… space-time's Minkowskian structure cannot\nbe taken to explain the Lorentz covariance of the dynamical\nlaws. From our perspective … the direction of explanation goes\nthe other way around. It is the Lorentz covariance of the laws that\nunderwrites the fact that the geometry of space-time is\nMinkowskian.”  In its denial of the independence or fundamentality of space-time\nstructure, DA is in the relationist tradition. On the other hand,\nprima facie DA offers no direct account of what sorts of\nspatio-temporal (or other, e.g. causal) relations are to be taken as\nprimitive and unproblematic, so it is not immediately clear how it\nrelates to the tradition. However, further explication of the approach\nquickly leads to clarification of the relationist commitments of the\ntheory, for can one in fact state dynamical laws, or understand them\nas “holding” or “governing”, without\npresupposing [facts about] space-time structure?  Take Newton's three laws plus the law of gravity as a test case for\nDA.  The gravity law gives the gravitational force between any two\nbits of matter, as a function of their distance and the direction from\none body to the other.  At least the distances of all things from each\nother, at a moment of time, is presupposed.  So far this sounds\nunproblematic; instantaneous distances are the meat and potatoes of\nrelationism, and presupposing their existence would be be no threat to\nthe DA.  But when we turn to Newton's First and Second Laws, things\nlook more problematic. The First Law asserts that bodies not acted\nupon by an external force will move with constant velocity; similarly\nfor the Second Law and acceleration. The laws seem to presuppose that\nthese are meaningful terms, but in spacetime terms their meaning is\ngiven in by geometric structures: for instance, constant velocity in\nGalilean spacetime means having a straight spacetime trajectory. And\nthe problem is not restricted to Newtonian physics; the same point can\nbe made regarding theories that presuppose the Minkowski background\nspace-time structure, e.g., the quantum field theories of the\nStandard Model. The advocate of DA will take laws such as Newton's as not\npresupposing background space-time, but rather entailing that things\nbehave ‘as if’ they were embedded in such a background.\nWhile there's nothing intrinsically problematic about as-if\nclaims, it can't be left as a mere flat-footed assertion.  If\nthings are not in fact embedded in a space-time, then the DA advocate\nshould tell us what elements of physical theory do in fact represent\nreal things (and their properties/relations), and how their behavior\ncan be understood as giving rise to the appearance of a background\nspace-time.  The DA advocate is thus drawn into engaging in a defense\nof some sort of relationism.  Moreover, the DA advocate has to explain\nthe sense in which dynamical laws that apparently presuppose\nspatio-temporal structures can be true of a world that lacks such\nstructures intrinsically and ‘has’ them only in a\nderivative, as-if sense. It's worth stressing that while DA opposes fundamental\nabsolute quantities, it is potentially neutral on the question of\nmanifold substantivalism (indeed, this topic barely appears in Brown\n2005). That is, one could develop a view in which the manifold is as\n‘real’as matter, but in which it does not\nhave its geometric (as opposed to topological, say) properties\nintrinsically — they are possessed in virtue of the laws. As it\nturns out, that is not the approach that advocates of DA have tended\nto take. (Norton's (2008) criticizes the substantivalist version\nof DA). One obvious way to address the question is to appeal to\nHuggett's (2006) regularity relationism discussed above: see\nHuggett (2009) and Pooley (2013). The idea is to consider the\ndynamical laws as regularities that systematize and describe the\npatterns of events concerning an underlying ontology/ideology that\ninvolves or presupposes only very limited spatiotemporal features.  To\nillustrate how this approach might go, consider Pooley's proposal that\nthe dynamical approach to special-relativistic theories might\npostulate only R4 topological spatiotemporal structure, which could be\n(for example) attributed to a massive scalar field. Suppose we are given a full 4-D field description of such a field, in\nterms of some arbitrary coordinate system.  This would describe a\nsimple ‘Humean mosaic‘ for a world with just a scalar field as\ncontent.  Now, smooth coordinate changes applied to such a description\nwill generate distinct mathematical representations of that Humean\nmosaic, given using distinct coordinatizations of the field-stuff.\nIt might happen that, among all such representations, there is a\nsubclass of coordinate systems which are such that (i) when the\nscalar field is described using a member of the class, it turns out\nthat its values at spacetime points satisfy some simple/elegant\nmathematical equation; and moreover, (ii) the members of the class are\nrelated by a nicely specifiable symmetry group.  If this is so, then\nthe simple/elegant equation can be taken as expressing a dynamical\nlaw for the world of this mosaic, and the symmetry group of the law\ncan be seen as capturing the derivative, not intrinsic, space-time\nstructure of the world.  If the symmetry group is the Poincaré group,\nfor example, then the field behaves ‘as if’ it were embedded in a\nspacetime with Minkowski geometry. But all this means is that the\ndynamics is empirically equivalent to a theory with intrinsic\nMinkowski geometry. From the point of view of DA, such a theory is\nmerely an interesting, and perhaps useful, representation of the real\nfacts: and it's a mistake to take every feature of a representation to\ncorrespond to something in reality. Forthright investigation of DA as a variant of regularity relationism\nhas only just begun, but extending the treatment from scalar fields to\nmore complex vector-, tensor- and spinor-fields may present a\nproblem. It's true that vector and tensors can be defined in terms of\ncoordinates and scalar fields, and one could imagine telling a formal\nstory about these along the lines sketched for the scalar field: the\nequations governing them take an especially simple — and Lorentz\ninvariant — form in certain coordinates. But it is not clear\nthat such mathematical fields can be taken to properly represent\nphysical fields without a metric: for instance, as Earman (1989, 106)\npoints out, such quantities as the energy density cannot be defined\nwithout a metric. However, a large part of the appeal of the DA is\nthat it classes intangible, mathematical structures — geometry\n— as mere representation, and tangible things — matter\n(including fields) and its properties — as real. If formal\n— pre-metrical — fields don't represent the concrete\nobjects found in the world, then it is hard to see why the DA is an\nadvance on taking geometry as a literal structure of the world. In\nother words, an account is owed of how a tensor, say, represents the\nelectromagnetic field without a metric. The dynamical approach has only recently been much discussed as a\ngeneral doctrine about space-time.  In Brown (2005) and earlier works,\nit is better known via a set of distinctive and specific claims made\nin the context of special relativistic physics and General\nRelativity. This subsection and the next will briefly analyze some of\nthose claims. The most striking and controversial claim made by DA advocates\nBrown & Pooley concerns the special relativistic phenomena of\nlength contraction and time dilation and how one should best\nunderstand them to be explained.  A common view among realists about\nspacetime is that these phenomena are explained by the fact that\nmoving rods and clocks exist in a spacetime with (locally) Minkowski\nstructure.  It is because both we (and our measuring devices), and the\nmoving rod, are living in such a spacetime, that we measure the\nfast-moving rod to be contracted in length.  By contrast, the DA\nclaims that rods and clocks behave as they do because of the dynamical\nlaws.  The fact that those laws are Lorentz-covariant (i.e., have as\ntheir symmetries the Poincaré group of transformations) is sufficient\nto guarantee that rods and clocks will behave in the ways predicted in\nspecial relativity theory; the laws explain both those phenomena, and\nthe fact that spacetime “has” Minkowski structure. (Important\ndiscussions of these issues can also be found in Janssen, 2009, and\nFrisch, 2011.) But the claim that an explanation starting from the Lorentz\ncovariance of the laws is the best or “right” sort of explanation can\nbe challenged, in at least two ways. First, there is an alternative view of length contraction and time\ndilation in special relativity, according to which the best\nexplanation is no explanation, because they are not\n“real” phenomena, in the relevant sense, at all.  On this\nview such ‘kinematical’ effects are to be thought of as\nsomething more like perspective-based illusions.  What is real are the\nquantities that are ‘intrinsic’ or\n‘invariant’, i.e., the same no matter what reference frame\nor coordinate system is chosen to describe things.  “Proper\nlength” and “proper time” (length as measured when\nat rest, and time as measured by a co-moving clock respectively) are\nintrinsic/real features of bodies and processes, and correspond to the\n(frame-invariant) space-time interval between certain well defined\nspace-time points.  But length-as-measured-by-a-moving-observer, which\nis essentially a frame- or coordinate-dependent quantity that varies\ndepending on the state of motion of the observer, is not an invariant\nor intrinsic quantity, and therefore does not require\na physical explanation at \nall.[7]\n Brown (2005) rejects this view, as do many\nother philosophers of physics (in part due to issues mentioned in the\nnote just above), but many others still defend it. Let's set this no-explanation-needed view aside and consider the\nspacetime realist perspective mentioned above. \nBrown rejects the notion, which can be glimpsed in some passages by\nadvocates of substantival spacetime, that spacetime's structure\nshould be thought of as causing fast-moving bodies to shrink in\nlength, etc.  But geometric realists need not claim that the\nexplanatory relation between spacetime structure and length\ncontraction is causal; on this view, it is more naturally viewed as\nlogical.  That is to say: in a Minkowski spacetime, if one\nhas “rigid rods” and “clocks”, and uses these\nin the standard ways to measure the “length” of a (rigid)\nmoving body in the direction of its motion, it is a simple\nmathematical or geometrical fact that the moving body will be measured\nas having its length contracted in accord with the Lorentz-Fitzgerald\nformula.  In many relativity texts students learn how to derive these\neffects geometrically on Minkowski spacetime diagrams. Nothing about\nthe dynamics governing these bodies is assumed, other than that the\ndynamics does indeed allow for the existence of such\n“clocks” and “rigid rods”. Pooley (2013) writes: “The substantivalist should agree that\na complex material rod does not conform to the axioms of some geometry\nsimply because that is the substantival geometry in which it is\nimmersed; the rod would not do what it does were the laws governing\nits microphysical parts different in key respects.” In one\nimportant sense, the substantivalist can insist that the rod does and\nmust conform to the axioms of Minkowski geometry simply because it\nlives in Minkowski spacetime.  If an object exists in a space or\nspacetime of X-geometry, no physical laws, or forces, can force the\nrelations of its parts to violate the axioms of X-geometry. In another\nsense, however, Pooley is clearly right. If the laws were very\ndifferent, there might be no rigid bodies with constant intrinsic\n(rest-) length.  Different laws or exotic forces might\n“cause” objects to do all sorts of strange things (shrink\nor expand, in any time-variable way you like); with just the right\ndynamical laws, it might be possible in a Minkowski world to have\n“rods” and “clocks” that operate in ways that\nappear to reveal the world as having Newtonian (or spherical, or\n…) spacetime structure. The substantivalist can respond that in such a case, those rods\nwould not measure space-like interval, and those clocks would not\nmeasure time-like interval, i.e., would not measure the true distances\nin a spacetime with Minkowski metric structure.  Those rods and clocks\nwould still conform to Minkowski geometry; logically speaking, they\nhave no choice.  They would just not transparently reveal it. It is unclear whether this response amounts to much of a victory\nfor the substantivalist.  In a world where the rods and clocks (and,\nlet us grant, all other phenomena) seem to reveal (say) a Newtonian\nspacetime geometry, what is the status of the putative “real”\nMinkowski geometry lurking underneath?  Would it even deserve to be\ncalled the “true” spacetime geometry? The problem can be put this way:\nwhy do the symmetries of the dynamics have to respect the geometry of\nspacetime? There is no comparable question for the DA proponent,\nsince for her the geometry simply represents whatever symmetries there\nare. This sort of question arises also in the case of General\nRelativity, as we will now see. General Relativity theory is, at first blush, very congenial to the\ncore idea of the dynamical approach.  The DA insists that the\nstructure of space and time is not something existing in its own\nright, independently of the laws of nature that happen to hold in the\nworld.  In General Relativity (GR) there is no fixed, prior or\n“background” spacetime structure that could be seen as independent of\nthe dynamical laws; on the contrary, spacetime structure is\nexplicitly constrained by, arguably directly determined by, the\ndynamical laws, i.e., Einstein's field equations (EFE). On the other hand, in GR one cannot see the structure of spacetime\nas merely a reflection of the symmetry properties of the dynamical\nlaws, as the DA claims we should do in the case of theories with\nfixed background geometries. The symmetries of EFE are usually considered to\nbe the general general covariance group of continuously differentiable\ntransformations, which would seem to correspond to no spacetime\nstructure at all (or at most, topological structure with no metrical\nproperties).  If there is a sense in which the DA slogan that laws\ncome first, spacetime structure second is to make sense — over and\nabove the sense noted just above — it will have to be different than\nhow this plays out in earlier theories. Brown (2005) offers just such a different way of understanding the\nspirit of the DA in GR.  He claims (i) that the\nmetric g should be thought of as, in the\nfirst instance, just a physical field, akin in principle to\nthe electromagnetic field; and (ii) it does not have the significance\nof representing the metrical structure of space and time\na priori, but instead “earns” that significance\nbecause the laws governing other matter fields happen to\ninvolve g in such a way that they behave as\nif they constituted, e.g., rods and clocks, in a geometry described\nby g.  For Brown this is the content of the\n‘weak equivalence principle’.  In this way Brown maintains\nthat, in GR as before, it is dynamics (how things actually move) that\nis explanatorily prior, and spacetime structure\n(g having the role of representing spacetime\ngeometry) that is posterior. Both of these claims are controversial.  (i) is by no means the\nstandard view in physics presentations of GR, and is somewhat in\ntension with standard presentations that\ntreat g as representing straightforwardly\nthe geometry of spacetime, and sharply distinguish it from fields\nrepresenting the material “contents” of spacetime.  More\nimportantly, (ii) is in tension with the history\nof g's introduction into physics by Einstein\nin 1913–1915, as well as with standard textbook presentations\nof g and its role in GR. In support of claim (ii) Brown (2005, ch. 9) discusses a recent\nalternative gravity theory, Bekenstein's TeVeS theory, which actually\nhas two g-like tensors; one plays the purely\nmathematical role of the metric, e.g. serving to raise and lower\nindices on other tensor fields and determining the mathematical\nderivative operator, while the other is the “apparent”\nmetric structure of spacetime, corresponding to what moving rods and\nclocks survey.  For Brown, the TeVeS theory makes vivid the conceptual\ndifference between the purely mathematical role of “metric\ntensor” and the role of codifying observable geometry; they\nhappen to coincide in GR, but this is in a sense a contingent fact,\nnot something guaranteed a priori by GR's mathematical\napparatus. But it is unclear that Brown is justified in drawing lessons about\nthe metric g of General Relativity from\nTeVeS, which is, after all, a quite different theory from GR.  In that\ntheory the two roles of g are separated by\ndesign; though the consistency of the theory overall, and its ability\nto adequately model its intended target systems in the real world must\nbe established by calculations and arguments, what element of the\ntheory represents what physical aspect of reality is specified in the\noriginal presentation of the theory — in the ordinary-language\ntext surrounding the equations, in effect.  The same can be said of\nGR.  In GR, Einstein made clear from the start\nthat g both serves as the\nmathematical/geometric metric of spacetime, and also determines the\nmetrical and inertial (affine) structure surveyed by light rays and\nmoving bodies.  In GR also, the consistency of the theory overall and\nits ability to model its intended target systems had to be established\nby calculation and argument, but the geometric significance\nof g in GR was in fact a postulate or\nstipulation built into the theory from the start.  Without the\nassumption of that geometric significance, the Einstein\ntensor G would not have a clear geometric\nmeaning, and the stress-energy tensor T\nwould not have a clear physical meaning; g qua\nmetric is used in the definition of both. Thus, while GR is consonant with the broad-stroke desiderata of the\nDA, in that spacetime structure is definitely not independent of the\ndynamical laws, i.e., the EFE, Brown's more specific claims about the\nstatus of the spacetime metric in GR are open to dispute. \n\nThis article has been concerned with tracing the history and\nphilosophy of ‘absolute’ and ‘relative’\ntheories of space and motion.  Along the way we have been at pains to\nintroduce some clear terminology for various different concepts (e.g.,\n‘true’ motion, ‘substantivalism’,\n‘absolute space’), but what we have not really done is say\nwhat the difference between absolute and relative space and\nmotion is: just what is at stake? Recently Rynasiewicz (2000) has\nargued that there simply are no constant issues running through the\nhistory that we have discussed here; that there is no stable meaning\nfor either ‘absolute motion’ or ‘relative\nmotion’ (or ‘substantival space’ vs\n‘relational space’). While we agree to a certain extent,\nwe think that nevertheless there are a series of issues that have\nmotivated thinkers again and again; indeed, those that we identified\nin the introduction.  (One quick remark: Rynasiewicz is probably right\nthat the issues cannot be expressed in formally precise terms, but\nthat does not mean that there are no looser philosophical affinities\nthat shed useful light on the history.) \n\nOur discussion has revealed several different issues, of which we will\nhighlight three as components of the ‘absolute-relative\ndebate’.  (i) There is the question of whether all motions and\nall possible descriptions of motions are equal, or whether some are\n‘real’ — what we have called, in Seventeenth Century\nparlance, ‘true’. There is a natural temptation for those\nwho hold that there is ‘nothing but the relative positions and\nmotions between bodies’ (and more so for their readers) to add\n‘and all such motions are equal’, thus denying the\nexistence of true motion. However, arguably — perhaps\nsurprisingly — no one we have discussed has unreservedly held\nthis view (at least not consistently): Descartes considered motion\n‘properly speaking’ to be privileged, Leibniz introduced\n‘active force’ to ground motion (arguably in his mechanics\nas well as metaphysically), and Mach's view seems to be that the\ndistribution of matter in the universe determines a preferred standard\nof inertial motion. (Again, in general relativity, there is a\ndistinction between inertial and accelerated motion.) \n\nThat is, relationists can allow true motions if they offer an analysis\nof them in terms of the relations between bodies. Given this logical\npoint, and given the historical ways thinkers have understood\nthemselves, it seems unhelpful to characterize the issues in (i) as\nconstituting an absolute-relative debate, hence our use of the term\n‘true’ instead of ‘absolute’. So we are led to\nthe second question: (ii) is true motion definable in terms of\nrelations or not? (Of course the answer depends on what kind of\ndefinitions will count, and absent an explicit definition —\nDescartes' proper motion for example — the issue is often taken\nto be that of whether true motions supervene on relations, something\nNewton's globes are often supposed to refute.) It seems reasonable to\ncall this the issue of whether motion is absolute or\nrelative. Descartes and Mach are relationists about motion in this\nsense, while Newton is an absolutist.  Leibniz is also an absolutist\nabout motion in his metaphysics, and if our reading is correct, also\nabout the interpretation of motion in the laws of collision. This\nclassification of Leibniz's views runs contrary to his customary\nidentification as relationist-in-chief, but we will clarify his\nrelationist credentials below. Finally, we have discussed (ii) in the\ncontext of relativity, first examining Maudlin's proposal that the\nembedding of a relationally-specified system in Minkowski spacetime is\nin general unique once all the spacetime interval-distance relations\nare given. This proposal may or may not be held to satisfy the\nrelational-definability question of (ii), but in any case it cannot be\ncarried over to the context of general relativity theory. In the case\nof GTR we linked relational motion to the satisfaction of Mach's\nPrinciple, just as Einstein did in the early years of the theory.\nDespite some promising features displayed by GTR, and certain of its\nmodels, we saw that Mach's Principle is not fully satisfied in GTR as\na whole. We also noted that in the absence of absolute simultaneity,\nit becomes an open question what relations are to be permitted in the\ndefinition (or supervience base) — spacetime interval relations?\nInstantaneous spatial distances and velocities on a 3-d hypersurface?\n(Barbour has argued that GTR is fully Machian, using a 3-d\nrelational-configuration approach. See Barbour, Foster and Murchadha\n2002. This work has recently attracted interest as a potential basis\nfor formulating a quantum theory of gravity: Barbour 2012.) \nThe final issue is that of (iii) whether absolute motion is motion\nwith respect to substantival space or not. Of course this is how\nNewton understood acceleration — as acceleration relative to\nabsolute space. More recent Newtonians share this view, although\nmotion for them is with respect to substantival Galilean spacetime (or\nrather, since they know Newtonian mechanics is false, they hold that\nthis is the best interpretation of that theory). Leibniz denied that\nmotion was relative to space itself, since he denied the reality of\nspace; for him true motion was the possession of active force. So\ndespite his ‘absolutism’ (our adjective not his) about\nmotion he was simultaneously a relationist about space: ‘space\nis merely relative’. Following Leibniz's lead we can call this\ndebate the question of whether space is absolute or relative. The\ndrawback of this name is that it suggests a separation between motion\nand space, which exists in Leibniz's views, but which is otherwise\nproblematic; still, no better description presents itself. \n\nOthers who are absolutists about motion but relationists about space\ninclude Sklar (1974) and van Fraassen (1985); Sklar introduced a\nprimitive quantity of acceleration, not supervenient on motions\nrelative to anything at all, while van Fraassen let the laws\nthemselves pick out the inertial frames. It is of course arguable\nwhether any of these three proposals are successful; (even) stripped\nof Leibniz's Aristotelian packaging, can absolute quantities of motion\n‘stand on their own feet’? And under what understanding of\nlaws can they ground a standard of inertial motion? Huggett (2006)\ndefends a similar position of absolutism about motion, but relationism\nabout space; he argues — in the case of Newtonian physics\n— that fundamentally there is nothing to space but relations\nbetween bodies, but that absolute motions supervene — not on the\nrelations at any one time — but on the entire history of\nrelations.","contact.mail":"huggett@uic.edu","contact.domain":"uic.edu"},{"date.published":"2006-08-11","date.changed":"2015-01-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/","author1":"Nick Huggett","author2":"Carl Hoefer","author1.info":"http://www.uic.edu/~huggett","entry":"spacetime-theories","body.text":"\n\n\n\nSince antiquity, natural philosophers have struggled to comprehend the\nnature of three tightly interconnected concepts: space, time, and\nmotion. A proper understanding of motion, in particular, has been seen\nto be crucial for deciding questions about the natures of space and\ntime, and their interconnections. Since the time of Newton and\nLeibniz, philosophers' struggles to comprehend these concepts\nhave often appeared to take the form of a dispute between\nabsolute conceptions of space, time and motion, and\nrelational conceptions. This article guides the reader\nthrough some of the history of these philosophical struggles. Rather\nthan taking sides in the (alleged) ongoing debates, or reproducing the\nstandard dialectic recounted in most introductory texts, we have\nchosen to scrutinize carefully the history of the thinking of the\ncanonical participants in these debates — principally Descartes,\nNewton, Leibniz, Mach and Einstein. Readers interested in following up\neither the historical questions or current debates about the natures\nof space, time and motion will find ample links and references\nscattered through the discussion and in the\n Other Internet Resources\nsection below.\n\n\n\nThings change. A platitude perhaps, but still a crucial feature of the\nworld, and one which causes many philosophical perplexities —\nsee for instance the entry on \n Zeno's Paradoxes.\n For Aristotle, motion (he would have called it\n‘locomotion’) was just one kind of change, like\ngeneration, growth, decay, fabrication and so on.  The atomists held\non the contrary that all change was in reality the motion of atoms\ninto new configurations, an idea that was not to begin to realize its\nfull potential until the Seventeenth Century, particularly in the work\nof Descartes. (Of course, modern physics seems to show that the\nphysical state of a system goes well beyond the geometrical\nconfiguration of bodies. Fields, while perhaps determined by the states of\nbodies, are not themselves configurations of bodies if interpreted\nliterally, and in quantum mechanics bodies have ‘internal\nstates’ such as particle spin.) \n\nNot all changes seem to be merely the (loco)motions of bodies in\nphysical space. Yet since antiquity, in the western tradition, this\nkind of motion has been absolutely central to the understanding of\nchange. And since motion is a crucial concept in physical theories,\none is forced to address the question of what exactly it is. The\nquestion might seem trivial, for surely what is usually meant by\nsaying that something is moving is that it is moving\nrelative to something, often tacitly understood between\nspeakers. For instance: the car is moving at 60mph (relative to the\nroad and things along it), the plane is flying (relative) to London,\nthe rocket is lifting off (the ground), or the passenger is moving (to\nthe front of the speeding train). Typically the relative reference\nbody is either the surroundings of the speakers, or the Earth, but\nthis is not always the case. For instance, it seems to make sense to\nask whether the Earth rotates about its axis West-East diurnally or\nwhether it is instead the heavens that rotate East-West; but if all\nmotions are to be reckoned relative to the Earth, then its rotation\nseems impossible. But if the Earth does not offer a unique frame of\nreference for the description of motion, then we may wonder whether\nany arbitrary object can be used for the definition of motions: are\nall such motions on a par, none privileged over any other? It is\nunclear whether anyone has really, consistently espoused this view:\nAristotle, perhaps, in the Metaphysics; Descartes and Leibniz\nare often thought to have but, as we'll see, those claims are suspect;\npossibly Huygens, though his remarks remain cryptic; Mach at some\nmoments perhaps. If this view were correct, then the question of\nwhether the Earth or heavens rotate would be ill-formed, those alternatives being merely\ndifferent but equivalent expressions of the facts. \n\nBut suppose, like Aristotle, you take ordinary language accurately to\nreflect the structure of the world. Then you could recognize\nsystematic everyday uses of ‘up’ and ‘down’\nthat require some privileged standards — uses that treat things\ncloser to a point at the center of the Earth as more\n‘down’ and motions towards that point as\n‘downwards’. Of course we would likely explain this usage in\nterms of the fact that we and our language evolved in a very\nnoticeable gravitational field directed towards the center of the\nEarth, but for Aristotle, as we shall see, this usage helped identify\nan important structural feature of the universe, which itself was\nrequired for the explanation of weight. Now a further question arises:\nhow should a structure, such as a preferred point in the universe,\nwhich privileges certain motions, be understood? What makes that point\nprivileged? One might expect that Aristotle simply identified it with\nthe center of the Earth, and so relative to that particular body; but\nin fact he did not adopt that tacit convention as fundamental, for he\nthought it possible for the Earth to move from the ‘down’\npoint. Thus the question arises (although Aristotle does not address\nit explicitly) of whether the preferred point is somewhere picked out\nin some other way by the bodies in the universe —the center of\nthe heavens perhaps? Or is it picked out quite independently of the\narrangements of matter? \n\nThe issues that arise in this simple theory help frame the debates\nbetween later physicists and philosophers concerning the nature of\nmotion; in particular, we will focus on the theories of Descartes,\nNewton, Leibniz, Mach and Einstein, and their interpretations. But\nsimilar issues circulate through the different contexts: is there any\nkind of privileged sense of motion, a sense in which things can be\nsaid to move or not, not just relative to this or that reference body,\nbut ‘truly’? If so, can this true motion be analyzed in\nterms of motions relative to other bodies — to some special\nbody, or to the entire universe perhaps? (And in relativity, in which\ndistances, times and measures of relative motion are frame-dependent,\nwhat relations are relevant?) If not, then how is the privileged kind\nof motion to be understood, as relative to space itself —\nsomething physical but non-material — perhaps? Or can some kinds\nof motion be best understood as not being spatial changes —\nchanges of relative location or of place — at all? \n\nTo see that the problem of the interpretation of spatiotemporal\nquantities as absolute or relative is endemic to almost any kind of\nmechanics one can imagine, we can look to one of the simplest theories\n— Aristotle's account of natural motion (e.g., On the\nHeavens I.2). According to this theory it is because of their\nnatures, and not because of ‘unnatural’ forces, that that\nheavy bodies move down, and ‘light’ things (air and fire)\nmove up; it is their natures, or ‘forms’, that constitute\nthe gravity or weight of the former and the levity of the latter. This\naccount only makes sense if ‘up’ and ‘down’\ncan be unequivocally determined for each body.  According to\nAristotle, up and down are fixed by the position of the body in\nquestion relative to the center of the universe, a point coincident\nwith the center of the Earth. That is, the theory holds that heavy\nbodies naturally move towards the center, while light bodies naturally\nmove away. \n\nDoes this theory involve absolute or merely relative quantities? It\ndepends on the nature of the center. If the center were identified\nwith the center of the Earth, then the theory could be taken to eschew\nabsolute quantities: it would simply hold that the natural motions of\nany body depend on its position relative to another, namely the Earth.\nBut Aristotle is explicit that the center of the universe is not\nidentical with, but merely coincident with the center of the Earth\n(e.g., On the Heavens II.14): since the Earth itself is\nheavy, if it were not at the center it would move there! So the center\nis not identified with any body, and so perhaps direction-to-center is\nan absolute quantity in the theory, not understood fundamentally as\ndirection to some body (merely contingently as such if some body\nhappens to occupy the center). But this conclusion is not clear\neither.  In On the Heavens II.13, admittedly in response to a\ndifferent issue, Aristotle suggests that the center itself is\n‘determined’ by the outer spherical shell of the universe\n(the aetherial region of the fixed stars). If this is what he intends,\nthen the natural law prescribes motion relative to another body after\nall — namely up or down with respect to the mathematical center\nof the stars. \n\nIt would be to push Aristotle's writings too hard to suggest that he\nwas consciously wrestling with the issue of whether mechanics required\nabsolute or relative quantities of motion, but what is clear is that\nthese questions arise in his physics and his remarks impinge on them.\nHis theory also gives a simple model of how they arise: a\nphysical theory of motion will say that ‘under such-and-such\ncircumstances, motion of so-and-so a kind will occur’ —\nand the question of whether that kind of motion makes sense in terms\nof the relations between bodies alone arises automatically. Aristotle\nmay not have recognized the question explicitly, but we see it as one\nissue in the background of his discussion of the center. \n\nThe issues are, however, far more explicit in the entry on\n Descartes' physics;\n and since the form of his theory is different the ‘kinds of\nmotion’ in question are quite different — as they change\nwith all the different theories that we discuss. For Descartes argued\nin his 1644 Principles of Philosophy (see Book II) that the\nessence of matter was extension (i.e., size and shape) because any\nother attribute of bodies could be imagined away without imagining\naway matter itself. But he also held that extension constitutes the\nnature of space, hence he concluded that space and matter were one and\nthe same thing. An immediate consequence of the identification is the\nimpossibility of the vacuum; if every region of space is a region of\nmatter, then there can be no space without matter. Thus Descartes'\nuniverse is ‘hydrodynamical’ — completely full of\nmobile matter of different sized pieces in motion, rather like a\nbucket full of water and lumps of ice of different sizes, which has\nbeen stirred around. Since fundamentally the pieces of matter are\nnothing but extension, the universe is in fact nothing but a system of\ngeometric bodies in motion without any \n gaps.[1] \n\nThe identification of space and matter poses a puzzle about motion: if\nthe space that a body occupies literally is the matter of the body,\nthen when the body — i.e., the matter — moves, so does the\nspace that it occupies. Thus it doesn't change place, which is to say\nthat it doesn't move after all! Descartes resolved this difficulty by\ntaking all motion to be the motion of bodies relative to one another,\nnot a literal change of space. \n\nNow, a body has as many relative motions as there are bodies but it\ndoes not follow that all are equally significant. Indeed, Descartes\nuses several different concepts of relational motion. First there is\n‘change of place’, which is nothing but motion relative to\nthis or that arbitrary reference body (II.13). In this sense no motion\nof a body is privileged, since the speed, direction, and even curve of\na trajectory depends on the reference body, and none is singled out.\nNext, he discusses motion in ‘the ordinary sense’\n(II.24). This is often conflated with mere change of arbitrary place,\nbut strictly it differs because according to the rules of ordinary\nspeech one correctly attributes motion only to bodies whose motion is\ncaused by some action, not to arbitrary relative motion. (For\ninstance, a person sitting on a speeding boat is ordinarily said to be\nat rest, since ‘he feels no action in himself’.) This\ndistinction is important in some passages, but arguably not in those\nthat we discuss. Finally, he defined motion ‘properly\nspeaking’ (II.25) to be a body's motion relative to the matter\ncontiguously surrounding it, which the impossibility of a vacuum\nguarantees to exist. (Descartes' definition is complicated by the fact\nthat he modifies this technical concept to make it conform more\nclosely to the pre-theoretical sense of ‘motion’; however,\nin our discussion transference is all that matters, so we will ignore\nthose complications.) Since a body can only be touching one set of\nsurroundings, Descartes (dubiously) argued that this standard of\nmotion was unique. \n\nWhat we see here is that Descartes, despite holding motion to be the\nmotion of bodies relative to one another, also held there to be a\nprivileged sense of motion; in a terminology sometimes employed by\nwriters of the period, he held there to be a sense of ‘true\nmotion’, over and above the merely relative\nmotions. Equivalently, we can say that Descartes took motion\n(‘properly speaking’) to be a complete predicate: that is,\nmoves-properly-speaking is a one-place predicate. (In\ncontrast, moves-relative-to is a two-place predicate.) And\nnote that the predicate is complete despite the fact that it is\nanalyzed in terms of relative motion. (Formally, let\ncontiguous-surroundings be a function from bodies to their\ncontiguous surroundings, then x\nmoves-properly-speaking is analyzed as x\nmoves-relative-to contiguous-surroundings(x).) \n\nThis example illustrates why it is crucial to keep two questions\ndistinct: on the one hand, is motion to be understood in terms of\nrelations between bodies or by invoking something additional,\nsomething absolute; on the other hand, are all relative motions\nequally significant, or is there some ‘true’, privileged\nnotion of motion?  Descartes' views show that eschewing absolute\nmotion is logically compatible with accepting true motion; which is of\ncourse not to say that his definitions of motion are themselves\ntenable. \n\nThere is an interpretational tradition which holds that Descartes only\ntook the first, ‘ordinary’ sense of motion seriously, and\nintroduced the second notion to avoid conflict with the Catholic\nChurch. Such conflict was a real concern, since the censure of\nGalileo's Copernicanism took place only 11 years before publication of\nthe Principles, and had in fact dissuaded Descartes from\npublishing an earlier work, The World. Indeed, in the\nPrinciples (III.28) he is at pains to explain how\n‘properly speaking’ the Earth does not move, because it is\nswept around the Sun in a giant vortex of matter — the Earth\ndoes not move relative to its surroundings in the vortex. \n\nThe difficulty with the reading, aside from the imputation of\ncowardice to the old soldier, is that it makes nonsense of Descartes'\nmechanics, a theory of collisions. For instance, according to his laws\nof collision if two equal bodies strike each other at equal and\nopposite velocities then they will bounce off at equal and opposite\nvelocities (Rule I). On the other hand, if the very same bodies\napproach each other with the very same relative speed, but at\ndifferent speeds then they will move off together in the direction of\nthe faster one (Rule III). But if the operative meaning of motion in\nthe Rules is the ordinary sense, then these two situations are just\nthe same situation, differing only in the choice of reference frame,\nand so could not have different outcomes — bouncing apart\nversus moving off together. It seems inconceivable that\nDescartes could have been confused in such a trivial way.\n(Additionally, as Pooley 2002 points out, just after he claims that\nthe Earth is at rest ‘properly speaking’, Descartes argues\nthat the Earth is stationary in the ordinary sense, because common\npractice is to determine the positions of the stars relative to the\nEarth. Descartes simply didn't need motion properly speaking to avoid\nreligious conflict, which again suggests that it has some other\nsignificance in his system of thought.) \n\nThus Garber (1992, Chapter 6–8) proposes that Descartes actually took\nthe unequivocal notion of motion properly speaking to be the correct\nsense of motion in mechanics. Then Rule I covers the case in which the\ntwo bodies have equal and opposite motions relative to their\ncontiguous surroundings, while Rule VI covers the case in which\nthe bodies have different motions relative to those\nsurroundings — one is perhaps at rest in its surroundings.\nThat is, exactly what is needed to make the rules consistent is the\nkind of privileged, true, sense of motion provided by Descartes'\nsecond definition. Insurmountable problems with the rules remain, but\nrejecting the traditional interpretation and taking motion properly\nspeaking seriously in Descartes' philosophy clearly gives a more\ncharitable reading. \n\nIn an unpublished essay — De Gravitatione (Newton,\n2004) — and in a Scholium to the definitions given in\nhis 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (see\nNewton, 1999 for an up-to-date translation), Newton attacked both of\nDescartes' notions of motion as candidates for the operative notion in\nmechanics. (See Stein 1967 and Rynasiewicz 1995 for important, and\ndiffering, views on the issue; for lessons to be drawn from both see\nHuggett 2012. Newton's critique is studied in more detail in the entry\n Newton's views on space, time, and motion.) \n\nThe most famous argument invokes the so-called ‘Newton's\nbucket’ experiment. Stripped to its basic elements one\ncompares: \n \nAs is familiar from any rotating system, there will be a tendency for\nthe water to recede from the axis of rotation in the latter case: in\n(i) the surface of the water will be flat (because of the Earth's\ngravitational field) while in (ii) it will be concave. The analysis of\nsuch ‘inertial effects’ due to rotation was a major topic of\nenquiry of ‘natural philosophers’ of the time, including\nDescartes and his followers, and they would certainly have agreed with\nNewton that the concave surface of the water in the second case\ndemonstrated that the water was moving in a mechanically significant\nsense. There is thus an immediate problem for the claim that proper\nmotion is the correct mechanical sense of motion: in (i) and (ii)\nproper motion is anti-correlated with the mechanically\nsignificant motion revealed by the surface of the water. That is, the\nwater is flat in (i) when it is in motion relative to its immediate\nsurroundings — the inner sides of the bucket — but curved\nin (ii) when it is at rest relative to its immediate\nsurroundings. Thus the mechanically relevant meaning of rotation is\nnot that of proper motion. (You may have noticed a small lacuna in\nNewton's argument: in (i) the water is at rest and in (ii) in motion\nrelative to that part of its surroundings constituted by the air above\nit. It's not hard to imagine small modifications to the example to\nfill this gap.) \n\nNewton also points out that the height that the water climbs up the\ninside of the bucket provides a measure of the rate of rotation of\nbucket and water: the higher the water rises up the sides, the greater\nthe tendency to recede must be, and so the faster the water must be\nrotating in the mechanically significant sense. But suppose, very\nplausibly, that the measure is unique, that any particular height\nindicates a particular rate of rotation. Then the unique height that\nthe water reaches at any moment implies a unique rate of rotation in a\nmechanically significant sense. And thus motion in the sense of motion\nrelative to an arbitrary reference body, is not the mechanical sense,\nsince that kind of rotation is not unique at all, but depends on the\nmotion of the reference body. And so Descartes' change of place\n(and for similar reasons, motion in the ordinary sense) is not the\nmechanically significant sense of motion. \n\nIn our discussion of Descartes we called the sense of motion operative\nin the science of mechanics ‘true motion’, and the phrase\nis used in this way by Newton in the Scholium. Thus Newton's\nbucket shows that true (rotational) motion is anti-correlated with,\nand so not identical with, proper motion (as Descartes proposed\naccording to the Garber reading); and Newton further argues that the\nrate of true (rotational) motion is unique, and so not identical with\nchange of place, which is multiple. Newton proposed instead that true\nmotion is motion relative to a temporally enduring, rigid,\n3-dimensional Euclidean space, which he dubbed ‘absolute\nspace’. Of course, Descartes also defined motion as relative to\nan enduring 3-dimensional Euclidean space; the difference is that\nDescartes space was divided into parts (his space was identical with a\nplenum of corpuscles) in motion, not a rigid structure in\nwhich (mobile) material bodies are embedded. So according to Newton,\nthe rate of true rotation of the bucket (and water) is the rate at\nwhich it rotates relative to absolute space. Or put another way,\nNewton effectively defines the complete predicate x\nmoves-absolutely as x moves-relative-to absolute space;\nboth Newton and Descartes offer competing complete predicates as\nanalyses of x moves-truly. \n\nNewton's proposal for understanding motion solves the problems that he\nposed for Descartes, and provides an interpretation of the concepts of\nconstant motion and acceleration that appear in his laws of motion.\nHowever, it suffers from two notable interpretational problems, both\nof which were pressed forcefully by Leibniz (in the Leibniz-Clarke\nCorrespondence, 1715–1716) — which is not to say that\nLeibniz himself offered a superior account of motion (see below). (Of\ncourse, there are other features of Newton's proposal that turned out\nto be empirically inadequate, and are rejected by in relativity theory: Newton's\naccount violates the relativity of simultaneity and postulates a\nnon-dynamical spacetime structure.) First, according to this account,\nabsolute velocity is a well-defined quantity: more simply, the\nabsolute speed of a body is the rate of change of its position\nrelative to an arbitrary point of absolute space. But the Galilean\nrelativity of Newton's laws (see the entry on\n space and time: inertial frames)\n means that the evolution of a closed\nsystem is unaffected by constant changes in velocity; Galileo's\nexperimenter cannot determine from observations inside his cabin\nwhether the boat is at rest in harbor or sailing smoothly. Put another\nway, according to Newtonian mechanics, in principle Newton's absolute\nvelocity cannot be experimentally determined. So in this regard\nabsolute velocity is quite unlike acceleration (including rotation). \nNewtonian acceleration is understood in absolute space as the rate of\nchange of absolute velocity, and is, according to Newtonian mechanics,\nin general measurable; for instance by measuring the height that the\nwater ascends the sides of the bucket. (It is worth noting that Newton\nwas well-aware of these facts; the Galilean relativity of his theory\nis demonstrated in Corollary V of the laws of the Principia,\nwhile Corollary VI shows that acceleration is unobservable if all\nparts of the system accelerate in parallel at the same rate, as they\ndo in a homogeneous gravitational field.) Leibniz argued (rather\ninconsistently, as we shall see) that since differences in absolute\nvelocity are unobservable, they are not be genuine differences at all;\nand hence that Newton's absolute space, whose existence would entail\nthe reality of such differences, must also be a fiction. Few\nphilosophers today would immediately reject a quantity as\nunreal simply because it was not experimentally determinable, but this\nfact does justify genuine doubts about the reality of absolute\nvelocity, and hence of absolute space. \n\nThe second problem concerns the nature of absolute space. Newton quite\nclearly distinguished his account from Descartes' — in\nparticular with regards to absolute space's rigidity versus Descartes'\n‘hydrodynamical’ space, and the possibility of the vacuum\nin absolute space. Thus absolute space is definitely not material. On\nthe other hand, presumably it is supposed to be part of the physical,\nnot mental, realm. In De Gravitatione, Newton rejected both\nthe traditional philosophical categories of substance and attribute as\nsuitable characterizations. Absolute space is not a substance for it\nlacks causal powers and does not have a fully independent existence,\nand yet it is not an attribute since it would exist even in a vacuum, which\nby definition is a place where there are no bodies in which it might\ninhere. Newton proposes that space is what we might call a\n‘pseudo-substance’, more like a substance than property,\nyet not quite a substance. (Note that Samuel Clarke, in his\nCorrespondence with Leibniz, which Newton had some role in\ncomposing, advocates the property view, and note further that when\nLeibniz objects because of the vacuum problem, Clarke suggests that\nthere might be non-material beings in the vacuum in which space might\ninhere.) In fact, Newton accepted the principle that everything that\nexists, exists somewhere — i.e., in absolute space. Thus he\nviewed absolute space as a necessary consequence of the existence of\nanything, and of God's existence in particular — hence space's\nontological dependence.  Leibniz was presumably unaware of the\nunpublished De Gravitatione in which these particular ideas\nwere developed, but as we shall see, his later works are characterized\nby a robust rejection of any notion of space as a real thing rather\nthan an ideal, purely mental entity. This is a view that attracts even\nfewer contemporary adherents, but there is something deeply peculiar\nabout a non-material but physical entity, a worry that has influenced\nmany philosophical opponents of absolute space. \n\nAfter the development of relativity (which we will take up below), and\nits interpretation as a spacetime theory, it was realized\nthat the notion of spacetime had applicability to a range of theories\nof mechanics, classical as well as relativistic. In particular, there\nis a spacetime geometry — ‘Galilean’ or\n‘neo-Newtonian’ spacetime — for Newtonian mechanics\nthat solves the problem of absolute velocity; an idea exploited by a\nnumber of philosophers from the late 1960s (e.g., Earman 1970,\nFriedman 1983, Sklar 1974 and Stein 1968).  For details the reader is\nreferred to the entry on\n spacetime: inertial frames,\n but the general idea is that although a spatial distance is\nwell-defined between any two simultaneous points of this spacetime,\nonly the temporal interval is well-defined between non-simultaneous\npoints. Thus things are rather unlike Newton's absolute space, whose\npoints persist through time and maintain their distances: in absolute\nspace the distance between p-now and q-then (where\np and q are points) is just the distance between\np-now and q-now. However, Galilean spacetime has an\n‘affine connection’ which effectively specifies for every\npoint of every continuous curve, the rate at which the curve is\nchanging from straightness at that point; for instance, the straight\nlines are picked out as those curves whose rate of change from\nstraightness is zero at every point. (Another way of thinking about\nthis space is as possessing — in addition to a distance between\nany two simultaneous points and a temporal interval between any points\n— a three-place relation of colinearity, satisfied by three\npoints just in case they lie on a straight line.) \n\nSince the trajectories of bodies are curves in spacetime, the affine\nconnection determines the rate of change from straightness at every\npoint of every possible trajectory. The straight trajectories thus\ndefined can be interpreted as the trajectories of bodies moving\ninertially (i.e., without forces), and the rate of change from\nstraightness of any trajectory can be interpreted as the acceleration\nof a body following that trajectory. That is, Newton's First Law can\nbe given a geometric formulation as ‘bodies on which no net\nforces act follow straight lines in spacetime’; similarly, the Second\nLaw can be formulated as ‘the rate of change from straightness\nof a body's trajectory is equal to the forces acting on the body\ndivided by its mass’. The significance of this geometry is that\nwhile acceleration is well-defined, velocity is not — in accord\nwith the empirical determinability of acceleration but not of\nvelocity, according to Newtonian mechanics. (A simple analogy helps\nsee how such a thing is possible: betweenness on a curve, but not\n‘up’ is a well-defined concept in Euclidean space.)  Thus\nGalilean spacetime gives a very nice interpretation of the choice that\nnature makes when it decides that the laws of mechanics should be\nformulated in terms of accelerations not velocities. \n\nPut another way, we can define the complete predicate x\naccelerates as trajectory(x)\nhas-non-zero-rate-of-change-from-straightness, where\ntrajectory maps bodies onto their trajectories in Galilean\nspacetime. And this predicate, defined this way, applies to the water\nin the bucket if and only if it is rotating, according to Newtonian\nmechanics formulated in terms of the geometry of Galilean spacetime;\nit is the mechanically relevant sense of the word in this theory. But\nthis theoretical formulation and definition have been given in terms of the\ngeometry of spacetime, not in terms of the relations between bodies; acceleration is\n‘absolute’ in the sense that there is a preferred (true)\nsense of acceleration in mechanics and which is not defined in terms\nof the motions of bodies relative to one another. (Note that this\nsense of ‘absolute’ is broader than that of motion\nrelative to absolute space, which we defined earlier. In the remainder\nof this article we will use it in the broader sense. The reader should\nbe aware that the term is used in many ways in the literature, and\nsuch equivocation often leads to significant misunderstandings.) Thus if\nany of this analysis of motion is taken literally then one arrives at\na position regarding the ontology of spacetime rather like that of\nNewton's regarding space: it is some kind of ‘substantial’\n(or maybe pseudo-substantial) thing with the geometry of\nGalilean spacetime, just as absolute space possessed Euclidean\ngeometry. This view regarding the ontology of spacetime is usually\ncalled ‘substantivalism’ (Sklar, 1974). The Galilean\nsubstantivalist usually sees himself as adopting a more sophisticated\ngeometry than Newton but sharing his substantivalism (though there is\nroom for debate on Newton's exact ontological views; see DiSalle,\n2002). The advantage of the more sophisticated geometry is that\nalthough it allows the absolute sense of acceleration apparently\nrequired by Newtonian mechanics to be defined, it does not allow one\nto define a similar absolute speed or velocity — x\naccelerates can be defined as a complete predicate in terms of the\ngeometry of Galilean spacetime but not x moves in general\n— and so the first of Leibniz's problems is resolved. Of course\nwe see that the solution depends on a crucial shift from speed and\nvelocity to acceleration as the relevant senses of\n‘motion’: from the rate of change of position to the rate\nof rate of change. \n\nWhile this proposal solves the first kind of problem posed by Leibniz,\nit seems just as vulnerable to the second. While it is true that it\ninvolves the rejection of absolute space as Newton conceived it, and\nwith it the need to explicate the nature of an enduring space, the\npostulation of Galilean spacetime poses the parallel question of the\nnature of spacetime. Again, it is a physical but non-material\nsomething, the points of which may be coincident with material bodies.\nWhat kind of thing is it? Could we do without it? As we shall see\nbelow, some contemporary philosophers believe so. \n\nThere is a ‘folk-reading’ of Leibniz that one finds either\nexplicitly or implicitly in the philosophy of physics literature which\ntakes account of only some of his remarks on space and motion. The\nreading underlies vast swathes of the literature: for instance, the\nquantities captured by Earman's (1999) ‘Leibnizian\nspacetime’ do not do justice to Leibniz's view of motion (as\nEarman acknowledges). But it is perhaps most obvious in introductory\ntexts (e.g., Ray 1991, Huggett 2000 to mention a couple). According to\nthis view, the only quantities of motion are relative quantities,\nrelative velocity, acceleration and so on, and all relative motions\nare equal, so there is no true sense of motion. However, Leibniz is\nexplicit that other quantities are also ‘real’, and his\nmechanics implicitly — but obviously — depends on yet\nothers. The length of this section is a measure, not so much of the\nimportance of Leibniz's actual views, but the importance of showing\nwhat the prevalent folk view leaves out regarding Leibniz's views on\nthe metaphysics of motion and interpretation of mechanics. (For\nfurther elaboration of the following points the reader is referred\nto the entry on\n Leibniz's philosophy of physics) \n\nThat said, we shall also see that no one has yet discovered a fully\nsatisfactory way of reconciling the numerous conflicting things that\nLeibniz says about motion. Some of these tensions can be put down\nsimply to his changing his mind (see Cover and Hartz 1988 for an\nexplication of how Leibniz's views on space developed). However, we\nwill concentrate on the fairly short period in the mid 1680–90s during\nwhich Leibniz developed his theory of mechanics, and was most\nconcerned with its interpretation. We will supplement this\ndiscussion with the important remarks that he made in his\nCorrespondence with Samuel Clarke\naround 30 years later\n(1715–1716); this discussion is broadly in line with the earlier\nperiod, and the intervening period is one in which he turned to other\nmatters, rather than one in which his views on space were dramatically\nevolving. \n\nArguably, Leibniz's views concerning space and motion do not have a\ncompletely linear logic, starting from some logically sufficient basic\npremises, but instead form a collection of mutually supporting\ndoctrines. If one starts questioning why Leibniz held certain views\n— concerning the ideality of space, for instance — one is\napt to be led in a circle. Still, exposition requires starting\nsomewhere, and Leibniz's argument for the ideality of space in the\nCorrespondence with Clarke is a good place to begin. But bear\nin mind the caveats made here — this argument was made later\nthan a number of other relevant writings, and its logical relation to\nLeibniz's views on motion is complex. \n\nLeibniz (LV.47 — this notation means Leibniz's Fifth letter,\nsection 47, and so on) says that (i) a body comes to have the\n‘same place’ as another once did, when it comes to stand\nin the same relations to bodies we ‘suppose’ to be\nunchanged (more on this later).  (ii) That we can define ‘a\nplace’ to be that which any such two bodies have in common (here\nhe claims an analogy with the Euclidean/Eudoxan definition of a\nrational number in terms of an identity relation between ratios). And\nfinally that (iii) space is all such places taken together. However,\nhe also holds that properties are particular, incapable of\nbeing instantiated by more than one individual, even at different\ntimes; hence it is impossible for the two bodies to be in\nliterally the same relations to the unchanged bodies. Thus the thing\nthat we take to be the same for the two bodies — the place\n— is something added by our minds to the situation, and only\nideal. As a result, space, which is constructed from these\nideal places, is itself ideal: ‘a certain order, wherein the\nmind conceives the application of relations’. \n\nIt's worth pausing briefly to contrast this view of space with those\nof Descartes and of Newton. Both Descartes and Newton claim that space\nis a real, mind-independent entity; for Descartes it is matter, and\nfor Newton a ‘pseudo-substance’, distinct from matter. And\nof course for both, these views are intimately tied up with their\naccounts of motion.  Leibniz simply denies the mind-independent\nreality of space, and this too is bound up with his views concerning\nmotion. (Note that fundamentally, in the metaphysics of monads that\nLeibniz was developing contemporaneously with his mechanics,\neverything is in the mind of the monads; but the point that\nLeibniz is making here is that even within the world that is logically\nconstructed from the contents of the minds of monads, space is\nideal.) \n\nSo far (apart from that remark about ‘unchanged’ bodies)\nwe have not seen Leibniz introduce anything more than relations of\ndistance between bodies, which is certainly consistent with the folk\nview of his philosophy. However, Leibniz sought to provide a\nfoundation for the Cartesian/mechanical philosophy in terms of the\nAristotelian/scholastic metaphysics of substantial forms (here we\ndiscuss the views laid out in Sections 17–22 of the 1686 Discourse\non Metaphysics and the 1695 Specimen of Dynamics, both\nin Garber and Ariew 1989). In particular, he identifies primary matter\nwith what he calls its ‘primitive passive force’ of\nresistance to changes in motion and to penetration, and the\nsubstantial form of a body with its ‘primitive active\nforce’. It is important to realize that these forces are not\nmere properties of matter, but actually constitute it in some sense,\nand further that they are not themselves quantifiable. However because\nof the collisions of bodies with one another, these forces\n‘suffer limitation’, and ‘derivative’ passive\nand active forces result.  (There's a real puzzle here. Collision\npresupposes space, but primitive forces constitute matter\nprior to any spatial concepts — the primitive active\nand passive forces ground motion and extension respectively. See\nGarber and Rauzy, 2004.) Derivative passive force shows up in the\ndifferent degrees of resistance to change of different kinds of matter\n(of ‘secondary matter’ in scholastic terms), and\napparently is measurable. Derivative active force however, is\nconsiderably more problematic for Leibniz. On the one hand, it is\nfundamental to his account of motion and theory of mechanics —\nmotion fundamentally is possession of force. But on the other\nhand, Leibniz endorses the mechanical philosophy, which precisely\nsought to abolish Aristotelian substantial form, which active force\nrepresents. Leibniz's goal was to reconcile the two philosophies, by\nproviding an Aristotelian metaphysical foundation for modern\nmechanical science; as we shall see, it is ultimately an open question\nexactly how Leibniz intended to deal with the inherent tensions in\nsuch a view. \n\nThe texts are sufficiently ambiguous to permit dissent, but arguably\nLeibniz intends that one manifestation of derivative active force is\nwhat he calls vis viva — ‘living\nforce’. Leibniz had a famous argument with the Cartesians over\nthe correct definition of this quantity. Descartes defined it as\nsize times speed — effectively as the\nmagnitude of the momentum of a body. Leibniz gave a brilliant argument\n(repeated in a number of places, for instance Section 17 of the\nDiscourse on Metaphysics) that it was size times\nspeed2 — so (proportional to) kinetic\nenergy. If the proposed identification is correct then kinetic energy\nquantifies derivative active force according to Leibniz; or looked at\nthe other way, the quantity of virtus (another term used by\nLeibniz for active force) associated with a body determines its\nkinetic energy and hence its speed. As far as the authors know,\nLeibniz never explicitly says anything conclusive about the relativity\nof virtus, but it is certainly consistent to read him (as\nRoberts 2003 does) to claim that there is a unique quantity of\nvirtus and hence ‘true’ (as we have been using\nthe term) speed associated with each body. At the very least, Leibniz\ndoes say that there is a real difference between possession and\nnon-possession of vis viva (e.g., in Section 18 of the\nDiscourse) and it is a small step from there to true, privileged\nspeed.  Indeed, for Leibniz, mere change of relative position is not\n‘entirely real’ (as we saw for instance in the\nCorrespondence) and only when it has vis viva as its\nimmediate cause is there some reality to it. (However, just to muddy\nthe waters, Leibniz also claims that as a matter of fact, no body ever\nhas zero force, which on the reading proposed means no body is ever at\nrest, which would be surprising given all the collisions bodies\nundergo.) An alternative interpretation to the one suggested here\nmight say that Leibniz intends that while there is a difference\nbetween motion/virtus and no motion/virtus, there is\nsomehow no difference between any strictly positive values of those\nquantities. \n\nIt is important to emphasize two points about the preceding account of\nmotion in Leibniz's philosophy. First, motion in the everyday sense\n— motion relative to something else — is not\nreally real. Fundamentally motion is possession of virtus,\nsomething that is ultimately non-spatial (modulo its interpretation as\nprimitive force limited by collision). If this reading is right\n— and something along these lines seems necessary if we aren't\nsimply to ignore important statements by Leibniz on motion —\nthen Leibniz is offering an interpretation of motion that is radically\ndifferent from the obvious understanding. One might even say that for\nLeibniz motion is not movement at all! (We will leave to one side the\nquestion of whether his account is ultimately coherent.) The second\npoint is that however we should understand Leibniz, the folk reading\nsimply does not and cannot take account of his clearly and repeatedly\nstated view that what is real in motion is force not relative\nmotion, for the folk reading allows Leibniz only relative\nmotion (and of course additionally, motion in the sense of force is a\nvariety of true motion, again contrary to the folk reading). \n\nHowever, from what has been said so far it is still possible that the\nfolk reading is accurate when it comes to Leibniz's views on the\nphenomena of motion, the subject of his theory of mechanics. The case\nfor the folk reading is in fact supported by Leibniz's\nresolution of the tension that we mentioned earlier, between the\nfundamental role of force/virtus (which we will now take to\nmean mass times speed2) and its\nassociation with Aristotelian form. Leibniz's way out (e.g.,\nSpecimen of Dynamics) is to require that while considerations\nof force must somehow determine the form of the laws of motion, the\nlaws themselves should be such as not to allow one to determine the\nvalue of the force (and hence true speed). One might conclude that in\nthis case Leibniz held that the only quantities which can be\ndetermined are those of relative position and motion, as the folk\nreading says.  But even in this circumscribed context, it is at best\nquestionable whether the interpretation is correct. \n\nConsider first Leibniz's mechanics. Since his laws are what is now\n(ironically) often called ‘Newtonian’ elastic collision\ntheory, it seems that they satisfy both of his requirements. The laws\ninclude conservation of kinetic energy (which we identify with\nvirtus), but they hold in all inertial frames, so the kinetic\nenergy of any arbitrary body can be set to any initial value. But they\ndo not permit the kinetic energy of a body to take on any values\nthroughout a process. The laws are only Galilean relativistic, and so\nare not true in every frame. Furthermore, according to the laws of\ncollision, in an inertial frame, if a body does not collide then its\nLeibnizian force is conserved while if (except in special cases) it\ndoes collide then its force changes. According to Leibniz's laws one\ncannot determine initial kinetic energies, but one certainly can tell\nwhen they change. At very least, there are quantities of motion\nimplicit in Leibniz's mechanics — change in force and true\nspeed — that are not merely relative; the folk reading is\ncommitted to Leibniz simply missing this obvious fact. \n\nThat said, when Leibniz discusses the relativity of motion —\nwhich he calls the ‘equivalence of hypotheses’ about the\nstates of motion of bodies — some of his statements do suggest\nthat he was confused in this way. For another way of stating the\nproblem for the folk reading is that the claim that relative motions\nalone suffice for mechanics and that all relative motions are on a par is\na principle of general relativity, and could Leibniz — a\nmathematical genius — really have failed to notice that his laws\nhold only in special frames? Well, just maybe. On the one hand, when\nhe explicitly articulates the principle of the equivalence of\nhypotheses (for instance in Specimen of Dynamics) he tends to\nsay only that one cannot assign initial velocities on the\nbasis of the outcome of a collision, which requires only Galilean\nrelativity.  However, he confusingly also claimed (On\nCopernicanism and the Relativity of Motion, also in Garber and\nAriew 1989) that the Tychonic and Copernican hypotheses were\nequivalent. But if the Earth orbits the Sun in an inertial frame\n(Copernicus), then there is no inertial frame according to which the\nSun orbits the Earth (Tycho Brahe), and vice versa: these hypotheses\nare simply not Galilean equivalent (something else Leibniz could\nhardly have failed to notice).  So there is some textual support for\nLeibniz endorsing general relativity for the phenomena, as the folk reading maintains. \n\nA number of commentators have suggested solutions to the puzzle of the\nconflicting pronouncements that Leibniz makes on the subject: Stein\n1977 argues for general relativity, thereby imputing a\nmisunderstanding of his own laws to Leibniz; Roberts 2003 argues for\nGalilean relativity, thereby discounting Leibniz's apparent statements\nto the contrary; see also Lodge 2003. Jauernig 2004 and 2008 points\nout that in the Specimen, Leibniz claims that all motions are\ncomposed of uniform rectilinear motions: an apparently curvilinear\nmotion is actually a series of uniform motions, punctuated by\ndiscontinuous collisions. This observation allows one to restrict the\nscope of claims of the kind ‘no motions can be attributed on the\nbasis of phenomena’ to inertial motions, and so helps read\nLeibniz as more consistently advocating Galilean relativity, the\nreading Jauernig favors (see also Huggett's 2006 ‘Can Spacetime\nHelp Settle Any Issues in Modern Philosophy?’, in the Other\nInternet Resources, which was inspired by Jauernig's work). Note that\neven in a pure collision dynamics the phenomena distinguish a body in\nuniform rectilinear motion over time, from one that undergoes\ncollisions changing its uniform rectilinear motion over time: the laws\nwill hold in the frame of the former, but not in the frame of the\nlatter. That is, apparently contrary to what Jauernig says, Leibniz's\naccount of curvilinear motion does not collapse Galilean relativity\ninto general relativity. In that case, Leibniz's specific claims of\nthe phenomenal equivalence of Copernican and Tychonic hypotheses still\nneed to be accommodated. \n\nSo the folk reading simply ignores Leibniz's metaphysics of motion, it\ncommits Leibniz to a mathematical howler regarding his laws, and it is\narguable whether it is the best rendering of his pronouncements\nconcerning relativity; it certainly cannot be accepted\nunquestioningly. However, it is not hard to understand the temptation\nof the folk reading. In his Correspondence with Clarke,\nLeibniz says that he believes space to be “something merely\nrelative, as time is, … an order of coexistences, as time is an\norder of successions” (LIII.4), which is naturally taken to mean\nthat space is at base nothing but the distance and temporal relations\nbetween bodies.  (Though even this passage has its subtleties, because\nof the ideality of space discussed above, and because in Leibniz's\nconception space determines what sets of relations are\npossible.) And if relative distances and times exhaust the\nspatiotemporal in this way, then shouldn't all quantities of\nmotion be defined in terms of those relations? We have seen two ways\nin which this would be the wrong conclusion to draw. Force\nseems to involve a notion of speed that is not identified with any\nrelative speed. And (unless the equivalence of hypotheses is after all\na principle of general relativity), the laws pick out a standard of\nconstant motion that need not be any constant relative motion. Of\ncourse, it is hard to reconcile these quantities with the view of\nspace and time that Leibniz proposes — what is speed in\nsize times speed2 or constant speed if\nnot speed relative to some body or to absolute space? Given Leibniz's\nview that space is literally ideal (and indeed that even relative\nmotion is not ‘entirely real’) perhaps the best answer is\nthat he took force and hence motion in its real\nsense not to be determined by motion in a relative sense at all, but\nto be primitive monadic quantities. That is, he took x moves\nto be a complete predicate, but he believed that it could be fully\nanalyzed in terms of strictly monadic predicates: x moves iff\nx possesses-non-zero-derivative-active-force. And this\nreading explains just what Leibniz took us to be supposing when we\n‘supposed certain bodies to be unchanged’ in the\nconstruction of the idea of space: that they had no force, nothing\ncausing, or making real any motion. \n\nIt's again helpful to compare Leibniz with Descartes and Newton, this\ntime regarding motion. Commentators often express frustration at\nLeibniz's response to Newton's arguments for absolute space: “I\nfind nothing … in the Scholium that proves or can\nprove the reality of space in itself. However, I grant that there is a\ndifference between an absolute true motion of a body and a mere\nrelative change …” (LV.53). Not only does Leibniz apparently\nfail to take the argument seriously, he then goes on to concede the\nstep in the argument that seems to require absolute space! But with\nour understanding of Newton and Leibniz, we can see that what he says\nmakes perfect sense (or at least that it is not as disingenuous as it\nis often taken to be). Newton argues in the Scholium that\ntrue motion cannot be identified with the kinds of motion that\nDescartes considers; but both of these are purely relative motions,\nand Leibniz is in complete agreement that merely relative motions are\nnot true (i.e., ‘entirely real’). Leibniz's\n‘concession’ merely registers his agreement with Newton\nagainst Descartes on the difference between true and relative motion;\nhe surely understood who and what Newton was refuting, and it was a\nposition that he had himself, in different terms, publicly argued\nagainst at length. But as we have seen, Leibniz had a very different\nanalysis of the difference to Newton's; true motion was not, for him,\na matter of motion relative to absolute space, but the possession of\nquantity of force, ontologically prior to any spatiotemporal\nquantities at all. There is indeed nothing in the Scholium\nexplicitly directed against that view, and since it does potentially\noffer an alternative way of understanding true motion, it is not\nunreasonable for Leibniz to claim that there is no deductive inference\nfrom true motion to absolute space. \n\nThe folk reading which belies Leibniz has it that he sought a theory\nof mechanics formulated in terms only of the relations between bodies.\nAs we'll see presently, in the Nineteenth Century, Ernst Mach indeed\nproposed such an approach, but Leibniz clearly did not; though certain\nsimilarities between Leibniz and Mach — especially the rejection\nof absolute space — surely helps explain the confusion\nbetween the two. But not only is Leibniz often misunderstood, there\nare influential misreadings of Newton's arguments in the\nScholium, influenced by the idea that he is addressing\nLeibniz in some way. Of course the Principia was written 30\nyears before the Correspondence, and the arguments of the\nScholium were not written with Leibniz in mind, but Clarke\nhimself suggests (CIV.13) that those arguments — specifically\nthose concerning the bucket — are telling against Leibniz. That\nargument is indeed devastating to the parity of all relative motions but we have seen\nthat it is highly questionable whether Leibniz's equivalence of\nhypotheses amounts to such a view. That said, his statements in the\nfirst four letters of the Correspondence could understandably\nmislead Clarke on this point — it is in reply to Clarke's\nchallenge that Leibniz explicitly denies the parity of relative\nmotions. But interestingly, Clarke does not present a true version of\nNewton's argument — despite some involvement of Newton in\nwriting the replies. Instead of the argument from the uniqueness of\nthe rate of rotation, he argues that systems with different velocities\nmust be different because the effects observed if they were\nbrought to rest would be different. This argument is of course\nutterly question begging against a view that holds that there is no\nprivileged standard of rest (the view Clarke mistakenly attributes to Leibniz)! \n\nAs we discuss further in Section 8, Mach attributed to Newton the fallacious\nargument that because the surface of the water curved even when it was\nnot in motion relative to the bucket, it must be rotating relative to\nabsolute space. Our discussion of Newton showed how misleading such a\nreading is. In the first place he also argues that there must be some\nprivileged sense of rotation, and hence not all relative motions are\nequal. Second, the argument is ad hominem against Descartes,\nin which context a disjunctive syllogism — motion is either\nproper or ordinary or relative to absolute space — is\nargumentatively legitimate. On the other hand, Mach is quite correct\nthat Newton's argument in the Scholium leaves open the\nlogical possibility that the privileged, true sense of rotation (and\nacceleration more generally) is some species of relative motion; if\nnot motion properly speaking, then relative to the fixed stars\nperhaps. (In fact Newton rejects this possibility in De\nGravitatione (1962) on the grounds that it would involve an\nodious action at a distance; an ironic position given his theory of\nuniversal gravity.) \n\nHowever the kind of folk-reading of Newton that underlies much of the\ncontemporary literature replaces Mach's interpretation with a more\ncharitable one. According to this reading, Newton's point is that his\nmechanics — unlike Descartes' — could explain why\nthe surface of the rotating water is curved, that his explanation\ninvolves a privileged sense of rotation, and that absent an\nalternative hypothesis about its relative nature, we should accept\nabsolute space.  But our discussion of Newton's argument showed that\nit simply does not have an ‘abductive’, ‘best\nexplanation’ form, but shows deductively, from Cartesian\npremises, that rotation is neither proper nor ordinary motion. \n\nThat is not to say that Newton had no understanding of how such\neffects would be explained in his mechanics. For instance, in\nCorollaries 5 and 6 to the Definitions of the Principles he\nstates in general terms the conditions under which different states of\nmotion are not — and so by implication are —\ndiscernible according to his laws of mechanics. Nor is it to say that\nNewton's contemporaries weren't seriously concerned with explaining\ninertial effects. Leibniz, for instance, analyzed a rotating body (in\nthe Specimen). In short, parts of a rotating system collide\nwith the surrounding matter and are continuously deflected, into a\nseries of linear motions that form a curved path. (Though the system\nas Leibniz envisions it — comprised of a plenum of elastic\nparticles of matter — is far too complex for him to offer any\nquantitative model based on this qualitative picture. So he had no\nserious alternative explanation of inertial effects.) \n\nAlthough the argument is then not Newton's, it is still an important\nresponse to the kind of relationism proposed by the folk-Leibniz,\nespecially when it is extended by bringing in a further example from\nNewton's Scholium. Newton considered a pair of identical\nspheres, connected by a cord, too far from any bodies to observe any\nrelative motions; he pointed out that their rate and direction of\nrotation could still be experimentally determined by measuring the\ntension in the cord, and by pushing on opposite faces of the two globes\nto see whether the tension increased or decreased. He intended this\nsimple example to demonstrate that the project he intended in the\nPrincipia, of determining the absolute accelerations and\nhence gravitational forces on the planets from their relative motions,\nwas possible. However, if we further specify that the spheres and cord\nare rigid and that they are the only things in their\nuniverse, then the example can be used to point out that there are\ninfinitely many different rates of rotation all of which agree on the\nrelations between bodies. Since there are no differences in the\nrelations between bodies in the different situations, it follows that\nthe observable differences between the states of rotation\ncannot be explained in terms of the relations between\nbodies. Therefore, a theory of the kind attributed to the folk's\nLeibniz cannot explain all the phenomena of Newtonian mechanics, and\nagain we can argue abductively for absolute space. (Of course, the\nargument works by showing that, granted the different states of\nrotation, there are states of rotation that cannot merely be relative\nrotations of any kind; for the differences cannot be traced to any\nrelational differences. That is, granted the assumptions of the\nargument, rotation is not true relative motion of any kind.) \n\nThis argument (neither the premises nor conclusion) is not Newton's,\nand must not be taken as a historically accurate reading, However,\nthat is not to say that the argument is fallacious, and indeed many\nhave found it attractive, particularly as a defense not of Newton's\nabsolute space, but of Galilean spacetime. That is, Newtonian\nmechanics with Galilean spacetime can explain the phenomena associated\nwith rotation, while theories of the kind proposed by Mach cannot\nexplain the differences between situations allowed by Newtonian\nmechanics, but these explanations rely on the geometric structure of\nGalilean spacetime — particularly its affine connection, to interpret\nacceleration. And thus — the argument goes — those\nexplanations commit us to the reality of spacetime — a manifold\nof points — whose properties include the appropriate geometric\nones. This final doctrine, of the reality of spacetime with its\ncomponent points or regions, distinct from matter, with geometric\nproperties, is what we earlier identified as\n‘substantivalism’. \n\nThere are two points to make about this line of argument. First, the\nrelationist could reply that he need not explain all situations which\nare possible according to Newtonian mechanics, because that theory is\nto be rejected in favor of one which invokes only distance and time\nrelations between bodies, but which approximates to Newton's if matter\nis distributed suitably. Such a relationist would be following Mach's\nproposal, which we will discuss next. Such a position would be\nsatisfactory only to the extent that a suitable concrete replacement\ntheory to Newton's theory is developed; Mach never offered such a\ntheory, but recently more progress has been made. \n\nSecond, one must be careful in understanding just how the argument\nworks, for it is tempting to gloss it by saying that in Newtonian\nmechanics the affine connection is a crucial part of the explanation of the\nsurface of the water in the bucket, and if the spacetime which carries\nthe connection is denied, then the explanation fails too. But this\ngloss tacitly assumes that Newtonian mechanics can only be understood\nin a substantial Galilean spacetime; if an interpretation of Newtonian\nmechanics that does not assume substantivalism can be constructed,\nthen all Newtonian explanations can be given without a literal\nconnection.  Both Sklar (1974) and van Fraassen (1985) have made\nproposals along these lines. Sklar proposes interpreting\n‘true’ acceleration as a primitive quantity not defined in\nterms of motion relative to anything, be it absolute space, a\nconnection or other bodies. (Notice the family resemblance between\nthis proposal and Leibniz's view of force and speed.) Van Fraassen\nproposes formulating mechanics as ‘Newton's Laws hold in\nsome frame’, so that the form of the laws and the\ncontingent relative motions of bodies — not absolute space or a\nconnection, or even any instantaneous relations — pick out a\nstandard of true motion, namely with respect to such an\n‘inertial frame’. These proposals aim to keep the full\nexplanatory resources of Newtonian mechanics, and hence admit\n‘true acceleration’, but deny any relations between bodies\nand spacetime itself. Like the actual Leibniz, they allow absolute\nquantities of motion, but claim that space and time themselves are\nnothing but the relations between bodies. Some may question how the\nlaws can be such as to privilege frames without prior spacetime\ngeometry. Huggett 2006 proposes that the laws be understood as a\nHumean ‘best system’\n(see the entry on\n laws of nature) for a\nworld of bodies and their relations; the laws don't reflect prior\ngeometric structure, but systematic regularities in patterns of\nrelative motions. For obvious reasons, this proposal is called\n‘regularity relationism’. Note that Sklar and van\nFraassen are committed to the idea that in some sense Newton's laws\nare capable of explaining all the phenomena without recourse to\nspacetime geometry; that the connection and the metrical properties\nare explanatorily redundant. This idea is at the core of the\n‘Dynamical Approach’, discussed below. \n\nBetween the time of Newton and Leibniz and the 20th century, Newton's\nmechanics and gravitation theory reigned essentially unchallenged, and\nwith that long period of dominance, absolute space came to be widely\naccepted. At least, no natural philosopher or physicist offered a\nserious challenge to Newton's absolute space, in the sense of offering\na rival theory that dispenses with it. But like the action at a\ndistance in Newtonian gravity, absolute space continued to provoke\nmetaphysical unease. Seeking a replacement for the unobservable\nNewtonian space, Neumann (1870) and Lange (1885) developed more\nconcrete definitions of the reference frames in which Newton's laws\nhold. In these and a few other works, the concept of the set of\ninertial frames was first clearly expressed, though it was implicit in\nboth remarks and procedures to be found in the\nPrincipia. (See the entries on \n space and time: inertial frames\n and\n Newton's views on space, time, and motion)\n The most sustained, comprehensive, and influential attack on absolute\nspace was made by Ernst Mach in his Science of Mechanics\n(1883). \n\nIn a lengthy discussion of Newton's Scholium on absolute\nspace, Mach accuses Newton of violating his own methodological\nprecepts by going well beyond what the observational facts teach us\nconcerning motion and acceleration. Mach at least partly\nmisinterpreted Newton's aims in the Scholium, and inaugurated\na reading of the bucket argument (and by extension the globes\nargument) that has largely persisted in the literature since. Mach\nviewed the argument as directed against a ‘strict’ or\n‘general-relativity’ form of relationism, and as an\nattempt to establish the existence of absolute space. Mach points out\nthe obvious gap in the argument when so construed: the experiment only\nestablishes that acceleration (rotation) of the water with respect\nto the Earth, or the frame of the fixed stars, produces the\ntendency to recede from the center; it does not prove that a strict\nrelationist theory cannot account for the bucket phenomena, much less\nthe existence of absolute space. (The reader will recall that Newton's\nactual aim was simply to show that Descartes' two kinds of motion are\nnot adequate to accounting for rotational phenomena.) Although Mach\ndoes not mention the globes thought experiment specifically, it is\neasy to read an implicit response to it in the things he does say:\nnobody is competent to say what would happen, or what would be\npossible, in a universe devoid of matter other than two globes. So\nneither the bucket nor the globes can establish the existence of\nabsolute space. \n\nBoth in Mach's interpretations of Newton's arguments and in his\nreplies, one can already see two anti-absolute space viewpoints\nemerge, though Mach himself never fully kept them apart. The first\nstrain, which we may call ‘Mach-lite’, criticizes Newton's\npostulation of absolute space as a metaphysical leap that is neither\njustified by actual experiments, nor methodologically sound. The\nremedy offered by Mach-lite is simple: we should retain Newton's\nmechanics and use it just as we already do, but eliminate the\nunnecessary posit of absolute space. In its place we need only\nsubstitute the frame of the fixed stars, as is the practice in\nastronomy in any case. If we find the incorporation of a reference to\ncontingent circumstances (the existence of a single reference frame in\nwhich the stars are more or less stationary) in the fundamental laws\nof nature problematic (which Mach need not, given his official\npositivist account of scientific laws), then Mach suggests that we\nreplace the 1st law with an empirically equivalent mathematical\nrival: \n\nThe sums in this equation are to be taken over all massive bodies in\nthe universe. Since the top sum is weighted by distance, distant\nmasses count much more than near ones. In a world with a (reasonably)\nstatic distribution of heavy distant bodies, such as we appear to live\nin, the equation entails local conservation of linear momentum in\n‘inertial’ frames. The upshot of this equation is that the\nframe of the fixed stars plays the role of absolute space in\nthe statement of the 1st law. (Notice that this equation, unlike\nNewton's first law, is not vectorial.) This proposal does not, by\nitself, offer an alternative to Newtonian mechanics, and as Mach\nhimself pointed out, the law is not well-behaved in an infinite\nuniverse filled with stars; but the same can perhaps be said of\nNewton's law of gravitation (see Malament 1995, and Norton\n 1993). But Mach did not offer this equation as a proposed law valid in any\ncircumstances; he avers, “it is impossible to say whether the\nnew expression would still represent the true condition of things if\nthe stars were to perform rapid movements among one another.”\n(p. 289) \n\nIt is not clear whether Mach offered this revised first law as a first\nstep toward a theory that would replace Newton's mechanics, deriving\ninertial effects from only relative motions, as Leibniz desired. But\nmany other remarks made by Mach in his chapter criticizing absolute\nspace point in this direction, and they have given birth to the\nMach-heavy view, later to be christened “Mach's Principle”\nby Albert\n Einstein.[2]\n The Mach-heavy viewpoint calls for a new mechanics that invokes only\nrelative distances and (perhaps) their 1st and 2nd time derivatives,\nand thus ‘generally relativistic’ in the sense sometimes\nread into Leibniz's remarks about motion. Mach wished to eliminate\nabsolute time from physics too, so he would have wanted a proper\nrelationist reduction of these derivatives also. The Barbour-Bertotti\ntheories, discussed below, provide this. \n\nMach-heavy apparently involves the prediction of novel effects due to\n‘merely’ relative accelerations. Mach hints at such\neffects in his criticism of Newton's bucket: \n\nThe suggestion here seems to be that the relative rotation in stage\n(i) of the experiment might immediately generate an outward force\n(before any rotation is communicated to the water), if the sides of\nthe bucket were massive enough. (Note that this response could not\nhave been made by Leibniz — even if he had wanted to defend\nMachian relationism — because it involves action at a distance\nbetween the water and the parts of the bucket.) \n\nMore generally, Mach-heavy involves the view that all inertial effects\nshould be derived from the motions of the body in question relative to\nall other massive bodies in the universe. The water in Newton's bucket\nfeels an outward pull due (mainly) to the relative rotation of all the\nfixed stars around it. Mach-heavy is a speculation that an effect\nsomething like electromagnetic induction should be built into gravity\ntheory. (Such an effect does exist according to the General Theory of\nRelativity, and is called ‘gravitomagnetic induction’. The\nrecently finished Gravity Probe B mission was designed to measure the\ngravitomagnetic induction effect due to the Earth's rotation.) Its\nspecific form must fall off with distance much more slowly than\n1/r2, if it is to be empirically similar to Newtonian\nphysics; but it will certainly predict experimentally testable novel\nbehaviors. A theory that satisfies all the goals of Mach-heavy would\nappear to be ideal for the vindication of strict relationism and the\nelimination of absolute quantities of motion from mechanics. \n\nDirect assault on the problem of satisfying Mach-heavy in a classical\nframework proved unsuccessful, despite the efforts of others besides\nMach (e.g., Friedländer 1896, Föpl 1904, Reissner 1914,\n1915), until the work of Barbour and Bertotti in the 1970s and\n80s. (Between the late 19th century and the 1970s, there was of course\none extremely important attempt to satisfy Mach-heavy: the work of\nEinstein that led to the General Theory of Relativity. Since\nEinstein's efforts took place in a non-classical\n(Lorentz/Einstein/Minkowski) spacetime setting, we discuss them in the\nnext section.) Rather than formulating a revised law of\ngravity/inertia using relative quantities, Barbour and Bertotti\nattacked the problem using the framework of Lagrangian mechanics,\nreplacing the elements of the action that involve absolute quantities\nof motion with new terms invoking only relative distances, velocities\netc. Their first (1977) theory uses a very simple and elegant action,\nand satisfies everything one could wish for from a Mach-heavy theory:\nit is relationally pure (even with respect to time: while simultaneity\nis absolute, the temporal metric is derived from the field equations);\nit is nearly empirically equivalent to Newton's theory in a world such\nas ours (with a large-scale uniform, near-stationary matter\ndistribution); yet it does predict novel effects such as the ones Mach\nposited with his thick bucket. Among these is an ‘anisotropy of\ninertia’ effect — accelerating a body away from the\ngalactic center requires more force than accelerating it perpendicular\nto the galactic plane — large enough to be ruled out\nempirically. \n\nBarbour and Bertotti's second attempt (1982) at a relational\nLagrangian mechanics was arguably less Machian, but more empirically\nadequate. In it, solutions are sought beginning with two\ntemporally-nearby, instantaneous relational configurations of the\nbodies in the universe. Barbour and Bertotti define an\n‘intrinsic difference’ parameter that measures how\ndifferent the two configurations are. In the solutions of the theory,\nthis intrinsic difference quantity gets minimized, as well as the\nordinary action, and in this way full solutions are derived despite\nnot starting from a privileged inertial-frame description. The theory\nthey end up with turns out to be, in effect, a fragment of Newtonian\ntheory: the set of models of Newtonian mechanics and gravitation in\nwhich there is zero net angular momentum. This result makes perfect\nsense in terms of strict relationist aims. In a Newtonian world in\nwhich there is a nonzero net angular momentum (e.g., a lone rotating\nisland galaxy), this fact reveals itself in the classic\n“tendency to recede from the center”. Since a strict\nrelationist demands that bodies obey the same mechanical laws even in\n‘rotating’ coordinate systems, there cannot be any such\ntendency to recede from the center (other than in a local subsystem),\nin any of the relational theory's models. Since cosmological\nobservations, even today, reveal no net angular momentum in our world,\nthe second Barbour & Bertotti theory can lay claim to exactly the\nsame empirical successes (and problems) that Newtonian physics\nhad. The second theory does not predict the (empirically falsified)\nanisotropy of inertia derivable from the first; but neither does it\nallow a derivation of the precession of the orbit of Mercury, which\nthe first theory does (for appropriately chosen cosmic\nparameters). \n\nMach-lite, like the relational interpretations of Newtonian physics\nreviewed in\n section 5,\n offers us a way of understanding Newtonian physics without accepting\nabsolute position, velocity or acceleration. But it does so in a way\nthat lacks theoretical clarity and elegance, since it does not delimit\na clear set of cosmological models. We know that Mach-lite makes the\nsame predictions as Newton for worlds in which there is a static frame\nassociated with the stars and galaxies; but if asked about how things\nwill behave in a world with no frame of fixed stars, or in which the\nstars are far from ‘fixed’, it shrugs and refuses to\nanswer. (Recall that Mach-lite simply says: “Newton's laws hold\nin the frame of reference of the fixed stars.”) This is\nperfectly acceptable according to Mach's philosophy of science, since\nthe job of mechanics is simply to summarize observable facts in an\neconomical way. But it is unsatisfying to those with stronger realist\nintuitions about laws of nature. \n\nIf there is, in fact, a distinguishable privileged frame of reference\nin which the laws of mechanics take on a specially simple form,\nwithout that frame being determined in any way by relation to the\nmatter distribution, a realist will find it hard to resist the\ntemptation to view motions described in that frame as the\n‘true’ or ‘absolute’ motions. If there is a\nfamily of such frames, disagreeing about velocity but all agreeing\nabout acceleration, she will feel a temptation to think of at least\nacceleration as ‘true’ or ‘absolute’. If such\na realist believes motion to be by nature a relation rather than a\nproperty (and as we saw in the\n Section 1,\n not all philosophers accept this) then she will feel obliged to\naccord some sort of existence or reality to the structure —\ne.g., the structure of Galilean spacetime — in relation to which\nthese motions are defined. For philosophers with such realist\ninclinations, the ideal relational account of motion would therefore\nbe some version of Mach-heavy. \n\nThe Special Theory of Relativity (STR) is notionally based on a\nprinciple of relativity of motion; but that principle is\n‘special’ — meaning, restricted. The relativity\nprinciple built into STR is in fact nothing other than the Galilean\nprinciple of relativity, which is built into Newtonian\n physics.[3]\n In other words, while there is no privileged standard of velocity,\nthere is nevertheless a determinate fact of the matter about whether a\nbody has accelerated or non-accelerated (i.e., inertial) motion. In\nthis regard, the spacetime of STR is exactly like Galilean spacetime\n(defined in section 5 above).  In terms of the question of whether all\nmotion can be considered purely relative, one could argue that there\nis nothing new brought to the table by the introduction of Einstein's\nSTR — at least, as far as mechanics is concerned. (Once again refer\n to the entry on \n  space and time: inertial frames\n for a more detailed discussion.) \n\nAs Dorling (1978) first pointed out, however, there is a sense in\nwhich the standard absolutist arguments against ‘strict’\nrelationism using rotating objects (buckets or globes) fail in the\ncontext of STR. Maudlin (1993) used the same considerations to show\nthat there is a way of recasting relationism in STR that appears to be\nvery successful. \n\nSTR incorporates certain novelties concerning the nature of time and\nspace, and how they mesh together; perhaps the best-known examples are\nthe phenomena of ‘length contraction’, ‘time\ndilation’, and the ‘relativity of\n simultaneity.’[4]\n Since in STR both spatial distances and time intervals — when\nmeasured in the standard ways — are observer-relative (observers\nin different states of motion ‘disagreeing’ about their\nsizes), it is arguably most natural to restrict oneself to the\ninvariant spacetime separation given by the interval between\ntwo points: [dx2 + dy2 +\ndz2 — dt2] — the\nfour-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem, for spacetime\ndistances. If one regards the spacetime interval relations between\nmasses-at-times as one's basis on which space-time is built up as an\nideal entity, then with only mild caveats relationism works: the\n‘relationally pure’ facts suffice to uniquely fix how the\nmaterial systems are embeddable (up to isomorphism) in the\n‘Minkowski’ spacetime of STR. The modern variants of\nNewton's bucket and globes arguments no longer stymie the relationist\nbecause (for example) the spacetime interval relations among bits of\nmatter in Newton's bucket at rest are quite different from the\nspacetime interval relations found among those same bits of matter\nafter the bucket is rotating. For example, the spacetime\ninterval relation between a bit of water near the side of the\nbucket, at one time, and itself (say) a second later is\nsmaller than the interval relation between a center-bucket\nbit of water and itself one second later (times referred to\ninertial-frame clocks). The upshot is that, unlike the situation in\nclassical physics, a body at rest cannot have all the same spatial\nrelations among its parts as a similar body in rotation. We cannot put\na body or system into a state of rotation (or other acceleration)\nwithout thereby changing the spacetime interval relations between the\nvarious bits of matter at different moments of time. Rotation and\nacceleration supervene on spacetime interval relations. \n\nIt is worth pausing to consider to what extent this victory for (some\nform of) relationism satisfies the classical ‘strict’\nrelationism traditionally ascribed to Mach and Leibniz. The\nspatiotemporal relations that save the day against the bucket and\nglobes are, so to speak, mixed spatial and temporal distances. They\nare thus quite different from the spatial-distances-at-a-time\npresupposed by classical relationists; moreover they do not correspond\nto relative velocities (-at-a-time) either. Their oddity is forcefully\ncaptured by noticing that if we choose appropriate bits of matter at\n‘times’ eight minutes apart, I-now am at zero\ndistance from the surface of the sun (of eight minutes\n‘past’, since it took 8 minutes for light from the sun to\nreach me-now). So we are by no means dealing here with an innocuous,\n‘natural’ translation of classical relationist quantities\ninto the STR setting. On the other hand, in light of the relativity of\nsimultaneity (see note [4]),\nit can be argued that the absolute simultaneity presupposed by\nclassical relationists and absolutists alike was, in fact, something\nthat relationists should always have regarded with misgivings. From\nthis perspective, instantaneous relational configurations —\nprecisely what one starts with in the theories of Barbour and Bertotti\n— would be the things that should be treated with suspicion. \n\nIf we now return to our questions about motions — about the\nnature of velocities and accelerations — we find, as noted\nabove, that matters in the interval-relational interpretation of STR\nare much the same as in Newtonian mechanics in Galilean\nspacetime. There are no well-defined absolute velocities, but there\nare indeed well-defined absolute accelerations and rotations. In fact,\nthe difference between an accelerating body (e.g., a rocket) and an\ninertially moving body is codified directly in the cross-temporal\ninterval relations of the body with itself. So we are very\nfar from being able to conclude that all motion is relative motion of\na body with respect to other bodies. It is true that the\nabsolute motions are in 1–1 correlation with patterns of spacetime\ninterval relations, but it is not at all correct to say that they are,\nfor that reason, eliminable in favor of merely relative\nmotions. Rather we should simply say that no absolute acceleration can\nfail to have an effect on the material body or bodies accelerated. But\nthis was already true in classical physics if matter is modeled\nrealistically: the cord connecting the globes does not merely tense,\nbut also stretches; and so does the bucket, even if imperceptibly,\ni.e., the spatial relations change. \n\nMaudlin does not claim this version of relationism to be victorious\nover an absolutist or substantivalist conception of Minkowski\nspacetime, when it comes time to make judgments about the theory's\nontology. There may be more to vindicating relationism than merely\nestablishing a 1–1 correlation between absolute motions and patterns\nof spatiotemporal relations. \n\nThe simple comparison made above between STR and Newtonian physics in\nGalilean spacetime is somewhat deceptive. For one thing, Galilean\nspacetime is a mathematical innovation posterior to\nEinstein's 1905 theory; before then, Galilean spacetime had not been\nconceived, and full acceptance of Newtonian mechanics implied\naccepting absolute velocities and, arguably, absolute positions, just\nas laid down in the Scholium. So Einstein's elimination of\nabsolute velocity was a genuine conceptual advance. Moreover, the\nScholium was not the only reason for supposing that there\nexisted a privileged reference frame of ‘rest’: the\nworking assumption of almost all physicists in the latter half of the\n19th century was that, in order to understand the wave theory of\nlight, one had to postulate an aetherial medium filling all space,\nwave-like disturbances in which constituted electromagnetic\nradiation. It was assumed that the aether rest frame would be an\ninertial reference frame; and physicists felt some temptation to\nequate its frame with the absolute rest frame, though this was not\nnecessary.  Regardless of this equation of the aether with absolute\nspace, it was assumed by all 19th century physicists that the\nequations of electrodynamic theory would have to look different in a\nreference frame moving with respect to the aether than they did in the\naether's rest frame (where they presumably take their canonical form,\ni.e., Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law.) So while\ntheoreticians labored to find plausible transformation rules for the\nelectrodynamics of moving bodies, experimentalists tried to detect the\nEarth's motion in the aether. Experiment and theory played\ncollaborative roles, with experimental results ruling out certain\ntheoretical moves and suggesting new ones, while theoretical advances\ncalled for new experimental tests for their confirmation or — as\nit happened — disconfirmation. \n\nAs is well known, attempts to detect the Earth's velocity in the\naether were unsuccessful. On the theory side, attempts to formulate the\ntransformation laws for electrodynamics in moving frames — in\nsuch a way as to be compatible with experimental results — were\ncomplicated and \n inelegant.[5]\n A simplified way of seeing how Einstein swept away a host of problems\nat a stroke is this: he proposed that the Galilean principle of\nrelativity holds for Maxwell's theory, not just for mechanics. The\ncanonical (‘rest-frame’) form of Maxwell's equations\nshould be their form in any inertial reference frame. Since\nthe Maxwell equations dictate the velocity c of\nelectromagnetic radiation (light), this entails that any inertial\nobserver, no matter how fast she is moving, will measure the velocity\nof a light ray as c — no matter what the relative\nvelocity of its emitter. Einstein worked out logically the\nconsequences of this application of the special relativity principle,\nand discovered that space and time must be rather different from how\nNewton described them. STR undermined Newton's absolute time just as\ndecisively as it undermined his absolute space. \n\nEinstein's STR was the first clear and empirically successful physical\ntheory to overtly eliminate the concepts of absolute rest and absolute\nvelocity while recovering most of the successes of classical\nmechanics and 19th century electrodynamics. It therefore deserves to\nbe considered the first highly successful theory to explicitly\nrelativize motion, albeit only partially. But STR only recovered most\nof the successes of classical physics: crucially, it left out\ngravity. And there was certainly reason to be concerned that Newtonian\ngravity and STR would prove incompatible: classical gravity acted\ninstantaneously at a distance, while STR eliminated the privileged\nabsolute simultaneity that this instantaneous action presupposes. \n\nSeveral ways of modifying Newtonian gravity to make it compatible with\nthe spacetime structure of STR suggested themselves to physicists in\nthe years 1905–1912, and a number of interesting Lorentz-covariant\ntheories were proposed (set in the Minkowski spacetime of STR).\nEinstein rejected these efforts one and all, for violating either\nempirical facts or theoretical desiderata. But Einstein's chief reason\nfor not pursuing the reconciliation of gravitation with STR's\nspacetime appears to have been his desire, beginning in 1907, to\nreplace STR with a theory in which not only velocity could be\nconsidered merely relative, but also acceleration. That is to say,\nEinstein wanted if possible to completely eliminate all absolute\nquantities of motion from physics, thus realizing a theory that\nsatisfies at least one kind of ‘strict’\nrelationism. (Regarding Einstein's rejection of Lorentz-covariant\ngravity theories, see Norton 1992; regarding Einstein's quest to fully\nrelativize motion, see Hoefer 1994.) \n\nEinstein began to see this complete relativization as possible in\n1907, thanks to his discovery of the Equivalence Principle. Imagine we\nare far out in space, in a rocket ship accelerating at a constant rate\ng = 9.98 m/s2. Things will feel\njust like they do on the surface of the Earth; we will feel a clear\nup-down direction, bodies will fall to the floor when released,\netc. Indeed, due to the well-known empirical fact that gravity affects\nall bodies by imparting a force proportional to their matter (and\nenergy) content, independent of their internal constitution, we know\nthat any experiment performed on this rocket will give the same\nresults that the same experiment would give if performed on the\nEarth. Now, Newtonian theory teaches us to consider the apparent\ndownward, gravity-like forces in the rocket ship as\n‘pseudo-forces’ or ‘inertial forces’, and\ninsists that they are to be explained by the fact that the ship is\naccelerating in absolute space. But Einstein asked whether there is\nany way for the person in the rocket to regard him/herself as being\n‘at rest’ rather than in absolute (accelerated)\nmotion? And the answer he gave is: Yes. The rocket traveler may\nregard him/herself as being ‘at rest’ in a homogeneous and\nuniform gravitational field. This will explain all the observational\nfacts just as well as the supposition that he/she is accelerating\nrelative to absolute space (or, absolutely accelerating in Minkowski\nspacetime). But is it not clear that the latter is the truth, while\nthe former is a fiction? By no means; if there were a uniform\ngravitational field filling all space, then it would affect all the\nother bodies in the world — the Earth, the stars, etc, imparting\nto them a downward acceleration away from the rocket; and that is\nexactly what the traveler observes. \n\nIn 1907, Einstein published his first gravitation theory (Einstein\n1907), treating the gravitational field as a scalar field that also\nrepresented the (now variable and frame-dependent) speed of light.\nEinstein viewed the theory as only a first step on the road to\neliminating absolute motion. In the 1907 theory, the theory's\nequations take the same form in any inertial or uniformly\naccelerating frame of reference. One might say that this theory\nreduces the class of absolute motions, leaving only rotation and other\nnon-uniform accelerations as absolute. But, Einstein reasoned, if\nuniform acceleration can be regarded as equivalent to being at rest in\na constant gravitational field, why should it not be possible also to\nregard inertial effects from these other, non-uniform motions as\nsimilarly equivalent to “being at rest in a (variable)\ngravitational field”? Thus Einstein set himself the goal of\nexpanding the principle of equivalence to embrace all forms of\n‘accelerated’ motion. \n\nEinstein thought that the key to achieving this aim lay in further\nexpanding the range of reference frames in which the laws of physics\ntake their canonical form, to include frames adapted to any arbitrary\nmotions. More specifically, since the class of all continuous and\ndifferentiable coordinate systems includes as a proper subclass the\ncoordinate systems adapted to any such frame of reference, if he could\nachieve a theory of gravitation, electromagnetism and mechanics that\nwas generally covariant — its equations taking the same\nform in any coordinate system from this general class — then the\ncomplete relativity of motion would be achieved. If there are no\nspecial frames of reference in which the laws take on a simpler\ncanonical form, there is no physical reason to consider any particular\nstate or states of motion as privileged, nor deviations from those as\nrepresenting ‘absolute motion’. (Here we are just laying\nout Einstein's train of thought; later we will see reasons to question\nthe last step.)  And in 1915, Einstein achieved his aim in the General\nTheory of Relativity (GTR). \n\nThere is one key element left out of this success story, however, and\nit is crucial to understanding why most physicists reject Einstein's\nclaim to have eliminated absolute states of motion in GTR.  Going back\nto our accelerating rocket, we accepted Einstein's claim that we could\nregard the ship as hovering at rest in a universe-filling\ngravitational field. But a gravitational field, we usually suppose, is\ngenerated by matter. How is this universe-filling field linked to\ngenerating matter? The answer may be supplied by Mach-heavy. Regarding\nthe ‘accelerating’ rocket which we decide to regard as\n‘at rest’ in a gravitational field, the Machian says: all\nthose stars and galaxies, etc., jointly accelerating downward\n(relative to the rocket), ‘produce’ that gravitational\nfield. The mathematical specifics of how this field is generated will\nhave to be different from Newton's law of gravity, of course; but it\nshould give essentially the same results when applied to low-mass,\nslow-moving problems such as the orbits of the planets, so as to\ncapture the empirical successes of Newtonian gravity. Einstein\nthought, in 1916 at least, that the field equations of GTR are\nprecisely this mathematical replacement for Newton's law of gravity,\nand that they fully satisfied the desiderata of Mach-heavy\nrelationism.  But it was not so. (See the entry on\n early philosophical interpretations of general relativity.) \n\nIn GTR, spacetime is locally very much like flat Minkowski\nspacetime. There is no absolute velocity locally, but there are clear\nlocal standards of accelerated vs non-accelerated motion, i.e., local\ninertial frames. In these ‘freely falling’ frames bodies\nobey the usual rules for non-gravitational physics familiar from STR,\nalbeit only approximately. But overall spacetime is curved, and local\ninertial frames may tip, bend and twist as we move from one region to\nanother. The structure of curved spacetime is encoded in the metric\nfield tensor gab, with the curvature\nencoding gravity at the same time: gravitational forces are so to\nspeak ‘built into’ the metric field, geometrized\naway. Since the spacetime structure encodes gravity and inertia, and\nin a Mach-heavy theory these phenomena should be completely determined\nby the relational distribution of matter (and relative motions),\nEinstein wished to see the metric as entirely determined by the\ndistribution of matter and energy. But what the GTR field equations\nentail is, in general, only a partial-determination relation. \n\nWe cannot go into the mathematical details necessary for a full\ndiscussion of the successes and failures of Mach-heavy in the GTR\ncontext. But one can see why the Machian interpretation Einstein hoped\nhe could give to the curved spacetimes of his theory fails to be\nplausible, by considering a few simple ‘worlds’ permitted\nby GTR. In the first place, for our hovering rocket ship, if we are to\nattribute the gravity field it feels to matter, there has got to\nbe all this other matter in the universe. But if we regard\nthe rocket as a mere ‘test body’ (not itself substantially\naffecting the gravity present or absent in the universe), then we can\nnote that according to GTR, if we remove all the stars, galaxies,\nplanets etc. from the world, the gravitational field does not\ndisappear. On the contrary, it stays basically the same locally, and\nglobally it takes the form of empty Minkowski spacetime, precisely the\nquasi-absolute structure Einstein was hoping to eliminate. Solutions\nof the GTR field equations for arbitrary realistic configurations of\nmatter (e.g., a rocket ship ejecting a stream of particles to push\nitself forward) are hard to come by, and in fact a realistic two-body\nexact solution has yet to be discovered. But numerical methods can be\napplied for many purposes, and physicists do not doubt that something\nlike our accelerating rocket — in otherwise empty space —\nis possible according to the\n theory.[6]\n We see clearly, then, that GTR fails to satisfy Einstein's own\nunderstanding of Mach's Principle, according to which, in the absence\nof matter, space itself should not be able to exist. A second example:\nGTR allows us to model a single rotating object in an\notherwise empty universe (e.g., a neutron star). Relationism of the\nMachian variety says that such rotation is impossible, since it can\nonly be understood as rotation relative to some sort of absolute\nspace. In the case of GTR, this is basically right: the rotation is\nbest understood as rotation relative to a ‘background’\nspacetime that is identical to the Minkowski spacetime of STR, only\n‘curved’ by the presence of matter in the region of the\nstar. \n\nOn the other hand, there is one charge of failure-to-relativize-motion\nsometimes leveled at GTR that is unfair.  It is sometimes asserted\nthat the simple fact that the metric field (or the connection it\ndetermines) distinguishes, at every location, motions that are\n‘absolutely’ accelerated and/or ‘absolutely\nrotating’ from those that are not, by itself entails that GTR\nfails to embody a folk-Leibniz style general relativity of motion\n(e.g.  Earman (1989), ch. 5). We think this is incorrect, and leads to\nunfairly harsh judgments about confusion on Einstein's part. The local\ninertial structure encoded in the metric would not be\n‘absolute’ in any meaningful sense, if that structure were\nin some clear sense fully determined by the relationally specified\nmatter-energy distribution. Einstein was not simply confused\nwhen he named his gravity theory. (Just what is to be understood by\n“the relationally specified matter-energy distribution” is\na further, thorny issue, which we cannot enter into here.) \n\nGTR does not fulfill all the goals of Mach-heavy, at least as\nunderstood by Einstein, and he recognized this fact by 1918 (Einstein\n1918). And yet … GTR comes tantalizingly close to achieving\nthose goals, in certain striking ways. For one thing, GTR does predict\nMach-heavy effects, known as ‘frame-dragging’: if we could\nmodel Mach's thick-walled bucket in GTR, it seems clear that it would\npull the water slightly outward, and give it a slight tendency to\nbegin rotating in the same sense as the bucket (even if the big\nbucket's walls were not actually touching the water. While GTR does\npermit us to model a lone rotating object, if we model the object as a\nshell of mass (instead of a solid sphere) and let the size of the\nshell increase (to model the ‘sphere of the fixed stars’\nwe see around us), then as Brill & Cohen (1966) showed, the\nframe-dragging becomes complete inside the shell. In other words: our\noriginal Minkowski background structure effectively disappears, and\ninertia becomes wholly determined by the shell of matter, just as Mach\nposited was the case. This complete determination of inertia by the\nglobal matter distribution appears to be a feature of other models,\nincluding the Friedman-Robertson-Walker-Lemâitre Big Bang models\nthat best match observations of our universe. \n\nFinally, it is important to recognize that GTR is generally covariant\nin a very special sense: unlike all other prior theories (and unlike\nmany subsequent quantum theories), it postulates no fixed\n‘prior’ or ‘background’ spacetime\nstructure. As mathematicians and physicists realized early on, other\ntheories, e.g., Newtonian mechanics and STR, can be put into a\ngenerally covariant form. But when this is done, there are inevitably\nmathematical objects postulated as part of the formalism, whose role\nis to represent absolute elements of spacetime structure. What is\nunique about GTR is that it was the first, and is still the only\n‘core’ physical theory, to have no such absolute elements\nin its covariant equations. The spacetime structure in GTR,\nrepresented by the metric field (which determines the connection), is\nat least partly ‘shaped’ by the distribution of matter and\nenergy. And in certain models of the theory, such as the Big Bang\ncosmological models, some authors have claimed that the local\nstandards of inertial motion — the local ‘gravitational\nfield’ of Einstein's equivalence principle — are entirely\nfixed by the matter distribution throughout space and time, just as\nMach-heavy requires (see, for example, Wheeler and Cuifollini\n1995). \n\nAbsolutists and relationists are thus left in a frustrating and\nperplexing quandary by GTR. Considering its anti-Machian models, we\nare inclined to say that motions such as rotation and acceleration\nremain absolute, or nearly-totally-absolute, according to the\ntheory. On the other hand, considering its most Mach-friendly models,\nwhich include all the models taken to be good candidates for\nrepresenting the actual universe, we may be inclined to say: motion\nin our world is entirely relative; the inertial effects\nnormally used to argue for absolute motion are all understandable as\neffects of rotations and accelerations relative to the cosmic matter,\njust as Mach hoped. But even if we agree that motions in our world are\nin fact all relative in this sense, this does not automatically settle\nthe traditional relationist/absolutist debate, much less the\nrelationist/substantivalist debate. Many philosophers (including, we\nsuspect, Nerlich 1994 and Earman 1989) would be happy to acknowledge\nthe Mach-friendly status of our spacetime, and argue nevertheless that\nwe should understand that spacetime as a real thing, more like a\nsubstance than a mere ideal construct of the mind as Leibniz\ninsisted. Some, though not all, attempts to convert GTR into a quantum\ntheory would accord spacetime this same sort of substantiality that\nother quantum fields possess. Since 2000 a new approach to the issue of the nature of space-time\nstructures has emerged, in the works of Robert Disalle, and especially\nOliver Pooley and Harvey Brown.  The latter's ‘dynamical\napproach’ asserts that the space-time structure of our world is\nwhat it is because of the dynamical laws of nature and their\nsymmetries. That is, the dynamical laws are (at least, relative to\nspace-time) fundamental, and space-time structure is derivative.\nCorrespondingly, the dynamical approach (DA) rejects the view that\nputs the explanatory arrow in the opposite direction, i.e., the claim\nthat the dynamical laws are how they are, in part, because they are\nconstrained to “fit” the independently real structure of\n(substantival or absolute, in some sense(s) at least) space-time. There is a tight relationship between the geometrical symmetries of\na spacetime and the (spatiotemporal) symmetries of a theory that\ndescribes the physics of matter (in a broad sense, including fields)\nin it. (Theories such as GTR, in which spacetime has its own dynamics\nare more complicated, and will be discussed later.) Each is a set of\ntransformations, with a rule of composition: formally a\n‘group’. (For instance, the group of rotations in the\nplane has a distinct element for every angle in the range 0–360\ndegrees; the composition of two rotations is of course the single\nrotation through the sum of their angles.) There are good reasons to\nhold that the symmetry groups of theory and spacetime must\nagree. First, since the theory describes matter, and hence (arguably)\nwhat is measurable, any theoretical symmetries not reflected in the\npostulated spacetime structure indicate unmeasurable geometry: for\ninstance, if an absolute present were postulated in relativistic\nphysics. While in the other direction, if there were extra spacetime\nsymmetries not beyond those found in the dynamics, then per\nimpossible one could measure nonexistent geometric quantities:\nfor instance, a theory that depends on absolute velocities cannot be\nformulated in Galilean spacetime.. (Earman 1989, Chapter 3 is a good\ndiscussion.) A given geometry for spacetime thus formally constrains the\nallowable theories to those with the just the right symmetries —\nnot too many, and not too few. It was an assumption of many\nsubstantivalists that this constraint was not merely formal, but\nontological: that the geometry (hence the manifold itself) is more\nfundamental than the laws, or that geometry offers a\n‘real’ explanation of the form of the laws. (For instance,\nsuch a line of thought is implicit in Earman 1989, 125.) However, that\nthe symmetries should agree does not specify any direction of\ndependence, and it could be reversed, so that the geometric symmetries\nare ontologically determined by those of the laws of the theory\n— hence the geometry itself is an expression of the dynamics of\nmatter. In the words of Brown and Pooley (2006) (making these points\nabout STR): “… space-time's Minkowskian structure cannot\nbe taken to explain the Lorentz covariance of the dynamical\nlaws. From our perspective … the direction of explanation goes\nthe other way around. It is the Lorentz covariance of the laws that\nunderwrites the fact that the geometry of space-time is\nMinkowskian.”  In its denial of the independence or fundamentality of space-time\nstructure, DA is in the relationist tradition. On the other hand,\nprima facie DA offers no direct account of what sorts of\nspatio-temporal (or other, e.g. causal) relations are to be taken as\nprimitive and unproblematic, so it is not immediately clear how it\nrelates to the tradition. However, further explication of the approach\nquickly leads to clarification of the relationist commitments of the\ntheory, for can one in fact state dynamical laws, or understand them\nas “holding” or “governing”, without\npresupposing [facts about] space-time structure?  Take Newton's three laws plus the law of gravity as a test case for\nDA.  The gravity law gives the gravitational force between any two\nbits of matter, as a function of their distance and the direction from\none body to the other.  At least the distances of all things from each\nother, at a moment of time, is presupposed.  So far this sounds\nunproblematic; instantaneous distances are the meat and potatoes of\nrelationism, and presupposing their existence would be be no threat to\nthe DA.  But when we turn to Newton's First and Second Laws, things\nlook more problematic. The First Law asserts that bodies not acted\nupon by an external force will move with constant velocity; similarly\nfor the Second Law and acceleration. The laws seem to presuppose that\nthese are meaningful terms, but in spacetime terms their meaning is\ngiven in by geometric structures: for instance, constant velocity in\nGalilean spacetime means having a straight spacetime trajectory. And\nthe problem is not restricted to Newtonian physics; the same point can\nbe made regarding theories that presuppose the Minkowski background\nspace-time structure, e.g., the quantum field theories of the\nStandard Model. The advocate of DA will take laws such as Newton's as not\npresupposing background space-time, but rather entailing that things\nbehave ‘as if’ they were embedded in such a background.\nWhile there's nothing intrinsically problematic about as-if\nclaims, it can't be left as a mere flat-footed assertion.  If\nthings are not in fact embedded in a space-time, then the DA advocate\nshould tell us what elements of physical theory do in fact represent\nreal things (and their properties/relations), and how their behavior\ncan be understood as giving rise to the appearance of a background\nspace-time.  The DA advocate is thus drawn into engaging in a defense\nof some sort of relationism.  Moreover, the DA advocate has to explain\nthe sense in which dynamical laws that apparently presuppose\nspatio-temporal structures can be true of a world that lacks such\nstructures intrinsically and ‘has’ them only in a\nderivative, as-if sense. It's worth stressing that while DA opposes fundamental\nabsolute quantities, it is potentially neutral on the question of\nmanifold substantivalism (indeed, this topic barely appears in Brown\n2005). That is, one could develop a view in which the manifold is as\n‘real’as matter, but in which it does not\nhave its geometric (as opposed to topological, say) properties\nintrinsically — they are possessed in virtue of the laws. As it\nturns out, that is not the approach that advocates of DA have tended\nto take. (Norton's (2008) criticizes the substantivalist version\nof DA). One obvious way to address the question is to appeal to\nHuggett's (2006) regularity relationism discussed above: see\nHuggett (2009) and Pooley (2013). The idea is to consider the\ndynamical laws as regularities that systematize and describe the\npatterns of events concerning an underlying ontology/ideology that\ninvolves or presupposes only very limited spatiotemporal features.  To\nillustrate how this approach might go, consider Pooley's proposal that\nthe dynamical approach to special-relativistic theories might\npostulate only R4 topological spatiotemporal structure, which could be\n(for example) attributed to a massive scalar field. Suppose we are given a full 4-D field description of such a field, in\nterms of some arbitrary coordinate system.  This would describe a\nsimple ‘Humean mosaic‘ for a world with just a scalar field as\ncontent.  Now, smooth coordinate changes applied to such a description\nwill generate distinct mathematical representations of that Humean\nmosaic, given using distinct coordinatizations of the field-stuff.\nIt might happen that, among all such representations, there is a\nsubclass of coordinate systems which are such that (i) when the\nscalar field is described using a member of the class, it turns out\nthat its values at spacetime points satisfy some simple/elegant\nmathematical equation; and moreover, (ii) the members of the class are\nrelated by a nicely specifiable symmetry group.  If this is so, then\nthe simple/elegant equation can be taken as expressing a dynamical\nlaw for the world of this mosaic, and the symmetry group of the law\ncan be seen as capturing the derivative, not intrinsic, space-time\nstructure of the world.  If the symmetry group is the Poincaré group,\nfor example, then the field behaves ‘as if’ it were embedded in a\nspacetime with Minkowski geometry. But all this means is that the\ndynamics is empirically equivalent to a theory with intrinsic\nMinkowski geometry. From the point of view of DA, such a theory is\nmerely an interesting, and perhaps useful, representation of the real\nfacts: and it's a mistake to take every feature of a representation to\ncorrespond to something in reality. Forthright investigation of DA as a variant of regularity relationism\nhas only just begun, but extending the treatment from scalar fields to\nmore complex vector-, tensor- and spinor-fields may present a\nproblem. It's true that vector and tensors can be defined in terms of\ncoordinates and scalar fields, and one could imagine telling a formal\nstory about these along the lines sketched for the scalar field: the\nequations governing them take an especially simple — and Lorentz\ninvariant — form in certain coordinates. But it is not clear\nthat such mathematical fields can be taken to properly represent\nphysical fields without a metric: for instance, as Earman (1989, 106)\npoints out, such quantities as the energy density cannot be defined\nwithout a metric. However, a large part of the appeal of the DA is\nthat it classes intangible, mathematical structures — geometry\n— as mere representation, and tangible things — matter\n(including fields) and its properties — as real. If formal\n— pre-metrical — fields don't represent the concrete\nobjects found in the world, then it is hard to see why the DA is an\nadvance on taking geometry as a literal structure of the world. In\nother words, an account is owed of how a tensor, say, represents the\nelectromagnetic field without a metric. The dynamical approach has only recently been much discussed as a\ngeneral doctrine about space-time.  In Brown (2005) and earlier works,\nit is better known via a set of distinctive and specific claims made\nin the context of special relativistic physics and General\nRelativity. This subsection and the next will briefly analyze some of\nthose claims. The most striking and controversial claim made by DA advocates\nBrown & Pooley concerns the special relativistic phenomena of\nlength contraction and time dilation and how one should best\nunderstand them to be explained.  A common view among realists about\nspacetime is that these phenomena are explained by the fact that\nmoving rods and clocks exist in a spacetime with (locally) Minkowski\nstructure.  It is because both we (and our measuring devices), and the\nmoving rod, are living in such a spacetime, that we measure the\nfast-moving rod to be contracted in length.  By contrast, the DA\nclaims that rods and clocks behave as they do because of the dynamical\nlaws.  The fact that those laws are Lorentz-covariant (i.e., have as\ntheir symmetries the Poincaré group of transformations) is sufficient\nto guarantee that rods and clocks will behave in the ways predicted in\nspecial relativity theory; the laws explain both those phenomena, and\nthe fact that spacetime “has” Minkowski structure. (Important\ndiscussions of these issues can also be found in Janssen, 2009, and\nFrisch, 2011.) But the claim that an explanation starting from the Lorentz\ncovariance of the laws is the best or “right” sort of explanation can\nbe challenged, in at least two ways. First, there is an alternative view of length contraction and time\ndilation in special relativity, according to which the best\nexplanation is no explanation, because they are not\n“real” phenomena, in the relevant sense, at all.  On this\nview such ‘kinematical’ effects are to be thought of as\nsomething more like perspective-based illusions.  What is real are the\nquantities that are ‘intrinsic’ or\n‘invariant’, i.e., the same no matter what reference frame\nor coordinate system is chosen to describe things.  “Proper\nlength” and “proper time” (length as measured when\nat rest, and time as measured by a co-moving clock respectively) are\nintrinsic/real features of bodies and processes, and correspond to the\n(frame-invariant) space-time interval between certain well defined\nspace-time points.  But length-as-measured-by-a-moving-observer, which\nis essentially a frame- or coordinate-dependent quantity that varies\ndepending on the state of motion of the observer, is not an invariant\nor intrinsic quantity, and therefore does not require\na physical explanation at \nall.[7]\n Brown (2005) rejects this view, as do many\nother philosophers of physics (in part due to issues mentioned in the\nnote just above), but many others still defend it. Let's set this no-explanation-needed view aside and consider the\nspacetime realist perspective mentioned above. \nBrown rejects the notion, which can be glimpsed in some passages by\nadvocates of substantival spacetime, that spacetime's structure\nshould be thought of as causing fast-moving bodies to shrink in\nlength, etc.  But geometric realists need not claim that the\nexplanatory relation between spacetime structure and length\ncontraction is causal; on this view, it is more naturally viewed as\nlogical.  That is to say: in a Minkowski spacetime, if one\nhas “rigid rods” and “clocks”, and uses these\nin the standard ways to measure the “length” of a (rigid)\nmoving body in the direction of its motion, it is a simple\nmathematical or geometrical fact that the moving body will be measured\nas having its length contracted in accord with the Lorentz-Fitzgerald\nformula.  In many relativity texts students learn how to derive these\neffects geometrically on Minkowski spacetime diagrams. Nothing about\nthe dynamics governing these bodies is assumed, other than that the\ndynamics does indeed allow for the existence of such\n“clocks” and “rigid rods”. Pooley (2013) writes: “The substantivalist should agree that\na complex material rod does not conform to the axioms of some geometry\nsimply because that is the substantival geometry in which it is\nimmersed; the rod would not do what it does were the laws governing\nits microphysical parts different in key respects.” In one\nimportant sense, the substantivalist can insist that the rod does and\nmust conform to the axioms of Minkowski geometry simply because it\nlives in Minkowski spacetime.  If an object exists in a space or\nspacetime of X-geometry, no physical laws, or forces, can force the\nrelations of its parts to violate the axioms of X-geometry. In another\nsense, however, Pooley is clearly right. If the laws were very\ndifferent, there might be no rigid bodies with constant intrinsic\n(rest-) length.  Different laws or exotic forces might\n“cause” objects to do all sorts of strange things (shrink\nor expand, in any time-variable way you like); with just the right\ndynamical laws, it might be possible in a Minkowski world to have\n“rods” and “clocks” that operate in ways that\nappear to reveal the world as having Newtonian (or spherical, or\n…) spacetime structure. The substantivalist can respond that in such a case, those rods\nwould not measure space-like interval, and those clocks would not\nmeasure time-like interval, i.e., would not measure the true distances\nin a spacetime with Minkowski metric structure.  Those rods and clocks\nwould still conform to Minkowski geometry; logically speaking, they\nhave no choice.  They would just not transparently reveal it. It is unclear whether this response amounts to much of a victory\nfor the substantivalist.  In a world where the rods and clocks (and,\nlet us grant, all other phenomena) seem to reveal (say) a Newtonian\nspacetime geometry, what is the status of the putative “real”\nMinkowski geometry lurking underneath?  Would it even deserve to be\ncalled the “true” spacetime geometry? The problem can be put this way:\nwhy do the symmetries of the dynamics have to respect the geometry of\nspacetime? There is no comparable question for the DA proponent,\nsince for her the geometry simply represents whatever symmetries there\nare. This sort of question arises also in the case of General\nRelativity, as we will now see. General Relativity theory is, at first blush, very congenial to the\ncore idea of the dynamical approach.  The DA insists that the\nstructure of space and time is not something existing in its own\nright, independently of the laws of nature that happen to hold in the\nworld.  In General Relativity (GR) there is no fixed, prior or\n“background” spacetime structure that could be seen as independent of\nthe dynamical laws; on the contrary, spacetime structure is\nexplicitly constrained by, arguably directly determined by, the\ndynamical laws, i.e., Einstein's field equations (EFE). On the other hand, in GR one cannot see the structure of spacetime\nas merely a reflection of the symmetry properties of the dynamical\nlaws, as the DA claims we should do in the case of theories with\nfixed background geometries. The symmetries of EFE are usually considered to\nbe the general general covariance group of continuously differentiable\ntransformations, which would seem to correspond to no spacetime\nstructure at all (or at most, topological structure with no metrical\nproperties).  If there is a sense in which the DA slogan that laws\ncome first, spacetime structure second is to make sense — over and\nabove the sense noted just above — it will have to be different than\nhow this plays out in earlier theories. Brown (2005) offers just such a different way of understanding the\nspirit of the DA in GR.  He claims (i) that the\nmetric g should be thought of as, in the\nfirst instance, just a physical field, akin in principle to\nthe electromagnetic field; and (ii) it does not have the significance\nof representing the metrical structure of space and time\na priori, but instead “earns” that significance\nbecause the laws governing other matter fields happen to\ninvolve g in such a way that they behave as\nif they constituted, e.g., rods and clocks, in a geometry described\nby g.  For Brown this is the content of the\n‘weak equivalence principle’.  In this way Brown maintains\nthat, in GR as before, it is dynamics (how things actually move) that\nis explanatorily prior, and spacetime structure\n(g having the role of representing spacetime\ngeometry) that is posterior. Both of these claims are controversial.  (i) is by no means the\nstandard view in physics presentations of GR, and is somewhat in\ntension with standard presentations that\ntreat g as representing straightforwardly\nthe geometry of spacetime, and sharply distinguish it from fields\nrepresenting the material “contents” of spacetime.  More\nimportantly, (ii) is in tension with the history\nof g's introduction into physics by Einstein\nin 1913–1915, as well as with standard textbook presentations\nof g and its role in GR. In support of claim (ii) Brown (2005, ch. 9) discusses a recent\nalternative gravity theory, Bekenstein's TeVeS theory, which actually\nhas two g-like tensors; one plays the purely\nmathematical role of the metric, e.g. serving to raise and lower\nindices on other tensor fields and determining the mathematical\nderivative operator, while the other is the “apparent”\nmetric structure of spacetime, corresponding to what moving rods and\nclocks survey.  For Brown, the TeVeS theory makes vivid the conceptual\ndifference between the purely mathematical role of “metric\ntensor” and the role of codifying observable geometry; they\nhappen to coincide in GR, but this is in a sense a contingent fact,\nnot something guaranteed a priori by GR's mathematical\napparatus. But it is unclear that Brown is justified in drawing lessons about\nthe metric g of General Relativity from\nTeVeS, which is, after all, a quite different theory from GR.  In that\ntheory the two roles of g are separated by\ndesign; though the consistency of the theory overall, and its ability\nto adequately model its intended target systems in the real world must\nbe established by calculations and arguments, what element of the\ntheory represents what physical aspect of reality is specified in the\noriginal presentation of the theory — in the ordinary-language\ntext surrounding the equations, in effect.  The same can be said of\nGR.  In GR, Einstein made clear from the start\nthat g both serves as the\nmathematical/geometric metric of spacetime, and also determines the\nmetrical and inertial (affine) structure surveyed by light rays and\nmoving bodies.  In GR also, the consistency of the theory overall and\nits ability to model its intended target systems had to be established\nby calculation and argument, but the geometric significance\nof g in GR was in fact a postulate or\nstipulation built into the theory from the start.  Without the\nassumption of that geometric significance, the Einstein\ntensor G would not have a clear geometric\nmeaning, and the stress-energy tensor T\nwould not have a clear physical meaning; g qua\nmetric is used in the definition of both. Thus, while GR is consonant with the broad-stroke desiderata of the\nDA, in that spacetime structure is definitely not independent of the\ndynamical laws, i.e., the EFE, Brown's more specific claims about the\nstatus of the spacetime metric in GR are open to dispute. \n\nThis article has been concerned with tracing the history and\nphilosophy of ‘absolute’ and ‘relative’\ntheories of space and motion.  Along the way we have been at pains to\nintroduce some clear terminology for various different concepts (e.g.,\n‘true’ motion, ‘substantivalism’,\n‘absolute space’), but what we have not really done is say\nwhat the difference between absolute and relative space and\nmotion is: just what is at stake? Recently Rynasiewicz (2000) has\nargued that there simply are no constant issues running through the\nhistory that we have discussed here; that there is no stable meaning\nfor either ‘absolute motion’ or ‘relative\nmotion’ (or ‘substantival space’ vs\n‘relational space’). While we agree to a certain extent,\nwe think that nevertheless there are a series of issues that have\nmotivated thinkers again and again; indeed, those that we identified\nin the introduction.  (One quick remark: Rynasiewicz is probably right\nthat the issues cannot be expressed in formally precise terms, but\nthat does not mean that there are no looser philosophical affinities\nthat shed useful light on the history.) \n\nOur discussion has revealed several different issues, of which we will\nhighlight three as components of the ‘absolute-relative\ndebate’.  (i) There is the question of whether all motions and\nall possible descriptions of motions are equal, or whether some are\n‘real’ — what we have called, in Seventeenth Century\nparlance, ‘true’. There is a natural temptation for those\nwho hold that there is ‘nothing but the relative positions and\nmotions between bodies’ (and more so for their readers) to add\n‘and all such motions are equal’, thus denying the\nexistence of true motion. However, arguably — perhaps\nsurprisingly — no one we have discussed has unreservedly held\nthis view (at least not consistently): Descartes considered motion\n‘properly speaking’ to be privileged, Leibniz introduced\n‘active force’ to ground motion (arguably in his mechanics\nas well as metaphysically), and Mach's view seems to be that the\ndistribution of matter in the universe determines a preferred standard\nof inertial motion. (Again, in general relativity, there is a\ndistinction between inertial and accelerated motion.) \n\nThat is, relationists can allow true motions if they offer an analysis\nof them in terms of the relations between bodies. Given this logical\npoint, and given the historical ways thinkers have understood\nthemselves, it seems unhelpful to characterize the issues in (i) as\nconstituting an absolute-relative debate, hence our use of the term\n‘true’ instead of ‘absolute’. So we are led to\nthe second question: (ii) is true motion definable in terms of\nrelations or not? (Of course the answer depends on what kind of\ndefinitions will count, and absent an explicit definition —\nDescartes' proper motion for example — the issue is often taken\nto be that of whether true motions supervene on relations, something\nNewton's globes are often supposed to refute.) It seems reasonable to\ncall this the issue of whether motion is absolute or\nrelative. Descartes and Mach are relationists about motion in this\nsense, while Newton is an absolutist.  Leibniz is also an absolutist\nabout motion in his metaphysics, and if our reading is correct, also\nabout the interpretation of motion in the laws of collision. This\nclassification of Leibniz's views runs contrary to his customary\nidentification as relationist-in-chief, but we will clarify his\nrelationist credentials below. Finally, we have discussed (ii) in the\ncontext of relativity, first examining Maudlin's proposal that the\nembedding of a relationally-specified system in Minkowski spacetime is\nin general unique once all the spacetime interval-distance relations\nare given. This proposal may or may not be held to satisfy the\nrelational-definability question of (ii), but in any case it cannot be\ncarried over to the context of general relativity theory. In the case\nof GTR we linked relational motion to the satisfaction of Mach's\nPrinciple, just as Einstein did in the early years of the theory.\nDespite some promising features displayed by GTR, and certain of its\nmodels, we saw that Mach's Principle is not fully satisfied in GTR as\na whole. We also noted that in the absence of absolute simultaneity,\nit becomes an open question what relations are to be permitted in the\ndefinition (or supervience base) — spacetime interval relations?\nInstantaneous spatial distances and velocities on a 3-d hypersurface?\n(Barbour has argued that GTR is fully Machian, using a 3-d\nrelational-configuration approach. See Barbour, Foster and Murchadha\n2002. This work has recently attracted interest as a potential basis\nfor formulating a quantum theory of gravity: Barbour 2012.) \nThe final issue is that of (iii) whether absolute motion is motion\nwith respect to substantival space or not. Of course this is how\nNewton understood acceleration — as acceleration relative to\nabsolute space. More recent Newtonians share this view, although\nmotion for them is with respect to substantival Galilean spacetime (or\nrather, since they know Newtonian mechanics is false, they hold that\nthis is the best interpretation of that theory). Leibniz denied that\nmotion was relative to space itself, since he denied the reality of\nspace; for him true motion was the possession of active force. So\ndespite his ‘absolutism’ (our adjective not his) about\nmotion he was simultaneously a relationist about space: ‘space\nis merely relative’. Following Leibniz's lead we can call this\ndebate the question of whether space is absolute or relative. The\ndrawback of this name is that it suggests a separation between motion\nand space, which exists in Leibniz's views, but which is otherwise\nproblematic; still, no better description presents itself. \n\nOthers who are absolutists about motion but relationists about space\ninclude Sklar (1974) and van Fraassen (1985); Sklar introduced a\nprimitive quantity of acceleration, not supervenient on motions\nrelative to anything at all, while van Fraassen let the laws\nthemselves pick out the inertial frames. It is of course arguable\nwhether any of these three proposals are successful; (even) stripped\nof Leibniz's Aristotelian packaging, can absolute quantities of motion\n‘stand on their own feet’? And under what understanding of\nlaws can they ground a standard of inertial motion? Huggett (2006)\ndefends a similar position of absolutism about motion, but relationism\nabout space; he argues — in the case of Newtonian physics\n— that fundamentally there is nothing to space but relations\nbetween bodies, but that absolute motions supervene — not on the\nrelations at any one time — but on the entire history of\nrelations.","contact.mail":"carl.hoefer@ub.edu","contact.domain":"ub.edu"}]
