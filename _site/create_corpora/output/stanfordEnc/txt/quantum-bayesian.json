But many physicists and some\nphilosophers have questioned or rejected this view of quantum theory.\nThey have viewed the theory as concerned with our observation and\ndescription of, knowledge or beliefs about, or interactions with the\nworld. Views of this kind have been expressed since the 1920s when\nquantum theory emerged in close to its present form. This entry is\nconcerned with more recent developments of this tradition by\nphysicists and philosophers, much of it described as quantum Bayesian\nor pragmatist. This entry discusses quantum Bayesianism in section 1,\naddressing common objections in section 2. After section 3 briefly\nnotes pragmatist influences on QBism section 4 sketches a variety of\nself-described pragmatist approaches to quantum theory, while section\n5 mentions some related views. \n\n\n\n\nQuantum Bayesianism originated as a point of view on states and\nprobabilities in quantum theory developed by C.M. Caves, C.A. Fuchs,\nand R. Schack (2002). In its more recent incarnation (Fuchs, Mermin,\n& Schack 2014) its proponents have adopted the name QBism for\nreasons discussed in\n §1.1.\n In deference to its contemporary proponents, this shorter\nname is used. Fuchs, Mermin, and Schack 2014 is an elementary introduction to\nQBism; Fuchs and Schack 2015 gives a more detailed summary of the\nview; von Baeyer 2016 is a popular book-length introduction. \nQBists maintain that rather than (either directly or indirectly)\nrepresenting a physical system, a quantum state represents the\nepistemic state of the one who assigns it concerning that\nagent’s possible future experiences. It does this by specifying\nthe agent’s coherent degree of belief (credence) in each of a\nvariety of alternative experiences that may result from a specific act\nthe agent may perform. To get an idea of the kinds of experience and\nact the QBist has in mind it is helpful to think of the possible\noutcomes of a quantum measurement on a physical system. But QBists\nhave proposed the extension of the view to encompass every\nexperience that may result from any action (Fuchs, Mermin,\nand Schack 2014; Mermin 2017). \nAs quantum theory is usually presented, the Born Rule provides an\nalgorithm for generating probabilities for alternative outcomes of a\nmeasurement of one or more observables on a quantum system. These\nprobabilities have traditionally been regarded as objective, in line\nwith the idea that the theory is irreducibly indeterministic. \nBy contrast, QBists hold a subjective Bayesian or personalist view of\nquantum probabilities (see entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n Taking a quantum state merely to provide input to the Born Rule\nspecifying these probabilities, they regard quantum state assignments\nas equally subjective. The quantum state assigned by an agent then\nprovides a convenient representation of an important part of his or\nher own overall state of belief. So quantum theory as a whole is\n“a users’ manual that any agent can pick up and use to\nhelp make wiser decisions in this world of inherent uncertainty”\n(Fuchs 2010, 8, Other Internet Resources). \nQBists argue that from this point of view quantum theory faces no\nconceptual problems associated with measurement or non-locality. While\nQBism has implications for the nature of physical science, from this\npoint of view quantum theory has few if any direct\nimplications for the nature of physical reality. \nContemporary QBists (Mermin 2014: 422; Fuchs 2011) have sought\nprecedents among such authorities as Erwin Schrödinger, Niels\nBohr, Wolfgang Pauli, J.A. Wheeler, and William James. But what came\nto be known as quantum Bayesianism and later QBism began as a\ncollaboration between Caves, Fuchs, and Schack at the turn of the\n21st century (Caves, Fuchs, and Schack 2002a,b). N. David\nMermin (2014) became a convert more recently and has proposed\nextending the QBist vision of science to resolve at least one\nlong-standing conceptual issue raised by classical physics. \nIn conformity with standard terminology, on which the word\n“Bayesian” does not carry a commitment to denying\nobjective probability, proponents of QBism no longer take the\n“B” to refer simply to Bayesianism. Insisting that\nprobability has no physical existence even in a quantum world, they\nfollow Bruno de Finetti in identifying probability with coherent\ndegree of belief or credence. But according to Fuchs (2016, Other\nInternet Resources) “B” should not be taken to abbreviate\n“Brunism” since de Finetti would not have accepted all of\nQBism’s metaphysics: so “QBism” is now best\nunderstood simply as a stand-alone proper name for the view of quantum\ntheory described in what follows. \nApplied to radioactive decay, the Born Rule of quantum theory is taken\nsuccessfully to predict such things as the half-life of the first\nexcited state of the hydrogen atom—that the probability that an\natom of hydrogen in this state will be found to have decayed to the\nground state after \\(1.1 \\times 10^{-9}\\) seconds (i.e., just over a\nbillionth of a second) is ½. This prediction has been\nexperimentally confirmed by measuring how the frequency with which\nphotons are emitted by a large number of hydrogen atoms in the decay\nof this excited state decreases over time. Most physicists regard this\nand other probabilities predicted by quantum theory as objective\nphysical features of the world, typically identifying the probability\nof decay with the relative frequency of decay as measured in such an\nexperiment. \nBut there are strong reasons not to equate probability with any actual\nrelative frequency (see entry\n interpretations of probability, §3.4).\n Many philosophers, including Karl Popper (1967) and David Lewis\n(1986), have taken Born probabilities instead to exemplify a\ndistinctive kind of objective property (propensity or chance,\nrespectively) that may be ascribed to actual or possible individual\nevents. Lewis took quantum indeterminism to be the last hold-out of\nobjective chance. \nBy contrast, QBists adopt a subjectivist or personalist interpretation\nof probability, in quantum theory as elsewhere (see entry on\n interpretations of probability, §3.3).\n This makes the Born Rule of quantum theory not a law of nature but an\nempirically motivated norm of rationality a wise agent should follow\nin addition to those whose violation would render the agent’s\ndegrees of belief incoherent. As usually formulated, the Born Rule\nspecifies probabilities for various possible measurement outcomes\ngiven a quantum state: But QBists also adopt a subjectivist or\npersonalist interpretation of quantum states. \nThe Schrödinger equation specifying the time development of a\nsystem’s quantum state \\(\\psi\\) \nis often thought of as the basic dynamical law of quantum mechanics,\nwhere \\(H\\) (called the Hamiltonian operator) is said to represent the\nsystem’s energy. Instead QBists take this equation as providing\na diachronic constraint on an agent’s credences, conformity to\nwhich is required of a quantum user in the absence of new experience\nsuch as that provided by awareness of the outcome of a measurement on\nthe system. But QBists also consider the Hamiltonian (along with all\nother observables) within the purview of each individual agent rather\nthan objectively determined by the system’s properties. It\nfollows that equally rational agents assigning the same initial\nquantum state may come to differ in their subsequent state assignments\nbecause they apply the diachronic constraint supplied by the\nSchrödinger equation in different ways. \nIn its usual formulation the Born Rule does not look like a normative\nconstraint on credences. QBists prefer to reformulate it purely as a\nrelation among (subjective) probabilities without reference to a\nquantum state. In the form of Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) it relates\nprobabilities \\(q\\) of actual measurement outcomes \\(j\\) to\nprobabilities of outcomes of a hypothetical fiducial\nmeasurement of a special kind called a\n SIC.[2] \nThis equation is not just a revision of the law of total probability\nit resembles, i.e., \nbecause \\(p(i)\\), \\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\) in \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) refer to a\nhypothetical measurement, not the actual measurement. \nIn more detail, suppose an agent has degrees of belief \\(p(i)\\) that\nthe outcome of a SIC on a system would be the \\(i\\)th, and\ndegree of belief \\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\) in the \\(j\\)th\noutcome of an actual measurement \\(M\\) conditional on the\n\\(i\\)th outcome for the hypothetical SIC on that system.\nThen QBists take Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), stating a condition on the\nagent’s degree of belief \\(q(j)\\) that the outcome of \\(M\\) will\nbe the \\(j\\)th, as their preferred formulation of the Born\nRule. In this expression \\(d\\) stands for the dimension of the\nsystem’s Hilbert space (assumed to be a positive integer). \nTheir idea is that when the fiducial measurement is a SIC,\n\\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\) encodes the agent’s belief about the type\nof measurement \\(M\\), while \\(p(i)\\) encodes his or her quantum state\nfor the system on which this measurement is performed. They maintain\nthat the Born Rule in this form is an empirically motivated addition\nto probability theory—a normative requirement of quantum\nBayesian coherence (Fuchs and Schack 2013) that supplements the usual\ncoherence conditions on degrees of belief required to avoid a Dutch\nbook (a set of bets an agent is guaranteed to lose, come what\nmay). \nIt is common (at least in physical applications) to identify\nprobability 1 with objective certainty, at least for finite\nprobability spaces. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (1935, EPR) made\nthis identification in the following sufficient condition for reality\nwith which they premised their famous argument for the incompleteness\nof quantum mechanical description of physical reality: \nIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with\ncertainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a\nphysical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality\ncorresponding to this physical quantity. (EPR: 777) \nQBists (Caves, Fuchs, and Schack 2007) reject this identification and\nrefute EPR’s argument that quantum description is incomplete by\ndenying this premise. Eschewing all objective physical probabilities,\nthey rather identify probability 1 with an agent’s subjective\ncertainty—full belief in a statement or event that an equally\nwell informed rational agent may believe to a lesser degree, or not at\nall. \nThose who believe that a quantum state completely describes the system\nto which it is assigned and that this state always evolves linearly\n(e.g., according to the Schrödinger equation) face the notorious\nquantum measurement problem: Application of quantum theory to the\ninteraction between a quantum system and a quantum measuring device\nwould almost always leave these in a state that describes the\nmeasurement as having no outcome, contrary to the direct experience of\ncountless experimentalists (see entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory, §4). \nSome have followed Dirac (1930) and von Neumann (1932) in assuming\nthat a measurement is a physical process in which a quantum state\nalmost never evolves linearly but rather changes discontinuously and\nstochastically into one of a variety of possible states, each of which\nmay describe its outcome. But attempts to state precisely when such a\nprocess occurs and to verify its occurrence experimentally have been\nunsuccessful, and many understand quantum theory as excluding its\noccurrence. \nQBists avoid this problem by denying that a quantum state (even\nincompletely) describes the system to which it assigned. Any user of\nquantum theory assigns his or her personal quantum state on the basis\nof available information, subject only to the normative constraints of\nquantum Bayesian coherence. This state assignment need conform neither\nto “the way that system really is”, nor to the state\nassignments of other users. Quantum mechanics is a single user theory,\nand any coincidence among states assigned by different users is just\nthat—coincidence. An agent may reassign a state on the basis of\nnewly acquired information, perhaps described as observation of the\noutcome of a measurement. When this happens, the new state is often\nnot continuous with the old state. This represents no physical\ndiscontinuity associated with measurement, but merely reflects the\nagent’s updated epistemic state in the light of experience. \nNevertheless, in certain circumstances different users may be expected\nto come to assign similar or even identical quantum states by updating\ntheir prior credences to take account of common (though never\nidentical) experiences, some of which each may describe as experiences\nof the outcomes of quantum measurements on systems. Because QBists\ntake the quantum state to have the role of representing an\nagent’s epistemic state they may avail themselves of personalist\nBayesian arguments purporting to show the convergence of priors on\nupdating in the light of common information. Also, just as de Finetti\nshowed that a subjectivist agent’s credences may evolve as if\nrefining estimates of an unknown objective probability, QBists (Caves,\nFuchs, and Schack 2002b) have shown that the credences of a user of\nquantum theory may evolve as if refining his or her assignment of an\nunknown objective quantum state. \nJ.S. Bell (2004) argued forcefully that the word\n“measurement” has no place in a formulation of quantum\nmechanics with any pretension to physical precision. QBists frequently\nuse this word in formulating their view, but unlike Bohr and his\nCopenhagen followers they do not think of a measurement as a purely\nphysical process, but as describing an agent’s action on the\nworld that results in a specific experience of it. They view quantum\ntheory not as offering descriptions of the world involving the\nimprecise physical term “measurement”, but as an\nintellectual tool for helping its users interact with the world to\npredict, control, and understand their experiences of it. Fuchs (2010,\nOther Internet Resources) and Mermin (2017) are quite explicit and\nunapologetic that a thoroughgoing QBist presentation of quantum theory\nwould speak of agents, their actions and their experiences—all\nprimitive terms they take neither to require nor to admit of precise\nphysical specification. \nBell’s arguments (2004) have convinced some physicists and many\nphilosophers that certain patterns of correlation among spatially\nseparated events correctly predicted by quantum theory manifest\nnon-local influences between some of these events (see entry on\n action at a distance in quantum mechanics).\n QBists use their view of measurement-as-experience to reject any such\nnon-local influences. \nFor a QBist, what science rests on are not objective reports of\nlocalized physical events but the individual agent’s\nexperiences. Being present at a single location, at no time does an\nindividual agent experience spatially separated\n events.[3]\n Correlations taken to manifest non-local influences supposedly\nconcern events in different places—say where Alice is and where\nBob is. But Alice can only experience events where she is, not at\nBob’s distant location. When she hears Bob’s report of\nwhat he experienced at a distant location, this is an experience she\nhas where she is, not where Bob reports having had his\nexperience. So quantum theory is answerable to patterns of correlation\nnot among spatially separated physical events, but among Alice’s\n(as also among Bob’s) spatially coincident experiences. QBists\nargue that Alice, Bob, and any other agent can use quantum theory\nsuccessfully to account for her or his experiences with no appeal to\nany physical states (hidden or otherwise) or non-local physical\ninfluences.  \nClassical mechanics is generally taken to be reducible to quantum\nmechanics, at least approximately in some appropriate limit. For\nexample, Newton’s second law of motion is sometimes said to be\nderivable from the Schrödinger equation in the limit of large\nmass. But to retrieve classical dynamics it is generally thought\nnecessary to supplement any such derivation with an account of why\nordinary macroscopic objects do not exhibit the interference behavior\ncharacteristic of quantum superpositions. \nQuantum models of environmental decoherence are commonly thought to\nprovide such an account (see entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics).\n These typically involve the Schrödinger equation, this time\napplied to a system in interaction with its quantum environment. The\napplication can show how interactions entangle the quantum states of\nsystem and environment in a way that selects a “pointer\nbasis” in which the system’s reduced (mixed) state remains\nvery nearly diagonal indefinitely. Somehow a particular element of\nthis basis is supposed to be identifiable as the system’s\nphysical state, evolving in a way that approximates classical\ndynamics. \nIf the Schrödinger equation were a dynamical law governing the\nevolution of a physical quantum state this would provide a physical\nfoundation on which to base a reduction of classical dynamics to\nquantum dynamics that appealed to quantum decoherence. But QBists\ndeny that the Schrödinger equation is a dynamical law\ngoverning the evolution of an objective quantum state. For them it\nmerely provides a diachronic constraint on an agent’s epistemic\nstate. Fuchs (2010, Other Internet Resources) concluded that\ndecoherence has no role to play in the misguided program attempting to\nreduce classical to quantum dynamics. \nInstead, QBists Fuchs and Schack (2012) have viewed decoherence as a\ncondition on an agent’s present assignment of a quantum state to\na system following one contemplated measurement, when making decisions\nregarding the possible outcomes of a second measurement. As such, it\nfunctions as a normative synchronic coherence condition that may be\nseen as a consequence of van Fraassen’s (1984) Reflection\nPrinciple. Instead of taking decoherence to select possible outcomes\nof a physical measurement process, QBists take these to be just\nwhatever experiences may follow the agent’s action on the\nworld. \nMermin (2014) has proposed extending QBism’s view of the role\nexperience in science to what he calls CBism (Classical Bohrism).\nAccording to Carnap, Einstein was seriously worried about the problem\nof the Now \nthat the experience of the Now means something special for man,\nsomething essentially different from the past and the future, but that\nthis important difference does not and cannot occur within physics.\n(Carnap 1963: 37–38) \nAccording to Mermin, Einstein had nothing to worry about because there\n\\(is\\) a place in physics for the present moment. He takes the present\nmoment as something that is immediately experienced by each of us, and\nso (from a CBist perspective) just the sort of thing that physics is\nultimately about. By contrast, he says \nspace-time is an abstraction that I construct to organize such\nexperiences. (Mermin 2014: 422–3)  \nAccording to Mermin, a common Now is an inference for each person from\nhis or her immediate experience: But that it is as fundamental a\nfeature of two perceiving subjects that when two people are together\nat an event, if the event is Now for one of them, then it is Now for\nboth. \nUnlike QBism, CBism is not a subjective or personalist view of states\nand probabilities in physics. But both QBism and CBism depend on a\ngeneral view of science as an individual quest to organize one’s\npast experiences and to anticipate one’s future experiences.\nThis is a view that has antecedents even in views expressed by\nphysicists generally thought of as realists, such as Einstein (1949:\n673–4) and Bell, whom Mermin (2017: 83)\nquotes as follows \nI think we invent concepts, like “particle” or\n“Professor Peierls”, to make the immediate sense of data\nmore intelligible. (J.S. Bell, letter to R.E. Peierls,\n24-February-1983)  \nA common reaction among those first hearing about QBism is to dismiss\nit as a form of solipsism. Mermin (2017) replies as follows: \nFacile charges of solipsism miss the point. My experience of you leads\nme to hypothesize that you are a being very much like myself, with\nyour own private experience. This is as firm a belief as any I have. I\ncould not function without it. If asked to assign this hypothesis a\nprobability I would choose \\(p = 1\\).0. Although I have no direct\npersonal access to your own experience, an important component of my\nprivate experience is the impact on me of your efforts to communicate,\nin speech or writing, your verbal representations of your own\nexperience. Science is a collaborative human effort to find, through\nour individual actions on the world and our verbal communications with\neach other, a model for what is common to all of our privately\nconstructed external worlds. Conversations, conferences, research\npapers, and books are an essential part of the scientific process. (84–85)\n \nIn his critical assessment of quantum Bayesianism, Timpson (2008)\noffers a more detailed defense against the charge of solipsism. \nBut even if one accepts the existence of other people and their\nexperiences, adopting QBism does seem severely to restrict one’s\napplication of quantum theory to anticipations of one’s own\nexperiences, with no implications for those of anyone else. \nBy portraying it as a tool for helping a user get by in an uncertain\nworld, QBism has been characterized as merely a form of\ninstrumentalism about quantum theory. But this is no reason to reject\nthe view absent arguments against such instrumentalism. \nInstrumentalism is usually contrasted with realism as a view of\nscience (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n The contrast is often taken to depend on opposing views of the\ncontent, aims, and epistemic reach of scientific theories. Crudely,\nthe realist takes theoretical statements to be either true or false of\nthe world, science to aim at theories that truly describe the world,\nand theories of mature science to have given us increasingly reliable\nand accurate knowledge even of things we can’t observe: While\nthe instrumentalist takes theoretical statements to be neither true\nnor false of the world, science to aim only at theories that\naccommodate and predict our observations, and theories even in mature\nscience to have given us increasingly reliable and accurate\npredictions only of things we can observe. \nQBism offers a more nuanced view, both of quantum theory as a theory\nand of science in general. Fuchs (2016, Other Internet Resources)\nadopted the slogan “participatory realism” for the view of\nscience he takes to emerge from QBism (if not also a variety of more\nor less related views of quantum theory). For QBism a quantum state\nassignment is true or false relative to the epistemic state of the\nagent assigning it, insofar as it corresponds to that agent’s\npartial beliefs concerning his or her future experiences (beliefs the\nagent should have adopted in accordance with the Born Rule). But what\nmakes this quantum state assignment true or false is not the physical\nworld independent of the agent. \nThe QBist does not take quantum theory truly to describe the world:\nbut (s)he does take that to be the aim of science—an\naim to which quantum theory contributes only indirectly. For\nexample, the Born Rule in the form of Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\). \nis less agent-specific than any probability assignments themselves.\nIt’s a rule that any agent should pick up and use…. it\nlives at the level of the impersonal. And because of that, the Born\nRule correlates with something that one might want to call real.\n(Fuchs 2016, 6, Other Internet Resources) \nFuchs thinks one thing quantum theory has taught us about the world is\nthat it is much richer than we may have thought: as agents using\nquantum theory to make wise decisions we are not just placing bets on\nan unknown but timelessly existing future but actively\ncreating that future reality: “reality is more than any\nthird-person perspective can capture”. That is the sense in\nwhich he takes QBism to support a strong participatory realism, about\nthe world in and on which we act and about how science should describe\nit. \nBy contrast, Mermin (2017) draws related but possibly less radical\nconclusions about science that (perhaps contrary to his intentions)\nsome might interpret as instrumentalist: \n…science is a user’s manual. Its purpose is to help each\nof us make sense of our private experience induced in us by the world\noutside of us. \nScience is about the interface between the experience of any\nparticular person and the subset of the world that is external to that\nparticular user. (88) \nRealists often appeal to scientific explanation when arguing against\ninstrumentalists. Quantum theory is generally acknowledged to provide\nus with a wide variety of successful explanations of phenomena we\ncan’t explain without it. Timpson objects that QBists cannot\naccount for its explanatory success. \n… think of the question of why some solids conduct and some\ninsulate; why yet others are in between, while they all contain\nelectrons, sometimes in quite similar densities…. Ultimately we\nare not interested in agents’ expectation that matter structured\nlike sodium would conduct; we are interested in why it in fact\ndoes so. (Timpson 2008: 600) \nQBists face two problems here. In their view a user of quantum theory\ncan’t appeal to a description of objective, physical quantum\nstates in explaining the phenomena; and quantum theory’s Born\nrule outputs subjective probabilities for each user independently that\nbear not on what is objectively likely to happen but only on what\n(s)he should expect to experience, given her prior beliefs and\nexperiences. \nFuchs and Schack (2015) reply that explanations offered by quantum\ntheory have a similar character to explanations offered by probability\ntheory and give examples. This does not address the first problem. But\nQBists could rationalize biting that bullet by pointing to\nlong-standing problems of measurement and non-locality faced by\ninterpretations that take quantum states to be physically real that\ndon’t arise in their view. To respond to the second problem they\ncould try to develop a subjectivist view of scientific explanation as\nultimately a matter of making an economical and effective unity out of\nall an agent’s beliefs and expectations. \nBacciagaluppi (2014) has raised an objection against the claim that\nthe Born rule as formulated in Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) states an\nempirically motivated normative addition to Bayesian coherence\nconditions. His basic objection is that QBism assumes the probability\n\\(q(j)\\) of an actual measurement outcome (as also the probability\n\\(p(j)\\) of a hypothetical measurement outcome) is independent of the\nprocedure by which this measurement is performed. That this is so\nfollows from the usual formulation of the Born Rule relating Born\nprobabilities of measurement outcomes to quantum state assignments.\nBut QBism cannot justify the procedure-independence of \\(q(j)\\) and\n\\(p(j)\\) in this way because it considers the Born Rule in the form of\nEquation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) to be primitive, and so incapable of\nempirical support from the relation between quantum states and\noutcomes of laboratory procedures. \nThere are also technical problems with Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), which\nassumes the existence of SICs in the relevant Hilbert space. But\ninfinite as well as finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are used in\nquantum theory, and SICs have not (yet) been shown to exist in every\nfinite\n dimension.[4]\n Informationally-complete (but not necessarily symmetric) POVMs do\nexist in all finite dimensional spaces. Fuchs and Schack (2015) give a\nschematic alternative to Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) that does not\nrequire symmetry of an informationally-complete POVM representing a\nhypothetical fiducial measurement. \nThe QBist approach to quantum theory is often criticized as too\nsubjective in its treatment of quantum states, measurement outcomes,\nand probabilities. \nMany people assume a wave-function or state vector represents a\nphysical quantum state. On this assumption a quantum state is\nontic—a fundamental element of reality obeying the quantum\ndynamics that underlies classical dynamical laws. Bacciagaluppi (2014)\nurges QBists to accept this approach to dynamics even while\nmaintaining a subjectivist or pragmatist interpretation of\nprobability. But doing so would undercut the QBist account of\ndiscontinuous change of quantum state on measurement as simply\ncorresponding to epistemic updating. \nMost people take it for granted that a competently performed quantum\nmeasurement procedure has a unique, objective outcome. But QBists deny\nthis, assimilating a measurement outcome to an individual\nagent’s personal experience—including her experience of\nanother agent’s verbal report of his outcome. By rejecting the\nobjective authority of observation reports QBists challenge what many\nhave considered a presupposition of the scientific method. This\nrejection also threatens to undercut the standard personalist argument\n(see entry on\n Bayesian epistemology, §6.2.F)\n that the opinions of agents with very different prior degrees of\nbelief will converge after they have accumulated sufficient common\nevidence. \nQBists consider a subjective view of quantum probability a core\ncommitment of the view, even when that probability is 1. But Stairs\n(2011) and others have argued that QBist strategies for resolving\nconceptual problems associated with non-locality may be co-opted by a\nqualified objectivist about quantum probabilities. \nQBists identify probability 1 with an individual agent’s\nsubjective certainty, in contrast to the objective certainty EPR took\nto entail the existence of a physical quantity whose value could be\npredicted with probability 1. Stairs (2011) referred to developments\nof David Lewis’s (1986: Appendix C) best systems analysis as\noffering an alternative notion of objective probability in which this\nentailment fails (see entry on\n interpretations of probability, §3.6).\n Adopting this alternative blocks the inference to an element of\nreality (or beable, to use Bell’s term) grounding the objective\ncertainty of Bob’s distant measurement outcome on his component\nof a non-separable system following Alice’s measurement on her\ncomponent, thereby undercutting Bell’s proof that quantum theory\nis not locally causal. \nMost QBists are physicists rather than philosophers. But Fuchs locates\nQBism in the tradition of classical American pragmatism (see entry on\n pragmatism).\n While quoting Peirce and referring to Dewey, Fuchs (2011; 2016, Other\nInternet Resources)\nacknowledges especially the influence of William James’s ideas\nof pure experience and an open and pluralistic universe in which\n“new being comes in local spots and patches which add themselves\nor stay away at random, independently of the rest” (2016, 9,\nOther Internet Resources).\nMermin’s CBist introduction of the “Now” into\nphysics and Fuchs’s choice of title for his 2014 (Other Internet\nResources) both show\naffinity with James’s reaction against what he called the\nblock-universe (see entry\n being and becoming in modern physics).\n Moreover, they both credit the influence on QBism of Niels Bohr. Bohr\nhimself never acknowledged pragmatist influences on his view of\nquantum theory. But in a late interview[5] he expressed enthusiasm\nfor James’s conception of consciousness, and he was almost\ncertainly acquainted with some of James’s ideas by the Danish\nphilosopher Høffding, a friend and admirer of James. \nPragmatists agree with QBists that quantum theory should not be\nthought to offer a description or representation of physical reality:\nin particular, to ascribe a quantum state is not to describe physical\nreality. But they deny that this makes the theory in any way\nsubjective. It is objective not because it faithfully mirrors the\nphysical world, but because every individual’s use of the theory\nis subject to objective standards supported by the common knowledge\nand goals of the scientific community. So an individual’s\nassignment of a quantum state may be correct (or incorrect) even\nthough no quantum state is an element of physical reality; Born\nprobabilities are similarly objective; and measurement is a physical\nprocess with a unique objective outcome, albeit\nepistemically-characterized. \nIn attempting to clarify the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum\ntheory, Stapp called it pragmatic and used James’s views on\ntruth and experience to provide an appropriate philosophical\nbackground for the Copenhagen interpretation “which is\nfundamentally a shift to a philosophic perspective resembling that of\nWilliam James” (1972: 1105). \nThe significance of this viewpoint for science is its negation of the\nidea that the aim of science is to construct a mental or mathematical\nimage of the world itself. According to the pragmatic view, the proper\ngoal of science is to augment and order our experience. (Stapp 1972:\n1104) \nHe follows Bohr (1958), Landau and Lifshitz (1977), and others in\ninsisting on the objective character of quantum measurements, taking\n“our experience” not as individual and subjective but as\nconstituted by physical events, on whose correct description in the\neveryday language of the laboratory we can (and must) all agree if\nphysical science is to continue its progress. \nBächtold (2008a,b) takes an approach to quantum theory he calls\npragmatist. Quoting C.S. Peirce’s pragmatic maxim, he offers\nwhat he calls pragmatic definitions of terms used by researchers in\nmicrophysics, including “preparation”,\n“measurement”, “observable”, and\n“microscopic system”. His “pragmatist”\napproach to interpreting a theory is to isolate the pragmatic\nfunctions to be fulfilled by successful research activity in\nmicrophysics, and then to show that quantum theory alone fulfills\nthese functions. \nWhile acknowledging that his interpretation has an instrumentalist\nflavor, in his 2008a he distinguishes it from the instrumentalism of\nPeres (1995) and others, who all (allegedly) claim some metaphysical\nideas but seek to remove the expression “microscopic\nsystem” from the vocabulary used by quantum physicists. By\ncontrast, his “pragmatic definition” of that expression\nlicenses this usage, taking “quantum system” to refer to a\nspecified set of preparations. \nBächtold (2008b: chapter 2) elaborates on his pragmatist\nconception of knowledge, appealing to a variety of philosophical\nprogenitors, including Peirce, James, Carnap, Wittgenstein, Putnam,\nand Kant. But his overall approach to quantum theory has strong\naffinities with operationalist approaches to the theory. \nIn recent work, Healey (2012, forthcoming a,b) has also taken what he\ncalls a pragmatist approach to quantum theory. He contrasts this with\ninterpretations that attempt to say what the world would (or could) be\nlike if quantum theory were true of it. On his approach quantum states\nare objective, though a true quantum state assignment does not\ndescribe or represent the condition or behavior of a physical system.\nBut quantum states are relational: Different agents may correctly and\nconsistently assign different quantum states to the same system in the\nsame circumstances—not because these represent their subjective\npersonal beliefs but because each agent has access to different\nobjective information backing these (superficially conflicting) state\nassignments. Each such assignment correctly represents objective\nprobabilistic relations between its backing conditions and claims\nabout values of magnitudes. \nOn this approach, quantum theory is not about agents or their states\nof belief: and nor does it (directly) describe the physical world. It\nis a source of objectively good advice about how to describe\nthe world and what to believe about it as so described. This advice is\ntailored to meet the needs of physically situated, and hence\ninformationally-deprived, agents like us. It is good because the\nphysical world manifests regular statistical patterns the right Born\nprobabilities help a situated agent to track. But the advice is\navailable even with no agents in a position to benefit from it: there\nare quantum states and Born probabilities in possible worlds with no\nagents. \nBorn probabilities are neither credences nor frequencies. They are\nobjective because they are authoritative. Setting credences equal to\nBorn probabilities derived from the correct quantum state for one in\nthat physical situation is a wise epistemic policy for any agent in a\nworld like ours. Born probabilities are equally objective even when\nthey differ more radically from Lewis’s (1986) chances because\nthey are based on more (physically) limited information. \nHealey’s approach is pragmatist in several respects. It\nprioritizes use over representation in its general approach to quantum\ntheory; its account of probability and causation is pragmatist, in\nquantum theory and elsewhere; and it rests on a theory of content that\nBrandom (2000) calls pragmatist inferentialism. While not endorsing\nany pragmatist identification of truth with “what works”,\nin its minimalism about truth and representation it follows the\ncontemporary pragmatist Huw Price (2003, 2011). \nIndependently of similar suggestions by Bacciagaluppi (2014) and\nStairs (2011), Healey co-opts some QBist strategies for dissolving the\nmeasurement problem and removing worries about non-locality, while\nrejecting the accompanying subjectivism about quantum states, Born\nprobabilities, and measurement outcomes. \nWhile QBists take quantum state assignments to be subject only to the\ndemand that an agent’s degrees of belief be coherent and conform\nto Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), Healey takes these to be answerable to\nthe statistics of objective events, including (but not restricted to)\noutcomes of quantum measurements. This makes the objective existence\nof quantum states independent of that of agents even though their main\nfunction is as a source of good advice to any agents there happen to\nbe. And it makes quantum states relative, not to the epistemic\nsituation of actual agents, but to the physical situation of actual\nand merely hypothetical agents. \nWhile QBists follow de Finetti in taking all probabilities to be\ncredences of actual agents, Healey’s pragmatist takes\nprobabilities to exist independently of the existence of agents but\nnot to be physical propensities or frequencies, nor even to supervene\non Lewis’s Humean mosaic (see entry on\n David Lewis §5).\n There are probabilities insofar as probability statements are\nobjectively true, which they may be when sensitive to though not\ndetermined by physical facts. \nThere is no measurement problem since reassignment of quantum state on\nmeasurement is not a physical process but corresponds to\nrelativization of that state to a different physical situation from\nwhich additional information has become physically accessible to a\nhypothetical agent so situated. \nThere is no instantaneous action at a distance in a quantum world,\ndespite the probabilistic counterfactual dependencies between\nspace-like separated events such as (macroscopic) outcomes of\nmeasurements confirming violation of Bell inequalities. On a\npragmatist approach, these dependencies admit no conceptual\npossibility of intervention on one outcome that would alter (any\nrelevant probability of) the other. So there is no instantaneous\nnon-local influence, in conformity to Einstein’s principle of\nlocal action. \nOn Healey’s pragmatist approach, an application of the Born rule\ndirectly specifies probabilities for claims about the values of\nphysical magnitudes (dynamical variables of classical physics as well\nas new variables such as strangeness and color): it does not\nexplicitly specify probabilities for measurement outcomes. But the\nBorn rule is legitimately applied only to claims with sufficiently\nwell-defined content. The content of a claim about the value of a\nphysical magnitude on a system depends on how the system interacts\nwith its environment. Quantum theory may be used to model such\ninteraction. Only if a system’s quantum state is then stably\ndecohered in some basis (see entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics)\n do claims about the value of the associated “pointer\nmagnitude” acquire a sufficiently well-defined content to\nlicense application of the Born rule to them. Because of this\nrestriction on its legitimate application, the Born rule may be\nconsistently applied to claims of this form (not just to claims about\nthe outcomes of measurements) without running afoul of no-go results\nsuch as that of Kochen and Specker (see entry on\n the Kochen-Specker theorem). \nWhat endows a claim (e.g., about the value of a magnitude) with\ncontent is the web of inferences in which it is located. Such a claim\nhas a well-defined content if many reliable inferences link it to\nother claims with well-defined content. It is the nature of a\nsystem’s interaction with its environment that determines which\ninferences to and from a magnitude claim about it are reliable.\nQuantum decoherence and pragmatist inferentialism work together here\nto make objective sense of the Born rule with no need to mention\nmeasurement: Though of course at some stage all actual measurements do\ninvolve interactions with an environment well modeled by quantum\ndecoherence. \nContra to Mermin’s view (see\n §1.6),\n concepts are not invented by each of us to make his or her experience\nmore intelligible. They acquire content from the social practice of\nlinguistic communication about a physical world that perception\nrepresents (to humans as well as organisms with no capacity for\nlanguage) as independently existing. \nThe view that a quantum state describes physical reality is often\ncalled \\(\\psi\\)-ontic, by contrast with a \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic view that\nit represents an agent’s incomplete information about an\nunderlying ontic state (Harrigan and Speckens 2010). QBists and\npragmatists are not the only ones to adopt a view that is neither\n\\(\\psi\\)-ontic nor \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic in these senses. Other views\nshare the pragmatist thought that quantum states aren’t a\nfunction of any agent’s actual epistemic state because quantum\nstate assignments are required to conform to objective standards of\ncorrectness. This section covers two such views. \nFriederich (2011, 2015) favors what he calls a therapeutic approach to\ninterpreting quantum theory, taking his cue from the later philosophy\nof Ludwig Wittgenstein. This approach grounds the objectivity of\nquantum state assignments in the implicit constitutive rules governing\nthis practice. Those rules determine the state an agent has to assign\ndepending on her knowledge of the values of observables, perhaps\nobtained by consulting the outcome of their measurement on the system.\nFriederich agrees with Healey that differently situated agents may\ntherefore have to assign different states to the same system in the\nsame circumstances insofar as their situations permit some to consult\noutcomes inaccessible to others, and makes the point by saying a\nsystem is not \\(in\\) whichever quantum state it is assigned. \nFriederich treats quantum probabilities as rational quasi-Lewisian\nconstraints on credence and, together with his relational account of\nquantum states, this enables him to refute the claim that Bell’s\ntheorem demonstrates instantaneous action at a distance. He uses (what\nhe calls) his epistemic conception of quantum states to dissolve the\nmeasurement problem by denying that an entangled superposition of\nsystem and apparatus quantum states is incompatible with the\noccurrence of a definite, unique outcome. Like Healey, he appeals to\ndecoherence in picking out the particular observable(s) a suitable\ninteraction may be considered to measure. \nSo far Friederich’s therapeutic approach parallels\nHealey’s pragmatist approach (though there are significant\ndifferences of detail, especially as regards their treatments of\nprobability and causation). But Friederich rejects Healey’s\ninferentialist account of the content of claims about the values of\nphysical magnitudes, taking restrictions on legitimate applications of\nthe Born Rule to follow directly from the constitutive rules governing\nits use rather than from the need to apply it only to magnitude claims\nwith well-defined content. And Friederich seriously explores the\npossibility that a set of magnitude claims collectively assigning a\nprecise value to all dynamical variables may be not only\nmeaningful but true together. His idea is that the constitutive rules\ngoverning the Born Rule may forbid any attempt to apply the rule in a\nway that would imply the existence of a non-contextual probability\ndistribution over their possible values, thus avoiding conflict with\nno-go theorems like that of Kochen and Specker. \nBrukner and Zeilinger (2003; Zeilinger 2005; Brukner 2017) follow\nSchrödinger (1935) and many others in viewing a quantum state as\na catalogue of our knowledge about a system. Their view is not\n\\(\\psi\\)-epistemic because it denies that the system has an\nontic state about which we may learn by observing it. Instead, a\nsystem is characterized by its information content. An elementary\nsystem contains information sufficient to answer one question. For a\nspin ½ system, a question about spin component in any direction\nmay be answered by a suitable observation. But the answer cannot\ntypically be understood as revealing the pre-existing value of\nspin-component in that direction, and answering this question by\nobservation randomizes the answer to any future question about\nspin-component in different directions. So the catalog of knowledge\ntakes the form of a probability distribution over possible answers to\nall meaningful question about a quantum system that contains only one\nentry with probability 1 that might be considered a property that\nwould be revealed if observed. \nBrukner (2017) has recently used an extension of Wigner’s friend paradox (Wigner 1962) to argue that even the answers to such questions given by observation cannot be regarded as reflecting objective properties of the devices\nsupposedly recording them. If sound, this argument provides a reason\nto modify this view of quantum states to make it closer to that of\nQBists. \nA variety of QBist and pragmatist views of quantum theory have been\nproposed since quantum theory assumed close to its present form. In\nrecent years this has been an active area of research especially by\nphilosophically aware physicists working in quantum foundations.\nPhilosophers have tended to dismiss such approaches, objecting to\ntheir instrumentalism and/or anti-realism. But there is much to learn\nfrom responses to such objections and good philosophical\nreasons to take these views more seriously.","contact.mail":"rhealey@U.arizona.edu","contact.domain":"U.arizona.edu"}]
