For example, color is a\ndeterminable having red, blue, and other specific\nshades of color as determinates; shape is a determinable\nhaving rectangular, oval, and other specific\n(including many irregular) shapes as determinates; mass is a\ndeterminable having specific mass values as determinates. Reflecting\nthat determinables admit of different degrees or levels of\nspecification, characterization of a property as determinable or\ndeterminate is typically relative; for example, red is a\ndeterminate of color and a determinable of\nscarlet.\n\n\nThe determination relation appears to differ from other specification\nrelations. In contrast with the genus-species and conjunct-conjunction\nrelations, where the more specific property can be understood as a\nconjunction of the less specific property and some independent\nproperty or properties, a determinate is not naturally treated in\nconjunctive terms (red is not a conjunctive property\nhaving color and some other property or properties as\nconjuncts); and in contrast with the disjunction-disjunct relation,\nwhere disjuncts may be dissimilar and compatible (as with\nred or round), determinates of a determinable (at a given\nlevel of specificity) are both similar and incompatible (red\nand blue are similar in both being colors; nothing can be\nsimultaneously and uniformly both red and blue).\nSupporting this latter contrast is that our thoughts about\ndeterminables do not appear to be about (potentially infinite)\ndisjunctions of determinates, and our perceptions of properties such\nas color and shape do not appear to be of maximal\ndeterminates, as would be the case if determinables were disjunctions\nof determinates (since every instance of a disjunction is an instance\nof a disjunct).\n\n\nOf course, appearances can be deceiving, and there are strategies for\ntreating determinables and their mode of\nspecification in deflationary terms. Whether these strategies succeed\nor fail is no small issue. For the seemingly distinctive character of\ndeterminables and determination may enter into the best case for the\nclaim that there are genuine features of reality that are less than\nmaximally specific—a claim which, if true, has profound\nimplications for a wide range of philosophical issues.\n\n\nWhat follows is organized into five sections. In §1, we trace key\npoints of the historical trajectory whereby determination came to be\nseen as a distinctive form of specification. In §2, we present the\ncommonly advanced features of determinables, determinates, and their\nrelation; here also we discuss extensions of the (realistically\nconstrued) relation to ontological categories beyond properties. In\n§3, we sketch the main anti-realist, reductionist, and\nnon-reductionist accounts of determinables and determinates, saying\nhow these aim to accommodate the seeming features of determinables and\ndeterminates, and flagging key concerns and responses; here also we\ndiscuss certain accounts of the structure or logic of determination.\nIn §4 we consider reasons for and against thinking that\ndeterminates are metaphysically prior to determinables. In §5 we\npresent three applications of these notions, on which the distinctive\nfeatures of determinables and/or determinates are seen as key to\nunderstanding physical laws of nature, mental/higher-level causation,\nand metaphysical indeterminacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following historical trajectory motivates the characteristic\nfeatures and certain treatments of determinables and determinates;\nthose interested in cutting to the contemporary chase can skip to\n§2 with little loss of continuity. \nThe terminology of determinables and determinates stems from ancient\nand scholastic treatment of the definition of a species, as analyzable\ninto two parts: a genus, or generic part of an essence—the\npars determinabilis essentiae, and the differentia, or\ndifferentiating part of an essence—the pars determinans\nessentiae. As we’ll see, the terminology and its original\napplication eventually went separate ways, with the genus-species\nrelation standardly being treated in conjunctive terms (with a given\nspecies being identified with the conjunction of a genus and one or\nmore differentia), and determination being treated as a distinctive\nnon-conjunctive specification\n relation.[1] \nSome recent commentators have suggested that the notion of\ndetermination has a precursor in ancient times. For example, one\ncommentator has proposed that Aristotle’s preferred treatment of\nthe relation between kinds and forms (a.k.a.  genus and species)\ninvolves key features of determination (Granger 1984). Granger\nsuggests that Aristotle’s conception of a form/species evolves\nfrom a conjunctive conception (as in Topics VI.3.\n140a27–29) to one on which differentia entail their associated\nkind/genus rather than conjunctively supplementing it. Granger\nmotivates the non-conjunctive conception on grounds that\n“Aristotle clearly maintains that [...] the genus does not exist\napart from its species, or exists merely as matter” (1984: 15);\nin turn, he takes this conception to indicate that  \ngenus and differentia are best viewed in terms of determinable and\ndeterminate. […] A determinate […] is not a conjunction\nof its determinable and something else logically distinct from its\ndeterminable. (1984: 19) \nSalmieri (2008) offers further support for this interpretation, citing\nanother important feature of determination—namely, that\ndeterminates differ specifically in respect of their determinable. As\nSalmieri puts it,  \nCertain things are not merely other than one another—as\nblue is other to both loud and\ninflation—but are different from or “opponent\nto” one another, as blue is different from\nred. (2008: 78)  \nAnd he sees this distinction as operative in Aristotle’s\n(Metaphysics I.3-4) remarks: \nBut difference (διαφορὰ)\nand otherness (ἐτερότης) are\ndistinct (ἄλλο). For, while the\nother and that which it is other than are not necessarily other in\nsomething (for everything that is some being is either other or the\nsame), the different differs from something in something, so that\nit’s necessary for there to be something the same in which they\ndiffer. This same thing is a kind or form; for every different thing\ndiffers either {i} in kind or {ii} in form [...]. (1054b22–31\ncf.  1018a9–15; translation quoted from Salmieri 2008, 79)  \nThe previous features—non-conjunctive entailment of the less by\nthe more specific, the specification’s being somehow “in\nrespect of” the less specific, and the more specific\nfeatures’ being opponent to one other—are indeed\ncharacteristic features of determination, contrasting with the\nconjunct-conjunction and disjunction-disjunct relations (modulo\ndeflationary strategies; we won’t always carry this qualification\nforward). As such, there is at least a case here for Salmieri’s\nclaim that “we ought to recognise Aristotle as the originator of\nthis distinction” (2008: 79). \nThroughout the scholastic and modern periods the genus-species and\ngenus-differentia relations are often treated in what Prior (1949)\ncalls “a confused blending” of the conjunct-conjunction\nand determination relations. In the modern period motivations for\ndistinguishing the latter relations become increasingly salient. \nOne motivation stems from Leibniz’s observation that a\nconjunctive treatment of the genus-species relation does not fix a\ndirection of specification, since one can as easily take the\ndifferentia to be the genus, as vice versa (see Nouveaux\nEssais, III, iii, 10, Langley’s translation, 313). Johnson\n(1924) interprets Descartes and Spinoza as attempting to ensure\nasymmetry by means of attributes and modes (see\nDescartes, Principles of Philosophy I.53;\nSpinoza, Ethics 1p8s1 and Ep. 50), which Johnson suggests are\n“almost equivalent” to the notions of determinable and\ndeterminate:  \nWhat I call a determinable is almost equivalent to what they call an\nattribute, and my determinate almost equivalent to their mode of an\nattribute. (1924: III, v. 1)  \nPrior (1949) similarly sees Spinoza as aiming to ensure asymmetry by\nmeans of something like determination: \nIf Leibniz brought consistency into the medieval view of the\ndistinctness of genus and differentia by making the relation between\nthem symmetrical, Spinoza brought consistency into the medieval view\nof the asymmetry of the relation between them by denying their\ndistinctness. Spinoza’s “modes” are not new\nqualities added to his “attributes”, or qualities formed\nby the addition of something else to them, but determinations of them.\n(1949: 7) \nPrior also sees Locke as relying on the distinctive incompatibility of\nsame-level determinates as making sense of why “any subject may\nhave of each sort of primary qualities but one particular at\nonce”, and similarly for “all sensible ideas peculiar to\neach sense” (Locke, Essay, IV iii 5). \nIn the work of Locke and other empiricists, we also see precursors of\ncertain contemporary anti-realist or reductivist accounts on which\ndeterminable attributions either indeterminately refer to determinate\nproperties (as Berkeley [1710] suggests, more generally, for\n‘abstract’ terms), or on which determinable attributions\nare (merely) ways of classifying determinates. Prior’s\ndescription of Locke’s view might be seen as compatible with\neither approach:  \nThough we speak of an object as colored, what is there being referred\nto is not really a quality of the object but a quality of one of its\nqualities; what is meant is that one of its qualities belongs to the\nclass “colors”. (Prior 1949: 8–9)  \nThe terminology of ‘determinables’ and\n‘determinates’ as indicative of a distinctive relation is\nfirst found in Volume I, Chapter XI—‘The\nDeterminable’—of W. E. Johnson’s Logic\n(1921): \nI propose to call such terms as color and shape\ndeterminables in relation to such terms as red and\ncircular which will be called determinates; and, in\nintroducing this new terminology, to examine the distinction between\nthe relation of red to color and the relation of\nPlato to man …. (1921: I, xi, 1) \nJohnson’s discussion is also the first systematic attempt to\ncharacterize the key features of determinables, determinates, and\ntheir relation (see esp. 1921: 173–185), though as below, he is\nnot always clear about whether these features apply to properties or\nrather to predicates. See Prior (1949) and Poli (2004) for detailed\ndiscussion of Johnson’s views and his influence on later\nauthors. \nSome of these features are familiar, including that determination is a\nspecification relation:  \nTo predicate color or shape of an object obviously characterises it\nless determinately than to predicate of it red or circular; (Johnson\n1921: I, xi, 1)  \nthat this specification is non-conjunctive:  \nthere is a genuine difference between that process of increased\ndetermination which conjunctivally introduces foreign adjectives, and\nthat other process by which without increasing, so to speak, the\nnumber of adjectives, we define them more\n determinately;[2]\n (Johnson 1921: I, xi, 3)  \nthat same-level determinates are incompatible:  \nif any determinate adjective characterises a given substantive, then\nit is impossible that any other determinate under the same\ndeterminable should characterise the same substantive; (Johnson 1921:\nI, xi, 4)  \nand that same-level determinates are moreover “opponent”:\n \nthe unique and peculiar kind of difference that subsists between the\nseveral determinates under the same determinable […] does not\nsubsist between any one of them and an adjective under some other\ndeterminable. (Johnson 1921: I, xi, 1)  \nJohnson moreover develops these features, suggesting, for example,\nthat opponent differences often reflect that determinates are\ncomparable:  \nmany determinates under the same determinable [are such] that the\ndifferences between different pairs of determinates can be compared\nwith one another […]; e.g. the difference between red and\nyellow is greater than that between red and orange. (Johnson 1921: I,\nxi, 4)  \nAttention to determinate comparability leads Johnson to suggest that\ndeterminables may be determined along multiple\n“dimensions”: \n[A] color may vary according to its hue, brightness and saturation; so\nthat the precise determination of a color requires us to define three\nvariables which are more or less independent of one another in their\ncapacity of co-variation; but in one important sense they are not\nindependent of one another, since they could not be manifested in\nseparation. The determinate color is therefore single, though complex\n…. (1921: I, xi, 4) \nThat determinables may have multiple determination dimensions is an\nimportant observation, which plays a foundational role in\nFunkhouser’s (2006) model of determination (see\n §3.6.1). \nTwo other aspects of Johnson’s discussion are worth noting.\nFirst, he denies that determinables are in any sense shared by\ndeterminates: “the ground for grouping determinates under one\nand the same determinable is not any partial agreement between\nthem” but rather “the special kind of difference”\n(1921: I, xi, 1) distinguishing opposing\n determinates.[3]\n As we’ll see, this is a choice point for contemporary accounts.\nSecond, Johnson assumes that while limits in our perceptual or\ninstrumental capabilities require that we characterize objects in\ndeterminable terms, it is nonetheless a  \nuniversally adopted postulate that the characters of things which we\ncan only characterise more or less indeterminately, are, in actual\nfact, absolutely determinate. (1921: I, xi, 5)  \nThe assumption that determinable characterization reflects (mere)\nepistemic, perceptual, or representational limits remains common, and\npushes towards giving one or other deflationary account of\ndeterminables. This is another choice point: on some contemporary\naccounts determinables are both real and irreducible to\ndeterminates. \nIn this sub-section, we discuss certain comparatively recent\ncontributions which influentially shaped the present understanding of\ndetermination. \nPrior’s (1949) two-part discussion of determinables and\ndeterminates is historically rich and philosophically subtle.\nInterestingly, he suggests that the difference between determinates is\nbrute, admitting no explanation:  \nwe can say that the red and the blue agree in being colored, but of\ntheir difference we can only say either that their color is different,\nor that one is red and the other blue. (1949: 5–6)  \nSome have seen this sort of statement as broadly contradictory, in\nsuggesting that what makes determinates similar (e.g., color)\nis also that in virtue of which they are different (“of their\ndifference we can only say … that their color is\ndifferent”);\n see §3.2. \nPrior also considers and rejects Johnson’s assumption that\ndeterminates are similar only in respect to their unique form of\ndifference, rather suggesting (c.f. Salmieri’s discussion of\nAristotle, above) that determinates are similar “in respect\nof” that determinable: \n[I]t seems to me that determinates under the same determinable have a\nclass unity […]. Determinates under the same determinable have\nthe common relational property […] of characterising whatever\nthey do characterise in a certain respect. Redness, blueness, etc.,\nall characterise objects, as we say, “in respect of their\ncolor”; triangularity, squareness, etc., “in respect of\ntheir shape”. And this is surely quite fundamental to the notion\nof being a determinate under a determinable. (1949: 13) \nThat determinates characterize objects in respect of their\ndeterminables is indeed a key feature of determination, though there\nremains disagreement about how best to metaphysically articulate this\nfeature (e.g., as involving shared determinables or not). \nPrior takes this feature to push against deflationary approaches on\nwhich determinables exist, at best, merely to classify the having of\ndeterminate properties. On the contrary, he maintains, if determinates\nare unified by characterizing objects in a certain respect, then  \nthe “respects in which objects are to be characterised”,\nto which determinable adjectives refer, are related to the objects not\nless but more intimately than the determinate qualities which\n“characterise” them. (1949: 13) \nMoving on, Searle (1959) usefully highlights that determination\nappears to contrast not just with the conjunct-conjunction relation,\nbut also with the disjunction-disjunct relation: \n[C]learly not any two terms which stand in the relation of greater to\nless specific ipso stand in the relation of determinate to\ndeterminable: “yellow” is in some sense more specific than\n“yellow or angry” but it is not a determinate of\n“yellow or angry” in the sense in which it is a\ndeterminate of “color”. (1959: 141–2) \nSearle also offers an explicit criterion of determination: \nFor any two terms \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A\\) is a determinate of \\(B\\) if\nand only if \\(A\\) is a non-conjunctive specifier of \\(B\\), and \\(A\\)\nis logically related to all other non-conjunctive specifiers of \\(B\\)\n[where] any two terms are logically [i.e., conceptually] related if\neither entails the other or either entails the negation of the other.\n(1959: 148) \nInterestingly, this criterion doesn’t rule out that \\(B\\) is a\ndisjunction of its determinates (‘non-conjunctive\nspecifiers’), so long as the determinates stand in the requisite\nconceptual entailment relations. Note also that Searle moves fluidly\nbetween talk of determinable properties and talk of determinable\n‘terms’; until recently, this sort of slide was\ncommon. \nSearle notes, as well, that the structure of determinables and\ndeterminates in the same family may give rise to “levels”\nof determinates ordered by degree of specificity; as he says,\n“we would like some way of showing that e.g., “red”\nand “yellow” are on the same level as determinates of\n“color” whereas “scarlet” is on a different\nand lower level” (1959: 145). Here too he offers a\ncriterion: \nTwo terms \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are same level determinates of \\(C\\) if and\nonly if they are both determinates of \\(C\\) and neither is a specifier\nof the other. (1959: 149) \nNext, Armstrong's investigations into the metaphysics of properties (in, e.g., his 1978a,b,\n1989, 1997, and 2010) are notable, first, in treating determination as an explicitly\nmetaphysical relation, and second, in raising to salience the important\nquestion of whether determinables are ontologically reducible to\ndeterminates, asked against the commonly accepted background\nassumption that reality itself is maximally determinate. As\nwe’ll see, Armstrong’s own position on this score swings\nfrom reductionism (1987) to non-reductionism (1997), and back again\n(2010). \nFinally, Yablo’s (1992) is notable in offering a modal account\nof determination as a relation of asymmetric dependence, and in\nextending determination to particulars (events) as well as\nproperties. Since asymmetrical necessitation now serves as a common\nminimal characterization of determination, it’s worth seeing how\nYablo motivates this approach. He starts by observing a parallel\nbetween intuitive characterizations of identity and of determination,\nas holding between properties: \n\\(P\\) is identical to \\(Q\\) iff: for a thing to be \\(P\\) is for it to\nbe \\(Q\\). \n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\) iff: for a thing to be \\(P\\) is for it to be\n\\(Q\\), not simpliciter, but in a specific way. \nThe parallel is useful in suggesting that determination is, like\nidentity, a particularly intimate relation, in that\ndeterminables and determinates types and/or tokens may not be wholly\ndistinct, and also in suggesting a modal treatment of determination. Hence\njust as the characterization of identity is illuminated by the\nfollowing modal condition (stemming from the principle of the indiscernibility of identicals): \nso too is the characterization of determination illuminated by the\nfollowing modal condition: \nThe parallel also suggests that an account of determination\nneedn’t impose conditions on conceptual entailment relations (as\nSearle’s did): just as Kripke’s (1980) results undermine\nthe need for a conceptual entailment requirement on identity (e.g.,\nwater might be identical with H\\(_2\\)O even if ‘water’ and\n‘H\\(_2\\)O’ don’t conceptually entail each other),\n“we should discount the traditional doctrine’s conceptual\ncomponent and reconceive determination in wholly metaphysical\nterms” (Yablo 1992: 253). That said, as Yablo admits, asymmetric\nnecessitation alone is insufficient to characterize determination\n(since, e.g., allowing conjunctions to determine their conjuncts). We\nwill later consider various ways of filling in the modal conditions,\nincluding Yablo’s own essence-based approach\n (§3.5.1). \nYablo’s discussion is also notable in highlighting an important\nseeming feature of determinables and determinates, according to which\nthey do not causally compete: \n[No causal exclusion principle can] apply to determinates and their\ndeterminables—for we know that they are not causal rivals.\n[…] any credible reconstruction of the exclusion principle must\nrespect the truism that determinates do not contend with their\ndeterminables for causal influence. (1992: 259) \nThis feature is key to a recently popular strategy for solving the problem\nof mental causation—an intriguing application which raised to\nsalience the potential usefulness of determination for metaphysical\nand other philosophical purposes (see §5.2). \nWe are now in position to list the features commonly taken to\ncharacterize determinables, determinates, and their\n relation;[4]\n the presentation is in terms of properties, and may require\nadjustment to apply to entities of other categories\n (see §2.2).\n This is not a minimal or axiomatic set: some features follow from\nothers; moreover, there are cases to be made that some of these\nfeatures do not hold in full generality. In addition, how to\nmetaphysically understand these features varies, in ways we will\ndiscuss down the line. \nIncreased specificity: If \\(P\\) is a determinate of\n(‘determines’) \\(Q\\), then to be \\(P\\) is to be \\(Q\\), in\na specific way. \nDetermination relates properties that are more or less specific,\nrelative to each other. For example, red is a determinate of\ncolor; scarlet is a determinate of red. \nIrreflexivity, Asymmetry, Transitivity: For\nno \\(P\\) does \\(P\\) determine \\(P\\); If \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\), then\n\\(Q\\) does not determine \\(P\\); if \\(R\\) determines \\(P\\), and \\(P\\)\ndetermines \\(Q\\), then \\(R\\) determines \\(Q\\). \nThese features, characteristic of strict partial orderings, follow\njust from Increased specificity. For example,\nscarlet does not determine itself, since no property can be\nmore specific than itself. If scarlet determines\nred, then red does not determine scarlet,\nsince red cannot be both less and more specific than\nscarlet. And if to be scarlet is to be red, in a\nspecific way, and to be red is to be colored, in a specific\nway, then to be scarlet is to be a yet more specific way of\nbeing colored, such that scarlet determines\ncolor. \nRelative, leveled determination: Except for minimally\nspecific determinables and maximally specific determinates, a\nproperty’s characterization as determinable or determinate is\nrelative. Relatedly, determinables can be determined at different\n‘levels’ of specificity. \nFor example, red is a determinate of color, but a\ndeterminable of scarlet; red, blue, and\nyellow determine color at one level of\nspecification; scarlet, navy, and buttercup\ndetermine color at another (more finely grained) level of\nspecification. \nDetermination ‘in respect of’ determinables: If\n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\), \\(P\\) is more specific than \\(Q\\) in respect\nof \\(Q\\). \nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates is, more\nspecifically, ‘in respect of’ the\n determinable.[5]\n For example, if red determines color, red\nis more specific than color in respect of color.\nDetermination in respect of a determinable is sometimes further\nexplicated as involving specification along one or more\n‘determination dimensions’ of the determinable—for\nexample, the determination dimensions of color are commonly\nsupposed to be hue, saturation, and\nbrightness. \nDeterminate similarity/comparability: If \\(P\\) and \\(R\\) are\ndifferent same-level determinates of a determinable \\(Q\\), then \\(P\\)\nand \\(R\\) are similar, and moreover comparable, in respect of\n\\(Q\\). \nThat determination is ‘in respect of’ determinables gives\nrise to similarity and systematic comparability relations among\ndeterminates. For example, determinates of\ncolor—red, blue, orange,\netc.—are all similar in being colors, and any two colors are\ncomparable in this respect: red is more similar to\norange than to blue in respect of color,\nand so on. \nNon-conjunctive specification: if \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\),\nthen \\(P\\) is not identical with any conjunctive property conjoining\n\\(Q\\) with any property or properties independent of \\(Q\\). \nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates does not\ninvolve conjoining or otherwise combining the determinable with\nanother property independent of the determinable. For example,\nred is not appropriately understood as the conjunction of\ncolor and another property independent of\ncolor. \nNon-disjunctive specification: if \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\),\nthen \\(Q\\) is not identical with any disjunctive property disjoining\n\\(P\\) with any property or properties independent of \\(P\\). \nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates does not\ninvolve disjunctive elimination. For example, color is not a\ndisjunction of red and some other property or properties\nindependent of red. \nDeterminable inheritance: For every determinable \\(Q\\) of a\ndeterminate \\(P\\): if \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) at a time \\(t\\) then \\(x\\) must\nhave \\(Q\\) at \\(t\\). \nObjects must have every determinable of any determinates they have. For\nexample, if something is scarlet, then it must also be both red and\ncolored. \nRequisite determination: If \\(x\\) has \\(Q\\) at a time \\(t\\),\nthen for every level \\(L\\) of determination of \\(Q\\): \\(x\\) must have\nsome \\(L\\)-level determinate \\(P\\) of \\(Q\\) at \\(t\\). \nObjects must have a determinate of every determinable they have. For\nexample, if something is colored, then it must be some specific color\n(e.g., red). \nMultiple determinates: For every determinate \\(P\\) of a\ndeterminable \\(Q\\), there is a determinate \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) that is\ndistinct from, but at the same level of specificity as, \\(P\\). \nWith determinate specificity comes multiplicity or diversity. For\nexample, color has multiple determinates (red,\nblue, yellow, and so on); red has multiple\ndeterminates (scarlet, crimson, burgundy,\nand so on). \nDeterminate incompatibility: If \\(x\\) has determinate \\(P\\)\nof determinable \\(Q\\) at time \\(t\\), then \\(x\\) cannot have, at \\(t\\),\nany other determinate \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) at the same level of specificity\nas \\(P\\). \nFor example, an object cannot be both red and blue all over, at a\n time.[6]\n Determinate incompatibility is moreover ‘opponent’ in\nthat same-level determinates are exclusive\n alternatives.[7] \nUnique determination: If \\(x\\) has a determinable \\(Q\\) at a\ntime, then \\(x\\) has a unique—one and only one—determinate\n\\(P\\) at any given level of specification at that time. \nUnique determination is entailed by Requisite\ndetermination and Determinate incompatibility. \nAsymmetric modal dependence: if \\(P\\) is a determinate of\n\\(Q\\), then if \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) then \\(x\\) must have \\(Q\\), but for\nsome \\(y\\), \\(y\\) might have \\(Q\\) without having \\(P\\). \nFor example, anything that is scarlet must be red, but something might\nbe red without being scarlet (it might rather be, e.g., burgundy).\nAsymmetric dependence is entailed by Determinable\ninheritance, Requisite determination, and Multiple\ndeterminates. \nCausal compatibility: Determinables and determinates do not\ncausally compete. \nFor example, if a given patch is both red and\nscarlet, there is no in-principle difficulty with both\nred and scarlet being causally efficacious\nvis-á-vis the pecking of a pigeon trained to peck at\nany red patch. \nMotivated as they are by a limited range of paradigm cases, not all of\nthese features may be characteristic of determination in the strong\nsense of being required for the holding of that relation, as opposed\nto being typically or generally true of some or most instances of the\nrelation (or its relata). \nFor example, Johansson (2004) observes that if property is an\ndeterminable of color, then Determinate\nincompatibility (hence Unique determination) will fail,\nnoting that on this score “Johnson […] generalized too\nquickly” (2004: 117); what is rather true is that “for\nsome ontological determinables […] two determinates\ncannot possibly exist in the same space-time region” (2004:\n118). Armstrong offers other cases of purportedly compatible\ndeterminates, involving odors, tastes, or sounds: “a sauce may\nbe both sour and sweet. A bell may have a tone which is composed of\nboth a fundamental and a number of higher overtones” (1978b:\n113; see also Fales 1990, Sanford 2014, and Massin 2013). \nIt may also be questioned whether all determinates of determinables\ncan be systematically compared, as per Determinate\nsimilarity/comparability. It is unclear, for example, whether\nbeing pentagonal is more or less similar in respect of\nshape to being square or being sextagonal.\nIt is also unclear whether all determinates of smell admit of\nsystematic comparability (is the smell of pine more similar to the\nsmell of rose or of violet?), though recent empirical work identifying\nthe dimensions of “smell space” (see, e.g., Mamlouk &\nMartinetz 2004) may reveal an underlying structure of the sort\n(appealing to hue, saturation, and brightness) that serves as an\nunderlying basis for ordering determinate colors (which work might\nalso serve as a basis for responding to Armstrong, above). The\nquestion of whether all determinables may be systematically ordered\nwith respect to their determinables, either explicitly or implicitly,\nmatters to whether determinate/determinable relations can be modeled\nin spatial terms along lines proposed by Funkhouser (2006)\n (see §3.6.1). \nUnique determination and Requisite determination may\nalso admit of exceptions. Wilson (2013) argues that even for\nparadigmatic determinables such as color, Unique\ndetermination is not generally correct, since the case of an\niridescent feather is reasonably interpreted as one in which the\nfeather is (a) colored, (b) red from one perspective, and (c) blue\nfrom another perspective, such that no one determinate shade is\nnon-arbitrarily identified as “the” unique determinate\ndetermining the determinable color had by the feather\n(rather, she suggests, the determinates are had, at best, in\nrelativized\n fashion).[8]\n More generally, she argues that there can be failures of Unique\ndetermination due either to there being too many candidate\ndeterminates (as in the feather case) or to there being too few or\nnone, contra Requisite determination (as might be the case\nfor certain quantum phenomena; see below). Fales observes that\nRequisite determination  \nappears to admit of exceptions in the case of certain objects of\nmental acts: for example, as regards the number of spots on an\nimagined or a hallucinated speckled hen. (1990: 167)  \nSimilarly, Rosen and Smith (2004) suggest that considerations of\nvagueness indicate that an object may have a determinable without\ndeterminately having any corresponding determinate, and Bokulich\n(2014) and Wolff (2015) suggest that cases of value indeterminacy in\nquantum mechanics are promisingly seen as involving undetermined\ndeterminables\n (see §5.3). \nFinally, as we will see in\n §3.4,\n a reductive approach to determinables, along lines of, e.g., Bigelow\nand Pargetter (1990), Clapp (2001), Rodriguez-Pereyra (2002), Antony\n(2003), and Massin (2013), takes these to be disjunctive properties\nhaving associated determinates as disjuncts; disjunctive reductionists\nuniformly reject Non-disjunctive specification as ever true\nof determination or its relata. \nThough paradigm cases of determination (involving color,\nshape, mass, and so on) appear to hold between\nmonadic property types, it is straightforward to extend the notion to\nrelations—e.g., distance. Hence Johansson says that\nwhile the restriction to monadic types is ‘traditional’,\n \nI do not think there are any good reasons for the restriction.\n[…] Relational concepts, just like property concepts, can be\nfitted into determinable-determinate trees. (2000: 117)  \nMore controversially, determination has been taken to hold between\nentities of ontological (including representational) categories going\nbeyond properties and relations. \nTo start, as above, historical discussion of determinables and\ndeterminates (in, e.g., Johnson 1921) moves fairly freely between talk\nof these as representational (linguistic/conceptual) and as\nmetaphysical. In some such cases, the target is plausibly a properly\nmetaphysical\n distinction.[9]\n In other cases—e.g., in empiricist treatments—the\ncharacterization of determination in representational terms is clearly\nintended to be metaphysically deflationary. We will later revisit\nreasons for and against taking determinables or determination at\nmetaphysical face value\n (§3.1,\n §3.2). \nModulo deflationary concerns, there does not appear to be any\nin-principle barrier to allowing that determination can hold between\nentities of other\n categories.[10]\n Determination has been extended to actions or episodes (see, e.g.,\nMulligan 1992 and Cruse 1995: chap. 6), events (Yablo 1992), fields (von Wachter\n2000), tropes (Funkhouser\n2006), states (Fine 2011), and substances (Massin 2013). That said,\none might maintain that some such entities can be related by\ndetermination since falling under or in part constituted by\ndeterminable and determinate properties. Whatever one’s position\non what ontological categories the relata of determination can fall\nunder, there are (as per metaphysical usual) different available\nunderstandings of the categories at\n issue.[11] \nAnother question pertaining to ontological categories concerns whether\nsome or all specification relations are themselves determinates of a\nmore general relation determinable; Johansson (2000: sec. 8) endorses\nsuch a view. \nWe turn now to canvassing contemporary accounts of determinables,\ndeterminates, and their relation. The main varieties of contemporary\nontological accounts are anti-realist accounts, on which determinables\ndo not exist; reductive accounts, on which determinables exist but are\nmetaphysically reducible to (that is, identical with) some or other\nconstruction of determinates; and non-reductive accounts, on which\ndeterminables exist and are not metaphysically reducible to any\nconstruction of determinates. Non-reductive accounts furthermore split\ninto versions on which determinables are (always) less fundamental\nthan associated vis-á-vis determinates, and accounts\non which determinables can be as fundamental as, or even more fundamental than,\ndeterminates; we reserve treatment of this further issue for\n §4.\n A different sort of contemporary account is directed not so much at\nthe ontological question(s) as at elucidating certain structural or\nbroadly logical aspects of determination or associated relata. \nAs background for the ontological accounts to come, we start with a\nnumber of considerations commonly taken to provide prima facie support\nfor taking determinables to exist, and to moreover be ontologically\nirreducible (again: not identical to any construction of) to\ndeterminates. We then consider some preliminary motivations for\ndeflationary (anti-realist or reductive) treatments of determinables.\nOne might wonder whether the motivations for\ntaking determinables to exist might be presented independently of the\nmotivations for taking determinables to be irreducible; but this proves\ndifficult, for there simply isn’t enough daylight between the\ninitial motivations for existence and for irreducibility to prise them\napart. The presentation thus reflects that the motivations for\nreducibility (or for anti-realism) come later, as pushing against\ntaking the prima facie appearances of irreducible determinables at\nface value. \nThere are perceptual, scientific, causal, semantic, and metaphysical\nconsiderations weighing in prima facie favor of determinables’\nexisting and moreover being metaphysically irreducible to\ndeterminates. Again, these motivations are preliminary; as we’ll\nsee down the line, anti-realists and reductionists take there to be\ngood reasons to resist taking the seeming appearances of existence\nand/or irreducibility at face value\n(see §3.2). \nPerception provides one source of support for there being\ndeterminables, which on the face of it are not appropriately taken to\nbe reducible to determinates. The best motivations here are indirect,\nsince bare claims that we can perceive determinables as distinct from\ndeterminates are \ndisputable.[12] \nOne such motivation appeals to Sorites\nphenomena as indicating that we fail to perceive fully determinate\ninstances of many properties, including colors, tones, and\ntextures. As Fales puts it, this  \nis a conclusion which seems forced upon us by the fact that each\nmember of a series of colors, etc., may be perceptually\nindistinguishable from its immediate neighbors but easily\ndistinguishable from more distant members of the series. (1990:\n 172)[13] \nA second indirect perceptual motivation for existing and irreducible\ndeterminables reflects that our perception of macro-objects typically\nfails to register microdeterminate details. For example,\nshape is a paradigmatic determinable, but we do not perceive\nthe shapes of trees, tables, and the like, in microscopic detail. In\nre this and the Sorites motivation, it is worth noting that even if\nperceived objects are themselves maximally determinate, perceptual\nexperience may still motivate irreducible determinables; as Wilson\nnotes,  \nPerhaps the (instances of) properties perceived are really maximally\ndeterminate, and only perceptual features or modes of presentation are\ndeterminable; but features of perceptual experience are also aspects\nof reality, so the larger point remains. (2012: 5) \nA third indirect perceptual motivation for irreducible determinables\nis that these best explain our being able to perceive that different\ndeterminates are similar in the relevant determinable respect. Hence\nFales suggests that since we are able “to notice or be aware\nof” the similarity between different shades of red,  \nit seems clear that red is observable every time we observe an\ninstance of a shade of red, even though it is not separable from that\nshade, but is in the shade. (1990: 172)  \nBoth fundamental physical\nand special-scientific posits and laws appear to be characterized, at\nleast in part, in determinable terms. As Armstrong (1997) and French\n(2014) observe, it is natural to see fundamental physical laws as\nrelating determinables, such as mass and charge, or to themselves be\ndeterminable\n relations.[14]\n And in the special sciences, for example, the features of molecules\nrelevant to chemical interactions abstract from the precise details of\natomic position and momentum, and features of thermodynamic systems\nnear critical points abstract from compositional and other micro-level\ndetails (see Batterman 1998). More generally, the posit\nof existing and irreducible determinables in both fundamental and\nspecial sciences is in line with a principle of explanation pervasive\nin the sciences, according to which good explanations do not cite\nunnecessary details (see, e.g., Strevens\n 2004).[15] Determinables appear to\nbe causally unspecific, in having fewer powers—in being able to\ncontribute to causing fewer effects, in the circumstances—than\ntheir associated determinates. For example, red has the power\nto get Sophie the pigeon, who pecks at any red thing, to peck; but\nred doesn’t have the power to get Sophie’s picky\ncousin Alice, who pecks only at scarlet patches, to peck—for a\nred patch might be not scarlet, but burgundy (see Yablo 1992, Wilson\n1999, and Shoemaker 2001). Such a lack of causal specificity, combined\nwith a principle of individuation of scientific properties according\nto which they are (perhaps only contingently) distinguished by\ndifferent sets of powers, has been taken to support not just the\nexistence but the irreducibility of determinable features.  On a simple and in some\nsense default semantics, a sentence of the form ‘\\(a\\) is\n\\(F\\)’ is true just in case the entity picked out by \\(a\\) has\nthe property picked out by \\(F\\). Hence if ‘This ruby is\nred’ is true then on the default semantics the predicate\n‘red’ refers to the determinable red.  As previously, Johansson (2000) posits determinables as providing\na metaphysical basis for perceived similarity among\ndeterminates. Wilson (2012) argues, more generally, that determinables\nmay be considered ‘natural’ in the\n‘joint-carving’ sense of Lewis (1983) in virtue of\nproviding a non-gerrymandered basis for objective similarity among\ndeterminates. \nAgain, each of the motivations in (3.1.1) – (3.1.5) is\npreliminary. If the seeming appearance of there being irreducible\ndeterminables can be defended against objections, however, the\nphilosophical work these can do in encoding distinctively unspecific\naspects of reality (as per the applications in \n§5) would constitute additional positive support\nfor their posit. \nThe main preliminary motivations against determinables existing\nor being metaphysically irreducible to determinates reflect concerns\nthat such determinables would be unparsimonious, give rise to causal\noverdetermination, and/or violate the supposition that reality is\nultimately or fundamentally maximally determinate. These concerns and\nassociated support for anti-realist (‘eliminativist’) or\nrealist reductionist accounts are similar to those sometimes brought\nto bear against irreducible higher-level (e.g., special scientific)\ngoings-on. \nReality as maximally determinate. One objection to\nirreducible determinables appeals to the supposition that reality\nitself is maximally determinate, such that there are no irreducible\ndeterminable properties; as Armstrong maintains, “[a]ll\nuniversals must be determinate” (1978b: 117). Relatedly, many\nsuppose that there is no “vagueness” in the world; as\nLewis maintains, “[t]he only intelligible account of vagueness\nlocates it in our thought and language” (1986: 212).[16] \nDeterminables as failing to track exact similarity. Armstrong\ntakes “the powerful truism that universals are strictly\nidentical in their distinct instantiations” to support the claim\nthat “properties that are lowest determinates […] are\ngood candidates for being universals” (1997: 49). More weakly,\none might maintain that the best reason for positing properties,\nhowever understood, is as explaining exact similarity (in a given\nrespect) between objects. Supposing so, one might moreover maintain\nthat only determinates exist, on grounds that particulars having\ndeterminable properties might fail to exactly resemble in determinate\nrespects (e.g., red objects might be different shades of\n red).[17] \nDeterminables as ontologically or causally redundant.\nIrreducible determinables have been taken to be ontologically and\ncausally redundant, since determinates which we have independent\nreason to posit can explain or do anything that determinables\npurportedly explain or do. Hence Massin (2013) maintains against\nJohansson (2000) that perceived inexact resemblances between\ndeterminates can explain the “seen unity of the determinate\ncolors”, and Gillett and Rives maintain that determinables are\ncausally unnecessary: \n[P]ositing instances of determinate properties offers the best\nexplanation for the causal relations we observe in the world\n[…] Should we also accept that there are instances of\ndeterminable properties corresponding to predicates such as ‘is\ncolored’ or ‘is charged’? […] There is a\nclear concern that it is ontologically profligate to take two\nproperties to be contributing causal powers, a determinable and its\ndeterminate, where one, the determinate, would apparently suffice.\n(2005: 487) \nHeil (2003) levels similar complaints. \nDeterminables as inducing causal overdetermination. Related\nto the concern about causal redundancy is the concern, again pressed\nby Gillett and Rives (2005), that irreducible broadly scientific\ndeterminables induce problematic causal overdetermination. To start,\nif such determinables exist, they need to earn their causal\n keep.[18]\n But following the concern about causal redundancy, determinables\nsimply reproduce the powers of their determinates, allowing instances\nof distinct properties to give rise to the same effect on a given\noccasion. And while such overdetermination sometimes occurs, as in\nfiring squad or double-rock-throw cases, this is not the right model\nfor determinables and\n determinates.[19] \nDeterminables as incoherent. Armstrong (1978a: 106–7,\n117–18) argues that determinables are incoherent, in\nconstituting the respect in which associated determinates are both\nsimilar and dissimilar (see Elder 1996: 151 for\n discussion).[20]\n Fales (1990: 174) sees the concern as incorrectly presupposing that\ndeterminables are second-order properties of or relations between\ndeterminates. Massin (2013) thinks the concern depends on whether the\nsimilarity at issue is exact or inexact; if inexact, there is no\nproblem (“[t]wo things that are imperfectly similar in their\ncolour can be imperfectly dissimilar in their colour”) but if\nexact—in virtue, e.g., of determinables being exactly similar\nconstituents of determinates—then incoherence follows, since\ndifferences between determinates must be explained by what\n“remains” once the shared determinable is removed, but we\ncannot make sense of such removal. \nWhile motivated by the previous concerns, anti-realists about\ndeterminables also aim to explain or explain away (or\n“debunk”) at least some seeming motivations for\ndeterminables. A common debunking strategy appeals to something like\nBerkeley’s (1710) claim that it is a mistake to suppose that\ngeneral terms denote abstract\n ideas.[21]\n For example, Heil (2003) echoes Berkeley’s claim, taking\nseeming semantic reasons for positing determinables to reflect an\nuncritical tendency to suppose that “we can ‘read\noff’ features of reality from our ways of speaking about\nit” (207), such that even if, e.g., the predicate ‘is\nred’ truly applies to some objects (tomatoes, apples, rubies) we\nshould not take this to be in virtue of their possessing the\n“very same property”. \nDifferent positive anti-realist accounts of determinate terms or\nconcepts and their function are available. Berkeley endorses a\nschematic account, on which general terms/concepts indeterminately\nrefer to determinate features—here, generality is placed in\nlanguage or mind, rather than\n world.[22]\n Heil (2003) also endorses a schematic approach, offering a pragmatic\naccount of the function of determinable terms, as reflecting that we\nhappen to have perceptual systems suited for tracking certain inexact\nsimilarities between objects having (ultimately highly complex)\ndeterminate properties. That the ‘work’ determinable terms\ndo consists in tracking inexact similarities between objects or\ndeterminates is a common theme in three alternative anti-realist\naccounts. First is Searle’s (1959) account, on which\ndeterminable terms are higher-order predicates of determinate\n predicates.[23]\n Second is Mill’s account of determinable predicates as  \nnames not of one single and definite attribute, but of a class of\nattributes. Such is the word color, which is a name common to\nwhiteness, redness, etc. (1843/1973: I.ii.5)  \nThird is Armstrong’s account, first offered in his 1978a and\ndeveloped in his 1997, according to which  \nFor a particular to “instantiate” a determinable is\n[…] for it to instantiate just one of a class of\nuniversals’ […] having the determinable property entails\nno more than having one of the determinate properties. (1997: 53) \nOne concern with anti-realist accounts has to do with the source of\nclassification of determinates under a determinable term or concept.\nAs above, this is usually taken to involve inexact resemblance, but if\ninexact resemblance is primitive, then objections of the sort leveled\nagainst resemblance nominalist treatments of inexact resemblance may\narise, mutatis mutandis (see Fales [1990: 117–20] for\ndiscussion, and Rodriguez-Pereyra [2002] for a recent response). An\nalternative means of classification of determinates appeals to\n“naturalness” (as per Lewis 1983) as a primitive property\nbinding determinates into classes, but this approach incurs\nontological commitment and, it might be complained, is not clearly\nexplanatory. Perhaps the most developed approach to determinate\nclassification is Armstrong’s, on which “the resemblance\nof determinate universals is constituted by partial identity, where\nthe greater the resemblance the greater degree of identity”\n(1997: 51), such that, for example, determinate lengths resemble in\nvirtue of sharing unit length\n universals.[24]\n Armstrong argues that his account makes sense of various features of\ndetermination: Determinate opponent incompatibility is\naccommodated since, e.g., an object’s length cannot be identical\nto different sums of unit lengths; Determinate\nsimilarity/comparability is accommodated since different\ndeterminate lengths share some but not all unit lengths;\nAsymmetric dependence is accommodated since specific sums of\nunit lengths entail the having of length, but not vice versa.\nIt has been complained, however, that his account cannot handle\nthe full range of\n cases.[25] \nA second concern is that the presupposition that all properties are\nultimately maximally determinate violates certain possible and\npotentially actual conceptions of natural reality. For example, if\nobjects fill space, and space is both continuous and gunky (i.e., such\nthat every entity has proper parts), then the shapes and locations of\nobjects will be indefinitely subject to further determination (see\nSalmieri 2008: 78,\n n47).[26]\n And certain interpretations of quantum mechanics\n (see §5.3\n for further discussion) and certain field-theoretic understandings of\nfundamental particles as having infinitely extensible boundaries\n(reflecting these particles’ being constituted by\nlong-range interactions) suggest that natural reality is to some\nextent irreducibly determinable. \nA third, related concern is that it is unclear how the eliminativist\ncan accommodate (or debunk) all the motivations for determinables. It\nremains unclear, for example, how to explain Sorites phenomena if all\nproperties—including perceptual modes of presentation—are\nmaximally determinate. \nReductionists take determinables to exist but to be reducible to\ndeterminates—that is, to be identical to classes or broadly\nlogical constructions of (ultimately maximal) determinates. \nThe most common reductionist strategy takes determinables to be\nidentical to disjunctions of (ultimately maximal) determinates (see,\ne.g., Bigelow and Pargetter 1990; Clapp 2001; Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002;\nAntony\n 2003;[27]\n and Massin 2013). On this view, for example, color is\nidentical to a disjunctive property having every maximally specific\ncolor shade as a disjunct. \nDisjunctivism explains several features of determination:\nRequisite determination is accommodated since the instancing\nof a disjunction requires the instancing of a disjunct;\nDeterminable inheritance is accommodated since the instancing\nof a disjunct entails the instancing of any associated disjunctions\n(see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002, Massin 2013); Causal\ncompatibility is accommodated via the identity of determinable\n(disjunctive) and determinate (disjunct) instances. And while\ndisjunctivism violates Non-disjunctive specification,\ndisjunctivists preserve some contrast by stipulating that\ndeterminables are a special sub-class of the class of disjunctive\nproperties—ones having resembling determinates as disjuncts.\nOther stipulations may be required to accommodate Determinate\nincompatibility, Determination ‘in respect of’\ndeterminables, and Unique determination. \nThree concerns face disjunctivist accounts, besides concerns that the\nrequired stipulations are unexplanatory, and that reality may not be\n(ultimately, entirely) maximally determinate. The first reflects\nreasons for rejecting disjunctive properties. One such\nreason—namely, Armstrong’s concern that “disjunctive\nproperties offend against the principle that a genuine property is\nidentical in its different particulars” (1978a: 20)—may be\nput aside if the disjuncts at issue are genuinely resembling, as\nproponents of disjunctivism suppose. This response will not, however,\nsatisfy those taking disjunctions to be mere logical constructions,\nwith no metaphysical import. \nThe second concern is that taking the disjuncts identified with\ndeterminates to be genuinely resembling, as is needed in order to\nanswer Armstrong’s concern and to provide an alternative basis\nfor the contrast flagged in Non-disjunctive specification,\nwill open the door to looking for a source of the supposed\ncommonality, which source might well end up being an irreducible\ndeterminable. Here again the question of how best to treat the inexact\nresemblance between determinates is pressing. \nThe third concern is that a disjunctive account cannot accommodate all\nthe prima facie motivations for determinables. Again, our perceptions\nof and thoughts about determinables do not appear to be perceptions of\nor thoughts about disjunctions of maximal determinates. Rosen (2010)\npresses this point, noting that a “suggestive line of thought\nweighs against” disjunctivism, as per a case in which someone\nfamiliar with many shades of blue has no conception of\ncerulean (indeed, is perhaps even incapable of thinking of\nthis shade), but where this deficit “would not prevent him from\nbeing competent with the word ‘blue’, or from knowing a\ngreat deal about the color blue” (2010: 128). \nBigelow and Pargetter’s (1990) relational account aims to\nexplain both why determinates are similar and why they differ. They\nsee irreducible determinables as insufficient unto this task, on\ngrounds, first, that taking determinables to be irreducibly distinct\nfrom but necessarily accompanied by determinates introduces\nunexplained necessary connections (1990: 118), and second, that\ndeterminables alone don’t explain differences between\ndeterminates (1990: 54, 58; see also Armstrong 1978b: 113). Bigelow\nand Pargetter rather suggest that what it is for determinates to\n“fall under a common determinable” is for the determinates\nto instantiate second-degree relations of difference from one another,\nand for pairs of these differences to in turn instantiate third-degree\nproportions (1990: 58–62). \nBesides the usual concerns with reductive accounts, two concerns\nattach to a relational approach. The first is that attention to the\nway in which determinates differ doesn’t in itself serve to\ncharacterize the way in which determinates resemble. As Elder puts it,\n \nalthough properties such as being blue or rich or stabbingly painful\ndo come in different degrees or intensities, there is more that is\ncommon to the various precise “values” of these properties\nthan just that they differ from one another in graduated ways. (1996:\n155)  \nThe second is that, as Elder also observes, from the metaphysical\nirreducibility of determinables to determinates, it doesn’t\nfollow that their necessary connection is mysterious: if  \nthe various determinates […] each embodies the same property as\nthe others […] it is hard to see any great mystery in the fact\nthat possession of any one of these determinate shades necessarily\ngoes with possession of the relevant determinable. (1996: 157)  \nAlso worth noting is that concerns about necessary connections\ntypically arise from acceptance of Hume’s Dictum, according to\nwhich there are no metaphysically necessary connections between\ndistinct existences; but post-empiricist motivations for believing\nthis principle are unclear (see MacBride 2005 and Wilson 2010). \nWe turn now to accounts on which determinables are taken to irreducibly\nexist. These accounts are typically implemented under the assumption\nthat determinables are less fundamental than—are metaphysically\nposterior to—determinates. In\n §4\n I’ll consider whether determinables may be as fundamental as\ndeterminates, and whether certain of the non-reductive accounts to\nfollow are compatible with fundamental as well as non-fundamental\ndeterminables. \nYablo (1992) takes asymmetrical necessitation (i.e., Asymmetrical\ndependence) as a neutral modal basis for theorizing about\ndetermination:  \n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\) just in case the traditional relation’s\nfirst, metaphysical component is in place, where this consists\nprimarily in the fact that \\(P\\) necessitates \\(Q\\) asymmetrically.\n(1992: 253, note 23)  \nSince reductionists also accept Asymmetric dependence, a\nmodal account requires supplementation if it is to be\nnon-reductive. \nYablo does go beyond asymmetric necessitation in considering how\n(token, particular) events—the assumed relata of the causal\nrelation—might stand in the determination relation; his approach\nappeals to the notion of essence of an event, and to the idea that the\nessence of one such event might be included in or subsumed by the\nessence of another: \nDetermination involves the idea that the requirements associated with\none thing include the requirements associated with another; and\nalthough properties are requiremental on their face, particulars are\nnot. Hence the need for a notion of individual essence, where\nessential properties of a thing are those it cannot exist without.\n[T]he essence of a thing is supposed to be a measure of what is\nrequired in order to be that thing. Thus if more is required to be\n\\(y\\) than to be \\(x\\), this should be reflected in an inclusion\nrelation between their essences: \nWhen \\(q\\)’s essence is a subset of \\(p\\)’s essence, \\(p\\)\nis said to subsume \\(q\\) (\\(p \\geq q\\)); and \\(p\\) determines \\(q\\)\n(\\(p > q\\)) when the inclusion is strict. (1992: 261) \nGiven the role essences play in individuation, this approach promises\nto characterize determinable events in properly non-reductive terms,\nat both the type and token levels, and might be extended to a more\ngeneral non-reductive account of determinables, capable of\naccommodating the range of motivations for irreducible determinables.\nTaking determinables to have essences contained within determinate\nessences would also clearly explain various features of determination,\nincluding (besides Asymmetric dependence, which is presumably\nstill in force), Determinable inheritance and\nDetermination ‘in respect of’ determinables. More\nneeds to be said, however if an appeal to essences is to explain\ncertain other features of determination, including Non-conjunctive\nspecification, Requisite determination, Determinate\nopponent incompatibility, and—importantly for Yablo’s\nintended application of determination to the problem of mental\ncausation;\n see §5.2—Causal compatibility. \nCausal and powers-based accounts of determination are typically\nmotivated by the problem of mental/higher-level causation, expressed\nby the question: How can higher-level properties bring about effects,\nas they seem to do, given that the physical properties upon which\nthese higher-level properties depend are sufficient to cause these\neffects? As we’ll see in\n §5.2,\n different causal accounts provide different answers to this question.\nAn important choice point, which I’ll track here, concerns\nwhether determinable and determinate instances are taken to be\ntoken-identical. \nThough MacDonald and MacDonald (1986) don’t officially offer an\naccount of determination, they were the first to see determination as\nuseful for addressing the threat of causal overdetermination.\nEffectively, they suggest that the relation between mental and\nphysical properties is analogous to determination: in both cases the\nproperties at issue are, they maintain, type-distinct but token-identical, thus\navoiding problematic overdetermination while preserving type-level\ncausal relevance. Here and elsewhere, token-identity accounts of\ndeterminables and determinates do not clearly accommodate certain of\nthe (e.g., perceptual) motivations for irreducible determinables;\ntoken-identity accounts are also subject to an extension of\nHorgan’s (1989) concerns with reductive accounts of mental\nstates, according to which, insofar as the causal relata are\nultimately located particulars (events, objects, property instances),\nthe efficacy of determinables qua determinable—that is,\nqua distinctively unspecific—requires that determinable\nand determinate tokens as well as types be distinct. \nThe first explicitly causal theory of determination is Fale’s (1990) account of\n‘determinable or generic’ and ‘specific’\nuniversals, on which the former have a proper subset of the\n‘causal relations’ of the latter: \nIf \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are specific universals and \\(G\\) is a\ndeterminable or generic universal under which they both fall, then the\ncausal relations between \\(G\\) and other universals are a subset of\nthe causal relations between \\(S\\) and other universals; and also a\nsubset of the causal relations between \\(S'\\) and other universals.\nFor \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) to be species of a common genus is for them to\nshare some subset of causal relations, which subset can itself\nconstitute the causal essence of a universal, such as \\(G\\). For \\(S\\)\nand \\(S'\\) to be distinct species is for this subset to be a proper\nsubset of the causal relations which characterize \\(S\\), and also of\nthe causal relations which characterize \\(S'\\): there must be some\ncausal relation which \\(S\\) has, but not \\(S'\\), and some causal\nrelation which \\(S'\\) has, but not \\(S\\). (1990: 175) \nA subset-of-causal-relations account of generic/determinable\nuniversals promisingly accommodates many features of determination,\nfor reasons similar to those attaching to powers-based accounts,\nbelow. It also ensures the metaphysical irreducibility of a\ngeneric/determinable type to any specific/determinate type, by the\nprinciple of the indiscernibility of identicals (if \\(G\\) has only a\nproper subset of causal relations of \\(S\\), \\(G\\) cannot be identified\nwith \\(S\\)); and if this proper subset relation is preserved at the\nlevel of tokens, it will also block token-identity. More needs to be\nsaid, however, if this account is to ensure accommodation of\nNon-disjunctive specification (and more generally, if it is\nto block the metaphysical reducibility of determinable types to\ncertain constructions of determinate types), since one might suggest\n(as a variation of the theme of Antony 2003) that disjunctive types,\nlike Fales’s generic types, also have the causal relations in\nthe intersections of their disjunctions. More problematic is that\nFales’s account does not provide a clear basis for accommodating\nNon-conjunctive specification, since as stated it is\ncompatible with a given determinate/species’ being conjunctively\nanalyzable into (for example) a genus and differentia, each associated\nwith a proper subset of the powers of the species. Even so,\nFales’ account of determination is a clear precursor of\nYablo’s (1992) essence-based\n account[28]\n and the powers-based account, to be next discussed. \nThe first explicitly powers-based account of determination is offered\nby Wilson (1999), as an application of a powers-based approach to the\nmetaphysical dependence (a.k.a. ‘realization’) at issue in\nphysicalism. She first motivates attention to powers (rather than\nsupervenience or epistemic notions, in particular) as a properly\nmetaphysical basis for characterizing realization; she then argues\nthat a variety of seemingly diverse non-reductive physicalist\naccounts, including Yablo’s determinable-based account, are\nsimilar in aiming to ensure that the powers of a realized property are\na proper subset of those of its realizing property (properties), in\nparticular. Hence: \nOne way to make [Yablo’s] conjecture more plausible is to put\nthe point in terms of the causal powers of the properties involved.\n[…] the reason why “determinables and their determinates\nare not causal rivals” is because it is plausible, in the case\nof determinables and determinates, that each causal power of the\ndeterminable is identical to a causal power of its determinate.\n[Moreover, and for example,] the property of being scarlet, which is a\ndeterminate of the property of being red, evidently has more causal\npowers than the property of being red. (1999: 47) \nThese considerations suggest the following first-pass powers-based\naccount of determination: \nPowers-based determination (first pass): Property \\(P\\)\ndetermines property \\(Q\\) iff \\(Q\\) is associated with a [non-empty]\nproper subset of the token powers associated with \\(P\\). \nOn this approach, a determinate is more specific than its determinable\n(as per Increased specificity) in being associated with a\nmore specific set of powers. Clarke (1999), Shoemaker (2001, 2007),\nand Clapp (2001) also maintain that determination is a case-in-point\nof a non-reductive realization relation satisfying the proper subset\ncondition on powers, where the powers associated with a given\ndeterminable property are those in the intersection of the sets of\npowers associated with its determinates. \nWilson (2012) moreover argues, contra MacDonald and MacDonald (1986),\nEhring (1996), and others, that determinables and determinates are\ntoken-distinct, since if they were token-identical, then determinable\ninstances would be associated with more powers than are associated\nwith their type—but that would be reason for denying that the\ninstance was of the determinable type. \n\nThis consideration also pushes against taking determinable types to be\nmetaphysically reducible to (identified with) disjunctive or other\nconstructions from determinates, since such reductive strategies\nentail that instances of determinables and determinates are\ntoken-identical. As such, and in particular, a powers-based approach\naccommodates Non-disjunctive specification. \nProponents of powers-based accounts have different ways of\naccommodating Non-conjunctive specification. \nOn Shoemaker’s version of a powers-based account of\nrealization/determination, Non-conjunctive determination is\nstipulated: \nProperty \\(X\\) realizes property \\(Y\\) just in case the conditional\npowers bestowed by \\(Y\\) are a subset of the conditional powers\nbestowed by \\(X\\) (and \\(X\\) is not a conjunctive property having\n\\(Y\\) as a conjunct). (2001: 78). \nWilson (2009) rather accommodates Non-conjunctive\nspecification by requiring that the powers in the complement of\nthe sets associated with a determinate and any of its determinates,\nrespectively, do not constitute a set associated with any property, as\nper her second-pass formulation: \nPowers-based determination (second pass): Property \\(P\\) determines\nproperty \\(Q\\) iff \\(Q\\) is associated with a [non-empty] proper\nsubset of the powers associated with \\(P\\), and the set of powers had\nby \\(P\\) but not by \\(Q\\) is not (uniquely) associated with any property. \nIn addition to Non-conjunctive specification\nand Non-disjunctive specification, a powers-based account of\ndetermination neatly accommodates most standard features of\ndetermination. Causal compatibility is accommodated, since\nevery power of a determinable instance is token-identical with a power\nof an associated determinate. A powers-based account also satisfies\nAsymmetry, Irreflexivity, and Transitivity,\nwhich are inherited as features of the proper subset relation between\npowers. Determinable inheritance is accommodated in that in\nhaving a determinate property with an associated set of powers, an\nobject will thereby have the determinables associated with proper\nsubsets of the determinate’s powers (assuming that properties\nare at least contingently individuated by associated powers; see below\nfor further discussion). Determination ‘in respect of’\ndeterminables and Determinate similarity/comparability\nare accommodated by determinates’ sharing the powers of their\nassociated determinable but having further powers, where the powers of\nthe determinable constitute the respect in which determinables are\nsimilar, and powers had by determinates but not the determinable serve\nas a basis for ordering the determinates by degree of similarity\n(i.e., determinates sharing more powers will be more similar). That\nsaid, more could be said about how the sharing of determinable powers\nmakes sense of how these additional powers count as being ‘in\nrespect of’ the determinable and its powers, and as providing a\nbasis for ordering by\n similarity.[29]\n Accommodation of Determinable similarity/orderability also\nprovides a basis for responding to concerns that irreducible\ndeterminables make no sense, since we cannot ‘get a grip’\non the difference-makers of determinates\n (see §3.2):\n on a powers-based view, the difference-makers are, comprehensibly,\nthe powers in the complement of determinate and determinable sets. A\npowers-based account does not itself ensure the accommodation of\neither Requisite determination or Unique\n determination,[30]\n but these omissions may ultimately be a virtue\n (see §5.3). \nA powers-based approach to determination faces two main concerns. One\nis that the view requires endorsement of a controversial “causal\ntheory” of properties, on which these are (following, e.g.,\nShoemaker 1980) essentially and exhaustively constituted by their\npowers; for if properties have non-causal quiddities (primitive\nidentities, which float modally free of powers), satisfaction of the\nproper subset condition on powers won’t guarantee that\ndeterminables are ‘nothing over and above’ determinates\n(see, e.g., Melnyk 2006: 141–43 and McLaughlin 2007), since the\nstatus of the determinable’s ‘quiddity’ is not\nthereby treated; nor will it explain Determinable\ninheritance, since satisfaction of the condition on powers is\ncompatible with the absence of the determinable quiddities. Here it is\nworth noting that while certain proponents (e.g., Clarke, Shoemaker,\nClapp) presuppose a causal theory of properties, such a commitment may\nbe dispensable: since non-causal quiddities are scientifically\ninaccessible and besides the point of solving the problem of\nhigher-level causation\n (see §5.2),\n their presence or absence is irrelevant to the status\nof determination (and more generally, realization) as a relation\nbetween broadly scientific properties (see Wilson 2011). \nA second concern with a powers-based approach is that, in\napplying only to broadly scientific goings-on, it doesn’t make\nsense of determination as holding between abstracta or other entities\nlacking powers. In response, a proponent of a powers-based account\nmight try to extend the approach beyond specifically causal powers to\none involving non-causal functional roles associated with, e.g., being\na number (determinable), and being a prime number (determinate). This\nextension remains speculative, however; at present the account is not\nfully general. \nIt is natural to think of irreducible determinables as in some sense\nshared parts or constituents of determinates. Such a view would\nprovide a natural way of accommodating Determinate\nsimilarity, Determinable inheritance, and other\nfeatures. A powers-based view might be seen as taking determinables or\nassociated powers to be constituent parts of determinates; here we\nconsider non-powers-based constitutional accounts. \nJohansson (2000, 2004) endorses a constitutive account of\ndeterminables—more precisely, of ‘maximal’\ndeterminables (such as color, shape, and smell) located at the top of\na determination hierarchy—taking Determinate similarity\nand Determinate gradability as its starting point. It is, he\nsays, characteristic of determinables and determinates that “two\ndifferent determinates of the same determinable can always be\ncontinuously connected” (2000: 108), in a way providing the\nbasis for the gradeable resemblance of the determinates. Conversely,\nJohansson maintains, determinates under wholly different determinables\nare not connected in this fashion: “No color-determinate\nresembles more closely a shape-determinate or volume-determinate than\nany other” (2000: 108). This ‘gap’ between\ndeterminables acts as a criterion, whereby a determinable is posited\nif and only if there is such a gap—hence it is that only maximal\ndeterminates exist, by lights of Johansson’s criterion. In cases\nwhere a determinable is appropriately posited, the determinable is\nshared by its determinates and explains their similarity; for example,\nall color-determinates have the determinable property color\nin common (Johansson 2000: sec. 3). Johansson’s view is a mixed\neliminativist/non-reductionist view, since he assumes that any\nnon-maximal determinables do not exist, but are merely “man-made\nconstructions” (2000: 113). Such a view is unmotivated, however,\nsince even in the absence of a ‘comparability gap’ between\nsame-level determinates (e.g., yellow and red, or yellow and scarlet),\none might still suppose that the difference between yellow and red (or\nscarlet) is not a matter of convention. Another concern with\nJohansson’s account reflects that the mere posit of a shared\ndeterminable does not (as Bigelow and Pargetter [1990] and Massin\n[2013] have observed) in itself make sense of determinable\ndifferences, though perhaps the appeal to the ‘continuous\nconnection’ between determinates can do some work here. \nWorley (1997) sketches a different sort of a constitution-based\naccount, as a way of supplementing Yablo’s (1992) asymmetrical\nnecessitation account. She illustrates with triangularity, analyzed as\ninvolving the constituent features associated with being a closed,\nthree sided plane figure, which features can vary in ways associated\nwith equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles, among others.\nWorley sees this as motivating a model of determination on which\n“the constituents of each determinable are proper subsets of the\nconstituents of each of their determinates”, such that, e.g.,\nthe determinable triangular and the determinate\nequilateral triangular would share features such as\nthree-sided and closed plane figure, but the latter\nwould be additionally constituted by equilateral. As Worley\nobserves, this account accommodates various features of determination,\nincluding Determinable inheritance:  \nThere can be no metaphysically possible world in which an instance of\na determinate can fail to be an instance of its determinable, since\nanything which is an instance of a determinate will be so in virtue of\nhaving certain features, which features will also be sufficient to\nmake that object an instance of the determinable. (1997: 290)  \nThe shared constituent features also provide a basis for\nDetermination ‘in respect of’ determinates and\nDeterminate similarity/comparability, and perhaps the\nadditional features of the determinates can provide a basis for\nDeterminate incompatibility. The main concern with\nWorley’s account is that it doesn’t accommodate\nNon-conjunctive determination, and in fact seems to require\nits denial. \n‘Grounding’ is a recently-introduced primitive relation or\nnotion of metaphysical dependence, taken to be operative in any\ncontext where such dependence is at issue (either as holding between\nfacts or propositions pertaining to some goings-on, or between worldly\ngoings-on themselves). Proponents of Grounding typically take\ndetermination to be a paradigm case of such dependence, with\ndeterminables being Grounded in determinates. For example, Correia\nsuggests that “the determinate features of a thing” are\nthe Grounds of “the determinable features of a thing”\n(2005: 49–50); Schaffer (2016b) takes a case of determination as\nthe primary exemplar of his ‘structural equations’\napproach to Grounding; and Rosen (2010) endorses the following\nprinciple: \nDeterminable-Determinate Link: If \\(G\\) is a determinate of\nthe determinable \\(F\\) and \\(a\\) is \\(G\\), then \\([Fa] \\leftarrow\n[Ga]\\) \nHere, \\([Fa] \\leftarrow [Ga]\\) stands for ‘the fact that \\(Fa\\)\nis Grounded in the fact that \\(Ga\\)’. \nThough Grounding is primitive, proponents stipulate that it has\nvarious features—most commonly, those of a strict partial order,\nin which case a Grounding-based account of determination will satisfy\nAsymmetry, Irreflexivity, and\n Transitivity.[31]\n The also-common assumption that Grounding entities metaphysically\nnecessitate Grounded entities accommodates Determinable\ninheritance. How to accommodate other features (including\nNon-conjunctive specification, Non-disjunctive\nspecification, Determination ‘in respect of’\ndeterminables, and so on) is less clear, since Grounding\ndoesn’t itself distinguish determination from other dependence\nrelations. \nCorrespondingly, the overriding concern with a Grounding-based account\nis that primitive Grounding alone fails to shed any substantive light\non determination, instead simply registering the common supposition\nthat determinables metaphysically depend on determinates in a way\nconforming to certain stipulated formal features. This concern is a\ncase-in-point of the more general concern raised in Wilson (2014),\naccording to which Grounding is too abstract to shed any useful\nmetaphysical light on its own. Some proponents of Grounding attempt to\nprovide more substance to a Grounding-based account of determination\nby deriving or modeling the claim that determinables are Grounded in\ndeterminates, but whether these attempts succeed is unclear; see,\ne.g., Schaffer’s (2016a,b) suggestion that determination can be\nmodeled using the apparatus of structural equations (à\nla Pearl 2000 and Spirtes and Scheines 1993), and reasons to\nresist that suggestion offered by Koslicki (2016) and Wilson\n(2016). \nWe now discuss three accounts which are best seen as elucidating\ncertain structural or broadly logical features of determination or\ndeterminates. \nFunkhouser’s (2006) property-space account (see his 2014 for\nfurther exposition) starts by filling in what it is to have a\ndeterminable “in a specific way” (Increased\nspecificity) by attention to ‘determination\ndimensions’—features along which a determinable may be\ndetermined, such as, e.g., hue, saturation, and\nbrightness in the case of color. The suggested\nmethodology for identifying determination dimensions of a given\ndeterminable is broadly empirical, and involves inquiring after\n“the ways in which determinates under the determinable \\(X\\) can\ndiffer from one another with regard to their \\(X\\)-ness” (2006:\n551), which suggestion picks up on both Determination ‘in\nrespect of’ determinables and Determinate\nincompatibility. \nFunkhouser then offers a model on which determination dimensions,\nassumed to have discrete or continuous ranges of values, serve as\ncoordinate axes of a ‘property space’ for a given\ndeterminable. The space as a whole corresponds to the determinable;\npoints in the space correspond to maximal determinates, associated\nwith specific assignments of values to each determination dimension;\nsubspaces of the space correspond to less than maximal determinates\n(which themselves may be determinables relative to contained subspaces\nor points). For example, color has determination dimensions\nhue, saturation, and brightness, such that,\ne.g., red determines color if and only if the\nproperty space of red is a proper subspace of the property\nspace of color. More generally: \nProperty \\(B\\) determines property \\(A\\) iff  \n‘Non-determinable necessities’ are those features of a\ndeterminable not allowing for variation (e.g., being three-sided, in\nthe case of triangularity); condition (2) registers that sharing of\nnon-determinable necessities is also required for determination, in\naddition to the increase in specificity associated with conditions (1)\nand (3), registering that determinates differ with respect to the\nvalues of one or more determination dimensions associated with the\ndeterminable. \nModeling determinates as subspaces of a determinable space\naccommodates many features of determination, including, to start,\nIncreased specificity, Determination in-respect-of\ndeterminables, Asymmetry, Irreflexivity, and\nTransitivity. Determinate incompatibility follows\nfrom subspaces’ being disjoint; Determinate\nsimilarity/comparability may be elucidated by reference to\nmetrics on the spaces, whereby subspaces of a determinable space may\nbe nearer or further apart. Funkhouser also aims to accommodate\nCausal compatibility by taking determinable and determinate\ninstances (tropes) to be identical. \nWith this latter claim, Funkhouser’s account moves into\nontological territory, and might be plausibly seen as a sophisticated\nvariation on a disjunctivist or other reductionist theme—say,\none elucidating the internal dimensional structure of determinate\ndisjuncts vis-á-vis associated\n determinables.[32]\n In any case, as with reductive accounts, Funkhouser’s\nassumptions that reality is ultimately maximally determinate and that\ndeterminable and determinate instances are token-identical are subject\nto challenge as either empirically inadequate or such as to not\nproperly accommodate the perceptual and other motivations for\ndeterminables. That said, it seems likely that the structural aspects\nof Funkhouser’s approach could be preserved even if these\nassumptions are relaxed, such that, e.g., ‘points’ in a\nproperty space aren’t taken to correspond to maximal\ndeterminates (see note 45). \nDenby (2001) presents a metric-space account of\n“determinables-together-with-their-determinates”, which\n“identifies abundant determinables and determinates with impure\nsets and the having relation with a set-theoretical relation”\n(2001: 316). Determinables are defined as follows: \n\\(F\\) is a determinable iff \\(F\\) is a pair \\(\\langle S, f\\rangle\\)\nwhere: \nHere a determinable is thought of as a “classification” of\nparticulars. The metric space \\(S\\) is a collection of points together\nwith a “distance” relation on these points; it defines the\npossible classificatory locations and how they are related. Each point\ncorresponds to a determinate of that determinable, and the distance\nrelation provides a measure of the similarities among them. The\nfunction \\(f\\) maps each concrete particular in its domain to a unique\npoint in the metric space. \nDeterminates are defined as follows: \n\\(F\\) is a determinate iff \\(F\\) is a pair \\(\\langle D, E_i\\rangle\\)\nwhere \nIn set-theoretic terms, a determinate is thought of as a\n“centered” classification of particulars, defined by a\ndeterminable and by the determinate’s extension. Denby moreover\nsees determinables as ultimately categorizing the possession of\nmaximal or “sparse”\n determinates;[33]\n as such, he interprets his model along anti-realist or reductionist\nlines. \nThis approach to determinables and determinates is attractive, Denby\nargues, in that sets are ontologically unproblematic and their\nidentity-conditions and relations well-understood (and similarly for\nfunctions and metric spaces), and in that the account accommodates\n“the pre-theoretic intuitions about the logical relations among\nproperties” (2001: 310), including Unique\n determination,[34]Determinate\n similarity/comparability,[35]\n and Determinate incompatibility. The primary\nconcerns here are again those associated with anti-realist or\nreductive views of determinables, though as with Funkhouser’s\naccount it might be that the broad structure of Darby’s metric\nconception of determinables is compatible with a non-reductivist\nreading. \nFine’s aim in his 2011 is to characterize “what it is for\nthe world to possess the kind of structure that it has when the\ndeterminate/determinable distinction is in play” (2011: 162),\ntaking as inspiration Wittgenstein’s post-Tractarian view, on\nwhich  \nthe atomic propositions might exhibit the kind of dependence that is\ncharacteristic of the way in which different determinants of a given\ndeterminable are exclusive of one another. (2011: 161)  \nFine’s project reflects the usefulness of Determinate\nincompatibility for his truthmaker semantics (Fine\n2012a,b)—most notably, in providing a non-similarity-based\naccount of the worlds entering into counterfactual deliberation, with\nthe general idea being that a counterfactual world will be just like\nthe actual world but for the replacement of some actual state \\(s\\)\nwith a state \\(s'\\) that is a determinate under the same determinable\nas \\(s\\). As such, Fine’s ultimate aim is to provide a\ndefinition of the ‘co-determinable’ relation between\nstates—a task which “avoids the tricky question of saying\nwhat exactly a determinable is” (2011: 184), though certain\nstructural characterizations of determinables fall out of his account.\nSince Fine’s approach to characterizing determinable-determinate\nstructure is rather intricate, we direct the interested reader to the\nattached\n footnote.[36] \nIt is commonly assumed that determinables, if they exist, are less\nfundamental than determinates. Of course, this assumption is true on\nreductionist\n accounts;[37]\n but even those taking determinables to be irreducible to determinates\noften suppose that the latter are prior to the former. In this section\nwe canvass reasons for and against taking determinates to be\nmetaphysically prior to determinables. \nOne criterion of priority takes it to be sufficient for some goings-on to be less\nfundamental than some others that the former are asymmetrically\nnecessitated by (or “metaphysically supervene on”) the\nlatter. As per Asymmetrical dependence, it is characteristic\nof determinates that they asymmetrically necessitate their associated\ndeterminables, thanks to the distinctively unspecific nature of\ndeterminables. Hence Armstrong says:  \nA point to be taken very seriously is that because determinates entail\nthe corresponding determinable, the determinable supervenes on the\ndeterminates, and so, apparently, is not something more than the\ndeterminates. (1997: 50) \nAsymmetric necessitation appears to be insufficient for\nnon-fundamentality, however, as is reflected in standard concerns that\nsupervenience is too weak to guarantee nothing-over-and-aboveness\n(see, e.g., Horgan 1993 and McLaughlin and Bennett\n2005). Nor is asymmetric necessitation necessary for the holding of a\npriority relation, as Fine’s (1994) case of Socrates and the\nsingleton set of Socrates shows. As such, one can reasonably deny that\nthe asymmetric necessitation of determinables by determinates\nestablishes that determinables are less fundamental than\ndeterminates. \nEven accepting the criterion, one can question whether it shows that\ndeterminates are metaphysically prior to determinables. As French\n(2014) observes, while determinable instances do not entail any\nparticular determinate instances, there is nevertheless\n‘two-way’ entailment: every determinate instance entails\ndeterminable instances, and every determinable instance entails some\ndeterminate instance. One might respond that the word\n‘some’ expresses residual asymmetry in priority as opposed\nto simply reflecting that determinables are less specific than\ndeterminates, but as French notes, “those who exclude\ndeterminables from the fundamental base need to show what specificity\nhas to do with fundamentality” (2014: 284). \nAnother criterion takes more fundamental properties to be more\n‘natural’, in the terminologically\n inapropos[38]\n meaning of Lewis (1983), in making for greater objective resemblance\nbetween their possessing particulars than do less fundamental\nproperties. This conception appears to deem determinables less\nfundamental than determinates: since determinables are less specific\nthan their associated determinates, particulars sharing a given\ndeterminate property (e.g., scarlet) will be more objectively\nsimilar in the relevant respect than will be particulars sharing an\nassociated determinable property (e.g., red). As Wilson\n(2012) notes, however, objective resemblance can hold between\nproperties as well as particulars; hence even granting that\ndeterminates make for more objective resemblance between particulars,\none can reasonably maintain that among the perfectly natural joints\nare those associated with \ndeterminables.[39] \nSuch a consideration would support McDaniel's (2010) supposition that\nthe increase in specificity at issue in determination differs from\nthat at issue in the disjunction-disjunct relation, in that\ndeterminables, unlike disjunctions, are as natural as their\nspecifications.\n \nFinally, consider a criterion of fundamentality—associated with\nintuitive “all God had to do” scenarios—according to\nwhich fundamental entities fix all the rest. This criterion again\nseems to support taking determinates to be prior to determinables, for\nonce the specific, or determinate, facts are fixed, then, it seems,\nmore general/determinable facts are thereby fixed, with the latter\nbeing at best ontologically real abstractions from the former. By way\nof contrast, fixing the determinable facts does not fix the\ndeterminate facts (as is reflected in Asymmetric\ndependence). \nAs Wilson (2012) argues, however, that determinable facts are fixed by\ndeterminate facts is undermined by attention to the constitutive modal\nfact about any given determinable instance—say, that instance of\nred—that it is of a type that might have been\ndifferently determined—say, by scarlet rather than\nmaroon. Here the suggestion is that no determinate fact or\ncomplex combination of such facts can provide a non-gerrymandered\nbasis for such a constitutive modal fact.[40] \nOne response is to maintain that a fundamental base need only ground\nthe contingent non-modal facts at a world, as Schaffer (2004: 90)\nsuggests; if so, then the failure of determinate instances to ground\ncertain modal facts about determinable instances won’t impugn\nthe priority of determinates. Still, one might maintain\nthat a supposed “ground” for some entity which failed to\nprovide a metaphysical basis for modal facts constitutive of the\nentity would be incomplete, at best. As French puts it,  \nfixing the non-modal facts and leaving modal flexibility out of the\npicture would yield an incomplete inventory. And the most obvious way\nof fixing the modal facts would be to include the determinables\nthemselves in the fundamental base. (2014: 284)  \nThere is a worry that this line of\nthought will overgenerate, in that many higher-level features and\nobjects (e.g., tables) are to some extent constitutively modally\nflexible; a possible response is that whether the line of thought\napplies to a given case will depend on whether the basis for the modal\nflexibility is itself derivable or otherwise clearly generated by\nlower-level goings-on. \nThe previous considerations suggest that some determinable features of reality might be\nfundamental, or as fundamental as determinate features. This result\nraises several questions, answers to which have implications for our\nunderstanding of determinables and determinates, and of the\nfundamental. \nOne question pertains to whether the determinates associated with\nfundamental determinables are also part of the fundamental base. It\nseems so; for even granting that determinates cannot completely ground\ndeterminables, determinates seem also to be needed to be existential\nwitnesses for more specific goings-on. In that case, a further\nquestion arises concerning how determinables and determinates jointly\nparticipate in a fundamental base. Wilson (2012) suggests that a model\nfor understanding such joint founding may be found in the sciences,\nand more specifically in how general scientific laws combine with\ninitial or boundary conditions (15–16), an analogy developed by\nFrench, who maintains that “scientific determinables and\ndeterminates jointly enter into the fundamental base for everything\nelse” (2014: 285) \nA further question concerns whether existing non-reductionist accounts\nof determinables can make sense of these being fundamental. On the\nface of it, there is no special difficulty with accommodating\nfundamental determinables on either powers-based or constitution-base\naccounts of determination, or with such accounts’ making sense\nof joint determinable/determinate founding. On Johansson’s\n(2000) account, for example, it might be that determinates depend on\ndeterminables in that the latter are constitutive parts of the former\n(nota bene: not obeying weak supplementation), and\ndeterminables depend on determinates in that, modulo gappy quantum\nindeterminacy\n (see §5.3),\n determinable instances must be parts of some determinate whole. \nThat determinables and determinates may be jointly fundamental has\nimplications for our understandings of fundamentality and metaphysical\ndependence. Fundamental entities are commonly assumed to be\nindependent, in being wholly distinct, and (relatedly, as per\n‘Hume’s Dictum’) in being such that each can either\nexist together or exist apart. But if determinables and determinates\ncan be equally fundamental, this understanding is incorrect; for given\nthe intimate relationship between determinables and determinates, to\nsay that these are equally fundamental is evidently not to say either\nthat they are wholly distinct or (even granting Hume’s Dictum)\nmodally independent. Moreover, if determinables and determinates can\nmutually found each other, other stipulated suppositions are called\ninto question—e.g., that the fundamental entities are those that\ndo not depend on any other entities, and that metaphysical dependence\nis asymmetric. \nThe possibility of fundamental determinables also bears on various\nfirst-order metaphysical topics. For example, Paul (2002, 2012)\nendorses a one-category ontology (‘mereological bundle\ntheory’), on which properties and relations are fundamental, and\nproperty composition is “the fundamental glue” (2012:\n242). Paul allows that determinables might be among the fundamental\nproperties and relations (note 22), and moreover suggests that such\nposits may be required to accommodate theories couched in terms of\nproperties and relations which are “extremely abstractly\nspecified” (2012: 245). \nWe now canvass three among many topics in metaphysics where attention\nto determinables and determinates has played a significant\n role.[41] \nAs mentioned previously, several philosophers have seen determinables\nand determinates as relevant to our understanding of laws of nature in\nboth physics and the special sciences. Armstrong (1997) argues that\nirreducible determinables are needed to make sense of functionally\nspecified laws in physics. Consider Newton’s law of\ngravitation: \nAs Armstrong notes (see also Fales 1990: 61 and French 2014),\nsubstitution of the determinable quantities \\(F\\), \\(M\\), and \\(D\\)\nwith determinate values gives rise to “a law which stands as\ndeterminate to the original, determinable, law” (1997: 63). One\nmight try to provide an anti-realist or reductionist treatment of\nthese seemingly determinable laws. Armstrong (1997) argues, however,\nthat such deflationary treatments cannot make sense of the role of\nfunctional laws in sustaining counterfactuals, at least if properties\nare Aristotelian universals, whose existence depends upon their being\ninstantiated; for then there will typically (and perhaps necessarily,\nfor the case of continuous quantities) be gaps in the actual\ninstantiations of functional laws. As such, the unity of determinates\nin these cases involves not just partial identities (as discussed in\n §3.4)\n but “strictly identical second-order properties”, which\nare the “real […] determinables” (1997: 247).\nFunctional laws of nature are then taken to be relations between these\ndeterminable universals. \nFrench offers a structuralist account of laws of nature as expressing\ndeterminable relations. As regards the above law, he says: \nIf we insert specific values […], we obtain a determinate\ninstance of the law, expressing the relation that holds between\ndeterminate properties. So, the law as a whole can be regarded as\nexpressing a determinable relation, which can be made determinate in\nspecific situations. (2014: 300) \nAgain, French allows that determinable laws/relations may be\nfundamental. Reflecting that one reason for taking (some)\ndeterminables to be fundamental is that these are partly constituted\nby modal facts pertaining to their possible determinations, French\nmoreover suggests that the determinable nature of laws provides a\nbasis for physical modality:  \nthese determinate instances correspond to solutions that can be\nrepresented by (more) specific models of the theory, and it is the\nshared structure between these models that yields the relevant\nphysical modality. The relationship between the more generic and more\nspecific models can be captured by that between determinables and\ndeterminates. (2014: 300) \nAnother application of determination to the metaphysics of laws\nconcerns whether these are contingent, in having at best a restricted\nphysical or nomological modality, or rather are metaphysically\nnecessary. Kistler (2005) argues that such laws are metaphysically\nnecessary, first arguing that the quantities in ‘laws of\nassociation’ such as the ideal gas law are reasonably seen as\ndifferent determinables of the same determinate states, such that such\nlaws are necessary; then generalizing on the base of systematicity\nconsiderations to other kinds of\n laws.[42] \nHow can mental goings-on bring about physical effects, as they seem to\ndo, given that the physical realizers of mental goings-on are already\nsufficient to cause these effects? This question gives rise to the\nproblem of mental (more generally, higher-level) causation, encoding\ntwo threats: first, that mental properties, if efficacious, give rise\nto problematic causal overdetermination; second, that avoiding\noverdetermination requires that mental properties be causally excluded\nby their realizers. Overdetermination and exclusion are avoided if\nmental and physical goings-on are identical, but in that case it\nseems that mental goings-on are not efficacious qua mental\n(see Horgan 1989); as Yablo puts it: “Mental events are\neffective, maybe, but not by way of their mental properties”\n(1992: 249). Moreover, type\nidentity seems at odds with the multiple realizability of mental\nproperties. \nSome, including MacDonald and MacDonald (1986), Yablo (1992), Wilson\n(1999), and Shoemaker (2001), have suggested that a better response\nproceeds by taking mental properties to be determinables of their\nphysical\n realizers.[43] \nThe appeal to determination reflects various\nfeatures of determinates and determinables, including Causal\ncompatibility. As Yablo says,  \n[W]e know that [determinables and determinates] are not causal rivals.\n[…] Determinables and their determinates, like objects and\ntheir parts, are guaranteed to be on the same team. (1992: 259)  \nMoreover, determinables are typically multiply determined, and given\nthat determinables and determinates are type- and perhaps also\ntoken-distinct, one can argue\n (see §3.5)\n that determinables are distinctively efficacious. If mental\nproperties are determinables of physical realizers, these features are\ninherited: as causal non-competitors, overdetermination is avoided\nwhile accommodating multiple realizability, compatible with the\ndistinctness and distinctive efficacy of mental properties. Similar\nconsiderations apply to other higher-level goings-on, in which case\nrealization might be determination, more generally. \nA determinable-based approach to realization is subject to two main\nconcerns (besides those generally targeting a powers-based account;\n see §3.5), \neach aiming to show that realization cannot be determination, since\nrealization lacks some key feature of determination (see Ehring 1996;\nFunkhouser 2006, 2014; Walter 2007; and Worley 1997). First is the\nargument from mental multiple realizability, according to which such\nrealizability effectively violates Determination ‘in respect\nof’ determinables (entailing that determinates differ in\nrespect of determinables), since  \nMental properties are said to be multiply realizable precisely because\ndistinct physical realizers can be exactly the same with respect to\nthe mental property they realize, (Walter 2007: 219)  \nin which case  \n[T]he physical realizers of the mental will not differ mentally at\nall, as they should if they are determinates of the requisite mental\nstates. (Ehring 1996: 474)  \nSecond is the argument from mental superdeterminates, according to\nwhich a mental property could be maximally specified qua\nmental—as, e.g., a precise state of searing pain (Ehring), or a\nbelief maximally specified along the dimensions of content and\nconfidence (Funkhouser); but if realization is determination, this\nwould falsely imply that mental super-determinates could be further\ndetermined. \nWilson (2009) responds to these concerns by analogical attention to\ncolor metamerism, in which colors of the same hue, saturation and\nbrightness can differ in respect of color, and are moreover reasonably\ntaken to have physical determination dimensions. One metameric moral\nis that properties such as color may have physical\ndetermination dimensions; a second is that which determination\ndimensions are had by a given higher-level property may be\nscience-relative. Applying the morals: there is no in-principle\nproblem with mental properties’ having physical determination\n dimensions;[44]\n moreover, which dimensions are associated with mental properties may\nbe science-relative. This allows accommodation of mental multiple\nrealizability: mental properties with diverse physical realizers can\nbe exactly alike, relative to the determination dimensions associated\nwith psychology, compatible with these mental properties being\ndifferent, relative to a lower-level physical science distinguishing\nthese realizers. And given that different sciences may treat a single\ndeterminable as having different determination dimensions, mental\nproperties may be super-determinate relative to a purely psychological\nscience, while being further determined relative to a lower-level\nscience. \nA powers-based implementation of the metameric\n morals[45]\n also provides a basis for a response to a third objection, due to\nWorley (1997), according to which the constituents of beliefs are not\nconstituents of their physical realizers, as they would have to be if\n(as per Worley’s constitution-based account;\n see §3.5)\n beliefs were determinables of physical\n determinates.[46]\n Supposing that constituents are associated with sets of powers, the\ncontent of a belief may be a constituent of its physical realizers,\nafter all—not qua content per se, but\nqua the relevant subset of powers. \nMany phenomena appear to be indeterminate: macro-objects (clouds,\nmountains) appear to have imprecise boundaries; the future, it seems,\nmight be genuinely open; on certain interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, some properties of a system (e.g., position and momentum,\northogonal spin components) cannot jointly have precise values. In\nthese and other cases there are reasons to think that the\nindeterminacy is metaphysical, as opposed to merely semantic or\nepistemic. Elder (1996) suggests that determinables might be useful\nfor purposes of making sense of “the idea that corresponding to\n(at least some) vague predicates there really are, in the world, vague\nproperties” (1996: 150). Wilson (2013) more\nspecifically argues that determinables and determinates provide the\nbasis for an account of metaphysical indeterminacy (MI) having several\nadvantages, including being reductive, compatible with classical\nlogic, and such as to make systematic sense of MI in a wide range of\ncases, as follows: \nDeterminable-based MI: For a SOA to be metaphysically\nindeterminate in a given respect \\(R\\) at a time \\(t\\) is for the SOA\nto constitutively involve an object (entity) \\(O\\) such that (i) \\(O\\)\nhas a determinable property \\(P\\) at \\(t\\), and (ii) for some level\n\\(L\\) of determination of \\(P\\), \\(O\\) does not have a unique\nlevel-\\(L\\) determinate of \\(P\\) at \\(t\\). \nOne application of Determinable-based MI is to macro-object\nboundary MI; here the conditions are satisfied in ‘glutty’\nfashion, reflecting that macro-objects typically have multiple\noverlapping realizers, as with Mount Everest and the multiple\noverlapping aggregates of rock in its vicinity at any given time. On\nthe suggested approach, Mount Everest has a determinable boundary\nproperty, but no unique determinate boundary property, since there are\ntoo many candidate determinates of the determinable, associated with\nthe comparatively precise boundaries of its realizing aggregates (at\nbest, these determinate boundaries can be attributed to Mount Everest\nin relativized\n fashion).[47] \nDeterminable-based MI is also usefully applied to the case of\nvalue indeterminacy on (some interpretations of) quantum mechanics. As\nDarby (2010) and Skow (2010) argue, ‘metaphysical\nsupervaluationist’ accounts of MI (see Akiba 2004, Barnes 2010,\nWilliams 2008, and Barnes and Williams 2011) cannot accommodate such\nMI. On these accounts MI is effectively understood as primitive\nunsettleness about which maximally precise world or state of affairs\nis the case; but as Darby and Skow observe, such an approach cannot\nmodel quantum MI, since the Kochen-Specker theorem rules out\nsimultaneously assigning definite values to all properties of a\nquantum system. \nBy way of contrast, Determinable-based MI is compatible with\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem (and more generally, Heisenberg’s\nuncertainty principle), since as discussed by Bokulich (2014) and\nWolff (2015), one way for a given determinable to fail to be uniquely\ndetermined is if no candidate determinate is present or instantiated,\nas the Kochen-Specker theorem suggests can be the case. As Wolff puts\nit for the case of spin value indeterminacy:  \nPermitting the instantiation of determinables without determinates\nhelps to describe this phenomenon, because we can say that \\(x\\)-spin\nand \\(y\\)-spin are determinables with two determinates each, and\n[after a spin-\\(z\\) measurement] neither of these determinates is\ninstantiated even though the determinables “spin-\\(x\\)”\nand “spin-\\(y\\)” are. (2015:\n 385)[48] \nAs Wolff goes on to note, a determinable-based account doesn’t\nresolve all the mysteries associated with quantum MI; on the other\nhand, our experiential and theoretical familiarity with determinables\ngoes considerable distance towards rendering such MI\nintelligible—offering, along the way, a nice case-in-point of\nhow determinables may be useful for purposes of illuminating the\nstructure of natural reality.","contact.mail":"jessica.m.wilson@utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"utoronto.ca"}]
