In this article, the term “Tiantai” will be used\nto refer to the philosophical ideas developed from the sixth to\neleventh centuries by this school, as expounded in the writings of its\nthree most representative figures: Tiantai Zhiyi (538–597),\nJingxi Zhanran (711–782) and Siming Zhili (960–1028).\n\nTo translate Tiantai’s rather technical scholastic terminology and\nits typically Buddhist soteriological orientation into something\napproaching traditional philosophical categories, we can start by\nidentifying a few hashtag themes that are characteristic of Tiantai\nthinking. Tiantai is: a thoroughgoing contextualism, a thoroughgoing\nholism, a thoroughgoing monism, and a theory of absolute immanence. It\nasserts an exceptionless impermanence, exceptionless\nanti-substantialism, and exceptionless ambiguity of identity for all\nfinite and conditional entities. Epistemologically this entails\nthoroughgoing skepticism about all unconditional claims, and\nthoroughgoing anti-realism. Ethically it implies a thoroughgoing\nrenunciation of all finite aims, as well as thoroughgoing repudiation\nof all determinate moral rules, moral consequences, and moral\nvirtues. \n\nBut our understanding of each of these points must be thoroughly\nmodified by the most characteristic premise of Tiantai thought of all,\nwhich determines the meaning we intend for the term “\nthoroughgoing” here: the idea of\n“self-recontextualization”, whereby the full expression of\nany element of experience, indeed of any determinate entity at all,\nintrinsically entails its self-overcoming. This turn of thought may be\ntermed dialectical, but in a way that differs from both\nHegelian and Marxian notions of dialectics in that it is neither\nteleologically progressive nor hierarchical. It has roots in 1)\nindigenous Chinese interest in the “reversals” observed in\nthe cycles of nature, conceptualized according to the naïve\nancient generalization that when anything is pushed its own extreme it\nwill “reverse”, that an increase in a thing’s extension or\nintensity leads to its self-undermining (e,g., it keeps getting colder\nuntil it gets coldest, and then it starts getting warmer), and in 2)\nthe sophisticated ruminations on the nature of conditionality\ndeveloped in the Emptiness and Two Truths doctrines as expressed in\nIndian Buddhist logic. What this means is that “thoroughgoing\ncontextualism” will in Tiantai reverse into an\nassertion of the self-validation of every entity without exception,\nthat “thoroughgoing holism” will in Tiantai self-reverse\nalso into thoroughgoing individualism, “thoroughgoing\nmonism” also into thoroughgoing pluralism, “thoroughgoing\nimmanentism” also into thoroughgoing transcendentalism, along\nwith a claim that these two extremes are, when fully thought through,\nactually synonyms for one another. It will mean that for all finite\nconditional entities, exceptionless impermanence is seen to be also\nexceptionless eternalism, exceptionless anti-substantialism is seen to\nbe also exceptionless substantialism, exceptionless anti-realism is\nseen to be also exceptionless realism, again supplemented by a claim\nabout the interchangeability of these two seemingly opposed\nclaims. Similarly, thoroughgoing skepticism about all claims is seen\nto be also a thoroughgoing “trivialism” (the claim that\nall possible claims are true), thoroughgoing anti-realism also a\nfanatically absolute realism even for the most fleeting appearances,\nthoroughgoing renunciation of finite aims, moral rules, moral\nconsequences and moral virtues is seen to be also an exceptionless\nacceptance of all finite aims and the endorsement of all determinate\nmoral rules, consequences and virtues. \n\nWhen the dust from these turnarounds settles, Tiantai ends up with\na unique view of the structure of reality: every event, function or\ncharacteristic occurring in any experience anywhere is the action of\nall sentient and insentient beings working together. Every instant of\nexperience is the whole of reality manifesting in this particular\nform, as this particular entity or experience. Each such\ninstant is however no mere accidental, dispensable form; rather, it is\nitself unconditional and ineradicable, is eternal and omnipresent.\nMoreover, this “whole of reality” is irreducibly multiple\nand irreducibly unified at once, in the following way: all possible\nconflicting, contrasted and axiologically varied aspects are\nirrevocably present—in the sense of\n“findable”—in and as each of these individual\ndeterminate totality-effects. Good and evil, delusion and\nenlightenment, Buddhahood and deviltry, are all “inherently\nentailed” in each and every event. These multiple entities are\nnot “simply located” even virtually or conceptually: the\n“whole” which is the agent performing every experience is\nnot a collection of these various “inherently entailed”\nentities or qualities arrayed side by side, like coins in a pocket.\nRather, they are “intersubsumptive”. That is, any one of\nthem subsumes all the others, and yet, because of the view of what\n“subsumption” actually is, each is subsumed by each of the\nothers as well: all relation is subsumption, and all subsumption is\nintersubsumption. Each part is the whole, each quality subsumes all\nother qualities, and yet none are ever eradicable. A Buddha in the\nworld makes the world all Buddha, saturated in every locus with the\nquality “Buddhahood”; a devil in the world makes the world\nall devil, permeated with “deviltry”. Both Buddha and\ndevil are always in the world. So every event in the world is always\nboth entirely Buddhahood and entirely\ndeviltry. Every moment of experience is always completely delusion,\nevil and pain, through and through, and also completely enlightenment,\ngoodness and joy, through and through. \n\nTraditional Buddhism gives a rather commonsensical account of\nsentient experience: every moment of sentient experience is a sensory\napparatus encountering an object, giving rise thereby to a particular\nmoment of contentful awareness. But in the Tiantai view, each of these\nthree—sense organ, object, this moment of consciousness—is\nitself the Absolute, the entirety of reality, expressed without\nremainder in the peculiar temporary form of sense organ, of object, of\nthis consciousness. Hence each moment of every being’s experience is\nredescribed, to paraphrase a canonical early Tiantai work, as follows:\n\nThe absolute totality encounters the absolute\ntotality, and the result is the arising of the absolute\ntotality. (法界對法界起法界)\n\nThe Absolute, the whole of reality, is one and\neternal, always the same and omnipresent, but it is also the kind of\nwhole that divides from itself, encounters itself, arises anew each\nmoment, engenders itself as the transient flux of each unique\nand individual moment of experience of every sentient being.\n\n How this view is established, and what its consequences are, is\nwhat is to be explained in this article.\n\nThe meta-level claim about self-recontextualization as\nself-reversal, which applies at all levels to all Tiantai doctrines,\nis itself the consequence of some considerations concerning\ncontextualism, holism and conditionality, with which it is thus\nconvenient to begin our exposition. The heart of the matter, the most\nfundamental and far-reaching renovation of Buddhism accomplished by\nthe Tiantai School, is the move from the Two Truths model to\na Three Truths one. The Two Truths is an epistemological and\npedagogical heuristic in most Mahāyāna Buddhism, but in Tiantai the\nThree Truths are taken to be a necessary logical entailment of any\nproposed determinacy, and thus to apply equally to any possible\nontological, epistemological and ethical entities. They can be\nsummarized by the claim that no entity can be either the same as or\ndifferent from any other entity. This relation of\nneither-sameness-nor-difference is the “asness” relation:\neach determinate thing is the totality of all other possible\nthings as this thing. The non-sameness implies that the\nspecific characteristics of all other things are in some sense\ndiscoverable in each thing, that all their manifold properties and\nfunctions will also be simultaneously operative there.  We can reconstruct the argument for this claim as follows: From this we can perhaps see in what way Tiantai is able to\nstipulate at once the self-preserving and the self-overcoming of both\nholism and apophasis. First, atomism of any kind is rejected as\nunintelligible, and a thorough contextualism asserted: things can only\nbe determinate in relation to a context, and there can be no\nnon-arbitrary limiting of the extent and multiplicity of contexts,\nsince each context will itself be intelligible only with respect to a\nlarger context. This would seem to lead to a holism of some sort: each\napparently isolable thing is really an aspect or expression of some\nmore inclusive whole, and each of these finite wholes must be an\naspect or expression of a still more inclusive whole. The part is\ndependent on the whole, the conditional is dependent on the\nunconditional. But the unconditional can have no specific separate\nidentity, not even as “the unconditional per\nse”. Any determination for the whole turns out to\nself-overturn into other determinations, precisely due to its success\nin being a determination for the exceptionless whole. For example,\nThales says the world is made of water. This is stipulated after first\nisolating other lesser wholes: water, earth, fire, air. Each of these\nwas already a finite whole, involving an alleged collapse from\nappearance to a deeper reality: what appeared to be trees and stones\nand pillars turned out to be part of the larger whole\n“earth”, ways in which earth appears or manifests; what\nappeared to be body-heat and flames and sunshine turned out to be part\nof the larger whole “fire”, ways in which fire appears or\nmanifests. Now Thales says both of these are really parts of a larger\nwhole “water”, ways in which it appears and manifests. But\neach of these generalizing claims involves a meaning-change\nfor the term in question. “Water” initially meant\n“what is not fire, earth, wind, which excludes them,\nwhat is contrasted to them”. After Thales, “water”\nmeans also “what expresses itself sometimes as watery, sometimes\nas fiery, sometimes as earthy, sometimes as windy”. Along comes\nHeraclitus and claims that all is really\n“fire”. “Fire” now means also “what\nexpresses itself sometimes as watery, sometimes as fiery, sometimes as\nearthy, sometimes as windy”. What is intended in claims of this\ntype, allowing them to appear to be doing explanatory work, is the\nmaintenance of a distinction between which of these expressions is\nprimary and which secondary, which direct and indirect; but Tiantai\nwould deny that this distinction can be meaningfully maintained once\nthis totalization has been effected.  Because each now means the\nwhole, they lose their original meaning, for that meaning was entirely\ndependent on a contrast to what was excluded. If fire is everything,\nthen fire is not fire. If water is everything, then water is not\nwater. If fire is everything, then water is really fire. If water is\neverything, then fire is really water. If fire is really water, then\nwater is really fire. Hence by going through the universalization\nof any determinate entity, we reach the overturning of that\ndetermination into something that expresses itself as all other\ndeterminations, and at the same time undermines its own privileged\nstatus as ultimate foundation, making all other possible\ndeterminations equally unconditional, all-pervasive, universal,\nabsolute. To see the absoluteness of any one entity is thus to\nde-absolutize that entity and also to absolutize every other\nentity. The Three Truths position of Tiantai derives from a particular\nunderstanding of the Two Truths doctrine advanced by Indian Buddhist\nphilosophers of the Mādhyamaka school, interpreted as holding that any\nspecific thing we could say about the world was at best a\n“Conventional Truth”, which served as a kind of\n“raft” to get beyond it to the “Ultimate\nTruth” of Emptiness—determinations of any kind were thus\nat best an indispensible means to get beyond themselves, to be\ndiscarded when their work is done. The stipulation of Emptiness\n(Śūnyatā) was itself a raft to get beyond not only all other\ndeterminate views but also Emptiness itself as a “view” or\ntheory or concept. Ultimate Truth, true realization of Emptiness, was\nthus at best a celebratory term used to point to an ineffable\nexperience of the liberation from all views, all definite conceptions\nof determinate “things”. The motivation for this was\nsoteriological in a specific, pan-Buddhist sense: the goal of all\nhuman endeavor, including philosophy, including ethics, including\nepistemology, is assumed to be the reduction or elimination of\nsuffering. Buddhism claims that this is what we’re always trying to\ndo, but usually in a self-defeating, ignorant way; it claims to\nprovide a more effective way.  Note that this does not make any claim\nabout what is valuable, but rather addresses what is assumed to be a\nnecessary entailment of what it means to consider anything valuable,\ni.e., what structures desire qua desire. To desire is to value, and\nsuffering is simply the non-satisfaction of our desire. Hence all\nendeavors are endeavors to eliminate some suffering, i.e., to satisfy\na desire. The characteristic Buddhist contribution is then to note\nthat desiring any conditional object or state is necessarily\nself-defeating. This is because to be conditional is to be brought\ninto being by a qualitatively distinct, heterogeneous and extrinsic\ncause. But examined closely, this cannot be a single\nextrinsic cause, for if any effect were produced by a single cause,\nthat cause and that effect would always be copresent—wherever\nand whenever that cause occurred, the effect would also occur. But\nthat would mean that the cause would therefore no longer be extrinsic\nto the effect; they would be, rather, necessary and intrinsically\nconjoined, actually two aspects of a single irreducible entity, which\nwould mean that no causal event actually ever occurs. This means that\nall conditional things require multiple causes, each of which itself\nrequires multiple causes.  This introduces an intrinsic instability and inner conflict into\nwhatever exists conditionally, that is, whatever is finite, whatever\nis determinate. The unconditional would have to be omnipresent and\nomnitemporal and indeterminate. But the nature of desire is to have\nspecific conditions of satisfaction: to desire is to require some one\nstate of affairs rather than, to the exclusion of,\nsome other state of affairs—minimally, pleasure instead of\npain. This means all desire qua desire is desire for something\nconditional; otherwise there would be no need for the desire, since\nthe desired state would already always and everywhere be\npresent. Desire desires a single effect to the exclusion of any other\neffect; but the denial of effectivity for any single cause\nalso implies that what is produced by any causal process can never be\nonly a single effect. For since what is produced is not\ndependent solely on any single cause, or indeed any finite set of\ncauses considered as a unit, the production of a new event always\nrequires the conjunction with some hitherto excluded condition. Since\nby hypothesis this new condition is not a consistent part of the\noriginal set, it will not always be the same, and thus the effect will\nnot be one and the same; every conjunction will produce its own\neffects, and by hypothesis there is no limit to the set of\nconjunctions (for that would make them simply a single cause). Less\nrigorously, it is held that the cross-purposes and conflicting\ntendencies thus built into any effect make it impossible for it to be\na stably homogenous entity consistently isolable from the opposite\nconditional states it means to exclude, such as is required by the\nexclusive structure of specific desires. Whatever is desired must be\nidentifiably present at a particular time and place, and whatever is\nsuch is conditional, and whatever is conditional entails impermanence,\nand thus suffering.   The pan-Buddhist denial of the existence of a “self”\nrests on the same point: the impossibility of single-cause causal\nevents. For the “self” rejected here is precisely the\nclaimant to single-causality: the agent of actions which putatively\nrequires no second condition to produce an effect, e.g., to will\nsomething, to do something, to want something, to experience\nsomething. The self never acts alone, has no independent effects, and\nthus actually is not a self-as-efficacious-agent. “Self”\nhere essentially means “controller”. Because there is no\nsingle causality, there is no single controller, and thus no self. For\nthis reason too, satisfaction of desire is not sustainable. For in\ndoing what the self desires, other causes besides the activity of the\nself are always also involved; the effect is not in the self’s\ncontrol, and thus will inevitably contravene its desires, its own\ncausal contributions to the effect. Indeed, the early Buddhist\nanalysis of the human condition amounts to the claim that all desire\nis really a proxy-version of this impossible desire for control, for\nsingle-agent causality, for pure autonomy, for selfhood; thus all\ndesire is doomed.  The same considerations have serious epistemological consequences\nas well. The Buddhists viewed theoretical stances and philosophical\npositions as themselves objects of desire, of clinging. Since all such\nstances are themselves specific, determinate, they are ipso\nfacto conditional. As conditional, they are ipso facto\nsuffering. Hence attachment to views was seen as a form of suffering\nand an obstacle to liberation. All determinate metaphysical views\nabout how or what things are were to be transcended and left\nbehind. In most of the dominant Indian theories, those ideas are granted\ntemporary validity as conventional truths: they are to serve as\n“rafts”, to be clung to temporarily, but only because they\nare an effective means of passing beyond themselves. This includes\nboth specific Buddhist doctrines and also ordinary conventional speech\n(necessary for even communicating Buddhist ideas). Whatever ideas do\nnot lead to their own abandonment in this way (and hence do not lead\nto the end of suffering) do not count even as conventional\ntruths—for example, 1) metaphysical and religious theories about\nthe Absolute, or unconditional claims about the world as a whole and\n2) non-conventional views of things in the world, claims that\ncontravene ordinary language of the community.  There tends to be a\nkind of hierarchy in the Indian Two Truths theory: first, plain\nfalsehood, including all philosophical theories about reality and\nunconventional views. Then conventional truth, which includes ordinary\ndaily life ideas about self and other, cause and effect and so on, and\nalso Buddhist ideas about suffering, the Four Noble Truths, non-self,\nand even “Emptiness” considered as a concept. These ideas\nlead beyond themselves, instrumentally, to the experience of\nEmptiness, which is liberation from all views. The conventional truths\nhad an instrumental value, but none were really “true”\nabout things—Emptiness meant that all of them were, in the most\nultimate sense, false. Also, there are really only one or two kinds of\nconventional truth: first, common sense daily speech, the correct\ngeneral names for things as used in the daily life of your particular\ncommunity, and second, Buddhist ideas. The reason these count as\n“truths” is because they are useful in leading us to\nliberation from suffering—and in leading us to liberation from\nthese ideas themselves. “True” propositions are\npropositions that have the power to lead beyond themselves. This led to a somewhat paradoxical situation, on several\nlevels. There was always a problem in Emptiness theory: Emptiness was\nsupposed to be not a “view” at all, to predicate nothing\nabout reality. But if it does anything at all, if\nit negates or excludes any other view, it is, in the Tiantai\nview, still a kind of view. For to be something in particular is just\nto exclude something else in particular. That is all a\n“thing” is, that is all a “view” is. To be\nsomething just is to exclude something else; nothing more is\nrequired to count as a being. Pre-Tiantai Emptiness theory gets into\nan infinite regress, chasing its tail around the problem of the\ntranscendence of Emptiness: no statement can represent it, even\n“all things are Empty”. It is purely and totally above and\nbeyond anything that can be thought or said, all ordinary experience\nof identities in the world. It is a negation that is supposed to bear\nno relation at all to what it negates, to entirely escape the system\nof relations, of conditionality. Emptiness is supposed to be strictly\n“inconceivable”. In Tiantai, this problem\ndisappears. Emptiness is still very important, but it is simply\na conditional assertion of unconditionality. We do not have\nall the conditionality (specifiability, particularity) on one side and\nall the unconditionality (transcendence, inconceivability) on the\nother. Everything, every experience, every identity, every action, is\nin the same boat: they are all both conditional and unconditional,\nboth conceivable and inconceivable. The thought, experience,\nconcept “Emptiness” is also both conditional and\nunconditional, both conceivable and inconceivable, like\n“water” and “fire” in our example\nabout. Emptiness is an especially efficient marker of self-exploded\nholism, the term that applies most easily everywhere and thus\nultimately nowhere, allowing all other terms to do the same.  It is\nProvisionally Posited, which means it is at least locally coherent\n(conditional, determinate, conceivable), but it itself is also Empty,\nwhich means it is globally incoherent (unconditional, indeterminate,\ninconceivable). It appears in experience as something in particular\n(locally coherent as precisely this word and this thought\n“Emptiness”), but this, like every other local coherence,\nis haunted by its own inseparable nimbus of infinite outsides,\ninfinite contexts, each of which differently contextualizes it and\nthus bestows on it alternate identities: there is more to it than any\nsingle concept, including the concept “Emptiness”, can\nhold.  Emptiness is, to use a word coined for just this Tiantai usage,\n“moretitivity”: and moretotivity is itself moretoitive. It\nappears not just as moretoitivity, but as specific identities,\nsomething more, above and beyond, simple moretoitivity as such.\nAmbiguity is itself ambiguous: fire is not just fire, it is ambiguous;\nbut the ambiguity is not just ambiguity, it is also fire. This applies\nto everything else as well. Local coherence and global coherence\n(Provisional Positing and Emptiness) are just two ways of saying the\nsame thing. In the Tiantai “Three Truths” theory, instead of\nconcluding that every particular view and thing is false, we conclude\nthat all is, ultimately, true. Every possible view is equally a truth.\nThere is no longer a hierarchy between the levels, and no category of\nplain falsehood. “Conventional Truth” in Tiantai is not\nsomething to be left behind when we reach enlightenment, but rather\nwhat is obtained and mastered and intensified there.  Moreover,\nnothing is left out of it—all possible statements, viewpoints,\nideas, concepts, positions are conventional truths. The criterion is\nstill the same: all things can be used as “skillful means”\nto lead to Buddhahood. So now we have Three Truths, which are not a\nraft-like instrument to get beyond all statements and concepts, and a\nfinal higher truth that allows us to have no biased and particular\nview of things, but rather as three true ways of viewing any\nparticular thing. It is not a raft to get beyond all rafts, but a raft\nthat leads to the raft factory that makes and houses all rafts, and\nallows one to move at will from any raft to any other raft, including\nthe initial one. However you may be viewing a particular part of the\nworld or the world as a whole, it is “conventionally”\ntrue. There are not just a few conventional truths, but an infinite\nnumber of them, even when they are directly opposed and\ncontradictory. So in Two Truths theory, we would say that “this\nis a cup” is conventionally true, and “this cup is\nempty” is a higher conventional truth, which finally leads us to\na direct inconceivable experience of the emptiness of this cup,\nfreedom from clinging to any view at all of this cup, which is the\nliberation from all suffering. If someone were to point to this\n“cup” and say, “This is an elephant”, however,\nthat would not even be a conventional truth, because that is not how\nmost people think of it, it is neither the ordinary speech of the\nlanguage community, nor a Buddhist term designed to lead beyond\nitself. That would be a plain error. And if someone said, “This\nis an expression of the will of God”, that would also be an\nerror, not even a conventional truth, since it tried to make a claim\nbeyond that of conventional usage to an ultimate, universally\napplicable, absolute truth. But in Tiantai Three Truths theory, it is\njust as true to say, “This is an elephant” or “This\nis the Will of Baal” as to say “This is a cup”. And\nneither of these is less true than saying, “This is\nempty”, or indeed any less true than “experiencing”\nthe emptiness of this cup/elephant. In both cases, what we have is\na locally coherent way of viewing this thing—it just\nmeans that it looks that way from some perspective, within\nsome set of parameters, for some length of time. It doesn’t matter\nanymore whether those parameters are shared by the common sense of a\nparticular community or speech group; all that matters is that it is\npossible to make it look that way, that it looks that way from\nanywhere, for even one moment. In Two Truths and\nEmptiness theory, nothing is really true. In Tiantai Three Truths\ntheory, everything is true. We don’t need an extra\n“Emptiness” outside of this locally coherent way of seeing\nthings; Emptiness just means that whatever is locally\ncoherent is also, ipso\nfacto, globally incoherent. That is, when all\nfactors are taken into consideration, the original way any thing\nappears is no longer unambiguously present, but it restored as a raft\nleading to all other rafts, including itself, as ineradicable aspects\nof all reality, of any reality. A simple thought experiment may draw out the implications of this\nidea.  Imagine that you come upon what looks like a white marble lying\non the ground. You experience it as round, as small, as white, and\nimmediately you construct a lived attitude toward it—something\nthat can be picked up, rolled, played with, pocketed. But then you go\nto pick it up, and find that it is stuck to the ground. You cannot\nlift it. You try to dig it out, and find that it extends downward,\nfurther than you can dig: it is the tip of a larger item. It appears\nto be a long rod or cylindrical pipe of some kind. But as you dig\nfurther, you find that after about five inches of narrow thinness it\nstarts to expand outward; it is a spire on top of a cone.  This cone\nexpands outward as you keep digging down. When you get about twenty\nfeet down, the cone ends, embedded in a soft, scaly material.  Then\nthe earth rumbles and an enormous two-horned monster emerges from\nunderground; it is 500 feet tall, and each of its horns is twenty feet\nhigh, with a long sharp tip. You had been digging out one of the\nhorns.  What you had seen as a marble on the ground was in fact the\nvery tip of one of the horns. Now look again at that tip. You had\nexperienced it as round. But it turns out it was not round at all: it\nis sharp. Yet it has not changed at all: you are still seeing what you\nsaw. It is not white either: the tip had looked white against the\nground, but now, looking at the monster’s horn as whole, you see it as\na pattern of mostly green spots interspersed here and there with\nwhite: looked at as a whole, the horn, including its tip, looks\ngreen. Nor is it movable, pocketable, playwithable—it is rather\ndangerous, razor sharp, to be avoided. And yet nothing of what you saw\nwas taken away: it was just supplemented with further information,\nwith its larger context.  Tiantai views all things this way. Normally you might make some\nqualifications in order to preserve your view that some facts are\nunambiguous (indeed, to some extent this process is precisely what\nphilosophy traditionally is); you might say “the\ntip, considered in isolation, is indeed round”. The\nusual procedure is to interpose the distinction between “how it\nappears” and “how it really is”, some form of\nreality-appearance distinction. But the most important consequence of\nthe transformation of the Two Truths into the Three Truths is the\nwholesale dismissal of the appearance-reality distinction. Tiantai\nwould reject the privileging of either considering in isolation or\nconsidering in any single particular connection; any of these would be\nlegitimate in some heuristic (upayic) contexts, but none\ncould be non-arbitrarily assigned the role of representing what is the\n“really the case”, simpliciter. To see something\nis to see “not-all” of it. We are always seeing a little\nfragment of the world, but every bit of the world is changed by the\nfact that it is a part of the world, is recontextualized by the rest\nof the world, by the rest of space and the rest of time. In fact, if\nwe ever saw all, we would see nothing. For to see, to take something\nas “there”, as “real”, is to place it within a\ncontext, to contrast it to something outside of itself, something\nwhich is not it. To see all is to see nothing. As in the case of\n“fire” and “water” above, if someone were to\nsay that the entire universe is “round”, this would\nrequire changing the meaning of “round”. This round would\nnot be round: for round requires a non-round outside it to be\nround.  It would have to be bordered by something to shape it into\nroundness, but the universe would also include that\noutside-the-roundness part. If someone were to say the entire universe\nwere sharp, this would also make no sense. This sharp would not be\nsharp; for sharp requires a non-sharp outside it to be\nsharp. To say the whole universe is sharp, then, means no more and no\nless than saying the whole universe is round. We can make no specific\ndeterminations about the whole, about the entire universe, for that\noutside of which nothing exists; for all particular specifications\nrequire a contrast to something outside of them. Everything we can say\nor think comes from the realm of the finite, and cannot be applied to\nthe infinite. But the Tiantai point is that we cannot speak of\nanything finite without also involving some determination of the\nWhole, of the infinite. If we were to say this thing is sharp, we\nwould have to be assuming that “the whole universe is such that\nthis thing is sharp”. We cannot say that: the whole universe\ncannot be “such that this marble is sharp” any more than\nthe whole universe can be “sharp”. But this also means we\ncannot say the whole universe is “such that this marble is\nnot-sharp”. Either is equally legitimate, either is equally\nillegitimate. What we can say, then, is that this marble appears to be\nround, but round is such that it is always turning out also to be more\nthan round, to be non-round, and vice versa. Roundness is\nmoretoitive. Round and non-round intersubsume each other. In short, roundness is present as every\nnon-roundness, and as moretoitivity; moretoitivity is present as\nroundness, and as every non-roundness. To clarify this, consider the following: What is the following figure? Ο  What is that “same” figure in the diagram below? −2 −1 Ο 1 2 What is it now? How about now: When we looked at that round figure in isolation, it may have\npresented itself immediately and unreflectively in accordance with our\nhabits or proximate mental acts; if we had been thinking about numbers\na moment ago, it might appear simply and unambiguously as\n“zero”, if about letters as the letter “o”, if\nabout shapes as a “circle”. When a single explicit context\nwas added in the second diagram, it had a clear and definite identity:\nit was the number zero. But when we added another context at the same\ntime, in the third diagram, the figure became ambiguous: it could now\nbe read as either a zero or the letter O. As we keep adding more\ncontexts, its identity becomes more and more ambiguous; in the final\ndiagram above, we can point to the initial circular figure and say,\nvalidly, “This is a triangle”—for it is the\nvertex of a triangle formed with the two other, non-contiguous and\nnon-proximate, circles. Who knows what other circles there are out in\nthe world, and what other figures this thing right here is\nactually forming? When we consider all things in the universe at the\nsame time, the initial identities we assigned to them are supplemented\nby more and more ambiguity. Looking at just the single series of\nletters, is was a zero: this is local coherence. When we see this cup\nsimply as a cup, we are doing the same thing: ignoring a lot of other\nfactors, contexts, points of view, ways of viewing, and narrowing down\nthe relevant factors to allow it to appear as a single unambiguous\nsomething: a cup. If we consider the molecules of which it is made, or\nthe energy it expresses, or the uses to which it might be put in the\ncontext of various narratives, or its deep past and deep future, its\n“cupness” becomes ambiguous: it is simultaneously lots of\nother things, part of many different stories. It is a blip on the\nscreen of energy transformations, or a murder weapon, or an art\nobject, or a doorstop.  The same is true of yourself, and your actions\nright now. They are unambiguous only to the extent that we narrow our\nvision around them (one way we can narrow our vision, of course, is to\ndo philosophy; one of the narratives in which we are contextualizing\nour experience might be a conceptual system presupposing the sorting\nout of essences, attributes, accidents, substantial forms or what have\nyou, and distinguishing appearances from reality accordingly, so that\nit appears to be “essentially” a cup and only\n“accidentally” a murder weapon and only “appearing\nto be” a revelation from Baal). This is the meaning of Emptiness\nin Tiantai: ontological ambiguity. The term “ambiguity”\nusually refers only to how we see things. We assume that, in\nthemselves, everything simply is what it is; but we may have an\nunclear view of it; we can’t yet tell if it’s this or\nthat. We assume that, at least in principle, it must be one or the\nother. The idea of Emptiness is the idea that this is true\n“ontologically”: that is, it pertains to the very being of\nthings. To say they are empty does not mean they are a blank—for\nthat would be a definite something, a specific exclusion of all\ndeterminate content, which is, ipso facto, itself a\ndeterminate content. Emptiness here means rather that they are, in\nthemselves, ambiguous. Again, this is also to say that\neverything is more than it seems to be, or rather\nconstitutively more than it can seem to be, no matter what\nangles it is seen from, no matter how thoroughly it is known, no\nmatter how comprehensive a sum of information is gathered about it. It\nhas the character of being a “something” (a cup, a chair,\nan elephant), with a number of specifiable characteristics, but every\n“something”, just to be there as something, has the\nadditional characteristic of “moretoitivity”—of\nalways overflowing whatever is determined about it, of\nbeing more than what can be seen from any angle. This “more” however, does not leave the original\n“known” part unchanged. Rather, it recontextualizes it. We\nare always seeing the tip of an iceberg. But even the\n“tip” is no longer what we thought it was before we knew\nit was a tip of something more. The key here is that there is\nno total decontextualization, that leaving one context is always\nsimply entering another context; contextual relations do not require\nphysical contiguity, and the empty space surrounding a given thing\ndoes not cut it off from further recontextualizations but rather is\nitself a context, and an illimitable one that opens into infinite\nalternate contexts.  This strange “neither-same-nor-different” structure of\nthe Three Truths is to be understood in accordance with another key\nTiantai concept, “opening the provisional to reveal the\nreal” (開權顯實 kaiquan\nxianshi). This is a way of further specifying the relation\nbetween local coherence and global incoherence, which are not only\nsynonymous, but also irrevocably opposed, and indeed identical only by\nmeans of their opposition and mutual exclusivity. Provisional truth is\nthe antecedent, the premise, and indeed in a distinctive sense\nthe cause of ultimate truth, but only because it is the\nstrict exclusion of ultimate truth. This can be compared to the structure of the relation between the\nset up and the punch line of a certain kind of joke. Consider the\nfollowing: Let’s talk about that structure. When we hear the question\n“How does he smell?” it seems as if it is a serious query,\nan expression of serious curiosity about canine anatomy and its\nmutations. It has the quality of seriousness, of factuality, of\nnon-ironic information. There is nothing funny about that statement.\nBut, when the punch line comes, retrospectively, that set up is funny.\nThat set up is funny because it has been recontextualized by the pun\non the word “smell”, which is made to have more than one\nidentity when put into a new context. The interesting thing to note here is that it is precisely\nby not being funny that the setup was funny. In other words,\nif it was already funny, if you didn’t take it seriously for a second,\nthe contrast between the two different meanings of this thing could\nnever have clashed in the way that is necessary to make the laughter,\nto make it actually funny. We have a setup which is serious and a\npunch line which is funny, but when you look back at the setup from\nthe vantage point of having heard the punchline, that setup is also\nfunny. After all, we don’t say that just the punch line is funny. We\nsay the whole joke is funny. The setup is funny in the mode of not\nbeing funny yet. It is only funny because it wasn’t funny.  It is the\nsame thing in the Lotus Sutra and it is the same thing in life\nreally. You’re Enlightened! That is what Mahāyāna Buddhism says,\neveryone is Enlightened! Everybody is a Buddha! But the way in which\nyou are a Buddha is the way in which the setup of a joke is funny,\ni.e., by not being a Buddha. By struggling toward buddhahood,\ntoward something else, but by revisualizing or recontextualizing or\nexpanding awareness, which has been the preferred technique in\nBuddhism all along, those very things which are the details of daily\nlife, of the struggles to interact, to deal with conditions and\nsuffering and lack of control are not just a means to buddhahood. They\nare themselves buddhahood as the life of a sentient being. The “provisional”, conventional truth, local coherence,\nis the set-up. The “ultimate truth”, Emptiness, global\nincoherence, ontological ambiguity, is the punch line. What is\nimportant here is to preserve both the contrast between the\ntwo and their ultimate identity in sharing the quality of\nhumorousness which belongs to every atom of the joke considered as a\nwhole, once the punch line has been revealed. The setup is serious,\nwhile the punchline is funny. The funniness of the punchline depends\non the seriousness of the setup, and on the contrast and difference\nbetween the two. However, once the punchline has occurred, it is also\nthe case that the setup is, retrospectively, funny. This also means\nthat the original contrast between the two is both preserved and\nannulled: neither funniness nor seriousness means the same thing after\nthe punchline dawns, for their original meanings depended on the\nmutually exclusive nature of their defining contrast. Is the setup\nserious or funny? It is both: it is funny as serious, and\nserious as funny. Is the punchline serious or funny? It is\nboth, but in an interestingly different way. It is obviously funny,\nbut is it also serious? Yes. Why? Because now that the setup has\noccurred, both “funny” and “serious” have a\ndifferent meaning. Originally, we thought that “funny”\nmeant “what I laugh at when I hear it” or something like\nthat, and “serious” meant “what gives me non-funny\ninformation” or something similar. But now we see that\n“funny” can also mean: What I take to be serious, what I am not\nlaughing about, what I am earnestly considering, or crying over, or\nbewailing even. But this means also that “serious”\nmeans “what can turn out to be either funny or\nserious”. So both “funny” and “serious”\nnow both mean “funny-and-serious, what can appear as both funny\nand serious”. Each is now a center that subsumes of the other;\nthey are intersubsumptive. As a consequence, the old pragmatic\nstandard of truth is applied more liberally here: all claims,\nstatements and positions are true in the sense that all can,\nif properly recontextualized, lead to liberation—which is to\nsay, to their own self-overcoming.  Conversely, none will lead to\nliberation if not properly contextualized. \n\nThis contextualism is applied intricately and thoroughgoingly to\nBuddhist teachings themselves, including especially its most\nfoundational teachings about the basic character of existence:\nimpermanence, suffering, and non-self--and also about the solutions to\nthose conditions: enlightenment and Buddhahood. Are all\nthings permament or impermanent? Are there selves or no\nselves? Can we end suffering or can’t we?  For\nTiantai the right question to be asked for understanding and applying\ndoctrine is not “is it true?”—since all doctrines are\n“true” in this sense of “liberating” in some\ncontexts, and not in others--but rather “in what sense, and in\nwhat context, is it true, i.e., liberating?” It is in\nthis connection that we must understand the Tiantai\n“classification of teachings.” Among the many\nrubrics used for this purpose in traditional Tiantai, the most\nphilosophically important is the classification of the four types of\ncontents of the Buddha’s teaching\n(化法四教), called the Four Teachings, namely,\nTripitaka, Shared, Separate, and Perfect\n藏，通，別，圓). \n\nThese four types of content are viewed by Tiantai thinkers not as\nfour different teachings, but as really increasingly subtle\nexplications of one and the same content, the basic Buddhist teaching,\nvia more and more expansive recontextualizations. Tiantai\nclassifies all the teachings found in the Mahāyāna Buddhist\nscriptures into these four general types, according to the degree to\nwhich they have developed the understanding of the basic Buddhist\nconcepts of universal conditionality, i.e., of Impermanence, Suffering,\nand Non-Self. It should be noted again that all four\nof these types are regarded as “true teachings” of the\nBuddha—true in the sense of validly propounded as a way of\nliberating sentient beings from suffering in some particular\ncontext—and that all are equally also not considered\nuniquely true descriptions of reality. Moreover,\nin keeping with the general Tiantai approach to interpretation, they\nare not really different teachings at all: they are viewed as\nalternate expositions of the same idea as it is recontextualized, to\nvarying degrees of thoroughness as appropriate, even though—as we\nshall see—they appear prima facie to be in direct\ncontradiction to one another. As such, this schema provides\nus with a strong general model of the Tiantai conception of the\nself-overcoming of suffering, impermanence and non-self, wherein they\nare overcome by remaining exactly as they were, indeed even more so,\nand thereby are revealed to also be their own opposites. \n\n Zhiyi takes an obscure passage from a Chinese translation of\nthe Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāna\nSūtra as one of his models for these four expositions. \nLiterally, the passage reads as follows: \nThe passage can be somewhat more venturesomely translated as\nfollows: \nFor Zhiyi this passage gives more than a standard Buddhist negation\nof the tetralemma followed by its provisional affirmation. \nInstead, he links these four positions to the following four general\ncategories, each with its own distinct way of understanding the Four\nNoble Truths, and therefore its own way of understanding the nature of\nall things, the nature of all conditional events, of both the arising\nand perishing of suffering (i.e., of all ordinary experience), of both\nsuffering and liberation from suffering, and of how they are\nrelated: \n\n1. Tripitaka Teaching 藏教: “The Generated\nGenerates” 生生, or literally, “The arising of\nwhat arises.” \nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths – i.e., all conditional\nexperience of suffering as well as the experience of the Unconditioned\nwhich is liberation from suffering--actually arise and perish.\n(shengmie sidi 生滅四諦) \nAll things are empty in that they are impermanent, and vanish\nwithout remainder when analyzed and dissolved into their parts\n(“analytic emptiness” xikong析空). \n2. Shared Teaching 通教：: The [Apparently]\nGenerated [Actually] is Ungenerated 生不生, or\nliterally, “the non-arising of what arises.” \nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths--i,e., all conditional\nexperiences of suffering as well as the experience of the\nUnconditioned which is liberation from suffering--do not arise [or\nperish]. (wusheng\nsidi 無生四諦) \nAll things are empty in their very nature from the beginning (whether\nliterally impermanent and dissolved into parts or not)\n(“emptiness embodied right in the thing,”\ntikong 體空). \n\n3. Separate Teaching 別教: The [Previously\nEstablished] Ungenerated Generates [Infinitely]\n不生生, or literally, “the arisings of what\ndoes not arise” \nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths – i.e., all\nconditional experiences of suffering as well as the experience of the\nUnconditioned which is liberation from suffering--can be validly\ndescribed not only as “really” empty of any determinations\nof their own and thus neither arising nor perishing, but also, because\nthey are also aspects of the compassionate liberative work of a\nbodhisattva, in an infinity of alternate ways. (wuliang\nsidi 無量四諦) \nThe previous characterizations of things as empty or as non-empty were\nboth one-sided, as things are in reality neither empty nor\nnon-empty. Rather, both Emptiness and all non-empty\nthings are manifestations “the Center,” a tertium\nquid which is beyond but also includes both the\nungenerated aspect and the generated aspect, at once both form and\nformless, the constant infinite productions of forms by the formless,\nformlessness present only as the infinity of forms. It is the\ncollapsing of emptiness and non-emptiness into something that is\nimmediately both: their unity, which is the real source of both: this\nis the Buddha-nature as “Exclusive Center”\ndanzhong foxing 但中佛性,\nhidden beneath the two extremes, the inner kernel of all phenomena, as\ntheir source and ultimate reality. \n4. Perfect Teaching 圓教: The (infinite things generated\nby the) Ungenerated (are also) Ungenerated\n不生不生, or literally, “the\nnon-arisings of the non-arising.” \nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths – i.e., all\nconditional experiences of suffering as well as the experience of\nliberation from suffering--in all those infinite alternate forms, are\n[actually, in their very infinite production,] unmade and unbegun (and\nunfinishable).  (wuzuo sidi\n無作四諦) \nEach thing is empty, non-empty, and the Center. Each thing is neither\nempty, non-empty, nor the Center. Each thing is entirely and only\nempty. Each thing is entirely and only non-empty. Each thing is\nentirely and only the Center.  Each thing subsumes all the\nothers. Each thing is subsumed by all the others. Each of the previous\nsentences in this paragraph are synonyms. Not only each thing: the\naspect of emptiness itself is empty, non-empty, and Center, and\nconsidered purely on its own terms is not only the negation of all\nthings but also, when fully thought through, the positing of all\nthings (non-empty) and the identity of positing and negation\n(Center). The same is true for the aspect of non-emptiness, and\nCenter: each one alone is all three. This is the “Non-Exclusive\nCenter.”\nbudanzhong 不但中佛性 Because\nit is what a Buddha lives and realizes, it is also called “the\nBuddha-nature”. Each thing is the center of the universe, the\nsubstance of which all other things are attributes. Each is the source\ngenerating all things, but also inherently contains all things within\nitself so that it generates nothing, and likewise being generated by,\nand contained by, any other thing. Each thing is readable equally as\nany other thing. Each thing is also the end toward which all other\nthings tend, the telos of all things. A more detailed\nexposition of these four positions, and their relation to each other,\nis given in the following supplementary document: The Three Truths, then, are actually three different but mutually\nimplicative ways of looking at any object or state. Each implies the\nother two, and each is one way to describe the whole of that\nobject, including its other two aspects. To be established is to be\nnegated. To be begun is to be constitutively incomplete; to be\ndeterminate is to be ambiguous, to be anything is to be more than that\nthing. If it were not more—other—than X, it would\nnot even be X. We may think about this in terms of the status\nof a “fact”. Emerson says in his essay,\n“History” (1841): Time dissipates to shining ether the solid\nangularity of facts. No anchor, no cable, no fences avail to keep a\nfact a fact. He meant that every historical fact registers\n“at a distance”, in other times and places, taking on the\nrole of an ever-ramifying metaphor that applies to more and more\nindividual cases, with more and more diverse and rich\nimplications. With a few small modifications, this brings us close to\nthe Tiantai view: all we need to do is specify that “time”\nand “fact” are not really two different things, with the\nformer acting to ambiguate the solidity of the latter, but are in\nreality two sides of the same thing, two aspects of a single process,\nin fact are ultimately synonyms. Time is just the addition of other\nfacts.  New facts are just the presence of additional time. In the\nTiantai view these new facts are not imposed on the initial fact from\nwithout, but are posited as the context which alone made it a fact in\nthe first place, made it determinate as just this fact.\n“Time” just means the self-positing of both itself and\nother facts by any fact. Time makes facts facts, and unmakes facts by\nmaking more facts, all of which are intrinsic to the first fact:\nhistory is the positing and transcending, the self-establishment and\nself-recontextualization of any given fact.  Put another way, let us stipulate that a fact—any\ndetermination about what is so—is something that is in principle\nknowable, and that knowability implies a subject-object relation, and\ntherefore a “distance” or separation, some space away from\nthe fact-to-be-known. That means that a fact is only a fact if there\nis something outside of it, another fact, another time, a place to\nview it from; it doesn’t count as a fact unless it can impact on some\nother site, unless it relates to some otherness. But that means that\nits journey out beyond itself to otherness is intrinsic to its very\nfacticity, and it is this journey out beyond itself that Emerson\ndenotes with the word “time”. To be thus and so, a fact\nmust be viewable from elsewhere, and elsewhere, whether in physical or\nin conceptual space, implies the illimitable positing of still other\nalternate perspectives from which to be seen, facts to impact,\nviewpoints to interpret and metaphorically internalize the initial\nfact. Determinacy implies limit, limit implies space, space implies\ninfinity of other spaces, of other perspectives, of other\ncontexts. For something to be a fact is for it to intrinsically posit\ndistances from itself, and thus to be viewable otherwise.  Most simply, we can say that for Tiantai time itself\nsimply is the continual “opening of the provisional to\nreveal the real”: an unceasing process of\nself-recontexualization where the past on the one hand remains\nunchangeable and on the other is constantly changing with each\nrecontextualization. A moment of time is a recontextualization of the\nall the past. This also implies that the Tiantai notion of\ninterpervasion of past, present and future, and of the “inherent\ninclusion” of all entities in each, is very far from resulting\nin a static picture of the universe devoid of any genuine\ncreativity. For in Tiantai, each moment of time brings with it not\nonly a new set of actual occasions, but a new set of “eternal\nprinciples”—categorical obligations, eternal objects,\nlaws, universals. Each moment is effectively the creation of a new God\nwho determines anew the character of the rest of the universe and of\nall the past and future. A moment, to be a moment, must be surrounded by other moments, from\nwhich it differs. “Now” must be different from\n“then”. But that means “now”\nmust relate to “then”. The “then” is\npart of the world of the “now”, against which it defines\nitself, to which it stands in necessary contrast. This contrast cannot\nbe either internal or external to the “now” and to the\n“then”. “Now” is really\n“now-then”, and “then” is really\n“then-now”. This is easy to understand if we consider the\nstate of the entire totality of being at moment M and at\nmoment M+1. The state of things at M is thought to have\nthe power to cause the arising of the state of things\nat M+1. But if M is gone when M+1 arrives, it\ncannot “reach” M+1 to do anything to it; it is\nalready gone, non-existent, and thus can do nothing. If the state of\nthings at M continues to exist when M+1 arrives,\nhowever, time has failed to move ahead, or we must admit the\ncoexistence of two alternate total states of being at the same\ntime. If the appearance of M+1 does not necessitate the\ndisappearance of M (which by our hypothesis possesses the power\nto bring about M+1), M would then continue to generate\nprecisely M+1 repeatedly forever. In either case, time would\nnot be possible, and no real entities could arise. Moments of time are\nneither same nor different; they are present as one another, the past\nas present as future, the future as past and present, the present as\npast and future. The past is not yet over—every moment of the\npresent and future reveals more about the past and its infinite\nchanges, for they are non-different from it, though allowing it to\nappear as these new moments.  The present never\nbegins—however far back you look, you will always be able to\nfind all the characteristics of the present there, unchanged though\nappearing as some former moment. The present never\nends—all future moments are further disclosures about this\npresent moment of experience happening right now. We can say all things are impermanent, as in early\nBuddhism—but now we know this is just a situationally\nattachment-undermining way of saying\n“impermanent-permanent”. We can say all things are\npermanent—meaning “permanent-impermanent”. We can\nsay some things are permanent and others are impermanent—meaning\n“some-all are permanent-impermanent” and “all-some\nare impermanent-permanent”. But note too that this does not mean\n“permanent-impermanent” is the real truth, while\n“permanent” and “impermanent” are both\none-sided distortions. That would be what Tiantai critiques as the\n“exclusive Center”. Rather, just as\n“permanent” really means\n“impermanent-permanent”,\n“impermanent-permanent” really means\n“permanent”, or really means\n“impermanent”. For impermanent-permanent\nappears as permanence and as impermanence, and each\nof these is the entirety, not a mere part, of the whole. To be\npermanent is already to also be impermanent—there is no other\npermanence. To be impermanent is already to also be\npermanent—there is no other impermanence. All is funny, all is\nserious, all is funny-serious. Each is a perfectly equal synonym for\nall three. Each is an equally adequate-inadequate description of the\ntruth. The same applies in all other cases. We can say all is\nsuffering—meaning “suffering-bliss”. We can say all\nis bliss—meaning “bliss-suffering”. We can say all\nis mind—meaning “mind-matter”. We can say all is\nmatter—meaning “matter-mind”. We can say there is a\nGod—meaning “God-Godless”. We can say there is no\nGod—meaning “Godless-God”. We can say all is\nillusion—meaning “illusion-reality”. We can say all\nis reality—meaning “reality-illusion”. We can say\nsome things are true and some things are false—meaning\n“some-all is true-false and all-some is false-true”. We\ncan say there is historical progress—meaning\n“progress-stagnation”. We can say there is historical\nstagnation—meaning “stagnation-progress”. We can say\nsociety is evil—meaning “evil-good”. We can say\nsociety is good—meaning “good-evil”. We can say we\nare sometimes happy and sometimes sad—meaning “we-everyone\nare sometimes-always happy-sad and sometimes-always\nsad-happy”. And so on. How should we choose which will we say at\nany time? If all things are sayable in some sense, what should we say\nright now? We should say whatever is most conducive to liberation from\nsuffering, from one-sided attachments, in this particular situation\nand context. The same method underlies all of Tiantai’s shocking slogans, such\nas the claim that “all moments are permanent”, as we have\nseen, or “all appearances are the ultimate reality”, or\n“evil is ineradicable from the highest good,\nBuddhahood”. They mean what they say, of course: no moment ever\nends, and however anything appears to anyone for however long is the\nultimate reality that all things emerge from, all things return to,\nthat explains and supports and sustains all things. True enough. The\nopposite would also be true. But these particular claims are\nemphasized in classical Tiantai writings to offset the more common\none-sided prejudices that tend the other way. Because the impermanence\nof things and the illusoriness of appearances is stressed in the rest\nof Buddhism, it is assumed that anyone getting to Tiantai will already\nbe aware of this side of reality, and indeed may be in danger of\nclinging to it. So Tiantai asserts the opposite, which is equally\ntrue. All appearances are the ultimate reality: how is that true?\nNormally, we believe that in some kind of appearance versus reality\ncontrast: “I thought that was a snake, but upon closer\ninspection it turned out to be a rope”. This is what most of\nBuddhism also says: “I thought there was a self, but it turned\nout to be a bunch of impermanent aggregates”. Or, “I\nthought there was a world, but it turned out to be all mind, or\nBuddha-nature, or illusion”. Common sense assumes this too: the\nrim of my glass looks oval, but in fact we know that,\n“really”, it is round—it’s just that we’re seeing it\nfrom an angle that foreshortens it. The rainbow is a mere\nappearance—when we go to touch it, we find nothing there. But\nthe clouds and sunlight are real, they are what it really is, what it\nturns out to really be. Tiantai, however, makes the preposterous claim\nthat the oval and the circle are both true—in fact, both are the\nultimate reality, are findable in all things and at all times and\nplaces, are the Absolute. The rainbow and the cloudy\nsunlight—both true, both absolutely true, both the Absolute. The\n“self” and the impermanent aggregates—both true,\nboth absolutely true, both the Absolute. The snake and the\nrope—both true, both absolutely true, both the Absolute. All is\nillusion. All is reality. Time is not an illusion. Time is the\nillusoriness of every possible thing. Time is a word that means\n“whatever you think is so is already not so”. What is\nreal? What you can go back to, look at again, check up on, verify,\nre-examine. But there is literally no experience that you can\ngo back to, so there is none that is real. What is illusion? Something\nthat turns out to be otherwise than it appears. There is no thing of\nwhich this is not the case. The horn “appeared” to be\nround, but “turned out” to be “sharp”. But\nboth roundness and sharpness are equally unreal, equally real. Each is\ndetermined by the context in which it is seen. Taking the unnameable\nwhole into account, they too are unnameable, neither sharp nor\nround. Roundness and sharpness are two names for the same thing, which\nis round, sharp, and neither round nor sharp, and both round and\nsharp. The same goes for the famous Tiantai claim that “evil is\ninherently included in Buddhahod”. Future Buddhahood lives in\npast delusion, so delusion is “Buddhahood-delusion”. Past\ndelusion lives in future Buddhahood, so Buddhahood is\n“delusion-Buddhahood”. The same goes also for the famous\nTiantai claim that “insentient beings have the\nBuddha-nature”—i.e., that rocks and stones and all other things\nwith no awareness have the all-pervasive unconditional nature of\nawareness: awareness is always nonawareness-awareness (all awareness\nexists-with nonawareness, e.g., the objects of awareness, which are\nnot themselves aware), nonawareness is always awareness-nonawareness\n(i.e., nonawareness is determinately nonawareness only as contrasted\nby awareness to awareness itself, and is intrinsically inseparable\nfrom whatever awareness might exist in the universe, simply by virtue\nof the inseparability of all existence).  The controversial idea of “the Buddha-nature of insentient\nbeings” is developed by Zhanran in his Jingangpi using\na slightly different approach to the Three Truths, focusing on the\ntrope of space as advanced as a metaphor for Buddha-nature in\nthe Mahāyāna Nirvana Sutra, in its character of\nall-pervasiveness, ineradicability, and indivisibility, and the\nnon-different/non-identical relation of all regions of space to each\nother and of each region of space to whatever possible object can\noccupy it. But here too the central argument is the inseparable\nintersubsumption of the two opposite terms: sentience is always\ninsentience-sentience, insentience is always\nsentience-insentience.  One way to think about this is to consider a magnet. It has a\nnorth and a south “pole” to it. If we wanted to separate\nthe north from the south pole, we might try cutting it in half. But\nwhen we do so, we find that each half still has both a north\nand a south pole. No matter how many times we slice it, the total set\nof different characteristics pertaining to the whole are also found in\nthat separate part: northness and southness are, in their entirety,\nfound in what was formerly, in the context of the whole magnet, purely\nthe north part, and also in the former south part. This is how it is\nin the Tiantai universe: the universe is one big magnet, but instead\nof just a north and a south, it has 3000 different characteristic\naspects: meness, youness, trains, oceans, dogs, soups, historical\nincidents, smiles, tears, delusion, enlightenment. If we try to\nisolate any of these, however, what we end up with is another entire\n“magnet”, which also has all 3000 aspects to it: this\nmeness, it turns out, also has its youness part, its train part, its\nocean part, its dog part, and so on. When I face you, it is you-and-me\nfacing you-and-me. It is me-and-all-worlds facing\nall-worlds-and-me. It is the entire universe facing the entire\nuniverse. We are always different, because wherever we go, there is a\nyou and a me, two different aspects, never merging into a blank\nindifferent mush of a single quality. But since me-and-you is\ncontrasted to me-and-you, there is really no contrast at all: the same\nthing is found on both sides of the contrast. We are neither the same\nnor different. We are divided from ourselves, impossible to unify into\na simple unity, but for that very reason we are impossible to\nseparate from one another. Each of us, at each moment, are, in a word,\nabsolute, the Center as which all appears, and which is appearing in\nand as all things. All things are our transformation bodies, we are\nthe transformation body of all things.   This also means that, the more fully one realizes that one is any\nparticular being, the more one realizes that he or she is also all\nother, contrasted, things as well. This is how traditional Buddhist\n“non-self” doctrine comes to play out in Tiantai. I think\nI am already this self, Brook, but in reality, Buddhism tells me, I am\nnot yet really any such self—for to be a self is to be\nunconditional, and that is impossible for “me”, a\nconditional determinate being. Also, I am not yet\nenlightened—for enlightenment is unconditionality, the only\nfreedom from suffering. To become unconditioned, as I’d thought I was\nwhen I thought I was a self, is to become enlightened. This non-self\nis the only thing that really fulfills my previous lust to be a self,\nto actually be me. I cannot become this by being me as a\ndeterminate being to the exclusion of all other beings, nor other\nbeings to the exclusion of me. Rather, by the Three Truths, I can only\nbecome more and more me by becoming more and more everything else, and\nthat is what it means to become more and more enlightened, and to\nbecome more me, more unconditionally this specific me. To\n“become what I am”, to be a more fully realized version of\nmyself, is to see myself, Brook specifically, as unconditional, which\nmeans as omnipresent and eternal, which means as expressing itself in\nand as all things, which also means, conversely, intersubsumed, i.e.,\nas an expression of all other things, as something as which\nall other things are appearing. I cannot be myself until I am a\nBuddha, but I cannot be a Buddha until I can be more fully (i.e., more\nunconditionally, more all-pervasively) myself, and that means being\nmore fully a devil, a fool, a table, a spaceship, or, in Siming\nZhili’s example, a dung beetle. Buddhist practice is the progressively\nfuller manifestation of my latent Buddhahood—which means also\nthe progressively fuller manifestation of my latent Dung-Beetlehood,\nand indeed, my allegedly long ago already actual but really hitherto\nmerely latent Brookhood.  Tiantai is encyclopedic in its approach to Buddhist practice; as\none might expect in light of its view of “exclusion” in\ngeneral, it excludes nothing. Hence in Tiantai works we find\nextensive, detailed cataloging of a huge diversity of traditional\nBuddhist practices, from rituals and devotions to meditations and\ncontemplations of all kinds, derived from all strata of previous\nBuddhist culture. This accords not only with the philosophical\nobjection to the possibility of any final mutual exclusion of entities\nrehearsed above, but also to the Lotus Sutra notion\nof upāya, and the expansion of the range of Conventional\nTruth in the Three Truths: the diversity of sentient beings is\nlimitless, their specific delusions and attachments and sufferings are\nof limitless specific types, and thus the appropriate remedial\npractices and doctrines for them are limitless. This is also the\njustification for the “trivialist” position that all\npossible claims are true, for “true” in the Tiantai\ncontext meansonly a remedial upāya serving as a raft to\novercome itself, but doing so by totalization of itself, thereby\nundermining itself, expressing itself in and as all other things,\nintersubsuming all other truth-claims, thereby become all the more\npresent as all the more absent. Tiantai takes the non-dualistic ideas suggested by the Lotus\nSutra in fables and unexplained narrative hints, and adapts the\nresources of Emptiness and the Two Truths to give them a full\nphilosophical explanation and practical application for Buddhist\npractice. The Lotus Sutra had made upāya the\ncenterpiece of Buddhism, and asserted a unity of all practices in the\nOne Vehicle, all leading toward Buddhahood. Tiantai follows this lead\nand constructs a vast and complex system for accounting for and\nintegrating all known forms of Buddhist and even non-Buddhist\npractice, all of which are acceptable skillful means appropriate and\nwholesome for different persons and times. It rejects nothing, but it\norganizes all known teachings and practices into an interconnected\nsystem. The system has an interesting double structure: the first time\nthrough, it appears to be hierarchical, putting the Mahāyāna above the\nHinayana and the Lotus above the rest of the Mahāyāna. But\nthe idea of redefinition of identity through recontextualization is\napplied here, and when the hierarchical crown of the Lotus\nhas done its work, it has the retroactive effect of making all the\nother parts equal as aspects of the One Vehicle. That is, no teaching,\npractice or behavior has only a single meaning: its meaning is\ndetermined by the context in which it is viewed. So any given doctrine\nor practice can be seen as both the ultimate truth and as a more\npartial and only locally relevant, or lesser, truth. The Tiantai\nsystem of integrating all the various teachings and ideas and\nperspectives in the world provides a system for seeing everything\ntwice, three times, infinite times, reassessing and developing the\nmeanings of each item as it comes into broader and broader relations.\nThe Hinayana teaching is, in the narrower context, a\n“lesser” truth. But in the context of the One Vehicle, it\nis itself an instantiation of the One Vehicle, and even gives unique\nexpression to it: hence the claim (based on a clever strong misreading\nof a line from Kumārajīva’s translation of the Lotus:\n決了聲聞法\n為諸經之王) that the Hinayana doctrine\n(rather than the Lotus itself) is itself the Highest of All\nTeachings. The same goes for all other particular ideas, beliefs,\npractices. Since nothing has only one meaning, everything can\nmean anything. The interesting question about any proposition is\nnot whether it is true (it always is), but how. The\nTiantai “classification of teachings” is an intricate and\ncomplex way of spelling out in what context and in what way each\ndoctrine means each of the many things it means. The way in which each and any of these alternate methods or\ndoctrines is recontextualized to promote the desired Tiantai\nimplication is through the supplementation of the Three Truths view of\nany and every possible content. Tiantai meditation most centrally\napplies a method called “the contemplation of mind”,\n(觀心 guanxin) given its most famous formulation\nin Zhiyi’s unfolding of\n一念三千 yiniansanqian (Japanese:\nichinensanzen), which means something like: “One Moment of\nExperience as Three Thousand Worlds”. The “three\nthousand” is of course a way of saying “everything”,\nbut it is really something a bit more than that. For of course, as\nZhiyi himself points out, any number would be an equally accurate\npossible way to talk about the totality of all things, from none to\ninfinity. This number, “three thousand”, is concocted\nspecifically with meditational practice in mind. Here’s how it’s\nderived: Please note a few peculiarities of this way of listing “what\nexists”. First, special care is taken here to include both\n“purgatories” （i.e., the demonic thoughts,\npractices and consequences of extreme subjective delusion and\nsuffering) on the one hand, and “Buddhas”, (the\nenlightened thoughts, practices and consequences of the greatest\nwisdom and liberation) on the other hand. This is important, because\nit cautions us against viewing these subjective states, good or evil,\nas mere epiphenenomena that are somehow outside the ultimate\nreality. They are themselves included in the ultimate reality. By\nincluding these terms, Tiantai guards against a vague notion of\n“everything” which might lend itself to thinking that only\na pure or neutral substance—mind, matter, energy—is what\nis real, or that the values and perspectives, good and bad, painful\nand pleasant, that living beings experience are not part of the\n“everything”. The “everything” that is\nincluded in each moment of experience, and which is eternally\nineradicable, includes all those good and bad subjective states as\nwell. Second, we have two important reduplications. The ten realms are\nall the states in which a sentient being might find him or herself in\nthe Buddhist universe, from the lowest ignorance and suffering to the\nhighest bliss and enlightenment. They are often interpreted\nsymbolically: Buddhahood representing a moment of enlightened\nexperience, Bodhisattvahood a moment of compassion, Sravakahood a\nmoment of quiescence or renunciation of the worldly, Godhood a moment\nof great worldly bliss and power, Asurahood a moment of egoistic rage\nand combativeness, animals ignorance, purgatories suffering. One\nreason to read these as states that any being might undergo is that\neach of the ten realms is listed twice. This is because each realm\n“includes” or “instantiates” all the other ten\nrealms. That is, each can appear “as” any of the others,\nand in fact nothing appears which is not always “as”\nsomething else. A human-bodhisattva, an animal-god, a Buddha-demon, an\nAsura-Sravaka, etc. A bodhisattva appears as a human, or an animal, or\na Buddha, or an Asura. But as we’ve seen, this also means a human\nappears as a bodhisattva, or a demon as an animal, or a Sravaka as a\nhungry ghost, etc. Of course this goes on ad infinitum: each\nof these included realms further includes all ten realms, and so\non. The 10 times 10 is just to point to this factor of mutual\ninclusion, and make sure it is accounted for in our meditative\ncontemplation of “what exists”. The other duplication comes in the “Three Worlds”. We\nhave “the five aggregates” but also “sentient\nbeings”. Actually, these are two ways of looking at the same\nthing. Early Buddhism taught that what we call a sentient\nbeing—you, me, Bill, Dave—is actually a set of five\naggregates, momentarily arising and perishing impersonal processes of\nform, sensation, perception, volition and consciousness. One (the\naggregates) was real, the other (the alleged “self”) was a\npernicious illusion. The Three Thousand includes both. In other words,\nit does not exclude the illusions about things among the totality of\n“what exists”—as we’ve seen, all things are equally\nillusions and equally true. The view of you as Bill is one item in the\nlist; the view of you as five impersonal aggregate processes is\nanother item on the list. Here too we have a shorthand way of pointing\nto a larger principle, and a goad to keep it in mind in our\ncontemplation of “all that exists”. We are not to think of\na set of real entities lined up side by side, mutually exclusive, of\nwhich there may be some additional erroneous views. Rather, the\nerroneous view are part of all that exists, indeed all that exists is\nsome erroneous (i.e., one-sided, locally coherent) view. There is no\n“thing” as such: a thing is just a way of appearing, and\ncomes with a viewpoint upon it. Tiantai insists further that to have a\nsingle viewpoint requires at least one additional viewpoint, and\nso ad infinitum. Normally we drain off the ambiguity and call\nit “subjectivity” or “free will” or “the\nunknown future” to one side and leave the “reality”\non the other side, calling it “objectivity” or\n“determinate fact” or “the settled past”. In\nTiantai, these are inseparable, merely aspects artificially separated\noff from the whole, which is always both fixed and open, locally\ncoherent and globally incoherent. Now once we have gone through thinking about all possible objects\nof experience this way, one by one, almost in the manner of a list out\nof Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, we apply the Three Truths,\nthe neither-same-nor-different relation, to this thought\nitself. First temporally: this whole line of thinking required\nsome time to go through. Are the previous moments of thinking same as\nor different from the present one now considering this question?\nNeither.  All other moments are present here as this\nmoment—neither same nor different, the Three Truths. Next we consider\nthe external world, including my sense organs and brain, that served\nas the efficient causes for the arising of this moment of thought\nabout the Three Thousand realms of possible experience: is the actual\nworld and my body different from or same as this moment of\nthought about them all? Neither.  The external world is\npresent here as this consciousness of it, neither same nor\ndifferent. Next we consider all other possible thoughts or\nexperiences, the contrast with which is what makes this moment\ndeterminate as itself: are they the same or different from it?\nNeither. All other experiences are present here as this\nmoment of experience. I experience one moment of experience as a\ntotality, including my illusory presence as the experiencer. The next\nmoment, when new contents appear, will be experienced as more\nof or other expressions of the same moment. I experience\nthe eternity-temporality of this moment continuing to show itself in\nand as the neither-same-nor-different array of all other possible\nexperiences, beings, ideas, moments. This is the experience of\nBuddhahood-as-all-sentient-beings.","contact.mail":"ziporyn@uchicago.edu","contact.domain":"uchicago.edu"}]
