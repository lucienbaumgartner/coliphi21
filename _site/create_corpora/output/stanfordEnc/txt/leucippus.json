Little is known about him, and his views are\nhard to distinguish from those of his associate Democritus. He is\nsometimes said to have been a student of Zeno of Elea, and to have\ndevised the atomist philosophy in order to escape from the problems\nraised by Parmenides and his followers.\n\nLeucippus is variously said to have been born in Elea, Abdera or\nMiletus (DK 67A1). His dates are unknown, other than that he lived\nduring the fifth century BCE. Diogenes Laertius reports that he was a\nstudent of Parmenides' follower Zeno (DK 67A1). Zeno is best known for\nparadoxes suggesting that motion is impossible because a magnitude can\nbe divided into an infinite number of parts, each of which must be\ntraversed; the fact that atomism is thought to have been formulated in\nresponse to these arguments may account for the story that Leucippus\nwas a student of Zeno.  \nThe extent of Leucippus' contribution to the developed atomist theory\nis unknown. His relationship to Democritus, and even his very\nexistence, was a subject of considerable controversy in nineteenth\ncentury scholarship (Graham 2008). Most reports on early Greek atomism\nrefer to the views of Democritus alone, or to both atomists together;\nEpicurus seems even to have denied that there was a philosopher\nLeucippus (DK 67A2). Aristotle certainly ascribes the foundation of\nthe atomist system to Leucippus. Leucippus is sometimes said to have\nbeen the author of a work called the Great World-System; one\nsurviving quotation is said to have come from a work On Mind.\n \nLeucippus is named by most sources as the originator of the theory\nthat the universe consists of two different elements, which he called\n‘the full’ or ‘solid,’ and ‘the\nempty’ or ‘void’. Both the void and the solid atoms\nwithin it are thought to be infinite, and between them to constitute\nthe elements of everything. Because little is known of Leucippus'\nviews and his specific contributions to atomist theory, a fuller\ndiscussion of the developed atomist doctrine is found in the entry for\nDemocritus. \nEarly Greek atomism is generally taken to have been formulated in\nresponse to the Eleatic claim that ‘what is’ must be one\nand unchanging, because any assertion of differentiation or change\nwithin ‘what is’ involves the assertion of ‘what is\nnot,’ an unintelligible concept. While Parmenides' argument is\ndifficult to interpret, he was understood in antiquity to have forced\nphilosophers after him to explain how change is possible without\nsupposing that something comes from ‘what is not,’ i.e.\nnothing. Aristotle tells us that Leucippus tried to formulate a theory\nthat is consistent with the evidence of the senses that change and\nmotion and a multiplicity of things exists in the world (DK 67A7). In\nthe atomist system, change only occurs at the level of appearances:\nthe real constituents of being persist unchanged, merely rearranging\nthemselves into new combinations that form the world of appearance.\nLike Parmenidean Being, the atoms cannot change or disintegrate into\n‘what is not’ and each is a solid unit; nonetheless, the\ncombinations of atoms that form the world of appearance continually\nalter. Aristotle cites an analogy to the letters of the alphabet,\nwhich can produce a multitude of different words from a few elements\nin combinations; the differences all stem from the shape\n(schêma) of the letters, as A differs from N; by their\narrangement (taxis), as AN differs from NA; and by their\npositional orientation (thesis), as N differs from Z (DK\n67A6). \nLeucippus also reportedly accepted the Eleatic Melissus' argument that\nvoid is necessary for motion, but took this to be evidence that, since\nwe experience motion, there must be void (DK 67A7). The reason for\npositing smallest indivisible magnitudes is also reported to be a\nresponse to Zeno's argument that, if every magnitude could be divided\nto infinity, motion would be impossible (DK 29A22). Leucippus is\nreported to hold that the atoms are always in motion (DK 67A18).\nAristotle criticizes him for not offering an account that says not\nonly why a particular atom is moving (because it collided with\nanother) but why there is motion at all. Because the atoms are\nindestructible and unchangeable, their properties presumably stay the\nsame through all time. \nAs Diogenes Laertius reports Leucippus' cosmology, worlds or\nkosmoi are formed when groups of atoms combine to form a cosmic\nwhirl, which causes the atoms to separate out and sort by like kind. A\nsort of membrane of atoms forms out of the circling atoms, enclosing\nothers within it, and creating pressure by whirling. The outer\nmembrane continually acquires other atoms from outside when it\ncontacts them, which take fire as they revolve and form the stars,\nwith the sun in the outermost circle. Worlds are formed, grow and\nperish, according to a kind of necessity (DK 67A1). \nOne direct quotation preserved from Leucippus says that nothing\nhappens in vain (matên) but everything from logos\nand by necessity (DK 67B2). This has been found puzzling, since the\nreference to logos might seem to suggest that things are ruled\nby reason, an idea that Democritus' system excludes. Either Leucippus'\nsystem is different in this respect from that of Democritus, or the\nreference to logos here cannot be to a controlling mind. Barnes\ntakes there to be no grounds for preferring either interpretation\n(Barnes 1984), but Taylor argues that Leucippus' position is that an\naccount (or logos) can be given of the causes of all\noccurrences (Taylor 1999, p. 189). There is nothing in other reports\nto suggest that Leucippus endorsed the idea of a universal\nintelligence governing events. \nAristotle frequently pairs Leucippus and Democritus in his reports,\nincluding his account of the motivation for positing atoms and void.\nIn particular, Aristotle associates Leucippus as well as Democritus\nwith the deliberately paradoxical assertion that ‘being is no\nmore than not-being,’ i.e., that void exists as much as the full\nor solid (DK 67A6). Schofield (2002) has argued that the more careful\naccount in Simplicius shows that the ou mallon or ‘no\nmore’ doctrine is due to Democritus. Following this lead, Graham\n(2008) suggests a new reading of Leucippus, wherein the distinction\nbetween atom and void is actually based on a reading of Parmenides'\nDoxa, his cosmological account. Rather than logical abstractions,\nBeing and Not-being, Leucippus' atoms would in essence be based on\nParmenides' cosomological contraries, night and light. If this line of\ninterpretation is followed, Leucippus' notion of atom and void might\nhave been rather different from Democritus', and Aristotle's tendency\nto refer to the two in conjunction somewhat misleading.","contact.mail":"sberrym@interchange.ubc.ca","contact.domain":"interchange.ubc.ca"}]
