Consider, for instance, Aristotle on the human function,\nAquinas on the beatific vision, and Kant on the highest good.\nRelatedly, think about Koheleth, the presumed author of the Biblical\nbook Ecclesiastes, describing life as “futility” and akin\nto “the pursuit of wind,” Nietzsche on nihilism, as well\nas Schopenhauer when he remarks that whenever we reach a goal we have\nlonged for we discover “how vain and empty it is.” While\nthese concepts have some bearing on happiness and virtue (and their\nopposites), they are straightforwardly construed (roughly) as accounts\nof which higher-order final ends, if any, a person ought to realize\nthat would make her life significant.\n\n\nDespite the venerable pedigree, it is only since the 1980s or so that\na distinct field of the meaning of life has been established in\nAnglo-American-Australasian philosophy, on which this survey focuses,\nand it is only in the past 20 years that debate with real depth and\nintricacy has appeared. Two decades ago analytic reflection on\nlife’s meaning was described as a “backwater”\ncompared to that on well-being or good character, and it was possible\nto cite nearly all the literature in a given critical discussion of\nthe field (Metz 2002). Neither is true any longer.\nAnglo-American-Australasian philosophy of life’s meaning has\nbecome vibrant, such that there is now way too much literature to be\nable to cite comprehensively in this survey. To obtain focus, it tends\nto discuss books, influential essays, and more recent works, and it\nleaves aside contributions from other philosophical traditions (such\nas the Continental or African) and from non-philosophical fields\n(e.g., psychology or literature). This survey’s central aim is\nto acquaint the reader with current analytic approaches to\nlife’s meaning, sketching major debates and pointing out\nneglected topics that merit further consideration.\n\n\nWhen the topic of the meaning of life comes up, people tend to pose\none of three questions: “What are you talking about?”,\n“What is the meaning of life?”, and “Is life in fact\nmeaningful?”. The analytic literature can be usefully organized\naccording to which question it seeks to answer. This survey starts off\nwith recent work that addresses the first, abstract (or\n“meta”) question regarding the sense of talk of\n“life’s meaning,” i.e., that aims to clarify what we\nhave in mind when inquiring into the meaning of life (section 1).\nAfterward, it considers texts that provide answers to the more\nsubstantive question about the nature of meaningfulness (sections\n2–3). There is in the making a sub-field of applied meaning that\nparallels applied ethics, in which meaningfulness is considered in the\ncontext of particular cases or specific themes. Examples include\ndownshifting (Levy 2005), implementing genetic enhancements (Agar\n2013), making achievements (Bradford 2015), getting an education\n(Schinkel et al. 2015), interacting with research participants (Olson\n2016), automating labor (Danaher 2017), and creating children\n(Ferracioli 2018). In contrast, this survey focuses nearly exclusively\non contemporary normative-theoretical approaches to life’s\nmeanining, that is, attempts to capture in a single, general principle\nall the variegated conditions that could confer meaning on life.\nFinally, this survey examines fresh arguments for the nihilist view\nthat the conditions necessary for a meaningful life do not obtain for\nany of us, i.e., that all our lives are meaningless (section 4).\n\nOne part of philosophy of life’s meaning consists of the\nsystematic attempt to identify what people have in mind when they\nthink about the topic or what they mean by talk of “life’s\nmeaning.” For many in the field, terms such as\n“importance” and “significance” are synonyms\nof “meaningfulness” and so are insufficiently revealing,\nbut there are those who draw a distinction between meaningfulness and\nsignificance (Singer 1996, 112–18; Belliotti 2019, 145–50,\n186). There is also debate about how the concept of a meaningless life\nrelates to the ideas of a life that is absurd (Nagel 1970, 1986,\n214–23; Feinberg 1980; Belliotti 2019), futile (Trisel 2002),\nand not worth living (Landau 2017, 12–15; Matheson 2017). \nA useful way to begin to get clear about what thinking about\nlife’s meaning involves is to specify the bearer. Which life\ndoes the inquirer have in mind? A standard distinction to draw is\nbetween the meaning “in” life, where a human person is\nwhat can exhibit meaning, and the meaning “of” life in a\nnarrow sense, where the human species as a whole is what can be\nmeaningful or not. There has also been a bit of recent consideration\nof whether animals or human infants can have meaning in their lives,\nwith most rejecting that possibility (e.g., Wong 2008, 131, 147;\nFischer 2019, 1–24), but a handful of others beginning to make a\ncase for it (Purves and Delon 2018; Thomas 2018). Also under-explored\nis the issue of whether groups, such as a people or an organization,\ncan be bearers of meaning, and, if so, under what conditions.  \nMost analytic philosophers have been interested in meaning in life,\nthat is, in the meaningfulness that a person’s life could\nexhibit, with comparatively few these days addressing the meaning of\nlife in the narrow sense. Even those who believe that God is or would\nbe central to life’s meaning have lately addressed how an\nindividual’s life might be meaningful in virtue of God more\noften than how the human race might be. Although some have argued that\nthe meaningfulness of human life as such merits inquiry to no less a\ndegree (if not more) than the meaning in a life (Seachris 2013;\nTartaglia 2015; cf. Trisel 2016), a large majority of the field has\ninstead been interested in whether their lives as individual persons\n(and the lives of those they care about) are meaningful and how they\ncould become more so.  \nFocusing on meaning in life, it is quite common to maintain that it is\nconceptually something good for its own sake or, relatedly, something\nthat provides a basic reason for action (on which see Visak 2017).\nThere are a few who have recently suggested otherwise, maintaining\nthat there can be neutral or even undesirable kinds of meaning in a\nperson’s life (e.g., Mawson 2016, 90, 193; Thomas 2018, 291,\n294). However, these are outliers, with most analytic philosophers,\nand presumably laypeople, instead wanting to know when an\nindividual’s life exhibits a certain kind of final value (or\nnon-instrumental reason for action). \nAnother claim about which there is substantial consensus is that\nmeaningfulness is not all or nothing and instead comes in degrees,\nsuch that some periods of life are more meaningful than others and\nthat some lives as a whole are more meaningful than others. Note that\none can coherently hold the view that some people’s lives are\nless meaningful (or even in a certain sense less\n“important”) than others, or are even meaningless\n(unimportant), and still maintain that people have an equal standing\nfrom a moral point of view. Consider a consequentialist moral\nprinciple according to which each individual counts for one in virtue\nof having a capacity for a meaningful life, or a Kantian approach\naccording to which all people have a dignity in virtue of their\ncapacity for autonomous decision-making, where meaning is a function\nof the exercise of this capacity. For both moral outlooks, we could be\nrequired to help people with relatively meaningless lives. \nYet another relatively uncontroversial element of the concept of\nmeaningfulness in respect of individual persons is that it is\nconceptually distinct from happiness or rightness (emphasized in Wolf\n2010, 2016). First, to ask whether someone’s life is meaningful\nis not one and the same as asking whether her life is pleasant or she\nis subjectively well off. A life in an experience machine or virtual\nreality device would surely be a happy one, but very few take it to be\na prima facie candidate for meaningfulness (Nozick 1974: 42–45).\nIndeed, a number would say that one’s life logically could\nbecome meaningful precisely by sacrificing one’s well-being,\ne.g., by helping others at the expense of one’s self-interest.\nSecond, asking whether a person’s existence over time is\nmeaningful is not identical to considering whether she has been\nmorally upright; there are intuitively ways to enhance meaning that\nhave nothing to do with right action or moral virtue, such as making a\nscientific discovery or becoming an excellent dancer. Now, one might\nargue that a life would be meaningless if, or even because, it were\nunhappy or immoral, but that would be to posit a synthetic,\nsubstantive relationship between the concepts, far from indicating\nthat speaking of “meaningfulness” is analytically a matter\nof connoting ideas regarding happiness or rightness. The question of\nwhat (if anything) makes a person’s life meaningful is\nconceptually distinct from the questions of what makes a life happy or\nmoral, although it could turn out that the best answer to the former\nquestion appeals to an answer to one of the latter questions. \nSupposing, then, that talk of “meaning in life” connotes\nsomething good for its own sake that can come in degrees and that is\nnot analytically equivalent to happiness or rightness, what else does\nit involve? What more can we say about this final value, by\ndefinition? Most contemporary analytic philosophers would say that the\nrelevant value is absent from spending time in an experience machine\n(but see Goetz 2012 for a different view) or living akin to Sisyphus,\nthe mythic figure doomed by the Greek gods to roll a stone up a hill\nfor eternity (famously discussed by Albert Camus and Taylor 1970). In\naddition, many would say that the relevant value is typified by the\nclassic triad of “the good, the true, and the beautiful”\n(or would be under certain conditions). These terms are not to be\ntaken literally, but instead are rough catchwords for beneficent\nrelationships (love, collegiality, morality), intellectual reflection\n(wisdom, education, discoveries), and creativity (particularly the\narts, but also potentially things like humor or gardening).  \nPressing further, is there something that the values of the good, the\ntrue, the beautiful, and any other logically possible sources of\nmeaning involve? There is as yet no consensus in the field. One\nsalient view is that the concept of meaning in life is a cluster or\namalgam of overlapping ideas, such as fulfilling higher-order\npurposes, meriting substantial esteem or admiration, having a\nnoteworthy impact, transcending one’s animal nature, making\nsense, or exhibiting a compelling life-story (Markus 2003; Thomson\n2003; Metz 2013, 24–35; Seachris 2013, 3–4; Mawson 2016).\nHowever, there are philosophers who maintain that something much more\nmonistic is true of the concept, so that (nearly) all thought about\nmeaningfulness in a person’s life is essentially about a single\nproperty. Suggestions include being devoted to or in awe of\nqualitatively superior goods (Taylor 1989, 3–24), transcending\none’s limits (Levy 2005), or making a contribution (Martela\n2016).  \nRecently there has been something of an “interpretive\nturn” in the field, one instance of which is the strong view\nthat meaning-talk is logically about whether and how a life is\nintelligible within a wider frame of reference (Goldman 2018,\n116–29; Seachris 2019; Thomas 2019; cf. Repp 2018). According to\nthis approach, inquiring into life’s meaning is nothing other\nthan seeking out sense-making information, perhaps a narrative about\nlife or an explanation of its source and destiny. This analysis has\nthe advantage of promising to unify a wide array of uses of the term\n“meaning.” However, it has the disadvantages of being\nunable to capture the intuitions that meaning in life is essentially\ngood for its own sake (Landau 2017, 12–15), that it is not\nlogically contradictory to maintain that an ineffable condition is\nwhat confers meaning on life (as per Cooper 2003, 126–42;\nBennett-Hunter 2014; Waghorn 2014), and that often human actions\nthemselves (as distinct from an interpretation of them), such as\nrescuing a child from a burning building, are what bear meaning. \nSome thinkers have suggested that a complete analysis of the concept\nof life’s meaning should include what has been called\n“anti-matter” (Metz 2002, 805–07, 2013, 63–65,\n71–73) or “anti-meaning” (Campbell and Nyholm 2015;\nEgerstrom 2015), conditions that reduce the meaningfulness of a life.\nThe thought is that meaning is well represented by a bipolar scale,\nwhere there is a dimension of not merely positive conditions, but also\nnegative ones. Gratuitous cruelty or destructiveness are prima facie\ncandidates for actions that not merely fail to add meaning, but also\nsubtract from any meaning one’s life might have had.  \nDespite the ongoing debates about how to analyze the concept of\nlife’s meaning (or articulate the definition of the phrase\n“meaning in life”), the field remains in a good position\nto make progress on the other key questions posed above, viz., of what\nwould make a life meaningful and whether any lives are in fact\nmeaningful. A certain amount of common ground is provided by the point\nthat meaningfulness at least involves a gradient final value in a\nperson’s life that is conceptually distinct from happiness and\nrightness, with exemplars of it potentially being the good, the true,\nand the beautiful. The rest of this discussion addresses philosophical\nattempts to capture the nature of this value theoretically and to\nascertain whether it exists in at least some of our lives.  \nMost analytic philosophers writing on meaning in life have been trying\nto develop and evaluate theories, i.e., fundamental and general\nprinciples, that are meant to capture all the particular ways that a\nlife could obtain meaning. As in moral philosophy, there are\nrecognizable “anti-theorists,” i.e., those who maintain\nthat there is too much pluralism among meaning conditions to be able\nto unify them in the form of a principle (e.g., Kekes 2000; Hosseini\n2015). Arguably, though, the systematic search for unity is too\nnascent to be able to draw a firm conclusion about whether it is\navailable.  \nThe theories are standardly divided on a metaphysical basis, that is,\nin terms of which kinds of properties are held to constitute the\nmeaning. Supernaturalist theories are views according to which a\nspiritual realm is central to meaning in life. Most Western\nphilosophers have conceived of the spiritual in terms of God or a soul\nas commonly understood in the Abrahamic faiths (but see Mulgan 2015\nfor discussion of meaning in the context of a God uninterested in us).\nIn contrast, naturalist theories are views that the physical world as\nknown particularly well by the scientific method is central to\nlife’s meaning. \nThere is logical space for a non-naturalist theory, according to which\ncentral to meaning is an abstract property that is neither spiritual\nnor physical. However, only scant attention has been paid to this\npossibility in the recent Anglo-American-Australasian literature (Audi\n2005). \nIt is important to note that supernaturalism, a claim that God (or a\nsoul) would confer meaning on a life, is logically distinct from\ntheism, the claim that God (or a soul) exists. Although most who hold\nsupernaturalism also hold theism, one could accept the former without\nthe latter (as Camus more or less did), committing one to the view\nthat life is meaningless or at least lacks substantial meaning.\nSimilarly, while most naturalists are atheists, it is not\ncontradictory to maintain that God exists but has nothing to do with\nmeaning in life or perhaps even detracts from it. Although these\ncombinations of positions are logically possible, some of them might\nbe substantively implausible. The field could benefit from discussion\nof the comparative attractiveness of various combinations of\nevaluative claims about what would make life meaningful and\nmetaphysical claims about whether spiritual conditions exist.  \nOver the past 15 years or so, two different types of supernaturalism\nhave become distinguished on a regular basis (Metz 2019). That is true\nnot only in the literature on life’s meaning, but also in that\non the related pro-theism/anti-theism debate, about whether it would\nbe desirable for God or a soul to exist (e.g., Kahane 2011; Kraay\n2018; Lougheed 2020). On the one hand, there is extreme\nsupernaturalism, according to which spiritual conditions are necessary\nfor any meaning in life. If neither God nor a soul exists, then, by\nthis view, everyone’s life is meaningless. On the other hand,\nthere is moderate supernaturalism, according to which spiritual\nconditions are necessary for a great or ultimate meaning in life,\nalthough not meaning in life as such. If neither God nor a soul\nexists, then, by this view, everyone’s life could have some\nmeaning, or even be meaningful, but no one’s life could exhibit\nthe most desirable meaning. For a moderate supernaturalist, God or a\nsoul would substantially enhance meaningfulness or be a major\ncontributory condition for it.  \nThere are a variety of ways that great or ultimate meaning has been\ndescribed, sometimes quantitatively as “infinite” (Mawson\n2016), qualitatively as “deeper” (Swinburne 2016),\nrelationally as “unlimited” (Nozick 1981, 618–19;\ncf. Waghorn 2014), temporally as “eternal” (Cottingham\n2016), and perspectivally as “from the point of view of the\nuniverse” (Benatar 2017). There has been no reflection as yet on\nthe crucial question of how these distinctions might bear on each\nanother, for instance, on whether some are more basic than others or\nsome are more valuable than others.  \nCross-cutting the extreme/moderate distinction is one between\nGod-centered theories and soul-centered ones. According to the former,\nsome kind of connection with God (understood to be a spiritual person\nwho is all-knowing, all-good, and all-powerful and who is the ground\nof the physical universe) constitutes meaning in life, even if one\nlacks a soul (construed as an immortal, spiritual substance that\ncontains one’s identity). In contrast, by the latter, having a\nsoul and putting it into a certain state is what makes life\nmeaningful, even if God does not exist. Many supernaturalists of\ncourse believe that God and a soul are jointly necessary for a\n(greatly) meaningful existence. However, the simpler view, that only\none of them is necessary, is common, and sometimes arguments proffered\nfor the complex view fail to support it any more than the simpler\none. \nThe most influential God-based account of meaning in life has been the\nextreme view that one’s existence is significant if and only if\none fulfills a purpose God has assigned. The familiar idea is that God\nhas a plan for the universe and that one’s life is meaningful\njust to the degree that one helps God realize this plan, perhaps in a\nparticular way that God wants one to do so. If a person failed to do\nwhat God intends her to do with her life (or if God does not even\nexist), then, on the current view, her life would be meaningless.  \nThinkers differ over what it is about God’s purpose that might\nmake it uniquely able to confer meaning on human lives, but the most\ninfluential argument has been that only God’s purpose could be\nthe source of invariant moral rules (Davis 1987, 296, 304–05;\nMoreland 1987, 124–29; Craig 1994/2013, 161–67) or of\nobjective values more generally (Cottingham 2005, 37–57), where\na lack of such would render our lives nonsensical. According to this\nargument, lower goods such as animal pleasure or desire satisfaction\ncould exist without God, but higher ones pertaining to meaning in\nlife, particularly moral virtue, could not. However, critics point to\nmany non-moral sources of meaning in life (e.g., Kekes 2000; Wolf\n2010), with one arguing that a universal moral code is not necessary\nfor meaning in life, even if, say, beneficent actions are (Ellin 1995,\n327). In addition, there are a variety of naturalist and\nnon-naturalist accounts of objective morality––and of\nvalue more generally––on offer these days, so that it is\nnot clear that it must have a supernatural source in God’s\nwill. \nOne recurrent objection to the idea that God’s purpose could\nmake life meaningful is that if God had created us with a purpose in\nmind, then God would have degraded us and thereby undercut the\npossibility of us obtaining meaning from fulfilling the purpose. The\nobjection harks back to Jean-Paul Sartre, but in the analytic\nliterature it appears that Kurt Baier was the first to articulate it\n(1957/2000, 118–20; see also Murphy 1982, 14–15; Singer\n1996, 29; Kahane 2011; Lougheed 2020, 121–41). Sometimes the\nconcern is the threat of punishment God would make so that we do\nGod’s bidding, while other times it is that the source of\nmeaning would be constrictive and not up to us, and still other times\nit is that our dignity would be maligned simply by having been created\nwith a certain end in mind (for some replies to such concerns, see\nHanfling 1987, 45–46; Cottingham 2005, 37–57; Lougheed\n2020, 111–21). \nThere is a different argument for an extreme God-based view that\nfocuses less on God as purposive and more on God as infinite,\nunlimited, or ineffable, which Robert Nozick first articulated with\ncare (Nozick 1981, 594–618; see also Bennett-Hunter 2014;\nWaghorn 2014). The core idea is that for a finite condition to be\nmeaningful, it must obtain its meaning from another condition that has\nmeaning. So, if one’s life is meaningful, it might be so in\nvirtue of being married to a person, who is important. Being finite,\nthe spouse must obtain his or her importance from elsewhere, perhaps\nfrom the sort of work he or she does. This work also must obtain its\nmeaning by being related to something else that is meaningful, and so\non. A regress on meaningful conditions is present, and the suggestion\nis that the regress can terminate only in something so\nall-encompassing that it need not (indeed, cannot) go beyond itself to\nobtain meaning from anything else. And that is God. The standard\nobjection to this relational rationale is that a finite condition\ncould be meaningful without obtaining its meaning from another\nmeaningful condition. Perhaps it could be meaningful in itself,\nwithout being connected to something beyond it, or maybe it could\nobtain its meaning by being related to something else that is\nbeautiful or otherwise valuable for its own sake but not meaningful\n(Nozick 1989, 167–68; Thomson 2003, 25–26, 48).  \nA serious concern for any extreme God-based view is the existence of\napparent counterexamples. If we think of the stereotypical lives of\nAlbert Einstein, Mother Teresa, and Pablo Picasso, they seem\nmeaningful even if we suppose there is no all-knowing, all-powerful,\nand all-good spiritual person who is the ground of the physical world\n(e.g., Wielenberg 2005, 31–37, 49–50; Landau 2017). Even\nreligiously inclined philosophers have found this hard to deny these\ndays (Quinn 2000, 58; Audi 2005; Mawson 2016, 5; Williams 2020,\n132–34).  \nLargely for that reason, contemporary supernaturalists have tended to\nopt for moderation, that is, to maintain that God would greatly\nenhance the meaning in our lives, even if some meaning would be\npossible in a world without God. One approach is to invoke the\nrelational argument to show that God is necessary, not for any meaning\nwhatsoever, but rather for an ultimate meaning. “Limited\ntranscendence, the transcending of our limits so as to connect with a\nwider context of value which itself is limited, does give our lives\nmeaning––but a limited one. We may thirst for more”\n(Nozick 1981, 618). Another angle is to appeal to playing a role in\nGod’s plan, again to claim, not that it is essential for meaning\nas such, but rather for “a cosmic significance....intead of a\nsignificance very limited in time and space” (Swinburne 2016,\n154; see also Quinn 2000; Cottingham 2016, 131). Another rationale is\nthat by fulfilling God’s purpose, we would meaningfully please\nGod, a perfect person, as well as be remembered favorably by God\nforever (Cottingham 2016, 135; Williams 2020, 21–22, 29, 101,\n108). Still another argument is that only with God could the deepest\ndesires of human nature be satisfied (e.g., Goetz 2012; Seachris 2013,\n20; Cottingham 2016, 127, 136), even if more surface desires could be\nsatisifed without God.  \nIn reply to such rationales for a moderate supernaturalism, there has\nbeen the suggestion that it is precisely by virtue of being alone in\nthe universe that our lives would be particularly significant;\notherwise, God’s greatness would overshadow us (Kahane 2014).\nThere has also been the response that, with the opportunity for\ngreater meaning from God would also come that for greater\nanti-meaning, so that it is not clear that a world with God would\noffer a net gain in respect of meaning (Metz 2019, 34–35). For\nexample, if pleasing God would greatly enhance meaning in our lives,\nthen presumably displeasing God would greatly reduce it and to a\ncomparable degree. In addition, there are arguments for extreme\nnaturalism (or its “anti-theist” cousin) mentioned below\n(sub-section 3.3).  \nNotice that none of the above arguments for supernaturalism appeals to\nthe prospect of eternal life (at least not explicitly). Arguments that\ndo make such an appeal are soul-centered, holding that meaning in life\nmainly comes from having an immortal, spiritual substance that is\ncontiguous with one’s body when it is alive and that will\nforever outlive its death. Some think of the afterlife in terms of\none’s soul entering a transcendent, spiritual realm (Heaven),\nwhile others conceive of one’s soul getting reincarnated into\nanother body on Earth. According to the extreme version, if one has a\nsoul but fails to put it in the right state (or if one lacks a soul\naltogether), then one’s life is meaningless. \nThere are three prominent arguments for an extreme soul-based\nperspective. One argument, made famous by Leo Tolstoy, is the\nsuggestion that for life to be meaningful something must be worth\ndoing, that something is worth doing only if it will make a permanent\ndifference to the world, and that doing so requires being immortal\n(see also Hanfling 1987, 22–24; Morris 1992, 26; Craig 1994).\nCritics most often appeal to counterexamples, suggesting for instance\nthat it is surely worth your time and effort to help prevent people\nfrom suffering, even if you and they are mortal. Indeed, some have\ngone on the offensive and argued that helping people is worth the\nsacrifice only if and because they are mortal, for otherwise they\ncould invariably be compensated in an afterlife (e.g., Wielenberg\n2005, 91–94). Another recent and interesting criticism is that\nthe major motivations for the claim that nothing matters now if one\nday it will end are incoherent (Greene 2021). \nA second argument for the view that life would be meaningless without\na soul is that it is necessary for justice to be done, which, in turn,\nis necessary for a meaningful life. Life seems nonsensical when the\nwicked flourish and the righteous suffer, at least supposing there is\nno other world in which these injustices will be rectified, whether by\nGod or a Karmic force. Something like this argument can be found in\nEcclesiastes, and it continues to be defended (e.g., Davis 1987; Craig\n1994). However, even granting that an afterlife is required for\nperfectly just outcomes, it is far from obvious that an\neternal afterlife is necessary for them, and, then, there is\nthe suggestion that some lives, such as Mandela’s, have been\nmeaningful precisely in virtue of encountering injustice and fighting\nit.  \nA third argument for thinking that having a soul is essential for any\nmeaning is that it is required to have the sort of free will without\nwhich our lives would be meaningless. Immanuel Kant is known for\nhaving maintained that if we were merely physical beings, subjected to\nthe laws of nature like everything else in the material world, then we\ncould not act for moral reasons and hence would be unimportant. More\nrecently, one theologian has eloquently put the point in religious\nterms: “The moral spirit finds the meaning of life in choice. It\nfinds it in that which proceeds from man and remains with him as his\ninner essence rather than in the accidents of circumstances turns of\nexternal fortune....(W)henever a human being rubs the lamp of his\nmoral conscience, a Spirit does appear. This Spirit is God....It is in\nthe ‘Thou must’ of God and man’s ‘I can’\nthat the divine image of God in human life is contained”\n(Swenson 1949/2000, 27–28). Notice that, even if moral norms did\nnot spring from God’s commands, the logic of the argument\nentails that one’s life could be meaningful, so long as one had\nthe inherent ability to make the morally correct choice in any\nsituation. That, in turn, arguably requires something non-physical\nabout one’s self, so as to be able to overcome whichever\nphysical laws and forces one might confront. The standard objection to\nthis reasoning is to advance a compatibilism about having a determined\nphysical nature and being able to act for moral reasons (e.g., Arpaly\n2006; Fischer 2009, 145–77). It is also worth wondering whether,\nif one had to have a spiritual essence in order to make free choices,\nit would have to be one that never perished. \nLike God-centered theorists, many soul-centered theorists these days\nadvance a moderate view, accepting that some meaning in life would be\npossible without immortality, but arguing that a much greater meaning\nwould be possible with it. Granting that Einstein, Mandela, and\nPicasso had somewhat meaningful lives despite not having survived the\ndeaths of their bodies (as per, e.g., Trisel 2004; Wolf 2015,\n89–140; Landau 2017), there remains a powerful thought: more is\nbetter. If a finite life with the good, the true, and the beautiful\nhas meaning in it to some degree, then surely it would have all the\nmore meaning if it exhibited such higher values––including\na relationship with God––for an eternity (Cottingham 2016,\n132–35; Mawson 2016, 2019, 52–53; Williams 2020,\n112–34; cf. Benatar 2017, 35–63). One objection to this\nreasoning is that the infinity of meaning that would be possible with\na soul would be “too big,” rendering it difficult for the\nmoderate supernaturalist to make sense of the intution that a finite\nlife such as Einstein’s can indeed count as meaningful by\ncomparison (Metz 2019, 30–31; cf. Mawson 2019, 53–54).\nMore common, though, is the objection that an eternal life would\ninclude anti-meaning of various kinds, such as boredom and repetition,\ndiscussed below in the context of extreme naturalism (sub-section\n3.3).  \nRecall that naturalism is the view that a physical life is central to\nlife’s meaning, that even if there is no spiritual realm, a\nsubstantially meaningful life is possible. Like supernaturalism,\ncontemporary naturalism admits of two distinguishable variants,\nmoderate and extreme (Metz 2019). The moderate version is that, while\na genuinely meaningful life could be had in a purely physical universe\nas known well by science, a somewhat more meaningful life would be\npossible if a spiritual realm also existed. God or a soul could\nenhance meaning in life, although they would not be major\ncontributors. The extreme version of naturalism is the view that it\nwould be better in respect of life’s meaning if there were no\nspiritual realm. From this perspective, God or a soul would be\nanti-matter, i.e., would detract from the meaning available to us,\nmaking a purely physical world (even if not this particular one)\npreferable.  \nCross-cutting the moderate/extreme distinction is that between\nsubjectivism and objectivism, which are theoretical accounts of the\nnature of meaningfulness insofar as it is physical. They differ in\nterms of the extent to which the human mind constitutes meaning and\nwhether there are conditions of meaning that are invariant among human\nbeings. Subjectivists believe that there are no invariant standards of\nmeaning because meaning is relative to the subject, i.e., depends on\nan individual’s pro-attitudes such as her particular desires or\nends, which are not shared by everyone. Roughly, something is\nmeaningful for a person if she strongly wants it or intends to seek it\nout and she gets it. Objectivists maintain, in contrast, that there\nare some invariant standards for meaning because meaning is at least\npartly mind-independent, i.e., obtains not merely in virtue of being\nthe object of anyone’s mental states. Here, something is\nmeaningful (partially) because of its intrinsic nature, in the sense\nof being independent of whether it is wanted or intended; meaning is\ninstead (to some extent) the sort of thing that merits these\nreactions. \nThere is logical space for an orthogonal view, according to which\nthere are invariant standards of meaningfulness constituted by what\nall human beings would converge on from a certain standpoint. However,\nit has not been much of a player in the field (Darwall 1983,\n164–66).  \nAccording to this version of naturalism, meaning in life varies from\nperson to person, depending on each one’s variable\npro-attitudes. Common instances are views that one’s life is\nmore meaningful, the more one gets what one happens to want strongly,\nachieves one’s highly ranked goals, or does what one believes to\nbe really important (Trisel 2002; Hooker 2008). One influential\nsubjectivist has recently maintained that the relevant mental state is\ncaring or loving, so that life is meaningful just to the extent that\none cares about or loves something (Frankfurt 1988, 80–94,\n2004). Another recent proposal is that meaningfulness consists of\n“an active engagement and affirmation that vivifies the person\nwho has freely created or accepted and now promotes and nurtures the\nprojects of her highest concern” (Belliotti 2019, 183). \nSubjectivism was dominant in the middle of the twentieth century, when\npositivism, noncognitivism, existentialism, and Humeanism were\ninfluential (Ayer 1947; Hare 1957; Barnes 1967; Taylor 1970; Williams\n1976). However, in the last quarter of the twentieth century,\ninference to the best explanation and reflective equilibrium became\naccepted forms of normative argumentation and were frequently used to\ndefend claims about the existence and nature of objective value (or of\n“external reasons,” ones obtaining independently of\none’s extant attitudes). As a result, subjectivism about meaning\nlost its dominance. Those who continue to hold subjectivism often\nremain suspicious of attempts to justify beliefs about objective value\n(e.g., Trisel 2002, 73, 79, 2004, 378–79; Frankfurt 2004,\n47–48, 55–57; Wong 2008, 138–39; Evers 2017, 32, 36;\nSvensson 2017, 54). Theorists are moved to accept subjectivism\ntypically because the alternatives are unpalatable; they are\nreasonably sure that meaning in life obtains for some people, but do\nnot see how it could be grounded on something independent of the mind,\nwhether it be the natural or the supernatural (or the non-natural). In\ncontrast to these possibilities, it appears straightforward to account\nfor what is meaningful in terms of what people find meaningful or what\npeople want out of their lives. Wide-ranging meta-ethical debates in\nepistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language are\nnecessary to address this rationale for subjectivism. \nThere is a cluster of other, more circumscribed arguments for\nsubjectivism, according to which this theory best explains certain\nintuitive features of meaning in life. For one, subjectivism seems\nplausible since it is reasonable to think that a meaningful life is an\nauthentic one (Frankfurt 1988, 80–94). If a person’s life\nis significant insofar as she is true to herself or her deepest\nnature, then we have some reason to believe that meaning simply is a\nfunction of those matters for which the person cares. For another, it\nis uncontroversial that often meaning comes from losing oneself, i.e.,\nin becoming absorbed in an activity or experience, as opposed to being\nbored by it or finding it frustrating (Frankfurt 1988, 80–94;\nBelliotti 2019, 162–70). Work that concentrates the mind and\nrelationships that are engrossing seem central to meaning and to be so\nbecause of the subjective elements involved. For a third, meaning is\noften taken to be something that makes life worth continuing for a\nspecific person, i.e., that gives her a reason to get out of bed in\nthe morning, which subjectivism is thought to account for best\n(Williams 1976; Svensson 2017; Calhoun 2018).  \nCritics maintain that these arguments are vulnerable to a common\nobjection: they neglect the role of objective value (or an external\nreason) in realizing oneself, losing oneself, and having a reason to\nlive (Taylor 1989, 1992; Wolf 2010, 2015, 89–140). One is not\nreally being true to oneself, losing oneself in a meaningful way, or\nhaving a genuine reason to live insofar as one, say, successfully\nmaintains 3,732 hairs on one’s head (Taylor 1992, 36),\ncultivates one’s prowess at long-distance spitting (Wolf 2010,\n104), collects a big ball of string (Wolf 2010, 104), or, well, eats\none’s own excrement (Wielenberg 2005, 22). The counterexamples\nsuggest that subjective conditions are insufficient to ground meaning\nin life; there seem to be certain actions, relationships, and states\nthat are objectively valuable (but see Evers 2017, 30–32) and\ntoward which one’s pro-attitudes ought to be oriented, if\nmeaning is to accrue. \nSo say objectivists, but subjectivists feel the pull of the point and\nusually seek to avoid the counterexamples, lest they have to bite the\nbullet by accepting the meaningfulness of maintaining 3,732 hairs on\none’s head and all the rest (for some who do, see Svensson 2017,\n54–55; Belliotti 2019, 181–83). One important strategy is\nto suggest that subjectivists can avoid the counterexamples by\nappealing to the right sort of pro-attitude. Instead of whatever an\nindividual happens to want, perhaps the relevant mental state is an\nemotional-perceptual one of seeing-as (Alexis 2011; cf. Hosseini 2015,\n47–66), a “categorical” desire, that is, an\nintrinsic desire constitutive of one’s identity that one takes\nto make life worth continuing (Svensson 2017), or a judgment that one\nhas a good reason to value something highly for its own sake (Calhoun\n2018). Even here, though, objectivists will argue that it might\n“appear that whatever the will chooses to treat as a good reason\nto engage itself is, for the will, a good reason. But the will\nitself....craves objective reasons; and often it could not go forward\nunless it thought it had them” (Wiggins 1988, 136). And without\nany appeal to objectivity, it is perhaps likely that counterexamples\nwould resurface.  \nAnother subjectivist strategy by which to deal with the\ncounterexamples is the attempt to ground meaningfulness, not on the\npro-attitudes of an individual valuer, but on those of a group\n(Darwall 1983, 164–66; Brogaard and Smith 2005; Wong 2008). Does\nsuch an intersubjective move avoid (more of) the counterexamples? If\nso, does it do so more plausibly than an objective theory? \nObjective naturalists believe that meaning in life is constituted at\nleast in part by something physical beyond merely the fact that it is\nthe object of a pro-attitude. Obtaining the object of some emotion,\ndesire, or judgment is not sufficient for meaningfulness, on this\nview. Instead, there are certain conditions of the material world that\ncould confer meaning on anyone’s life, not merely because they\nare viewed as meaningful, wanted for their own sake, or believed to be\nchoiceworthy, but instead (at least partially) because they are\ninherently worthwhile or valuable in themselves. \nMorality (the good), enquiry (the true), and creativity (the\nbeautiful) are widely held instances of activities that confer meaning\non life, while trimming toenails and eating snow––along\nwith the counterexamples to subjectivism above––are not.\nObjectivism is widely thought to be a powerful general explanation of\nthese particular judgments: the former are meaningful not merely\nbecause some agent (whether it is an individual, her society, or even\nGod) cares about them or judges them to be worth doing, while the\nlatter simply lack significance and cannot obtain it even if some\nagent does care about them or judge them to be worth doing. From an\nobjective perspective, it is possible for an individual to care about\nthe wrong thing or to be mistaken that something is worthwhile, and\nnot merely because of something she cares about all the more or judges\nto be still more choiceworthy. Of course, meta-ethical debates about\nthe existence and nature of value are again relevant to appraising\nthis rationale. \nSome objectivists think that being the object of a person’s\nmental states plays no constitutive role in making that person’s\nlife meaningful, although they of course contend that it often plays\nan instrumental role––liking a certain activity, after\nall, is likely to motivate one to do it. Relatively few objectivists\nare “pure” in that way, although consequentialists do\nstand out as clear instances (e.g., Singer 1995; Smuts 2018,\n75–99). Most objectivists instead try to account for the above\nintuitions driving subjectivism by holding that a life is more\nmeaningful, not merely because of objective factors, but also in part\nbecause of propositional attitudes such as cognition, conation, and\nemotion. Particularly influential has been Susan Wolf’s hybrid\nview, captured by this pithy slogan: “Meaning arises when\nsubjective attraction meets objective attractiveness” (Wolf\n2015, 112; see also Kekes 1986, 2000; Wiggins 1988; Raz 2001,\n10–40; Mintoff 2008; Wolf 2010, 2016; Fischer 2019, 9–23;\nBelshaw 2021, 160–81). This theory implies that no meaning\naccrues to one’s life if one believes in, is satisfied by, or\ncares about a project that is not truly worthwhile, or if one takes up\na truly worthwhile project but fails to judge it important, be\nsatisfied by it, or care about it. A related approach is that, while\nsubjective attraction is not necessary for meaning, it could enhance\nit (e.g., Audi 2005, 344; Metz 2013, 183–84, 196–98,\n220–25). For instance, a stereotypical Mother Teresa who is\nbored by and alienated from her substantial charity work might have a\nsomewhat significant existence because of it, even if she would have\nan even more significant existence if she felt pride in it or\nidentified with it. \nThere have been several attempts to capture theoretically what all\nobjectively attractive, inherently worthwhile, or finally valuable\nconditions have in common insofar as they bear on meaning in a\nperson’s life. Over the past few decades, one encounters the\nproposals that objectively meaningful conditions are just those that\ninvolve: positively connecting with organic unity beyond oneself\n(Nozick 1981, 594–619); being creative (Taylor 1987; Matheson\n2018); living an emotional life (Solomon 1993; cf. Williams 2020,\n56–78); promoting good consequences, such as improving the\nquality of life of oneself and others (Singer 1995; Audi 2005; Smuts\n2018, 75–99); exercising or fostering rational nature in\nexceptional ways (Smith 1997, 179–221; Gewirth 1998,\n177–82; Metz 2013, 222–36); progressing toward ends that\ncan never be fully realized because one’s knowledge of them\nchanges as one approaches them (Levy 2005); realizing goals that are\ntranscendent for being long-lasting in duration and broad in scope\n(Mintoff 2008); living virtuously (May 2015, 61–138; McPherson\n2020); and loving what is worth loving (Wolf 2016). There is as yet no\nconvergence in the field on one, or even a small cluster, of these\naccounts.  \nOne feature of a large majority of the above naturalist theories is\nthat they are aggregative or additive, objectionably treating a life\nas a mere “container” of bits of life that are meaningful\nconsidered in isolation from other bits (Brännmark 2003, 330). It\nhas become increasingly common for philosophers of life’s\nmeaning, especially objectivists, to hold that life as a whole, or at\nleast long stretches of it, can substantially affect its\nmeaningfulness beyond the amount of meaning (if any) in its parts.\n \nFor instance, a life that has lots of beneficence and otherwise\nintuitively meaning-conferring conditions but that is also extremely\nrepetitive (à la the movie Groundhog Day) is less than\nmaximally meaningful (Taylor 1987; Blumenfeld 2009). Furthermore, a\nlife that not only avoids repetition but also ends with a substantial\namount of meaningful (or otherwise desirable) parts seems to have more\nmeaning overall than one that has the same amount of meaningful\n(desirable) parts but ends with few or none of them (Kamm 2013,\n18–22; Dorsey 2015). Still more, a life in which its meaningless\n(or otherwise undesirable parts) cause its meaningful (desirable)\nparts to come about through a process of personal growth seems\nmeaningful in virtue of this redemptive pattern, “good\nlife-story,” or narrative self-expression (Taylor 1989,\n48–51; Wong 2008; Fischer 2009, 145–77; Kauppinen 2012;\nMay 2015, 61–138; Velleman 2015, 141–73). These three\ncases suggest that meaning can inhere in life as a whole, that is, in\nthe relationships between its parts, and not merely in the parts\nconsidered in isolation. However, some would maintain that it is,\nstrictly speaking, the story that is or could be told of a life that\nmatters, not so much the life-story qua relations between\nevents themselves (de Bres 2018). \nThere are pure or extreme versions of holism present in the\nliterature, according to which the only possible bearer of meaning in\nlife is a person’s life as a whole, and not any isolated\nactivities, relationships, or states (Taylor 1989, 48–51;\nTabensky 2003; Levinson 2004). A salient argument for this position is\nthat judgments of the meaningfulness of a part of someone’s life\nare merely provisional, open to revision upon considering how they fit\ninto a wider perspective. So, for example, it would initially appear\nthat taking an ax away from a madman and thereby protecting innocent\nparties confers some meaning on one’s life, but one might well\nrevise that judgment upon learning that the intention behind it was\nmerely to steal an ax, not to save lives, or that the madman then took\nout a machine gun, causing much more harm than his ax would have. It\nis worth considering how far this sort of case is generalizable, and,\nif it can be to a substantial extent, whether that provides strong\nevidence that only life as a whole can exhibit meaningfulness. \nPerhaps most objectivists would, at least upon reflection, accept that\nboth the parts of a life and the whole-life relationships among the\nparts can exhibit meaning. Supposing there are two bearers of meaning\nin a life, important questions arise. One is whether a certain\nnarrative can be meaningful even if its parts are not, while a second\nis whether the meaningfulness of a part increases if it is an aspect\nof a meaningful whole (on which see Brännmark 2003), and a third\nis whether there is anything revealing to say about how to make\ntradeoffs between the parts and whole in cases where one must choose\nbetween them (Blumenfeld 2009 appears to assign lexical priority to\nthe whole). \nNaturalists until recently had been largely concerned to show that\nmeaning in life is possible without God or a soul; they have not spent\nmuch time considering how such spiritual conditions might enhance\nmeaning, but have, in moderate fashion, tended to leave that\npossibility open (an exception is Hooker 2008). Lately, however, an\nextreme form of naturalism has arisen, according to which our lives\nwould probably, if not unavoidably, have less meaning in a world with\nGod or a soul than in one without. Although such an approach was\nvoiced early on by Baier (1957), it is really in the past decade or so\nthat this “anti-theist” position has become widely and\nintricately discussed. \nOne rationale, mentioned above as an objection to the view that\nGod’s purpose constitutes meaning in life, has also been\ndeployed to argue that the existence of God as such would necessarily\nreduce meaning, that is, would consist of anti-matter. It is the idea\nthat master/servant and parent/child analogies so prominent in the\nmonotheist religious traditions reveal something about our status in a\nworld where there is a qualitatively higher being who has created us\nwith certain ends in mind: our independence or dignity as adult\npersons would be violated (e.g., Baier 1957/2000, 118–20; Kahane\n2011, 681–85; Lougheed 2020, 121–41). One interesting\nobjection to this reasoning has been to accept that God’s\nexistence is necessarily incompatible with the sort of meaning that\nwould come (roughly stated) from being one’s own boss, but to\nargue that God would also make greater sorts of meaning available,\noffering a net gain to us (Mawson 2016, 110–58). \nAnother salient argument for thinking that God would detract from\nmeaning in life appeals to the value of privacy (Kahane 2011,\n681–85; Lougheed 2020, 55–110). God’s omniscience\nwould unavoidably make it impossible for us to control another\nperson’s access to the most intimate details about ourselves,\nwhich, for some, amounts to a less meaningful life than one with such\ncontrol. Beyond questioning the value of our privacy in relation to\nGod, one thought-provoking criticism has been to suggest that, if a\nlack of privacy really would substantially reduce meaning in our\nlives, then God, qua morally perfect person, would simply\navoid knowing everything about us (Tooley 2018). Lacking complete\nknowledge of our mental states would be compatible with describing God\nas “omniscient,” so the criticism goes, insofar as that is\nplausibly understood as having as much knowledge as is morally\npermissible.  \nTurn, now, to major arguments for thinking that having a soul would\nreduce life’s meaning, so that if one wants a maximally\nmeaningful life, one should prefer a purely physical world, or at\nleast one in which people are mortal. First and foremost, there has\nbeen the argument that an immortal life could not avoid becoming\nboring (Williams 1973), rendering life pointless according to many\nsubjective and objective theories. The literature on this topic has\nbecome enormous, with the central reply being that immortality need\nnot get boring (for more recent discussions, see Fischer 2009,\n79–101, 2019, 117–42; Mawson 2019, 51–52; Williams\n2020, 30–41, 123–29; Belshaw 2021, 182–97). However,\nit might also be worth questioning whether boredom is sufficient for\nmeaninglessness. Suppose, for instance, that one volunteers to be\nbored so that many others will not be bored; perhaps this would be a\nmeaningful sacrifice to make. Being bored for an eternity would not be\nblissful or even satisfying, to be sure, but if it served the function\nof preventing others from being bored for an eternity, would it be\nmeaningful (at least to some degree)? If, as is commonly held,\nsacrificing one’s life could be meaningful, why not also\nsacrificing one’s liveliness? \nAnother reason given to reject eternal life is that it would become\nrepetitive, which would substantially drain it of meaning (Scarre\n2007, 54–55; May 2009, 46–47, 64–65, 71; Smuts 2011,\n142–44; cf. Blumenfeld 2009). If, as it appears, there are only\na finite number of actions one could perform, relationships one could\nhave, and states one could be in during an eternity, one would have to\nend up doing the same things again. Even though one’s activities\nmight be more valuable than rolling a stone up a hill forever à\nla Sisyphus, the prospect of doing them over and over again forever is\ndisheartening for many. To be sure, one might not remember having done\nthem before and hence could avoid boredom, but for some philosophers\nthat would make it all the worse, akin to having dementia and\nforgetting that one has told the same stories. Others, however, still\nfind meaning in such a life (e.g., Belshaw 2021, 197, 205n41). \nA third meaning-based argument against immortality invokes\nconsiderations of narrative. If the pattern of one’s life as a\nwhole substantially matters, and if a proper pattern would including a\nbeginning, a middle, and an end, it appears that a life that never\nends would lack the relevant narrative structure. “Because it\nwould drag on endlessly, it would, sooner or later, just be a string\nof events lacking all form....With immortality, the novel never\nends....How meaningful can such a novel be?” (May 2009, 68, 72;\nsee also Scarre 2007, 58–60). Notice that this objection is\ndistinct from considerations of boredom and repetition (which concern\nnovelty); even if one were stimulated and active, and even if\none found a way not to repeat one’s life in the course of\neternity, an immortal life would appear to lack shape. In reply, some\nreject the idea that a meaningful life must be akin to a novel, and\nintead opt for narrativity in the form of something like a string of\nshort stories that build on each other (Fischer 2009, 145–77,\n2019, 101–16). Others, though, have sought to show that eternity\ncould still be novel-like, deeming the sort of ending that matters to\nbe a function of what the content is and how it relates to the content\nthat came before (e.g., Seachris 2011; Williams 2020,\n112–19). \nThere have been additional objections to immortality as undercutting\nmeaningfulness, but they are prima facie less powerful than the\nprevious three in that, if sound, they arguably show that an eternal\nlife would have a cost, but probably not one that would utterly\nocclude the prospect of meaning in it. For example, there have been\nthe suggestions that eternal lives would lack a sense of preciousness\nand urgency (Nussbaum 1989, 339; Kass 2002, 266–67), could not\nexemplify virtues such as courageously risking one’s life for\nothers (Kass 2002, 267–68; Wielenberg 2005, 91–94), and\ncould not obtain meaning from sustaining or saving others’ lives\n(Nussbaum 1989, 338; Wielenberg 2005, 91–94). Note that at least\nthe first two rationales turn substantially on the belief in\nimmortality, not quite immortality itself: if one were immortal but\nforgot that one is or did not know that at all, then one could\nappreciate life and obtain much of the virtue of courage (and,\nconversely, if one were not immortal, but thought that one is, then,\nby the logic of these arguments, one would fail to appreciate limits\nand be unable to exemplify courage). \nThe previous two sections addressed theoretical accounts of what would\nconfer meaning on a human person’s life. Although these theories\ndo not imply that some people’s lives are in fact meaningful,\nthat has been the presumption of a very large majority of those who\nhave advanced them. Much of the procedure has been to suppose that\nmany lives have had meaning in them and then to consider in virtue of\nwhat they have or otherwise could. However, there are nihilist (or\npessimist) perspectives that question this supposition. According to\nnihilism (pessimism), what would make a life meaningful in principle\ncannot obtain for any of us. \nOne straightforward rationale for nihilism is the combination of\nextreme supernaturalism about what makes life meaningful and atheism\nabout whether a spiritual realm exists. If you believe that God or a\nsoul is necessary for meaning in life, and if you believe that neither\nis real, then you are committed to nihilism, to the denial that life\ncan have any meaning. Athough this rationale for nihilism was\nprominent in the modern era (and was more or less Camus’\nposition), it has been on the wane in analytic philosophical circles,\nas extreme supernaturalism has been eclipsed by the moderate variety.\n \nThe most common rationales for nihilism these days do not appeal to\nsupernaturalism, or at least not explicitly. One cluster of ideas\nappeals to what meta-ethicists call “error theory,” the\nview that evaluative claims (in this case about meaning in life, or\nabout morality qua necessary for meaning) characteristically\nposit objectively real or universally justified values, but that such\nvalues do not exist. According to one version, value judgments often\nanalytically include a claim to objectivity but there is no reason to\nthink that objective values exist, as they “would be entities or\nqualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from\nanything else in the universe” (Mackie 1977/1990, 38). According\nto a second version, life would be meaningless if there were no set of\nmoral standards that could be fully justified to all rational\nenquirers, but it so happens that such standards cannot exist for\npersons who can always reasonably question a given claim (Murphy 1982,\n12–17). According to a third, we hold certain beliefs about the\nobjectivity and universality of morality and related values such as\nmeaning because they were evolutionarily advantageous to our\nancestors, not because they are true. Humans have been “deceived\nby their genes into thinking that there is a distinterested, objective\nmorality binding upon them, which all should obey” (Ruse and\nWilson 1986, 179; cf. Street 2015). One must draw on the intricate\nwork in meta-ethics that has been underway for the past several\ndecades in order to appraise these arguments.  \nIn contrast to error-theoretic arguments for nihilism, there are\nrationales for it accepting that objective values exist but denying\nthat our lives can ever exhibit or promote them so as to obtain\nmeaning. One version of this approach maintains that, for our lives to\nmatter, we must be in a position to add objective value to the world,\nwhich we are not since the objective value of the world is already\ninfinite (Smith 2003). The key premises for this view are that every\nbit of space-time (or at least the stars in the physical universe)\nhave some positive value, that these values can be added up, and that\nspace is infinite. If the physical world at present contains an\ninfinite degree of value, nothing we do can make a difference in terms\nof meaning, for infinity plus any amount of value remains infinity.\nOne way to question this argument, beyond doubting the value of\nspace-time or stars, is to suggest that, even if one cannot add to the\nvalue of the universe, meaning plausibly comes from being the\nsource of certain values.  \nA second rationale for nihilism that accepts the existence of\nobjective value is David Benatar’s (2006, 18–59)\nintriguing “asymmetry argument” for anti-natalism, the\nview that it is immoral to bring new people into existence because\ndoing so would always be on balance bad for them. For Benatar, the\nbads of existing (e.g., pains) are real disadvantages relative to not\nexisting, while the goods of existing (pleasures) are not real\nadvantages relative to not existing, since there is in the latter\nstate no one to be deprived of them. If indeed the state of not\nexisting is no worse than that of experiencing the benefits of\nexistence, then, since existing invariably brings harm in its wake, it\nfollows that existing is always worse compared to not existing.\nAlthough this argument is illustrated with experiential goods and\nbads, it seems generalizable to non-experiential ones, including\nmeaning in life and anti-matter. The literature on this argument has\nbecome large (for a recent collection, see Hauskeller and Hallich\n2022). \nBenatar (2006, 60–92, 2017, 35–63) has advanced an\nadditional argument for nihilism, one that appeals to Thomas\nNagel’s (1986, 208–32) widely discussed analysis of the\nextremely external standpoint that human persons can take on their\nlives. There exists, to use Henry Sidgwick’s influential phrase,\nthe “point of view of the universe,” that is, the\nstandpoint that considers a human being’s life in relation to\nall times and all places. When one takes up this most external\nstandpoint and views one’s puny impact on the world, little of\none’s life appears to matter. What one does in a certain society\non Earth over 75 years or so just does not amount to much, when\nconsidering the billions of temporal years and billions of light-years\nthat make up space-time. Although this reasoning grants limited kinds\nof meaning to human beings, from a personal, social, or human\nperspective, Benatar both denies that the greatest sort of\nmeaning––a cosmic one––is available to them\nand contends that this makes their lives bad, hence the\n“nihilist” tag. Some have objected that our lives could in\nfact have a cosmic significance, say, if they played a role in\nGod’s plan (Quinn 2000, 65–66; Swinburne 2016, 154), were\nthe sole ones with a dignity in the universe (Kahane 2014), or engaged\nin valuable activities that could be appreciated by anyone anywhere\nanytime (Wolf 2016, 261–62). Others naturally maintain that\ncosmic significance is irrelevant to appraising a human life, with\nsome denying that it would be a genuine source of meaning (Landau\n2017, 93–99), and others accepting that it would be but\nmaintaining that the absence of this good would not count as a bad or\nmerit regret (discussed in Benatar 2017, 56–62; Williams 2020,\n108–11). \nFinally, a distinguishable source of nihilism concerns the\nontological, as distinct from axiological, preconditions for meaning\nin life. Perhaps most radically, there are those who deny that we have\nselves. Do we indeed lack selves, and, if we do, is a meaningful life\nimpossible for us (see essays in Caruso and Flanagan 2018; Le Bihan\n2019)? Somewhat less radically, there are those who grant that we have\nselves, but deny that they are in charge in the relevant way. That is,\nsome have argued that we lack self-governance or free will of the sort\nthat is essential for meaning in life, at least if determinism is true\n(Pisciotta 2013; essays in Caruso and Flanagan 2018). Non-quantum\nevents, including human decisions, appear to be necessited by a prior\nstate of the world, such that none could have been otherwise, and many\nof our decisions are a product of unconscious neurological mechanisms\n(while quantum events are of course utterly beyond our control). If\nnone of our conscious choices could have been avoided and all were\nultimately necessited by something external to them, perhaps they are\ninsufficient to merit pride or admiration or to constitute narrative\nauthorship of a life. In reply, some maintain that a compatibilism\nbetween determinism and moral responsibility applies with comparable\nforce to meaning in life (e.g., Arpaly 2006; Fischer 2009,\n145–77), while others contend that incompatibilism is true of\nmoral responsibility but not of meaning (Pereboom 2014).
