Initially, in the first half of\nthe century, it was a discourse of liberation from colonial rule in\nHispanic America. Later, in the second half, liberalism was firmly\nestablished as an ideology of nation building in most of the region.\nHowever, by the mid twentieth century, liberalism had mostly vanished\nfrom the political scene, except for the case of Colombia where the\nliberal party continued to be a live political option until the end of\nthe century. Despite the fact that it became the dominant political\ndiscourse in the nineteenth century, there is no such thing as Latin\nAmerican or Hispanic American “liberalism”, if by the\nlatter we mean something like a unified and internally coherent\npolitical theory. Instead, what emerged in the nineteenth century was\na political movement that can appropriately be called\n“liberal” to the extent that political actors either\nespoused liberal ideas or identified themselves as\n“liberals”, or both. Though such a political movement\nbegan to take shape in the aftermath of the wars of independence from\nSpain and Portugal, self-identification as a member of a liberal group\nbecame possible around the mid-century when the liberal position\nbecame more definite in relation to the conservative political\nopposition.\n\n\nA difficulty for the reconstruction of liberalism in Latin America\nlies in the fact that political actors primarily employed liberal\nideas in order to press for specific political ends but were not\ngreatly concerned with systematic theorizing. Liberal intellectuals\nwere public figures who engaged in the task of advocating liberal\nideas in order to transform their new societies in light of them. They\nwere mainly concerned with the practical tasks of constitutional\ndesign and institutional reform. Thus, the liberal movement emerged\nmainly in political and legal practice, not in theoretical works.\nLiberal intellectuals expressed and developed their views in the\nnumerous constitutions that they produced, in legal commentary, and in\nthe public debates that took place in pamphlets and newspapers. This\nmay be the reason why the reconstruction of Latin American nineteenth\ncentury liberalism has been dominated by historians, while\nphilosophers and political theorists have been mostly absent.\nNevertheless, this reconstruction is also of philosophical interest\nfor at least two reasons. First, the most prominent liberal\nintellectuals, such as Juan Bautista Alberdi in Argentina, José\nMaría Luis Mora in Mexico, and José Victorino Lastarria\nin Chile, did develop distinctive liberal positions that are worth\nexamining. Alberdi and Lastarria, in particular, also produced\ntheoretical works in which they systematized their own political\nconvictions. Second, though it is not straightforward to identify what\nexactly was meant by “liberalism” in each region at each\nparticular time since public intellectuals expressed a plurality of\nviews, it is not difficult to see that distinctively liberal positions\ndeveloped in response to local political problems. In the various\nregions of Latin America, liberalism developed in different directions\naccording to the political problems that political actors considered\nmost pressing. Since what was meant by “liberalism” turns\nout to be sometimes surprising from a contemporary perspective, the\nconsideration of nineteenth century Latin American liberalism can\ncontribute to enrich our current understanding of liberalism as a far\nmore internally heterogeneous ideology than is usually assumed.\n\n\nIn light of the variety and complexity of Latin American liberal\nviews, this entry provides only a brief and general introduction to\nthe topic that is far from being the whole story. Since the heyday of\nLatin American liberalism took place in the nineteenth century, this\nentry privileges this historical period, though the last section\nfocuses on the decline of liberalism in the twentieth century and its\nmodest revival in recent decades. In order to adequately present the\nliberal political movement, it has been indispensable to provide the\nhighlights of the social and political context that motivated the\ninitial enthusiastic appropriation of liberal ideas as well as their\nfurther development. This entry also provides closer though brief\napproximations to the views developed by the most prominent liberal\nintellectuals mentioned earlier, namely, Alberdi, Mora, and Lastarria.\nSince they articulated their own views in quite different political\ncontexts, their respective liberal views differ greatly from each\nother. Though the entry is organized thematically, it also roughly\nfollows a chronological order. The first section offers a brief\noverview. The second section presents the influence of Spanish\nliberalism in the initial reception of liberal ideas around the time\nof the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. The third\nsection presents early Hispanic American liberalism as an emancipatory\nideology that commanded wide acceptance among the elites. The fourth\nsection considers the transition from the initial constitutional\noptimism to the search for alternative ways for bringing about the\nmuch desired social and political change. The fifth section focuses on\nthe ideological conflict between liberals and conservatives around the\nmid-nineteenth century. It was in the midst of this conflict that the\nliberal faction acquired a specific political identity. The sixth\nsection presents the liberal anticlerical response to the religious\nproblem. The seventh section considers the influence of positivism and\nthe triumph of liberalism as an ideology of nation building. The final\nsection briefly considers the decline of liberalism in the early\ndecades of the twentieth century.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal ideas first became widespread in Latin American due to the\ninfluence of the 1812 liberal Cadiz constitution which was in force in\nthe Spanish empire for two years until the reestablishment of absolute\nrule. At the beginning of the century, “liberalism” in\nthis context primarily meant what Spanish liberals meant by it in the\ndebates that took place in the Cadiz Courts, which met as a sovereign\nnational assembly in response to the Napoleonic invasion of the\nIberian peninsula in 1808. It was in this setting that the term\n“liberal” was for the first time employed in a political\nsense to refer to a political group (Breña 2012). Since the\nCadiz constitution was, in turn, heavily influenced by the political\nideas of the French Revolution, the first liberal ideas in Latin\nAmerica had likewise primarily this origin. Ideas such as popular\nsovereignty, civil equality, individual representation, the\nconventional nature of political authority, freedom of thought and of\nthe press, and a division of powers that privileges the legislative\nbecame central to early Latin American liberalism. The latter was by\nno means identical to Spanish liberalism or to the political ideas of\nthe French revolution, but these two are its main initial sources. \nThe crisis of the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies upon the\nNapoleonic invasion set off the process of independence in of most of\nLatin America and opened the way for the free circulation, for the\nfirst time, of modern political ideas in the region (the Spanish and\nPortuguese inquisitions had prohibited freedom of thought and of the\npress). Though the Cadiz constitution was influential in both Hispanic\nand Portuguese Americas, liberalism developed in quite different\ndirections in these two regions. The reason for this lies in the two\nquite different ways in which the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies\nresponded to the French invasion. While the flight of the Spanish king\ntossed the empire into a political crisis, the Portuguese were able to\nmaintain political stability by transferring the capital of the empire\nto Brazil. Thus, questions about the source of legitimate political\nauthority became pressing in Hispanic America, but were not as\ncritical Brazil. Although the initial answers that Hispanic Americans\noffered were framed in terms of traditional scholastic political\nthinking, they soon began to appeal to the political ideas of the\nFrench revolution, specifically to the idea of popular sovereignty.\nAccording to the scholastic traditional view, sovereign authority\nrested on a pact between the king and its people, and in the absence\nof the king, sovereignty returned to the people. On this traditional\nview, the sovereign authority of the king was limited by natural,\ndivine, and teleological (i.e., common good) considerations. The\ntransition to the modern conception of unlimited and indivisible\npopular sovereignty marked a radical break in the political thinking\nin the Spanish colonies. Similarly new and revolutionary was the\nrelated conception of individual representation in a constituent\nassembly, as opposed to the traditional corporate representation\nbefore the king, to which the American subjects were never\nentitled. \nThe end result of this political process was the independence of all\nHispanic America (with the exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico) within\ntwo decades of the Napoleonic invasion through armed revolt. Brazil,\nby contrast, obtained independence in the same period but without\nbloodshed when the Portuguese prince-regent proclaimed it. This\ndifference in the sequence of political events accounts for the fact\nthat the liberal ideology in Hispanic America was deeply committed to\ncarrying out a radical break with the colonial past while a salient\nfeature of Brazilian liberalism is the continuity of monarchical rule.\nWhile liberals in Hispanic American uniformly rejected monarchism and\nembraced a republican form of government, Brazilian liberalism\nremained monarchical until the closing decades of the century. The\negalitarianism implicit in republicanism favored the abolition of\nslavery in the new republics. By mid-century slavery had been\nabolished in all of them. Brazilian liberals, by contrast, supported\nslavery, which was only abolished in 1888. \nAfter having embraced the doctrine of popular sovereignty and the\nnatural rights language of the French revolution, most liberals\nfollowed Benjamin Constant in his critique of the doctrine of popular\nsovereignty and his defense of a limited government. His writings in\nconstitutionalism were closely followed in the design of Latin\nAmerican constitutions, both liberal and conservative. Though French\nliberalism exerted the greatest influence overall, some Latin American\nliberals were also much influenced by British parliamentarism. Most of\nthem also admired the North American republican experience.\nMontesquieu and Jeremy Bentham were, along with Constant, among the\nmost cited European authors in the first half of the century (Safford\n1987: 68). From Montesquieu, liberals took the idea of separation of\npowers and his critique of despotism. Though they did not adopt an\nexplicitly utilitarian language, they admired and followed\nBentham’s rationalistic approach to legislation (Jaramillo 2001:\n120). In the mid-century, the political problem that came into focus\nand that gave liberals an identity against the conservative opposition\nwas the religious one. The question was how to deal with a powerful\nChurch that, in some regions, posed the most powerful internal\nchallenge to the authority of the newly established republics.\nLiberals demanded freedom of religious worship and, in some cases, the\nseparation of church and state. At this point in time, they had for\nthe most part distanced themselves from the natural rights discourse\nand from contractualism in light of the criticisms by the British\nutilitarians (especially Bentham) and the French doctrinaires\n(Constant, Pierre Royer-Collard, and François Guizot). They\nturned their attention to the German historical school of law\n(Friedrich Karl von Savigny and his French follower Eugène\nLerminier) and, above all, to Auguste Comte’s positivism, which\nbecame the most influential philosophical doctrine (Hale 1984) along\nwith Herbert Spencer’s evolutionism. After decades of civil\nunrest, a doctrine that emphasized the maintenance of order in\ncombination with progress appeared highly attractive. Liberalism had\nceased to be an ideology in combat against an enemy, either foreign\n(Spain) or internal (the conservative political faction), and had\nbecome the triumphant ideology of national building (Hale 1984). In\nthe closing decades of the century, positivism displaced liberalism in\nBrazil, while some Hispanic American liberals carried out a synthesis\nof liberal ideas and positivism that has often been considered the\ndecline of liberalism. \nIn the early twentieth century, Hispanic American liberalism became\nthe subject of strong criticisms. Critics argued that Hispanic\nAmerican societies had not been successfully transformed according to\nliberal ideas because the former provided a hostile ground for the\nlatter. On this view, liberalism was a foreign ideology that was not\nadequate for Hispanic American realities. This is a criticism against\nnineteenth century liberalism that has remained forceful to this date.\nBy mid-twentieth century liberalism had been displaced by the\nemergence of alternative political movements and ideologies:\nsocialist, Marxist, indigenous, agrarian, and populist. In the late\ntwentieth and early twenty-first centuries, liberalism has experienced\na modest revival in political discourse in Latin America. This is\nmanifest in the discourse that affirms the pluralism of forms of life\nand the demands for protection of the rights of minorities. In the\nsphere of academia, the works by English speaking liberal scholars,\nsuch as John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, and Joseph Raz, have received much\nattention and have been amply discussed in academic publications.\nHowever, Latin American scholars have so far not related their current\nendorsement of recent Anglo-American liberalism to the nineteenth\ncentury Latin American liberal discourse (a notable exception is\nGargarella 2010 & 2013). For the most part there is a sharp divide\nbetween current work by historians on nineteenth century Latin\nAmerican liberalism, on the one hand, and systematic reflection by\nphilosophers and political theorists on recent Anglo-American\nliberalism, on the other. \nIn response to the French invasion in 1808, Spanish liberalism\ndeveloped as an ideology of liberation against a foreign invader. This\nwas the first powerful liberal movement in the Spanish empire and the\nvery first serious questioning of absolute rule. In a society that had\nalmost no experience in political representation, liberals sought to\nend despotic rule by replacing it with a parliamentary monarchy. They\ndenied sovereign authority to the King and declared it to lie in the\nnation, which, in turn, was conceived of as having the faculty to make\nand remake its own fundamental laws. Traditionally, representation in\nthe Courts was corporate (nobility, clergy and the municipalities),\nwhile liberals stood for individualistic representation. Against\ndespotism, liberals also favored a division of powers and an\nindependent judiciary. Spanish liberalism was a revolutionary ideology\nthat marked a radical break with the monarchical status quo. Liberals\nsought to end a corporate society and to create an individualistic one\nby abolishing corporate privileges and immunities and by replacing\nthem with legal equality and economic freedom. The liberal position\nwas expressed in the 1812 Constitution. \nThe most important philosophical influence that shaped the liberal\nposition was the political ideas of the French Revolution and, more\nspecifically, the 1791 Constitution (Varela 1995). The 1812\nConstitution exhibited the influence of Enlightenment rationalism, the\nrationalist natural rights discourse, and the political ideas of\nMontesquieu and Rousseau, to name the most salient referred to authors\n(Varela 1987). The liberal deputies embraced the idea of individual\nrights that were natural and inalienable. They also affirmed the\nnatural equality of all men and the doctrine of national sovereignty.\nFollowing the French model, the Spanish constitution established a\ndivision of powers that privileged the legislative as the power that\nrepresented the nation. The constitution established a unicameral\nlegislature in which there were no special provisions for the\ntraditional preeminence of the clergy and the nobility. While the\nmonarch, as the executive, was subordinate to the legislative, the\njudiciary was held to be independent, echoing Locke and Montesquieu\n(Varela 1983). \nHowever, there are two crucial features that notably distinguish the\nCadiz constitution from the French model. The former, by contrast with\nthe latter, was grounded in an appeal to history and it exhibited the\nweight of Catholicism. As regards the first feature, the 1812\nConstitution presented itself in its preamble as in continuity with\nfundamental old Spanish legislation that had allegedly been subverted\nby despotism. According to the traditional view, the authority of the\nmonarch rested on a pact with its people from which pact followed the\nfundamental laws of the monarchy that the king had to observe. The\nliberal appeal to historical legitimacy was clearly at odds with the\ndoctrine of national sovereignty according to which sovereign\nauthority is unlimited—the ultimate source of authority. In\nfact, liberals introduced a conventional conception of political power\nthat subverted the traditional scholastic one according to which\npolitical power was natural and historical. Nevertheless, the\npresentation of the Constitution as in continuity with fundamental\nlegislation tempered the break with the past (Varela 1987). \nAs regards the second feature, the 1812 Constitution continued the\nimperial protection of the Catholic religion to the exclusion of all\nothers despite the fact that it also ended some privileges and\nimmunities that the Catholic Church had traditionally enjoyed. It has\nbeen argued, however, that religious intolerance was not a feature of\nSpanish liberalism, but a concession that liberals had to make to\ntraditionalist political forces in the Courts (Varela 1987).\nNevertheless, the religious language that pervades the constitutional\ntext reveals the influence of Spanish scholasticism according to which\nthere are exterior limits to sovereignty (natural, divine, historical,\nand teleological). This influence was even stronger in Spanish America\nsince the intellectual elite around the time of independence had been\neducated in Spanish scholasticism. Religious toleration was a matter\nof bitter disputes even among Latin American liberals themselves and\nthe religious language continued to be present in legal documents\nthroughout the nineteenth century. \nEarly Latin American liberalism must be seen through the influence of\nthe Spanish liberalism that developed in this political context,\nalthough the former’s two strands developed in different\ndirections. While the Hispanic American strand was firmly committed to\na radical break with the colonial past, the Brazilian one was marked\nby crucial points of continuity. Let us consider the Hispanic strand\nfirst. The mark of the Cadiz constitution was evident in most Hispanic\nAmerican constitutions in the first half of the century (Safford 1987:\n62). All of them claimed sovereign authority to lie in the people or\nthe nation and protected some basic individual rights (such as freedom\nof thought and of the press) that were considered natural. They all\nmaintained protection of the Catholic religion as the official one as\nwell as most of the corporate privileges of the Catholic Church. They\nalso established a separation of powers and departed from the Spanish\nmodel by creating bicameral systems. However, there are at least two\nimportant points of contrast between Spanish and Hispanic American\nliberals. The first one is that Hispanic American liberals could not\nbuttress their constitutionalism with appeals to historical\nlegitimacy. They could not present the constitutions that they\nproduced in continuity with the fundamental medieval laws of the\nSpanish monarchy. Independence from Spain pushed, after three\ncenturies of colonialism, to conceive of the liberal institutions as\nsomething completely new that lacked any historical precedent. By\ncontrast with Spanish liberals who looked both to the future and to\nthe past, the Hispanic American ones made a break with the past and\nlooked only to the future where emancipation and progress lied.\nLiberal constitutions held the promise of a society fully transformed\naway from the colonial structures and in accordance with the\nprotection of individual freedoms and legal equality. When Hispanic\nAmerican liberalism emerged as the ideology of a political group in\nthe mid-century, its identity was importantly centered in this forward\nlooking attitude. \nThe second point of contrast is that Hispanic American liberalism was\nmore radically egalitarian. Hispanic American liberals rejected a\nmonarchical option and very early abolished slavery and noble titles.\nBy mid-century slavery had been abolished in all independent\ncountries. Hispanic American liberalism became synonymous with\nrepublican government, which meant a commitment to legal equality,\nrepresentation, and the rejection of monarchism. After three centuries\nof despotic monarchical rule, Hispanic Americans associated monarchism\nwith despotism. They feared that one-person rule, even when limited\nby a parliament, would inevitably become despotic—as it in fact\nhappened in the short lived monarchy in Mexico right after\nindependence. This egalitarianism, however, did not translate into the\nestablishment of a rule of law that guaranteed equal legal treatment\nto all citizens. Nor did the egalitarian discourse translate into the\ndemocratic inclusion of all citizens in the exercise of political\nrights. Most Hispanic American liberals firmly believed in the need of\nproperty qualifications for voting and for running for public office.\nThey were consistently skeptical about extending political rights to a\npopulation that they regarded as incapable for republican\ncitizenship. \nWhile early Hispanic American liberalism defined itself by its\nrejection of the colonial heritage, Brazilian liberalism, by contrast,\nacquired its identity in the internal confrontation with the advocates\nof monarchical absolutism. Brazilian liberals did not challenge\nmonarchism. Instead, they sought to establish parliamentary limits to\nmonarchical authority (Cyril 2012), thus favoring a representative\nmonarchy. Though absolutists and liberals agreed on the need for a\nwritten constitution, the protection of some fundamental liberties\n(such as freedom of the press), and a legislative body that\nrepresented the nation, the differences between them turned on the\nextent and limits of the executive authority. Liberals sought to\nsubordinate the king to the legislative authority, while absolutists\npushed for the opposite balance of forces. Brazilian liberalism became\nstrongly identified with economic freedom, whereas absolutists favored\ngovernmental intervention in the economy along the lines of the late\neighteenth century reformist absolutism. While liberals wished to\nemulate North American federalism, absolutists were firmly committed\nto political centralism and, hence, to the political control of the\nentire nation by the monarch. Ironically, it was absolutists who\nsought to end slavery, whereas liberals were committed to its\nmaintenance during most of the century. \nThe liberal discourse inherited from the French Revolution via the\nCadiz constitution provided the language in which political actors\ndemanded emancipation from colonial rule in the early nineteenth\ncentury. This is why liberalism, though a diffuse ideology with no\nclear contours, commanded the assent of many of those in favor of\nindependence. The discourse of liberation appealed to the notion of\npopular sovereignty in order to justify emancipation from colonial\nrule (Palti 2007: ch. 2). Representation and legal equality were\nheartfelt demands in a region that had had no experience in political\nrepresentation while a colony, except for the brief interval during\nwhich the Cadiz constitution was in force from 1812 through 1814\n(Palti 2007: ch. 4). The natural rights to freedom of thought and of\nthe press were considered fundamental after centuries of tight\ncontrol by the Catholic inquisition, which had curtailed the free\ncirculation of ideas. A republican form of government with a division\nof powers was considered an antidote against one-person despotic rule\nand a clear sign of emancipation from monarchical absolutism. Some of\nthose who were later considered “conservatives”, such as\nLucas Alamán in México, or “republicans”,\nsuch as Simón Bolívar in Venezuela, shared in this early\nliberal consensus. Both of them affirmed, at least initially, the core\nideas of popular sovereignty, some natural rights, and a republican\nform of government with a division of powers. Conservative\nconstitutions, such as the Chilean one from 1833, affirmed these core\nideas as well. Liberal ideas thus provided a shared perspective in\nrelation to which the various political positions that were to develop\nlater defined themselves. \nThe philosophical sources of this early liberalism are quite diverse\nsince public intellectuals referred to all sorts of authorities that\ncould support their own positions. Though the list is long, the most\nwidely referred to authors were Rousseau, Montesquieu, Constant, and\nBentham (Safford 1987: 68). From Montesquieu they took the defense of\na division of powers and the critique of despotism; from Rousseau the\nidea of popular sovereignty, the social contract, and the natural\nequality of men; from Constant the critique of popular sovereignty and\nthe defense of a limited government; from Bentham the rationalistic\napproach to legislation. It should be noted, however, that the\ninfluence of these authorities was not limited to those who\nconsistently subscribed to liberal views. Such an influence also\nextended across a political spectrum that acquired more definite\ncontours in later decades. The echoes of Rousseau are apparent among\nthose who advocated an egalitarian strand of liberalism that demanded\nequal political rights for all males, as in the 1814 Apatzingán\nConstitution in México, which was never in force. This\nconstitution mentions the need for a virtuous citizenry, who, when in\ndisagreement with specific laws, must submit to them as a\n“sacrifice of particular intelligence to the general\nwill”. But Rousseau was also highly influential among those who\ndefended clearly authoritarian forms of governance, such as\nBolívar, who established a lifetime executive in the 1826\nBolivian Constitution. The same holds for Constant, who was an\nauthority for liberal intellectuals, such as José María\nLuis Mora in Mexico, but also for some of those who designed\n“conservative” constitutions, such as the Mexican\nconstitution of 1836. This indicates that intellectuals often drew\nfrom the same philosophical sources in order to develop political\npositions that were, in fact, quite different from each other. \nAt this early stage, Hispanic American partisans of liberal ideas\nusually did not call themselves “liberals”. Part of the\nreason for this is that in the early nineteenth century the political\nusage of the term was not yet well established in the region. The term\n“liberal” still carried with it its original moral meaning\nassociated with noble qualities of generosity and magnanimity, which,\nin the Hispanic-Portuguese Catholic tradition, were virtues that the\nmonarch had to have (Fernández Sebastián 2009:\n703–4). In this moral sense, “liberal” was opposed\nto tyranny and despotism. From the perspective afforded by this\nwidespread moral usage of the term, it became extremely difficult for\nHispanic Americans political actors to identify themselves as\n“liberals” along the lines of Spanish liberalism. Although\nthis may seem paradoxical, the reason is that the liberal Spanish\nCourts came to be seen as “illiberal” since they had\ngrudgingly granted representation rights to as few American deputies\nas possible. This led some Hispanic American liberals to claim\ndistance from Spanish liberalism despite the fact that the greatest\nimpulse for the spread of liberal ideas in Latin America was the Cadiz\nconstitution. According to their own self-perception, for instance,\nColombian liberals owed nothing to the latter. It was only in the\ntwentieth century that historians have demonstrated the inaccuracy of\nthis self-conception (Martínez 2006). \nThe moral meaning of the term “liberal” provided a\nperspective from which Hispanic American liberals construed their\nvision of the Spanish monarchy as a paradigm of tyranny and despotism.\nFrom the point of view of liberal ideas, more broadly, they came to\nsee the colonial past as an age of obscurantism, ignorance, and\nbackwardness (Lastarria 1844; Samper 1861; for discussion see Collier\n1967: ch. 5). This negative conception of the Spanish heritage became\na constant feature of the Hispanic American liberal frame of mind. In\nlight of their abhorrence of the colonial past, liberals insisted on\nthe need to construe completely new political institutions and to\ninstill a new political mentality in the population. They were also\nprone to blame the colonial heritage for the great difficulties that\nthey faced in carrying out these purposes. To be sure, this dismissive\nattitude towards the colonial past was not exclusive of liberals since\nit was Bolívar who famously blamed the ills of Hispanic America\non the colonial past. In his Jamaica Letter he claimed that,\nas a consequence of the colonial heritage, “institutions which\nare wholly representative are not suited to our character, customs,\nand present knowledge” (Bolívar 1815). As some\nconservatives often complained, the repudiation of the Spanish\nheritage prevented liberals from positively valuing aspects of their\nsociety that could help build stable political institutions, such as\nthe unifying force of Catholicism. \nIn light of this view of the character and customs inherited from the\ncolonial times, the liberal faith in the capacity of written\nconstitutions to fully transform their societies away from the\ncolonial structures and in the direction of progress went hand in hand\nwith strong pessimism about the capacity of the majority of the people to\nlive up to the demands of such institutions. Since the majority of the\npopulation shared the moral values of the colonial society and lacked\neven the basic skills of reading and writing, the elite judged them to\nbe backward and ignorant. Most liberals indeed deemed the majority of\nthe people to be unfit for republican citizenship. To be sure, the\nlatter was a widely shared view among European liberals who also\nadvocated a limited franchise. Most Hispanic American liberals\nendorsed the French doctrinaire’s argument that most of the\npopulation lacked the needed independence of judgment to exercise\npolitical rights either because of lack of instruction or because of\ntheir subservience to masters, or both, which was usually the case. A\nnotable exception to this dominant view was the short lived liberal\nColombian constitution of 1853 which granted universal male suffrage\nfollowing the French example after the 1848 revolution (Bushnell 1993:\n108). By contrast with their European counterparts, however, the\nHispanic American liberals’ conviction about the political\nincapacity of the masses was compounded by their belief that the\ncultural practices inherited from colonial times were a formidable\nobstacle for the realization of liberal political ideas. This\nperception motivated the disenchanted conclusion that liberal\ninstitutions were not suitable for Hispanic American societies, as\nBolívar put it, and as many other conservatives repeatedly\ncomplained against partisans of liberalism. \nIn the aftermath of independence, most Hispanic American nations\nproduced written constitutions as early as 1811 in Venezuela, New\nGranada (former Colombia), and Chile. At the time, political actors\nshared the belief that a written code of law had the power to\ntransform their societies in the direction of liberal ideas. They\nbelieved that good legislation was the way to promote individual\nliberties and economic progress. According to this, former subjects of\na colonial regime would come to see themselves as the bearers of\nindividual rights and liberties as soon as the latter were\nconstitutionally protected. Likewise, on this optimistic view,\neconomic progress would naturally develop as soon as individuals were\ngranted the economic freedoms to work, to contract, and to accumulate\nwealth. This initial constitutionalism did indeed bring great changes\nwith it: the constitutional protection of freedom of thought and of\nthe press ended the traditional limits on the free circulation of\nprinted materials and allowed for an explosion in the number of\nperiodical publications in which people for the first time openly\ndiscussed political issues. Nevertheless, the liberal legislation also\nfaced strong opposition by established social forces (such as the\nCatholic Church), the new republics were marked by great political\ninstability (regimes were often overthrown), and economic progress did\nnot materialize. By mid-century this initial constitutional optimism\nhad waned and political actors looked for alternative solutions. The\ntwo most salient liberal proposed alternatives were quite different\nfrom each other. According to the first one, it was necessary to\ntransform social practices first in order to prepare society for\nrepublican institutions. According to the second proposal, by\ncontrast, it was necessary to go beyond constitutionalism and to\nengage the State in the task of social and economic reform. While the\nformer alternative seeks to produce social transformation from below\n(in civil society), the latter deepens the strategy of producing\nsocial change from above (by the State). Juan Bautista Alberdi\nadvocated the first kind of strategy as suitable for the specific\nsituation of Argentina. In México, José María\nLuis Mora affirmed the second alternative (section 6). \nJuan Bautista Alberdi (1810–1884) was a public intellectual, a\nlegal theorist, and a diplomat. He laid the theoretical foundations\nfor the Argentinian constitution of 1853, which is the most long\nlasting liberal constitution of the period. His proposal for\nconstitutional reform in Bases and starting points for the\npolitical organization of the Argentine republic (Bases y\npuntos de partida para la organización política de la\nRepública Argentina, 1852) turns on two central ideas. The\nfirst one is that the South American republics should lower their\naspirations: instead of a “true” democratic republic, they\nshould aim for a “possible” one that would pave the way\ntowards the former. The second idea is that for a true democratic\nrepublic to have any chance of success, society must be ready for it.\nOn his view, the transformation of civil society must take place\nbefore granting political rights to the totality of the male adult\npopulation. Alberdi claimed that the much needed social transformation\ncould take place through the interaction of the local population with\nnorthern European immigrants who would bring with them the habits of\norder, discipline, and industry that were necessary for economic\nprogress and republican citizenship. Strongly influenced by the\neffects of massive immigration in California, Alberdi maintained that\nSouth America could become civilized through the transplantation of\nNorthern European culture in American soil. Thus, his proposed\nsolution was to promote massive immigration from northern Europe in a\nnation that was for the most part sparsely inhabited. Hence his famous\nclaim that “to govern is to populate”. \nAlberdi’s thinking was importantly influenced by the German\nhistorical school of law (Friedrich Karl von Savigny and his French\nfollower Eugène Lerminier) that repudiated both natural law and\nthe widely held idea that a society could be transformed on the basis\nof legislation that did not reflect its own state of civilization\n(Alberdi 1837). His distinction between a “possible” and a\n“true” republic is based on the idea that political\norganization must not be oriented by high and utopian ideals, but must\nbe grounded in historical reality. In his view, law has to be adequate\nto the society that receives it. Since he also held that an\nexamination of the situation of the South American republicans shows\nthat they are not civilized enough to govern themselves through\ndemocratic institutions, he maintained that a possible republic should\nnot grant equal political rights to all citizens. He favored a sort of\ngovernment that was republican in form, but highly authoritarian in\npractice. This, he thought, was apt in light of what he considered the\nhistorical reality of Hispanic America. He famously referred\napprovingly to Bolívar’s dictum that “The new\nstates of formerly Spanish America need kings with the name of\npresident” (Alberdi 1852: 415). In the end, he favored a\ncombination of federalism with political centralism: a certain degree\nof autonomy to the provinces combined with a strong executive, since,\non his view, both federalism and centralism had important historical\nroots in South America. \nAccording to Alberdi, the goals that should guide the political\norganization of a possible South American Republic must be responsive\nto the latter’s history and state of civilization, which\nestablish the limits of political possibility. In his view, the most\nimportant goal of a possible republic is to educate the population for\nrepresentative democracy. By “education” he meant the\nimprovement of the local population’s level of civilization up\nto the level required for a true republic. He advocated two main means\nof civilization: the promotion of commerce and industry, on the one\nhand, and massive European immigration, on the other. Alberdi opposed\nthe idea that the population could be made fit for democracy through\nformal schooling, as many other liberals indeed maintained. Domingo\nSarmiento, the other dominant intellectual and political figure in\nArgentina at the time, favored formal schooling as the main means of\ncivilization (Sarmiento 1849; Botana 1997). By contrast with\nSarmiento, however, Alberdi held that the best means of moralization\nwere industrious work and the constant interaction with people who\nalready had the habits of order, discipline, and industry. In passages\nthat evince the influence of Adam Smith, he maintained that social\nprosperity was not the work of governments, but a spontaneous result.\nHe was completely skeptical about the possibility of civilizing the\nlocal population without the interaction with people who were already\ncivilized. He summarily remarked that “whatever is not European\nin America is barbaric.” \nAlberdi’s diagnosis about the best means for preparing the\npopulation for a true republic guides his recommendations for\nlegislation. At the heart of his liberalism is his strong defense of\nfree trade and industry. Such a defense was grounded on both economic\nand moral considerations: he regarded freedom of trade and industry as\ninstrumental for material progress and for the improvement of the\nmorals of the local population. Crucially, freedom of trade and\nindustry was also indispensable in order to attract the desired sort\nof European immigrants. The protection of civil rights and liberties\nto everyone was part of his conception of a possible republic but also\ninstrumental for promoting immigration. In particular, he favored\nreligious toleration in order to attract non-Catholic Europeans. At\nthe same time, however, he maintained that Catholicism should remain\nthe official religion. On this point, he differed from most Hispanic\nAmerican liberals who not only advocated the end of the official\nrecognition of Catholicism but also, in some cases, a strict\nseparation between Church and state. Again, Alberdi’s views were\ngrounded on the realities of the Argentinian nation where the Catholic\nChurch was relatively weak and did not pose a political threat to the\nrepublic in the making as it was the case in Mexico or New\nGranada. \nWhat gave Latin American liberals and liberalism a clear identity\naround the mid-nineteenth century was their opposition to an\nadversary. In most of the region there emerged a\n“conservative” reaction against the dominant liberal tide.\nThough liberals and conservatives shared some political ground, they\nheld opposing views regarding the pace of social change and the place\nof Catholicism and of the Catholic Church in society. Liberals and\nconservatives agreed on the need for a written constitution, the\nconventional nature of political authority, individual representation,\nand the separation of powers, among other ideas. By contrast with\nliberals, however, conservatives favored a strong and centralized rule\nthat could maintain peace and political stability, opposed the full\nprotection of freedom of the press, and also favored the maintenance\nof some of the privileges traditionally enjoyed by the Catholic\nChurch. Liberals, on the other hand, advocated a more rapid pace of\nsocial change, the full protection of individual freedoms, which\nespecially included freedom of worship and of the press, the\ndismantling of the privileges traditionally enjoyed by the Catholic\nChurch, and most of the time, but not always, federalism. Though the\ndifference between liberals and conservatives was often not clear cut,\nthe only issue that consistently placed them at opposite sides was the\nreligious one (Bushnell 1996: 288–289). This opposition was more\nor less salient depending on the power that the local Catholic Church\nenjoyed in each national context. The liberal identity was\ncorrespondingly less clearly defined in those places where the\nreligious problem was less divisive, such as Chile or Argentina, where\nliberals rallied around the defense of individual liberties and some\ndegree of federalism against authoritarian and centralist rule (Jaksic\n& Serrano 2011, Halperín 1988). In New Granada, where the\nchurch had deeper roots, the liberal identity centered on a\ncombination of marked anti-clericalism with a defense of federalism\nagainst a conservative regime that was pro-clerical, authoritarian,\nand centralist. While the liberal forces of secularization had won out\nin most of the region by the end of the century, the confrontation\nbetween liberals and conservatives over the religious problem played\nout in Colombia until the end of the twentieth (Bushnell 1993). \nThe religious problem in Hispanic America was, in some regions,\nprimarily about religious toleration, where the liberal position\nregarding religion centered on the demand to allow for religious\nworship. This was the case in Argentina where the local Catholic\nChurch was relatively weak. In some other regions, such as Mexico or\nNew Granada, where the church was much stronger, the religious problem\nwas more complex insofar as the church was powerful enough to\ndestabilize the new republican governments and to challenge their\nlegitimacy. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Catholic\nChurch had condemned liberalism, secularism, freedom of thought and\ntoleration, among other “evils” in Pope Pius IX’s\nSyllabus of Errors published in 1864. Where it had the power\nto do so, the church sought to mobilize the moral religious\nsensibilities of the majority of the population against the attempted\nliberal reforms. The church opposed civil equality in order to protect\nits own legal privileges and immunities, rejected the freedoms of\nthought and of the press as threats to religious morality and clerical\nauthority, fought against economic reforms that endangered its\nposition as the largest landowner and wealthiest corporation, favored\na form of government that mirrored its own hierarchical structure\n(i.e., absolute monarchism), and sought to maintain official\nrecognition and support by the state. The challenge posed by the\nchurch to the new liberal republics combined claims to political and\neconomic power with the defense of morality and religion. In sum, the\nchurch opposed all aspects of liberal ideology in the name of the\nreligion of the vast majority. \nThough liberals and conservatives could agree on the need to protect\nfreedom of religious worship, as sometimes they did, they held\nopposing views regarding the sorts of institutional supports, if any,\nthat the State should provide the dominant Catholic Church. While\nliberals usually pushed for disestablishment, conservatives favored\nthe opposite. Liberals favored the abolition of the church’s\nprivileges and immunities in the name of legal equality, various\ndegrees of exclusion of the church from official schooling, the\nestablishment of a civil registry and civil matrimony, the possibility\nof divorce, and the secularization of hospitals and cemeteries. In the\nname of economic progress and freedom, liberals sometimes advocated\nthe confiscation of all of the church’s property not directly\nrelated to religious worship in order to make it available for in the\nmarket. In places where the conflict with the church was most profound\nliberals pushed for the complete separation between church and state\nas well as the “neutrality” of the state in religious\nmatters. The latter meant that the state should not explicitly favor\nor disfavor religion as such. This liberal position, though clearly\nanti-clerical, did not necessarily entail hostility to religion.\nThough some liberals undoubtedly held anti-Catholic sentiments, the\nattack against the church was political insofar as it aimed to place\nthe latter under the authority of the state. Conservatives, in turn,\ndefended the privileges traditionally enjoyed by the church, which\nincluded establishment and the church’s alleged duty to spread\nreligious morality through official schooling. They also opposed the\nconfiscation of the church’s property. Though some conservatives\nfavored the church from authentic conviction (such as Miguel Antonio\nCaro in New Granada, the most prominent conservative intellectual\nthere), many of them did so from instrumental considerations.\nConservatives did not wish to antagonize what could be a useful ally\nin the maintenance of order. This pragmatic view was Diego\nPortales’, the architect of Chilean political stability (Collier\n2003), and also Lucas Alamán’s, who famously referred to\nCatholicism as “the only link that binds all Mexicans when all\nothers have been broken” (Safford 1987: 100). In the long run,\nthose regimes that contemporized with the church indeed proved to be\nmore stable than the liberal ones that antagonized it.  \nThe place where the confrontation between liberals and conservatives\nover the religious problem was most violent was Mexico, where the\ncolonial church had been the most powerful. The first confrontation\nwith the church took place in 1833, but the decisive blow to the\nchurch came with the “Reform Laws” in 1855–1863,\nwhich, among other measures, nationalized most of its property and\nestablished a separation between church and State. The political\nchallenge that the church posed to the liberal regimes pushed some\nMexican liberals to move beyond their constitutionalism and to\nadvocate the need for social and economic reform. This was the case of\nJosé María Luis Mora (1794–1850), the most\nprominent Mexican liberal and whose liberal identity came to be\ncentered on his anti-clericalism. He was a historian, politician,\nlegislator, and a priest. His liberalism was strongly influenced by\nhis admiration of the 1812 Cadiz constitution, the writings of\nMontesquieu and Constant, and by the course of political events that\nled him to assume anticlerical views. Mora began his career as a\nliberal intellectual as a partisan of constitutionalism. A constant\ntheme in his writings is the defense of the “absolute”\nliberty of opinion and the criticism of any limits to freedom of the\npress. He argued that it is impossible to limit the freedom to think\nand to have opinions since men cannot divest themselves from their\nopinions through external force. Thus, he claimed, it is neither just\nnor convenient to prevent them from expressing their thoughts. The\ncrucial point for public order, in his view, is that men observe the\nlaw regardless of the opinions that they may hold. He maintained that\nno principle of justice can ground the prohibition of doctrines\nconsidered false since men are fallible and the best or only means for\narriving at knowledge of the truth is to subject doctrines to\nexamination in a free discussion. The amendment of wrong opinions\ncannot be attained through prohibition but through the free\ncirculation of ideas (Mora 1837: 491–5). Following Montesquieu,\nMora placed great emphasis on the security of the person and affirmed\nthe conception of civil freedom as the faculty of doing everything\nthat the law does not expressly prohibit (Mora 1837: 504–6). \nAs an admirer of the Cadiz constitution, Mora espoused the idea of\npopular sovereignty but, following Constant, claimed that the latter\nwas not unlimited. In his engagement with Rousseau, Constant had\naffirmed the notion of the general will as the source of legitimate\npolitical authority, but had denied the unlimited authority of society\nover the individual. According to Constant, individual rights are the\nlimits that the political authority must not trespass. Mora warned\nthat any unlimited authority was essentially tyrannical and, following\nMontesquieu, characterized despotism as the lawless, absolute, and\nunlimited use of political power regardless of the hands in which it\nfalls and the particular form of government that it takes (Mora 1837:\n475). According to Mora, individual rights and liberties limit the\nexercise of political power lest it become despotic. As was\nconventional wisdom in nineteenth century French liberalism, Mora\nargued for a franchise limited to proprietors who, in his view, were\nthe only members of society capable of exerting an independent\njudgment, of displaying true civic virtues, and of caring for the\npublic good (Mora 1837: 633–4). At the same time, however, he\nstrove for the improvement of “the moral condition of popular\nclasses” through various forms of education. However, Mora\ndeparted from the conventional wisdom of nineteenth century French\nliberalism in various ways. First, he rejected monarchism, continued\nto regard individual rights as natural, and subscribed to the doctrine\nof the social contract. He held that men’s purpose in\nestablishing society is the preservation of their “liberty,\nsecurity, equality and properties” (Mora 1837: 475). Second,\nMora explicitly rejected Constant’s defense of a\n“conservative power”, which was one of the latter’s\nmost popular conceptions in Hispanic America, though not among\nliberals (Mora 1837: 681). Constant had conceived of the\nconstitutional monarch as neutral power that could moderate conflicts\namong the executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches. \nThe third way in which Mora departed from French liberalism was his\nanticlericalism, which was motivated by local political events.\nDespite his admiration for the 1812 Cadiz constitution, Mora\ncriticized the fact that it did not abolish the special privileges\nenjoyed by the military and the church. With respect to the latter in\nparticular, Mora reacted against the church’s opposition to the\nestablishment of republican values and came to regard it as a power\ncapable of destabilizing the republic, to subvert its laws, and to\nturn the mass of the population against it (Mora 1837: 66). He\nregarded the church as having a esprit des corps that was\nopposed to both the national spirit and the representative system\ninsofar as the church sought to maintain special privileges and\nimmunities that were contrary to civil equality. He emphasized the\nchurch’s refusal to submit to civil and criminal law, its\nopposition to freedom of worship as well as to freedom of thought and\nof the press. In his view, the church opposed these freedoms because\ntheir exercise threatened the former’s rule over consciences. In\nthe same vein, Mora regarded the church as an obstacle to public\neducation insofar as education was instrumental to the masses’\nemancipation from priestly power (Mora 1837: 63). He also considered\nthe church as an obstacle to colonization of scarcely populated\nterritories in virtue of its opposition to freedom of worship. He even\ncriticized the clergy’s celibacy, which, on his view, isolates\nits members from society insofar as family ties are the “primary\nlink that binds men to society” (Mora 1837: 61). Mora advocated\nthe confiscation of the church’s property on the grounds that\nthe clergy was not a productive class and lacked an inclination to\nindustrious work. In Mexico, the church was indeed the wealthiest\nfinancial agent and the largest single proprietor in the nineteenth\ncentury until most of its property was nationalized in 1859. \nDespite his multifaceted condemnation of the church, Mora’s\nanticlericalism did not entail hostility to religion. He held that the\nchurch should be free to devote itself to its spiritual mission since\n“religious beliefs and principles of conscience are man’s\nmost sacred property considered as an individual” (Mora 1837:\n74). His concern was to argue for the separation between the religious\nand the political “principles.” He maintained that the\nchurch should have no share in the exercise of political power, nor\nshould it have any power to coerce citizens either in the form of\nforced economic contributions or punishments that are not solely\nspiritual. He warned that the religious principle degenerates when it\nis not kept separate from the political one. By contrast with the\nArgentinian Alberdi, who did not have to deal with a comparatively\npowerful Catholic Church, Mora advocated a strong reformist state\ncapable of curbing the opposition to liberal values by established\nsocial powers. According to Mora, a reformist state had to create the\nconditions for citizen’s freedom and equality. This was a\nposition that was contrary to Alberdi’s commitment to classical\nliberalism. \nIn the closing decades of the nineteenth century, there took place a\nfusion of liberalism with positivism in some parts of Latin America.\n“Positivism” was the name for a scientific approach to the\nsolution of social and political problems that was based on experience\nand observation. As developed by Auguste Comte in his Course of\nPositive Philosophy, positivism claimed that it was possible to\nuncover the laws of social phenomena and to organize society according\nto them. Comte’s thesis that it was possible to combine liberty\nwith order and progress exerted great influence in Latin America along\nwith Herbert Spencer’s evolutionism. While some liberals, such\nas Victorino Lastarria in Chile, sought to reconcile individual\nfreedom with positivist philosophy, some others, such as Justo Sierra\nin México, frankly subordinated individual liberty to the\nmaintenance of social order. Comtean philosophy was most influential\nin the field of higher education, where social reformers introduced\nnew curricula that privileged the study of the empirical sciences.\nSuch innovations were intended for the education of the elites.\nEducators believed, following Comte, that the key to bringing about\nthe end of social disorder was mental order: education was\ninstrumental to ending mental anarchy by emancipating individuals from\nprejudice and introducing them to “a common reservoir of\ntruths” (Zea 1968: 125). At the same time, Hispanic American\neducators inspired by Comte shunned his religion of humanity. The\nlatter had the greatest impact in Brazil, where positivism displaced\nliberalism. \nJosé Victorino Lastarria (1817–1888) was the most\nprominent Chilean liberal in the nineteenth century. He was a public\nintellectual, a central literary figure, and a politician. In addition\nto Comte’s writings, his thinking was importantly influenced by\nJohn Stuart Mill’s rendering of positivist philosophy in his\nAuguste Comte and Positivism, and by Émile\nLittré, who popularized Comte’s positivism.\nLastarria’s most important theoretical work is Lessons in\nPositivist Politics (Lecciones de política\npositiva) published in 1875. The influence of positivism is\nmanifest in this work. By contrast with Comte, however, Lastarria was\na thorough individualist who extolled the perfection of the individual\nand the value of individual liberty. He refused to subordinate\nindividual liberty to social order and maintained throughout his\npolitical writings that society should protect the full exercise of\nindividual liberty. The central idea that Lastarria took from Comte is\nthe thesis that modern societies need to be guided by experience and\nscientific observation. According to this, politics must be an\nexperimental science based on experience and observation, which are\nthe only solid basis for social organization. Following Comte,\nLastarria maintained that it is possible to comprehend society’s\nprogressive movement by uncovering the laws that govern social\nphenomena. On his view, in order to examine a particular form of\nsocial organization, it is necessary first to determine the laws that\ngovern humanity’s progress. The most fundamental law that\nLastarria identifies and that, according to him, impulses humanity\nforward, is “moral liberty”: the tendency to augment and\ndevelop all of our faculties (Lecciones, 3rd\nLesson). Social progress, on his view, is a product of this\ndevelopment. This is a perfectionist conception of the human person\naccording to which perfection is not only an individual end but also\nthe most important social end. \nLastarria conceived of his own epoch as one of painful transition\ntowards the triumph of liberty. Following Comte, he subscribed to the\nview that society progresses through three stages: theological,\nmetaphysical, and positive. At the theological stage, society is\nsubject to the authority of spiritual dogmas and is governed by force.\nAccording to him, this is the most vicious state because it is\ncontrary to man’s moral nature and stops social development. He\nassociates the metaphysical stage with the French spirit and\ncriticizes it for its anarchy and confusion. In particular, Lastarria\ncriticizes the revolutionary conception of liberty as popular\nsovereignty which he regards as an absolute power incompatible with\nthe rights of man, properly understood. The attack against the old\ntheological order and the anarchy in the ideas characterize the epoch\nof transition towards a third, positive, stage. He identifies the\nlatter as “liberal” insofar as it is founded on human\nliberty, which, on his view, is ideally exercised in what he calls\n“semecracia” (self-government). By the latter he not only\nmeans individual self-government but also government of the people by\nthe people, which he saw realized in the North American republic that\nhe greatly admired. \nLastarria maintained that liberty consists in the exercise of various\nrights: the right to make decisions about one’s own person\n(personal liberty), the right to exercise one’s own intelligence\nand to examine received beliefs, the right to work and to acquire\nproperty, the right to associate with others, and the right to demand\nequality before the law (Lecciones, 5th Lesson).\nHe was particularly concerned with freedom of religious worship. He\nheld religion to be a fundamental idea in society but also an intimate\nand private one. Following the example of North America, he advocated\nthe separation of church and State both in order to maintain the\nindependence of the church in the carrying out of its spiritual\nmission and the neutrality of the State with respect to religious\ndogma. As many other Hispanic American liberals, Lastarria established\na connection between freedom of thought and freedom of teaching: on\nhis view, just as the State should abstain from favoring any religious\ndoctrine in particular, the State should also refrain from imposing\nany political doctrine through official schooling. Though this view\npushes towards the disappearance of official schooling, he granted\nthat the State had a duty to finance basic schooling but should leave\nall other instruction in private hands. \nLastarria’s individualism was an exception among those Hispanic\nAmerican liberals who subscribed to positivist philosophy. The latter\ncame to see society as an organism, of which the individual is a part,\nsubject to fixed laws that determine its development. In their defense\nof a scientific approach to social problems that was based on\nobservation and experience, they claimed that law had to be adjusted\nto social reality, not the other way around. They thus rejected the\n“utopias” of earlier liberals and came to regard the\n“old” defense of natural rights and popular sovereignty as\nmetaphysical abstractions that were out of touch with reality. In the\nextreme, positivist liberals sided with the defense of authoritarian\ngovernments in the name of order and progress. In México,\npositivist philosophy became the official creed of the governing\nelite, the so called “scientists”, who did not repudiate\ntheir liberal credentials. Their positivist version of liberalism,\nwhich they called “conservative” liberalism, served as the\nideological framework for the justification of dictatorial rule\n(Aguilar 2011). \nAfter having been the triumphant ideology of nation building in most\nof Latin America in the late nineteenth century, liberalism entered a\nphase of decline in the early twentieth. In fact, liberalism’s\ndemise began with the positivist subordination of constitutional\nrights and liberties to the maintenance of social order. The\npositivist critique of what came to be called\n“doctrinaire” (constitutional) liberalism constituted a\nfrontal attack against the latter’s classical version, which\nemphasized the protection of individual liberties. At the turn of the\ncentury, this critique was sometimes combined with a growing\nskepticism regarding the aptness of liberal ideas and values for\nHispanic American societies. In Mexico, this skepticism emerged from\nwithin the liberal establishment insofar as the late nineteenth\ncentury liberal regime had been dictatorial and failed to protect\nconstitutional rights and liberties (Rabasa 1912). On this view,\nliberalism had subverted itself because it lacked the adequate social\nconditions to flourish. In Venezuela, by contrast, the idea that\nliberalism is not adequate for Hispanic American societies refers back\nto Bolívar’s early skepticism mentioned earlier (section\n3). Laureano Vallenilla, a Venezuelan positivist sociologist, famously\nargued that authoritarian forms of governance are more suitable for\nHispanic American societies (Vallenilla 1919). The idea that liberal\nreformers failed because liberal ideas were “imported” and\nnot adequate for Latin American societies has not ceased to occupy\ninterpreters ever since (Jaksic and Posada 2011a). A notable exception\nto this dominant view is the reconstruction, by an official ideologue,\nof Mexican liberalism as the official and triumphant ideology of the\npolitical regimes emanated from the 1910 revolution (Reyes Heroles\n1957). Though professional historians are divided among those who\nclaim that Latin American societies were indeed hostile ground for\nliberalism (Hale 1984) and those who more sympathetically present\nLatin American liberalism as a political movement that was responsive\nto local problems (Bushnell 1996), there is a growing tendency to\nabandon the “failure” view of liberalism and to focus on\nthe reconstruction of what nineteenth century liberals aimed and\naccomplished, as a recent collection of essays shows (Jaksic and\nPosada 2011b). Whatever one may think about the “failure”\nview, however, it is certainly true that liberalism receded throughout\nLatin America in the first half of the twentieth century. An important\nreason for this is that alternative ideologies became prominent. Early\nin the century, positivism was condemned as utilitarian and\nmaterialist from the perspective of a new idealist mentality that\ndeveloped among intellectual elites. By mid-century, socialist,\nMarxist, indigenous, agrarian, and populist political movements and\nideologies had become dominant and displaced liberalism. \nThe late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have seen a modest\nrevival of a liberal political discourse that is partly due to the\ndecline of socialist and Marxist political movements and ideologies.\nTwo salient instances of this revival in political discourse are the\nrecognition of the pluralism of forms of life and the demands for\nprotection of the rights of minorities. In the sphere of academia,\nmany scholars have enthusiastically welcomed the influence of\nAnglo-American contemporary liberalism. The works by John Rawls,\nRonald Dworkin, Joseph Raz, and many others have received much\nattention and have been amply discussed in academic publications. It\nis interesting to notice, however, that there is a sharp separation\nbetween the reconstruction of nineteenth century Latin American\nliberalism, which continues to be the province of historians, on the\none hand, and systematic reflection on liberal ideas and values by\nprofessional philosophers and political theorists, on the other.\nLittle effort has been made to relate current work on liberal ideas\nand values inspired by Anglo-American authors to the nineteenth\ncentury Latin American tradition (a notable exception is Gargarella\n2010 & 2013).","contact.mail":"faviolarivera@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
