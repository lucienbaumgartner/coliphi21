It thus concerns private\nobligations that arise in respect of symmetrical relations among\nnatural and artificial persons rather than public obligations that\narise in respect of hierarchical relations between persons and the\nstate. Contract, at least in its orthodox expression, is distinctive\nfor concerning chosen, or voluntary, obligations—that is,\nobligations constituted by the intentions of the contracting\nparties. This entry describes doctrinal and theoretical accounts of\ncontract law with a special emphasis on the relationship between\ncontract law and two near-neighbors—tort law and fiduciary\nlaw.\n\nSection 1 briefly outlines the doctrinal structure of orthodox\ncontract law, with an emphasis on contract’s character as chosen\nobligation. At the same time, contract law concerns obligations that\nmight also be associated with adjacent bodies of doctrine that\nelaborate un-chosen obligations—in particular tort law and\nfiduciary law—and the norms—concerning due care and\nloyalty—that underlie these involuntary obligations.  Section 2\ndescribes encroachments by these bodies of law into contract and the\ndoctrinal, economic, and moral ideas that each employs.  Section 3\nasks whether contract might remain doctrinally and theoretically\nseparate from tort and fiduciary law and retain its distinctive\ncharacter as chosen, private obligation.\n\nThe idea that contract establishes chosen obligation highlights the\naffinity between contract obligation in law and promissory obligation\nin morals. And contracts indeed do characteristically arise through an\nexchange of promises. This is inscribed in legal doctrine, in the\nprinciples that contracts are created through offer, acceptance, and\nconsideration. An offer, according to the U.S. second\nRestatement on Contracts, is the manifestation of willingness to enter into\na bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that\nhis assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it. (R2\nContracts: \n §24)[1] To establish a contract,\nan offer must be met with an appropriate acceptance,\ncharacteristically a manifestation of assent to\nthe terms [of the offer] made by the offeree in a manner invited or\nrequired by the offer. (§50) These\nrequirements entail that all orthodox contracts contain promises.  But\nnot all promises establish contracts, among other reasons because the\nlaw further requires that contracts be supported by good\nconsideration. The consideration doctrine, in its modern\nform, adds a bargain requirement to contract formation. The\nRestatement says that [t]o constitute\nconsideration, a performance or a return promise must be bargained for  and adds that [a] performance\nor return promise is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in\nexchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for\nthat promise. (R2 Contracts: §71) Contracts,\nthat is, must arise not out of a simple, gratuitous promise, but\nrather out of an exchange of promises, in which each promise\nconstitutes, in Oliver Wendell Holmes’s words, “reciprocal\nconventional inducement” for the other (Holmes 1881:\n293–94). Contract obligation so constituted possesses several fundamental\nfeatures that distinguish it from adjacent forms of private obligation\nrecognized by law, including in particular tort obligation on the one\nhand and fiduciary obligation on the other. Indeed, the formal\nstructure of contract may be understood by establishing contrasts\nbetween contract obligation and these near-neighbors. Most\nimportantly, contract is distinct from both tort and fiduciary law in\nthat contract involves essentially chosen obligations. A\ncontractual obligation, that is, does not just come into being in\nconnection with a choice but is, rather, itself chosen—directly\nintended into existence. The lawyer Samuel Williston—who wrote a\nleading treatise and served as Reporter for the Restatement (First) of\nContracts—once observed that he “[didn’t] see why a\nman should not be able to make himself liable if he wishes to do\nso” (Handbook NCCUSL 1925: 194). And orthodox contract law\nlargely reflects this approach to contractual\nobligation. Philosophers, moreover, have produced several elaborations\nof the will theory of contracts that the orthodox approach\ninvites.[2] Orthodox contract is, in this respect, distinct from tort: a tort\nobligation might arise in connection with a choice—as\nthe obligation not to be drunk arises in connection with the choice to\noperate a car; a contract obligation, by contrast, is itself\nimmediately chosen—at the core of every offer and every\nacceptance lies, as the Restatement says, an intention to establish an\nobligation by communicating this intention. The distinction between contract and tort may be understood in\ngreater detail by reading it off the face of legal doctrine. To begin with, in contradistinction to the classical obligations of\ntort law—including both obligations concerning intentional torts\nand negligence—contract obligation is not fault-based but rather\nstrict liability. A contractual promisor might take all reasonable\n(that is, non-negligent or cost-justified in the sense associated with\ntort law) care to avoid making contracts that she cannot keep and\nmight make every reasonable (cost-justified) effort to keep whatever\ncontracts she has made. Yet she remains liable to her promisee when\nshe makes and breaches a contract.  Furthermore, and again in contradistinction to tort obligation,\ncontract obligation is forward-rather than backward-looking; contract\nconcerns realizing promised gains rather than restoring a status\nquo ante disturbed by a wrong. A contractual promisor must not\njust avoid harming her promisee on account of his reliance on the\npromise, she must affirmatively vindicate her promisee’s\nexpectations of performance. Contract remedies further reflect the\nforward-looking character of contract obligations. These remedies do\nnot just make promisees who have been disappointed by breach whole,\nrestoring them to the positions that they would have occupied had\ncontractual promises never been made. Rather, the law requires\npromisors to put their promisees in positions as good as they would\nhave occupied had the promisors performed. Typically, contract law\nachieves this end by awarding money damages that insure the\npromisees’ valuations of performance (under what the law calls\nthe expectation remedy) (R2 Contracts: §344\ncmt. a).[3] Orthodox contract’s chosen character also distinguishes it\nfrom fiduciary duties. Fiduciary obligations need not be\nchosen—think of the duties that parents owe children or that a\ncourt-appointed lawyer owes her client. And even where fiduciary\nrelations arise in connection with and perhaps through choices, the\nobligations themselves do not arise at the pleasure of the choices of\nthe parties who owe them. The substantive duties that fiduciary\nrelations involve, that is, are not cabined by the original intentions\nof the parties but instead reflect mandatory duties of fiduciary\nloyalty. Fiduciary duties may thus grow and change organically, ex\npost, with the relations themselves, as loyalty’s demands\nadjust to a beneficiary’s new vulnerabilities. By contrast,\ncontract law limits contractual obligations according to the\nparties’ ex ante intentions and never requires a party\nto shoulder a new burden, not assumed up front, simply because\nchanging circumstances make this best overall. Even long-term,\nrelational contracts take their content from the parties’\n(shifting and developing) intentions rather than from legally mandated\nprinciples of fairness, loyalty, or other-regard. This general distinction is once again inscribed in greater detail\nin the doctrinal particulars of contract law. Most notably, whereas the core fiduciary duty demands that\nfiduciaries display loyalty in favor of their\n beneficiaries,[4]\n the core duty of\ncontract law requires only that promisors perform their contracts in\ngood faith (see, e.g., R2 Contracts: §205 cmt. a;\nU.C.C. §1-304).  Fiduciary loyalty necessarily involves a measure\nof affirmative, open-ended other regard.  Contractual good faith, by\ncontrast, expressly announces no substantive obligation additional to\nthe terms of a contractual promise but instead articulates respect for\nthe terms of this promise. In particular, good faith forbids the\nexercise of discretion during performance designed to recapture a\nbenefit allocated to a counterparty at formation (Burton 1980:\n373). Good faith thus does not so much introduce altruism into the\ncontract relation as preclude contract obligation itself from\nexacerbating inequality in bargaining power, thus becoming a tool of\nexploitative advantage-taking. Whereas a fiduciary who promises to\nwalk a mile with her beneficiary must, if new circumstances require,\nwalk with him twain, a contractual promisor must walk only the precise\nmile, and along the precise path, that she promised. Apart from\nrecognizing the side-constraint of good faith, a contractual promisor\nmay remain as self-interested within her contract as she was without\nit.  This difference has practical consequences. A promisor who breaches\na contract (for example, a seller who delivers her goods not to her\ninitial buyer but to a third party who offers a higher price) may thus\nretain the ex post gains from this so-called “efficient\nbreach”. This rule permits even an intentionally breaching\npromisor to vindicate only her promisee’s value of performance\nrather than, say, disgorging her own (greater) gains from breach. A\ncontractual promisor who contemplates breach may thus consult\nexclusively her own self-interest in respect of the gains that breach\ncreates. She retains the right to manage the performance on her own\naccount, as it were, rather than as her promisee’s\ntrustee. Similarly, a promisee confronted with breach must take all\nreasonable steps to protect her contractual expectations herself or\nrisk being denied her full expectation remedy, under the doctrine that\nrequires victims of breach to mitigate their damages. This doctrine\nreflects the fact that contracting parties will include a duty of\nreasonable mitigation in their agreements ex ante, in order\nto maximize the expected contractual surplus available for them to\nshare. Contracts thus include implied agreements that promisors may\nrequire their promisees to reduce the losses associated with even\nself-interested breaches. Fiduciary loyalty would forbid this. Contract thus falls in between tort and fiduciary obligation.\nContracts create a special relationship between the parties to them,\nconstituted by strict liability, forward-looking obligations that\nreach beyond the tort obligations of reasonable care that persons owe\neven to strangers. But at the same time, the special relationship that\ncontract establishes retains an extremely thin character. The parties\nto contracts remain at arm’s length and assume no duties of\nloyalty or open-ended other regard for one another. Instead,\ncontracting parties acquire only a duty of good faith respect for the\ncontractual settlements that their agreements elaborate. As Charles\nFried observed (in developing an account of contract law based on the\nlaw’s promissory roots and thus on the idea that contract\nobligation is “essentially self-imposed”) (1981: 2),\ncontractual trust does not establish intimacy but rather serves\n“humdrum ends: We make appointments, buy and sell” (1981:\n8). Even though contract asserts its distinctiveness from both tort and\nfiduciary law, each adjacent body of obligation has, at some point in\nthe past half-century, emerged as a competitor to contract.  Contract,\nthat is, might be recast as a special case of tort or fiduciary\nobligation. This should perhaps come as no surprise. A legal form that\nestablishes special obligations of a sort that do not arise among\nstrangers but equally rejects the affirmative and open-ended\nobligations that arise among intimates deprives itself of the most\nnatural arguments in its favor. And this has rendered the grounds of\ncontract uncertain, and contract itself vulnerable to encroachments\nfrom tort or fiduciary law.  Suggestions that contract might be recast as tort or fiduciary law\ninvariably proceed along two often-parallel lines: one concerns legal\ndoctrine; and the other legal theory. Studying these suggestions\nyields insight into the strengths and weaknesses of accounts that\nunderstand contract, in the classical manner, as a free-standing form\nof chosen obligation. Ever since contract emerged from tort in the common law, both\ndoctrinal and theoretical forces have sought to restore contractual\nobligation to its tort-based origins. In each case, tort’s\nencroachment emphasizes the role that reliance plays in contractual\nobligation. A contractual promise typically engenders reliance by its\npromisee. Indeed, the reliance is among the points behind the\npromise. By relying on the performance even before it is provided, the\npromisee increases its value to him: a buyer of cement, for example,\nincreases its value by investing in gravel to mix with the cement and\nskilled workers to build with it. This increase in the\nperformance’s value, moreover, increases the amount that the\npromisee will pay for the promise up front.  Reliance and investment\nthus increase a contract’s value to both promisee and\npromisor. The prospect of reliance suggests re-constituting contract on the\nmodel of tort. The explicit misrepresentation torts are narrowly\ncabined, to be sure. Fraud, for example, requires scienter\n(see R2 Torts: §526); and liability for merely negligent\nmisrepresentation does not generally arise in connection with\nstatements of \nintention.[5]\n But perhaps the body of doctrine nominally\ncalled “contract” in fact expands liability for\nmisrepresentation from outside tort law’s official boundaries\nbut nevertheless by deploying tort’s basic structures and\nprinciples. Perhaps “contract” is just the name that the\nlaw gives to the sub-class of tort obligations arising in respect of\none person’s reliance on another’s representations\nconcerning her future conduct or current intentions in respect of this\nconduct. Understanding contract doctrine in this way requires taking\nsome interpretive license, but perhaps not so much as to require\nrejecting tort law’s basic colonizing claim. To begin with, the distance between contractual strict liability\nfor promises on the one hand and, on the other, tort-like duties of\nreasonable care in respect of representations concerning future\nconduct should not be overstated. Modern contract law employs a\nso-called “objective” standard to evaluate offer and\nacceptance. (Recall that the Restatement’s definition of offer\nrefers not to the offeror’s actual state of mind but rather to\nmanifestations that “justify another person in\nunderstanding” that assent is invited.) This standard plausibly\ntransforms contract from chosen obligation—which arises at the\npleasure of the promisor’s actual intentions—into\nobligation that arises involuntarily based on the intentions others\nreasonably believe the promisor to have. And even the requirement of\nprivity—that contractual obligation arises only directly among\nthe parties to a promise and not towards third parties who rely on\npromises—has been relaxed. It would go too far to say that this\nchange makes a contractual promisor liable to all third parties whose\nreliance on her promises she has reason to foresee, but the retreat\nfrom privity opens up the possibility that such an approach no longer\nqualitatively misunderstands the positive law. Furthermore, not just contract formation but the content of\ncontractual obligation once established might also be recharacterized\nalong the lines of tort law’s harm-based\napproach. Contract’s forward-looking obligations—to\nvindicate contractual expectations rather than just rectify\nreliance-based losses—are less distinctive than they might\nappear. It has been familiar at least since Lon Fuller and William\nPerdue pointed it out that where markets are thick, so that a\npromisee’s reliance on her promisor includes forsaking an\neffectively identically attractive offer from another promisor, then\nthe promisee’s reliance interest equals her valuation of\nperformance—her contractual expectation (Fuller & Perdue\n1936).  In addition, any number of legal doctrines—imposing\nrequirements of foreseeability (see, e.g., Hadley v.\nBaxendale 1854), for example, or respecting the proof of lost\nexpectations (see, e.g., R2 Contracts §351;\nU.C.C. §2-723)—cabin the expectation interest and remedy\nwhere markets are not thick. And there even exist cases in which\ncourts have refused to vindicate contractual expectations that could\nnot be recast as reliance losses in respect of forgone opportunities,\nincluding by reading a reliance requirement into the conditions for\nestablishing certain contractual commitments (see, e.g.,\nOverstreet v.  Norden Laboratories 1982). Finally, contract law’s black letter has—at least since\nthe Restatement (First) of Contracts and more expansively still in the\nRestatement (Second)—included the doctrine that [a] promise which the promisor should reasonably\nexpect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or\na third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is\nbinding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the\npromise. (R2 Contracts: §90) This\nprinciple—called Promissory Estoppel—was\ninitially narrowly construed by courts, so that it effectively applied\nonly where all the essential elements of properly promissory (and\nhence orthodox contract) obligation obtained, but a technical failure,\ntypically of consideration, nevertheless prevented a contract from\narising in the ordinary \n fashion.[6]\n However, in the middle 1960s, some courts\nbegan to expand reliance-based obligation for promissory estoppel to\narise in the absence of any completed promise, and based\ninstead on manipulative (but not fraudulent or otherwise\nconventionally tortious) representations made during pre-contractual\nnegotiations (The leading case remains Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores,\nInc. 1965). This class of obligations—possessing a\ncontractual character but arising out of reliance on pre-promissory\nrepresentations and thus apart from any fully-formed\npromise—imposed contracts entirely apart from consent. If\northodox contract is distinctive on account of being voluntary or\nchosen private obligation, then obligation arising under §90 so\ninterpreted displaces or colonizes contract, effectively in favor of\ntort. Thoughts such as these led Grant Gilmore to call promissory\nestoppel “anti-contract” (Gilmore 1974: 61) and worry that\nit opened up a class of reliance-based, essentially tort-like\nobligation that would one-day swallow contract whole. These doctrinal developments were matched by several substantial\ntheoretical innovations that sought to recharacterize contract as\nreliance-based and thus in effect a special case of tort. Genealogical thinkers as different as Patrick Atiyah and Margaret\nJane Radin wondered why the law should be especially solicitous of\ncoordination through private exchange or of the promise-based\ncontractual obligation through which market economies manage such\nexchange (see, e.g., Atiyah 1979 and Radin 1987).  Atiyah thus\nproposed that the best reconstruction of contract law, in its full\nhistorical development, de-emphasizes chosen obligation and the\npromissory form in favor of the thought that contract law coordinates\nconduct, and rationalizes socially productive reliance on promises,\nbased not on individual private wills but rather on shared public\nnorms—in Atiyah’s words, on “the social and legal\nmorality of a group of persons” (1981: 121).  As if on queue,\nthe rise of the unconscionability doctrine (U.C.C. §2-302)\ngenerated an apprehension, including in Gilmore (1974) and Fried\n(1981), that lawmakers were codifying the relevant public norms and\nlegal morality, at least for consumer contracts and possibly\nbeyond. Economic approaches to contract law similarly de-emphasized\ncontract’s promissory roots and have had (at least in the United\nStates) a much greater impact on both law and legal theory.  The economic analysis of contract law begins, in effect, from\nHume’s observation that experience has\ntaught us, that human affairs wou’d be conducted much more for\nmutual advantage, were there certain symbols or signs instituted, by\nwhich we might give each other security of our conduct in any\nparticular incident.  (Hume 1739 [1978]: bk. 3, pt. II, sec. v [Of the\nObligation of Promises], p. 522; emphasis removed )  Contract law, as one prominent economic theorist\nput it, thus allows individuals to bind themselves\nto a future course of conduct, to make it easier for others to arrange\ntheir lives in reliance on [a] promise.  (Craswell 1989: 496; see\ngenerally Goetz & Scott 1980) In this way,\nlaw enables persons to coordinate their conduct to their mutual\nbenefit. Contract law, so understood, becomes a legal technology for\nproducing efficient coordination. And contracts should be enforced\njust insofar as doing so (by increasing confidence in the promises\nthat they contain) establishes optimal incentives for reliance and\nthus maximizes the joint surplus produced through contractual\ncoordination (see, e.g., Schwartz & Scott 2003: 541). This approach entails that nothing in the intrinsic character of\ncontract law favors promise-based or chosen obligation; instead,\neverything depends on contingent facts (contingent on the states of\nlegal, managerial, and economic technologies of production) about what\nlegal forms coordinate reliance in the most efficient way. Many lawyer\neconomists (just what share varies with the times) believe that\nplacing promise at the center of contract fits this bill. But others\nargue that the law should be more solicitous of\nreliance—especially reliance on pre-contractual\nrepresentations—than orthodox contract doctrine allows (see,\ne.g., Bebchuk & Ben-Shahar 2001: 427; Ben-Schachar 2004; Craswell\n1996; Johnston 1999; Katz 1996).  Some lawyer-economists have even\nproposed rejecting outright orthodox contract law’s\nintentionalist insistence on assent as a pre-requisite for obligation,\nin favor of a regime in which bargaining gives rise to a converging\nseries of bilateral options, in which each bargaining party may be\nheld to its representations although no agreement has been reached\n(Ben-Schachar 2004: 1830–35). In addition, and independently,\nthe economic focus on sustaining optimal reliance rejects orthodox\ncontract law’s categorical preference for remedies that, by\nvindicating a promisee’s forward-looking promissory\nexpectations, possess a distinctively promissory form. It may be that\nsuch remedies happen to support optimal reliance, although it may of\ncourse not;[7]\nbut in either event, the agreement-based idea of securing the\npromissee’s benefit of her bargain “will not have played\nany role in the analysis leading up to [the] conclusion” what\nremedy is optimal (Craswell 2000: 107).  In all these ways, the economic approach to contract law rejects\nthe idea that contract and tort are categorically distinct. One\nprominent paper expounding a general economic theory of contract makes\nthis plain in its title, proposing a general theory of contract law\nbased on the tort-like principle of mitigation, or loss-prevention\n(Goetz & Scott 1983). This feature of economic approaches to\ncontract is natural. It reflects the economic analysis of law’s\nmore general disregard for doctrinal categories: law and economics,\none commentator has observed, simply “does not take the\ndoctrinal invocations and restatements as legal data to be\nexplained”, but instead focuses its attention on explaining case\noutcomes (Kraus 2002: 692). More explicitly philosophical accounts have also sought to\nre-characterize contract law as a special case of the broader class of\nharm-based obligations more familiarly associated with tort. Broken agreements impose burdens on disappointed promisees: the\nburdens take the form of costs (including opportunity costs) incurred\nin reliance on a promised performance that never occurs and\ndisappointments associated with expectations raised by a promise but\nnever vindicated. If these costs might be classed as harms, then [i]f there is a general principle that one ought\nnot cause harm to others, that might be enough to justify some sort of\nrule against [agreement-breaking]. (Craswell 1989: 499)  Thoughts much like this led Adam Smith to suggest\nthat contract is founded on the reasonable\nexpectation produced by a promise … [which is] a declaration of\nyour desire that the person for whom you promise should depend on you\nfor the performance of it. (Smith c.1764 [1985]: 263)\n U.S. American lawyers have been familiar with the thought that\ncontract might be best understood as a special case of tort at least\nsince Lon Fuller and William Perdue suggested that reliance-based\ncontractual obligations are easier to justify than expectation-based\nobligations (Fuller & Perdue 1936: 53–57). The basic impulse\nbehind Fuller and Perdue’s view retains its attraction\ntoday. The leading contemporary exponent of this harm-based and thus\ntort-like theory of contractual obligation is T.M. Scanlon, who argues\nfirst that promises should be understood in terms of the morality of\nharm and second that contracts should be understood to import the\nmoral principles governing promising into law (Scanlon 1998:\n295–327, 2001: 93–94).  Scanlon’s view grounds\npromisees’ faith in promissory assurances in pre-promissory\nmoral principles that forbid certain forms of manipulating others and,\nmoreover, require that persons exercise due care in leading others to\nform certain \nexpectations.[8]\n Scanlon hopes, in this way, to explain the\nwrongfulness of making lying or careless promises through these\npre-promissory values and then to defend a broader principle of\npromissory\n fidelity[9]\n by reference to the fact that promisees may\nreasonably trust promisors to avoid these narrower wrongs (Scanlon\n1998: 308–09). Scanlon recognizes that a harm-based theory of promise and contract\nmust account for the ways in which these norms depart from the\ntort-like norms that generally govern the morality and law of\nharm:[10]\nincluding that promise and contract obligate promisors to perform\ntheir promises—to satisfy their promisees’\nexpectations—rather than merely to compensate disappointed\npromisees for lost reliance or merely to warn of non-performance in\norder to minimize such reliance\n losses;[11]\n and, that contract\nlaw enforces the promisor’s obligation to vindicate her\npromisee’s expectation and not merely reimburse his lost\nreliance.[12]\nScanlon defends each of these rules of agreement-keeping by comparing\nthe benefits that the rules confer to the burdens that they impose and\narguing that, given the balance between these, it would be\nunreasonable for promisors who must bear the burdens to reject the\nrules, and that promisees may justifiably claim the benefits of the\nrules, as the formal structure of the harm theory \n requires.[13]\n With respect to\nthe rule that promisors are obligated to satisfy promisees’\nexpectations and not merely warn them of non-performance or compensate\ntheir lost reliance, Scanlon argues that the benefits to promisees of\nprotecting promissory expectations are\n substantial[14]\n and that, given\nthe conditions of mutual knowledge, etc., that are built into the\ngeneral account of promising, the burdens that this rule imposes on\npromisors are\n slight.[15]\n Given this balance, Scanlon concludes,\npromisees have reason to insist on having their expectations protected\nand promisors cannot reasonably reject this rule of promise-keeping\n(Scanlon 1998: 304–05).  And similarly, with respect to the\nlegal enforcement of promisees’ expectations, Scanlon argues\nthat the benefits of legal enforcement are\n substantial,[16]\n while the costs of\nenforceability are much less \n weighty.[17]\n Scanlon therefore\nconcludes, once again, that in light of this balance no person could\nreasonably reject a legal regime that enforces contractual\nexpectations (Scanlon 2001). Legal doctrine (both in its current state and through its\ngenealogical reconstruction), economic theory, and moral theory might\nthus all be deployed against the view that contract represents a\ndistinctive legal form. These arguments all propose that rather than\nconstituting directly chosen obligation, contract merely reflects the\napplication of broader, involuntarily imposed duties not to harm to\nthe special case of harms imposed through representations of current\nintentions or future conduct. Efforts to assimilate contract to fiduciary obligation have a more\nrecent vintage or at least vogue. Nevertheless, they have been\ngathering steam. Here also, the argument against contract’s distinctiveness\nhas a doctrinal component, with remedies playing an especially\nprominent role in the recent legal developments.  Recall that orthodox contract law’s preference for the\nexpectation remedy, and the associated practice of efficient breach,\npermits a breaching promisor to retain for herself ex post\ngains produced by her breach. The contractual duty of good faith in\nperformance requires the promisor to respect the contractual\nsettlement, but vindicating the promisee’s expectation interest\nfully satisfies the required respect. Beyond this, the promisor may\nremain as self-interested within the contract as she was without it:\nonce again, she may decide whether to perform or breach by consulting\nonly her own account.  Courts and other legal actors have begun, especially in\njurisdictions in the Commonwealth tradition but also (although more\ncautiously) in the United States, to require more of breaching\npromisors. Courts in England and in Israel are becoming increasingly\nsympathetic to “gain based damages” for breach of\ncontract, which give disappointed promisees not just their contractual\nexpectations but also, and additionally, a share of the ex\npost gains promisors have acquired through breach (see generally\nAdras Bldg. Material Ltd. v. Harlow & Jones, GmbH 1988;\nCunnington 2008). And some U.S. American courts have similarly begun,\nat least where they perceive breaching promisors as grasping, not just\nto vindicate promisees’ expectations but also to require\npromisors to disgorge any gains that their refusals to perform\ncreate.[18]\nThe Uniform Commercial Code has similarly liberalized the right to\nspecific performance (U.C.C. §2-716). And the recently adopted\nRestatement of Restitution gives courts discretion to replace the\nexpectation remedy with disgorgement for breaches that are material,\ndeliberate, and profitable, on the generic ground that expectation\ndamages are “inadequate” (see R3 Restitution; see also\nKull 2001: 2023–24.). The expectation remedy, by definition, provides the promisee with\nthe same value as performance would have done—no less, but also\nno more. The supracompensatory remedies just described are therefore\njustified only insofar as a promisor owes her promisee not just good\nfaith in respect of the contractual settlement, but also an obligation\nto administer contractual performance in the interests of the\npromisee, with respect to any further gains that become possible. This\nobligation amounts to a requirement that promisors display greater\nbenevolence for their promisees in respect of unallocated gains within\nthe contract than they were required to display in negotiations\nconcerning these gains without the contract. The metes and bounds of\nthe required benevolence must, moreover, remain open-ended, because\nthe requirement is not limited to respecting the surplus allocation\nfixed in the initial contract.  The move to gain-based damages thus\nadopts a fiduciary logic: it recasts contract to abandon the\narm’s length perspective from which the contract was made in\nfavor of an open-ended obligation of loyalty in favor of the\npromisee. It should therefore come as no surprise that cases imposing\nsupracompensatory remedies sometimes adopt the idea of a constructive\ntrust—in which the promisor is taken to administer the\ncontractual performance on her promisee’s behalf—to\nexplain their holdings (see, e.g., Gassner v.  Lockett\n1958). As occurred in connection with tort, so fiduciary law’s\nencroachment on contract has attracted theoretical attention. The\nattention has come from both economically and philosophically minded\ncommentators. Scholars writing in a principally economic vein have thus observed\nthat the efficiency of the expectation remedy—and in particular\nthe optimal incentives associated with efficient breach—might be\nreplicated by properly administered supracompensatory remedies also\n(Brooks 2006). The expectation remedy creates efficient incentives to\nperform or breach—incentives that produce performance when and\nonly when the promisee remains the highest valuer of performance when\nperformance comes due—by placing the decision whether to perform\nor breach unilaterally in the hand of the promisor (thereby avoiding\nthe transactions costs of renegotiation) while at the same time\nforcing a breaching promisor to internalize the full costs of breach,\nincluding the promisee’s valuation of performance (thereby\ninducing the promisor to strike the optimal balance among these\ncosts). This result is not unique, however, and a properly constructed\nrestitutionary remedy—which permits the promisee to choose\nbetween specific performance of the promise and breach plus\ndisgorgement by the promissor of the gains breach\nachieves—possesses the same efficiency. Once again, the decision\nwhether to perform or breach falls unilaterally to a single party,\nthis time the promisee who may insist on performance; and the\nunilateral decider once again internalizes the full costs of any\nperformance he insists on, now understood as the lost opportunity to\nreceive restitution of the gains that breach might have achieved.  A\ntheory of “efficient performance” thus perfectly mirrors,\nand perfectly replicates, orthodox contract law’s theory of\nefficient breach. This has led lawyer-economists to suggest that\neconomic analysis ends at an impasse—neither orthodox contract\nnor fiduciary revisionism is more efficient than the other. Some legal\nscholars would break the economic impasse on moral grounds, favoring\n“more robust notions of contractual duty” over the feeble\nnotion of duty that (the theory of efficient breach reveals) orthodox\naccounts of contract law invite (Brooks 2006: 753). Certain moral theorists have, for some time and with increasing\nforce, adopted a parallel line of attack against orthodox contract\nlaw. Orthodox contract remedies merely price breach; and they set\nprices so low (at levels that enable breaching promisors to profit\nfrom their wrongs) as to encourage breaches of the very obligations\nthat contract law purports to establish. This feature of the orthodox\ndoctrine, these critics say, undermines the immanent normativity of\ncontract obligation and causes contract law to diverge from the\nmorality of promise in unattractive ways (various of these claims\nappear in, for example, Friedman 1989; Shiffrin 2009, 2007; Brooks\n2006) Moral critics of orthodox contract also, and relatedly, attack\nother features of established law, for example the mitigation\ndoctrine. This doctrine supports the expectation remedy by requiring\npromisees to respond to breach by taking steps to minimize their\ncontractual disappointments. Critics of orthodox contract law charge\nthat the doctrine authorizes breaching promisors to draft their\npromisees involuntarily into their service, specifically by requiring\npromisees to exercise initiative in order to reduce the damages that\nbreaching promisors owe (Shiffrin 2012). Supracompensatory remedies,\nmoral critics of orthodox contract say, avoid these wrongs. A legal\nregime that responded to breach of contract by ordering specific\nperformance, restitutionary disgorgement, or even punitive damages\nwould truly sanction rather than merely pricing breach. Such a regime\nwould thus support the internal norms of contract obligation and bring\nthe law of contract into conformity with the morality of promise.\nOnce again, the doctrines that achieve these ends insert fiduciary\nnorms into contract law.  Accordingly—and as happened in connection with\ntort—legal doctrine, economic theory, and moral thought are once\nagain deployed against the view that contract represents a distinctive\nlegal form. These arguments again propose that rather than\nconstituting distinctively chosen obligation, on terms fully fixed by\nthe contracting parties’ ex ante intentions, contract\nshould reflect the application of broader and not purely voluntary\nduties to the special case of agreements. The new assault on contract\ndiffers from the old in that it proceeds from contract’s\nopposite flank and invokes not the involuntary duties to avoid harm\nthat tort law establishes among strangers but rather the involuntary\nduties of affirmative other-regard that fiduciary law imposes among\nintimates.  Both challenges—from tort and from fiduciary\nlaw—reject contract’s formal distinctiveness by rejecting\ncontract’s character as chosen obligation. The challenge from\ntort casts contract as just a special case of the involuntary duty not\nto harm others, triggered by promissory representations concerning\npresent intentions or future conduct. The challenge from fiduciary law\ncasts contract as inextricably intertwined with mandatory duties of\nloyalty and other-regard, triggered by the relations of trust that\npromises establish. To answer these challenges, orthodox accounts of contract must\nvindicate—both in doctrine and in theory—the distinctive\nand unmediated role of intentions in creating and fixing contractual\nobligations. Contract can remain distinct from tort only insofar as\nintentions specifically to obligate play a central role in contractual\nobligations. And contract can remain distinct from fiduciary law only\ninsofar as contractual obligations cannot develop organically,\noutstripping the intentions though which contracts are created, but\ninstead remain always cabined by the ex ante intentions\nthrough which contracting parties establish their contracts.  Orthodox theories of contract contend that doctrine provides legal\nraw materials that might establish a structural distinction between\ncontract and tort, and that legal theory can give this distinction an\nelaboration that emphasizes contractual obligation’s\nfundamentally and immediately chosen character. Offer and acceptance each specifically require an intention to\nestablish an obligation through this very intention. The Restatement\nthus emphasizes that an offer manifests an intention (the Restatement\ncalls this a “willingness”) to assume an obligation (in\nthe words of the Restatement, a “bargain”) (R2 Contracts:\n§24).  To be sure, modern contract law does not require that\ncontracting parties in fact posses such intentions to obligate in\ntheir own particular minds but only that they act and speak in ways\nthat would make a reasonable interlocutor conclude that they possess\nintentions to obligate. But this so-called “objective”\napproach to intention in contract formation does not necessarily\nremove intentions to obligate from the picture or transform contract\ninto a species of tort. In particular, contract law\ncontinues—even in the face of the objective approach—to\ntreat threshold questions concerning intentions to obligate\nqualitatively differently from the way it treats questions concerning\nthe substantive content of intended performance, once the threshold of\nchosen obligation is crossed. Specifically, the law refuses to impute\nto potential traders a general intent to make efficient, or fair, or\notherwise optimal contracts and then to imply contracts based on that\nintent. Even so called “objective” theories of offer and\nacceptance thus do not ask directly whether a reasonable person would\nhave contracted but instead filter their reasonableness inquiry\nthrough the question whether the parties would understand each other\nas expressing the specific intent to be bound. In contrast, once a\ncontract is established by specific intent, the law is willing,\nthrough any number of doctrines concerning both interpretation and\ngap-filling, to impute to the parties a general intent that their\ncontracts contain optimal terms. Orthodox theories argue that this\ncontrast—and the law’s separate emphasis on the threshold\nintent to be bound—institutes a structural distinction between\ncontract and tort. Moreover, orthodox accounts of contract law observe that, contrary\nto Gilmore’s fears, inclusion of promissory estoppel in contract\nlaw (through §90 of the Restatement) has not in the end caused\nthe law to abandon contract’s intentionalist structure. The\ncases that invoke promissory estoppel to establish contract liability\nin the absence of any fully articulate promise (for purely\nnon-promissory representations made during pre-contractual\nnegotiations) turn out to have generated more fear than followers, and\na systematic review of cases governed by these principles shows that\nabsent conventional torts, non-promissory representations do not\ncreate liability for reliance incurred during negotiations (see\nSchwartz & Scott 2007: 672). As one court has put it, in order for\npre-contractual understandings to receive legal recognition, more is\nneeded than convergence on the details of a plan—there\nmust be “overall agreement … to enter into the\nbinding contract” (Teachers Ins. & Annuity\nAssoc. v. Tribune Co. 1987; emphasis added).  Promise, understood\nas immediately chosen obligation, thus re-enters the doctrinal\npicture.  Unconscionability—at least as a doctrine that recasts\ncontract in terms of fairness-based rather than chosen\nobligations—has had a similarly truncated career. A few early\ncases toyed with suggestions that substantively unfair terms might in\nthemselves and without more render a contract unconscionable.[19] But (with certain\nvery narrowly cabined \n exceptions[20]) the law has settled on the view that unconscionability has an ineliminable procedural component, which requires a plaintiff to demonstrate not just that a contract’s terms are substantively unfair but also that she failed to exercise meaningful choice in accepting\n them.[21] Unconscionability thus also protects rather than supplants the chosen-ness of contract obligation. Indeed, orthodox theories observe, tort law proper retains basic\nprinciples that demur to encroach directly or generally on\ncontract. Most notably, Restatement (Second) of Torts §548,\nconcerning fraudulent misrepresentation, insists that tort liability\nfor misrepresentation requires that the party asserting liability has\nrelied specifically on the truth of the representation upon\nwhich the claimed liability is based. The Restatement expressly adds\nthat reliance “upon the expectation that the maker [of the false\nstatement] will be held liable in damages for its falsity”\ncannot sustain a fraud claim (R2 Torts: §548).  By contrast, the\nbootstrapping that tort law refuses is of the essence of contract and\nunderwritten by the fact that contractual promisors, in contrast to\nthose who make representations for purposes of tort law, intend not\njust to convey information but rather, directly though the self-same\nintentions, to assume obligations. Contract, orthodox theories insist,\ncountenances bootstrapping precisely because it contemplates chosen\nobligations. Finally, orthodox theories observe that concrete cases embrace the\ndistinctive features that they accord to contract (admittedly not\nuniformly, see, e.g., Overstreet v.  Norden Laboratories\n1982, but sufficiently often and in sufficiently important cases to\nrender plausible contract’s claim to constitute a separate legal\nform).  Warranties, for example, may create obligations even though\nthey warrant facts that could not possibly obtain. As Judge Learned\nHand once explained, because a promisor “obviously cannot\ncontrol what is already in the past”, a warranty is intended precisely to relieve the promisee of\nany duty to ascertain the fact for himself; it amounts to a promise to\nindemnify the promisee for any loss if the fact warranted proves\nuntrue. (Metropolitan Coal Co. v.  Howard 1946)  Another court similarly observed that the\n“crucial question” raised by a contractual promise (such\nas a warranty) thus “is not whether the buyer believed in the\ntruth of the warranted information but whether it believed it was\npurchasing the seller’s promise as to its truth” (CBS,\nInc. v. Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. 1990: 1001). The court,\nmoreover, expressly explained its reasoning by observing that its\napproach reflected “the prevailing perception of an action for\nbreach of express warranty as one that is no longer grounded in tort,\nbut essentially in contract” (CBS, Inc. v. Ziff-Davis\nPublishing Co. 1990: 1001). Nor is this approach—which\nrecognizes that contracts establish obligations unsupported by\nreliance or associated tort norms—limited to the warranty\ncontext. In one prominent case, a court enforced a promise that\ncreated an 8 billion dollar windfall—and hence cannot have\ninduced any reliance, not even in the form of lost\nopportunities—to the promise’s full extent (see\nTexaco, Inc. v.  Pennzoil, Co. 1987). Such a verdict cannot\nreadily be assimilated to tort; it is most naturally explained and\njustified by the recognition of contract as a distinctive legal\nform. Orthodox accounts of contract marshal the doctrinal features of\ncontract law that resist assimilation to tort in a separate effort to\nemphasize that theoretical accounts of contract must accommodate\ncontract’s character as chosen obligation. Economic theories that emphasize contract’s usefulness as a\ntechnology for sustaining efficient reliance must confront the fact\nthat contract law protects promissory reliance even where this is not\nefficient and fails to protect non-promissory reliance even where this\nwould be efficient. On the one hand, philosophical theories of\npromising as various as Rawls’s and Raz’s emphasize that\npromissory obligation endures even where, as things have developed,\nkeeping a promise would not be best overall (Rawls 1955; Raz 1977).\nCharles Fried (1981) makes the same point concerning contract.  On the\nother hand, the economic approach, as James Gordley has observed,\nmakes it “puzzling, to put it mildly, that the law enforces\npromises more readily than other commitments” (1991: 235; a\nsimilar point is made in Atiyah 1981).  These and related difficulties\nhave led many (although not all) lawyer-economists to abandon the\neffort to explain orthodox contract law in terms of efficient\nreliance in favor of an alternative campaign to reform the\nlaw to suit economic theory. The piecemeal reforms described in the earlier section on efforts\nto reframe contract in terms of tort belong to this program. The\nprogram also shows a more general and systematic face, especially in\ncommercial law, in the form of an effort to reconstruct contract\ndoctrine with the single-minded purpose of  \nfacilitating the ability of firms to maximize welfare [which in this\ncontext means joint contractual surplus] when making commercial\ncontracts. (Schwartz & Scott 2003: 556)  \nBecause firms are artificial persons, this program can ignore concerns\nfor respecting party autonomy that contract law must otherwise\naddress. And insofar as firms (by assumption) are owned by perfectly\ndiversified shareholders, who thus possess equal interests in both\nsides of all commercial transactions, the program can ignore both\ndistributive and corrective justice. But these observations, even as\nthey shore up the economic case for reforming contract law, also\nreveal the deep and pervasive radicalism of the economic reform\nprogram. Orthodox approaches to contract thus insist that this program\nabandons the most basic presupposition from which the study of\ncontract law as the law of agreements ordinarily departs. Whereas\ncontracts, intuitively understood, involve coordination among multiple\nparties, the transactions addressed by the economic theory ultimately\ninvolve only the one perfectly diversified shareholder; and they are,\ntherefore, not in the end agreements at all. Orthodox accounts of contract thus respond to economically\nmotivated encroachments on the role of choice in contract by raising\nthe stakes. They observe that the movement of thought begun by the\neconomic observation that contract promotes efficient reliance does\nnot end merely by assimilating contract to the misrepresentation\ntorts. Instead, it ends by rejecting the broader conception of private\nlaw as regulating the interactions among distinctive and independent\npersons that conventional understandings of both contract and tort\nembrace.[22] Finally, orthodox contract’s insistence that contract is\nchosen obligation also underwrites theoretical resistance to moral\nviews, such as Scanlon’s, that seek to explain contractual\nobligation in terms of the involuntarily imposed obligation not to\nharm others. These theories find it difficult to account for both the\nstrictness of contractual obligations to keep agreements and\nalso contract law’s commitment to vindicating promissory\nexpectations. Begin by considering contract’s strict-liability character.\nNot every lost reliance or disappointed expectation constitutes a harm\nthat tort-like duties require avoiding. Indeed, even in ordinary cases\nin which reliance and expectations are foreseeable and in fact\nforeseen, no harm-based obligations need arise, as Charles Fried\nvividly observed in connection with defending his preferred\nvoluntarist account of contract. Imagine, Fried supposed, that a\nmusician convenes a string quartet in his apartment and that this\ncauses a music lover to buy the unit next door. Surely, Fried claimed,\neven if the musician knows of the reliance, she is under no obligation\nto continue to convene the quartet or to reject a suggestion to play\nat the cellist’s house instead (see Fried 1981: 10–11; for\nfurther examples, see Raz 1977: 216–17).  Indeed, even reliance\nor expectations based on a promise need not ground obligation (in\neither promise or contract): where a third person other than the\npromise overhears an agreement between two others and relies on or\nforms expectations of its performance, this does not (without more)\ncreate promissory or contractual obligations in favor of the\nthird. (This example is presented by Raz 1977: 217 and taken up by\nCartwright 1984: 243.) Accounts that cast contract as chosen obligation (on the orthodox\nmodel) emphasize that these cases all illustrate that harm-based\nobligations can arise out of contractual promises only insofar as the\nreliance or expectations that might underwrite such obligations are\njustified. But contractual promises, taken alone, seem\ncapable of justifying contractual reliance or expectations only\ninsofar as they obligate. Accounts that seek to assimilate\ncontract to tort by casting contractual obligations as harm-based thus\nconfront a circle. As Randy Barnett observes: a\nperson, rather than being entitled to legal enforcement because\nreliance is justified, is justified in relying on those commitments\nthat will be legally enforced. Reliance theories [that is,\nharm-theories] therefore must appeal to a criterion other than\nreliance to distinguish justified acts of reliance. (Barnett 1986:\n276)[23]  Finally, harm-based theories of contract must do\nmore than just show that agreement-based reliance (or expectations)\ncan be justified when the surrounding circumstances are\nright. Contracts generate obligations of agreement-keeping quite\ngenerally, without any need for support from considerations (such as\nfriendship or some other form of solidarity) that come from outside\nthe morality of agreements.  Orthodox views thus insist that the harm-based theory of contract\nis in a difficult bind. On the one hand the theory cannot bootstrap\nits way into validity by grounding promissory assurances in the very\nobligation of agreement-keeping that it is charged to explain.  And on\nthe other, it must show that a contractual promise can, at least\nordinarily, by itself render relying on, or forming\nexpectations based on, the promise justified, quite apart from any\nbroader or richer attendant factors. Orthodox views propose that until\nit can escape this circle, the effort to assimilate contract to the\ntort-like morality of harm cannot get off the\n ground.[24] Moreover, orthodox accounts of contract observe that even if a\nharm-based theory can successfully explain strict liability for\npromise-keeping in a non-circular and yet non-reductive way, the\ntheory remains unable to explain why contracts create entitlements in\nrespect not just of reasonable reliance but also in respect of\npromissory expectations. Tort law, after all, remains\nbackward-looking: the obligations it contemplates (including\nobligations associated with representations concerning current\nintentions or future actions) are limited to preventing losses.  And\nthe remedies it recommends (for example, the damage awards\ncontemplated in the law of torts) are limited to the compensation\nnecessary to restore the status quo ante. Contract law by\ncontrast differs in each of these respects, and the harm-based view,\nas Scanlon recognizes, must explain why contract requires promisors to\nsatisfy their promisees’ expectations rather than merely to\ncompensate disappointed promisees for lost reliance and why contract\nremedies vindicate contractual expectations rather than merely\nreimbursing lost reliance. Scanlon defends each of these rules of agreement-keeping by\ncomparing the benefits that the rules confer to the burdens that they\nimpose and arguing that, given the balance between these, it would be\nunreasonable for promisors who must bear the burdens to reject the\nrules, and that promisees may justifiably claim the benefits of the\nrules, as the formal structure of the harm theory requires.  Scanlon\nargues that the benefits to promisees of protecting promissory\nexpectations are substantial (Scanlon 1998:\n 302–3)[25]\n and that, given\nthe conditions of mutual knowledge, etc., that are built into the\ngeneral account of promising, the burdens that this rule imposes on\npromisors are\n slight.[26]\n Given this balance, Scanlon also concludes,\nthe benefits of legal enforcement of contracts are\n substantial,[27]\n while the costs of enforceability are much\nless weighty.[28]\n Scanlon therefore concludes, once again,\nthat in light of this balance, no person could reasonably reject a\nlegal regime that enforces contractual expectations (Scanlon\n2001:108). Orthodox theories of contract reply that this conclusion comes too\nquickly to be earned. To succeed, Scanlon’s view must show not\nonly that contract cannot be reasonably rejected in favor of an\nalternative of no obligations of agreement-keeping, but also that\ncontract cannot be reasonably rejected in favor of any alternative\nrule of agreement keeping. This makes it natural to ask how the\nharm-theorist can sustain the conclusion that no alternative\nprinciples may reasonably be preferred over orthodox contract\nlaw’s scheme of chosen obligation. And earlier\narguments—especially those associated with the economic analysis\nof law—suggest that the harm-theorist cannot sustain the\nposition that orthodox contract law may be reasonably rejected in\nfavor of limiting contractual obligation according to tort law’s\nmorality of harm. At the very least, orthodox views of contract\nconclude, these considerations argue the harm-based effort to ground\ncontract not in choice but rather in the morality of harm to a\nstalemate. Orthodox theories of contract seek to defend the view that contract\nis quintessentially chosen obligation against encroachment from\nfiduciary law also. Once again both doctrinal and theoretical\nconsiderations figure in the defense. The most important doctrinal consideration against the fiduciary\nreconstruction of contract law develops a fundamental distinction between\nthe duty of good faith that governs contracts and the various duties\nof loyalty that arise within fiduciary relations (here see generally\nDaniel Markovits (2014a,b).  The duty of good faith in performance, which both the Uniform\nCommercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts make\nmandatory for every contract that they govern, requires parties to\ndisplay “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable\ncommercial standards of fair dealing” (U.C.C. §§1-201,\n2-103) and to avoid types of conduct that “violate community\nstandards of decency, fairness or reasonableness” (R2 Contracts:\n§205 cmt. [a]). Critically, however, the duty of good faith in\nperformance “does not create a separate duty of fairness and\nreasonableness which can be independently breached”\n(U.C.C. §1-304 [cmt. 1]). Thus, as one prominent judge has more\ncolorfully explained, “even after you have signed a contract,\nyou are not obliged to become an altruist toward the other\nparty” (Mkt. St. Assocs. Ltd. P’ship v. Frey\n1991: \n594).[29]\n Nor does good faith require contracting\nparties to adopt even an attitude of substantive impartiality between\ntheir contractual interests and the interests of their contracting\npartners. The law does not seek, “in the name of good faith, to\nmake every contract signatory his brother’s keeper”\n(Mkt. St. Assocs. 1991: 593.). Instead, Good faith\ncharacterizes contract obligation’s form and identifies an\nattitude towards contractual obligations: good faith supports the\nparties’ contractual settlement, working to “effectuate\nthe intentions of the parties, or to protect their reasonable\nexpectations” (Burton 1980:\n 371)[30].\n It is thus,\nfundamentally, an attitude of respect for the contract relation, and\nthe measure of good faith is the contract itself. The duty of good\nfaith in performance permits the parties to remain as self-interested\nwithin their contracts as they were without them, save that they must\nrespect the terms of their contractual settlements as side-constraints\non their self-interest and may not use the inevitable room to maneuver\nthat arises within every contract, and the strategic vulnerabilities\nthat a contract itself thus creates, “to recapture [during\nperformance] opportunities forgone upon contracting” (Burton\n1980: 373). Orthodox accounts of contract deploy these observations to argue\nthat good faith in contract law requires less of parties than\nfiduciary loyalty and devotion. A fiduciary is “required to\ntreat his principal as if the principal were he”\n(Mkt. St. Assocs. 1991: 593).  But good faith, by contrast, does not mean that a party vested with a clear\nright is obligated to exercise that right to its own detriment for the\npurpose of benefiting another party to the contract (Rio Algom\nCorp. v. Jimco Ltd. 1980).  As another prominent U.S. American court explains,\n \n“[G]ood faith does not envision loyalty to the contractual\ncounterparty, but rather faithfulness to the scope, purpose, and terms\nof the parties” contract. (ASB Allegiance Real Estate Fund\nv. Scion Breckenridge Managing Member, L.L.C. 2013[31])\n The distinction, orthodox accounts insist, marks a deep feature of\ncontract law. As Jack Beatson observes, [o]ne of the hallmarks of English common law is that it\ndoes not have a doctrine of abuse of rights: if one has a right to do\nan act then, one can, in general, do it for whatever reason one\nwishes. (Beatson 1995: 266) This entails that  [e]xcept where the contracting parties are also in a\nfiduciary relationship, self-interest is permissible, and indeed is\nthe norm in the exercise of contractual rights. (Beatson 1995:\n267) Once again, a fiduciary whose beneficiary asks\nher to walk a mile with him must, if circumstances develop to require\nit, walk with him twain; but a contractual promisor must walk only the\nmile, and only along the path, that she promised. As long as she\nrespects her promise, mere self-interest cannot be bad faith. These doctrinal distinctions, once again, may be given theoretical\nelaborations, in both economic and moral registers. Begin with economics, and recall that critics of orthodox contract\nwho seek to assimilate contract to fiduciary ideals propose that\ncontractual promisors should manage contractual performance not purely\non their own but rather also on their promisees’ accounts, in a\nkind of constructive trust for their promisees’ benefits.  That\nis the device that organizes and rationalizes the critics’\nvarious suggestions that breaching promisors should disgorge any gains\nproduced by their breaches to their promisees in restitution or pay\npunitive damages on account of the betrayals that their breaches\ninvolve.  Views that seek to maintain the distinction between contract and\nfiduciary obligation emphasize that this regime will not leave\npromisor behavior undisturbed. In particular, a promisor who faces\nrestitutionary claims for any gains produced by an efficient breach\nwill seek to recapture some of these gains for herself by refusing to\nrealize them—threatening, as it were, to perform—unless\nher promisee waives a portion of his restitutionary claim. And this\nentails that the restitutionary remedies preferred by those who\npropose to recast contract in fiduciary terms expose contracting\nparties to the risk of costly renegotiations, which destroy\ncontractual surplus and thus set back the interests of both promisors\nand promisees. That is why, recall, the efficient performance regime\ncan mirror orthodox contract’s expectation-remedy-plus-efficient\nbreach only by coupling restitutionary disgorgement with a power, in\nthe promisee, to command her promisor to “breach”\nand disgorge. That power is necessary if the parties are to avoid\nsurplus-destroying renegotiations. These observations cast light on the economic relationship between\npromisees and promisors under the fiduciary reconstruction of\ncontract’s full efficient performance regime. Promisees, under\nthis regime, possess a right to capture any gains that a promised\nperformance produces, no matter how deployed, and also a power to\ncommand their promisors to deploy the contractual performance in the\noptimal way. This seemingly complex relationship admits a much simpler\ncharacterization—a promisee who possesses the comprehensive\nentitlements and powers associated with the efficient performance\nregime in effect owns his promisor (at least in respect of\nthe contractual performance).  Orthodox theories of contract argue that this characterization\nreveals that the efficient performance regime possesses a\nfundamentally non-contractual character. As Ronald Coase famously\nproposed, the scope of the firm—the boundary between\ncoordinating economic activity within a firm through ownership and\nmanagerial control and coordinating economic activity across firms by\ncontract—is fixed by the balance between the transaction costs\nof each coordinating mechanism (Coase 1938).  Coase’s insight\napplies naturally to the efficient performance regime, to\nrecharacterize that regime in a fundamental way. Where the balance of\ntransactions costs really does make it efficient, as the efficient\nperformance remedy supposes, for promisees to exercise managerial\ncontrol over their promisors’ actions, those actions will\nalready fall within the promisees’ firms. There will thus be no\nneed for the contracts that the efficient performance remedy seeks to\nvindicate. These observations invite a simple restatement of the orthodox\naccount of contract: where the allocation of discretion and control\nassociated with the efficient performance remedy really is optimal,\nthere will be no separate legal entities to begin with and hence no\ncontracts. The legal norms associated with orthodox contract\nlaw—the expectation remedy, the practice of efficient breach,\nand more generally self-interest side-constrained by good faith\nrespect for the contractual settlement—may thus be cast as\nconstitutive of economic coordination by contract. Finally, orthodox accounts propose a moral interpretation of these\neconomic ideas, which they marshal in reply to orthodox contract\nlaw’s moralist critics. These critics, recall, object to the\nfact that orthodox contract (insofar as the expectation remedy\nencourages efficient breach, for example, or the mitigation doctrine\npermits promisors to draft promisees into their service) encourages\npromisors to consult their narrow self-interest in dealing with\npromisees. The critics believe that a morally better relation would\nrequire contracting parties to display some measure of affirmative\nother regard towards each other, on the model of fiduciary\nloyalty.  Orthodox views reply that contract—understood on the orthodox\nmodel that permits side-constrained self-interest—does not\ninvolve simply less other-regard than fiduciary loyalty but\nrather different other-regard. They add that the contractual\nversion of other-regard possess properties that make it morally\nappealing, at least within the spheres of life that contract typically\ngoverns (Markovits 2004a). Loyalty requires a fiduciary to adjust open-endedly to the\ninterests of her beneficiary as circumstances develop ex\npost. To make the required adjustments, and discharge her duty of\nloyalty, the fiduciary must adapt her conduct in light of her\nbeneficiary’s particular, substantive interests, about which\nshe must form her own opinions. Otherwise, she will not know what\nto deploy her loyalty in favor of. This necessarily imports a measure\nof paternalism into every fiduciary relation. Indeed, the paternalism\nis part of the point of the fiduciary relation, which displaces the\nbeneficiary’s own worse judgment in favor of her\nfiduciary’s better judgment; and the fiduciary’s duty of\nloyalty serves to guarantee that the fiduciary will indeed exercise\nher judgment on the beneficiary’s behalf. Fiduciary paternalism\ncan have real value, especially where beneficiaries reasonably\nmistrust their own judgment. But fiduciary paternalism has costs\nalso. In particular, beneficiaries find fiduciaries more helpful in\npromoting their interests than in asserting ongoing, independent\ncontrol over their own lives.  Orthodox views emphasize that contractual other-regard, by\ncontrast, possesses a thoroughgoingly anti-paternalist character. The\nduty of good faith in performance, including specifically by resisting\naltruism and ratifying (side-constrained) self-interest within the\ncontract relation, insists that all contractual sharing must be fixed\nex ante, according to the intentions of the contracting\nparties. A contractual promisor must take her promisee’s\nintentions at face value; she may not look behind them, and even\noverride them, in the service of the promisee’s true interests,\nas a fiduciary must do for her beneficiary. Contract law in this way\nforbids paternalism within contracts once made just as surely as it\nforbids paternalism in determining which contract might be made.  The\nduty of good faith in performance thus extends freedom of contract\ninto the interstices of the contract relation.  Those who defend contract’s departure from fiduciary law\nthus emphasize that fiduciaries are required by loyalty to engage\ntheir beneficiaries concretely, in terms of the beneficiaries’\nparticular interests and for the particular persons whom they are. But\ncontract-partners, by contrast, engage each other only abstractly,\nthrough their general personalities. That is, they contract based\nsimply on formal contractual capacity and take each other’s\nstated intentions at face value, never second-guessing each\nother’s substantive purposes. Orthodox approaches thus cast\ncontract as better than fiduciary law—morally better—for\nsustaining coordination at arm-length among independent traders, who\nwish to benefit from joint projects with others, and indeed to share\nthe gains from these projects with their counterparties, without\nassuming responsibility for their counterparties and all-the-while\nretaining rights to ongoing control over their own lives.","contact.mail":"daniel.markovits@yale.edu","contact.domain":"yale.edu"}]
