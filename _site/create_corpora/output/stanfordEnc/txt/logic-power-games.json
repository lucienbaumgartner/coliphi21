The\nmathematical languages discussed in this entry will be referred to as\nlogics, and classified according to their ability to\nexpress game-related concepts.\n\n\nThe material in this entry will be limited to the logical analysis of\nstrategies and preferences of (groups of) individuals in normal form\ngames. It will not cover the use of game theory to study logical\nlanguages nor the role of epistemic concepts in strategic decisions.\nIt will also not cover aspects of sequential decisions-making, typical\nof strategic reasoning in extensive games. An account of those can be\nfound in the related entries\n logic and games,\n epistemic foundations of game theory\n (see also van Benthem, Pacuit, & Roy 2011 and van Benthem 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\nA (normal-form) game is a mathematical description of\nthe relation between a set of individuals (or groups\nof individuals) and a set of potential outcomes.\nIndividuals choose, independently and concurrently, a\nsubset of the outcomes, with the final outcome being selected from the\ncombination of each choice. Independently means that\nindividuals’ choices do not influence one another.\nConcurrently means that each individual’s choices are\ntaken not knowing the other players’ choices. Each individual is\nassumed to have a preference over the set of outcomes, i.e., he or she\nlikes some outcomes more than others, and typically assumed to know\nthe other individuals’ potential choices and preferences,\nadjusting their decisions accordingly. \nGames are used to model all sorts of situations, ranging from animal\nbehavior to international conflict resolution (Osborne &\nRubinstein 1994). A useful application for the purpose of this entry\nis collective decision-making, an instance of which is going to be the\nworking example throughout. \nExample 1: (The treaty of Rome) \nThe treaty of Rome (1958–1973) established the European Economic\nCommunity. According to Article 148 of the Treaty, acts of the Council\n(one of the main legislative institutions) required for their\nadoption: \nThe values above refer to the EU-6, the founding member states. The\ntreaty allocated the votes as follows: \nThis scenario can be described as a game. \nThere are six players, the Countries:\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg. \nThey vote on one issue at the time. Issues can be binary, e.g., the\nadoption of a border-protection scheme, or multi-valued, e.g., how\nmany millions should be spent on the adoption of a border-protection\nscheme. \nCountries might have preferences over the outcome of the vote\nor even over the other Countries’ specific vote, and they\nusually vote without knowing how the others have voted. \nOften times, these games are such that no participant is, alone,\ncapable of deciding the final outcome, but, in some cases, they could\ncooperate and agree on a joint strategy. \nDepending on players’ preferences, knowledge and capabilities\nsome outcomes will be more likely to be chosen. In order to understand\nwhich ones, game theory has devised solution concepts, formally\nfunctions from the set of games to the set of outcomes in each of\nthese games, which describe players’ rationality in mathematical\nterms. Solution concepts, as we will see later, can be succinctly\nexpressed in simple and well-behaved logics. \nNext we describe games as mathematical structures, emphasizing various\nkey ingredients (e.g., the possibility of forming coalitions, the\npossibility to take decisions in time etc.) and the best suited\nlanguages to express them. \nFormally, games consist of a finite set of players \\(N=\\{1,2, \\ldots,\nn\\}\\) and a possibly infinite set of outcomes \\(W=\\{w_1, w_2, \\ldots,\nw_k, \\ldots \\}\\). \nExample 2: In the example above the set of players\nN is {France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands,\nLuxembourg}. If we consider the issue adoption of a\nborder-protection scheme, there are two outcomes: yes and no,\ni.e., \\(W = \\{\\mbox{yes, no}\\}\\). If we instead consider the issue\nmillions spent on border-protection scheme\nthere is a potentially infinite outcome space, i.e., \\(W =\n\\{\\textrm{0M}, \\textrm{1M}, \\textrm{2M}, \\ldots \\}\\). It is possible\nto have a set of outcomes that is even refined further, for instance\nspecifying the way players have voted. In this case the outcome in\nwhich France vote yes, the others vote no, and the result is no, would\nbe different from the outcome in which Italy vote yes, the others vote\nno, and the result is no, although the result of the vote is the same.\nWhat is important to emphasize is that each set of outcomes comes with\na level of description of what is happening in the underlying\ninteraction. There is no a priori right or wrong level of description,\nthe choice depends on the properties of the game that one is\ninterested in. \nOn top of players and outcomes, games come with two more\nrelations: \nAn important relation in games is knowledge, which formally describes\nwhat players know of the game and their opponents. This relation is\nsometimes given explicitly, other times left implicit. The present\nentry will not make the relation explicit, but will rather incorporate\nit in the formalization of players’ rationality. \nBoth the preference and the action relations collect families of\nindividual relations, one per player. The preference relation, for\ninstance, is broken down into a family \\(\\{\\succeq_i\\}_{i\\in N}\\),\ndescribing the preference over outcomes for each of the individuals,\nwhile the action relation collects a family \\(\\{E_C\\}_{C\\subseteq N}\\)\neach describing what a specific group of players can achieve. \nOverall, a game can be seen as a mathematical structure \nwhere \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is the set of players, typically finite, \\(W\\)\nthe set of outcomes, \\(\\succeq\\) the preference relation and \\(E\\) the\naction relation. \nThis mathematical structure is also known as a relational\nstructure (Blackburn, Rijke, & Venema 2001), which is the\nset-theoretic equivalent of a so-called modal logic\n(Blackburn et al. 2001), a mathematical language that is well-suited\nto express the mathematical properties of relations. A relational\nstructure will henceforth be denoted \\(F\\), which stands for\nframe. \nThe last ingredient that we need, in order to link relational\nstructures and modal logics, is the specification of a set of atomic\npropositions Atoms, which expresses the\nrelevant properties of the outcomes we are interested in. This set is\nusually taken to be\n countable[1]\n and is associated to outcomes by means of a valuation\nfunction, i.e., a function of the form  \nassociating to each outcome the set of propositional atoms that are\ntrue at that outcome. \nA tuple \\((F,V)\\) will be referred to as model, which\nwill be denoted \\(M\\). \nThe relations in a game structure, which are relative to individual\nplayers (and groups), will formally be described in connection with\nthe main modal logics used to express their properties, at different\nlevels of description and granularity. \nThe following paragraph collects the background technical notions\nneeded to interpret the modal languages used in this entry. The reader\nalready acquainted with modal logic can skip it. For a more in depth\nexploration one can consult the related entry on\n modal logic\n (Garson 2014). Well-known classic textbooks are Modal Logic: An\nIntroduction (Chellas 1980), which focuses on non-normal modal\nlogics, and Modal Logic (Blackburn et al. 2001), which\nfocuses instead on a more mathematical treatment of normal modal\n logics.[2] \nModal Logic: background notions: A modal\nlogic is an extension of the language of propositional logic\nwith a set of modal operators \\(\\Box_1,\\ldots , \\Box_n, \\ldots\\),\ndefined on a countable set of atomic propositions\n\\(\\texttt{Atoms}=\\{p_1,p_2, \\ldots \\}\\), over which the set of\nwell-formed formulas is inductively built (for a mathematical\ntreatment of logic and induction see for instance Dalen 1980). Each\nwell-formed formula \\(\\varphi\\) of a modal language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\),\nhenceforth simply called formula, is constructed using the\nfollowing grammar: \nwhere \\(\\Box_i \\in \\{\\Box_1, \\ldots, \\Box_n, \\ldots\\}\\) and \\(p \\in\n\\texttt{Atoms}\\). \nA model for this language is a structure \\(M = ((W, R_1, \\ldots, R_n,\n\\ldots), V)\\), consisting of a set of worlds or\nstates or outcomes \\(W\\); an\naccessibility relation \\(R_i\\) for each modal\noperator \\(\\Box_i\\), defined via so-called neighborhood functions\n(Chellas 1980), i.e., functions \\(R_i: W \\to 2^{2^{W}}\\); and a\nvaluation function \\(V: \\texttt{Atoms} \\to 2^{W}\\),\nwhich assigns to each atomic proposition a subset of \\(W\\), with the\nidea that each atomic proposition is assigned to the set of worlds at\nwhich this proposition is true. \nAs a general convention, a multimodal language with modalities\n\\(\\Box_1\\), …, \\(\\Box_n\\), … will be denoted by\n\\(\\mathcal{L}^{f(\\Box_1),\\ldots, f(\\Box_n),\\ldots}\\), where the\nfunction \\(f\\) associates to each modality its intuitive shorthand.\nLet \\(\\Delta\\) be a modal language consisting of modalities\n\\(\\Box_1\\), …, \\(\\Box_n\\), … and let \\(M = ((W, R_1,\n\\ldots, R_n, \\ldots), V )\\) be a model for this language. The\nsatisfaction relation of a formula \\(\\varphi \\in\n\\Delta\\) with respect to a pair \\((M,w)\\), where \\(w \\in W\\), is\ndefined according to the following truth conditions: \nwhere \\(\\varphi^{M}=\\{w \\in W \\mid M,w \\models \\varphi\\}\\) is called\nthe truth set or the extension of\n\\(\\varphi\\). \nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) of a modal language \\(\\Delta\\): holds at\na state \\(w\\) of model \\(M\\) whenever \\(M,w \\models\n\\varphi\\); is valid in a model \\(M\\), denoted\n\\(\\models_{M} \\varphi\\), if and only if \\(M,w \\models \\varphi\\) for\nevery \\(w \\in W\\), where \\(W\\) is the domain of \\(M\\); is\nvalid in a class of models \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), denoted\n\\(\\models_{\\mathcal{M}} \\varphi\\), if and only if it is valid in every\n\\(M \\in \\mathcal{M}\\); is valid in a frame \\({F}\\),\ndenoted \\(\\models_{{F}} \\varphi\\), if and only if for every valuation\n\\(V\\) we have that \\(\\models_{(F,V)} \\varphi\\); is valid in a\nclass of frames \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), denoted\n\\(\\models_{\\mathcal{F}} \\varphi\\), if and only if it is valid in every\n\\(F \\in \\mathcal{F}\\). \nThe set of formulas of \\(\\Delta\\) that are valid in a class of models\n\\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is denoted \\(\\Delta_{\\mathcal{M}}\\) (for frames the\ndenotation is \\(\\Delta_{\\mathcal{F}}\\)). For a set of formulas\n\\(\\Sigma\\), we write \\(M,w \\models \\Sigma\\) to say that \\(M,w \\models\n\\sigma\\), for all \\(\\sigma\\in \\Sigma\\). We say that a set of formulas\n\\(\\Sigma\\) semantically entails a formula \\(\\varphi\\)\nin a class of models \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), denoted \\(\\Sigma\n\\models_{\\mathcal{M}} \\varphi\\), if for every \\(M \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) we\nhave that \\(\\models_{M} \\Sigma\\) implies \\(\\models_{M} \\varphi\\). \nA modal rule \nis sound in a class of models \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) if\n\\(\\varphi_1,\\ldots ,\\varphi_n \\models_{\\mathcal{M}} \\psi\\). \nRecall, following Chellas (1980), that a modal logic \\(\\Delta\\) is\ncalled classical if it is closed under the rule of\nequivalence, i.e., for each \\(\\Box\\) in the language \\(\\Delta\\) we\nhave: \nIt is called monotonic if it is classical and it is\nmoreover closed under the rule of monotonicity, i.e., for each\n\\(\\Box\\) in the language \\(\\Delta\\) we have: \nIt is called normal if it is monotonic, it is closed\nunder the rule of generalization and contains the \\(K\\) axiom, i.e.,\nfor each \\(\\Box\\) in the formulas of \\(\\Delta\\) we have \nand \\(\\Delta\\) contains \\(\\Box(\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\Box \\varphi \\to\n\\Box \\psi)\\). \nA normal modal logic can be interpreted in structures of the form \\(M\n= ((W, R'_1, \\ldots, R'_n, \\ldots), V)\\), where each \\(R'_i\\) is a\nprincipal\n filter[3]\n or, alternatively, it is of the form \\(R'_i: W \\to 2^{W}\\). \nRecall the relational structure \\((\\mathcal{N},W, \\succeq, E)\\) and\nconsider the relation \\(\\succeq\\). This relation compactly represents\na family \\(\\{\\succeq_i\\}_{i\\in N}\\) of individual preference relations\neach indexed with a player. \nFormally, a preference for player \\(i\\) is a relation\n \nThe idea is that if two outcomes \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\) are such that\n\\((w,w')\\in \\succeq_i\\) then player \\(i\\) considers outcome \\(w\\) at\nleast as good as outcome \\(w'\\). The fact that \\((w,w')\\in \\succeq_i\\)\nwill be abbreviated \\(w \\succeq_i w'\\). Its inverse is the relation\n\\(\\preceq_i\\),which holds for \\((w,w')\\) whenever \\(w' \\succeq_i w\\).\nIts strict counterpart is the relation \\(\\succ_i\\), which holds for\n\\((w,w')\\) whenever \\(w \\succeq_i w'\\) and it is not the case that\n\\(w' \\succeq_i w\\). Moreover \\(w \\sim_i w'\\) denotes the fact that \\(w\n\\succeq_i w'\\) and \\(w' \\succeq_i w\\), meaning that \\(i\\) is\nindifferent between \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\). \nExample 3: Let us go back to our main example.\nTypically Countries have preferences over the outcome of the decision,\ne.g., Italy think we should spend between 5 and 10 million euros for\nthe scheme, Germany think we should spend between 1 and 2, Belgium\nbetween 4 and 5, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and France exactly 5.\nThis means, for instance, that Italy’s preference relation is\nsuch that \\(w \\succ_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\) whenever \\(\\textrm{5M} \\leq\nw \\leq \\textrm{10M}\\) and either \\(w'>\\textrm{10M}\\) or \\(0\\leq\nw'<\\textrm{5M}\\). What about all other couples of outcomes? In the\nsimplest case Italy are indifferent between them. So \\(w\n\\sim_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\), otherwise. However, we could also assume a\nmore complex preference. For instance, Italy would like to spend as\nmuch money as possible within their desired budget. In this case the\npreference relation is: \\(w \\succ_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\) whenever\n\\(\\textrm{5M} \\leq w \\leq \\textrm{10M}\\) and either\n\\(w'>\\textrm{10M}\\) or \\(0\\leq w'<\\textrm{5M}\\), \\(w\n\\succ_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\) whenever \\(\\textrm{5M} \\leq w' < w \\leq\n\\textrm{10M}\\) while \\(w \\sim_{\\textrm{Italy}} w'\\), otherwise. Not\nall outcomes of a vote are going to reach an agreement. We then, for\ntechnical purposes, define an auxiliary outcome \\(w^{d}\\), interpreted\nas a disagreement outcome. The idea is that this is an outcome of the\nvote that does not reach any consensus. We assume that any agreement\nis strictly better for any player than disagreement, i.e., \\(w\n\\succ_{{i}} w'\\) whenever \\(w'=w^{*}\\) and \\(w\\neq w^{*}\\), for each\n\\(i\\in N\\). \nProperties of these relations can be expressed by means of modal\nlogics. To do so we introduce modal operators\n\\(\\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i\\), \\(\\Diamond^{\\prec}_i\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond^{\\sim}_i\\) for each of the corresponding relations. \nThe interpretation, for \\(R \\in \\{\\preceq, \\prec, \\sim\\}\\), is as\nfollows: \nThe relations in question often come with extra properties. For\ninstance, \\(\\preceq_i\\) is usually taken to satisfy the following: \nThe first two properties can be characterized in a\nnormal modal logic with one modal operator per player, by means of the\nfollowing axioms and validities. \nProposition 1 \nHowever this is not the case for connectedness, as modal languages\nsuch as this one can only talk about local properties of\nrelations (Blackburn et al. 2001). \nTo do so we need to introduce a special type of operator: the\nuniversal (or global) modality (Goranko & Passy 1992). This\nmodality expresses properties of all the states in a domain \\(W\\) of a\nmodel \\(M\\) and it is interpreted as follows. \nThe formula \\(\\neg A \\neg \\varphi\\) will be abbreviated \\(E\\varphi\\).\nThe symbol \\(E\\) is the existential dual of \\(A\\) and it indicates\nthat a certain formula holds at some state in the model. With the\nglobal modality we have a genuine addition of expressivity (together\nwith further costs and further gains, as shown in Goranko & Passy\n1992), therefore we can express validity in a model by means of\nexpressing truth in a world, witness the fact that \\(M,w \\models A\n\\varphi\\) holds if and only if \\( \\models_M \\varphi\\) does. \nRecall that a relation \\(R\\) is trichotomous if and only if for all\n\\(x,y\\in W\\) it is either the case that \\(xRy, yRx\\) or \\(y=x\\). We\ncan use a combination of preference and global modalities to obtain\nthe following frame correspondence. \nProposition 2\nLet \\(F\\) be a frame. We have that: \n\\(\\models_F (\\varphi \\wedge \\Box^{\\preceq}_i \\psi) \\to A(\\psi \\vee\n\\varphi \\vee \\Diamond^{\\preceq}_i \\varphi)\\) if and only if\n\\(\\preceq_i\\) is trichotomous  \nAn alternative and possibly more intuitive formula that can be used\ninstead is, for \\(p,q\\) being atomic propositions:  \nTrichotomy, transitivity and reflexivity of \\(\\preceq_i\\) are\nequivalent to the relation being a weak linear order, and thus being\nconnected. \nThe relation \\(\\prec_i\\), i.e., the relation of strict preference, can\nbe defined in terms of \\(\\preceq_i\\). But \\(\\prec_i\\) satisfies the\nfollowing property: \nIrreflexivity is not definable in basic modal logic (Blackburn et al.\n2001). However if the atomic propositions are powerful enough to tell\neach outcome apart, then irreflexivity becomes definable. For instance\nlet \\(w_k\\) be a variable identifying world \\(w_k\\).[4]\n We have the following. \nProposition 3 \nFinally, the indifference relation \\(\\sim\\) satisfies the properties\nof reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry. While reflexivity and\ntransitivity are defined analogously to the previous modalities,\nsymmetry is defined as follows. \nWhile the axioms for the first two are similar to the ones for\n\\(\\preceq_i\\), symmetry is characterized as follows \nProposition 4 \nThe three properties above say, together, that each \\(\\sim_i\\) is\nmathematically an equivalence relation, i.e., a relation such that \nis a partition of \\(W\\). Each element of this partition is an\nindifference class for player \\(i\\), i.e., a set of\noutcomes he or she is indifferent to. \nThe logic of equivalence relations, such as \\(\\sim_i\\), is also known\nas the \\({\\bf S5}\\) system. \nPreferences and utilities Because of their widespread\nuse in game theory, an important class of preference relations are\nthose that correspond to numerical values, or utility\nfunctions. \nA utility function is a function  \nmapping outcomes to real numbers, representing how much a\nplayer values a certain state. \nUtility functions naturally induce preference relations, in the\nfollowing sense. \nDefinition 5\nLet \\(u\\) be a utility function. We say that \\(\\succeq^*_i\\)\ncorresponds to \\(u\\) if the following holds: \nNotice how every weak linear order over a finite set of outcomes \ncorresponds to some utility function. \nWe refer to the related entries on\n preferences\n (Hansson & Grune-Yanoff 2011) and\n decision-theory\n (Steele & Stefansson 2015) for a more detailed analysis on the\nrole of preferences in philosophy and decision theory. \nA game is also a description of what players can achieve, on their own\nor within coalitions. To formalize this we use effectivity functions,\nan abstract model of power introduced to study voting strategies in\ncommittees (Moulin & Peleg 1982). \nAn effectivity function (Moulin & Peleg 1982) is\na function  \nassociating to each group of players a set of sets of outcomes. \nThe idea is that, whenever it is the case that \\(X\\in E(C)\\), then\ncoalition \\(C\\) is able to decide that the outcome of the game lies\ninside the set \\(X\\), and can therefore rule out the outcomes \\(W\n\\setminus X\\) from being eventually chosen. In other words \\(X\\) is\nwithin the power of coalition \\(C\\). \nEffectivity functions are closed under supersets,\ni.e., we have that \\(X\\in E(C)\\) and \\(X\\subseteq Y \\subseteq W\\)\nimply that \\(Y \\in E(C)\\). In other words, if \\(X\\) is within the\npower of coalition \\(C\\) then so is each of \\(X\\)’s supersets.\nFrom this, notice, it follows that if an effectivity function of a\ncertain coalition is not empty then it always contains the set of all\noutcomes.\n\nFor \\(\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq {2^{W}}\\) we denote \\(\\mathcal{X}^{+}\\)\nits superset closure. \nExample 4: Going back to the main example, consider\nthe power of each individual Country. Because of the rules of the\ngame, no Country is alone in position to rule out any outcome. \nResorting to effectivity functions: for each \\(i\\in N\\), we have that\n\\(E(\\{i\\}) = \\{W\\}\\). \nThis is however also the case for coalitions that are not big enough.\nFor instance, take all coalitions of at least two Countries that can\nbe formed between The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. \nBecause their total weight sums to at most to 5 votes, they are not,\non their own, able to settle for or rule out any possible agreement.\nIn fact, for acts proposed by the Commission, each coalition \\(C\\)\nwhose voting weight is not at least 12 has the same effectivity\nfunction \\(E(C) = \\{W\\}\\). \nFor the other coalitions, the situation is different. Consider for\ninstance the coalition made by France, Germany and Italy, which,\ntogether, have a voting weight of 12. For them we have that: \nThis means that the three members can, on their own, decide the\noutcome of the vote. This is true for every coalition of voting weight\n12 or more. \nWhat about the acts not proposed by the Commission? For them let us\nuse a different effectivity function, which we label \\(E^{*}\\). \nIn this case the winning coalition has to consist of at least four\nmembers. \nSo \\(E^{*}(\\{\\mbox{France, Germany, Italy}\\}) = \\{W\\}\\) while\n\\(E^{*}(\\{\\)France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands\\(\\}) = \\{\\{w\\}\n\\mid w \\in W\\}^{+}\\). \nIn general, it holds that \\(E(C)=E^{*}(C)\\) whenever \\(|C|\\geq 4\\).\nBecause of the properties of the voting game, we also have that\n\\(E(C)=E^{*}(C)\\) whenever \\(|C|\\leq 2\\). The difference is made by\ncoalitions of size 3: with \\(E^{*}\\), they can never achieve more than\n\\(\\{W\\}\\), while with \\(E\\) they can achieve \\(\\{\\{w\\} \\mid w \\in\nW\\}^{+}\\), if their voting power is at least 12. Notice that\nLuxembourg is irrelevant when it comes to bills proposed by the\nCommission, i.e., \\(E(C) = E(C \\cup \\textrm{ Luxembourg})\\). This is\nnot the case for the other bills, as we have observed. \nProperties of effectivity functions can be expressed in modal logic.\nTo do so it is important to observe that each effectivity function\ncorresponds to a (non-normal) relation in a relational structure. So\nwhat effectivity functions do is to induce a special kind of\nneighborhood structure, which we refer to as Coalition\nModel. \nDefinition 6 [Coalition\nModels] A Coalition Model is a triple \\((W,E,\nV)\\) where: \nAs the reader will notice, dynamic effectivity functions allow each\nstate to possibly have different power distributions among coalitions.\nThis is strictu sensu irrelevant for the treatment of power\nin normal form games\n (Section 3),\n where the effectivity functions associated to outcomes could as well\nbe taken to be equivalent everywhere in the model, but the model is\ngeneral enough to treat extensive and repeated interaction, where the\nsequential structure of the interaction is defined explicitly. We will\nusually abbreviate \\(E(w)(C)\\) as \\(E_w(C)\\) or even \\(E(C)\\) when\nclear from the context. \nThe language used to talk about Coalition Models is Coalition\nLogic (Pauly 2001), a non-normal modal logic to express\nchoices of groups of players. Coalition Logic is an extension of\npropositional logic with \\(|2^{N}|\\) modalities of the form \\([C]\\),\nso a modal operator each indexed with a coalition. \nThe satisfaction relation of the formulas of the form \\([C]\\varphi\\)\nwith respect to a pair \\(M,w\\) is defined as follows: \nwhere, \\(\\varphi^M = \\{w\\in W \\mid M,w\\models\\varphi\\}\\). \nIntuitively \\(\\varphi^M\\in E_w(C)\\) means that coalition \\(C\\) is able\nto achieve property \\(\\varphi\\). \nAs closure under superset, or outcome monotonicity,\nis taken to be a property of all effectivity functions, the rule of\nmonotonicity is valid in Coalition Logic, which is therefore a\nmonotonic modal logic (Hansen 2003). \nThe rule of monotonicity takes this form for each \\(C\\subseteq\nN\\): \nIntuitively, if \\(C\\) is able to achieve \\(\\varphi\\) and we have that\n\\(\\varphi\\) implies \\(\\psi\\), then \\(C\\) is also able to achieve\n\\(\\psi\\). \nMathematical properties of power Apart from outcome\nmonotonicity, many other properties can be deemed necessary to model\ncoalitional power in games. For instance an effectivity function has\nthe property of: \nAn effectivity function is called playable (Pauly\n2001) if it has liveness, safety, N-maximality and\nsuperadditivity. It is called truly playable\n(Goranko, Jamroga, & Turrini 2013) if it is playable and\nwell-founded. Observe that if \\(W\\) is finite, an effectivity function\nis playable if and only if it is truly playable (Goranko et al.\n2013). \nTrue playability is a fundamental property of effectivity functions,\nand connects one-shot coalitional games to one-shot strategic games,\nas will be clear later. \nExample 5: The\neffectivity functions of our working example are all truly\nplayable. \nIn neighborhood structures, relations between set-theoretical and\nlogical properties are often immediate and standard correspondence\nresults between class of frames and neighborhood functions (Chellas\n1980) can be automatically used for Coalition Logic. \nCoalition Logic is in fact expressive enough to characterize all the\nconstraints mentioned so far. \nProposition 7\nLet \\(F=(W,E)\\) be a Coalition Frame, and \\(C,C^{\\prime}, C''\\) be\ncoalitions, such that \\(C \\cap C'=\\emptyset\\) and \\(C \\subseteq C''\\).\nThe following results hold: \nFor the proofs, consult Pauly 2001. \nCorrespondence results allow us to distinguish by modal means a number\nof class of frames. However expressivity of the modal operators\nstrongly limit the capacity of the language to discern classes of\nstructures. To this extent the reader should notice that the logics of\nboth playable and truly playable effectivity frames share the fact\nthat \\(\\models_F [\\emptyset]\\top\\). However this proposition, whose\ninterpretation is that for each \\(w\\in W, \\{W\\} \\in E_w(\\emptyset)\\),\nis not sufficient to make a formal distinction between\n\\(E_w(\\emptyset)\\) in the two different classes of effectivity\nfunctions. \nAlong these lines, the following result tells us that Coalition Logic\nis also good enough to reason about (or, if you prefer, too weak to\ndistinguish) truly playable effectivity functions. \nTheorem 8 (Goranko et\nal. 2013) Let \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) be the class of playable frames\nand \\(\\mathcal{P}^{*}\\) the class of truly playable ones. Then, for\nevery formula of Coalition Logic \\(\\varphi\\) \nThis follows from the fact that Playable Coalition Logic has the\nfinite model property (Pauly 2001) and, in finite models, playable\neffectivity functions are truly\n playable.[5] \nAs pointed out earlier on, this entry will only mention how knowledge\nis implicit in game structures but will not delve into the study of\nepistemic preconditions of rational play. Related entries devoted\nto\n epistemic logic\n (Hendricks & Symons 2006),\n dynamic epistemic logic\n (Baltag & Renne 2016), and in particular\n epistemic game theory\n (Pacuit & Roy 2015) explore in depth the role of knowledge in\ndecision-making. A treatment of modal logics for games which focuses\ninstead on the role of information is Hoek & Pauly 2006. \nThis section looks at games in which individuals or groups take their\nchoices independently and concurrently, and, we stress once more,\nabstracting away from how the interaction evolves in time. It pays\nparticular attention to the relation between players’ choices\nand preferences, mentioning the role of knowledge, and most\nimportantly it deals with how to express solution concepts in a\nlogical language. \nThe section first describes the general setting of cooperative games,\nthen it considers the more restricted and possibly better-known class\nof strategic games. \nThe description of the game given in a relational structure of the\nform \\((\\mathcal{N}, W, \\succeq, E)\\) is not enough to understand\nwhich exact outcome will be chosen in the end. For that we\nneed a solution concept, i.e., a mapping that associates to a game a\nset of outcomes of that game (Abdou & Keiding 1991). \nA number of solution concepts have been introduced for coalitional\ngames (see for instance Osborne & Rubinstein 1994, and Apt 2009\n(Other Internet Resources)).  For the present purposes we are only\ngoing to discuss what is possibly the best-known: the core. The core\nis a collection of stable outcomes, i.e., outcomes for which no\ncoalition exists whose members are both able and willing to deviate\nfrom it. It can be seen as the set of outcomes to which there is\nno effective opposition (Abdou & Keiding 1991). \nFormally, given a relational structure \\(F=(\\mathcal{N}, W, \\succeq,\nE)\\), an outcome \\(w\\in W\\) is said to be stable if\nthere is no coalition \\(C\\) and set of outcomes \\(X\\subseteq W\\) such\nthat both of the following conditions are satisfied: \nIn words, an outcome is stable if there is no group of individuals\nthat can achieve an alternative that they all strictly prefer. \nThe core is the collection of all stable\noutcomes. \nExample 6: \nConsider the outcome 1M, which is the only outcome that Germany\nreckons acceptable. Germany, as already observed, have an effectivity\nfunction of \\(E(\\{\\textrm{Germany}\\})=\\{W\\}\\) so, on their own, are\nnot able to turn their preference into an outcome. However, together\nwith other Countries, they are able to do so. Suppose their allies are\nBelgium, France and The Netherlands. Is 1M then a good\noutcome? If we look at the preferences of the other players in the\ncoalition, i.e., Belgium, France, The Netherlands, we observe the\nfollowing. Belgium had rather an outcome between 4M and 5M, France and\nThe Netherlands exactly 5M. These Countries could get together and\nselect 5M, which is an outcome that is acceptable to them. However the\neffectivity function of \\(\\{\\)Belgium, France, The Netherlands\\(\\}\\)\nis \\(E(\\{\\)Belgium, France, The Netherlands\\(\\})=\\{W\\}\\), which means\nthat the three Countries are not enough to pass the 5M bill. But the\ncoalition made by Belgium, France, Italy and The Netherlands would be.\nNotice moreover that 5M is one of Italy’s preferred outcomes. 5M\nis in fact the only stable outcome of the game: there is no coalition\nthat is together willing and capable of deviating from it. \nModal logic can be used to represent the core. Consider first the\nformula \nThis says that if \\(p\\) is true then members of some coalition can\nimprove upon some \\(p\\) world, which does not seem the right\nformula to express stability in logic. However we can prove the following results, which utilizes the\ncorrespondence between the formula and a specific class of frames. \nLet \\(E\\) be an (outcome monotonic) effectivity function and let\n\\(\\succeq_i\\) a weak linear order. Then: \nholds at \\(w\\) for each \\(V'\\) if and only there exists a \\(C\\subseteq\nN\\) and \\(X \\in E_w(C)\\) such that, for all \\(i\\in C\\), \\(x\\in X\\) we\nhave that \\(x \\succ_i w\\). \nSo the formula holds at \\(w\\) for each valuation if and only if \\(w\\)\ndoes not belong to the core. Clearly, if the formula is false at an\noutcome and some valuation, then this means that the outcome does\nbelong to the core. \nNotice that, since effectivity functions are outcome monotonic, if we\nhave that \\(X \\in E_w(C)\\) and  \nthen \nAlso notice that the result above allows for the case of  \nwhich might be counterintuitive. Requiring \\(E\\) to have liveness\ntakes care of this. \nNotice also how we had to impose a universal quantification on the set\nof valuations. Without this explicit quantification, the formula would\nonly hold for one specific model, which would not be an appropriate\nsolution. If instead we are only interested in knowing whether\nthere exists some outcome that is stable or, conversely,\nwhether the core is empty, it is sufficient to require the formula\nabove to be an axiom. This would amount to say that no\noutcome is stable, i.e., that the core is empty. \nProposition 10\nLet \\(F\\) be a frame. We have that \nif and only if no outcome in \\(F\\) belongs to the core. \nAgain, liveness would take care of the trivial case in which \nAn alternative approach is to identify each outcome with a name (or nominal) in the\nlanguage, i.e., to use a hybrid logic. Then we have the following. \nProposition 11\nLet \\(w_k\\) an atomic proposition be true at outcome \\(w_k\\) and only at\noutcome \\(w_k\\). \nif and only if \\(w_k\\) does not belong to the core. \nSo depending on the properties we are interested in, different\nextensions of basic modal logic combined with different forms of\nvalidity (at a world vs model vs frame) are best-suited to express\nthem. \nNormal form games, or strategic games, are a representation of what\nindividuals, rather than coalitions, can achieve, and what their\npreferences are. \nFormally, a strategic game form is a tuple \nwhere N is a finite set of players, \\(W\\) a set of outcomes,\n\\(\\{\\Sigma_i\\}_{i\\in N}\\) a collection of strategies, one for each\nplayer \\(i\\), \\(o: \\prod_{i\\in N} \\Sigma_i \\to W\\) an outcome\nfunction, associating a tuple of strategies to an outcome. \nA strategic game is a tuple \\((S,\\{\\succeq_i\\}_{i\\in N})\\), where\n\\(S\\) is a strategic game form and \\(\\{\\succeq_i\\}_{i\\in N}\\) a\ncollection of preference relations, one for each player \\(i\\). \nExample 7: If\nwe think of the Countries in our previous example as individual\nplayers and their votes as individual strategies, we can model the\nTreaty of Rome game as a strategic game, where each individual can\nvote an amount of money to dedicate to border protection and\npreferences are as above. \nThe outcome function will take care to associate to each individual\nplayer’s vote the final outcome of the collective decision,\ne.g., selecting an outcome voted by a set of Countries with voting\nweight of at least 12, or resulting in no decision if no consensus is\nreached. \nFor instance: \nThis round results in no decision, because no outcome has collected\nvoting weight of at least 12. \nHowever, suppose that the second round is such that everyone but\nBelgium stick to their vote, and assume Belgium switches to voting 0M.\nNow 0M has an aggregate of 13, which means it is chosen as the final\ndecision. \nLooking at the unified treatment of our example, there seem to be\nrelationship between normal form games and coalitional games. This\nrelationship can be specified formally. \nLet us first consider what a group of players can do in a normal form\ngame. To do so we define the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity\nfunction, a mathematical description of coalitional\nstrategies in a game in terms of the sets outcomes that they can\nforce. \nDefinition 12\n[\\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function] Let \\(S\\) be a strategic\ngame. We define the \\(\\alpha\\) effectivity function of \\(S\\),\n\\(E^{\\alpha}_S(C)\\): \n\\(E^{\\alpha}_S(C)= \\{X\\ \\mid\\) there exists \\(\\sigma_C\\) such that for\nall \\(\\sigma'_{\\overline{C}}\\) we have that\n\\(o(\\sigma_C,\\sigma'_{\\overline{C}})\\in X \\}\\) \nIntuitively the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of \\(S\\) collects, for\nevery group of players, the set of outcomes that they can achieve by\nfixing a strategy of theirs, no matter how their opponents play. \nProposition 13 (Goranko et al. 2013) \nThe \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of a strategic game is truly\nplayable. \nThe following result shows the relationship between strategies and\neffectivity functions. \nTheorem 14 (Goranko et al. 2013) \nAn effectivity function is truly playable if and only if it is the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of some strategic game. \nThis is a generalization of the result in Peleg 1998 for finite games,\nstarting from models of strategic games first defined in Pauly 2001.\nIn a nutshell what these results imply is the following. \nProposition 15\nLet \\(F\\) a relational game structure. Then \\(F\\) is a strategic game\nif and only if the following formulas are valid in \\(F\\) for disjoint\n\\(C,C^{\\prime}\\): \nIn the same way we did for cooperative games, we can ask ourselves\nwhether an outcome is stable, or rational, in a strategic\nsituation. \nNash equilibrium and definability The main solution\nconcept to analyze strategic games is Nash equilibrium. Informally a\nNash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one per player, such\nthat no player is interested to change his or her strategy, given the\nothers stick to theirs. Formally, a strategy profile \\(\\sigma\\) is a\n(pure strategy) Nash equilibrium if for all players\n\\(i\\in N\\) and for all \\(\\sigma'_i\\in \\Sigma_i\\) we have that \nExample 8:\nConsider the following vote \nIn this game there is no consensus on any budget. The situation might\nlook like a deadlock, as everyone has voted according to their\npreference. However the outcome is disagreement, which no player\nprefers to any agreement. The only way that players can converge to an\nagreement is that Italy change their vote to 5M. If this happens 5M is\nachieved as an outcome. \nNotice that the modified game, in which Italy vote 5M is a Nash\nequilibrium. \nConsider now a modification of the game above, in which Italy and The\nNetherlands vote 10M, while the others stick to their vote.\nSurprisingly, despite the disagreement, this is Nash equilibrium,\nbecause no player is simultaneously able to get to some agreement,\nalthough being willing to do so. \nHow to express Nash equilibria in logic? Recall how the formula  \nholds at a frame \\(F\\) if and only if the core is empty, and a hybrid\nlogic extension can tell us whether a specific outcome belongs to the\ncore. If \\(F\\) is based on a truly playable effectivity function we\nalready have a normal form game version of the core: an outcome such\nthat no coalition is together able and willing to deviate from,\nnot taking into account what the others do. However Nash\nEquilibrium fixes a profile of strategies, such that no player is able\nand willing to deviate from there. In other words it requires the\nnotion of best response for a player with respect to a given\nprofile. \nFormalisms such as Coalition Logic are too weak to express Nash\nequilibria. However, they can express the fact that certain\neffectivity functions allow for the possibility of a Nash equilibrium.\nThis is what in Hansen & Pauly 2002 is called Nash-consistent\nCoalition Logic. Nash Equilibrium is in fact not definable in basic\nmodal logic (Benthem et al. 2011), but it can be done with a modality\nthat intersects both the preference and the choice relations\n(Benthem et al. 2011). \n\\((F,V),w\\models \\langle \\approx_i \\cap \\succ_i \\rangle \\varphi\\) if\nand only if \\(w(\\approx_i \\cap \\succ_i)w'\\) implies that \\(w'\\models\n\\varphi \\) \nThen the best response for \\(i\\) is defined as \\( \\langle \\approx_i\n\\cap \\succ_i \\rangle \\top\\), as there is no alternative that is at the\nsame time achievable and preferable to \\(i\\). Alternatively a hybrid\nlogic that mentions strategy profiles in the language can provide a\nsolution, similarly to the case of the core. \nSome logics exploit a more compact representation of those relational\nstructures that correspond to strategic games. \nRather than using effectivity functions, each player \\(i\\) is\nassociated with an equivalence relation \\(\\approx_i \\subseteq W\\times\nW\\), whose induced partition represent the choices he or she can\nperform. These equivalence relations describe the exact set of choices\nthat a group of players can perform and the originating models are\nreferred to as consequentialist in the literature (see for\ninstance Belnap, Perloff, & Ming 2001). \nNow define an effectivity function \\(E^{*}\\) for which it holds\nthat \nIntuitively \\(E^{*}(i)\\) collects what exactly the\nindividuals can achieve and all their supersets. \n\\(E^{*}\\) is called consequentialist if holds\nthat: \nNotice that \\(E^*\\) is a truly playable effectivity function. \nThe last property is well-foundedness, as in the case of arbitrary\neffectivity functions. This is not a property that is assumed in all\nvariants, e.g., the choice structures in Kooi & Tamminga 2008 and\nits temporal variant STIT (Belnap et al. 2001) do not. However, as\nobserved in Turrini 2012 and Tamminga 2013, well-founded\nconsequentialist models correspond to strategic games and the\neffectivity function \\(E\\) can be effectively simulated by the\nequivalence relation \\(\\approx_i\\) for each player. Intuitively\n\\(E^{*}(i)\\) is the set of sets of outcomes that \\(i\\) can choose\nwithout being able to refine further. \nTo reason about consequentialist models, we use so-called\nconsequentialist logics, i.e., propositional logic extended with\nmodalities of the form \\([C]\\varphi\\), interpreted as follows: \n\\(M,w \\models [C]\\varphi\\) if and only if \\(M,w'\\models \\varphi\\) for\nall \\(w'\\) such that \\(w (\\bigcap_{i \\in C} \\approx_i)w'\\)  \nConsequentialist logics have been developed to reason about action and\nconsequence, and have interesting applications in deontic logic, such\nas Kooi & Tamminga 2008; Tamminga 2013; Turrini 2012. They are\nmoreover the basis of temporal logics of strategy such as STIT and\nstrategic STIT, discussed later. A special case are the logics of\npropositional control (Hoek & Wooldridge 2005; Troquard, Hoek,\n& Wooldridge 2009). \nIn many situations agents have control over certain propositional\nvariables (Hoek & Wooldridge 2005), for instance they can be\nresponsible for traffic flow or they can veto a certain issue.\nVariables can also be shared (Gerbrandy 2006), an example being\nvoting, where players share control over a variable whose realization\nis determined by a certain aggregation function, e.g., majority\n(Troquard, Hoek, & Wooldridge 2011). These logics of\npropositional control specify what propositions agents have\nin their effectivity function. For instance, if agent \\(i\\) controls\n\\(p\\), then both \\(p^{M}\\) and \\(\\neg p^{M}\\) are in his or her\neffectivity function. In a way these models are very special types of\neffectivity function, and what agents control can be seen as a choice,\nor a strategy, available to them. \nLogics for propositional control have modalities of the type\n\\([[i]]\\varphi\\), meaning that player \\(i\\) has a\n“control” strategy to see to it that, no matter how the\nother agents choose their control strategies, then \\(\\varphi\\) holds\nin the end. But they also have modalities of the type\n\\([[C]]\\varphi\\), meaning that players in \\(C\\) have a joint control\nstrategy ensuring \\(\\varphi\\) in the end. A strategy profile is thus\nequivalent to a valuation function, which assigns a truth value of\nevery proposition available. In turn, a strategy of a player \\(i\\) can\nthus be seen as a partial valuation function, that assigns a truth\nvalue only to the propositions controlled by \\(i\\). \nSlightly abusing notation, we say that a valuation \\(V\\) satisfies a\nformula \\(\\varphi\\), denoted \\(V \\models \\varphi\\), whenever it makes\n\\(\\varphi\\) true under the current assignment of propositions. In\nother words, propositional control games are played in one single\nworld, and the individual assignments determine what propositions are\ntrue are that world. Denoting \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) the set of all\nvaluations and \\(\\mathcal{V}_i\\) to the partial ones under the control\nof \\(i\\) we have the following. \n\\((F,V) \\models [[C]]\\varphi\\) if and only if for all \\(i \\in C\\),\nthere exists \\(V'_i \\in \\mathcal{V}_i\\) such that, for all \\(k \\in\n\\overline{C}, V'_{k}\\in \\mathcal{V}_k\\), we have that \\((F,V')\\models\n\\varphi\\) \nSo when \\([[C]]\\varphi\\) holds, coalition \\(C\\) can play a control\nstrategy in such a way that no matter what the control strategy is\nthat their opponents play, the resulting outcome satisfies\n\\(\\varphi\\). \nLogics for propositional control can be extended to goal-based\nformalisms, the so called Boolean games (Harrenstein, van der Hoek,\nMeyer, & Witteveen 2001): propositions are partitioned among the\nplayers, with each player controlling the set of propositions he or\nshe is assigned to. On top of that each player is also assigned a\nformula of propositional logic which is meant to be his or her goal\nand whose realization might not only depend upon the choices he or she\nis able to make. \nBoolean games have been extensively studied in the field of\nmulti-agent systems, as simple and compact models to represent\nstrategic interaction in a logic-based setting (Dunne & Hoek 2004;\nDunne & Wooldridge 2012; Dunne, Hoek, Kraus, & Wooldridge\n2008). \nIn their most general variants they are an extension of logics with\npropositional control, where each agent is assigned a goal formula.\nThe goal formula is a satisfiable formula of the language and the\nimportant feature is that the goal of each agent does not need to be\nunder his or her control. \nFor instance, agent \\(i\\) may be assigned the control of proposition\n\\(p\\) only, but might have the goal that \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\). So\nwhether \\(i\\)’s goal is satisfied depends not only on \\(i\\)\nsetting proposition \\(p\\) to be true, but also some other agent, say\n\\(j\\), setting proposition \\(q\\) to be true. Agent \\(j\\), on the other\nhand, might or might not be interested in having \\(q\\) set to true.\nFor instance he or she may want proposition \\(r\\) to be true, and\ntherefore being indifferent to whether \\(q\\) or \\(\\overline{q}\\) is\nrealized in the end. Or might even have the goal that\n\\(\\overline{q}\\). \nIn Boolean games some objectives can be realized all together, for\ninstance agents might all want \\(p \\vee \\neg q\\) to be true, or it\nmight be the case that certain valuations do not realize the\nobjectives of all agents, but no unhappy agent is able to improve his\nor her own situation by changing the assignment to the propositional\nvariables he or she controls. This situation is a very simple form of\nNash equilibrium that can be expressed in Boolean games. \nSo, for \\(\\gamma_i\\) being the objective of player \\(i\\) and \\(v_i\\) a\npartial valuation that is under control of player \\(i\\), we say that\nvaluation \\(v\\) is a Nash equilibrium if we have that for each \\(i\\)\nand each \\(v'_i\\). \nSo if \\(v\\) does not satisfy \\(i\\)’s goal, there is nothing\n\\(i\\) can do to satisfy it. \nThe analysis of Nash equilibria in Boolean game shows a close\ncorrespondence between these games and propositional logic: using a\nreduction to the satisfiability problem of propositional logic\nformulas, the problem of checking whether an outcome \\(v\\) is a Nash\nequilibrium of a Boolean game is co-NP complete (Wooldridge, Endriss,\nKraus, & Lang 2013). \nRecall the very first example, in which the set of outcomes of a\nvoting game could be described only considering the overall outcome of\nthe vote or by explicitly describing what each of the Countries had\nvoted. \nOften times, when describing mathematical structures by succinct\nlanguages we are confronted with the question of which one is the most\nsuitable language. Some are able to express preferences, knowledge and\ncoalitional ability all together, some others only about two of them,\nsome others about only one. Finally some languages might only be able\nto express what individuals, and not coalitions, can achieve. \nAgain, there is no right answer to this question. It all depends on\nwhat the fundamental characteristics are that one is trying to model.\nTo express Nash equilibria in a coordination game, there is no need\nfor a temporal logic-based formalism. On the contrary, if one wants to\nexpress backwards induction, then a language that does not make the\nsequential structure of the decision problem explicit is probably not\nthe right one. \nGoing back to our example, some Countries might have preferences over\nhow other Countries vote, and this might affect their decision-making,\nchanging the overall equilibrium points of the game. If this is the\ncase then the richer language matters. Otherwise, if we can safely\nrule out this possibility, the more succinct language seems to be the\nappropriate choice.","contact.mail":"p.turrini@imperial.ac.uk","contact.domain":"imperial.ac.uk"}]
