Deliberation of this\nkind is practical in at least two senses. First, it is practical in\nits subject matter, insofar as it is concerned with action. But it is\nalso practical in its consequences or its issue, insofar as reflection\nabout action itself directly moves people to act.  Our capacity for\ndeliberative self-determination raises two sets of philosophical\nproblems.  First, there are questions about how deliberation can\nsucceed in being practical in its issue. What do we need to\nassume—both about agents and about the processes of reasoning\nthey engage in—to make sense of the fact that deliberative\nreflection can directly give rise to action? Can we do justice to this\ndimension of practical reason while preserving the idea that practical\ndeliberation is genuinely a form of reasoning? Second, there are large\nissues concerning the content of the standards that are brought to\nbear in practical reasoning.  Which norms for the assessment of action\nare binding on us as agents? Do these norms provide resources for\ncritical reflection about our ends, or are they exclusively\ninstrumental? Under what conditions do moral norms yield valid\nstandards for reasoning about action? The first set of issues is\naddressed in sections 1–3 of the present article, while sections\n4–5 cover the second set of issues. \n\n\n Practical reason defines a distinctive standpoint of\nreflection. When agents deliberate about action, they think about\nthemselves and their situation in characteristic ways. What are some\nof the salient features of the practical point of view? \n A natural way to interpret this point of view is to contrast it with\nthe standpoint of theoretical reason. The latter standpoint is\noccupied when we engage in reasoning that is directed at the\nresolution of questions that are in some sense theoretical rather than\npractical; but how are we to understand this opposition between the\ntheoretical and the practical? One possibility is to understand\ntheoretical reflection as reasoning about questions of explanation and\nprediction. Looking backward to events that have already taken place,\nit asks why they have occurred; looking forward, it attempts to\ndetermine what is going to happen in the future. In these ways,\ntheoretical reflection is concerned with matters of fact and their\nexplanation.  Furthermore it treats these issues in impersonal terms\nthat are accessible (in principle) to anyone.  Theoretical reasoning,\nunderstood along these lines, finds paradigmatic expression in the\nnatural and social sciences. \n Practical reason, by contrast, takes a distinctively normative\nquestion as its starting point. It typically asks, of a set of\nalternatives for action none of which has yet been performed, what one\nought to do, or what it would be best to do. It is thus concerned not\nwith matters of fact and their explanation, but with matters of value,\nof what it would be desirable to do.  In practical reasoning agents\nattempt to assess and weigh their reasons for action, the\nconsiderations that speak for and against alternative courses of\naction that are open to them. Moreover they do this from a\ndistinctively first-personal point of view, one that is defined in\nterms of a practical predicament in which they find themselves (either\nindividually or collectively—people sometimes reason jointly\nabout what they should do together). \n There is, however, a different way of understanding the contrast\nbetween practical and theoretical reason, stressing the parallels\nrather than the differences between the two forms of\nreflection. According to this interpretation, theoretical reflection\ntoo is concerned with a normative rather than a factual question,\nnamely with the question of what one ought to believe.  It attempts to\nanswer this normative question by assessing and weighing reasons for\nbelief, the considerations that speak for and against the particular\nconclusions one might draw about the way the world is. Furthermore, it\ndoes this from a standpoint of first-personal reflection: the stance\nof theoretical reasoning in this sense is the committed stance of the\nbeliever, not the stance of detached contemplation of one’s\nbeliefs themselves (Moran 2001). Seen in this way, the contrast\nbetween practical and theoretical reason is essentially a contrast\nbetween two different systems of norms: those for the regulation of\naction on the one hand, and those for the regulation of belief on the\nother. \n Theoretical reason, interpreted along these lines, addresses the\nconsiderations that recommend accepting particular claims as to what\nis or is not the case.  That is, it involves reflection with an eye to\nthe truth of propositions, and the reasons for belief in which it\ndeals are considerations that speak in favor of such propositions’\nbeing true, or worthy of acceptance. Practical reason, by contrast, is\nconcerned not with the truth of propositions but with the desirability\nor value of actions. The reasons in which it deals are considerations\nthat speak in favor of particular actions being good, or worthy of\nperformance in some way. This difference in subject matter corresponds\nto a further difference between the two forms of reason, in respect of\ntheir consequences. Theoretical reflection about what one ought to\nbelieve produces changes in one’s overall set of beliefs, whereas\npractical reason gives rise to action; as noted above, it is practical\nnot only in its subject matter, but also in its issue. \n Two observations should be made about this way of understanding\npractical reason. First, the contrast just drawn might suggest that\nthere is a categorial difference in the consequences of theoretical\nand practical reason, insofar as the former produces changes in our\nmental states, whereas the latter gives rise to bodily movements. But\nit would be misleading to contrast the two kinds of rational capacity\nin these terms. Practical reasoning gives rise not to bodily movements\nper se, but to intentional actions, and these are intelligible as such\nonly to the extent they reflect our mental states. It would thus be\nmore accurate to characterize the issue of both theoretical and\npractical reason as attitudes; the difference is that\ntheoretical reasoning leads to modifications of our beliefs, whereas\npractical reasoning leads to modifications of our intentions (Harman\n1986, Bratman 1987). \n Second, it is important to be clear that in neither case do the\ncharacteristic modifications of attitude occur infallibly. There is\nroom for irrationality both in the theoretical and the practical\ndomain, which in its strongest form involves a failure to form the\nattitudes that one acknowledges to be called for by the considerations\none has reflected on. Thus a person might end up reading a mystery\nnovel for another hour, while at the same time judging that it would\nbe better on the whole to go back to work on their paper for the\nupcoming conference. Practical irrationality of this latter kind is\nknown as akrasia, incontinence, or weakness of will, and its\nnature and even possibility are traditional subjects of philosophical\nspeculation in their own right. If we assume that this strong kind of\npractical irrationality is possible, however, then we must grant that\npractical reason is not automatically practical in its issue. A more\naccurate way to represent the consequences of practical reason would\nbe to say that deliberation about action generates appropriate\nintentions insofar as an agent is rational (Korsgaard 1996a).   \nIntentions and beliefs are not the only attitudes that are answerable\nto reasons; emotions too have their reasons, understood as\nconsiderations by reference to which they can be justified or\ncriticized. Thus it is appropriate or fitting for someone who is in\nthe presence of imminent danger to feel fear, and by the same token\nfear is inapt or irrational if it is felt about something that is not\ndangerous at all. Though emotions are responsive to reasons, however,\nwe do not typically form or modify them through processes of\nreflection or deliberation. Reflective modification of our beliefs and\nintentions, by contrast, is common, and commonly understood to involve\nan exercise of our capacities for theoretical and practical\nreason.  \nReasoning is an inferential process that takes as input some attitudes\nof a subject, and yields as output the formation or modification of\nother attitudes. Inferential processes of this kind are involved in\nthe paradigmatic cases in which we exercise our capacities for both\ntheoretical and practical reason. In the practical case, however,\nthere is an interesting question about how exactly to understand the\nnew or modified attitudes that are the outputs of our reasoning about\nwhat to do. On a broad understanding of practical reasoning, it is an\ninferential process through which new intentions are formed or old\nones modified. According to this view, we resolve through reasoning\nthe question of what we are going to do (Broome 2013, McHugh and Way\n2016). A narrower understanding has it that reasoning should be\nunderstood as an inferential process whereby we modify our beliefs,\nincluding our normative beliefs about what we ought to do. On this\ninterpretation, practical reasoning, strictly speaking, is an\ninferential process through which we adjust our beliefs about action,\nincluding our beliefs about what we have reason to do; but the\nadjustments in our intentions that result from such reflection are not\nthemselves conclusions of reasoning (Raz 2011, chap. 7). Agents who\nhave resolved the question of what they ought to do still have a\nquestion to settle, about what they are going to do. But proponents of\nthe narrower view would note that this further question is not one\nthat is to be resolved through reasoning: once one has figured out\nwhat one ought to do, there is no practical reasoning left to\nbe done.  \nProponents of both the broader and the narrower accounts of reasoning\nshould agree, however, that there are rational constraints on\nintentions. The akratic agent, for instance, is a paradigm of\nirrationality, and this means that there is some kind of requirement\nto intend to do what one believes one ought to do (just as there are\nrational norms that are violated when one is afraid of something that\none knows to pose no real danger at all). Our capacity for practical\nreason must involve some capacity to modify our intentions in\naccordance with this requirement, otherwise practical reason will be\npractical only in its subject matter, but not in its issue. \n The connection of practical reason with intentional action raises\nlarge questions about its credentials as a capacity for genuine\nreasoning.  As noted above, intentional action is not mere bodily\nmovement, but reflects a distinctive attitude of the agent’s,\nviz., intention. To be in this kind of mental state is to have\nsettled on a plan which one seeks to realize through one’s\naction. Intention seems in this respect to be strikingly unlike\nbelief.  Propositional attitudes of the latter sort have a\nrepresentational function; they aim to fit the way the world is, so\nthat if one discovers that the world is not how one previously took it\nto be, one will acknowledge pressure to modify one’s belief in the\nrelevant dimension (pressure to which one will respond if one is not\nirrational). With intentions however things seem crucially different\nin this respect (Smith 1987).  The intention to go shopping on\nWednesday, for instance, is not a state that would or should be\nabandoned upon ascertaining or confirming that one has not (yet) gone\nshopping on Wednesday; rather a person with such an intention will\nordinarily try to bring the world into alignment with the intention,\nby going shopping when Wednesday comes around. Intentions are in this\nway more like an architect’s blueprints than like sketches of an\nalready-completed structure (Anscombe 1957; compare Velleman\n1989). \n Reflection on this contrast between belief and intention has led some\nphilosophers to ask whether practical reason might not be something of\na misnomer.  The difficulty, in a nutshell, is to make sense of the\nsuggestion that a genuinely rational process could by itself generate\nstates with the peculiar function of intentions. Reason seems a\ncapacity for cognitive operations, whereas intentions are\ndistinctively noncognitive states, insofar as they do not aim to\nreflect independent facts of the matter about the way things happen to\nbe in the world.  \n Expressivism represents one line of response to this skeptical worry about\npractical reason. Accounts of this kind offer interpretations of the\nnormative and evaluative language that distinctively figures in\npractical reflection. As was seen in section 1, such reflection\naddresses an agent’s reasons for acting in one way or another;\nconclusions about such reasons are characteristically couched in\nevaluative terms, as claims about what it would be good to do,\nor as normative conclusions about the actions that one ought to\nperform. According to the expressivist, however, evaluative and\nnormative claims of these kinds do not represent genuine cognitive\nachievements, judgments that are literally capable of being true or\nfalse.  Rather they give expression to desires, sentiments, plans, and\nother pro-attitudes, the sorts of goal-directed noncognitive state that move\npeople to action. The expressivist contends that we can make sense of\nthe capacity of practical reason to generate states with the peculiar\nstructure and function of intentions only if evaluative and normative\nassertions are understood along these lines. \n Expressivism in this form suggests a naturalistic interpretation of\npractical reason, one that may seem appropriate to the enlightened\ncommitments of the modern scientific world view. It is naturalistic\nmetaphysically, insofar as it makes no commitment to the objective\nexistence in the world of such allegedly questionable entities as\nvalues, norms, or reasons for action. If normative and evaluative\nclaims do not represent genuine cognitive achievements, then their\nlegitimacy does not depend on our postulating a realm of normative or\nevaluative facts to which those claims must be capable of\ncorresponding. It is also naturalistic psychologically, insofar as it\nyields explanations of intentional human behavior that are basically\ncontinuous with explanations of the behavior of non-rational\nanimals. In both the human and the non-human case, behavior is\nunderstood as the causal product of noncognitive attitudes, operating\nin conjunction with a creature’s factual representation of how things\nare in its environment.  The special sophistication of human agency\nmay be traced to the fact that humans have much more sophisticated\nlinguistic methods for giving voice to their motivating noncognitive\nattitudes. Indeed, many contemporary expressivists would contend that\nthese expressive resources are sufficiently powerful that we can\nexplain by means of them the features of practical deliberation that\ninitially give it the appearance of a genuine form of reasoning\n(Blackburn 1998, Gibbard 1990, Gibbard 2003). \n Other philosophers remain unimpressed with this naturalistic approach\nto practical reason. One ground for dissatisfaction with it is the\nfollowing.  The expressivist strategy relies on an initial contrast\nbetween practical reflection on the one hand, and the genuine forms of\ncognitive activity characteristic of theoretical reasoning on the\nother. There has to be some important sense in which practical\ndiscourse does not satisfy the standards of rationality that\ndistinguish authentic cognitive discourse in the literal sense;\notherwise the contention that normative discourse is expressive rather\nthan cognitive will lack any significant content.  But the contrast\nbetween theoretical and practical reflection required for this purpose\nseems elusive. As we saw in section 1 above, theoretical reasoning\nappears to be no less a normative enterprise than practical\nreasoning. It is plausibly understood to concern itself with reasons\nfor belief, the evidence and other considerations that speak for and\nagainst particular conclusions about the way things are in the\nworld. To the extent this is the case, theoretical and practical\nreasoning would both seem equally problematic from the naturalistic\nperspective—assuming, that is, that it leaves no place for\nsuch normative considerations as reasons. But if naturalism calls into\nquestion the credentials of theoretical reason, it thereby undermines\nthe contrast between genuine reasoning and noncognitive forms of\nnormative and evaluative discourse on which expressivists themselves\nrely. \nA different ground for concern about expressionism has to do with the\ndistinction between normative judgment and intention. Expressivism\nmakes sense of the fact that practical reason is practical in its\nissue by collapsing this distinction altogether. Normative reflection\ncan bring about adjustments in our intentions because it just is a set\nof operations on our intentions (or intention-like practical\nstates). Compliance with what we ordinarily think of as a rational\nrequirement, to bring our intentions into alignment with our normative\nbeliefs, is thus secured through a kind of conceptual fiat. The result\nis that there is no room, on this position, for the paradigmatic form\nof irrationality in practice represented by akrasia, whereby\nagents fail to do what they themselves believe they ought to do.  Many of those who reject expressivist accounts would endorse some\nvariety of realism about the subject matter of practical reason. The\nbasic commitment of realism in this domain is the idea that there are\nfacts of the matter about what we have reason to do that are prior to\nand independent of our deliberations, to which those deliberations are\nultimately answerable. Realists picture practical reason as a capacity\nfor reflection about an objective body of normative truths regarding\naction (Skorupski 2010, Parfit 2011, Scanlon 2014). An alternative\napproach—different both from realism and from the kind of\nexpressivism sketched above—is constructivism (Korsgaard 1997,\nStreet 2008, Street 2010). This approach denies that practical reason\nis a capacity for reflection about an objective domain of independent\nnormative facts; but it equally rejects the expressivist’s\nnaturalistic suspicion of normativity.  According to the\nconstructivist, practical reason is governed by genuine normative\nconstraints, but what makes these constraints normative is precisely\ntheir relation to the will of the agents whose decisions they govern.\nThe principles of practical reason are constitutive principles of\nrational agency, binding on us insofar as we necessarily commit\nourselves to complying with them in willing anything at all. The realm\nof the normative, on this approach, is not pictured as a body of\ntruths or facts that are prior to and independent of the will; rather,\nit is taken to be ‘constructed’ by agents through their\nown volitional activity. \n The capacity of practical reason to give rise to intentional action\ndivides even those philosophers who agree in rejecting the\nexpressivist strategy discussed above. Such philosophers are prepared\nto grant that there are normative and evaluative facts and truths, and\nto accept the cognitive credentials of discourse about this\ndistinctive domain of facts and truths.  But they differ in their\naccounts of the truth conditions of the normative and evaluative\nclaims that figure in such discourse. We may distinguish the following\ntwo approaches.  \n The first of these, often referred to as internalism, holds that\nreasons for action must be grounded in an agent’s prior motivations\n(Williams 1981; cf. Finlay 2009).  According to this influential position, a given\nagent s can have reason to do x only if x-ing\nwould speak to or advance some element in s’s ‘subjective\nmotivational set’. There must be some rational connection\nbetween s’s x-ing and the subjective motivations to\nwhich s is actually already subject; otherwise the claim\nthat s has reason to x must be rejected, as false or\nincoherent.  Behind this internalist position lies the idea that\npractical reason is practical in its issue. Internalists contend that\nwe can make sense of the generation of new intentions through\nreasoning only if we assume that such reasoning is conditioned by\nmotivational resources that are already to hand. Practical reason, on\nthe internalist account, is the capacity to work out the implications\nof the commitments contained in one’s existing subjective motivational\nset; the upshot is that motivation is prior to practical reason, and\nconstrains it. \n Externalists reject this picture, contending that one can have\nreasons for action that are independent of one’s prior\nmotivations. They typically agree that practical reasoning is capable\nof generating new motivations and actions. They agree, in other words,\nthat if agent s has reason to do x, it must be possible\nfor s to acquire the motivation to x through reflection\non the relevant reasons. But they deny that such reasoning must in any\nsignificant way be constrained by s’s subjective motivations\nprior to the episode of reasoning.  On this approach, practical reason\nis not conceived merely as a capacity for working out the implications\nof one’s existing desires and commitments; it equally involves the\ncapacity to reason about what it would objectively be good to do, and\nto act on the basis of this kind of evaluative reflection.  Normative\nreflection is thus taken to be independent of one’s prior motivations,\nand capable of opening up new motivational possibilities (Parfit\n1997). \nThis disagreement is conventionally understood to be driven by\ndiverging approaches to the explanation of intentional\naction. Internalists are impressed by the differences between\nintentions and the cognitive states that figure in paradigmatic\nexamples of theoretical reasoning. Pointing to these differences, they\nask how practical reason can succeed in producing new intentions if it\nis not based in something of the same basic psychological type: a\nmotivation or desire that is already part of the agent’s subjective\nmotivational equipment. Many externalists find this contrast between\nintentions and cognitive states overdrawn.  They observe that we need\nto postulate basic dispositions of normative responsiveness to account\nfor the capacity of theoretical reflection about reasons to affect our\nbeliefs, and question why these same dispositions cannot explain the\nfact that practical reasoning is practical in its consequences.\nCognitive or not, intentions belong to the broad class of attitudes\nthat are sensitive to judgments, and this may account for the capacity\nof practical reflection to generate new intentions (Scanlon 1998,\nchap. 1). A third possibility is that intentions result from\ndispositions or capacities distinct from the psychic mechanisms that\nrender theoretical rationality possible. Depending on how it is\ndeveloped, this approach may offer a different way of accounting for\nthe practical consequences of practical reflection, without assuming\nthat reasons for action are grounded in an agent’s subjective\nmotivations (Velleman 2000, chap. 8, Wallace 1999).  More recently, it has been maintained that the Humean approach has\nits basis not in a philosophical account of motivation, but rather in\nour understanding of what explains peoples’ reasons for action\n(Schroeder 2007). There are cases in which features of a person’s\npsychology make an obvious difference to what the person has reason to\ndo. Some people like to dance, others detest this activity, and this\ndifference in their “desires” appears to determine a corresponding\ndifference in their reasons. Even in cases of this kind, however, it\nis far from obvious that differences in the agent’s “desires” are what\nultimately explain their differing reasons (Scanlon 2014). Moreover,\nthe fact that psychological factors might sometimes be relevant to the\nexplanation of a person’s reasons does not entail that they always\nhave explanatory relevance. \n Among the substantive norms of practical reason, those of\ninstrumental rationality have seemed least controversial to\nphilosophers.  Instrumental rationality, in its most basic form,\ninstructs agents to take those means that are necessary in relation to\ntheir given ends.  In the modern era, this form of rationality has\nwidely been viewed as the single unproblematic requirement of\npractical reason. The instrumental principle makes no assumptions\nabout the prospects for rational scrutiny of peoples’ ends.  Rational\ncriticism of this kind apparently presupposes that there are objective\nreasons and values, providing standards for assessment of ends that\nare independent from psychological facts about what people happen to\nbe motivated to pursue. In line with the naturalistic attitude\nsketched in section 2, however, it may be doubted whether such\nindependent standards can be reconciled with the metaphysical\ncommitments of contemporary scientific practice. A world that is shorn\nof objective values or norms leaves no room for rational criticism of\npeoples’ ends, but only for Weberian Zweckrationalität:\nthe rational determination of means to the realization of ends that\nare taken to be given, as a matter of human psychological fact. \n This line of thought can be traced back to the philosophy of David\nHume, who famously asserted that ‘Reason is, and ought only to\nbe the slave of the passions’ (Hume 1978, 415). Those attracted\nto the Humean approach should bear in mind, however, that instrumental\nrationality is itself the expression of an objective normative\ncommitment. The instrumental principle says that we are rationally\nrequired to take the means that are necessary to achieve our ends;\nif the principle represents a binding norm of practical reason, then\nwe are open to rational criticism to the extent we fail to exhibit\nthis kind of instrumental consistency, regardless of whether we want\nto comply with the principle or not.  If naturalism really entails\nthat there can be no objective norms or values, it may be wondered how\nan exception can possibly be made for the instrumental requirement. A\nmore consistently naturalistic position would be to reject even\nZweckrationalität in favor of a skeptical attitude towards\npractical reason in all its forms (Hampton 1998)—an attitude\nthat may well correspond to the intentions of the historical Hume\n(compare Dreier 1997, Millgram 1995).  Further questions can be raised\nabout the plausibility of the suggestion that the instrumental norm\nexhausts the requirements of practical reason. The norm says that one\nshould take the means that are necessary relative to one’s\npsychologically-given ends. But how can the fact that a given means\nexhibits this kind of necessity give a person reason to choose the\nmeans, if the end is not itself something it would be valuable to\nachieve in some way? The instrumental principle seems to function as a\nbinding norm of practical reason only if it is taken for granted that\nthere are additional, independent standards for the assessment of our\nends (Korsgaard 1997; Quinn 1993). \n\nMany proponents of the instrumental principle would agree that it does\nnot generate reasons for action. The fact that a given means is\nnecessary, relative to one’s given ends, is not a reason to take the\nmeans. The instrumental principle functions, rather, as a structural\nrequirement on one’s attitudes (Broome 1999, Broome 2004). Thus,\nsuppose one intends end E, and believes (truly) that E can be achieved\nonly if one intends to do M. It appears that there are two ways in\nwhich one could revise one’s attitudes in response to these\nconsiderations, compatibly with the instrumental principle: one could\nform the intention to M, or one could abandon one’s original intention\nto E. The instrumental principle, considered in itself, is indifferent\nas between these two possibilities; it should be understood as a\nwide-scope requirement, governing combinations of attitudes, rather\nthan a source of detachable normative conclusions about what one has\nreason to do. (Modus ponens represents a similar rational requirement\nin the domain of theoretical reason, governing combinations of\nbeliefs.) \n\nRational requirements of this kind have recently become a subject of\nlively philosophical debate. The idea that there are structural\nrequirements on our attitudes appears to be common ground among\nphilosophers who differ significantly in their views about the nature\nand scope of practical reason. It is accepted by most Humeans, for\ninstance, who believe that there is no scope for the rational\ncriticism of individual ends, and also by Kantians, who think that the\nrequirements of reason ultimately constrain us to choose in accordance\nwith the moral law. From the perspective of practical and theoretical\ndeliberation, we commonly grant the force of these structural\nrequirements, acknowledging a kind of rational pressure to bring our\nbeliefs and intentions into compliance with the instrumental principle\nand other standards of consistency and coherence. \n\nMany philosophers take such structural requirements at face value,\ngranting that practical reason is rightly governed by and responsive\nto these wide-scope demands. Indeed, it has influentially been argued\nthat standards of good reasoning, in both the practical and the\ntheoretical domain, derive exclusively from structural requirements of\nrationality of this kind (Broome 2013). But questions arise about this\napproach. For one thing, reasoning has a kind of directionality that\nis hard to make sense of solely in terms of the ideal of compliance\nwith wide-scope requirements. Thus it isn’t good reasoning to\ngive up the intention to achieve end E solely because one lacks the\nintention to take the necessary means M, even though, as we have seen,\nrevising one’s attitudes in this way brings about compliance\nwith the wide-scope requirement. \n\nHow, more generally, should we understand the relation between\nstructural requirements and our reasons for action and\nbelief? One view, held in common by Humeans and by some Kantian\nconstructivists (see sec. 2 above), is that reasons are fundamentally\nderivative from rational requirements. What one has reason to do, on\nthis view, is what one would desire or intend to do if one was fully\nrational (i.e. fully in compliance with the wide-scope structural\nrequirements that govern one’s attitudes in combination). \n\nFor those who do not share this reductionist view, however, the status\nof rational requirements becomes more puzzling. One might hold that\npractical reason is ultimately answerable to two different kinds of\nconstraints: to rational requirements on the one hand, and to\nindependent facts about what one has reason to do on the other\nhand. But this position is potentially unstable. Once the independence\nof structural requirements from normative reasons is made clear, it is\nno longer obvious why we should care about whether our attitudes do or\ndo not comply with the structural requirements. On this view, there is\nnothing wrong with failing to take the necessary means to your end,\nunless the end itself is one that you have compelling reason to pursue\n(Raz 2005). More generally, it has been argued that there are no\nindependent requirements of structural rationality at all, and that\nthe appearance of such requirements within the deliberative point of\nview can be explained by substantive features of the reasons to which\nboth practical and theoretical reason are ultimately and properly\nresponsive (Kolodny 2005). \n\nHumean proponents of structural approaches to practical reason have\nattempted to accommodate the rational criticism of individual ends,\nwithout departing from the spirit of\nZweckrationalität, by expanding their view to encompass\nthe totality of an agent’s ends. Thus, even if there are no\nreasons or values that are ultimately independent of an agent’s\ngiven ends, the possibility remains that we could criticize particular\nintrinsic desires by reference to others in an agent’s\nsubjective motivational set. An agent’s desire for leisure, for\ninstance, might be subordinated insofar as its satisfaction would\nfrustrate the realization of other goals that are subjectively more\nimportant to the agent, such as professional success. Practical\nreason, it might be suggested, is a holistic enterprise, properly\nconcerned not merely with identifying means to the realization of\nindividual ends, but with the coordinated achievement of the totality\nof an agent’s ends. \n\nMany philosophers take this holistic approach to be the most promising\nway of thinking about the tasks of practical reason. It defines an\nimportant and difficult problem for practical reason to address,\nwithout departing from the metaphysically modest assumption that there\nis no court of appeal for the rational criticism of an agent’s ends\nthat is independent of those ends themselves. The holistic approach\nfinds its most sophisticated and influential expression in the\nmaximizing conception of practical rationality. According to the\nmaximizing conception, the fundamental task of practical reason is to\ndetermine which course of action would optimally advance the agent’s\ncomplete set of ends. Thus it is widely accepted that the rational\naction for a given agent to take is the one whose subjective expected\nutility—reflecting both the utility of possible outcomes, from\nthe agent’s point of view, and the agent’s beliefs about the\nprobability of those outcomes—is the highest.  \n\nThe maximizing conception of practical rationality has been\ninfluentially developed in decision theory and in the theory of\nrational choice (as studied, for instance, in modern economics). These\ndisciplines articulate with mathematical precision the basic idea that\npractical rationality is a matter of consistency in action: people act\nrationally to the extent they do what is likely to bring about the\nbest state of affairs, given both their preferences over the outcomes\nthat may be brought about through their agency and their beliefs about\nthe probability of those outcomes. Proponents of these theories\nsometimes claim for them the additional advantage of empirical\nadequacy, arguing that they are flexible enough to accommodate the\nfull range of behaviors that human agents engage in, both within the\nmarketplace and outside of it.  Especially if one operates with the\nnotion of ‘revealed preferences’—preferences, that\nis, that are ascribed to agents solely on the basis of actual\nbehavior—then virtually anything an agent might choose to do\ncould be interpreted as an attempt to maximize expected\nutility. Decision theory, on the resulting interpretation of it,\nbecomes an all-encompassing framework for understanding free human\nbehavior, according to which all agents who act freely are striving to\nproduce outcomes that would be optimal, relative to their current\npreferences and beliefs. \n\nIf decision theory is interpreted in this way, however, then its\nrelevance to the understanding of practical reason may appear\ncorrespondingly tenuous (compare Pettit and Smith 1997). The\nmaximization of subjective utility is supposed to represent a\nnormative ideal, one by appeal to which we can assess critically the\ndeliberations of agents. In this guise, the attraction of the\nmaximizing model lies in the idea that there can be rational\nrequirements on action, stemming from the totality of an agent’s\npreferences and beliefs, even if we do not assume that there are\nindependent, substantive standards for the critical assessment of\nindividual ends. But this normative interpretation of maximizing\nrationality is tenable only if it is at least conceivable that\nindividual agents might sometimes fail to satisfy its\nrequirements—an‘ought’that it is not so much as\npossible to flout is not really an ‘ought’ at all (Lavin\n2004). Thus the axioms of decision theory include constraints on an\nagent’s overall preferences (such as completeness and transitivity)\nthat might be violated even by agents who are striving to satisfy\ntheir currently strongest desires. Such agents will be criticizable by\nthe lights of decision theory insofar there is no consistent utility\nfunction that can be ascribed to them on the basis of their actual\nchoices and behavior. The normative credentials of decision theory\nrest, then, on the plausibility of the axioms that are taken to define\nan individual utility function—axioms that may not be quite as\ninnocent or uncontroversial as they appear (compare Mandler 2001). \n\nFurther questions arise about the plausibility of the normative\nrequirement to maximize expected utility. Doubts have been expressed,\nfor instance, in regard to the assumption that it is necessarily\nirrational to fail to select that action that would be optimal,\nrelative to one’s preferences and beliefs.  Perfectly rational\nagents often appear to be content with states of affairs that are\n‘good enough’, from the perspective of their aims and\ndesires, even when they know that alternatives are available that\npromise a higher return; they ‘satisfice’, rather than\nseeking to maximize the value of the outcomes achievable through their\nactions (Slote 1989). They also treat their past intentions and plans\nas defeasibly fixed constraints on deliberation, rather than\nattempting to maximize subjective utility anew in every situation they\nconfront (Bratman 1987). Finally, they can adopt different attitudes\ntoward risk, attaching greater importance to avoiding bad outcomes\nthan to maximizing expected utility, as classically conceived (Buchak\n2013). Defenders of the maximizing model contend that it is flexible\nenough to accommodate alleged counterexamples of these kinds (Pettit\n1984). If not, however, there may be grounds for doubting that it\nrepresents a basic norm or practical reason. \n\nA different issue about maximizing rationality concerns the set of\ndesires or aims that is taken as fixed for purposes of applying the\nrequirement of maximization. We may distinguish two basic\napproaches. The first and perhaps most common of these takes the\nsubjective utility of alternative actions to be determined by the\nagent’s preferences at the time of deliberation. According to this\ninterpretation of the maximization model, we are rational to the\nextent we do that which best promotes the totality of our present\naims. A second and quite different interpretation results if we expand\nthe set of desires that determine the subjective utilities of outcomes\nto include the totality of the agent’s preferences over\ntime. According to this model, rational agents aim to maximize the\nsatisfaction of all of their anticipated desires, accepting\nfrustration of present preferences for the sake of greater\nsatisfaction at later times. This interpretation of the maximizing\nmodel gives expression to the common idea that a certain prudential\nregard for one’s own future well-being is a requirement of practical\nreason (Nagel 1978, chaps 5–8). But if we take it to be a\ncomprehensive account of rationality in action, the prudential\ninterpretation can also appear to be an unstable compromise: if\npractical reason demands of us impartiality as between our present and\nfuture desires, should it not equally demand impartial consideration\nof the desires of other agents who may be affected by what we do? Why\nshould we take the distinction between persons to be significant for\nthe theory of practical reason, once we have denied such significance\nto the distinction between different times in the life of a single\nagent (Parfit 1984; compare section 5 below)? \n\nHowever we define the class of desires that is subject to the\nrequirement of maximization, we do not need to take those desires\nexactly as they are given. Many proponents of the maximizing approach\nsuggest that an agent’s actual desires should be laundered somewhat\nbefore the demand to maximize is applied. For instance, if my desire\nfor X is contingent on a false factual belief about the nature\nof X, then it is not obvious that practical reason requires\nthat the desire be taken into account in determining what it is\nrational for me to do. A popular form of laundering would rule out\ndesires of this kind, by subjecting to the requirement of maximization\nonly those desires that would survive if the agent were factually\nwell-informed about the objects of desire and the circumstances of\naction, and deliberating in a calm and focused frame of mind. Indeed,\nonce we are in the business of laundering desires we can go still\nfurther, excluding from consideration desires that are substantively\nobjectionable, even if they would survive the filter of corrected\nfactual belief. To move into this territory, however, would clearly be\nto abandon the Humean framework of the original maximizing approach,\nassuming resources for the rational criticism of ends that are\nindependent of the agent’s actual dispositions.  \n Some philosophers respond to the cases that invite desire-laundering\nby distinguishing between subjective and objective dimensions of\npractical reason. Our corrected desires, such philosophers maintain,\nare relevant to determining what it would be objectively rational for\nus to do, or what we objectively have reason to do. But we are often\nnot in a position to grasp that our factual beliefs are false. When\nthis is the case, we can hardly be faulted for failing to do what we\nobjectively have most reason to do. In situations of this kind, it may\nbe subjectively rational for us to strive to satisfy our actual\ndesires, even if some of those desires would not survive correction of\nour mistaken but blameless factual beliefs.  \n If maximizing rationality is not the unproblematic requirement of\npractical reason that it initially seemed to be, what are the\nalternatives to it? Let us begin with the assumption that critical\nassessment of an agent’s individual ends is off-limits. This apparent\ntruism has been questioned by some philosophers, who point out that\nmany of our basic aims in life are rather inchoate; people want, for\ninstance, to be successful in their careers, and loyal to their\nfriends, without being clear about what exactly these ends require of\nthem.  To the extent one’s ends are indeterminate in this way, they\nwill not provide effective starting points for instrumental,\nmaximizing, or even satisficing reflection. We need to specify such\nends more precisely before we can begin to think about which means\nthey require us to pursue, or to generate from them a rank-ordering of\npossible outcomes. Here is a possible task for practical reason that\ndoes not fit neatly into the categories of instrumental or maximizing\nreflection, however broadly construed (Kolnai 2001,Wiggins 1987,\nRichardson 1994). \n Practical deliberation about ends is not an easy or well-defined\nactivity.  There are no straightforward criteria for success in this\nkind of reflection, and it is often unclear when it has been brought\nto a satisfactory conclusion.  These considerations encourage the\nHumean assumption—especially widespread in the social\nsciences—that there is no reasoning about final ends. On the\nother hand, how is one supposed to clarify one’s largest and most\nimportant ends, if not by reasoning about them in some way? Rather\nthan exclude such reflection because it does not conform to a narrowly\nscientific paradigm of reason, perhaps we should expand our conception\nof practical reason to make room for clarificatory reflection about\nthe ends of action. To do so would be to acknowledge that practical\nreason has an essentially heuristic dimension, one that is connected\nto the project of self-understanding. By working out the meaning and\nimplications of such antecedent commitments as loyalty or success, for\ninstance, we also help to get clear the values that define who we\nreally are (Taylor 1985). \n Humean models of practical reason rest on a basically\nconsequentialist account of the relation of action to value. According\nto this account, value inheres ultimately in states of affairs,\ninsofar as it is these that are the objects of subjective preference\nrankings. Actions are then judged rational to the extent they bring\nabout states of affairs that are valuable in this way. It is a matter\nof controversy, however, whether this is the most plausible way of\nthinking about the rationality of action. Defenders of satisficing\nmodels, for example, think that a given action can be rational even\nwhen it is acknowledged by the agent that an alternative action would\nbring about a more valuable state of affairs. Alternatively, it might\nbe maintained that we can judge an action rational without being able\nto arrive at any clear independent ranking of the state of affairs\nproduced by it, as better or worse than the alternatives. Perhaps our\njudgments of the value of actions are ultimately parasitic on our\nconvictions about the what there is reason to do or to admire; in that\ncase, we will not be able to derive conclusions about reasons from\nantecedent premises in the theory of value (Scanlon 1998,\nchap. 2). Related questions have been raised about the basic\nconsequentialist assumption that value attaches in the first instance\nto states of affairs. Thus it may seem to distort our understanding of\nfriendship, for instance, to maintain that what friends value\nfundamentally are states of affairs (involving, say, joint activities\nwith the friend); what people value as friends are rather concrete\nparticulars or relations, such as the persons with whom they are\nbefriended or their relationships with those persons. Building on this\nidea in the theory of value, it has been proposed that actions are\nrational insofar as they succeed in expressing the attitudes that it\nis rational to adopt toward the true bearers of intrinsic value:\npeople, animals, and things (Anderson 1993). \nA supposed advantage of this approach is its ability to explain the\nrationality of behaviors that seem intuitively sensible, but that are\nhard to fit into the consequentialist scheme (such as commitments\nderiving from one’s past involvement in an activity or project,\nwhich can look like an irrational weighting of ‘sunk\ncosts’ to the consequentialist; compare Nozick 1993). But\ndefenders of the consequentialist model contend that we can account in\nterms of it for rational actions that appear to resist treatment in\nconsequentialist terms. For instance, if friends have special,\n‘agent-relative’ reasons to attend to the interests of\neach other—and not merely reasons to promote the neutral value\nof friendship wherever it may be instantiated—this can be\nexpressed in consequentialist terms by introducing person-indexed\nvalue functions, which rank possible states of affairs in terms of\ntheir desirability from the agent’s point of view (Sen\n2000). \nWhether or not we accept a consequentialist framework, questions in\nthe theory of value would seem to be an important focus for practical\nreflection.  Many philosophers are attracted to the idea that reasons\nfor action are ultimately provided by the values that can be realized\nthrough action (Raz 1999). If this is right, and if we assume as well\na realist or at least non-subjectivist conception of value, then a\ndifferent way of thinking about the task of practical reason comes\ninto view. This may be thought of not primarily as a matter of\nmaximizing the satisfaction of the agent’s given ends, nor of\nspecifying ends that are still inchoate, but rather as the task of\nmapping the landscape of value. This task in turn admits of a number\nof different interpretations.  In the spirit of G. E. Moore, we might\nunderstand the evaluative reflection relevant to deliberation in\nconsequentialist terms, as reflection about a non-natural property of\ngoodness that is instantiated by states of the world; but this is not\na very popular approach today. An influential alternative to it,\ninspired by Aristotle, holds that the proper focus of practical\nreflection is the question of what it would be to act well (Lawrence\n1995, Foot 2001).  According to this view, the values that are\nrelevant to determining what an agent ought to do are those that are\nspecifically connected to human agency, specifying what it would be to\nbe good (or at least non-defective) as a human agent (Thompson 2008,\nThomson 2008).  Those attracted to pluralistic conceptions of the good\ntake a more expansive view, suggesting that any concrete dimension of\nvalue that might be affected by action falls within the purview of\npractical deliberation (Raz 1999, Raz 2011).  \n\n Morality has provided an especially fertile source of examples and\nproblems for the theory of practical reason. A defining question of\nmoral philosophy is the question of the rational authority of moral\nnorms: to what extent, and under what conditions, do people have\ncompelling reasons to comply with the demands of conventional\nmorality? (Alternatively: to what extent, and under what conditions,\nare people rationally required to comply with those demands?)\nReflection on this question has produced some of the most significant\nand illuminating philosophical work in the theory of practical\nreason. Two divergent tendencies within this body of work can be\nsingled out. Some accounts of moral reasoning proceed by relating it\nto patterns of reflection appropriate to other, non-moral domains,\nparticularly the maximizing patterns canvassed in the section 5. Thus\nit has been argued that, though morality imposes constraints on the\ndirect pursuit of individual utility, these constraints can be\njustified in the terms of ordinary economic rationality; the strategy\nof morally-constrained maximization is recommended on grounds of\nenlightened self-interest, and this in turn accounts for the authority\nof moral considerations to govern the practical reflection of\nindividuals (Gauthier 1986). Other philosophers have tried to make\nsense of morality as a set of rational norms by assimilating it more\ndirectly to the maximizing conception. Consider utilitarianism and\nother consequentialist approaches to the normative structure of\nmorality, which interpret moral rightness in terms of the value of the\nconsequences (of actions, policies, institutions, or other objects of\nmoral assessment). These theories derive at least some of their appeal\nfrom the fact that they apply to the moral domain the maximizing model\nof rationality that seems both familiar and appealing outside of moral\ncontexts. Thus one way to argue for ethical consequentialism is to\nobserve that it is the theory that results when we combine the\nrequirement of maximization with a distinctively moral constraint of\nimpartiality, applying the requirement to a set of preferences that\nincludes those of all the persons (or other sentient creatures)\npotentially affected by our actions (Harsanyi 1982). \nOpponents of this kind of ethical consequentialism stress the\ndiscontinuities between moral and non-moral patterns of\nreasoning. They argue that morality is a source of demands (such as\nprohibitions on murder and deception) that cannot be represented\naccurately within the framework of maximizing rationality (for\nexample, Scanlon 1998, chap. 5). If this is correct, then we will be\nable to make sense of moral requirements, as norms that appropriately\ngovern the reflections of individual agents, only if we expand our\nconception of the forms and possibilities of practical reason. \nThere are two connected features of moral norms that seem particularly\nsignificant in this connection. First, they are intuitively understood\nto represent agent-relative reasons for action (Nagel 1978). Thus, if\nI have promised that I will take you to the airport tomorrow\nafternoon, this consideration has a significance for me that it does\nnot necessarily have for other agents. In particular, the importance\nto me of keeping my promise seems to be independent from the\nimpersonal end of promissory fidelity. This shows itself in the fact\nthat my reason to keep the promise I have made would be unaffected if\nI found myself in a scenario in which breaking my promise would lead\nfive other agents to keep promises they would otherwise have\nflouted. Second, these agent-relative considerations have a\ndistinctive function within practical deliberation. They are not\nmerely considerations that speak in favor of the actions they\nrecommend, but operate rather as practical requirements that\npresumptively constrain the agent’s activities. The fact that I\nhave promised to take you to the airport tomorrow, for instance, is\nordinarily a decisive basis for concluding that that is to be done. I\ndo not need to weigh this consideration against other values that\nmight be pursued under the circumstances; rather, the promissory\ncommitment enters the deliberative field from the start in the deontic\nguise of an obligation.\n \nThere are divergent approaches that have been taken within ethical\ntheory for making sense of these salient features of moral\nreason. Kantians for instance, take rational agents to impose the\nmoral law on themselves when they act, where the law in question\nfunctions as a limiting condition on their pursuit of their ends\n(Korsgaard 1996b, O’Neill 1989). Proponents of virtue theory\ntake it that compliance with some agent-centered requirements is\npartly constitutive of being a good human being (Foot 2001). A still\ndifferent class of approaches understands moral norms in essentially\ninterpersonal terms: either as demands that are imposed by agents on\neach other (Darwall 2009), or as relational requirements that define\nwhat we owe to each other, and that make possible relations of\nmutual recognition or regard (Scanlon 1998, Wallace 2019). These are\nvery disparate ways of conceptualizing morality as a sui genesis\ndomain of agent-centered obligations. They have in common, however, a\ncommitment to the idea that reflection on the nature of morality can\nbring to light structures of practical reason that would not otherwise\nbe salient.","contact.mail":"rjw@berkeley.edu","contact.domain":"berkeley.edu"}]
