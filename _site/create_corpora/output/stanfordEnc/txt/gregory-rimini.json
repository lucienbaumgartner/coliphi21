He was the first thinker to incorporate\nsubstantially the developments of both the post-Ockham tradition at\nOxford and the post-Auriol tradition at Paris, and his original\nsynthesis had a long-lasting impact on European thought.  \n\n\n\nBiographical information for much of the life of Gregory of Rimini\n(a.k.a. de Arimino, Ariminensis, the “Torturer of Infants,” the\nLucerna splendens, and the Doctor acutus or\nauthenticus) derives from a letter of Pope Clement VI, dated\n12 January 1345, requesting Gregory's promotion to Master of Theology\nat the University of Paris: According to the letter, then,\nGregory first studied theology at Paris from 1322 or 1323 until 1328\nor 1329. Working backwards, we can estimate that Gregory was born in\nRimini around 1300, joined the mendicant order of the Hermits of Saint\nAugustine (OESA), and received his basic education before going to\nParis. There he was exposed to the latest developments in\nphilosophical theology, especially the ideas of the Franciscan Peter\nAuriol, who had died in early 1322. Assuming that the sequence in the\npapal letter is strictly chronological, Gregory then taught theology\nat various Augustinian studia in Italy, first at Bologna,\nwhere he is attested as lector in documents of late 1332,\n1333, and early 1337. Perhaps he was transferred to Padua at the\nAugustinians' General Chapter meeting in Siena in 1338, and then he\nwas shifted to Perugia. Almost certainly while he was in Italy,\nGregory came into contact with the works of Oxford scholars from the\n1320s and 1330s, most notably William of Ockham, Adam Wodeham, Richard\nFitzralph, and Walter Chatton. Pope Clement's letter suggests that\nGregory returned to Paris in late 1340 or in 1341 in order to lecture\non the Sentences, but perhaps the “four years” refers to the\ndate of his order's General Chapter of Montpellier, 1341, which may\nhave been the occasion when Gregory was assigned to return to\nParis. The prevailing view is that Gregory went to Paris in 1342 for a\nyear of preparation for his lectures on the Sentences, which\nwere given in 1343–44, but given that our records of these lectures\nwere subject to revision, there is a degree of uncertainty. With help\nfrom the pope's letter, Gregory probably became Master of Theology in\n1345, holding at least one quodlibetal disputation at Paris, but he\ncontinued to revise his written Sentences commentary until\n1346, removing certain passages that were formerly considered later\nadditiones. In late 1346 Master Gregory was in Rimini and the\nfollowing year we find him teaching again in Padua, where he stayed\nuntil 1351 when the General Chapter at Basel sent him to teach at the\nrecently established studium in Rimini. He remained there at\nleast until late 1356, but on 20 May 1357, at the General Chapter in\nMontpellier, he was elected the Augustinians' prior general,\nsucceeding the late Thomas of Strasbourg. Gregory died in Vienna\ntoward the end of 1358 (see V.  Marcolino's chapter in Oberman 1981,\n127–94; Lambertini et al. 2002; Delucca 2003). \n\nGregory's most important writing by far is his commentary on the first\ntwo books of the Sentences. Book I survives in some twenty\ncomplete manuscripts, while there are about a dozen for book II.  The\nwork was printed several times from 1482 to 1532, reprinted in 1955,\nand finally received a modern critical edition in six volumes in\n1979–84 (Rimini 1979–84; Bermon 2002). Parts have been or are being\ntranslated into French, German, and English. In addition to scriptural\ncommentaries, Gregory was also responsible for smaller writings,\nincluding a work usually known as De usura, printed in 1508\nand again in 1622 (see below, section 6). His tract on the intension\nand remission of forms, De intensione et remissione formarum\ncorporalium, carries the incipit “Circa secundum partem huius\ndistinctionis” and is, therefore, just an excerpt of the\nSentences commentary, book I, distinction 17, part\n2. Finally, from his brief term as his order's prior general we have\nhis correspondence, which has been published (Rimini 1976). \n\nAlthough Gregory of Rimini has received considerable attention from\nhistorians of medieval thought, understanding his position in the\nhistory of philosophy has been made difficult by several problems that\nhave plagued the historiography of fourteenth-century\nscholasticism. He flourished at a time that has been judged by\nhistorians as on the whole decadent, fideistic, and radically\nskeptical, in contrast to the period in which, for example, Thomas\nAquinas worked (d. 1274); this historical viewpoint already made\ndifficult an objective evaluation of Rimini.  Historians also labeled\nGregory a “nominalist,” a term so broad and vague when applied to\nfourteenth-century thinkers that, when it was used without\nqualification, it tended to mislead and to obscure the differences\namong them, as for example between Ockham and Gregory.  Finally,\nunlike Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, and John Duns Scotus, Gregory was\nactive in a relatively understudied period, so that placing Gregory in\nhis context is difficult and statements about Gregory's originality\nare precarious. The history of Gregory's own University of Paris in\nthe quarter century before his Sentences lectures, in\ncontrast to that of Oxford in the same years, is particularly\nunclear. Few scholars realize, moreover, that from the 1330s until the\nonset of the Great Schism in 1378, decades when the traditional\nleaders of European thought, the Franciscans and Dominicans, were in\ndecline, Gregory was the leading light in an era in which his own\nAugustinian Order dominated, with such towering figures as Thomas of\nStrasbourg, Alphonsus Vargas of Toledo, and Hugolino of Orvieto, and a\nnumber of other important authors.  Only careful diachronic studies of\nspecific philosophical problems can provide a precise picture of\nGregory's role in the history of philosophy, and few such studies have\nbeen accomplished thus far. There are some, however, and epistemology,\nforeknowledge, and predestination are examples of topics about which\nwe know quite a bit (see below). \n\nGenerally, what has been learned so far is that Gregory was really\nthe first to introduce to the University of Paris the exciting ideas\ndeveloped at English schools between William of Ockham (ca. 1319) and\nThomas Bradwardine (ca. 1344). Beginning with Gregory the names of Adam\nWodeham, Richard Fitzralph, Walter Chatton, William Heytesbury, Thomas\nBuckingham, Richard Kilvington, Robert Halifax and others became common\nknowledge among Parisian scholars. Gregory was also deeply influenced\nby recent thinkers at his own university, both negatively and\npositively. The impact of Peter Auriol has long been recognized to be\ngreat, but recent studies have made clear that other figures, such as\nFrancis of Marchia, Thomas of Strasbourg, Gerard Odonis, and Michael of\nMassa, had an influence on Gregory. The question of Gregory's\nrelationship to his Parisian predecessors needs to be investigated more\nfully. \n\nMore clear is Gregory's importance in the late Middle Ages and\nReformation, even if much of this period has received relatively\nlittle attention. Gregory's impact is obvious, because many\nscholastics after 1350 copied large passages from his works, including\nsuch prominent figures as the Cistercian James of Eltville, Pierre\nd'Ailly, and Henry of Langenstein. Other important thinkers, such as\nHugolino of Orvieto OESA, the Cistercian Pierre Ceffons, Marsilius of\nInghen, and Peter of Candia OFM (Pope Alexander V) knew Gregory's\nideas well and cited them often. Few if any philosophers in the later\nfourteenth century can have been unaffected by his ideas, and for many\nhe was their main inspiration. Gregory's impact both inside and\noutside the Augustinian Order continued into the fifteenth\ncentury. The common Sentences commentary (the so-called\nQuaestiones communes) of the University of Vienna in the\nfirst half of the century was largely based directly or indirectly on\nGregory's thought, often duplicating his words. In the celebrated\nquarrel over future contingents at the University of Louvain\n(1465–1474), several of the participants cited Gregory's position or\neven adopted it without attribution. Of course, the fact that only\nbooks I and II of Gregory's commentary circulated means that Gregory's\ndirect impact is to be found in topics discussed in those books rather\nthan in issues covered in books III and IV, such as the Immaculate\nConception and the Eucharist, which had their own philosophical\nsub-issues. \n\nPerhaps the most central element of Gregory of Rimini's thought and\ninfluence is his adherence to Augustine and the nature of that\nadherence. For one thing, Gregory simply read Augustine more carefully\nand extensively than most previous thinkers, and so, for example,\nGregory was able to attack Peter Auriol for his faulty citations and\nquotations of Augustine. Gregory's interest in the works of Augustine\nhas been seen as central to the development of a “historico-critical”\nmethod in philosophical theology, especially in the Augustinian Order,\npartly foreshadowing modern scholarly methods. In connection with this\nhistorico-critical method, Gregory was part of a general attempt to\nestablish reliable texts of Augustine and to separate authentic works\nfrom the pseudo-Augustinian corpus. Quotations from Augustine,\nmoreover, were cited with great accuracy and detail in Gregory's\nwritings, and so his Sentences commentary, when not\nplagiarized for his own ideas, was often used as a source for\nAugustinian quotations (Trapp 1956). \n\nNot surprisingly, Gregory's ideas are often Augustinian. Gregory's\nbrand of doctrinal Augustinianism, influenced rather by the Franciscan\nand Oxonian tradition than the more Dominican (and Parisian) variety\nof Giles of Rome, soon dominated the Augustinian Hermits' philosophy\nand theology. Thus by the early 16th century Aegidistae and\nGregoriistae schools of thought existed, and a recognized\nvia Gregorii was present in many universities such as\nWittenberg, the university of Gregory's fellow Augustinian Hermit\nMartin Luther (McGrath 1987). The fact that Gregory's extreme\nAugustinian views on predestination became virtually official doctrine\nat the University of Vienna, and each book of his Sentences\ncommentary was printed six times between 1482 and 1532, further helps\nexplain why some of Gregory's ideas often resemble those of Luther and\nJean Calvin. Gregory's thought had a life after the reformation,\nperhaps influencing Francisco Suarez, but certainly having an impact\non seventeenth-century debates over such topics as predestination. \n\nA list of Gregory's philosophical positions would perhaps not be\ndifficult to make, and neither would it be hard to describe his\nrelation to Ockham on various topics (e.g. Smith 1999). In natural\nphilosophy, for example, in agreement with Ockham, Gregory was a\nnominalist and employed “Ockham's” razor in denying that sudden\nchange, motion, and time are independent entities (Brown 1998b).\nGregory also claims that the world could have been eternal, and that\nan actual infinite is possible (Maier 1949). But in these cases one\nwould like to know better the stances of Gregory's immediate\npredecessors, especially Parisians like Francis of Marchia, in order\nto determine the possible sources and degree of originality of\nGregory's ideas. (On the eternity of the world, for example, Gregory's\nview was not very strange in his day.)  Otherwise, a list of Gregory's\nideas is just that, a mere list.  Consequently the focus here shall be\non a few of the issues on which the theories of Gregory and his\npredecessors have been investigated in some depth. \n\nIn many ways Gregory was a philosopher's theologian, because he\nbegan with propositions from Scripture as premises for his arguments\nand proceeded deductively. In his deductive theology, Gregory devoted\nmuch time and space to defining his terms and exploring exhaustively\nthe implications of possible solutions, a practice that makes his\nSentences commentary a joy to read and a philosophical\nclassic. In distinctions 38–41 of book I, Gregory tackled the general\nproblem of divine foreknowledge and future contingents and the specific\ndilemma of predestination and free will. Gregory's positions on these\nquestions have already been the subject of study for many decades, and\nrecently historians have attempted to put Gregory into his immediate\nParisian and Oxonian context. Moreover, Gregory's nickname, “the\nTorturer of Infants,” stems in part from his stance on predestination.\nA discussion of Gregory's thought on these issues, therefore, provides\na convenient introduction both to his noetic and to his position in\nhistory. \n\nGregory's treatment of divine foreknowledge and future contingents is\naimed primarily at Peter Auriol and secondarily at Oxford theologians\n(Vignaux 1934, ch. 4; Hoenen 1993, 196–214; Schabel 2000, 264–274;\nFiorentino 2004; Ciammetti 2011). In order to preserve the contingency\nof events stemming from human free will, Auriol claimed that\npropositions about future contingents are neither true nor false, but\nrather neutral, and so God does not know that the Antichrist will\nexist, since “the Antichrist will exist” is neither true nor\nfalse. Although like Ockham and Rimini later, Auriol maintained that\nexactly how God knows the future is incomprehensible to us, he did\ngive a sophisticated explanation and defense of God's knowledge of our\nfuture. Gregory, however, chose to focus on the above-mentioned\nelements in Auriol's position. Gregory recognized that Auriol's theory\nof future-contingent propositions relies on Aristotle's stance in\nchapter 9 of On Interpretation. Interestingly, although\nGregory denied the truth of the position itself, he nevertheless held\nthat it was in fact Aristotle's. Indeed he rejected any attempt to\ninterpret Aristotle differently, in the way that many medieval and\nmodern philosophers have tried to do: \n\nSo for Gregory, Auriol was correct that Aristotle denied the\nPrinciple of Bivalence when applied to propositions about future\ncontingents. \n\nAuriol set up two basic rules for such propositions: (1) if a\nproposition about the future, say, “Socrates will run,” is true, it is\ntrue immutably and inevitably, since no instant can be found when it\nwould be false. (2) The significate of such a proposition will\ninevitably and necessarily be put into being. The foundation for\nAuriol's claim is his modal theory: immutability and necessity are the\nsame thing. If something is immutable, it cannot be different from what\nit is, and so it necessarily is the way it is. \n\nGregory answered with a rigorous and lengthy defense of Bivalence\nand an alternative modal theory. His defense of Bivalence includes a\ndetailed set of rules for propositions. It is significant that this\nsection of Gregory's text, some seven pages, stems from Francis of\nMarchia's refutation of Auriol's position, a refutation adopted and\nextended by Gregory's own Augustinian predecessor at Paris, Michael of\nMassa. In short, Gregory argued that the Principle of Bivalence applies\nuniversally, and Aristotle was wrong to make an exception in the case\nof future-contingent propositions. Although this was his basic\ndisagreement with Auriol, Gregory was so careful a philosopher that\nbefore he refuted Auriol on this point he corrected his Franciscan\npredecessor on details and in so doing made Auriol's own theory more\nprecise. \n\nAuriol placed greater emphasis on divine simplicity and necessity\nthan on divine freedom and contingency when he was wrestling with one\nof the fundamental problems of Christian philosophical theology: given\nan absolutely simple and necessary God, what is the source of\ncontingency? Auriol's own explanation lies in God's relationship with\nevents in time, but this explanation was not of interest to Rimini, who\nwas convinced by Scriptural prophecy that God does in fact know the\nfuture, and convinced by logic that the Principle of Bivalence holds\nuniversally. So the problem becomes, if God knows that Socrates will\nrun, and the proposition “Socrates will run” is true, will not Socrates\nrun necessarily? \n\nRimini's answer is a version of the opinio communis, a\nposition with roots in Scotus and the Parisian tradition but which\nOckham and later Oxford scholars refined with their focus on\npropositions. (It is possible that Ockham was influenced by Auriol in\nhis concentration on future-contingent propositions, as some have held,\nbut there is nothing specific to indicate that Ockham knew Auriol's\ntreatment, and after Scotus it was natural for theologians to focus\ntheir attention on the truth of future-contingent propositions anyway.)\nThe opinio communis relies on God's freedom to save\ncontingency in the world: everything other than God is ultimately\ncontingent, because God wills and acts freely and contingently in\ncreating, and so it is logically possible for the things in the world\nnot to have been or to have been otherwise. At the same time, the\ncommon position affirms God's immutability and determinate knowledge of\nsuch things. The upshot is that true propositions about future\ncontingents have always been true and are immutably true, even\ndeterminately true, but that they are only contingently true and not\nnecessarily so. So Gregory denies Auriol's equation of necessity and\nimmutability. \n\nGregory's position relies on interesting uses of common logical\ndevices and distinctions developed at Paris and Oxford over the\npreceding century, such as the distinction between the composite and\ndivided senses of propositions, and that between conditional and\nabsolute necessity. The purpose of these distinctions was to offer a\nway of explaining the contingency of events, but in doing so they\nassumed the ultimate contingency of everything except God. However, far\nfrom being an affirmation of the “radical contingency” of the world, as\nsome historians have claimed, it was in fact the only way for most\ntheologians to save at least some contingency from the threat of\nabsolute logical and divine determinism. In fact, Gregory and others\nadmitted that, assuming God's knowledge of the future, the future was\nnecessary ex suppositione, although not absolutely, because it\nis logically possible for immutable God to know otherwise. Peter\nAuriol, and later Peter de Rivo, Pietro Pomponazzi, and Martin Luther,\nwould consider these efforts feeble and deluded. The three Peters\nresorted to alternative theories that others considered equally feeble\nand deluded, whereas Luther simply accepted the conclusion that all\nattempts to save meaningful contingency governed by human free will\nwere doomed to failure. \n\nWhat is interesting about Gregory's treatment, again, is not his\noriginality, but the clarity and precision with which he presented the\ncommon position. He even pointed out problems in the discussions of\nthose with whom he broadly agreed, such as Ockham. True, almost all of\nwhat Rimini said could be found in Marchia, Massa, Ockham, Landulph\nCaracciolo, Adam Wodeham, and others, but not in such an organized\nfashion. \n\nOne final element of Gregory's stance on modal matters that deserves\nour attention is the contingency or necessity of the past. The\nopinio communis maintained that the past is somehow necessary\nin a strong sense, even though it is not absolutely necessary. It seems\nthat Gregory did not go so far as to say that the past is necessary\n(beyond the normal necessity ex suppositione), but he does\nmake some sort of modal distinction between the past and the future.\nThus we can say that Gregory did not think God can change the past,\nalthough there has been some disagreement on this issue (Courtenay\n1972–73; Schabel 2000, 271–2). Suffice it to say that the time has come\nfor a long and careful treatment of the modal status of the past in\nmedieval thought, to determine whether any thinker ever really thought\nthe past could be changed. The probable answer is negative. \n\nPredestination was the traditional subject of distinctions 40–41 of\ncommentaries on book I of the Sentences. This was a more\npurely “theological” subset of the more “philosophical” topic of\nforeknowledge and future contingents treated in distinctions 38–39. As in the\ncase of foreknowledge, Gregory proceeded slowly and carefully, defining\nhis terms and outlining the possible positions. Gregory's Augustinian\nbent shows through more clearly in predestination than in\nforeknowledge. Gregory quoted Augustine's words no less than 43 times in this context,\nand cited him still more often. Frequent scriptural quotations,\ncarefully chosen, provide the ultimate basis for his theory. From\nRomans 9.13, where Paul comments on Malachi 1.2, “Jacob I have loved,\nbut Esau I have hated,” Gregory took his position that from eternity,\nGod actively elects to damn some and to save others, a theory called\nDouble Predestination or Double Particular Election (Vignaux 1934, ch.\n4; Schüler 1934; Halverson 1998, 143–157; Schabel 2002). \n\nThe main issue is what the causal connection is between humans'\nwilling and acting and their salvation or damnation, and predestination\nor reprobation: do humans participate in or contribute to their own\nsalvation and damnation, or is God's will the sole cause? Traditionally\nthe answer had been that humans are the cause of their deserved\ndamnation, but that salvation depended solely on God's will. Although\nthere were various interpretations of this traditional stance, Peter\nAuriol seems to have been the first important university scholar to\nprovide a real alternative. Auriol had already sought to distance God\nfrom the everyday details of the world's existence, in order to\npreserve divine necessity and the contingency of things. Auriol now\napplied his general theory to the specific issue of soteriology and\nclaimed that God sets up general rules by which certain sets of people\nwill be damned and other sets saved, without actively choosing to save\nor damn specific individuals. This maintained divine immutability but\nhad the added bonus of providing symmetry for reprobation and\npredestination: the determining factor is the presence or absence of an\nobstacle to grace (obex gratiae). For Auriol, while someone's\nobstacle to grace is indeed a positive cause of reprobation, the\nabsence of such an obstacle, however, is merely a negative or\nprivative cause of predestination. Thus Auriol thought he could avoid\ncharges of Pelagianism by simply denying a positive cause of\npredestination in the elect. Ockham appears to have adopted the main\nelements of Auriol's stance, while Walter Chatton at Oxford and Gerard\nOdonis and Thomas of Strasbourg at Paris went further and posited a\npositive cause of predestination in the elect, which would appear to\napproach the condemned Pelagian doctrine. \n\nGregory reacted by charging that both the theory of the privative\ncause and the notion of the positive cause of predestination in those\nwho are predestined are Pelagian. Instead Gregory returned to the\ntraditional view as it concerned predestination: it stems only from\nGod's merciful will. However, Auriol's criticism of the asymmetry of\nthe traditional position led Gregory to claim that not only do the\npredestined play no causal role in their salvation, but neither do the\nreprobate contribute to their damnation. In short, there is no reason\neither for one person's salvation or for another person's damnation\nexcept the inscrutable will of God: we do not know why some are saved\nand others damned. This, after all, Gregory believed, was the theory of\nPaul and of Augustine. \n\nOne has to admire Gregory's consistency here, mirroring that of his\nopponent, Peter Auriol. In the case of divine foreknowledge, Auriol\nprovided an alternative to the traditional position because he claimed\nthat the common defense of contingency failed. Auriol's theory allowed\nhim to preserve the causal role of humans in reprobation, at the\nexpense perhaps of involving humans in predestination and therefore\ncoming close to Pelagianism. There were problems with Auriol's stance,\nbut it was consistent. Gregory, on the other hand, agreed with the\ncommon position on divine foreknowledge, but when it really counted,\nin soteriology, Gregory took this common position to what he (and\nAuriol) thought was its logical conclusion. Since God's free creation\nand action is really the only source of contingency in the world, then\nGod's free will is the only real cause of salvation and damnation.\nSalvation and damnation are contingent like anything else, but not\ncontingent upon human free will, but merely on God's will. No doubt\nfor Gregory, everyone else who held the opinio communis\nshould also have held to Double Predestination or Double Particular\nElection. Indeed, at least one of Gregory's immediate predecessors,\nthe Carmelite Guy Terrena, appears to have agreed (Schabel 2015).\nLuther and Calvin agreed with Gregory, but they saw no reason for the\nlogical devices of the opinio communis, which for them as for\nAuriol could not save the contingency of human willing. \n\nEpistemology is another subject in which Gregory's thought has\nreceived much attention (e.g. Elie 1937; Dal Pra 1956; Gál 1977;\nEckermann 1978; V. Wendland's chapter in Oberman 1981, 242–300; Tachau\n1988, 358–71). As in natural philosophy, Gregory maintains a\nnon-realist position that universals are formed by the soul and only\nafter the mind has previous apprehensions of singular things. Thus\nsensory experience plays a major role in intellectual cognition. For\nsimple cognition Gregory adopts the common terminology of the dichotomy\nbetween intuitive and abstractive cognition, although the difference\nbetween the two is based on the objects rather than the modes of\ncognition. For Gregory, intuitive cognition terminates immediately at\nthe extramental object, but abstractive terminates at the object's\nspecies in the soul. Inspired by some of Ockham's successors, Gregory\nargues against the Venerable Inceptor's claim that via intuitive\ncognition one could determine whether a thing does not\nexist. \n\nIn agreement with Auriol against most contemporaries, however,\nGregory also holds that one can have an intuitive cognition of an\nobject that does not exist, as for example when we see a “broken”\npencil in a glass of water, when there is only an unbroken pencil in\nreality. But Auriol is wrong in claiming that this is an instance of an\nintuitive cognition of something absent, because for Gregory the\ncognition is really caused by the species of some present object,\nalthough perhaps not the object that the mind thinks it is. Therefore\nGregory does not adopt Auriol's definition of intuitive cognition as\nthe cognition when the soul merely thinks that the object is present.\nIn any case the dichotomy is different for Gregory because he maintains\nthat abstractive cognition is also somewhat intuitive, since the\nspecies of the object is known immediately and therefore\nintuitively. \n\nIn the course of Gregory's long discussion of the problem of\nforeknowledge and future contingents, he makes frequent reference to\nthe notion of the complexe significabile. When it comes to\ncomplex cognition, or scientific knowledge, Gregory's inspiration was\nAdam Wodeham, who built on some of Walter Chatton's ideas in developing\nthe complexe significabile. Ockham held that the object of\nscientific knowledge is the conclusion of a syllogism, and Gregory\nrejects this. Chatton's alternative was that scientific knowledge has\nas its object things outside the mind. Gregory also denies this,\nbecause \n\nOne can see here how Gregory's stress on the overarching contingency\nof creation connects with his epistemology. \n\nGregory chooses as the object of scientific knowledge the\nalternative offered by Adam Wodeham. Chatton's notion of “thing” in\nscientific knowledge was the state of affairs signified by both the\nnegative and the affirmative proposition. For example, “Socrates is\nsitting” and “Socrates is not sitting” signify for Chatton the same\nthing, not Socrates, not sitting, and not the propositions, but somehow\nthe whole Socrates's-being-seated. Although Chatton had his reasons for\nhis theory, Wodeham modified it in a useful way, differentiating\nbetween positive and negative states of affairs. Thus for Wodeham, each\nproposition has its own total significate that is only complexly\nsignifiable (complexe significabile), so that\nSocrates's-being-seated and Socrates's-not-being-seated are two\ndifferent things, the objects of scientific knowledge. \n\nGregory adopted Wodeham's theory and tailored it where necessary to\nhis own thought. The complexe significabile, once thought to be\nGregory's invention, is neither the proposition itself (although it\ndetermines the truth or falsity of the proposition) nor individual\nthings in the world, but rather the arrangement of things in the world.\nHe differed from Wodeham, for example, in the way he thought about\n“assenting to” and “dissenting from” such complexe\nsignificabilia, an issue which had occupied Chatton at length.\nGregory then applied the notion to a host of other philosophical\nproblems, such as future contingents, and through him the complexe\nsignificabile became the common intellectual property of\ncontinental thinkers, and parallel notions are found in many important\nlater intellectuals. \n\nAlthough his commentary on books I and II of the Sentences\nis by far Gregory's largest and most important work, historians\nof medieval philosophy have recently devoted some attention to his sole\nwriting on economic thought, which was printed in Reggio Emilia in 1508\nas the Tractatus de imprestantiis Venetorum et de usura and\nreprinted in Rimini itself over a century later in 1622 (Rimini 1508; Lambertini\n2003, 2009; Kirshner 2015). The only known manuscript witness is in a\ncodex containing various political and economic tracts: Florence,\nBiblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Conv. Soppr. J. X. 51, ff. 201r-212r.\nThe manuscript carries a different redaction of the text, but it can be\nused to correct the printed editions and should form the basis of a\nfuture critical edition. The title and explicit in the manuscript\nfurther identify the work as a quaestio disputata on the\nforced loans of the Venetian commune according to the determination of\nGregory of Rimini, Master of Theology and prior general of the\nAugustinians. Terminology in the text itself confirms that rather than\na purely written work, the piece derives from an oral disputation,\nalthough the internal structure and the existence of two redactions\nindicate that it was much revised afterwards. Since we know that\ntheologians’ administrative responsibilities did not preclude\ntheir participation in such events as quodlibetal disputations, it is\npossible that the debate took place while Gregory was his order's\nprior general as the incipit says, i.e., in the latter half of 1357 or\nin 1358, which would make it his last word on intellectual matters. \n\nGregory was actually asked two questions, and he combined them in his\ndetermination. The first was whether it was licit for a creditor to\nreceive interest on a forced loan. Various Italian communes resorted to\nforced loans from their citizens to raise money, paying in return an\nannual sum but never the principal. In the case of Venice, the forced\nlender received 5%. The second question asked whether it was licit for\nsomeone else to acquire the title to the loan from the forced lender,\nfor a sum smaller than the initial loan, and continue to receive the\nannual sum from the commune. For example, the government could demand\n$100 from a citizen, promising to pay $5 each year. Another citizen\ncould then pay $25 to the first citizen and acquire the right to\nreceive the annual payment of $5. \n\nThe issue was a concrete one in the fourteenth century, and several\nscholars were asked similar or even identical questions, which allows\nus to place Gregory's determination in a historical context. One\nwriter gave a liberal response to the first question, that the mere\nfact that the loan was forced made the creditor's receiving of 5%\ninterest licit, while the same author considered the second transaction\nan acceptable contract of sale and not a purchase of a loan. A more\nconservative author, on the other hand, viewed the 5% as usury, unless\nit constituted a spontaneous gift from the commune to the citizen and\nas long as the citizen did not intend to profit. In this case, the gift\ncould not be purchased licitly by another, naturally, for the unforced\nbuyer would surely be a usurer. \n\nGregory's treatment has been singled out as historically\nsignificant. Gregory's procedure reflects his earlier\nSentences commentary in his careful structure. Following\nopening arguments, Gregory divides the determination into four\narticles, first defining his terms, second discussing the sinfulness of\nusury, third answering the questions, and fourth responding to the\nopening arguments. Although Gregory is a Master of Theology, he answers\nthe question as a philosopher, employing rational arguments. For\nGregory, usury is wrong pure and simple, since it breaks the rule of\nequality in exchanges. One might view this as a conservative approach,\nbut Gregory's general position may entail a liberal\nimplementation of his theory, since the determining factor lies in\none's conscience, in one's intent: “Usury is profit\nintended from a loan.” Gregory's emphasis on the\nrole of intent and conscience here is unusual. In the case at hand,\nVenice can legitimately pay the 5% only if the commune's motives\nare honorable, either because it believes it is paying for damages or\nreturning a kindness, although Gregory excludes from the rubric\n“damages” the opportunity costs from the resulting\nnon-acquisition of possible profits, thus further demonstrating his\nawareness of business and banking practices. Since Venice pays all\nforced creditors such a regular annual fee, however, it does not seem\nto Gregory to be paid for either of those reasons. Still, he leaves it\nup to the conscience. \n\nThis applies to the second question as well. The creditor who has given\nthe loan in good conscience and without hope of profit has not\ncommitted usury, so he has “a right over the commune” that\nhe can sell licitly. Moreover, the buyer can purchase this licitly, as\nlong as he does not intend to profit thereby. But if this is not the\ncase, if profit is intended, the sin of usury is committed, more\nseriously than in the first case, since no force is involved. \nGregory's determination would allow Venice and its creditors to\nproceed with their practice of forced loans and creditors’\ntransfers of annual payments without outward restrictions from the\nChurch. Perhaps he was being practical given the complexities of the\nsituation. By stressing the role of intent and conscience, he freed\ninvestors to pursue their projects. But without drawing clear lines\nseparating the legitimate from the illegitimate, he burdened them to\nconsider their motives in each and every transaction, warning that\nwhether they are usurers in truth will be determined before God at the\njudgment of souls. \n\nNow that Gregory's works are available in a reliable modern edition,\nhe has begun receiving more direct attention, for example in the\ncollection of papers in Oberman 1981 and in the conference held in\nRimini in 2000 that was devoted to Gregory's life and thought\n(published as Gregorio da Rimini. Filosofo in Rimini in\n2003).  It is to be hoped that further studies of his Parisian and\nOxford predecessors on various single issues will enable us to see his\ninnovations more clearly. Recent studies have shown that he was not\nalways as original as was once thought, but that does not diminish in\nany way his important position in the history of philosophy. Moreover,\nGregory sometimes did come up with new solutions to problems, and even\nwhere he did not, his treatments, because of their clarity and\ncomprehensiveness, often became the primary source for later thinkers\nof the ideas he adopted from his predecessors and developed.","contact.mail":"schabel@ucy.ac.cy","contact.domain":"ucy.ac.cy"}]
