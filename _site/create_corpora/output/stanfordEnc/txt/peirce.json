Practicing geodesy and chemistry in order to earn a living, he\nnevertheless considered scientific philosophy, and especially logic,\nto be his true calling, his real vocation. In the course of his\npolymathic researches, he wrote voluminously on an exceedingly wide\nrange of topics, ranging from mathematics, mathematical logic,\nphysics, geodesy, spectroscopy, and astronomy, on the one hand (that\nof mathematics and the physical sciences), to psychology,\nanthropology, history, and economics, on the other (that of the\nhumanities and the social sciences).\n\n\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce was born on September 10, 1839 in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, and he died on April 19, 1914 in Milford,\nPennsylvania. His writings extend from about 1857 until near his\ndeath, a period of approximately 57 years. His published works run to\nabout 12,000 printed pages and his known unpublished manuscripts run\nto about 80,000 handwritten pages. The topics on which he wrote have\nan immense range, from mathematics and the physical sciences at one\nextreme, to economics, psychology, and other social sciences at the other\nextreme. \n\nPeirce’s father Benjamin Peirce was Professor of Mathematics at\nHarvard University and was one of the founders of, and for a while \na director of, the U. S. Coast and\nGeodetic Survey as well as one of the founders of the Smithsonian\nInstitution.  The department of mathematics at Harvard was essentially\nbuilt by Benjamin. From his father, Charles Sanders Peirce received\nmost of the substance of his early education as well as a good deal of\nintellectual encouragement and stimulation. Benjamin’s didactic\ntechnique mostly took the form of setting interesting problems for his\nson and checking Charles’s solutions to them. In this challenging\ninstructional atmosphere Charles acquired his lifelong habit of\nthinking through philosophical and scientific problems entirely on his\nown. To this habit, perhaps, is to be attributed Charles Peirce’s\nconsiderable originality. \n\nPeirce graduated from Harvard in 1859 and received the bachelor of\nscience degree in chemistry in 1863, graduating summa cum\nlaude. Except for his remarkable marks in chemistry Peirce was a\npoor student, typically in the bottom third of his class. Obviously,\nthe standard curriculum bored him, so that he mostly avoided doing\nseriously its required work. For thirty-two years, from 1859 until the\nlast day of 1891, he was employed by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic\nSurvey, mainly surveying and carrying out geodetic\ninvestigations. Some of this work Peirce undertook simply to finance\nhis diurnal existence (and that of his first wife Melusina (Zina)\nFay), while he devoted the main force of his thinking to abstract\nlogic. Nevertheless, the geodetic tasks involved making careful\nmeasurements of the intensity of the earth’s gravitational field by\nmeans of using swinging pendulums. The pendulums that Peirce used were\noften of his own design. For over thirty years, then, Peirce was\ninvolved in practical and theoretical problems associated with making\nvery accurate scientific measurements. This practical involvement in\nphysical science was crucial in his ultimately coming to reject\nscientific determinism, as we shall see.  From 1879 until 1884, Peirce maintained a second job teaching\nlogic in the Department of Mathematics at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity. During that period the Department of Mathematics was\nheaded by the famous mathematician J. J. Sylvester, whom Peirce had\nmet earlier through his father Benjamin. This teaching period also was\ncharacterized by Peirce’s having several students who made names for\nthemselves in their own right. Among these were Oscar Howard Mitchell,\nAllan Marquand, Benjamin Ives Gilman, Joseph Jastrow, Fabian Franklin,\nChristine Ladd (later, after having married Fabian Franklin, Christine\nLadd-Franklin), Thorstein Veblen, and John Dewey.  Brief commentary\nwill be offered at the end of this essay on three of these figures:\nJohn Dewey, Oscar Howard Mitchell, and Christine Ladd.  It is\nsometimes said that William James was also one of Peirce’s students,\nbut this claim is erroneous: it conflates the fact of James’s being an\nold and a close friend of Peirce, as well as being a fellow-member\nwith Peirce in the so-called “Metaphysical Club” in\nCambridge, Massachusetts, with the non-fact of James’s being a student\nof Peirce at Johns Hopkins University along with John Dewey and\nothers. \n\nPeirce’s teaching job at Johns Hopkins was suddenly terminated for\nreasons that are apparently connected with the fact that Peirce’s\nsecond wife (Juliette Annette Froissy, a.k.a. Juliette Annette\nPourtalai) was Romani, moreover a Roma with whom Peirce had more or\nless openly cohabited before marriage and before his divorce from his\nfirst wife Zina.  (In fact Peirce obtained his divorce from Zina only\ntwo days before marrying Juliette.) The Johns Hopkins position was\nPeirce’s only academic employment, and after losing it Peirce worked\nthereafter only for the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (and\nconstructing entries for the Century Dictionary) and writing\nbook reviews for the Nation.  The government employment came\nto an end the last day of 1891, ultimately because of funding\nobjections to pure research (and perhaps also to Peirce’s extravagant\nspending and to his procrastination in finishing his required reports)\nthat were generated in an ever-practical-minded Congress.  Thereafter,\nPeirce often lived on the edge of penury, eking out a living doing\nintellectual odd-jobs (such as translating or writing occasional\npieces) and carrying out consulting work (mainly in chemical\nengineering and analysis). For the remainder of his life, except for\nmoney inherited from his mother and aunt, Peirce was often in dire\nfinancial straits; sometimes he managed to survive only because of the\novert or covert charity of relatives or friends, for example that of\nhis old friend William James. \n\nIn his youth Peirce was amazingly precocious, and he began to study\nlogic seriously at an extraordinarily early age. According to noted\nPeirce scholar Max Fisch in his“Introduction” to Volume 1\nof The Writings of Charles S. Peirce: A Chronological\nEdition, p. xviii, Peirce’s introduction to and first immersion\nin the study of logic came in 1851 within a week or two of his turning\n12 years of age. Remembering the occasion in 1910, in his “Note\non the Doctrine of Chances,” in Collected Papers of Charles\nS. Peirce, Volume II, Section 408 (hereinafter such Collected\nPapers references will be cited as CP, 2.408), Peirce\nhimself remembered the crucial event as having occurred in 1852, when\nhe was 13 years old. Regardless of his exact age, at the time of the\nevent Charles encountered and then over a period of at most a few days\nstudied and absorbed a standard textbook of the time on logic by\nBishop Richard Whately. Having become fascinated by logic, he began to\nthink of all issues as problems in logic. During his freshman year at\ncollege (Harvard), in 1855, when he was 16 years old, he and a friend\nbegan private study of philosophy in general, starting with Schiller’s\nLetters on the Aesthetic Education of Man and continuing with\nKant’s Critique of Pure Reason. Schiller’s distinction among\nthe three basic human drives of Stofftrieb,\nFormtrieb, and Spieltrieb Peirce never forgot or\nrenounced, and it became the basis for Peirce’s distinction between\nthe man of practical affairs, the man of scientific activity, and the\nman of aesthetic practice. By Kant Peirce was initially more or less\nrepelled. After three years of intense study of Kant, Peirce concluded\nthat Kant’s system was vitiated by what he called its “puerile\nlogic,” and about the age of 19 he formed the fixed intention of\ndevoting his life to the study of and to research in logic. It was,\nhowever, impossible at that time, as indeed Peirce’s father Benjamin\ninformed him, to earn a living as a research logician; and Peirce\ndescribed himself at the time of his graduation from Harvard in 1859,\njust short of his 20th birthday, as wondering “what I would do\nin life.” Within two years, however, he had more or less\nresolved his problem.  During those two years he had worked as an Aid\non the Coast Survey, in Maine and Louisiana, then had returned to\nCambridge and had studied natural history and natural philosophy at\nHarvard. He said of himself that in 1861 he “No longer wondered\nwhat I would do in life but defined my object.” It is evident\nthat his adoption of the profession of chemistry and his practice of\ngeodesy allowed Charles both to support himself (and before long also\nhis first wife Zina) and to continue to engage in researches on\nlogic. From the early 1860s until his death in 1914 his output in\nlogic was voluminous and varied.  One of his logical systems became\nthe basis for Ernst Schroeder’s great three-volume treatise on logic,\nthe Vorlesungen ueber die Algebra der Logik. \n\nPeirce, then, had early and deep disagreements with Kant’s position\nabout logic, and he never altered his view that Kant’s view of logic\nwas superficial: “… he [i.e. Kant] never touches this\nlast doctrine [i.e. logic] without betraying marks of hasty,\nsuperficial study” (Collected Papers of Charles Sanders\nPeirce, Volume 2, Section 3; hereafter such Collected\nPapers references will be cited as as CP, 2.3). Even\nworse, Peirce held, was the Logik of Hegel: Kant’s fault\n“… is a hundredfold more true of Hegel’s Logik\n… . That work cannot justly be regarded as anything more\nthan a sketch” (CP, 2.32). \n\nNevertheless, Peirce continued to respect and read the first\nCritique throughout his life.  For a fuller discussion\nof Peirce’s own views about how his work related to that of\nKant, Hegel, and Schelling, see the supplementary document: \n\nPeirce’s extensive publications are scattered among various\npublication media, and have been difficult to collect. Shortly after\nhis death in 1914, his widow Juliette sold his unpublished manuscripts\nto the Department of Philosophy at Harvard University. Initially they\nwere under the care of Josiah Royce, but after Royce’s death in 1916,\nand especially after the end of the First World War, the papers were\npoorly cared for. Many of them were misplaced, lost, given away,\nscrambled, and the like. Carolyn Eisele, one of several genuine heroes\nin the great effort to locate and assemble Peirce’s writings,\ndiscovered a lost trunk full of Peirce’s papers and manuscripts only\nin the mid-1950s; the trunk had been secreted, apparently for decades,\nin an unlit, obscure part of the basement in Harvard’s Widener\nLibrary. \n\nIn the 1930s volumes of The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders\nPeirce began to appear, with Charles Hartshorne, Paul Weiss, and\nArthur Burks as their editors. For almost three decades these volumes,\nand various collections of entries culled from them were the only\ngenerally available source for Peirce’s thoughts. Unfortunately, many\nof the entries in the Collected Papers are not integral\npieces of Peirce’s own design, but rather stretches of writing that\nwere cobbled together by the editors at their own discretion\n(sometimes one might almost say “whim”) from different Peircean\nsources. Often a single entry will consist of patches of writing from\nvery different periods of Peirce’s intellectual life, and these\npatches might even be in tension or outright contradiction with each\nother. Such entries in the Collected Papers make very\ndifficult reading if one tries to regard them as consistent, sustained\npassages of argument. They also tend to give the reader a false\npicture of Peirce as unsystematic, desultory, and unable to complete a\ntrain of thought. In general, even though Peirce is often obscure and \neven at his best is seldom\neasy to read, the Collected Papers make Peirce’s thinking look \nmuch more obscure than it really is. \n\nThe only sensible and intelligent way to publish the works of someone\nlike Peirce, who wrote voluminously and over such a long period of\ntime (57 years), is to arrange the publication chronologically and to\nemploy extremely careful editing. In such a fashion, the entire set of\nPeircean works can be presented, as Peirce conceived them and in their\nnatural temporal setting and order. Finally, beginning in 1976 with\nthe organizational conception of Max H. Fisch and the help of Edward\nMoore, the Peirce Edition Project (PEP) was created at Indiana\nUniversity-Purdue University at Indianapolis (UIPUI). Then, under the\nPEP, in the 1980s, there began to appear a meticulously edited\nchronological edition of carefully selected works of Peirce: this is\nthe Writings of Charles S. Peirce: a Chronological Edition,\nedited by The Peirce Edition Project of the Indiana University-Purdue\nUniversity at Indianapolis. Although the Chronological\nEdition has been fettered from time to time by lack of proper\nfunding, the Chronological Edition has succeeded in covering\nextremely well in its first seven published volumes the major writings\nfrom 1857 to 1892. (At the present time, October 2014, Volume 7 is\nstill awaiting publication, even though Volume 8, covering writings\nfrom 1890 to 1892 already has been published. Volume 7 is to be an\nedition of Peirce’s definitions for the Century\nDictionary. It is to be edited by the Peirce Edition Project in\nconjunction with the University of Quebec at Montreal (UQAM)), under\nthe supervision of Professor Francois Latraverse.) The impressive\nachievement of the PEP is finally making it possible to assess the\nreal Peirce, instead of the chopped-up and then re-pasted-together\npicture of Peirce previously available. In particular the\nChronological Edition has made it possible to see the\ndevelopment of Peirce’s thinking from its earliest stages to its later\ndevelopments. Questions long vexed in Peirce scholarship are finally\nbeginning to be debated usefully by Peirce scholars: whether there is\ngenuine systematic unity in Peirce’s thought, whether his ideas\nchanged or remained the same over time, in what particulars his\nthought did change and why, when exactly certain notions were first\nconceived by Peirce, whether there were definite “periods”\nin Peirce’s intellectual development, and what exactly Peirce meant by\nsome of his more obscure notions such as his universal categories (on\nwhich see below).  Continued funding for the Peirce Edition Project is\nobviously a crucial priority in the ongoing effort to bring to public\nlight the thoughts of this extremely important American\nphilosopher. \n\nIn addition to the Chronological Edition of the Peirce\nEdition Project, other venues for editing and publishing Peirce’s work\nare regularly found, and there are several excellent editions of\nparticular lectures, lecture-series, chains of correspondence, and the\nlike. Just four such editions will be mentioned here. First, there is\nthe edition of Peirce’s Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898, edited\nby Kenneth Laine Ketner and with an introduction on the consequences\nof mathematics by Kenneth Laine Ketner and Hilary Putnam and comments\non the lectures by Hilary Putnam, entitled Reasoning and the Logic\nof Things. Second, there is the edition of Peirce’s Harvard\nLectures on Pragmatism of 1903, edited by Patricia Ann Turrisi,\nentitled Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right\nThinking. Third, there is the four-volume edition of Peirce’s\nmathematical writings edited by Carolyn Eisele, entitled The New\nElements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce. Fourth, there is\nthe two-part edition of Peirce’s writings on the history and logic of\nscience edited by Carolyn Eisele, entitled Historical Perspectives\non Peirce’s Logic of Science: A History of Science. \n\nPrior to about 1865, thinkers on logic commonly had divided arguments\ninto two subclasses: the class of deductive arguments (a.k.a.\nnecessary inferences) and the class of inductive arguments (a.k.a.\nprobable inferences). About this time, Peirce began to hold that there\nwere two utterly distinct classes of probable inferences, which he\nreferred to as inductive inferences and abductive inferences (which he\nalso called hypotheses and retroductive inferences). Peirce reached\nthis conclusion by entertaining what would happen if one were to\ninterchange propositions in the syllogism AAA-1 (Barbara): All\nMs are Ps; all Ss are Ms;\ntherefore, all Ss are Ps. This valid syllogism\nPeirce accepted as representative of deduction. But he also seemed\ntypically to regard it in connection with a problem of drawing\nconclusions on the basis of taking samples. For let us regard being\nan M as being a member of a population of some sort, say\nbeing a ball of the population of balls in some particular urn. Let us\nregard P as being some property a member of this population\ncan have, say being red. And, finally, let us regard being\nan S as being a member of a random sample taken from this\npopulation. Then our syllogism in Barbara becomes: All balls in this\nurn are red; all balls in this particular random sample are taken from\nthis urn; therefore, all balls in this particular random sample are\nred. Peirce regarded the major premise here as being the Rule, the\nminor premise as being the particular Case, and the conclusion as\nbeing the Result of the argument. The argument is a piece of\ndeduction.  In this example the argument is also an argument from\npopulation to random sample that is also a necessary inference. \n\nBut now let us see what happens if we form a new argument by\ninterchanging the conclusion (the Result) with the major premise (the\nRule). The resultant argument becomes: All Ss are Ps\n(Result); all Ss are Ms (Case); therefore, all\nMs are Ps (Rule). This is the invalid syllogism\nAAA-3. But let us now construe it as pertaining to drawing conclusions\non the basis of taking samples. The argument then becomes: All balls\nin this particular random sample are red; all balls in this particular\nrandom sample are taken from this urn; therefore, all balls in this\nurn are red. What we have here is an argument from sample to\npopulation. This sort of argument is what Peirce understood to be the\ncore meaning of induction.  That is to say, for Peirce, induction in\nthe most basic sense is argument from random sample to population. It \nshould be clear that inductive inference is not necessary inference: it \nmight well turn out that the claims stated in the premises are true \neven though the claim made in the conclusion is false. \n\nLet us now go further and see what happens if, from the deduction\nAAA-1, we form a new argument by interchanging the conclusion (the\nResult) with the minor premise (the Case). The resultant argument\nbecomes: All Ms are Ps (Rule); all Ss are\nPs (Result); therefore, all Ss are Ms\n(Case). This is the invalid syllogism AAA-2. But let us now regard it\nas pertaining to drawing conclusions on the basis of taking\nsamples. The argument then becomes: All balls in this urn are red; all\nballs in this particular random sample are red; therefore, all balls\nin this particular random sample are taken from this urn. What we have\nhere is nothing at all like an argument from population to sample or\nan argument from sample to population: rather, it is a form of probable\nargument entirely different from both deduction and induction. It has\nthe air of conjecture or “educated \nguess” about it. This new type of\nargument Peirce called hypothesis (also, retroduction, and also, \nabduction). It should be clear that abduction is never necessary \ninference \n\nThere is no need to consider the variant of AAA-1 that is obtained by\ninterchanging the Rule and the Case in AAA-1. The resultant argument\nis of the form AAA-4, which is exactly the same argument as AAA-1 with\ninterchanged premises. So it is simply deduction over again. \n\nPeirce’s thinking about deduction, induction, and abduction can be seen \nalso from examples he gives of arguments that are similar to the syllogisms \nhe discusses, but retain the universal affirmative judgment only for the \nCase, using a definite percentage between 0% and 100% for both the Rule \nand the Result. \n\nCorresponding to AAA-1 (deduction) we have the following\nargument: X% of Ms are Ps (Rule);\nall Ss are Ms (Case); therefore, X%\nof Ss are Ps (Result). Construing this argument, as\nwe did before, as applying to drawing balls from urns, the argument\nbecomes: X% of the balls in this urn are red; all the balls\nin this random sample are taken from this urn; therefore, X%\nof the balls in this random sample are red. Peirce still regards this\nargument as being a deduction, even though it is not—as the\nargument AAA-1 is—a necesary inference. He calls such an\nargument a “statistical deduction” or a\n“probabilistic deduction proper.”\n \n\nCorresponding to AAA-3 (induction) we have the following\nargument: X% of Ss are Ps (Result);\nall Ss are Ms (Case); therefore, X%\nof Ms are Ps (Rule). Construing this argument as\napplying to drawing balls from urns, the argument becomes: X%\nof the balls in this random sample are red; all the balls in this\nrandom sample are taken from this urn; therefore, X% of the\nballs in this urn are red. Here we still have an argument whose\nessence is the logical transition from a random sample to the\npopulation from which the sample is taken. The inference is made by\nvirtue of what Hans Reichenbach called “the straight\nrule”: the proportion of a trait found in the sample is\nattributed also to the population. \n\nCorresponding to AAA-2 (abduction) we have the following\nargument: X% of Ms are Ps\n(Rule); X% of Ss are Ps (Result);\ntherefore, all Ss are Ms (Case). Construing this\nargument as applying to drawing balls from urns, the argument becomes:\nX% of the balls in this urn are red; X% of the balls\nin this random sample are red; therefore, all the balls in this random\nsample are taken from this urn. Again here we have the character of an\neducated guess or inference to a plausible explanation. \n\nOver many years Peirce modified his views on the three types of\narguments, sometimes changing his views but mostly extending them by\nexpanding his commentary upon the original trichotomy.  Occasionally\nhe swerved between one view and another concerning which larger class\nof arguments a particular instance or sub-type of argument belonged\nto. For example, he seemed to have some hesitation about whether\narguments from analogy should be construed as inductions (arguments\nfrom a sample of the properties of things to a population of the\nproperties of things) or abductions (conjectures made on the basis of\nsufficient similarity, which notion might not easily be analyzed in\nterms of sets of properties). \n\nThe most important extension Peirce made of his earliest views on\nwhat deduction, induction, and abduction involved was to integrate the\nthree argument forms into his view of the systematic procedure for\nseeking truth that he called the “scientific method.” As\nso integrated, deduction, induction, and abduction are not simply\nargument forms any more: they are three phases of the methodology of\nscience, as Peirce conceived this methodology. In fact, in Peirce’s\nmost mature philosophy he virtually (perhaps totally and literally)\nequates the trichotomy with the three phases he discerns in the\nscientific method. Scientific method begins with abduction or\nhypothesis: because of some perhaps surprising or puzzling phenomenon,\na conjecture or hypothesis is made about what actually is going\non. This hypothesis should be such as to explain the surprising\nphenomenon, such as to render the phenomenon more or less a matter of\ncourse if the hypothesis should be true. Scientific method then\nproceeds to the stage of deduction: by means of necessary inferences,\nconclusions are drawn from the provisionally-adopted hypothesis about\nthe obtaining of phenomena other than the surprising one that\noriginally gave rise to the hypothesis. Conclusions are reached, that\nis to say, about other phenomena that must obtain if the hypothesis\nshould actually be true.  These other phenomena must be such that\nexperimental tests can be performed whose results tell us whether the\nfurther phenomena do obtain or do not obtain.  Finally, scientific\nmethod proceeds to the stage of induction: experiments are actually\ncarried out in order to test the provisionally-adopted hypothesis by\nascertaining whether the deduced results do or do not obtain. At this\npoint scientific method enters one or the other of two “feedback\nloops.” If the deduced consequences do obtain, then we loop back\nto the deduction stage, deducing still further consequences of our\nhypothesis and experimentally testing for them again.  But, if the\ndeduced consequences do not obtain, then we loop back to the abduction\nstage and come up with some new hypothesis that explains both our\noriginal surprising phenomenon and any new phenomena we have uncovered\nin the course of testing our first, and now failed, hypothesis. Then\nwe pass on to the deduction stage, as before. The entire procedure of\nhypothesis-testing, and not merely that part of it that consists of\narguing from sample to population, is called induction in Peirce’s\nlater philosophy. \n\nAn important part of Peirce’s full conception of scientific method is\nwhat he called the “economics (or: economy) of research.”\nThe idea is that, because research is difficult, research labor-time\nis valuable and should not be wasted.  Both in the creation of\nhypotheses to be tested and in the experiments chosen to test these\nhypotheses, we should act so as to get the very most cognitive bang\nfor the buck, so to say. The object is to proceed at every stage so as\nto maximize the reduction in indeterminacy of our beliefs. Peirce had\nan elaborate, mathematical theory of some aspects of the economy of\nresearch, and he published several complex papers on this topic. The\nfollowing section of the present article contains further information\non Peirce’s notion of the economy of research. \n\nProbably Peirce’s best-known works are the first two articles in a\nseries of six that originally were collectively entitled\nIllustrations of the Logic of Science and published in\nPopular Science Monthly from November 1877 through August\n1878. The first is entitled “The Fixation of Belief” and\nthe second is entitled “How to Make Our Ideas Clear.” In\nthe first of these papers Peirce defended, in a manner consistent with\nnot accepting naive realism, the superiority of the scientific method\nover other methods of overcoming doubt and “fixing\nbelief.” In the second of these papers Peirce defended a\n“pragmatic” notion of clear concepts. \n\nPerhaps the single most important fact to keep in mind in trying to\nunderstand Peirce’s philosophy concerning clarity and the proper\nmethod of fixing belief is that all his life Peirce was a practicing\nphysical scientist: already mentioned is the fact that he worked as a\nphysical scientist for 32 years in his job with the United States\nCoast and Geodetic Survey. As Peirce understood the topics of\nphilosophy and logic, philosophy and logic were themselves also\nsciences, although not physical sciences.  Moreover, he understood\nphilosophy to be the philosophy of science, and he understood logic to\nbe the logic of science (where the word “science” has a\nsense that is best captured by the German\nword Wissenschaft). \n\nIt is in this light that his specifications of the nature of\npragmatism are to be understood. It is also in this light that his\nlater calling of his views “pragmaticism,” in order to\ndistinguish his own scientific philosophy from other conceptions and\ntheories that were trafficked under the title\n“pragmatism,” is to be understood. When he said that the\nwhole meaning of a (clear) conception consists in the entire set of\nits practical consequences, he had in mind that a meaningful\nconception must have some sort of experiential “cash\nvalue,” must somehow be capable of being related to some sort of\ncollection of possible empirical observations under specifiable\nconditions. Peirce insisted that the entire meaning of a meaningful\nconception consisted in the totality of such specifications of\npossible observations. For example, Peirce tended to spell out the\nmeaning of dispositional properties such as “hard” or\n“heavy” by using the same sort of counterfactual\nconstructions as, say, Karl Hempel would use. Peirce was not a simple\noperationalist in his philosophy of science; nor was he a simple\nverificationist in his epistemology: he believed in the reality of\nabstractions, and in many ways his thinking about universals resembles\nthat of the medieval realists in metaphysics. Nevertheless, despite\nhis metaphysical leanings, Peirce’s views bear a strong family\nresemblance to operationalism and verificationism.  In regard to\nphysical concepts in particular, his views are quite close to those\nof, say, Einstein, who held that the whole meaning of a physical\nconcept is determined by an exact method of measuring it. \n\nThe previous point must be tempered with the fact that Peirce\nincreasingly became a philosopher with broad and deep sympathies for\nboth transcendental idealism and absolute idealism. His Kantian\naffinities are simpler and easier to understand than his Hegelian\nleanings. Having rejected a great deal in Kant, Peirce nevertheless\nshared with Charles Renouvier the view that Kant’s (quasi-)concept of\nthe Ding an sich can play no role whatsoever in philosophy or\nin science other than the role that Kant ultimately assigned to it,\nviz. the role of a Grenzbegriff: a boundary-concept, or,\nperhaps a bit more accurately, a limiting concept. A supposed\n“reality” that is “outside” of every logical\npossibility of empirical or logical interaction with “it”\ncan play no direct role in the sciences. Science can deal only with\nphenomena, that is to say, only with what can “appear”\nsomehow in experience. All scientific concepts must somehow be\ntraceable back to phenomenological roots. Thus, even when Peirce calls\nhimself a “realist” or is called by others a\n“realist,” it must be kept in mind that Peirce was always\na realist of the Kantian “empirical” sort and not a\nKantian “transcendental realist.” His realism is similar\nto what Hilary Putnam has called “internal realism.” (As\nwas said, Peirce was also a realist in quite another sense of he word:\nhe was a realist or an anti-nominalist in the medieval sense.) \n\nPeirce’s Hegelianism, to which he increasingly admitted as he\napproached his most mature philosophy, is more difficult to understand\nthan his Kantianism, partly because it is everywhere intimately tied\nto his entire late theory of signs (semeiotic) and sign use\n(semeiosis), as well as to his evolutionism and to his rather puzzling\ndoctrine of mind.  There are at least four major components of his\nHegelian idealism.  First, for Peirce the world of appearances, which\nhe calls “the phaneron,” is a world consisting entirely of\nsigns. Signs are qualities, relations, features, items, events,\nstates, regularities, habits, laws, and so on that have meanings,\nsignificances, or interpretations. Second, a sign is one term in a\nthreesome of terms that are indissolubly connected with each other by\na crucial triadic relation that Peirce calls “the sign\nrelation.” The sign itself (also called the representamen) is\nthe term in the sign relation that is ordinarily said to represent or\nmean something.  The other two terms in this relation are called the\nobject and the interpretant.  The object is what would ordinarily\nwould be said to be the “thing” meant or signified or\nrepresented by the sign, what the sign is a sign\nof. The interpretant of a sign is said by Peirce to be that\nto which the sign represents the object. What exactly Peirce\nmeans by the interpretant is difficult to pin down. It is something\nlike a mind, a mental act, a mental state, or a feature or quality of\nmind; at all events the interpretant is something ineliminably\nmental. Third, the interpretant of a sign, by virtue of the very\ndefinition Peirce gives of the sign-relation, must itself be a sign,\nand a sign moreover of the very same object that is (or: was)\nrepresented by the (original) sign. In effect, then, the interpretant\nis a second signifier of the object, only one that now has an overtly\nmental status. But, merely in being a sign of the original object,\nthis second sign must itself have (Peirce uses the word\n“determine”) an interpretant, which then in turn is a new,\nthird sign of the object, and again is one with an overtly mental\nstatus. And so on. Thus, if there is any sign at all of any object,\nthen there is an infinite sequence of signs of that same object. So,\neverything in the phaneron, because it is a sign, begins an infinite\nsequence of mental interpretants of an object. \n\nBut now, there is a fourth component of Peirce’s idealism: Peirce\nmakes everything in the phaneron evolutionary. The whole system\nevolves. Three figures from the history of culture loomed exceedingly\nlarge in the intellectual development of Peirce and in the cultural\natmosphere of the period in which Peirce was most active: Hegel in\nphilosophy, Lyell in geology, and Darwin (along with Alfred Russel\nWallace) in biology. These thinkers, of course, all have a single\ntheme in common: evolution. Hegel described an evolution of ideas,\nLyell an evolution of geological structures, and Darwin an evolution\nof biological species and varieties. Peirce absorbed it all.  Peirce’s\nentire thinking, early on and later, is permeated with the\nevolutionary idea, which he extended generally, that is to say, beyond\nthe confines of any particular subject matter. For Peirce, the entire\nuniverse and everything in it is an evolutionary product. Indeed, he\nconceived that even the most firmly entrenched of nature’s habits (for\nexample, even those habits that are typically called “natural\nlaws”) have themselves evolved, and accordingly can and should\nbe subjects of philosophical and scientific inquiry. One can sensibly\nseek, in Peirce’s view, evolutionary explanations of the existence of\nparticular natural laws.  For Peirce, then, the entire phaneron (the\nworld of appearances), as well as all the ongoing processes of its\ninterpretation through mental significations, has evolved and is\nevolving. \n\nNow, no one familiar with Hegel can escape the obvious comparison: we\nhave in Peirce an essentially idealist theory that is similar to the\nidealism that Hegel puts forward in the Phaenomenologie des\nGeistes. Furthermore, both Hegel and Peirce make the whole\nevolutionary interpretation of the evolving phaneron to be a process\nthat is said to be logical, the “action” of logic\nitself. Of course there are differences between the two\nphilosophers. For example, what exactly Hegel’s logic is has been\nshrouded in mystery for every Hegelian after Hegel himself (and some\nphilosophers, for example Popper, would say for every Hegelian\nincluding Hegel). By contrast Peirce’s logic is reasonably clear, and\nhe takes great pains to work it out in intricate detail; basically\nPeirce’s logic is the whole logical apparatus of the physical and\nsocial sciences. \n\nOne implication of the unending nature of the interpretation of\nappearances through infinite sequences of signs is that Peirce cannot\nbe any type of epistemological foundationalist or believer in absolute\nor apodeictic knowledge. He must be, and is, an anti-foundationalist\nand a fallibilist.  From his earliest to his latest writings Peirce\nopposed and attacked all forms of epistemological foundationalism and\nin particular all forms of Cartesianism and a\npriorism. Philosophy must begin wherever it happens to be at the\nmoment, he thought, and not at some supposed ideal foundation,\nespecially not in some world of “private references.” The\nonly important thing in thinking scientifically to apply the\nscientific method itself. This method he held to be essentially public\nand reproducible in its activities, as well as self-correcting in the\nfollowing sense: No matter where different researchers may begin, as\nlong as they follow the scientific method, their results will\neventually converge toward the same outcome. (The pragmatic, or\npragmaticistic, conception of meaning implies that two theories with\nexactly the same empirical content must have, despite superficial\nappearances, the same meaning.)  This ideal point of convergence is\nwhat Peirce means by “the truth,” and\n“reality” is simply what is meant by “the\ntruth.” That these Peircean notions of reality and truth are\ninherently idealist rather than naively realist in character should\nrequire no special pleading. \n\nConnected with Peirce’s anti-foundationalism is his insistence on the\nfallibility of particular achievements in science. Although the\nscientific method will eventually converge to something as a limit,\nnevertheless at any temporal point in the process of scientific\ninquiry we are only at a provisional stage of it and cannot ascertain\nhow far off we may be from the limit to which we are somehow\nconverging. This insistence on the fallibilism of human inquiry is\nconnected with several other important themes of Peirce’s\nphilosophy. His evolutionism has already been discussed: fallibilism\nis obviously connected with the fact that science is not shooting at a\nfixed target but rather one that is always moving. What Peirce calls\nhis “tychism,” which is his anti-deterministic insistence\nthat there is objective chance in the world, is also intimately\nconnected to his fallibilism. (Tychism will be discussed below.)\nDespite Peirce’s insistence on fallibilism, he is far from being an\nepistemological pessimist or sceptic: indeed, he is quite the\nopposite. He tends to hold that every genuine question (that is, every\nquestion whose possible answers have empirical content) can be\nanswered in principle, or at least should not be assumed to be\nunanswerable. For this reason, one his most important dicta, which he\ncalled his first principle of reason, is “Do not block the way\nof inquiry!” \n\nFor Peirce, as we saw, the scientific method involves three phases or\nstages: abduction (making conjectures or creating hypotheses),\ndeduction (inferring what should be the case if the hypotheses are the\ncase), and induction (the testing of hypotheses). The process of going\nthrough the stages should also be carried out with concern for the\neconomy of research. Peirce’s understanding of scientific method,\nthen, is not very different from today’s idea of scientific\nmethod which, seems to have been derived historically both from\nWilliam Whewell and Peirce (see Niiniluoto 1984, 18; Ambrosio 2016;\nand Wagenmakers, Dutilh, & Sarafoglou 2018, 423). Today’s\nunderstanding sees the scientific method as the method of constructing\nhypotheses, deriving consequences from these hypotheses, and then\nexperimentally testing these hypotheses (guided always by the\neconomics of research). Also, as was said above, Peirce increasingly\ncame to understand his three types of logical inference as being\nphases or stages of the scientific method. For example, as Peirce came\nto extend and generalize his notion of abduction, abduction became\ndefined as inference to and provisional acceptance of an explanatory\nhypothesis for the purpose of testing it. Abduction is not always\ninference to the best explanation, but it is always inference to some\nexplanation or at least to something that clarifies or makes routine\nsome information that has previously been “surprising,” in\nthe sense that we would not have routinely expected it, given our\nthen-current state of knowledge. Deduction came to mean for Peirce the\ndrawing of conclusions as to what observable phenomena should be\nexpected if the hypothesis is correct. Induction came for him to mean\nthe entire process of experimentation and interpretation performed in\nthe service of hypothesis testing. \n\nA few further comments are perhaps in order in connection with\nPeirce’s idea of the economy (or: the economics) of research. Concern\nfor the economy of research is a crucial and ineliminable part of\nPeirce’s idea of the scientific method. He understood that science is\nessentially a human and social enterprise and that it always operates\nin some given historical, social, and economic context.  In such a\ncontext some problems are crucial and paramount and must be\nattended-to immediately, while other problems are trivial or frivolous\nor at least can be put off until later. He understood that in the real\ncontext of science some experiments may be vitally important while\nothers may be insignificant. Peirce also understood that the economic\nresources of the scientist (time, money, ability to exert effort,\netc.) are always scarce, even though all the while the “great\nocean of truth,” which lies undiscovered before us, is\ninfinite. All resources for carrying out research, such as personnel,\nperson-hours, and apparatus, are quite costly; accordingly, it is\nwasteful, indeed irrational, to squander them. Peirce proposed,\ntherefore, that careful consideration be paid to the problem of how to\nobtain the biggest epistemological “bang for the buck.” In\neffect, the economics of research is a cost/benefit analysis in\nconnection with states of knowledge. Although this idea has been\ninsufficiently explored by Peirce scholars, Peirce himself regarded it\nas central to the scientific method and to the idea of rational\nbehavior.  It is connected with what he called “speculative\nrhetoric” or “methodeutic” (which will be discussed\nbelow). \n\nAgainst powerful currents of determinism that derived from the\nEnlightenment philosophy of the eighteenth century, Peirce urged that\nthere was not the slightest scientific evidence for determinism and\nthat in fact there was considerable scientific evidence against\nit. Always by the words “science” and\n“scientific” Peirce understood reference to actual\npractice by scientists in the laboratory and the field, and not\nreference to entries in scientific textbooks. In attacking\ndeterminism, therefore, Peirce appealed to the evidence of the actual\nphenomena in laboratories and fields. Here, what is obtained as the\nactual observations (e.g. measurements) does not fit neatly into some\none point or simple function. If we take, for example, a thousand\nmeasurements of some physical quantity, even a simple one such as\nlength or thickness, no matter how carefully we may do so, we will not\nobtain the same result a thousand times. Rather, what we get is a\ndistribution (often, but not always and certainly not necessarily,\nsomething akin to a normal or Gaussian distribution) of hundreds of\ndifferent results. Again, if we measure the value of some variable\nthat we assume to depend on some given parameter, and if we let the\nparameter vary while we take successive measurements, the result in\ngeneral will not be a smooth function (for example, a straight line or\nan ellipse); rather, it will typically be a “jagged”\nresult, to which we can at best fit a smooth function by\nusing some clever method (for example, fitting a regression line by\nthe method of least-squares). Naively, we might imagine that the\nvariation and relative inexactness of our measurements will become\nless pronounced and obtrusive the more refined and microscopic are our\nmeasurement tools and procedures. Peirce, the practicing scientist,\nknew better. What actually happens, if anything, is that our\nvariations get relatively greater the finer is our instrumentation and\nthe more delicate our procedures.  (Obviously, Peirce would not have\nbeen the least surprised by the results obtained from measurements at\nthe quantum level.) \n\nWhat the directly measured facts of scientific practice seem to tell\nus, then, is that, although the universe displays varying degrees of\nhabit (that is to say, of partial, varying, approximate, and\nstatistical regularity), the universe does not display deterministic\nlaw. It does not directly show anything like total, exact,\nnon-statistical regularity. Moreover, the habits that nature does\ndisplay always appear in varying degrees of entrenchment or\n“congealing.” At one end of the spectrum, we have the nearly law-like\nbehavior of larger physical objects like boulders and planets; but at\nthe other end of the spectrum, we see in human processes of\nimagination and thought an almost pure freedom and spontaneity; and in\nthe quantum world of the very small we see the results of almost pure\nchance. \n\nThe immediate, “raw” result, then, of scientific\nobservation through measurement is that not everything is exactly\nfixed by exact law (even if everything should be constrained to some\ndegree by habit). In his earliest thinking about the significance of\nthis fact, Peirce opined that natural law pervaded the world but that\ncertain facets of reality were just outside the reach or grasp of\nlaw. In his later thinking, however, Peirce came to understand this\nfact as meaning that reality in its entirety was lawless and that pure\nspontaneity had an objective status in the phaneron. Peirce called his\ndoctrine that chance has an objective status in the universe\n“tychism,” a word taken from the Greek word for\n“chance” or “luck” or “what the gods\nhappen to choose to lay on one.” Tychism is a fundamental\ndoctrinal part of Peirce’s mature view, and reference to his tychism\nprovides an added reason for Peirce’s insisting on the irreducible\nfallibilism of inquiry. For nature is not a static world of unswerving\nlaw but rather a dynamic and dicey world of evolved and continually\nevolving habits that directly exhibit considerable\nspontaneity. (Peirce would have embraced quantum indeterminacy.) \n\nOne possible path along which nature evolves and acquires its habits\nwas explored by Peirce using statistical analysis in situations of \nexperimental trials in which the probabilities of outcomes in later trials \nare not independent of actual outcomes in earlier trials, situations of \nso-called “non-Bernoullian trials.” \nPeirce showed that, if we posit a certain primal habit\nin nature, viz. the tendency however slight to take on habits however\ntiny, then the result in the long run is often a high degree of\nregularity and great macroscopic exactness.  For this reason, Peirce\nsuggested that in the remote past nature was considerably more\nspontaneous than it has now become, and that in general and as a whole\nall the habits that nature has come to exhibit have evolved. Just \nas ideas, geological formations, and biological species have evolved, \nnatural habit has evolved. \n\nIn this evolutionary notion of nature and natural law we have an added\nsupport of Peirce’s insistence on the inherent fallibilism of\nscientific inquiry. Nature may simply change, even in its most\nentrenched fundamentals. Thus, even if scientists were at one point in\ntime to have conceptions and hypotheses about nature that survived\nevery attempt to falsify them, this fact alone would not ensure that\nat some later point in time these same conceptions and hypotheses\nwould remain accurate or even pertinent. \n\nAn especially intriguing and curious twist in Peirce’s evolutionism is\nthat in Peirce’s view evolution involves what he calls its\n“agapeism.” Peirce speaks of evolutionary love.  According\nto Peirce, the most fundamental engine of the evolutionary process is\nnot struggle, strife, greed, or competition. Rather it is nurturing\nlove, in which an entity is prepared to sacrifice its own perfection\nfor the sake of the wellbeing of its neighbor. This doctrine had a\nsocial significance for Peirce, who apparently had the intention of\narguing against the morally repugnant but extremely popular\nsocio-economic Darwinism of the late nineteenth century.  The doctrine\nalso had for Peirce a cosmic significance, which Peirce associated\nwith the doctrine of the Gospel of John and with the mystical ideas of\nSwedenborg and Henry James. In Part IV of the third of Peirce’s six\npapers in Popular Science Monthly, entitled “The\nDoctrine of Chances,” Peirce even argued that simply being\nlogical presupposes the ethics of self-sacrifice: “He who would\nnot sacrifice his own soul to save the whole world, is, as it seems to\nme, illogical in all his inferences, collectively.” To social\nDarwinism, and to the related sort of thinking that constituted for\nHerbert Spencer and others a supposed justification for the more\nrapacious practices of unbridled capitalism, Peirce referred in\ndisgust as “The Gospel of Greed.” \n\nAlong with Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor, Peirce was \none of the first scientific thinkers to argue in favor of the existence of \nactually infinite collections, and to maintain that the paradoxes that \nBernard Bolzano had associated with the idea of infinite collections were \nnot really contradictions at all. His criterion of the difference between finite \nand infinite collections was that the so-called “syllogism \nof transposed quantity,” which had been introduced \nby Augustus de Morgan, constituted a deductively valid\nargument only when applied to finite sets; as applied to infinite sets\nit was invalid.  The syllogism of transposed quantity runs as\nfollows. We have a binary relation R defined on a set\nS, such that the following two premises are true of the relation \n(where the quantifications are taken over the set\nS). First, for all x there is a y such that\nRxy. Second, for all x, y, z,\nRxz and Ryz implies that x = y. The\nconclusion (of the syllogism of transposed quantity) is that for all\nx there exists a y such that Ryx. One of\nPeirce’s favorite examples helps elucidate the idea, even if it\nperhaps be not perfectly politically correct: Every Texan kills some\nTexan; no Texan is killed by more than one Texan; therefore every\nTexan is killed by some Texan. The argument’s conclusion follows\nvalidly only if the set of Texans is finite. \n\nIf by Rxy in the syllogism of transposed quantity we take \nf(x) = y, where the function is defined on\nand has values in the set S, then the second premise of the \nsyllogism of transposed quantity says that f is a one-one function. \nThe conclusion says that every member of S is the image \nunder f of some member \nof S. Thus the syllogism of transposed quantity says that no one-one \nfunction can map the set S to a proper subset of itself. This \nassertion holds, of course, only if S is a finite set. So, as it turns \nout, Peirce’s definition of the difference between finite and infinite sets is \nvirtually equivalent to the standard one, which is found in Section 5 of Richard \nDedekind’s Was Sind und Was Sollen die Zahlen?, to the effect that an \ninfinite set is one that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with a \nproper subset of itself. Peirce claimed on various occasions to have \nreached his definition of the difference between finite and infinite collections \nat least six years before Dedekind reached his own definition. \n\nPeirce held that the continuity of space, time, ideation, feeling, and\nperception is an irreducible deliverance of science, and that an\nadequate conception of such continua is an extremely important part of\nall the sciences. The doctrine of the continuity of nature he called\n“synechism,” a word deriving from the Greek preposition\nthat means “(together) with.” In mid-1892, somewhat under\nthe influence of reading Cantor’s works, Peirce defined a (linear)\ncontinuum to be a linearly-ordered infinite set C such that\n(1) for any two distinct members of\nC there exists a third member of C that is strictly\nbetween these; and (2) every countably infinite subset of C\nthat has an upper (lower) bound in C has a least upper bound\n(greatest lower bound) in C. The first property he called\n“Kanticity” and the second “Aristotelicity.”\n(Today we would likely call these properties “density” and\n“closedness,” respectively.) The second condition has the\ncorollary that a continuum contains all its limit points, and\nsometimes Peirce used this property in conjunction with\n“Kanticity” to define a continuum. \n\nToward the end of the nineteenth century, however, Peirce began to\nhold that Kanticity and Aristotelicity, even when conjoined, were\ninsufficient to define adequately the notion of a continuum. He\nmaintained that he had framed an updated conception of continua by\nsomewhat loosening his attachment to Cantor’s ideas. He began to write\nin ways that, at least at first glance, seem close to falling into\nCantor’s Paradox; Peirce, however, tried to avoid outright\ncontradiction by means of embracing some sort of non-standard idea\nabout the identity of points on a line. For example, in Lecture 3 of\nhis Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898, published\nas Reasoning and the Logic of Things, Peirce says that if a\nline is cut into two portions, the point at which the cut takes place\nactually becomes two points. What Peirce’s new approach is, in\nmathematical detail, and whether or not it contains hidden but real\ncontradictions, is a problem that has not yet been solved by\nresearchers into Peirce’s logic and mathematics. \n\nConnected with his new conception of the continuum is Peirce’s\nincreasingly frequent and sometimes pugnacious defenses of the\ndoctrine of the reality of infinitesimal quantities. The doctrine was\nnot newly taken up by Peirce late in the nineteenth century; indeed,\nhe had held the doctrine for some time, and it had been the doctrine\nof his father Benjamin. He considered it superior to the newer\ndoctrine of limits for providing a foundation for the differential and\nintegral calculus. What was new was that Peirce began to see the\ndoctrine of infinitesimals as the key to his updated doctrine of the\ncontinuum. Thus, adding to his long-standing defense of infinitely\nlarge magnitudes (Peirce often used the word\n“multitudes.”), Peirce began vigorously to defend\ninfinitely small magnitudes, infinitesimal magnitudes.  Many examples\nof such defenses can be found. Carolyn Eisele collected a number of\nsuch examples in her edited work The New Elements of Mathematics\nby Charles S. Peirce. See, for example, Volume 2, pages\n169–170, where Peirce says “My personal opinion is that\nthere is positive evidence of the real existence of infinitesimals;\nand that the admission of them would considerably simplify the\nintroduction to the calculus.” See also Volume 3, Part 1, pages\n121–124, 125–127, 128–131, and 742–750. By the\nend of the nineteenth century Peirce’s view about infinitesimals was\nso rare and remarkable that Josiah Royce remarked, in a footnote of\nhis “Supplementary Essay” for The World and the\nIndividual, First Series, that outside of Italy Peirce was\nvirtually the only mathematical philosopher who believed in\ninfinitesimals. (See footnote 2, page 562 of this work by Royce.) \n\nNot only did Peirce defend infinitesimals. He furthermore claimed that he\nhad proved the consistency of introducing infinitesimals into the\nsystem of real numbers in such a way as to form a new system in which\nthere were infinitely many entities that were not equal to zero and\nyet were all smaller than any real number r that is not equal\nto zero, no matter how small r might be. To use modern\nterminology, Peirce was claiming to have shown the existence of\nordered fields that were non-Archimedean. It was these non-Archimedean\nfields that Peirce now wanted to call genuine continua.  Additionally,\nPeirce wanted to use his notion infinitesimal quantities and his\nrevised concept of the continuum in order to justify the traditional\npre-Gaussian definitions and underpinnings of the differential\ncalculus. \n\nPeirce also made a number of remarks that suggest, in connection with\nthe foregoing enterprise, that he had a novel conception of the\ntopology of points in a continuum. All these remarks he connected with\nhis previous defenses of infinite sets. For these reasons some Peirce\nscholars, and in particular the great Peirce scholar Carolyn Eisele,\nhave suggested that his ideas were an anticipation of Abraham\nRobinson’s non-standard analysis of 1964. Whether this actually be so\nor not, however, is at the present time far from clear. Peirce\ncertainly says many things that are quite suggestive of the\nconstruction of non-standard models of the theory of ordered fields by\nmeans of using equivalence classes of countably infinite Cartesian\nProducts of the standard real numbers and then applying Loś’s\nTheorem. However, no commentator up to now has provided anything even\nremotely resembling a careful and detailed exposition of Peirce’s\nthinking in this area. Unfortunately, most of Peirce’s published\nwriting and public talks on this topic were designed for audiences\nthat were extremely unsophisticated mathematically (a fact that he\nlamented).  For that reason most of what Peirce said on the topic is\npicturesque and intriguing, but extremely obscure. The entire analysis\nof Peirce’s notion of an infinitesimal, as well as the exact bearing\nthis notion has on his concept of a real continuum and on his idea of\nthe topology of the points of a continuum, still awaits meticulous\nmathematical discussion. \n\nGiven Peirce’s tychism and his view that statistical information is\noften the best information we can have about phenomena, it should not\nbe surprising that Peirce devoted close attention to the analysis of\nsituations in which perfect exactness and perfect certitude were\nunattainable. It is only to be expected that he would devote a great\ndeal of attention, for example, to probability theory. Indeed, Peirce\ndid so from the dates of even his earliest thinking. Not only, for\nexample, did he extensively employ the concept of probability, but\nalso he offered a pragmaticistic account of the notion of probability\nitself. Yet it would be a huge mistake to think that Peirce’s\nphilosophizing about situations of imperfection of exactness and\ncertitude were confined merely to the theory of probability. \n\nRather, from the outset of his thinking about the matters, in about\n1863, his attention was directed to the broadest sorts of issues\nconnected with statistical inference. And, as his thinking progressed,\nPeirce came ever more clearly to see that there are three distinct and\nmutually incommensurable measures of imperfection of certitude. Only\none was probability. The other two he called\n“verisimilitude” (or “likelihood”) and\n“plausibility”. Each of the three measures was associated\nwith one of his types of argument. Probability he associated with\ndeduction. Verisimilitude he associated with induction. And\nplausibility he associated with abduction. Let us look more closely at\neach of these three distinct measures of uncertainty. \n\nBy the time Peirce wrote on probability, the concept and its calculus\nwere well over two hundred years old. The probability calculus itself\nhad become more or less standardized by Peirce’s time, and indeed\nPeirce’s own axioms for the calculus are more or less the same that\nKolmogoroff gives for his “elementary theory of\nprobability.” By contrast with the calculus, the philosophical\ntheory of the meaning of probability was hotly disputed. Two sides to\nthe dispute existed. There were the subjectivists, or\n“conceptualists,” as Peirce designated them. These\nbelieved that probability was a measure of the strength of belief\nactually accorded to a proposition or a measure of the degree of\nrational belief that ought to be accorded to a proposition. Among the\ndefenders of this sort of view, Augustus de Morgan and Adolphe\nQuetelet were major figures.  And there were the objectivists, or\n“materialists,” as Peirce designated them. These believed\nthat probability was a measure of the relative frequency with which an\nevent of some specific sort repeatedly happened.  John Venn was a\nmajor defender of this sort of view. Pierre Simon Laplace had spoken\nsometimes in a subjectivist way, sometimes in an objectivist way; but\nhis arguments basically depended on a subjectivist interpretation of\nprobability. \n\nPeirce vigorously attacked the subjectivist view of de Morgan and\nothers to the effect that probability is merely a measure of our level\nof confidence or strength of belief. He allowed that the logarithm of\nthe odds of an event might be used to assess the degree of rational\nbelief that should be accorded to an event, but only provided that the\nodds of the event were determined by the objective relative frequency\nof the event. In other words, Peirce suggested that any justifiable\nuse of subjectivism in connection with probability theory must\nultimately rest on quantities obtained by means of an objectivist\nunderstanding of probability. \n\nRather than holding that probability is a measure of degree of\nconfidence or belief, then, Peirce adopted an objectivist notion of\nprobability that he explicitly likened to the doctrine of John\nVenn. Indeed, he even held that probability is actually a notion with\nclear empirical content and that there are clear empirical procedures\nfor ascertaining that content.  First, he held, that that to which a\nprobability is assigned, insofar as the notion of probability is used\nscientifically, is not a proposition or an event or a state; nor is it\na type of event or state.  Rather, what is assigned a probability is\nan argument, an argument having premisses (Peirce insisted on\nthis spelling rather than the spelling “premises.”) and a\nconclusion. Peirce’s view in this regard is virtually\nindistinguishable from the view of Kolmogoroff that all probabilities\nare conditional probabilities. Second, Peirce held that, in order to\nascertain the probability of a particular argument, the observer notes\nall occasions on which all of its premisses are true, case by case,\njust as they come under observation. For each of these occasions the\nobserver notes whether the conclusion is true or not. The observer\nkeeps a running tally, the ongoing ratio whose numerator is the number\nof occasions so far observed on which the conclusion as well as the\npremisses are true and whose denominator is the number of occasions so\nfar observed on which the premisses are true irrespective of whether\nor not the conclusion is also true. At each observation the observer\ncomputes this ratio, which obviously encompasses all the observer’s\npast observations of occasions on which the premisses are true. The\nprobability of the argument in question is defined by Peirce to be the\nlimit of the crucial ratio as the number of observations tends to grow\ninfinitely large (if this limit exists). \n\nPeirce’s earliest account of the meaning of probability, then, is a\nversion of what is called the “long run relative frequency\nview” of probability. Late in his philosophical career, about\n1910, Peirce found fault with his earliest views on account of their\nfailure to make clear just how the occasions of observation are to be\nchosen.  He also emphasized that probability judgments are judgments\nabout what he called “would-be’s.” For this reason Peirce\nis often considered to be the originator of the sort of\n“propensity view” of probability that is associated with\nKarl Popper. One should not, however, think that viewing Peirce as a\npropensity theorist is in conflict with viewing him as some sort of\nlong term relative frequency theorist. Rather, Peirce’s view seems to\nbe that the propensity in question, when its sense is spelled out in\naccord with the pragmatic (or: pragmaticistic) theory of meaning, is a\ndispositional property that manifests itself in the set of concrete\nfacts that amount to a certain long term relative frequency tending\ntoward a certain limit as the number of appropriate occasions of\nobservation increases indefinitely. \n\nThere is an interesting connection between Peirce’s tychism, his view that \nthere is objective spontaneity in the universe, and the foregoing account \nof probability. For Peirce understood the universe of appearances as a logical \nprocess, somewhat in the same manner that Hegel understood the universe of \nappearances as the phenomenology of spirit. He tended to consider a given \nstate of the universe as being a given set of premisses, so to say, of a \npossible inference. Then a subsequent state of the universe could be seen as \nbeing the conclusion of an actual inference. Thus Peirce tended to see the \nuniverse of appearances as bringing itself into being by a process \nthat is ultimately logical. The world, as it were, evolves by abducing,\ndeducing, and inducing itself. It is in some sense Hegel’s \n“Thought thinking thought.” \n\nAlong with his attack on a subjectivist account of probability, Peirce\nalso attacked the use of what came to be called the method of\n“inverse probabilities” as a way of solving the problem of\ninduction. In the process, he also excoriated the theoretical work, in\nthis connection, of de Morgan and Adolphe Quetelet (the Belgian\ncriminologist and early user of statistical analysis in\nsociology). Induction, as we have seen, Peirce counted as an inference\nfrom sample to population. The method of inverse probabilities offers\nitself as a way of calculating the (conditional) probability that a\npopulation has a trait in a certain proportion given that a sample\ndrawn from that population has the trait in that proportion. It\nproposes to calculate this conditional probability by applying the\nso-called “Bayes’s Theorem” in order to express it in\nterms of the (inverse conditional) probability that the sample has the\ntrait in the crucial proportion given that the population has the\ntrait in the crucial proportion. In the expression of the first\nconditional probability in terms of the second conditional\nprobability, however, there occur certain quantities, known as the\n“Bayesian prior probabilities.” What Peirce pointed out is\nthat there is no way to assign any quantities in a rational fashion to\nthe requisite Bayesian prior probabilities. The appearance that one\ndoes have a reason for assigning particular quantities results only\nfrom an illicit substitution of subjective probabilities for the\nneeded objectivist probabilities. What the user of the method of\ninverse probabilities does is to equate complete lack of information\nabout something with the claim that all possibilities must have equal\nprobabilities. This equation was called “the principle of\ninsufficient reason” in the nineteenth century; John Maynard\nKeynes later named it “the principle of indifference.”\nThis principle is, however, completely irrational without a dependence\non a subjectivist account of probability.  What we need, however, is\nobjective probabilities, and so we have no reason for assigning any\nparticular values to the Bayesian prior probabilities. Only “if\nuniverses were as plenty as blackberries,” wrote Peirce, would\nthe analysis of de Morgan and Quetelet make any sense. \n\nIn rejecting Bayesianism and the method of inverse probabilities,\nPeirce argued that in fact no probability at all can be assigned to\ninductive arguments. Instead of probability, a different measure of\nimperfection of certitude must be assigned to inductive arguments:\nverisimilitude or likelihood. In explaining this notion Peirce offered\nan account of hypothesis-testing that is equivalent to standard\nstatistical hypothesis-testing. In effect we get an account of\nconfidence intervals and choices of statistical significance for\nrejecting null hypotheses. Such ideas became standard only in the\ntwentieth century as a result of the work of R. A. Fisher, Jerzy\nNeyman, and others. But already by 1878, in his paper “The\nProbabilitiy of Induction,” Peirce had worked out the whole\nmatter. (This topic has been discussed expertly by Deborah Mayo, who\nalso has shown that the error-correction implicit in statistical\nhypothesis-testing is intimately affiliated with Peirce’s notion of\nscience as self-correcting and convergent to “the\ntruth.”) \n\nPeirce’s accounts of his third type of deviance from perfect\ncertitude, namely plausibility, are much sketchier than his accounts\nof probability and verisimilitude. Unlike the other two forms of\nuncertainty, which can be spelled out mathematically with great\nprecision, plausibility seems to be capable of only a qualitative\naccount, even though plausibility does seem to comes in greater and\nlesser degree.  The question of the plausibility of a claim arises,\napparently, only in contexts in which one is seeking to adduce an\nexplanatory hypothesis for some actual fact that is surprising. The\nkey point is that the hypothesis must be plausible in order to taken\nseriously.  If we were, for example, to come upon a lump of ice in the\nmiddle of a desert, we might plausibly say that perhaps someone put it\nthere, or perhaps a freak storm had left a great hailstone. But we\nwould not plausibly say that it had been thrown off a flying saucer\nthat previously had swooped through. It should be obvious that the\nnotion of plausibility is a difficult one, which strongly invites\nfurther analysis but which is not easy to analyze in technical\ndetail. \n\nPeirce held that science suggests that the universe has evolved from a\ncondition of maximum freedom and spontaneity into its present\ncondition, in which it has taken on a number of habits, sometimes more\nentrenched habits and sometimes less entrenched ones. With pure\nfreedom and spontaneity Peirce tended to associate mind, and with\nfirmly entrenched habits he tended to associate matter (or, more\ngenerally, the physical). Matter he tended to regard as\n“congealed” mind, and mind he tended to regard as\n“effete” matter. Thus he tended to see the universe as the\nend-product-so-far of a process in which mind has acquired habits and\nhas “congealed” (this is the very word Peirce used) into\nmatter. \n\nThis notion of all things as being evolved psycho-physical unities of\nsome sort places Peirce well within the sphere of what might be called\n“the grand old-fashioned metaphysicians,” along with such\nthinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel,\nSchopenhauer, Whitehead, et al. Some contemporary\nphilosophers might be inclined to reject Peirce out of hand upon\ndiscovering this fact. Others might find his notion of psycho-physical\nunities not so very offputting or indeed even attractive. What is\ncrucial is that Peirce argued that mind pervades all of nature in\nvarying degrees: it is not found merely in the most advanced animal\nspecies. \n\nThis pan-psychistic view, combined with his synechism, meant for Peirce\nthat mind is extended in some sort of continuum throughout the\nuniverse. Peirce tended to think of ideas as existing in mind in\nsomewhat the same way as physical forms exist in physically extended\nthings. He even spoke of ideas as “spreading” out through the same\ncontinuum in which mind is extended. This set of conceptions is part\nof what Peirce regarded as (his own version of) Scotistic realism,\nwhich he sharply contrasted with nominalism. He tended to blame what\nhe regarded as the errors of much of the philosophy of his\ncontemporaries as owing to its nominalistic disregard for the\nobjective existence of form. \n\nMerely to say that Peirce was extremely fond of placing things into\ngroups of three, of trichotomies, and of triadic relations, would fail\nmiserably to do justice to the overwhelming obtrusiveness in his\nphilosophy of the number three. Indeed, he made the most fundamental\ncategories of all “things” of any sort whatsoever the\ncategories of “Firstness,” “Secondness,” and\n“Thirdness,” and he often described “things”\nas being “firsts” or “seconds” or\n“thirds.” For example, with regard to the trichotomy\n“possibility,” “actuality,” and\n“necessity,” possibility he called a first, actuality he\ncalled a second, and necessity he called a third. Again: quality was a\nfirst, fact was a second, and habit (or rule or law) was a\nthird. Again: entity was a first, relation was a second, and\nrepresentation was a third. Again: rheme (by which Peirce meant a\nrelation of arbitrary adicity or arity) was a first, proposition was a\nsecond, and argument was a third. The list goes on and on. Let us\nrefer to Peirce’s penchant for describing things in terms of\ntrichotomies and triadic relations as Peirce’s\n“triadism.” \n\nIf Peirce had a general technical rationale for his triadism, Peirce\nscholars have not yet made it abundantly clear what this rationale\nmight be. He seemed to base his triadism on what he called\n“phaneroscopy,” by which word he meant the mere\nobservation of phenomenal appearances. He regularly commented that the\nphenomena in the phaneron just do fall into three groups and\nthat they just do display irreducibly triadic relations. He\nseemed to regard this matter as simply open for verification by direct\ninspection. \n\nAlthough there are many examples of phenomena that do seem more or\nless naturally to divide into three groups, Peirce seems to have been\ndriven by something more than mere examples in his insistence on\napplying his categories to almost everything imaginable. Perhaps it\nwas the influence of Kant, whose twelve categories divide into four\ngroups of three each. Perhaps it was the triadic structure of the\nstages of thought as described by Hegel. Perhaps it was even the\ntriune commitments of orthodox Christianity (to which Peirce, at least\nin some contexts and during some swings of mood, seemed to\nsubscribe). Certainly involved was Peirce’s commitment to the\nineliminability of mind in nature, for Peirce closely associated the\nactivities of mind with the aforementioned triadic relation that he called\nthe “sign” relation. (More on this topic appears below.)\nAlso involved was Peirce’s so-called “reduction thesis” in\nlogic (on which more will given below), to which Peirce had concluded\nas early as 1870. \n\nIt is difficult to imagine even the most fervently devout of the\npassionate admirers of Peirce, of which there are many, saying that\nhis account (or, more accurately, his various accounts) of the three\nuniversal categories is (or are) absolutely clear and compelling. Yet,\nin almost everything Peirce wrote from the time the categories were\nfirst introduced, Peirce’s firsts, seconds, and thirds found a\nplace. Giving their exact and general analysis and providing an exact\nand general account of their rationale, if there be such, constitute\nchief problems in Peirce scholarship. \n\nConnected with Peirce’s insistence on the ubiquity of mind in the\ncosmos is the importance he attached to what he called\n“semeiotic,” the theory of signs in the most general\nsense. Although a few points concerning this subject were made earlier\nin this article, some further discussion is in order. What Peircean\nmeant by “semeiotic” is almost totally different from what\nhas come to be called “semiotics,” and which hails not so\nmuch from Peirce as from Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles\nW. Morris. Even though Peircean semeiotic and semiotics are often\nconfused, it is important not to do so.  Peircean semeiotic derives\nultimately from the theory of signs of Duns Scotus and its later\ndevelopment by John of St. Thomas (John Poinsot).  In Peirce’s theory\nthe sign relation is a triadic relation that is a special species of\nthe genus: the representing relation. Whenever the representing\nrelation has an instance, we find one thing (the “object”)\nbeing represented by (or: in) another thing (the\n“representamen”) and being represented to (or: in) a third\nthing (the “interpretant.”) Moreover, the object is\nrepresented by the representamen in such a way that the interpretant\nis thereby “determined” to be also a representamen of the\nobject to yet another interpretant. That is to say, the interpretant\nstands in the representing relation to the same object represented by\nthe original representamen, and thus the interpretant represents the\nobject (either again or further) to yet another\ninterpretant. Obviously, Peirce’s complicated definition entails that\nwe have an infinite sequence of representamens of an object whenever\nwe have any one representamen of it. \n\nThe sign relation is the special species of the representing relation\nthat obtains whenever the first interpretant (and consequently each\nmember of the whole infinite sequence of interpretants) has a status\nthat is mental, i.e. (roughly) is a cognition of a mind. In\nany instance of the sign relation an object is signified by a sign to\na mind. One of Peirce’s central tasks was that of analyzing all\npossible kinds of signs. For this purpose he introduced various\ndistinction among signs, and discussed various ways of classifying\nthem. \n\nOne set of distinctions among signs was introduced by Peirce in the\nearly stages of his analysis. The distinctions in this set turn on\nwhether the particular instance of the sign relation is\n“degenerate” or “non-degenerate.” The notion\nof “degeneracy” here is the standard mathematical notion,\nand as applied to sign theory non-degeneracy means simply that the\ntriadic relation cannot be analyzed as a logical conjunction of any\ncombination of dyadic relations and monadic relations. More exactly, a\nparticular instance of the obtaining of the sign relation is\ndegenerate if and only if the fact that a sign\ns means an object o to an interpretant i\ncan be analyzed into a conjunction of facts of the form\nP(s) & Q(o) &\nR(i) & T(s,o) &\nU(o,i) &\nW(i,s) (where not all the conjuncts have to\nbe present). Either an obtaining of the sign relation is\nnon-degenerate, in which case it falls into one class; or it is\ndegenerate in various possible ways (depending on which of the\nconjuncts are omitted and which retained), in which cases it falls\ninto various other classes.  Other distinctions regarding signs were\nintroduced later by Peirce. Some of them will be discussed very\nbriefly in the following section of this article. \n\nPeirce’s settled opinion was that logic in the broadest sense is to be\nequated with semeiotic (the general theory of signs), and that logic\nin a much narrower sense (which he typically called “logical\ncritic”) is one of three major divisions or parts of\nsemeiotic. Thus, in his later writings, he divided semeiotic into\nspeculative grammar, logical critic, and speculative rhetoric (also\ncalled “methodeutic”). Peirce’s word\n“speculative” is his Latinate version of the Greek-derived\nword “theoretical,” and should be understood to mean\nexactly what the word “theoretical” means.  Peirce’s\ntripartite division of semeiotic is not to be confused with Charles\nW. Morris’s division: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics (although\nthere may be some commonalities in the two trichotomies). \n\nBy speculative grammar Peirce understood the analysis of the kinds of\nsigns there are and the ways that they can be combined\nsignificantly. For example, under this heading he introduced three\ntrichotomies of signs and argued for the real possibility of only\ncertain kinds of signs. Signs are qualisigns, sinsigns, or legisigns,\naccordingly as they are mere qualities, individual events and states,\nor habits (or laws), respectively. Signs are icons, indices (also\ncalled “semes”), or symbols (sometimes called\n“tokens”), accordingly as they derive their significance\nfrom resemblance to their objects, a real relation (for example, of\ncausation) with their objects, or are connected only by convention to\ntheir objects, respectively. Signs are rhematic signs (also called\n“sumisigns” and “rhemes”), dicisigns (also\ncalled “quasi-propositions”), or arguments (also called\n“suadisigns”), accordingly as they are\npredicational/relational in character, propositional in character, or\nargumentative in character. Because the three trichotomies are\nindependent of each other, together they yield the abstract possibility\nthat there are 27 distinct kinds of signs.  Peirce argued, however,\nthat 17 of these are logically impossible, so that finally only 10\nkinds of signs are genuinely possible. In terms of these 10 kinds of\nsigns, Peirce endeavored to construct a theory of all possible natural\nand conventional signs, whether simple or complex. \n\nWhat Peirce meant by “logical critic” is pretty much logic\nin the ordinary, accepted sense of “logic” from\nAristotle’s logic to present-day mathematical logic. As might be\nexpected, a crucial concern of logical critic is to characterize the\ndifference between correct and incorrect reasoning. Peirce achieved\nextraordinarily extensive and deep results in this area, and a few of\nhis accomplishments in this area will be discussed below. \n\nBy “speculative rhetoric” or “methodeutic”\nPeirce understood all inquiry into the principles of the effective use\nof signs for producing valuable courses of research and giving\nvaluable expositions.  Methodeutic studies the methods that\nresearchers should use in investigating, giving expositions of, and\ncreating applications of the truth. Peirce also understood, under the\nheading of speculative rhetoric, the analysis of communicational\ninteractions and strategies, and their bearing on the evaluation of\ninferences. Peirce’s important topic of the economy of research is\nclosely affiliated with his idea of speculative rhetoric.  The idea of\nmethodeutic may overlap to some small extent with Morris’s notion of\n“pragmatics,” but the spirit of Peirce’s notion is much\nmore extensive than that of Morris’s notion.  Moreover, Peirce handled\nthe notion of indexical reference under the heading of speculative\ngrammar and not under the heading of speculative rhetoric, whereas the\ntopic certainly belongs to Morris’s pragmatics. There clearly exist connections \nbetween Peirce’s speculative rhetoric, on the one hand, and the attention paid \nby twentieth-century philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and J. L. Austin \nto matters having to do with language as a set of various social practices. \nUnfortunately, however, little attention has been paid by Peirce scholars \nto the relations between Peirce’s thinking and familiar twentieth-century \nnotions such as Wittgenstein’s language-games and Austin’s speech-acts. \n\nSpeculative rhetoric, however, has attracted considerable\nphilosophical attention in recent years, especially among Finnish\nPeirce scholars centering about the University of Helsinki. These have\nnoted that there are extensive affiliations between Peirce’s\ndiscussions of the communicational and dialogical aspects of\nsemeiotic, on the one hand, and the many and varied\n“game-theoretical” approaches to logic that have been for\nsome time of interest to Finnish philosophers (as well as many\nothers), on the other hand. Various proposals for game-theoretic\nsemantical approaches to logic have been developed and applied to\nPeirce’s logic, as well as being used to understand Peircean\npoints. \n\nPeirce maintained a considerable interest in the topic of\nclassification or taxonomy in general, and he considered biology and\ngeology the foremost sciences to have made progress in developing\ngenuinely useful systems of classification for things. In his own\ntheory of classification, he seemed to regard some sort of cluster\nanalysis as holding the key to creating really useful\nclassifications. He regularly strove to create a classification of all\nthe sciences that would be as useful to logic as the taxonomies of the\nbiologists and geologists were to these scientists.  Of special\ninterest in this regard is the fact that he considered the relation of\nsimilarity to be a triadic relation, rather than a dyadic\nrelation. Thus, for Peirce taxonomies and taxonomic trees are only one\nsort of classificatory system, albeit the most highly-developed\none. He would not be in the least surprised to find that the topic of\nconstructing “ontologies” is in vogue among computer\nscientists, and he would applaud endeavors to construct ontologies. He\nwould not find in the least alien many contemporary analytic\ndiscussions of the notion of similarity; he would be right at home\namong them. \n\nAs with many of Peirce’s classificatory divisions, his classification\nof the sciences is a taxonomy whose tree is trinary. For example he\nclassifies all the sciences into those of discovery, review, and\npracticality.  Sciences of discovery he divides into mathematics,\nphilosophy, and what he calls “idioscopy” (by which he\nseems to mean the class of all the particular or special sciences like\nphysics, psychology, and so forth).  Mathematics he divides into\nmathematics of logic, of discrete series, and of continua and\npseudo-continua. Philosophy he divides into phenomenology, normative\nscience, and metaphysics. Normative science he divides into\naesthetics, ethics, and logic. And so on and on.  Very occasionally\nthere is found a binary division: for example, he divides idioscopy\ninto the physical sciences and the psychical (or human) sciences. But,\nhardly surprisingly given his penchant for triads, most of his\ndivisions are into threes. \n\nPeirce scholars have found the topic of Peirce’s classification of the\nsciences a fertile ground for assertions about what is most basic in\nall thinking, in Peirce’s view. Whether or not such assertions run\nafoul of Peirce’s anti-foundationalism is itself a topic for further\nstudy. \n\nIn the extensiveness and originality of his contributions to\nmathematical logic, Peirce is almost without equal. His writings and\noriginal ideas are so numerous that there is no way to do them justice\nin a small article such as the present one. Accordingly, only a few of\nhis numerous achievements will be mentioned here. \n\nPeirce’s special strength lay not so much in theorem-proving as rather\nin the invention and developmental elaboration of novel systems of\nlogical syntax and fundamental logical concepts. He invented dozens of\ndifferent systems of logical syntax, including a syntax based on a\ngeneralization of de Morgan’s relative product operation, an algebraic\nsyntax that mirrored Boolean algebra to some extent, a\nquantifier-and-variable syntax that (except for its specific symbols)\nis identical to the much later Russell-Whitehead syntax. He even\ninvented two systems of graphical two-dimensional syntax. The first,\nthe so-called “entitative graphs,” is based on disjunction\nand negation. A version of the entitative graphs later appeared in\nG. Spencer Brown’s Laws of Form, without anything remotely\nlike proper citation of Peirce. A second, and better, system of\ngraphical two-dimensional syntax followed: the so-called\n“existential graphs.” This system is based on conjunction\nand negation. Even though the syntax is two dimensional, the surface\nit actually requires in its most general form is a torus of finite\ngenus. So, the system of existential graphs actually requires three\ndimensions for its representations, although the third dimension in\nwhich the torus is embedded can usually be represented in two\ndimensions by the use of pictorial devices that Peirce called\n“fornices” or “tunnel-bridges” and by the use\nof identificational devices that Peirce called\n“selectives.” The existential graphs are essentially a\nsyntax for logic that uses the whole mathematical apparatus of\ntopological graph theory. There are three parts of it: alpha (for\npropositional logic), beta (for quantificational logic with identity\nbut without functions), and gamma (for modal logic and\nmeta-logic). \n\nIn 1870 Peirce published a long paper “Description of a Notation\nfor the Logic of Relatives” in which he introduced for the first\ntime in history, two years before Frege’s Begriffschrift a\ncomplete syntax for the logic of relations of arbitrary adicity (or:\narity). In this paper the notion of the variable (though not under the\nname “variable”) was invented, and Peirce provided devices\nfor negating, for combining relations (basically by building upon de\nMorgan’s relative product and relative sum), and for quantifying\nexistentially and universally.  By 1883, along with his student\nO. H. Mitchell, Peirce had developed a full syntax for\nquantificational logic that was only a very little different (as was\nmentioned just above) from the standard Russell-Whitehead syntax,\nwhich did not appear until 1910 (with no adequate citations of\nPeirce). \n\nPeirce introduced the material-conditional operator into logic,\ndeveloped the Sheffer stroke and dagger operators 40 years before\nSheffer, and developed a full logical system based only on the stroke\nfunction. As Garret Birkhoff notes in his Lattice Theory it\nwas in fact Peirce who invented the concept of a lattice (around\n1883).  (Quite possibly, it is Peirce’s lattice theory that holds the\nkey to his technical theory of infinitesimals and the continuum.) \n\nDuring his years teaching at Johns Hopkins University, Peirce began to\nresearch the four-color map conjecture, to work on the graphical\nmathematics of de Morgan’s associate A. B. Kempe, and to develop\nextensive connections between logic. algebra, and topology, especially\ntopological graph theory. Ultimately these researches bore fruit in\nhis existential graphs, but his writings in this area also contain a\nconsiderable number of other valuable ideas and results. He hinted\nthat he had made great progress in the theory of provability and\nunprovability by exploring the connections between logic and\ntopology. \n\nPeirce’s so-called “Reduction Thesis” is the thesis that\nall relations, relations of arbitrary adicity, may be constructed from\ntriadic relations alone, whereas monadic and dyadic relations alone\nare not sufficient to allow the construction of even a single\n“non-degenerate” (that is: non-Cartesian-factorable)\ntriadic relation. Although the germ of his argument for the Reduction\nThesis lay in his 1870 paper “Description of a Notation for the\nLogic of Relatives,” the Thesis was for over a century doubted\nby many, especially after the publication of a proof by Willard Van\nOrman Quine that all relations could be constructed exclusively from\ndyadic ones. As it turns out, both Peirce and Quine were correct: the\nissue entirely depends on exactly what constructive resources are to\nbe allowed to be used in building relations out of other\nrelations. (Obviously, the more extensive and powerful are the\nconstructive resources, the more likely it is that all relations can\nbe constructed from dyadic ones alone by using them.) An exact\nexposition and proof of Peirce’s Reduction Thesis was finally\naccomplished in 1988 (Burch 1991), and it makes clear that Peirce’s\nconstructive resources are to be understood to include only negation,\na generalization of de Morgan’s relative product operation, and the\nuse of a particular triadic relation that Peirce called “the\nteridentity relation” and that we might today write as x = y\n= z. \n\nPeirce felt that the teridentity relation was in some way more\nprimitive logically and thus more fundamental than the usual dyadic\nidentity relation x = y, which he derived from two instances\nof the triadic identity relation by two applications of the relative\nproduct operation of de Morgan. Peirce also felt that de Morgan’s\nrelative product operation was logically a more primitive and\nfundamental operation than, say, the Boolean product or the Boolean\nsum. The full philosophical import of his Reduction Thesis, and the\nphilosophical importance of his triadism insofar as this triadism\nrests on his Reduction Thesis, cannot be ascertained without a prior\nunderstanding of his non-typical theory of identity and his special\nview of the fundamental nature of the relative product operation. \n\nCurrently, considerable interest is being taken in Peirce’s ideas by\nresearchers wholly outside the arena of academic philosophy. The\ninterest comes from industry, business, technology, intelligence\norganizations, and the military; and it has resulted in the existence\nof a substantial number of agencies, institutes, businesses, and\nlaboratories in which ongoing research into and development of\nPeircean concepts are being vigorously undertaken. \n\nThis interest arose, originally, in two ways. First, some thirty years\nago in the former Soviet Union interest in Peirce and Karl Popper had\nled logicians and computer scientists like Victor Konstantinovich Finn\nand Dmitri Pospelov to try to find ways in which computer programs\ncould generate Peircean hypotheses (Popperian\n“conjectures”) in “semeiotic” contexts\n(non-numerical or qualitative contexts). Under the guide in particular\nof Finn’s intelligent systems laboratory in VINITI-RAN (the\nAll-Russian Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences), elaborate techniques for automatic\ngeneration of hypotheses were found and were extensively utilized for\nmany practical purposes. Finn called his approach to hypothesis\ngeneration the “JSM Method of Automatic Hypothesis\nGeneration” (so named for similarities to John Stuart Mill’s\nmethods for identifying causes).  Among the purposes for which the JSM\nMethod has proved fruitful are sociological prediction,\npharmacological discovery, and the analysis of processes of industrial\nproduction. Interest in Finn’s work, and through it in the practical\napplication of Peirce’s philosophy, has spread to France, Germany,\nDenmark, Finland, and ultimately the United States. \n\nSecond, as the limits of expert systems and production rule\nprogramming in the area of artificial intelligence became increasingly\nclear to computer scientists, they began to search for methods beyond\nthose that depended merely on imitating experts. One promising line of\nresearch has been to automate phases of (Peirce’s concept of) the\nscientific method, complete with techniques for hypothesis generation\nand making assessments of the costs and benefits of exploring\nhypotheses. In some areas of research added impetus has been provided\nby the similarity of Peircean techniques to techniques that have\nalready proven useful. For example, in the field of automated\nmulti-track radar, the similarity of Peircean scientific method to the\nso-called “Kalman filter” has been noted by many systems\nanalysts. Again, those interested in military command-and-control\noften note the similarity of Peircean scientific method to the classic\nOODA loop (“observe, orient, decide, act”) of\ncommand-and-control-theory. The aerospace industry, especially in\nFrance and the United States, is currently investigating Peircean\nideas in connection with avionics systems that monitor aircraft\n“health.” \n\nAlmost simultaneously with Finn’s development of Automatic Generation\nof Hypotheses, German mathematicians Rudolf Wille and Bernhardt Ganter\nwere developing an aspect of Galois Theory and lattice theory (the\nlatter being, as was said, Peirce’s invention) that came to be known\nas “Formal Concept Analysis.” Interestingly enough, even though the\ntwo groups of researchers initially were working completely\nindependently of each other, the mathematical apparatus of Finn’s\nAutomatic Generation of Hypotheses is at its core the very same\napparatus as that of Wille’s and Ganter’s Formal Concept Analysis.\nFor obvious reasons, then, there has now grown up an extensive\ncooperation between the German researchers and the Russian\nresearchers, principally through the writings and intermediary work of\nSergei Kuznetsov, who has been working both with the German group and\nwith the Russian group. \n\nThe heart of both sets of ideas is the notion of clustering items by\nsimilarity. The algorithms for clustering into formal concepts are the\nsame as the algorithms for preliminary groupings by similarity for the\npurpose of automatically generating hypotheses. As it turns out, and\nas Kuznetsov has shown, these algorithms are equivalent in their\neffect to algorithms for finding the maximal complete subgraphs of\narbitrary graphs. This fact has proved extremely useful in recent\nyears, since the latter algorithms are the core of what has come to be\nknown as “Social Network Analysis.” And Social Network Analysis has\nbecome a major intellectual tool in the world’s battles against\ncriminal organizations and terrorist networks. So all three sets of\nideas have become matters of crucial practical importance and even\nurgency in contemporary affairs. \n\nSuch practical applications of Peircean ideas may seem surprising to\nmany philosophers whose minds are rooted strictly in the academic\nworld. The applications, however, most certainly would not have\nsurprised Peirce in the least. Indeed, given his lifelong ideas and\ngoals as a scientist-philosopher, he probably would have found the\ncurrent practical importance of his ideas entirely to be expected. \n\nDuring the time of Peirce’s teaching logic at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, that is: during the years from 1879 through 1884, Peirce\nhad a number of students in logic who then went on to establish\nsignificant reputations in their own right. Often mentioned in this\nconnection are John Dewey, Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd-Franklin,\nOscar Howard Mitchell, Benjamin I. Gilman, Fabian Franklin, and \nThorstein Veblen. Here we provide brief descriptions of\nthree of these students, Dewey, Ladd-Franklin, and Mitchell. Of\nnecessity the accounts given here of the work of these students will\nbe extremely brief. It is obvious that full-length accounts of each of\nthem can be given, and in the case of one of them, John Dewey,\nfull-length accounts have, indeed, often been given. \n\nWithout a doubt, the best known of all Peirce’s students, even including \nThorstein Veblen, is John Dewey (1859–1952). \nDewey attended Peirce’s logic class at John’s\nHopkins during the years 1882 through 1883. Along with Peirce, Dewey\nunderstood the subject of logic in an extremely broad way, so that the\nsubject in his mind, as well as in Peirce’s mind, comprised the entire\ntopic of the methodology of the exact sciences. It is not surprising,\nthen, that the structure of logic in Dewey’s own works in logic,\nviz. most notably in his book Logic: the Theory of Inquiry\n(1938), is a close approximation of the structure of the scientific\nmethod as Peirce understands it. Recall that for Peirce inquiry begins\nwith an anomalous situation, in which a particular puzzle or set of\npuzzles is elicited from an indeterminate background. Then, by an\nongoing, and in fact ultimately endless, process, hypotheses are\nformulated (abduction) and tested (deduction and induction). so that\nat each iteration of the methodological “loop,” indeterminacy as to\nthe original anomalous situation is successively, though never\ntotally, eliminated. Dewey’s own account of inquiry, especially\ninsofar as Dewey considers it to be the successive elimination of\nindeterminacy, is remarkably akin to Peirce’s account of scientific\nmethodology in action. Of course there are differences. Dewey often\nwrites as though at each stage of development of the method of logic\n(of science) the next stage is more or less already specified; for\nexample, at any stage of indeterminacy, Dewey writes as if the\nrelevant hypothesis or hypotheses to test at the next stage are more\nor less already determined. By contrast, Peirce (although he sometimes\nspeaks this way) more often emphasizes the creative and non-determined\naspect of eliciting/developing hypotheses. Nevertheless, even despite\nthe differences in emphasis from Peirce to Dewey, the similarities\nbetween their positions are unmistakeable. \n\nUnlike Dewey, both Christine Ladd and Oscar Howard Mitchell\nconcentrated on formal deductive logic, i.e. mathematical logic,\nrather than on the informal methodology of the sciences. Also unlike\nDewey, Ladd and Mitchell both published articles in the 1883\nvolume Studies in Logic, which was edited by Peirce. Again,\nin his own “Preface” to this volume Peirce singles out\nboth Ladd and Mitchell for commentary and overt praise\n(p. v). To these two students of Peirce we now turn. \n\nChristine Ladd, born December 1, 1847, was later (from her marriage to\nFabian Franklin in 1882) known as Christine Ladd-Franklin. Although\nshe is almost unknown today, she was very well-known and\nhighly-regarded as a mathematician, logician, and psychologist from\nthe 1870s until her death on March 5, 1930 at the age of 82. Her\nearliest published work was in mathematics, in the Educational\nTimes of England. Here it attracted the attention of the great\nmathematician J. J. Sylvester, who also published in the \nEducational Times and who in 1876 assumed the position of the\nfirst professor of mathematics at the new Johns Hopkins\nUniversity. (It was Sylvester who hired Peirce in 1879.) On the\nstrength of her already-published work, as known by Sylvester, Ladd\napplied to Johns Hopkins in 1888 to become a graduate student in\nmathematics.  Although, because she was a woman, she could not become\na regular graduate student at Johns Hopkins, still at the ardent and\ninsistent urgings of Sylvester, she was admitted as a special-status\nstudent, and she was even awarded a fellowship to study\nmathematics. She held this fellowship from 1879 until 1882, when she\ncompleted all the requirements for the Ph.D. degree. It was during\nthis period that she became attracted to mathematical logic, and to\nthe teachings on logic of Peirce, with whom she studied\ncarefully. Because of her gender, her status as a student of\nmathematics was recorded only in notes rather than on the usual\nstudent lists. For the same reason, she could not actually be given\nthe Ph.D. degree in 1882, although she was ultimately (but not until\n1926), awarded the Ph.D. degree in mathematics. (Meanwhile, Vassar\nCollege awarded her an LL.D. degree in 1887.) On August 24, 1882, upon\nthe completion of her mathematics fellowship, she married a member of\nthe Johns Hopkins department of mathematics and a fellow-student of\nPeirce’s, Fabian Franklin (b. 1853, d. 1939). Both she and Fabian\nFranklin seem to have stayed closely connected to Peirce until his\ndeath in 1914. \n\nAs can be gathered from the foregoing, it was studying with Peirce\nthat focussed Ladd’s attention from mathematics in general to\nmathematical logic (also called symbolic logic) in particular.  Ladd’s\nbest-known, and most-celebrated work was her paper “On the Algebra of\nLogic,” published in Studies in Logic by the members of the Johns\nHopkins University (C. S. Peirce, editor), Little, Brown, 1883,\npp. 17–71. In it, she is (or at least was once) widely regarded\nas having achieved for the first time in history a completely general\nand unified account of the Aristotelian syllogism, including a general\naccount of the differences between valid and invalid\nsyllogisms. (Josiah Royce, for example, held this view of\nLadd-Franklin’s work in logic.) It is thus worth looking in some\ndetail at how she achieves this result through the algebraizing of the\nsyllogism, but here such detail will not be entered into. Basically,\nhowever, we can say that her basic idea is to associate with each\npossible syllogism a certain “triad”. The syllogism is\nvalid if and only if the “triad” is an\n“antilogism,” that is to say, is an inconsistent\n“triad”. Ladd-Franklin wrote on the antilogism as late as\n1928 in volume 37 of Mind, pp. 532–534. Whether or not\nher work is really the first work to unify the theory of the\nsyllogism, and whether or not she ultimately merits the exalted status\nas a logician that Royce assigns to her must remain a task for future\nexploration to determine. \n\nIn addition to her major work on the syllogism, equivalently on the\nnotion of the antilogism, Ladd-Franklin as well wrote some of the\nentries in the three-volume work of James Mark Baldwin\n(1861–1934), Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology,\n1901–1905, for example the entries “syllogism,”\n“symbolic logic,” and “algebra of logic.” In\nfact she was an associate editor of Baldwin’s Dictionary. She\nalso wrote at least one related paper in the Journal of\nPhilosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Method, later named simply\nthe Journal of Philosophy. \n\nPeirce praised O. H. Mitchell as being his very best student in\nlogic. Mitchell was trained as a mathematician even befoe coming to\nJohns Hopkins, and he was especially noted by all those who knew him\nas being extraordinarily meticulous and attentive to detail. He was so\nattentive to exactitude that he was even noted for slowness and\nponderousness in speech. But what was there in Mitchell’s 1883 paper\nthat stimulated Peirce’s high praise? It seems to be closely\nconnected, perhaps identical, with what Peirce praises Mitchell for\naccomplishing in Peirce’s entry in Baldwin’s Dictionary of\nPhilosophy and Psychology, particularly in his article there for\nthe word “dimension.” In the article Peirce credits\nMitchell with having introduced “the concept of a\nmultidimensional logical universe” into exact logic, and Peirce\nclaims that it is one of the “fecund contributions” that\nMitchell made to exact logic. There seem to be two components to the\nidea of a multidimensional logical universe. The first one is simply\nthe idea of multiple quantification in connection with polyadic\npredicates, so that (in modern terminology) we can have propositions\nwith quantifiers occurring within the scope of other quantifiers. That\nMitchell employs a formalism suggestive of this idea is undeniable,\nbut whether he successfully distinguishes (for all x)(there\nexists a y) from (there exists a y)(for\nall x) is very much less than obvious. Moreover, that\nMitchell was the very first logician to have conceived of multiple\nquantification and polyadic predicates seems a bit dubious, especially\nsince by 1870 Peirce himself was already making use of notions for\nwhich multiple quantification and polyadic predicates are\ninvolved. The second component of the idea of a multidimensional\nlogical universe is (again, using modern terminology) the idea that\nthe universe of discourse relevant to one variable might not be the\nsame as the universe of discourse relevant to another\nvariable. Moreover, since the universe of discourse relevant to one\nvariable might be all the times there are, all the places there are,\nall possible situations, or even all possible worlds, it is not\ndifficult (though it is perhaps a bit far-fetched) to connect\nMitchell’s idea of a multidimensional logical universe to the idea of\ntense logic or even modal logic. Whether a careful study of Mitchell’s\nlogical contribution really supports such a reading of Mitchell’s\ncontributions to logic is not as yet clearly determined. \n\nClearly, close study of the logical accomplishments of Peirce’s\nnotable students is in order."}]
