Methodological naturalists (M-naturalists) view\nphilosophy as continuous with empirical inquiry in the sciences. Some\nM-naturalists want to replace conceptual and justificatory\ntheories with empirical and descriptive theories; they take their\ninspiration from more-or-less Quinean arguments against conceptual\nanalysis and foundationalist programs. Other M-naturalists retain the\nnormative and regulative ambitions of traditional philosophy,\nbut emphasize that it is an empirical question what normative\nadvice is actually useable and effective for creatures like us. Some\nM-naturalists are also substantive naturalists\n(S-naturalists). Ontological S-naturalism is the view that there exist\nonly natural or physical things; semantic\nS-naturalism is the view that a suitable philosophical analysis of any\nconcept must show it to be amenable to empirical inquiry. Each of\nthese varieties of naturalism has applications in legal philosophy.\nReplacement forms of M-naturalism hold that: (1) conceptual\nanalysis of the concept of law should be replaced by reliance on the\nbest social scientific explanations of legal phenomena, and (2)\nnormative theories of adjudication should be replaced by empirical\ntheories. These views are associated with American Legal Realism and\nBrian Leiter’s reinterpretation of Realism. Normative\nM-naturalists, by contrast, inspired and led by Alvin Goldman, seek to\nbring empirical results to bear on philosophical and foundational\nquestions about adjudication, the legal rules of evidence and\ndiscovery, the adversarial process, and so forth. Within legal\nphilosophy, S-naturalism has featured most prominently in the writings\nof the Scandinavian Legal Realists (long predating the resurgence of\nnaturalism in Anglophone jurisprudence), whose Ontological\nS-naturalism led them to employ a familiar range of\nnaturalism-motivated explanatory strategies, including naturalistic\nreduction of legal concepts and non-cognitivist accounts of important\naspects of legal discourse. S-naturalism also can serve, and sometimes\nhas served, as a motivation for Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American\njurisprudential tradition. More recent forms of S-naturalism,\nassociated with a revival of a kind of natural law theory defended by\nDavid Brink and Michael Moore (among others), applies the\n“new” or “causal” theory of reference to\nquestions of legal interpretation, including the interpretation of\nmoral concepts as they figure in legal rules.\n\nDifferent philosophical doctrines travel under the heading of\n“naturalism.” We can usefully distinguish two broad and\nimportant categories: methodological (or M-naturalism) and\nsubstantive (or S-naturalism) (Leiter 1998; cf. Railton 1990\nand Goldman 1994). Naturalism in philosophy is most often a\nmethodological view to the effect that philosophical\ntheorizing should be continuous with empirical inquiry in the\nsciences. Such a view need not presuppose a solution to the so-called\n“demarcation problem”—i.e., the problem of what\ndemarcates genuine science from pseudo-science—as long as there\nremain clear, paradigmatic cases of successful sciences. Some\nM-naturalists want “continuity with” only the\nhard or physical sciences (Hard M-naturalists);\nothers seek “continuity with” any successful science,\nnatural or social (Soft M-naturalists). Soft M-naturalism is probably\nthe dominant strand in philosophy today. \nFor M-naturalists, “continuity with” the sciences\nincludes, in the first instance, the Quinean repudiation of a\n“first philosophy,” a philosophical solution to problems\nthat proceeds entirely a priori, that is, without the benefit\nof empirical evidence. (Most M-naturalists do not go as far as Quine,\nhowever, in repudiating any role for a priori\nconceptual analysis: see, e.g., Goldman 1986 for a more typical\nM-naturalist approach). Beyond hostility to methods that are\nexclusively a priori, M-naturalists require continuity with\nthe sciences in two more precise senses, which we may call\n“Results Continuity” and “Methods\nContinuity.” \nResults Continuity requires that the substantive claims of\nphilosophical theories be supported or justified by the results of the\nsciences. Epistemologists like Goldman look to the results of\npsychology and cognitive science to find out how the human cognitive\napparatus really works; only with that information in hand can the\nepistemologist construct norms for how humans ought to form\nbeliefs (Goldman 1978, 1986). Moral philosophers like Gibbard and\nRailton, despite profound substantive disagreements, both think that a\nsatisfactory account of morality’s nature and function must be\nsupported by the results of evolutionary biology, our best going\ntheory for how we got to be the way we are (Gibbard 1990, Railton\n1986). A philosophical account of morality that explains its nature\nand function in ways that would be impossible according to\nevolutionary theory would not, by naturalistic scruples, be an\nacceptable philosophical theory. \n“Methods Continuity,” by contrast, demands only that\nphilosophical theories emulate the “methods” of inquiry of\nsuccessful sciences. “Methods” should be construed broadly\nhere to encompass not only, say, the experimental method, but also the\nstyles of explanation (e.g., identification of causes that determine,\nceteris paribus, their effects) employed in the sciences.\nSuch a view does not presuppose the methodological unity of\nthe various sciences, only that successful sciences have some\nmethodological uniqueness, even if this is not exactly the\nsame across all the sciences. Historically, Methods Continuity has\nconstituted the most important type of naturalism in philosophy, found\nin writers like Spinoza, Hume, and Nietzsche. (However, unlike the\ncontemporary M-naturalists who draw on the actual results of\nestablished sciences, many historical M-naturalists drawn to Methods\nContinuity simply try to emulate a scientific way of\nunderstanding the world in developing their philosophical\ntheories.) \nM-naturalists, then, construct philosophical theories that are\ncontinuous with the sciences either in virtue of their dependence upon\nthe actual results of scientific method in different domains or in\nvirtue of their employment and emulation of distinctively scientific\nways of looking at and explaining things. We may still distinguish\nbetween two different branches of M-naturalism, represented best by\nQuine, on the hand, and Goldman, on the other. The former we will call\nReplacement Naturalism, the latter Normative Naturalism.\nGoldman’s paradigm of Normative Naturalism has dominated\nphilosophical research in the area (see Kitcher 1992), though it is\nQuine’s notion of Replacement Naturalism that proves useful for\nunderstanding the American Legal Realists as naturalists in legal\nphilosophy (Leiter 1997). Since both Replacement and Normative\nNaturalists share the methodological commitment distinctive\nof naturalism—to make philosophical theorizing continuous with\nand dependent upon scientific theorizing—the difference must be\nlocated elsewhere: not in methodology, but in goal. According to\nReplacement Naturalists, the goal of theorizing is description or\nexplanation; to that end, conceptual and justificatory theories are to\nbe replaced by empirical and descriptive theories. According\nto Normative Naturalists, the goal is regulation of practice through\nthe promulgation of norms or standards. Of course, traditional\nepistemology also shares the regulative goal of Normative Naturalism;\nwhat distinguishes the Normative Naturalist is simply the\nmethods employed to realize this objective (cf. Goldman 1986,\npp. 6–9). \nMany naturalists go beyond methodological naturalism, however, and\nembrace a substantive doctrine. S-naturalism in philosophy is\neither the (ontological) view that the only things that exist are\nnatural or physical things; or the (semantic) view\nthat a suitable philosophical analysis of any concept must show it to\nbe amenable to empirical inquiry. In the ontological sense,\nS-naturalism is often taken to entail physicalism, the doctrine that\nonly those properties picked out by the laws of the physical sciences\nare real. In the semantic sense, S-naturalism is just the view that\npredicates must be analyzable in terms that admit of empirical\ninquiry: so, e.g., a semantic S-naturalist might claim that\n“morally good” can be analyzed in terms of characteristics\nlike “maximizing human well-being” that admit of empirical\ninquiry by psychology and physiology (assuming that well-being is a\ncomplex psycho-physical state). \nMany philosophers are drawn to some type of S-naturalism in virtue of\ntheir M-naturalism: being a philosophical naturalist in the\nmethodological sense sometimes leads a philosopher to think that the\nbest philosophical account of some concept or domain will be in terms\nthat are substantively naturalistic. It is important to notice that a\ncommitment to Methodological Naturalism does not entail any\nsubstantive conclusions, however: methodologically, it is an open\nquestion whether the best philosophical account of morality or\nmentality or law must be in substantively naturalistic terms. \nThe varieties of philosophical naturalism map on to a variety of\nnaturalistic approaches in legal philosophy. The most radical version\nof M-naturalism, Replacement Naturalism, is articulated and defended\nin Leiter (2001b, 2001c) and, arguably, in the American Legal Realists\n(Llewellyn 1930; Moore and Callahan 1943; Leiter 1997) (for pertinent\ndoubts about the radical program, however, see [Farrell 2006] and\n[Leiter 2007, p. 192]). The less radical form of M-naturalism,\nNormative Naturalism, is exemplified in epistemology by Goldman (1978,\n1986), as noted, but its implications for jurisprudence and law have,\nto date, only been partly developed (Allen & Leiter 2001; Goldman\n1999; Leiter 1998, 2001c; Talbott & Goldman 1998). S-naturalism\nfeatures most prominently in the writings of the Scandinavian Legal\nRealists. S-naturalism also can (and intermittently has) played a role\nin motivating Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American\nlegal-philosophical tradition. More recently, S-naturalism without\nnormative skepticism has been defended by contemporary moral realists\nand natural law theorists like Brink (1988, 1989, 2001) and Moore\n(1985, 1992b). \nReplacement Naturalism holds that conceptual and justificatory\ntheories—the traditional fare of philosophy—are to be\nreplaced by empirical and descriptive theories. There are two\nkinds of argumentative routes to Replacement Naturalism, both due to\nQuine: the first arises from doubts about the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction (Quine 1951); the second from doubts about foundationalism\n(Quine 1969). Here we consider the former. \nPhilosophers have long thought that some truths were\nnecessary while others were contingent; in the\ntwentieth-century, under the influence of logical positivism, this was\ntaken to be the distinction between those statements that were\n“true in virtue of meaning” (hence necessarily\ntrue) and those that were “true in virtue of fact” (hence\nonly contingently true). The former “analytic”\ntruths were the proper domain of philosophy; the latter\n“synthetic” truths the proper domain of empirical science.\nQuine argued that the distinction could not be sustained: all\nstatements are, in principle, answerable to experience, and,\nconversely, all statements can be maintained in the face of experience\nas long as we adjust other parts of our picture of the world. So there\nis no real distinction between claims that are “true in virtue\nof meaning” and “true in virtue of facts,” or\nbetween ‘necessary’ and ‘contingent’ truths;\nthere is simply the socio-historical fact that, at any given point in\nthe history of inquiry, there are some statements we are unlikely to\ngive up in the face of recalcitrant empirical evidence, and others\nthat we are quite willing to give up when empirical evidence\nconflicts. \nWithout a domain of analytic truths—truths that are a\npriori and hold in virtue of meaning—it becomes unclear\nwhat special domain of expertise for philosophical reflection remains.\nIf all claims are, in principle, revisable in light of empirical\nevidence, why not let all questions fall to empirical science?\nPhilosophy would be out of business, except perhaps as the abstract,\nreflective branch of empirical science. This Quinean attack has\nconsequences for the traditional philosophical business of conceptual\nanalysis, since on the dominant view from Plato through Carnap\n“every analysis of a concept is inextricably bound to a\ncollection of purported analyticities” (Laurence & Margolis\n1999, p. 18). (Even the more recent “possession-condition”\naccount of concepts in Peacocke (1992) requires that it be\nanalytic that certain inferential transitions are privileged\nby a particular concept.) The conclusion Replacement Naturalists draw\nfrom the preceding is that since any claim of conceptual analysis is\nvulnerable to the demands of a posteriori (i.e., empirical)\ntheory construction, philosophy must proceed in tandem with empirical\nscience, not as the arbiter of its claims, but as a reflective attempt\nat synoptic clarity about the state of empirical knowledge. \nMany resist this conclusion. According to one proponent, a conceptual\nanalysis proceeds “by appeal to what seems to us most obvious\nand central about [the concept in question]…as revealed by our\nintuitions about possible cases” (Jackson 1998, p. 31).\n“[T]he general coincidence in intuitive responses [to possible\ncases] reveals something about the folk theory of [the concept in\nquestion]” (Jackson, 1998, p. 32). The question that plagues\nconceptual analysis, post-Quine, is what kind of knowledge\nsuch a procedure actually yields? Why should ordinary intuitions about\nthe extension of a concept be deemed reliable or informative? Why\nthink the “folk” are right? \nThe track record of a priori methods like appeal to\nintuitions and conceptual analysis is not a promising one (e.g.,\nHarman 1994; Hintikka 1999). Kant, for example, took it to be a\npriori that space necessarily had the structure described by\nEuclidean geometry; subsequent physics showed his intuitions to be\nmistaken. The moral naturalists would draw from this track record of\na priori philosophy is well-expressed by Cummins (1999, pp.\n117–18): \nFor the Replacement Naturalist, in short, the only sound reason to\nprefer a proposed conceptual analysis is not because it seems\nintuitively obvious, but because it earns its place by figuring in\nsuccessful a posteriori theories of the world. Philosophy\ncum conceptual analysis and intuition-pumping should be\nabandoned in favor of empirical science; philosophy is simply the more\nabstract and reflective part of empirical science and lays claim to no\ndistinctive methods or body of knowledge. \nDefenders of conceptual analysis, it is true, commonly proclaim the\nmodesty of their ambitions; indeed, Jackson specifically chastises\nconceptual analysis in its “immodest role,” namely when\n“it gives intuitions…too big a place in determining what\nthe world is like” (1998, pp. 43–44): “There is\nnothing sacrosanct about folk theory. It has served us well but not so\nwell that it would be irrational to make changes to it in the light of\nreflection on exactly what it involves, and in the light of one or\nanother empirical discovery about us and our world” (Jackson\n1998, p. 44). The question is, having conceded this much, what\nremains? Conceptual analysis, as Jackson conceives it, becomes hard to\ndistinguish from banal descriptive sociology of the Gallup-poll\nvariety. (Jackson even says he advocates, when necessary, “doing\nserious opinion polls on people’s responses to various\ncases” [1998, p. 36].) Such a procedure might deliver\nsome insight in to what some people, at some time, in some place,\nthink about “mind” or “law” or\n“justice,” but Replacement Naturalists wonder what\nphilosophical import any of this data could have, since it is bounded\nnot simply by time and place, but also ignorance. Yet, as Farrell\n(2006) has rargued, such a procedure may serve an important\ntheoretical purpose, even if its claims are vulnerable to\nrevision. \nHow might Replacement Naturalism in legal philosophy, motivated by\nthese Quinean doubts about conceptual analysis and intuitions,\nproceed? One possibility is suggested in Leiter (2001b), which invokes\nthe following example. Raz (1985) has offered an influential\nconceptual argument against Soft Positivism’s claim that there\nis no constraint on the content of a rule of recognition beyond the\nfact that it is a social rule: its existence-conditions are given by\nthe actual practice of officials in deciding disputes, but what\ncriteria of legality officials appeal to (i.e., the content\nof the rule of recognition) is dependent upon whatever the\nconventional practice of officials in that society happens to be. Raz\noffers an analysis of the concept of authority to show that Soft\nPositivism is incompatible, even in principle, with the law’s\npossessing the authority it claims to possess. According to Raz, it is\na non-normative prerequisite for a claim to authority that it be\npossible to identify the authority’s directive without reference\nto the underlying “dependent” reasons for that directive.\nThis is a prerequisite for authority because what\ndistinguishes a (practical) authority, on Raz’s\n“service” conception, is that its directives preempt\nconsideration of the underlying reasons for what we ought to do, and\nin so doing actually makes it more likely that we will do what we\nreally ought to do. Authoritative reasons are claimed to be\nexclusionary reasons, excluding from consideration those dependent\nreasons (including, importantly, moral reasons) on which the\nauthoritative directive rests. Soft Positivism, then, undermines the\npossibility of the rule of recognition claiming authority, since for\nSoft Positivism a rule of recognition can, in principle, employ\ndependent reasons as criteria of legal validity: to identify, then,\nthe directives about legal validity of such a rule of recognition\nwould be impossible without recourse to precisely the dependent\nreasons the rule was supposed to preempt. \nOne line of response to Raz has appealed to contrary intuitions about\nthe concept of authority. Perry (1987), for example, argues that\nauthoritative reasons need not be exclusionary in Raz’s sense;\nit suffices, Perry says, that they simply be “weightier”\nthan other reasons. Some commentators’ intuitions line up with\nRaz’s (Leiter 2001b), others with Perry (Waluchow 1994). Now, of\ncourse, the Quinean worries about conceptual analysis hold even in\ncases where everyone’s intuitions about a concept coincide; but\nwhen they do not coincide, the inadequacies of the philosophical\n“methods” at hand seem especially acute. Some proponents\nof traditional methods of legal philosophy object that “the mere\nfact that there is disagreement about what the conceptual truths of\nlaw are…does not mean that conceptual analysis of law is\nfruitless. If that were the case, we should have to conclude the same\nabout philosophy generally” (Coleman 2001, p. 211 n. 38).\nUnfortunately, this reductio response depends on a conclusion\nthat the Replacement Naturalist is, in fact, prepared to\nembrace—and not because the Replacement Naturalist naively\nbelieves empirical methods “would…put an end to disputes\nabout the nature of law or anything else” (Coleman 2001, p. 211\nn.38). The worry, rather, is that intuitions about concepts enjoy no\nprivileged epistemic status, while claims in empirical science do.\nEven if empirical science does not resolve these disputes, it at least\ndelineates criteria with epistemic weight for adjudicating them. The\ncrucial question, then, becomes whether our best empirical science\nrequires drawing the conceptual lines one way rather than another. \nThe leading social scientific accounts of judicial\ndecision-making—both the informal ones (Pritchett 1949, Powe\n2000) and the formal ones (Segal & Spaeth 1993)—have two\nstriking features in this regard: first, they all aim to account for\nthe relative causal contribution of “law” and non-law\nfactors (e.g., political ideologies or “attitudes”) to\njudicial decisions; and second, they demarcate “law” from\nnon-law factors in typical Hard Positivist terms, i.e., they generally\ntreat as “law” only pedigreed norms, like legislative\nenactments and prior holdings of courts (as well, sometimes, as the\ninterpretive methods applied to these kinds of legal sources: see the\ntreatment of the “legal model” in Segal & Spaeth 1993,\npp. 33–53). If these models were ultimately vindicated\nempirically—and not just for American courts—this would\ngive the Replacement Naturalist reason to abandon any a\npriori, intuitive confidence we had about the concept of law that\nconflicted with Hard Positivism—just as the role of\nnon-Euclidean geometry in parts of physics has led everyone\nto repudiate Kant’s a priori intuitive confidence about\nthe Euclidean structure of space. If social science really cuts the\ncausal joints of the legal world in Hard Positivist terms, the\nReplacement Naturalist argues, that is a compelling reason to work\nwith that concept of law as against its competitors. \nProponents of conceptual analysis, by contrast, are skeptical that the\nexplanatory premises of empirical social scientists give us any reason\nto prefer one concept of law to another. Notice, of course, that an\nanalogous skepticism is available to the diehard Euclidean: after all,\nnon-Euclidean geometries are famously non-intuitive and hard to grasp.\nBut Kantians recognize that such a response would be unmotivated: if\nnon-Euclidean geometry does explanatory work within successful\nphysical theory, then the right conclusion to draw is that our\nintuitions about the structure of space need tutoring to keep pace\nwith empirical knowledge. So, too, the analogous question for the\nnatural lawyer or Soft Positivist is: why think your intuitions are\nepistemically privileged as opposed to simply untutored by the best\nempirical science? \nThe skeptic, however, might refine the challenge as follows:\n“It’s not,” she might say, “that I insist on\nsticking to my intuitions, empirical science be damned. Rather, I do\nnot see why the empirical science at issue needs to take\nsides on a dispute about the concept of law.” Of course, it is\nclear that the empirical social science at issue draws the line\nbetween legal and non-legal norms based on pedigree criteria, but the\nquestion is whether it needs to: the natural lawyer could\nagree with the social scientists that, e.g., moral and political\nconsiderations determine judicial decisions, but contest the\nassumption that these considerations are not themselves legally\nbinding. \nThe difficulty, of course, is that the candidate non-law explanatory\nfactors at issue (e.g., an ideological commitment to the platforms of\nthe Republican Party) are not plausible candidates for being legal\nnorms, on any existing theory of the concept of law. Moreover, there\nare good reasons why social science treats the explanatory factors at\nissue as non-legal: for example, the moral and political attitudes\ninvoked to explain decisions do not, for example, appear explicitly in\nthe text of the decisions, or in the explicit rationales for the\ndecisions; they are often hidden and hard to detect,\nwhich make them quite unlike any of the paradigm instances of legal\nnorms, like statutory provisions or precedent. Finally, the\nlegal/non-legal demarcation in empirical social science usually\nreflects more general explanatory premises about the psycho-social\nfactors that account for behavior, well beyond the realm of the legal.\nThe motivation for demarcating the legal/non-legal in essentially Hard\nPositivist terms is, for most social scientists, to effect an\nexplanatory unification of legal phenomena with other political and\nsocial behavior. \nYet the very talk of “legal phenomena” may invite a\ndifferent kind of objection to the proposed naturalization of\njurisprudential questions. For how is it, one might wonder, that the\nsocial scientist knows these are legal phenomena he is\nexplaining, and not phenomena of some other kind? Does that not\nalready presuppose an analysis of the concept of law? (Cf. Coleman\n2001, pp. 213–214.) It is not obvious, though, why a shared\nlanguage and dictionaries won’t suffice to get empirical science\noff the ground; it is not that empirical science needs\nconceptual analysis to tell his explanatory story, it’s rather\nthat after the fact the philosopher may be able to offer some\ngreater reflective clarity about the concepts invoked in the\nexplanatory story. Conceptual philosophers are keen to insist that\nthey are not lexicographers; but the intelligibility of empirical\nscience can get a long way with lexicography alone. To the extent a\nconceptual analysis helps, it helps after we discover which\nway of cutting the causal joints of the social world works best,\naccording to the naturalist. \nAll these rejoinders on behalf of naturalism, however, are predicated\non the assumption that we have a robust social scientific account of\nlaw. Yet it is now plain we do not (see, e.g., Leiter 2007, pp. 192\nff.). The best social-scientific accounts of adjudication, for\nexample, boast predictive success that is so feeble (better than\ncoin-tosses, but not much!) that their explanatory models, with their\nimplicit concepts of law, earn no epistemic credence. When it comes to\nthe “concept of law” itself, we may have nothing more than\nintuitions, however epistemically feeble, on which to rely. And\nperhaps they are not as epistemically feeble as the naturalist\noriginally thought? Law, after all, is not a natural kind, but a\ncomplicated kind of social artifact, and it seems far more plausible\nthat social artifacts will depend on folk intuitions and how people\nuse language: so perhaps Hart’s methodology is the right one\nafter all for its subject-matter (cf. Langlinais & Leiter\n2016)? \nThe locus classicus of the second kind of Replacement\nNaturalism—the one deriving from an attack on\nfoundationalism—is Quine (1969). The central enterprise of\nepistemology on Quine’s view is to understand the relation\nbetween our theories of the world and the evidence (sensory input) on\nwhich they are based. Quine’s target is one influential\nconstrual of this project: Cartesian foundationalism, particularly in\nthe sophisticated form given to it in the twentieth-century by Rudolf\nCarnap in Der Logische Aufbau der Welt (1928). The\nfoundationalist wants an account of the theory-evidence relation that\nwould vindicate the privileged epistemic status of at least some\nsubset of our theories: our theories (in particular, our best theories\nof natural science) are to be “grounded” in indubitable\nevidence (i.e., immediate sense impressions). Quine deems\nfoundationalism to be a failure: the semantic part of the program is\nrendered unrealizable by meaning holism on the one hand (theoretical\nterms get their meanings from their place in the whole theoretical\nframework, not in virtue of some point-by-point contact with sensory\ninput), while the epistemic part of the program is defeated by the\nDuhem–Quine thesis about the underdetermination of theory by\nevidence on the other (there is always more than one theory consistent\nwith the evidence, in part, because a theoretical hypothesis can\nalways be preserved in the face of recalcitrant evidence by abandoning\nthe auxiliary hypotheses that informed the test of the hypothesis)\n(see Kim 1988, pp. 385–386). \nWhat becomes, then, of epistemology? Hilary Kornblith has summed up\nQuine’s view as follows: “Once we see the sterility of the\nfoundationalist program, we see that the only genuine questions there\nare to ask about the relation between theory and evidence and about\nthe acquisition of belief are psychological questions”\n(Kornblith 1994, p. 4). This view Kornblith aptly dubs Quine’s\n“replacement thesis”: “the view that epistemological\nquestions may be replaced by psychological questions” (Kornblith\n1994, p. 3). Here is how Quine puts it: \nSeveral pages later, Quine continues that on his proposal, \nThus Quine: the central concern of epistemology is the theory-evidence\nrelationship; if the foundationalist story about this relationship is\na failure, then that leaves only one story worth telling about this\nrelationship: namely, the story told by “a purely descriptive,\ncausal-nomological science of human cognition” (Kim 1988, p.\n388). The science of human cognition replaces armchair\nepistemology: we naturalize epistemology by turning over its central\nquestion—the relationship between theory and evidence—to\nthe relevant empirical science. \nWe can now generalize Quine’s point as follows (Leiter 1998).\nLet us say that a Replacement Naturalist in any branch of philosophy\nholds that: \nThis goes beyond Quine in one important respect: for Quine infers\nReplacement Naturalism only from the failure of\nfoundationalism—which is simply one possible normative\naccount of the evidence-theory relationship, but not the only one.\nQuine’s arguments simply do not show that no other normative\naccount of the evidence-theory relationship is possible. \nQuine has been extensively criticized on precisely this score (e.g.,\nGoldman 1986, pp. 2–3; Kim 1988). The key to a successful\ndefense of Replacement Naturalism lies in an explanation of why\nnormative theory without foundationalism is sterile. One\nworry is that without foundationalism, normative theories are\nbanal. Consider: it is now a familiar result of cognitive\npsychology that human beings regularly make mistakes in logical\nreasoning (cf. Stich 1994). So a mere descriptive theory of\nbelief-formation, of the sort Quine appears to recommend, would simply\nrecord these mistakes. But shouldn’t epistemology tell us that\nbeliefs ought not to be formed illogically? One can hardly\nimagine why Quine would disagree: one ought not to form\nbeliefs illogically. But the question is whether this piece of banal\nadvice adds up to a fruitful research program? The descriptive project\nof Replacement Naturalism may record certain irrational cognitive\nprocesses in studying the evidence-theory relationship, but given the\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence, even when we correct for\nlogical mistakes, we still won’t have an account of which of our\ntheoretical beliefs are warranted and which are not. The Quinean\nintuition is we’ll learn more from the empirical inquiry, than\nfrom systematizing our banal normative intuitions about irrationality.\nMore generally, unless we have some foundational point\noutside our epistemic practices from which to assess the epistemic\nissues, the project of systematizing our mundane normative intuitions\nwill simply collapse into the descriptive sociology of knowledge. If\nwe can’t stand outside the epistemological boat, then we can do\nno more than report what it is we do. But it is precisely the\nviability of such an external standpoint that Quine denies in his\nembrace of the metaphor of Neurath’s boat. So from within the\nboat, there is nothing to do but description. \nQuine’s argument for Replacement Naturalism, recall, moved in\ntwo steps. Step one was anti-foundationalism: no unique\ntheory is justified on the basis of the evidential input. Step two was\nreplacement: since no foundational story can be told about\nthe relation between input (evidence) and output (theory), we should\nreplace the normative program with a purely descriptive inquiry, e.g.\nthe psychological study of what input causes what output. We can find\nanalogues of both steps in the approach to the theory of adjudication\noffered by American Legal Realism. \nTheory of adjudication is concerned not with the relationship\nbetween “evidence” and “scientific theory,”\nbut rather with the justificatory relationship between “legal\nreasons” (the input, as it were) and judicial decision (the\noutput): theory of adjudication tries to tell judges how they\nought to justify their decisions, i.e. it seeks to\n“ground” judicial decision-making in reasons that require\nunique outcomes. The American Legal Realists are\n“anti-foundationalists” about judicial decisions in the\nsense that they deny that the legal reasons justify a unique decision:\nthe legal reasons underdetermine the decision (at least in most cases\nactually litigated). More precisely, the Realists claim that the law\nis rationally indeterminate in the sense that the class of\nlegal reasons—i.e., the class of legitimate reasons a judge may\noffer for a decision—does not provide a justification\nfor a unique outcome. Just as sensory input does not justify\na unique scientific theory, so legal reasons, according to the\nRealists, do not justify a unique decision. \nThe Realists also take the second step that Quine takes: replacement.\nAccording to the Realist indeterminacy thesis, legal reasons do not\njustify a unique decision, meaning that the foundationalist enterprise\nof theory of adjudication is impossible. Why not replace, then, the\n“sterile” foundational program of justifying some one\nlegal outcome on the basis of the applicable legal reasons, with a\ndescriptive/explanatory account of what input (that is, what\ncombination of facts and reasons) produces what output (i.e., what\njudicial decision)? As Underhill Moore puts it at the beginning of one\nof his articles: “This study lies within the province of\njurisprudence. It also lies within the field of behavioristic\npsychology. It places the province within the field” (Moore\n& Callahan 1943, p. 1). Notice how closely this echoes\nQuine’s idea that, “Epistemology…simply falls into\nplace as a chapter of psychology…” (1969, p. 82).\nJurisprudence—or, more precisely, the theory of\nadjudication—is “naturalized” because it falls into\nplace, for the Realist, as a chapter of psychology (or economics or\nsociology, etc.). Moreover, it does so for essentially Quinean\nreasons: because the foundational account of adjudication is a\nfailure—a consequence of accepting the Realists’ famous\nclaim that the law is indeterminate. \nOf course, this argument for Replacement Naturalism only seems to work\nagainst “formalist” theories of adjudication that are\ncommitted to the rational determinacy of law. But, some object,\n“No contemporary analytic jurisprudent is a formalist”\n(Coleman 1998, p. 284), and some have even claimed that the\n“formalists” the Legal Realists opposed were not committed\nto the rational determinacy of law (Paulson 2001, p. 78). Both\nobjections seem mistaken: Dworkin, for example, is committed to the\nrational determinacy of law in exactly the sense at issue for the\nReplacement argument. And it is even conceded that all legal theorists\nare committed to the rational determinacy of law in “at least\nsome legal disputes” (Coleman 1998, p. 284), thus making them\nvulnerable, in principle, to the Replacement argument. The targets of\nthe Legal Realist critique were, equally, committed to the rational\ndeterminacy of law; indeed, it would be impossible to make sense of\nwhat the Realists were doing if that were not so. The Replacement\nNaturalist might take the view that there is no reason to call for\n“naturalizing” theory of adjudication in those range of\ncases where legal reasons are satisfactory predictors of\nlegal outcomes (i.e., precisely those cases where the foundationalist\nprogram can be carried out). One may worry, again, about whether there\nis an interesting or fruitful normative story to be\ntold (rather than a merely banal descriptive sociology), but it\nsuffices for the analogy with Quine that there remains some\nsubstantial domain of cases where the foundational program can not be\ncarried out, so that the case for replacement remains intact. \nThe real difficulty, of course, pertains not to these historical\npoints, but to whether or not the project of a normative theory of\nadjudication warrants replacement just because rational determinacy\ndoes not obtain. As in the Quinean case, the Replacement Naturalist\nmust maintain that without rational determinacy, normative theories of\nadjudication are banal, mere exercises in descriptive sociology.\nCritics of Replacement Naturalism contest this conclusion, though more\nby way of affirmation than argument (Coleman 1998, p. 285 n. 44).\nHowever, if the objection under consideration were correct, then a\nnormative theory that specifies what the anti-foundationalist\nconcedes—namely, that there is more than one (though not simply\nany) judicial decision that can be justified on the basis of the class\nof legal reasons—must, in some measure, be a theory worth\nhaving. Arguably, such a theory might be adequate to deflect the\nchallenge to the political legitimacy of adjudication based\non the indeterminacy of law, but does it provide the\nnormative guidance to judges we want from a theory? Does a\ntheory that tells judges they would be justified (on the basis of the\nclass of legal reasons) in deciding for the plaintiff on theory\nX or the defendant on theory Y (but not the\nplaintiff or defendant on theory Z!) really provide normative guidance\nfor judges worth having? The Replacement Naturalist answers in the\nnegative: better to have a descriptive account of inputs and outputs,\none that would license prediction of judicial behavior, than an\nindeterminate normative theory. This response, of course, makes\nReplacement Naturalism vulnerable to conflicting intuitions about the\nfruitfulness or sterility of different kinds of theorizing. \nThere are other limits to the Quinean analogy (Leiter 2001a, pp.\n284–285; Greenberg 2011 disputes other aspects of the analogy,\nwhile Leiter 2011 replies to some of Greenberg’s objections).\nFirst, the American Legal Realists end up presupposing a theory of the\nconcept of legality in framing their arguments for law’s\nindeterminacy (Leiter 2001a, pp. 292–293); thus, while they may\nbelieve the only fruitful account of adjudication is\ndescriptive and empirical, not normative and conceptual, they\nthemselves need a concept of law that is not—at least\non the arguments considered so far—empirical or naturalized. As\none critic of Replacement Naturalism notes: “the naturalist is\ncommitted as a conceptual matter to the existence of a test of\nlegality…. The naturalist is thus in the same boat with ever\nother analytic philosopher of law” (Coleman 2001, p. 214). The\nanalogy with naturalized epistemology, in other words, must be\nlocalized to the theory of adjudication, and not the whole of\njurisprudence. Of course, it remains possible for the Replacement\nNaturalist to argue for the requisite concept of legality on precisely\nthe empirical grounds noted in the previous section\n(“Replacement Naturalism I: Against Conceptual Analysis”).\nBut as it stands, the analogy to Quine’s attack on\nfoundationalist epistemology warrants no radical abandonment of\ntraditional conceptual analysis across the board. \nA second difference from Quine is also important: for the crux of the\nLegal Realist position (at least for the majority of Realists) is that\nnon-legal reasons (e.g., judgments of fairness, or consideration of\ncommercial norms) explain the decisions. They, of course,\nexplain the decisions by justifying them, though not\nnecessarily by justifying a unique outcome (i.e., the non-legal\nreasons might themselves rationalize other decisions as well). Now\nclearly the descriptive story about the non-legal reasons is not going\nto be part of a non-mentalistic naturalization of the theory of\nadjudication: a causal explanation of decisions in terms of reasons\n(even non-legal reasons) does require taking the normative force of\nthe reasons qua reasons seriously. The behaviorism of Quine\nor Underhill Moore is not in the offing here, but surely this is to be\npreferred: behaviorism failed as a foundation for empirical social\nscience, while social-scientific theories employing mentalistic\ncategories have flourished. Moreover, if the non-legal reasons are\nthemselves indeterminate—i.e., if they do not justify a\nunique outcome—then any causal explanation of the\ndecision will have to go beyond reasons to identify the psycho-social\nfacts (e.g., about personality, class, gender, socialization, etc.)\nthat cause the decision. Such a “naturalization” of the\ntheory of adjudication might be insufficiently austere in its ontology\nfor Quinean scruples, but it is still a recognizable attempt to\nsubsume what judges do within a (social) scientific framework. \nLike the traditional epistemologist, the Normative Naturalist embraces\nas his goal the promulgation of norms by which to regulate our\nepistemic practices (to govern how we should acquire and weigh\nevidence, as well as, ultimately, form beliefs). Unlike the\nnon-naturalist, however, the Normative Naturalist does not think\nepistemic norms can be adequately formulated from the armchair:\nnormative theorizing must be continuous with scientific theorizing.\nBut if this is not just to collapse into Replacement Naturalism then\nwhat does the M-naturalist credo amount to in the normative case?\nConsider Goldman’s proposal: “Epistemics assumes that\ncognitive operations should be assessed instrumentally: given a choice\nof cognitive procedures, those which would produce the best set of\nconsequences should be selected” (1978, p. 520). The\nNormative Naturalist maintains that the reason the philosopher\ncan’t do armchair epistemology is because it is an a\nposteriori, empirical matter what norms in fact serve\nour epistemic or cognitive goals (e.g., forming true beliefs). Goldman\nemphasizes a particularly important instance of this general\npoint: \nSo the Normative Naturalist thinks that normative epistemology must be\ncontinuous with natural and social science in (at least) two senses:\n(i) we need to know what epistemic norms in fact lead to our forming\ntrue beliefs; and (ii) as a special case of (i), we need to identify\nepistemic norms actually usable by creatures like us. This rules out\ncertain (non-naturalistic) epistemic norms which require of cognizers\nbelief-formation practices beyond their ken (Goldman 1978, pp.\n512–513). The Normative Naturalist, in short, emphasizes the\ninstrumental character of normative theorizing in\nepistemology, and then argues that the only way to assess instrumental\nclaims is empirically—to see what means really brings\nabout what ends. And that task can never be pursued a priori,\nfrom the armchair, simply by analyzing the meaning of the words\n“knowledge” or “justified” or\n“true.” \nOf course, it bears noting that the Normative Naturalist does not\ndispense entirely with conceptual analysis—to the\ncontrary. It is precisely, for example, Goldman’s proffered\nconceptual analyses of “knowledge” and\n“justification” that require him to turn to empirical\npsychology to fill in the actual content of epistemic norms. Unlike\nthe Quinean program, naturalization enters for the Normativist only,\nas it were, in applied epistemology. What many philosophers\nmight think of as “pure” epistemology—giving an\naccount of knowledge—continues to be an a priori\nenterprise, even though it is an enterprise that invokes notions (like\n“reliability” and “causation”) that require\na posteriori investigation to apply. \nThe Normative Naturalist in jurisprudence, too, views theoretical\nquestions instrumentally. The philosophical foundation of\nevidence law has, to date, received the most attention from this\nperspective (Allen & Leiter 2001; Leiter 2001d). We want to ask,\nas Goldman puts it, “Which [social] practices have a\ncomparatively favorable impact on knowledge as contrasted with error\nand ignorance?” (1999, p. 5). Normative naturalism is, in this\nrespect, veritistic (to borrow Goldman’s term): it is\nconcerned with the production of knowledge, meaning (in part)\ntrue belief (Goldman 1999, pp. 79–100). So the\nNormative Naturalist embraces as his goal the promulgation of norms by\nwhich to regulate our epistemic practices so that they yield\nknowledge. In the case of individual epistemology, this means\nthe norms governing how individuals should acquire and weigh evidence\nas well as, ultimately, form beliefs; in the case of social\nepistemology, this means the norms governing the social mechanisms and\npractices that inculcate belief. The legal rules of evidence, in turn,\nare a prime case of the latter: for these rules structure the\nepistemic process by which jurors arrive at beliefs about disputed\nmatters of fact at trials. As such, the rules of evidence are a\nnatural candidate for investigation by Normative Naturalists. We may\nask of any particular rule: does it increase the likelihood that\njurors will reach true beliefs about disputed matters of\nfact? (Of course, it does not make sense to ask that of every\nrule, since some rules of evidence—for example, Federal Rules of\nEvidence (FRE) 407–411—are not meant to facilitate the\ndiscovery of truth, but to carry out various policy objectives like\nreducing accidents and avoiding litigation.) That means, of course,\nasking an essentially empirical question: does this rule of\ninclusion or exclusion in fact increase the likelihood that\nfact finders, given what they are actually like, will achieve\nknowledge about disputed matters of fact (i.e., does it maximize\nveritistic value). Of course, many rules that on their face invite one\nkind of veritistic analysis require a very different kind in practice.\nSo, for example, FRE 404, on its face, excludes character\nevidence in most contexts, though, in fact, the exception in 404(b)\nlargely swallows the rule. Thus, while it might seem that we should\nask whether excluding character evidence maximizes veritistic\nvalue, the real question is whether admitting it does. The\nsame may be said for the hearsay rule. Although on its face, the\nhearsay doctrine is a rule of exclusion, in reality it is a rule of\nadmission: what the advocate must really know is how to get the\nproffered hearsay admitted under one of the multitude of exceptions to\nthe nominal rule of exclusion (FRE 802). Thus, the pertinent\nveritistic question concerns the veritistic credentials of the grounds\non which hearsay is admitted, rather than the veritistic reasons for\nexcluding it in most cases. (Such questions, in fact, are already a\nstaple of much evidence scholarship.) \nIn theory of adjudication, by contrast, the Normative Naturalist wants\nto identify norms for adjudication that will help judges realize\nadjudicative goals. Such norms must, once again, satisfy two\nnaturalistic constraints: first, they must, as a matter of empirical\nfact, be effective means to goals (“the Instrumental\nConstraint”); second, they must be constrained by relevant\nempirical facts about the nature and limitations of judges (“the\nOught-Implies-Can Constraint”) (Leiter 1998). \nDworkin’s theory of adjudication (Dworkin 1986) makes a popular\ntarget for the Normative Naturalist. Dworkin’s theory says, very\nroughly, that a judge should decide a case in such a way that it\ncoheres with the principle that explains some significant\nportion of the prior institutional history and provides the\nbest justification for that history as a matter of political\nmorality. Can a Normative Naturalist be a Dworkinian? \n(1) Instrumental Constraint: The naturalist assesses\nnormative advice relative to its actual effectiveness for realizing\nrelevant goals. What, then, is the relevant goal in\nadjudication? One candidate is surely this: we want to give\njudges normative advice that will lead them to reach fair or just\noutcomes. Thus, the naturalist’s question becomes: which piece\nof normative advice is most effective in really helping\nactual judges realize justice and fairness? It is, at least, an open\nquestion whether Dworkin’s methodology will be effective in\nleading judges to do fair things. The fact that his normative theory\nhas had almost no impact whatsoever on American judicial practice over\nthe last thirty years is at least defeasible evidence that it does not\nappear to be an effective methodology (let alone one\neffective for realizing justice!) (Leiter 1998, p. 102). This latter\npoint is related to the naturalist’s second, and more important\nobjection. \n(2) Ought-Implies-Can-Constraint: One thing judges\ncan not do is what Dworkin’s Judge Hercules does. This is a\nfamiliar complaint about Dworkin’s theory, but naturalized\njurisprudence gives it a principled foundation. The naturalistic\njurisprudent eschews all normative guidance unusable by real judges;\nlike his naturalized counterpart in epistemology, he does “not\nwant to give merely idle advice, which humans [including judges] are\nincapable of following” (Goldman 1978, p.510). Dworkin may give\njudges an “aspirational model” (to borrow Jules\nColeman’s apt phrase), and the naturalistic jurisprudent need\nnot dispute that; but Descartes gave us an aspirational model in\nepistemology as well, and that does not make his program any more\nadequate or relevant by the naturalist’s lights. (It\nwould be attractive if we could take certain “clear and\ndistinct” ideas, and build up all of knowledge from them.) The\nnaturalist wants normative advice effective for creatures like\nus; demanding of judges Herculean philosophical ingenuity\nviolates this constraint. Aspiration, the naturalist concludes, is not\na fit aim of normative advice, which must, first and foremost, offer\neffective means to ends. \nSubstantive naturalism begins with the idea that there exist only\nnatural things, things of the kind natural science describes.\n(Physicalism, a more severe form of S-naturalism, holds that there are\nonly physical things.) This ontological S-naturalism may,\nthough need not, go with semantic S-naturalism, according to which a\nsuitable philosophical analysis of any concept must show it to be\namenable to empirical inquiry. \nS-naturalism has played a significant role in at least three\nlegal-philosophical traditions: (1) the Scandinavian Legal Realists\n(like Alf Ross and Karl Olivecrona), whose austere ontological\nnaturalism, conjoined with moral anti-realism, shaped their\ndistinctive take on legal concepts; (2) Legal Positivists, for whom\nS-naturalism can be, and sometimes has been, a significant motivation,\nand (3) contemporary defenders of a kind of natural law theory (like\nDavid Brink, Michael Moore, and Nicos Stavropoulos), who invoke the\nCausal Theory of Reference associated with Kripke and Putnam to offer\nan interpretation of some legal predicates in substantively\nnaturalistic terms. \nScandinavian Legal Realism stands out from other major traditions in\nlegal philosophy for expressly placing naturalism—and\nS-naturalism in particular—at center stage. Perhaps the most\nstriking example of this comes in the preface to the Second Edition of\nKarl Olivecrona’s Law as Fact, where Olivecrona states that\nthe aim of his book is “to fit the complex phenomena covered by\nthe word law into the spatio-temporal world” (1971, p. vii). But\nS-naturalism is equally prominent in Alf Ross’ On Law and\nJustice (1959, p. 67; see also Spaak 2009, pp. 40–42),\nprobably the most internationally famous contribution to the\nScandinavian Realist tradition. Given the centrality of S-naturalism\nto Scandinavian Realism, it is unsurprising that a variety of familiar\nnaturalism-motivated philosophical gambits feature prominently in the\nmajor Scandinavian Realist texts. These include efforts at\nnaturalistic reduction of legal concepts, as well as non-cognitivist\nand error-theoretic accounts of important aspects of legal discourse.\n(Some particular examples are discussed below.) \nThe S-naturalism of the Scandinavian Realists is today viewed more as\nan intellectual-historical museum piece than as a live contender in\njurisprudential debate. That Scandinavian Realism should have fallen\nout of favor is not wholly unsurprising, given the strong influence of\nlogical positivism and the similar Uppsala school of philosophy on the\nphilosophical outlook and approach of the major Scandinavian Realists\n(Bjarup 1999, p. 774; see also Sandin 1962, p. 496): although many\nwould still sympathize broadly with the Scandinavian Realists’\nnaturalism, anti-metaphysical inclinations, and moral anti-realism,\ntheir specific versions of these doctrines have not, as a general\nmatter, aged well. Be that as it may, the poor long-term reception of\nthe Scandinavians may be owed, in large part, to a rather more\naccidental cause: the influence of Hart (1959). In an influential\nreview of Ross’ On Law and Justice—simply (and\nsomewhat misleadingly) titled “Scandinavian\nRealism”—Hart famously attacked a central pillar of\nRoss’ legal philosophy, namely his austerely naturalistic\nanalysis of the concept of legal validity. Ross (1962) responded in\nhis own review of Hart’s The Concept of Law, arguing\nthat Hart had misunderstood him and that their views, properly\nunderstood, were not so far apart. \nIn order to understand what it was that Ross proposed and that Hart\nfound so objectionable, it is best to begin with the opening pages of\nOn Law and Justice. There, Ross draws a distinction between\ntwo kinds of linguistic meaning: expressive and representative.\nAccording to Ross, all linguistic utterances, oral or written, have\nexpressive meaning (i.e., express something); but only some have\nrepresentative meaning, i.e., represent states of affairs in the\nworld. Here Ross contrasts an utterance like “my father is\ndead,” which has expressive and representative meaning, with\nutterances like “ouch!” and “shut the door,”\nwhich have expressive meaning only. Ross calls utterances with\nrepresentative meaning “assertions.” Utterances without\nrepresentative meaning he calls either “exclamations” or\n“directives”—the former if they are not intended to\nexert influence on others (as in the case of a reflexive cry of\n“ouch!”), the latter if they are intended to exert\ninfluence (as in the case of “shut the door”) (1959, pp.\n6–8). \nRoss holds that legal rules, such as statutory provisions, are\ndirectives. He explains that such rules are not meant to represent\nstates of affairs, but to influence behavior. Simply put, if a legal\nrule is laid down stating that certain behavior “shall be\npunished” or “gives rise to liability,” this is not\ndone to describe what courts would do anyway, but to direct\nthe behavior of courts (and, indirectly at least, the behavior of\nprivate individuals) (1959, pp. 8–9). \nWhat, then, of the legal utterances “occurring in a textbook of\nlaw”? Are these assertions or directives? At a surface level,\nRoss tells us, the language in such books will often be similar or\neven identical to the language in an actual statute: a doctrinal\nwriter might, for example, say that certain behavior “gives rise\nto liability” or “shall be punished.” But we should\nnot be misled by this surface similarity, Ross says: “the\npropositions in a textbook, at any rate to a certain extent, intend to\ndescribe, not to prescribe” (1959, p. 9). To that extent,\ntherefore, they must be assertions, not directives—specifically,\nRoss claims, assertions about what is valid law. \nAnd what does it mean to say that something is valid law? In effect,\nRoss tells us, it is to predict the behavior and thinking of courts.\nDetails aside, to say that “X is valid law” is\nin effect to say that (1) judges will act in accordance with\nX, and (2) in so acting, they will feel themselves bound to\ndo so. Hence, claims about what is valid law are claims about purely\nnatural-factual states of affairs: facts about the behavior and\npsychology of judges (1959, pp. 42, 73–74, 75). \nThe Hart–Ross dialogue revolved around the merits of this\nanalysis; Hart, for his part, found it altogether inadequate. Most\ncrucially and memorably, Hart argued that “even if in the mouth\nof the ordinary citizen or lawyer ‘this is a valid rule of\nEnglish law’ is a prediction of what [English]\njudge[s] will do, say and/or feel, this cannot be its\nmeaning in the mouth of a judge who is not engaged in predicting his\nown or others’ behaviour or feelings.” Instead, it is an\n“act of recognition” of “the rule in question as one\nsatisfying certain accepted general criteria for admissions as a rule\nof the system and so as a legal standard of behaviour” (1959, p.\n165). At root, Hart argued, Ross’ analysis of the concept of\nlegal validity fails because “the normal central use of\n‘legally valid’ is in an internal normative statement of a\nspecial kind” (1959, p. 167). \nLater, in his review of Hart’s The Concept of Law, Ross\nclaimed that Hart had misunderstood him. In his analysis of\n“valid law,” Ross replied, he had been concerned\nspecifically with “legal concepts as they function in the\ndoctrinal study of law, what we on the Continent are accustomed to\ncall the science of law,” and if this were adequately\nunderstood, it would be evident that much of the apparent disagreement\nbetween him and Hart was illusory (1962, p. 1190). In effect, Ross\nsaid, he had been analyzing legal statements of a kind Hart would have\nclassified as “external.” Ross chalked up the confusion at\nleast in part to the translation of the Danish phrase\n“gældende ret” as “valid law,”\nacknowledging that the results sounded “odd in English\nusage,” and suggesting in passing that “existing\nlaw” or “law in force” might have better captured\nwhat he had in mind. (For further discussion of the translation\nquestion, see Eng 2011.) \nA number of subsequent authors who have revisited the Hart–Ross\ndebate have expressed broad sympathy for Ross’ claims to have\nbeen misunderstood. (See Pattaro 2009, pp. 545–546; Eng 2011;\nHoltermann 2014, p. 166 n. 4.) Nonetheless, as a matter of\nintellectual history, Hart’s critique had its effect. There has,\nhowever, been a recent uptick in interest in Scandinavian Legal\nRealism, perhaps owing in part to a broader renewal of interest in\nnaturalism in legal philosophy. This has not been limited to strictly\nhistorical or exegetical work, but has included efforts to mine the\nScandinavian Realists’ writings for philosophical strategies or\ninsights that might help advance contemporary legal philosophy, or to\noffer fruitful rational reconstructions of their ideas. (See, e.g.,\nHoltermann 2014; Spaak 2014, Ch. 10.) \nOne topic of some contemporary interest to which the Scandinavian\nRealists may be relevant is the possibility of understanding legal\nlanguage in expressivist and/or non-cognitivist terms. Largely\nowing to Kevin Toh’s work on the subject, there has been some\nrecent interest in legal (or “meta-legal”) expressivism,\nthat is, treatments of legal statements as expressions of distinctive\n(perhaps conative) mental states. (See Toh 2005; Toh 2011.)\nContemporary legal expressivists might look to the Scandinavian\nRealists as intellectual forebears of a sort, given the prominence of\nnon-cognitivist ideas in their theories of legal language. \nAs is widely recognized, the Scandinavian Realists were ethical\nnon-cognitivists. (Bjarup 1999, p. 775; Ross 1959, p. 313; Spaak 2009,\npp. 42–44, 52–55, 64.) In principle, this would not\nrequire adopting expressivist or non-cognitivist accounts of legal\nstatements, but as it happens Ross and Olivecrona did understand\nsubstantial parts of legal discourse on this model. To be sure, Ross\nanalyzed statements about “valid law” as assertions of\nnaturalistic fact, and thus cognitive. But, as discussed earlier, Ross\nthought some legal utterances were non-cognitive directives. This most\nobviously included legal rules themselves, as in the provisions of a\nstatute. But Ross also thought jurists’ doctrinal writings were\ntypically a blend of cognitive assertions of valid law and\nnon-cognitive directives, the latter being in effect advice calculated\nto influence the behavior of the judiciary (1959, pp. 46–49). In\nadvancing this idea, Ross was not merely making the banal point that\ndoctrinal writing is frequently laced with transparently normative\nclaims about how courts should decide cases. His point was subtler\nthan this; telegraphically stated, Ross’ observation was that\ndoctrinal writers sometimes do (and sometimes intend to) influence\njudges by making statements that could, on their face, equally be\ninterpreted as straightforward predictive/descriptive claims. It\nturns out, therefore, that Ross had a rather nuanced understanding of\nthe mix of cognitive (or representational/descriptive) and\nnon-cognitive (or directive/prescriptive) elements in legal\ndiscourse. \nIf anything, non-cognitivist ideas play an even more striking role in\nOlivecrona’s mature legal philosophy, notably as set out in the\nSecond Edition of Law as Fact. Unsatisfied with efforts to\nreduce talk of legal rights to claims about naturalistic states of\naffairs, Olivecrona ultimately concludes that the word\n“right,” as commonly used, does not signify anything and\nlacks semantic reference (1971, pp. 183–184). In the first\ninstance, he argues, statements about legal rights serve a directive\nfunction, though they can also indirectly serve to communicate\ninformation about actual (naturalistic) facts. Ultimately, Olivecrona\nextends this analysis to legal language in general, concluding:\n“Legal language is not a descriptive language. It is a\ndirective, influential language serving as an instrument of social\ncontrol” (1971, p. 253). Lest there be doubts about how far\nOlivecrona took this idea, he went on to observe that on his account,\n“Citizen, government, parliament, law, right, duty, marriage,\nelections, taxes, corporations, and princess all belong to\nth[e] category” of “words which…lack\nsemantic reference” (1971, p. 255). Thus, Olivecrona found no\nplace for many of the “things” legal language is\nostensibly “about” in the world of facts that he\ncountenanced as an S-naturalist. As so often happens with philosophers\nwho embrace non-cognitivism about some domain of thought and talk,\nhowever, Olivecrona was equally insistent that legal language and\nideas do find a place in reality. He accordingly devoted\nconsiderable attention to describing the function of legal language in\nsociety—concluding, ultimately, that “legal language plays\na vital role” as “an instrument of social control,”\n“for keeping the peace, as well as for sending men to death on\nthe battlefield” (1971, p. 254). Insofar as there is some\ncontemporary interest in expressivist and/or non-cognitivist\naccounts of legal thought and talk, therefore, Scandinavian Realism\nmay offer interesting intellectual-historical reference points (and\npossibly substantive inspiration) for the further development of such\nideas. \nAt least in contemporary Anglo-American legal philosophy, “Legal\nPositivism” is generally used as a shorthand for a claim roughly\nalong the following lines: “the existence and content of law\ndepends on social facts and not on its merits” (Green 2009).\nWhat is the relationship between naturalism and Legal Positivism in\nthe above-specified sense? The situation is somewhat complex because\nsome but not all Legal Positivists are naturalists, and few have gone\nso far as the Scandinavian Realists in wearing their naturalism on\ntheir sleeves. In brief, however, naturalism can and sometimes\nhas—but need not—play a role in motivating Legal\nPositivism. \nHow is it that naturalism can play a role in motivating Legal\nPositivism? As has often been remarked, the core Positivist claim\nabout the relationship between law and social facts amounts in effect\nto a claim that law is reducible to social facts, which—given\nthat “social facts” here is, tacitly if not expressly,\nlimited to psychological and sociological facts—further amounts\nto the claim that law is reducible to naturalistic facts. It should be\nclear enough why this would be appealing to people with S-naturalist\ncommitments, for it would, so to speak, mean that we can\n“place” law in the realm of naturalistic facts and\nentities. (By analogy, consider why S-naturalists would be drawn to\nthe idea that the existence and contents of human minds\ndepends solely on facts about human brains.) Unsurprisingly,\ntherefore, the affinities between Legal Positivism and S-naturalism\nhave not gone unnoticed. (See Kar 2006, p. 931; Leiter 2017.) \nIt is, however, somewhat harder to discern the actual extent to which\nS-naturalism has been a motivation for major philosophers in the Legal\nPositivist tradition. There is at least a good case to be made that\nHart was sufficiently attracted to S-naturalism to consider it an\nadvantage of Legal Positivism that it placed law in the world of\nearthly facts. (See Hart 1961, pp. 11–12, 83–84, 186; Raz\n1998, pp. 4–5; Toh 2005, pp. 83–85.) Even so, Legal\nPositivism need not be, and is not always, motivated by S-naturalism,\nor for that matter any kind of naturalism, and not all Legal\nPositivists are naturalists in any interesting sense. For example, Raz\ndoes not appear to be a naturalist of any sort. (See Raz 1988, p. 6.)\nThe broader point, of course, is that one need not be a naturalist to\nthink that some particular phenomenon (e.g., law) depends\nsolely on naturalistic facts. \nThus, it pays not to overstate, or to make overgeneralizations about,\nthe relationship between naturalism and Legal Positivism. We can,\nhowever, confidently say that Legal Positivism sits well with a\nbackground commitment to S-naturalism. This point is of no small\nimportance given the continuing influence of S-naturalism (or at least\ntemperamental affinities to S-naturalism) in the general background\nframework of post-Enlightenment culture and thought. (See Leiter\n2017.) \nJust as semantic doctrines more-or-less related to logical positivism\nwere central to the S-naturalism of Scandinavian Realism, the more\nrecent S-naturalism of writers like Brink, Moore, and Stavropoulos is\nindebted to the revolution in semantics initiated by Hilary Putnam and\nSaul Kripke known as the “new” or “causal”\ntheory of reference. These latter doctrines are not—yet in any\ncase—museum pieces, so the derived jurisprudential theses are\nvery much live items of debate. Stavropoulos explains the core\nsemantic ideas on which jurisprudential writers draw as follows: \nThus, if on the old view the “meaning” of an expression\n(the descriptions speakers associated with it) fixed the reference of\nthe expression, on the new theory, the referent fixes the meaning.\n“Water” picks out whatever stuff we happened to baptize\nwith the name “water” at the beginning of the\n“term-using practice.” As it happens, that stuff has a\ndistinctive micro-constitution: it is H20. Thus,\n“water” refers to stuff that is H20, and that\nis what the term means: the stuff that is H20. \nWriters like Brink, Moore, and Stavropoulos propose that when the\nmeaning of expressions in legal rules—and, in particular, the\nmeaning of the moral concepts (like “equality”) that\nfigure in some legal rules—is understood in the same way, then\nit follows that all rules have determinate applications:\neither the facts do or do not fall within the extension of the meaning\nof the key terms in the rule. The meaning of the rule determines its\napplication, but the meaning is fixed by the real referents\nof the terms in the legal rule. Of course, for this to be a version of\nS-naturalism, the claim must be that the real referents are themselves\nthings cognizable within a naturalistic framework: so, e.g., it would\nhave to be the case that the legal and moral features of situations\npicked out by our legal concepts (and the moral concepts embedded in\nthem) must be identical with (or supervenient upon) natural facts:\njust as there are necessary, a posteriori statements of\nproperty identity about water, so too there are such statements about\nlegal and moral facts. For example, perhaps the property of being\n“morally right” is just identical with the property of\n“maximizing human well-being,” where the latter may be\nunderstood in purely psychological and physiological terms. In that\ncase, whether an action X is morally right is simply a\nscientific question about whether action X will in fact\nmaximize the relevant kinds of psychological and physiological states\nin the world. (Most naturalistic moral realisms are based on versions\nof utilitarianism, precisely because it is easy to see what the\nnaturalistic base of moral properties would be in a utilitarian\nschema. One peculiar feature of the moral realism of Moore (1992b) is\nthat it is conjoined with a deontological moral theory, yet within a\npurportedly naturalistic moral realist framework.) The crucial claim,\nplainly, is that moral facts are to be identified with (or treated as\nsupervenient upon) certain kinds of natural facts. Of course, many\nphilosophers are skeptical that this claim can be made out. \nProblems arise at several different levels with this more recent\nS-naturalism, though all are traceable to the reliance on the new\ntheory of reference. To begin, there are familiar reasons to be\nskeptical about whether the new theory of reference is correct,\nreasons that won’t be rehearsed here (see, e.g., Evans 1973,\nBlackburn 1988). Even granting, however, the correctness of the new\ntheory, it is not obvious how it helps in the case of law. After all,\nthe new theory always seemed most plausible for a limited class of\nexpressions: proper names and natural kind terms. The reason has to do\nwith the implicit essentialism required for the new theory: unless\nreferents have essential characteristics—just as\n“water” has a distinctive and essential molecular\nconstitution—they can not fix meanings. But what is the essence\nof “due process” or “equal protection?” And\nwhat is the “essential” nature of the many artifact terms\nthat populate legal rules (terms like “contract” or\n“vehicle” or “security interest”)?\nUnsurprisingly, S-naturalists like Brink and Moore are also moral\nrealists, and also try to give accounts of artifact terms as picking\nout not “natural kinds” but “functional kinds”\n(Moore 1992a, pp. 207–208). \nOf course, even if the new theory of reference gives the correct\naccount of the meaning of some terms (like natural kind terms), that\nstill does not show that it gives us the right account of meaning for\npurposes of legal interpretation (cf. Munzer 1985). Suppose the\nlegislature prohibits the killing of “fish” within 100\nmiles of the coast, intending quite clearly (as the legislative\nhistory reveals) to protect whales, but not realizing that\n“fish” is a natural kind term that does not include whales\nwithin its extension. The new theory of reference tells us that the\nstatute protects sea bass but not whales, yet surely a court that\ninterpreted the statute as also protecting whales would not be making\na mistake. Indeed, one might think the reverse is true: for a court\nnot to protect whales would be to contravene the will of the\nlegislature, and thus, indirectly, the will of the people. What the\nexample suggests is that the correct theory of legal interpretation is\nnot a mere matter of philosophical semantics: issues about\npolitical legitimacy—about the conditions under which\nthe exercise of coercive power by courts can be justified—must\ninform theories of legal interpretation, and such considerations may\neven trump considerations of semantics.","contact.mail":"bleiter@uchicago.edu","contact.domain":"uchicago.edu"},{"date.published":"2002-07-15","date.changed":"2017-03-27","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-naturalism/","author1":"Brian Leiter","author2":"Matthew X.

Methodological naturalists (M-naturalists) view\nphilosophy as continuous with empirical inquiry in the sciences. Some\nM-naturalists want to replace conceptual and justificatory\ntheories with empirical and descriptive theories; they take their\ninspiration from more-or-less Quinean arguments against conceptual\nanalysis and foundationalist programs. Other M-naturalists retain the\nnormative and regulative ambitions of traditional philosophy,\nbut emphasize that it is an empirical question what normative\nadvice is actually useable and effective for creatures like us. Some\nM-naturalists are also substantive naturalists\n(S-naturalists). Ontological S-naturalism is the view that there exist\nonly natural or physical things; semantic\nS-naturalism is the view that a suitable philosophical analysis of any\nconcept must show it to be amenable to empirical inquiry. Each of\nthese varieties of naturalism has applications in legal philosophy.\nReplacement forms of M-naturalism hold that: (1) conceptual\nanalysis of the concept of law should be replaced by reliance on the\nbest social scientific explanations of legal phenomena, and (2)\nnormative theories of adjudication should be replaced by empirical\ntheories. These views are associated with American Legal Realism and\nBrian Leiter’s reinterpretation of Realism. Normative\nM-naturalists, by contrast, inspired and led by Alvin Goldman, seek to\nbring empirical results to bear on philosophical and foundational\nquestions about adjudication, the legal rules of evidence and\ndiscovery, the adversarial process, and so forth. Within legal\nphilosophy, S-naturalism has featured most prominently in the writings\nof the Scandinavian Legal Realists (long predating the resurgence of\nnaturalism in Anglophone jurisprudence), whose Ontological\nS-naturalism led them to employ a familiar range of\nnaturalism-motivated explanatory strategies, including naturalistic\nreduction of legal concepts and non-cognitivist accounts of important\naspects of legal discourse. S-naturalism also can serve, and sometimes\nhas served, as a motivation for Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American\njurisprudential tradition. More recent forms of S-naturalism,\nassociated with a revival of a kind of natural law theory defended by\nDavid Brink and Michael Moore (among others), applies the\n“new” or “causal” theory of reference to\nquestions of legal interpretation, including the interpretation of\nmoral concepts as they figure in legal rules.\n\nDifferent philosophical doctrines travel under the heading of\n“naturalism.” We can usefully distinguish two broad and\nimportant categories: methodological (or M-naturalism) and\nsubstantive (or S-naturalism) (Leiter 1998; cf. Railton 1990\nand Goldman 1994). Naturalism in philosophy is most often a\nmethodological view to the effect that philosophical\ntheorizing should be continuous with empirical inquiry in the\nsciences. Such a view need not presuppose a solution to the so-called\n“demarcation problem”—i.e., the problem of what\ndemarcates genuine science from pseudo-science—as long as there\nremain clear, paradigmatic cases of successful sciences. Some\nM-naturalists want “continuity with” only the\nhard or physical sciences (Hard M-naturalists);\nothers seek “continuity with” any successful science,\nnatural or social (Soft M-naturalists). Soft M-naturalism is probably\nthe dominant strand in philosophy today. \nFor M-naturalists, “continuity with” the sciences\nincludes, in the first instance, the Quinean repudiation of a\n“first philosophy,” a philosophical solution to problems\nthat proceeds entirely a priori, that is, without the benefit\nof empirical evidence. (Most M-naturalists do not go as far as Quine,\nhowever, in repudiating any role for a priori\nconceptual analysis: see, e.g., Goldman 1986 for a more typical\nM-naturalist approach). Beyond hostility to methods that are\nexclusively a priori, M-naturalists require continuity with\nthe sciences in two more precise senses, which we may call\n“Results Continuity” and “Methods\nContinuity.” \nResults Continuity requires that the substantive claims of\nphilosophical theories be supported or justified by the results of the\nsciences. Epistemologists like Goldman look to the results of\npsychology and cognitive science to find out how the human cognitive\napparatus really works; only with that information in hand can the\nepistemologist construct norms for how humans ought to form\nbeliefs (Goldman 1978, 1986). Moral philosophers like Gibbard and\nRailton, despite profound substantive disagreements, both think that a\nsatisfactory account of morality’s nature and function must be\nsupported by the results of evolutionary biology, our best going\ntheory for how we got to be the way we are (Gibbard 1990, Railton\n1986). A philosophical account of morality that explains its nature\nand function in ways that would be impossible according to\nevolutionary theory would not, by naturalistic scruples, be an\nacceptable philosophical theory. \n“Methods Continuity,” by contrast, demands only that\nphilosophical theories emulate the “methods” of inquiry of\nsuccessful sciences. “Methods” should be construed broadly\nhere to encompass not only, say, the experimental method, but also the\nstyles of explanation (e.g., identification of causes that determine,\nceteris paribus, their effects) employed in the sciences.\nSuch a view does not presuppose the methodological unity of\nthe various sciences, only that successful sciences have some\nmethodological uniqueness, even if this is not exactly the\nsame across all the sciences. Historically, Methods Continuity has\nconstituted the most important type of naturalism in philosophy, found\nin writers like Spinoza, Hume, and Nietzsche. (However, unlike the\ncontemporary M-naturalists who draw on the actual results of\nestablished sciences, many historical M-naturalists drawn to Methods\nContinuity simply try to emulate a scientific way of\nunderstanding the world in developing their philosophical\ntheories.) \nM-naturalists, then, construct philosophical theories that are\ncontinuous with the sciences either in virtue of their dependence upon\nthe actual results of scientific method in different domains or in\nvirtue of their employment and emulation of distinctively scientific\nways of looking at and explaining things. We may still distinguish\nbetween two different branches of M-naturalism, represented best by\nQuine, on the hand, and Goldman, on the other. The former we will call\nReplacement Naturalism, the latter Normative Naturalism.\nGoldman’s paradigm of Normative Naturalism has dominated\nphilosophical research in the area (see Kitcher 1992), though it is\nQuine’s notion of Replacement Naturalism that proves useful for\nunderstanding the American Legal Realists as naturalists in legal\nphilosophy (Leiter 1997). Since both Replacement and Normative\nNaturalists share the methodological commitment distinctive\nof naturalism—to make philosophical theorizing continuous with\nand dependent upon scientific theorizing—the difference must be\nlocated elsewhere: not in methodology, but in goal. According to\nReplacement Naturalists, the goal of theorizing is description or\nexplanation; to that end, conceptual and justificatory theories are to\nbe replaced by empirical and descriptive theories. According\nto Normative Naturalists, the goal is regulation of practice through\nthe promulgation of norms or standards. Of course, traditional\nepistemology also shares the regulative goal of Normative Naturalism;\nwhat distinguishes the Normative Naturalist is simply the\nmethods employed to realize this objective (cf. Goldman 1986,\npp. 6–9). \nMany naturalists go beyond methodological naturalism, however, and\nembrace a substantive doctrine. S-naturalism in philosophy is\neither the (ontological) view that the only things that exist are\nnatural or physical things; or the (semantic) view\nthat a suitable philosophical analysis of any concept must show it to\nbe amenable to empirical inquiry. In the ontological sense,\nS-naturalism is often taken to entail physicalism, the doctrine that\nonly those properties picked out by the laws of the physical sciences\nare real. In the semantic sense, S-naturalism is just the view that\npredicates must be analyzable in terms that admit of empirical\ninquiry: so, e.g., a semantic S-naturalist might claim that\n“morally good” can be analyzed in terms of characteristics\nlike “maximizing human well-being” that admit of empirical\ninquiry by psychology and physiology (assuming that well-being is a\ncomplex psycho-physical state). \nMany philosophers are drawn to some type of S-naturalism in virtue of\ntheir M-naturalism: being a philosophical naturalist in the\nmethodological sense sometimes leads a philosopher to think that the\nbest philosophical account of some concept or domain will be in terms\nthat are substantively naturalistic. It is important to notice that a\ncommitment to Methodological Naturalism does not entail any\nsubstantive conclusions, however: methodologically, it is an open\nquestion whether the best philosophical account of morality or\nmentality or law must be in substantively naturalistic terms. \nThe varieties of philosophical naturalism map on to a variety of\nnaturalistic approaches in legal philosophy. The most radical version\nof M-naturalism, Replacement Naturalism, is articulated and defended\nin Leiter (2001b, 2001c) and, arguably, in the American Legal Realists\n(Llewellyn 1930; Moore and Callahan 1943; Leiter 1997) (for pertinent\ndoubts about the radical program, however, see [Farrell 2006] and\n[Leiter 2007, p. 192]). The less radical form of M-naturalism,\nNormative Naturalism, is exemplified in epistemology by Goldman (1978,\n1986), as noted, but its implications for jurisprudence and law have,\nto date, only been partly developed (Allen & Leiter 2001; Goldman\n1999; Leiter 1998, 2001c; Talbott & Goldman 1998). S-naturalism\nfeatures most prominently in the writings of the Scandinavian Legal\nRealists. S-naturalism also can (and intermittently has) played a role\nin motivating Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American\nlegal-philosophical tradition. More recently, S-naturalism without\nnormative skepticism has been defended by contemporary moral realists\nand natural law theorists like Brink (1988, 1989, 2001) and Moore\n(1985, 1992b). \nReplacement Naturalism holds that conceptual and justificatory\ntheories—the traditional fare of philosophy—are to be\nreplaced by empirical and descriptive theories. There are two\nkinds of argumentative routes to Replacement Naturalism, both due to\nQuine: the first arises from doubts about the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction (Quine 1951); the second from doubts about foundationalism\n(Quine 1969). Here we consider the former. \nPhilosophers have long thought that some truths were\nnecessary while others were contingent; in the\ntwentieth-century, under the influence of logical positivism, this was\ntaken to be the distinction between those statements that were\n“true in virtue of meaning” (hence necessarily\ntrue) and those that were “true in virtue of fact” (hence\nonly contingently true). The former “analytic”\ntruths were the proper domain of philosophy; the latter\n“synthetic” truths the proper domain of empirical science.\nQuine argued that the distinction could not be sustained: all\nstatements are, in principle, answerable to experience, and,\nconversely, all statements can be maintained in the face of experience\nas long as we adjust other parts of our picture of the world. So there\nis no real distinction between claims that are “true in virtue\nof meaning” and “true in virtue of facts,” or\nbetween ‘necessary’ and ‘contingent’ truths;\nthere is simply the socio-historical fact that, at any given point in\nthe history of inquiry, there are some statements we are unlikely to\ngive up in the face of recalcitrant empirical evidence, and others\nthat we are quite willing to give up when empirical evidence\nconflicts. \nWithout a domain of analytic truths—truths that are a\npriori and hold in virtue of meaning—it becomes unclear\nwhat special domain of expertise for philosophical reflection remains.\nIf all claims are, in principle, revisable in light of empirical\nevidence, why not let all questions fall to empirical science?\nPhilosophy would be out of business, except perhaps as the abstract,\nreflective branch of empirical science. This Quinean attack has\nconsequences for the traditional philosophical business of conceptual\nanalysis, since on the dominant view from Plato through Carnap\n“every analysis of a concept is inextricably bound to a\ncollection of purported analyticities” (Laurence & Margolis\n1999, p. 18). (Even the more recent “possession-condition”\naccount of concepts in Peacocke (1992) requires that it be\nanalytic that certain inferential transitions are privileged\nby a particular concept.) The conclusion Replacement Naturalists draw\nfrom the preceding is that since any claim of conceptual analysis is\nvulnerable to the demands of a posteriori (i.e., empirical)\ntheory construction, philosophy must proceed in tandem with empirical\nscience, not as the arbiter of its claims, but as a reflective attempt\nat synoptic clarity about the state of empirical knowledge. \nMany resist this conclusion. According to one proponent, a conceptual\nanalysis proceeds “by appeal to what seems to us most obvious\nand central about [the concept in question]…as revealed by our\nintuitions about possible cases” (Jackson 1998, p. 31).\n“[T]he general coincidence in intuitive responses [to possible\ncases] reveals something about the folk theory of [the concept in\nquestion]” (Jackson, 1998, p. 32). The question that plagues\nconceptual analysis, post-Quine, is what kind of knowledge\nsuch a procedure actually yields? Why should ordinary intuitions about\nthe extension of a concept be deemed reliable or informative? Why\nthink the “folk” are right? \nThe track record of a priori methods like appeal to\nintuitions and conceptual analysis is not a promising one (e.g.,\nHarman 1994; Hintikka 1999). Kant, for example, took it to be a\npriori that space necessarily had the structure described by\nEuclidean geometry; subsequent physics showed his intuitions to be\nmistaken. The moral naturalists would draw from this track record of\na priori philosophy is well-expressed by Cummins (1999, pp.\n117–18): \nFor the Replacement Naturalist, in short, the only sound reason to\nprefer a proposed conceptual analysis is not because it seems\nintuitively obvious, but because it earns its place by figuring in\nsuccessful a posteriori theories of the world. Philosophy\ncum conceptual analysis and intuition-pumping should be\nabandoned in favor of empirical science; philosophy is simply the more\nabstract and reflective part of empirical science and lays claim to no\ndistinctive methods or body of knowledge. \nDefenders of conceptual analysis, it is true, commonly proclaim the\nmodesty of their ambitions; indeed, Jackson specifically chastises\nconceptual analysis in its “immodest role,” namely when\n“it gives intuitions…too big a place in determining what\nthe world is like” (1998, pp. 43–44): “There is\nnothing sacrosanct about folk theory. It has served us well but not so\nwell that it would be irrational to make changes to it in the light of\nreflection on exactly what it involves, and in the light of one or\nanother empirical discovery about us and our world” (Jackson\n1998, p. 44). The question is, having conceded this much, what\nremains? Conceptual analysis, as Jackson conceives it, becomes hard to\ndistinguish from banal descriptive sociology of the Gallup-poll\nvariety. (Jackson even says he advocates, when necessary, “doing\nserious opinion polls on people’s responses to various\ncases” [1998, p. 36].) Such a procedure might deliver\nsome insight in to what some people, at some time, in some place,\nthink about “mind” or “law” or\n“justice,” but Replacement Naturalists wonder what\nphilosophical import any of this data could have, since it is bounded\nnot simply by time and place, but also ignorance. Yet, as Farrell\n(2006) has rargued, such a procedure may serve an important\ntheoretical purpose, even if its claims are vulnerable to\nrevision. \nHow might Replacement Naturalism in legal philosophy, motivated by\nthese Quinean doubts about conceptual analysis and intuitions,\nproceed? One possibility is suggested in Leiter (2001b), which invokes\nthe following example. Raz (1985) has offered an influential\nconceptual argument against Soft Positivism’s claim that there\nis no constraint on the content of a rule of recognition beyond the\nfact that it is a social rule: its existence-conditions are given by\nthe actual practice of officials in deciding disputes, but what\ncriteria of legality officials appeal to (i.e., the content\nof the rule of recognition) is dependent upon whatever the\nconventional practice of officials in that society happens to be. Raz\noffers an analysis of the concept of authority to show that Soft\nPositivism is incompatible, even in principle, with the law’s\npossessing the authority it claims to possess. According to Raz, it is\na non-normative prerequisite for a claim to authority that it be\npossible to identify the authority’s directive without reference\nto the underlying “dependent” reasons for that directive.\nThis is a prerequisite for authority because what\ndistinguishes a (practical) authority, on Raz’s\n“service” conception, is that its directives preempt\nconsideration of the underlying reasons for what we ought to do, and\nin so doing actually makes it more likely that we will do what we\nreally ought to do. Authoritative reasons are claimed to be\nexclusionary reasons, excluding from consideration those dependent\nreasons (including, importantly, moral reasons) on which the\nauthoritative directive rests. Soft Positivism, then, undermines the\npossibility of the rule of recognition claiming authority, since for\nSoft Positivism a rule of recognition can, in principle, employ\ndependent reasons as criteria of legal validity: to identify, then,\nthe directives about legal validity of such a rule of recognition\nwould be impossible without recourse to precisely the dependent\nreasons the rule was supposed to preempt. \nOne line of response to Raz has appealed to contrary intuitions about\nthe concept of authority. Perry (1987), for example, argues that\nauthoritative reasons need not be exclusionary in Raz’s sense;\nit suffices, Perry says, that they simply be “weightier”\nthan other reasons. Some commentators’ intuitions line up with\nRaz’s (Leiter 2001b), others with Perry (Waluchow 1994). Now, of\ncourse, the Quinean worries about conceptual analysis hold even in\ncases where everyone’s intuitions about a concept coincide; but\nwhen they do not coincide, the inadequacies of the philosophical\n“methods” at hand seem especially acute. Some proponents\nof traditional methods of legal philosophy object that “the mere\nfact that there is disagreement about what the conceptual truths of\nlaw are…does not mean that conceptual analysis of law is\nfruitless. If that were the case, we should have to conclude the same\nabout philosophy generally” (Coleman 2001, p. 211 n. 38).\nUnfortunately, this reductio response depends on a conclusion\nthat the Replacement Naturalist is, in fact, prepared to\nembrace—and not because the Replacement Naturalist naively\nbelieves empirical methods “would…put an end to disputes\nabout the nature of law or anything else” (Coleman 2001, p. 211\nn.38). The worry, rather, is that intuitions about concepts enjoy no\nprivileged epistemic status, while claims in empirical science do.\nEven if empirical science does not resolve these disputes, it at least\ndelineates criteria with epistemic weight for adjudicating them. The\ncrucial question, then, becomes whether our best empirical science\nrequires drawing the conceptual lines one way rather than another. \nThe leading social scientific accounts of judicial\ndecision-making—both the informal ones (Pritchett 1949, Powe\n2000) and the formal ones (Segal & Spaeth 1993)—have two\nstriking features in this regard: first, they all aim to account for\nthe relative causal contribution of “law” and non-law\nfactors (e.g., political ideologies or “attitudes”) to\njudicial decisions; and second, they demarcate “law” from\nnon-law factors in typical Hard Positivist terms, i.e., they generally\ntreat as “law” only pedigreed norms, like legislative\nenactments and prior holdings of courts (as well, sometimes, as the\ninterpretive methods applied to these kinds of legal sources: see the\ntreatment of the “legal model” in Segal & Spaeth 1993,\npp. 33–53). If these models were ultimately vindicated\nempirically—and not just for American courts—this would\ngive the Replacement Naturalist reason to abandon any a\npriori, intuitive confidence we had about the concept of law that\nconflicted with Hard Positivism—just as the role of\nnon-Euclidean geometry in parts of physics has led everyone\nto repudiate Kant’s a priori intuitive confidence about\nthe Euclidean structure of space. If social science really cuts the\ncausal joints of the legal world in Hard Positivist terms, the\nReplacement Naturalist argues, that is a compelling reason to work\nwith that concept of law as against its competitors. \nProponents of conceptual analysis, by contrast, are skeptical that the\nexplanatory premises of empirical social scientists give us any reason\nto prefer one concept of law to another. Notice, of course, that an\nanalogous skepticism is available to the diehard Euclidean: after all,\nnon-Euclidean geometries are famously non-intuitive and hard to grasp.\nBut Kantians recognize that such a response would be unmotivated: if\nnon-Euclidean geometry does explanatory work within successful\nphysical theory, then the right conclusion to draw is that our\nintuitions about the structure of space need tutoring to keep pace\nwith empirical knowledge. So, too, the analogous question for the\nnatural lawyer or Soft Positivist is: why think your intuitions are\nepistemically privileged as opposed to simply untutored by the best\nempirical science? \nThe skeptic, however, might refine the challenge as follows:\n“It’s not,” she might say, “that I insist on\nsticking to my intuitions, empirical science be damned. Rather, I do\nnot see why the empirical science at issue needs to take\nsides on a dispute about the concept of law.” Of course, it is\nclear that the empirical social science at issue draws the line\nbetween legal and non-legal norms based on pedigree criteria, but the\nquestion is whether it needs to: the natural lawyer could\nagree with the social scientists that, e.g., moral and political\nconsiderations determine judicial decisions, but contest the\nassumption that these considerations are not themselves legally\nbinding. \nThe difficulty, of course, is that the candidate non-law explanatory\nfactors at issue (e.g., an ideological commitment to the platforms of\nthe Republican Party) are not plausible candidates for being legal\nnorms, on any existing theory of the concept of law. Moreover, there\nare good reasons why social science treats the explanatory factors at\nissue as non-legal: for example, the moral and political attitudes\ninvoked to explain decisions do not, for example, appear explicitly in\nthe text of the decisions, or in the explicit rationales for the\ndecisions; they are often hidden and hard to detect,\nwhich make them quite unlike any of the paradigm instances of legal\nnorms, like statutory provisions or precedent. Finally, the\nlegal/non-legal demarcation in empirical social science usually\nreflects more general explanatory premises about the psycho-social\nfactors that account for behavior, well beyond the realm of the legal.\nThe motivation for demarcating the legal/non-legal in essentially Hard\nPositivist terms is, for most social scientists, to effect an\nexplanatory unification of legal phenomena with other political and\nsocial behavior. \nYet the very talk of “legal phenomena” may invite a\ndifferent kind of objection to the proposed naturalization of\njurisprudential questions. For how is it, one might wonder, that the\nsocial scientist knows these are legal phenomena he is\nexplaining, and not phenomena of some other kind? Does that not\nalready presuppose an analysis of the concept of law? (Cf. Coleman\n2001, pp. 213–214.) It is not obvious, though, why a shared\nlanguage and dictionaries won’t suffice to get empirical science\noff the ground; it is not that empirical science needs\nconceptual analysis to tell his explanatory story, it’s rather\nthat after the fact the philosopher may be able to offer some\ngreater reflective clarity about the concepts invoked in the\nexplanatory story. Conceptual philosophers are keen to insist that\nthey are not lexicographers; but the intelligibility of empirical\nscience can get a long way with lexicography alone. To the extent a\nconceptual analysis helps, it helps after we discover which\nway of cutting the causal joints of the social world works best,\naccording to the naturalist. \nAll these rejoinders on behalf of naturalism, however, are predicated\non the assumption that we have a robust social scientific account of\nlaw. Yet it is now plain we do not (see, e.g., Leiter 2007, pp. 192\nff.). The best social-scientific accounts of adjudication, for\nexample, boast predictive success that is so feeble (better than\ncoin-tosses, but not much!) that their explanatory models, with their\nimplicit concepts of law, earn no epistemic credence. When it comes to\nthe “concept of law” itself, we may have nothing more than\nintuitions, however epistemically feeble, on which to rely. And\nperhaps they are not as epistemically feeble as the naturalist\noriginally thought? Law, after all, is not a natural kind, but a\ncomplicated kind of social artifact, and it seems far more plausible\nthat social artifacts will depend on folk intuitions and how people\nuse language: so perhaps Hart’s methodology is the right one\nafter all for its subject-matter (cf. Langlinais & Leiter\n2016)? \nThe locus classicus of the second kind of Replacement\nNaturalism—the one deriving from an attack on\nfoundationalism—is Quine (1969). The central enterprise of\nepistemology on Quine’s view is to understand the relation\nbetween our theories of the world and the evidence (sensory input) on\nwhich they are based. Quine’s target is one influential\nconstrual of this project: Cartesian foundationalism, particularly in\nthe sophisticated form given to it in the twentieth-century by Rudolf\nCarnap in Der Logische Aufbau der Welt (1928). The\nfoundationalist wants an account of the theory-evidence relation that\nwould vindicate the privileged epistemic status of at least some\nsubset of our theories: our theories (in particular, our best theories\nof natural science) are to be “grounded” in indubitable\nevidence (i.e., immediate sense impressions). Quine deems\nfoundationalism to be a failure: the semantic part of the program is\nrendered unrealizable by meaning holism on the one hand (theoretical\nterms get their meanings from their place in the whole theoretical\nframework, not in virtue of some point-by-point contact with sensory\ninput), while the epistemic part of the program is defeated by the\nDuhem–Quine thesis about the underdetermination of theory by\nevidence on the other (there is always more than one theory consistent\nwith the evidence, in part, because a theoretical hypothesis can\nalways be preserved in the face of recalcitrant evidence by abandoning\nthe auxiliary hypotheses that informed the test of the hypothesis)\n(see Kim 1988, pp. 385–386). \nWhat becomes, then, of epistemology? Hilary Kornblith has summed up\nQuine’s view as follows: “Once we see the sterility of the\nfoundationalist program, we see that the only genuine questions there\nare to ask about the relation between theory and evidence and about\nthe acquisition of belief are psychological questions”\n(Kornblith 1994, p. 4). This view Kornblith aptly dubs Quine’s\n“replacement thesis”: “the view that epistemological\nquestions may be replaced by psychological questions” (Kornblith\n1994, p. 3). Here is how Quine puts it: \nSeveral pages later, Quine continues that on his proposal, \nThus Quine: the central concern of epistemology is the theory-evidence\nrelationship; if the foundationalist story about this relationship is\na failure, then that leaves only one story worth telling about this\nrelationship: namely, the story told by “a purely descriptive,\ncausal-nomological science of human cognition” (Kim 1988, p.\n388). The science of human cognition replaces armchair\nepistemology: we naturalize epistemology by turning over its central\nquestion—the relationship between theory and evidence—to\nthe relevant empirical science. \nWe can now generalize Quine’s point as follows (Leiter 1998).\nLet us say that a Replacement Naturalist in any branch of philosophy\nholds that: \nThis goes beyond Quine in one important respect: for Quine infers\nReplacement Naturalism only from the failure of\nfoundationalism—which is simply one possible normative\naccount of the evidence-theory relationship, but not the only one.\nQuine’s arguments simply do not show that no other normative\naccount of the evidence-theory relationship is possible. \nQuine has been extensively criticized on precisely this score (e.g.,\nGoldman 1986, pp. 2–3; Kim 1988). The key to a successful\ndefense of Replacement Naturalism lies in an explanation of why\nnormative theory without foundationalism is sterile. One\nworry is that without foundationalism, normative theories are\nbanal. Consider: it is now a familiar result of cognitive\npsychology that human beings regularly make mistakes in logical\nreasoning (cf. Stich 1994). So a mere descriptive theory of\nbelief-formation, of the sort Quine appears to recommend, would simply\nrecord these mistakes. But shouldn’t epistemology tell us that\nbeliefs ought not to be formed illogically? One can hardly\nimagine why Quine would disagree: one ought not to form\nbeliefs illogically. But the question is whether this piece of banal\nadvice adds up to a fruitful research program? The descriptive project\nof Replacement Naturalism may record certain irrational cognitive\nprocesses in studying the evidence-theory relationship, but given the\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence, even when we correct for\nlogical mistakes, we still won’t have an account of which of our\ntheoretical beliefs are warranted and which are not. The Quinean\nintuition is we’ll learn more from the empirical inquiry, than\nfrom systematizing our banal normative intuitions about irrationality.\nMore generally, unless we have some foundational point\noutside our epistemic practices from which to assess the epistemic\nissues, the project of systematizing our mundane normative intuitions\nwill simply collapse into the descriptive sociology of knowledge. If\nwe can’t stand outside the epistemological boat, then we can do\nno more than report what it is we do. But it is precisely the\nviability of such an external standpoint that Quine denies in his\nembrace of the metaphor of Neurath’s boat. So from within the\nboat, there is nothing to do but description. \nQuine’s argument for Replacement Naturalism, recall, moved in\ntwo steps. Step one was anti-foundationalism: no unique\ntheory is justified on the basis of the evidential input. Step two was\nreplacement: since no foundational story can be told about\nthe relation between input (evidence) and output (theory), we should\nreplace the normative program with a purely descriptive inquiry, e.g.\nthe psychological study of what input causes what output. We can find\nanalogues of both steps in the approach to the theory of adjudication\noffered by American Legal Realism. \nTheory of adjudication is concerned not with the relationship\nbetween “evidence” and “scientific theory,”\nbut rather with the justificatory relationship between “legal\nreasons” (the input, as it were) and judicial decision (the\noutput): theory of adjudication tries to tell judges how they\nought to justify their decisions, i.e. it seeks to\n“ground” judicial decision-making in reasons that require\nunique outcomes. The American Legal Realists are\n“anti-foundationalists” about judicial decisions in the\nsense that they deny that the legal reasons justify a unique decision:\nthe legal reasons underdetermine the decision (at least in most cases\nactually litigated). More precisely, the Realists claim that the law\nis rationally indeterminate in the sense that the class of\nlegal reasons—i.e., the class of legitimate reasons a judge may\noffer for a decision—does not provide a justification\nfor a unique outcome. Just as sensory input does not justify\na unique scientific theory, so legal reasons, according to the\nRealists, do not justify a unique decision. \nThe Realists also take the second step that Quine takes: replacement.\nAccording to the Realist indeterminacy thesis, legal reasons do not\njustify a unique decision, meaning that the foundationalist enterprise\nof theory of adjudication is impossible. Why not replace, then, the\n“sterile” foundational program of justifying some one\nlegal outcome on the basis of the applicable legal reasons, with a\ndescriptive/explanatory account of what input (that is, what\ncombination of facts and reasons) produces what output (i.e., what\njudicial decision)? As Underhill Moore puts it at the beginning of one\nof his articles: “This study lies within the province of\njurisprudence. It also lies within the field of behavioristic\npsychology. It places the province within the field” (Moore\n& Callahan 1943, p. 1). Notice how closely this echoes\nQuine’s idea that, “Epistemology…simply falls into\nplace as a chapter of psychology…” (1969, p. 82).\nJurisprudence—or, more precisely, the theory of\nadjudication—is “naturalized” because it falls into\nplace, for the Realist, as a chapter of psychology (or economics or\nsociology, etc.). Moreover, it does so for essentially Quinean\nreasons: because the foundational account of adjudication is a\nfailure—a consequence of accepting the Realists’ famous\nclaim that the law is indeterminate. \nOf course, this argument for Replacement Naturalism only seems to work\nagainst “formalist” theories of adjudication that are\ncommitted to the rational determinacy of law. But, some object,\n“No contemporary analytic jurisprudent is a formalist”\n(Coleman 1998, p. 284), and some have even claimed that the\n“formalists” the Legal Realists opposed were not committed\nto the rational determinacy of law (Paulson 2001, p. 78). Both\nobjections seem mistaken: Dworkin, for example, is committed to the\nrational determinacy of law in exactly the sense at issue for the\nReplacement argument. And it is even conceded that all legal theorists\nare committed to the rational determinacy of law in “at least\nsome legal disputes” (Coleman 1998, p. 284), thus making them\nvulnerable, in principle, to the Replacement argument. The targets of\nthe Legal Realist critique were, equally, committed to the rational\ndeterminacy of law; indeed, it would be impossible to make sense of\nwhat the Realists were doing if that were not so. The Replacement\nNaturalist might take the view that there is no reason to call for\n“naturalizing” theory of adjudication in those range of\ncases where legal reasons are satisfactory predictors of\nlegal outcomes (i.e., precisely those cases where the foundationalist\nprogram can be carried out). One may worry, again, about whether there\nis an interesting or fruitful normative story to be\ntold (rather than a merely banal descriptive sociology), but it\nsuffices for the analogy with Quine that there remains some\nsubstantial domain of cases where the foundational program can not be\ncarried out, so that the case for replacement remains intact. \nThe real difficulty, of course, pertains not to these historical\npoints, but to whether or not the project of a normative theory of\nadjudication warrants replacement just because rational determinacy\ndoes not obtain. As in the Quinean case, the Replacement Naturalist\nmust maintain that without rational determinacy, normative theories of\nadjudication are banal, mere exercises in descriptive sociology.\nCritics of Replacement Naturalism contest this conclusion, though more\nby way of affirmation than argument (Coleman 1998, p. 285 n. 44).\nHowever, if the objection under consideration were correct, then a\nnormative theory that specifies what the anti-foundationalist\nconcedes—namely, that there is more than one (though not simply\nany) judicial decision that can be justified on the basis of the class\nof legal reasons—must, in some measure, be a theory worth\nhaving. Arguably, such a theory might be adequate to deflect the\nchallenge to the political legitimacy of adjudication based\non the indeterminacy of law, but does it provide the\nnormative guidance to judges we want from a theory? Does a\ntheory that tells judges they would be justified (on the basis of the\nclass of legal reasons) in deciding for the plaintiff on theory\nX or the defendant on theory Y (but not the\nplaintiff or defendant on theory Z!) really provide normative guidance\nfor judges worth having? The Replacement Naturalist answers in the\nnegative: better to have a descriptive account of inputs and outputs,\none that would license prediction of judicial behavior, than an\nindeterminate normative theory. This response, of course, makes\nReplacement Naturalism vulnerable to conflicting intuitions about the\nfruitfulness or sterility of different kinds of theorizing. \nThere are other limits to the Quinean analogy (Leiter 2001a, pp.\n284–285; Greenberg 2011 disputes other aspects of the analogy,\nwhile Leiter 2011 replies to some of Greenberg’s objections).\nFirst, the American Legal Realists end up presupposing a theory of the\nconcept of legality in framing their arguments for law’s\nindeterminacy (Leiter 2001a, pp. 292–293); thus, while they may\nbelieve the only fruitful account of adjudication is\ndescriptive and empirical, not normative and conceptual, they\nthemselves need a concept of law that is not—at least\non the arguments considered so far—empirical or naturalized. As\none critic of Replacement Naturalism notes: “the naturalist is\ncommitted as a conceptual matter to the existence of a test of\nlegality…. The naturalist is thus in the same boat with ever\nother analytic philosopher of law” (Coleman 2001, p. 214). The\nanalogy with naturalized epistemology, in other words, must be\nlocalized to the theory of adjudication, and not the whole of\njurisprudence. Of course, it remains possible for the Replacement\nNaturalist to argue for the requisite concept of legality on precisely\nthe empirical grounds noted in the previous section\n(“Replacement Naturalism I: Against Conceptual Analysis”).\nBut as it stands, the analogy to Quine’s attack on\nfoundationalist epistemology warrants no radical abandonment of\ntraditional conceptual analysis across the board. \nA second difference from Quine is also important: for the crux of the\nLegal Realist position (at least for the majority of Realists) is that\nnon-legal reasons (e.g., judgments of fairness, or consideration of\ncommercial norms) explain the decisions. They, of course,\nexplain the decisions by justifying them, though not\nnecessarily by justifying a unique outcome (i.e., the non-legal\nreasons might themselves rationalize other decisions as well). Now\nclearly the descriptive story about the non-legal reasons is not going\nto be part of a non-mentalistic naturalization of the theory of\nadjudication: a causal explanation of decisions in terms of reasons\n(even non-legal reasons) does require taking the normative force of\nthe reasons qua reasons seriously. The behaviorism of Quine\nor Underhill Moore is not in the offing here, but surely this is to be\npreferred: behaviorism failed as a foundation for empirical social\nscience, while social-scientific theories employing mentalistic\ncategories have flourished. Moreover, if the non-legal reasons are\nthemselves indeterminate—i.e., if they do not justify a\nunique outcome—then any causal explanation of the\ndecision will have to go beyond reasons to identify the psycho-social\nfacts (e.g., about personality, class, gender, socialization, etc.)\nthat cause the decision. Such a “naturalization” of the\ntheory of adjudication might be insufficiently austere in its ontology\nfor Quinean scruples, but it is still a recognizable attempt to\nsubsume what judges do within a (social) scientific framework. \nLike the traditional epistemologist, the Normative Naturalist embraces\nas his goal the promulgation of norms by which to regulate our\nepistemic practices (to govern how we should acquire and weigh\nevidence, as well as, ultimately, form beliefs). Unlike the\nnon-naturalist, however, the Normative Naturalist does not think\nepistemic norms can be adequately formulated from the armchair:\nnormative theorizing must be continuous with scientific theorizing.\nBut if this is not just to collapse into Replacement Naturalism then\nwhat does the M-naturalist credo amount to in the normative case?\nConsider Goldman’s proposal: “Epistemics assumes that\ncognitive operations should be assessed instrumentally: given a choice\nof cognitive procedures, those which would produce the best set of\nconsequences should be selected” (1978, p. 520). The\nNormative Naturalist maintains that the reason the philosopher\ncan’t do armchair epistemology is because it is an a\nposteriori, empirical matter what norms in fact serve\nour epistemic or cognitive goals (e.g., forming true beliefs). Goldman\nemphasizes a particularly important instance of this general\npoint: \nSo the Normative Naturalist thinks that normative epistemology must be\ncontinuous with natural and social science in (at least) two senses:\n(i) we need to know what epistemic norms in fact lead to our forming\ntrue beliefs; and (ii) as a special case of (i), we need to identify\nepistemic norms actually usable by creatures like us. This rules out\ncertain (non-naturalistic) epistemic norms which require of cognizers\nbelief-formation practices beyond their ken (Goldman 1978, pp.\n512–513). The Normative Naturalist, in short, emphasizes the\ninstrumental character of normative theorizing in\nepistemology, and then argues that the only way to assess instrumental\nclaims is empirically—to see what means really brings\nabout what ends. And that task can never be pursued a priori,\nfrom the armchair, simply by analyzing the meaning of the words\n“knowledge” or “justified” or\n“true.” \nOf course, it bears noting that the Normative Naturalist does not\ndispense entirely with conceptual analysis—to the\ncontrary. It is precisely, for example, Goldman’s proffered\nconceptual analyses of “knowledge” and\n“justification” that require him to turn to empirical\npsychology to fill in the actual content of epistemic norms. Unlike\nthe Quinean program, naturalization enters for the Normativist only,\nas it were, in applied epistemology. What many philosophers\nmight think of as “pure” epistemology—giving an\naccount of knowledge—continues to be an a priori\nenterprise, even though it is an enterprise that invokes notions (like\n“reliability” and “causation”) that require\na posteriori investigation to apply. \nThe Normative Naturalist in jurisprudence, too, views theoretical\nquestions instrumentally. The philosophical foundation of\nevidence law has, to date, received the most attention from this\nperspective (Allen & Leiter 2001; Leiter 2001d). We want to ask,\nas Goldman puts it, “Which [social] practices have a\ncomparatively favorable impact on knowledge as contrasted with error\nand ignorance?” (1999, p. 5). Normative naturalism is, in this\nrespect, veritistic (to borrow Goldman’s term): it is\nconcerned with the production of knowledge, meaning (in part)\ntrue belief (Goldman 1999, pp. 79–100). So the\nNormative Naturalist embraces as his goal the promulgation of norms by\nwhich to regulate our epistemic practices so that they yield\nknowledge. In the case of individual epistemology, this means\nthe norms governing how individuals should acquire and weigh evidence\nas well as, ultimately, form beliefs; in the case of social\nepistemology, this means the norms governing the social mechanisms and\npractices that inculcate belief. The legal rules of evidence, in turn,\nare a prime case of the latter: for these rules structure the\nepistemic process by which jurors arrive at beliefs about disputed\nmatters of fact at trials. As such, the rules of evidence are a\nnatural candidate for investigation by Normative Naturalists. We may\nask of any particular rule: does it increase the likelihood that\njurors will reach true beliefs about disputed matters of\nfact? (Of course, it does not make sense to ask that of every\nrule, since some rules of evidence—for example, Federal Rules of\nEvidence (FRE) 407–411—are not meant to facilitate the\ndiscovery of truth, but to carry out various policy objectives like\nreducing accidents and avoiding litigation.) That means, of course,\nasking an essentially empirical question: does this rule of\ninclusion or exclusion in fact increase the likelihood that\nfact finders, given what they are actually like, will achieve\nknowledge about disputed matters of fact (i.e., does it maximize\nveritistic value). Of course, many rules that on their face invite one\nkind of veritistic analysis require a very different kind in practice.\nSo, for example, FRE 404, on its face, excludes character\nevidence in most contexts, though, in fact, the exception in 404(b)\nlargely swallows the rule. Thus, while it might seem that we should\nask whether excluding character evidence maximizes veritistic\nvalue, the real question is whether admitting it does. The\nsame may be said for the hearsay rule. Although on its face, the\nhearsay doctrine is a rule of exclusion, in reality it is a rule of\nadmission: what the advocate must really know is how to get the\nproffered hearsay admitted under one of the multitude of exceptions to\nthe nominal rule of exclusion (FRE 802). Thus, the pertinent\nveritistic question concerns the veritistic credentials of the grounds\non which hearsay is admitted, rather than the veritistic reasons for\nexcluding it in most cases. (Such questions, in fact, are already a\nstaple of much evidence scholarship.) \nIn theory of adjudication, by contrast, the Normative Naturalist wants\nto identify norms for adjudication that will help judges realize\nadjudicative goals. Such norms must, once again, satisfy two\nnaturalistic constraints: first, they must, as a matter of empirical\nfact, be effective means to goals (“the Instrumental\nConstraint”); second, they must be constrained by relevant\nempirical facts about the nature and limitations of judges (“the\nOught-Implies-Can Constraint”) (Leiter 1998). \nDworkin’s theory of adjudication (Dworkin 1986) makes a popular\ntarget for the Normative Naturalist. Dworkin’s theory says, very\nroughly, that a judge should decide a case in such a way that it\ncoheres with the principle that explains some significant\nportion of the prior institutional history and provides the\nbest justification for that history as a matter of political\nmorality. Can a Normative Naturalist be a Dworkinian? \n(1) Instrumental Constraint: The naturalist assesses\nnormative advice relative to its actual effectiveness for realizing\nrelevant goals. What, then, is the relevant goal in\nadjudication? One candidate is surely this: we want to give\njudges normative advice that will lead them to reach fair or just\noutcomes. Thus, the naturalist’s question becomes: which piece\nof normative advice is most effective in really helping\nactual judges realize justice and fairness? It is, at least, an open\nquestion whether Dworkin’s methodology will be effective in\nleading judges to do fair things. The fact that his normative theory\nhas had almost no impact whatsoever on American judicial practice over\nthe last thirty years is at least defeasible evidence that it does not\nappear to be an effective methodology (let alone one\neffective for realizing justice!) (Leiter 1998, p. 102). This latter\npoint is related to the naturalist’s second, and more important\nobjection. \n(2) Ought-Implies-Can-Constraint: One thing judges\ncan not do is what Dworkin’s Judge Hercules does. This is a\nfamiliar complaint about Dworkin’s theory, but naturalized\njurisprudence gives it a principled foundation. The naturalistic\njurisprudent eschews all normative guidance unusable by real judges;\nlike his naturalized counterpart in epistemology, he does “not\nwant to give merely idle advice, which humans [including judges] are\nincapable of following” (Goldman 1978, p.510). Dworkin may give\njudges an “aspirational model” (to borrow Jules\nColeman’s apt phrase), and the naturalistic jurisprudent need\nnot dispute that; but Descartes gave us an aspirational model in\nepistemology as well, and that does not make his program any more\nadequate or relevant by the naturalist’s lights. (It\nwould be attractive if we could take certain “clear and\ndistinct” ideas, and build up all of knowledge from them.) The\nnaturalist wants normative advice effective for creatures like\nus; demanding of judges Herculean philosophical ingenuity\nviolates this constraint. Aspiration, the naturalist concludes, is not\na fit aim of normative advice, which must, first and foremost, offer\neffective means to ends. \nSubstantive naturalism begins with the idea that there exist only\nnatural things, things of the kind natural science describes.\n(Physicalism, a more severe form of S-naturalism, holds that there are\nonly physical things.) This ontological S-naturalism may,\nthough need not, go with semantic S-naturalism, according to which a\nsuitable philosophical analysis of any concept must show it to be\namenable to empirical inquiry. \nS-naturalism has played a significant role in at least three\nlegal-philosophical traditions: (1) the Scandinavian Legal Realists\n(like Alf Ross and Karl Olivecrona), whose austere ontological\nnaturalism, conjoined with moral anti-realism, shaped their\ndistinctive take on legal concepts; (2) Legal Positivists, for whom\nS-naturalism can be, and sometimes has been, a significant motivation,\nand (3) contemporary defenders of a kind of natural law theory (like\nDavid Brink, Michael Moore, and Nicos Stavropoulos), who invoke the\nCausal Theory of Reference associated with Kripke and Putnam to offer\nan interpretation of some legal predicates in substantively\nnaturalistic terms. \nScandinavian Legal Realism stands out from other major traditions in\nlegal philosophy for expressly placing naturalism—and\nS-naturalism in particular—at center stage. Perhaps the most\nstriking example of this comes in the preface to the Second Edition of\nKarl Olivecrona’s Law as Fact, where Olivecrona states that\nthe aim of his book is “to fit the complex phenomena covered by\nthe word law into the spatio-temporal world” (1971, p. vii). But\nS-naturalism is equally prominent in Alf Ross’ On Law and\nJustice (1959, p. 67; see also Spaak 2009, pp. 40–42),\nprobably the most internationally famous contribution to the\nScandinavian Realist tradition. Given the centrality of S-naturalism\nto Scandinavian Realism, it is unsurprising that a variety of familiar\nnaturalism-motivated philosophical gambits feature prominently in the\nmajor Scandinavian Realist texts. These include efforts at\nnaturalistic reduction of legal concepts, as well as non-cognitivist\nand error-theoretic accounts of important aspects of legal discourse.\n(Some particular examples are discussed below.) \nThe S-naturalism of the Scandinavian Realists is today viewed more as\nan intellectual-historical museum piece than as a live contender in\njurisprudential debate. That Scandinavian Realism should have fallen\nout of favor is not wholly unsurprising, given the strong influence of\nlogical positivism and the similar Uppsala school of philosophy on the\nphilosophical outlook and approach of the major Scandinavian Realists\n(Bjarup 1999, p. 774; see also Sandin 1962, p. 496): although many\nwould still sympathize broadly with the Scandinavian Realists’\nnaturalism, anti-metaphysical inclinations, and moral anti-realism,\ntheir specific versions of these doctrines have not, as a general\nmatter, aged well. Be that as it may, the poor long-term reception of\nthe Scandinavians may be owed, in large part, to a rather more\naccidental cause: the influence of Hart (1959). In an influential\nreview of Ross’ On Law and Justice—simply (and\nsomewhat misleadingly) titled “Scandinavian\nRealism”—Hart famously attacked a central pillar of\nRoss’ legal philosophy, namely his austerely naturalistic\nanalysis of the concept of legal validity. Ross (1962) responded in\nhis own review of Hart’s The Concept of Law, arguing\nthat Hart had misunderstood him and that their views, properly\nunderstood, were not so far apart. \nIn order to understand what it was that Ross proposed and that Hart\nfound so objectionable, it is best to begin with the opening pages of\nOn Law and Justice. There, Ross draws a distinction between\ntwo kinds of linguistic meaning: expressive and representative.\nAccording to Ross, all linguistic utterances, oral or written, have\nexpressive meaning (i.e., express something); but only some have\nrepresentative meaning, i.e., represent states of affairs in the\nworld. Here Ross contrasts an utterance like “my father is\ndead,” which has expressive and representative meaning, with\nutterances like “ouch!” and “shut the door,”\nwhich have expressive meaning only. Ross calls utterances with\nrepresentative meaning “assertions.” Utterances without\nrepresentative meaning he calls either “exclamations” or\n“directives”—the former if they are not intended to\nexert influence on others (as in the case of a reflexive cry of\n“ouch!”), the latter if they are intended to exert\ninfluence (as in the case of “shut the door”) (1959, pp.\n6–8). \nRoss holds that legal rules, such as statutory provisions, are\ndirectives. He explains that such rules are not meant to represent\nstates of affairs, but to influence behavior. Simply put, if a legal\nrule is laid down stating that certain behavior “shall be\npunished” or “gives rise to liability,” this is not\ndone to describe what courts would do anyway, but to direct\nthe behavior of courts (and, indirectly at least, the behavior of\nprivate individuals) (1959, pp. 8–9). \nWhat, then, of the legal utterances “occurring in a textbook of\nlaw”? Are these assertions or directives? At a surface level,\nRoss tells us, the language in such books will often be similar or\neven identical to the language in an actual statute: a doctrinal\nwriter might, for example, say that certain behavior “gives rise\nto liability” or “shall be punished.” But we should\nnot be misled by this surface similarity, Ross says: “the\npropositions in a textbook, at any rate to a certain extent, intend to\ndescribe, not to prescribe” (1959, p. 9). To that extent,\ntherefore, they must be assertions, not directives—specifically,\nRoss claims, assertions about what is valid law. \nAnd what does it mean to say that something is valid law? In effect,\nRoss tells us, it is to predict the behavior and thinking of courts.\nDetails aside, to say that “X is valid law” is\nin effect to say that (1) judges will act in accordance with\nX, and (2) in so acting, they will feel themselves bound to\ndo so. Hence, claims about what is valid law are claims about purely\nnatural-factual states of affairs: facts about the behavior and\npsychology of judges (1959, pp. 42, 73–74, 75). \nThe Hart–Ross dialogue revolved around the merits of this\nanalysis; Hart, for his part, found it altogether inadequate. Most\ncrucially and memorably, Hart argued that “even if in the mouth\nof the ordinary citizen or lawyer ‘this is a valid rule of\nEnglish law’ is a prediction of what [English]\njudge[s] will do, say and/or feel, this cannot be its\nmeaning in the mouth of a judge who is not engaged in predicting his\nown or others’ behaviour or feelings.” Instead, it is an\n“act of recognition” of “the rule in question as one\nsatisfying certain accepted general criteria for admissions as a rule\nof the system and so as a legal standard of behaviour” (1959, p.\n165). At root, Hart argued, Ross’ analysis of the concept of\nlegal validity fails because “the normal central use of\n‘legally valid’ is in an internal normative statement of a\nspecial kind” (1959, p. 167). \nLater, in his review of Hart’s The Concept of Law, Ross\nclaimed that Hart had misunderstood him. In his analysis of\n“valid law,” Ross replied, he had been concerned\nspecifically with “legal concepts as they function in the\ndoctrinal study of law, what we on the Continent are accustomed to\ncall the science of law,” and if this were adequately\nunderstood, it would be evident that much of the apparent disagreement\nbetween him and Hart was illusory (1962, p. 1190). In effect, Ross\nsaid, he had been analyzing legal statements of a kind Hart would have\nclassified as “external.” Ross chalked up the confusion at\nleast in part to the translation of the Danish phrase\n“gældende ret” as “valid law,”\nacknowledging that the results sounded “odd in English\nusage,” and suggesting in passing that “existing\nlaw” or “law in force” might have better captured\nwhat he had in mind. (For further discussion of the translation\nquestion, see Eng 2011.) \nA number of subsequent authors who have revisited the Hart–Ross\ndebate have expressed broad sympathy for Ross’ claims to have\nbeen misunderstood. (See Pattaro 2009, pp. 545–546; Eng 2011;\nHoltermann 2014, p. 166 n. 4.) Nonetheless, as a matter of\nintellectual history, Hart’s critique had its effect. There has,\nhowever, been a recent uptick in interest in Scandinavian Legal\nRealism, perhaps owing in part to a broader renewal of interest in\nnaturalism in legal philosophy. This has not been limited to strictly\nhistorical or exegetical work, but has included efforts to mine the\nScandinavian Realists’ writings for philosophical strategies or\ninsights that might help advance contemporary legal philosophy, or to\noffer fruitful rational reconstructions of their ideas. (See, e.g.,\nHoltermann 2014; Spaak 2014, Ch. 10.) \nOne topic of some contemporary interest to which the Scandinavian\nRealists may be relevant is the possibility of understanding legal\nlanguage in expressivist and/or non-cognitivist terms. Largely\nowing to Kevin Toh’s work on the subject, there has been some\nrecent interest in legal (or “meta-legal”) expressivism,\nthat is, treatments of legal statements as expressions of distinctive\n(perhaps conative) mental states. (See Toh 2005; Toh 2011.)\nContemporary legal expressivists might look to the Scandinavian\nRealists as intellectual forebears of a sort, given the prominence of\nnon-cognitivist ideas in their theories of legal language. \nAs is widely recognized, the Scandinavian Realists were ethical\nnon-cognitivists. (Bjarup 1999, p. 775; Ross 1959, p. 313; Spaak 2009,\npp. 42–44, 52–55, 64.) In principle, this would not\nrequire adopting expressivist or non-cognitivist accounts of legal\nstatements, but as it happens Ross and Olivecrona did understand\nsubstantial parts of legal discourse on this model. To be sure, Ross\nanalyzed statements about “valid law” as assertions of\nnaturalistic fact, and thus cognitive. But, as discussed earlier, Ross\nthought some legal utterances were non-cognitive directives. This most\nobviously included legal rules themselves, as in the provisions of a\nstatute. But Ross also thought jurists’ doctrinal writings were\ntypically a blend of cognitive assertions of valid law and\nnon-cognitive directives, the latter being in effect advice calculated\nto influence the behavior of the judiciary (1959, pp. 46–49). In\nadvancing this idea, Ross was not merely making the banal point that\ndoctrinal writing is frequently laced with transparently normative\nclaims about how courts should decide cases. His point was subtler\nthan this; telegraphically stated, Ross’ observation was that\ndoctrinal writers sometimes do (and sometimes intend to) influence\njudges by making statements that could, on their face, equally be\ninterpreted as straightforward predictive/descriptive claims. It\nturns out, therefore, that Ross had a rather nuanced understanding of\nthe mix of cognitive (or representational/descriptive) and\nnon-cognitive (or directive/prescriptive) elements in legal\ndiscourse. \nIf anything, non-cognitivist ideas play an even more striking role in\nOlivecrona’s mature legal philosophy, notably as set out in the\nSecond Edition of Law as Fact. Unsatisfied with efforts to\nreduce talk of legal rights to claims about naturalistic states of\naffairs, Olivecrona ultimately concludes that the word\n“right,” as commonly used, does not signify anything and\nlacks semantic reference (1971, pp. 183–184). In the first\ninstance, he argues, statements about legal rights serve a directive\nfunction, though they can also indirectly serve to communicate\ninformation about actual (naturalistic) facts. Ultimately, Olivecrona\nextends this analysis to legal language in general, concluding:\n“Legal language is not a descriptive language. It is a\ndirective, influential language serving as an instrument of social\ncontrol” (1971, p. 253). Lest there be doubts about how far\nOlivecrona took this idea, he went on to observe that on his account,\n“Citizen, government, parliament, law, right, duty, marriage,\nelections, taxes, corporations, and princess all belong to\nth[e] category” of “words which…lack\nsemantic reference” (1971, p. 255). Thus, Olivecrona found no\nplace for many of the “things” legal language is\nostensibly “about” in the world of facts that he\ncountenanced as an S-naturalist. As so often happens with philosophers\nwho embrace non-cognitivism about some domain of thought and talk,\nhowever, Olivecrona was equally insistent that legal language and\nideas do find a place in reality. He accordingly devoted\nconsiderable attention to describing the function of legal language in\nsociety—concluding, ultimately, that “legal language plays\na vital role” as “an instrument of social control,”\n“for keeping the peace, as well as for sending men to death on\nthe battlefield” (1971, p. 254). Insofar as there is some\ncontemporary interest in expressivist and/or non-cognitivist\naccounts of legal thought and talk, therefore, Scandinavian Realism\nmay offer interesting intellectual-historical reference points (and\npossibly substantive inspiration) for the further development of such\nideas. \nAt least in contemporary Anglo-American legal philosophy, “Legal\nPositivism” is generally used as a shorthand for a claim roughly\nalong the following lines: “the existence and content of law\ndepends on social facts and not on its merits” (Green 2009).\nWhat is the relationship between naturalism and Legal Positivism in\nthe above-specified sense? The situation is somewhat complex because\nsome but not all Legal Positivists are naturalists, and few have gone\nso far as the Scandinavian Realists in wearing their naturalism on\ntheir sleeves. In brief, however, naturalism can and sometimes\nhas—but need not—play a role in motivating Legal\nPositivism. \nHow is it that naturalism can play a role in motivating Legal\nPositivism? As has often been remarked, the core Positivist claim\nabout the relationship between law and social facts amounts in effect\nto a claim that law is reducible to social facts, which—given\nthat “social facts” here is, tacitly if not expressly,\nlimited to psychological and sociological facts—further amounts\nto the claim that law is reducible to naturalistic facts. It should be\nclear enough why this would be appealing to people with S-naturalist\ncommitments, for it would, so to speak, mean that we can\n“place” law in the realm of naturalistic facts and\nentities. (By analogy, consider why S-naturalists would be drawn to\nthe idea that the existence and contents of human minds\ndepends solely on facts about human brains.) Unsurprisingly,\ntherefore, the affinities between Legal Positivism and S-naturalism\nhave not gone unnoticed. (See Kar 2006, p. 931; Leiter 2017.) \nIt is, however, somewhat harder to discern the actual extent to which\nS-naturalism has been a motivation for major philosophers in the Legal\nPositivist tradition. There is at least a good case to be made that\nHart was sufficiently attracted to S-naturalism to consider it an\nadvantage of Legal Positivism that it placed law in the world of\nearthly facts. (See Hart 1961, pp. 11–12, 83–84, 186; Raz\n1998, pp. 4–5; Toh 2005, pp. 83–85.) Even so, Legal\nPositivism need not be, and is not always, motivated by S-naturalism,\nor for that matter any kind of naturalism, and not all Legal\nPositivists are naturalists in any interesting sense. For example, Raz\ndoes not appear to be a naturalist of any sort. (See Raz 1988, p. 6.)\nThe broader point, of course, is that one need not be a naturalist to\nthink that some particular phenomenon (e.g., law) depends\nsolely on naturalistic facts. \nThus, it pays not to overstate, or to make overgeneralizations about,\nthe relationship between naturalism and Legal Positivism. We can,\nhowever, confidently say that Legal Positivism sits well with a\nbackground commitment to S-naturalism. This point is of no small\nimportance given the continuing influence of S-naturalism (or at least\ntemperamental affinities to S-naturalism) in the general background\nframework of post-Enlightenment culture and thought. (See Leiter\n2017.) \nJust as semantic doctrines more-or-less related to logical positivism\nwere central to the S-naturalism of Scandinavian Realism, the more\nrecent S-naturalism of writers like Brink, Moore, and Stavropoulos is\nindebted to the revolution in semantics initiated by Hilary Putnam and\nSaul Kripke known as the “new” or “causal”\ntheory of reference. These latter doctrines are not—yet in any\ncase—museum pieces, so the derived jurisprudential theses are\nvery much live items of debate. Stavropoulos explains the core\nsemantic ideas on which jurisprudential writers draw as follows: \nThus, if on the old view the “meaning” of an expression\n(the descriptions speakers associated with it) fixed the reference of\nthe expression, on the new theory, the referent fixes the meaning.\n“Water” picks out whatever stuff we happened to baptize\nwith the name “water” at the beginning of the\n“term-using practice.” As it happens, that stuff has a\ndistinctive micro-constitution: it is H20. Thus,\n“water” refers to stuff that is H20, and that\nis what the term means: the stuff that is H20. \nWriters like Brink, Moore, and Stavropoulos propose that when the\nmeaning of expressions in legal rules—and, in particular, the\nmeaning of the moral concepts (like “equality”) that\nfigure in some legal rules—is understood in the same way, then\nit follows that all rules have determinate applications:\neither the facts do or do not fall within the extension of the meaning\nof the key terms in the rule. The meaning of the rule determines its\napplication, but the meaning is fixed by the real referents\nof the terms in the legal rule. Of course, for this to be a version of\nS-naturalism, the claim must be that the real referents are themselves\nthings cognizable within a naturalistic framework: so, e.g., it would\nhave to be the case that the legal and moral features of situations\npicked out by our legal concepts (and the moral concepts embedded in\nthem) must be identical with (or supervenient upon) natural facts:\njust as there are necessary, a posteriori statements of\nproperty identity about water, so too there are such statements about\nlegal and moral facts. For example, perhaps the property of being\n“morally right” is just identical with the property of\n“maximizing human well-being,” where the latter may be\nunderstood in purely psychological and physiological terms. In that\ncase, whether an action X is morally right is simply a\nscientific question about whether action X will in fact\nmaximize the relevant kinds of psychological and physiological states\nin the world. (Most naturalistic moral realisms are based on versions\nof utilitarianism, precisely because it is easy to see what the\nnaturalistic base of moral properties would be in a utilitarian\nschema. One peculiar feature of the moral realism of Moore (1992b) is\nthat it is conjoined with a deontological moral theory, yet within a\npurportedly naturalistic moral realist framework.) The crucial claim,\nplainly, is that moral facts are to be identified with (or treated as\nsupervenient upon) certain kinds of natural facts. Of course, many\nphilosophers are skeptical that this claim can be made out. \nProblems arise at several different levels with this more recent\nS-naturalism, though all are traceable to the reliance on the new\ntheory of reference. To begin, there are familiar reasons to be\nskeptical about whether the new theory of reference is correct,\nreasons that won’t be rehearsed here (see, e.g., Evans 1973,\nBlackburn 1988). Even granting, however, the correctness of the new\ntheory, it is not obvious how it helps in the case of law. After all,\nthe new theory always seemed most plausible for a limited class of\nexpressions: proper names and natural kind terms. The reason has to do\nwith the implicit essentialism required for the new theory: unless\nreferents have essential characteristics—just as\n“water” has a distinctive and essential molecular\nconstitution—they can not fix meanings. But what is the essence\nof “due process” or “equal protection?” And\nwhat is the “essential” nature of the many artifact terms\nthat populate legal rules (terms like “contract” or\n“vehicle” or “security interest”)?\nUnsurprisingly, S-naturalists like Brink and Moore are also moral\nrealists, and also try to give accounts of artifact terms as picking\nout not “natural kinds” but “functional kinds”\n(Moore 1992a, pp. 207–208). \nOf course, even if the new theory of reference gives the correct\naccount of the meaning of some terms (like natural kind terms), that\nstill does not show that it gives us the right account of meaning for\npurposes of legal interpretation (cf. Munzer 1985). Suppose the\nlegislature prohibits the killing of “fish” within 100\nmiles of the coast, intending quite clearly (as the legislative\nhistory reveals) to protect whales, but not realizing that\n“fish” is a natural kind term that does not include whales\nwithin its extension. The new theory of reference tells us that the\nstatute protects sea bass but not whales, yet surely a court that\ninterpreted the statute as also protecting whales would not be making\na mistake. Indeed, one might think the reverse is true: for a court\nnot to protect whales would be to contravene the will of the\nlegislature, and thus, indirectly, the will of the people. What the\nexample suggests is that the correct theory of legal interpretation is\nnot a mere matter of philosophical semantics: issues about\npolitical legitimacy—about the conditions under which\nthe exercise of coercive power by courts can be justified—must\ninform theories of legal interpretation, and such considerations may\neven trump considerations of semantics.","contact.mail":"metchemendy@uchicago.edu","contact.domain":"uchicago.edu"}]
