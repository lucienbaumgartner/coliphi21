Psychological\negoism, the most famous descriptive position, claims that each person\nhas but one ultimate aim: her own welfare. Normative forms of egoism\nmake claims about what one ought to do, rather than describe what one\ndoes do. Ethical egoism claims I morally ought to perform some action\nif and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes my\nself-interest.  Rational egoism claims that I ought to perform some\naction if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes\nmy self-interest. (Here the “ought” is not restricted to\nthe moral “ought”.)\n\n\n\n\nAll forms of egoism require explication of “self-interest”\n(or “welfare” or “well-being”). There are three\nmain theories. Preference or desire accounts identify self-interest\nwith the satisfaction of one’s desires. Often, and most plausibly,\nthese desires are restricted to self-regarding desires. What makes a\ndesire self-regarding is controversial, but there are clear cases and\ncounter-cases: a desire for my own pleasure is self-regarding; a desire\nfor the welfare of others is not. Objective accounts identify\nself-interest with the possession of states (such as virtue or\nknowledge) that are valuable independently of whether they are desired.  Hybrid accounts give a role to both desires (or pleasure) and states that are valuable independently of whether they are desired.  For example, perhaps the increase to my well-being brought about by a satisfied desire (or a pleasure) itself increases insofar as it is a desire for (or pleasure in) knowledge.  Or perhaps the increase to my well-being brought about by a piece of knowledge itself increases insofar as I desire (or take pleasure in) it. \nHedonism, which identifies self-interest with pleasure, is either a\npreference or an objective account, according to whether what counts as\npleasure is determined by one’s desires.  \n\nPsychological egoism claims that each person has but one ultimate\naim: her own welfare. This allows for action that fails to maximize\nperceived self-interest, but rules out the sort of behavior\npsychological egoists like to target — such as altruistic behavior or\nmotivation by thoughts of duty alone. It allows for weakness of will,\nsince in weakness of will cases I am still aiming at my own welfare; I\nam weak in that I do not act as I aim. And it allows for aiming at\nthings other than one’s welfare, such as helping others, where these\nthings are a means to one’s welfare. \n\nPsychological egoism is supported by our frequent observation of\nself-interested behavior. Apparently altruistic action is often\nrevealed to be self-interested. And we typically motivate people by\nappealing to their self-interest (through, for example, punishments and\nrewards). \n\nA common objection to psychological egoism, made famously by Joseph\nButler, is that I must desire things other than my own welfare in order\nto get welfare. Say I derive welfare from playing hockey. Unless I\ndesired, for its own sake, to play hockey, I would not derive welfare\nfrom playing. Or say I derive welfare from helping others. Unless I\ndesired, for its own sake, that others do well, I would not derive\nwelfare from helping them. Welfare results from my action, but cannot\nbe the only aim of my action. \n\nThe psychological egoist can concede that I must have desires for\nparticular things, such as playing hockey. But there is no need to\nconcede that the satisfaction of these desires is not part of my\nwelfare. My welfare might consist simply in the satisfaction of\nself-regarding desires. In the case of deriving welfare from helping\nothers, the psychological egoist can again concede that I would not\nderive welfare without desiring some particular thing, but need not\nagree that what I desire for its own sake is that others do well. That\nI am the one who helps them may, for example, satisfy my self-regarding\ndesire for power. \n\nA bigger problem for psychological egoism is that some behavior does\nnot seem to be explained by self-regarding desires. Say a soldier\nthrows himself on a grenade to prevent others from being killed. It\ndoes not seem that the soldier is pursuing his perceived self-interest.\nIt is plausible that, if asked, the soldier would have said that he\nthrew himself on the grenade because he wanted to save the lives of\nothers or because it was his duty. He would deny as ridiculous the\nclaim that he acted in his self-interest. \n\nThe psychological egoist might reply that the soldier is lying or\nself-deceived. Perhaps he threw himself on the grenade because he believed that he could\nnot bear to live with himself afterwards if he did not do so. He has a\nbetter life, in terms of welfare, by avoiding years of guilt. The main\nproblem here is that while this is a possible account of some cases,\nthere is no reason to think it covers all cases. Another problem is\nthat guilt may presuppose that the soldier has a non-self-regarding\ndesire for doing what he takes to be right. \n\nThe psychological egoist might reply that some such account must be\nright. After all, the soldier did what he most wanted to do, and so\nmust have been pursuing his perceived self-interest. In one sense, this\nis true. If self-interest is identified with the satisfaction of all of\none’s preferences, then all intentional action is self-interested (at\nleast if intentional actions are always explained by citing\npreferences, as most believe). Psychological egoism turns out to be\ntrivially true. This would not content defenders of psychological\negoism, however. They intend an empirical theory that, like other such\ntheories, it is at least possible to refute by observation. \n\nThere is another way to show that the trivial version of\npsychological egoism is unsatisfactory. We ordinarily think there is a\nsignificant difference in selfishness between the soldier’s action and\nthat of another soldier who, say, pushes someone onto the grenade to\navoid being blown up himself. We think the former is acting unselfishly\nwhile the latter is acting selfishly. According to the trivial version\nof psychological egoism, both soldiers are equally selfish, since both\nare doing what they most desire. \n\nThe psychological egoist might handle apparent cases of\nself-sacrifice, not by adopting the trivial version, but rather by\nclaiming that facts about the self-interest of the agent explain all\nbehavior. Perhaps as infants we have only self-regarding desires; we\ncome to desire other things, such as doing our duty, by learning that\nthese other things satisfy our self-regarding desires; in time, we\npursue the other things for their own sakes. \n\nEven if this picture of development is true, however, it does not\ndefend psychological egoism, since it admits that we sometimes\nultimately aim at things other than our welfare. An account of the\norigins of our non-self-regarding desires does not show that they are\nreally self-regarding. The soldier’s desire is to save others, not\nincrease his own welfare, even if he would not have desired to save\nothers unless saving others was, in the past, connected to increasing\nhis welfare. \n\nThe psychological egoist must argue that we do not come to pursue\nthings other than our welfare for their own sakes. In principle, it\nseems possible to show this by showing that non-self-regarding desires\ndo not continue for long once their connection to our welfare is\nbroken. However, evidence for this dependence claim has not been\nforthcoming. \n\nIndeed, when examining the empirical evidence, two sorts of approach\nhave been used to argue against psychological egoism. \n\nFirst, Daniel Batson and colleagues found that increased empathy leads\nto increased helping behaviour.  One hypothesis is altrustic: empathy\ncauses a non-instrumental desire to help.  There are many competing\negoistic hypotheses.  Empathy might cause an unpleasant experience\nthat subjects believe they can stop by helping; or subjects might\nthink failing to help in cases of high empathy is more likely to lead\nto punishment by others, or that helping here is more likely to be\nrewarded by others; or subjects might think this about\nself-administered punishment or reward.  In an ingenious series of\nexperiments, Batson compared the egoistic hypotheses, one by one,\nagainst the altruistic hypothesis.  He found that the altruistic\nhypothesis always made superior predictions.  Against the unpleasant\nexperience hypothesis, Batson found that giving high-empathy subjects\neasy ways of stopping the experience other than by helping did not\nreduce helping.  Against the punishment by others hypothesis, Batson\nfound that letting high-empathy subjects believe that their behaviour\nwould be secret did not reduce helping.  Against the self-administered\nreward hypothesis, Batson found that the mood of high-empathy subjects\ndepended on whether they believed that help was needed, whether or not\nthey could do the helping, rather than on whether they helped (and so\ncould self-reward).  Against the self-administered punishment\nhypothesis, Batson found that making high-empathy subjects believe\nthey would feel less guilt from not helping (by letting them believe\nthat few others had volunteered to help) did not reduce helping. \n\nOne might quibble with some of the details.  Perhaps subjects did not\nbelieve that the easy ways of stopping the painful experience Batson\nprovided, such as leaving the viewing room, would stop it.  (For an\naccount of an experiment done in reply, favouring Batson, see Stich,\nDoris and Roedder 2010, as well as Batson 2011 135–145.)\nPerhaps a Batson-proof egoistic hypothesis could be offered: say that\nsubjects believe that the only way of stopping the pain (or\navoiding self-punishment) is by helping (though whether subjects have\nthis belief might be tested for on its own).  But on the whole,\nBatson’s experiments are very bad news for psychological egoism.  (For\nfurther discussion of Batson, see May 2011a and Slote 2013.) \n\nSecond, Elliot Sober and David Wilson argue that evolutionary theory\nsupports altruism.  Parental care might be explained on egoistic\ngrounds: a belief about the child’s distress causes the parent pain\nthat the parent believes she can alleviate by helping, or the parent\nbelieves that she will be caused pain if she does not help.  Parental\ncare might also be explained on altruistic grounds: the parent has a\nnon-instrumental desire that the child do well.  Lastly, parental care\nmight be explained by a combination of these mechanisms.  Sober and\nWilson argue that more reliable care would be provided by the\naltruistic or combination mechanisms.  Given the importance of\nparental care, this is a reason for thinking that natural selection\nwould have favoured one of these mechanisms.  The egoistic mechanism\nis less reliable for several reasons: beliefs about the child’s\ndistress may fail to cause the parent pain (even bodily injury does\nnot always cause pain, so pain is unlikely to be always caused by\nbeliefs about distress); the parent may fail to believe that helping\nwill best reduce her pain; there may not be enough pain produced; the\ncombination view has the advantage of an extra mechanism. \n\nThis argument has drawbacks.  Natural selection does not always\nprovide back-up mechanisms (I have but one liver).  Natural selection\nsometimes has my desires caused by affect that is produced by a belief\nrather than directly by the belief (my desire to run away from danger\nis often caused by my fear, rather than by the mere belief that there\nis danger).  And in these cases, as in the case of the imperfectly\ncorrelated pain and bodily injury, there seems usually to\nbe enough affect.  The altruistic hypothesis also has some of\nthe same problems: for example, just as there might not be enough\npain, the non-instrumental desire that the child do well might not be\nstrong enough to defeat other desires.  Indeed, without an estimate of\nhow strong this desire is, there is no reason to think the egoistic\nhypothesis is less reliable.  It may have more points at which it can\ngo wrong, but produce more care than a direct but weak altruistic\nmechanism.  (For many of these worries, and others, see Stich, Doris\nand Roedder 2010.)       \n\nEven if evolutionary arguments can be met, however, psychological\negoism faces the problems noted earlier.  In response, the\npsychological egoist might move to what Gregory Kavka (1986, 64–80)\ncalls “predominant egoism:” we act unselfishly only\nrarely, and then typically where the sacrifice is small and the gain\nto others is large or where those benefiting are friends, family, or\nfavorite causes. Predominant egoism is not troubled by the soldier\ncounter-example, since it allows exceptions; it is not trivial; and it\nseems empirically plausible.  (For other weakened positions, see\nLaFollette 1988 and Mercer 2001.) \n\nEthical egoism claims that I morally ought to perform some action if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes my self-interest.  (There\nare possibilities other than maximization. One might, for example,\nclaim that one ought to achieve a certain level of welfare, but that\nthere is no requirement to achieve more. Ethical egoism might also\napply to things other than acts, such as rules or character traits.\nSince these variants are uncommon, and the arguments for and against\nthem are largely the same as those concerning the standard version, I set them aside.) \n\nOne issue concerns how much ethical egoism differs in content from\nstandard moral theories. It might appear that it differs a great deal.\nAfter all, moral theories such as Kantianism, utilitarianism, and\ncommon-sense morality require that an agent give weight to the\ninterests of others. They sometimes require uncompensated sacrifices,\nparticularly when the loss to the agent is small and the gain to others\nis large. (Say the cost to me of saving a drowning person is getting my\nshirtsleeve wet.) Ethical egoists can reply, however, that egoism\ngenerates many of the same duties to others. The argument runs as\nfollows. Each person needs the cooperation of others to obtain goods\nsuch as defense or friendship. If I act as if I give no weight to\nothers, others will not cooperate with me. If, say, I break my promises\nwhenever it is in my direct self-interest to do so, others will not\naccept my promises, and may even attack me. I do best, then, by acting\nas if others have weight (provided they act as if I have weight in\nreturn). \n\nIt is unlikely that this argument proves that ethical egoism\ngenerates all of the standard duties to others. For the argument\ndepends on the ability of others to cooperate with me or attack me\nshould I fail to cooperate. In dealings with others who lack these\nabilities, the egoist has no reason to cooperate. The duties to others\nfound in standard moral theories are not conditional in this way. I do\nnot, for example, escape a duty to save a drowning person, when I can\neasily do so, just because the drowning person (or anyone watching)\nhappens never to be able to offer fruitful cooperation or\nretaliation. \n\nThe divergence between ethical egoism and standard moral theories\nappears in other ways. \n\nFirst, the ethical egoist will rank as most important duties that\nbring her the highest payoff. Standard moral theories determine\nimportance at least in part by considering the payoff to those helped.\nWhat brings the highest payoff to me is not necessarily what brings the\nhighest payoff to those helped. I might, for example, profit more from\nhelping the local Opera society refurbish its hall than I would from\ngiving to famine relief in Africa, but standard moral theories would\nrank famine relief as more important than Opera hall improvements. \n\nSecond, the cooperation argument cannot be extended to justify\nextremely large sacrifices, such as the soldier falling on the grenade,\nthat standard moral theories rank either as most important or\nsupererogatory. The cooperation argument depends on a short-term loss\n(such as keeping a promise that it is inconvenient to keep) being\nrecompensed by a long-term gain (such as being trusted in future\npromises). Where the immediate loss is one’s life (or irreplaceable\nfeatures such as one’s sight), there is no long-term gain, and so no\negoist argument for the sacrifice. \n\nAn ethical egoist might reply by taking the cooperation argument\nfurther. Perhaps I cannot get the benefits of cooperation without\nconverting to some non-egoist moral theory. That is, it is not enough\nthat I act as if others have weight; I must really give them weight. I\ncould still count as an egoist, in the sense that I have adopted the\nnon-egoist theory on egoist grounds. \n\nOne problem is that it seems unlikely that I can get the benefits of\ncooperation only by conversion. Provided I act as if others have weight\nfor long enough, others will take me as giving them weight, and so\ncooperate, whether I really give them weight or not. In many\nsituations, others will neither have the ability to see my true\nmotivation nor care about it. \n\nAnother problem is that conversion can be costly. I might be\nrequired by my non-egoist morality to make a sacrifice for which I\ncannot be compensated (or pass up a gain so large that passing it up\nwill not be compensated for). Since I have converted from egoism, I can\nno longer reject making the sacrifice or passing up the gain on the\nground that it will not pay. It is safer, and seemingly feasible, to\nremain an egoist while cooperating in most cases. If so, ethical egoism\nand standard moralities will diverge in some cases. (For discussion of\nthe cooperation argument, see Frank 1988; Gauthier 1986 ch. 6; Kavka\n1984 and 1986 Part II; Sidgwick 1907 II.V.) \n\nThere is another way to try to show that ethical egoism and standard\nmoral theories do not differ much. One might hold one particular\nobjective theory of self-interest, according to which my welfare lies\nin possessing the virtues required by standard moral theories. This\nrequires an argument to show that this particular objective theory\ngives the right account of self-interest. It also faces a worry for any\nobjective theory: objective theories seem implausible as accounts of\nwelfare. If, say, all my preferences favor my ignoring the plight of\nothers, and these preferences do not rest on false beliefs about issues\nsuch as the likelihood of receiving help, it seems implausible (and\nobjectionably paternalistic) to claim that “really” my\nwelfare lies in helping others. I may have a duty to help others, and\nthe world might be better if I helped others, but it does not follow\nthat I am better off by helping others. (For a more optimistic verdict\non this strategy, noting its roots in Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the\nStoics, and the British Idealists, see Brink 1997 and 2003.) \n\nOf course the divergence between ethical egoism and standard moral\ntheories need not bother an ethical egoist. An ethical egoist sees\negoism as superior to other moral theories. Whether it is superior\ndepends on the strength of the arguments for it. Two arguments are\npopular. \n\nFirst, one might argue for a moral theory, as one argues for a\nscientific theory, by showing that it best fits the evidence. In the\ncase of moral theories, the evidence is usually taken to be our most\nconfident common-sense moral judgments. Egoism fits many of these, such\nas the requirements of cooperation in ordinary cases. It fits some\njudgments better than utilitarianism does. For example, it allows one\nto keep some good, such as a job, for oneself, even if giving the good\nto someone else would help him slightly more, and it captures the\nintuition that I need not let others exploit me. The problem is that,\nas the discussion of the cooperation argument shows, it also fails to\nfit some of the confident moral judgments we make. \n\nSecond, one might argue for a moral theory by showing that it is\ndictated by non-moral considerations -- in particular, by facts about\nmotivation. It is commonly held that moral judgments must be practical,\nor capable of motivating those who make them. If psychological egoism\nwere true, this would restrict moral judgments to those made by egoism.\nOther moral judgments would be excluded since it would be impossible to\nmotivate anyone to follow them. \n\nOne problem with this argument is that psychological egoism seems\nfalse. Replacing psychological with predominant egoism loses the key\nclaim that it is impossible to motivate anyone to make an uncompensated\nsacrifice. \n\nThe ethical egoist might reply that, if predominant egoism is true,\nethical egoism may require less deviation from our ordinary actions\nthan any standard moral theory. But fit with motivation is hardly\ndecisive; any normative theory, including ethical egoism, is intended\nto guide and criticize our choices, rather than simply endorse whatever\nwe do. When I make an imprudent choice, this does not count against\nethical egoism, and in favor of a theory recommending imprudence. \n\nThe argument has other problems. One could deny that morality must\nbe practical in the required sense. Perhaps morality need not be\npractical at all: we do not always withdraw moral judgments when we\nlearn that the agent could not be motivated to follow them. Or perhaps\nmoral judgments must be capable of motivating not just anyone, but only\nidealized versions of ourselves, free from (say) irrationality. In this\ncase, it is insufficient to describe how we are motivated; what is\nrelevant is a description of how we would be motivated were we\nrational. \n\nFinally, if I do not believe that some action is ultimately in my\nself-interest, it follows from psychological egoism that I cannot aim\nto do it. But say I am wrong: the action is in my self-interest.\nEthical egoism then says that it is right for me to do something I\ncannot aim to do. It violates practicality just as any other moral\ntheory does. \n\nSo far a number of arguments for ethical egoism have been\nconsidered. There are a number of standard arguments against it. \n\nG. E. Moore argued that ethical egoism is self-contradictory.  If I am\nan egoist, I hold that I ought to maximize my good.  I deny that\nothers ought to maximize my good (they should maximize their own\ngoods).  But to say that x is “my good” is just\nto say that my possessing x is good.  (I cannot possess the\ngoodness.)  If my possession of x is good, then I must hold\nthat others ought to maximize my possession of it.  I both deny and am\ncommitted to affirming that others ought to maximize my good.\n(Sometimes Moore suggests instead that “my good” be\nglossed as “x is good and x is mine.”\nThis does not yield the contradiction above, since it does not claim\nthat my possession of x is good.  But it yields a different\ncontradiction: if x is good, everyone ought to maximize it\nwherever it appears; egoists hold that I ought to maximize x\nonly when it appears in me.) \n\nIn reply, C. D. Broad rightly noted that this does not show that\negoism is self-contradictory, since it is not part of egoism to\nhold that what is good ought to be pursued by everyone (Broad 1942).\nBut that reply does not defend egoism from the charge of falsity.  To\ndo so, one might understand “my good” not as composed from\nwhat Moore calls “good absolutely,” but as being a sui\ngeneris concept, good-for-me (Mackie 1976, Smith 2003), or as\nanalyzed in terms of what I, from my point of view, ought to desire.\nIn neither of these cases does it follow from “my possession of\nx is good-for-me” that others ought to maximize what is\ngood-for-me.  One might even argue that claims about “good\nabsolutely” do not justify claims about what one ought to do,\nwithout in addition there being a special relation between the agent\nand the proposed change.  If so, it does not follow simply from my\npossession of x being good that others ought to do anything\n(Prichard 2002 217). \n\nMoore also suggests that the reason for me to pursue my good is the\ngoodness of the thing I obtain.  If what I obtain is good, then there\nis reason for everyone to pursue it, not just in me, but anywhere.\nAgain, moving to good-for-me avoids this consequence.  But something\nclose to this argument is plausible, especially for some bad things.  One\nmight argue that it is the way my pain feels — its badness — and not\nany connection between me and the pain that gives me reason to\nalleviate it.  If so, I have reason to alleviate the pain of others\n(Nagel 1986, Rachels 2002).  (This argument can be directed against\nrational egoism as well.) \n\nA second argument against ethical egoism was made by\nH. A. Prichard. He argues that self-interest is the wrong sort of\nreason.  I do not, for example, think the reason I have a duty to help\na drowning child is that helping benefits me (Prichard 2002 1, 9, 26,\n29, 30, 122, 123, 171, 188).  Similarly, Prichard chastises Sidgwick\nfor taking seriously the view that there is “a duty...to\ndo those acts which we think will lead to our happiness”\n(Prichard 2002 135). \n\nThis is convincing when “duty” means “moral\nduty.” It is less convincing when, as Prichard also thinks, the\nissue is simply what one ought to do.  He takes there to be only one\nsense of “ought,” which he treats as “morally\nought.” Any other “ought” is treated as really\nmaking the non-normative claim that a certain means is efficient for\nattaining a certain end.  But ethical egoism can be seen as making\ncategorical ought-claims.  And the historical popularity of ethical\negoism, which Prichard so often notes, indicates that self-interest is\nnot obviously irrelevant to what one ought to do (in a not\nspecifically moral sense). \n\nOne might also object to Prichard-style arguments that (a) they are\nquestion-begging, since egoists will hardly agree that my reason for\nhelping is something other than the benefit to me, and (b) given\ndisagreement over this claim about my reason, the appropriate response\nis to suspend judgment about it.  Alison Hills, in 2010 parts II and III (directed at\nrational egoism), replies to (a) that moralists can assure themselves\nby giving arguments that start from premises like “I have a\nreason to help regardless of whether doing so contributes to my\nself-interest,” provided this premiss is not inferred from the\nfalsity of rational egoism — perhaps it is self-evident.  In\nreply to (b), she argues that disagreement over the premiss does not\nrequire moralists to suspend judgment about it, although disagreement\nover an egoistic premiss like “I have reason to help only\nbecause doing so benefits me” does require egoists to suspend judgment.  The\ndifference is that rational egoists aim at knowledge, and for putative\nknowledge, in cases of disagreement between epistemic peers,\nsuspension of belief is required.  Moralists aim primarily not at\nknowledge but at the ability to draw, on their own, true moral\nconclusions from the evidence.  Since aiming at this ability\nrequires not giving weight to the conclusions of others,\nsuspension of belief in cases of disagreement is not required of\nthem. \n\nObviously, much here depends on the claim about the aim of moralists.\nOne might object that moralists care much more about getting true\nmoral conclusions than about arriving at them on their own. If I could\nguarantee that I do the right act by relying on a Moral Answers\nMachine (and not otherwise), I ought to do so.  In addition, since\nmoralists do want true moral conclusions, and peer disagreement is\nrelevant to pursuing truth, Hills’ moralists both need and cannot (by\none means) pursue truth. \n\nA third argument, like Moore’s, claims that ethical egoism is\ninconsistent in various ways. Say ethical egoism recommends\nthat A and B both go to a certain hockey game, since\ngoing to the game is in the self-interest of each.  Unfortunately,\nonly one seat remains. Ethical egoism, then, recommends an impossible\nstate of affairs. Or say that I am A and an ethical egoist. I\nboth claim that B ought to go to the game, since that is in\nher self-interest, and I do not want B to go to the game,\nsince B’s going to the game is against my self-interest. \n\nAgainst the first inconsistency charge, the ethical egoist can reply\nthat ethical egoism provides no neutral ranking of states of affairs.\nIt recommends to A that A go to the game, and\nto B that B go to the game, but is silent on the\nvalue of A and B both attending the game. \n\nAgainst the second inconsistency charge, the ethical egoist can claim\nthat she morally recommends that B go to the game, although\nshe desires that B not go. This is no more odd than claiming\nthat my opponent in a game would be wise to adopt a particular\nstrategy, while desiring that he not do so. True, the ethical egoist\nis unlikely to recommend ethical egoism to others, to blame others for\nviolations of what ethical egoism requires, to justify herself to\nothers on the basis of ethical egoism, or to express moral attitudes\nsuch as forgiveness and resentment. These publicity worries may\ndisqualify ethical egoism as a moral theory, but do not show\ninconsistency. \n\nA fourth argument against ethical egoism is just that: ethical egoism\ndoes not count as a moral theory. One might set various constraints on\na theory’s being a moral theory. Many of these constraints are met by\nethical egoism — the formal constraints, for example, that moral\nclaims must be prescriptive and universalizable.  Ethical egoism\nissues prescriptions — “do what maximizes your\nself-interest” — and it issues the same prescriptions for\npeople in relevantly similar situations. But other constraints are\nproblematic for ethical egoism: perhaps a moral theory must sometimes\nrequire uncompensated sacrifices; or perhaps it must supply a single,\nneutral ranking of actions that each agent must follow in cases where\ninterests conflict; or perhaps it must respect principles such as\n“that I ought to do x is a consideration in favor of\nothers not preventing me from doing x;” or perhaps it\nmust be able to be made public in the way, just noted, that ethical\negoism cannot. (For sample discussions of these two objections, see\nBaier 1958 189–191; Campbell 1972; Frankena 1973 18–20; Kalin\n1970.) \n\nThe issue of what makes for a moral theory is contentious. An ethical\negoist could challenge whatever constraint is deployed against\nher. But a neater reply is to move to rational egoism, which makes\nclaims about what one has reason to do, ignoring the topic of what is\nmorally right. This gets at what ethical egoists intend, while\nskirting the issue of constraints on moral theories. After all, few if\nany ethical egoists think of egoism as giving the correct content of\nmorality, while also thinking that what they have most reason to do is\ndetermined by some non-egoist consideration. One could then, if one\nwished, argue for ethical egoism from rational egoism and the\nplausible claim that the best moral theory must tell me what I have\nmost reason to do. \n\nRational egoism claims that I ought to perform some action if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes my self-interest.  (As with\nethical egoism, there are variants which drop maximization or evaluate\nrules or character traits rather than actions. There are also variants\nwhich make the maximization of self-interest necessary but not\nsufficient, or sufficient but not necessary, for an action to be the action I ought to perform.  Again, I set\nthese issues aside.) Rational egoism makes claims about what I ought, or have reason, to do, without restricting the “ought” or “reason” to a moral “ought” or “reason.”  \n\nLike ethical egoism, rational egoism needs arguments to support it.\nOne might cite our most confident judgments about rational action and\nclaim that rational egoism best fits these. The problem is that our\nmost confident judgments about rational action seem to be captured by a\ndifferent, extremely popular theory — the instrumental theory of\nrationality. According to the instrumental theory, I ought to perform some action if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes the\nsatisfaction of my preferences. Since psychological egoism seems\nfalse, it may be rational for me to make an uncompensated sacrifice for\nthe sake of others, for this may be what, on balance, best satisfies my\n(strong, non-self-interested) preferences. This conflict with the\ninstrumental theory is a major problem for rational egoism. \n\nThe rational egoist might reply that the instrumental theory is\nequally a problem for any standard moral theory that claims to give an\naccount of what one ought rationally, or all things considered, to do.\nIf, for example, a utilitarian claims that I have most reason to give\nto charity, since that maximizes the general happiness, I could object\nthat giving to charity cannot be rational given my particular\npreferences, which are for things other than the general happiness. \n\nA different problem for rational egoism is that it appears\narbitrary. Suppose I claim that I ought to maximize the welfare of\nblue-eyed people, but not of other people. Unless I can explain why\nblue-eyed people are to be preferred, my claim looks arbitrary, in the\nsense that I have given no reason for the different treatments. As a\nrational egoist, I claim that I ought to maximize the welfare of one\nperson (myself). Unless I can explain why I should be preferred, my\nclaim looks equally arbitrary. \n\nOne reply is to argue that non-arbitrary distinctions can be made by\none’s preferences. Say I like anchovies and hate broccoli. This makes\nmy decision to buy anchovies rather than broccoli non-arbitrary.\nSimilarly, my preference for my own welfare makes my concentration on\nmy own welfare non-arbitrary. \n\nThere are two problems for this reply. \n\nFirst, we do not always take preferences to establish non-arbitrary\ndistinctions. If I defend favoring blue-eyed people simply by noting\nthat I like blue-eyed people, without any justification for my liking,\nthis seems unsatisfactory. The rational egoist must argue that hers is\na case where preferences are decisive. \n\nSecond, if psychological egoism is false, I might lack a preference\nfor my own welfare. It would follow that for me, a distinction between\nmy welfare and that of others would be arbitrary, and the rational\negoist claim that each ought to maximize his own welfare would be\nunjustified when applied to me. The proposal that preferences establish\nnon-arbitrary distinctions supports the instrumental theory better than\nrational egoism. \n\nAnother reply to the arbitrariness worry is to claim that certain\ndistinctions just are non-arbitrary. Which distinctions these are is\nrevealed by looking at whether we ask for justifications of the\nrelevance of the distinction. In the case of my maximizing of the\nwelfare of the blue-eyed, we do ask for a justification; we do not take\n“because they’re blue-eyed” as an adequate defense of a\nreason to give to the blue-eyed. In the case of my maximizing my own\nwelfare, however, “because it will make me better off” may\nseem a reasonable justification; we do not quickly ask “why does\nthat matter?” \n\nIn a much-quoted passage, Sidgwick claimed that rational egoism is not\narbitrary: “It would be contrary to Common Sense to deny that\nthe distinction between any one individual and any other is real and\nfundamental, and that consequently ‘I’ am concerned with the quality\nof my existence as an individual in a sense, fundamentally important,\nin which I am not concerned with the quality of the existence of other\nindividuals: and this being so, I do not see how it can be proved that\nthis distinction is not to be taken as fundamental in determining the\nultimate end of rational action for an individual” (Sidgwick\n1907, 498).  This can be interpreted in various ways (Shaver 1999,\n82–98; Phillips 2011, ch. 5). \n\nOn the most natural interpretation, Sidgwick is noting various\nnon-normative facts.  I have a distinct history, memories, and perhaps\nspecial access to my mental contents.  But it is not clear how these\nfacts support the normative conclusion Sidgwick draws.  Utilitarians,\nfor example, agree about these facts.  (Some of the facts may also not\ngive the sharp distinction Sidgwick wants.  I may usually know more\nabout my pain than yours, but this difference seems a matter of\ndegree.) \n\nSidgwick might instead be claiming that attacks on rational egoism\nfrom certain views of personal identity (as in Parfit, discussed\nbelow) fail because they rest on a false view of personal identity.\nBut this would only defend rational egoism against one attack.  Since\nthere are other attacks, it would not follow that the distinction\nbetween people matters. \n\nFinally, Sidgwick might be claiming that my point of view, like an\nimpartial point of view, is non-arbitrary.  But there are other points\nof view, such as that of my species, family or country.  Sidgwick\nfinds them arbitrary.  It is hard to see why my point of view, and an\nimpartial point of view, are non-arbitrary, while anything inbetween\nis arbitrary.  For example, in favour of my point of view, Sidgwick\ncould note that I am an individual rather than a hive-member.\nBut I am a member of various groups as well.  And if my being an\nindividual is important, this cuts against the importance of taking up\nan impartial point of view just as it cuts against the importance of\ntaking up the point of view of various groups.  Similarly, if the\nimpartial point of view is defended as non-arbitrary because it makes\nno distinctions, both the point of view of various groups and my\nindividual point of view are suspect. \n\nDebate over rational egoism was revitalized by Parfit 1984 pts.\nII-III. Parfit gives two main arguments against rational egoism. Both\nfocus on the rational egoist’s attitude toward the future: the rational\negoist holds that the time at which some good comes is by itself\nirrelevant, so that, for example, I ought to sacrifice a small present\ngain for a larger future gain. \n\nFirst, one could challenge rational egoism, not only with the\ninstrumental theory, but also with the “present-aim”\ntheory of rationality. According to the present-aim theory, I have\nmost reason to do what maximizes the satisfaction of my present\ndesires. Even if all of these desires are self-regarding, the\npresent-aim theory need not coincide with rational egoism. Suppose I\nknow that in the future I will desire a good pension, but I do not now\ndesire a good pension for myself in the future; I have different\nself-regarding desires. Suppose also that, looking back from the end\nof my life, I will have maximized my welfare by contributing now to\nthe pension. Rational egoism requires that I contribute now. The\npresent-aim theory does not. It claims that my reasons are relative\nnot only to who has a desire — me rather than someone else — but\nalso to when the desire is held — now rather than in the past or\nfuture.  The obvious justification an egoist could offer for not\ncaring about time — that one should care only about the amount\nof good produced — is suicidal, since that should lead one not to\ncare about who receives the good.  One reason the present-aim theory\nis important is that it shows there is a coherent, more minimal\nalternative to rational egoism. The rational egoist cannot argue that\negoism is the most minimal theory, and that standard moral theories,\nby requiring more of people, require special, additional\njustification.  (For a very different argument to show again that an\nalternative to morality is less minimal than expected — directed more\nat the instrumental theory than rational egoism — see Korsgaard\n2005.) \n\nSecond, rational egoism might be challenged by some views of personal\nidentity.  Say half of my brain will be transplanted to another\nbody A.  My old body will be destroyed.  A will have\nmy memories, traits, and goals.  It seems reasonable for me to care\nspecially about A, and indeed to say that A is\nidentical to me.  Now say half of my brain will go in B and\nhalf in C.  Again B and C will have my\nmemories, traits, and goals.  It seems reasonable for me to care\nspecially about B and C.  But B\nand C cannot be identical to me, since they are not identical\nto one another (they go on to live different lives).  So the ground of\nmy care is not identity, but rather the psychological connections\nthrough memories, etc.  Even in the case of A, what grounds\nmy care are these connections, not identity: my relation to A\nis the same as my relation to B (or C), so what\ngrounds my care about A grounds my care about B\n(or C) — and that cannot be identity.  (To make the\npoint in a different way — I would not take steps to ensure that\nonly one of B and C come about.)  If so, I need not\ncare specially about some of my future selves, since they will not\nhave these connections to me.  And I do have reason to care specially\nabout other people who bear these connections to me now. \n\nOne worry is that psychological continuity might substitute for\nidentity.  Say F1 and F2 are\npsychologically connected because (for\nexample) F2 has a memory\nof F1’s experiences.  Suppose\nthat F3 has a memory of F2’s\nexperiences but no memory\nof F1.  F1\nand F3 are psychologically continuous,\nthough not psychologically connected.  (Parfit’s view is that\npsychological connection and continuity both ground special care, if\nspecial care is grounded at all.)  In the cases\nabove, A, B and C are continuous with me.\nAn egoist might claim that continuity alone matters for special care;\nthat fits the cases.  If so, I do have reason to care specially about\nall of the future selves I am continuous with, and do not have this\nreason to care specially about others with whom I am not continuous.\n(For this and other worries about Parfit, see Brink 1992, Johnston 1997, Hills 2010\n111–116.) \n\nParfit could reply that continuity might not suffice for special care.\nIt is not clear that F1 has reason to care\nspecially about F3 — F3\nmight seem a stranger, perhaps even an unlikeable one.  When young,\nsome worry about becoming someone they would not now like.  They see\nno reason for special care for this future person.  This worry makes\nsense, but if continuity were sufficient for special care, it would\nnot.  If so, perhaps both continuity and connection, or perhaps\ncontinuity and admirability, are needed.  This would let Parfit keep\nthe conclusion that I need not care specially for some of my future\nselves, but would not justify the conclusion that I have reason to\ncare specially about other people who are merely connected to me now\n(or are merely admirable). \n\nA worry is that some do care specially about\nmerely continuous future selves.  With opposed intuitions about when\nspecial care is due, the tactic of arguing from intuitions about\nspecial care to the grounds of this care is indecisive. \n\nThere is another recent argument against rational egoism (Rachels and\nAlter 2005, Tersman 2008, and especially de Lazari-Radek and Singer\n2014).  (1) Believing that rational egoism is true increases my\nreproductive fitness, whether or not rational egoism is true. (2)\nTherefore my belief that rational egoism is true (or, better, that\nrational egoism appears to me true upon reflection) does not help to\njustify rational egoism, since I would have that belief whether or not\nrational egoism is true. (3) For some other normative beliefs (such as\nbelief in utilitarianism), having the belief does not increase\nreproductive fitness.  (4) Therefore my belief that (say)\nutilitarianism is true can help justify utilitarianism.  (Without (3)\nand (4), there is no argument against rational egoism in\nparticular.) \n\nHere I put aside general objections to evolutionary debunking\narguments (see, for example, Shafer-Landau 2012). \n\nOne worry is that what best increases reproductive fitness is acting\nas a kin altruist rather than as a rational egoist (Crisp 2012, Other\nInternet Resources).  Presumably, then, it is believing that I ought\nto act as a kin altruist, rather than as a rational egoist, that best\nincreases my reproductive fitness.  (If there is a tie between what\nincreases reproductive fitness and belief, and believing that rational\negoism is true is best for reproductive fitness, one would expect many\nto believe that rational egoism is true.  But very few do, while many\nendorse Broad’s “self-referential altruism” (Broad\n1971b).)  De Lazari-Radek and Singer reply that the recommendations of\nrational egoism are very close to those of kin altruism, and much\ncloser to those of kin altruism than are the recommendations of\nutilitarianism (2014 194). But rational egoism and kin altruism do\nmake opposed recommendations. For example, kin altruism might\nrecommend that I sacrifice myself for my family, whether I care about\nthem or not, whereas rational egoism would recommend sacrifice only if\nmy welfare were to be higher were I to sacrifice and die rather than\nnot sacrifice and live. It is also hard to think of a plausible\nargument which has kin altruism as a premiss and rational egoism as\nthe conclusion, so doubts about kin altruism do not seem to undercut\narguments for rational egoism.  Nor is it clear how noting a\ndifference in the closeness of recommendations justifies concluding\nthat rational egoism is debunked and utilitarianism not debunked. \n\nAnother worry is that if my belief that I have reason to care about my\nown well-being is unjustified, an argument that starts with that\nreason as a premiss, and then adds that the focus on my own well-being\nis arbitrary and so should be broadened to include everyone, is\nundercut.  One might reply (with de Lazari-Radek and Singer 2014 191)\nthat there are other ways of arriving at the conclusion that I have\nreason to care about the well-being of everyone. Perhaps something\nlike utilitarianism is justified as self-evident rather than inferred\nfrom some other reasons.  The evolutionary argument targets\nconclusions that can be reached only by appeal to a belief\nwhose support can be undercut by noting that we would have the belief\nwhether or not it is true.  It is then open to the rational egoist to\nsay that there is some other way of arriving at rational egoism.\nPerhaps this is unpromising, since the obvious way to justify rational\negoism, as self-evident, is to be undercut by (1) and (2).  However,\n(i) if believing that one ought to act as a kin altruist rather than\nas a rational egoist is what best increases reproductive fitness,\nrational egoism is, like utilitarianism, not undercut by (1) and\n(2). (ii) A component of utilitarianism (and any plausible theory),\nthe belief that pain is bad, seems to be a belief that best increases\nreproductive fitness whether or not it is true (see Kahane 2011 and\n2014).  Even if nothing is good or bad, believing that pain is bad\nmight increase my motivation to avoid pain and so lead me to survive\nlonger. \n\nA further worry is that it is not clear that having the belief\nbest increases reproductive fitness.  De Lazari-Radek and Singer\nargue, in reply to the objection that their argument takes away the\njustification for believing that pain is bad, that there is no\nadvantage to believing that pain is bad; I am sufficiently motivated\nto avoid pain without any such belief (de Lazari-Radek and Singer 2014\n268–269; for the general point, see Parfit 2011 v. 2\n527–30).  The same seems to go for rational egoism: I am\nsufficiently motivated to act egoistically without any belief in the\ntruth of rational egoism. \n\nProspects for psychological egoism are dim.  Even if some version\nescapes recent empirical arguments, there seems little reason, once\nthe traditional philosophical confusions have been noted, for thinking\nit is true.  At best it is a logical possibility, like some forms of\nscepticism. \n\nEthical egoists do best by defending rational egoism instead. \n\nRational egoism faces objections from arbitrariness, Nagel, Parfit,\nand evolutionary debunking. These worries are not decisive.  Given\nthis, and given the historical popularity of rational egoism, one\nmight conclude that it must be taken seriously.  But there is at least\nreason to doubt the historical record.  Some philosophers stressed the\nconnection beween moral action and self-interest because they were\nconcerned with motivation.  It does not follow that self-interest is\nfor them a normative standard.  And many philosophers may have\nespoused rational egoism while thinking that God ensured that acting\nmorally maximized one’s self-interest.  (Some were keen to stress that\nvirtue must pay in order to give God a role.)  Once this belief\nis dropped, it is not so clear what they would have said (Shaver 1999\nch. 4).","contact.mail":"bshaver@cc.umanitoba.CA","contact.domain":"cc.umanitoba.CA"}]
