While she displays a\nrange of interests in these works, her primary concern is to defend a\nmoral epistemology that combines elements of Locke’s epistemology with\na proto-Clarkean moral fitness theory. Cockburn’s morality is best\ndescribed as a broadly rationalistic natural law theory that draws\nstrongly on Locke’s concept of reflection. According to Cockburn we\ndiscover the foundations for moral rules through reflection upon human\nnature and divine nature. Humans are then able to determine moral right\nand wrong by assessing the fitness or unfitness of given acts with\nreference to these natures.\n\n\n\nCockburn was born in London on August 16,\n 1679.[1]\n As a child, she taught herself to write, became proficient in French,\nand studied Latin grammar and logic. In addition to her studies, she\ndevoted time to writing plays. In 1695, Cockburn’s first play\nAgnes de Castro was staged, and was published the following\nyear. In 1698, her second play, Fatal Friendship, was staged\nand printed. Both plays were very well received and she enjoyed some\ncelebrity in theatrical circles. Cockburn wrote three more plays over\nthe next three years. \n\nWhile Catharine Trotter was establishing her reputation as a\nplaywright, she was also studying Locke’s work, An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding. Trotter was so deeply impressed\nwith his ideas that she felt obliged to take up her pen in defense of\nLocke against one critic in particular. This critic was the\nposthumously-identified Thomas Burnet, who, beginning in 1697, wrote\nthree pamphlets in criticism of\nLocke’s Essay. Cockburn’s first philosophical\nwork was a response to Burnet. Entitled The Defence of\nMr. Locke’s Essay of Human Understanding, Cockburn’s\nwork was published in 1702. Locke himself was so impressed with the\nwork, he presented Cockburn with a substantial gift of money and books\nin appreciation. \n\nIn 1739, Cockburn wrote her Remarks upon some Writers in the\nControversy concerning the Foundation of moral Duty and moral\nObligation. It was finally published, anonymously, in 1743 in the\nEnglish literary journal The History of the Works of the\nLearned. Remarks upon some Writers considers primarily\nthe work of philosopher Samuel Clarke and various critics of his moral\ntheory. In 1747, she published a critique of the moral philosophy of\nDr. Thomas Rutherforth, entitled Remarks upon the Principles and\nReasonings of Dr. Rutherforth’s Essay on the Nature and Obligation of\nVirtue, whose work was strongly critical of Samuel\nClarke’s moral theory. In this work, Cockburn again defends a Clarkean\nview of morality. \n\nCockburn was also deeply interested in religious issues and she wrote\nand published a series of theological works. These included a work, in\nthe form of two letters, that examined Catholic and Protestant\ndoctrine entitled A Discourse concerning a Guide in\nControversies. This work was first published in 1707. Another\nwork, first published in 1726, entitled A Letter to Dr. Holdsworth\nOccasioned by his Sermon, was mainly a defense of Locke’s\northodoxy against charges of heresy. She wrote and published a second\nVindication of Locke’s orthodoxy against Holdsworth, in two\nparts. \n\nCockburn’s work had attracted sufficient attention that Thomas Birch\napproached her with the idea of a volume of her collected works,\nincluding her correspondence. She aided in the editing of this work,\nbut did not live to see its publication in 1751. She died in May of\n1749. \n\nAlthough primarily concerned with moral issues, Cockburn philosophical\nwritings (which are taken here to include The Defence of\nMr. Locke’s Essay of Human Understanding (hereafter referred to\nas the Defence), Remarks upon some Writers and\nRemarks upon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr.\nRutherforth’s Essay) address a range of philosophical issues. In\nthe Defence, she answers Burnet on a series of issues\nregarding the deficiencies of Locke’s empiricism, which include not\nonly moral knowledge, but also the knowledge humans can have of God’s\nveracity and of the immortality of the human soul. There is also a\nbroad range of topics addressed in her work Remarks upon some\nWriters, in which Cockburn begins by addressing several\nphilosophical issues – necessity, the infinitude of space, and\nthe nature and existence of spirits with regard to the notion of\nsubstance.  The latter discussion revolves generally around\nepistemological concerns regarding the knowledge of real essences and\nthe nature of substance, in which she argues that spirits must have\nextension of a sort in order to be proper substances. She makes this\nargument by appeal to a broadly Lockean view regarding substance. \n\nHowever, it is her moral theory that is most prominently emphasized\nthroughout her works. Cockburn was mainly concerned with grappling\nwith the defects and strengths of some of the predominating issues in\nmoral theory at this time. Cockburn’s own position is an amalgam of\nthree dominant strains of eighteenth-century morality: moral\nrationalism, moral fitness theory and moral sense theory. Moral\nrationalism is, broadly speaking, the view that morality is the result\nof a rational process, whereby the mind reasons about moral ideas and\ncreates moral rules (although many thinkers, like Cockburn, argued\nthat the mind, by this process, is actually in some way discovering\neternal moral rules).  Moral fitness theory is a rationalist theory\nthat includes the notion that the human mind is able to grasp the\nvarious moral relations that result from the essential natures of\nthings in the universe; e.g., the nature of humans and God creates a\nrelation that necessitates the allegiance of humans to their superior\n(this view was made most famous by Samuel Clarke). Moral sense theory\nis the view that humans possess a special sensory ability that can\ndetermine, pre-rationally, what is good or evil (This view was made\nmost famous by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson). However, for many\ntheorists, like Cockburn, this sensory information is not definitive\n– but is seen as an aid to moralizing that can, and should, be\ncorrected by reason. \n\nCockburn’s earliest philosophical work, the Defence is a\nresponse to the work one of Locke’s critics, Thomas Burnet. In a\nseries of critical pamphlets, Burnet raised doubts concerning the\ntenability of Locke’s epistemology as a foundation for, among other\nthings, moral knowledge. In the Essay and other works, Locke\nhad suggested that morality could be known by reason and had\nemphasized the demonstrative character of morality – thereby\nmaking a claim to the certainty with which moral ideas could be\nknown. However, Locke never provided an explicit account of how\nfundamental moral ideas are derived. Burnet concludes that Locke’s\nepistemology is simply insufficient to the task, and that moral ideas,\non Locke’s system, remain as uncertain as the ideas of God’s nature\nand the immortality of the soul. Burnet uses his critique of Locke as\nthe springboard for his own moral position, one best described as a\nbrand of moral sense theory, in which conscience is the human capacity\nfor empirically discerning the moral value of acts. In other words,\nfor Burnet, one can, upon observing a given set of circumstances, know\nwith immediate certainty whether that act is morally good or evil. \n\nCockburn responds to Burnet by showing that Locke’s epistemology can\nsatisfy these concerns. Cockburn approaches the question of Locke’s\nepistemological foundations by emphasizing an aspect of Locke’s theory\nof ideas of which Locke himself makes little use in his account of\nmoral knowledge. However, it is a concept that he uses in his proof of\nGod’s existence (the proof of which Cockburn reiterates in her\nDefence). Cockburn’s moral theory employs Locke’s concept of\nreflection as a foundation not just for our knowledge of God, but also\nas a means for human moral knowledge. She argues that it is by\nreflecting upon the operations of our own minds that we can reach an\nunderstanding of both human and divine nature. According to Cockburn,\nmorality is grounded in human nature, and the truth of moral laws is\nguaranteed by the fact that humans are designed by God. This emphasis\non human nature leads Cockburn quite naturally into a fitness account\nof morality that predates Clarke’s own view – human nature\nentails that certain actions are fit and appropriate for humans and\ncertain are not. In later works, Cockburn explicitly adopts the\nlanguage of fitness relations to describe the necessary moral order\narising from our created natures. \n\nIn the Defence, Cockburn also introduces the idea of\n‘conscience’ as a way of accounting for human moral\nsentiment.  According to Cockburn, conscience is a faculty, which she\ndescribes as a “sudden affection.” This idea of conscience\nas a kind of natural moral affection complements Cockburn’s view that\nmorality is founded upon human nature: Moral knowledge arises\nfrom reflection upon our own natures and moral affection\narises out of our natural constitutions. Cockburn uses this notion of\nconscience as a response to Burnet’s account of morality. She argues\nthat conscience is not an immediate source of moral knowledge, as\nBurnet would have it, but a source of moral affection or feeling that\ncomplements, and presupposes, a proper (i.e., rational) knowledge of\nmoral laws. \n\nIn later works, Cockburn adopts the term ‘moral sense’ to\ndescribe the affective faculty of conscience, a term which is not\nmeant to signal any affinity with Francis Hutcheson. She understood\nHutcheson to found morality exclusively on the moral sense while her\nown view sees moral sense as only one component within a largely\nrationalistic account of human moral understanding. It is not\nsurprising that Cockburn developed a proto-moral sense theory in the\nDefence and in later works. She sought early on to establish\na foundation for morality in human nature that sufficiently accounted\nfor the type of natural and seemingly immediate human moral\nsensibility that Burnet believed was not accounted for by Locke. \n\nCockburn takes up the defense of Samuel Clarke’s theory in later\nworks. Her first defense of Clarke was made in Remarks upon some\nWriters. Here we find the language of ‘fitness’ occupying\nan even more prominent place than it had done in the Defence.\nThis is only natural, given that the work is partly devoted to a\ndefense of Clarke’s fitness theory, which had come to prominence in\nthe intervening years. Throughout her discussion, Cockburn maintains a\ncommitment to the basic view that morality is founded in the nature of\nhumans and God. She sees this view as cohering with the general\nconcept of fitness that she locates in Clarke and his followers. In\nthe Remarks upon some Writers, Cockburn responds to critics\nof Clarkean moral fitness theory. These critics attack Clarke from a\nshared basic view of morality as a system of laws expressing God’s\nwill. These laws are enforced by rewards and punishments that obligate\nby appealing to the fundamental human desire for happiness and freedom\nfrom pain. Rewards and punishments are thus seen as the fundamental\nmeans of harmonizing God’s will and human interest. Their main\nobjection to fitness theory is that fitness relations are not\nprimitive moral constructs, but actually presuppose more primitive\nconstructs – i.e., God’s will and human interest. Clarke’s\ntheory is accused of failing to provide sufficient account of these\nfundamental facts of divine and human nature. Cockburn responds to\nthis line of criticism by arguing that fitness theory in fact rests\nupon a more robust conception of the relationship between the will of\nGod and human interest than do the voluntarist accounts offered by\nClarke’s critics. \n\nAccording to Cockburn, fitness theory assumes that both human nature\nand God’s creative will are fundamental for morality. Fitness theory\nrests upon the view that human interest is a basic expression of a\nhuman nature brought into being by divine will. Natural good and evil\nare thus fundamental concepts for moral fitness theory, for it is\nhuman nature and all that is associated with it that provides the\nbasis for moral law. For Cockburn, it is through knowledge of our own\nand God’s natures that humans can understand the right and proper\nrelations that ought to subsist in the universe. According to this\naccount, moral obligation arises from the demands of our natures\n– that is, we ought to be guided by that which is suitable and\nproper to our natures as rational and social beings. Common sense\njudges virtuous practice according to what is fit and natural, and not\nmerely according to the good the practice produces. \n\nIn Cockburn’s third and last philosophical work, the Remarks upon\nthe Principles and Reasonings of Dr. Rutherforth’s Essay, she\nanswers Dr. Thomas Rutherforth, a critic of Clarke’s fitness theory.\nRutherforth himself offers a brand of consequentialism, defining as\nmoral goodness that which brings about good and prevents\nevil. Cockburn objects to this view, arguing that it ignores the\nunderlying fitness relations that serve to define what harms and\nbenefits are significant or relevant for human beings in particular\ncircumstances. Even a hermit or someone stranded on a deserted island\nmay possess a sense of virtue, Cockburn argues, since virtue is not\nfounded on our prediction of the effects our actions will have on\nother people. On Cockburn’s view, humans have a natural and innate\ntendency toward what is good and benevolent that transcends merely\nweighing the effects of one’s actions. Cockburn identifies the moral\nsense as being a source of this disinterested affection essential to\nmoral decision-making.  While reason retains its position of\nprominence in her morality, the moral sense plays an important role\naccording to her in motivating agents to act morally. The obligation\nwe feel to obey moral rules arises, for Cockburn, not from reason\nalone, but from the perceptions of natural conscience, or moral\nsense. The moral sense, if governed by the “natural perceptions\nof the understanding,” ought to influence our actions – it\nis a necessary component in creating moral obligation. \n\nHere again, Cockburn sought to distance herself from Hutcheson’s moral\nsense theory. For Cockburn, moral sense was an important factor in\naccounting for moral judgments, but she insisted on its subordination\nto reason as a guide in moral judgment. She holds this moral sense\naccount in concert with her rationalistic fitness view. She presents\nher moral sense theory within the context of a general moral fitness\ntheory, suggesting that Clarkean moral fitness theory could easily\naccommodate such an account. In this way, Cockburn sees herself as\noffering an account of moral motivation not entirely obvious in\nClarke’s theory, but tempering the suggestion of blind instinct she\nsees in Hutcheson’s moral sense view. Cockburn’s morality sought to\nestablish a foundation for morality in human nature that sufficiently\naccounted for the type of natural and seemingly immediate human moral\nsensibility that Burnet believed was not accounted for by Locke and\nthat Clarke’s critics saw as lacking in his fitness view.","contact.mail":"pmsherid@uoguelph.ca","contact.domain":"uoguelph.ca"}]
