His Phenomenology of the Social\nWorld supplied philosophical foundations for Max Weber’s\nsociology and for economics, with which he was familiar through\ncontacts with colleagues of the Austrian school. When Schutz fled\nHitler’s Anschluss of Austria and immigrated to the\nUnited States in 1939, he developed his thought further in\nrelationship to the social sciences, American pragmatism, logical\nempiricism, and to various other fields of endeavor such as music and\nliterature. His work has been influential on new movements in\nsociological thought such as ethnomethodology and conversation\nanalysis. \n\n\n\nVienna-born Alfred Schutz joined the artillery division\nof the Austrian army during World War I and served on the Italian front\nbefore returning to pursue studies at the University of Vienna. There\nSchutz studied law, social science, and business with renowned figures\nsuch as Hans Kelsen and Ludwig von Mises, but his most significant\neducational experience occurred while he was a member of the Mises\nCircle, one of many Viennese circles, of which the “Schlick\nCircle” was the most famous. In the interdisciplinary Mises\nCircle, Schutz formed friendships that would continue throughout the\ncataclysmic decades of the 1930s and 1940s and that included, among\nothers, economists Gottfried von Haberler, Friedrich A. von Hayek,\nFritz Machlup, Oskar Morgenstern, philosopher Felix Kaufmann, and\npolitical scientist Eric Voegelin. While continuing to pursue his\nacademic interests, in 1927 Schutz was named executive officer of\nReitler and Company, a leading Viennese banking firm with international\nbusiness relations, and thus he commenced a life-long pattern that led\nEdmund Husserl to describe him as “a banker by day and a\nphilosopher by night.” \n\nFrom the beginning, Schutz had been taken with the methodological\nwritings of Max Weber, who had lectured in Vienna in the summer of 1918\nand whose work was immensely popular among Viennese intellectuals.\nHowever, Schutz felt that Weber’s work rested on tacit, unexamined\npresuppositions resulting from his lack of interest in fundamental\nepistemological problems that had no direct bearing on his special\nsociological problems. In 1925–1927, Schutz turned to Henri Bergson’s\nphilosophy of consciousness and inner time in order to clarify notions\nsuch as meaning, action, and intersubjectivity, and his results have\nbeen collected in manuscripts published as Life Forms and Meaning\nStructure. Dissatisfied, though, with his analyses of temporality\nto the extent that he never published them and prompted by comments of\nFelix Kaufmann, he discovered the relevance of the phenomenology of the\nconsciousness of inner time of Edmund Husserl (1859–1938). He then went\non to produce his major life’s work, The Phenomenology of the\nSocial World (1932), a work for which Husserl praised him as\n“an earnest and profound phenomenologist.” He spent the\nrest of the 1930s authoring brief essays showing how his phenomenology\nof the social world could come to terms with the economic thought of\nMises and Hayek. Also, before any direct encounter with American\npragmatism, he developed a manuscript on personality in the social\nworld that stressed the pragmatic elements of the everyday social\nworld. \n\nSchutz’s career, academic and business, was thoroughly convulsed\nwhen Adolf Hitler implemented the annexation (Anschluss) of\nAustria by Germany on March 13, 1938, especially since he, on a\nbusiness trip in Paris, was separated for three months from his own\nfamily, whose emigration to Paris he finally arranged. As an\ninternational lawyer and businessperson, he was able to assist numerous\nintellectuals to escape Austria, but the westward movement of the Nazi\njuggernaut eventually compelled him to immigrate with his family to the\nUnited States on July 14, 1939. \n\nIn the United States, he continued assisting immigrants and working\nwith Reitler and Company in reestablishing its business, and he\nsupported the United States war effort by reporting on German and\nAustrian economic matters for the Board of Economic Warfare. He also\ncooperated with Marvin Farber in founding the International\nPhenomenological Society, whose initial turf-battles he often\nmediated, and in instituting and editing Philosophy and\nPhenomenological Research. In 1943, Schutz began teaching\nsociology and philosophy courses on The Graduate Faculty of The New\nSchool for Social Research, and his reponsibilities included presenting\npapers in the school-wide General Seminar, supervising dissertations,\nand serving as chair of the Philosophy Department from 1952–1956. In\nspite of his many activities, he managed to carry on an extensive\nphilosophical correspondence with Farber, Aron Gurwitsch, Fritz\nMachlup, Eric Voegelin, and Maurice Natanson, his graduate student from\n1951 to 1953. However, to date, only the correspondence with Gurwitsch\nhas been published as Philosophers in Exile: The Correspondence of\nAlfred Schutz and Aron Gurwitsch, 1939–1959. While in the United\nStates, Schutz published a collection of articles on a wide variety of\ntopics, explaining and criticizing Husserl’s thought; examining the\nworks of American philosophers such as William James or George\nSantanyana; engaging continental philosophers such as Max Scheler or\nJean-Paul Sartre; developing his own philosophical positions on the\nsocial sciences, temporality, language, multiple realities,\nresponsibility, and symbolism; addressing socio-political questions\ndealing with strangers, homecomers, well-informed citizens, and\nequality; and treating themes in literature and music. \n\nSeveral thinkers have continued Schutz’s tradition in philosophy and\nsociology, such as Maurice Natanson who emphasized the tension between\nindividual, existential and social, anonymizing dimensions of everyday\nlife experience. Thomas Luckmann, who served as co-author for the\nposthumous publication of Schutz’s The Structures of the\nLife-World, developed the sociology of knowledge implications of\nSchutz’s thought and stressed the differences between science and the\nlife-world as well as the importance of language, symbolism, and the\nmoral order of society. While John O’Neill has fused Schutz’s thought\nwith that of Merleau-Ponty by focusing on the lived, communicative\nbody, Richard Grathoff has investigated the experience of normality\nwithin the bounded and situated context of a milieu. Ilja Srubar\ndeveloped the pragmatic dimensions of Schutz’s thought and several of\nits economic and political implications, Lester Embree clarified his\ntypology of the sciences, and Fred Kersten has expanded his aesthetic\ninsights. Drawing on Schutz’s thought, Harold Garfinkel launched\nethnomethodology, and George Psathas, a commentator on\nethnomethodology, played a key role initiating the new discipline of\nconversation analysis. Several other scholars worldwide have dedicated\nthemselves to Schutz’s work and to the development of his insights, and\nGermany, Japan, and the United States are home to archives containing\nSchutz’s work and correspondence. \n\nIn his principal work, Schutz placed three chapters of philosophical\ndiscussion between introductory and concluding chapters that discussed\nthe social scientific positions his philosophy attempted to engage. In\nthe initial chapter Schutz praised Max Weber’s views on value-freedom\nin social science and the autonomy of science vis-à-vis other\nactivities (e.g. politics), and he commended Weber’s methodological\nindividualism and ideal-type methodology. In addition, he applauded\nWeber’s refusal to reduce the social sciences to the natural sciences,\nwhile allowing their ideal-typical results to be testable for adequacy.\nHowever, Schutz also supplemented Weber, pointing out how\ninterpretation was involved even in selecting an experience out of\none’s stream of experience and highlighting how the meaning of an\naction to an actor depended upon the project guiding the extended\ntemporal process of the sub-acts leading to its realization. \n\nThese initial criticisms of Weber required Schutz to develop his\nown theory of meaning and action, beginning with Husserl’s\nstudy of the consciousness of internal time, in particular\nconsciousness’s capacity to capture reflectively and distinguish lived\nexperiences, which at first appear as undefined phases melting into\neach other. Schutz had appropriated this notion of flowing\nconsciousness, or duration, from Bergson, on whom he had\nrelied in the manuscripts later published as Life Forms and Meaning\nStructure. Those manuscripts, for analytic purposes, split the\nego, indivisible in its lived experience, into ideal-typical constructs\nof various life forms, that included the “I” living in duration,\nremembering, acting, thinking, and relating to a “Thou.” Though Schutz\nnever made explicit his reasons for not publishing those earlier\nmanuscripts, Helmut Wagner rightly speculated that he was ill at ease\nsince one could only have access to duration through acts of memory,\nwhich, of course, constituted a life-form entirely separate from\nduration itself. As a result of this methodology relying on distinct\nideal-types, duration began to appear as an inaccessible\nDing-an-sich. Husserl’s account of the consciousness of inner\ntime remedied just this problem by carefully describing how the stream\nof duration was changed at every moment into a remembered\nhaving-just-been-thus, as the primal impression passed into\ninto primary remembrance, or retention. The continuum extending\nbackward from the now of the primal impression through its\nretentions formed a “specious” present, to which the\nreflective acts of secondary remembrance, that is, recollection or\nreproduction, turned, differentiating one experience from another. In\nsum, Husserl’s phenomenological description of experience uncovered the\nprocess of retention that bridged the duration/(reflective) memory gap\nthat had bedeviled Schutz’s earlier efforts insofar as he had relied on\nan ideal-typical methodology, which prevented insight into what goes on\nwithin conscious processes themselves. \n\nSchutz, though, turned the Husserlian account of temporality in the\ndirection of an action theory, demarcating levels of passive experience\n(e.g. bodily reflexes), spontaneous activity without a guiding project\n(e.g., acts of noticing environmental stimuli), and deliberately\nplanned and projected activity, known technically as\n“action” (e.g., writing a book). In planning an action to\nbe realized in the future, one relies on reflective acts of\n“projection,” like those found in reflective memory, only\nnow oriented in a future as opposed to past direction. Through such\nreflectivity, one imagines a project as completed in future perfect\ntense, that is, what will have been realized after one’s acting, and\nthis project, also of central importance for Martin Heidegger and the\npragmatist tradition, establishes the “in-order-to motive”\nof one’s action. By contrast, one’s “because motives”\nconsist in the environmental, historical factors that influenced the\n(now past) decision to embark upon the project and that can only be\ndiscovered by investigating in the “pluperfect tense,” that\nis, exploring those past factors that preceded that past decision. \n\nSchutz’s distinctions here are relevant to contemporary debates\nabout whether freedom is compatible with determinism since from the\nperspective of the lived in-order-to motive, one experiences oneself as\nfree and morally responsible, but from the perspective of examining\none’s because motives after completing one’s action, one correlates, as\nan observer of oneself, the choice of the project with its historical\ndeterminants. Of course, Schutz, working within the parameters of\nHusserl’s non-naturalistic account of consciousness, would have\nconceived such determinants not so much as empirico-mechanical causes\nbut rather as influences discoverable through an interpretive process,\nassociating earlier events with the later ones they seem to have\ninfluenced. Schutz’s position comes closest to the roughly\ncompatibilist outlooks of P.F. Strawson and Thomas Nagel, who\ndistinguish between the participant and observer attitudes prior to\ntheoretical discussions and who align the participant attitude with\nfreedom and the observer attitude with determinism. Schutz, however,\ncontributes the unique insight that these attitudes take place within\ndistinctive temporal frameworks, oriented toward the future or the\npast. \n\nSchutz’s account of the temporal framework of motivation permitted\ncriticism of Weber’s view that one could orient one’s action to the\npast behavior of others, since, while such behavior might have served\nas the because motive of an action, one could not aim at affecting\nanother’s already completed action. Similarly, failure to appreciate\ntemporality often leads to misinterpretations of action, as\nwhen one assumes that the outcome of an act may have been its motive\nwithout considering the actor’s in-order-to motive, which due to\nunforeseen events may have been adjusted or may have led to results\ncontrary to those intended. Likewise, one can interpret an economic\naction after the fact as less than rational without taking sufficient\naccount of the limited information that was available to the actor at\nthe time of deciding to act and that might make her action seem\nperfectly rational. Moreover, the fact that one’s own temporal stream\nof consciousness never completely coincides with that of another, whose\nsequence of events and intensity of experience inevitably differs from\none’s own, places limits on one’s understanding of another. As a\nconsequence, the objective meanings of language, defined in\ndictionaries as invariant regardless of users, also bear subjective\nconnotations for language users due to their unique histories of\nlinguistic experience, even though for practical purposes of\ncommunication they are able to set aside such differences. For\ninstance, one would have to consider in depth Goethe’s works as a whole\nto understand what he meant by “demonic.” Schutz’s basic\npoint in all these examples involves getting behind constituted\nmeanings to the temporal processes by which actors build up the meaning\nof their own actions—a meaningful build-up accentuated by the German\ntitle of his Phenomenology of the Social World (Der\nsinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt). \n\nIn addition to this account of consciousness, motivation, and\naction, he examined the structure of the social world, including\nConsociates who share the same time and spatial access to each other’s\nbodies, Contemporaries with whom one shares only the same time, and\nPredecessors and Successors with whom one does not share the same time\nand to whose lived bodies one lacks access. Consociates, present to\neach other physically, partake of each other’s inner time, that is, the\non-rolling life of the other, grasp the building up of the other’s\nexperience, and live in a We-relationship that entails “growing\nolder together.” While Consociates revise their types of each\nother immediately, one must proceed more inferentially with\nContemporaries, Predecessors, and Successors, constructing ideal types\nbased on letters or reports and running greater risks of\nmisunderstanding, depending on the degree of anonymity of the person to\nbe understood. One could say, then, that Weber’s method of ideal type\nconstruction, illustrated in his sociological account of the Protestant\nat the origins of capitalism, is not really that foreign to the\neveryday life-world in which actors beyond the Consociate level\ncontinually relate to each other via such type construction. Human\nactors in everyday life already adopt toward each other the attitudes\nof social scientists. \n\nSchutz conceived his work as developing a “phenomenological\npsychology” of “inner experience” and focusing on the\ninvariant features of the life-world toward which theoreticians,\nincluding social scientists, turn reflectively. Although Jürgen\nHabermas criticizes Schutz’s account of the life-world for being\n“abridged in a culturalistic fashion” and not addressing\ninstitutional orders and personality structures (Habermas 1987,\n2:126–132), it would seem that Schutz himself delimits his own work in\njust this fashion. According to him, social scientists develop\nconstructs, ideal types, of the meaning-contexts of life-world actors,\nand they test these types to determine if they are causally adequate,\nthat is conforming to past experience, and meaning adequate, that is,\nconsistent with whatever else is known about the actor. Responding to\nMises’s critique that Weber’s ideal-types are too historically\nspecific, Schutz suggested that the later Weber’s ideal types in\nEconomy and Society attain a generality comparable to that of\nMises’ own economic theory, which itself could be interpreted as\npresenting ideal-typical descriptions of the behavior of economic\nagents. The later Weber’s types depict the invariant subjective\nexperiences of anyone who acts within the economic framework as defined\nby the principle of marginal utility, that is, choosing to maximize\nsatisfaction. \n\nSchutz’s manuscripts on Bergson, produced from 1925 to 1927 and\nfinally published in English in 1982, illuminate his subsequent works,\nwith which they share the general purpose of “the grounding of\nthe social sciences in the Thou experience.” (Schutz 1982, 34) In\nreaction to positivistic approaches of the Schlick Circle (in which\nFelix Kaufmann participated) that reduced experience to what the method\nof natural scientific observation found tolerable, Schutz sought to\ngive an account of the life-form of pre-scientific experience preceding\nconceptual-categorical comprehension, the “highest and most\npowerful life-form” (Schutz 1982, 53). Of course, by moving in\nthis direction, he encountered the problem, faced by Georg Wilhelm\nFriedrich Hegel, Wilfrid Sellars, John McDowell, Robert Brandom, and\nothers, namely, how it is possible to access the pre-conceptual without\nconceptualizing it. Hence, he acknowledged that his work is “in\nconflict with its material” since it “is forced to resort\nto conceptual formulations” (Schutz 1982, 70). This problem\nparallels the problem of reaching the life-form of the present\nunfolding of experience (duration) since one can only speak of it by\narresting its flow, distinguishing its moments, and thus remembering\nwhat has lapsed—but then one is in the new life-form of memory.\nAlthough this gap between present duration and memory prompted his turn\nto Husserlian phenomenology, the problematic itself highlighted for him\nthe pervasiveness and hiddenness of interpretive activity as one moves\nbetween interpretive frameworks—a principal theme of all his later\nwork. He took notice of this theme when he frequently pointed out how\none’s reconstitution of a past experience in memory varied according to\nthe interests of the present from which one remembered the\npast. Indeed a favorite example from Bergson’s work involved an actor\nreflecting upon a prior process of choosing and interpreting it as if\nit had been a choice between two clearly defined possibilities, whereas\nin fact the process often oscillated between several options,\nretaining, reproducing, comparing, and modifying them in succession. In\ngeneral, Schutz concurred with Bergson on such notions such as\nattention to life, planes of consciousness, the body as the\nintersection of outer and inner temporality, music as the model of\nduration, and multiple types of ordering, but rejected his\nbio-evolutionary theory, vitalism, and the idea of a supra-personal\nelán. \n\nAlthough Schutz defended Weber against Mises, he agreed with many\nbasic premises of Mises and the Austrian tradition that focused on the\nsubjective preferences of the purchaser conferring value on objects\ninstead of explaining value as the result of objective processes such\nas production costs or labor time invested. He also shared Mises’s\nsuppositions about value-freedom in economic science, the need to\ndescribe rather than evaluate preferences, and the instrumental task of\nscience, namely, of showing how to achieve ends rather than assessing\ntheir value. Since Mises considered all acting economic insofar as any\nconsumer choice involved maximizing satisfaction in the widest sense,\nhe opposed the narrow type of the homo economicus, modeled on\nthe businessperson driven solely by economic motives at the expense of\nall others. Schutz, however, posited the life-world with its wide\ndiversity of motivations at the base of economic theory. He conceived\nsuch theory as adopting a reflective perspective governed by the\nprinciple of marginal utility, namely, that ideal types ought to be\nconstructed as if all actors “had oriented their life-plans to\nrealize the greatest utility with minimal cost.” (Schutz 1964, 87)\nBesides thus resuscitating a version of homo economicus,\nSchutz insisted that economists study purposive-rational actions,\nwhich, in Weber’s sense, involved a reflective comparison of\nalternative projects before adopting one as an in-order-to motive. In\naddition, he classified the sense of uneasiness that Mises described as\nprompting the search for satisfaction under the category of because\nmotives; one first adopts an rationally determined economic project and\nin retrospect discovers the preceding dissatisfaction. To understand\nthe difference between conceiving all action as economic and conceiving\neconomic action as one type of action within an more encompassing\nlife-world, one might compare Mises with Schutz with reference to a\nproblem raised within contemporary discussions of collective action,\nnamely, how traditional non-economic values (e.g., those of politics or\nethics) ought to intersect the market. Mises would countenance economic\nagents registering their values economically, that is, by deciding to\npurchase or not (e.g. as a protest against polluting companies),\nthereby converting all values into economic ones, whereas Schutz would\ncall for a process negotiating the boundaries between different\nlife-world value domains. \n\nIn “Concept and Theory Formation in the Social Sciences,”\nSchutz addressed the broader issue of the relationship between\nphilosophy and the social sciences in general. In that essay, Schutz\nresponded to Ernest Nagel’s positivistic view that the social sciences\nshould make use of natural scientific methods, identifying evidence\nwith sensory observable data and criticizing the Weberian method of\n“understanding” as appealing to uncontrollable and\nunverifiable introspection. Schutz agreed with Nagel on several\ncounts, namely that social scientists needed to validate theoretical\nbeliefs, that lack of predictability in the social sciences did not\ndisqualify their scientific character, and that Weber would have been\nwrong if his method of “subjective interpretation” implied\nempathy with unobservable, introspective states. The problem was,\nthough, that the natural scientific approach to the social sciences,\ninsofar as it separated verifiable observable behavior from\nunverifiable inner states (purposes, emotions), seemed to play on the\nmap drawn by Descartes who divorced body from mind and allowed only\nstatements about the former to be scientifically verifiable. Further,\nthe natural scientific approach depended on a basic presupposition\nsince without first examining the object of social \nscience—social reality, in Schutz’s terms—one would be simply\npresupposing that the methods of the natural sciences were appropriate\nto its study. Therefore, Schutz attempted first to clarify social\nreality, described in depth by his own phenomenology of the social\nworld, and to indicate how actors sustain that reality by\nunderstanding each other’s in-order-to motives in typical terms (e.g.,\ngoing to school, making a purchase, marrying). Such mutual\nunderstanding takes place without either somehow or other penetrating\ninto the other’s private, inner sanctum, or reducing the other to the\nstatus of animal organism responding to stimuli. Given this account of\nsocial reality, in which actors give meaning to their world, as\nopposed to physical reality whose objects (e.g., electrons, quarks) do\nnot interpret their world, Schutz argued that the appropriate social\nscientific method involved developing constructs of everyday actor’s\nconstructs. Social scientific constructs, ideal types in Weber’s\nsense, aimed at capturing the subjective meaning of the actor, that\nis, according to Weber’s intentions, the meaning of the actor as\nopposed to the social scientist and not some introspective inner\nprocess. Schutz conceived statistical and other formulations of social\nscientific laws as a legitimate kind of intellectual shorthand, always\npresupposing the meaningful activity of the individual social actor,\nthe “forgotten man” of the social sciences (Schutz 1964,\n6–7).  To ensure the kind of validation that Nagel sought,\nmistakenly though, by restricting himself to sensory observable data,\nSchutz proposed that social scientists displace their everyday\npractical interests in favor of a guiding interest in accurate\nscientific description and observe postulates of logical consistency\nand adequacy to the experiences described. \n\nIn order to elucidate the meaning of rational action, Schutz\nhypothesized what a rational actor would have to know, even though such\ncompletely rational actions might never be realized in everyday life.\nSuch an actor would have to know: an end’s relationship with other\nends, the consequences and by-products of realizing an end, the means\nsuitable for the end, the interaction of such means with other ends and\nmeans, and the accessibility of those means. In addition, the rational\nactor would need to understand: her interactors’ understanding of all\nthe previous factors, the interpretation of her act by others, the\nreactions of other people and their motivation, and the useful\ncategories she had already discovered in the social world. Although\nsocial scientists might use such models of completely rational action\nto assess the rationality of everyday actors, Schutz cautioned social\nscientists that if their task were to describe life-world actors, they\nalso needed to be wary of replacing the viewpoint of everyday actors\nwith a fictional, non-existing world constructed by scientific\nobservers. In fact, a central point of discussion in the published\ncorrespondence between Schutz and Talcott Parsons concerned the\nsubjective viewpoint of the actor, whose sub-acts, for example, could\nnot be adequately understood without comprehending the actor’s\noverarching project, whose temporal span is at first accessible only to\nthat actor. Finally, it should be noted that Schutz himself produced\ntwo pieces of applied research in which he constructed ideal types of\nthe Stranger and the Homecomer, taking account of what their\nexperiences meant to them instead of what social scientists or others\nmight think they meant. \n\nAlthough references to philosophers in the pragmatist tradition,\nsuch as John Dewey and George Herbert Mead are scattered through\nSchutz’s writings, it was to William James that he devoted his first\nfull-length essay after arriving in the United States. Briefly alluding\nto the methodological differences between Husserl and James, he\nemphasized two points where the “great masters” converged:\nthe stream of thought and the theory of fringes. Both thinkers stressed\nthat personal consciousness involves no multiplicity of elements\nneeding to be reunited, but rather a unity from which one separates out\ncomponents, and they each examined the modifications that reflection\nintroduces into the lived stream, converting an “I” into a\n“Me” or uncovering the workings of intentionality. Further,\nHusserl’s idea that the kernel of meaning distinguishing an object\nstood out against the unthematized network of relationships that makes\nup its horizon parallelled James’s belief that topics have their\n“fringes.” Such fringes connect a topic with other\nexperiences, such that, for instance, one does not hear merely\n“thunder,” but\n“thunder-breaking-in-upon-silence-and-contrasting-with-it.”\nSimilarly, the Jamesian idea about grasping as a unity what must be\nlearned through a many-stepped processes, such as the Pythagorean\ntheorem, could be translated into the Husserlian terminology regarding\nthe monothetical grasping of polythetic processes. Likewise, James’s\ndiscussion of focusing on an object within a broader topic resembled\nHusserl’s view that one could discern a noema, that is, a perspectival\naspect through which a thing constituted of many such aspects presented\nitself. \n\nAnother American philosopher to whom Schutz dedicated an entire\nessay was George Santayana, whose Dominations and Powers he\nreviewed. While most of the essay was expository, Schutz praised\nSantayana’s effort to base politics on a philosophical anthropology and\nhis insights into the enslaving potential of technology. However,\nSchutz, no doubt convinced by Mises’s positive assessment of economic\nactivity, resisted Santayana’s reduction of it to domination. Likewise,\nas a phenomenologist opposed to a Santayana’s naturalistic founding of\nspirit on the physical order of nature, Schutz dissented from a\nconviction derived from this naturalism, namely, that democracy could\nsolve it problems only by returning to the “generative\norder” of agriculture. \n\nBesides these interchanges with American philosophers, Schutz (later\nin his career) interpreted the work of Max Scheler and (earlier)\nengaged thoroughly his treatment of intersubjectivity, a topic that\nSchutz insisted was to be treated within the natural attitude, in\nwhich one never doubted the existence of others. Schutz agreed with\nScheler’s belief that the “We” is given prior to the\n“I”—a position that the latter defended on the\nbasis of the psychology of children and cultures less accustomed to\nself-reflection. Schutz supported this priority, however he did so on\nthe grounds that while living in one’s acts in the natural attitude\nand living also in the other’s present experience as it unfolds, one\nat first does not clearly distinguish one’s own thoughts from\nothers’. Nevertheless, as soon as one reflects on his own stream of\nconsciousness—and children and cultures may develop this\ncapacity for self-reflection later—he becomes aware that his\nexperiences are his own. Schutz found plausible Scheler’s belief in\nthe inner (indubitable) perception of the other, if “inner\nperception” refers to anything connected with mental life or if\none locates the experience of living in the vivid simultaneity of the\n“We” within his own conscious stream, as Schutz believed\npossible. However much in that vivid simultaneity one might be unable\nto doubt the other’s existence, one could still be mistaken about\nspecific thoughts of the others, since by belonging to\nthe other’s stream of consciousness these thoughts share the\ndubitability characterizing outer perceptions, likewise transcendent\nto one’s stream of experience. \n\nAnother figure, more or less within the phenomenological tradition,\nwhose views on intersubjectivity Schutz examined and criticized, was\nJean-Paul Sartre, particularly the Sartre of Being and\nNothingness. In “Sartre’s Theory of the Alter Ego,”\nSchutz elucidated Sartre’s attempt to develop an extra-empirical, real\ncommunication with the other that avoids the extremes of an empiricist\nintersubjectivity beginning with the other’s body and an idealist\nreduction of the other to a series of presentations. After explaining\nSartre’s differences regarding intersubjectivity with Husserl, Hegel,\nand Heidegger, Schutz laid out Sartre’s existential account of how the\nother is given as a subject through the Look and how one can in turn\nobjectify the other by returning the gaze. Although Sartre had intended\nto describe how one’s body is given to the other, he instead portrayed\nhow the other’s body is given to oneself, assuming that such\ndescriptions were reversible. Schutz, who did not believe that the\nproblem of intersubjectivity could be addressed adequately within the\ntranscendental sphere, applauded Sartre’s rejection of Husserl’s\ntranscendental approach to intersubjectivity; however, Sartre’s\nemphasis on the other as a center of activity reflected a continuing\nHusserlian influence. The main problem, though, with Sartre’s doctrine\nwas that its starting point in a mutual looking, by which each subject\nreduces the other to an object, precluded any possibility of a\nrelationship between the I-subject and other-subject. Further, Schutz\nwondered how Sartre would know that the other’s body was given to him\nin the same way that his body was to the other if the other’s\nsubjectivity escaped his “I.” Moreover, Schutz acknowledged\nthat the other’s interests might not coincide with his own, but he\nfailed to see how this fact entailed that either the other or he reduce\neach other to a utensil. Instead, he pointed to the “mutual\ntuning-in” to be found in making music together and in language\nas proof that subjects interact as “co-performing\nsubjectivities” and that mutual interaction in freedom better\ndescribes intersubjectivity than Sartre’s practical solipsism. \n\nIn 1945, Schutz published an essay, “On Multiple\nRealities,” that extended the theory of The Phenomenology of\nthe Social World and anticipated later essays applying that\ntheory. While he reiterated earlier views about levels of activity,\nBergsonian tensions of consciousness, and the structure of the social\nworld, his work took a decidedly pragmatic twist, emphasizing\n“working” (Wirken) as involving bodily movements\nas opposed to the covert performances of mere thinking. In manuscripts\nin the 1930s and after The Phenomenology of the Social World,\nSchutz had already turned in this pragmatic direction. In “On\nMultiple Realities,” he enlarged upon the “world of\nworking” by demonstrating how reflection dissolves the self\nunified in lived action into partial, role-taking selves and by\nexpanding Mead’s idea of the “manipulatory sphere” to\ninclude worlds within “potential reach,” either restorable\n(from the past) or attainable (in the future). This “world of\nworking” constitutes the paramount reality, organized in its\ninterests in the face of the fundamental anxiety that derives, as it\ndid for Heidegger, from the inescapability of one’s own\ndeath. Following Husserl’s views on how consciousness can modify its\nstances toward reality and de-ontologizing James’s sub-universes of\nreality, Schutz developed the notion of various finite provinces of\nmeaning. One enters any of these provinces, such as those of\nphantasms, dreams, the theater, religious experience, or theoretical\ncontemplation, by undergoing different types of\nepoché, analogous to the phenomenological protoype, as\nwhen one slips into a daydream, falls asleep, watches theater curtains\nopen, commences a ritual, or assumes the scientist’s role. Each\nprovince contains its distinctive logical, temporal, corporal, and\nsocial dimensions, and movement between the provinces only becomes\nparadoxical (e.g., asking how phenomenologists are able to communicate\ntheir private findings publicly) if one conceives the provinces as\nontological static realms to which one transmigrates as a soul to\nanother world. Rather the provinces are permeable, and one adopts the\nattitudes of scientist or religious believer within the world\nof working as if it were seen through by another viewpoint, all the\nwhile that its communicative activities subtend these other\nprovinces. There is something paradoxical, though, about describing\none’s dreams or theorizing about religious experience since to give an\naccount one must absent oneself from the province for which one\naccounts, and Kierkegaard’s notion of indirect communication and\nvarious postmodern critiques of theory address themselves to just such\nparadoxes. \n\nThe essay on multiple realities underpins Schutz’s theory of signs\nand symbols in “Symbol, Reality, and Society,” published\nalmost ten years later. Synthesizing the notion of potential reach from\nthe earlier essay with Husserl’s concept of appresensation, namely that\none element of a pair refers to another not directly given in\nexperience, Schutz describes how agents overcome whatever transcends\nthem. Hence they leave marks to bring within reach what they\nleave behind (e.g., breaking a twig to remind oneself to turn when one\nreturns) or follow indications, that is, regular connections\nnot of their making (e.g. smoke indicating a not yet visible fire), to\nbring within their knowledge what lies beyond it. Signs,\nhowever, appresent in an intersubjective setting the meanings of one\nperson to another, but an insuperable transcendence still remains\ninsofar as the each one’s stream of consciousness and therefore\nmeanings are never identical with another’s. Finally, through\nsymbols, developed within groups, something given within\neveryday reality appresents a reality belonging to a entirely different\nprovince of meaning, an ultimate transcendence (e.g., the stone where\nJacob dreamed of a ladder to heaven memorializes God, accessible within\nthe religious province of meaning). \n\nSchutz dealt with this theme of language in other contexts,\ncomparing Husserl’s distinction between prepredicative\n(prepropositional) and predicative levels with Kurt Goldstein’s\nseparation, based on studies of brain lesions, of a concrete attitude\nrelying on automatic speech associations from an abstract attitude\nforming propositions and utilizing rational language. Husserl’s\nprepredicative/predicative differentiation plays a key role in Schutz’s\nessay “Type and Eidos in Husserl’s Late Philosophy,” in\nwhich he shows a gradual development from empirical types passively\nconstituted within the prepredicative sphere to presumptive universals\nspontaneously formed in the predicative sphere. At the predicative\nlevel, scientific reflection further transforms nonessential types\n(e.g., that whales are fish) into essential ones (whales are mammals),\nand philosophy seeks eidetic universals. At the end of this essay,\nSchutz speculates whether the Husserlian method of freely varying\nexamples to determine the essential features that survive through such\nvariations is not constrained by both ontological structure (e.g.,\nsounds are not colors) and the socially shaped, natural-attitude\nexperience of types. In his essay “Tiresias, or our Knowledge of\nFuture Events,” produced contemporaneously with the type essay,\nSchutz explains how knowledge based on natural attitude types functions\nin contrast to the mythical Tiresias’ knowledge of the future, which is\nprivate and detached from his present or past experience. These types,\nbased on past experiences or socially transmitted, aim at future\noccurrences not in their uniqueness but with an emptiness that future\nevents will fill in, such that only in retrospect, after an event\noccurs, is one able to determine how much that event was expected or\nunexpected. Finally, there are future events lying beyond one’s\ninfluence that one expects only to conform with past experience and\nthere are indeterminate projects that provide direction—not too\ntightly, though—as one gives shape to what is within one’s\npower. \n\nSchutz, himself a trained pianist and widely read musicologist,\nintegrated his phenomenology with his understanding of music. Music,\ndiffering from language in being non-representative, lends itself to\nphenomenological analysis in the meaning it carries beyond its mere\nphysical nature as sound waves and in its character as an ideal object\nthat must be constituted through its unfolding stages, i.e.,\npolythetically. Further music is bound to inner temporality, and its\nthemes, even though their note sequences are the same, vary according\nto context, require reflection for their recognition, and emerge\nthrough an interplay between musical elements and the listener’s\nattention and interest. Schutz found music instructive in regard to\nsocial relationships insofar as, prior to any communication, parties to\nmusical performances establish a non-linguistic, non-conceptual\n“mutual tuning in relationship.” This\n“tuning-in,” this sharing of another’s flux of experience\nin inner time already described in his Phenomenology, is very\nclearly exhibited whenever a listener to a musical performance\nparticipates in quasi-simultaneity in the composer’s stream of\nconsciousness or when co-performers orient themselves to each other,\nthe composer, and the audience. Hence, Schutz disagreed with Maurice\nHalbwachs who posited musical notation as the basis of social\nrelationships between performers, when in fact it is merely a technical\ndevice accidental to their relationship. In another essay, Schutz\ndepicted Mozart as a social scientist, presenting a succession of\nsituations that different characters interpret, and Schutz showed how\norchestral representations of characters and their moods in melody made\npossible a simultaneity of fluxes of inner time that the non-operatic,\nnonmusical dramatist could only unfold successively. Without\nself-consciously philosophizing, Mozart conveyed in music and better\nthan most philosophers in their own medium, how human beings meet each\nother as a “We.” \n\nFred Kersten discovers in Schutz’s musical writings important\nphilosophical insights. For instance, music and inner time unfold\npolythetically and cannot be grasped monothetically; that is, one must\nlive through the unfolding of a symphony or inner experience, and any\nconceptual summary of their contents inevitably fails to do justice to\ntheir meaning. However, since all conceptualization consists in a\nmonothetical grasping of polythetic stages, Schutz is actually\nrealizing that certain dimensions of consciousness elude\nconceptualization and thus demarcating the limits of rationalization,\njust as he had pointed out how certain provinces of meaning (e.g.\ndreams) evade theoretic comprehension or duration eludes memory.\nAccording to Kersten, Schutz has seen clearly that the passive\nassociations of listening (e.g. recognizing the appearance of symphonic\ntheme) differ from those of sight (e.g., apprehending an object like a\nhouse) and that listening does not identify numerically distinct items\nbut produces an illusion of identification. Schutz’s conclusion that\nsameness in music involves not numerical unity but recurrent likeness\nchallenges the fundamental Husserlian thesis that the synthesis of\npassive identification is universal, at the basis of the constitution\nof the world. \n\nSchutz was also a master of literature, a careful student of the\nworks of Goethe, and author of an article that analyzed Miguel de\nCervantes’s Don Quixote through the prism of the theory of\nmultiple realities. Cervantes repeatedly brings Quixote’s “world\nof chivalry”—an order of reality with its arguments for its\nown reality, its stock of knowledge, modes of social reinforcement, and\nviews about space, time, and causality—into conflict with the worlds\nof drama, common sense, and science. Although Quixote is capable of\nconstructing a defense of his own chivalrous world from within that\nworld, the fact that this phantasied world contains an enclave of\ndreams (at the cave of Montesinos) ends up undermining it by raising\nthe possibility that it itself is but a dream. Quixote’s withdrawal of\nthe accent of reality from his private province of meaning reveals for\nSchutz the importance of the paramount reality of everyday life and the\nvalue of Sancho Panza who “remains deeply rooted in the heritage\nof common sense.” (Schutz 1964, 158) \n\nSchutz also brought his phenomenology to bear on political issues\nsuch as citizenship or racial equality. His essay “The\nWell-Informed Citizen,” dealing not only with citizenship but\nalso the sociology of knowledge under the rubric of the social\ndistribution of knowledge, constructs ideal types of the expert, the\nman on the street, and the well-informed citizen (to whom it falls to\ndetermine which experts are competent). Schutz delineates various zones\nof interests, or relevances, extending from those within reach to those\nabsolutely irrelevant, comments on the constant changeability of\nrelevance configurations, and differentiates between relevances\nintrinsic to a theme, which one chooses, and those imposed.\nParadoxically, as modernity’s rationalization processes heighten\nanonymity, modern technology also brings everyone within reach, as the\nnuclear arms race demonstrates, and Schutz suggests as a solution that\ncitizens become broadly informed rather than succumb to the narrow\ndogmatism of the man on the street or the short-sighted specialization\nof experts. In becoming well-informed, one depends on knowledge\nsocially derived through the consultation of eyewitnesses, insiders,\nanalysts, and commentators, depending on their access to facts and\ngoverning relevances, much as Alvin Goldman’s social epistemology\ninvolves appraising the veritistic value of assorted agents’ claims and\npractices. Schutz, usually the value-free describer of social reality,\nin his conclusion endorses a normative notion of democracy in which it\nis a duty and a privilege, frequently not available in non-democratic\nsocieties, for well-informed citizens to express and defend opinions\nthat often conflict with the uninformed opinions of the man in the\nstreet. \n\nSchutz composed “Equality and the Meaning Structure of the\nSocial World” at the time of the legal decision of Brown v.\nBoard of Education that ended racially segregated education in the\nUnited States. With typical dispassion, Schutz explains how the meaning\nof the term “equality” depends on the domain of relevances\nto which it pertains (e.g., economic equality, equality of civil\nrights, etc.) and on the in-group or out-group utilizing it—and here\nhe conceives interpretation in terms of groups rather than individuals.\nHe spends most of the essay contrasting subjective and objective\ninterpretations of group membership, equality, and equality of\nopportunity, construing “subjective” and\n“objective” in terms of in-group and out-group\ninterpretations. As regards group membership, he illustrates that the\nmere categorization of another as a member of a group need not be\ndiscriminatory, but depends upon an appropriate evaluation of the\ncategory from the viewpoint of the categorized individual. In-groups\nand out-groups differ in whether they understand equality merely as\n“formal,” i.e., as nondiscrimination, or\n“real,” calling for special rights and services. Similarly\ngroups think of equality of opportunity from an out-group perspective\nas “the career open to all” without appreciating how\nin-group members might subjectively experience insuperable obstacles in\ntrying to avail themselves of opportunities supposedly objectively\nequal. In this essay, Schutz is concerned not to present a final\ndefinition of equality, but to highlight the differences between\nin-group and out-group understandings that serve as the preconditions\nof any discussion about it. \n\nSome recently published texts that Schutz authored during an ethics\ninstitute in 1956 make possible an even richer awareness of his views\non politics. In these documents, he recognizes the complex, unforeseen\nconsequences resulting from social change, urges active engagement with\nothers as crucial for developing social and civil judgment, and\nexamines the barriers to sound civil judgment created by government,\npolitical parties, pressure organizations, mass media, and educational,\nfamilial, religious, and professional institutions. At one point, he\neven criticizes views that limit democracy to mere majoritarian rule\ninsofar as they neglect the importance of the single individual’s\nability “to make his personal opinion be heard and\nappreciated,” preferably in smaller publics, such as families,\nschools, local communities (cited in L. Embree 1999, 271). One could\ntake Schutz’s thoughts here to converge with political theories\nfavoring what is today known as deliberative democracy. Moroever, his\nnormative judgment against implementations of democracy that increase\nthe anonymity of citizens suggests that a parallel normative, even\nethical, dimension informs his many theoretic endeavors to retrieve\nfrom anonymity the neglected subjective viewpoint of actors, whether\nstrangers, homecomers, victims of discrimination, or the\n“forgotten man” of social sciences. \n\nSchutz’s philosophical targeting of the social world had its\nrepercussions upon phenomenology, particularly in his critique near the\nend of his career of Husserl’s account (also referred to as a\n“transcendental constitution”) of how the other person\ncomes to appearance in consciousness. In “The Problem of\nTranscendental Intersubjectivity in Husserl,” Schutz first\nobjected when Husserl in his Fifth Cartesian Mediation prepared the\nground for the other’s appearance in consciousness by the methodology\nof screening off everything that referred to other minds. Husserl had\nbegun the Cartesian Meditations by reflectively abstaining\nfrom believing in the existence of what appeared in experience in order\nto refrain from any dogmatic suppositions, but since this first\nepoché, or phenomenological reduction, still left\nmeanings with intersubjective references, the screening off\nmethodology, or second epoché, became necessary. For\nHusserl, one’s actual or potential experiences of correlates\nthat were not properly of the ego still would belong to one’s sphere of\nownness, but one had to seek to exclude any reference those correlates,\nas products of the sense-determining of other subjectivities, might\nhave to those other subjectivities. For Schutz, however, insofar as\nthose experiences of what was not properly of the ego, supposedly\nconfined within the sphere of ownness, had their origin in the\nintersubjective world of everyday life that higher level\nphenomenological reflection presupposed, it seemed difficult to see how\none could exclude from such correlates any reference to the\nsense-determinining of other subjectivities. It was as though Husserl\nwas striving for a theoretical detachment that the ontological origins\nof theory would not allow. In addition, for Schutz the very\nconsciousness of another inevitably instituted a relationship with her.\nHusserl’s argument in the Fifth Meditation continued by affirming that\na non-ratiocinative “pairing” occurred through which one\ntransferred the sense “another living body” to another. One\ncould then verify that the other’s living body was like one’s own if it\ncontinued manifesting behavior congruent with what one would expect of\na living body. Schutz challenged this sense-transfer, however, since\none experienced the other’s body from the outside, unlike one’s own,\nwhich was given interiorily (but might the similarities suffice for the\ntransfer?), and he suggested that verification through what was\n“congruent” behavior drew on social-world presuppositions\nof how bodies ought to behave. Finally, he questioned whether the\nphilosopher, refraining from belief in the existence of the world or\nothers and entering into a certain reflective solitude, could ever\nexperience the transcendental community of which Husserl spoke, since\nshe only constituted the world for herself and not for all other\ntranscendental egos. Intersubjectivity, Schutz concluded, was a matter\nof everyday life to be simply described and not to be constituted\nwithin the transcendental sphere of a self-reflective consciousness\ngiving an account of how the other comes to appearance. Just as Schutz\nhad argued that the social world dictated the methods for its own\nsocial scientific investigation, so here it seemed to prescribe to\nphenomenology the approach appropriate to its description. \n\nIn the last thirteen years of his life, Schutz was preparing a\ncomprehensive phenomenology of the natural attitude, and one\nmanuscript, edited by Richard Zaner, was posthumously published as\nReflections on the Problem of Relevance, and another,\nco-authored by Thomas Luckmann, appeared as The Structures of the\nLife World. The former book distinguishes different sets of\ninterests, or relevances: topical (which focus attention on themes),\ninterpretive (which confer meanings on experiences or objects), and\nmotivational. Such relevances often involve a subject, with more or\nless systematic interests, or relevances, interacting with the world,\nand from this interaction between subject and world, it becomes evident\nwhat is “of relevance” to an actor. These relevances,\ninterdependent on each other and conjoined with one’s system of types\nor categories, constitute a stock of knowledge, which Schutz examines\nin terms of its genesis and structure. He further explores the meaning\nof one’s biographical situation, including types and relevances, one’s\nbody, and the ontological constraints of space and time that, for\ninstance, prevent one from being at certain places at certain times or\ncompel one to wait (for salt to dissolve in water). \n\nThe Structures of the Life-World represents a most complex\nand thorough restatement of many of the themes Schutz addressed\nthroughout his life. After a more general account of the life-world and\nits relation to the sciences, the book takes up its various\nstratifications, such as provinces of meaning, temporal and spatial\nzones of reach, and social structure. Schutz and Luckmann then comment\non the components of one’s stock of knowledge, including learned and\nnon-learned elements, relevances and types, and trace the build-up of\nsuch a stock. The authors study the social conditioning of one’s\nsubjective stock of knowledge and inquire about the social stock of\nknowledge of a group and different possible combinations of knowledge\ndistribution (generalized and specialized). They consider how\nsubjective knowledge becomes embodied in a social stock of knowledge\nand how the latter influences the former. In addition, the authors\npursue such issues as the structures of consciousness and action, the\nchoosing of projects, rational action, and forms of social action,\nwhether such action be unilateral or reciprocal, immediate or mediate.\nA final section analyzes the boundaries of experience, different\ndegrees of transcendencies (from simply bringing an object within reach\nto the experience of death), and the mechanisms for crossing boundaries\n(e.g. symbols). \nIn the years after Schutz’s death in 1959, his works have been\nposthumously published and his thought expanded in several\ndirections. Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote The Social\nConstruction of Reality, which focused on how subjective human\nprocesses construct objective structures that human subjectivity in\nturn interprets and reacts to and which was among the most widely read\nbooks of social science in the twentieth century. Ilja Srubar\nemphasized the importance of the pragmatic dimensions of Schutz’s\ncorpus, just as Hans-Georg Soeffner, along with Jochen Dreher, has\ndeveloped its symbolic aspects. On Schutzian grounds, Lester Embree\nproduced a theory of science in the model of\na Wissenschaftslehre, and George Psathas extended Schutz’s\nthought in the direction of ethnomethodology and conversation\nanalysis. Recently, sociologists Hubert Knoblauch and Carlos Belvedere\nhave shown the relevance of Schutz’s framework to communication theory\nand questions of social ontology, respectively. The Austrian Economic\nSchool has continued to make use of Schutz’s works, as Daniela\nGriselda López has shown. López and Dreher have further\nargued that Schutzian theory can adequately account for the exercise\nof institutional power through the interplay between objective\nstructures and subjective meaning-interpretation and the idea of\nrelevances that are imposed upon agents. Michael Staudigl and George\nBerguno have edited a collection of essays on the connection between\nthe Schutzian approach and various hermeneutic traditions. And\nStaudigl and Michael Barber have highlighted the connections between\nSchutz’s philosophy of multiple realities and religion and\nhumor. Furthermore, collections of essays have addressed the value of\nSchutz’s paradigm for music, literature, and the arts. The work of\nAlfred Schutz opens a wide field that is fruitful for addressing\nmultiple themes and underpinning and supporting multiple\ndisciplines.","contact.mail":"michael.barber@slu.edu","contact.domain":"slu.edu"}]
