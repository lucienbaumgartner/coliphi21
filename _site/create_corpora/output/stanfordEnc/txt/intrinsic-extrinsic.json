We have other properties in virtue of the\nway we interact with the world. (Our weight is an example.) The former\nare the intrinsic properties, the latter are the extrinsic properties.\nThis seems to be an intuitive enough distinction to grasp, and hence\nthe intuitive distinction has made its way into many discussions in\nphilosophy, including discussions in ethics, philosophy of mind,\nmetaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of physics. Unfortunately,\nwhen we look more closely at the intuitive distinction, we find reason\nto suspect that it conflates a few related distinctions, and that each\nof these distinctions is somewhat resistant to analysis. \n\nThe standard way to introduce the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic properties is by the use of a few orientating\ncharacterisations. David Lewis provides the following list: \nA sentence or statement or proposition that ascribes intrinsic\nproperties to something is entirely about that thing; whereas an\nascription of extrinsic properties to something is not entirely about\nthat thing, though it may well be about some larger whole which\nincludes that thing as part. (Lewis 1983a: 197) \nA thing has its intrinsic properties in virtue of the way that thing\nitself, and nothing else, is. Not so for extrinsic properties, though\na thing may well have these in virtue of the way some larger whole is\n… (Lewis 1983a: 197) \nIf something has an intrinsic property, then so does any perfect\nduplicate of that thing; whereas duplicates situated in different\nsurroundings will differ in their extrinsic properties. (Lewis 1983a:\n197) \nThe other way to introduce the subject matter is by providing examples\nof paradigmatic intrinsic and extrinsic properties. One half of this\ntask is easy: everyone agrees that being an uncle is extrinsic, as is\nbeing six metres from a rhododendron. The problem with using this\nmethod to introduce the distinction is that there is much less\nagreement about which properties are intrinsic. Lewis has in several\nplaces (1983a, 1986a, 1988) insisted that shape properties are\nintrinsic, but one could hold that an object’s shape depends on\nthe curvature of the space in which it is located at, and this might\nnot even be intrinsic to that space (Nerlich 1979), let alone the\nobject (see also Bricker 1993 and Skow 2007). Lewis also mentions\ncharge and internal structure as being examples of intrinsic\nproperties. (For ease of exposition, we will assume below that shape\nproperties are intrinsic. We will also assume that properties like\nbeing made of tin, and having a mass of 500kg are intrinsic.) \nThe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties plays an\nessential role in stating several interesting philosophical problems.\nHistorically, the most prominent of these has to do with notions of\nintrinsic value. G. E. Moore (1903: §18) noted that we can make a\ndistinction between things that are good in themselves, or possess\nintrinsic value, and those that are good as a means to other things.\nTo this day there is still much debate over whether this distinction\ncan be sustained (Feldman 1998, Kagan 1998), and, if it can, which\nkinds of things possess intrinsic value (Krebs 1999). In particular,\none of the central topics in contemporary environmental ethics is the\nquestion of which kinds of things (intelligent beings, conscious\nbeings, living things, species, etc) might have intrinsic value. While\nthis is the oldest (and still most common) use of the\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction in philosophy, it has not played much\nrole in the discussions of the distinction in metaphysics, to which we\nnow turn. \nAs P. T. Geach (1969) noted, the fact that some object \\(a\\) is\nnot \\(F\\) before an event occurs but is \\(F\\) after that\nevent occurs does not mean that the event constitutes, in any deep\nsense, a change in \\(a\\). To use a well-worn example, at the time\nof Socrates’s death Xanthippe became a widow; that is, she was\nnot a widow before the event of her husband’s death, but she was\na widow when it ended. Still, though that event constituted (or\nperhaps was constituted by) a change in Socrates, it did not in itself\nconstitute a change in Xanthippe. Geach noted that we can distinguish\nbetween real changes, such as what occurs in Socrates when he dies,\nfrom mere changes in which predicates one satisfies, such as what\noccurs in Xanthippe when Socrates dies. The latter he termed\n‘mere Cambridge’ change. There is something of a consensus\nthat an object undergoes real change in an event iff there is some\nintrinsic property it satisfied before the event but\nnot afterwards. \nDavid Lewis (1986a, 1988) built on this point of Geach’s to\nmount an attack on endurantism, the theory that\nobjects persist by being wholly located at different times, and that\nthere can be strict identity between an object existing at one time\nand one existing at another time. Lewis argues that this is\ninconsistent with the idea that objects undergo real change. If the\nvery same object can be both \\(F\\) (at one time) and not\n\\(F\\) (at another), this means that \\(F\\)-ness must be a\nrelation to a time, but this means that it is not an intrinsic\nproperty. So any property that an object can change must be extrinsic,\nso nothing undergoes real change. Lewis says that this argument\nsupports the rival theory of perdurantism, which says\nthat objects persist by having different temporal parts at different\ntimes. While this argument is controversial (see Haslanger (1989),\nJohnston (1987) and Lowe (1988) for some responses), it does show how\nconsiderations about intrinsicality can resonate within quite\ndifferent areas of metaphysics. \nA third major area where the concept of intrinsicality has been put to\nwork is in stating various supervenience theses. Frank Jackson (1998)\ndefines physicalism in terms of duplication and physical duplication,\nwhich are in turn defined in terms of intrinsic properties. Similarly,\nJaegwon Kim (1982) defines a mind/body supervenience thesis in terms\nof intrinsic properties. As Theodore Sider (1993) notes, the simplest\nway to define the individualist theory of mental\ncontent that Tyler Burge (1979) attacks is as the claim that the\ncontent of a thinker’s propositional attitudes supervenes on the\nintrinsic properties of the thinker. And many\ninternalist theories in epistemology are based around\nthe intuition that whether a thinker is justified in believing some\nproposition supervenes on the intrinsic properties of the thinker. \nA fourth area where the concept of intrinsically has been employed is\nto state recombination principles intended to describe what possible\nstates of the world there are. (See Lewis 1986a.) An initial attempt\nto state such a principle might be (R1), where \\(x\\) is wholly\ndistinct from \\(y\\) iff \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have no parts in\ncommon. (As is standard in philosophical usage, each thing is counted\nas a part of itself. Hence, things are not wholly distinct from\nthemselves.)  \nGiven an abundant theory of properties according to which each\n(non-defective) predicate expresses a property, however, (R1) clearly\nfails, since it isn’t possible for there to be an \\(x\\) and a\n\\(y\\) such that \\(x\\) has the property of being made of gold,\nand \\(y\\) has the property of being such that nothing is made of\ngold. This defect with (R1) can be fixed by replacing (R1) with\n(R2). \nWhile being made of gold and being such that nothing is made of gold\nrefutes (R1), they don’t refute (R2), since being such that\nnothing is made of gold is clearly non-intrinsic. \nMost of the philosophical applications of intrinsicality are\nindependent of its precise analysis. Work on its analysis, however,\nhas helped clarify these applications by allowing us to distinguish\nbetween different notions of intrinscality and different notions in\nthe vicinity of intrinsicality, and by giving us a greater\nunderstanding of these various notions and of what properties satisfy\nthem. A good example of the latter kind of advance is Theodore\nSider’s (2003) observation that most of the properties in folk\ntheory are ‘maximal’ and hence not intrinsic properties.\nThis observation provides a strong argument against various theories\nthat appeal to the intuitive intrinsicality of some everyday\nproperty. \nThough these are the most prominent uses of the intrinsic/extrinsic\ndistinction in philosophy, they by no means exhaust its uses. Many\napplications of the distinction are cited by I. L. Humberstone (1996),\nincluding the following: George Schlesinger (1990) uses the\ndistinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties to state a\nnon-trivial version of Mill’s principle of the uniformity of\nnature. Wlodzimierz Rabinowicz (1979) uses the distinction to\nformulate principles of universalizability for moral principles and\nnatural laws. And E. J. Khamara (1988) uses a distinction between\nrelational and non-relational properties to state a non-trivial\nversion of the principle of Identity of Indiscernibles. \nIn addition to the “global” concept of a property being\nintrinsic, there is a “local” concept of something having\na property in an intrinsic fashion (see Humberstone 1996, p. 206). For\neach of Lewis’s characterisations concerning the concept of an\nintrinsic property quoted in section\n 1.1,\n there is a corresponding characterisation for the concept of a thing\nhaving a property in an intrinsic fashion. These are: \nIt follows from at least the third of these characterisations that\nsomething can have an extrinsic property in an intrinsic fashion. For\nexample, since every duplicate of a piece of tin has the property of\nbeing made of tin, every duplicate of a piece of tin also has the\nextrinsic property of being either made of tin or married. As a\nresult, it follows from the third characterisation that each piece of\ntin has the property of being either made of tin or married in an\nintrinsic fashion, despite this property being extrinsic.  \nTwo plausible principles linking the local and global concepts of\nintrinsicality are (GTL) and (LTG) (see Humberstone 1996, p. 228). \nIn addition to the two-place predicate ‘has … in an\nintrinsic fashion’, we can introduce a modifier\n‘intrinsically’, where, adapting one of the\ncharacterisations above, \\(x\\) is intrinsically \\(F\\) iff\n\\(x\\) is \\(F\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) itself, and nothing\nelse, is. (cf. Humberstone 1996, p. 228). This modifier takes\npredicates as arguments rather than names of properties or variables\nranging over properties. Nominalists, who don’t believe in\nproperties, might attempt to use this modifier to capture the\nintuitive distinctions associated with intrinsicality without\ncommitting themselves to properties. For example, a nominalist might\nclaim that a table is intrinsically rectangular, while claiming to\nconsistently hold that there is no property of being rectangular. (For\nsimplicity, we will assume in the following that nominalism is false\nand that there are abundantly many properties and relations, some of\nwhich are intrinsic and some of which are extrinsic.) \nThere might be further reasons to employ either the two place\npredicate ‘has … in an intrinsic fashion’, or the\nmodifier ‘intrinsically’, rather than the one-place\npredicate ‘is intrinsic’. For example, one might think\nthat at least one of the former two notions is more fundamental than\nthe latter notion, or that the latter notion is misguided in some way\nthat at least one of the former notions isn’t. (See, for\nexample, Figdor 2008.) \nWhile this article focuses on the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic one-place properties, it is important to recognize that the\ndistinction between intrinsic and extrinsic also applies to multiple\nplace relations. As in the case of one-place properties, the\ndistinction between intrinsic and extrinsic multiple place relations\ncan be introduced by characterisations and examples. One\ncharacterisation is the following: \nExamples of extrinsic two-place relations include being as popular\nas, and having the same cousin as. Possible examples of\nintrinsic two-place relations include being 1 m away from and\nbeing made of the same type of metal as. (The claim that\ndistance relations like being 1 m away from are intrinsic\nwill be denied by philosophers who deny that shape properties are\nintrinsic.)  \nAs well as the global notion of an \\(n\\)-place relation being\nintrinsic, there is the local notion of \\(n\\) things standing in\na relation in an intrinsic fashion. A characterisation of this local\nnotion is: \nA number of different distinctions have been called the\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction. As J. Michael Dunn (1990) notes, some\nauthors have used ‘intrinsic’ and ‘extrinsic’\nto mean ‘essential’ and ‘accidental’. Dunn is\nsurely right in saying that this is a misuse of the terms. A more\ninteresting distinction is noted by Brian Ellis (1991; discussed in\nHumberstone 1996: 206). (See also Figdor 2008 and Figdor 2014 for a\ndiscussion of a related notion of intrinsicality.) Ellis suggests we\nshould distinguish between properties that objects have independently\nof any outside forces acting on them (what we will call the\nEllis-intrinsic properties), and those that they have in virtue of\nthose outside forces (the Ellis-extrinsic properties). For many\nobjects (such as, say, a stretched rubber band) their shape will be\ndependent on the outside forces acting on them, so their shape will be\nEllis-extrinsic. If one is committed to the idea that shapes are\nintrinsic, one should think this means that the distinction between\nthe Ellis-intrinsic and Ellis-extrinsic properties is not the same as\nthe intrinsic/extrinsic distinction. Such a judgement may seem a\nlittle hasty, but in any case we will turn now to distinctions that\nhave received more attention in the philosophical literature. \nMany writers, especially in the literature on intrinsic value, use\n‘relational’ for the opposite of intrinsic. This seems to\nbe a mistake since many properties seem to be both be relational and\nintrinsic. For example, most people have the property having\nlonger legs than arms, and indeed seem to have this property in\nan intrinsic fashion, even though the property consists in a certain\nrelation being satisfied. Maybe the property is not intrinsic if\nwhether or not something is an arm or a leg is extrinsic, so perhaps\nthis isn’t a conclusive example, but it seems troubling. And, in\nany case, there are other examples that can’t be responded to in\nthis way. For example, the property of having a proper part is surely\nintrinsic, but it also appears to be a relational property. \nAs Humberstone 1996 notes, some might respond by suggesting that a\nrelational property is one such that if an object has it, then it\nbears some relation to a non-part of it. But this won’t do\neither. Not being within a mile of a rhododendron is clearly\nrelational, but does not consist in bearing a relation to any\nnon-part, as we can see by the fact that a non-rhododendron all alone\nin a world can satisfy it.  \nA further response might be to say that a relational property should\nbe a property that involves a relation that can only relate wholly\ndistinct things, and that, given this construal of a relational\nproperty, non-intrinsic properties are relational properties. However,\nthis response faces difficulties also. For example, this account would\npresumably classify the property of being such that there is a cube as\nbeing intrinsic. This property, however, is not intrinsic.  \nWhile the notion of a relational property should be distinguished from\nthe notion of a non-intrinsic property, it might be that the notion of\nintrinsic properties can be given an account in terms of\nrelationality. One such account due to Francesscotti is discussed in\nthe supplement: \nWe now turn to the notion of intrinsicality characterised by the\ncharacterisations listed in section\n 1.\n Or perhaps better, we now turn to the notions of\nintrinsicality characterised by these characterisations, since, while\nLewis thought that each of these characterisations characterise a\nsingle notion of intrinsically, it is plausible that they characterise\ndifferent notions. In this subsection, we will discuss the notion\ncharacterised by the first characterisation which involves aboutness.\nIn the next two subsections, we will discuss the notions characterised\nby the other two characterisations. \nLewis’s first characterisation is: \nAs Marshall 2016a points out, the notion of aboutness employed in this\ncharacterisation is plausibly that of intrinsic aboutness,\nwhere intrinsic aboutness can be intuitively characterised by (1). \nUsing the notion of intrinsic aboutness, Lewis’s first\ncharacterisation can be more precisely stated by the schema (2). \nFor any predicate \\(F\\) expressing a property \\(p\\), and any\nname \\(n\\) referring to an \\(x\\), define the ascription of\n\\(p\\) to \\(x\\) to be the state of affairs expressed by\n\\(\\ulcorner Fn\\urcorner\\). Using this definition, we can replace the\nschema (2) with the sentence (3). \n(3) plausibly classifies being a cube as intrinsic, since,\nfor any \\(x\\), the state of affairs of \\(x\\) being a cube\nplausibly describes how \\(x\\) and its parts are and how they are\nrelated to each other, as opposed to how they are related to other\nthings and how other things are. In contrast, (3) plausibly classifies\nbeing an uncle as non-intrinsic, since its ascription to a\nthing is not only about how it and its parts are and how they are\nrelated to each other, but also about how it is related to things\noutside of it. (3) also plausibly classifies being Obama as\nnon-intrinsic since the ascription of being Obama to Clinton, namely\nthe state of affairs of Obama being identical to Clinton, is not\nwholly about Clinton, but is also about Obama. Finally, (3) also\nappears to classify being such that there is a number as\nnon-intrinsic, even if it is necessary that there are numbers. This is\nbecause the ascription of this property to Clinton, namely the state\nof affairs that Clinton is such that there is a number, appears to be\nnot wholly about how Clinton is, but is also about how things wholly\ndistinct from Clinton are. (We will assume that the intuition\nunderlying this judgement is correct. However, this is not\nuncontroversial. See Sider 1996 for a rejection of a closely related\nintuition and Eddon 2011 for a reply to this rejection.)  \nIn the following, we will call the properties classified as intrinsic\nby (3) local properties, and call the properties classified\nby (3) as not intrinsic non-local properties. (This notion of\na local property needs to be distinguished from the local conception\nof something having a property in an intrinsic fashion discussed in\nsection\n 1.2.) \nThe second characterisation listed in the quote by Lewis in section\n 1\n was “A thing has its intrinsic properties in virtue of the way\nthat thing itself, and nothing else, is”. \nCall the properties that are classified as intrinsic by (4)\ninterior properties, and call the properties that are\nclassified as non-intrinsic by (4) exterior properties. An\nimportant question is what meaning ‘in virtue’ is meant to\nhave in (4). One possible answer is that it is meant to have a reading\ncorresponding to metaphysical grounding, where metaphysical grounding\nis a non-causal explanatory relation on states of affairs, such that,\nif one state of affairs metaphysically grounds another state of\naffairs then it metaphysically necessitates it. Under such a reading\nof ‘in virtue’, (5) is necessarily true.  \nWhile it might be initially appealing to think that ‘in\nvirtue’ in (4) expresses metaphysical grounding, Marshall (2015,\n2016a) has argued that (4) fails to characterise a notion of\nintrinsicality when ‘in virtue’ has this reading.\nMarshall’s argument relies on (6) being necessarily true and (7)\nbeing true on any notion of intrinsicality. \nMarshall’s argument is the following. Suppose, for reductio,\nthat (4) characterises a notion of intrinsicality when ‘in\nvirtue’ expresses metaphysical grounding. It follows from this,\nand the necessity of (5) and (6), that (8) is necessarily true. \nBy (7), it is possible for a sentence \\(\\ulcorner a\\) is\n\\(F\\urcorner\\) to express a foundational fact, where \\(F\\) expresses\nan intrinsic property. Hence, it follows from (7) and the necessity of\n(8) that (9) is possibly true. \nHowever, (9) is necessarily false, since foundational facts cannot be\nmetaphysically grounded by any facts. Hence, the assumption that (4)\ncharacterises a notion of intrinsicality when ‘in virtue’\nexpresses metaphysical grounding is false. \nGiven ‘in virtue’ doesn’t express metaphysical\ngrounding in (4) on its intended use, what does it express? One\nattractive option is to think that ‘in virtue’ in (4) is\nmeant to be understood as having the same effect as ‘is a matter\nof’ and that, on this reading, it expresses the identity\nrelation. On this reading, ‘\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of it being\nthe case that \\(\\psi\\)’ is true iff the state of affairs\nexpressed by \\(\\phi\\) is identical to the state of affairs expressed\nby \\(\\varphi\\). Since it follows from (6) that, on this reading\n‘\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\) is intrinsically’\nis true iff there is a sentence \\(\\phi\\) that expresses a true state\nof affairs that is intrinsically about \\(x\\), (10) follows from (4)\non this reading of ‘in virtue’.  \nAn alternative option, which is investigated in Marshall 2016a, is to\nhold that ‘in virtue’ may express a number of different\nreflexive determination, or entailment, relations in (4), and that\neach of these relations determines a different notion of\nintrinsicality. In addition to identity, such entailment relations\nmight include metaphysical necessitation, nomic necessitation, and\nweak metaphysical grounding, where \\(p\\) weakly metaphysically\ngrounds \\(q\\) iff either \\(p=q\\) or \\(p\\) metaphysically\ngrounds \\(q\\). Given these relations determine different notions of\nintrinsicality for each relation \\(R\\), we may call the notion of\ninteriority corresponding to \\(R\\) ‘\\(R\\)\ninteriority’. So, for example, the notion of intrinsicality\nobtained from (4) by interpreting ‘in virtue’ as\nexpressing the identity relation might be called identity interiority,\nwhile the notion of interiority obtained from metaphysical\nnecessitation might be called metaphysical necessitation interiority,\nand the notion of interiority obtained from nomic necessitation might\nbe called nomic necessitation interiority. (Marshall uses a different\nterminology, calling the \\(R\\) interior properties the possession\nintrinsic properties.) \nIf ‘in virtue’ expresses the relation \\(R\\), then\n‘\\(\\varphi\\) in virtue of it being the case that \\(\\phi\\)’\nis true iff the state of affairs of it being the case that \\(\\phi\\)\nstands in \\(R\\) to the state of affairs of it being the case the\n\\(\\varphi\\). As Marshall notes, it follows from this, (4) and (6) that\nthe \\(R\\) interior properties satisfy (11). \nJust as being cubical is intuitively a local property, while being an\nuncle and being such that there is a number are intuitively non-local\nproperties, the former property is intuitively an identity interiority\nproperty, while the latter properties are both intuitively not\nidentity interior. (Those that claim that being such that there is a\nnumber is a local property, however, are likely to also claim that\nthis property is identity interior. See, for example, Sider (1993a),\nEddon (2011), Vallentyne (1997) and Francescotti (2014) for the\nrelevant debate.) The identity interior properties, however, plausibly\ndo not coincide with the local properties, since, while being\nidentical to Obama is not a local property, it is plausibly an\nidentity interior property. This is because, necessarily, for any\n\\(x\\) that is identical to Obama, the state of affairs of \\(x\\)\nbeing identical to Obama is plausibly about how \\(x\\) and its parts\nare and how they are related to each other, as opposed to how they are\nrelated to other things and how other things are. \nSince each identity interior property is also an \\(R\\) interior\nproperty, for each reflexive relation \\(R\\), the \\(R\\) interior\nproperties also do not coincide with the local properties for each\n\\(R\\). The \\(R\\) interior properties also differ from the\nidentity interior properties for at least some \\(R\\). For example,\nthe metaphysical necessitation interior properties plausibly differ\nfrom the identity interior properties since, while being such that\nthere is a number is plausibly not identity interior, it is\nmetaphysical necessitation interior. This is because, given the\nassumption that numbers necessarily exist, any \\(x\\) is such that\nhow it is intrinsically necessitates that \\(x\\) is such that there\nis a number. \nThe third characterisation Lewis lists when isolating the concept of\nintrinsicality is that duplicates never differ with respect to their\nintrinsic properties. Lewis holds a further principle that may not be\nobvious from the above quote: that any property with respect to which\nduplicates never differ is intrinsic. Adding this further principle to\nthe characterisation gives us (12). \n(12), however, has the following problem. Assume that no man has a\nmass of 500 kg (although it is possible for a man to have a mass of\n500 kg). Since nothing has the property of being a popular man who is\n500 kg, given this assumption, no two duplicates differ in whether\nthey have this property. (12) therefore falsely classifies being a\npopular man who is 500 kg as intrinsic. \nDavid Lewis doesn’t face this problem due to his concretist\ntheory of possible worlds. Lewis holds that, in addition to the world\nwe live in, there are many other concrete worlds of the same kind as\nthe world we live in. Moreover, he holds that contained in some of\nthese worlds are 500 kg duplicate men, some of whom are popular, and\nsome of whom are not. Given Lewis’s concretist theory of\npossible worlds, then, being a popular man who is 500 kg is classified\nas extrinsic by (12). \nPhilosophers who instead endorse standard abstractionist theories of\npossible worlds, however, can’t accept (12). According to\nstandard abstractionist theories of possible worlds, possible worlds\ndo not contain concrete entities such as 500 kg men as parts.\nAccording to standard abstractionists, then, there are no 500 kg men,\nthere are only possible worlds that represent that there are 500 kg\nmen. Philosophers who endorse standard abstractionist theories of\npossible worlds, however, can replace (12) with (13) (see Moore 1922\nand Francescotti 1999). (Or at least, they can replace (12) with (13)\ngiven they hold that there are things that exist according to\nnon-actual possible worlds that don’t exist according to the\nactual world. Abstractionists who deny this will have to further\nmodify (13).) \nGiven a standard abstractionist theory of possible worlds, there is a\npossible world \\(u\\) that represents there being a popular 500 kg\nman \\(x\\), and there is another possible world \\(v\\) that\nrepresents there being an unpopular 500 kg man \\(y\\), where\n\\(x\\) at \\(u\\) has the same intrinsic properties as \\(y\\) at\n\\(v\\), and hence \\(x\\) at \\(u\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) at\n\\(v\\). Given this, (13) classifies being a popular man who is\n500 kg as extrinsic. \nPutting aside for the moment the question of whether (13) correctly\ncharacterises a genuine notion of intrinsicality, let us call the\nnotion it does characterise duplication preservation. (13), understood\nas a characterisation of duplication preservation has two important\nconsequences. First, it has the consequence that identity properties,\nsuch as being Obama, aren’t duplication preserving. The reason\nfor this is that, since Obama could have had a duplicate distinct from\nhimself, there is a possible world at which Obama has a duplicate who\nis not Obama, and hence there is a possible world at which something\nhaving the property of being Obama has a duplicate which lacks this\nproperty.  \nA more general consequence can be stated using the distinction between\nqualitative and non-qualitative properties, where a qualitative\nproperty is intuitively a property that doesn’t concern any\nparticular entities, while a non-qualitative property is a property\nthat does concern one or more particular entities. Examples of\nqualitative properties include the property of being cubical and the\nproperty of being next to a tin, while examples of non-qualitative\nproperties include the property of being Obama and the property of\nbeing next to Clinton. It plausibly follows from (13), understood as a\ncharacterisation of duplication preservation, that any non-qualitative\nproperty that is possibly instantiated is not a duplication preserving\nproperty. \nSay that a property is indiscriminately necessary iff it is\nnecessarily had by everything. The second consequence of (13),\nunderstood as a characterisation of duplication preservation, is that\nany two properties that are indiscriminately necessary are duplication\npreserving. Consider, for example, the indiscriminately necessary\nproperty of being such that there is a number (where we are assuming\nthat numbers necessarily exist). Since all things at all possible\nworlds have this property, it is a duplication preserving\nproperty. \nSince being such that there is a number is neither a local property or\nan identity interior property, but is a duplication preserving\nproperty (given numbers necessarily exist), the duplication preserving\nproperties do not coincide with either the local properties or the\nidentity interior properties. Since being Obama is a metaphysical\nnecessitation interior property, but is not a duplication preserving\nproperty, the duplication preserving properties don’t coincide\nwith the metaphysical necessitation interior properties either. (Moore\n(1922) and Dunn (1990), in effect, both distinguish duplication\npreservation from interiority on these grounds.) Hence, we have at\nleast four distinct kinds of properties that are characterised by\nLewis’s three characterisations: local properties, identity\ninterior properties, metaphysical necessitation interior properties,\nand duplication preserving properties. \nIf Lewis’s three characterisations concerning intrinsicality\ncharacterise different notions, the three characterisations described\nin section\n 1.2\n concerning having a property in an intrinsic fashion also\ncharacterise different notions. In order to distinguish these notions,\nwe may employ these characterisations to define having a property in a\nduplication preserving fashion, having a property in an interior\nfashion (relative to different entailment relations), and having a\nproperty in a local fashion. \nIn the last three subsections, we distinguished a number of distinct\nnotions that are characterised by Lewis’s three\ncharacterisation: locality, duplication preservation, and several\ndifferent kinds of interiority. We now need to address the question of\nwhether there is a single notion of intrinsicality, and, if there is,\nwhich of these notions is it? More precisely, we need to determine\nwhether there is a single notion that philosophers typically use\n‘intrinsic’ to express, and, if so, which notion is\nit. \nOne might attempt to answer this question by first noting that it is\nmuch more common for philosophers to use Lewis’s second\n“in virtue” characterisation (or some variant of it), than\neither of the other two characterisations when explaining what they\nmean by ‘intrinsic’. (For example, as far as we know,\nLewis uses the “in virtue” characterisation whenever he\nexplains what he means by ‘intrinsic’, but only uses the\nother characterisations once.) This suggests that philosophers\ntypically use ‘intrinsic’ to express a notion of\ninteriority rather than either of the notions of locality or\nduplication preservation. \nGiven philosophers typically use ‘intrinsic’ to express\nsome notion of interiority, there are several reasons to think that\nthe notion of interiority they typically express is that of identity\ninteriority. First, identity interiority is more fundamental, or\nsimpler, than the other notions of interiority, and philosophers are\noften interested in employing more fundamental notions than less\nfundamental notions. Second, the intrinsic properties of a thing\nshould be the properties that thing has “in itself”,\nrather than merely the properties that are metaphysically\nnecessitated, or nomically necessitated, or metaphysically explained,\nby the properties the thing has “in itself”. But this\nsuggests that the intrinsic properties should be the identity interior\nproperties, rather than the metaphysical necessitation interior\nproperties, or the nomic necessitation interior properties, or the\nweak grounding interior properties. Finally, while the identity\ninteriority of necessarily coextensive properties can intuitively\ndiffer, this is not true for at least some of the other notions of\ninteriority, such as metaphysical necessitation interiority and nomic\nnecessitation interiority. Since it is a widespread intuition that\nnecessarily coextensive properties can differ in whether they are\nintrinsic, this suggests these other notions of interiority\naren’t what philosophers typically express by\n‘intrinsic’. (This last reason also provides a further\nreason to think that duplication preservation isn’t the notion\nof intrinsicality philosophers typically employ, since it also does\nnot differ among necessarily equivalent properties.) \nThere are therefore reasons to think that the notion philosophers\ntypically use ‘intrinsic’ to express is identity\ninteriority. These reasons, however, are not decisive. First,\nphilosophers often take intrinsic properties to be qualitative, and\nuse ‘intrinsic’ to distinguish only among qualitative\nproperties. (See Sider 1996.) Since each local property and each\nduplication preserving property is qualitative, but this is not true\nfor interior properties, this possibly suggests that at least some\nphilosophers at least some of the time use ‘intrinsic’ to\nexpress either locality or duplication preservation. Secondly, while\nidentity interiority can do much of the theoretical work\nintrinsicality is meant to do, it arguably cannot do all of it, with\nsome of this work being better done by some of the other notions of\nintrinsicality described above. For example, Sider (1996) and Marshall\n(2016a) have both argued that notions of intrinsicality other than\nidentity interiority are better able to be used to define\nindividualism about mental states, with Sider arguing that duplication\npreservation is the notion better placed to do this job, while\nMarshall arguing that the better placed notion is nomic necessitation\ninteriority. Finally, the failure of many philosophers to clearly\ndistinguish which notion of intrinsicality they are employing provides\nat least some reason to suspect that those philosophers have often\nused ‘intrinsic’ indeterminately to express a multiplicity\nof notions of intrinsicality. \nIn the next section, we will consider a number of attempts to analyse\n‘intrinsic’. Unless otherwise made clear, we will use\n‘intrinsic’ to express identity interiority, and we will\nassume that identity interiority is the most dominant notion of\nintrinsicality among philosophers. As we will see, however, a number\nof these attempts are most charitably seen as attempts to analyse\nnotions of intrinsicality other than identity interiority. \nWe will look at several attempts to analyse the distinction between\nintrinsic and extrinsic properties. One reason to attempt such an\nanalysis is that the orientating characterisations of intrinsicality\ndiscussed in section\n 1\n and sections\n 2.2\n –\n 2.4\n are all to some degree circular. (Cf Lewis 1983a and Yablo 1999.) For\nexample, a property \\(p\\) whose ascription to a thing \\(x\\) is\nabout \\(x\\) is intrinsic only if it is about how \\(x\\) is\nintrinsically; \\(p\\) is not intrinsic if the ascription of\n\\(p\\) to \\(x\\) is about how \\(x\\) is extrinsically.\nSimilarly, a property \\(p\\) that is had by \\(x\\) in virtue of\nhow \\(x\\) is is intrinsic only if \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) in virtue\nof how \\(x\\) is intrinsically; \\(p\\) need not be\nintrinsic if \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) in virtue of how \\(x\\)\nis extrinsically. \nSome of the following attempts to analyse intrinsicality are best seen\nas attempts to analyse the distinction between duplication preserving\nand duplication non-preserving properties, while others are best seen\nas attempts to analyse the distinction between interior and exterior\nproperties, or between local and non-local properties. (For a more\ndetailed discussion of a number of the attempted analyses below, see\nHoffmann-Kolss 2010a, Marshall 2012, and Marshall 2013. For a\ndiscussion of whether we need an analysis of intrinsicality, see\nSkiles 2014.) \nIt would be good if we could analyse intrinsicality using only broadly\nlogical notions, where broadly logical notions are exhausted by the\nnarrowly logical notions of conjunction, negation and existential\nquantification, the modal notion of metaphysical possibility, the\nmereological notion of parthood, and the basic notions associated with\nproperty theory and set theory, such as the notions expressed by\n‘state of affairs’, ‘property’,\n‘relation’, ‘possible world’,\n‘instantiates’, ‘is a member of’ and\n‘set’. (The locution ‘state of affairs’ is\nused differently by different philosophers. Here it is being used to\nrefer to the zero-place analogues of one-place properties and multiple\nplace relations. Just as a property is a way of a thing is or fails to\nbe, a state of affairs, under our usage, is a way things are or fail\nto be.) \nIt is at least initially appealing to think that, if an object has a\nproperty in an intrinsic fashion, then it has it independently of the\nway the rest of the world is. The rest of the world could disappear,\nand the object might still have that property. Hence a lonely\nobject, an object that doesn’t coexist with any contingent\nobjects wholly distinct from it, could have the property. Many\nextrinsic properties, on the other hand, cannot be possessed by lonely\nobjects – no lonely object has the property of being six metres\nfrom a rhododendron, for example. This suggests an analysis of\nintrinsicality: \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff it is possible\nfor a lonely object to be \\(F\\). This analysis is usually\nattributed to Kim (1982) (e.g. in  Lewis 1983a and Sider 1993),\nthough Humberstone (1996) dissents from this interpretation. If this\nanalysis is successful then it would constitute a broadly logical\nanalysis, since the expressions on the right hand side of the account\ncan each be defined using only broadly logical vocabulary. \nThe major problem with this analysis is that the ‘if’\ndirection of the biconditional is clearly false. As Lewis (1983)\npointed out, it is possible for a lonely object to have the property\nof being lonely, but the property of being lonely is not\nintrinsic. \nOne might try to deal with this problem by adding extra modal\nconditions to the above account. Say that a property \\(F\\) is\nindependent of accompaniment iff the following four\nconditions (taken from Langton and Lewis 1998) are met: \nAt first glance, if \\(F\\) is intrinsic, then whether or not an\nobject has \\(F\\) should not depend on whether it is lonely. If this\nis right, then all four of these conditions should be satisfied. We\nmight therefore try to give the following broadly logical analysis:\n\\(F\\) is intrinsic iff \\(F\\) is independent of\naccompaniment. \nAs Langton and Lewis (1998) point out, however, this strengthened\nanalysis still fails (see also Lewis 1983a). Given intrinsic\nproperties, such as being a cube, are independent of accompaniment,\nthe extrinsic property of being either a lonely cube or an accompanied\nnon-cube is also independent of accompaniment. Hence, provided the\nstrengthened analysis correctly classifies being a cube as\nintrinsic, it will falsely classify being either a lonely cube or\nan accompanied non-cube as intrinsic. \nIn the face of this failure, we might still hope that a yet more\nsophisticated broadly logical analysis might succeed. An argument due\nto Marshall and Parsons, however, shows that, given standard views\nabout what is possible, and given the absence of special assumptions\nabout the abundance and structure of properties, no such analysis can\nbe given. Marshall and Parsons consider the intrinsic property of\nbeing an electron and the extrinsic property of being either an\naccompanied electron or a lonely positron. They then show that, given\ncertain common views about properties and possibility, these\nproperties have the same pattern of instantiation through logical,\nmereological and set-theoretic space. Since formulas containing only\nbroadly logical expressions cannot distinguish between properties\nhaving the same such pattern, it then follows that no broadly logical\nanalysis of intrinsically is possible. (This argument was developed\njointly by Marshall and Parsons, and then presented briefly in Parsons\n2001 and in more depth in Marshall 2009.)  \nTo give more of an idea of how this argument works, suppose for\nsimplicity that there are only three possible worlds, \\(w_1\\), \\(w_2\\)\nand \\(w_3\\), and only four possible individuals \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\),\n\\(x_3\\) and \\(x_4\\), and that  \nAt \\(w_1\\), \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are the only things that exist,\n\\(x_1\\) is an electron and \\(x_2\\) is a positron\n \nAt \\(w_2\\), \\(x_3\\) is the only thing that exists and \\(x_3\\) is\nan electron\n \nAt \\(w_3\\), \\(x_4\\) is the only thing that exists and \\(x_4\\) is a\npositron.\n \nNow assume a possible worlds theory of properties, according to\nwhich the property of being \\(F = \\{\\langle x, w\\rangle \\mid x \\text{ is } F \\text{ at } w\\}\\). Given this theory of\nproperties: \n\\(q_1\\) = Being an electron = \\(\\{\\langle x_1,\nw_1 \\rangle, \\langle x_3, w_2\\rangle\\}.\\)\n \n\\(q_2\\) = Being either an accompanied electron or a lonely\npositron = \\(\\{\\langle x_1, w_1\\rangle,\n\\langle x_4, w_3\\rangle\\}.\\)\n \nSuppose, for reductio, that the notion of an intrinsic property can be\nanalysed in terms of broadly logical notions. Then, since analyses\nmust be necessary, there is a formula \\(\\varphi(p)\\) such that (14) is\nnecessarily true, where \\(\\varphi\\) contains only broadly logical\nvocabulary, such as variables, brackets, ‘&’,\n‘\\(\\vee\\)’, ‘\\(\\exists\\)’, ‘is a\npossible world’, ‘at’ and ‘\\(\\in\\)’. \nSince \\(q_1\\) is necessarily intrinsic, while \\(q_2\\) is necessarily\nnot intrinsic, it follows from the necessity of (14) that\n\\(\\varphi(q_1)\\) is necessarily true, while \\(\\varphi(q_2)\\) is\nnecessarily false. In other words, if there is a broadly logical\nanalysis of intrinsicality, then there is a formula \\(\\varphi\\)\ncontining only broadly logical vocabulary that necessarily applies to\n\\(q_1\\), and necessarily does not apply to \\(q_2\\). However, it can be\nproved that there is no such formula. For example, while\n‘\\(\\exists w_1 \\exists w_2 \\exists x_1 \\exists x_2 \\exists\nx_3\\)(p \\(= \\{\\lt w_1, x_1\\gt ,\n\\lt w_2, x_3\\gt \\})\\)’\napplies to \\(q_1\\), it also applies to \\(q_2\\). Hence, the reductio\nassumption is false, and there is no broadly logical analysis of\nintrinsicality. This argument can easily be adapted to show that there\nis no broadly logical analysis of intrinsicality given more realistic\nassumptions about what possible worlds there are. \nIt is important to note that, despite this argument, one might still\nbe able to analyse intrinsicality in terms of broadly logical notions\nif one is prepared to make special (and controversial) assumptions\nabout properties. As an illustration of this, suppose one assumes that\nall intrinsic properties have no proper parts while all extrinsic\nproperties do have proper parts. Then one might give a broadly logical\nanalysis of intrinsicality by giving account (15). \nEven if an analysis like this one is true, however, its utility will\nbe limited. For example, unless we already know somehow which\nproperties have proper parts and which properties do not have proper\nparts, (15) will be useless in helping us to determine which\nproperties are intrinsic and which properties are non-intrinsic.  \nTwo more sophisticated attempts to give a broadly logical analysis of\nintrinsicality are Yablo’s contractionist account discussed in\nsection\n 3.4,\n and Francescotti’s relational account, which is discussed in\nthe supplementary document: \nBoth these accounts rely on controversial assumptions about properties\nor related entities such as possible worlds. \nGiven we cannot give a satisfactory account of intrinsicality using\nonly broadly logical notions, it is natural to investigate whether we\ncan give a satisfactory account using a larger set of notions. In the\nnext four subsections, we will consider whether intrinsicality can be\nanalysed in terms of the notions of perfect naturalness,\nnon-disjunctivity, possible world contractions, and metaphysical\ngrounding. \nThe most influential attempt to analyse intrinsicality over the last\n30 years has arguably been Lewis’s account of intrinsicality in\nterms of perfect naturalness. As Marshall 2012 explains, Lewis\nactually gave two importantly different accounts of intrinsicality in\nterms of perfect naturalness which philosophers often fail to\ndistinguish: the first in Lewis 1983b, and the second in Lewis 1986a.\nSince the later Lewis 1986a account has been much more influential\nthan the earlier Lewis 1983b account, we will restrict the following\ndiscussion to the later account. (For discussion of the earlier\naccount, see Marshall 2012.) \nThe perfectly natural properties and relations are the fundamental\nproperties and relations. Lewis wrote: \nSharing of [the perfectly natural properties] makes for qualitative\nsimilarity, they carve at the joints, they are intrinsic, they are\nhighly specific, the set of their instances are ipso facto not\nentirely miscellaneous, there are only just enough of them to\ncharacterise things completely and without redundancy. Physics has its\nshort list of ‘fundamental physical properties’: the\ncharges and masses of particles, also their is so-called\n‘spins’ and ‘colours’ and\n‘flavours’, and maybe a few more that have yet to be\ndiscovered. (Lewis 1986b, p. 60, author’s emphasis)] \nThe notion of a perfectly natural, or fundamental, property or\nrelation suggests an appealing approach to analysing intrinsicality.\nConsider the non-intrinsic property of being an uncle. It is appealing\nto think that the reason this property fails to be intrinsic is that\nit can be analysed in terms of more fundamental relations, such as\nbeing a sibling of and being a child of, in a manner that reveals how\nsomething being an uncle is at least partly a matter of how it is\nrelated to things that aren’t part of it. In particular, it is\nplausible to think that the reason being an uncle is non-intrinsic is\nthat for \\(x\\) to be an uncle is for \\(x\\) to have a sibling\nthat has a child, where this child fails to be part of \\(x\\). More\ngenerally, it is plausible that, if being \\(F\\) is a non-intrinsic\nproperty, then the fact that it is non-intrinsic can be revealed by\nanalysing being \\(F\\) in terms of more fundamental properties and\nrelations in a manner that reveals how something being \\(F\\) may\npartly be a matter of being related to a non-part or may be partly a\nmatter of how non-parts are. If this is true, then it has the\nfollowing two consequences. First, it follows that every fundamental\nproperty is intrinsic (since it being non-intrinsic cannot be revealed\nby analysis in terms of more fundamental properties and relations.\nSecondly, and even more importantly, it follows that whether a\nproperty is intrinsic should be analysable in terms of how that\nproperty can be analysed in terms of the fundamental properties and\nrelations.  \nLewis in effect adopts the above approach to analysing intrinsicality\nby analysing intrinsicality in terms of a particualr kind of\nsupervenience on the fundamental properties and relations.\nLewis’s 1986 account (formulated so as to be compatible with\nstandard abstractionist theories of possible worlds) consists of (16)\nand (17).  \nLewis’s account is best seen as an attempt at analysing\nduplication preservation, rather than identity interiority which we\nargued in section\n 2.5\n is the dominant notion of intrinsicality in philosophy. Lewis’s\naccount rests heavily on the claim that all perfectly natural\nproperties are intrinsic, and, implicitly, that the perfectly natural\nproperties and relations are sufficient to characterise the world\ncompletely. The last assumption is needed because the theory rules out\nthe possibility that there are two things having no proper parts that\nshare all their perfectly natural properties, but differ with respect\nto some of their intrinsic properties. \nThe first assumption that all perfectly natural properties are\nintrinsic has been rejected by Weatherson (2006). (See also Yablo 1999\nwho holds that, even if every perfectly natural property is intrinsic,\nthis fact is at best a lucky accident, and that this renders\nLewis’s account unsuccessful as a philosophical account of\nintrinsicality.) Weatherson claims that it is metaphysically possible\nfor the instantiated perfectly natural properties to be vector\nproperties. He then argues that, since vector properties must be\nextrinsic, it follows that at least some perfectly natural properties\nfail to be intrinsic, namely the perfectly natural properties\ninstantiated at such worlds. The claim that vector properties need to\nbe extrinsic, however, is highly contentious. It is natural to\nunderstand a vector property to be a property that is usefully\nrepresented for theoretical purposes by a certain kind of mathematical\nobject, namely a vector. Given this construal, however, there is no\nreason to think that vector properties cannot be intrinsic. For\nexample, due to the similarity relationships between colours\nrepresented by the colour solid it might be useful to represent\ncolours by vectors. However, doing this is compatible with\nmetaphysical theories of colour on which colours are intrinsic. There\nmight be other conceptions of being a vector property on which vector\nproperties cannot be intrinsic. However, it is unclear whether there\nan conception of vector properties on which they cannot be intrinsic,\nbut can be fundamental. (See Busse (2009) and Marshall (2016b) for\nmore discussion.) \nThe second assumption, that the perfectly natural properties and\nrelations are sufficient to characterise each possible world, has been\nrejected by Sider (1995) and Schaffer (2004). Both claim that it is\nmetaphysically possible for there to be endless sequences of more and\nmore natural properties, without any set of perfectly natural\nproperties out of which all the other properties can be defined. In\nresponse to this problem, Sider (1993b) has proposed a modification of\nLewis’s account which he claims is consistent with there being\nsuch endless sequences of more and more natural properties. Sider\n(2011) and Marshall (2016b) have recently argued in favour of the\nsecond assumption, with Sider’s argument appealing to his Humean\ntheory of metaphysical possibility. \nAs noted above, Lewis’s account fails to provide an account of\nthe standard notion of intrinsicality (which is identity interiority),\nand at best provides an analysis of duplication preservation. Marshall\nhas recently provided an account in terms of perfect naturalness that,\nif successful, instead provides an analysis of identity interiority.\nIf Marshall’s account works, then it can also be modified to\nprovide successful analyses of the other notions of intrinsicality\ndescribed in section\n 2.4. \nThe basic idea behind Marshall’s account is that the ascription\nof a property to a thing is intrinsically about that thing iff the\nascription can be expressed in fundamental terms while only referring\nto, and quantifying over, the parts of \\(x\\). More formally, the\naccount first analyses intrinsicality in terms of intrinsic aboutness\nby (3), and then provides an account of intrinsic aboutness in terms\nof perfect naturalness by (18). (In (18), perfectly natural operators\nand quantifiers are fundamental operators and quantifiers.) \n(18), as it stands, fails to provide a completely specified account of\nintrinsic aboutness, since it contains the locution ‘quantifies\nonly over parts of \\(x\\)’ which needs to be defined, and it\nis not straightforward to give the needed definition of this locution.\nMarshall’s account of ‘quantifying over parts of\n\\(x\\)’ can be simplified if we assume mereological essentialism\nand the view that ‘some’ is the only perfectly natural\nquantifier. (Mereological essentialism is the view that necessarily,\nfor any \\(x\\), necessarily, for any \\(y\\), if \\(y\\) is part\nof \\(x\\), then necessarily if \\(x\\) exists, then \\(y\\) is\npart of \\(x\\).) Given the simplifying assumption of mereological\nessentialism, Marshall endorses (19), where \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are\npredicates expressing properties and ‘\\(\\leq\\)’ symbolises\n‘is part of’. \nMore generally, Marshall endorses (20). \nGiven the simplifying assumption that ‘some’ is the only\nperfectly natural quantifier expression, (3), (18) and (20) provide a\ncomplete account of the notion of an intrinsic property. \nAs with Lewis’s original account, Marshall’s account\nassumes that each perfectly natural property is intrinsic and that the\nperfectly natural properties and relations are able to completely\ndescribe every possible world. If someone rejects these assumptions,\nthey will therefore be unable to endorse this account. \nInstead of analysing intrinsicality in terms of perfect naturalness,\none might try to analyse it in terms of non-disjunctivity, where\nnon-disjunctivity is regarded as an objective metaphysical feature of\nproperties rather than merely a syntactical feature of predicates. The\nmost prominent attempt to do this is the account of Langton and Lewis\n1998. (A similar theory is in an appendix to Zimmerman 1997.)  \nLangton and Lewis’s account involves the following three steps.\nFirst, they analyse the non-disjunctive properties as follows: \nSecondly, they say a property is basic intrinsic iff it is\nnon-disjunctive and independent of accompaniment. Finally, they say\nthat (i) two objects are duplicates iff they share the same basic\nintrinsic properties, and (ii) \\(F\\) is an intrinsic property iff\ntwo duplicates never differ with respect to it. \nThe last step of their account is in a form that requires\nLewis’s concretist theory of possible worlds. The last step in a\nform suitable for a typical abstractionist theory of possible worlds\nis instead: \nNote that (ii) is just the abstractionist version of the duplication\ncharacterisation for intrinsicality given by (13) in section\n 2.4. \nLangton and Lewis claim their account works given a variety of ways of\nunderstanding ‘natural’ and ‘more natural\nthan’ in their analysis of ‘non-disjunctive’. In\nparticular, they hold that the account will work if\n‘natural’ is understood to express the notion of perfect\nnaturalness, or fundamentality, in the Lewis (1986a) account, and\n‘more natural than’ is understood to mean ‘is more\nfundamental than’. They also claim that the account will work if\nthe natural properties are those taken to correspond to Armstrongian\nuniversals, or the properties expressed by the predicates in canonical\nformulations of physics, or the properties expressed by the predicates\nin canonical formulations of common-sense. Langton and Lewis say that\nit should not matter how we draw the distinction between natural and\nnon-natural properties for present purposes, as long as we have it,\nand properties like being lonely and round or accompanied and\ncubical are not natural. As a result of this, Langton and Lewis\nthink that their account is more neutral than Lewis’s earlier\naccount and should therefore should appeal to a larger range of\nphilosophers than the earlier account. \nLangton and Lewis put forward their account as only an analysis of\nqualitative intrinsic properties, rather than intrinsic properties in\ngeneral. Their account, however, arguably fails as an account of\nqualitative identity interior properties since, given numbers\nnecessarily exist, it classifies being such that there is a number as\nintrinsic. Therefore, like the Lewis 1986a account, the Langton and\nLewis account is arguably most charitably interpreted as an account of\nduplication preservation, or perhaps of qualitative metaphysical\nnecessitation interiority. \nIn addition to failing to give an account of the standard notion of\nintrinsicality, there are reasons to think that Langton and Lewis\ncannot be as neutral as they claim with respect to what account of\nnaturalness is combined with their account. As noted above, Langton\nand Lewis claim that their account of intrinsicality is compatible\nwith any construal of naturalness on which the natural properties are\nthose that play a special role in our thinking. On one such conception\nof naturalness, the natural properties include those properties for\nwhich we have simple words or concepts, which do not strike us as\nstrange or odd, and on which we have relied in past inductions (Sider\n2001: 362). Given this conception of naturalness, the property of\nbeing a rock is a natural property, and hence is classified as\nintrinsic on the Langton and Lewis account. However, as Sider 2001\nargues, being a rock is plausibly not an intrinsic property. Just as\nan object that is qualitatively intrinsically the same as a house and\nis a large part of a house is not itself a house, an object that is\nqualitatively intrinsically the same as a rock and is a large part of\na rock is not itself a rock. Hence, whether something is a rock is\npartly a matter of what is the case outside of it. Hence, contra the\ncombination of the Langton and Lewis account with the above conception\nof naturalness, being a rock is not intrinsic.  \nAnother objection to the Langton and Lewis account is that there\nappear to be counterexamples to the account, even given Lewis’s\nfavoured conception of naturalness. On this conception, the perfectly\nnatural properties and relations are the fundamental properties and\nrelations, and a property \\(p\\) is more natural than a property\n\\(q\\) iff the shortest definition of \\(p\\) in terms of the\nperfectly natural properties and relations is shorter than the\nshortest definition of \\(q\\) in terms of the perfectly natural\nproperties and relations. (See (Lewis 1986: 61).) As Marshall and\nParsons 2001 argue, given this construal of naturalness, the property\nof being such that there is a cube appears to be neither a disjuntive\nproperty nor the negation of a disjunctive property according to\nLangton and Lewis’s account of disjunctivity. If this is the\ncase, however, then, since being such that there is a cube is\nindependent of accompaniment, the Langton and Lewis account classifies\nthis property as a basic intrinsic property, and hence classifies it\nas an intrinsic property. This property, however, is clearly not\nintrinsic. \nLangton and Lewis 2001 have responded to this objection by claiming\nthat being such that there is a cube is less natural than both being a\ncube and being accompanied by a cube, since (I) being such that there\nis a cube can be expressed as the disjunction ‘being either a cube\nor accompanied by a cube’, (II) disjoining unrelated properties\nalways reduces naturalness, and (III) being a cube and being\naccompanied by a cube are unrelated properties. As Marshall 2012 fn.\n35 points out, however, this response is far from convincing. First,\nit is not clear why (II) is meant to be true given Lewis’s\nfavoured conception of naturalness above, or what other notion of\nnaturalness it might be true of. Second, even granting (II) is true,\nit is not clear what it is for two properties to be unrelated in the\nsense that is at issue in (II). As a result, it is not clear why being\na cube and being accompanied by a cube are meant to be unrelated. \nA prominent attempt to design a theory of intrinsicality in terms of\nnon-disjunctivity that avoids these last two objections is that of\nBrian Weatherson (2001). In his theory, combinatorial principles of\npossibility are not used to derive characteristics of individual\nintrinsic properties, as Langton and Lewis do, but characteristics of\nthe whole set of intrinsic properties. He argues that this set, call\nit \\(SI\\), will have the following properties: \nThe first two principles are closure principles on the set. The third\nprinciple says that any two intrinsic properties that can be\ninstantiated can be instantiated together any number of times. And the\nfourth says that if objects having two intrinsic properties can be in\ntwo regions, and those two regions can be in a particular spatial\nrelation, then the regions can be in that relation while filled by\nobjects having those properties. The third principle suffices to show\nthat being such that a cube exists could not be in\n\\(SI\\), and the fourth to show that being a rock could\nnot be. \nWeatherson’s theory still requires an appeal to a concept of\nnaturalness. Without such an appeal, then if \\(F\\) and \\(G\\)\nare intrinsic properties that atoms could have, nothing in his theory\nrules out the property being simple, lonely and \\(F\\) or being \\(G\\)\nfrom being intrinsic. There are a few ways for the appeal to go at\nthis point, see Weatherson (2001) and Lewis (2001) for a few\nsuggestions. The following moves, taken directly from Langton and\nLewis, will probably work if any will. Say that the basic intrinsic\nproperties are those non-disjunctive properties such that their\nmembership in \\(SI\\) is consistent with the above four\nprinciples. Two objects are duplicates if they do not differ with\nrespect to basic intrinsic properties. A property is intrinsic iff it\nnever differs between duplicates. \nUnfortunately, Weatherson’s theory still faces apparent\ncounterexamples, similar to those faced by Langton and Lewis’s\naccount. While Weatherson’s account might successfully classify\nbeing such that there is a cube as extrinsic, it arguably fails to\ncorrectly classify other similar quantificational properties. One\nexample discussed by Hawthorne 2001 is the property of standing in\nrelation \\(R\\) to something, where \\(R\\) is a perfectly natural\nrelation a thing can stand in to itself and to things wholly distinct\nfrom it. Another example discussed by Marshall (2012), which relies on\nless controversial assumptions about what types of perfectly natural\nrelations there are, is the property of having a part that is 1 m away\nfrom something. Both these properties are arguably non-disjunctive.\nGiven the set of intrinsic properties satisfy the above conditions for\n\\(SI\\), both these properties plausibly satisfy them as well, and\nhence are plausibly falsely classified as intrinsic by\nWeatherson’s account. \nA further problem that applies to both Langton and Lewis’s\naccount and Weatherson’s account is that they are incompatible\nwith certain metaphysical views that posit necessary connections\nbetween wholly distinct entities. On a popular view of sets, for\nexample, each thing \\(x\\) is wholly distinct from its singleton set\n\\(\\{x\\}\\), and is such that, necessarily, it exists iff its singleton\n\\(\\{x\\}\\) exists. Given this view, however, no contingently existing\nthings can be lonely, and hence no intrinsic property that can only be\nhad by contingently existing things can be independent of\naccompaniment. Given being made of tin is such a property, it follows\nthat each of the above combinatorial accounts falsely classifies being\nmade of tin as extrinsic, given the above view of sets. (See Cameron\n2008, 2009 for more discussion.) \nAn account that does not appeal to non-disjunctivity, but which uses\nprinciples similar to those used in the accounts described above, has\nbeen proposed by Denby 2010. (This account is a modified version of an\nearlier account given in Denby 2006 which takes into account\nobjections made by Hoffman-Kolss 2010b.) Instead of appealing to\nnaturalness or non-disjunctiveness, Denby’s account employs the\nnotion of an object instantiating a property under a relation. Denby,\nhowever, gives very little explanation of what this technical notion\nis meant to mean, and it is therefore not clear what to make of\nDenby’s account. \nOne attractive idea is that a thing’s intrinsic properties are\nthose properties it would have if it were alone in the world. An\nelegant theory of intrinsicality that develops this idea is that of\nPeter Vallentyne (1997).  \nVallentyne defines a contraction of a world as “a world\n‘obtainable’ from the original one solely by\n‘removing’ objects from it.” (211) As a special case\nof this, an \\(x-t\\) contraction, where \\(x\\) is an\nobject and \\(t\\) a time, is “a world\n‘obtainable’ from the original one by, to the greatest\nextent possible, ‘removing’ all objects wholly distinct\nfrom \\(x\\), all spatial locations not occupied by \\(x\\), and\nall times (temporal states of the world) except \\(t\\), from the\nworld”, as well as all laws of nature from the world. (211)\nVallentyne claims that \\(F\\) is intrinsic iff, for any thing\n\\(x\\), for any time \\(t\\), and for any worlds \\(u\\) and\n\\(w\\) such that \\(u\\) is an \\(x-t\\) contraction of\n\\(w, x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) at \\(u\\) iff \\(x\\)\nhas \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) at \\(w\\). In short, a property is\nintrinsic to an object iff removing the rest of the world\ndoesn’t change whether the object has the property.\nVallentyne’s account classifies identity properties, like being\nObama, as intrinsic. It is therefore best seen as an account of\ninteriority. The account also classifies all indiscriminately\nnecessary properties as intrinsic. It is therefore arguably most\ncharitably interpreted as an account of metaphysical necessitation\ninteriority \nAs Vallentyne notes, this definition will not be very enlightening\nunless we understand the idea of a contraction. This seems related to\nthe objection Langton and Lewis (1998) urge against Vallentyne. They\nsay that Vallentyne’s account reduces to the claim that a\nproperty is intrinsic iff possession of it never differs between an\nobject and its lonely duplicates, a claim they think is true but too\ntrivial to count as an analysis. Their position is that we cannot\nunderstand contractions without understanding duplication, but if we\nunderstand duplication then intrinsicality can be easily defined, so\nVallentyne’s theory is no advance. \nThis criticism might be too quick. Stephen Yablo (1999) has argued\nthat Vallentyne should best be understood as working within a very\ndifferent metaphysical framework than Lewis. For Lewis, no (ordinary)\nobject exists at more than one world, so Vallentyne’s\ncontractions, being separate worlds, must contain separate objects.\nHence \\(x-t\\) contractions can be nothing other than\nlonely duplicates, and the theory is trivial. Yablo suggests that the\ntheory becomes substantive relative to a metaphysical background in\nwhich the very same object can appear in different worlds. If this is\nthe case then we can get a grip on contractions without thinking about\nduplications — the \\(x-t\\) contraction of a world\nis the world that contains \\(x\\) itself, and as few other things\nas possible. \nThere are, however, problems with Yablo’s defense of\nVallentyne’s contractionist approach to intrinsicality. One\nproblem, discussed in Parsons 2007 and Marshall 2014, is that, on\nYablo’s version of contractionism, we need to be able to make\nsense of sentences like ‘In \\(w\\), Prince Philip is not a\nhusband’, where \\(w\\) is the world consisting of just\nPrince Philip. Making sense of such sentences, however, is difficult\nwithout appealing to the distinction between intrinsic and\nnon-intrinsic properties. Appealing to this distinction when\ninterpreting Yablo’s account, however, would render it circular.\nFurther criticism and discussion of Yablo’s account is given in\nParsons 2007 and Marshall 2014. For further discussion of\nVallentyne’s account, see Marshall 2013. \nOver the last few years, there have been a number of attempts to\nanalyse intrinsicality in terms of metaphysical grounding, a prominent\ninstance of which is that of Rosen (2010). Other accounts of\nintrinsicality in terms of grounding include those of Witmer, Butchard\nand Trogdon (2005), Trogdon (2009), Bader (2013), and Witmer (2014).\nFor a discussion of the first two of these accounts, see the\nsupplementary document: \nThe state of affairs of it being the case that \\(A\\) is grounded by\nthe state of affairs of it being the case that \\(B\\) iff \\(A\\)\nin virtue of it being the case that \\(B\\), where the relevant\nnotion of “in virtue” is meant to be a metaphysically\nexplanatory one. Grounding is supposed to be a metaphysical analogue\nof causation: just as causation is what connects the explanans of an\nexplanation with its explanandum in causal explanation, grounding is\nmeant to be what connects the explanans of an explanation with its\nexplanandum in metaphysical explanation. An example of a metaphysical\nexplanation would be an explanation of why a certain type of act is\nwrong in terms of more fundamental moral facts. \nRosen’s account presupposes Russellianism about facts, according\nto which facts are structured out of things, properties and operators\nin the same kind of way sentences are built up out of names,\npredicates and operator expressions. Given this background,\nRosen’s analysis can be stated as follows: \nGiven the negation of the ascription of being Obama to Clinton is\ngrounded by the negation of the ascription of identity to Obama and\nClinton (a claim plausibly required by Rosen’s account) the\naccount classifies being Obama as non-intrinsic since Obama is not\npart of Clinton. The analysis also classifies intuitively\nnon-intrinsic indiscriminately necessary properties, such as the\nproperty of being such that there is a number, as non-intrinsic. Being\nsuch that there is a number is classified as non-intrinsic by the\naccount since, for example, its ascription to Obama is grounded by the\nfact that 2 is a number, which has a constituent, namely the number 2,\nthat is not part of Obama. These consequences of the account suggest\nthat it is best thought of as an account of the distinction between\nlocal and non-local properties. \nMarshall (2015) has given the following objection to Rosen’s\naccount. (The objection is meant to generalise to all attempts to\nanalyse intrinsically in terms of grounding, including the attempts of\nWitmer, Butchard and Trogdon (2005), Trogdon (2009), Bader (2013) and\nWitmer (2014). For an objection that is meant to apply to\nRosen’s account, but not Bader’s account, see Bader\n2013:fn. 53.) According to Marshall’s objection: a) there is\nnothing incoherent in supposing that a state of affairs that is\nintrinsically about \\(x\\) might ground a state of affairs that is\nintrinsically about something that is wholly distinct from \\(x\\),\nand b) on a number of popular metaphysical theories, there are such\ngrounding relationships. If there are such grounding relationships,\nhowever, Rosen’s account fails. \nTo consider an example of such a grounding relationship, let us assume\nthat standard set theory is necessarily true, and that existence is a\nlocal property. (If one thinks that existence is not a local property,\nperhaps because one thinks that existence is the non-local\nquantificational property of being such that, among all the things\nthere are, there is something that is identical to one, replace\nexistence with the property of being such that, among all the parts of\none, there is something identical to one, which is intuitively local.)\nLet us also assume the common (though not universal) view that members\nof sets are not literally parts of those sets. (See Lewis (1986a) for\nan example of a prominent theory of sets that denies members of sets\nare parts of those sets.) Given these assumptions, it is plausible\nthat the fact that  \\(\\{Obama\\}\\) exists is grounded by the fact that\nObama exists. However, if this is correct, then, since the fact that\nObama exists has a constituent that is not part of \\(\\{Obama\\}\\), \nit follows that Rosen’s account falsely classifies existence as a\nnon-local property. \nBorrowing from the recent account of Witmer (2014) (which is similar\nto Rosen’s account), we might attempt to fix Rosen’s\naccount by replacing parthood in the account with ontological\ndependence, where the relation of ontological dependence is defined by\n(21). \nApplying this modification to Rosen’s account results in\n(22). \nThis modified version of Rosen’s account appears to correctly\nclassify existence as a local property given the above metaphysical\ntheses. Given these metaphysical theses, however, it ends up\nclassifying too many properties as local. In particular, given the\nabove theses, it appears to falsely classify the non-local property of\nhaving a member as a local property. It does this, since, given the\nabove metaphysical theses, necessarily, if \\(x\\) has a member, then\nthe fact that \\(x\\) has a member is plausibly be grounded by the\nfact that \\(y\\) is a member of \\(x\\), where \\(y\\) is some\nmember of \\(x\\), and where \\(x\\) is ontologically dependent on\n\\(y\\). \nA defender of the above modified version of Rosen’s account\nmight respond to this objection by claiming that the account\nshouldn’t be understood as attempting to analyse the notion of a\nlocal property. Instead, such a proponent might argue, it should be\nunderstood as attempting to account for a further notion of\nintrinsicality not discussed in sections\n 2.2\n –\n 2.4.\n This notion of intrinsicality might be called the notion of a local*\nproperty, where the notion of a local* property is characterised by\n(23) and (24). \nA problem with this response is that there doesn’t appear to be\nany reason to regard the notion of a local* property as a notion of\nintrinsicality. While it is common to intuitively characterise\nintrinsicality by either explicitly using talk of parts or using talk\nthat very plausibly makes reference to parts, this is not the case for\nontological dependence talk. As a result, the notion of a local*\nproperty seems no more a notion of intrinsicality than, for example,\nthe notion of a local** property, which is characterised by (25) and\n(26).  \nSince the notion of being a local** property is clearly not a notion\nof intrinsicality, the notion of being a local* property appears also\nnot to be one.
