According\nto this classification, natural philosophy is the science of those\nbeings which undergo change and are independent of human beings. This\nvast field of inquiry was described in Aristotelian treatises such\nas Physics, On the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption,\nMeteorology, History of Animals, On the Parts of Animals, On the\nGeneration of Animals, On the Soul (whose Renaissance reception\nis not discussed in the present entry); the so-called parva\nnaturalia (other minor writings); and some apocrypha\n(e.g., the Problemata), which were taught in the universities\nin the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance. During the Renaissance,\ndespite the enduring centrality of the Aristotelian paradigm for the\ndiscipline, natural philosophy was enriched and expanded by a number\nof further approaches. By the end of the sixteenth century natural\nphilosophy was no longer purely identified with the Aristotelian\nsystem or a standard university curriculum. At the same time, the\nproliferation of new contexts and ways of learning did not\nautomatically eliminate older ones, and this fusion contributed to the\nbirth of modern science in a period of religious and political\nupheaval.\n\nRenaissance natural philosophy defies easy definition, since\ndescriptions of it may oversimplify, either by reducing it to its\nconnections with medieval science or, alternatively, forcing it into a\nteleology that culminates in the Scientific Revolution of the\nseventeenth century. Hence, there have been two opposing tendencies in\nscholarship: one which conflates the natural philosophy of the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries with the variety practiced in the\nMiddle Ages, even going so far as to interpret the Renaissance as a\nperiod of conservatism in this regard; another which emphasizes the\nrole of Renaissance natural philosophy as a “precursor” of\nmodern science, even at the cost of ignoring or removing its\nconnections to disciplines today considered pseudo-scientific, such as\nphysiognomy, astrology, and magic. Recent contributions, however, have\nhelped to outline the characteristics of Renaissance natural\nphilosophy in their own terms. Medieval natural philosophy was usually\nbased in the corpus aristotelicum and practiced in\nuniversities.  Yet this did not mean that its approach was purely\nstatic or regressive; on the contrary, thinkers like Jean Buridan,\nBiagio Pelacani, and Nicole Oresme took Aristotelian physics and\nmechanics in new directions in medieval Europe. Nevertheless, the\nnature of medieval universities was such that teaching was heavily\ncontrolled by authorities, and both metaphysics and theology exercised\na strong influence, limiting the number of directions in which\nscientific theorization could advance. Paradoxically, it was the\nreturn of another, rival school of\nthought—Platonism—that ultimately allowed for more freedom\nwithin the Aristotelian tradition. Though Plato’s philosophy had\nnever completely disappeared during the course of the Middle Ages, the consolidation of a\nNeoplatonic school in the fifteenth century led to the clear\ndistinctions between the spheres which properly belonged to the two\ngreat thinkers of the ancient world. While Plato was regarded as a\ntheologian and master of the metaphysical realities, Aristotle was\nseen as an investigator of the sublunar world subject to generation\nand corruption. The recovery of this ancient dichotomy had the effect\nof undermining the longstanding ties between Aristotelianism and\nScholasticism, and opened up new spaces for philosophy unimpaired by\nmetaphysical limitations. At the same time, also Platonism and other brands of ancient\nphilosophy—Stoicism, Skepticism, and\nEpicureanism—stimulated reflection on the natural world in different\nways, also in terms of method. The application of these ideas to various fields of inquiry gave\nRenaissance natural thought a distinctive identity, forged in\ncontinuous dialectic with Aristotelianism.  Aristotelianism therefore\nrepresented the driving force behind Renaissance philosophy of nature,\nboth because of its plurality of approaches and internal debates, and\nalso because it served as the polemical target of those who challenged\nthe traditional paradigm of university teaching. Finally, other\nfactors of a non-speculative character also had an impact on natural\nphilosophy: technological innovations such as printing, the telescope\nand the microscope, geographical discoveries, and developments within\nthe universities themselves, such as the institution of botanical gardens. The Aristotelian natural corpus covered a wide range of\nsubjects in a number of separate texts: while the Physics was\na sort of general work—which appeared to some fifteenth- and\nsixteenth-century authors more metaphysical, even overlapping with\nthe Metaphysics—the other treatises represented\ndifferent sections of natural philosophy on particulars. The success\nand influence of Aristotelian natural philosophy was due to its\ncentrality to university teaching, where it was favored because it\ncovered every topic, like an encyclopedia. Few attempts were made to\nreconsider which texts represented the core of the study of natural\nphilosophy in the universities; one remarkable exception was Pierre de\nla Ramée (1515–1572), who put a distinctive emphasis on\nparticular sciences at the expense of study of\nthe Physics. Physics, along with On the Heavens,\nMeteorology, and On Generation and Corruption, was the\nmain reference for natural philosophy in the\ntraditional curricula of the Faculty of\nArts. Universities—especially in Italy—appointed many\nlecturers in natural philosophy, who usually received high\nsalaries. In the second half of the sixteenth century, separate\nchairs, of botany, mathematics, and even chemistry (in Mantua and\nGermany), were established. Aristotelian texts were traditionally\nstudied according to the commentaries by Averroes (which provided the\ninternal partition of the texts into sections). Between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the works of other,\nmore ancient commentators on Aristotle were also adopted: those of\nAlexander of Aphrodisias and Simplicius were particularly popular, the\nfirst because of its radical mortalism, the second for its Neoplatonic\nand conciliatory tendencies. The rediscovery of the ancient\ncommentators was accompanied by an increasing reliance on the Greek\ntexts in universities, despite the enduring predominance of medieval\nLatin material. New commentaries also appeared alongside the ancient\nones: practically all of the most prominent professors composed their\nown commentaries to the Aristotelian natural texts, in particular\nbetween the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Usually these\ncommentaries followed the texts according to the Averroistic\ndivisions, but sometimes they were organized\nin quaestiones. Furthermore, the advent of printing made a large selection of\ntextbooks more widely available: some of them were very short\nintroductions for younger students, others were compendia,\nothers paraphrases (like those by Jacques Lefèvre\nd’Etaples (1455–1536), printed for the first time in 1492), and\nstill others dialogues (again, Lefèvre d’Etaples created\nsome of the most significant examples). Other popular works used for\nteaching were abridged versions of the Aristotelian treatises reduced\nto conclusiones, like the popular Textus abbreviatus\nphilosophiae naturalis by the French theologian Thomas Bricot (d.\n1516). There were also many different textbooks, which generally\nfollowed canonical organizations: either they explained the\nAristotelian works according to their order in the corpus, or\nthey highlighted subjects like principles, causes, movement, infinity,\nplace, void, and time. The famous Commentarii Conimbricenses,\nwhich from 1594 on became the standard text in the\nJesuit curriculum, contains a whole course on natural\nphilosophy organized as a commentary of the Aristotelian\ncorpus. Particularly after the second half of the sixteenth century,\nvernacular treatments of Aristotelian natural philosophy also began to\ncirculate, such as the translations by Antonio Brucioli\n(1498–1566), the paraphrases by Alessandro Piccolomini\n(1508–1579), the summaries by Jean de Champaignac (fl. 1595) and\nScipion Dupleix (1569–1661), and the commentaries by Cesare\nCrivellati (1553–1640), the latter explicitly addressed to\nuniversity students. Natural philosophy interacted with many other disciplines. The\nclose relationship between natural philosophy and medicine had already\nbeen stressed by Aristotle himself at the beginning of On Sense\nand Sensible (436a19–436b2). Medicine often competed with\nnatural philosophy within the universities: philosophy was a\ncurricular requirement for those who wanted to study medicine in the\nItalian universities and many of the greatest Renaissance natural\nphilosophers were also physicians (e.g., Alessandro Achillini\n(1463–1512) and Simone Porzio (1496–1554); there were also\nprofessional physicians who wrote on natural philosophy, such as\nDaniel Furlanus (d. 1600)). Ubi desinit philosophus\n(or physicus), incipit medicus (“where the\nphilosopher ends, the physician begins”): so went a proverb\nwhich implied an ambiguous boundary between the two disciplines: on\nthe one hand, it reflected the need to move beyond the theory\nrepresented by philosophy and into the actual practice of medicine; on\nthe other, it affirmed the idea that natural philosophy was necessary\nin order to prepare for medical studies. From this perspective,\nnatural philosophy represented either a mere preparatory stage on the\nway to the more perfect and concrete knowledge of medicine, or,\nalternatively, medicine was subordinate to natural philosophy (others,\nlike the philosopher Jacopo Zabarella (1533–1589), preferred to\ndistinguish natural philosophy from medicine because these two\ndisciplines did not share subject and method). The Renaissance debate over the superiority of Aristotle or Galen\nwas part of this rivalry: Aristotle was regarded by physicians as an\nimportant authority because of his philosophical system, but Galen had\noffered in his works more precise observations of the human body.\nNonetheless, since many points of their disagreement (e.g., the\nlocalization of the brain functions) were merely founded on\nspeculation, some doctors preferred to demonstrate the harmony between\nAristotle and Galen in order to overcome this impasse. Another discipline often compared to natural philosophy was\nastrology. The Jesuit Benito Pereira (1536–1610) stated that\nnatural philosophy is different from astrology because, among other\nreasons, the former studies things a priori, the latter a\nposteriori. Pereira also claimed that natural philosophy was not\ncapable of delineating its own sphere of inquiry, something which was\npossible for other disciplines such as logic and metaphysics. University courses on the Physics traditionally began with a\nlecture on ethical themes. This arrangement was inspired by\nAverroes’ proem to the text, which argued for the moral\nperfection of the speculative man. The connection between ethics and\nnatural philosophy also appeared in discussions of subjects like the\nimmortality of the soul or the human will, and consequently ethical\ndiscussions could occupy large sections both in reportationes\nof lessons and commentaries. Outside of universities and schools, there were also other places\nwhere natural philosophy was cultivated, particularly in academies and\nlearned societies. Even in literary societies such as\nthe Accademia Fiorentina (1541), patronized by Duke Cosimo\nde’Medici and his descendants, scientific matters (e.g., alchemy\nor spontaneous generation) were occasionally debated, often in the\ncontext of commentaries on the poems of Dante and\nPetrarch. The Accademia dei Lincei, founded in 1603, on the\nother hand, was exclusively interested in the sciences: as their\nstatute dictated, the Lincei had no interest in any\ncontroversy which was not scientific or mathematical, and they avoided\ninvolvement in political matters. The Accademia dei Lincei,\nlike the Accademia del Cimento after it (1657), was founded\nand patronized by members of the aristocracy, but never became as\nwell-grounded as other learned societies, such as the Royal Society\n(1661) or the Académie Royale (1666), which were\ndirectly sponsored by the state (the Académie Royale\neven received financial support from the treasury). Both of these\nlatter institutions developed out of more informal associations and\nthey encouraged collaboration among their members; they also\nexplicitly endorsed the open and public exchange of ideas, as opposed\nto the secretive practices of groups like the Lincei. Their\nmembers gave public demonstrations of their work, and the secrecy\nwhich had characterized scientific pursuit for centuries was\neventually abandoned in favor of a new empirical approach. Nonetheless, even when they did not sponsor academies, Renaissance\nlords and patrons often had a particular interest in scientific works\nand treatises, especially those devoted to subjects of military value\n(such as the works on metalworking by Vannoccio Biringuccio and George\nAgricola, or Niccolò Tartaglia’s treatise on ballistics,\nin the mid-sixteenth century), or booklets dedicated to parva\nnaturalia which were intended as forms of intellectual\nentertainment and usually contained descriptions of miranda\nnaturae or astrological predictions. Exceptional natural events\nsuch as earthquakes—a famous one occurred in Pozzuoli in\n1537—led to the publication of a number of short treatises which\ninterpreted the calamity as either a natural phenomenon or as a sign\nsent by the celestial influences: these works were particularly sought\nafter by powerful men who wanted to be reassured about the\nsignificance of natural events and their possible\nconsequences. Several Renaissance rulers cultivated an interest in\nsciences like alchemy, and patronized or participated first-hand in\ninvestigations of the natural world: disciplines like zoology, which\ndepended on the collection of material, information, and drawings,\nrelied particularly heavily on the sponsorship of the wealthy and\npowerful. The zoological and botanical works and catalogues which,\nthough composed by university professors, started from the 1540s to\ncirculate around Europe, were often addressed to or sponsored by\nrulers who had the means to employ artists and other specialists\nneeded to complete these costly volumes. Drawings were not simply\nornaments to a text, but a necessity for accurate classification of\nplants and animals. The same desire for accuracy that motivated the production of\nscientific images also led to more rigorous editions and translations\nof classic scientific texts, whose impact was magnified by the\nprinting press. Between 1495 and 1498 Aldus Manutius printed the\n“Greek Aristotle” in Venice, an edition prepared by a team\nwhich included the humanist-physicians Niccolò Leoniceno and\nThomas Linacre under the guidance of another physician, Francesco\nCavalli.  Consequently, Manutius’s edition, which incorporated\nsignificant improvements of the Aristotelian texts such as those\nproposed years before by Theodor Gaza for the Historia\nAnimalium, favored the scientific works by Aristotle and did not\ninclude, for example, either Rhetoric\nor Poetics. Yet the scientific text that received the most\nattention from philologists was Pliny’s Natural\nHistory. Between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\nPliny’s work was emended by philologists such as Ermolao\nBarbaro, Angelo Poliziano, and Niccolò Leoniceno—and also\ntranslated several times in the vernaculars—in increasingly\nsophisticated versions. Both the editions and the translations were\nintended to allow for a correct understanding of the text, which was\noften used by doctors and apothecaries. The same thing happened with\nDioscorides’ Materia medica, a text that unlike the\nencyclopedic Natural History was plainly addressed to a\nmedical audience, and which was then repeatedly emended and translated\nby professional physicians and natural philosophers. Yet, also authors\nlike Virgil, Horace and Ovid were common presences in discussions\nabout botany, and even a philological evaluation of the text of\nthe Bible provided material to natural philosophers. The foundation of botanical gardens in Pisa, Padua, and Florence (1544–1545),\nand then in Bologna, Leiden, Oxford, Montpellier, and Germany testify\nto the fact that empirical knowledge was increasingly considered a\nnecessity even in the universities, despite the fact that even at the\nend of the sixteenth century chairs in botany, such as the one\noccupied by Andrea Cesalpino (1519–1603) in Pisa, came with\nlower salaries than the ones given to their “speculative\ncolleagues” who taught natural philosophy or medicine. The\naforementioned catalogues of animals and plants, like those published\nby Pierre Belon (1517–1564), Guillaume Rondelet\n(1507–1566), and Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605), were thus\na combination of received authority and empirical observation, based\non 1) a philological and critical knowledge of the classical texts,\nnot a passive reading of them; and 2) direct observations and\nconversations not only with erudite peers and colleagues, but also\nwith the so-called “invisible\ntechnicians”—fishermen, sailors, and peasants who had\nfirst-hand knowledge of the relevant subjects and provided scientists\nwith important pieces of information.  Not by chance, in a\nlittle-explored field like the study of minerals, the most significant\ncontributions came from self-described “men without\nletters” (meaning not Latinate), such as Leonardo da Vinci\n(1452–1519) and the potter Bernard Palissy (1510–1589),\nwho identified fossils as the result of organic processes rather than\nabstract virtues.  These empirical approaches were also stimulated by the discovery\nof new continents, which contained plants and animals never known or\nnever described by classical authorities like Aristotle and Pliny. The\nnew knowledge brought by travelers and explorers helped debunk\nerroneous doctrines advocated by Aristotle, such as the\nuninhabitability of the torrid zone from Meteorology 362b\n6–9: a major exponent of Renaissance Aristotelianism, Pietro\nPomponazzi (1462–1525), publicly mocked the Philosopher during\nhis classes when discussing this passage, and supported his position\nby referring to the direct, recent observations of the navigator\nAntonio Pigafetta. The shift from an exclusively text-based approach to the study of\nnature founded on the study of a limited number of authors, to a new\none based on an enlarged encyclopedia and, above all, direct\nobservation, reached its full expression at the time of Galileo\nGalilei; but it was already perceptible in the writings of Lorenzo\nValla (circa 1406–1457)—who appealed to common sense\nagainst the absurdity of some of the Aristotelian tenets—and in\nthose of Leonardo da Vinci, who invoked a virtuous interaction between\nscience and practice. When Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639) stated\nthat he learned more from the anatomy of an ant or an herb than from\nany book ever written, he was simply expressing in a beautiful and\npoetic form a shared methodological creed. The principal tenets of the Aristotelian natural philosophy were:\nthe doctrine of form and matter, the four causes, the rigid\nseparation of the world into opposed spheres, and the finite nature of\nthe universe. During the Renaissance, these precepts were both\ndefended and revised by Aristotelian professors, or challenged by\nothers who sought to dismantle traditional philosophy. While these new\nphilosophers could rely on new evidence, methods, and observations to\ndefine the nature of the universe, in other cases the rejection of\nAristotelian doctrines and their substitution with new paradigms was\nmainly based on speculative arguments.  According to Aristotle, if the sublunar world was characterized by\nmutability, the supralunar world was—on the\ncontrary—absolutely immutable. The fundamental principles of\nAristotelian physics were in fact matter, form, and privation, and the\nnatural sublunar world was therefore the location where according to\nthese principles generation and corruption took place. Independent\nphilosophers offered alternatives to these principles and to the\nAristotelian hylemorphic apparatus. In order to describe nature within\nits own limits, Bernardino Telesio (1509–1588)—a staunch\nopponent of Aristotelianism—defended a different set of\nprinciples which had already been proposed by authors such Girolamo\nCardano (1501–1576) and Girolamo Fracastoro (circa\n1476–1553), and which he argued was based on data gathered from\nexperience rather than on arbitrary constructions. These alternative\nprinciples were passive matter and active force, the latter\ndistinguished into heat and cold. It was the interplay—or\nrather, the battle—between these opposite forces that brought\nabout the natural world.  Since every natural being depends on the\ninteraction between cold and heat, it must know what is necessary for\nits survival: therefore everything, including the forces themselves,\npossesses sensation, which was not related to the faculties of the\nsoul, as in Aristotelian psychology. This connection\nbetween sensus and self-preservation was also advocated by\nTommaso Campanella, who emphasized its importance for natural\nmagic. Telesio’s polemical refusal of Aristotle and his call for\nphysical inquiry made within natural limits was appreciated and\npraised even by those who recognized the contradictions in his\ntheories. Francesco Patrizi (1529–1597), who attacked Aristotle\nfrom a Platonic perspective in his Nova de Universis\nPhilosophia (1591), rebuked Telesio for the latter’s claim\nto have relied exclusively on the senses and rejected reason: he\npointed out that, in reality, Telesio did rely on metaphysical\narguments, though he claimed to deny them (for his part, Patrizi\nbelieved that natural philosophy requires metaphysical tools to fill\nin its gaps). The same recognition of too much reliance on metaphysics\ndrove Francis Bacon (1561–1626) to reject Telesio’s views\nin favor of experimental empiricism and of a full endorsement of the\ntestimony of sensory perception. Most Aristotelian interpreters believed matter to be prope\nnihil, pure potentiality, while others believed that it possessed\na certain degree of reality and actuality. The discussion on the\nnature of matter was further complicated by the suggestions offered by\nother traditions of thought, Platonism above all. According to\nMarsilio Ficino (1433–1499) in his Platonic Theology,\nprime matter had an existence which is not dependent upon\nform. Closely following the Timaeus, he claimed that matter\ncan therefore be intelligible, though in a weaker way. Giordano Bruno\n(1548–1600) proposed an even more radical departure from\ntraditional views of the passivity of matter. In the De la causa,\nprincipio et uno, Bruno affirms that matter is an active\nprinciple, not passive. Matter contains within itself every form, both\ncorporeal and incorporeal, and can be described as a kind of infinite\nlife. Bruno’s conception of matter also served as the basis for\nhis cosmological views (see below), and in particular for his claim\nthat the universe is infinite. A few years later, Tommaso Campanella\nreturned to a more traditional position. In the Del senso delle\ncose e della magia (printed in 1620) he argued for the synonymity between matter\nand body, and against the identification of matter with the\nAristotelian prope nihil, though he did emphasize its\npassivity: matter receives forms from external agents and does not\nproduce them from within itself.  Closely related to these problems was Aristotle’s doctrine\nof prime matter, which had controversial implications: as matter was\neternal, so was the world, and therefore the Christian dogma of the\ncreation of the world was untenable. Scholastic philosophers had long\nstruggled with this subject during the Middle Ages, and the most\ninteresting developments during the Renaissance were driven by the\nconfrontation between Aristotelianism and Platonism. Plato, in\nthe Timaeus, had clearly spoken of a God-creator, and once\nagain his doctrines were adopted by authors anxious to establish a new\nphilosophical foundation for Christianity. Bessarion (d. 1472), for\nexample, admitted that according to Plato matter was eternal, but that\nhe distinguished it clearly from the creator, who possesses a superior\neternity. In similar fashion, Marsilio Ficino expressly described\nprime matter as created and therefore not subject to generation and\ncorruption. Aristotelians were not always afraid, however, to argue\nfor the eternity of the prime matter: Francesco Vimercato\n(1512–1569), in his posthumous De rerum principiis, is\nthe most remarkable example. As late as the beginning of the\nseventeenth century, the debate continued: Cesare Crivellati composed\na dialogue (1617) between Plato and Aristotle in which the master\nrebukes his unfaithful student for teaching such an impious\ndoctrine. On the other hand, there were also authors who attempted to\nestablish an accord between Plato and Aristotle on this sensitive\nissue: a good example is the De naturae philosophia seu de\nPlatonis et Aristotelis consensione (1554) by Sebastian Fox\nMorcillo (1526–1560), in which the Spanish philosopher compares\nthe doctrines of the Timaeus and the Physics, and\nemphasizes the limits of both in front of the perfection of\nreligion. Other thinkers instead had a pragmatic approach to prime matter:\nalchemists like the Swiss physician Paracelsus (1493–1541)\nsought to find a principle to which every substance could be\nreduced. Though openly challenging traditional university teaching,\nParacelsus did not reject canonical motifs. For example, he relied on\nthe four elements (air, fire, water, earth), but he also proposed a\nnew triad: sulfur, mercury, and salt. Yet, even this proposal was not\nas iconoclastic as it appears, since it was partially founded on the\nAristotelian doctrine of the formation of metals contained in\nthe Meteorology (341b 6ff.). Nonetheless, by emphasizing the\nprocesses of association and dissociation of substances, Paracelsus\noffered an important contribution to the transformation of alchemy\ninto chemistry. Gradually chemistry separated from physics, understood\nas the science of bodies subject to movement, and positioned itself as\nthe science of bodies associated and dissociated. Johann Baptist Van\nHelmont (1579–1644), who opposed the Paracelsian principles,\ndeveloped a corpuscular doctrine of matter, a variant of atomistic\ntheory. Atomism in the Renaissance is typically related to the Neoplatonic concept\nof semina and to the Epicurean philosophy, and was usually advocated by\nradical anti-Aristotelian thinkers like Giordano Bruno. And while it\nis true that Aristotle rejected atomism and the existence of the void,\nthere were ways to argue for a Peripatetic version of atomism. \n Some medieval philosophers admitted the\nexistence of minima naturalia, the limits beyond which form\nis not conserved. The doctrine of the minima was intended to\nresolve a problem raised by Aristotle in On Generation and\nCorruption (327a 30–328b 24), namely, that of the necessity\nof finding a philosophical justification for combination, an\nintermediate phenomenon between generation and corruption. Over the\ncourse of the Renaissance the doctrine of minima naturalia\nwas further elaborated by authors like Agostino Nifo (circa\n1469–circa 1539) and Julius Caesar Scaliger\n(1484–1558). Scaliger granted a consistency to\nthe minima, making them not mere limits, but real physical\ncomponents which cannot be further divided. Furthermore, he rejected\ntraditional atomism, because it did not achieved the continuity of the\ncorpuscles which constitute a body. Despite their opposition to Peripateticism, the\ncorpuscularism of Van Helmont and Daniel Sennert (1572–1637) was\nrooted in this tradition. Sennert, in particular, was unable to reject\nthe Aristotelian concept of form, and aimed instead to establish a\nconcord between Aristotelianism and atomism. Even in a work\nprogrammatically entitled Philosophia Naturalis adversus\nAristotelem (1621), Sebastian Basson—who defended\ncorpuscularism—denied the existence of the void and rejected a\nmechanization of the natural world. It was Galileo Galilei who made a\nbold departure from the qualitative background of Aristotelian matter,\ndefending a mechanistic form of atomism in which atoms did not have\ndimensions. Despite the attempts of Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655) to conciliate it\nwith Christianity, atomism bothered traditionalists\nalso for its theological implications, both\nlarge (the teleological vision of the world) and small\n(transubstantiation). Even Descartes came under attack for this\nreason. Debate over the existence of the void was also lively\nthroughout the seventeenth century, largely because of the\nexperimental work of Evangelista Torricelli (1608–1647),\nValeriano Magni (1586–1661), Otto Von Guericke\n(1602–1686), and Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who opposed the traditional views\nof the so-called “plenists”.\n  The rigid peripatetic division of the universe into two different\nparts—one immutable and made of crystalline spheres, situated\nbetween the fixed stars and the moon, the other mutable, under the\nmoon—was also related in the Aristotelian paradigm to the\nconcept of the natural sublunar world formed by the four elements:\nfire, air, water, and earth. Every element behaves differently,\naccording to its so-called “natural movement”. Light\nelements, such as fire and air, always tend to go upward, while heavy\nelements, such as water and earth, move downward following a\nrectilinear movement. Every element aims, in fact, to reach its own\nnatural place, unless an external force causes a movement opposite to\nits nature—a “violent movement” (e.g., a stone\nthrown into the air). In both cases, Aristotelian theory considers\nmovement as a quality common to all natural things because of the\nelements which compose them. By contrast, the heavens, since perfect\nand composed by a single element (aether), are immutable and travel in\nconstant circular motion around an immovable center represented by\nEarth. An important corollary to the theory of natural places was the\nfinite character of the world, because it implied the existence of a\nunique center of the world (the Earth), while evidently it would not\nbe possible for an infinite universe to have a center.  These longstanding paradigms were destined to be challenged from\nthe sixteenth century onward, both from a speculative and an empirical\nperspective. Observation of stellae novae and comets condemned the crystalline spheres and raised doubts regarding the doctrine of the immutability of heavens.\nAccording to the traditional Aristotelian account, comets were\nphenomena in the sublunar atmosphere. The great astronomer Johannes\nRegiomontanus (1436–1476) did not challenge this vision of the\ncosmos when he calculated the distance of the 1472 comet by\nconsidering the angle of parallax, but about a century later, the\nJesuit Christopher Clavius (1538–1612), observing\na nova (1572), and Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), observing a comet (1577),\nboth demonstrated that the suddenly bright star and the comet must lie\nbeyond the moon, and that therefore the doctrine of the spheres was false. The demonstrated fluidity of heavens also compromised, more crucially, the doctrine of their immutability. Two factors made possible such an\nachievement: the availability of better measuring instruments, and a\nstronger emphasis on mathematics. This emphasis on mathematics was\nprobably the most important contribution of Platonism to the\ndevelopment of natural philosophy, and in particular astronomy, during\nthe Renaissance. Though it is true that Neoplatonic philosophers had\nproposed alternatives to the Peripatetic theories on the heavens\n(e.g., Marsilio Ficino argued that the heavens were made\nof spiritus and rejected the division of the universe into\nspheres), it was their insistence on the importance of geometry and\nmathematics that opened the way to the quantitative vision of the\nworld which gradually replaced the qualitative paradigm connected to\nthe Aristotelian tradition. The decision of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) to propose a\nheliocentric system, remove the Earth from the center of the universe,\nand establish a relationship between the distances of the different\nplanets from the sun and the amplitude of their orbits was based on\nmathematical reasoning and the weaknesses of Aristotelian-Ptolemaic\nsystem in this regard. Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) defended the\nCopernican theory by re-utilizing geometrical arguments from\nPlato’s Timaeus, and he also developed other theories\n(such as the elliptical form of the planetary orbits) founded on the\ngeometrical structure that he attributed to the universe. Despite the\nfact that aspects of his method, and in particular\nthe regressus, were essentially Aristotelian, Galileo Galilei\n(1564–1642) has been often described as a Platonist, insofar as\nPlatonism endorsed a mathematical approach. Galileo denied the reality\nof the physical elements of the Aristotelian world and the theory of\ntheir natural movements, and replaced them with corporeal matter,\nwhose properties and motions could be described in mathematical\nterms. Furthermore, by relying on new instruments such as the\ntelescope, Galileo was also able to make new observations which\nrevealed the imperfections of the supralunar world.  Galileo and the\nCopernican theory met with the resistance of the Church, but also of\nthe universities, whose professoriate was not eager to renounce one of\nthe central pillars of its teaching. On the other hand, the Tychonic\nsystem elaborated by Brahe, which attempted to conciliate the\ntraditional Aristotelian-Ptolemaic cosmology with Copernicus,\nencountered support even among Jesuit scientists. However, neither mathematics nor fresh observations were capable of\nresolving the problem of the nature of the universe: was it finite or\ninfinite? Is there only one world or do multiple worlds exist?\nAccording to the Aristotelians the universe must be finite, because it\nis impossible to have an infinite body in act, and Copernicus and his\nfollowers also endorsed the finitude of the heavens. Theology,\nhowever, offered arguments against the finitude of the universe:\nNicholas of Cusa (1401–1464) connected the infinity of God to\nthe infinity of heavens, and Palingenio Stellato (or Pierangelo\nManzolli, 1500/3–1543 ca.), in his Zodiacus Vitae,\ncompiled themes from different traditions (e.g., the Aristotelian\nspheres and the Platonic ideas), describing a universe made of\ninfinite light in order to celebrate the glory of God. Francisco\nSuarez (1548–1617), and a few years later\nthe Conimbricenses, also defended the existence of an\ninfinite space, even if it was only an imaginary one, combining\nPeripatetic doctrines with theological ones (above all the\nomnipresence of God, which cannot be limited by a finite\nspace). Giordano Bruno used the relationship between God and His\ncreation to argue for the infinity of the world. Bruno’s\nposition was in complete opposition to the Aristotelian cosmology: the\nspheres are broken, there is no hierarchy between the different parts\nof the world and no center, and therefore the natural movements are\nrejected. Bruno developed his theory of infinity not only by relying\non metaphysical arguments but also on a radical revision of the\nAristotelian definition of space, which he understood as a continuous\nquantity. Bruno’s proposal provoked reactions all over Europe:\nKepler rejected it several times in different\nways. Nevertheless, Kepler agreed with Bruno’s belief in the\nplurality of worlds—a problem which raised theological issues\nbecause of the question of salvation. Tommaso Campanella—an\nauthor who denied the infinity of the universe—resolved it by\narguing that the inhabitants of the other worlds were not men, and\ntherefore did not need to be saved by God. In the Middle Ages authors like Pietro of Abano, Nicolas Oresme,\nand John Buridan argued that any phenomenon, in particular those which\nwere usually believed to be supernatural or miraculous, could be\nexplained according to natural principles as the result of hidden\ncauses. A number of Renaissance thinkers also adopted this approach,\nincluding Pietro Pomponazzi. In his De incantationibus,\nPomponazzi stated that men tend to consider phenomena wondrous when\nthey are not able to identify their causes as the work of demons or\nmiracles.  Pomponazzi attributed apparently miraculous events to the\npower of imagination, to psychological states or to the influence of\nthe stars, since according to the Peripatetic paradigm the immutable\nfirst mover cannot have direct contact with the mutable sublunar\nworld, and therefore moves through secondary causes. Nonetheless,\ndespite his claim to speak purely secundum Aristotelem,\nPomponazzi relied on a wider range of readings, including Marsilio\nFicino. And in making these claims, Pomponazzi encroaches on very\nsensitive questions of religious faith. In his view, Christian\nmiracles can be understood in the context of a sort of philosophy of\nhistory, founded on the horoscope of religions: when a religion\nbegins, miracles occur, which are caused by starry influences, and\nwhen a religion declines, miracles disappear, because starry\ninfluences are weaker. This paradigm involved a rigid organization of\nthe universe, which left little or no space for free will. Pomponazzi\ntook this doctrine to its logical extreme in his De fato, a\nwork in which he claimed to endorse Stoicism, while in reality\nexposing the determinism embedded in the Aristotelian doctrine of\ncauses. Other Aristotelians who sought to avoid this determinism\nusually relied on the moderate position of Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nwho Pomponazzi attacked in the first part of his treatise. While\nPomponazzi reached these conclusions drawing on multiple sources,\nother authors, such as Gerardus Bucoldianus, Simone Porzio, and\nLudovico Boccadiferro preferred to rely solely on Aristotle in order\nto explain wondrous events like cataclysms or the appearance of\nmonstrous creatures, like those described by Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605), who\ninterpreted them as deviations from the course of nature, or Fortunio\nLiceti (1577–1657), who preferred to link the appearance of\nmonsters to ingenious experiments of nature. Nevertheless, this approach, which reduced the supernatural to the\nnatural, was not always coupled with Aristotelianism. On the contrary,\nit was often directed against Peripatetic doctrines, particularly when\nit relied on experimental and empirical observations. The\nsearch for the occult causes of things, which was often related to magical\nbeliefs and practices, also stimulated new\nempirical and experimental approaches: Giovanbattista della Porta\n(1535–1615) was among those who offered natural explanations for\nexceptional events while discarding the Aristotelian paradigm in favor\nof direct experience, in works such as the Magiae naturalis sive\nde miraculis rerum naturalium. Della Porta insisted on the\nsympathy and the antipathy of things, which are influenced by\ncelestial virtues, when dealing with topics like optics and\nmagnetism. And the De magnete of the anti-Aristotelian\nWilliam Gilbert (1544–1603) mixed experimentation (aimed at the\ndemonstration of the rotation and the magnetism of earth) with the\nbelief in the existence of a soul belonging to the earth. The occult\nproperties of things were also explored by other disciplines, such as\nmedicine. Jean Fernel (1497–1558) and Girolamo Fracastoro argued\nthat occult properties could be used to explain diseases and\ncontagions. The knowledge of the secrets of nature was in fact central to magic, a field\nwhich had an ambiguous relationship to natural philosophy. If a\nnatural philosopher wanted to describe and understand nature, a\npractitioner of magic wanted to investigate it and its occult\nproperties in order to master it. The Neoplatonic correspondences\nbetween macrocosmus—the\nworld—and microcosmus—man—allow magic to\nexercise its power on a reality which was seen in vitalistic and\ntranscendental terms: the book of nature for practitioners of magic was\nnot the same one as that of the Aristotelians or of Galileo, but it is\nwritten with signs and allusions. Magical doctrines had a wide\ncirculation throughout the Middle Ages, but were enriched in the\nfifteenth century by the rediscovery of the Corpus\nHermeticum. The Corpus was a collection of\nheterogeneous texts, dealing both with practical magic and the\nmystical teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, an Egyptian sage\nwho purportedly lived at the time of Moses and was first in the\nlineage of a tradition of wisdom (the so-called sapientia\nperennis). The alleged antiquity of the Corpus\nrepresented the strongest evidence of its authority and reliability,\nand thinkers like Marsilio Ficino in his De vita, and then\nCornelius Agrippa (1486–1535) in his De occulta philosophia, proposed\ndoctrines based on it. Their readers were encouraged to carve\ntalismans and images, and surround themselves with precise colors or\nherbs connected to planetary influences in order to exploit the\nconjunction of the whole, a living being of which man is both part and\nlord. Magical treatises included recipes and empirical descriptions,\nand in his De augmentis Scientiarum even Francis Bacon\ndescribed magic as an operative knowledge of hidden forms and the\nharmony of things, which displays the wonderful works of nature. The\nconnection between micro and macrocosmus also\nunderlay medical practice—as in the case of Ficino himself and\nlater Paracelsus—and disciplines like physiognomy, which was\nconsidered part of the Aristotelian natural encyclopedia. Della\nPorta’s De physiognomia humana (1586), which was mainly a\ncollection of past authorities that included ethical problems and was\naccompanied by illustrations, became the standard text on the topic\nuntil Lavater.  There were also expressly hermetic approaches to\nthe subject, including the one by Robert Fludd (1574–1637). Many of the doctrines of natural philosophy contrasted with the\nteachings of religion, and there were a number of possible solutions\nto this problem. Some authors appealed to the radical difference\nbetween the realms of faith and philosophy, relying on the Averroistic\ndoctrine of the “double truth”. This was the case, for\nexample, of Pietro Pomponazzi. Yet other authors, such as Bessarion or\nSimone Porzio, who came from very different backgrounds, went on the\noffensive, rejecting any confusion between philosophy and faith at the\nlatter’s expense (even though Bessarion, like Ficino, argued for\na greater compatibility between Platonism and Christianity). There\nwere also others, like the Jesuit Pedro da Fonseca (1528–1599),\nwho considered Plato’s natural philosophy too dangerously\nsimilar to Christianity and therefore preferred the Aristotelian\nparadigm. On the other hand, some thinkers tried instead to genuinely\nreconcile philosophy and faith, particularly during the periods of\ndoctrinal conflict and religious warfare that followed the\nReformation. This was particularly true in Protestant countries, where\neven at the end of the sixteenth century the problem of the double\ntruth was a matter of intense debate. Reformed scholars displayed a\nclear bias against Aristotle, the philosopher who they held\nresponsible for sustaining the scholastic edifice of Catholic\ntheology, and in Wittenberg they even mounted a short-lived attempt to\nreplace him with Pliny: but the disordered approach of the Natural\nHistory made it unsuitable for superseding the Aristotelian\nencyclopedia for teaching. Philipp Melanchthon (1497–1560)\nreconciled the distinction between religion and science of nature by\narguing that nature was creation of God and everything in it had to be\nseen as the work of providence. Some philosophers, such as John Amos\nComenius (1592–1670), supported the alliance between natural\nscience and religion by arguing for a philosophy based on the biblical\nteachings, even though this position was often intended to combat the\nexcess of natural philosophers rather than to offer an alternative\nsystem. On the other hand, both in Protestant and Catholic contexts,\nscientists like Rheticus (1514–1574) and Galileo denied that the\nBible had any scientific value. Scholars like John Case\n(d. 1600), who considered Aristotelianism compatible with Christian\ndogmas such as creation and divine providence, were particularly fond\nof searching for ways to syncretize theology with natural\nphilosophy. Attempts to reconcile the Philosopher with the Christian\nreligion, even at the cost of relying on forced or fanciful readings,\nwere still being made in the seventeenth century. Nor were these problems confined to Christian learned contexts:\nthey were the subject of a number of similar reflections within the\nJewish tradition as well. Jewish thinkers often considered natural\nscience a mere system of hypotheses, which was capable of grasping\nonly the superficial appearance of things, and was subordinate to the\nabsolute truth offered by the Torah. This position was defended by\nauthors such as Judah Loew ben Bezalel (also known as Maharal,\n1520–1609), who posited a radical distinction between the\nnatural world and the teachings of Torah, as well as Azariah Figo\n(1579–1547). In particular, Loew claimed that while it was\npossible to illuminate and explain the natural order of the physical\nworld, this was not true of the relationship between God and his\ncreation. This attitude was probably in part due to Jews’ sense\nof exclusion and marginalization from the institutions where natural\nphilosophy was taught and practiced (an important exception to this\nrule was Italy, where personalities like Elijah del Medigo (circa\n1458–1493) took advantage of the separation between science and\ntheology in the universities). Nonetheless, all of these Jewish\nauthors—both the Italian “free-thinkers” and those\nwho defended the superiority of the Torah—still relied on\nAristotle as the main authority for natural philosophy, and there were\nmultiple attempts by philosophers like Ioseph ben Shem Tov (circa\n1400–circa 1480) and Abraham Farissol (1451–circa 1525) to\nintegrate the Stagirite within the Hebraic philosophical tradition. A\nminority of Jewish authors, including Moses Isserles\n(1520–1572), considered natural philosophy a useful tool for\ndemonstrating the glory of God.\n","contact.mail":"evadel@sas.upenn.edu","contact.domain":"sas.upenn.edu"}]
