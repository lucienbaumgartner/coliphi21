While\nMendelssohn found himself at home with a metaphysics derived from\nwritings of Leibniz, Wolff, and Baumgarten, he was also one of his\nage’s most accomplished literary critics. His highly regarded\npieces on works of Homer and Aesop, Pope and Burke, Maupertuis and\nRousseau — to cite only a fraction of his numerous critical\nessays — appeared in a series of journals that he co-edited with\nG. E. Lessing and Friedrich Nicolai. Dubbed “the Jewish\nLuther,” Mendelssohn also contributed significantly to the life\nof the Jewish community and letters in Germany, campaigning for\nJews’ civil rights and translating the Pentateuch and the Psalms\ninto German. Not surprisingly, as a Jew with an unwavering belief in\nthe harmonizing effects of rational analysis and discourse,\nMendelssohn rankled both institutional and self-appointed advocates of\nChristianity as well as Judaism. Thus, Johann Lavater infamously\nchallenged him to refute the arguments of the Pietist theologian,\nCharles Bonnet, or convert to Christianity (a challenge that\nMendelssohn effectively disabled with a plea for tolerance and a\nseries of reasons for refraining from such religious controversy).\nSimilarly, some Jewish thinkers took exception to Mendelssohn’s\nJerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism and its argument\nfor conceiving Judaism as a religion founded upon reason alone. In\naddition to the “Lavater affair” and his work as editor\nand critic, Mendelssohn was probably best known to his contemporaries\nfor his penetrating accounts of the experience of the sublime, for\nlucid arguments for the soul’s immortality and God’s\nexistence, for his close association with G. E. Lessing, for his\nprotracted “pantheism dispute”\n(Pantheismusstreit) with Jacobi during the 1780s, and for his\ninsistence that Lessing was not the Spinozist that Jacobi portrayed\nhim to be. To posterity he is perhaps best known as the model for\nNathan der Weise, the protagonist in Lessing’s famous\nplay of the same name, championing religious tolerance.\n\nMendelssohn’s “On Evidence in Metaphysical Sciences”\n(the so-called Prize Essay) garnered first prize in the\ncontest staged by the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences on the\nquestion of whether metaphysical truths are able to have the same sort\nof evidence as mathematical truths. (An essay by Immanuel Kant came in\nsecond place.) In the essay, published in 1763, Mendelssohn argues\nthat metaphysics pursues its subject matter by applying the same\nmethod that mathematics does: conceptual analysis. As he puts it,\n“The analysis of concepts is for the understanding nothing more\nthan what the magnifying glass is for sight” (Philosophical\nWritings, p. 258). But Mendelssohn then proceeds to differentiate\nthe kinds of evidence in mathematics and in metaphysics in the\nfollowing way. Like calculus, but unlike geometry, metaphysics works\nwith concepts that are no less certain than those of geometry, but\nlack the transparency and imaginative resources available to the\ngeometer’s concepts. The difference between mathematics and\nmetaphysics lies in the difference in the content of the concepts,\nnamely, the difference between quantity and quality. At the same time,\nthere is a basic harmony between the two disciplines since quantity\nand quality are both intrinsic characteristics of finite things and\nneither quantity nor quality exists without the other (though\nqualities and not quantities are allegedly conceivable without some\nother thing). \nMendelssohn acknowledges that, despite the fact that the method is the\nsame and the content in each case (mathematics and metaphysics) is an\nintrinsic character of things, progress in metaphysics has lagged far\nbehind that in mathematics. He suggests three “objective”\nreasons for this lag: first, metaphysics’ greater reliance upon\narbitrary signs (signs that do not essentially coincide with what is\nsignified); second, the holistic content of metaphysics (no quality\ncan be defined without an adequate insight into the others); and\nthird, metaphysics’ need to establish the actual existence of\nwhat corresponds to the analyzed concepts. Thus, for Mendelssohn,\nmathematical truths need not suppose more than the appearances of\nthings as long as a distinction is maintained between constant and\ninconstant appearances or, equivalently, between appearances that have\ntheir basis in the intrinsic, essential constitution of our senses and\nthose that do not (e.g., those due to sickness or a faulty\nperspective). “Thus, even in the system of a doubter or an\nidealist, the value of not only pure, theoretical mathematics but even\npractical and applied mathematics remains, and it retains its\nundeniable certainty” (Philosophical Writings, p. 268).\nMetaphysics, by contrast, requires a resolution of the problem of\nidealism. \nTwenty-five years after the Prize Essay, Mendelssohn\ncontinues to struggle with the issue of idealism in Morning\nHours, his final metaphysical work. Although he espouses a theism\nthat is compatible with a realist position (what he dubs\n“dualism” as opposed to idealism, materialism, and\nskepticism), he appears to be moving toward a position that straddles\nan idealist/non-idealist divide. He views inquiry into something\n“extra-conceptual” as tantamount to “inquiring about\na concept that is actually no concept and therefore something\ncontradictory is supposed” (Morning Hours, p.\n42/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 60f). A further tilt in the\ndirection of idealism is apparent in his rejection of the traditional\ndefinition of truth as an agreement of things with thoughts, on the\nground that the copy (the thought) cannot be compared with the\noriginal (the thing). Since thoughts can be compared with one another,\nhe turns to them for a determination of truth, though it is not clear\nhow this move can avoid idealism. At the same time, however, he\ndistinguishes truths that are certain (consisting in the\nagreement of thoughts with themselves) from actual truths,\ndetermined by adherence to principles of induction and analogy in\naddition to the principle of noncontradiction. The latter truths are\ntruths about facts outside us or about a causal connection, though\nthey are relative to certain factors: the number of sensations of a\nsingle sort that agree with one another, the number of different sorts\nof sensations that concur, and the number of times our assessment\nagrees with those of others, of other species, and of even\n“higher entities” (Morning Hours, pp. 6f, 37ff,\n41/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 15f, 54f, 59; for review of\nMendelssohn’s epistemology in the undeservedly neglected first\npart of Morning Hours, see Dahlstrom 2018b). Echoing Descartes,\nMendelssohn maintains that demonstration of God’s existence is\nnecessary to certify the actual existence of things outside us. \nThis ambivalence can perhaps be traced to the mature\nMendelssohn’s growing suspicions that the entire issue\nseparating idealists and those supporting contrasting positions is\nmisbegotten, a product of linguistic confusion (see the discussion of\nMendelssohn’s views on language below). “I fear that, in\nthe end, the famous debate among materialists, idealists, and dualists\namounts to a merely verbal dispute that is more a matter for the\nlinguist than for the speculative philosopher” (Morning\nHours, p. 42 (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte\nSchriften, 3/2, p. 61). Mention has already been made of\nMendelssohn’s view in the Prize Essay that\nmetaphysics’ necessary reliance upon artificial signs is one\nreason why its difficulties are more intractable than those of\nmathematics. In 1785, in Morning Hours, he goes further:\n“You know how much I am inclined to explain all the\ncontroversies of the philosophical schools as merely verbal disputes\nor at least as originally deriving from verbal disputes”\n(Morning Hours, p. 75/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p.\n104; for commentary, see Dahlstrom 2011). In keeping with these\nadvancing suspicions about the origin and the efficacy of the issue\nover idealism and dualism (realism), Mendelssohn eventually comes to\nassign reason a mediating role in disputes between common sense and\nspeculation. Common sense is usually but not invariably right, he\ncontends, and hence reason’s task is to present a defense of\nspeculation when it departs from common sense. For valuable discussion\nof Mendelssohn’s approach to common sense, see Franks 2011. (The\nappeal to reason to mediate and, if necessary, to rein in speculation\nalso plays a significant role in Mendelssohn’s account of a\n“refined” or “purified” pantheism in\nMorning Hours. On this point, see below “9. Controversy\nwith Jacobi over Lessing’s alleged pantheism”). As for the\nimpact of Mendelssohn’s approach to idealism in Morning\nHours, many scholars concur that Kant’s Refutation of\nIdealism directly takes it up. However, at least one scholar contends\nthat Kant does so by accepting Mendelssohn’s approach (Munk\n2011) while others argue, albeit for contrasting reasons, that he does\nso in order to refute Mendelssohn’s position (Dyck 2011; Guyer\n2018a). \nIn Phaedo or On the Immortality of the Soul, loosely modeled\non Plato’s dialogue, Mendelssohn combines a paean to Socrates\nwith an elaboration of the dreadful personal, moral, and political\nimplications if a person’s life is her “highest\ngood.” A best-seller of its time, running through three\neditions, this “classic of rational psychology,” as\nDilthey put it, also contains an argument for the simplicity and\nimmortality of the human soul, explicitly singled out for criticism by\nKant in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason.\nMendelssohn supports the notion that the soul is simple and thus\nindestructible by noting that certain features of the soul, namely,\nthe unifying character of consciousness and the identity of\nself-consciousness, cannot be derived from anything composite, whether\nthose composite parts be capable or not of thinking. “We would\nbe able neither to remember nor to reflect nor to compare nor to\nthink, indeed, we would not even be the person who we were a moment\nago, if our concepts were divided among many and were not to be\nencountered somewhere together, combined in the most precise ways they\ncan. We must, therefore, assume at least one substance that combines\nall concepts of the component parts…. There is, therefore, in\nour body at least one sole substance that is not extended, not\ncomposed, but instead is simple, has a power of presentation, and\nunites all our concepts, desires, and inclinations in itself”\n(Phädon (2007), pp. 119f (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/1, pp. 96f). As for the\nhuman soul’s fate after death, Mendelssohn appeals to divine\ngoodness and providence, which perhaps explains why, following the\npublication of the Phaedo, he finds himself needing to\nrevisit the proofs for God’s existence. Playing an important\nrole in Mendelssohn’s development of his views of the human\nvocation and human immortality in the years prior to the composition\nof the Phaedo is a 1764–65 debate with Thomas Abbt. On the\ntopic of Thomas Abbt’s role in this regard, his correspondence\nwith Mendelssohn, and Herder’s critical reaction to\nMendelssohn’s views, see Pollok 2017 and Pollok 2018b. For an\ninsightful study of Mendelssohn’s anthropology more generally,\nsee Pollok 2010. \nFrom the beginning of his career to the end, Mendelssohn consistently\nupheld the demonstrability of God’s existence. However, not all\narguments were equally compelling in his view. In the Prize\nEssay he contends that probable arguments for God’s\nexistence based upon beauty, order, and design are more eloquent and\nedifying but less certain and convincing than strict demonstrations.\nSimilarly, in Morning Hours, he cites the argument that the\nexternal senses’ testimony to an external world is unthinkable\nwithout a necessary, extra-worldly being, but adds that this sort of\nargument would hardly convince an idealist, sceptic, or solipsist.\nThere are, however, at least two ways in which, according to\nMendelssohn, God’s existence can be established with certainty.\nThe first way is through application of the principle of sufficient\nreason to the certain existence of contingent things. The inner\ntestimony of one’s own cogito attests to the existence of\nsomething contingent. Since the sufficient reason for the existence of\ncontingent things must “indirectly” be a necessary being,\na necessary being exists. Hence, Mendelssohn sums up this argument by\nsaying: “I am, therefore there is a God.”\n(Philosophical Writings, p. 289; Gesammelte\nSchriften, 3/2, pp. 78, 83f). \nMendelssohn’s second way of proving God’s existence is\nbased upon consideration of the idea of God together with the\nconditions of nonexistence. If something does not exist, then it is\neither impossible or merely possible. To say that something\nnonexistent is impossible is to say that its intrinsic properties are\ncontradictory, e.g., a square circle. To say that something\nnonexistent is possible is to say both that its intrinsic properties\nare insufficient to determine that it exists and that it is contingent\nupon extrinsic factors that do not obtain. If God does not exist, then\nit is either because the idea of God is impossible or because it is\nmerely possible, i.e., contingent. Since contingency entails\ndependency and independence is greater than dependence, it would\ncontradict the essence of a perfect being for that being to be\ncontingent. Hence, the idea of a perfect being cannot be the idea of\nsomething merely possible. But the idea of a perfect being also does\nnot contain determinations that must be affirmed and denied at the\nsame time; in other words, the idea is not impossible. In this way\nMendelssohn concludes that God exists from the consideration that the\nidea of God cannot be the idea of something nonexistent. While we can\nconceive finite, contingent, entities as nonexistent, we cannot\nconceive as nonexistent an infinite, necessary entity, namely, an\nentity that combines all affirmative features and properties to the\nhighest degree. “It can either not be thought at all or not be\nthought otherwise than with the predicate of actual existence”\n(Morning Hours, p. 113/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p.\n154). In this connection, it deserves mention that Mendelssohn rejects\nas quibbling the objection that existence is not a predicate. A\nconcept of existence, he maintains, emerges in all of us in a similar\nway as we search for what is common to what we do and undergo, thereby\nenjoying a universality that is not further analyzable. Thus,\nMendelssohn will allow that existence is not a predicate, that it is\ndifferent from all features and properties of things, and, hence,\ncannot be merely added to the list of properties of the most perfect\nentity. Nevertheless, whether existence is the “position”\nof all properties of a thing or something inexplicable, Mendelssohn\nstands by his claim that we can only think something contingent\nwithout it. As he sums up the inference: “A God is thinkable,\ntherefore a God is also actually on hand [vorhanden]”\n(Morning Hours, p. 56 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p. 78). \nTowards the end of Morning Hours Mendelssohn introduces a\nfurther proof for God’s existence, based upon our certainty of\n“the imperfection of our self-knowledge” (Morning\nHours, p. 107/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, p. 147). We have\ncertain knowledge, Mendelssohn contends, not only of ourselves but\nalso of the limited scope of this knowledge. “I am not merely\nwhat I distinctly know of myself or, what amounts to the same, there\nis more to my existence than I might consciously observe of myself;\nand even what I know of myself is in and for itself capable of far\ngreater development, greater distinctness, and greater completeness\nthan I am able to give it” (Morning Hours, p.\n103/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, p. 141). From the limitations\nof our knowledge of ourselves (or, for that matter, of anything actual\nexisting) together with the less plausible assumption that “that\neverything actual must be thought to be actual by some thinking\nbeing,” Mendelssohn infers that there is “an infinite\nintellect” that does represent everything to itself (Morning\nHours, pp. 103f/Gesammelte Schriften 3/2, pp.\n141ff). \nMendelssohn’s ethics is a form of perfectionism, resembling the\nrationalist perfectionism of Christian Wolff’s ethics but also\nsignificantly departing from it in ways that echo Mendelssohn’s\nappreciation of aesthetic and affective dimensions of moral life. In\nthe fourth and final part of his Prize Essay, Mendelssohn investigates\nthe extent of evidence in the foundational principles of ethics\n(Anfangsgründe der Sittenlehre) and, in particular, how\nit compares to evidence (“the certainty and\ncomprehensibility”) of geometry’s basic principles. He\nintroduces the discussion with the observation that when someone\nundertakes the right sort of action, that person “tacitly”\nmakes the following “rational inference,” a moral\nsyllogism in the form of a modus ponens: \nMajor premise: “Where the property A is encountered, my duty\nrequires me to do B.” \nMinor premise: “The present case has the property A.”  \nThe major premise is a “maxim, a general rule of living,”\nassumed at some other point and remembered on the present occasion.\nThe minor premise is based “upon an exact observation of the\npresent circumstances and on the conviction that they fully agree with\nrequisite properties A.” As in mathematics, the doctrine of\nmorals divides into two parts, the theoretical (instructional) and the\npractical (applied), where the former conveys the general rules of\nliving that serve as the major premises and the latter their\napplication in a particular case. Mendelssohn submits that it is not\ndifficult to prove “with geometric rigor and trenchancy”\nthe general principles of ethics, i.e., the rational principles that\nprescribe what to do and to leave undone. Nothing is clearer or more\ncompelling, he observes, than Marcus Aurelius’ conclusion that\nthese principles follow from what is common to us as rational\ncreatures. Because human beings have a common power of making value\njudgments (Beurtheilungskraft), all their judgments about\ngood and evil rest upon the same ground, diverging from one another\nonly to the degree that their insight does. There are accordingly\n“universal ground-rules” (what Mendelssohn also dubs\n“laws of nature”) according to which human beings are\nsupposed to decide what to do and leave undone. Moving freely between\nthe singular and the plural in this regard, Mendelssohn refers without\nqualification to both “this universal law of nature” and\n“laws of nature,” but this looseness can probably be\nattributed to the fact that he entertains three ways of proving and\nthus articulating “the first law of nature.” \nThe first proof is based upon observation. To determine these\nuniversal laws of nature, one need only observe what human beings do\nand leave undone, their various inclinations and passions, and single\nout what they all aim for. What all the desires and wishes, passions\nand inclinations have in common is the pursuit of “the\npreservation or betterment of our inner or outer condition or that of\nanother creature.” Both those who are virtuous and those who are\nridden with vices aim at perfection, true or illusory, a perfection\nunderstood as the preservation or betterment of their inner or outer\nstate or that of others. From this universal pursuit the first law of\nnature flows, namely, “make your inner and outer state and that\nof others, in proper proportion, as perfect as you can.” Duties\nto oneself, others, and to God can be derived from this first law.\n(The argument is short on details, to be sure, supposing as it does a\nuniversality and essentialness not afforded without further ado by\nobservation alone.) \nThe second proof establishes the same basic law but does so “a\npriori” on the basis of the “mere definition” of an\nentity with free will. The choices made by such an entity are based\nupon what it finds pleasing, namely, “the perfection, beauty,\nand order” that it perceives or believes that it perceives in\nthe preferred objects. With their unmistakably aesthetic accent, these\nqualities serve as “motivating grounds”\n(Bewegungsgründe) to act or refrain from acting. Without\nbeing physically coercive, these motivating grounds entail an\n“obligatoriness” or “moral necessity,” since\nno free spirit could enjoy the opposite of them. This proof has been\nrecently challenged in at least two, complementary ways (Klemme 293).\nFirst, if a free, rational person necessarily chooses to act in\naccordance with her knowledge of good and evil, how can she be\nrequired to perfect herself? Second, why is the law normative and not\nmerely descriptive? These are significant objections but they arguably\nsuppose positions that neither Mendelssohn, the proponent of common\nsense, nor Mendelssohn, the metaphysician, can countenance. By\nunderscoring the imperfection but also the corrigibility of reasonable\npeople, common sense insures the meaningfulness of the injunction to\nself-perfection. From a metaphysical description of the basis\n(motivations, ends) of a rational choice, normative constraints follow\nfor making precisely those sorts of choices. \nThe third proof of this universal law of nature is based upon its\nagreement with the final purpose of creation. From the assumption of a\ncreator of the world who acts with wisest of intentions, it follows\nthat promotion of the perfection of the creation must be God’s\nwill. To be sure, might never makes right and Mendelssohn accordingly\nstresses that law is a consequence not of divine power but of the\nright of a divine will. Nonetheless, from (i) the fact that God can\nonly want what is best and (ii) the fact that “a right is\nnothing other than a moral capacity to do what conforms to the rule of\nperfection,” it follows that God possesses the right to\nprescribe to his creation laws that are necessarily rules of its\nperfection. This third proof arguably represents a further departure\nfrom Wolff who rejects the equivalence of the natural law with a\ndivine command. For Wolff, only someone lacking reason has need of\nmotivations other than natural obligatoriness (Klemme 295f). \nSumming up these three proofs, Mendelssohn lists three basic maxims\nthat lead to the same conclusion. Whether we (1) consider what is\ncommon to all human inclinations, (2) recognize ourselves as entities\nendowed with free wills, or (3) acknowledge that we are God’s\ncreation, “all three maxims lead to the common conclusion:\nperfect yourself and others.” \nMendelssohn employs the expression “right of nature”\n(Naturrecht) to designate the sum of the laws of natural\nright resulting from the application of these rational principles to\nindividual cases. Given this one universal law of nature, the concepts\nof moral philosophy are sufficiently connected with one another to\nmake up a theoretical system and it is possible to develop “all\nour duties, rights, and obligations” from that natural law. The\nresult is a moral philosophy as certain as metaphysics, namely, a\n“science of the qualities [Beschaffenheiten] of an\nentity with free will.” At the same time, he contends that the\nderivation, not only of the universal natural law, but also of various\nmaxims from it (“Love virtue,” “control your\npassions”) is as certain as any geometric proof. Yet, unlike\ngeometry, ethics is about human action and this science is, moreover,\n“erected on the grounds of metaphysics,” in particular,\nthe metaphysical doctrines of God, the world, and the human soul.\nHence, evidence in moral philosophy is necessarily even more difficult\nto obtain than in metaphysics. While the foundational principles of\nethics can be proven with the same certainty (Gewissheit) as\nthose of geometry, it is not on the same level with respect to its\nability to be comprehended (Fasslichkeit). Unlike geometry,\nethics supposes the comprehension of those metaphysical truths. \nAs for applied ethics, it is in the same position as any other\npractical science in that its degree of certainty is dependent upon\ncontingent and unknown circumstances as well as upon actions’\neffects that cannot be foreseen with certainty. The minor premise of\nthe practical syllogism, determining what we should do in practice,\ni.e., in the case before us, runs through all levels of probability.\nThen, too, there is the possibility that the obligatoriness of some\nhigher-level duty stands in the way of the application of a\nlower-level duty but that, given the situation, this fact escapes\n“the sharpest attention.” Indeed, what mortal, Mendelssohn\nasks, can be certain that his action is the best that he can do? In\nmost cases, “conscience and a fortunate sense for the truth\n(bon-sens)” must stand in for reason. Like taste in\nregard to beauty and its opposite, conscience and a sense for truth\nare capacities, developed over time, of correctly distinguishing good\nand evil, true and false respectively without the benefit of extensive\nreflection and on the basis of inferences that are less than clear.\nDespite the fogginess of its inferences, “this inner\nfeeling,” this sense for the good and the true, acts on us\naccording to universal principles that, through constant practice,\nhave been incorporated into our temperament and accordingly influence\nour desires far more than the clearest rational inferences that may\nconvince but fail to stir us. Coupled with the acknowledgment of the\nlack of the appropriate distinct concepts for the particular\napplication, this recourse to conscience as a feeling suggests a\nfurther sharp break with the rationalism of Wolff and his followers\n(Klemme 298f). \nBy way of introducing the last segment of this discussion of evidence\nin ethics, Mendelssohn distinguishes theoretical and practical forms\nof approval. While it is impossible to doubt what is a matter of\nintellectual conviction, it is possible for us to act contrary to an\nobligation that we are convinced of. So, too, some truths are\nintellectually convincing but do not move us, whereas other, less\ncertain truths do so, producing “lively and efficacious”\ncognition, passing over into the faculty of desire, and even\nmotivating decisions. The familiar reason for this discrepancy in the\nefficaciousness of truths is, Mendelssohn, submits, the recalcitrance\nof inclinations to reason. Approval of a truth becomes practical if\nthe rational principles either gain the upper hand over inclinations\nor put them to its advantage. Mendelssohn identifies ethics’\nfour means of securing the agreement of reason and desire: (1)\nincreasing the number of motivations, (2) practice and habit, (3)\nadding pleasant sensations (for which art and literature are\nparticularly useful), and (4) examples that have been observed or can\nbe intuited (e.g., history, Aesop’s fables). \nIn On the Main Principles of the Fine Arts and Sciences,\nMendelssohn sets out from the assumption that the human spirit has\nlearned to imitate beauty, “the self-empowered mistress of all\nour sentiments,” in works of art. He then proceeds to ask what\nthe arts have in common or, in other words, what beauty is.\nBatteux’s thesis that art consists in the imitation of nature\nmerely defers the question or, better, requires its revision to the\neffect that we ask what the beauties of nature and of art have in\ncommon. After rejecting Hutcheson’s appeal to an aesthetic sense\nas a deus ex machina that forecloses inquiry, Mendelssohn contends\nthat the common feature is a sensuously perfect representation (a\ncontention that can be traced back to Sulzer and Baumgarten).\n“Sensuous” in this connection stands not simply for the\nfact that an object is sensed by the external senses, but also for the\nfact that an entire array of an object’s features is perceived\nall at once. Unlike the distinct representation of a triangle whereby\nthe intellect distinguishes parts and aspects of the triangle from one\nanother, a sensuous representation is clear but indistinct, that is to\nsay, to have a sensuous representation is to perceive something\nwithout intellectually distinguishing its parts or aspects. But we can\nsensuously perceive an order or harmony to those aspects without\nintellectually distinguishing them. Beauty or the perfect sensuous\nrepresentation — whether in nature or in art — accordingly\npertains to forms, orders, harmonies, and “indeed, everything\ncapable of being represented to the senses as a perfection”\n(Philosophical Writings, p. 172). On this definition of art,\nwhat is represented can be ugly or repugnant as long as the\nrepresentation is sensuously perfect (though Mendelssohn does address,\nas discussed below, the mixed sentiment that accrues when the object\nrepresented is unpleasant). From these considerations, Mendelssohn\nderives two necessary conditions of fine art and letters: faithfulness\nof the representation (“imitation”) and, far more\nimportantly, the artistry, even “genius,” involved. In\nthis connection, he argues that, as far as individual beauties in\nnature are concerned, they are inferior to the beauties produced by\narts. In On the Main Principles Mendelssohn also establishes\nthe general distinction between fine arts and fine science along the\nlines of the difference between natural and artificial signs. Whereas\nthe “fine arts” (beaux arts) — music,\ndance, painting, sculpture, and architecture — predominantly\nwork with natural signs, the “fine sciences” (belles\nlettres) — poetry and rhetoric — typically employ\nartificial signs. The distinction is hardly ironclad, however, and\nMendelssohn ends On the Main Principles with a discussion of\nways the arts may borrow from one another (e.g., allegorical painting)\nor combine (e.g., opera). \nAt one point in the dialogue On Sentiments\n(Mendelssohn’s second publication but first publication on\naesthetic matters), one of the protagonists differentiates three sorts\nof pleasure: sensuous, beautiful, and intellectual (a differentiation\nwhich approximates respectively the three sorts of perceptions\nelaborated by Leibniz and Wolff, among others, namely, confused,\nclear, and distinct). In this context, Mendelssohn explains how beauty\naffords a distinctive pleasure precisely as the unity of the\nmultiplicity of things taken in by the senses (a view subsequently\niterated, as we have seen, in On the Main Principles).\nUnaddressed by this differentiation of pleasures, however, are the\nso-called “mixed sentiments” that we seem to experience\nsometimes in viewing what is otherwise painful, terrifying, or, at any\nrate, does not exhibit the harmony or order typical of beauty. At\nfirst (namely, in On Sentiments) Mendelssohn thought that the\nproblem could still be handled by identifying some perfection in the\nobject — e.g., the skillfulness of the gladiator, the virtue of\nthe tragic figure — as the source of the pleasure that we feel.\nSix years later, in Rhapsody or additions to the Letter on\nsentiments, he revises his explanation of these mixed sentiments\nby noting that each individual representation has a subjective and an\nobjective component (for a valuable account of Mendelssohn’s\ndeveloping conception of mixed sentiments, see Pollok 2018a).\nSubjectively or “as a determination of the soul,” the\nrepresentation can affirm some perfection in the soul and thus be\npleasing, even though objectively or “as a picture of the\nobject,” we might find it repugnant. Tragedy is more complicated\nsince the sympathy that we feel for the tragic figure is based upon\nboth objective and subjective perfections (i.e., in him or her and us)\nas well as upon objective imperfection, the pain and injustice that\nbefall him or her. \nMendelssohn gives another twist to his interpretation of “mixed\nsentiments” in the Rhapsody and then later in “On\nthe Sublime and the Naïve in the Fine Sciences.”\nExperiences of the sheer immensities of things — “the\nunfathomable world of the sea, a far-reaching plain, the innumerable\nlegions of stars, the eternity of time, every height and depth that\nexhausts us” (Philosophical Writings, p. 144) —\nsometimes make us tremble, but we still find them alluring. It is\ngratifying to experience them, though they confirm an imperfection as\nwell as a perfection in us. In “On the Sublime,”\nMendelssohn further distinguishes beauty as something bounded from\nimmensity as something unbounded. He then distinguishes extended from\nnon-extended (intensive) immensity. The sea’s unfathomableness\nwould be an example of extended immensity in nature; uniform\nrepetition of temporal intervals in music would be an example of an\nattempt to represent the experience of an extended immensity in art.\nBut Mendelssohn seems to be more interested in the non-extended or\nintensive immensities. “Power, genius, virtue have their\nunextended immensity that likewise arouses a spine-tingling sentiment\nbut has the advantage of not ending, through tedious uniformity, in\nsatiation and even disgust, as generally happens in the case of the\nextended immensity” (Philosophical Writings, p. 194).\nMendelssohn then introduces the category of sublimity for the perfect\nrepresentation of such intensive immensity, a representation that\nproduces awe precisely because it passes beyond our customary\nexpectations. For an insightful treatment of Mendelssohn’s view\nof mixed sentiments as “a complex account of the multiple\nsources of aesthetic responses to art,” see Guyer 2011. \nThere is one last aspect of Mendelssohn’s aesthetics that\ndeserves mention, not least for its bearing on subsequent developments\nin aesthetics. It has already been noted that the pleasures of beauty\nand sublimity are not to be identified as purely sensuous or purely\nintellectual pleasures. In keeping with this differentiation,\nMendelssohn differentiates the sort of approval involved in aesthetic\nexperiences from knowledge or desire, though he insists that aesthetic\nfeelings of pleasure can, nonetheless, serve “as the transition\n(Uebergang) as it were from knowing to desiring”\n(Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, pp. 61f; Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 169, 307–310). In his adoption of three\ndistinct capacities of the mind and in his appraisal of the aesthetic\ndimension as providing a bridge between matters of truth and falsity\n(capacities of knowing) and matters of good and evil (capacities of\ndesiring), Mendelssohn plainly anticipates central aspects of\nKant’s mature, critical philosophy. A further, though less\nprecise similarity also deserves mention, namely, the likeness between\nKant’s conception of the disinterested character of experience\nof the beautiful and Mendelssohn’s conception of the experience\nas something affording us a pleasure that is neither simply sensuous\nor intellectual. “We consider the beauty of nature and art with\npleasure and satisfaction, without the slightest movement of desire.\nInstead, it appears to be a particular mark of beauty that it is\nconsidered with tranquil satisfaction; that it pleases if we also do\nnot possess it and we are still far removed from demanding to possess\nit” (Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p. 61;\nPhilosophical Writings, pp. 34–51). For a more detailed\nreview of the robust affinities of Kant’s aesthetics with\nMendelssohn’s (despite Kant’s rejection of perfectionism\nin aesthetics) together with a discussion of certain advantages of\nMendelssohn’s aesthetics in contrast to Kant’s, see Guyer\n2018b. \nIn Jerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism Mendelssohn\ndistinguishes church and state in order to demonstrate the salutary\nharmony between them and thus the need for tolerance. In the first\npart of the essay he accordingly argues that neither the state nor\nreligion can legitimately coerce human conscience and, in the second\npart, he maintains that this argument against “religious\npower” is supported by Judaism. The second point was no less\ncontroversial than the first, especially since many Jewish elders and\nrabbis maintained a right to excommunicate. But Mendelssohn counters\n— apparently erroneously — that the practice is not\ninherent in “ancient, original Judaism” but rather\nborrowed in the course of time from Christianity. \nFar from separating temporal and spiritual concerns to distinguish\nstate and church (as Locke did), Mendelssohn insists that “our\nwelfare in this life is … one and the same as [our] eternal\nfelicity in the future” (Jerusalem (1983), p. 39). Nor\ndoes he base the distinction between church and state on the\ndifference between convictions and actions. “Both state and\nchurch have as their object actions as well as convictions, the former\ninsofar as they are based on the relations between man and nature, the\nlatter insofar as they are based on the relations between nature and\nGod” (Jerusalem (1983), p. 56f). As far as convictions\nare concerned, neither church nor state can coerce; “for\nhere,” as noted earlier, “the state has no other means of\nacting effectively than the church does. Both must teach, instruct,\nencourage, motivate” (Jerusalem (1983), p. 61). What\ncontributes mightily to their potential for mutual reinforcement is\nthe fact that there is also no difference in the make-up of the\nconvictions and duties themselves. The only difference between church\nand state in the matter of convictions is their ultimate sanction.\nThus, the moral philosopher will arrive at the same system of duties\nas the person who sees them as expressions of the divine; religion\n“only gives those same duties and obligations a more exalted\nsanction” (Jerusalem (1983), p. 58). Matters\nare different when it comes to actions where the state can and must\ncoerce, namely, when society’s size and complexity “make\nit impossible to govern by convictions alone, [and] the state will\nhave to resort to public measures, coercive laws, punishments of\ncrime, and rewards of merit” (Jerusalem (1983), p. 43).\nHerein lies for Mendelssohn the basic difference between state and\nchurch: civil society has, as the product of a social contract, the\nright to coercion, religious society has no such right. “The\nstate has physical power and uses it when necessary; the\npower of religion is love and beneficence”\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 45). \nInsofar as Mendelssohn’s argument for religious tolerance has a\nreligious premise, i.e., insofar as duties to others are founded upon\nthe relation to God (“the more exalted sanction,” cited\nabove), it is less advantageous, it has been argued, than Kant’s\nargument that rests simply on the innate right to freedom (Guyer\n2018c). An analogous challenge from a Kantian perspective concerns the\nimplications of Mendelssohn’s defense of speculation as a source\nof reason’s authority for his view of history.\nMendelssohn’s rejection of the idea of moral progress in history\nand Kant’s endorsement of the idea coincide, it is argued (Sweet\n2018), precisely with the contrast between Mendelssohn’s\nacceptance of an authority external to reason and Kant’s\ninsistence upon a self-legislating reason. \nIn Jerusalem, Mendelssohn argues that Judaism is, at bottom,\na natural religion, containing no revealed truths not available to\nunaided reason. Occasionally, as Allan Arkush points out\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 20), he speaks more guardedly,\nrestricting this claim to the “essentials” of Judaism.\nEven with such qualifications, however, it is apparent that\nMendelssohn approaches Judaism and its history with a more or less\nDeist view that the original, ancient faith confirmed nothing more\nthan rational truths. Nonetheless, he combines this rationalist\napproach with a conception of revelation that underscores the\ndistinctiveness of Judaism and secures Jewish believers their destiny\nas God’s chosen people. For, while the Sinaitic revelation\ncontains no supernatural truths, it does prescribe a way of life, the\npractice of which stands to benefit all mankind. (The interpretation\nof revelation strictly as legislation and not as adding to the store\nof truths is very likely borrowed, with qualifications, from Spinoza).\n“Judaism boasts of no exclusive revelation of eternal\ntruths that are indispensable to salvation, of no revealed religion in\nthe sense in which that term is usually understood. Revealed\nreligion is one thing, revealed legislation,\nanother” (Jerusalem (1983), p. 97). \nMendelssohn finds linguistic considerations at the very heart of\ntraditional philosophical questions. As noted above (“2.\nMetaphysics and epistemology”), in the Prize Essay he\nregards metaphysics’ greater reliance upon arbitrary signs as\none reason for its slow progress (relative to that in mathematics) and\nin Morning Hours he indicates his inclination to regard\ndisputes over idealism as purely verbal. Joining these remarks about\nthe import of language for philosophy are two main treatments of\nlanguage, one at the beginning, the other at the end of his career. At\nthe outset he critically addresses Rousseau’s views on the\norigin of language in the context of the Berlin Academy’s essay\ncompetitions on language (see Sendschreiben an den Herrn Magister\nLessing in Leipzig, the appendix to the translation of\nRousseau’s Discours sur les origins de\nl’inégalité (1756), and Mendelssohn’s\nreview of Michaelis’ prize-winning essay (1759) in Briefe,\ndie neueste Literatur betreffend and “Über die\nSprache” (circa 1759)). Michaelis won the Academy’s prize\nfor answering its question: “Quelle est l’influence\nréciproque des opinions d’un people sur le langage et du\nlangage sur les opinions?”). Mendelssohn takes issue both with\nRousseau’s attempt to explain the origin of human language on\nthe basis of a description of the natural condition that human beings\nshare with other animals and with his neglect of any consideration of\nthe providential character of the development of language\n(Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, p. 27). In these early writings on\nlanguage, Mendelssohn emphasizes the interdependence of language and\nits development with the development of innate, divinely-endowed\ncapacities. These capacities include not only reason as the ability to\ngrasp conceptual connections and employ arbitrary signs\n(Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, pp. 9f), but also — in\ntandem with the development of rational capacities — the\ncapacity for compassionate interaction in familial and social\nsettings. Thus, on the one hand, the recurrence of auditory, visual,\nand gesticular phenomena enables reason to signify phenomena bearing\nno resemblance to them and, indeed, to do so in a way decidedly\ndifferent from how other animals instinctively employ natural,\nimitative signs (Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, p. 10). In this\nmanner Mendelssohn underlines the interdependence of reason and\nlanguage, understood as the use of arbitrary signs. On the other hand,\nlanguage develops within a process that is social as well as cognitive\nand the starting point for the investigation of its origins is the\nfamily rather than the individual. Borrowing from Condillac and\nchallenging Rousseau’s view of language as primarily a tool for\nsocialization, Mendelssohn writes: “The drive to social life is\nequally innate in human beings and leads immediately to the occasion\nfor exercising the capacity for language”(Gesammelte\nSchriften 6/2, p. 8). \nIn Jerusalem, toward the end of his career, Mendelssohn\nreturns to the subject of language in the context of articulating the\nsense in which Judaism is — for good reasons — a religion\nof the spoken rather than the written word, relying on an a living\ntradition to transmit and interpret divine legislation. In this\ncontext Mendelssohn again emphasizes the fundamentally social\ncharacter of language in the context of the performance of rituals,\nwhile calling attention to both the feebleness of ostensive definition\nand the fraught prospects for maintaining the same reference for words\nover time. In the course of arguing that human reason does not need\nsupernatural revelation in order to recognize the eternal truths\nindispensable to its happiness, Mendelssohn notes that Judaism relies,\nnot upon written phrases or formulations that are “established\nforever, immutable,” but instead upon a “living tradition\npassed on by oral instruction,” capable of keeping pace with\nchanging times and circumstances (Jerusalem (1983), p. 97f,\n102f (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8,\npp. 160, 168). Judaism is thus for Mendelssohn primarily a religion of\nthe spoken word precisely as a means of maintaining its relevance to\nreal life in changing, historical contexts and maintaining the\npersonal bonds and Jewish identity among its members.  \nMendelssohn adds a further reason for insisting that Judaism is a\nreligion of the spoken word, precisely as a supernatural legislation\nrather than a revealed religion. The constant attention paid to the\nwritten word not only can isolate human beings from one another and\nspeculation from practice, but also can induce a kind of idolatry.\nFrozen in time, the written word can become an idol itself, obscuring\nthe distinction between itself and what it is meant to signify (see\nFreudenthal (2012), pp. 105–134). \nIn this connection Mendelssohn conjectures that written language\nemerged in the course of the development of visible signs, beginning\nwith a form of synecdoche where a concrete object reawakens the\nthought of a particular characteristic, e.g., a dog as a sign of\nfidelity. While the move from these objects to images of them and\nultimately to hieroglyphics seems natural enough, Mendelssohn muses\nthat the transition from hieroglyphics to a written alphabet\n“required a leap,” far beyond ordinary human powers\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 108/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p.\n174). Nonetheless, it is written language’s hieroglyphic origins\nthat Mendelssohn credits with the potential for superstition,\nidolatry, and speculative excess. Because hieroglyphic signs have no\nprototype in nature, they provided potent material for superstition\nand, indeed, Mendelssohn refers to the need for written signs as\n“the first occasion [Veranlassung] for idolatry”\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 113 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p. 179). \nIn the second chapter of Jerusalem, this general account of\nlanguage and its development figures prominently in an argument that\nJudaism is a form of supernatural legislation rather than revelation.\nBy regarding language as primarily a living dialogue between persons,\nJudaism does not lose sight of its communicative function for the sake\nof thought. As a result, theory and speculation remain tied to\nhistorical practice and concrete action. Not coincidentally, the\nlanguage of Judaism is primarily prescriptive rather than descriptive;\neven its written prescriptions are “largely incomprehensible\nwithout unwritten commentaries … transmitted by oral\ninstruction.” Hence, the use of language in Judaism — its\nscript and ceremonial laws — fends off the all too human\ntendency to idolize the language itself. \nThe appeal to tradition (oral instruction) is necessary, Mendelssohn\nadds, given the fact that, over the course of time, the laws\nthemselves become unintelligible “since no words or letters\nretain their sense unchanged from one generation to the next”\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 128 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p. 193). In chapter 1 of\nJerusalem he makes a similar claim after noting (a) the\nelusiveness of inner perceptions to the perceiver herself and (b) the\nimpossibility of two people using the same words to express the same\n“inner perceptions” (Jerusalem (1983), p.\n66/Gesammelte Schriften 8, pp. 133f). Where the words in\nquestion designate inner perceptions, there is no possibility of\nostensive definition, no more when uttered today than when uttered\nages ago. Indeed, in a passage that suggests both the inscrutability\nand endless deferral of reference, Mendelssohn observes that\n“words cannot be explained [erläutert] by\nthings. Instead, we must again have recourse to signs and\nwords and, ultimately, to metaphors” (Jerusalem (1983),\np. 66/Gesammelte Schriften 8, pp. 133f). Nonetheless,\nMendelssohn is more confident about words designating objects of\nexternal perceptions and about the prospects for mutual understanding\nin regard to them. Not incidentally, ceremonial law’s ritualized\ncharacter calls for a recurrent context (including specific objects\nand persons) available to external perception in the course of an\nexchange between persons (including God). Notably, ‘you’\nand ‘we’ take precedence over ‘I’ and\n‘it’ in such contexts, as the living references of the\nformer indexicals enables one to refer effectively to oneself and to\nthings generally. \nThus, in Jerusalem Mendelssohn stresses the ritual and\nperformative character of language, thereby complementing his view of\nthe inextricability of language and a reason that tempers speculation\nwith common sense. The mature Mendelssohn, keenly aware of the perils\nof ostension in determining reference, tempers the claims of\nspeculation with those of common sense and is more concerned with\nbridging theory and practice in the rites of language than in the\nclaims of pure theory. Nor should it be forgotten that\nMendelssohn’s recognition of language’s basically\nritualistic and empathic character, as a springboard to reason, is\nrooted in what he regards as the possibilities of Judaism. \nMendelssohn enjoyed, as noted at the outset, a lifelong friendship\nwith G. E. Lessing. In addition to their work as co-editors, Lessing\nanonymously published Mendelssohn’s earliest works and\ncollaborated with him on the piece: Pope, a Metaphysician!\nThrough his popular plays, his influential work as a dramaturg, and\nhis stormy public debates with orthodox Lutheran clergy, Lessing was a\nparticularly daunting and engaging spokesman for the German\nEnlightenment, making him all the more dangerous to its opponents. His\nfinal work, Nathan the Wiseman, fittingly portrays a Jewish\nsage (presumably modeled on Mendelssohn) who makes a poignant plea for\ntolerance by arguing that the differences among religions are\nessentially matters of history and not reason. Along with Mendelssohn,\nLessing embraced the idea of a purely rational religion and would\nendorse Mendelssohn’s declaration: “My religion recognizes\nno obligation to resolve doubt other than through rational means; and\nit commands no mere faith in eternal truths” (Gesammelte\nSchriften, Volume 3/2, p. 205). To pietists of the day, such\ndeclarations were scandalous subterfuges of an Enlightenment project\nof assimilating religion to natural reason. Mention has already been\nmade of Lavater’s attempt to draw Mendelssohn into religious\ndebate. While Mendelssohn skillfully avoided that confrontation, he\nfound himself reluctantly unable to remain silent when, after\nLessing’s death, F. H. Jacobi contended that Lessing embraced\nSpinoza’s pantheism and thus exemplified the\nEnlightenment’s supposedly inevitable descent into\nirreligion. \nFollowing private correspondence with Jacobi on the issue and an\nextended period when Jacobi (in personal straits at the time) did not\nrespond to his objections, Mendelssohn attempted to set the record\nstraight about Lessing’s Spinozism in Morning Hours.\nLearning of Mendelssohn’s plans incensed Jacobi who expected to\nbe consulted first and who accordingly responded by publishing,\nwithout Mendelssohn’s consent, their correspondence —\nOn the Teaching of Spinoza in Letters to Mr. Moses\nMendelssohn — a month before the publication of Morning\nHours. Distressed on personal as well as intellectual levels by\nthe controversy over his departed friend’s pantheism,\nMendelssohn countered with a hastily composed piece, To the\nFriends of Lessing: an Appendix to Mr. Jacobi’s Correspondence\non the Teaching of Spinoza. According to legend, so anxious was\nMendelssohn to get the manuscript to the publisher that, forgetting\nhis overcoat on a bitterly cold New Year’s eve, he delivered the\nmanuscript on foot to the publisher. That night he came down with a\ncold from which he died four days later, prompting his friends to\ncharge Jacobi with responsibility for Mendelssohn’s death. \nThe sensationalist character of the controversy should not obscure the\nsubstance and importance of Mendelssohn’s debate with Jacobi.\nJacobi had contended that Spinozism is the only consistent position\nfor a metaphysics based upon reason alone and that the only solution\nto this metaphysics so detrimental to religion and morality is a leap\nof faith, that salto mortale that poor Lessing famously\nrefused to make. Mendelssohn counters Jacobi’s first contention\nby attempting to demonstrate the metaphysical inconsistency of\nSpinozism. He takes aim at Jacobi’s second contention by\ndemonstrating how the “purified Spinozism” or\n“refined pantheism” embraced by Lessing is, in the end,\nonly nominally different from theism and thus a threat neither to\nreligion nor to morality. \nMendelssohn’s criticisms of Spinoza are discussed below but\nfirst the complexity of his relationship to Spinoza should be noted.\nIn his first publication, Dialogues (1761) he argued that\nmany of Spinoza’s views were compatible with “true\nphilosophy and religion.” In Mendelssohn’s mind, Leibniz\nmay have given that “true philosophy” its sharpest\nformulation but in all likelihood by deriving its central idea of a\npreestablished harmony from Spinoza. Moreover, as Mendelssohn puts it,\nSpinoza does not so much deny the distinctiveness of the actual world\nas construe it as it is in the mind of God before the creation,\nexisting only as a part of God (Philosophical Writings,\n102ff, 108ff). A quarter of a century later, Mendelssohn recapitulates\nthe latter argument as the key to understanding a\n“purified” or “refined” Spinozism that\nLessing, at least in the realm of philosophical debate, would not have\ndismissed out of hand. \nNevertheless, as noted above, part of his response to Jacobi consists\nin demonstrating the shortcomings of Spinoza’s philosophy. As\nmight be expected, he criticizes Spinoza’s idea that there is\nonly one, infinite, and necessary substance. The idea is arbitrary,\nMendelssohn contends, since one can legitimately distinguish between\nwhat is independent or self-standing (das Selbständige)\nand what obtains or persists for itself (das\nFürsichbestehende). “Instead of proving that\neverything obtaining for itself is only one, he [Spinoza] establishes\nin the end only that everything independent is one. Instead of\ndemonstrating that the entire aggregate of everything finite\nconstitutes a single self-standing substance, he merely shows that\nthis aggregate must depend upon the sole infinite substance”\n(Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p. 107). \nOn a “deeper level,” as Mendelssohn puts it, he also takes\nissue with Spinoza for failing to account for what Mendelssohn deems\nthe “formal” aspects of both corporeal and spiritual\nworlds. Thus, Spinoza’s conception of extension in terms of\nimpenetrability may explain “the essence of matter,” but\nit leaves unexplained, Mendelssohn contends, the particular\norganization and movement of bodies. What is unclear to Mendelssohn is\nhow parts can be in motion if the whole upon which they completely\ndepend (Spinoza’s substance) is not in motion. Similarly, he\nwants to know how, on the basis of Spinoza’s account of the\nsupposedly underlying attribute of extension, those parts come to have\nthe particular form and organization of motions and forces that they\nhave, that is to say, as organic, self-regulating entities.\n“Where can the origin of this [motion and form] be found?”\nhe asks. “Not in the whole, since the whole has no movement. The\nsum [Sämmtliche] of all bodies, untied into a single\nsubstance, cannot change place and has neither organization nor\nfigure…. Whence the form in the parts, if the whole provides no\nsource for this?” (Gesammelte Schriften, 3/2, p.\n108). \nJust as Spinoza explains the matter but not the form of the physical\nworld, so, too, Mendelssohn charges, he gives an account of the matter\nbut not the form of the spiritual world. In this connection it is\nhelpful to recall Mendelssohn’s differentiation of knowing,\napproving, and desiring from one another. Truth and falsity,\ncorresponding to knowing, provide the matter of the spiritual world.\nWhile they may, as Spinoza maintains, have their origin in thought as\nthe attribute of a single, infinite substance, categories\ncorresponding not to knowledge but to approving or desiring must have\nsome other source. Thus, according to Mendelssohn, Spinoza leaves\nunexplained “the difference between good and evil, desirable and\nundesirable, pleasure and pain” (Gesammelte Schriften,\nIII/2, p. 109). \nYet, while some of these criticisms of Spinoza may be compelling, they\ndo not, Mendelssohn recognizes, carry the day for a refined Spinozist\nor pantheist. Spinoza’s inability to explain how movement and\nvalues derive from the attributes of the one, infinite substance does\nnot, by itself, establish the theist explanation in\nMendelssohn’s view. Accordingly, in Morning Hours he\ncasts Lessing as the spokesperson for a refined pantheism — a\nmove that figures prominently in this contribution to the\nPantheismusstreit. Lessing is portrayed as someone who, while\nagreeing with Mendelssohn’s theist position, has a knack for\ngiving every reasonable argument its full due. In this context Lessing\npresents a pantheism that characterizes the one and only substance,\nnot only as a source of motion and desire, but also as capable of\nrepresenting every possibility to itself and approving that\npossibility that constitutes “the best and most perfect series\nof things” (Morning Hours, p. 84/Gesammelte\nSchriften 3/2, p. 115). In other words, refined pantheism\nincludes every aspect of the entire metaphysical system of theism but\ncasts it solely as the object of divine intellect. As a result, a\nrefined Spinozist might wonder how different the positions are since\nthe theist purports to explain these seemingly recalcitrant phenomena\nmerely by appealing to the divine will. A refined pantheist might\naccept the difference between the world (thought) and God (thinker) at\na certain level, but insist that, in the end, the difference is on a\nmerely abstract level since thinking and thought can only be\ndistinguished as long as one is not actually thinking. After all,\n“who is to tell us that we ourselves and the world surrounding\nus have something more to them than the thoughts of God and\nmodifications of his original power?” (Morning Hours,\np. 84 (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften,\n3/2, p. 116). To pretend to show that there is something that can be\npredicated of things outside God that cannot be predicated of the\ndivine thoughts of those things is to deny divine omniscience. \nBut, without further qualifications, this pantheist line of reasoning\nis faulty, Mendelssohn submits, for at least three reasons. In the\nfirst place, it abolishes a distinction presupposed by any truthful\nstatement, i.e., the distinction between original and copy. Secondly,\nthere are indefeasible marks that distinguish a finite\nself-consciousness (as an object and original) from the divine\nrepresentation (copy) of it. “Consciousness of myself, combined\nwith complete ignorance of everything that does not fall within my\nsphere of thinking, is the most telling proof of my substantiality\noutside God, of my original existence” (Morning Hours,\np. 85 (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften,\n3/2, p. 118). Finally, the pantheist confuses divine knowledge with\ndivine approval. God knows perfectly well my shortcomings without\napproving them and requiring their existence. Moreover, that they are\nthinkable hardly explains their existence since the opposite of them\nis just as thinkable. The problem for the pantheist, Mendelssohn\nsubmits, is explaining their existence, i.e., explaining what\nprivileges some divine thoughts over others. \nFor the theist, by contrast, there is a ready solution to the problem.\n“The thoughts of God that come to reality to the exclusion of\nthe rest will have this prerogative by virtue of their relative\ngoodness and purposiveness, insofar, namely, as they correspond thus\nand not otherwise, here and now, to the idea of the perfect and\nbest” (Morning Hours, p. 89/Gesammelte\nSchriften 3/2, p. 122). \nStill, the difference between the theist and a refined pantheist is by\nno means this simple, Mendelssohn is quick to add. To be sure, Spinoza\nconceived intellect and will as one and the same. Nevertheless, at\nleast as Lessing understood him, Spinoza also differentiated\nacquaintance with what is true from acquaintance with what is good and\nidentified knowledge of the good with the “will” insofar\nas through it one thought does have a prerogative over another.\nPantheism, so refined, secures religion and morality no less than\ntheism does, such that, assuming as much, Mendelssohn is led to ask:\n“in what way now does the system defended by my friend [Lessing]\ndiffer from ours?” (Morning Hours, p. 89/Gesammelte\nSchriften, 3/2, p. 123). Seen in this light, the difference\nbetween theism and refined pantheism turns in the end on a speculative\nsubtlety without practical consequences, namely, on different\ninterpretations of the metaphor of divine light. Mendelssohn\naccordingly concludes that, like many another dispute in metaphysics\nand epistemology, the dispute between refined pantheists and\ntraditional theists is purely verbal.","contact.mail":"dahlstro@bu.edu","contact.domain":"bu.edu"}]
