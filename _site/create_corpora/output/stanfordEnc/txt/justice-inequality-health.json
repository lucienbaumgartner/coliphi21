Among American women,\nthe corresponding difference in life expectancy is 12.8 years,\nalthough the worst-off group of women is low-income southern rural\nblacks (‘America 7’) rather than high-risk urban blacks\n(‘America 8’).  On the face of it, these inequalities in\nAmerican life expectancy are seriously unjust.\n\n\n\nIf one turns to the international context, inequalities in life\nexpectancy of a similar magnitude can be observed even between the\nworst-off countries and the global average: In 2011, life expectancy\nin 19 countries was 15 years or more below the global life expectancy\nof 70 years; and this global average was itself 13 years below life\nexpectancy in Japan and Switzerland, which had the highest national\naverages of all (WHO 2013, Table 1).\n\n\n\nBut whether the appearances of injustice here will withstand close\nscrutiny is a separate question.  Not all inequalities in life\nexpectancy seem unjust.  For example, in 2010, life expectancy for all\nAmerican women was 80.9 years, whereas for all American men it was\nonly 76.3 years (Wang et al., 2013). Presumably, little (if any) of\nthis 4.6 year inequality in life expectancy represents an\ninjustice. However, if some inequalities in health are not unjust,\nthen inequalities in health are not unjust per se.\n\n\n\nSo what makes a health inequality an injustice, when it is one? Do\nhealth inequalities have some significance in justice that\ndiffers from other important inequalities? Or is the injustice of an\nunjust inequality in health simply due to the application of general\nprinciples of equality and justice to the case of health?\n\n\n\nTo answer these questions, one has to examine two rather different\nliteratures. On the one hand, there is an empirical literature\nconcerning the underlying determinants of health and, on the other\nhand, there is a philosophical literature concerned with the ethics of\npopulation health. The former literature is considerably more\nextensive and developed than the latter. Even there, however, the\nanswers on offer are hardly complete or fully established.\n\n\n\nIntuitively, if a given inequality in life expectancy is inevitable,\nthen it is not unjust. A plausible necessary condition, that\nis, on a particular inequality's being unjust is that the\ninequality in question is avoidable. To the extent, for example, that\nsome biological necessity underlies the widely observed inequality in\nlife expectancy between men and women, this particular gender\ninequality in health does not qualify as an injustice. (Indeed, Sen\n1992 famously relies upon an estimate of some such biologically\nnecessary inequality, as part of an argument criticizing the treatment\nof women in countries where the inequality in life expectancy actually\nfavours men). A first step, therefore, in analysing the\npossible injustice of an inequality in health is to establish that the\ninequality is avoidable. This, in turn, requires some understanding of\nthe underlying determinants (or causes) of health. \n\nMore specifically, it requires an understanding of the subset of\ndeterminants of health that are socially controllable. Some very\nimportant determinants of health — notably, biology and luck\n— are not socially controllable; and precisely for that reason,\ninequalities in health caused by biology or luck are unavoidable (and\nhence, not unjust). Most of the empirical literature concentrates on\nwhat are known as ‘the social determinants’ of health. In\nthis context, a social determinant of health is a socially\ncontrollable factor outside the traditional health care system that is\nan independent partial cause of an individual's health\nstatus. Candidate examples include income, education, occupational\nrank, and social class. \nHealth care (personal medical care and public health) is clearly an\nadditional socially controllable determinant of health.  Nevertheless,\nfor different reasons, in both the empirical and the philosophical\nliteratures, health care is something of a separate\ntopic. Accordingly, we shall touch on it only briefly. In the public\nhealth literature, variations in access to health care are not\nregarded as a significant contributor to inequalities in health. (For\na brief corrective against the natural tendency to reserve a\nprivileged position for health care here, see Marmot and Wilkinson\n1999, ch. 1). But to recognise that there are social determinants of\nhealth, in the sense we have defined, is not to deny the importance of\nhealth care as another partial cause.  Whether universal access to health care reduces inequalities in\nhealth significantly or not, there is a widespread conviction that it\nis a requirement of justice. Indeed, the development of a rationale\nfor universal access to health care (as a requirement of justice) has\nbeen the traditional focus of philosophical reflection on health and\njustice. The most well-known rationale is the equality of opportunity\nargument developed by Norman Daniels (1985; 2008).  On this argument,\nan individual's entitlement to health care rests on the instrumental\ncontribution that good health makes to preserving her fair share of\nopportunity. Since Daniels' rationale does ultimately turn on the\nclaim that universal access reduces inequalities in health, it is open\nto empirical criticism on this point (Sreenivasan 2001; 2007a). \n\nAnother prominent rationale is the prudent insurance argument (Dworkin\n2000, ch. 8; Gibbard 1984). Here the individual's entitlement to\nhealth care rests on the proposition that, under certain idealized\nconditions, it would be prudentially rational of her to spend some of\nher fair share of income on a decent minimum of health care\ninsurance. A third rationale for universal access to health care has\nbeen offered by Allen Buchanan (1984). His argument has two\ndistinctive features. On the one hand, it allows the justification for\nproviding an individual with health care to vary across\nindividuals—universal coverage is justified by\nstitching together a patchwork quilt, as it were, of different\njustifications. On the other hand, it eschews egalitarian premises\n(there is no appeal to a ‘fair share’ of\nanything)—in fact, its largest ‘patch’ is provided\nby an argument from enforced beneficence that rests on explicitly\nlibertarian premises. (See the entry on\n justice and access to health care.)\n \n\nThe empirical literature's most significant and powerful\nreported finding can actually be replicated with any of the\nlisted candidate social determinants of health (income, education,\noccupational rank, social class): This is the existence, within a\ngiven society, of a social gradient in health. The most\nsignificant evidence on the relation between a socially controllable\nfactor and health comes from the Whitehall studies, conducted in\nEngland by Michael Marmot and his colleagues (1978). In these studies,\nthe candidate social determinant of health is occupational rank. \n\nBetween 1967 and 1969, Marmot examined some 18,000 male civil servants\naged between 40 and 69 years old. By placing a flag on their records\nat the National Health Service (NHS) Central Registry, Marmot was able\nto track the cause and date of death for each subject who later\ndied. His data are unusually good data. To begin with, they are\ngenerated from data-points on specific individuals. Each datum reports\nthe relation between the occupational rank of a particular person and\nthe life-span (and cause of death) of the very same person. By\ncontrast, almost every other study begins from aggregate data. In\naddition, a number of important background factors are held constant\nfor this study population. Notably, all the subjects in this study are\nstably employed, they live in the same region (greater London), and\nall have free access to health care provided by the NHS.  Figure 1 presents the Whitehall data after 25 years of follow-up\n(van Rossum et al. 2000, 181). It reports age adjusted all-cause\nmortality rate ratios by employment grade, for three periods of\nfollow-up. A mortality rate ratio reports the proportion of deaths in\na given group divided by the proportion of deaths in the reference\ngroup. There are four grades in the British Civil Service employment\nhierarchy: administrative (highest), professional/executive, clerical,\nand ‘other’ (lowest). The professional/executive grade has\nbeen used as the reference group, so its mortality rate ratio is 1.0\nby definition. \n\nFigure 1. Social gradient in total mortality, Whitehall 25 year\nfollow-up \n\nThe striking and important feature of these data is that the\nrelationship between employment grade and mortality exhibits a marked\ngradient. It is natural to think that, below some threshold\nof deprivation, there will be disproportionate ill-health. Yet, in\nthis study population, there is no deprivation, not even in the lowest\ngrade (where everyone is still a government employee with free access\nto health care).  Furthermore, and notably, there is no\nthreshold. Rather, there is a step-wise improvement in health\noutcomes as one climbs the employment grade ladder. In addition, these\ngradients persist even after the mortality rates have been adjusted\nfor standard risk factors. For example, coronary heart disease (CHD)\naccounted for 43 percent of the deaths in the Whitehall study at 10\nyears of follow-up (Marmot et al. 1984, 1003). Standard risk factors\nfor CHD include smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar\nlevels, and height. Figure 2 presents the Whitehall data on mortality\nfrom CHD after 25 years of follow-up (Marmot 2000, 363). It reports\nrelative rates of death from CHD by employment grade, with\nadministrators having a rate of 1.0 by definition.  The left bar in\neach pair displays the relative rate adjusted for age alone, while the\nright bar adjusts it for all the standard risk factors. Correcting for\nstandard risk factors does explain some of the gradient in CHD\nmortality, but no more than a third. The remaining gradient is still\nmarked. \n\nFigure 2. Risk factor adjusted social gradient in CHD mortality,\nWhitehall 25 year follow-up \n\nThe existence of a social gradient in health certainly suggests that\nsomething in addition to health care exercises a powerful\ninfluence on an individual's health—something, moreover,\nthat at least correlates with a social variable.  However, it is not\nclear exactly what this something is. To begin with, similar domestic\ngradients in individual life expectancy can be found when the social\nvariable is income (McDonough et al. 1997); when it is\neducation (Huisman et al. 2005; Crimmins and Saito 2001; Elo\nand Preston 1996; Kunst and Mackenbach 1994); and when it is\nsocial class (Wilkinson and Marmot 2003).  By itself, therefore, the surface fact of a social gradient in\nhealth is compatible with quite different accounts of the underlying\ncausal influences on individual health. Each distinct social variable\nmight function as a ‘marker’ for a different underlying\ncausal factor, different social variables might function instead as\nalternative markers for the same underlying causal factor, or there\nmay be some mixture of both. (It is also possible that some social\nvariables — e.g., education [see Cutler et al. 2011] —\nfunction as a relatively direct causal factor.)  Furthermore, it is not clear how much of the correlation between\nhealth and a given social variable is properly causal in the first\nplace. In some cases, there is clearly some ‘reverse\ncausation’ between health and a social variable, notably from\npoor health to lower income (Deaton 2002). In addition, there is\nplainly some causation among social variables, notably from education\nboth to higher income and to higher occupational status.  \n\nThe choice of the social variable in terms of which to describe some\nsocial gradient in health can be made on a number of different\ngrounds. One obvious ground would be to choose the variable(s) that\ncame closest to conveying the operative causal mechanism(s).  Another\nground would be to choose the variable(s) that have independent moral\nsignificance, such as race and gender. These grounds need not exclude\neach other and there may be a case for choosing the same variable on\nboth grounds. The second ground acquires a special relevance if health\ninequalities suffered by individuals who also suffer, for example,\nfrom racial discrimination are more unjust than health inequalities\n(of the same magnitude) suffered in the absence of racial\ndiscrimination. If one injustice can compound another, then the choice\nof social variable may affect the kind of inequality in\nhealth at issue, and not simply its magnitude. \n\nWhen the social variable is income, there is an important\nfurther definitional dispute to consider. Income appears to have a\nsignificant effect on life expectancy, even controlling for education\n(Backlund et al. 1999). However, there is an on-going debate about\nwhich definition of ‘income’ is adequate to capture the\ncontribution individual income makes to individual life expectancy\n(see the sample of articles collected in Kawachi et al. 1999).\nAccording to the absolute income hypothesis, the contribution\nincome makes to individual life expectancy is entirely a function of\nthe individual's non-comparative income. By contrast, the\nrelative income hypothesis holds, roughly, that an\nindividual's life expectancy is also a function of the\nrelative level of her income—that is, its level\ncompared to others' income in her society—and not simply\nof its non-comparative level (Wilkinson 1996). To make this second\nhypothesis precise requires one, among other things, to specify the\nreference group to which the individual's income is compared and\nalso the nature of the comparison (for examples, see Deaton 2003). For\nan overview of this debate and the state of evidence, see Sreenivasan\n(2009a). \n\nOur discussion thus far has implicitly proceeded on the assumption\nthat inequalities in health are defined in terms of membership in some\nsocial group or other (one of the ‘eight\nAmericas,’ e.g., or some occupational rank in the Whitehall\nhierarchy). An ‘inequality’ in health, so defined, is a\ndifference between the health status of two groups, with the identity\nof the group following from the choice of the social variable with\nwhich health is correlated.  While this is how most of the discussion\nin the literature on health inequalities is actually structured, the\ndefinition is controversial. Notably, Christopher Murray and\ncolleagues (1999) argue in favour of an alternative methodology, in\nwhich ‘health inequality’ refers to ‘the variation\nin health status across individuals in a population’ (537),\nrather than to a difference in health status between social\ngroups.  Stimulated in large part by their article and the reaction to it,\nanother lively debate considers the basic conceptual question of how\nhealth inequalities should be defined in the first place (for a nice\noverview, see Asada 2013).  Should they be defined across social\ngroups?  Or across individuals instead? It helps to consider this\nquestion on two separate levels.  Let us call the first one the\n‘fundamental moral level’ and let us assume that, on this\nlevel, the individual is the basic unit of concern. \n\nNow it may seem as if this assumption compels us to define\n‘health inequality’ across individuals as well, i.e. to\nreject the conventional definition at the fundamental moral level, but\nthat is a mistake.  Daniel Hausman's (2007, 2013) position in\nthe debate illustrates this point well.  Despite affirming that the\nindividual is the fundamental unit of moral concern, he still opposes\ndefining inequalities in health across individuals.  Hausman's\ncentral claim is that ‘[individual] health inequalities are not\nthemselves pro tanto injustices’ (2013, 95).  His underlying\nargument focuses on the fact that health inequalities are only a\nsubset, as it were, of the inequalities with which justice is\nconcerned. \n\nFor ease of exposition, let us follow Hausman in assuming, more\nspecifically, that what is of fundamental concern to justice is\nindividual well-being.  Hausman's main point can then\nbe formulated as follows: Even though health is both an important\ncomponent and cause of well-being, if two individuals are unequal in\nhealth, it does not follow that they are unequal in well-being.  For\nobviously, the same two individuals may also be unequal in some other\ncomponent of well-being, and the individual who is less healthy may\nnot have less well-being overall.  For example, A may be healthier\nthan B, but B may have more friends or be more accomplished than A (or\nboth), and the latter inequality may have a greater magnitude than the\nformer (or a greater importance to well-being), so that the less\nhealthy B may still be better off overall than A (cf. Hausman 2007,\n52).  The health inequality between A and B is therefore fully\nconsistent with there being no fundamental complaint of justice about\ntheir comparative situation (at least, not on behalf of the less\nhealthy B). Hence, if permission to infer that an injustice obtains is\nbuilt into the classification ‘inequality,’ as Hausman at\nleast implicitly supposes, we should not classify any health\ndifference between A and B (or, more generally, between individuals)\nas an inequality. \n\t\t\t\t\nOf course, even on its own terms, the logic of this argument admits of\nan important exception: anytime an inequality in health between\nindividuals is such that it cannot be counter-balanced by any\ncomplementary inequality in (one or more) other components of\nwell-being—for example, because it is too large (Hausman 2007,\n54)—then that inequality in health does permit us to infer that\nthe less healthy individual also has less well-being overall.  Hausman\ncalls these special health inequalities ‘incompensable’\nand he accepts that they are immune to his objection: ‘Data\nconcerning incompensable health inequalities do permit inferences\nconcerning inequalities in welfare or standing, and they thus provide\nrelevant information for egalitarians’ (Hausman 2013, 98).\nAccordingly, he restricts the scope of his official argument, so that\nit only concerns compensable health inequalities between\nindividuals. \n\nBy contrast to (compensable) health inequalities between individuals,\nhealth inequalities between social groups typically do, in\nHausman's view, permit inferences about inequalities in overall\nwell-being.  Since that is his argument for defining ‘health\ninequality’ across social groups, it actually relies on the\nassumption that individual well-being is the fundamental unit of moral\nconcern.  ‘Information about social group health differences\nwill thus often be relevant to conclusions about justice, not because\ngroup differences matter and individual differences don't, but\nbecause information about differences in QALYs between well-studied\nsocial groups will often license conclusions about the fundamental\ninequalities that egalitarians care about’ (Hausman 2007,\n50). Strictly speaking, the conclusion thereby licensed about\ninequalities in overall well-being—either on the basis of\ninferences from social group differences in health or from\nincompensable differences in health between individuals—is that\nthe inequalities are pro tanto unjust (Hausman 2007, 52–3),\nrather than simply unjust, i.e. unjust all things considered.  That is\npresumably because inequalities in overall well-being, while\nfundamental, are still not the only things relevant to justice.  They,\ntoo, are only a subset of the considerations with which justice is\nconcerned; and so Hausman wants to leave room for the possibility that\nsome inequalities in overall well-being are nevertheless just, all\nthings considered. For example, they may be the result of free\nindividual choice (Hausman 2007, 47) or they may be a necessary\nconcomitant of some other outcome even more strongly required by\njustice (a possibility emphasised, e.g., by Deaton 2013).  (Hausman\n2007 actually uses the expression ‘prima facie’ instead of\n‘pro tanto.’ Hausman 2013 switches to ‘pro\ntanto,’ which I employ throughout). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThere are two related difficulties with Hausman's argument.  The\nfirst may be regarded as terminological.  Hausman's main point\nclearly establishes that all we are licensed to infer from an\ninequality in health between individuals is that, other things\nequal, they are unequal in well-being.  (Since other things may\nnot be equal, it does not follow that they are unequal in well-being\n‘overall’ or ‘all things considered.’) Yet\nthat is exactly what ‘pro tanto’ means.  So a\nhealth inequality between individuals does permit us to infer that\nthey are pro tanto unequal in well-being.  However, a pro tanto\ninequality in well-being is also a pro tanto injustice (certainly on\nHausman's assumptions).  Admittedly, more ‘other\nthings’ have to be held equal to qualify a health inequality as\nan injustice (than need to be held equal so to qualify an inequality\nin well-being).  But that is no reason to deny that it is a pro tanto\ninjustice.  Hence, Hausman's central claim does not follow from\nhis main point (worse, its negation does follow).  Terminology aside, it seems clear that Hausman's argument\nrequires us sharply to privilege certain conditions that need to be\nheld equal to reach a verdict of injustice (e.g., free individual\nchoice) over other such conditions (e.g., non-health components of\nwell-being).  The second and more serious difficulty is that the\nrequired privileging simply appears arbitrary.  Without it, the reason\nto withhold the classification ‘inequality’ from\nvariations in health status across individuals disappears, as does the\nargument for a social group definition of ‘health\ninequality.’  A different and more tailored conclusion that may be drawn from\nHausman's argument, which we shall see independent reason to\naffirm later, is that it is artificial and over-simple to put very\nmuch weight on mono-factor normative principles, such as\n‘equality of health-by-itself.’ Alternatively: despite\nbeing licensed to conclude that it is pro tanto unjust when two\nindividuals have unequal health, we would do well to bear firmly in\nmind how fragile this sort of pro tanto injustice is. Hausman's\nargument highlights the variety and ubiquity of factors that can serve\nto remove that injustice, while leaving the health inequality itself\nfully in place. \n\nOn the other side of the debate, Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen (2013)\nargues that we should define ‘health inequality’ across\nindividuals at the fundamental moral level.  His argument consists in\ntwo objections to social group definitions. They are related insofar\nas both objections advance a version of the point that any group\ndefinition will be inherently arbitrary. Lippert-Rasmussen's\nfirst objection is the ‘intra-group inequality’ challenge,\naccording to which there is no reason to treat health inequalities\nbetween groups as being any more unjust than health inequalities\nwithin groups.  Yet, ‘for any selection of groups such\nthat [health] inequalities between two groups matter, intragroup\n[health] inequalities may exist’ (57).  Lippert-Rasmussen's second objection is the\n‘group-identification’ challenge. There are any number of\nways to sub-divide a given population into groups.  Holding the\nunderlying health facts fixed, different choices of group definition\nwill correspond to different inequalities in health (of different\nmagnitudes) inhering in the same population.  Some explanation is\ncalled for, then, of the significance in justice of the particular\ncharacter of one's favoured group definition.  What is the\nrelevance to justice, for example, of the apparently artificial\nboundaries demarcating the groups—‘America 2,’ say\n(Northland low-income rural whites)—in the ‘eight\nAmericas’ analysis from which our opening illustration of\ninequalities in health was drawn?  Now, as we have already observed, one obvious option for\ndischarging this explanatory burden, which Lippert-Rasmussen also\nrecognises, is to define the groups so that they ‘echo the major\nsocial causes of health equality’ (58).  He rejects this\nresponse, but his rejection appears to rest primarily on his denial\nthat social causation (in contrast to natural causation) has any\nprivileged relevance to justice. We address this point briefly below,\nin section 7 (Complications). Earlier we said that it was helpful to consider the question of\ndefining health inequalities on two levels, where the first level is\nthe fundamental moral level.  The main point behind distinguishing\nlevels here is simply to clarify that the fundamental moral level is\nseparate from other levels at which the question can be considered and\nalso more basic than them. In the first instance, then, it does not\nmatter much how exactly we describe the second level.  We need only\ndescribe it as ‘not the fundamental moral level.’ How the\nother level(s) should be described more specifically will depend on\none's purposes. For example, Asada (2013) describes a\n‘policy’ level and Lippert-Rasmussen (2013) describes a\nlevel of ‘principles of regulation.’ While each of these\nlevels is plainly distinct from the fundamental moral level, they are\nalso distinct from each other. In general, the considerations germane\nto actual policy makers will be much less theoretical than (at least\nsome of) those germane to evaluating principles of regulation.\nPrinciples of regulation, for instance, ‘must take into account\npotentially unjust refusals to cooperate’ (Lippert-Rasmussen\n2013, 56).  By contrast, in actual policy making, no attention is paid\nto ‘potentially unjust’ refusals to cooperate (even if\nsome may be paid to predictable failures of cooperation).  At the level of policy-making, Asada (2013, 40-41) reviews two\nconsiderations that favour defining health inequalities across\nindividuals and one that favours defining them across social\ngroups. She also proposes a novel approach that attempts to combine\nthe merits of both.  A definition across individuals is favoured by\nthe fact that data collected on that basis lends itself easily to\ninternational comparisons, whereas data on health inequalities defined\nacross groups can only be compared between two countries if both\ncountries have conceived and operationalised the relevant groups in\nthe same way (which they often have not).  Furthermore, defining\nhealth inequalities across individuals does not require any balancing\nor summary operation in order to yield conclusions about overall\ninequalities in health, whereas a definition across groups only yields\nconclusions about overall inequalities when combined with data from\nother relevant groups (e.g., when health inequalities across income\ngroups are combined with health inequalities across educational\ngroups).  On the other hand, a definition across groups is favoured by\nthe fact that the social variable defining the group (e.g., income or\neducation) often naturally suggests a target for policy intervention,\nwhereas a definition across individuals suggests no such target and is\nthus ‘one step removed from policy’ (Asada 2013, 41). \n\nThe strategy of aligning the social groups used to define inequalities\nin health with the major social causes of health evidently presupposes\nthat one knows that those causes are. To determine whether any of the\npreviously discussed correlations between individual life expectancy\nand a social variable is causal, one needs some account of the\ncausal pathways between candidate social determinants and\nspecific mortality risk factors. Unfortunately, these pathways are not\nwell understood (Adler and Newman 2002; Adler and Ostrove 1999; Evans\net al. 1994). While research in this area remains preliminary, it may\nbe useful to describe some of the possibilities. \n\nTo begin with, researchers distinguish material pathways from\npsychosocial ones. Certain conditions of absolute material\ndeprivation constitute well-recognised risks for ill health and\nmortality, including inadequate nutrition, lack of clean water and\nsanitation, and poor housing. A very plausible causal pathway runs\nfrom low levels of non-comparative individual income through these\nmaterial risk factors to lower individual life expectancy.  However, the cited social gradients in life expectancy were mainly\nobserved in highly developed societies, where the prevalence of\nabsolute material deprivation is fairly low. In particular, a\nsignificant social gradient was observed in the Whitehall studies,\nwhere the occupants of even the lowest occupational rank were\nnevertheless all stably employed civil servants with free access to\nhealth care. Since entire gradients can emerge in the absence of\nmaterial deprivation, many researchers have been moved to postulate\nadditional pathways—i.e., psychosocial pathways—between\nhealth and some aspect of social status (Marmot 2004). \n\nOne of the most prominent specific risk factors envisaged as the\nterminus for a psychosocial pathway is (the effects of)\nstress. As Eric Brunner and Michael Marmot (1999) explain,\nthe long-term effects of stress differ importantly from its short-term\neffects. In the short-term, an individual's fight-or-flight\nresponse to external stressors is beneficial insofar as it enables him\nto cope with threats and challenges. Among other things, this acute\nstress response involves the activation of neuroendocrine pathways,\nalong which adrenaline and cortisol (e.g.) are released into the\nbloodstream. These hormones stimulate psychological arousal (e.g.,\nvigilance) and mobilise energy, while simultaneously inhibiting\nfunctions irrelevant to immediate survival (e.g., digestion, growth,\nand repair). An optimal reactivity pattern is characterised by a sharp\nincrease in levels of circulating adrenaline (and later, cortisol),\nfollowed by a rapid return to baseline once the challenge has\npassed. Sub-optimal patterns are characterised by elevated baseline\nlevels and slower returns to baseline.  By contrast, the long-term effects of stress—either from\nover frequent provocation of acute stress or from chronic\nstress—can be physiologically harmful. Stress-induced damage is\nmediated, among other things, by prolonged elevation of adrenaline and\ncortisol levels in the blood. Elevated cortisol can lead to the\naccumulation of cholesterol (e.g., by raising glucose levels even\nduring inactivity); and elevated adrenaline increases the\nblood's tendency to clot, which can add to the formation of\narterial plaques and thereby lead to increased risk of heart disease\nand stroke.  Other risks that may be increased by stress-induced\ndamage include risks for cancer, infection, and cognitive decline.  A psychosocial pathway running from stress-induced damage—or\n‘allostatic load’ (McEwen 1998)—has next to be\ntraced to some social factor, preferably one amenable to policy\nmanipulation. Two factors that have attracted considerable attention\nin this connection are ‘social rank’ and ‘job\ncontrol.’ \n\nThe most specific evidence on the role of social rank in\nproducing stress-induced damage comes from studies of non-human\nprimates (Brunner and Marmot 1999; Evans et al. 1994). In various\nprimate species, social life is organised in terms of clear and stable\ndominance hierarchies. Sapolsky and Mott (1987) found that hierarchies\nof free-ranging male baboons exhibit an inverse social gradient both\nin cortisol elevations and in adverse cholesterol ratios. Subordinate\nbaboons have higher baseline levels of cortisol and lower levels of\nhigh density lipoprotein (i.e., ‘good’) cholesterol than\ndominant baboons, while total cholesterol levels are similar across\nthe hierarchy. In subordinate baboons, cortisol levels also return\nslowly to baseline following a challenge, whereas (a sub-set of)\ndominant baboons have optimal stress reactivity patterns (Sapolsky\n1993). Furthermore, when the dominance hierarchy is experimentally\ndisrupted, then all the baboons (including the former\ndominants) exhibit the sub-optimal stress reactivity patterns of\nsubordinates. \n\nYet more specific evidence that stress-induced damage is sensitive to\nrank (i.e., to relative social status) per se comes from\nstudies of captive macaque monkeys. In these studies, experimenters\nmanipulated the dominance hierarchy, forcing individual monkeys to\noccupy new ranks, while holding their diet and environment\nconstant. Shively and Clarkson (1994) fed female macaques a\ncholesterol rich diet while manipulating their hierarchy. Over a two\nyear period, all of the monkeys developed atherosclerosis (coronary\nplaques). However, dominant monkeys who became subordinate had a\nfive-fold excess as compared to those who remained dominant.  (Part of\nthis excess was due to the stress associated simply with a\nchange in social rank [as distinct from a demotion], since\nsubordinate monkeys who became dominant also had more atherosclerosis\n[albeit, only twice as much] compared to those who remained\nsubordinate). Cohen and colleagues (1997) exposed male macaques to an\nadenovirus while manipulating their hierarchy. They found an inverse\nsocial gradient in the susceptibility to viral infection, with the\noccupants of the lowest social rank—whoever they might\nbe—being at ‘substantially greater risk’ of\ninfection. Lower status monkeys also exhibited a greater cortisol\nresponse to the hierarchy manipulations, but this did not account for\ntheir differential susceptibility. \n\nEvidence on the role of low job control in producing\nstress-induced damage comes from the Whitehall II study (Marmot et\nal. 1997). ‘Job control’ refers to an individual's\nlevel of task control in the workplace, operationalised here in terms\nof a questionnaire concerning decision authority and skill\ndiscretion. One of the principal diseases for which stress-induced\ndamage increases the risk is coronary heart disease (CHD). In\nWhitehall II, there was an inverse social gradient in age-adjusted CHD\nincidence: Compared to their high grade counterparts, intermediate\ngrade male civil servants were 1.25 times more likely to develop a new\ncase of CHD in a five year interval, while low grade men were 1.5\ntimes more likely. For women, the odds ratios were 1.12 and\n1.47. Marmot and his colleagues also found an inverse social gradient\nin low job control. Among men, 8.7 percent of high, 26.6 percent of\nintermediate, and 77.8 percent of low grade civil servants reported\nlow job control; for women, the percentages were 10.1, 34.8, and\n75.3. But their key finding was that a substantial part of the\ngradient in CHD incidence could be attributed to the differences in\njob control. Controlling for low job control reduced the low grade\n(e.g.) men's odds ratio for new CHD from 1.5 to 1.18 and the\nwomen's from 1.47 to 1.23. By comparison, known CHD risk factors\nonly reduced the same ratios from 1.5 to 1.3 and from 1.47 to 1.35,\nrespectively. \n\nFinally, of course, plausible causal pathways between stress-induced\ndamage and these particular social factors will only help to breathe\ncausality into the correlations with which we began if either social\nrank or job control can, in turn, be suitably connected with income,\neducation, occupational rank, or social class. To date, few such\nconnections have been established, apart from that between job control\nand occupational rank. \n\nIn the present context, the point in consulting the empirical\nliterature on the underlying determinants of health was to establish\nwhether (and, ideally, to what extent) particular inequalities in\nhealth are avoidable. For the minimal purposes of making an\nevaluation in justice—that is, of opening the door to\nsuch an evaluation—the available evidence is arguably adequate:\nGiven that the distributions of income and of education are more or\nless socially controllable, as is the composition of occupational\nhierarchies, it is hard not to believe that the significant\ninequalities in health that correlate with these factors are at least\nsomewhat avoidable. Otherwise put, it would be implausible, given the\nevidence, to deny that these inequalities in health represent any\ninjustice at all on the grounds that they are\nunavoidable. \n\nThings may be different, however, for the purposes of designing\npolicy remedies. As Angus Deaton puts it, ‘policy cannot be\nintelligently conducted without an understanding of mechanisms;\ncorrelations are not enough’ (2002, 15). It is not clear that\nour existing understanding of the causal pathways between socially\ncontrollable factors and specific mortality risks is sufficiently\nwell-developed to underwrite concrete policy proposals. Moreover, even\nif it were, it would still be a further step to license\nimplementation of some such proposal.  Among other things, a\nlicence of this kind requires an account of the comparative\neffectiveness of a proposed reform in relation to salient\nalternatives. \n\nOn the assumption that a particular inequality in health is avoidable,\nwhat else is required to establish that it is unjust?  Dahlgren and\nWhitehead (1991) argue that the inequality must also be\nunfair, while Anand and Peter (2000) object that unfairness\nentails avoidability and so is not really separate from it.  But\navoidability is cleanly separable (in the other direction) from\nunfairness, and that can be an analytic advantage.  For example, it\nallows the justice of inevitable inequalities in health to be decided\nwithout having to engage the issue of fairness at all. \n\nWhatever one decides on that point, appeals to fairness will\nthemselves have to rest on some basis or other. We can distinguish two\nfundamentally different approaches to bringing verdicts of fairness to\nbear on a given health inequality.  Let us call them the\nfree-standing and the derivative approaches to the\njustice of health inequalities. \n\nThe simplest example of the free-standing approach applies a general\nprinciple of equality directly to the case of health. (For general\ndiscussion of the grounds of egalitarianism, as well as of the\ncharacter of different versions, see the entry on\n egalitarianism.)  With some\nqualifications, the resultant requirement of ‘equality of\nhealth’ is affirmed, for example, by Culyer and Wagstaff\n(1993). This implies that any avoidable inequality in health\nis unfair or unjust. \n\nOthers might require only that health be ‘more or less’\nequal. In some contexts, the bounds of this ‘more or less’\n(i.e., of how much inequality is permissible) can be safely left to\nintuitive judgement. For example, it is plausible to\njudge—purely in relation to magnitude—that the nearly 8\nyear difference in life expectancy between English men in social class\nV (unskilled manual) and those in social class I (professional)\n(Wilkinson and Marmot 2003, 10) exceeds the bounds of permissible\ninequality, even though these bounds have not been specified. In the\npresent context, however, this intuitive approach is unfortunately\nconfounded by the fact that we do not know how much of that 8\nyear difference is actually avoidable. From the plausibility of\njudging that 8 years exceeds the bounds of ‘more or less equal\nhealth’ and that ‘at least some’ of the 8 year\ndifference is avoidable, one cannot safely infer that the observed\ninequality in English male life expectancy between social classes V\nand I is unfair. \n\nOn the free-standing approach, the injustice of an unjust health\ninequality is the primary injustice, although a verdict of injustice\ncan also be spread backwards from this primary injustice to\nits (socially controllable) causes. For example, the causes of the\navoidable part of the inequality in male life expectancy between\nsocial classes V and I are themselves accounted unjust precisely\nbecause their socially controllable effect is unjust\n(according to the strict equality principle), and this verdict holds\neven if these causes are otherwise permissible (i.e., permissible\napart from their effects). \n\nBy contrast, on the derivative approach, the injustice of an unjust\nhealth inequality is not the primary injustice. Rather, the primary\ninjustice is some unjust cause of a health inequality, although a\nverdict of injustice can also be spread forwards from this\nprimary injustice to the health inequality itself. In this way, the\ninjustice of an unjust health inequality derives from the primary\ninjustice of its cause(s). Suppose, for example, that part of the\ndifference in life expectancy between white and African-American men\nin the United States is caused by racial discrimination. On the\nderivative approach, this part of that inequality in health is unjust\nbecause its cause is unjust, and this verdict holds even if\navoidable inequalities in health are not otherwise unjust\n(e.g., even if no valid principle of equality applies directly to\nhealth). \n\nOf course, it is possible for the two approaches to be combined.  If\nsome valid principle of equality applies directly to health, and if\nsome independent injustices function as causes of health inequalities,\nthen a complete account of justice in relation to health inequalities\nwill require a combined approach. The scenario in which one injustice\nattaches directly to the inequality, while another attaches primarily\nto its cause also neatly frames the question of whether one injustice\ncan compound another. Suppose, for example, that a strict equality\nprinciple applies directly to health. In that case, an avoidable\ninequality in life expectancy of 2 years between, say, American group\nA and American group B would be unjust in itself, whatever its\ncause(s). Now suppose, furthermore, that this 2 year inequality is\nentirely caused by racial discrimination against group A, committed by\nthe longer-lived group B. The issue of compounding amounts to asking\nwhether the injustice of a 2 year inequality in life expectancy is\nworse when its cause is independently unjust (second scenario) than\nwhen its cause is otherwise permissible (first scenario) or, to put it\ndifferently, whether there is more injustice in the second scenario,\nabove and beyond the original injustice of a 2 year inequality in life\nexpectancy and the added injustice of racial discrimination. \n\nIn both its strict and weakened versions, the free-standing approach\nis naturally understood as pronouncing on the pro tanto\ninjustice of avoidable inequalities in health. This allows for its\nverdicts of injustice to be outweighed by other moral considerations\n(Culyer and Wagstaff 1993). Among the various kinds of trade-offs\nthereby permitted, cases in which equality of health is traded off\nagainst non-health considerations can be distinguished from cases in\nwhich it is traded off against aggregate health gains.  At least where micro-allocation decisions are concerned, Kamm\n(2004, 228–9) holds that health considerations operate in a\n‘separate sphere,’ against which non-health considerations\nhave no weight at all. A separate spheres view disallows trading\nequality of health off against non-health considerations, but cannot\ndisallow trading it off against aggregate health gains (after all,\nthis latter trade-off operates entirely within the health\nsphere). Anand (2004) defends a less extreme version of this view. He\nargues that a special weight should be attached to considerations of\nhealth, since health is constitutive of well-being and not merely\ninstrumental to it.  While Anand explicitly countenances trading\nequality of health off against aggregate health gains, he concludes\nthat we should be less tolerant of such trade-offs in the case of\nhealth than in the case of income. \n\nWe have been assuming throughout that an inequality in health is\nunjust only if it is avoidable.  That was the basis, for example, of\ntreating the best part of the inequality in life expectancy between\nwomen and men as not unjust.  While this assumption is very intuitive,\nand widely held, it is nevertheless controversial in some quarters.\nLippert-Rasmussen (2013), among others, rejects it.  In principle,\nthis is an open controversy.  For present purposes, however, it is\nmore convenient not to engage the issue.  To this end, we can\ndistinguish ‘social justice’ explicitly from\n‘natural justice,’ where social injustice is\ndefined to have avoidability as a necessary condition; and\nalso frame the open controversy in these terms, as Lippert-Rasmussen\nhimself does: ‘there is such a thing as natural injustice, and\nsocial injustice is not worse per se than natural injustice’\n(2013, 59). Without prejudging the controversy, we can then simply\navoid it by stipulating that, everywhere in our discussion,\n‘justice’ and its cognates are to be understood\nspecifically as social justice.  At the most basic level, a principle of equality can only be\napplied to health if ‘health’ falls within its scope. If\nthe principle applies unrestrictedly to ‘goods’ or\n‘functionings,’ then there will be no obstacle to applying\nit to health. Likewise, if the principle requires equality of\n‘welfare,’ then arguably there will be no such obstacle\neither, since ‘welfare’ is plausibly interpreted to\ninclude ‘health’ as a constituent. On the other hand, it\nis less clear whether health counts as an equilisandum under a\nprinciple of equality of ‘resources.’ If it were counted,\nhealth would be equalized as a means to some further goal or\ncondition, but not as a goal in itself. While health can plausibly be\nseen as an important means to various intrinsically valuable goals,\nthe canonical defense of the equality of resources principle does not\ninterpret health as a ‘resource’ in its technical sense\n(Dworkin 2000, chh. 1–2). \n\nMore significantly, the implications a principle of equality has for\nhealth may also depend on how ‘equality’ itself is\nunderstood. For instance, it can be defined in either relative or\nabsolute terms. In perhaps more familiar language, egalitarianism can\neither be defined as requiring equality spoken strictly or as\nrequiring priority to the worse off (Parfit 2001).  On the\nfirst interpretation (i.e., the relative one), the demands of\negalitarianism are essentially comparative: equality (e.g., of health)\nrequires that a given person have the same health as others\nin some specified reference group (e.g., those in the same society or\nhumanity at large). On the second interpretation (i.e., the absolute\none), the demands of egalitarianism are essentially non-comparative: a\n‘priority of health’ principle requires that a given\nperson have as much health as possible, as judged by some\nnon-comparative metric (e.g., absolute years of life expectancy). More\nprecisely, a priority of health principle holds that the more badly\noff a given person is on the non-comparative metric (e.g., the fewer\nher years of life expectancy), the greater the moral weight that\nattaches to a given increment of improvement in her health (e.g., the\naddition of a year to her life expectancy).  In many cases, an equality of health principle and a priority of\nhealth principle have the same practical implications. Most saliently,\nif one individual (or group) avoidably has a lower life expectancy\nthan another, then both principles will condemn the resultant\ninequality of health and also sanction efforts to improve the life\nexpectancy of the worse off person (or group). The two principles\ndiffer most importantly where an avoidable inequality of health can be\neliminated, not by improving the health of the worse off person (or\ngroup), but only by reducing the health of the better off person (or\ngroup). Here a priority of health principle will not recognize any\nreason to reduce the health of the better off, whereas an equality of\nhealth principle will recognize a reason to reduce the health of the\nbetter off—namely, that it eliminates the inequality. This\nillustrates the so-called ‘levelling down’ objection\nagainst principles of equality. Parfit (2001) regards this as a\ncompelling objection, though Temkin (1993) and Eyal (2013) do not. \n\nFurther complications arise when the distinction between equality and\npriority runs across our previous distinction between free-standing\nand derivative approaches to applying egalitarianism to the case of\nhealth. To bring the clearest examples into view, let us focus on\nincome as a social determinant of health and assume that\nindividual income makes a causal contribution to individual life\nexpectancy. On the derivative approach, the justice of the\ncauses of health is the primary locus of assessment. But\nwhether the health inequalities suffered in consequence of an income\ninequality count as injustices may depend on the structure of our\nnormative principle, since that may affect whether the income\ninequality itself (i.e., the cause) counts as unjust in the first\nplace. Suppose that levelling down with respect to income (i.e.,\nreducing the income of the rich without raising that of the poor) were\nthe only way to eliminate a given income inequality. In that case, the\nincome inequality would not count as an injustice on a\npriority of income principle, and hence neither would the\nconsequent health inequality. However, both inequalities would still\ncount as injustices on an equality of income principle. \n\nOn the free-standing approach, the (in)justice of health inequalities\nthemselves is the primary locus of assessment. Consider the case in\nwhich normatively we affirm a priority of health principle, but\nempirically the relative income hypothesis is\ncorrect—that is, an individual's life expectancy is also a\nfunction of her income as compared to others' income in her\nsociety and not simply of its non-comparative level. Here levelling\ndown with respect to income will produce an absolute health\ngain for the worse off in terms of income. Hence, it will be licensed\nby a priority of health principle (especially if the worse off in\nterms of income are also worse off in terms of health), since an\nabsolute health inequality will (avoidably) persist if we omit to\nreduce the income of the better off. A similar observation is made by\nBrighouse and Swift, as part of their discussion of ‘positional\ngoods’ (2006, 480). They regard the case as one in which there\nis reason to ‘level down.’ However, a lot depends here on\ndefinitions (cf. Brighouse and Swift 2006, 477–78). In the sense\nof Parfit's objection, ‘levelling down’ requires the\nelimination of the inequality not to produce any absolute\nbenefit to anyone. Our case does not involve levelling down in this\nsense, as it does produce absolute health benefits for some (via the\nrelative income hypothesis), even though it does not produce absolute\nincome benefits for anyone.  Consideration of this last sprinkling of\ncases may suggest instead that it is artificial and over-simple to put\nvery much weight on mono-factor normative principles, such as\n‘equality of income-by-itself’ or ‘priority of\nhealth-by-itself.’ This reinforces the main constructive point\nthat emerged from our discussion of Hausman's (2007, 2013)\nargument against defining health inequalities across individuals.  A final complication to consider concerns the accommodation of\npersonal responsibility. ‘Luck egalitarians’ have argued\nthat, in general, we should discount the moral significance of\nnegative outcomes suffered by an agent (e.g., an inequality of\nwell-being), at least when they are the clear result of a clear choice\nby that same agent—with the result that these outcomes neither\ncount as injustices nor are they eligible for social redress (see\nAnderson 1999). A symmetrical discounting is recommended for positive\noutcomes. Analogous discounts can be invoked by prioritarians as\nwell—for example, Arneson (2000) affirms what he calls\n‘responsibility catering prioritarianism.’  Luck egalitarianism can be applied to health in particular (see,\ne.g., Le Grand 1987 and Segall 2010).  In this case, the fundamental\nissue is well illustrated by the example of lung cancer and\nsmoking. If someone has a treatable case of lung cancer, we might\nordinarily reasonably presume that it would be unjust to deny him\nmedical care. However, if his cancer is due to a heavy, life-long\nsmoking habit, the question arises of whether the ordinary presumption\nis defeated or diminished in strength. For instance, if there is a\nchoice to be made (say, because of resource scarcity) between treating\nhim and treating another lung cancer patient who is in no way\nresponsible for her lung cancer, does justice require preferring the\nsecond patient? A simple application of luck egalitarianism would hold\nthat it is just to deny treatment to the smoker, as long as his\n‘decision to smoke’ qualifies as a ‘clear\nchoice’ according to some suitable criteria. \n\nHowever, neither Le Grand nor Segall take this position in the final\nanalysis.  Le Grand (2013) avoids it by appealing to the role of\noutcome luck (which mitigates the efficacy even of clear choices) and\nto the role of misjudgements (which detract from the clarity of many\nactual choices), whereas Segall (2010, ch. 4) avoids it by appealing\nto value pluralism. By contrast, Wikler (2004) argues that access to\ntreatment should not be discounted to accommodate\nconsiderations of personal responsibility in the first place. \n\nDaniels, Kennedy, and Kawachi (2000) propose to decide when health\ninequalities are unjust by appeal to Rawls' (1971) theory of\njustice. Their contribution is recapitulated by Daniels (2008, ch. 3)\nand, for convenience, we refer to the later treatment. Daniels follows\nthe derivative approach to evaluating health inequalities. In\nthe first instance, in other words, his evaluative focus is on the\ncauses of health inequalities. His central claim is that, by\na happy coincidence, Rawls' principles of justice regulate all\nof the principal social determinants of health (2008, 82 and 97). \n\nTo begin with, income is regulated by the difference\nprinciple: inequalities in income are permitted only to the extent\nthat they work to the greatest benefit of the least well off.\nEducation is regulated by the principle of fair equality of\nopportunity, which requires ‘equitable public education’\nas well as ‘developmentally appropriate day care and early\nchildhood interventions’ (Daniels 2008, 96). (Workplace\norganisation, if validated as a determinant of health, would also\nbe regulated under the fair equality of opportunity principle).\nPolitical participation, which Daniels (2008, 95–6)\nregards as a social determinant of health, is regulated by the\nprinciple of equal basic liberty: among other things, this principle\nsafeguards the fair value of the right to participate\npolitically. Finally, reaffirming his earlier work (1985), Daniels\nmaintains that fair equality of opportunity also requires universal\naccess to comprehensive health care (broadly construed to\ninclude public health). \n\nTo the extent that these social variables are causal determinants of\nhealth, and to the extent that their distribution in society\nfails to conform to the corresponding principle of Rawlsian\njustice, the resultant health inequalities will be unjust and unjust\nbecause their causes are unjust. The flip-side of this point is that\nthe implementation of Rawls' principles will tend—again,\ninsofar as the relevant determinants are causal—to flatten the\nsocial gradient in health (Daniels 2008, 82), i.e., to reduce existing\ninequalities in health. Hence the title of the jointly authored paper\n(2000): ‘justice is good for our health.’ \n\nAs Daniels notices, observing Rawlsian justice may flatten the social\ngradient in health without eliminating it altogether. For example, the\ndifference principle may permit certain inequalities of income, which\nare nevertheless possible to eliminate. If income is a causal\ndeterminant of health, these permissible income inequalities will\n(continue to) generate health inequalities if they are left in\nplace. (This scenario is actually only coherent if the\nrelative income hypothesis is the correct account of the\ncausal mechanism.  For the explanation, see Sreenivasan\n2009b). Daniels holds that the persistence of avoidable health\ninequalities does not give us reason in justice, independently of the\ndifference principle, to eliminate their underlying cause. In his\nview, justice permits some avoidable inequalities in health:\n‘The residual inequalities that emerge with conformance to\n[Rawls'] principles are not a compromise with what justice\nideally requires; they are acceptable as just’ (2008, 99). \n\nThis position has been criticized by Anand and Peter (2000,\n50–52). To begin with, they argue that there is a tension\nbetween two different uses Daniels makes of Rawls' second\nprinciple of justice. On the one hand, they argue, Daniels treats its\ntwo parts as simply regulating certain specific social determinants of\nhealth—the fair equality of opportunity principle regulates\neducation (e.g.), while the difference principle regulates income. On\nthe other hand, his account of health care treats the fair equality of\nopportunity principle as regulating health itself\ndirectly. But the latter employment of fair equality of opportunity,\nwhich Anand and Peter actually prefer (2000, 52), threatens to\ncontradict Daniels' treatment of residual health\ninequalities. If fair equality of opportunity requires (some kind of)\negalitarianism about health, then residual health inequalities that\nremain after the difference principle is fully implemented may still\nfall within its scope. In that case, Rawlsian justice may\nwell command their reduction. \n\nAnand and Peter make a further point, which can be put in terms of our\ndistinction between free-standing and derivative approaches to\nevaluating health inequalities.  Daniels' treatment of health\ncare employs the logic of the free-standing approach, spreading an\nevaluation of health backwards on to one of its causes (health\ncare). Yet his final conclusion requires that we adhere exclusively to\nthe logic of the derivative approach. For Daniels claims that residual\nhealth inequalities are just—not because they fall within the\nscope of an explicitly permitted health inequality, as in\n‘more or less’ equal health, but—simply because\ntheir causes are otherwise just. However, it is not clear how the\njustice of a health inequality's cause could settle the question\nof its permissibility unless no valid principle of justice\napplies directly to health inequalities. If that is right, then in\naddition to eschewing even partial reliance on it himself, Daniels has\nto show that no version of the free-standing approach is valid. As\nAnand and Peter put it: ‘This view relies on the\npremise—not made explicit by the authors—that inequalities\nin health are unjust if, and only if, they are the result of\nunjust social arrangements’(2000, 50, emphasis added). But\nDaniels offers no argument for the italicised portion of the premiss\nhis final conclusion requires."}]
