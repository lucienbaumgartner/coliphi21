One possible way to understand ‘woman’ in this\nclaim is to take it as a sex term: ‘woman’ picks out human\nfemales and being a human female depends on various biological and\nanatomical features (like genitalia). Historically many feminists have\nunderstood ‘woman’ differently: not as a sex term, but as\na gender term that depends on social and cultural factors (like social\nposition). In so doing, they distinguished sex (being female or male)\nfrom gender (being a woman or a man), although most ordinary language\nusers appear to treat the two interchangeably. More recently this\ndistinction has come under sustained attack and many view it nowadays\nwith (at least some) suspicion. This entry outlines and discusses\ndistinctly feminist debates on sex and gender.\n\n\n\nThe terms ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ mean different\nthings to different feminist theorists and neither are easy or\nstraightforward to characterise. Sketching out some feminist history\nof the terms provides a helpful starting point. \n\nMost people ordinarily seem to think that sex and gender are\ncoextensive: women are human females, men are human males. Many\nfeminists have historically disagreed and have endorsed the sex/\ngender distinction. Provisionally: ‘sex’ denotes human\nfemales and males depending on biological features\n(chromosomes, sex organs, hormones and other physical features);\n‘gender’ denotes women and men depending on\nsocial factors (social role, position, behaviour or\nidentity). The main feminist motivation for making this distinction\nwas to counter biological determinism or the view that biology is\ndestiny. \n\nA typical example of a biological determinist view is that of Geddes\nand Thompson who, in 1889, argued that social, psychological and\nbehavioural traits were caused by metabolic state. Women supposedly\nconserve energy (being ‘anabolic’) and this makes them\npassive, conservative, sluggish, stable and uninterested in politics.\nMen expend their surplus energy (being ‘katabolic’) and\nthis makes them eager, energetic, passionate, variable and, thereby,\ninterested in political and social matters. These biological\n‘facts’ about metabolic states were used not only to\nexplain behavioural differences between women and men but also to\njustify what our social and political arrangements ought to be. More\nspecifically, they were used to argue for withholding from women\npolitical rights accorded to men because (according to Geddes and\nThompson) “what was decided among the prehistoric Protozoa\ncannot be annulled by Act of Parliament” (quoted from Moi 1999,\n18). It would be inappropriate to grant women political rights, as\nthey are simply not suited to have those rights; it would also be\nfutile since women (due to their biology) would simply not be\ninterested in exercising their political rights. To counter this kind\nof biological determinism, feminists have argued that behavioural and\npsychological differences have social, rather than biological, causes.\nFor instance, Simone de Beauvoir famously claimed that one is not\nborn, but rather becomes a woman, and that “social\ndiscrimination produces in women moral and intellectual effects so\nprofound that they appear to be caused by nature” (Beauvoir 1972\n[original 1949], 18; for more, see the entry on\n Simone de Beauvoir).\n Commonly observed behavioural traits associated with women and men,\nthen, are not caused by anatomy or chromosomes. Rather, they are\nculturally learned or acquired. \n\nAlthough biological determinism of the kind endorsed by Geddes and\nThompson is nowadays uncommon, the idea that behavioural and\npsychological differences between women and men have biological causes\nhas not disappeared. In the 1970s, sex differences were used to argue\nthat women should not become airline pilots since they will be\nhormonally unstable once a month and, therefore, unable to perform\ntheir duties as well as men (Rogers 1999, 11). More recently,\ndifferences in male and female brains have been said to explain behavioural\ndifferences; in particular, the anatomy of corpus callosum, a bundle\nof nerves that connects the right and left cerebral hemispheres, is\nthought to be responsible for various psychological and behavioural\ndifferences. For instance, in 1992, a Time magazine article\nsurveyed then prominent biological explanations of differences between women\nand men claiming that women's thicker corpus callosums could explain\nwhat ‘women's intuition’ is based on and impair women's\nability to perform some specialised visual-spatial skills, like\nreading maps (Gorman 1992). Anne Fausto-Sterling has questioned the\nidea that differences in corpus callosums cause behavioural and\npsychological differences. First, the corpus callosum is a highly\nvariable piece of anatomy; as a result, generalisations about its\nsize, shape and thickness that hold for women and men in general\nshould be viewed with caution. Second, differences in adult human\ncorpus callosums are not found in infants; this may suggest that\nphysical brain differences actually develop as responses to\ndifferential treatment. Third, given that visual-spatial skills (like\nmap reading) can be improved by practice, even if women and men's\ncorpus callosums differ, this does not make the resulting behavioural\ndifferences immutable. (Fausto-Sterling 2000b, chapter 5). \n\nIn order to distinguish biological differences from\nsocial/psychological ones and to talk about the latter, feminists\nappropriated the term ‘gender’. Psychologists writing on\ntranssexuality were the first to employ gender terminology in this\nsense. Until the 1960s, ‘gender’ was often used to refer\nto masculine and feminine words, like le and la in\nFrench. However, in order to explain why some people felt that they\nwere ‘trapped in the wrong bodies’, the psychologist\nRobert Stoller (1968) began using the terms ‘sex’ to pick\nout biological traits and ‘gender’ to pick out the amount\nof femininity and masculinity a person exhibited. Although (by and\nlarge) a person's sex and gender complemented each other, separating\nout these terms seemed to make theoretical sense allowing Stoller to\nexplain the phenomenon of transsexuality: transsexuals' sex and gender\nsimply don't match. \n\nAlong with psychologists like Stoller, feminists found it useful to\ndistinguish sex and gender. This enabled them to argue that many\ndifferences between women and men were socially produced and,\ntherefore, changeable. Gayle Rubin (for instance) uses the phrase\n‘sex/gender system’ in order to describe “a set of\narrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex and\nprocreation is shaped by human, social intervention” (1975,\n165).  Rubin employed this system to articulate that “part of\nsocial life which is the locus of the oppression of women”\n(1975, 159) describing gender as the “socially imposed division\nof the sexes” (1975, 179). Rubin's thought was that although\nbiological differences are fixed, gender differences are the\noppressive results of social interventions that dictate how women and\nmen should behave. Women are oppressed as women and “by\nhaving to be women” (Rubin 1975, 204). However, since\ngender is social, it is thought to be mutable and alterable by\npolitical and social reform that would ultimately bring an end to\nwomen's subordination. Feminism should aim to create a\n“genderless (though not sexless) society, in which one's sexual\nanatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with whom one\nmakes love” (Rubin 1975, 204). \n\nIn some earlier interpretations, like Rubin's, sex and gender\nwere thought to complement one another. The slogan ‘Gender is the\nsocial interpretation of sex’ captures this view. Nicholson calls\nthis ‘the coat-rack view’ of gender: our sexed bodies are\nlike coat racks and “provide the site upon which gender [is]\nconstructed” (1994, 81). Gender conceived of as masculinity and\nfemininity is superimposed upon the ‘coat-rack’ of sex as\neach society imposes on sexed bodies their cultural conceptions of how\nmales and females should behave. This socially constructs gender\ndifferences – or the amount of femininity/masculinity of a person\n– upon our sexed bodies. That is, according to this\ninterpretation, all humans are either male or female; their sex is\nfixed. But cultures interpret sexed bodies differently and project\ndifferent norms on those bodies thereby creating feminine and masculine\npersons. Distinguishing sex and gender, however, also enables the two\nto come apart: they are separable in that one can be sexed male and yet\nbe gendered a woman, or vice versa (Haslanger 2000b; Stoljar 1995). \n\nSo, this group of feminist arguments against biological determinism\nsuggested that gender differences result from cultural practices and\nsocial expectations. Nowadays it is more common to denote this by\nsaying that gender is socially constructed. This means that genders\n(women and men) and gendered traits (like being nurturing or\nambitious) are the “intended or unintended product[s] of a\nsocial practice” (Haslanger 1995, 97). But which social\npractices construct gender, what social construction is and what being\nof a certain gender amounts to are major feminist controversies. There\n is no consensus on these issues. (See the entry on \n intersections between analytic and continental feminism \n for more on different ways to understand gender.) \n\nOne way to interpret Beauvoir's claim that one is not born but rather\nbecomes a woman is to take it as a claim about gender socialisation:\nfemales become women through a process whereby they acquire feminine\ntraits and learn feminine behaviour. Masculinity and femininity are\nthought to be products of nurture or how individuals are brought\nup. They are causally constructed (Haslanger 1995, 98):\nsocial forces either have a causal role in bringing gendered\nindividuals into existence or (to some substantial sense) shape the\nway we are qua women and men. And the mechanism of\nconstruction is social learning. For instance, Kate Millett takes\ngender differences to have “essentially cultural, rather than\nbiological bases” that result from differential treatment (1971,\n28–9). For her, gender is “the sum total of the parents',\nthe peers', and the culture's notions of what is appropriate to each\ngender by way of temperament, character, interests, status, worth,\ngesture, and expression” (Millett 1971, 31). Feminine and\nmasculine gender-norms, however, are problematic in that gendered\nbehaviour conveniently fits with and reinforces women's subordination\nso that women are socialised into subordinate social roles: they learn\nto be passive, ignorant, docile, emotional helpmeets for men (Millett\n1971, 26). However, since these roles are simply learned, we can\ncreate more equal societies by ‘unlearning’ social\nroles. That is, feminists should aim to diminish the influence of\nsocialisation. \n\nSocial learning theorists hold that a huge array of different\ninfluences socialise us as women and men. This being the case, it is\nextremely difficult to counter gender socialisation. For instance,\nparents often unconsciously treat their female and male children\ndifferently. When parents have been asked to describe their\n24-hour old infants, they have done so using\ngender-stereotypic language: boys are describes as strong, alert and\ncoordinated and girls as tiny, soft and delicate. Parents' treatment\nof their infants further reflects these descriptions whether they are\naware of this or not (Renzetti & Curran 1992, 32). Some\nsocialisation is more overt: children are often dressed in gender\nstereotypical clothes and colours (boys are dressed in blue, girls in\npink) and parents tend to buy their children gender stereotypical\ntoys. They also (intentionally or not) tend to reinforce certain\n‘appropriate’ behaviours. While the precise form of gender\nsocialization has changed since the onset of second-wave feminism,\neven today girls are discouraged from playing sports like football or\nfrom playing ‘rough and tumble’ games and are more likely\nthan boys to be given dolls or cooking toys to play with; boys are\ntold not to ‘cry like a baby’ and are more likely to be\ngiven masculine toys like trucks and guns (for more, see Kimmel 2000,\n122–126).[1] \n\nAccording to social learning theorists, children are also influenced\nby what they observe in the world around them. This, again, makes\ncountering gender socialisation difficult. For one, children's books\nhave portrayed males and females in blatantly stereotypical ways: for\ninstance, males as adventurers and leaders, and females as helpers and\nfollowers. One way to address gender stereotyping in children's books\nhas been to portray females in independent roles and males as\nnon-aggressive and nurturing (Renzetti & Curran 1992, 35). Some\npublishers have attempted an alternative approach by making their\ncharacters, for instance, gender-neutral animals or genderless\nimaginary creatures (like TV's Teletubbies). However, parents reading\nbooks with gender-neutral or genderless characters often undermine the\npublishers' efforts by reading them to their children in ways that\ndepict the characters as either feminine or masculine.  According to Renzetti\nand Curran, parents labelled the overwhelming majority of\ngender-neutral characters masculine whereas those characters that fit\nfeminine gender stereotypes (for instance, by being helpful and\ncaring) were labelled feminine (1992, 35). Socialising influences like\nthese are still thought to send implicit messages regarding how\nfemales and males should act and are expected to act shaping us into\nfeminine and masculine persons. \n\nNancy Chodorow (1978; 1995) has criticised social learning theory as\ntoo simplistic to explain gender differences (see also Deaux &\nMajor 1990; Gatens 1996). Instead, she holds that gender is a matter\nof having feminine and masculine personalities that develop in early\ninfancy as responses to prevalent parenting practices. In particular,\ngendered personalities develop because women tend to be the primary\ncaretakers of small children. Chodorow holds that because mothers (or\nother prominent females) tend to care for infants, infant male and\nfemale psychic development differs. Crudely put: the mother-daughter\nrelationship differs from the mother-son relationship because mothers\nare more likely to identify with their daughters than their sons. This\nunconsciously prompts the mother to encourage her son to\npsychologically individuate himself from her thereby prompting him to\ndevelop well defined and rigid ego boundaries. However, the mother\nunconsciously discourages the daughter from individuating herself\nthereby prompting the daughter to develop flexible and blurry ego\nboundaries. Childhood gender socialisation further builds on and\nreinforces these unconsciously developed ego boundaries finally\nproducing feminine and masculine persons (1995, 202–206). This\nperspective has its roots in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, although\nChodorow's approach differs in many ways from Freud's. \n\nGendered personalities are supposedly manifested in common gender\nstereotypical behaviour. Take emotional dependency. Women are\nstereotypically more emotional and emotionally dependent upon others\naround them, supposedly finding it difficult to distinguish their own\ninterests and wellbeing from the interests and wellbeing of their\nchildren and partners. This is said to be because of their blurry and\n(somewhat) confused ego boundaries: women find it hard to distinguish\ntheir own needs from the needs of those around them because they cannot\nsufficiently individuate themselves from those close to them. By\ncontrast, men are stereotypically emotionally detached, preferring a\ncareer where dispassionate and distanced thinking are virtues. These\ntraits are said to result from men's well-defined ego boundaries\nthat enable them to prioritise their own needs and interests sometimes\nat the expense of others' needs and interests. \n\nChodorow thinks that these gender differences should and can be\nchanged. Feminine and masculine personalities play a crucial role in\nwomen's oppression since they make females overly attentive to the\nneeds of others and males emotionally deficient. In order to correct\nthe situation, both male and female parents should be equally involved\nin parenting (Chodorow 1995, 214). This would help in ensuring that\nchildren develop sufficiently individuated senses of selves without\nbecoming overly detached, which in turn helps to eradicate common\ngender stereotypical behaviours. \n\nCatharine MacKinnon develops her theory of gender as a theory of\nsexuality. Very roughly: the social meaning of sex (gender) is created\nby sexual objectification of women whereby women are viewed and\ntreated as objects for satisfying men's desires (MacKinnon\n1989). Masculinity is defined as sexual dominance, femininity as\nsexual submissiveness: genders are “created through the\neroticization of dominance and submission. The man/woman difference\nand the dominance/submission dynamic define each other. This is the\nsocial meaning of sex” (MacKinnon 1989, 113). For MacKinnon,\ngender is constitutively constructed: in defining genders (or\nmasculinity and femininity) we must make reference to social factors\n(see Haslanger 1995, 98). In particular, we must make reference to the\nposition one occupies in the sexualised dominance/submission dynamic:\nmen occupy the sexually dominant position, women the sexually\nsubmissive one. As a result, genders are by definition\nhierarchical and this hierarchy is fundamentally tied to sexualised\npower relations. The notion of ‘gender equality’, then,\ndoes not make sense to MacKinnon. If sexuality ceased to be a\nmanifestation of dominance, hierarchical genders (that are defined\nin terms of sexuality) would cease to exist. \n\nSo, gender difference for MacKinnon is not a matter of having a\nparticular psychological orientation or behavioural pattern; rather,\nit is a function of sexuality that is hierarchal in patriarchal\nsocieties.  This is not to say that men are naturally\ndisposed to sexually objectify women or that women are\nnaturally submissive.  Instead, male and female sexualities\nare socially conditioned: men have been conditioned to find women's\nsubordination sexy and women have been conditioned to find a\nparticular male version of female sexuality as erotic – one in\nwhich it is erotic to be sexually submissive. For MacKinnon, both\nfemale and male sexual desires are defined from a male point of view\nthat is conditioned by pornography (MacKinnon 1989, chapter\n7). Bluntly put: pornography portrays a false picture of ‘what\nwomen want’ suggesting that women in actual fact are and want to\nbe submissive. This conditions men's sexuality so that they view\nwomen's submission as sexy. And male dominance enforces this male\nversion of sexuality onto women, sometimes by force. MacKinnon's\nthought is not that male dominance is a result of social learning (see\n2.1.); rather, socialization is an expression of power. That is,\nsocialized differences in masculine and feminine traits, behaviour,\nand roles are not responsible for power inequalities. Females and\nmales (roughly put) are socialised differently because there are\nunderlying power inequalities. As MacKinnon puts it,\n‘dominance’ (power relations) is prior to\n‘difference’ (traits, behaviour and roles) (see, MacKinnon\n2006). MacKinnon, then, sees legal restrictions on pornography as\nparamount to ending women's subordinate status that stems from their\ngender. \n\nThe positions outlined above share an underlying metaphysical\n perspective on gender: gender \n realism.[2]\n That is, women as a group are\nassumed to share some characteristic feature, experience, common\ncondition or criterion that defines their gender and the possession of\nwhich makes some individuals women (as opposed to, say, men).\nAll women are thought to differ from all men in this\nrespect (or respects). For example, MacKinnon thought that being\ntreated in sexually objectifying ways is the common condition that\ndefines women's gender and what women as women share.\nAll women differ from all men in this respect. Further, pointing out\nfemales who are not sexually objectified does not provide a\ncounterexample to MacKinnon's view. Being sexually objectified is\nconstitutive of being a woman; a female who escapes sexual\nobjectification, then, would not count as a woman. \n\nOne may want to critique the three accounts outlined by rejecting\nthe particular details of each account. (For instance, see Spelman\n[1988, chapter 4] for a critique of the details of Chodorow's\nview.) A more thoroughgoing critique has been levelled at the general\nmetaphysical perspective of gender realism that underlies these\npositions. It has come under sustained attack on two grounds: first,\nthat it fails to take into account racial, cultural and class\ndifferences between women (particularity argument); second, that it\nposits a normative ideal of womanhood (normativity argument). \n\nElizabeth Spelman (1988) has influentially argued against gender\nrealism with her particularity argument. Roughly: gender realists\nmistakenly assume that gender is constructed independently of race,\nclass, ethnicity and nationality. If gender were separable from, for\nexample, race and class in this manner, all women would experience\nwomanhood in the same way. And this is clearly false. For instance,\nHarris (1993) and Stone (2007) criticise MacKinnon's view, that sexual\nobjectification is the common condition that defines women's gender,\nfor failing to take into account differences in women's backgrounds\nthat shape their sexuality. The history of racist oppression\nillustrates that during slavery black women were\n‘hypersexualised’ and thought to be always sexually\navailable whereas white women were thought to be pure and sexually\nvirtuous. In fact, the rape of a black woman was thought to be\nimpossible (Harris 1993). So, (the argument goes) sexual\nobjectification cannot serve as the common condition for womanhood\n since it varies considerably depending on one's race and\n class.[3] \n\nFor Spelman, the perspective of ‘white solipsism’\nunderlies gender realists' mistake. They assumed that all women\nshare some “golden nugget of womanness” (Spelman 1988, 159)\nand that the features constitutive of such a nugget are the same for\nall women regardless of their particular cultural backgrounds. Next,\nwhite Western middle-class feminists accounted for the shared features\nsimply by reflecting on the cultural features that condition\ntheir gender as women thus supposing that “the womanness\nunderneath the Black woman's skin is a white woman's, and\ndeep down inside the Latina woman is an Anglo woman waiting to burst\nthrough an obscuring cultural shroud” (Spelman 1988, 13). In so\ndoing, Spelman claims, white middle-class Western feminists passed off\ntheir particular view of gender as “a metaphysical truth”\n(1988, 180) thereby privileging some women while marginalising\nothers. In failing to see the importance of race and class in gender\nconstruction, white middle-class Western feminists conflated “the\ncondition of one group of women with the condition of all”\n(Spelman 1988, 3). \n\n Betty Friedan's (1963) well-known work is a case in point of white\n solipsism.[4]\n Friedan saw domesticity as the main vehicle of gender oppression and\ncalled upon women in general to find jobs outside the home. But she\nfailed to realize that women from less privileged backgrounds, often\npoor and non-white, already worked outside the home to support their\nfamilies. Friedan's suggestion, then, was applicable only to a\nparticular sub-group of women (white middle-class Western housewives).\nBut it was mistakenly taken to apply to all women's lives — a\nmistake that was generated by Friedan's failure to take\nwomen's racial and class differences into account (hooks 2000,\n1–3). \n\nSpelman further holds that since social conditioning creates\nfemininity and societies (and sub-groups) that condition it differ from\none another, femininity must be differently conditioned in different\nsocieties. For her, “females become not simply women but\nparticular kinds of women” (Spelman 1988, 113): white\nworking-class women, black middle-class women, poor Jewish women,\nwealthy aristocratic European women, and so on. \n\nThis line of thought has been extremely influential in feminist\nphilosophy. For instance, Young holds that Spelman has\ndefinitively shown that gender realism is untenable (1997,\n13). Mikkola (2006) argues that this isn't so. The arguments Spelman\nmakes do not undermine the idea that there is some characteristic\nfeature, experience, common condition or criterion that defines\nwomen's gender; they simply point out that some particular ways of\ncashing out what defines womanhood are misguided.  So, although\nSpelman is right to reject those accounts that falsely take the\nfeature that conditions white middle-class Western feminists' gender\nto condition women's gender in general, this leaves open the\npossibility that women qua women do share something that\ndefines their gender. (See also Haslanger [2000a] for a discussion of\nwhy gender realism is not necessarily untenable, and Stoljar [2011]\nfor a discussion of Mikkola's critique of Spelman.) \n\nJudith Butler critiques the sex/gender distinction on two grounds.\nShe critiques gender realism with her normativity argument (1999\n[original 1990], chapter 1); she also holds that the sex/gender\ndistinction is unintelligible (this will be discussed in section\n3.3.).  Butler's normativity argument is not straightforwardly\ndirected at the metaphysical perspective of gender realism, but rather\nat its political counterpart: identity politics. This is a\nform of political mobilization based on membership in some group\n(e.g. racial, ethnic, cultural, gender) and group membership is\nthought to be delimited by some common experiences, conditions or\n features that define the group (Heyes 2000, 58; see also the entry on\n Identity Politics).\n Feminist identity politics, then, presupposes gender realism in that\nfeminist politics is said to be mobilized around women as a group (or\ncategory) where membership in this group is fixed by some condition,\nexperience or feature that women supposedly share and that defines\ntheir gender. \n\nButler's normativity argument makes two claims. The first is\nakin to Spelman's particularity argument: unitary gender notions\nfail to take differences amongst women into account thus failing to\nrecognise “the multiplicity of cultural, social, and political\nintersections in which the concrete array of ‘women’ are\nconstructed” (Butler 1999, 19–20). In their attempt to undercut\nbiologically deterministic ways of defining what it means to be a\nwoman, feminists inadvertedly created new socially constructed accounts\nof supposedly shared femininity. Butler's second claim is that\nsuch false gender realist accounts are normative. That is, in their\nattempt to fix feminism's subject matter, feminists unwittingly\ndefined the term ‘woman’ in a way that implies there is\nsome correct way to be gendered a woman (Butler 1999, 5). That the\ndefinition of the term ‘woman’ is fixed supposedly\n“operates as a policing force which generates and legitimizes\ncertain practices, experiences, etc., and curtails and delegitimizes\nothers” (Nicholson 1998, 293). Following this line of thought,\none could say that, for instance, Chodorow's view of gender\nsuggests that ‘real’ women have feminine personalities and\nthat these are the women feminism should be concerned about.\nIf one does not exhibit a distinctly feminine personality, the\nimplication is that one is not ‘really’ a member of\nwomen's category nor does one properly qualify for feminist\npolitical representation. \n\nButler's second claim is based on her view that“[i]dentity\ncategories [like that of women] are never merely descriptive, but\nalways normative, and as such, exclusionary” (Butler 1991,\n160). That is, the mistake of those feminists Butler critiques was not\nthat they provided the incorrect definition of\n‘woman’. Rather, (the argument goes) their mistake was to\nattempt to define the term ‘woman’ at all. Butler's view\nis that ‘woman’ can never be defined in a way that does\nnot prescribe some “unspoken normative requirements” (like\nhaving a feminine personality) that women should conform to (Butler\n1999, 9). Butler takes this to be a feature of terms like\n‘woman’ that purport to pick out (what she calls)\n‘identity categories’. She seems to assume that\n‘woman’ can never be used in a non-ideological way (Moi\n1999, 43) and that it will always encode conditions that are not\nsatisfied by everyone we think of as women. Some explanation for this\ncomes from Butler's view that all processes of drawing categorical\ndistinctions involve evaluative and normative commitments; these in\nturn involve the exercise of power and reflect the conditions of those\nwho are socially powerful (Witt 1995). \n\nIn order to better understand Butler's critique, consider her\naccount of gender performativity. For her, standard feminist accounts\ntake gendered individuals to have some essential properties\nqua gendered individuals or a gender core by virtue of which\none is either a man or a woman. This view assumes that women and men,\nqua women and men, are bearers of various essential and\naccidental attributes where the former secure gendered persons'\npersistence through time as so gendered. But according to Butler this\nview is false: (i) there are no such essential properties, and (ii)\ngender is an illusion maintained by prevalent power structures. First,\nfeminists are said to think that genders are socially constructed in\nthat they have the following essential attributes (Butler 1999, 24):\nwomen are females with feminine behavioural traits, being heterosexuals\nwhose desire is directed at men; men are males with masculine\nbehavioural traits, being heterosexuals whose desire is directed at\nwomen. These are the attributes necessary for gendered individuals and\nthose that enable women and men to persist through time as\nwomen and men. Individuals have “intelligible genders”\n(Butler 1999, 23) if they exhibit this sequence of traits in a coherent\nmanner (where sexual desire follows from sexual orientation that in\nturn follows from feminine/ masculine behaviours thought to follow from\nbiological sex). Social forces in general deem individuals who exhibit\nincoherent gender sequences (like lesbians) to be doing their\ngender ‘wrong’ and they actively discourage such sequencing\nof traits, for instance, via name-calling and overt homophobic\ndiscrimination. Think back to what was said above: having a certain\nconception of what women are like that mirrors the conditions of\nsocially powerful (white, middle-class, heterosexual, Western) women\nfunctions to marginalize and police those who do not fit this\nconception. \n\nThese gender cores, supposedly encoding the above traits, however,\nare nothing more than illusions created by ideals and practices that\nseek to render gender uniform through heterosexism, the view that\nheterosexuality is natural and homosexuality is deviant (Butler 1999,\n42). Gender cores are constructed as if they somehow naturally\nbelong to women and men thereby creating gender dimorphism or the\nbelief that one must be either a masculine male or a feminine female.\nBut gender dimorphism only serves a heterosexist social order by\nimplying that since women and men are sharply opposed, it is natural to\nsexually desire the opposite sex or gender. \n\nFurther, being feminine and desiring men (for instance) are\nstandardly assumed to be expressions of one's gender as a woman.\nButler denies this and holds that gender is really performative. It is\nnot “a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts\nfollow; rather, gender is … instituted … through a\nstylized repetition of [habitual] acts” (Butler\n1999, 179): through wearing certain gender-coded clothing, walking and sitting\nin certain gender-coded ways, styling one's hair in gender-coded\nmanner and so on. Gender is not something one is, it is something one\ndoes; it is a sequence of acts, a doing rather than a being. And\nrepeatedly engaging in ‘feminising’ and\n‘masculinising’ acts congeals gender thereby making people\nfalsely think of gender as something they naturally are.\nGender only comes into being through these gendering acts: a female who\nhas sex with men does not express her gender as a woman. This\nactivity (amongst others) makes her gendered a woman. \n\nThe constitutive acts that gender individuals create genders as\n“compelling illusion[s]” (Butler 1990, 271). Our gendered\nclassification scheme is a strong pragmatic construction:\nsocial factors wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme\nfails to represent accurately any ‘facts of the matter’\n(Haslanger 1995, 100). People think that there are true and real\ngenders, and those deemed to be doing their gender ‘wrong’\nare not socially sanctioned. But, genders are true and real only to\nthe extent that they are performed (Butler 1990, 278–9). It does\nnot make sense, then, to say of a male-to-female trans person that\ns/he is really a man who only appears to be a\nwoman. Instead, males dressing up and acting in ways that are\nassociated with femininity “show that [as Butler suggests]\n‘being’ feminine is just a matter of doing certain\nactivities” (Stone 2007, 64). As a result, the trans person's\ngender is just as real or true as anyone else's who is a\n‘traditionally’ feminine female or masculine male (Butler\n 1990,\n 278).[5]\n Without heterosexism that compels people to engage in certain\ngendering acts, there would not be any genders at all. And ultimately\nthe aim should be to abolish norms that compel people to act in these\ngendering ways. \n\nFor Butler, given that gender is performative, the appropriate\nresponse to feminist identity politics involves two things. First,\nfeminists should understand ‘woman’ as open-ended and\n“a term in process, a becoming, a constructing that cannot\nrightfully be said to originate or end … it is open to\nintervention and resignification” (Butler 1999, 43). That is,\nfeminists should not try to define ‘woman’ at all. Second,\nthe category of women “ought not to be the foundation of feminist\npolitics” (Butler 1999, 9). Rather, feminists should focus on\nproviding an account of how power functions and shapes our\nunderstandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also\nwithin the feminist movement. \n\nMany people, including many feminists, have ordinarily taken sex\nascriptions to be solely a matter of biology with no social or cultural\ndimension. It is commonplace to think that there are only two sexes and\nthat biological sex classifications are utterly unproblematic. By\ncontrast, some feminists have argued that sex classifications are not\nunproblematic and that they are not solely a matter of biology. In\norder to make sense of this, it is helpful to distinguish object- and\nidea-construction (see Haslanger 2003b for more): social forces can be\nsaid to construct certain kinds of objects (e.g. sexed bodies or\ngendered individuals) and certain kinds of ideas (e.g. sex or gender\nconcepts). First, take the object-construction of sexed bodies.\nSecondary sex characteristics, or the physiological and biological\nfeatures commonly associated with males and females, are affected by\nsocial practices. In some societies, females' lower social status\nhas meant that they have been fed less and so, the lack of nutrition\nhas had the effect of making them smaller in size (Jaggar 1983, 37).\nUniformity in muscular shape, size and strength within sex categories\nis not caused entirely by biological factors, but depends heavily on\nexercise opportunities: if males and females were allowed the same\nexercise opportunities and equal encouragement to exercise, it is\nthought that bodily dimorphism would diminish (Fausto-Sterling 1993a,\n218). A number of medical phenomena involving bones (like osteoporosis)\nhave social causes directly related to expectations about gender,\nwomen's diet and their exercise opportunities (Fausto-Sterling\n2005). These examples suggest that physiological features thought to be\nsex-specific traits not affected by social and cultural factors are,\nafter all, to some extent products of social conditioning. Social\nconditioning, then, shapes our biology. \n\nSecond, take the idea-construction of sex concepts. Our concept of\nsex is said to be a product of social forces in the sense\nthat what counts as sex is shaped by social meanings. Standardly,\nthose with XX-chromosomes, ovaries that produce large egg cells,\nfemale genitalia, a relatively high proportion of ‘female’\nhormones, and other secondary sex characteristics (relatively small\nbody size, less body hair) count as biologically female. Those with\nXY-chromosomes, testes that produce small sperm cells, male genitalia,\na relatively high proportion of ‘male’ hormones and other\nsecondary sex traits (relatively large body size, significant amounts\nof body hair) count as male. This understanding is fairly recent. The\nprevalent scientific view from Ancient Greeks until the late\n18th century, did not consider female and male sexes to be\ndistinct categories with specific traits; instead, a ‘one-sex\nmodel’ held that males and females were members of the same sex\ncategory.  Females' genitals were thought to be the same as males' but\nsimply directed inside the body; ovaries and testes (for instance)\nwere referred to by the same term and whether the term referred to the\nformer or the latter was made clear by the context (Laqueur 1990, 4).\nIt was not until the late 1700s that scientists began to think of\nfemale and male anatomies as radically different moving away from the\n‘one-sex model’ of a single sex spectrum to the (nowadays\nprevalent) ‘two-sex model’ of sexual dimorphism. (For an\nalternative view, see King 2013.) \n\nFausto-Sterling has argued that this ‘two-sex\nmodel’ isn't straightforward either (1993b; 2000a; 2000b).  She\nestimates that 1.7% of population fail to neatly fall within the usual\nsex classifications possessing various combinations of different sex\ncharacteristics (Fausto-Sterling 2000a, 20). In her earlier work, she\nclaimed that intersexed individuals make up (at least) three further\nsex classes: ‘herms’ who possess one testis and one ovary;\n‘merms’ who possess testes, some aspects of female\ngenitalia but no ovaries; and ‘ferms’ who have ovaries,\nsome aspects of male genitalia but no testes (Fausto-Sterling 1993b,\n21). (In her [2000a], Fausto-Sterling notes that these labels were put\nforward tongue–in–cheek.) Recognition of intersexes\nsuggests that feminists (and society at large) are wrong to think that\nhumans are either female or male. \n\nTo illustrate further the idea-construction of sex, consider the\ncase of the athlete Maria Patiño. Patiño has female\ngenitalia, has always considered herself to be female and was\nconsidered so by others. However, she was discovered to have XY\nchromosomes and was barred from competing in women's sports\n(Fausto-Sterling 2000b, 1–3). Patiño's genitalia were at\nodds with her chromosomes and the latter were taken to determine her\nsex. Patiño successfully fought to be recognised as a female\nathlete arguing that her chromosomes alone were not sufficient\nto not make her female. Intersexes, like Patiño,\nillustrate that our understandings of sex differ and suggest that there\nis no immediately obvious way to settle what sex amounts to purely\nbiologically or scientifically. Deciding what sex is involves\nevaluative judgements that are influenced by social factors. \n\nInsofar as our cultural conceptions affect our understandings of\nsex, feminists must be much more careful about sex classifications and\nrethink what sex amounts to (Stone 2007, chapter 1). More specifically,\nintersexed people illustrate that sex traits associated with females\nand males need not always go together and that individuals can have\nsome mixture of these traits. This suggest to Stone that sex\nis a cluster concept: it is sufficient to satisfy enough of the sex\nfeatures that tend to cluster together in order to count as being of a\nparticular sex. But, one need not satisfy all of those\nfeatures or some arbitrarily chosen supposedly necessary sex\nfeature, like chromosomes (Stone 2007, 44). This makes sex a matter of\ndegree and sex classifications should take place on a spectrum: one can\nbe more or less female/male but there is no sharp distinction between\nthe two. Further, intersexes (along with trans people) are located at\nthe centre of the sex spectrum and in many cases their sex will be\nindeterminate (Stone 2007). More recently, Ayala and Vasilyeva (2015) have argued for an\ninclusive and extended conception of sex: just as certain tools can be\nseen to extend our minds beyond the limits of our brains (e.g. white canes), other tools\n(like dildos) can extend our sex beyond our bodily boundaries. This\nview aims to motivate the idea that what counts as sex should not be\ndetermined by looking inwards at genitalia or other anatomical\nfeatures. \n\nIn addition to arguing against identity politics and for gender\nperformativity, Butler holds that distinguishing biological\nsex from social gender is unintelligible. For her, both are\nsocially constructed: \n\n(Butler is not alone in claiming that there are no tenable\ndistinctions between nature/culture, biology/construction and\nsex/gender. See also: Antony 1998; Gatens 1996; Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik\n1999.) Butler makes two different claims in the passage cited: that\nsex is a social construction, and that sex is gender. To unpack her\nview, consider the two claims in turn. First, the idea that sex is a\nsocial construct, for Butler, boils down to the view that our sexed\nbodies are also performative and, so, they have “no ontological\nstatus apart from the various acts which constitute [their]\nreality” (1999, 173). Prima facie, this implausibly\nimplies that female and male bodies do not have independent existence\nand that if gendering activities ceased, so would physical\nbodies. This is not Butler's claim; rather, her position is that\nbodies viewed as the material foundations on which gender is\nconstructed, are themselves constructed as if they provide\nsuch material foundations (Butler 1993).  Cultural conceptions about\ngender figure in “the very apparatus of production whereby sexes\nthemselves are established” (Butler 1999, 11). \n\nFor Butler, sexed bodies never exist outside social meanings and how\nwe understand gender shapes how we understand sex (1999, 139).  Sexed\nbodies are not empty matter on which gender is constructed and sex\ncategories are not picked out on the basis of objective features of\nthe world. Instead, our sexed bodies are themselves discursively\nconstructed: they are the way they are, at least to a substantial\nextent, because of what is attributed to sexed bodies and how they are\nclassified (for discursive construction, see Haslanger 1995, 99). Sex\n assignment (calling someone female or male) is normative (Butler 1993,\n 1).[6]\n When the\ndoctor calls a newly born infant a girl or a boy, s/he is not making a\ndescriptive claim, but a normative one. In fact, the doctor is\n performing an illocutionary speech act (see the entry on\n Speech Acts).\n In effect, the doctor's\nutterance makes infants into girls or boys.  We, then, engage in\nactivities that make it seem as if sexes naturally come in two and\nthat being female or male is an objective feature of the world, rather\nthan being a consequence of certain constitutive acts (that is, rather\nthan being performative). And this is what Butler means in saying that\nphysical bodies never exist outside cultural and social meanings, and\nthat sex is as socially constructed as gender. She does not deny that\nphysical bodies exist. But, she takes our understanding of this\nexistence to be a product of social conditioning: social\nconditioning makes the existence of physical bodies intelligible to us\nby discursively constructing sexed bodies through certain constitutive\nacts. (For a helpful introduction to Butler's views, see Salih\n2002.) \n\nFor Butler, sex assignment is always in some sense oppressive.\nAgain, this appears to be because of Butler's general suspicion\nof classification: sex classification can never be merely descriptive\nbut always has a normative element reflecting evaluative claims of\nthose who are powerful. Conducting a feminist genealogy of the body (or\nexamining why sexed bodies are thought to come naturally as female and\nmale), then, should ground feminist practice (Butler 1993, 28–9).\nFeminists should examine and uncover ways in which social construction\nand certain acts that constitute sex shape our understandings of sexed\nbodies, what kinds of meanings bodies acquire and which practices and\nillocutionary speech acts ‘make’ our bodies into sexes.\nDoing so enables feminists to identity how sexed bodies are socially\nconstructed in order to resist such construction. \n\nHowever, given what was said above, it is far from obvious what we\nshould make of Butler's claim that sex “was always already\ngender” (1999, 11). Stone (2007) takes this to mean that sex\nis gender but goes on to question it arguing that the social\nconstruction of both sex and gender does not make sex identical to\ngender. According to Stone, it would be more accurate for Butler to say\nthat claims about sex imply gender norms. That is, many claims\nabout sex traits (like ‘females are physically weaker than\nmales’) actually carry implications about how women and men are\nexpected to behave. To some extent the claim describes certain facts.\nBut, it also implies that females are not expected to do much heavy\nlifting and that they would probably not be good at it. So, claims\nabout sex are not identical to claims about gender; rather, they imply\nclaims about gender norms (Stone 2007, 70). \n\nSome feminists hold that the sex/gender distinction is not useful.\nFor a start, it is thought to reflect politically problematic\ndualistic thinking that undercuts feminist aims: the distinction is\ntaken to reflect and replicate androcentric oppositions between (for\ninstance) mind/body, culture/nature and reason/emotion that have been\nused to justify women's oppression (e.g. Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik 1999).\nThe thought is that in oppositions like these, one term is always\nsuperior to the other and that the devalued term is usually associated\nwith women (Lloyd 1993). For instance, human subjectivity and agency\nare identified with the mind but since women are usually identified\nwith their bodies, they are devalued as human subjects and agents. The\nopposition between mind and body is said to further map on to other\ndistinctions, like reason/emotion, culture/nature,\nrational/irrational, where one side of each distinction is devalued\n(one's bodily features are usually valued less that one's mind,\nrationality is usually valued more than irrationality) and women are\nassociated with the devalued terms: they are thought to be closer to\nbodily features and nature than men, to be irrational, emotional and\nso on. This is said to be evident (for instance) in job\ninterviews. Men are treated as gender-neutral persons and not asked\nwhether they are planning to take time off to have a family. By\ncontrast, that women face such queries illustrates that they are\nassociated more closely than men with bodily features to do with\nprocreation (Prokhovnik 1999, 126). The opposition between mind and\nbody, then, is thought to map onto the opposition between men and\nwomen. \n\nNow, the mind/body dualism is also said to map onto the sex/gender\ndistinction (Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik 1999). The idea is that gender\nmaps onto mind, sex onto body. Although not used by those endorsing\nthis view, the basic idea can be summed by the slogan ‘Gender is\nbetween the ears, sex is between the legs’: the implication is\nthat, while sex is immutable, gender is something individuals have\ncontrol over – it is something we can alter and change through\nindividual choices. However, since women are said to be more closely\nassociated with biological features (and so, to map onto the body side\nof the mind/body distinction) and men are treated as gender-neutral\npersons (mapping onto the mind side), the implication is that\n“man equals gender, which is associated with mind and choice,\nfreedom from body, autonomy, and with the public real; while woman\nequals sex, associated with the body, reproduction,\n‘natural’ rhythms and the private realm” (Prokhovnik\n1999, 103). This is said to render the sex/gender distinction\ninherently repressive and to drain it of any potential for\nemancipation: rather than facilitating gender role choice for women,\nit “actually functions to reinforce their association with body,\nsex, and involuntary ‘natural’ rhythms” (Prokhovnik\n1999, 103). Contrary to what feminists like Rubin argued, the\nsex/gender distinction cannot be used as a theoretical tool that\ndissociates conceptions of womanhood from biological and reproductive\nfeatures. \n\nMoi has further argued that the sex/gender distinction is useless\ngiven certain theoretical goals (1999, chapter 1). This is not to say\nthat it is utterly worthless; according to Moi, the sex/gender\ndistinction worked well to show that the historically prevalent\nbiological determinism was false. However, for her, the distinction\ndoes no useful work “when it comes to producing a good theory of\nsubjectivity” (1999, 6) and “a concrete, historical\nunderstanding of what it means to be a woman (or a man) in a given\nsociety” (1999, 4–5). That is, the 1960s distinction\nunderstood sex as fixed by biology without any cultural or historical\ndimensions.  This understanding, however, ignores lived experiences\nand embodiment as aspects of womanhood (and manhood) by separating sex\nfrom gender and insisting that womanhood is to do with the\nlatter. Rather, embodiment must be included in one's theory that tries\nto figure out what it is to be a woman (or a man). \nMore recently, Mikkola (2011) has argued that the sex/gender distinction,\nwhich underlies views like Rubin's and MacKinnon's, has certain\nunintuitive and undesirable ontological commitments that render the\ndistinction politically unhelpful. First, claiming that gender is\nsocially constructed implies that the existence of women and men is a\nmind-dependent matter. This suggests that we can do away with women\nand men simply by altering some social practices, conventions or\nconditions on which gender depends (whatever those are). However,\nordinary social agents find this unintuitive given that (ordinarily)\nsex and gender are not distinguished. Second, claiming that gender is\na product of oppressive social forces suggests that doing away with\nwomen and men should be feminism's political goal. But this harbours\nontologically undesirable commitments since many ordinary social\nagents view their gender to be a source of positive value. So,\nfeminism seems to want to do away with something that should not be\ndone away with, which is unlikely to motivate social agents to act in\nways that aim at gender justice. Given these problems, Mikkola argues\nthat feminists should give up the distinction on practical political\ngrounds. \n\nThe various critiques of the sex/gender distinction have called into\nquestion the viability of the category women. Feminism is the\nmovement to end the oppression women as a group face. But, how should\nthe category of women be understood if feminists accept the above\narguments that gender construction is not uniform, that a sharp\ndistinction between biological sex and social gender is false or (at\nleast) not useful, and that various features associated with women\nplay a role in what it is to be a woman, none of which are\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient (like a variety of\nsocial roles, positions, behaviours, traits, bodily features and\nexperiences)? Feminists must be able to address cultural and social\ndifferences in gender construction if feminism is to be a genuinely\ninclusive movement and be careful not to posit commonalities that mask\nimportant ways in which women qua women differ. These\nconcerns (among others) have generated a situation where (as Linda\nAlcoff puts it) feminists aim to speak and make political demands in\nthe name of women, at the same time rejecting the idea that there is a\nunified category of women (2006, 152). If feminist critiques of the\ncategory women are successful, then what (if anything) binds\nwomen together, what is it to be a woman, and what kinds of demands\ncan feminists make on behalf of women? \n\nMany have found the fragmentation of the category of women problematic\nfor political reasons (e.g. Alcoff 2006; Bach 2012; Benhabib 1992;\nFrye 1996; Haslanger 2000b; Heyes 2000; Martin 1994; Mikkola 2007;\nStoljar 1995; Stone 2004; Tanesini 1996; Young 1997; Zack 2005). For\ninstance, Young holds that accounts like Spelman's reduce the category\nof women to a gerrymandered collection of individuals with nothing to\nbind them together (1997, 20). Black women differ from white women but\nmembers of both groups also differ from one another with respect to\nnationality, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation and economic\nposition; that is, wealthy white women differ from working-class white\nwomen due to their economic and class positions. These sub-groups are\nthemselves diverse: for instance, some working-class white women in\nNorthern Ireland are starkly divided along religious lines. So if we\naccept Spelman's position, we risk ending up with individual women and\nnothing to bind them together. And this is problematic: in order to\nrespond to oppression of women in general, feminists must understand\nthem as a category in some sense. Young writes that without doing so\n“it is not possible to conceptualize oppression as a systematic,\nstructured, institutional process” (1997, 17). Some, then, take\nthe articulation of an inclusive category of women to be the\nprerequisite for effective feminist politics and a rich literature has\nemerged that aims to conceptualise women as a group or a collective\n(e.g. Alcoff 2006; Ásta 2011; Frye 1996; 2011; Haslanger 2000b;\nHeyes 2000; Stoljar 1995, 2011; Young 1997; Zack 2005). Articulations\nof this category can be divided into those that are: (a) gender\nnominalist — positions that deny there is something\nwomen qua women share and that seek to unify women's social\nkind by appealing to something external to women; and (b) gender\nrealist — positions that take there to be something\nwomen qua women share (although these realist positions\ndiffer significantly from those outlined in Section 2). Below we will\nreview some influential gender nominalist and gender realist\npositions. Before doing so, it is worth noting that not everyone is\nconvinced that attempts to articulate an inclusive category of women\ncan succeed or that worries about what it is to be a woman are in need\nof being resolved. Mikkola (2016) argues that feminist politics need\nnot rely on overcoming (what she calls) the ‘gender\ncontroversy’: that feminists must settle the meaning of gender\nconcepts and articulate a way to ground women’s social kind\nmembership. As she sees it, disputes about ‘what it is to be a\nwoman’ have become theoretically bankrupt and intractable, which\nhas generated an analytical impasse that looks unsurpassable. Instead,\nMikkola argues for giving up the quest, which in any case (she argues)\nposes no serious political obstacles. \n\nIris Young argues that unless there is “some sense in which\n‘woman’ is the name of a social collective [that feminism\nrepresents], there is nothing specific to feminist politics”\n(1997, 13). In order to make the category women intelligible,\nshe argues that women make up a series: a particular kind of social\ncollective “whose members are unified passively by the objects\ntheir actions are oriented around and/or by the objectified results of\nthe material effects of the actions of the other” (Young 1997,\n23). A series is distinct from a group in that, whereas members of\ngroups are thought to self-consciously share certain goals, projects,\ntraits and/ or self-conceptions, members of series pursue their own\nindividual ends without necessarily having anything at all in common.\nYoung holds that women are not bound together by a shared feature or\nexperience (or set of features and experiences) since she takes\nSpelman's particularity argument to have established definitely that\nno such feature exists (1997, 13; see also: Frye 1996; Heyes\n2000). Instead, women's category is unified by certain practico-inert\nrealities or the ways in which women's lives and their actions are\noriented around certain objects and everyday realities (Young 1997,\n23–4). For example, bus commuters make up a series unified\nthrough their individual actions being organised around the same\npractico-inert objects of the bus and the practice of public\ntransport. Women make up a series unified through women's lives and\nactions being organised around certain practico-inert objects and\nrealities that position them as women. \n\nYoung identifies two broad groups of such practico-inert objects and\nrealities. First, phenomena associated with female bodies (physical\nfacts), biological processes that take place in female bodies\n(menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth) and social rules associated with\nthese biological processes (social rules of menstruation, for\ninstance). Second, gender-coded objects and practices: pronouns, verbal\nand visual representations of gender, gender-coded artefacts and social\nspaces, clothes, cosmetics, tools and furniture. So, women make up a\nseries since their lives and actions are organised around female bodies\nand certain gender-coded objects. Their series is bound together\npassively and the unity is “not one that arises from the\nindividuals called women” (Young 1997, 32). \n\nAlthough Young's proposal purports to be a response to\nSpelman's worries, Stone has questioned whether it is, after all,\nsusceptible to the particularity argument: ultimately, on Young's\nview, something women as women share (their practico-inert realities)\nbinds them together (Stone 2004). \n\nNatalie Stoljar holds that unless the category of women is unified,\nfeminist action on behalf of women cannot be justified (1995,\n282). Stoljar too is persuaded by the thought that women qua\nwomen do not share anything unitary. This prompts her to argue for\nresemblance nominalism. This is the view that a certain kind of\nresemblance relation holds between entities of a particular type (for\nmore on resemblance nominalism, see Armstrong 1989,\n39–58). Stoljar is not alone in arguing for resemblance\nrelations to make sense of women as a category; others have also done\nso, usually appealing to Wittgenstein's ‘family\nresemblance’ relations (Alcoff 1988; Green & Radford Curry\n1991; Heyes 2000; Munro 2006). Stoljar relies more on Price's\nresemblance nominalism whereby x is a member of some type F\nonly if x resembles some paradigm or exemplar of F\nsufficiently closely (Price 1953, 20). For instance, the type of red\nentities is unified by some chosen red paradigms so that only those\nentities that sufficiently resemble the paradigms count as red. The\ntype (or category) of women, then, is unified by some chosen woman\nparadigms so that those who sufficiently resemble the woman paradigms\ncount as women (Stoljar 1995, 284). \n\nSemantic considerations about the concept woman suggest to\nStoljar that resemblance nominalism should be endorsed (Stoljar 2000,\n28). It seems unlikely that the concept is applied on the basis of\nsome single social feature all and only women possess. By contrast,\nwoman is a cluster concept and our attributions of womanhood\npick out “different arrangements of features in different\nindividuals” (Stoljar 2000, 27). More specifically, they pick out\nthe following clusters of features: (a) Female sex; (b)\nPhenomenological features: menstruation, female sexual experience,\nchild-birth, breast-feeding, fear of walking on the streets at night\nor fear of rape; (c) Certain roles: wearing typically female clothing,\nbeing oppressed on the basis of one's sex or undertaking care-work;\n(d) Gender attribution: “calling oneself a woman, being called a\nwoman” (Stoljar 1995, 283–4). For Stoljar, attributions of\nwomanhood are to do with a variety of traits and experiences: those\nthat feminists have historically termed ‘gender traits’\n(like social, behavioural, psychological traits) and those\ntermed ‘sex traits’.  Nonetheless, she holds that since\nthe concept woman applies to (at least some) MTF trans\npersons, one can be a woman without being female (Stoljar 1995,\n282). \n\nThe cluster concept woman does not, however,\nstraightforwardly provide the criterion for picking out the category\nof women. Rather, the four clusters of features that the concept picks\nout help single out woman paradigms that in turn help single out the\ncategory of women. First, any individual who possesses a\nfeature from at least three of the four clusters mentioned\nwill count as an exemplar of the category. For instance, an\nAfrican-American with primary and secondary female sex\ncharacteristics, who describes herself as a woman and is oppressed on\nthe basis of her sex, along with a white European hermaphrodite\nbrought up ‘as a girl’, who engages in female roles and\nhas female phenomenological features despite lacking female sex\n characteristics, will count as woman paradigms (Stoljar 1995,\n 284).[7]\n Second, any individual who resembles “any of the paradigms\nsufficiently closely (on Price's account, as closely as [the\nparadigms] resemble each other) will be a member of the resemblance\nclass ‘woman’” (Stoljar 1995, 284). That is, what\ndelimits membership in the category of women is that one resembles\nsufficiently a woman paradigm. \n\nIn a series of articles collected in her book of 2012, Sally Haslanger\nargues for a way to define the concept woman that is\npolitically useful, serving as a tool in feminist fights against\nsexism, and that shows\nwoman to be a social (not a biological) notion. More\nspecifically, Haslanger argues that gender is a matter of occupying\neither a subordinate or a privileged social position. In some\narticles, Haslanger is arguing for a revisionary analysis of the\nconcept woman (2000b; 2003a; 2003b). Elsewhere she suggests\nthat her analysis may not be that revisionary after all (2005;\n2006). Consider the former argument first. Haslanger's analysis is, in\nher terms, ameliorative: it aims to elucidate which gender concepts\nbest help feminists achieve their legitimate purposes thereby\nelucidating those concepts feminists should be using\n (Haslanger 2000b,\n 33).[8] \n Now, feminists need gender terminology in order to fight sexist\ninjustices (Haslanger 2000b, 36). In particular, they need gender\nterms to identify, explain and talk about persistent social\ninequalities between males and females. Haslanger's analysis of gender\nbegins with the recognition that females and males differ in two\nrespects: physically and in their social positions. Societies in\ngeneral tend to “privilege individuals with male bodies”\n(Haslanger 2000b, 38) so that the social positions they subsequently\noccupy are better than the social positions of those with female\nbodies. And this generates persistent sexist injustices. With this in\nmind, Haslanger specifies how she understands genders: \n\nThese are constitutive of being a woman and a man:\nwhat makes calling S a woman apt, is that S is\noppressed on sex-marked grounds; what makes calling S a man\napt, is that S is privileged on sex-marked grounds. \n\nHaslanger's ameliorative analysis is counterintuitive in that females\nwho are not sex-marked for oppression, do not count as women.  At\nleast arguably, the Queen of England is not oppressed on sex-marked\ngrounds and so, would not count as a woman on Haslanger's\ndefinition. And, similarly, all males who are not privileged would not\ncount as men. This might suggest that Haslanger's analysis should be\nrejected in that it does not capture what language users have in mind\nwhen applying gender terms. However, Haslanger argues that this is not\na reason to reject the definitions, which she takes to be revisionary:\nthey are not meant to capture our intuitive gender terms.  In\nresponse, Mikkola (2009) has argued that revisionary analyses of\ngender concepts, like Haslanger's, are both politically unhelpful and\nphilosophically unnecessary. \n\nNote also that Haslanger's proposal is eliminativist: gender justice\nwould eradicate gender, since it would abolish those sexist social\nstructures responsible for sex-marked oppression and privilege. If\nsexist oppression were to cease, women and men would no longer exist\n(although there would still be males and females). Not all feminists\nendorse such an eliminativist view though. Stone holds that Haslanger\ndoes not leave any room for positively revaluing what it is to be a\nwoman: since Haslanger defines woman in terms of\nsubordination, \n\nBut according to Stone this is not only undesirable – one should\nbe able to challenge subordination without having to challenge one's\nstatus as a woman. It is also false: “because norms of\nfemininity can be and constantly are being revised, women can be women\nwithout thereby being subordinate” (Stone 2007, 162; Mikkola\n[2016] also argues that Haslanger's eliminativism is undesirable). \n\nTheodore Bach also holds that Haslanger’s eliminativism is\nundesirable. However, in his view Haslanger’s position faces another\nmore serious problem. Feminism faces the following worries (among\nothers): Representation problem: “if there is no real group of\n‘women’, then it is incoherent to make moral claims and advance\npolitical policies on behalf of women” (Bach 2012, 234). \nCommonality problems: (1) There is no feature that all women\ncross-culturally and transhistorically share. (2) Delimiting women’s\nsocial kind with the help of some essential property privileges those\nwho possess it, and marginalizes those who do not (Bach 2012,\n235). \n\nAccording to Bach, Haslanger’s strategy to resolve these\nproblems appeals to ‘social objectivism’. First, we define\nwomen “according to a suitably abstract relational\nproperty” (Bach 2012, 236), which avoids the commonality\nproblems. Second, Haslanger employs “an ontologically thin\nnotion of ‘objectivity’” (Bach 2012, 236) that\nanswers the representation problem. Haslanger’s solution (Bach\nholds) is specifically to argue that women make up an objective type\nbecause women are objectively similar to one another, and not simply\nclassified together given our background conceptual schemes. Bach\nclaims though that Haslanger’s account is not objective enough,\nand we should on political grounds “provide a stronger\nontological characterization of the genders men\nand women according to which they are natural kinds with\nexplanatory essences” (Bach 2012, 238). He thus proposes that\nwomen make up a natural kind with a historical essence: \n\nIn short, one is not a woman due to shared surface properties with\nother women (like occupying a subordinate social position). Rather,\none is a woman because one has the right history: one has undergone\nthe ubiquitous ontogenetic process of gender socialization. Thinking\nabout gender in this way supposedly provides a stronger kind unity\nthan Haslanger’s that simply appeals to shared surface properties. \nBach’s view, however, has anti-trans implications. After all,\ntrans women who have not undergone female gender socialization\nwon’t count as women on his view (Mikkola [2016] develops this\nline of critique in detail). More worryingly, trans women will count\nas men contrary to their self-identification. Both Bettcher (2013) and\nJenkins (2016) consider the importance of gender\nself-identification. Bettcher argues that there is more than one\n‘correct’ way to understand womanhood: at the very least,\nthe dominant (mainstream), and the resistant (trans)\nconceptions. Dominant views like that of Bach’s tend to erase\ntrans people’s experiences and to marginalize trans women within\nfeminist movements. Rather than trans women having to defend their\nself-identifying claims, these claims should be taken at face value\nright from the start. And so, Bettcher holds, “in analyzing the\nmeaning of terms such as ‘woman,’ it is inappropriate to\ndismiss alternative ways in which those terms are actually used in\ntrans subcultures; such usage needs to be taken into consideration as\npart of the analysis” (2013, 235). \n\nSpecifically with Haslanger in mind and in a similar vein, Jenkins\n(2016) discusses how Haslanger’s revisionary approach unduly\nexcludes some trans women from women’s social kind. On\nJenkins’s view, Haslanger’s ameliorative methodology in\nfact yields more than one satisfying target concept: one that\n“corresponds to Haslanger’s proposed concept and captures\nthe sense of gender as an imposed social class”; another that\n“captures the sense of gender as a lived identity”\n(Jenkins 2016, 397). The latter of these allows us to include trans\nwomen into women’s social kind, who on Haslanger's social class\napproach to gender would inappropriately have been excluded. \n\nIn addition to her revisionary argument, Haslanger has suggested that\nher ameliorative analysis of woman may not be as revisionary\nas it first seems (2005, 2006). Although successful in their reference\nfixing, ordinary language users do not always know precisely what they\nare talking about. Our language use may be skewed by oppressive\nideologies that can “mislead us about the content of our own\nthoughts” (Haslanger 2005, 12). Although her gender terminology\nis not intuitive, this could simply be because oppressive ideologies\nmislead us about the meanings of our gender terms. Our everyday gender\nterminology might mean something utterly different from what we\nthink it means; and we could be entirely ignorant of\nthis. Perhaps Haslanger's analysis, then, has captured our everyday\ngender vocabulary revealing to us the terms that we actually employ:\nwe may be applying ‘woman’ in our everyday language on the\nbasis of sex-marked subordination whether we take ourselves to be\ndoing so or not. If this is so, Haslanger's gender terminology is not\nradically revisionist. \n\nSaul (2006) argues that, despite it being possible that we unknowingly\napply ‘woman’ on the basis of social subordination, it is\nextremely difficult to show that this is the case.  This would require\nshowing that the gender terminology we in fact employ is\nHaslanger's proposed gender terminology. But discovering the grounds\non which we apply everyday gender terms is extremely difficult\nprecisely because they are applied in various and idiosyncratic ways\n(Saul 2006, 129). Haslanger, then, needs to do more in order to show\nthat her analysis is non-revisionary. \n\nCharlotte Witt (2011a; 2011b) argues for a particular\nsort of gender essentialism, which Witt terms\n‘uniessentialism’. Her motivation and starting point is\nthe following: many ordinary social agents report gender being\nessential to them and claim that they would be a different person were\nthey of a different sex/gender. Uniessentialism attempts to understand\nand articulate this. However, Witt's work departs in important\nrespects from the earlier (so-called) essentialist or gender realist\npositions discussed in Section 2: Witt does not posit some essential\nproperty of womanhood of the kind discussed above, which failed to\ntake women's differences into account. Further, uniessentialism\ndiffers significantly from those position developed in response to the\nproblem of how we should conceive of women's social kind. It is not\nabout solving the standard dispute between gender nominalists and\ngender realists, or about articulating some supposedly shared property\nthat binds women together and provides a theoretical ground for\nfeminist political solidarity. Rather, uniessentialism aims to make\ngood the widely held belief that gender is constitutive of who we\nare.[9] \n\nUniessentialism is a sort of individual essentialism. Traditionally\nphilosophers distinguish between kind and individual essentialisms:\nthe former examines what binds members of a kind together and what do\nall members of some kind have in common qua members of that\nkind. The latter asks: what makes an individual the\nindividual it is. We can further distinguish two sorts of individual\nessentialisms: Kripkean identity essentialism and Aristotelian\nuniessentialism. The former asks: what makes an\nindividual that individual? The latter, however, asks a\nslightly different question: what explains the unity of individuals?\nWhat explains that an individual entity exists over and above the sum\ntotal of its constituent parts? (The standard feminist debate over\ngender nominalism and gender realism has largely been about kind\nessentialism. Being about individual essentialism, Witt's\nuniessentialism departs in an important way from the standard debate.)\nFrom the two individual essentialisms, Witt endorses the Aristotelian\none. On this view, certain functional essences have a unifying role:\nthese essences are responsible for the fact that material parts\nconstitute a new individual, rather than just a lump of stuff or a\ncollection of particles. Witt's example is of a house: the essential\nhouse-functional property (what the entity is for, what its purpose\nis) unifies the different material parts of a house so that there is a\nhouse, and not just a collection of house-constituting particles\n(2011a, 6). Gender (being a woman/a man) functions in a similar\nfashion and provides “the principle of normative unity”\nthat organizes, unifies and determines the roles of social individuals\n(Witt 2011a, 73). Due to this, gender is a uniessential property of\nsocial individuals.  \n\nIt is important to clarify the notions of gender\nand social individuality that Witt employs. First, gender is\na social position that “cluster[s] around the engendering\nfunction … women conceive and bear … men beget”\n(Witt 2011a, 40). These are women and men's socially mediated\nreproductive functions (Witt 2011a, 29) and they differ from the\nbiological function of reproduction, which roughly corresponds to sex\non the standard sex/gender distinction. Witt writes: “to be a\nwoman is to be recognized to have a particular function in\nengendering, to be a man is to be recognized to have a different\nfunction in engendering” (2011a, 39). Second, Witt\ndistinguishes persons (those who possess\nself-consciousness), human beings (those who are biologically\nhuman) and social individuals (those who occupy social\npositions synchronically and diachronically). These ontological\ncategories are not equivalent in that they possess different\npersistence and identity conditions. Social individuals are bound by\nsocial normativity, human beings by biological normativity. These\nnormativities differ in two respects: first, social norms differ from\none culture to the next whereas biological norms do not; second,\nunlike biological normativity, social normativity requires “the\nrecognition by others that an agent is both responsive to and\nevaluable under a social norm” (Witt 2011a, 19). Thus, being a\nsocial individual is not equivalent to being a human being. Further,\nWitt takes personhood to be defined in terms of intrinsic\npsychological states of self-awareness and\nself-consciousness. However, social individuality is defined in terms\nof the extrinsic feature of occupying a social position, which depends\nfor its existence on a social world. So, the two are not equivalent:\npersonhood is essentially about intrinsic features and could exist\nwithout a social world, whereas social individuality is essentially\nabout extrinsic features that could not exist without a social\nworld. \n \nWitt's gender essentialist argument crucially pertains to social\nindividuals, not to persons or human beings: saying that persons\nor human beings are gendered would be a category mistake. But why is\ngender essential to social individuals? For Witt, social individuals\nare those who occupy positions in social reality. Further,\n“social positions have norms or social roles associated with\nthem; a social role is what an individual who occupies a given social\nposition is responsive to and evaluable under” (Witt 2011a,\n59). However, qua social individuals, we occupy multiple\nsocial positions at once and over time: we can be women, mothers,\nimmigrants, sisters, academics, wives, community organisers and\nteam-sport coaches synchronically and diachronically. Now, the issue\nfor Witt is what unifies these positions so that a\nsocial individual is constituted. After all, a bundle of\nsocial position occupancies does not make for an individual (just as a\nbundle of properties like being white, cube-shaped\nand sweet do not make for a sugar cube). For Witt, this\nunifying role is undertaken by gender (being a woman or a man): it\nis \n \nBy ‘normative unity’, Witt means the following: given our\nsocial roles and social position occupancies, we are responsive to\nvarious sets of social norms. These norms are “complex patterns\nof behaviour and practices that constitute what one ought to do in a\nsituation given one's social position(s) and one's social\ncontext” (Witt 2011a, 82). The sets of norms can conflict: the\nnorms of motherhood can (and do) conflict with the norms of being an\nacademic philosopher. However, in order for this conflict to exist,\nthe norms must be binding on a single social\nindividual. Witt, then, asks: what explains the existence and unity of\nthe social individual who is subject to conflicting social norms? The\nanswer is gender. \n \nGender is not just a social role that unifies social individuals. Witt\ntakes it to be the social role — as she puts it, it\nis the mega social role that unifies social agents. First,\ngender is a mega social role if it satisfies two conditions (and Witt\nclaims that it does): (1) if it provides the principle of synchronic\nand diachronic unity of social individuals, and (2) if it inflects and\ndefines a broad range of other social roles. Gender satisfies the\nfirst in usually being a life-long social position: a social\nindividual persists just as long as their gendered social position\npersists. Further, Witt maintains, trans people are not\ncounterexamples to this claim: transitioning entails that the old\nsocial individual has ceased to exist and a new one has come into\nbeing. And this is consistent with the same person persisting and\nundergoing social individual change via transitioning. Gender\nsatisfies the second condition too. It inflects other social roles,\nlike being a parent or a professional. The expectations attached to\nthese social roles differ depending on the agent's gender, since\ngender imposes different social norms to govern the execution of the\nfurther social roles. Now, gender — as opposed to some other\nsocial category, like race — is not just a mega social role; it\nis the unifying mega social role. Cross-cultural and trans-historical\nconsiderations support this view. Witt claims that patriarchy is a\nsocial universal (2011a, 98). By contrast, racial categorisation\nvaries historically and cross-culturally, and racial oppression is not\na universal feature of human cultures. Thus, gender has a better claim\nto being the social role that is uniessential to social\nindividuals. This account of gender essentialism not only explains\nsocial agents' connectedness to their gender, but it also provides a\nhelpful way to conceive of women's agency — something that is\ncentral to feminist politics. \n\nLinda Alcoff holds that feminism faces an identity crisis: the\ncategory of women is feminism's starting point, but various critiques\nabout gender have fragmented the category and it is not clear how\nfeminists should understand what it is to be a woman (2006, chapter\n5). In response, Alcoff develops an account of gender as\npositionality whereby “gender is, among other things, a\nposition one occupies and from which one can act politically”\n(2006, 148). In particular, she takes one's social position to foster\nthe development of specifically gendered identities (or\nself-conceptions): “The very subjectivity (or subjective\nexperience of being a woman) and the very identity of women are\nconstituted by women's position” (Alcoff 2006, 148). Alcoff\nholds that there is an objective basis for distinguishing individuals\non the grounds of (actual or expected) reproductive roles: \n\nThe thought is that those standardly classified as\nbiologically female, although they may not actually be able to\nreproduce, will encounter “a different set of practices,\nexpectations, and feelings in regard to reproduction” than those\nstandardly classified as male (Alcoff 2006, 172). Further, this\ndifferential relation to the possibility of reproduction is used as\nthe basis for many cultural and social phenomena that position women\nand men: it can be  \n\nReproduction, then, is an objective basis for distinguishing\nindividuals that takes on a cultural dimension in that it positions\nwomen and men differently: depending on the kind of body one has,\none's lived experience will differ. And this fosters the construction\nof gendered social identities: one's role in reproduction helps\nconfigure how one is socially positioned and this conditions the\ndevelopment of specifically gendered social identities. \n\nSince women are socially positioned in various different contexts,\n“there is no gender essence all women share” (Alcoff 2006,\n147–8). Nonetheless, Alcoff acknowledges that her account is\nakin to the original 1960s sex/gender distinction insofar as sex\ndifference (understood in terms of the objective division of\nreproductive labour) provides the foundation for certain cultural\narrangements (the development of a gendered social identity). But,\nwith the benefit of hindsight \n\nThat is, her view avoids the implausible claim that sex is exclusively\nto do with nature and gender with culture. Rather, the distinction on\nthe basis of reproductive possibilities shapes and is shaped by the\nsorts of cultural and social phenomena (like varieties of social\nsegregation) these possibilities gives rise to. For instance,\ntechnological interventions can alter sex differences illustrating\nthat this is the case (Alcoff 2006, 175).  Women's specifically\ngendered social identities that are constituted by their context\ndependent positions, then, provide the starting point for feminist\npolitics. \n\nThis entry first looked at feminist arguments against biological\ndeterminism and the claim that gender is socially constructed. Next,\nit examined feminist critiques of prevalent understandings of gender\nand sex, and the distinction itself. In response to these concerns,\nthe final section looked at how a unified women's category could be\narticulated for feminist political purposes and illustrated (at least)\ntwo things. First, that gender — or what it is to be a\nwoman or a man — is still very much a live issue. Second, that\nfeminists have not entirely given up the view that gender is about\nsocial factors and that it is (in some sense) distinct from\nbiological sex.  The jury is still out on what the best, the most\nuseful or (even) the correct definition of gender is. And some\ncontemporary feminists still find there to be value in the original\n1960s sex/gender distinction.","contact.mail":"mari.mikkola@philosophy.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"philosophy.ox.ac.uk"}]
