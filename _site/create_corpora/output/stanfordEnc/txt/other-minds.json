At a superficial glance it can look as if there is\nagreement about what the problem is and how we might address it. But\non closer inspection one finds there is little agreement either about\nthe problem or the solution to it. Indeed, there is little agreement\nabout whether there is a problem here at all. What seems clear is that\nthere was a period in philosophy, roughly around the mid-twentieth\ncentury, when there was much discussion about other minds. The problem\nhere has most commonly been thought to arise within epistemology: how\ndo I know (or how can I justify the belief) that other beings exist\nwho have thoughts, feelings and other mental attributes? One standard\nline of reply to this question has been to appeal to analogy, another\nto best explanation. A less standard approach has been to appeal to\ncriteria. Connected with this approach, and fueled by the later work\nof Ludwig Wittgenstein, some philosophers argue that the real\nproblem of other minds is conceptual: why do I so much as think that\nthere are other thinking, feeling beings? Both the conceptual and the\nepistemological problems may be thought to be connected with a more\ngeneral metaphysical problem of understanding what minds and mental\nstates are.\n\n\nIn analytic philosophy, towards the end of the twentieth century,\ninterest in these problems waned, but there has been a revival of\ninterest in recent years. This is in part due to the fact that\nphilosophers have begun to explore in earnest the possibility that we\ncome by our knowledge of other minds in much the same way that we come\nby our knowledge of objects in the world—by perception. This\npossibility is also explored in phenomenology and in recent times\nphilosophers schooled in both the analytic and phenomenological\ntraditions have contributed to discussion of this topic. Some\nphilosophers have found inspiration even further afield, in the texts\nof Indian Buddhist philosophers. Philosophical interest in other minds\nhas also been stimulated by work in psychology and neuroscience. A\nmore naturalistic turn in philosophy has led to questions concerning\nour understanding of others. One might see this work as leaving behind\ntraditional epistemological concerns with radical scepticism,\naddressing instead the question of how we go about ascribing mental\nstates to others—a question that can be asked not just of adult\nhumans, but of infants (when and how do they come to ascribe mental\nstates to others), and also of other, non-human, animals. Furthermore,\none can consider the possibility of a deficit in the capacity to\nattribute minds to others and how this might manifest itself in, for\nexample, autism.\n\n\nThe traditional epistemological problem of other minds is often\nassociated with scepticism. The sceptic raises a doubt about the\npossibility of knowledge in connection with the mind of another, a\ndoubt which is thought to follow from a more general doubt raised by\nDescartes concerning our knowledge of the external world. This latter\ndoubt arises in stages, each of which is designed to draw us into a\nmore wide-reaching scepticism: at stage one it is observed that the\nsenses sometimes deceive; at stage two the possibility of an extended\ndream is considered; and at stage three the possibility is introduced\nthat there is an Evil Demon deceiving me to think that there is a\nworld beyond how things appear. It is with the third stage that\nDescartes thought we encounter the possibility of universal doubt\nabout an entire domain, in this case the external world. Descartes has\nfound a way to retreat into his own mind, where he claims to find both\nknowledge and truth: I can know how things appear to me; external\nthings are now in doubt. Cartesian doubt is radical and it\nhas been raised by philosophers not just in connection with our\nknowledge of the external world, but also of the past, induction, and\nother minds.  \nIn connection with other minds, we might press Descartes’ first\nsceptical consideration, thus: I am sometimes deceived about what\nanother is thinking or feeling. But, as with the external world, this\nis not sufficient for radical doubt concerning others. Radical doubt\nmay be thought to arise when one presses the third sceptical\nconsideration, the possibility that an Evil Demon (or mad scientist)\nhas contrived that all others apart from myself are\nautomata/zombies—non-thinking, non-feeling individuals who move\nin a manner similar to the way I move. We can associate a\n‘thin’ sceptical problem with the former doubt and a\n‘thick’ sceptical problem with the latter (Avramides\n2015). The former is a problem we grapple with in our everyday lives;\nthe latter is a distinctively philosophical problem. It is the thick\nskeptical problem that leads to the possibility of\nsolipsism—that I am alone in the universe. \nOnce one teases out a thin from a thick problem, one can ask the\nfollowing: (i) does any proposed response to the thick problem help\nwith the thin?; (ii) does having knowledge (in any domain) depend upon\na solution to the thick problem?; and (iii) are there any further\nquestions that can be raised with respect to other minds beyond those\nassociated with these two sceptical problems? It is fair to say that\nlittle to no consideration was paid to question (i) in the past. It is\nthe threat of solipsism that largely preoccupied philosophers—at\nleast until more recently. (ii) has received much discussion in recent\ndecades. Epistemologists who favor an externalist approach (e.g.,\nGoldman, Nozick, Dretske) concentrate on the question of what\nothers think and feel. In line with the general externalist approach,\nthese philosophers hold that there can be knowledge despite there\nbeing no response to the radical sceptical challenge. Others agree\nthat having knowledge does not require responding to this challenge,\nbut not because they believe that there is no response here but\nbecause they believe that the correct account of knowledge leaves no\nroom for such a challenge (McDowell 1982). With respect to (iii),\nZahavi (2014) has identified a further question that he labels the\nwhy question. In our everyday encounters with, and\nunderstanding of, others we want to know not only what they think and\nfeel, but also why they think and feel as they do and what this means\nto them. \nNot everyone takes the epistemological problem here to be a radical\nskeptical one. Some see the problem as arising from reflection on an\napparent asymmetry in the way I know about my own and another’s\nmind: in my own case, at least most of the time, I know what I think\nand feel directly and without inference from any evidence (the\nqualification here is designed to reflect the fact that one can, at\ntimes, learn about one’s own mental states from others—see\nAustin 1946 [1979: 110]); in the case of others, all access to what\nthey think or feel is thought to be indirect, mediated by the\nother’s behavior. Hyslop, for example, writes, “the\nproblem of other minds is generated by an asymmetry in respect of\nknowledge” (1995: 6; cf. Davidson 1991 [2001]). Gomes (2018) has\nlabeled the epistemological problem raised by attention to this\nasymmetry the problem of sources, which he distinguishes from\nthe problem of error. Gomes finds the problem of sources in\nthe work of Austin (1946 [1979])\nwho begins his discussion of other minds by asking, “How do we\nknow that, for example, another individual is angry?”, a\nquestion which Austin distinguishes from, “Do we (ever)\nknow…?” (cf. Cassam 2007 and Nozick 1981). \nIt is worth pausing to consider the seriousness of the problem of\nknowing others. While some draw a parallel between the problem of\ngaining knowledge of the past and of another mind, there is an\nimportant asymmetry to be noted here: in the case of the past it is at\nleast logically possible that there should be direct knowledge, while\nin the case of another mind such knowledge seems to be logically ruled\nout. As A.J. Ayer writes:  \nIt can be argued that one’s position to observe a past event is\ndue to the accident of one’s position in time…. But it is\nnot an accident that one is not someone else. (1953 [1954:\n216–217])  \n(Discussions linking knowledge of other minds and the past provide a\nrich vein of philosophical discussion; see, for example, Dummett 1969,\nWright 1980, and McDowell 1998.) It may be thought that there could be\na way of knowing another’s mind—say by telepathy—and\nthat it is simply a contingent fact that this is not a way that is\nopen to human beings. Telepathy would allow one to know\nanother’s thoughts and feelings by coming to share them. The\nproblem, however, is that if I have your\nexperiences, then those experiences are mine and not\nyours. As Ayer writes: “In this respect telepathy is no\nbetter than the telephone” (1953 [1954: 196]; cf. Austin 1946\nand Wisdom 1940). \nPhilosophers, thus, find themselves saddled with the question, How do\nI know that others have minds? One can put the emphasis on the word\n“know” and raise a sceptical question parallel to\nthe one Descartes raises in connection with our knowledge of the\nexternal world, or one can put the emphasis on the word\n“how” and question the source of our knowledge given that\nI am not in a position to have direct knowledge of the mind of\nanother. \nWhile it may be the case that different considerations can give rise\nto an epistemological problem concerning other minds, on the whole\nwhat appears to have pre-occupied philosophers in the period under\nconsideration (mid-twentieth century) was the question of solipsism,\nthe question of whether I am alone in the universe. While it is often\naccepted that I cannot be certain that I am not alone, it is thought\nthat it can be shown that we have good reason to believe that the\nothers I encounter are like me in having thoughts and feelings. One\nform of reasoning has been taken to be “traditional” in\nthis connection: the argument from analogy (Blackburn 1994).\nAnalogical reasoning cites similarities between two things and uses\nthis as support for concluding that further similarities may be taken\nto exist. Like all forms of inferential reasoning, analogical\nreasoning is employed in order to expand knowledge in the face of\nuncertainty (Bartha 2016). \nA statement of the argument from analogy can be found in the writing\nof J.S. Mill. In reply to the question,  \nBy what evidence do I know, or by what considerations am I led to\nbelieve… that the walking and speaking figures which I see and\nhear, have sensations and thoughts, or in other words, possess Minds?\n \nMill writes: \nFirst, they have bodies like me, which I know in my own case, to be\nthe antecedent condition of feelings; and because, secondly, they\nexhibit the acts, and outward signs, which in my own case I know by\nexperience to be caused by feelings. (1865 [1872: 243]) \nWhile this argument was once popular (see, e.g., Russell 1923;\nHampshire 1952), it soon came to be considered unfit for purpose due\nto the following considerations. Firstly, it was pointed out that\nwhile this way of proceeding may work in certain domains, in the case\nof other minds the conclusion is logically uncheckable (Locke 1968).\nSecondly, it was considered problematic that this way of extending\none’s knowledge proceeds from a single case (Locke 1968). And\nthirdly, it was claimed that the very first premise of this argument\n(I know in my own case) is problematic (Malcolm 1958). \nVarious attempts have been made to salvage the argument. Against the\nfirst of these considerations it has been pointed out that we\nsuccessfully appeal to analogy when extending our knowledge from the\npresent to the past. However, Hyslop and Jackson (1972) remind us that\nthis defense fails to register the fact that the impossibility of\nchecking the conclusion in the case of other minds is logical\n(cf.\n §1),\n and prefer to defend appeal to analogy here by suggesting that, while\nthis is true, it is not “obviously relevant”. They also\nsuggest that the fact that the conclusion here cannot be verified may\nbe “neutralized” by the fact that it also cannot be\nrefuted (1972: 169–170). \nHyslop and Jackson also propose an alternative to the standard defense\nof the argument from analogy from the second of the above\nconsiderations. The standard defense insists that the argument does\nnot proceed from a single case and that there are innumerable\ninstances and many different contexts in which one observes a mental\nstate and its associated behavior (Ayer 1956: 219–222); cf. Mill who writes that\nanalogy is an “inferior degree of inductive evidence” that\nonly works by providing one with an hypothesis which is then verified\nby further correlations, 1865 [1872: 260]). According to Hyslop &\nJackson, however, there is no need to appeal to multiple cases here\njust so long as one can establish a link between mental states and\nbehavior, something they claim can be done from observation of\none’s own case (cf. Hill 1984). Hyslop (1995) warns that we must\nbe careful here not to appeal to the (invalid) principle that like\neffects (behavior) have like causes (mental states)—your\nbehavior may have a purely physical cause. We should instead appeal to\nthe (valid) principle that like causes have like effects: what I\nobserve in my own case leads me to hypothesize that my mental states\nare caused by physical states of my body, and I can argue that like\nphysical states in others will cause like mental states. This, in\neffect, is to invoke the principle of the Uniformity of Nature; it is\nthis principle that Hyslop believes lies at the heart of the argument\nfrom analogy. While many consider that generalization from a single\ninstance is a crucial weakness in the argument from analogy, Hyslop\ntakes this to be the argument’s strength. Indeed, he holds that\nthe other main contender in the field, the argument from scientific\ninference/best explanation fails precisely because it does not take\ninto account a crucial dependence on our own case when it comes to\nknowledge of other minds (cf.\n §1.2). \nThe third of the arguments that have been brought to bear against the argument from analogy requires careful consideration. The very\npremise that Hyslop believes recommends this way of supporting\none’s belief in other minds is the one that some have thought to\nbe irremediably problematic. Malcolm, inspired by the later work of\nWittgenstein, has suggested that the premise—I know from my own\ncase what it is like to think and feel—is committed to what he\ncalls the “fundamental error” of thinking that one learns\nwhat thoughts and feelings are from one’s own case (Malcolm\n1958: 974). This way of coming to learn about mind is associated with\nwhat is sometimes thought of as an ‘inward glance’ or\nintrospection (cf. Locke 1689). It has been argued that this way of\nlearning about mind or mental states is committed to the possibility\nof a private language (Wittgenstein 1953; Malcolm 1954). According to\nMalcolm, Wittgenstein advances both an “internal” and an\n“external” attack on the possibility of such a language\n(Malcolm 1954 [1966: 75]). The internal attack aims to show that,\nwhile a genuine language requires that one be able to articulate\ncorrectness conditions for the application of a word, it is not\npossible to articulate such conditions when the referent of the word\nis not intersubjectively available. As Wittgenstein points out:\n“Whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only\nmeans that here we can’t talk about ‘right’”\n(1953: §258). (For a\nstatement of the “external” attack here see\n §2.)\n The private language argument aside, the suggestion that I can come\nto know about mental states from my own case leads to a conception of\nmind as something not observable in behavior but as something lying\nbehind and causing behavior. Malcolm contrasts this way of thinking\nwith what he labels a criterial view of the relationship\nbetween mind and behavior. Much ink has been spilled over trying to\nunderstand this proposed alternative way of thinking of mind in\nrelation to behavior (see\n §1.3).\n However we understand this proposal, it is important to appreciate\nthe difficulties thought to be associated with the idea that one\nlearns from one’s own case what it is to think and feel: it is\nbelieved to lead inexorably to solipsism. (This was something arguably\nfirst appreciated by Thomas Reid; see\n §4.1).\n It should, however, be noted that solipsism comes in two varieties:\nepistemological and conceptual. While the argument from analogy is\nproposed as a way of avoiding the former, it is arguable that it is\nreally the latter to which Malcolm and others are drawing our\nattention. In effect, the claim here is that use of the argument from\nanalogy as a way of avoiding epistemological solipsism (the only mind\nI can know is my own) falls foul of conceptual solipsism (the only\nmind I can think about is my own). Discussion of the conceptual\nproblem in connection with other minds may be thought to take us in a\ndirection at odds with that taken when one approaches these matters\nfrom an epistemological perspective (for the conceptual problem see\n §2.) \nThe argument from best explanation has been advocated as an advance on\nthe argument from analogy. While Hyslop insists that any justification\nfor my belief in other minds must make crucial reference to\none’s own case, it has been argued that not needing to\nrely on such reference makes the argument from best explanation\npreferable as an account of how we justify our belief here (Pargetter\n1984). Whether or not one pauses to assess the relative merits of\nthese two ways of defending the rationality of our belief in other\nminds, what is undoubtedly the case is that the argument from best\nexplanation is—either explicitly or implicitly—a form of\nargument that enjoys wide acceptance today. David Chalmers, for\nexample, writes, “It …seems that this [argument from best\nexplanation] is as good a solution to the problem of other minds as we\nare going to get” (1996: 246). \nWhile the argument from analogy was once popular in science (Hyslop\n& Jackson (1972) cite the example of the discovery of helium on\nthe sun to have a characteristic spectrum by analogy with the\ncharacteristic spectrum of helium on earth) in more recent times\nscience has tended to proceed in accordance with the principle that it\nis rational to believe that hypothesis that provides the best\navailable explanation of a particular phenomenon at a given time. This\nstyle of argument is sometimes referred to as abduction, and it is\nplaced alongside deduction and enumerative induction as another form\nof inferential reasoning. While simple enumerative inductive takes one\nfrom certain observations to the conclusion that one can expect more\nof the same, abduction allows for the introduction of entities that\nare not just unobserved, but that are unobservable (Lipton 2000;\nHarman 1965). \nIt is claimed that my reason for believing that others have minds\nsimilar to my own can be taken to be the same as the scientific\nrealist’s reason for believing in the existence of electrons or\nother theoretical entities. On this way of thinking, mental states are\ntaken to be inner states of an individual that provide the best\nexplanation of the behavior we observe in others; any other\nexplanation would be implausible. Pargetter (1984) considers the\nfollowing as implausible alternative hypotheses: (i) God is working\nothers like puppets; (ii) I am unique in having mental states as the\ncause of behavior; and (iii) that others have mental states but they\nare of an entirely different nature to my own. \nAccording to Pargetter, the argument from best explanation is able to\nbypass all criticisms standardly brought to bear against the argument\nfrom analogy, as it relies solely on the explanatory power of the\nproposed hypothesis—in this case, that others have minds. This\nform of reasoning is also held to be superior to reasoning from\nanalogy as it can be used to establish the existence of minds in\nindividuals of other species whose behavior may not be similar to mine\nor who think and feel in ways that are dissimilar to the way\nthat I think and feel. It may also be used to justify the belief in\nminds of (abnormal) humans who may either behave very differently or\nthink and feel very differently from their conspecifics. \nMelnyk (1994) has argued that there is an important disanalogy between\nthe scientific realist’s reason for believing in theoretical\nentities and an ordinary person’s reason for believing that\nother people have minds. His argument rests on the observation that\ngross behavioral evidence is insufficient for belief in another mind\nwithout additional reference to what one knows from one’s own\ncase. Melnyk can be read as advocating a hybrid account of our\nknowledge here, incorporating elements from the argument from analogy\nas a supplement to the inference from best explanation. But he also\nmakes the following, important, observation: “A complete\nresponse to the problem of other minds seems obliged to incorporate\nmore than one approach, and may have to incorporate several”\n(1994: 487). This is an observation others have also begun to advocate\n(see\n §3.2).\n  \nIt has been suggested that an alternative to the view that mind lies\nbehind and serves as the cause of behavior is the view that behavior\nserves as the criterion of mind (see\n §1.1).\n The former conception of mind in relation to behavior is associated\nwith the following ideas: (i) my mind is private to me; (ii) I am both\ninfallible and incorrigible with respect to my own mental states; and\n(iii) I can know my own mental state without having to observe\nanything about my body. This picture of mind is bolstered by the\nthought that, whatever another person says or does, it is always\npossible that they are deceiving me about what is going on in their\nminds—an extreme version of which leads to the thought that I am\nentirely deceived and all others are mere automata or zombies. In\nshort, this conception of mind leads to the traditional\nepistemological problem of other minds. Standard responses to this\nproblem—arguments from analogy and best explanation—draw a\nparallel between knowledge of another’s mind and explanation in\nscience. In this connection Wittgenstein writes: “Misleading\nparallel: psychology treats of processes in the psychical sphere, as\ndoes physics in the physical” (1953: §571).\nIn The Blue Book\n(24–25) Wittgenstein contrasts the business of citing criteria\nwith that of giving symptoms in answer to the question, “How do\nyou know?” He associates the giving of symptoms with the making\nof hypotheses; he associates the citing of criteria with “the\ngrammar (the use)” of a word or with linguistic convention (1958:\n23). \nIt has not proved an easy thing for philosophers to understand what\nWittgenstein means here (see Albritton 1959; Shoemaker 1963; Kenny 1967; Baker 1974). What\none can say is that a criterial relation between mind and behavior is\ndesigned to be distinct from, on the one hand, logical entailment, and\non the other, inductive inference. Some see a connection between a\ncriterial relation here and the possibility of perceptual knowledge of\nanother’s mind (McDowell 1982, Hacker 1997; see\n §1.4.1).\n Those that advocate a criterial relation between mind and behavior\nalso tend to understand the problem of other minds to be a conceptual\none (see\n §2).\n As well as being associated with the rejection of a certain\nconception of mind that can be labeled ‘Cartesian’, appeal\nto a criterial relationship between mind and behavior is often thought\nto form part of an anti-sceptical stance in connection with\nothers. \nSome have seen in the appeal to criteria nothing but a form of\nbehaviorism. Chihara and Fodor (1965) are among such philosophers, and\ntheir work has served to turn the tide against talk of criteria as a\nway of understanding the relationship between mental states and\nbehavior. Chihara and Fodor sum up the Wittgensteinian argument as\nfollows: if we are justified in claiming that one can tell or\ndetermine that a predicate ‘Y’ applies on the basis\nof the presence of X then either X is a criterion of\nY or X can be shown to be correlated with Y. They\nthen claim that this overlooks the possibility that in some cases the\njustification for the application of a predicate rests on an appeal to\nthe “simplicity, plausibility and predictive adequacy of an\nexplanatory system as a whole” (1965: 411). They point out that\nscientists use this method of explanation when it comes to the\ndetection of particles that are not directly observable (see\n §1.2).\n Chihara and Fodor agree with the Wittgensteinian who holds that the\nchild does not learn about mental states by introspection but rather\nlearns about complex relations between mental states and behavior in\nthe course of learning her language, but they point out that part of\nwhat the child learns is how to explain another’s behavior by\nreference to her thoughts and feelings and suggest that this may be\nthe result either of explicit training or of an innate capacity. \nWhether one is persuaded by Chihara and Fodor’s position against\nappeal to criteria will depend in part upon one’s assessment of\nthe correctness of thinking about mental states on the model of\nunobservables in science. Furthermore, it may be thought that to\nunderstand mental states to be entirely explanatory phenomena is\narguably to lose sight of the subjective aspect of these states.\nFinally, to think of mental states as lying behind and causing\nbehavior may be thought to break what some see as a deep connection\nbetween mentality and behavior, thereby opening up the possibility\nthat I am alone in the universe (Avramides 2013).  \nMany have continued to defend a criterial approach here. Crispin\nWright and John McDowell have written extensively on this topic, each\noffering a very different interpretation of the notion of a criterion.\nWhile the debate here is complex and interwoven with issues such as\nrealist vs anti-realist semantics, there is one thread in this debate\nthat is particularly relevant to the epistemological problem of other\nminds: the question of whether criteria should be thought of as\ndefeasible or indefeasible. Wright rightly sees this question as\nconnected with the question of whether appeal to criteria can provide\none with an anti-sceptical stance. Wright’s own understanding of\ncriteria turns on an important distinction between constituting\nknowledge that P and an entitlement to a knowledge-claim that\nP. While a sceptic can always challenge the truth of any claim to\nknow that which lies beyond the cognitive reach of the subject\n(examples here include the past and other minds), Wright suggests that\nthe sceptic can make no inroads when one pulls in one’s horns\nand simply makes a statement about the reasonableness of one’s\nbelief or claim to know in such cases. He then argues that\nreasonableness is secured if one can show that the criteria for the\nclaim that, for example, another is in pain are satisfied and one\nknows of no consideration that would defeat the claim—in other\nwords, just so long as one is using a word, e.g., “pain”,\nin accordance with the conventions in play in one’s linguistic\ncommunity. It is a consequence of this understanding of criteria that,\nwhile one may be in the best position to make a claim to know that Tom\nis in pain by observing his behavior, one’s claim is\ndefeasible—that is, it is open to being shown to be mistaken in\nthe light of further evidence. Importantly, to hold that behavioral\ncriteria are defeasible is not, according to Wright, to be committed\nto understanding behavior as ‘outer’ evidence (a symptom)\nof the other’s ‘inner’ mental states. Wright admits,\nhowever, that his position leaves room for scepticism: “a form\nof scepticism that is endemic in the very practice of assertion”\n(1984: [1993:\n 389–390]).[1] \nMcDowell is not content to concede any ground to the sceptic, and\nbelieves that appeal to criteria can confer (sceptic-proof) knowledge.\nBut for this to be the case, criteria must be understood to be\nindefeasible (McDowell 1982). McDowell finds an\nincompatibility between, on the one hand, the legitimacy of a\nknowledge ascription and, on the other, the possible of its falsity\n(its defeasibility). McDowell is not persuaded by Wright’s\nunderstanding of criteria, and proposes an alternative to it.\nMcDowell’s understanding of criteria is thought to form a part\nof his defense of a direct, perceptual, account of our knowledge of\nother minds (see\n §1.4.1).\n  \nThose who defend either the argument from analogy or from best\nexplanation are firmly of the view that any knowledge we may have of\nother minds (or any justification there may be for our belief in them)\nmust be indirect. They accept that, while our knowledge of our own\nmental states is direct, our knowledge of the mental states of others\nmust proceed by reasoning from what we observe—the other’s\nbehavior—to what we cannot observe—the other’s\nmental\n states.[2]\n The idea that the mind of another is not directly observable is one\nthat seems common to many philosophers. As early as the fifth century\nAD, St. Augustine writes: “For even when a living body is moved,\nthere is no way opened to our eyes to see the mind, a thing which\ncannot be seen by the eyes…” (De Trinitate 140;\ncf. Descartes 1641,\nSecond Meditation; and Berkeley 1710, Principle 148) The idea that we\nshould have direct knowledge of another’s mental states has also\ncome under fire more recently by Colin McGinn, who writes that direct\nperceptual reports specifying the mental states of another “seem\ndefinitely wrong” (1984: 123, n. 2; cf. Plantinga 1966:\n441). \nDirect knowledge is often associated with perception and it is this,\nas we have just seen, that so many philosophers have rejected in\nassociation with other minds. While our knowledge of the world of\nthings around us is taken to come about through perception, it has\nbeen thought that knowledge of another’s mind cannot come about\nby this\n means.[3]\n Nonetheless, we find Nathalie Duddington writing, “My object in\nthe present paper is to maintain that our knowledge of other minds is\nas direct and immediate as our knowledge of physical things”\n(1919: 147). It is not at all clear that philosophers at the time paid\nmuch attention to this very interesting paper, but philosophers today\nhave found in Duddington’s work a precursor for an idea that has\ncome to be taken very seriously—at least in some\n circles.[4] \nMany analytic philosophers in the past few decades have written in\ndefense of the idea that our knowledge of other minds comes about\nthrough perception (e.g., McDowell 1978 and 1982, Dretske 1969 and 1976, Cassam 2007, McNeil 2012, Stout 2010,\nand Green, 2010). The idea is also defended by some philosophers writing in\nthe phenomenological tradition\n (§1.4.2).\n Many philosophers working today bring together work in both\ntraditions in defense of this idea (e.g., Overgaard forthcoming, Krueger 2014, and J.\nSmith 2010). Consideration of\nissues to do with the self in relation to others has been thought by\nsome to have the power to bridge the chasm between these two\ntraditions in philosophy. \nThose attracted by the idea that our knowledge of other minds comes\nabout through perception often appeal to the following in defense of\ntheir position: we all acknowledge that we often claim to be in the\nposition where we can just see that another is angry, in\npain, and the like. These philosophers are careful to point out that\nwe don’t always claim that this is the case and we do not claim\nit with respect to all mental states, but they hold that attention to\nsuch cases can teach us that the mental is not always “withdrawn\nfrom direct engagement with the world” (McDowell 1995: 413).\nDuddington writes that to say that knowledge of another’s mind\ncan be direct and immediate is to say that there is no veil or barrier\nintervening between the knowing subject and what is known—it is\nnot to say either that our knowledge here is complete or that there\nare no difficulties that stand in the way of our attainment of such\nknowledge (1919: 167; cf. McDowell 1982). \nMcDowell has written that  \nwe should not jib at, or interpret away, the common-sense thought\nthat…one can literally perceive, in another person’s\nfacial expression or his behavior, that he is in pain, and not just\ninfer that he is in pain from what one perceives. (1978: 305)  \nMcDowell’s perceptual account involves two crucial moves, one\nconcerning our understanding of experience and the other concerning\nour understanding of behavior. He proposes that we think of our\nexperience as being “open” to the world, allowing objects\nto figure in it directly; and in a parallel fashion he proposes that\nwe think of behavior as giving expression to mental states thereby\nallowing them to figure in behavior (McDowell 1982, 1986). According\nto McDowell, when one has an experience of genuinely expressive\nbehavior, one is not actually experiencing the mental state of the\nother; nonetheless, behavior in the veridical case should not be\nthought to fall short of mind in such a way as to allow for the\npossibility of its total absence. McDowell believes that this\nunderstanding of experience and behavior can support (sceptic-proof)\nknowledge of both the world and other minds. \nThe challenge for McDowell is to explain how error can arise in both\ncases. To accommodate error, McDowell introduces a disjunctive\nunderstanding of both experience and behavior (McDowell 1982; Soteriou\n2016). Considering the former we can say: either our\nexperience is such as to yield access to the world or it is\nsuch as to yield only apparent access. Considering the latter we can\nsay: either the observed behavior is such as to be expressive\nof the other’s mentality or it only appears to be such.\nIn both cases the way things seem to the experiencing subject is such\nas to fall short of infallible knowledge as to which disjunct is in\nquestion (McDowell 1986 [1998: 240]). We may be fallible with respect\nto how things are in the world, but McDowell insists that we must be\ncareful to locate this fallibility in the right place. We should not\nconclude, as so many have, that all experience may be fallible; this\nis the move that paves the way for radical scepticism. It is, rather,\nour perceptual capacities that are fallible: sometimes they provide us\nwith experience which is veridical and sometimes they do not (McDowell\n2006). The important thing is that, when experience is veridical, we\ncan take it to give us (sceptic-proof) knowledge of the world. \nWhen it comes to our knowledge of other minds, the disjunctive move\nallows us to hold that, where behavior is genuinely expressive of\nanother’s mental life, there our experience of her behavior will\nyield (sceptic-proof) knowledge of another’s mental life.\nGenuinely expressive behavior is being thought of not as evidence (a\nsymptom) of another’s mental life but as a criterion of it.\nThis, McDowellian, understanding of criteria—in contrast to\nWright’s\n (§1.3)—requires\n that we accept behavior in at least some cases to be expressive of, a\ncriterion of, mental states. So understood, behavioral criteria are\nindefeasible. This is not to say that error is not possible,\nas the person I encounter may be deceiving me. However, in such cases\nthe criterion for the mental state is not satisfied. The important\nthing is that this possibility should not be taken to negate the fact\nthat, when the other person is not deceiving me, my experience of her\nbehavior can result in (sceptic-proof) knowledge that she is, for\nexample, in pain. The genuine possibility that others may deceive me\nshould not be taken to open up the possibility that all others may be\nzombies and that I am in the world\n alone.[5]\n (We may here consider something Wittgenstein writes (1992, 94e): “But of course it\nisn’t true that we are never certain about the mental processes\nin someone else. In countless cases we are.”) \nDretske’s defense of our direct, perceptual knowledge of another\nmind differs significantly from the one that is found in the work of\nMcDowell or Duddington. Dretske is not interested in scepticism, or in\ngiving an account of knowledge that is sceptic-proof. He is interested\nonly in saying how it is that we come to know what others think and\nfeel, to identify the source of our knowledge here (cf.\n §1).\n While we often say that we just can see that another thinks something\nor feels a certain way, it is also thought that there is an obstacle\nto taking perception to be a possible source of knowledge here.\nDretske identifies the obstacle here to arise from the fact that it is\ngenerally thought that another’s mind is unobservable: while one\ncan see the smile, the clenched fist or the hunched shoulder, one\ncannot see what lies behind these things (Dretske 1973: 36). While\nDretske agrees that you cannot see another’s joy, anger or\ndepression, he believes you can see (the fact) that another\nis happy, angry or depressed. The distinction here goes along with\nanother that Dretske draws between what he calls\n“non-epistemic” and “epistemic seeing”. The\nformer is a relation between a person and a thing (Dretske likens this\nrelation to stepping on a bug), while the latter has “positive\nbelief content” (Dretske 1966). He points out that just as one\ncan see that someone is wealthy without seeing their wealth, or see\nthat the metal rod is hot without seeing the heat, so one can see that\nanother is happy, angry, depressed and the like without seeing the\nother’s joy, anger or depression (Dretske 1966 and 1973).\nDretske suggests an analysis of epistemic seeing, which analysis\ncontains an all-important reliability condition: the conditions under\nwhich, for example, Sally sees that Tom is angry must be such that Tom\nwould not look angry to Sally unless he was angry. It is the\nsatisfaction of this reliability condition that allows the\nsatisfaction of the analysis to amount to both a visual and an\nepistemic\n achievement.[6] \nDretske appreciates that a given behavior on Tom’s part is not\nalways a reliable indicator of, say, anger. What he holds is that\nunder certain conditions and to those who know Tom well—such as\nhis wife—his behavior can be taken to be a reliable indicator of\nhis anger (for a critique of this idea see Avramides forthcoming).\nTherefore, according to Dretske, we can have direct perceptual\nknowledge of another’s mental states in the following sense: we\ncan see that others are in pain, angry and the like, even though we\ncannot see another’s mental states or know that solipsism is\n false.[7] \nThe late 19th and early twentieth centuries saw the\nemergence of the phenomenological movement associated with such\nfigures as Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Sartre. One important\ndimension of the work of these philosophers is discussion of\nintersubjectivity. There are two other philosophers in this tradition\nwhose work is also strongly associated with intersubjectivity, Max\nScheler and Edith Stein. It can be said of the phenomenological\napproach as a whole that it rejects the isolationism of the self that\ncharacterizes Cartesian philosophy. Scheler specifically criticizes\nthe argument from analogy, claiming (i) that it is mistaken in its\nstarting point or first premise and (ii) that it wrongly assumes that\nwe cannot have access to another’s mind. \nThe first premise of the argument from analogy is, in effect, the\nCartesian starting point: one is secure in the knowledge that one has\nof one’s own conscious experience. These phenomenologists reject\nthis starting point. In its place Husserl (1931) adopts the starting\npoint of embodied subjectivity, Heidegger (1927) insists that the\nstructure of human experience is such as to involve a relation to the\nworld and to others (Dasein is essentially characterized by\nMitsein), and Merleau-Ponty holds that “I find myself\nalready situated and involved in a physical and social world”\n(1945 [2003: 419]). Sartre takes things further and draws attention to\nthe extent to which the encounter with another is an encounter with\nsomeone who takes me as an object (1943). \nThese philosophers refuse to allow themselves to be pre-occupied by\nthe epistemological issues that they see as arising from a mistaken\nstarting point. Instead of asking how I can justify my belief in the\nworld and others, they take for granted that the individual’s\nexperience is such as to exist in a world and for others and address\nquestions that concern this starting point, such as: what makes this\nstarting point possible (Husserl & Merleau-Ponty); how can we\nexplain/understand the structures of the being of subjectivity in such\na way as to include the world and others (Heidegger); how do I\nencounter the Other (Sartre). Crucial to the defense of this\nnon-Cartesian starting point is a non-Cartesian conception of mind in\nrelation to body. The conceptual divide between mind and body that one\nfinds in Descartes’ philosophy is taken by these thinkers to be\n“inadequate to phenomenology” (Overgaard 2006). \nThese phenomenologists also reject the idea that we cannot have access\nto the mind of another. Scheler points out that  \nwe believe ourselves to be directly acquainted with another\nperson’s joy in his laughter, with his sorrow and pain in his\ntears, with his shame in his blushing  \nand the like (1913 [1954: 260]). And in the same paragraph Scheler\ninsists that we should not allow philosophical theory to tempt us away\nfrom the obvious: that we know the minds of others through perception.\nIn a similarly vein, Merleau-Ponty (1945 [2003: 415]) writes:  \nI perceive the grief or the anger of the other in his conduct, in his\nface or his hands, without recourse to any ‘inner’\nexperience of suffering or anger….  \nScheler suggests that philosophical theory tries to turn us away from\nthe obvious by insisting that “there is certainly no sensation\nof another person’s mind nor any stimulus from such a\nsource”, and he insists that to think like this is to turn\none’s back on the “expressive unity” of behavior\n(1913 [1954: 181]). He writes: “We can…have insight into\nothers, in so far as we treat their bodies as a field of expression\nfor their experiences” (1913 [1954: 10]). Whether we take\nknowledge here to come about either inference (as in the argument from\nanalogy) or though perception turns, according to Scheler, on the\nquestion of how one views the relationship between mind and\nbehavior. \nScheler considers a crying child and the various responses that one\nmay have to her. Firstly there is the possibility that one sees the\nface but does not see it as expressing distress. Secondly there is the\npossibility that one sees the face as expressive of distress while\nremaining indifferent. And finally, there is the situation where one\nsees the child’s distress and responds emotionally. Scheler\nassociates empathy with the second situation, and labels the emotional\nresponse in the final situation\n “sympathy.”[8]\n The relationship between perception and empathy is explored in\nsomewhat more detail in the work of both Husserl and his student Edith\nStein. While Husserl struggles with the idea of empathy in relation to\nothers throughout his career we find in Stein’s work a more\nsettled view (Zahavi 2014). Stein distinguishes empathy from\nperception, holding that empathy “is a kind of act of perceiving\nsui generis” (Stein 1917 [1989: 5]): it is like\nperception in so far as it is direct (like Scheler, Stein\nrejects the idea that knowledge of others comes about through\ninference); it is unlike perception in the way in which it gives us\nits object. Empathy is the way in which we experience foreign\nconsciousness. Stein follows Scheler in holding that our experience of\nthe other is an experience of a soul which is “always\nnecessarily a soul in a body” (1917 [1989: 44]), but she\nemphasizes the way in which this experience is always imperfect: there\nis always a distance between what I am aware of when I empathize with\nthe other and what the other is experiencing; I experience the other\nas other, as a center of intentionality or as a perspective\non the world that is different from mine (cf. Zahavi 2014: 192).\nWithout the distance introduced by an imperfect understanding—if\nunderstanding here could be perfect—I would be the other (cf.\nLevinas 1979: 89: “the absence of the other is exactly his\npresence as other”). It is this distance that Stein accuses\nScheler of failing to capture in his more straightforwardly perceptual\n account.[9]\n As well as appreciating the otherness of the other, there is an\nappreciation in the work of Stein and Scheler of the ethical nature of\nmy encounter with the other (cf. Levinas and Wittgenstein). \nIt is sometimes taken to be the case that perception and inference\nexhaust the alternatives when we consider how we might account for our\nknowledge of others. But, as we have seen in\n §1.4.2,\n Stein’s account eschews a straightforwardly perceptual account\nof our knowledge here without yet succumbing to an inferential one. It\nmay be more fruitful if one thought of the opposition here to be\nbetween indirect and direct accounts of our knowledge of others. What\nmany who oppose inference are against is the mind-body relationship\nupon which it is\n based.[10] \nThose that advocate a direct account of our knowledge of other minds\nare faced with the following question: does their account entail a\nrejection of the asymmetry that philosophers have identified between\nknowledge of one’s own and another’s mind (see\n §1)?\n Some philosophers who propose a direct account would insist that they\ncan still allow for an asymmetry here, just so long as we are careful\nhow we understand\n it.[11]\n They believe that we must be careful not to understand the asymmetry\nhere as committing us to a picture of mind as lying behind behavior.\nOne alternative to this picture can be found in the work of\nMerleau-Ponty who writes,  \nThe grief and anger of another have never quite the same significance\nfor him as they have for me. For him these situations are lived\nthrough, for me they are displayed. (Merleau-Ponty 1945 [2003: 415])\n \n(Cf. Wittgenstein 1992: 10e, who writes: “My words and my\nactions interest me in a completely different way than they do someone\nelse…I do not relate to them as an observer”.) \nThomas Nagel once wrote:  \nThe interesting problem of other minds is not the epistemological\nproblem… It is the conceptual problem, how I can\nunderstand the attribution of mental states to others. (1986:\n19-20)  \nBilgrami agrees (1992). Some philosophers go further than Nagel and\ninsist that the conceptual is the fundamental problem; others see\nlittle in it (Hyslop 1995). How one understands this problem is a\nmatter of some contention (Gomes 2011). What all agree is that the\nproblem is associated with the work of Wittgenstein, and in particular\nsection 302 from the Philosophical Investigations: \nIf one has to imagine someone else’s pain on the model of\none’s own, this is none too easy a thing to do: for I have to\nimagine pain which I do not feel on the model of pain which I\ndo feel. That is, what I have to do is not simply to make a\ntransition in imagination from one place of pain to another. As, from\nthe pain in the hand to pain in the arm. For I am not to imagine that\nI feel pain in some region of his body…. \nMalcolm understands 302 as providing an “external attack”\non the possibility of a private language (contrast the argument of\n §1.1).\n That is to say, 302 is designed to show the difficulty that one runs\ninto if one begins with the idea that one knows from one’s own\ncase what it is to feel pain: one risks conceptual solipsism.\n [12]\n Colin McGinn has suggested that the problem raised in 302 can be\nthought of in the following way: if I learn through introspection what\nit is, say, to be in pain, then there is a “a way of thinking\nabout my experiences which (a) only I have and (b) enters into my\nunderstanding of the concept in question” (1984: 127). The way I\nlearn about the object of my thought here is as something that has a\n“distinctively first-person element” from which it seems\nimpossible to prescind (ibid). This explains why I can make a\ntransition from the pain in my hand to the pain in my arm, but it is\n“none too easy a thing” to make a transition from a pain\nthat I feel in my hand to a pain that you feel somewhere in your body\n(for a very different interpretation of the 302, see Kripke 1982,\nPostscript). \nSome associate the conceptual problem here with the problem of coming\nto have mental concepts that are completely general. Evans has\nproposed that to have a thought about an object to the effect that it\nis F (consider: Tom is angry) requires the exercise of the\nfollowing two capacities: \nOne being the capacity to think of x, which could be equally\nexercised in thoughts about x to the effect that it is\nG or H; and the other being a conception of what it is\nto be F, which could be equally exercised in thoughts about\nother individuals, to the effect that they are F. (1982:\n75) \nEvans labels this the “generality constraint”\n(Ibid, ftnt. 15), and it has been thought to raise a problem\nfor thoughts about mental states if one takes it that one comes to\nknow what a mental state is by inward reflection alone. The problem,\nreflected in 302, is how to understand the extension to others of a\nconcept acquired in this way. \nP.F. Strawson in effect acknowledges the generality constraint when he\nwrites:  \nIt is a necessary condition of one’s ascribing states of\nconsciousness, experiences, to oneself, in the way that one does, that\none should also ascribe them, or be prepared to ascribe them, to\nothers who are not oneself. (1959: 99)  \nStrawson considers how it is that one ascribes mental states to others\nand concludes that one cannot do this if we insist on divorcing mental\nstates from the behaving body. Strawson claims that we must\nacknowledge what he calls the “primitiveness of the concept of a\nperson”, the concept of  \na type of entity such that both predicates ascribing states\nof consciousness and predicates ascribing corporeal\ncharacteristics…are equally applicable…. (1959:\n101–2) \nWhile many will accept that the conceptual problem is the\nfirst problem we encounter in connection with others, others\ngo further and claim that once one addresses the conceptual problem\nthere is no room for the epistemological one. This is because our way\nof thinking and talking about mind will have application to others\nbuilt into it from the start. It has been pointed out that to say what\nis required for grasp of a concept is not yet to show that that\nconcept is\n instantiated.[13]\n It can be said in reply that it is a particular proposed solution to\nthis conceptual problem that may be thought to make the\nepistemological question otiose. As we can see with Strawson’s\nproposal, the idea is that we break down the gap between mind and\nbehavior and understand what one experiences when one sees\nanother’s behavior as itself requiring mental state attributions\nto the other. Some can only see in this proposal a retreat into\nbehaviorism. Others, however, insist that this is not the\ncase—at least if behaviorism is understood as a reductionist\nthesis. It is not reductionist to hold that behavior is expressive of\nanother’s mental life; genuinely expressive behavior is held to\nbe distinguishable from ‘mere behavior’ (cf. Austin\n1946). \nMcDowell claims to echo Strawson’s work when he writes in this\nconnection that we must regain the concept of a human being\nfrom what he takes to be a “philosophically generated”\nconcept of a human body (McDowell 1982: 469; cf. Cook 1969). Some\ntake issue with McDowell over whether the latter is only a\nphilosophically generated concept (Wright 1998), but it is hard to\ndeny that the move from the former concept to the latter is deeply\nsignificant. \nAlvin Goldman (2006) has distinguished a descriptive from a normative\nepistemological problem of other minds.\n Section 1\n and\n section 2\n were largely concerned with the latter; this section will concern\nitself with the former. The descriptive problem is associated with\nwhat Goldman terms mind reading (or mentalizing).\nMind reading involves the capacity to think about mind and is a second\nor higher order activity that involves representing or conceptualizing\nothers (as well as oneself) as “loci of mental\nlife” (Goldman 2006: 3). While many species of animal may be\nthought to have minds, only some will be capable of representing\nanother as having minds. Questions of justification and conceptual\ndifficulty are not of concern to the descriptive theorist, nor are\nmetaphysical questions concerning the nature of mind; what concerns\nthe descriptive epistemologist is how what she says measures up with\nwhat is being learned in the empirical disciplines of developmental\npsychology and neuroscience. Work on the descriptive problem is\ndeveloping at a rapid pace and, while at first attention in all the\nrelevant disciplines was concentrated on two prominent accounts of\nmind reading—theory-theory and simulation theory—a variety\nof accounts now exist which challenge both of these accounts (see\n §3.2).\n  \nTheory-theory has its roots in a paper by Premack and Woodruff (1978),\nwhich argued that certain problem-solving behavior observed in\nchimpanzees should be taken as evidence that they possess a theory of\nmind, as evidence that they are able to make predictions about the\nbehavior of others that impute to them unobservable mental states.\nPremack and Woodruff take this imputation to be a rather primitive and\nunsophisticated reaction to the observation of certain behavior, so\nnatural in both humans and chimpanzees that it would take an effort to\nsuppress\n it.[14] \nIn their commentaries on this paper (1978), Dennett, Bennett, and\nHarman pointed out that further experimentation was required in order\nto determine whether a creature possesses the concept of belief (which\nconcept is required in order to have thoughts about another’s\nmental states). In particular, it would need to be shown that the\ncreature possesses the concept of false belief. Wimmer and\nPerner (1983) devised a test that purported to show just that. The\noriginal test was carried out with normally developing human children\nand taken to show that the capacity to represent false beliefs is\npresent in 4 to 6 year olds, but absent in 3 year\n olds.[15]\n Two different proposals have been put forward to explain this\ndevelopmental change. One proposal (see, e.g., Gopnik & Wellman\n1992) suggests that the child possesses a naïve psychological\ntheory that it uses to explain and predict the behavior of others and\nthat gets revised by the child over time. The other proposal (see,\ne.g., Leslie & Roth 1993) suggests a native, domain-specific (or\nmodular) mechanism that matures at a certain point as what explains\nthe child’s success with the false-belief test. \nThis approach to understanding how we attribute mental states to\nothers has several notable features: (i) it dovetails with the\ndominant approach to solving the knowledge-of-other-minds problem as\nit proposes that our belief here is the result of postulating mental\nstates as the best explanation of observed behavior; (ii) it dovetails\nwith a functionalist account of mind; and (iii) it can solve the\nasymmetry problem, as some hold the child comes to attribute mental\nstates to herself on the same model as she does others (Gopnik 2009).\nAll three features of this theory have come under criticism. This\napproach has also been challenged by further empirical work that\npurports to show that infants as young as 15 months have the concept\nof false belief (Onishi & Baillargeon 2005). One suggestion to\naccommodate this data is that we postulate two systems: one that\noperates in the infant and that is fast, efficient, inflexible and\nnon-normative, and another that develops later (and operates in tandem\nwith the earlier one in the mature human) and that is effortful,\ninflexible, normative and language-dependent (Apperly and Butterfill\n2009; for a good summary\nof this work and a critique of it, see Jacob forthcoming). \nRobert Gordon, Jane Heal and Alvin Goldman propose an alternative to\nthe theory-theory account of how to understand the attribution of\nmental states to others. Heal identifies in theory-theory a scientific\nmotivation that runs roughshod over important differences between\nhuman beings and the rest of the natural world. While theory-theorists\nextend a style of understanding from its application in connection\nwith the latter to the former, Heal and others propose that we come to\nunderstand what the other persons are thinking “from the\ninside”, that we “exploit the fact that we are or have\nminds” (Heal 1998 [2003: 84]). Heal is particularly concerned\nwith the question, What further thoughts will a person have given what\nthoughts I already know her to have? (Heal (1998) also traces out\nfurther questions about others that may concern us.) Gordon (1986,\n1995) insists that simulation theory must be formulated in such a way\nas to avoid reliance on both introspection and inference from oneself\nto the other. Rather than imagine what I would do in your situation,\nhe suggests that I imagine being you in your situation. In this way,\nthinking about others is taken to parallel understanding of\none’s own future behavior: one predicts what one will do by\nimagining or pretending that the world is a certain way. Simulation\ntheory has its roots in Verstehen theories favored by\nsociologists and historians such as Collingwood and Dilthey (as well\nas work by Lipps on empathy; for an overview here see Stueber\n2018). Simulation theory\nwas thought to be given neurophysiological backing by the discovery of\nmirror neurons in the pre-motor cortex and in Broca’s area of\nthe human brain that are activated both when an individual acts and\nwhen she observes the actions of another (Gallese and Goldman 1998; Gallese 2001; Rizzolatti et\nal. 1996). (For an overview of the different versions of simulation\ntheory that have been advocated see Barlassina and Gordon 2017.) \nOver the years theory-theory and simulation theory have moved closer\ntowards each other, giving rise to various hybrid accounts of how it\nis that we attribute minds to others. But there are those who\nchallenge both theories and any hybrid versions that they have\nspawned. One such challenge arises from Gallagher & Zahavi 2008\nwho urge that we cast aside both third-person (theory) and\nfirst-person (simulation) approaches, and concentrate instead on\nsecond-person interaction. (In its development in Gallagher’s\nwork, this approach has come to be known as “interaction\ntheory”.) Influenced by work in phenomenology and embodied\ncognition, Gallagher and Zahavi propose that our attribution of mental\nstates to others is the result of perception of and reaction to\nbehavior understood as expressive of mental life. Furthermore, they\nsuggest that the activation of mirror neurons be understood as serving\naction or response preparation (rather than as supporting simulation,\ncf.\n §3.1).\n Drawing on the work of developmental psychologists such as Meltzoff,\nTrevarthen, and Hobson, they identify two forms of intersubjectivity:\na primary form identifiable in early infancy that involves a\ndifferential response to persons and inanimate objects; and a\nsecondary form when the behavior of persons is interpreted “in\nterms of their goals and intentions set in contextualized\nsituations” (Gallagher & Zahavi 2008: 190). In addition to\nprimary and secondary intersubjectivity, and at the point when the\nchild has language, it is suggested that a more nuanced way of\nunderstanding others becomes possible through the development of\ncommunicative and narrative practices (Hutto 2008; Gallagher & Hutto 2008).\nGallagher and Zahavi reject inferential accounts of how we know others\nin favor of a direct perceptual one, and they understand behavior\n(e.g., gesture, facial expressions, contextualized actions) to be\nconstitutive of mental life. Importantly, they point out that one\nshouldn’t conceive of interpersonal understanding as if it was\nmerely and primarily a question of bridging the gap between two\nisolated subjects. Interpersonal understanding occurs in a context and\nthrough “our shared engagement in the common world”\n(Gallagher & Zahavi 2008: 190; cf. Gurwitsch 1977 [1979]). \nThis work aims to move us away from an overly-intellectualized way of\nthinking of other minds and to turn our attention to the world that we\nlive and act in with others. The emphasis here is less on individual\nbeliefs and desires than in shared intentions and goals. As Gallagher\nsays in one place, “social cognition is often nothing more\nthan…social interaction” (2008: 541).  \nInteraction theory can be seen as an extension of enactivist theories\nof perception that understand perception as a highly complex\naction-oriented phenomenon, incorporating both meaning and emotion: to\nsee an object is to see it as affording me opportunity for action, and\nthis opportunity is taken to be part of how I make sense of the world\nand what gives the world value for me (cf. Clarke, Noe, Varela et\nal). The extension of this idea allows that social interactions\nalso constitute for me “novel domains of possibilities for sense\nmaking” (De Jaegher 2009). To see the other person is to see her\nas affording interaction; in this regard, direct perception is direct\nenactive perception. Interactionist theorists have suggested concrete\nproposals for empirical work in psychology and neuroscience in the\nhopes of moving this research away from what they see as individualism\nand methodological solipsism (De Jaegher, DiPaulo, & Gallagher\n2010). Rather than taking individual agents to be constitutive of\nsocial interaction, these interaction theorists take them to be\nconstituted by their interaction with others. \nPerson model theory challenges theory-theory (TT) and simulation\ntheory (ST)—as well as interaction theory (IT; Newen 2015, Newen\n& Schlicht 2009). Person model theory finds certain limitations in\neach of the theories that it opposes. In the place of the two forms of\nintersubjectivity recommended by Gallagher and Zahavi, person theory\nsuggests that the infant works with a “non-conceptual\nperson-schema” which develops—through the combined work of\nobservation and narrative—into “conceptualized\nperson-images”. Thus, it is proposed that the understanding of\npersons is a step-by-step process of enrichment, central to which is\nthe acceptance of a multiplicity of strategies (TT, ST, and IT among\nthem). Which strategy is deployed is dependent upon such things as\ncontext, how similar or different the other is from oneself, whether\nthe understanding is of an emotion or a propositional attitude, and\nthe complexity of the mental state. The idea of the deployment of a\nmultiplicity of strategies is not unique to Person Theory. Gallagher\nand Fiebich (forthcoming) argue for what they call a “pluralist\napproach” to the understanding of others, drawing on inference,\nsimulation, direct perception, and/or interaction—depending on\nthe situation (cf. Nichols & Stich 2003). What this work\nhighlights is how much may be involved when it comes to understanding\nothers. \nAs so much of the debate concerning others in the heyday of its\ndiscussion in analytic philosophy in the twentieth century can be read\nas a reaction to Mill’s formulation of the argument from\nanalogy, it is instructive to consider the context for Mill’s\nwork\n here.[16]\n In proposing his argument, Mill was responding to a challenge laid\ndown by the eighteenth century philosopher Thomas Reid who argued that\nDescartes’ philosophy, when traced through the work of\nphilosophers such as Malebranche, Locke, Hume and Berkeley, leads to\nsolipsism. In order to avoid this conclusion, Reid argued that\nphilosophers must jettison the Cartesian framework of ideas and its\ntrust in reason over the deliverances of sense. According to Reid, the\nfaculties of reason and perception should be regarded as being on an\nequal footing. Rather than insist that all human belief is regulated\nby reason, Reid holds that we should allow that our perceptions of the\nworld are guided by principles for which no proof can be offered.\nAmongst the regulative principles Reid identifies there are two\nconcerning others: (i) there is life and intelligence in our fellow\nmen; and (ii) certain features of the countenance, sounds of the voice\nand gestures of the body indicate certain thoughts and dispositions of\nmind (Reid 1785). Mill’s work is designed as a defense of the\nCartesian framework in response to Reid’s claim that it leads\ninexorably to solipsism. According to Mill, all truths are known in\none of two ways: either directly, through the authority of\nconsciousness, or indirectly, by inference from truths known directly.\nMill believes that knowledge arrived indirectly in this way is\nsufficient to avoid the concern of solipsism. \nWhile there is little direct discussion of this question in\nDescartes’ work, one can find passages devoted to it in\npost-Cartesian philosophy. Malebranche, for example, differentiates\nknowledge of one’s own mind, of bodies, and of other men’s\nmind: the first is through consciousness, the second through ideas,\nand the third through conjecture (1674–5 [1980: 239]). In the\ncase of another man’s sensations, Malebranche first considers\nthe possibility that everyone has the same sensations when confronted\nwith the same objects, but then notes that it can happen that\n“the internal fibers of the optic nerve do not produce the same\nsensation for different people” (Ibid, 66). Despite\nthis possibility, Malebranche thinks there is reason to believe that\nGod arranged things so that the same physical conditions do produce\nthe same sensations (i.e., that nature is uniform). Nonetheless, he\nargues that we cannot know another’s sensations as there is\n“a great deal of diversity in different people’s organs of\nsight as well as of hearing and taste” (ibid). Writing\nin response to Malebranche, Arnauld (1683) insists that we do know\nother men’s minds through ideas: we have ideas of their bodies\nand must reason from these to the conclusion that they have minds. In\nArnauld’s work we have, arguably, an early formulation of the\nargument from analogy. \nThe threat of solipsism is a very particular one for the idealism of\nGeorge Berkeley. Without proof of other minds, idealism will amount to\nnothing but solipsism. Berkeley admits that I cannot have immediate\nevidence of the mind of another; what he holds is that there is\n“a certain collection of ideas, as directs us to think there is\na distinct principle of thought and motion like until ourselves,\naccompanying and represented by it” (Berkeley 1710: Principle\n148). While some find in Berkeley’s work another early\nformulation of the argument from analogy (Urmson 1982), others argue\nthat his work should be read as putting forwards a causal argument: in\nthe case of God, I reason that He is the cause or Author of everything\nin nature that I see around me; in the case of other finite spirits, I\nreason that they are the cause of the movements in the bodies I\nobserve and the words that I hear (Bennett 1971 and Falkenstein 1990). \nSome philosophers find an argument from analogy also in the work of\nDavid Hume, while others interpret his work in a more naturalistic\nvein. One thing that cannot be denied is that Hume introduces an\nimportant element into the discussion of others when he writes in\nThe Treatise, “No quality of human nature is more\nremarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than that\npropensity we have to sympathize with others” (1738–40\n[1888: 316]). It is by means of sympathy that we are affected by the\npassions and mental states of others, which otherwise “remain\nconcealed in the minds of others” (ibid, 593).\nPrecisely how this remarkable capacity operates is a matter of some\ndebate. There are those who agree with Reid and find Hume unable to\nescape the confines of his own mind. These philosophers argue that\nHume recognizes the problem of other minds that arises for the\nCartesian framework that he endorses, and holds that sympathy can do\nno more than get us to feel our own feelings in response to what we\nobserve in the other. But there are others who take Hume to turn his\nback on scepticism and the very business of providing reasons for the\nbelief that others have thoughts and feelings. They read Hume’s\nwork as giving us a psychological account of how it is that we are\nable to understand the thoughts and feelings of our fellow men through\nthe operation of sympathy (Greco 2012; see also Waldow 2009). \nHume’s understanding of the working of sympathy was challenged\nby his contemporary Adam Smith. Smith rejects the idea that I can feel\nwhat another feels. He writes,  \nThough our brother is upon the rack, as long as we ourselves are at\nour ease, our senses will never inform us of what he suffers. They\nnever did, and never can, carry us beyond our own person, and it is by\nthe imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his\nsensations….  \nA little later he writes,  \nThat this is the source of our fellow-feeling for the misery of others, that it is by changing places in fancy with the sufferer, that we come either to conceive or to be affected by what he feels, may be demonstrated by many obvious observations, if it should not be thought sufficiently evident of itself. (1759:\nI.i.i.2–3)  \nWith Smith’s work we take a step closer to the work of the\nsimulation theorists of more recent times (cf.\n §3.1). \nIt is Reid’s contention that, so long as one is working within a\nCartesian framework of ideas, our relations to others must be a taken\nto be a matter of probability, hypothesis, or conjecture, and this he\ntakes to be at odds with the conviction with which, for example, the\nchild interacts with her nurse. While the Cartesian recognizes only\nthe solitary operations of mind, Reid proposes that we also recognize\nthe social operations of mind (Reid 1785 [1969: 71]). \nThere has been an inclination in philosophy to find a difficulty\naccounting for our relations to others to have its roots in the\nwritings of Descartes. If there is some truth to this accusation, one\nmay expect to find the ‘problem of other minds’ less\npressing in the work of pre-Cartesian philosophy. With the possible\nexception of Augustine (whose work is taken by some to be a pre-cursor\nto Descartes’), this is arguably the case. \nWhile philosophers in ancient Greece raise sceptical questions\nconcerning others, it is has been suggested that the problems they\nraise tend to be ‘thin’ rather than ‘thick’\nones (see\n §1\n and Avramides 2001). Plato and Aristotle, for example, discuss the\nvalue of friendship, but do not ask why we should think others exist\nto be friends. Sorabji claims that “it never occurs to Aristotle\nto raise doubts about other minds” (1974: 88). According to\nSextus Empiricus, sceptics of the Cyrenaic school raise problems about\nthe minds of others, but it is not clear that the problem they raise\ngoes beyond the ‘thin’ one, How can I know what\nanother thinks and feels? (Tsouna\n 1998a).[17] \nWhile philosophers in the West trace their lineage back to ancient\nGreece, it is worth remembering that philosophical ideas were also\nbeing discussed elsewhere in the world. One tradition that has a long\nhistory of concern with issues to do with the minds of others is the\nIndian Buddhist tradition. While one should not read texts from other\nphilosophical traditions only to find parallels with one’s own,\nit is striking that these early Buddhist philosophers may be thought\nto have grappled with many of the same issues concerning others as\nhave philosophers in the Western tradition. It is possible to find\ndiscussion of both epistemological and conceptual problems in\nconnection with others in Buddhist texts. There are two important\nworks in this tradition devoted to questions concerning others, one by\nDharmakīrti in the seventh century and another by Ratnakirti in\nthe 11th. Indeed, Sharma (1985) writes that\n“Dharmakīrti is perhaps the first ever thinker to make a\nsystematic attempt to come to grips with this problem [of other\nminds]”. Dharmakīrti is an idealist who denies the reality\nof the external world and whose work, therefore, is open to the charge\nof solipsism. In his Proof of the Existence of Other Streams of\nConsciousness, Dharmakīrti first points out that the mind of\nanother is imperceptible; he then goes on to argue that other minds\nare inferred from observed speech and action. Dharmakīrti is\ncareful to acknowledge that there are limits to our understanding of\nothers (we cannot know what it is like for them) (Inami 2001). Ganeri\n(2012) suggests that what we find in Dharmakīrti’s text is\n“a sort of argument from analogy” for the existence of\nothers. Responding to Dharmakīrti here, Ratnakirti points out the\ndifficulties in reasoning to the mind of another that one can never be\nin a position to verify. In effect, Ratnakirti argues that other minds\ncannot be taken to exist, and solipsism must be accepted. However,\nRatnakirti is careful to draw a distinction between conventional and\nultimate existence—while other minds do not exist ultimately,\nthey do exist conventionally. It is this conventional existence that\nexplains our actions with regards to others. According to Ganeri, we\ncan also find in Ratnakirti’s work arguments to show that it is\nnot possible even to form a conception of another mind (2012: 203).\nThis problem is particularly pressing for the Buddhist philosopher\nfor, as Ganeri reminds us (2012: 202), without a conception of others\nit is a question how can one cultivate compassion.","contact.mail":"anita.avramides@philosophy.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"philosophy.ox.ac.uk"}]
