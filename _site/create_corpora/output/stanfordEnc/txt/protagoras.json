His teaching had a practical and concrete goal,\nand many of the surviving testimonies and fragments suggest that it\nwas mainly devoted to the development of argumentative techniques. But\nsome of his views also raise important philosophical problems, which\nwere going to be discussed in details by Plato, Aristotle, and many\nother philosophers. His famous thesis according to which “man is\nthe measure of all things” has been interpreted as a first\nstance in favour of relativism, and his claim on the gods introduces\nthe problem of agnosticism. Besides, his conventionalist notion of\njustice marks a break with the traditional account of divine justice;\nas it has been rightly claimed, it also seems to provide a theoretical\nfoundation for democracy based on direct participation. By claiming a\ndirect link with the great poets and thinkers of the past but also by\nappropriating and transforming their tenets, Protagoras presented\nhimself as an heir to Greek paideia, as one of the great\nmasters, or better, as the educator capable of imparting teachings\nsuited to the needs of the new world of the polis.\n\nWe do not know much about Protagoras’ life, and even less about\nhis death: as the most famous sophist, he became the object of many,\noften unreliable, anecdotes. He was born in Abdera in Thrace, in the\nnorth cost of the Aegean Sea. In Plato’s Protagoras\n(317c) he says that he is old enough to be the father of anyone\npresent, including Hippias and Prodicus. This confirms that he was one\nof the earliest sophists and suggests the 490s BCE as his birth year.\nAccording to an anecdote in Diogenes Laertius (IX.53) he was a porter\nuntil Democritus taught him. Democritus was also from Abdera, but was\nyounger by about thirty years and criticised Protagoras’ thesis\nof the “Man measure” (see below) on the charge of being\nself-refuting. It is therefore highly improbable that Protagoras was\none of his pupils. The anecdote, probably derived from some comic\npoets (such as Eupolis or Hermippus) due to possible connections\nbetween their epistemological theories, also served to point to\nProtagoras’ humble origins; an alternative testimony from\nPhilostratus (Lives of the Sophist I.10.1–2) about his\nfamily hosting Xerxes at the time of the Persian wars goes in the\nopposite direction. This testimony also reports that Xerxes granted\nProtagoras’ family the rare privilege of having their son\nProtagoras educated by the Magi (this anecdote was also used to\nexplain his agnosticism, as if it was impossible for a Greek to\nendorse similar ideas, see below). Even if we regard this story as\nspurious, it still seems to confirm the contacts between Protagoras\nand the culture of the Ionian colonies and of the Near East. As Plato\nrepeatedly reports, he later travelled around Greece as a teacher and\na “sophist” (most importantly, again according to Plato,\nhe was the first to explicitly present himself as such,\nProtagoras 316c–317b), earning great fame and amassing\nconsiderable riches. It is equally certain that Protagoras sojourned\nat least twice in Athens in Pericles’ time, establishing with\nhim personal ties. It is more difficult to tell whether these contacts\nalso led to a direct involvement in the democratic politics of the\ngreat statesman. Evidence in this direction is apparently provided not\njust by some of the sophist’s surviving fragments, but also by\nthe fact that in 444 BCE, Pericles entrusted him with drafting the\nconstitution of the new pan-Hellenic colony of Thurii in South Italy\n(clearly, an appointment of this sort implies that the two men shared\nthe same political outlook). This connection with Pericles can also be\nconfirmed by the upheavals that marked the last years of\nProtagoras’ life: the crisis of Periclean politics seems to find\na counterpart in the downfall of Protagoras, who—like other\npersonalities close to the statesman—was put on trial. By the\nsame account, the sophist died in a shipwreck during his flight.\nHowever, this is very questionable. First, that he had a trial seems\nto be confirmed also by other sources; but these sources (in\nparticular Aristotle, see Diogenes Laertius IX.54) do not seem to\nrelate the trial to political issues (Diogenes actually relates the\ntrial to the charge of impiety, which would justify the story about\nthe shipwreck as divine punishment); at stake was rather a controversy\nwith a pupil. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that the trial with the\nstudent was also a fiction. Second, the story of the trial and flight\nfrom Athens differs from what Plato writes in his dialogues, where he\nspeaks of Protagoras as though he had died as a universally esteemed\nfigure in old age. From Plato we know that Protagoras lived\napproximately 70 years (Meno 91e; other sources state 90\nyears), which would place his death at around 420 BCE. Protagoras'\npupils include Antimoerus of Mende, Carmidas and Euathlus of Athens,\nand Theodore of Cyrene. Protagoras’ influence has also been\nposited in relation to Prodicus and the Dissoi Logoi,\nalthough it is difficult to measure its extent. \nDiogenes Laertius (IX 55 = 80A1 DK) attributes many works to\nProtagoras, but a comparison with other sources reveals that his list\nis incomplete. Still worse, what is missing from Diogenes’ list\nare precisely the most important and controversial works, such as\nTruth and On the Gods. One possible explanation is\nthat these two texts constituted individual sections of the\nAntilogiae (Opposing Arguments, mentioned by\nDiogenes), which were possibly known also as Kataballontes\nlogoi (The Overthrower Arguments or, better, The\nKnockdown Arguments; in M VII 60 Sextus Empiricus\nattributes to this text the “Man measure” sentence, which\nother sources refer to Truth; see Decleva Caizzi 1999: 317;\nLee 2005: 24–29). Intriguing as it is, the hypothesis is\ndifficult to prove. The title suggests that the Antilogiai\nwere structured upon some sort of oppositions (an interesting parallel\nare the Dissoi logoi); but there is no indication of\noppositions in the surviving fragments from Truth and On\nthe Gods. Again, any attempt at reconstruction is destined to\nremain speculative, given the dearth of available fragments. Other\ntitles such as The Art of Eristic, On Wrestling,\nOn Sciences, On Love of Honours, On the\nConstitution show the breadth of Protagoras’ interests. \nApart from these titles, unfortunately, all we have are a few (less\nthan ten in Diels-Kranz’s edition) authentic fragments and many\ninterpretations. Ever since Antiquity, his provocative theses have\nelicited interest and criticism from his readers. As a result,\ndifferent reconstructions of his thought are available, which are not\nalways reliable and are often clearly shaped by disparaging\nintentions. The first and most important tradition stretches back to\nPlato, who devoted two dialogues to the theses of the sophist of\nAbdera, the Protagoras and the Theaetetus. Many of\nthe later testimonies, starting with Aristotle’s, would appear\nto depend on Plato’s discussions, and this must be taken into\naccount when examining the information from our sources. Alongside the\nPlatonic, another tradition proved rather influential in Antiquity,\nnamely the one that highlighted the sceptical implications of\nProtagoras’ thought (the most interesting testimony, not in DK,\ncomes from the Commentary on the Psalms by Didymus the Blind,\nsee PToura V 222.18-29; this testimony, absent in DK, can be read in\nthe recent edition by Laks and Most 2016, vol. VIII.1, 109–111).\nHowever, little is known about this interpretation because sceptics\nsuch as Sextus Empiricus explicitly refused to be associated with\nProtagoras, whom they regarded as a dogmatist. This kind of reading\ncertainly served polemical purposes. Another tradition that was\nhostile to Protagoras, and which was possibly connected to the\nsceptical interpretation, was the Epicurean one, which is responsible\nfor the emphasis on the link between Protagoras and Democritus, on the\nground of their epistemologies—in all likelihood, an unfounded\nidea. All in all, we must note that many—if not all—the\ntestimonies we have about Protagoras are vitiated by underlying\npolemical attitudes of some sort, which in some cases lead to actual\ndistortions of his thought. \nIn Plato’s Protagoras Protagoras claims that he teaches\neuboulia, good deliberation:  \nThe object of my instruction is good deliberation about household\nmatters, to know how to manage one’s own household in the best\nway possible, and about those of the city, so as to be most capable of\nacting and speaking in the city’s interest. (318e–319a = 80A5\nDK)  \nProtagoras’ teaching had a practical and concrete goal, and many\nof the surviving testimonies and fragments suggest that it was mainly\ndevoted to the development of argumentative techniques (which were\nprobably investigated in texts such as the already mentioned\nAntilogiai and The Art of Eristics). Unfortunately,\nwe have little evidence of what these actually were. In all\nprobability, assertions such as that on every matter there are two\nlogoi opposed to one another (80A1, B6a DK) or that it is\nimpossible to contradict (80A19 DK), along with the claim to make the\nweaker logos (the) stronger (80B6b DK), belong to this\ncontext. Part of his teaching was also devoted to grammatical or\nlinguistic issues and poetry analysis. More in general, it is also\nunclear the relation between his teachings and the apparent relativism\nof his famous thesis that the man is the measure of all things.\nAncient sources report that this sentence opened Truth, a\npublic declamation (epideixis) with which he presented\nhimself to the public to potential pupils. \nTruth is one of Protagoras’ most famous books. Ancient\nbooks were not necessarily given their titles by their authors; but\nPlato and Aristotle continuously refer to Protagoras’ text as\nAletheia and also make puns, confirming that Protagoras\nhimself gave this title. The notion of “truth” played a\nprominent role among the Presocratics: in choosing this title,\nProtagoras clearly wanted to present himself as an heir to this\nlong-established tradition; and by questioning the existence of one\nsingle truth, as we will see, he sought to challenge it. The first\nsentence of the treatise fully confirms its author’s provocative\nintentions: “Of all things the measure is man: of those that\nare, that they are; and of those that are not, that they are\nnot” (80B1 DK; for the sake of convenience, this sentence will\nbe abbreviated as MM). MM is one of the few authentic Protagoras\nfragments to have been preserved and many ancient sources confirm that\nthe statement was originally formulated precisely in these terms. The\nproblem, however, is its opacity: ancient readers debated what\nProtagoras really meant, and modern interpretations have only\nincreased doubt. As a matter of fact, it cannot be ruled out that a\ncertain degree of ambiguity was intentional. Truth was not a\nscientific treatise but an epideixis, the text of public\nperformance, which was meant “to demonstrate one’s\nvirtuoso skill in argumentation” (Lee 2005: 27, after Lloyd\n1987: 96). In opening his speech, Protagoras sought to capture the\nattention of his audience (or reader) by making a striking and\nallusive claim. There is nothing odd in all of this, since a desire to\ncapture the audience’s attention was quite typical of the\nsophists, and is confirmed by many other sources (the sentence\nintroducing the treatise on the gods was just as provocative, see\n §4). \nThis is not to say that MM had no specific meaning. Simply, it is a\nmatter of dealing with potentially ambiguous elements. In particular,\nit is necessary to clarify the notion of man, i.e., whether\n“man” refers to each individual or to humanity in general:\nin discussing this issue, the meaning of the other terms that make up\nthe sentence will also become clearer. In turn, this will help us\nassess the underlying meaning of Protagoras’ thesis and its\nfield of applicability, so as to determine whether it is only an\nepistemological thesis or whether it also carries practical or\npolitical implications. As it will turn out, the sentence can be read\non different levels, in accordance with the archaic logic which says\nthere is no need to clearly distinguish the different meanings\npossessed by a term. \nThere are three main sources for MM: Plato, our most important source,\nAristotle, and Sextus Empiricus. All three understand the\nphrase—at any rate at a first level—as though\n“man” referred to “each individual”. In the\nTheaetetus MM is equated with the claim that “knowledge\nis sensation” and paraphrased as follows: “just as each\nthing appears to me, so too it is for me, and just as it appears to\nyou, so too again for you” (Theaetetus 152a). Thus, if\nthe wind appears warm to me, it is warm for me; and if it appears cold\nto another person, it is cold for her. In other words, MM means that\neach person is the measure of her own sensations, and Protagoras\nemerges as a supporter of an empiricist theory that bases knowledge on\nsensory data. \nPlato’s testimony is crucial and his reconstruction is also\ntaken up by other authors (see 80A16 DK and 80B1 DK). It is, however,\na reductive interpretation that potentially misleads. The underlying\naim of Theaetetus is not to accurately report the theses of\nPlato’s opponent, but to show their philosophical limits:\naccording to Plato, the MM thesis is a muddled one; the only way to\nmake it clear is by assuming that Protagoras was only speaking of\nsensations; and since (according to Plato) it is impossible to base\nknowledge on sensations alone, it follows that the thesis is\nfallacious. This strict empiricist reading is philosophically\ninteresting but not historically reliable, because Protagoras was not\nspeaking of sensations alone. Remarkably, Plato himself suggests that\nProtagoras’ phrase had a broader meaning by remarking that MM\nalso concerned all opinions and judgements (157d, 170a–171a).\nAristotle and Sextus Empiricus further confirm the need for a broader\ninterpretation: what are at play are not just sensations but more\ngenerally all opinions and judgements (and especially value\njudgements). On this interpretation, MM means that each individual is\nthe ultimate arbiter of all her own judgements—not only that the\nwind is warm or cold, but also that performing a given action is right\nor\n wrong.[1] \nThe point just made is crucial for a correct reconstruction of the\noverall meaning of Protagoras’ position. The transition to a\nbroader conception of human activities (not only sense-perceptions but\nhuman judgements as a whole) brings out one aspect of the thesis that\nscholars have all too often overlooked. From the example of wind it\nseems that Protagoras was addressing the problem of human knowledge in\nabstract terms, by examining the general ways in which the process of\nknowledge-acquisition unfolds—in other words, by investigating\nwhat happens to a subject X who at a given moment t\nexperiences sensation f (let us think of the example of the\nwind). This is not correct. It is certainly true that\nProtagoras’ thesis was concerned with human knowledge. However,\nit is not true that it focused on it in an “abstract” way,\nas though men could be stimulated from the outside so as to study\ntheir reactions at given moments and in specific circumstances. This\napproach might work in the case of the wind, but not in that of\njudgements concerning what is good or bad. “Man” refers to\nthe individual, yet not to a generic, impersonal, subject: Protagoras\nhas concrete, historically well-defined people in mind, with their\nideas and prejudices. What is meant by “man”, therefore,\nis each person with his or her own personal history, experiences, and\nexpectations with a past and a future, i.e., people whose judgements\nlargely reflect their individual experience. When I claim that a\ncertain thing or action is good (or beautiful or unjust), I do so on\nthe basis of a series of ideas and opinions that I have acquired over\nthe course of my life and that I have continued to put to test through\nmy engagement with facts—in other words, on the basis of my\nexperience, which is different from that of other people. The true\nmeasure, then, is not man in the abstract sense but rather each\nindividual’s experience (Mansfeld 1981: 44–46). Clearly\nthis claim also carries a polemical undertone with respect to the\nso-called “masters of truth”, that is, philosophers like\nParmenides (see also 80B2 DK), for whom terms such as\n“man” and “opinion” were synonymous with\nerror, and the poets who claimed to be divinely inspired. There is no\nprivileged access to any divine or higher reality. The ultimate\npurpose of Protagoras’ statement is to re-evaluate human\nexperiences. \nHaving clarified the meaning of “man”, we can now turn to\nconsider the second part of the phrase, “of those that are, that\nthey are; and of those that are not, that they are not”.\nEssentially, it is a matter of clarifying what “things”\nmeans and in what sense man “measures” them. Based on what\nhas been noted so far, we can reasonably claim that what Protagoras\nmeant by “things” was not just material objects and\nentities with their specific properties (things that can be perceived\nby the senses, such as wind): “things” are to be\nunderstood in their broadest possible sense as facts or\nevents—e.g., the temperature of the wind, but also an event such\nas performing a certain action and all that happens to man. In this\nrespect, the choice of the term is probably revealing. Chrema\nderives from the verb chraomai, meaning “to\ntreat”, “to use”, “to entertain a relation\nwith”: according to its original meaning, the term describes not\nso much “things” in themselves (in this case Protagoras\ncould have used onta or pragmata), as in relation to\nus; the emphasis is on the way in which we relate to things, use them,\njudge them, and so on. As far as the notion of measure is concerned,\nit is clear that man is the measure not of the existence of these\nthings and facts, but rather of the way in which they present\nthemselves (e.g., warm/cold or good/bad). The verb “is”\nmust be understood not in an existential sense (in which case it would\nbe difficult to understand what it means for man to be the measure of\nthe non-existence of the things that are not), but rather in a\nmodal-predicative sense: Protagoras is not denying the existence of\nthe external world, but only limiting the possibility of knowing it to\nthe way in which it presents itself to our experience: hence, if I\njudge the wind to be warm, I am the measure of the fact that it is\nwarm and not of the fact that it exists; and if I judge the wind not\nto be warm, I am measure of the fact that it is not warm and not of\nthe fact that it does not exist (but this does not exclude some\nspecific cases where I can also be the measure of existence or lack\nthere of, for instance the Gods: interestingly, the opening sentence\nof fr. 4 on the Gods appears to have existential implications, see\nbelow\n §4).\n Things in themselves do not possess any predetermined truth or any\nintrinsic value: they simply exist, they are what surrounds man, what\nhappens to him. But what matters is the way in which we relate to\nthem: each individual, according to his or her experience, is the\njudge of these facts, insofar as he or she assigns them a degree of\nconsistency or value. \nMM faces two serious objections: the charge that it is self-refuting\nand the charge of solipsism. The charge of being self-refuting (or\nperitrope, as the ancients called it: literally, the charge\nof turning oneself upside down) was apparently formulated for the\nfirst time by Democritus (80A15 DK) and then further developed by\nPlato (in Theaetetus and Euthydemus) and Aristotle\n(in the fourth book of Metaphysics). In brief, this\naccusation states that if all judgements are true (this being the\nimplicit meaning of MM), then the judgement that MM is false is also\ntrue; hence, MM is false. Protagoras had reportedly further claimed\nthat “it is not possible to contradict” (80A19 DK) and\nthis had led Plato and especially Aristotle (Met. IV 5,\n1009a6–16) to add that the sophist denied the principle of\nnon-contradiction, suggesting another version of the\nperitrope charge: Protagoras claims that all judgements are\ntrue (let us call this thesis P) and his opponent that\nProtagoras’ claim is false (non-P); but according to Protagoras\ncontradiction is impossible and therefore non-P is compatible with P;\nbut in this case, non-P is true; hence, P is false (Barnes 1979:\n548). \nThe soundness of this criticism has been the object of a heated\nscholarly debate, yet no shared solution has been reached (see now\nCastagnoli 2010). An infallibilist interpretation, according to which\nall beliefs are true simpliciter (see Theaetetus\n161d6-7, 167a7-8; Aristotle, Metaphysics IV 5, 1009a7-8),\nclearly leads to Protagoras’ confutation for the above reasons.\nBut Protagoras could nonetheless defend himself by endorsing some kind\nof relativism, according to which nothing is true\nsimpliciter, but always relative to some framework. As a\nmatter of fact, the criticism omits the qualifiers “for\nme” and “for you”, which are crucial to his thesis\n(Theaetetus 161d2-3; Aristotle, Met. IV 6,\n1011a19-20; Sextus Empiricus, M VII 60). By introducing these\nqualifiers, Protagoras could reformulate the peritrope charge\nin such a way as to neutralise it: if what I judge is true and I judge\nthat Protagoras’ thesis is false, it does not follow from this\nthat Protagoras’ thesis is false in an absolute sense, but only\nthat it is false “for me”. And the fact that it is false\n“for me” does not prevent it from being true for other\npeople: it remains true, for instance, for Protagoras, who can thus\navoid the charge that he is turning himself upside down (as well as\ndenying the principle of non-contradiction; it may be argued however\nthat this latter principle is denied when Protagoras’ adversary\njudges that Protagoras’ thesis is false: in this case she would\nbe relying on Protagoras’ thesis and at the same time denying\nit). \nThis defensive strategy, however, is potentially open to the more\nserious charge of solipsism. This risk is clearly present in the\naforementioned thesis that it is “impossible to\ncontradict” (80A19 DK). The thesis in question is fully\ncompatible with MM. If each individual is the measure of his or her\nown world of sensations and judgements, contradiction can only be\napparent: each individual entertains a relationship with things whose\ntruth-reality cannot be contradicted or disputed by others. But how\ncan we deal with these divergences and oppositions if everyone is\nright? If this is how things stand, what follows is a radical (and\nintolerable) form or solipsism, whereby the fact that each person is\nhis or her own judge makes it impossible to discuss things with others\n(and, in addition, makes also Protagoras’ teaching useless). The\nprice that Protagoras must pay in order to defend the consistency of\nhis doctrines seems far too high (Woodruff 1999: 303). \nIn this case too Protagoras has some arguments on his side. Up until\nthis point, the discussion has centred on the problem of\n“truth”, a concept the importance of which can hardly be\ndisputed. However, no matter how central it may be, truth is not the\nonly criterion that governs human thoughts and actions. Alongside\ntruth there are other, equally important criteria, as the sophist\nargues in the so-called “Protagoras’ Apology”\n(166a–168c = 80A21a DK; the Theaetetus takes place in 399 BCE,\nthe year of Socrates’ trial, by which time Protagoras had\nalready passed away; this is the answer Protagoras would have given to\nSocrates, had he been present at the dialogue: it is not a fragment\nbut it probably conveys some of his views). In his fictional reply,\nProtagoras distinguishes between knowledge and wisdom\n(sophia). Unlike knowledge and truth, wisdom varies. From the\npoint of view of knowledge and truth, every individual is a measure,\nand the fact that each person is a measure depends on his relationship\nwith reality he or she is experiencing—this is a fact. But from\nthe point of view of the value of the contents (of wisdom), it cannot\nbe ruled out that some people are capable of allowing the individual\nto establish a more expedient relationship with reality.  \nAs for wisdom (sophia) and the wise man (sophos), I\nam very far from saying that they do not exist; but I also call the\nman clever who, by transforming things makes them appear to be good\nand be good for someone to whom they appeared to be bad and were bad.\n(Theaetetus 166d = 80A21a DK)  \nProtagoras’ aim is not merely to abolish the idea of truth which\nis shattered into an endless number of private truths; his aim is to\nreplace this criterion with another, more effective criterion, that of\nthe useful. It is by reflecting on the issue of the useful that the\nsophist, while respecting everybody’s opinion, shows his wisdom.\nThe useful varies from one situation to the next, and the problem is\nto identify what is truly expedient in each case. \nAll in all, it is difficult to articulate a comprehensive and\nconsistent interpretation of MM. The testimonies are scarce, and they\nbasically depend on Plato, who, though considering Protagoras a worthy\ninterlocutor, is not so much interested in presenting his thought as\nto criticise it. Whereas in the first part of the dialogue Protagoras\nis presented as endorsing some sort of relativism, in the\n“Apology” the emphasis is on some kind of pluralism, which\nis further confirmed by a passage from Protagoras, where it\nis argued that the variety of the useful does not so much depend on\nwhat one subjectively believes to be good or bad as on the fact that\nreality is manifold (Guthrie 1971: 164–175; Apfel 2011). The\nproblem of relativism has stimulated a huge discussion among modern\nscholars (after the seminal Burnyeat 1976); but it has been correctly\nquestioned that the strict adoption of this category can really\ncontribute to a better understanding of the sophist (Bett 1989). A\npluralist interpretation, on the contrary, enables us to underline the\npractical dimension of Protagoras’ teaching which was certainly\nimportant, and explains how MM can be combined with his activity of\nteacher. As already remarked, MM was the opening sentence of an\nepideixis: on the one side, it challenged traditional wisdom\nand epistemic authority by revaluating personal opinions and\nexperiences; on the other side it also argued for the importance of\npractical and concrete expertise. Indeed, it was an excellent\npresentation and advertisement for his activity. \nSeveral testimonies report Protagoras’ interest on\nmorphological, syntactic, and stylistic issues. Apparently, he was the\nfirst to distinguish the gender of nouns (male, female, and neuter)\nwhile also proposing many corrections for names in use in his day.\nThus he suggested that the female nouns menis\n(μῆνις, “wrath”, “frenzy”)\nand pelex (πήληξ,\n“helmet”), two terms familiar to Homer’s audience,\nshould be regarded as masculine—either on the basis of\nmorphological criteria (because names ending in sigma [ς] or xi\n[ξ] are usually masculine) or because of their meaning (insofar as\nwar is an eminently masculine pursuit: see 80A27-8 DK). Protagoras\nalso distinguished four verbal modes (indicative, conjunctive,\noptative, and imperative), which he linked to four types of speech\n(prayer, question, reply, and command), once again taking the occasion\nto mention Homer, who had addressed the goddess with a command\n(“Sing, Goddess, the wrath”) rather than a prayer (80A29\nDK). Finally, Diogenes Laertius (IX 52 = 80A1 DK) seems to inform us\nof Protagoras’ interest in verb tenses (but this is more\ncontroversial). All in all, these grammatical reflections presuppose a\n“rudimentary” (Rademaker 2013: 86) theory of language,\nwhich is not limited to names but is rather investigated from the\npoint of view of its underlying structure and connections in relation\nto the different functions of terms. \nThis interest on language did not depend on exclusively erudite or\ngrammatical interests, as though Protagoras simply sought to codify or\nstandardise the linguistic usages of the Greek world. On the contrary,\npractical and philosophical interests were in play. On the one hand,\nit was a matter of increasing the potential of words in view of the\npractical aim of teaching pupils to exploit language to further their\ngoals: it is by mastering a language that one can use it more\neffectively. This is what happens in the Clouds; as Aristophanes\nwas to note, these are the tools that help “make the weaker\nargument the stronger” (80B6b DK): in order to learn the\n“unjust argument” (Aristophanes’ version of\nProtagoras’ “weaker argument”), one must first learn\nthe rules of grammar (Clouds, 658–691 = 80C3 DK).\nBesides, criticism of Homer is also a way to challenge the\npoet’s authority. From the surviving testimonies it appears that\nan important part of Protagoras’ teaching was devoted to the\ninterpretation of poets such as Homer, Simonides (see Plato’s\nProtagoras 339a–e) and Hesiod (see below\n §5).\n Clearly, the purpose is not to provide a mere exegesis. Rather, it is\nto critically discuss the text and fulfil an educational goal:\nliterary criticism is a useful intellectual exercise which enables the\nindividual to grow familiar with and eventually criticise traditional\nvalues which were conveyed by the poets (Morgan 2000: 89–94).\nThe sophist’s strategy is one of appropriation, where an\nengagement with traditional knowledge represents the starting point of\ntheir attempt to acquire a dominant position in the Athenian cultural\nscene. In such a way, Protagoras could reinforce his claim to be a new\nteacher, an educator capable of imparting teachings suited to the\nneeds of the new world of the\n polis.[2] \nFrom a philosophical perspective of special importance is the\nrecurrent focus on the issue of correctness of names (orthotes\nonomaton, orthoepeia), which is to say the capacity of\nlanguage to faithfully portray reality. This was the object of many\ndiscussions in fifth-century BCE Athens; Plato’s\nPhaedrus reports that one of Protagoras’ works was\nentitled Orthoepeia (The Correctness of Language;\nPhdr. 267c = 80A26 DK). Regrettably, the content of this book\nis completely unknown; but different sources confirm that Protagoras\nhad an interest in the problem of correctness of language at different\nlevels (Gagarin 2008: 28–30). We already mentioned\nProtagoras’ grammatical interests, which implied the thesis of\nlinguistic correctness. On another level, the notion of\northos is used as a criterion for analysing poetry:\ncorrectness in this case concerns not points of grammar, but the\nconsistency of a composition, its statements, and its moral teaching\n(80A25 DK). Finally, the same notion could also be applied in an even\nmore general sense, as in the following testimony:  \nWhen a competitor in the pentathlon unintentionally struck Epitimus of\nPharsalus with a javelin and killed him, he [i.e., Pericles] spent a\nwhole day with Protagoras examining the difficulty whether, according\nto the most correct reasoning, it was the javelin, or the man who\nthrow it, or the umpires, that should be considered responsible for\nthis unfortunate event. (80A10 DK)  \nThis testimony is a fine example of Protagoras’ way of\nreasoning. The facts are indisputable: a man has unintentionally\nkilled another man. However, everything remains to be said as regards\nthe issues of moral responsibility, legal guilt, and how to judge the\nwhole incident. One and the same indisputable fact may be viewed from\nmany different perspectives: for the physician, the javelin will be\nresponsible for the man's death; for the umpire, it will be the\njavelin-thrower; for the person who has organised the competition, it\nwill be the umpire. This contrast gives the sophist some room for\naction: he will attempt to create some agreement, lending meaning and\norder to the event (Untersteiner 1949 [1954: 56–57]). The notion\nof correctness is the criterion which enables him to overcome the\nabove difficulties: given that there is some validity to all the above\npoints of view, the problem will be to find the one most suited to the\nsituation, while foregoing any claim to come up with a single,\nindependently valid in all cases, answer. No doubt, the notion of\n“correctness” finds a prominent place in Protagoras’\nthought and allows us to grasp some of its strands of continuity. At\nthe basis of this notion lies the awareness of the problematic\nrelationship between reality and human beings which was discussed in connection\nwith MM, and which finds another expression in the statement that\n“concerning every subject, there are two arguments opposed to\none another” (80B6a DK). With regard to each thing there are two\nopposite logoi (speeches, arguments, points of view)—A\nand non-A—precisely because each experience is open to\ncontrasting readings and interpretations (thus, in the case of the\nabove example, each of the three elements can be reduced to this\nbinary logic by arguing whether it has been or not the umpire, or the\njavelin, or the javelin-thrower). Logos, which expresses our\ncapacity to think and speak, thus cannot exhaust the complexity of\nreality. However, as already noted with regard to MM, contradictory\npoints of view do not imply confusion or the failure of human\npossibilities. Rather, the challenge that Protagoras takes up and the\npromise he makes is to be able to (and teach others to) unravel this\ncomplexity by identifying which of any two opposite logoi is\nthe better, or rather the more correct, which is to say the one better\nsuited to the circumstance at hand: this is probably the meaning of\nhis well-known claim to “to make the weaker argument the\nstronger” (80B6b DK). It is easy to discern the structural\nanalysis that links this notion of correctness to that of the type of\nusefulness we have discussed in relation to the MM fragment: in both\ncases the problem is to find the best, most expedient relationship\nwith things in each circumstance, and this can be obtained by using\ncorrectly our logos, both in the sense of judging correctly\nthe case and convincing the others. \nWe here get a better idea of Protagoras’ teaching, which centres\non the concept of logos, understood both as the ability to\nreason and the ability to express oneself (i.e., as both thought and\nlanguage). “Correctness”, in other words, is to be\nunderstood on two levels, a conceptual and a linguistic one: correct\nreasoning, which expresses the best possible solution, must find a\ncounterpart in formal correctness, which makes one’s speech\npersuasive and hence allows one to gain the upper hand in each\nparticular situation (Classen 1976: 222–225). The best speech,\ntherefore, is not the speech that is true but the speech that is correct, the speech best\nsuited to the situation at hand and most capable of outdoing others\nfrom a formal and logical perspective: an irrefutable logos\n(Brancacci 2002: 183–190). \nProtagoras’ penchant for sensational statements, capable of\nseizing the public’s attention, is further confirmed by the\nopening of the On the Gods:  \nAbout the gods I am able to know neither that they exist nor that they\ndo not exist nor of what kind they are in form: for many things\nprevent me for knowing this, its obscurity and the brevity of\nman’s life. (80B4 DK; on the text, see Benedetto 2001 and\nCorradi 2017: 445–448)  \nAccording to some ancient sources, this statement had a\ndisproportionate effect: his books were burned in public, while he was\nconvicted in Athens on a charge of atheism and sentenced to death; he\nthen escaped and lost his life in a shipwreck. As already remarked,\nall these anecdotes are probably fictitious, but it is true that the\nsophist was made the object of unanimous and enduring condemnation, to\nthe point of bringing together traditionally antithetical schools of\nthought, such as the Christians and the Epicureans, both concord in\ncondemning his thesis as atheistic (see Diogenes of Oenoanda, 80A23\nDK, and Epiphanius, Against Heresies III 16). As a matter of\nfact, there is no reason to assume a profession of atheism on his\npart, because these hostile sources conflate a confession of ignorance\n(“I do not know that P”) with a profession of\nknowledge (“I know that not-P”). “To the\nbeliever, agnostics may be as bad as atheists; but to the atheists\nagnostics are not much better than believers” (Barnes 1979:\n449–450). Protagoras is the first thinker to take an agnostic\nstance, which can hardly be understood as an expression of atheism; at\nstake, in the fragment, is not so much an ontological thesis (on the\nexistence of the gods) but an epistemological one (on our knowledge of\nthem; Drozdek 2005: 41). Like in the case of MM, also in this fragment\nthe emphasis seems to fall on the absence of a universal and\nincontrovertible truth. \nWhile it is evident that Protagoras’ statement is not a\nprofession of atheism, its overall meaning is less clear. Some\ninterpreters have denied that Protagoras is doubting the existence of\nthe gods in this passage on the ground of a parallel with the use of\nhos in this statement and in the MM: in the latter case, as\nwe have seen, the preposition clearly has a modal meaning; if we\nassume that it was used in the same sense in the former passage, we\nmust conclude that, according to this line of interpretation,\nProtagoras was chiefly interested in the way in which the gods are and\npresent themselves, rather than in their presumed existence or\nnon-existence. Protagoras would thus be claiming that we do not know\n“how” the gods are or are not, and the words that follow\n(“nor of what kind they are in form”) would have an almost\nepexegetic function (or would more concretely refer to the problem of\ntheir visible appearance: see Kerferd 1981a: 165–168). This\nwould imply, then, that Protagoras never raised any doubts as to the\nexistence of the gods (and a different translation of the first clause\nwould follow: “I am able to know neither how they exist nor how\nthey do not exist”). The merit of this reading is that it\nexplains the otherwise inappropriate order of the two clauses: since\nthe first statement argues for agnosticism, it makes no sense to\ndiscuss the problem of the gods’ form. Against it, however, it\nmust be noted that all the ancient sources, from Plato onwards (see\nTheaetetus, 162d), unanimously present Protagoras’\nthesis as though it concerned the existence of the gods. As there are\nno reasons to go against such a solid tradition, it is better to\ninterpret the text as discussing both the existence of the gods\n(“neither that they exist nor that they do not exist”) and\ntheir form (“nor of what kind they are in form”). As for\nthe order of the two clauses, the most reasonable explanation is that,\nlike in the MM fragment, these opening statements, whose primary aim\nwas to attract the attention of the audience, were not meant to be too\nrigorous. To be sure, to begin by professing one’s own ignorance\nis an unconventional choice. Incidentally, it is worth noting that the\nstatement possibly presents the first recorded use of the verb\n“to be” in an existential sense (Kahn 1973: 302). \nThe reasons which Protagoras reportedly adduced in support of his\nthesis—the obscurity of the problem and the brevity of human\nlife—have been regarded as too banal, or at any rate not\nparticularly relevant. However, they acquire greater significance when\nviewed in relation to a concept the importance of which has already\nbeen stressed in relation to the MM, namely personal experience: this\nis the only legitimate criterion to verify our knowledge (Mansfeld\n1981). Therefore it seems that also in this case by highlighting the\nlimits of human experience, Protagoras was engaging in a polemic with\nthose Presocratic thinkers, such as Parmenides and Heraclitus, who had\nrepeatedly claimed to be able to transcend the limits of human\nknowledge, as well as the poets, who had based their authority on a\nprivileged contact with the divine world. In this respect, some\ninteresting similarities are to be found between Protagoras and\nXenophanes of Elea (21B34 DK), who also reportedly criticised human\nclaims to know the truth about the gods (significantly, for Xenophanes\ntoo, obscurity is an obstacle to knowledge). The analogies with\nXenophanes become even more striking when we consider the second\nsegment of the first statement, concerning the presumed appearance of\nthe gods. In raising this problem, Protagoras was in all likelihood\nreferring to the anthropomorphic conception, which Xenophanes had\nalready repeatedly censured (see also Herodotus Histories II\n53,1; Sassi 2013). \nOne intriguing problem for scholars has been to reconstruct the\nfollow-up to this text. It is difficult to imagine that, after a\nstatement of this sort, Protagoras continued to speak at length about\nthe gods. The structure of the sentence (and in particular the\npresence of the particle men, which implies a contrasting\nde) suggests that the author shifted his attention onto man:\nfor the Greeks, the notions of god and man were mutually defining. It\nis likely, therefore, that in the continuation of the text, Protagoras\ndiscussed not the problem of the gods in itself, but rather the issue\nof what they represent for man, thereby inaugurating an\nanthropological and sociological approach that considers religion in\nterms of its function for human civilisation and society (Jaeger 1947:\n176). This hypothesis is no doubt more persuasive than the alternative\nhypothesis that the text was then devoted to a critique of religious\nbeliefs or, on the contrary, that the acknowledgement of human\nweakness was intended to pave the way to an expression of piety and\nreverence for the unknowable nature of the gods. What is less\nconvincing is the way in which this hypothesis has been developed.\nFrom Jaeger onwards, scholars have believed that, while leaving the\nproblem of the actual existence of the gods open, Protagoras\ncelebrated their importance for human civilisation in the sense that\nreligious beliefs and sentiments played a decisive role in the\ndevelopment of human civilisation. Given the silence of this fragment,\nthis hypothesis is based on the myth that Protagoras relates in the\ndialogue named after him, where mention is made of these beliefs. Yet\nwhat may be inferred from the myth is rather the very opposite (see\n §5,\n for a detailed analysis of this testimony). In the myth, Protagoras\nacknowledges the importance of belief in the gods as something\nspecifically and universally human; but the very moment he\nacknowledges the presence of the religious dimension, he de\nfacto limits its importance by implying that this belief (or\nfear) is not enough to provide a foundation for human society. What\nensures that men can live together in cities is rather politics.\nProtagoras’ agnosticism is therefore instrumental towards his\nradical humanism, which is also attested in the MM fragment and in the\nmyth of Prometheus. \nThe last important testimony on Protagoras comes from the first part\nof Plato’s Protagoras, where the sophist tells Socrates\nand the rest of the audience his own version of the myth of Prometheus\n(Protagoras 320c–322d = 80C1 DK). In the dialogue, this myth\nis meant to defend both the Athenian democratic practice of allowing\nevery citizen to express his own ideas in public contexts and\nProtagoras’ claim to teach the “political art”. The\nmyth is told in three phases:  \nwhen they gathered together, they committed injustice against one\nanother…so that they scattered once again and were destroyed.\n(322b).  \nAs Protagoras will make clear in the rest of his speech (322d–328d)\nthe possession of these two virtues, which is clearly one major topic\nof the sophist’s political teaching, constitutes the basis of\nthe social life. \nThis is not a fragment, but it is a reasonable and widely shared\nassumption that it conveys some Protagorean ideas. The problem is how\nto interpret it. There are at least two possibilities: (1) According\nto several scholars, this myth reflects Protagoras’ views on the\ndevelopment of human civilisation, a highly debated topic in\nfifth-century Athens (Kahn 1981: 98). Such a reading, however, has\nseveral limitations, both if you read it literally or metaphorically.\nTaken literally, the myth is full of inconsistencies. Just to give\nsome examples: there does seem to be a pre-existing human kind, which\nis virtually defined by the possession of qualities which will be\nintroduced later; since first humans were living scattered, it is not\nclear how they developed and used the different specialised arts; if\nlanguage is distributed like the other technai, the absurd\nconclusion is that it does not belong to all human beings; the only\npossible solution to account for the passage from the second to the\nthird phase seems to depend on Zeus’ direct intervention, a\nbelief which is hard to reconcile with Protagoras’ agnosticism\n(see\n §4).\n Taken metaphorically, as a mythical (Platonic?) reshaping of an\nhistorical account, it results in a rather banal summary of some\npopular and widespread views on human progress (Cole 1967: 51) and\ndoes not explain the overall structure of Protagoras’ speech in\nits entirety. As a matter of fact, in the logos which follows\nthe myth there is no interest at all for any sort of chronological\nreconstruction. To be sure, many parallels with the dossier of texts\non the origins of human civilisation can be underlined; there is no\nneed to deny a common ground between Protagoras’ myth and these\ntexts. But there is no need either to read into the myth an historical\nnarrative that either Protagoras or Plato would have reshaped into a\nmyth. (2) An alternative, and more promising, option is to take the\nmyth for what it is, that is, a myth—as a story and not history\n(Farrar 1988; Sihvola 1989; Bonazzi 2011; Beresdorf 2013). It is not a\nmatter of denying that the story is clearly articulated in three\nphases, but of remarking that the myth need not be interpreted in a\nchronological sense as if it were offering a naturalistic\nreconstruction of how our civilisation developed. It is rather meant\nto account for how our society is organised and identify some\nessential features of humankind itself. When read in this way,\nanalytically and not genetically, the myth gains in clarity and\noriginality (interestingly, Plato often uses aetiological mythical\nnarratives about the origins of certain phenomena, see for instance\nBetegh 2009 on the Aesopean myth on pleasure and pain in\nPhaedo 60b–c; these parallels could be tentatively used in\nfavour of the attribution to Plato of the mythological format also in\nthe case of the Protagoras). If the goal is to explain who we\nare, the myth does not need to be divided in three or five steps (as\nit is possible, of course), but rather in two parts, between the\npre-political state of nature and the political world of the city, the\nfirst envisaging an impossible world, a counterfactual example which\nshows e contrario, what is really distinctive of the human\nworld—what really allows men to live the way they live: not\ntechnical skills (or the belief in the gods), but the political\nattitude, which consists in the possess of aidos and\ndike—aidos corresponding to the component that\nenables each to govern himself in his conduct towards other human\nbeings and dike to the norms which regulate the social\nintercourse among human beings (Segvic 2004 [2009: 9–11]). In\nthis myth we find a first defence of the idea, which Aristotle will\nmake famous, that we are political animals. Human beings are political\nanimals: and political society is not so much the final accomplishment\nof mankind’s long journey but the condition of possibility for\nhuman life, which is always associated life. \nThe comparison with the testimonies at our disposal on human\ncivilisation shows what is distinctive, and remarkable, of\nProtagoras’ myth. Scholars insist on the parallels between the\nmyth and these other texts. The differences, however, are even more\ninteresting than the affinities. These texts all share a similar\naccount of the history of human civilisation, underlining the\nimportance of technical skills as the key condition for human\nprogress. From Aeschylus and the other tragic poets to the corpus\nhippocraticum and Diodorus/Democritus, the history of human\nprogress depends on technai, which are praised for enabling\nhuman beings to overcome natural needs and the perils of an hostile\nenvironment and thus to live a prosperous life (for a collection of\nthese texts see Cole 1967 or Guthrie 1971: 79–84; the only\nremarkable exception is the Sisyphus fragment, 88B25 DK,\nwhich is later and clearly reminiscent of sophistical ideas).\nTechne is what marks the distinction between civilisation and\nsavagery, and between human beings and animals. In Protagoras’\nmyth, on the contrary, technai do not play a decisive\nrole—they do not suffice to warrant human survival and\nprosperity. Protagoras rather insists on the fact that\ntechnai, alone, are not able to warrant human progress, nor\nhuman survival, for the problem is not external, natural necessities,\nbut internal, the human tendency to prevaricate and commit injustice:\n \nwhen they gathered together, they committed injustice against one\nanother…so that they scattered once again and were destroyed.\n(Protagoras 322b)  \nThis is a remarkable difference, which changes the terms of the\nproblem. Technical skills can help with natural necessities, but are\nnot useful with human relations, which is by far a much more\ncomplicated problem. The emphasis on technai turns out to be\nexcessive. What warrant human prosperity is the enactment of norms and\nlaws (the problem of dike, justice), along with ethical and\nmoral values (aidos, shame). These ideas are only sketched in\nthe myth, but will be extensively developed in the second part of his\nspeech, where Protagoras repeatedly underlines the political nature of\nhuman beings (see Protagoras 323a, 323b–c, 324c–325a).\nProtagoras’ myth, by underlining this point, presents a very\nsubtle attack against technai and forcefully defends the\nimportance of political art, which is the object of his teaching. \nInterestingly, Protagoras’ critical attitude towards\ntechnai is also confirmed by other Platonic and, even more\nimportant, non-Platonic testimonies. In Protagoras 318e–319a\nProtagoras attacks Prodicus and Hippias because by only teaching\ntechnai such as “arithmetic, astronomy, geometry, and\nmusic” they do not teach the pupils what is really important for\nthe polis (that is, political art). Protagoras’\nargument seems to be that these specialised kinds of expertise are not\nreally useful to the life of the polis, contrary to what is\nclaimed by its supporters. Analogously, Aristotle\n(Metaphysics 998a2-4 = 80B7 DK) and Philodemus (On\nPoems, fr. 11 = 80B7a DK; but the reconstruction of this text is\ncontroversial, see Romeo 1992) inform us that Protagoras attacked\ngeometry and perhaps astronomy and geodesics by arguing that their\nabstract investigations are hardly compatible with the results of\nempirical observation (“a hoop does not touch a straight edge at\na point”, Protagoras argued according to Aristotle,\nMetaphysics 998a2-4 = 80B7 DK); therefore they amount to an\ninsignificant verbal game of no utility. These are probably the\narguments to which Plato himself was alluding to in the\nSophist (232d–e = 80B8 DK) when he reports that Protagoras\nwas teaching how “to contradict each of the artisans” in\nOn Wrestling and the Other Arts. In Protagoras we therefore\nfind two lines of attack against the technai. The first goes\nagainst the widespread view that the technai played a decisive\nrole in achieving civilised society by arguing that they are necessary\nbut not sufficient. Secondly, he attacked some specific\ntechnai such as geometry or astronomy as useless. These are\nadmittedly different arguments and criticisms. But combined together,\nthey seem to confirm the importance of politics and the political art,\nwhich are the objects of Protagoras’ teaching. \nThe emphasis on the political dimension can be paralleled with the\nso-called Protagoras’ “Apology” in the\nTheaetetus—the problem of the compatibility between\nthis dialogue and the Protagoras is one of the most urgent\nproblems in Protagoras’ scholarship. In the myth, it is only\nstated that human beings, insofar as they are human beings, have a\npredisposition towards justice (dike). In the\n“Apology” (and partly in the second part of\nProtagoras’ speech in the Protagoras), there are not\nonly individual decisions at stake but also collective ones. In the\nlatter case the discussion is about the law (nomos), which\ndepends on human decisions and can be modified according to the\ncircumstances  \nwhatever seems [or: is decreed to be, dokein] just and fine\nto each city also is that for it, so long as it thinks [or:\nadopt this law, nomizein]. (80A21a DK)  \nThese two claims can be easily recombined by arguing that the law is\nthe concrete actualisation of the human predisposition towards\njustice. \nWhat is more controversial is how the apparent relativism of the\n“Apology” can be read into the myth and how it can be\nreconciled with its emphasis on the “naturalistic” notion\nof justice in the myth. But the tension is probably more apparent than\nreal, for in the myth it is not said that justice can be developed in\none sense only, and the notion of “useful”, which plays an\nimportant role in both dialogues, paves the way for a consistent\nreading of the two testimonies. Indeed, nomos is not the\nresult of arbitrary decisions but depends on objective situations. But\nsince situations and contexts are different and what is useful varies\nfrom context to context (cf. Protagoras 333e–334c), thus\nnomos also varies. Once again, more than\n“relativism” it is “pluralism” (according to\nwhich the variety of human laws depends on the complexity of reality)\nthat seems to better describe Protagoras’ view. The joint\nreading of the two texts produces therefore something like the\nfollowing: human beings have a predisposition towards justice, which\nis what will enable them to live a prosperous life (the alternative,\nwithout justice, would be conflict and use of force like in the animal\nworld, see below,\n §5.4,\n the reference to Hesiod in the myth); justice, insofar as it is the\ncondition for social life, is in the interest of human beings.\nConcretely speaking, this predisposition towards justice will find its\nactualisation in specific laws, which promote an advantageous\nrelationship with reality. But since reality is complex and unstable,\nlaws can be accordingly modified. The task of the politician (and the\nsophist) is therefore to promote the interest of the political\ncommunity (polis) in any given situation by establishing the\nright (that is, advantageous) laws  \nthe clever and competent orators [i.e., those who publicly discuss\npolitical matters, hence politicians and sophists] make good things\nseem to be just to cities instead of bad ones. (80A21a DK)  \nRemarkably, this conclusion perfectly fits with what Protagoras argues\nin both dialogues by insisting on the importance of competent and\nexpert teachers. \nAll in all, Protagoras appears as one of the first supporters of a\nconventionalist notion of justice (Neschke-Hentschke 1995:\n56–59; Bonazzi 2020: 67–68). Law and justice coincide: the\njust is what is established by law, which is the result of human\ndecisions, a set of rules that men establish together. Interestingly,\nit is precisely this kind of conventionalist account of justice and\nthe relation between nomos and the useful that will be\nobjects of heated debates in the second half of the fifth century BCE,\nmost notably among the sophists (see Antiphon 87B44 DK, significantly\nfrom a treatise entitled Truth,\nXenophon, Memorabilia Book I, Ch. 40–46, Callicles in\nPlato’s Gorgias 483b–484b, Thrasymachus in\nPlato’s Republic 338c–339a,\nThucydides History V 84–105). \nFrom an historical-political perspective it is worth noticing the\nparallel between Protagoras’ thesis and Athenian democracy.\nAwareness of the importance of nomos was of course widely\nspread in the Greek world from an early time. It is not a coincidence,\ntherefore, that in the myth the mention of Zeus’ law clearly\nalludes to some very famous Hesiodic verses (Hesiod is also explicitly\nmentioned among many other authoritative figures earlier in the\ndialogue, at 316d–317c): \nPerses, lay these things in your heart\n\nAnd give heed to Justice, and put violence entirely out of your mind.\n\nThis is the law (nomon) that Cronus’ son [i.e., Zeus]\nhas established for human beings:\n\nThat fish and beasts and winged birds\n\neat one another, since Justice is not among them;\n\nbut to human beings he has given Justice, which is the best by far.\n(Hesiod, Works and Days 274–280) \nThis quotation is not a display of erudition, but aims to indicate the\nreal subtext of the myth, with Protagoras adopting a subtle strategy\nof appropriation of the poet. Hesiod’s basic idea is that\nnomos (law, justice, politics) is what distinguishes humans\nfrom animals, insofar as it allows them to transcend the world of\nbrute force and violence by creating an order based on shared values.\nAs a matter of fact, as we have seen, this is also Protagoras’\nthesis: what is typical of human beings is the common possession of\njustice, which is to say their political and social capacity.\nProtagoras’ myth, by alluding to Hesiod’s story,\nemphasises such a convergence. But also in this case the divergences\nare as interesting than the affinities. Borrowings are never neutral,\nand the appropriation is also a transformation. In Hesiod, Justice is\ndivine, a deity, the daughter of Zeus, who intervened when he saw that\nmen fail to respect her (Works and Days 257, 265;\nTheogony 901–903). All mythological imagery aside, this\nmeans the belief in the existence of absolute justice; human justice\nis not independent of this order of divine values, but must rather\nconform to it. The situation radically changes with Protagoras whose\ninnovation consists in his emphasis on the human rather than divine.\nThere is no place for divinity; justice is something human; it is\ndetermined by laws, which can vary—it is not what brings us\nclose to the gods but what makes it possible to fulfil our natural\npotential. This emphasis on law as the result of collective human\ndecisions was particularly well-suited to one of the key motives of\nthe Athenian democratic propaganda, which insists on the idea of\ndemocracy as everyone’s government, as the government of the\npeople as a whole and not just of a part of it (see Thucydides\nHistory VI 39: “democracy (demos) is the name\nfor all, oligarchy for only a part”). Secondly, also in the\nAthenian political discourse the emphasis on the community is used to\njustify another cornerstone of the democratic ideology, arguably the\nmost important one, namely the very close bond that must hold together\nthe city’s interest and the individual’s, where the former\nis the precondition for the latter (for some interesting parallels,\nsee Pericles in Thucydides History, II 40, 2 and 60,\n2–4 and Herodotus Histories V 78). Thirdly, the\nparallel between the vindication of opinions implied by MM and another\nkey motive of Athenian democracy, isegoria (everyone’s\nright to express their idea in the assembly), need to be taken into\naccount: the right for everyone to express their ideas seems to rely\non the assumption that all opinions are legitimate, as indeed\nProtagoras argued. All in all, without having to posit that\nProtagoras’ doctrines were developed precisely for this purpose,\nit is possible to note that they were far from irrelevant or foreign\nto the new political phase that Athens was experiencing.\nProtagoras’ views provide a theoretical basis for participatory\ndemocracy (Kerferd 1981a: 144; particularly important is Farrar\n1988). Protagoras emerges as a democratic political thinker: he is a\npolitical thinker because he has shown that the social (or\npolitical—from polis) dimension is fundamental; he is\ndemocratic insofar as he suggests that political action is a\ncollective and shared kind of action. It is hardly a coincidence that\nthe main ancient reflections on democracy have often been set in\nrelation to his ideas (see, e.g., Herodotus Histories III\n80–82 or Dissoi logoi 7; Anonymous of Iamblichus, 90, 7\nDK). \nIndeed, presenting democracy, the form of government of the new times,\nas the heir and culmination of the Greek political tradition is\ncertainly a brilliant outcome which legitimises Protagoras’\naspirations and ambitions. By claiming a direct link with the great\npoets and thinkers of the past but also by appropriating and\ntransforming their tenets, Protagoras can present himself as an heir\nto Greek paideia, as one of the great masters, or, rather, as\nthe great master, the only one who is capable of imparting a\nteaching that drew upon tradition but also meet the needs of the new\ntimes. In such a way, Protagoras could reinforce his claim to be the\nnew teacher, the educator capable of imparting teachings suited to the\nneeds of the new world of the polis. Plato’s goal, in the\nProtagoras and in the Theaetetus, was to show that this\nwas not correct—if in the myth the sophist was implicitly\nidentifying himself to Zeus, at the end he will turn out as\nEpimetheus. But for the time being, until this has been proven, one\ncan well understand the enthusiasm of the Athenians when they heard\nthat the great thinker had arrived in Athens (Protagoras\n310b–e).","contact.mail":"m.bonazzi@uu.nl","contact.domain":"uu.nl"}]
