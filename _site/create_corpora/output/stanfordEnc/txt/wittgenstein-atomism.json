Russell’s logical\natomism is set forth chiefly in his 1918 work “The Philosophy of\nLogical Atomism” (Russell 1956), Wittgenstein’s in his\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus of 1921 (Wittgenstein 1981).\nThe core tenets of Wittgenstein’s logical atomism may be stated\nas follows: (i) Every proposition has a unique final analysis which\nreveals it to be a truth-function of elementary propositions\n(Tractatus 3.25, 4.221, 4.51, 5); (ii) These elementary\npropositions assert the existence of atomic states of affairs (3.25,\n4.21); (iii) Elementary propositions are mutually independent —\neach one can be true or false independently of the truth or falsity of\nthe others (4.211, 5.134); (iv) Elementary propositions are immediate\ncombinations of semantically simple symbols or “names”\n(4.221); (v) Names refer to items wholly devoid of complexity,\nso-called “objects” (2.02 & 3.22); (vi) Atomic states\nof affairs are combinations of these objects (2.01).\n\n\nAlthough these doctrines are recognizably atomist in spirit, the term\n‘logical atomism’ is not used by Wittgenstein. It was\nintroduced by Russell in his 1911 lecture to the French Philosophical\nSociety, Le Réalisme Analytique (Russell\n 1911).[1]\n Russell had advertised “The Philosophy of Logical\nAtomism” as being “very largely concerned with explaining\ncertain ideas which [he had] learnt from [his] friend and former pupil\nLudwig Wittgenstein” (Marsh, 177). No doubt partly as a result\nof this description, the term ‘logical atomism’\nsubsequently became associated with Wittgenstein’s early\nphilosophy. The term is now standardly used to apply to a vaguely\ndefined set of doctrines centered on theses (i)–(vi). In\nRussell’s opinion, what makes it appropriate to speak of\nlogical atomism is that the atoms in question are to be\narrived at by logical rather than physical analysis (Russell 1956,\n179). For Wittgenstein too, the ultimate constituents of reality are\nto be revealed by a process of logical analysis; so, to that extent,\nthe label seems apt. It is not, however, uncontroversial (see Floyd\n1998 and\n 2007).[2]\n\nThe “names” spoken of in the Tractatus are not\nmere signs (i.e., typographically or phonologically identified\ninscriptions), but rather signs-together-with-their-meanings —\nor “symbols.” Being symbols, names are identified and\nindividuated only in the context of significant sentences. A name is\n“semantically simple” in the sense that its meaning does\nnot depend on the meanings of its orthographic parts, even when those\nparts are, in other contexts, independently meaningful. So, for\nexample, it would not count against the semantic simplicity of the\nsymbol ‘Battle’ as it figures in the sentence\n“Battle commenced” that it contains the orthographic part,\n“Bat,” even though this part has a meaning of its own in\nother sentential contexts. For Wittgenstein, however, something else\ndoes count against this symbol’s semantic simplicity, namely,\nthat it is analyzable away in favour of talk of the actions of people,\netc. This point suggests that in natural language Tractarian names\nwill be rare and hard to find. Even apparently simple singular terms\nsuch as ‘Obama,’ ‘London,’ etc., will not be\ncounted as “names” by the strict standards of the\nTractatus since they will disappear on further analysis.\n(Hereafter, ‘name’ will mean “Tractarian name”\nunless otherwise indicated.) \nIt is a matter of controversy whether the Tractatus reserves\nthe term ‘name’ for semantically simple symbols referring\nto particulars, or whether the term comprehends semantically simple\nsymbols of all kinds. Since objects are just the referents of names,\nthis issue goes hand in hand with the question whether objects are one\nand all particulars or whether they include properties and relations.\nThe former view is defended by Irving Copi (Copi 1958) and Elizabeth\nAnscombe (Anscombe 1959, 108 ff), among others. It is supported by\nTractatus 2.0231: “[Material properties] are first\npresented by propositions — first formed by the configuration of\nobjects.” This might seem to suggest that simple properties are\nnot objects but rather arise from the combining or configuring of\nobjects. The Copi-Anscombe interpretation has been taken to receive\nfurther support from Tractatus 3.1432: \nThis has suggested to some commentators that relations are not,\nstrictly speaking, nameable, and so not Tractarian objects (see, for\nexample, Ricketts, 1996, Section III). It may, however, be intended\ninstead simply to bring out the point that Tractarian names are not\nconfined to particulars, but include relations between particulars; so\nthis consideration is less compelling.  \nThe opposing view, according to which names include predicates and\nrelational expressions, has been defended by Erik Stenius and Merrill\nand Jaakko Hintikka, among others (Stenius, 1960, 61–69;\nHintikka and Hintikka, 1986, 30–34). It is supported by a\nNotebooks entry from 1915 in which objects are explicitly\nsaid to include properties and relations (NB, 61). It is\nfurther buttressed by Wittgenstein’s explanation to Desmond Lee\n(in 1930–1) of Tractatus 2.01:\n“‘Objects’ also include relations; a proposition is\nnot two things connected by a relation. ‘Thing’ and\n‘relation’ are on the same level.” (LK,\n120). \nThe Anscombe-Copi reading treats the forms of elementary propositions\nas differing radically from anything we may be familiar with from\nordinary — or even Fregean — grammar. It thus respects\nWittgenstein’s warning to Waismann in 1929 that “The\nlogical structure of elementary propositions need not have the\nslightest similarly with the logical structure of [non-elementary]\npropositions” (WWK, 42). \nGoing beyond this, Wittgenstein seems once to have held that there\n can be no resemblance between the apparent or surface forms\nof non-elementary propositions and the forms of elementary\npropositions. In “Some Remarks on Logical Form” (1929) he\nsays: “One is often tempted to ask from an a priori standpoint:\nWhat, after all, can be the only forms of atomic propositions, and to\nanswer, e.g., subject-predicate and the relational propositions with\ntwo or more terms further, perhaps, propositions relating predicates\nand relations with one another, and so on. But this, I believe, is a\nmere playing with words” (Klagge and Nordman, 1993, 30). A\nsimilar thought already occurs in a more compressed form in the\nTractatus itself: “There cannot be a hierarchy of the\nforms of the elementary propositions. Only that which we ourselves\nconstruct can we foresee” (5.556). \nIt is possible, then, that the options we began with represent a false\ndichotomy. Perhaps Wittgenstein simply did not have an antecedent\nopinion on the question whether Tractarian names will turn out to be\nnames of particulars only, particulars and universals, or whatnot. And\nit may even be that he believed that the final analysis of language\nwould (or might) reveal the names to defy such classifications\naltogether. This broader range of interpretive possibilities has only\nrecently begun to receive the attention it deserves (See Johnston\n2009). \nBy “Linguistic atomism” we shall understand the view that\nthe analysis of every proposition terminates in a proposition all of\nwhose genuine components are names. It is a striking fact that the\nTractatus contains no explicit argument for linguistic\natomism. This fact has led some commentators — e.g., Peter\nSimons (1992) — to suppose that Wittgenstein’s position\nhere is motivated less by argument than by brute intuition. And\nindeed, Wittgenstein does present some conclusions in this vicinity as\nif they required no argument. At 4.221, for example, he says:\n“It is obvious that in the analysis of propositions we\nmust come to elementary propositions, which consist of names in\nimmediate combination” (emphasis added). Nonetheless, some basic\nobservations about the Tractatus’s conception of\nanalysis will enable us to see why Wittgenstein should have thought it\nobvious that analysis must terminate in this way.  \nA remark from the Philosophical Grammar, written in 1936,\nthrows light on how Wittgenstein had earlier conceived of the process\nof analysis:  \nOne of the distinctive features of Russell’s definition is that\nit treats the expression “the x such that\nFx” as an “incomplete symbol.” Such symbols\nhave no meaning in isolation but are given meaning by contextual\ndefinitions that treat of the sentential contexts in which they occur\n(cf. PM, 66). Incomplete symbols do, of course, have\nmeaning because they make a contribution to the meanings of the\nsentences in which they occur (cf. Principles, Introduction,\nx). What is special about them is that they make this contribution\nwithout expressing a propositional constituent. (On the nature of\nincomplete symbols, see Pickel 2013) \nRussell’s definition is contained in the following clauses (For\nthe sake of expository transparency, his scope-indicating devices are\nomitted.). \n[1] G(the x: Fx) =\n∃x(∀y(Fy↔y=x)\n& Gx)    Df.\n\n(cf. Russell 1905b; Russell 1990, 173)  \n[2] (the x: Fx) exists =\n∃x∀y(Fy↔y=x)\n   Df.\n\n(cf. Russell 1990, 174) \nThe fact that existence is dealt with by a separate definition shows\nthat Russell means to treat the predicate ‘exists’ as\nitself an incomplete symbol, to be eliminated in favour of the\nexistential quantifier.  \nOne can understand why Wittgenstein discerned an affinity between the\ntheory of descriptions and his own envisioned “calculus,”\nfor one can extract from his remarks in the Tractatus and\nelsewhere two somewhat parallel proposals for eliminating what he\ncalls terms for “complexes”:  \nClauses [1] to [4] share the feature that any sentence involving\napparent reference to an individual is treated as false rather than as\nneither true nor false if that individual should be discovered not to\nexist.  \nWittgenstein’s first contextual definition — our [3]\n— occurs in a Notebooks entry from 1914 (NB,\n4), but it is also alluded to in the Tractatus:  \nIn [3] the statement “about [the complex’s] constituent\nparts” is “Fa & Fb,” while the\nproposition which “completely describes” the complex is\n“aRb.” If the propositions obtained by applying\n[3] and [4] are to be further analysed, a two-stage procedure will be\nnecessary: first, the apparent names generated by the analysis —\nin the present case ‘a’ and\n‘b’ — will need to be\n replaced[3]\n with symbols that are overtly terms for complexes, e.g.,\n‘[cSd]’ and ‘[eFg];’ second,\nthe contextual definitions [3] and [4] will need to be applied again\nto eliminate these terms. If there is going to be a unique final\nanalysis, each apparent name will have to be uniquely paired\nwith a term for a complex. So the program of analysis at which\nWittgenstein gestures, in addition to committing him to something\nanalogous to Russell’s theory of descriptions, also commits him\nto the analogue of Russell’s “description theory of\nordinary names” (cf. Russell 1905a). This is the idea that every\napparent name not occurring at the end of analysis is equivalent in\nmeaning to some definite description.  \nWittgenstein’s first definition, like Russell’s, strictly\nspeaking, stands in need of a device for indicating scope, for\notherwise it would be unclear how to apply the analysis when we\nchoose, say, “~G” as our instance of\n“F.” In such a case the question would arise\nwhether the resulting instance of [3] is [5]:\n“~G[aRb] = ~Ga & ~Gb\n& aRb,” which corresponds to giving the term for a\ncomplex wide scope with respect to the negation operator, or whether\nit is: [6] “~G[aRb] = ~[Ga &\nGb & aRb],” which corresponds to giving\nthe term for a complex narrow scope. One suspects that\nWittgenstein’s intention would most likely have been to follow\nRussell’s convention of reading the logical operator as having\nnarrow scope unless the alternative is expressly indicated (cf.\nPM, 172).  \nDefinition [3] has obvious flaws. While it may work for such\npredicates as “x is located in England,” it\nobviously fails for certain others, e.g., “x is greater\nthan three feet long” and “x weighs exactly four\npounds.” This problem can hardly have escaped Wittgenstein; so\nit seems likely that he would have regarded his proposals merely as\ntentative illustrations, open to supplementation and refinement. \nAlthough Wittgenstein’s second contextual definition — our\n[4] — does not occur in the Tractatus, it is implied by\na remark from the Notes on Logic that seems to anticipate\n2.0201:  \nSince the proposition that “describes the complex,”\n[aRb], “perfectly” is just the proposition that\naRb, Wittgenstein’s clarifying addendum amounts to the\nclaim that the proposition “aRb” is equivalent to\nthe proposition “[aRb] exists.” And this\nequivalence is just our [4]. \nIt turns out, then, that existence is defined only in contexts in\nwhich it is predicated of complexes. Wittgenstein proposal thus\nmirrors Russell’s in embodying the idea that it makes no sense\nto speak of the existence of immediately given (that is, named)\nsimples (cf. PM, 174–5). This is why Wittgenstein was\nlater to refer to his “objects” as “that for which\nthere is neither existence nor non-existence” (PR, 72).\nHis view seems to be that when ‘a’ is a\nTractarian name, what we try to say by uttering the nonsense string\n“a exists” will, strictly speaking, be\nshown by the fact that the final analysis of some proposition\ncontains ‘a’ (cf. 5.535). But of course, the\nTractatus does not always speak strictly. Indeed, what is\ngenerally taken to be the ultimate conclusion of the\nTractatus’s so-called “Argument for\nSubstance” (2.021–2.0211) itself tries to say something\nthat can only be shown, since it asserts the existence of\nobjects. The sharpness of the tension here is only partly disguised by\nthe oblique manner in which the conclusion is formulated. Instead of\narguing for the existence of objects, the Tractatus argues\nfor the thesis that the world “has substance.” However,\nbecause “objects constitute the substance of the world”\n(2.021), and because substance is that which exists\nindependently of what is the case (2.024), this is tantamount to\nsaying that objects exist. So it seems that Wittgenstein’s\nargument for substance must be regarded as a part of the ladder we are\nsupposed to throw away (6.54). But having acknowledged this point, we\nshall set it aside as peripheral to our main concerns.  \nThe most obvious similarity between the two sets of definitions is\nthat each seeks to provide for the elimination of what purport to be\nsemantically complex referring expressions. The most obvious\ndifference consists in the fact that Wittgenstein’s definitions\nare designed to eliminate not definite descriptions, but rather terms\nfor complexes, for example the expression\n“[aRb],” which, judging by remarks in the\nNotebooks, is to be read: “a in the relation R to\nb” (NB, 48) (This gloss seems to derive from\nRussell’s manner of speaking of complexes in Principia\nMathematica, where examples of terms for complexes include, in\naddition to “a in the relation R to\nb,” “a having the quality\nq”, and “a and b and c\nstanding in the relation S” (PM, 44).). One\nmight wonder why there should be this difference at all. Why not treat\nthe peculiar locution “a in the relation R to\nb” as a definite description — as say, “the\ncomplex consisting of a and b, combined so that\naRb”? This description could then be eliminated by\napplying the Tractatus’s own variant upon the theory of\ndescriptions:  \nHere the distinctness of the variables (the fact that they are\ndistinct) replaces the sign for distinctness “≠” (cf.\n5.53). \nSince Wittgenstein did not adopt this expedient, it seems likely that\nhe would have regarded the predicate “x is a complex\nconsisting of a and b, combined so that\naRb” as meaningless in virtue of — among other\nthings — its containing ineliminable occurrences of the\npseudo-concepts “complex,” “combination,” and\n“constitution.” Only the first of these notions figures on\nhis list of pseudo-concepts in the Tractatus (4.1272), but\nthere is no indication that that list is supposed to be exhaustive.\n \nThere is a further respect in which Wittgenstein’s analytical\nproposals differ from Russell’s. Russell’s second\ndefinition — our [2] — has the effect of shifting the\nburden of indicating ontological commitment from the word\n‘exists’ to the existential quantifier. In\nWittgenstein’s definition, by contrast, no single item of\nvocabulary takes over the role of indicating ontological commitment.\nThat commitment is indicated only after the final application\nof the definition, by the meaningfulness of the names in the fully\nanalysed proposition — or, more precisely, by the fact that\ncertain symbols are names (cf. 5.535). The somewhat paradoxical\nconsequence is that one can assert a statement of the form\n“[aRb] exists” without thereby manifesting any\nontological commitment to the complex [aRb] (cf.\nEPB, 121). What this shows is that the two theories relieve\nthe assertor of ontological commitments of quite different kinds. In\nRussell’s case, the analysis — our [2] — removes a\ncommitment to an apparent propositional constituent — a\n“denoting concept”\n [5]\n —expressed by the phrase ‘the F,’ but it\ndoes not remove the commitment to the F itself. For\nWittgenstein, by contrast, the analysis shows that the assertor never\nwas ontologically committed to the complex [aRb] by an\nutterance of “[aRb] exists.”  \nRussell’s conception of analysis at the time of the theory of\ndescriptions — c.a. 1905 — is relatively clear: Analysis\ninvolves pairing up one sentence with another that expresses, more\nperspicuously, the very same Russellian proposition. The analysans\ncounts as more perspicuous than the analysandum because the former is\nfree of some of the latter’s merely apparent ontological\ncommitments. By the time of Principia Mathematica, however,\nthis relatively transparent conception of analysis is no longer\navailable. Having purged his ontology of propositions in 1910, Russell\ncan no longer appeal to the idea that analysans and analysandum\nexpress one and the same proposition. He now adopts “the\nmultiple relation theory of judgment,” according to which the\njudgment (say) that Othello loves Desdemona, instead of being, as\nRussell had formerly supposed, a dyadic relation between the judging\nmind and the proposition Othello loves Desdemona, is now\ntaken to be a non-dyadic, or, in Russell’s terminology,\n“multiple,” relation whose terms are the judging mind and\nthose items that were formerly regarded as constituents of the\nproposition Othello loves Desdemona (Russell 1994, 155).\nAfter 1910 Russell can say that a speaker who sincerely assertively\nuttered the analysans (in a given context) would be guaranteed to make\nthe same judgment as one who sincerely assertively uttered the\nanalysandum (in the same context), but he can no longer explain this\naccomplishment by saying that the two sentences express the same\nproposition.  \nA further departure from the earlier, relatively transparent\nconception of analysis is occasioned by Russell’s resolution of\nthe set-theoretic version of his paradox. His solution involves giving\nan analysis of a sentence whose utterance could not be taken to\nexpress any judgment. One argues that the sentence\n“{x: φx} ε {x:\nφx}” is nonsense because the contextual definitions\nproviding for the elimination of class terms yield for this case a\nsentence that is itself nonsense by the lights of the theory of types\n(PM, 76). It’s (apparent) negation is, accordingly,\nalso nonsense. In Principia, then, there is no very clear\nmodel of what is preserved in analysis. The best we can say is that\nRussell’s contextual definitions have the feature that a\n(sincere, assertive) utterance of the analysans is guaranteed to\nexpress the same judgment as the analysandum, if the latter\nexpresses a judgment at all.  \nSome of the unclarity in the conception of analysis introduced by\nRussell’s rejection of propositions is inherited by\nWittgenstein, who similarly rejects any ontology of shadowy entities\nexpressed by sentences. In the Tractatus a\n“proposition” (Satz) is a “propositional\nsign in its projective relation to the world” (3.12). This makes\nit seem as though any difference between propositional signs should\nsuffice for a difference between propositions, in which case analysans\nand analysandum could at best be distinct propositions with the same\ntruth conditions.  \nEnough has now been said to make possible a consideration of\nWittgenstein’s reasons for describing the position I have been\ncalling “linguistic atomism” as “obvious.”\nSince the model for Tractarian analysis is the replacement of apparent\nnames with (apparently) co-referring “terms for\ncomplexes,” together with eliminative paraphrase of the latter,\nit follows trivially that the endpoint of analysis, if there is one,\nwill contain neither “terms for complexes” nor expressions\nthat can be replaced by terms for complexes.  \nWittgenstein, moreover, thinks it obvious that this analysis of every\nproposition does terminate. The reason he supposes analysis\ncannot go on forever is that he conceives an unanalyzed proposition as\nderiving its sense from its analysis. As Tractatus\n3.261 puts it: “Every defined sign signifies via those signs by\nwhich it is defined” (Cf. NB, 46; PT 3.20102).\nIt follows that no proposition can have an infinite analysis, on pain\nof never acquiring a sense. So analysis must terminate in propositions\ndevoid of incomplete symbols.  \nThat much, at least, is plausibly obvious, but unfortunately\nit does not follow that the final analysis of language will be wholly\ndevoid of complex symbols. The trouble is that for all we have said so\nfar, a fully analysed proposition might yet contain one or more\ncomplex symbols that have meaning in their own right.\nClearly, then, Wittgenstein was assuming that all genuine referring\nexpressions must be semantically simple: they must lack anything like\na Fregean sense. But why should that be so? The seeds of one answer\nare contained in Tractatus 3.3, the proposition in which\nWittgenstein enunciates his own version of Frege’s context\nprinciple: “Only the proposition has sense; only in the context\nof a proposition has a name meaning” (3.3). Wittgenstein’s\njuxtaposition of these two claims suggests that the context principle\nis supposed to be his ground for rejecting senses for sub-sentential\nexpressions. But just how it could provide such a ground is far from\nclear. Another, more concrete, possibility is that Wittgenstein simply\naccepted the arguments Russell had given in “On Denoting”\nfor rejecting senses for sub-sentential expressions.  \nBy “Metaphysical atomism” we will understand the view that\nthe semantically simple symbols occurring in a proposition’s\nfinal analysis refer to simples. The Tractatus does not\ncontain a distinct argument for this thesis, but, as we will\nsee, one uncovers the needed argument in the course of scrutinizing\nthe famous “Argument for Substance” of 2.0211–2:\n \nTo see what precisely is being contended for in this argument one\nneeds to appreciate the historical resonances of Wittgenstein’s\ninvocation of the notion of “substance.” \nThe Tractatus’s notion of substance is the modal\nanalogue of Kant’s temporal notion. Whereas for Kant, substance\nis that which “persists” (in the sense of existing at all\ntimes), for Wittgenstein it is that which, figuratively speaking,\n“persists” through a “space” of possible\nworlds. Tractarian substance is the “unchanging” in the\nmetaphorical sense of that which does not undergo existence change in\nthe passage (also metaphorical) from world to world. Less\nfiguratively, Tractarian substance is that which exists with respect\nto every possible world. For Kant, to assert that there is substance\n(in the schematized sense of the category) is to say that that there\nis some stuff such that every existence change (i.e., origination or\nannihilation) is necessarily an alteration or reconfiguration of that\nstuff. For Wittgenstein, analogously, to say that there is substance\nis to say that there are some things such that all “existence\nchanges” in the metaphorical passage from world to world are\nreconfigurations of them. What undergo “existence changes”\nare atomic states of affairs (configurations of objects): a state of\naffairs exists with respect to one world but fails to exist with\nrespect to another. Those things that remain in existence through\nthese existence changes, and which are reconfigured in the process,\nare Tractarian objects. It follows that the objects that\n“constitute the substance of the world” (2.021) are\nnecessary existents. The Tractatus , rather wonderfully,\ncompresses this whole metaphorical comparison into a single remark:\n“The object is the fixed, the existing [das\nBestehende]; the configuration is the changing [das\nWechselnde].” (2.0271). “Wechsel,” it\nshould be noted, is the word that Kant expressly reserves for the\nnotion of existence change as opposed to alteration\n(Critique, A 187/B230). (Unfortunately, however, whether\nWittgenstein had read the Critique in time for this\ncircumstance to have influenced his own phrasing in the\nTractatus is unknown.) \nTractarian objects are what any “imagined”—or, more\naccurately, conceivable—world has in common with the\nreal world (2.022). Accordingly, they constitute the world’s\n“fixed form” (2.022–3). ‘Fixed’ because,\nunlike the world’s content, objects (existentially speaking)\nhold fast in the transition from world to world. ‘Form’\nbecause they constitute what is shared by all the worlds. (On\nWittgenstein’s conception of possibility, the notion of an\n“alien” Tractarian object — one which is\nmerely possible — is not even intelligible). If the\nobjects make up the world’s form, what makes up its content? The\nanswer, I think, is the various obtaining atomic states of affairs.\nDistinct worlds differ with respect to content because they differ\nwith respect to which possible states of affairs obtain. Notably,\npossible atomic states of affairs also allow for a distinction between\nform and content. Their form is the manner of combination of their\ncomponents, their content those components themselves (that is, their\ncontained objects). If this is right, it follows that substance\n— the totality of objects — is indeed, as Wittgenstein\nsays, “both form and content” (2.024–5). It is at\nonce the form of the world and the content of possible states of\naffairs (These and further details of this interpretation of\nWittgenstein’s conception of substance as the fixed or\nunchanging are provided in Proops 2004; see also Zalabardo 2015,\nAppendix II for more on simples, names, and necessary existents).  \nAs we have seen, the immediate goal of the argument for substance is\nto establish that there are things that exist necessarily. In the\ncontext of the assumption that anything complex could fail to exist\nthrough decomposition, this conclusion entails that there are simples\n(2.021). While the argument is presented as a two-stage modus\ntollens, it is conveniently reconstructed as a reductio ad\nabsurdum (The following interpretation of the argument is a\ncompressed version of that provided in Proops 2004. For two recent\nalternatives, see Zalabardo 2015, 243–254 and Morris 2017):  \nContradiction \nOur [5] is the main suppressed premise. It means, simply, that we can\nframe senseful propositions. Let us now consider how we might try to\ndefend the inference from [2] to [3] on Wittgensteinian principles. As\na preliminary, note that, given Wittgenstein’s equation in the\nNotes on Logic of having sense with having truth-poles\n(NB, 99), it seems reasonable to suppose that for a sentence\nto “have sense” with respect to a given world may be for\nit to have a truth value with respect to that world. Let us assume\nthat this is so. Now suppose that everything exists contingently.\nThen, in particular, the referents of the semantically simple symbols\noccurring in a fully analysed sentence will exist contingently. But\nthen any such sentence will contain a semantically simple symbol that\nfails to refer with respect to some possible world. Suppose, as a\nbackground assumption, that there are no contingent simples. (It will\nbe argued below that this assumption plausibly follows from certain\nTractarian commitments.) Then, if we assume that a sentence containing\na semantically simple term is neither true nor false evaluated with\nrespect to a world in which its purported referent fails to exist\n— and, for now, we do — then, for any such fully analysed\nsentence, there will be some world such that the sentence depends for\nits truth valuedness with respect to that world on the truth with\nrespect to that world of some other sentence, viz., the\nsentence stating that the constituents of the relevant complex are\nconfigured in a manner necessary and sufficient for its existence. It\nfollows that if everything exists contingently, then whether a\nsentence is senseful with respect to a world will depend on whether\nanother sentence is true with respect to that world. \nThe step from [3] to [4] runs as follows. Suppose that whether any\nsentence “has sense” (i.e., on our reading, has a\ntruth-value) depends (in the way just explained) on whether another is\ntrue. Then every sentence will have an “indeterminate\nsense” in the sense that it will lack a truth value with respect\nto at least one possible world. But an indeterminate sense is no sense\nat all, for a proposition by its very nature “reaches through\nthe whole logical space” (3.42) (i.e., it is truth-valued with\nrespect to every possible\n world).[6]\n So if every sentence depended for its “sense” (i.e.,\ntruth-valuedness) on the truth of another, no sentence would have a\ndeterminate sense, and so no sentence would have a sense. In which\ncase we would be unable to frame senseful propositions (i.e., to\n“draw up pictures of the world true or false”).  \nOne apparent difficulty concerns the assumption that to have sense is\njust to be true or false. How can such a view be attributed to the\nWittgenstein of the Tractatus given his view that tautology,\nwhich is true, and contradiction, which is false, are without sense\n(sinnlos) (4.461)? The seeds of an answer may be contained in\na remark from Wittgenstein’s lectures at Cambridge during the\nyear 1934–1935. Looking back on what he’d written in the\nTractatus, he says: \nIt is possible, then, that Wittgenstein is thinking of a\nsinnlos proposition as a proposition that “has\nsense” but has it to a zero degree. According to this\nconception, a tautology, being true, is, in contrast to a nonsensical\nstring, in the running for possessing a non-zero quantity of sense,\nbut is so constructed that, in the end, it doesn’t get to have\none. And, importantly, in virtue of being in the running for having a\nnon-zero quantity of sense its possession of a zero quantity amounts\nto its, broadly speaking, ‘having sense’. Such a view,\naccording to which, for some non-count noun N, an N-less entity has N,\nbut has a zero quantity of it, is not without precedent in the\ntradition. Kant, for example, regards rest (motionlessness) as a\nspecies of motion: a zero quantity of it (Bader, Other Internet\nResources, 22–23). If Sinnlosigkeit is, similarly, a\nspecies of Sinn, the equation of having Sinn with\nbeing true or false will be preserved. To offer a full defence of this\nunderstanding of Sinnlosigkeit would take us too far afield,\nbut I mention it to show that the current objection is not\ndecisive. \nAnother apparent difficulty for this reconstruction arises from its\nappearing to contradict Tractatus 3.24, which clearly\nsuggests that if the complex entity A were not to exist, the\nproposition “F[A]” would be false,\nrather than, as the argument requires, without truth value. But the\ndifficulty is only apparent. It merely shows that 3.24 belongs to a\ntheory that assumes that the world does have substance. On\nthis assumption Wittgenstein can say that whenever an apparent name\noccurs that appears to mention a complex this is only because it is\nnot, after all, a genuine name — and this is what he does say.\nBut on the assumption that the world has no substance, so that\neverything is complex, Wittgenstein can no longer say this.\nFor now he must allow that the semantically simple symbols occurring\nin a proposition’s final analysis do refer to complexes. So in\nthe context of the assumption that every proposition has a final\nanalysis, the reductio assumption of the argument for\nsubstance entails the falsity of 3.24. But since 3.24 is assumed to be\nfalse only in the context of a reductio, it is something that\nWittgenstein can consistently endorse (This solution to the apparent\ndifficulty for the present reconstruction is owed, in its essentials,\nto David Pears (see Pears 1987, 78). \nTo complete the argument it only remains to show that Tractarian\ncommitments extrinsic to the argument for substance rule out\ncontingent\n simples.[7]\n Suppose a is a contingent simple. Then “a\nexists” must be a contingent proposition. But it cannot be an\nelementary proposition because it will be entailed by any elementary\nproposition containing ‘a,’ and elementary\npropositions are logically independent (4.211). So “a\nexists” must be non-elementary, and so further analyzable. And\nyet there would seem to be no satisfactory analysis of this\nproposition on the assumption that ‘a’ names a\ncontingent simple — no analysis, that is to say, that is both\nintrinsically plausible and compatible with Tractarian principles.\nWittgenstein cannot analyse “a exists” as the\nproposition “∃x(x = a)”\nfor two reasons. First, he would reject this analysis on the grounds\nthat it makes an ineliminable use of the identity sign (5.534).\nSecond, given his analysis of existential quantifications as\ndisjunctions, the proposition “∃x(x =\na)” would be further analysed as the\nnon-contingent proposition “a = a\n∨ a = b ∨ a =\nc…”. Nor can he analyse “a\nexists” as “~[ ~Fa & ~Ga &\n~Ha…]” — that is, as the negation of the\nconjunction of the negations of every elementary proposition involving\n“a.” To suppose that it could, is to suppose that\nthe proposition “~Fa & ~Ga &\n~Ha…” means “a does not\nexist,” and yet by the lights of the Tractatus this\nproposition would show a’s existence —\nor, more correctly, it would show something that one tries to put into\nwords by saying “a exists” (cf. 5.535,\nCorr, 126)). So, pending an unforeseen satisfactory analysis\nof “a exists,” this proposition will have to be\nanalysed as a complex of propositions not involving a. In\nother words, ‘a’ will have to be treated as an\nincomplete symbol and the fact of a’s existence will\nhave to be taken to consist in the fact that objects other than\na stand configured thus and so. But that would seem to entail\nthat a is not simple. \nThe argument for substance may be criticized on several grounds.\nFirst, the step leading from [2] to [3] relies on the assumption that\na name fails to refer with respect to a possible world at which its\nactual-world referent does not exist. This amounts to the\ncontroversial assumption that names do not function as what Nathan\nSalmon has called “obstinately rigid designators” (Salmon\n1981, 34). Secondly, the step leading from [3] to [4] relies on the\nassumption that a sentence that is neither true nor false with respect\nto some possible world fails to express a sense. As Wittgenstein was\nlater to realize, the case of intuitively senseful, yet vague\nsentences plausibly constitutes a counterexample (cf. PI\nSection 99). Lastly, one may question the assumption that it makes\nsense to speak of a final analysis, given that the procedure for\nanalysing a sentence of ordinary language has not been made clear (See\nPI, Sections 60, 63–4, and Section 91).  \nHow could we possibly know that something is a Tractarian object?\nWittgenstein has little or nothing to say on this topic in the\nTractatus, and yet it is clear from his retrospective remarks\nthat during the composition of the Tractatus he did think it\npossible in principle to discover the Tractarian objects (See\nAM, 11 and EPB, 121). So it seems worth asking by\nwhat means he thought such a discovery might be made.  \nSometimes, it can seem as though Wittgenstein just expected to hit\nupon the simples by reflecting from the armchair on those items that\nstruck him as most plausibly lacking in proper parts. This impression\nis most strongly suggested in the Notebooks, and in\nparticular in a passage from June 1915 in which Wittgenstein seems to\nexpress confidence that certain objects already within his ken either\ncount as Tractarian objects or will turn out to do so. He says:\n“It seems to me perfectly possible that patches in our visual\nfield are simple objects, in that we do not perceive any single point\nof a patch separately; the visual appearances of stars even seem\ncertainly to be so” (NB, 64). By “patches in our\nvisual field” in this context Wittgenstein means parts of the\nvisual field with no noticeable parts. In other words, points\nin visual space (cf. KL, 120). Clearly, then, Wittgenstein at\none stage believed he could specify some Tractarian objects. However,\nthe balance of the evidence suggests that this idea was short-lived.\nFor he was later to say that he and Russell had pushed the question of\nexamples of simples to one side as a matter to be settled on a future\noccasion (AM, 11). And when Norman Malcolm pressed\nWittgenstein to say whether when he wrote the Tractatus he\nhad decided on anything as an example of a “simple\nobject,” he had replied — according to Malcolm’s\nreport — that “at the time his thought had been that he\nwas a logician; and that it was not his business as a logician, to try\nto decide whether this thing or that was a simple thing or a complex\nthing, that being a purely empirical matter” (Malcolm 1989,\n70). \nWittgenstein was not suggesting that the correct way to establish that\nsomething is a Tractarian object is to gather evidence that its\ndecomposition is physically impossible. That reading would\nonly have a chance of being correct if Wittgenstein had taken\nmetaphysical possibility to coincide with physical possibility, and\nthat is evidently not\n so.[8]\n His meaning seems rather to be just that the objects must be\ndiscovered rather than postulated or otherwise specified in advance of\ninvestigation (cf. AM, 11). But since Wittgenstein was later\nto accuse his Tractarian self of having entertained the concept of a\ndistinctive kind of philosophical discovery (see WVC\n182, quoted below), we must not jump — as Malcolm appears to\nhave done, to the conclusion that he conceived of the discovery in\nquestion as “empirical” in anything like the contemporary\nsense of the word.  \nWe know that Wittgenstein denied categorically that we could\nspecify the possible forms of elementary propositions and the\nsimples a priori (4.221, 5.553–5.5541, 5.5571). But he\ndid not deny that these forms would be revealed as the result of\nlogical analysis. In fact, he maintained precisely this view. This\nidea is not explicit in the Tractatus, but it is spelled out\nin a later self-critical remark from G. E. Moore’s notes of\nWittgenstein’s 1933 lectures at Cambridge:  \nSpeaking of Tractarian objects in another retrospective remark, this\ntime from a German version of the Brown Book, Wittgenstein\nsays: “What these [fundamental constituents] of reality are it\nseemed difficult to say. I thought it was the job of further logical\nanalysis to discover them” (EPB 121). These remarks\nshould be taken at face value: it is logical analysis — the\nanalysis of propositions — that is supposed to enable us to\ndiscover the forms of elementary propositions and the objects. The\nhope is that when propositions have been put into their final, fully\nanalysed forms by applying the “calculus” spoken of in the\nPhilosophical Grammar we will finally come to know the names\nand thereby the objects. Presumably, we will know the latter by\nacquaintance in the act of grasping propositions in their final\nanalysed forms. \nAdmittedly, Wittgenstein’s denial that we can know the objects\na priori looks strange given the fact that the analytical\nprocedure described in Section 2 above seems to presuppose that we\nhave a priori knowledge both of the correct analyses of ordinary names\nand of the contextual definitions by means of which terms for\ncomplexes are eliminated. But some tension in Wittgenstein’s\nposition on this point is just what we should expect in view of his\nlater rather jaundiced assessment of his earlier reliance on the idea\nof philosophical discovery: \nThe remark that Wittgenstein quotes here from “a manuscript of\nthe Tractatus” did not survive into the final version,\nbut its sentiment is clearly echoed in the related remark that there\ncan: “never be surprises in logic” (6.1251). Wittgenstein\nis clear that in the Tractatus he had unwittingly proceeded\nas though there could be such a thing as a philosophical\nsurprise or discovery. His idea that the true objects would be\ndiscovered through analysis, but are nonetheless not known a\npriori, is plausibly one instance of this mistake. \nOn the conception of the Tractatus, objects are to be\ndiscovered by grasping fully analysed propositions, presumably\nwith the awareness that they are fully analysed. But\nsince that is so, we shall not have fully explained how we are\nsupposed to be able to discover the simples unless we explain how, in\npractice, we can know we have arrived at the final analysis of a\nproposition. But on this point, unfortunately, Wittgenstein has little\nto say. In fact, the only hint he offers is the rather dark one\ncontained in Tractatus 3.24:  \nIt is an indeterminateness in propositions — whatever this might\namount to — that is supposed to alert us to the need for further\nanalysis. In Wittgenstein’s view, then, we possess a positive\ntest for analyzability. However, since the notion of\n“indeterminateness” in question is unclear, the test is of\nlittle practical value. The indeterminateness in question is plainly\nnot the one considered in section 3: what is in question at the\npresent juncture is the indeterminateness of propositions, not of\nsenses. But what does that amount to? \nAccording to one line of interpretation, due originally to W. D. Hart\n(Hart 1971), a proposition is indeterminate when there is more than\none way it can be true. Thus if I say “Barack Obama is in the\nUnited States,” I leave open where in particular he might be.\nThe source of the indeterminacy is the implied generality of this\nstatement, which is tantamount to: “Obama is somewhere\nin the United States.” This line of interpretation has the merit\nof promising to make sense of the closing parenthetical remark of\n3.24. But it cannot be correct. The kind of indeterminacy that\nWittgenstein has in mind at 3.24 is supposed to serve as a sign of\nfurther analysability. But Hart’s notion cannot play this role,\nsince any disjunctive proposition would be indeterminate in his sense,\neven a fully analysed proposition consisting of a disjunction of\nelementary propositions. \nAccording to a second line of interpretation, a proposition is\nindeterminate in the relevant sense if the result of embedding it in\nsome context is structurally ambiguous. Consider, for example, the\nresult of embedding “F [A]” in the\ncontext “it is not true that,” where\n‘A’ is temporarily treated as a semantically\nsimple term designating a complex (Keep in place the assumption that a\nsentence containing a non-referring semantically simple term is\nneither true nor false). In this case the question would arise whether\nthe result of this embedding is neither true nor false evaluated with\nrespect to a world in which A does not exist, or simply true.\nThe first option corresponds to giving the apparent name wide scope\nwith respect to the logical operator, the second to giving it narrow\nscope. Such a scope ambiguity could not exist if\n‘A’ were a genuine Tractarian name, so its\npresence could reasonably be taken to signal the need for further\nanalysis. \nSo far, so good, but where does the business about the generality\nnotation “containing a prototype” come in? Nothing in the\npresent explanation has yet done justice to this remark. Nor does the\npresent explanation really pinpoint what it is that signals the need\nfor further analysis. That, at bottom, is the fact that we can imagine\ncircumstances in which the supposed referent of\n‘A’ fails to exist. So, again, there is reason to\nbe dissatisfied with this gloss on indeterminacy.  \nIt must be concluded that Wittgenstein never supplied an adequate way\nof recognizing when a proposition is fully analysed, and consequently\nthat he failed to specify a means for recognizing something as a\nTractarian object. \nWittgenstein’s turn away from logical atomism may be divided\ninto two main phases. During the first phase (1928–9),\ndocumented in his 1929 article “Some Remarks on Logical\nForm” (Klagge and Nordmann, 1993, 29–35), Wittgenstein\nexhibits a growing dissatisfaction with certain central details of the\nTractatus’s logical atomism, and notably with the\nthesis of the independence of elementary propositions. During this\nphase, however, he is still working within the broad conception of\nanalysis presupposed, if not fully developed, in the\nTractatus. The second phase (1931–2) involves a\nrevolutionary break with that very conception. \nThe so-called “colour-exclusion problem” is a difficulty\nthat arises for the Tractatus’s view that it is\nmetaphysically possible for each elementary proposition to be true or\nfalse regardless of the truth or falsity of the others (4.211). In\nview of its generality, the problem might more accurately be termed\n“the problem of the manifest incompatibility of apparently\nunanalysable statements.” The problem may be stated as follows:\nSuppose that a is a point in the visual field. Consider the\npropositions P: “a is blue at\nt” and Q: “a is red at\nt” (supposing “red” and “blue”\nto refer to determinate shades). It is clear that P and\nQ cannot both be true; and yet, on the face of it, it seems\nthat this incompatibility (or “exclusion” in\nWittgenstein’s parlance) is not a logical\nimpossibility. In the Tractatus Wittgenstein’s\nresponse was to treat the problem as merely apparent. He supposed that\nin such cases further analysis would succeed in revealing the\nincompatibility to be logical in nature: \nAs F. P. Ramsey observes in his review of the Tractatus\n(Ramsey, 1923), the analysis described here actually fails to\nreveal a logical incompatibility between the two statements in\nquestion; for, even granting the correctness of the envisaged\nreduction of the phenomenology of colour perception to facts about the\nvelocities of particles, the fact that one and the same particle\ncannot be (wholly) in two places at the same time still looks very\nmuch like a synthetic a priori truth. It turns out, however,\nthat Wittgenstein was well aware of this point. He knew that he had\nnot taken the analysis far enough to bring out a logical\ncontradiction, but he was confident that he had taken a step in the\nright direction. In a Notebooks entry from August 1916 he\nremarks that: “The fact that a particle cannot be in two places\nat the same time does look more like a logical impossibility\n[than the fact that a point cannot be red and green at the same time].\nIf we ask why, for example, then straight away comes the thought:\nWell, we should call particles that were in two places [at the same\ntime] different, and this in its turn all seems to follow from the\nstructure of space and particles” (NB, 81; emphasis\nadded). Here Wittgenstein is conjecturing that it will turn\nout to be a conceptual (hence, for him logical) truth about\nparticles and space (and presumably also time) that particles in two\ndistinct places (at the same time) are distinct. He does not yet\npossess the requisite analyses to demonstrate this conjecture, but he\nis optimistic that they will be found.  \nThe article “Some Remarks on Logical Form” (1929) marks\nthe end of this optimism. Wittgenstein now arrives at the view that\nsome incompatibilities cannot, after all, be reduced to logical\nimpossibilities. His change of heart appears to have been occasioned\nby a consideration of incompatibilities involving the attribution of\nqualities that admit of gradation — e.g., the pitch of\na tone, the brightness of a shade of colour, etc. Consider, for\nexample, the statements: “A has exactly one degree of\nbrightness” and “A has exactly two degrees of\nbrightness.” The challenge is to provide analyses of these\nstatements that bring out the logical impossibility of their being\ntrue together. What Wittgenstein takes to be the most plausible\nsuggestion — or at least a sympathetic reconstruction of it\n— adapts the standard definitions of the numerically definite\nquantifiers to the system described in the Tractatus,\nanalysing these claims as respectively:\n“∃x(Bx & A has x)\n& ~∃x,y(Bx & By\n& A has x and A has y)”\n(“Bx” means “x is a degree of\nbrightness”) and “∃x,y(Bx\n& By & A has x and A has\ny) & ~∃x,y,z(Bx\n& By & Bz & A has x\n& A has y & A has\nz).” But the suggestion will not do. The trouble is\nthat the analysis — absurdly — makes it seem as though\nwhen something has just one degree of brightness there could be a\nsubstantive question about which (if any) of the three mentioned in\nthe analysis of the second claim— x or y or\nz — it was—as if a degree of brightness were a\nkind of corpuscle whose association with a thing made it bright (cf.\nKlagge and Nordmann, 33). Wittgenstein concludes that the independence\nof elementary propositions must be abandoned and that terms for real\nnumbers must enter into atomic propositions, so that the impossibility\nof something’s having both exactly one and exactly two degrees\nof brightness emerges as an irreducibly mathematical impossibility.\nThis, in turn, contradicts the Tractatus’s idea that\nall necessity is logical necessity (6.37).  \nWittgenstein differs from Frege and Russell in denying that the\nsymbols for generality have meaning in isolation. Instead, the\nTractatus treats them as incomplete symbols to be analysed\naway according to the following schemata: \nUniversal (existential) quantification is treated as equivalent to a\npossibly infinite conjunction (disjunction) of propositions.\nWittgenstein’s dissatisfaction with this view is expressed most\nclearly in G. E. Moore’s notes of Wittgenstein’s lectures\nfrom Michaelmas term 1932. \n(∃x).fx = [logical] sum, fa ∨\nfb ∨ fc… \nThis is wrong, but not as absurd as it looks. (entry for 25 November,\n1932, Stern et. al., 2016,\n 215)[10].\n  \nExplaining why the Tractatus’s analysis of generality\nis not palpably absurd, Wittgenstein says:  \nClearly, in the Tractatus Wittgenstein was not making the\nsimple-minded mistake of forgetting that “Every F is\nG” cannot be analysed as “Ga &\nGb & Gc…” even when a,\nb, c, etc. are in fact the only Fs.\n(Unfortunately, his claim that he registered this point in the\nTractatus is not borne out by the text). His idea was rather\nthat the Tractatus’s analysis of generality is offered\nonly for the special case in which a, b, c,\netc, are “individuals” in Russell’s sense.\nWittgenstein had supposed that in this case there is no proposition to\nexpress the supplementary clause that is needed in the other cases.\nUnfortunately, Wittgenstein does not explain why there should be no\nsuch proposition, but the answer seems likely to be the following:\nWhat we are assumed to be analysing is actually “Everything is\nG.” In this case any allegedly necessary competing\nclause — for example, “a, b, c\netc., are the only things” (that is, Tractarian\nobjects) — would just be a nonsense-string produced in the\nmisfired attempt to put into words something that is shown by\nthe fact that when analysis bottoms out it yields as names only such\nas figure in the conjunction “Ga & Gb\n& Gc…” (cf. Tractatus 4.1272). \nWhat led Wittgenstein to abandon the Tractatus’s\nanalysis of generality was his realization that he had failed\nadequately to think through the infinite case. He had proceeded as\nthough the finite case could be used as a way of thinking about the\ninfinite case, the details of which could be sorted out at a later\ndate. By 1932 he had come to regard this attitude as mistaken. The\npoint is made in a passage from the Cambridge Lectures whose\nmeaning can only be appreciated after some preliminary explanation.\nThe passage in question makes a crucial claim about something\nWittgenstein refers to as “The Proposition”. By this\nphrase in this context he means the joint denial of all the\npropositions that are values of the propositional function\n“x is in this room”. This proposition can be\nwritten:  \nHis point is that the Proposition does not, despite appearances,\nexpress a logical product. It rather, he now seems to be saying,\nexpresses something like an indefinitely extensible process.\nWittgenstein came to see his earlier hope that it did express a\nlogical product rested on the mistake of confusing “dots of\ninfinitude” with “dots of laziness.”. The upshot\ncould scarely be more important: if Wittgenstein is right, the\nTractatus’s very conception of the general form of the\nproposition, because it makes essential appeal to the idea of the\njoint denial of arbitrarily many values of a propositional function,\nis itself infected with confusion. \nWittgenstein, however, does not think that the confusion of kinds of\ndots was the deepest mistake he made in the Tractatus. Beyond\nthis: “There was a deeper mistake — confusing logical\nanalysis with chemical analysis. I thought\n‘(∃x)fx’ is a definite\nlogical sum, only I can’t at the moment tell you which”\n(November 25, 1932, ibid.; cf. PG, 210). Wittgenstein had\nsupposed that there was a fact of the matter — unknown, but in\nprinciple knowable — about which logical sum\n“(∃x).fx” is equivalent to. But\nbecause he had failed to specify the analytical procedure in full\ndetail, and because he had not adequately explained what analysis is\nsupposed to preserve, this idea was unwarranted. Indeed, it\nexemplified an attitude he was later to characterize as amounting to a\nkind of unacceptable “dogmatism” (WWK, 182).","contact.mail":"iproops@austin.utexas.edu","contact.domain":"austin.utexas.edu"}]
