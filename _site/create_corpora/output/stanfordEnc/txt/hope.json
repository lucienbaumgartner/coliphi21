However, even though hope has\nhistorically only rarely been discussed systematically—with\nimportant exceptions, such as Aquinas, Bloch and Marcel—almost\nall major philosophers acknowledge that hope plays an important role\nin regard to human motivation, religious belief or politics.\nHistorically, discussions of the importance of hope were often\nembedded in particular philosophical projects. More recent discussions\nof hope provide independent accounts of its nature and its relation to\nother mental phenomena, such as desire, intention and optimism.\n\nCompared with more widely discussed attitudes like beliefs and\ndesires, the phenomenon of hope presents some unique challenges for\nboth theories of the mind and theories of value. Hope is not only an\nattitude that has cognitive components—it is responsive to facts\nabout the possibility and likelihood of future events. It also has a\nconative component—hopes are different from mere expectations\ninsofar they reflect and draw upon our desires. A classic analysis of\nhope—the so called “standard account” (see\n section 3)—takes\n hope to be a compound attitude, consisting of a desire for an outcome\nand a belief in that outcome’s possibility. But not all outcomes\nthat we believe to be possible and that we desire are thereby objects\nof our hope. In order to hope one not only has to consider an outcome\npossible, one also has to affectively engage with this outcome in a\ndistinctive way. This raises the question as to whether hope can be\nreduced to beliefs and desires. \nPopular discourse often takes hope to be synonymous with optimism. But\nwhile optimism can be usefully analyzed as a desire for an outcome\ntogether with a belief that the outcome is more likely than not (or\nmore likely than the evidence leads other people to believe), many\nphilosophers argue that hope, properly understood, is independent of\nprobability assessments (see section\n3). One can hope for outcomes that one considers to be very\nunlikely and that one does not expect to happen, such as a miraculous\ncure of an illness. In such cases, optimism is not an appropriate\nresponse. \nIt is an open question whether the contribution of hope to human\nagency is to be identified with that of the underlying desires or\nwhether hope makes an independent contribution to motivation or\nreasoning. If one assumes that hope cannot make any independent\ncontribution to practical reasoning but still motivates, this raises\nthe suspicion that it distorts rational agency. While such an\nassessment can be found across the history of philosophy, many past\nand contemporary philosophers provide analyses of hope that add\nfurther elements to the belief-desire analysis and use these elements\nto explain why acting on one’s hopes is (sometimes)\nrational. \nHistorically, evaluations of hope change together with the prevailing\nview of the relationship between human action and the future. As long\nas the human condition is seen as essentially unchangeable, hope is\nmore often treated as arising from mere epistemic uncertainty and as\nhaving ambivalent effects on human happiness. In philosophical\ncontexts where either the possibility of a future life beyond this\nworld or the idea of human progress is emphasized, hope is more often\nseen as an appropriate and even virtuous attitude that enables humans\nto direct their agency towards these possibilities (see Miceli and\nCastelfranchi 2010). \nIn early Greek thought, hope is often seen as an attitude of those who\nhave insufficient knowledge or are easily swayed by wishful thinking.\nIt thus has a primarily negative reputation (Vogt forthcoming) as an\nattitude that (at least potentially) misleads actions and\nagents. Already Solon focuses on empty hopes (see Lewis 2006: 85;\nCaston and Kaster 2016). In the dialogues of Thucydides, it is\nsimilarly noted that those who hope typically have a poor\nunderstanding of their situation, fail to come up with good plans, and\nthings go badly for them in war (The Peloponnesian War,\n5.102–3, 5.113). A slightly more nuanced perspective is often\nseen to be reflected in Hesiod’s version of the tale of\nPandora. When all the evils had escaped from Pandora’s jar,\nfamously, only hope (elpis) remained (“Works and\nDays”, §90).  This seems to suggest that hope can also\nsustain human agency in the fact of widespread evil. It must be noted,\nhowever, that there are many competing interpretations of\nwhy elpis remained in the jar (Verdenius 1985): Was it to\nkeep hope available for humans or, rather, to keep hope from man? Is\nhope consequently to be regarded as good (“a comfort to man in\nhis misery and a stimulus rousing his activity”, Verdenius 1985:\n66) or as evil (“idle hope in which the lazy man indulges when\nhe should be working honestly for his living”, Verdenius 1985:\n66)? These different interpretations of Pandora’s myth are taken\nup throughout the history of Philosophy (especially among\nexistentialist authors, see\n section 2.5). \nIn the Timaeus, Plato also adopts a rather negative attitude\ntowards hope by recounting a myth according to which the divine beings\ngive us “those mindless advisers confidence and fear, (…)\nand gullible hope” (Timaeus, 69b). In the\nPhilebus, by contrast, he seems to also allow for a more\nfavorable view of the role of hope in human life. The relevant\ndiscussion of hope takes place in the context of an argument about\n“false pleasures”. Against Protarch’s objection that\nonly opinions can be true or false, but not pleasures, Socrates\ndevelops an analogy between opinion and pleasure (Philebus,\n36d). In this context, he describes “pleasures of\nanticipation”, that is, expectations of future pleasures, that\nare called hopes (Philebus, 39e3). As Frede (1985) argues, in\nthe case of such pleasures of anticipation what we enjoy at present is\nonly a thought. As there can be a discrepancy between the thought that\nwe enjoy and what is in fact going to happen, the pleasure can be\ntrue—in which case it seems appropriate to say that the\ncorresponding hope can be rationally endorsed—or false (Frede\n1985: 174f.). The Philebus also presents hope as essential to\nhuman agency: Plato seems to suggest that all our agential\nrepresentations are concerned with the future which connects them to\nhope (Vogt forthcoming). \nAnother ancient account which does not attribute a merely negative\nrole to hope is Aristotle’s whose treatment of hope in the\ncontext of his discussion of the virtue of courage has received some\nattention (Gravlee 2000; Lear 2008). On the one hand, Aristotle\ndescribes the relationship between hope and courage as a contrast. He\nidentifies two sources of hopefulness that are non-courageous: First,\nit is possible to be hopeful “at sea […] and in\ndisease”, but this hope does not involve courage, insofar as, in\nsuch situations, there is neither “opportunity of showing\nprowess” nor is death “noble” in these cases,\naccording to Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics 3.6, 1115a35ff.).\nSecond, one can be hopeful based on one’s experience of good\nfortune (Nicomachean Ethics 3.8, 1117a10ff.). In this case,\nthe belief in the probability of a good outcome is not well grounded,\nbut founded on mere induction. Both kinds of hopefulness that are\nnon-courageous. On the other hand, there is also a connection between\nhope and courage via the concept of confidence (Gravlee 2000). For\nexample, Aristotle says:  \nThe coward, then, is a despairing sort of person; for he fears\neverything. The brave man, on the other hand, has the opposite\ndisposition; for confidence is the mark of a hopeful\ndisposition (Nicomachean Ethics 3.7, 1116a2)  \nThus, even though not every hopeful person is courageous, every\ncourageous person is hopeful. Hopefulness creates confidence, which,\nif derived from the right sources, can lead to the virtue of courage.\nGravlee (2000: 471ff.) identifies two further considerations that are\nrelevant for hope’s value in Aristotle’s thought. First,\nhope underlies deliberation, which is needed for any exercise of a\nvirtuous disposition. Second, hopefulness is also presented as\nvaluable in its connection with youth and the virtue of\nmegalopsychia (high-mindedness): hopefulness spurs us to the\npursuit of the noble. \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, hope received a less favorable treatment by\nthe Stoic philosophers. In particular, Seneca emphasizes hope’s\nrelation to fear (an idea that is later taken up by Spinoza, see\n section 2.3):\n  \n[t]hey are bound up with one another, unconnected as they may seem.\nWidely different though they are, the two of them march in unison like\na prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to. Fear keeps pace with\nhope. Nor does their so moving together surprise me; both belong to a\nmind in suspense, to a mind in a state of anxiety through looking into\nthe future. Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead\nof us instead of adapting ourselves to the present. (Seneca, Letter\n5.7–8; in: 1969: 38) \nAccording to Seneca, we should avoid both fear and hope and instead\nfocus on the present and cultivate tranquility of the soul. \nWhile pre-Christian accounts see hope mostly as an attitude to reality\nthat is based on insufficient insight into what is true or good and\nthat can, therefore, contribute to virtuous action only accidentally,\nif at all. By contrast, Christian philosophers such as Augustine and\nThomas Aquinas analyze hope as one of the most central virtues of a\nbeliever: Hope, precisely in virtue of its capacity to justify action\nin a way which is not bound to knowledge, is a part of rational\nfaith. \nAlready in Saint Paul’s argument for the extension of the\nChristian community beyond the Jewish law, hope plays a central role.\nPaul states that we can only hope for what is uncertain (Romans 8:24;\nsee also Augustine, City of God, book XIX, §IV,\n1960:139). Nevertheless, such hope can be the product of the\nexperience of suffering, if this experience is seen through the lens\nof faith (Romans 5:3–5) and if the desire to be saved from this\nsuffering is supported by confidence in not being\ndisappointed. Instead of backward-looking law-conformity (associated\nby Paul with the Jewish faith), it is such forward-looking hope that\ncharacterizes the appropriate relation to God. As an illustration,\nPaul describes Abraham as “hoping against hope” (Romans\n4:18), emphasizing the way in which hope goes beyond the evidence. \nAugustine of Hippo discusses hope systematically in chapter two of his\nEnchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love (c. 420). Hope is there\ndistinguished from faith—which is also based on incomplete\nevidence—by two features: First, hope is necessarily directed to\nfuture events, whereas faith can also relate to past events (such as\nChrist’s resurrection). Second, hope only relates to what is\ngood for the hopeful person, whereas faith can also relate to what is\nbad (such as punishment for one’s sins). Finally, hope, faith\nand love are seen as interconnected—only if one loves the future\nfulfillment of God’s will and thus hopes for it, can one arrive\nat the correct form of faith (Enchiridion, II.7). As love\nprovides the normative outlook that underlies hope and faith (and\nthus, in some sense, the desire-component of hope), love is seen as a\nmore central virtue than hope (Enchiridion, XXX.114). \nThe hope for a life after death also plays an important role in\nAugustine’s political philosophy. In the City of God,\nAugustine distinguishes the actual earthly city from the heavenly city\nthat only exists in the hope placed in God (City of God, book\nXV, §XXI, 1966: 541)—the latter provides a reference point\nfor a Christian view of politics. Hope, however, not only provides for\na perspective on politics which surpasses the narrow perspective of\nclassical politics (Dodaro 2007), an appropriate theorizing of hope\nalso modifies the understanding of traditional political virtues, as\nit redirects their purpose from the earthly to the heavenly city. One\nexample of such a modification concerns punishment: through hope, a\nChristian statesman will redirect punishment away from an exclusive\nconcern with proportionality towards the potential reform of the\ncriminal (City of God, book V, §XXIV, 1963: 263). \nIn one of his letters to Macedonius, a public official, Augustine\nfinally emphasizes that the hope for a future life underlies all true\nhuman happiness, both on the level of the individual and of the state\n(Letter 155, Political Writings, §4–8,\npp. 91–94). Thus, hope is not just of concern for individual\nbelievers but also for statesmen that are concerned with collective\nhappiness, as paying attention to hope allows them to pursue a\npolitical constitution that allows true virtue of citizens to emerge\n(see also Dodaro 2007). \nWhile Augustine is more or less exclusively concerned with the\nsignificance of hope for our pursuit of a good Christian life, Thomas\nAquinas’ Summa theologiae contains a very extensive\ndiscussion of hope that also covers forms of hope that are not\nconnected to faith. As for the analysis of what hope is (as such,\nindependently from its theological significance), Aquinas argues that\nhope is one of the “irascible passions” (i.e., passions\nwhich counteract our immediate impulses, SsS III,26; ST I-II 40.1).\nHope, he argues, is always directed at a good that lies in the future.\nHowever, in contrast to mere desire, the objects of hope are unlikely\noutcomes or outcomes that are hard to achieve but which are\nnevertheless in the realm of possibility (ST I-II 40.1). As this last\npart requires a cognition of possibility, hope is also always partly\ngrounded in experience (ST I-II 40.5). \nRegarding the rationality of hope, Aquinas has a nuanced view. On the\none hand, he admits that a lack of experience can make one unaware of\nobstacles. This tendency (and drunkenness, ST I-II 40.6) can promote\n(irrational) hope. On the other hand, he assumes that hope can promote\nrational agency: as hope incorporates both knowledge of the possible\nand knowledge of the difficulties to reach the desired outcome, it can\nmotivate agents to devote energy to their activities. \nBecause of this ambivalence, hope in the ordinary sense is not a\nvirtue for Aquinas. As a passion, humans can display an excess and a\ndeficiency of hope (ST II-II 17.5); furthermore, passions are not\nvirtues by definition. This changes, however, as soon as we examine\ntheological hope, i.e., the hope we can put in God. First, as directed\ntowards God, such hope does not know any excess. Second, we cannot\nunderstand theological hope as a passion. We must analyze it as a\nhabit of the will. While hope as a passion can only be incited by\nsensible goods (and subsequently motivates action insofar the subject\ntakes herself to be capable to realize that good), we can also hope\nfor God’s assistance (ST II-II 17.1) in reaching eternal\nhappiness (ST II-II 17.2). As eternal life and happiness are not\nsensible goods, this kind of hope cannot be a passion but must reside\nin the will (ST II-II 18.1). Insofar it is a habit, hope is not under\none’s control but itself given by grace (ST II-II 17.1). From\nthis account, it follows that one cannot place one’s hope (in\nthis sense) in other people and one cannot hope, except indirectly,\nfor the happiness of others—one can only hope in God. \nBecause of these two features, hope is a theological virtue (ST II-II\n17.5; see also 1 Corinthians 13). While love (or charity) is directed\nto God for the sake of unity, faith and hope are directed towards God\nwith a view to some good to be obtained from that unity: faith relates\nto God as a source of knowledge, hope relates to God as a source of\ngoodness (ST II-II 17.6). \nThe rationality of theological hope can only be properly understood,\naccording to Aquinas when we acknowledge that hope has to be preceded\nby faith (which underlies the belief in the possibility of salvation),\nbut, given faith, hope for the good of salvation is rational. Despair,\nas caused either by the absence of faith or the desire to be saved, is\nsinful (ST II-II 20.1). As hope is, by definition, future-directed, it\nonly is possible for human beings who are uncertain of whether they\nare blessed or damned, whereas love can persist even after their\nultimate fate has been revealed (ST II-II 18.2–3). \nIn 17th and 18th-century philosophy, hope is\ndiscussed by most philosophers as a part of their general theories of\nmotivation and cognition and often discussed as a\n“passion”, i.e., as a fundamentally noncognitive attitude\n(even though it might have a belief-component). This implies a\nrejection of Aquinas’ division between different kinds of\npassions in favor of a moral psychology which classifies emotions and\ndesires together as passions that generate action, of which hope is\nusually conceived as a species. Almost all authors mentioned in the\nfollowing also embrace some version of the idea defining for the\n“standard account” that hope is based on uncertainty in\nbelief together with a representation of an object as desirable. As a\nresult, hope is seen by most philosophers in this period (with the\nexception of Spinoza) as a motivating factor in human agency that is\nneutral, as it can lead to both rational and irrational action. \nAccording to René Descartes, hope is a weaker form of\nconfidence (Passions of the Soul, [1649] 1985: 389) and\nconsists in a desire (a representation of an outcome to be both good\nfor us and possible) together with a disposition to think of it as\nlikely but not certain (Passions of the Soul, [1649] 1985:\n350f, 389). This means that hope and anxiety always accompany each\nother (in contrast to both despair and confidence which are absolute\nopposites). Hope also underlies the more complex passions of boldness\nand courage (Descartes [1649] 1985: 391). While hope for the approval\nof others can move us to virtue and thus be commendable (Descartes\n[1649] 1985: 401), it is, like all passions, a product of the\nmovements of the “spirits” and thus not completely under\nthe control of our soul (Descartes [1649] 1985: 345) which means that\nit may work against the good of the soul-body union. \nThomas Hobbes adopts a similar analysis. For him, hope is a complex\npassion or a “pleasure of the mind”, i.e., a pleasure that\narises not from direct sensation but from thinking. For Hobbes, the\nsimplest building block underlying hope is appetite, and\n“appetite with an opinion of obtaining” is hope\n(Leviathan, 36, I.VI.14). As in Descartes, hope serves as a\nbuilding block for more complex mental phenomena, such as courage or\nconfidence (Leviathan, 36f, I.VI.17/19). But hope also plays\na role in the mental activity of deliberation which is defined as the\nalternation of hope and fear with appetites and aversion\n(Leviathan, 39, I.VI.49). Hope—a term which Hobbes\noften uses more or less synonymously with (justified)\nexpectation—plays an important role in the political application\nof his moral psychology: not only is the equality in the state of\nnature defined as an equality of hope (Leviathan, 83,\nI.XIII.3)—which makes it rational for everyone to pursue their\nindividual advantage—the laws of nature also command one to seek\npeace where one has hope for obtaining it (Leviathan, 87,\nI.XIV.4). Both the collective agency problem in the state of nature\nand the solution to it thus depend on what hopes individuals can\nrationally entertain. \nBaruch de Spinoza defines the passion of hope as a form of pleasure\n(Ethics III, P18, Spinoza [1677] 1985: 505) or joy that is\nmingled with sadness (due to the uncertainty of the outcome, see\nShort Treatise, book II, ch. IX, Spinoza [c. 1660] 1985: 113).\nIn contrast to more modern definitions, Spinoza distinguishes the\npleasure that is involved in hope from desire. Hope (in the\nEthics) is thus not necessarily connected to desire, but\nrather a way in which the mind is affected by the idea of a future\nevent. \nIn contrast to Hobbes and Descartes, Spinoza understands hope as\nfundamentally irrational. He argues that it must be the result of\nfalse belief inasmuch as it does not correctly represent that\neverything is governed by necessity (Short Treatise, book II,\nch. IX, [c. 1660] 1985: 113). Additionally, in the Ethics,\nSpinoza describes hope as one of the causes of superstition,\nespecially as it is always accompanied by fear (Ethics III,\nP50, [1677] 1985: 521). Such fear necessarily precludes it from being\nintrinsically good (Ethics IV, P47, [1677] 1985: 573). This\nis also the reason why we should attempt to make ourselves independent\nfrom hope. \nSpinoza agrees with Hobbes, however, by ascribing political\nsignificance to hope. As he explains in the Theological-Political\nTreatise, the fact that men are governed by hope and fear makes\nthem easy victims of superstition and false belief\n(Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 389); however,\ngood laws can also take advantage of this and motivate people by\narranging outcomes such that they can be motivated by hope\n(Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 439). The same\nimportance he places on hope also underlies his social contract\nargument. Like Hobbes, he argues that the only reason why men remain\nfaithful to the social contract or to carry out the orders of a\nsovereign has to be found in their hope of obtaining a certain good\nthis way (Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 529).\nEven a people as a whole is always united by common hopes and fears\n(Political Treatise, [1675] 2002: 700), but hope rather than\nfear is dominant in the case of free peoples (ibid.).This\nleads Spinoza to proclaim hope and fear as the basis of political\npower in the Political Treatise ([1675] 2002: 686). \nDavid Hume’s account is another example of an analysis of hope\nas a passion, modified, however, by the specific approach he takes to\nhuman psychology. For Hume, hope is a “direct passion”\nthat is produced when the mind considers events that have a\nprobability between absolute certainty and absolute impossibility.\nHume describes probability-beliefs as an effect of the mind\nentertaining contrary views—of an event or object as either\nexistent or nonexistent—in quick succession after another. Each\nof these views gives rise to either joy or sorrow (when the object is\nsomething good or bad) which linger longer in the mind than the\noriginal imagination of the object’s existence or non-existence.\nWhen considering objects that are probable, but not certain, the mind\nis thus affected by a mixture of joy and sorrow that, depending on the\npredominant element, can be called hope or fear.  \nIt is after this manner that hope and fear arise from the different\nmixture of these opposite passions of grief and joy, and from their\nimperfect union and conjunction. (Treatise, [1738] 2007: 283)\n \nAs Hume sees hope as a necessary effect of the consideration of an\nuncertain event, it follows that we cannot but hope for any positive\noutcome about which we are uncertain. The uncertainty in question can\nbe based on the actual uncertainty of the event but also on uncertain\nbelief. \nWhile hope is primarily discussed as a feature of the psychology of\nindividual humans in the 17th and 18th century\nand, as a noncognitive attitude, taken to be neither essentially\nrational nor irrational, it is given much greater significance by\nImmanuel Kant who adopts a much more substantial (and complex) view of\nthe connection between hope and reason, not only allowing for\nreasonable hope but even for hope as something which might be\nrationally demanded in certain contexts. \nKant’s definition of hope as “unexpected offering of the\nprospect of immeasurable good fortune” (AE 7:255) in the\nAnthropology still seems to remain within the traditional\ndiscourse about hope. However, Kant eventually promotes hope to occupy\na central place in his philosophical system by focusing on hope as an\nattitude that allows human reason to relate to those questions which\ncannot be answered by experience. In the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant states the question “For what may I\nhope?” as one of the fundamental questions of philosophy, after\n“What can I know?” and “What should I do?”\n(A805/B833). This question, as far as its answer depends on claims regarding the\nconsequences of moral righteousness and the existence of God, is\n“simultaneously practical and theoretical” (A805/B833) and\nit is answered by religion (AE 9:25). Kant’s account of hope\nconsequently connects his moral philosophy with his views on religion.\nHe emphasizes the rational potential of such hope, but he also makes\nclear that rational hope is intimately connected to religious faith,\ni.e., the belief in god. \nKant considers three primary objects of hope in his writings: (1)\nOne’s own happiness (as part of the highest good), (2)\none’s own moral progress (in the Religion) and (3) the\nmoral improvement of the human race as a whole.  \n(1) In the Canon of the Critique of Pure Reason,\nKant states clearly: “all hope concerns happiness”\n(A805/B833). However, it is not the hope for one’s own happiness\nsimpliciter that is at stake, but the hope for happiness that\none deserves because of one’s moral conduct (A809/B837). Kant\nargues that there is a necessary connection between the moral\nlaw and the hope for happiness. However, this connection exists only\n“in the idea of pure reason”, not in nature (A809/B837). A\nproportionality between happiness and morality can only be thought of\nas necessary in an intelligible, moral world, where we abstract from\nall hindrances to moral conduct. In the empirical world of experience,\nthere is no guarantee for a necessary connection between moral conduct\nand happiness. Thus, Kant concludes, we may reasonably hope for\nhappiness in proportion to morality only if we introduce the\nadditional non-empirical assumption of “a highest reason, which\ncommands in accordance with moral laws, as […] the cause of\nnature” (A810/B838). This way, Kant connects morality and\nhappiness in the object of hope and secures its possibility in a\nhighest reason, i.e., in god. Kant calls the connection between\n“happiness in exact proportion with the morality of rational\nbeings, through which they are worthy of it” the highest\ngood (A814/B842). A peculiarity of Kant’s treatment of hope\nin the Canon is that hope for the highest good is apparently\nconsidered necessary for moral motivation (A813/B841)—a thesis\nhe rejects in his later writings. \nKant’s account of hope for happiness presents hope as very\nclosely connected to Kant’s concept of faith. This becomes\nobvious in the Critique of Practical Reason. Kant argues that\nin order to believe in the possibility of the highest good—and\nwe have to believe in this possibility, as it is prescribed by the\ncategorical imperative—we have to believe in or\npostulate the existence of god and immortality of the soul.\nKant himself uses both the concept of belief or faith and the\nconcept of hope in explaining the content of the postulate of\nimmortality: we must presuppose immortality in order to\nconceive of the highest good as “practically possible” and\nwe may therefore “hope for a further uninterrupted continuance\nof this [moral] progress, however long his existence may last, even\nbeyond this life” (AE 5:123). Thus, Kant can be understood as\narguing in favor of a traditional religious form of hope—hope\nfor a life after death or immortality of the soul. However, he points\nout that immortality is not a ‘mere’ hope (i.e., a hope\nfor an outcome where we lack evidence for the claim that it is really\npossible), but that reason makes it necessary (as a consequence of the\ncategorical imperative) to assume that immortality is possible. This\nclaim that it is rationally necessary to assume something seems to be\nstronger than the claim that we may (or even must) hope for it. \nWhereas some Kant interpreters do not clearly distinguish between hope\nand faith (Rossi 1982, Flikschuh 2010), Andrew Chignell emphasizes\nthat hope is an attitude that is distinct from faith or belief and\nthat Kant follows an “assert-the-stronger” policy: he\nasserts the strongest justified attitude towards p (justified\nbelief), even if one holds also weaker attitudes towards p\n(hope) (Chignell 2013: 198). O’Neill interprets Kant as\nholding that hope provides a reason for religious belief:\nBelief in God and immortality is not “merely possible”,\nbut a matter of “taking a hopeful view of human destiny”\n(O’Neill 1996: 281). According to O’Neill, the reason for\nfaith is the hope that moral action is successful, i.e., that our\nmoral intention can make a difference to the natural order. \nAnother possible interpretation is that Kant uses “hope”\nto describe a certain kind of belief. Such a belief would refer to an\nobject that is theoretically possible, but in regard to which it is\nundecidable whether it exists and practically necessary to\nassume its existence. He holds that there can be practical (moral)\nreasons—that the highest good must be realizable—that make\nhope (for god’s existence and immortality) not only valuable and\nrational, but even rationally required. \n(2) In the Religion, Kant envisages one’s own moral\nprogress as an object of hope. He assumes that human beings have a\npropensity to evil, i.e., they occasionally prioritize maxims of\nself-love over moral ones (see AE 6:32). Consequently, our task as\nmoral agents is to perform a “revolution of the will” by\nadopting the moral law as one’s fundamental maxim. This\nrevolution is an object of hope: \nMan cannot attain naturally to assurance concerning such a [moral]\nrevolution… for the deeps of the heart (the subjective first\ngrounds of his maxim) are inscrutable to him. Yet he must be able to\nhope through his own efforts to reach the road which leads\nhither…because he ought to become a good man. (AE 6:46, see\nalso 6:48, translation from Kant [1793] 1960: 51) \nKant claims that this hope may include the hope for divine assistance\nin performing the revolution (AE 6:171). But if Kant is understood as\nclaiming that we require assistance from God in order to\nbecome morally good (Chignell 2013: 212ff.), this claim stands in\ntension with Kant’s fundamental assumption that human beings are\nfree and fully responsible for being good or evil. Chignell therefore\nproposes that Kant might  \nregard it as metaphysically possible for us to receive divine\nassistance in the intelligible realm while doing something for which\nwe are fully responsible. (Chignell 2013: 216) \n(3) In his political and historical writings, Kant considers another\nobject of reasonable hope: the hope for historical progress towards a\nmorally better, peaceful future. We find a similar relationship\nbetween rational belief and hope as with regard to God and\nimmortality: Kant sees the moral improvement of the human race both as\nan object of an assumption or rational belief, which\nis connected to a moral duty, and an object of hope (AE\n8:309). Similar to the objects of the practical postulates, God and\nimmortality, the assumption of moral improvement of the human race\ncannot be proven. Nevertheless, it is rational to believe or hope for\nit because it is a necessary presupposition for a moral duty (the duty\nto help morally improve the younger generation). Kant assigns\n“hope for better times” an important function for moral\nmotivation by claiming that without it, the desire to benefit the\ncommon good would “never have warmed the human heart” (AE\n8:309). Viewing human history with a “confirmation bias”\n(Kleingeld 2012: 175), i.e., with a view on the realization of moral\ndemands, encourages the attempt to fighting evils “instead of\nsuccumbing to despair” (ibid.). \nIndependently of these systematic issues regarding hope in\nKant’s philosophy, it is worth summarizing some general features\nthat Kant touches upon concerning hope. Regarding a\ndescriptive account of what it means that a person hopes that\np, one can extract two necessary conditions from Kant’s\nremarks that are in line with the standard account of hope: the object\nof hope must be uncertain, and the person must wish for it. Both\nconditions are can be found in the following passage from\nPerpetual Peace: \n[R]eason is not enlightened enough to survey the entire series of\npredetermining causes that foretell with certainty the happy or\nunhappy consequences of humankind’s activities in accordance\nwith the mechanism of nature (although it does let us hope that these\nwill be in accord with our wishes). (AE 8:370) \nIn regard to the normative conditions under which hope is\nrational, in Theory and Practice Kant claims that a\nparticular hope (or intention formed on the basis of hope) is not\nirrational as long as its object cannot be proven to be impossible (AE\n8:309f.). Besides this negative criterion, the main positive reason\nKant considers in favor of hope is that certain hopes are\n(necessarily) connected with a moral duty. Therefore, even though the\nthird question of philosophy is “For what may I\nhope?”, Kant in many passages discusses for what we\nmust hope (see O’Neill 1996: 285). \nIn Post-Kantian philosophy, the role of hope is disputed. One can\nidentify two more or less distinct approaches. On the one hand, there\nare authors like Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert\nCamus who reject hope, not so much as epistemically irrational but as\nexpression of a misguided relationship to the world that is unable to\nface the demands of human existence. On the other hand, authors like\nSøren Kierkegaard and Gabriel Marcel take hope to be a means to\novercome the limitations of ordinary experience. \nKierkegaard examines hope primarily as it is connected to religious\nfaith. However, whereas Kant aims to show that our belief in god and\nhope for the highest good is possible within the limits of reason,\nKierkegaard is keen to emphasize that (eternal) hope must transcend\nall understanding. As an antipode to despair, hope plays a positive\nrole in Kierkegaard’s work, culminating in his admonition:\n“a person’s whole life should be the time of hope!”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 251). In Works of Love, Kierkegaard\ndefines hope in its most general form as a relation to the possibility\nof the good: “To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility\nof the good is to hope” (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n249). \nMost interpreters of Kierkegaard emphasize a distinction between\n“heavenly” (or eternal) hope and “earthly” (or\ntemporal) hope (Bernier 2015; Fremstedal 2012; McDonald 2014). In some\npassages, Kierkegaard indeed seems to assume that there is also\n“natural hope” (Kierkegaard [1851] 1990: 82) or hope\n“for some earthly advantage” (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n261). However, strictly speaking, Kierkegaard considers this the\n“wrong language usage” (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 261). He\ncompletes his definition as follows: “To relate oneself\nexpectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which\ncannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). On Kierkegaard’s view,\nhope—strictly speaking—is thus always directed towards the\neternal, “since hope pertains to the possibility of the good,\nand thereby to the eternal” (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). This\nis connected to Kierkegaard’s account of time. Hope, as a form\nof expectation, is an attitude towards the possible. While\nexpectation, generally speaking, relates to the possibility of both\ngood and evil (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249), hope relates only to the\npossibility of good. The possibility of the good, on\nKierkegaard’s account, is a feature of the eternal (“in\ntime, the eternal is the possible, the future”). \nWhile the expectation of earthly goods is often\ndisappointed—either because it is fulfilled too late or not at\nall (Kierkegaard [1843–1844] 1990: 215)—eternal hope\ncannot in principle be disappointed (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n261–3, Kierkegaard [1843–1844] 1990: 216). Eternal hope\nmeans “at every moment always to hope all things”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). Kierkegaard mostly equates eternal\nhope with Christian hope (McDonald 2014: 164). \nIn order to understand the relation between earthly and heavenly hope,\nit is helpful to consider the dialectical progression of hope that\nKierkegaard presents in the Nachlaß (Malantschuk (ed.)\n1978: 247). There is a kind of hope that occurs spontaneously in\nyouth, which appears to be a pre-reflexive hope, a kind of immediate\ntrust or confidence (Fremstedal 2012: 52). It is followed by the\n“supportive calculation of the understanding”, i.e., by\nhope involving the reflection about the probability of the hoped-for\noutcome. This (earthly) hope is often disappointed by the lateness or\nnon-arrival of the expected goods. This disappointment is necessary in\norder to acquire eternal hope, which “is against hope, because\naccording to that purely natural hope there was no more hope;\nconsequently this hope is against hope” (Kierkegaard [1851]\n1990: 82).  Kierkegaard’s interpretation of Abraham’s\nstory in\nFear and Trembling can be understood as illustration of this\nkind of hope (Lippitt 2015). \nWhereas earthly hope is judged by the understanding according to its\nprobability, eternal hope exceeds the limits of understanding. It is\ntherefore commonly judged as irrational or as “lunacy”\n(Kierkegaard [1851] 1990: 83). Kierkegaard does not explicitly take up\nthe question of when hope is rational—presumably because eternal\nhope exceeds reason—but he frames the question of good or bad\nhope in terms of “honor” and “shame”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260f.). He observes that a person who\nentertained an earthly hope that has not been fulfilled is very often\ncriticized as imprudent (or “put to shame” (Kierkegaard\n[1847] 1995: 260)) because this is supposed to show that she\n“miscalculated” (ibid.). Kierkegaard objects to this\nperspective of “sagacity” that judges hope only with\nregard to its fulfillment. Rather, we should pay attention to the\nvalue of the hoped-for ends (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 261). Eternal\nhope, on this account, “is never put to shame”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260, see also 263). Further, and in line\nwith the Christian tradition, he argues that the value of hope depends\non its relation to love: we hope for ourselves if and only if we hope\nfor others, and only to the same degree. Love  \nis the middle term: without love, no hope for oneself; with love, hope\nfor all others—and to the same degree one hopes for oneself, to\nthe same degree one hopes for others, since to the same degree one is\nloving. (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260) \nThus, similarly as in Kant’s account, one’s hope stands in\na proportional relationship with an ethical demand. However,\nKierkegaard does not see hope limited by our meeting an\nethical demand.  \nRather, Kierkegaard sees the proportional relation as determining\nwhether we are in fact hoping, and the actual degree of our\nexpectancy. Our hope for ourselves is only realizable in and through\nour hope for another. (Bernier 2015: 315) \nAs already mentioned, Schopenhauer represents the opposite approach in\npost-Kantian philosophy. Even though he holds that it is natural for\nhumans to hope (Parerga and Paralipomena II, 1851:\n§313), he also claims that we generally ought to hope less than\nwe are inclined to, calling hope a “folly of the heart”\n(ibid.). Ambivalent remarks concerning the value of hope (he\ninterprets Pandora’s box as containing all the goods,\nParerga and Paralipomena II, 1851: §200) can be found\nthroughout his writings, but on the whole, criticism prevails. There\nare two aspects to his critical evaluation of hope: hope’s\ninfluence on the intellect and its role for happiness. In\nSchopenhauer’s dichotomy of the will and the intellect, hope is\nan expression of the will or, more precisely, an inclination. One\nreason why hope is problematic with respect to its influence on the\nintellect is that it presents what we wish for as probable (The\nWorld as Will and Representation, vol. 2, [1818] 1958: 216,\n218). Schopenhauer concedes that hope sharpens our perception insofar\nas it makes certain features of the world salient. But he links this\nthesis to the stronger claim that hope may make it\n(often) impossible to grasp things that are relevant. Hope\nthus distorts cognition in a problematic way because it hinders the\nintellect to grasp the truth. However, Schopenhauer also concedes the\npossibility of a positive effect of hope, namely as motivation and\nsupport of the intellect (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 2, [1818] 1958: 221). \nWith regard to its contribution to personal happiness, Schopenhauer\nmentions a positive role of hope in his comparison of the life of\nanimals with that of humans. He states that animals experience less\npleasure than humans, because they lack hope and therefore the\npleasures of anticipation. But hope can not only lead to\ndisappointment when the hoped-for object is not realized, it can even\nbe disappointing when it is fulfilled if the outcome does not provide\nas much satisfaction as to be expected (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 2 [1818] 1958: 573). Schopenhauer also\ncriticizes Kant’s idea that we may hope for our own happiness in\nproportion to our moral conduct (the highest good). This conception of\nhope, according to Schopenhauer, leads Kant to remain implicitly\ncommitted to a form of eudaimonism (Basis of Morality II,\n§3, 34). \nThus, even though Schopenhauer occasionally hints at positive aspects\nof hope, his overall evaluation of hope is negative. This is\nconsistent with his view that life is filled with unavoidable\nfrustration and suffering, and that suffering can be reduced only by\ngetting rid of one’s desires. Ideally, this amounts to the\n“negation of the will to life” (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 1, [1818] 2010: 405). The “temptations\nof hope” (The World as Will and Representation, vol. 1,\n[1818] 2010: 419) function as obstacles for the negation of the will,\nwhereas hopelessness can help to transform one’s mind and\nacquire “genuine goodness and purity of mind” (The\nWorld as Will and Representation, vol. 1, [1818] 2010:\n420). Interestingly, Schopenhauer does have sympathies with the idea\nof salvation, which lies in the denial of the will (Schopenhauer\n[1818] 1958: 610), that is, he seems to subscribe to a kind of\ntranscendent hope for an end of all suffering (Schulz 2002: 125).\nEven though he does not say so, one could characterize his view as a\n“hope for the end of hope”. \nNietzsche is perhaps the most famous critic of hope in the\npost-Kantian tradition. In the third preface to Zarathustra,\nhe warns: “do not believe those who speak to you of\nextraterrestrial hopes!” (Zarathustra, [1883–85]\n2006: 6) Similarly, in Beyond Good and Evil (1886) he opposes\nall notions of hope “in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness\nand justice” (Beyond Good and Evil, [1886] 2008: 562).\nIn his interpretation of Pandora’s myth (Human, All Too\nHuman, 1878: §71), he calls hope\n“the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of\nman”. However, a closer look reveals that, outside of his\ncriticism of religious and metaphysical hopes, he also hints at a\npositive perspective on hope: “that mankind be redeemed from\nrevenge: that to me is the bridge to the highest hope and a\nrainbow after long thunderstorms” (Zarathustra,\n[1883–85] 2006: 77). Nietzsche counts hope amongst the\n“strong emotions” (Nietzsche [1887] 2006: 103), next to\nanger, fear, voluptuousness and revenge. Furthermore, he repeatedly\ncharacterizes hope using the metaphor of a rainbow: “hope is the\nrainbow over the cascading stream of life” [“Die Hoffnung\nist der Regenbogen über den herabstürzenden jähen Bach\ndes Lebens”] (as cited in Bidmon 2016: 188). However, the\nmetaphor of the “rainbow” is ambivalent. On the one hand,\nit is connected to Nietzsches vision of the “overman”:\n“Do you not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the\noverman?” (Zarathustra, [1883–85] 2006: 36). On\nthe other hand, however, the rainbow is elusive and withdraws\nitself—Nietzsche calls it an “illusory bridge”\n(Zarathustra, [1883–85] 2006: 175; see also Bidmon 2016:\n188f.). In Beyond Good and Evil, he finally claims that we\nshould “fix our hopes” in “new philosophers”,\n“in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite\nestimates of value” (Beyond Good and Evil, [1886] 2008:\n600). In Human all too human, he similarly envisages change\nof the social order as an object of hope:  \n[W]e are only reasonably entitled to hope when we believe that we and\nour equals have more strength in heart and head than the\nrepresentatives of the existing state of things. (Human All Too\nHuman, 1878: §443)  \nReasonable hope is thus grounded in a trust in one’s capacity to\nbring about the desired outcome. However, Nietzsche adds that usually\nthis hope amounts to “presumption, an\nover-estimation” (ibid.). \nCamus follows Nietzsche in declaring (religious) hope the worst of all\nevils (Judaken and Bernasconi 2012: 264). His critique of hope is\nlinked to the idea that the human existence is\n“absurd”. The “elusive feeling of absurdity”\n(Camus 1955: 12) is characterized by a discrepancy: the human mind\nasks fundamental questions about the meaning of life, but “the\nworld” does not provide answers. Camus’ understanding of\nthe absurd is best captured in the image of Sisyphus, who exemplifies\nlife’s absurdity in his “futile and hopeless labor”\n(Camus 1955: 119). The assumption that life is absurd goes hand in\nhand with the denial of religious hope for salvation. In his early\nwriting Nuptials ([1938] 1970), Camus opposes religious ideas\nabout the immortal soul and hope for an afterlife. In fact,\n“[h]ope is the error Camus wishes to\navoid” (Aronson 2012). Even though Camus is often regarded as an\n“existentialist”, he distances himself from this\nmovement. One reason is precisely his disagreement with the account of\nhope of the existentialists, Kierkegaard in particular, of which he\nsays that “they deify what crushes them and find reason to hope\nin what impoverishes them.  That forced hope is religious in all of\nthem” (Camus 1955: 32). \nAs already mentioned, one kind of hope that Camus flatly rejects is\nreligious hope for a life beyond death. A second kind of hope,\nprimarily discussed in The Rebel, is the hope founded on a\ngreat cause beyond oneself, i.e., “hope of another life one must\n‘deserve’” (Camus 1955: 8). The problem with hoping\nfor social utopias, according to Camus, is that they tend to be\ndictatorial. A further reason to reject such hopes seems to be that\nthey distract from the life of the senses, from the here-and-now and\nfrom appreciating the beauty of this life. We also do not need hope to\ncope with the hardships of life and death: instead of hoping for a\nlife after death (or committing suicide), one should be conscious of\ndeath as “the most obvious absurdity” (Camus 1955: 59) and\n“die unreconciled and not of one’s own free will”\n(Camus 1955: 55). Sisyphus exemplifies the attitude of lucidity and\nconsciousness that Camus recommends. Even though he does not hope for\na better future,—or rather because he does not hope for\na better future—“[o]ne must imagine Sisyphus happy”\n(Camus 1955: 123). \nDespite his criticism of hope, Camus states that it is (nearly)\nimpossible to live without hope, even if one wishes to be free of hope\n(Camus 1955: 113). Presumably this claim is only descriptive,\nstating a fact about human psychology. However, in a letter to his\nfriend and poet René Char, Camus called The Rebel a\n“livre d’espoir” [book of hope] (Schlette 1995:\n130). On that note, it has recently been suggested that Camus allows\nfor a positive view of hope—a kind of “étrange\nespoir” [strange hope] that is directed towards the\npossibilities inherent in the present (Schlette 1995: 134) and that is\ncharacterized by humanism and solidarity with all human beings (Bidmon\n2016: 233). \nWhereas the positive role of hope in Camus is at best hidden, it\nsurfaces prominently in the writings of Marcel. At the heart of\nMarcel’s account of hope is the distinction between\n“‘I hope…’, the absolute statement, and\n‘I hope that…’” (Marcel [1952] 2010: 26).\nMarcel is mostly interested in a general, absolute hope, which he\nconceives as “the act by which […] temptation to despair\nis actively or victoriously overcome” (Marcel [1952] 2010:\n30f.). One way in which Marcel characterizes the “mystery”\n(Marcel [1952] 2010: 29) of hope is by alluding to the connection\nbetween hope and patience (Marcel [1952] 2010: 33). Hope implies the\nrespect for “personal rhythm” (ibid.) and\n“confidence in a certain process of growth and\ndevelopment” (Marcel [1952] 2010: 34). Marcel takes up the\nquestion of the rationality of hope in asking whether hope is an\nillusion that consists in taking one’s wishes for reality\n(Marcel [1952] 2010: 39). He answers that this objection against the\nvalue of hope applies primarily to hopes that are directed towards a\nparticular outcome (“to hope that X”), but it does not\napply when hope transcends the imagination. Because the person who\nhopes simpliciter does not anticipate a particular event, her\nhope cannot be judged with regard to whether it is likely to be\nfulfilled. Marcel illustrates this with the example of an invalid\n(Marcel [1952] 2010: 40). If this person hopes that he will be healthy\nat a certain point in time, there is the danger of disappointment and\ndespair if it does not happen. However, absolute hope, Marcel\nexplains, implies a “method of surmounting”: the patient\nhas true hope, if he realizes that “everything is not\nnecessarily lost if there is no cure” (Marcel [1952] 2010: 40).\nBeing a “theistic Existentialist” (Treanor and Sweetman\n2016) like Kierkegaard, Marcel ultimately connects this possibility of\nabsolute hope to the existence of god. Absolute hope is necessarily\nconnected to faith in God and is a “response of the creature to\nthe infinite Being to whom it is conscious of owing everything that it\nhas” (Marcel [1952] 2010: 41). \nEven though hope rarely features explicitly in pragmatist writings, it\nhas been suggested that pragmatist accounts of hope can be found in\nthe works of William James and John Dewey (Fishman and McCarthy 2007;\nGreen 2008; Koopman 2006, 2009; Rorty 1999; Shade 2001). As Patrick\nShade notes, the issue of hope is “implicit in most pragmatic\nphilosophies”, as it is related to central pragmatist topics,\nsuch as meliorism and faith, and particular hopes for social progress\n(Shade 2001: 9f.). \nIndeed, James’ concept of faith in The Will to Believe\nis closely linked to hope. In his essay, James aims to offer a\n“justification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a\nbelieving attitude in religious matters” (James [1897] 2015: 1).\nEven though his primary subject is religious faith, he points out that\na structural similar justification of faith or trust can be applied to\nsocial questions. It can be rational to believe that the other is\ntrustworthy or likes us, even though we may not be able to prove it.\nThree criteria have to be fulfilled for faith to be rational: the\nquestion cannot be decided scientifically, the belief may be true, and\nwe are better off (even now) if we believe. In his argument, James\ndraws a link to the concept of hope when claiming that the skeptic or\nagnostic attitude is not more rational than the attitude of faith. The\nskeptic holds “that to yield to our fear of its being error is\nwiser and better than to yield to our hope that it may be true”\n(James [1897] 2015: 27). James criticizes this attitude: “what\nproof is there that dupery through hope is so much worse than dupery\nthrough fear?” (James [1897] 2015: 27). \nIn Dewey’s writings, the topic of hope has been connected to his\naccount of meliorism (Shade 2001: 139). Meliorism is  \nthe idea that at least there is a sufficient basis of goodness in life\nand its conditions so that by thought and earnest effort we may\nconstantly make things better. (Dewey [1916] 1980: 294)  \nDewey distinguishes meliorism from optimism: Meliorism  \nattacks optimism on the ground that it encourages the fatalistic\ncontentment with things as they are; what is needed is the frank\nrecognition of evils, not for the sake of accepting them as final, but\nfor the sake of arousing energy to remedy them. (ibid.)  \nThe object of hope or meliorism, for Dewey, is first and foremost\ndemocracy, which is “the simple idea that political and ethical\nprogress hinges on nothing more than persons, their values, and their\nactions” (ibid.: 107). \nThe contemporary debate about hope in analytic philosophy is primarily\nconcerned with providing a definition of hope, explicating standards\nof rationality and explaining the value of hope. The debate takes as\nits starting point what has been called the “orthodox\ndefinition” (Martin 2013: 11) or the “standard\naccount” (Meirav 2009: 217), which analyses hope in terms of a\nwish or desire for an outcome and a belief concerning the\noutcome’s possibility. R.S. Downie is representative of this\nposition: \nThere are two criteria which are independently necessary and jointly\nsufficient for ‘hope that’. The first is that the object\nof hope must be desired by the hoper. […] The second […]\nis that the object of hope falls within a range of physical\npossibility which includes the improbable but excludes the certain and\nthe merely logically possible. (Downie 1963: 248f.) \nSimilarly, J. P. Day writes:  \n“A hopes that p” is true iff “A\nwishes that p, and A thinks that p has some\ndegree of probability, however small” is true. (Day 1969:\n89) \nThe desire-condition captures the fact that the subject is attracted\nto the outcome. Concerning the belief-condition, there is general\nagreement that we cannot hope for what we believe to be either\nimpossible or certain. For a\ndescriptive account of hope, only the belief of the\nhoping person about the possibility of the object is relevant,\nindependently of whether this belief is true: a person can hope for an\nobject she believes to be possible even if the object is in fact\nimpossible. While most accounts employ the idea that a hoping person\nholds a positive belief to the effect that the outcome is possible,\nthe most minimal position would require only the absence of\nthe belief that the outcome is impossible (or certain) (see Pettit\n2004: 153 for both formulations). \nMost authors implicitly assume that the hoped-for event is in the\nfuture. In ordinary usage however, people often express hopes\nregarding past events of which they do not have complete knowledge. An\nexample is the hope that someone did not suffer excessively\nwhen they died. While some authors consider this use of language to be\nparasitic on the future-directed case (McGeer 2004: 104), others argue\nthat these are genuine cases of hope (Martin 2013: 68). \nAnother question in this context concerns the concept of possibility\nthat is at issue: It seems clear that we cannot hope for the logically\nimpossible, but can we hope for the physically impossible, e.g., that\nthe dead will rise tomorrow? Downie, for example, holds that logical\npossibility is not enough (Downie 1963: 249), whereas Chignell\ndoes not exclude the possibility of hope for something which is\nphysically impossible (Chignell 2013: 201ff.). Whatever the answer to\nthis question, all views (except Wheatley 1958) allow for cases of\nhope in which the outcome is extremely improbable; in other words, no\nlower bound to the probability is required for hoping (Meirav\n2009: 219). \nSimilarly, few authors doubt that the desire and belief component to which\nthe orthodox definition refers are necessary conditions for hope (although\nSegal and Textor 2015 deny this). However, convincing objections have\nbeen raised against the idea that the standard definition provides\nsufficient conditions for hope. Ariel Meirav (2009) and Philip Pettit\n(2004) raise the most important objections. \nMeirav argues that the standard definition fails to distinguish hope\nfrom despair: two people can have identical desires and beliefs about\nthe possibility of an outcome, and yet one of them may hope for the\noutcome while the other despairs of it. According to Meirav’s\n“External Factor Account” (Meirav 2009: 230), hope also\ninvolves an attitude towards an external factor (e.g., nature, fate,\nGod) on which the realization of the hoped-for end causally depends.\n“If one views the external factor as good, then one hopes for\nthe prospect. If one views it as not good, then one despairs of\nit” (Meirav 2009: 230). Meirav links this definition to a claim\nabout the rationality of hope: the rationality of hope depends on the\nrationality of the belief in the goodness of an external factor\n(Meirav 2009: 233). \nAnother concern is that the standard account fails to explain how hope\ncan have special motivating force in difficult circumstances,\nespecially when the probability of the desired outcome is low (Pettit\n2004; Calhoun forthcoming). This objection is based on the idea that\nhope is closely connected to our agency. Victoria McGeer claims that\neven in cases where we cannot bring anything about to promote the\nhoped-for end, hope is “a way of positively and expansively\ninhabiting one’s agency”, and our “energy is\n[…] oriented toward the future” (McGeer 2004: 104). In\norder to capture the motivating power of hope, Pettit distinguishes\nthe “superficial” kind of hope described by the orthodox\ndefinition from a more “substantial” hope (Pettit 2004:\n154). He construes substantial hope as acting on a belief that the\nagent does not really hold:  \nHope will consist in acting as if a desired prospect is going to\nobtain or has a good chance of obtaining, just as precaution consists\nin acting as if this were the case with some feared prospect. (Pettit\n2004: 158)  \nHowever, this definition seems to render hope an intrinsically\nirrational attitude because it appears to require the hopeful person\nto act as if she had a false belief. In typical cases, a\nhopeful person does not describe herself as acting as if the\nchances were higher, but as taking the chances as they are as\ngood enough to try (Martin 2013: 23). \nCheshire Calhoun argues that “in hope we live under some kind of\nas-if idea of the future”. Whereas Pettit suggests that act as\nif the prospect has a good chance of obtaining and Martin as if the\nprospect is merely possible, Calhoun argues that hope involves a view\nof the future in terms of success. The third component of hope besides\ndesire and belief, according to her, is “a phenomenological\nidea of the determinate future whose content includes\nsuccess.” This phenomenological idea, she argues, has\nmotivational effect independently of the agent’s desires. This\ncomponent is not a fully reason-responsive state, as it has\nnon-rational sources like habituation to success or failure. \nIn a recent proposal, Adrienne Martin aims to remedy the faults of the\nstandard definition in yet a different way and gives an account of\nhope’s rationality. Similar to Walker (Walker 2006: 48), Martin\nholds that hope should not be analyzed in terms of necessary and\nsufficient conditions, but rather as a “syndrome” with\nparadigmatic marks (Martin 2013: 62). These marks involve two more\nelements in addition to belief and desire or attraction: First, the\nagent must see or treat her belief about the possibility of the\noutcome’s occurring as licensing hopeful activities,\ni.e., as not advising against some specific activities. Second, the\nagent must treat her attraction to the outcome as a practical\nreason to engage in the activities characteristic of hope. Martin\ncalls her account the Incorporation Thesis, which refers to\nthe fact that the hoping person incorporates the desire-element into\nher rational scheme of ends. On Martin’s account, the\nrationality of hope is primarily a practical question. Whereas the\nattraction to the outcome is (on her view) not subject to rational\nnorms at all, the belief in the outcome’s possibility is\nresponsive to theoretical reasons pertaining to the possibility of the\noutcome. However, whether one sees the belief in the possibility as\nlicensing hopeful activities and, consequently, whether one takes\none’s attraction as a practical reason to engage in hopeful\nactivities is governed by norms of rational end promotion (Martin\n2013: 51). In this respect, her account is similar to Pettit’s\nposition, which emphasizes the instrumental value hope has for the\npursuit of our ends (Pettit 2004: 161). \nA further dimension of value is suggested by Luc Bovens’ (1999)\ntheory. He argues that in cases where hoping has no instrumental value\n(because we cannot contribute to bring about the desired state), hope\ncan still have intrinsic value. In Bovens’ view, this\nintrinsic value pertains to hope because hoping involves mental\nimaging. This characteristic of hope is responsible for its intrinsic\nvalue in three respects: First, hope has intrinsic value because\nmental imaging is pleasurable in itself (Bovens 1999: 675f.). Second,\nhope has epistemic value because it increases one’s\nself-understanding. Third, hope has intrinsic worth because it is\nconstitutive of love towards others and towards oneself, which are\nintrinsically valuable activities. It is in virtue of mental imaging\nthat hope is intimately connected to love, because spending mental\nenergy in thinking about the well-being of another person is\nconstitutive of loving her. \nAnother approach to the value of hope has been developed using the\nframework of virtue epistemology. Nancy Snow (2013) proposes three\nrespects in which hope can be understood as an intellectual virtue:\n(1) hope motivates the pursuit of epistemic ends such as knowledge;\n(2) hope imparts qualities to the epistemic agent, such as resilience,\nperseverance, flexibility, and openness, that further the successful\npursuit of those ends; and (3) hope functions as a kind of method in\nthe pursuit of intellectual projects. (For a critical assessment of\nSnow’s approach, see Cobb 2015.) \nIt must also be mentioned that the standard account does not exhaust\nthe meaning of “hope” as it has been treated in the\nphilosophical tradition, in particular as it does not allow for\nindeterminate hopes. For example, Marcel’s distinction between\n“hope that” and hope without a determinate object has\nrecently been taken up (with or without explicit reference to Marcel)\nby otherwise different accounts. Joseph Godfrey calls hope without\nobject “fundamental hope” and bases his account on an\nanalysis of Bloch, Kant and Marcel (Godfrey 1987). Patrick\nShade’s pragmatist theory distinguishes particular hopes and\nhopefulness as “an openness to possibilities that are meaningful\nand promising for us” (Shade 2001: 139). Jonathan Lear similarly\ndescribes “radical hope” as a sense of a future in which\n“something good will emerge” (Lear 2008: 94), even though\nall particular hopes were destroyed, and Matthew Ratcliffe takes such\nradical hope as an example for “pre-intentional hope”,\nwhich is  \na kind of general orientation or sense of how things are with the\nworld, in the context of which intentional states of the kind “I\nhope that p” are possible. (Ratcliffe 2013: 602) \nPsychologists and psychoanalysts have systematically investigated hope\nsince the 1950s (Frank 1968). In many of these first studies, hope was\nseen as a combination of the perception of an outcome as important for\nan agent to achieve and as having a certain probability (Stotland\n1969). While this\nunderstanding of hope deviates from the standard philosophical account\n(see section 3) by requiring a minimal probability, it continues to\nplay a major role in the current psychological literature. \nA very influential psychological approach to hope is Charles\nSnyder’s hope theory (for an overview, see Rand and Cheavens\n2009). Snyder defines hope as follows: \nWithin a goal-setting framework, we propose that there are two major,\ninterrelated elements of hope. First, we hypothesize that hope is\nfueled by the perception of successful agency related to goals. The\nagency component refers to a sense of successful determination in\nmeeting goals in the past, present, and future. Second, we hypothesize\nthat hope is influenced by the perceived availability of successful\npathways related to goals. (Snyder et al. 1991: 570) \nOn this basis, Snyder and others have developed a “hope\nscale” that measures several components of agency and pathways\nperception (ibid.). \nSeveral objections have been raised against this analysis of hope. One\nis that the “perception of agency” relates both to the\npast and the future and therefore measures a general trait of\nhopefulness rather than the hope for specific outcomes. As a response,\npsychologists have developed further “domain-specific”\nhope scales (Lopez et al. 2000: 61). A second question concerns the\nissue of whether Snyder’s definition of hope is sufficiently\ndistinct from optimism (see Miceli and Castelfranchi 2010; Aspinwall\nand Leaf 2002). Snyder wants to distinguish hope from optimism by\nlinking hope to beliefs about self-efficacy (Snyder 2002; Magaletta\nand Oliver 1999) and reserving the term “optimism” only\nfor generalized expectancies about positive outcomes. However, the\nordinary use of the term is better captured by the idea that hope can\nbe upheld even if one does not assign a high probability to the\noutcome. \nWhile the political importance of hope as a psychological state is\nacknowledged by pre-modern and modern philosophers and while religious hope for a\nlife after death is a major topic in medieval political philosophy,\nthe emergence of a modern worldview that conceives of history as\ncontingent and thus conceives of the future as a space for potential\nfundamental change, also changes the significance of hope. \nWhile this connection can be most clearly seen in Kant’s\nanalysis of the role of hope in our relation to human history (see\n section 2.4),\n Hannah Arendt makes a related point in passing in the Human\nCondition. According to Arendt, the “natality” of\nhuman beings allows them to make new beginnings in their actions and\nthus subvert the tendency of the public space to disintegrate into\nroutinized behaviour. Therefore, “natality” is a\nprecondition of genuine political action and a necessary condition for\nthe possibility of hope (Arendt 1958: 247). The capacity of hope and\nthe capacity to act politically are thus essentially intertwined. \nIn modern political philosophy, hope is significant for both the\nMarxist and the pragmatist-liberal (see\n section 2.6)\n tradition of thought. Both traditions have produced\nthinkers—Ernst Bloch and Richard Rorty, respectively—who\naccord hope a central place in their political thought. In\ncontemporary political philosophy, hope is not a central topic, but\nthere are interesting attempts to assess its significance for liberal\nideal and nonideal theory (see White 1991; Smith 2005b; Moellendorf\n2010). \nBloch‘s The Principle of Hope is certainly not only the\nmost radical attempt to build a critical political philosophy on a\nhighly unorthodox theory of hope, it also constitutes a decisive break\nwith standard analyses of hope found in the philosophical\ntradition. \nRegarding the nature of hope, Bloch argues that it has both an\naffective component (as the opposite of fear) and a cognitive\ncomponent (being the opposite of remembrance) through which it\nanticipates a state of affairs that not only does not yet exist, but\nthat also is not yet cognitively completely available to the subject.\nOn the affective side, Bloch describe affects as a subclass of drives\nwhich are the basic material of his (psychoanalytically inspired)\npsychology. In contrast to basic drives, affects are self-reflexive in\ntwo ways: when agents become conscious of their affects this can add\nto the motivating power of the latter (Fink-Eitel 1988: 323); and\nthrough the consciousness of its affects, the subject becomes also\ncapable of reflecting upon itself. Among the affects, we can\ndistinguish between “filled” emotions (which have as their\nobject something which is already completely available in the\nlifeworld of the agent) and “expectant emotions”\n(Erwartungsaffekte) that relate to something not yet\navailable, among them hope and fear. In this schema, hope is a\npositive expectant emotion (Bloch [1954–59] 1986: I:111), and in\ncontrast to the negative affects, to which we are subject\ninvoluntarily, it is something in regard to which we have a degree of\nfreedom. Bloch therefore claims that, as a free, future-directed form\nof anticipation, hope is the most human of all affects (Bloch\n[1954–59] 1986: I:74). \nIn regard to the cognitive component, Bloch describes hope as\nproviding new forms of access to reality in a way that defies short\nsummary. In general, however, one can say that hope is always related\nto the “not-yet-conscious” that in turn reflects\n“objective possibilities”. The terms “not-yet\nconscious” and “preconscious” (Bloch [1954–59]\n1986: I:115) are part of an oppositional reading of classic\npsychoanalysis that, according to Bloch, understands the unconscious\npredominantly as encompassing thoughts which are no longer\nconscious or repressed (ibid.), but neglects the possibility that some\nunconscious thoughts are not yet capable of being conscious. This also\nleads Bloch to introduce a future-directed counterpart to the concept\nof repression (Bloch [1954–59] 1986: I:128). Whereas repressed\nmemories are repressed by forces within the subject, resistance to\nnot-yet conscious thought is to found in the very material or content\nof that thought, namely objective, future possibilities—events\nor outcomes that are, by definition, not yet achieved and habitualized\nand thus not available in the lifeworld for the subject’s\nconceptualization. This resistance to conscious reflection is also\nalways partly due to socio-economic causes; not all projects are\nequally achievable in all historical moments and thus their becoming\nfully available to consciousness is blocked by their (present)\nimpossibility (Bloch [1954–59] 1986: I:130). \nThe content or material of the not-yet-conscious is defined by what\nBloch calls the “Front”. This concept is related to\nBloch’s processual metaphysics according to which objective\ntendencies and possibilities in reality interact with\n“closed” matters of fact, such that the moment of\npotentiality surpassing into actuality always opens up opportunities\nfor the interventions of active decision-making. The right way to\nrelate to these “Front” opportunities is, according to\nBloch, “militant optimism”, i.e., not a mere assumption\nthat things will develop in a desirable direction, but an active\nrelation to real tendencies with the goal to realize them (Bloch\n[1954–59] 1986: I:201). \nArguing from these premises, Bloch develops an integrated theory in\nwhich hope is not merely a subjective combination of desires and\nbeliefs about probabilities or facts, but rather a reflection of\nmetaphysical possibilities in the world and part of a range of human\ncapacities that make it possible to relate to that which is not yet,\nbut which is already prefigured in the objective potentials of\nreality. In the Principle of Hope, Bloch offers a\nwide-ranging overview of historical and current forms in which hope,\noptimism and utopia have been and are captured by visions of potential\nstates of affairs—the list of topics discussed ranges from\nmedial representation of desires, social and geographic utopias to\nliterary and artistic ways in which the possible can be captured and\nphilosophical theories of the goods. \nThe theoretical framework in which these analyses are embedded and in\nthe service of which they are employed, is a revised form of Marxism.\nBloch’s Marxism relies on a dialectical materialism which has\ntwo aspects that Bloch calls the “cold” and the\n“warm stream”: the first designates the materialist\ninsight that all historical developments are conditioned and\nconstrained by concrete, existing material conditions, “strict\ndeterminations that cannot be skipped over” (Bloch\n[1954–59] 1986: I:208), whereas the second acknowledges the\nprocessual constitution of reality which is adequately captured by\nhope and expectation. On this version of Marxism, hope becomes a\ncentral element of the stance of the social theorist and critic. In\nparticular, Bloch understands Marx’s account of a unity between\ntheory and practice in the Theses on Feuerbach to suggest a\nsocial theory that occupies the “horizon of the future”\n(Bloch [1954–59] 1986: I:285) and a materialism which centrally\nintegrates hope. This materialism, Bloch argues in the final pages of\nThe Principle of Hope, can overcome the division between\npowerless fantasy and a mechanical determinism which underlies mere\npredictions of the future and guide political action that is directed\ntowards a real, material, objective possibility—classless\nsociety—which is, at the same time, still acknowledged to be\ndependent on human decision (Bloch [1954–59] 1986: III:1372).\nSuch activity, according to Bloch, must be guided by militant optimism\nor hope. Political hope is thus not only valuable, it is also\nnecessary to achieve social change for the better. \nWhile Rorty agrees with Bloch that hope, rather than knowledge about\nhistorical inevitability or moral truth, is an appropriate basis for\nprogressive political theory, the argument that he develops for this\nclaim could not be more different from the one Bloch advances. Whereas\nBloch tries to underpin both his descriptive analysis of hope and the\ndialectic materialism that is to guide political action with a\nmetaphysical vocabulary that aims to identify the ultimate reality to\nwhich hope refers, Rorty arrives at his endorsement of hope as an\nimportant element in contemporary liberal politics through a rejection\nof political models that are based on the idea of (perhaps privileged)\nknowledge or insight. \nIn Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, Rorty identifies hope\nas a central element of a hermeneutic rather than an epistemological\napproach to philosophy: \nHermeneutics sees the relations between various discourses as those of\nstrands in a possible conversation, a conversation which presupposes\nno disciplinary matrix which unites the speakers, but where the hope\nof agreement is never lost so long as the conversation lasts. This\nhope is not a hope for the discovery of antecedently existing common\nground, but simply hope for agreement, or, at least, exciting and\nfruitful disagreement. (Rorty 1979: 318) \nAs Rorty also emphasizes in later writings, this hope is not based on\nany foundations—such as knowledge about\nprobabilities—rather, it is an attitude by which interlocutors\nexpress both their commitment to certain forms of future interaction\nand their belief in its possibility. Although Rorty never provides a\nformal analysis of hope (the closest he comes to such a definition is\nhis approving reference to Dewey’s analysis of hope as\n“the ability to believe that the future will be unspecifiably\ndifferent from, and unspecifiably freer than, the past”, Rorty\n1999: 120), his use of the term is consistent with the standard\ndefinition. In this sense, “political deliberation presupposes\nhope” (Rorty 2002: 153). He adds to this definition an important\nethical component, however, insofar he focusses on forms of hope that\nconcern intersubjective interactions: to approach others with the hope\nfor agreement is an expression of the liberal virtue of civility\n(Rorty 1979: 318). \nThe concept of hope gradually becomes more important throughout\nRorty’s work. In Contingency, Irony and Solidarity,\nRorty contrasts two forms of liberalism: The “liberal\nmetaphysician” expects social cooperation to be based on\nscientific or philosophical insight that penetrates individual\nidiosyncrasy and aims at the adoption of a universal, final vocabulary\nthat then leads to solidarity. By contrast, the “liberal\nironist” renounces the idea of a final vocabulary. By\nacknowledging that only the contingent overlap between “selfish\nhopes” can be a source of solidarity (Rorty 1989: 93), a liberal\nironist also must give up the idea that there is something\nintrinsically, universally human that will provide a source of\nsolidarity. Instead, we have to engage in an attempt to create\nsolidarity out of shared experiences and interests (Rorty 1999:\n87). \nRorty sees the pragmatists, and Dewey in particular (see\n section 2.6),\n as the theorists who have best captured these different aspects of\nhope. On the epistemic dimension, they embrace a form of hope that\n“doesn’t need reinforcement from ‘the idea of a\ntranscendental or enduring subject’” (Rorty 1982: 206) or\n“backup from a philosophy of history” (Rorty 1998: 243).\nOn the political dimension, pragmatist experimentalism allows for\nliberal hope—a hope for a “global, cosmopolitan,\ndemocratic, egalitarian, classless, casteless society” (Rorty\n1999: xii)—without grounding it in a historical teleology or an\nabstract utopianism. This liberalism also succeeds in capturing the\nattractive aspects of both Christianity and Marxism without succumbing\nto their metaphysical vices. \nThe most interesting aspect of Rorty’s theory is that the main\nvirtue he ascribes to hope (compared to knowledge) as a basis for\npolitics is that it “does not require foundations” (Rorty\net al. 2002b: 58) , and certain hopes may even be\n“unjustifiable” (Rorty 1982: 208). As Nicholas Smith\n(2005a) notes, Rorty does not intend this to designate an unjustified\nhope (hope for which there is no adequate justification, although such\njustification is possible). Rather, he must either mean a form of hope\nfor which the question of justification does not arise or a form of\nhope that is strictly unjustifiable in the same sense as hope for the\nimpossible. While there are traces of the latter sense to be found in\nRorty’s work (Smith 2005a: 94), he consistently seems to use the\nformer meaning in his political writings. But the absence of a need\nfor a metaphysical justification of hope does not imply that we cannot\nmake a distinction between more or less reasonable forms of hoping. As\nSmith (2005a: 95) further argues, Rorty acknowledges that hopelessness\nis always based on the absence of a narrative of political progress.\nFor this reason, if such a narrative is available, this seems to\nprovide rational support for political hope.","contact.mail":"bloeser@em.uni-frankfurt.de","contact.domain":"em.uni-frankfurt.de"},{"date.published":"2017-03-08","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hope/","author1":"Claudia Bloeser","author1.info":"http://www.titus-stahl.de/","entry":"hope","body.text":"\n\n\nDiscussions of hope can be found throughout the history of philosophy\nand across all Western philosophical traditions, even though\nphilosophy has traditionally not paid the same attention to hope as it\nhas to attitudes like belief and desire. However, even though hope has\nhistorically only rarely been discussed systematically—with\nimportant exceptions, such as Aquinas, Bloch and Marcel—almost\nall major philosophers acknowledge that hope plays an important role\nin regard to human motivation, religious belief or politics.\nHistorically, discussions of the importance of hope were often\nembedded in particular philosophical projects. More recent discussions\nof hope provide independent accounts of its nature and its relation to\nother mental phenomena, such as desire, intention and optimism.\n\nCompared with more widely discussed attitudes like beliefs and\ndesires, the phenomenon of hope presents some unique challenges for\nboth theories of the mind and theories of value. Hope is not only an\nattitude that has cognitive components—it is responsive to facts\nabout the possibility and likelihood of future events. It also has a\nconative component—hopes are different from mere expectations\ninsofar they reflect and draw upon our desires. A classic analysis of\nhope—the so called “standard account” (see\n section 3)—takes\n hope to be a compound attitude, consisting of a desire for an outcome\nand a belief in that outcome’s possibility. But not all outcomes\nthat we believe to be possible and that we desire are thereby objects\nof our hope. In order to hope one not only has to consider an outcome\npossible, one also has to affectively engage with this outcome in a\ndistinctive way. This raises the question as to whether hope can be\nreduced to beliefs and desires. \nPopular discourse often takes hope to be synonymous with optimism. But\nwhile optimism can be usefully analyzed as a desire for an outcome\ntogether with a belief that the outcome is more likely than not (or\nmore likely than the evidence leads other people to believe), many\nphilosophers argue that hope, properly understood, is independent of\nprobability assessments (see section\n3). One can hope for outcomes that one considers to be very\nunlikely and that one does not expect to happen, such as a miraculous\ncure of an illness. In such cases, optimism is not an appropriate\nresponse. \nIt is an open question whether the contribution of hope to human\nagency is to be identified with that of the underlying desires or\nwhether hope makes an independent contribution to motivation or\nreasoning. If one assumes that hope cannot make any independent\ncontribution to practical reasoning but still motivates, this raises\nthe suspicion that it distorts rational agency. While such an\nassessment can be found across the history of philosophy, many past\nand contemporary philosophers provide analyses of hope that add\nfurther elements to the belief-desire analysis and use these elements\nto explain why acting on one’s hopes is (sometimes)\nrational. \nHistorically, evaluations of hope change together with the prevailing\nview of the relationship between human action and the future. As long\nas the human condition is seen as essentially unchangeable, hope is\nmore often treated as arising from mere epistemic uncertainty and as\nhaving ambivalent effects on human happiness. In philosophical\ncontexts where either the possibility of a future life beyond this\nworld or the idea of human progress is emphasized, hope is more often\nseen as an appropriate and even virtuous attitude that enables humans\nto direct their agency towards these possibilities (see Miceli and\nCastelfranchi 2010). \nIn early Greek thought, hope is often seen as an attitude of those who\nhave insufficient knowledge or are easily swayed by wishful thinking.\nIt thus has a primarily negative reputation (Vogt forthcoming) as an\nattitude that (at least potentially) misleads actions and\nagents. Already Solon focuses on empty hopes (see Lewis 2006: 85;\nCaston and Kaster 2016). In the dialogues of Thucydides, it is\nsimilarly noted that those who hope typically have a poor\nunderstanding of their situation, fail to come up with good plans, and\nthings go badly for them in war (The Peloponnesian War,\n5.102–3, 5.113). A slightly more nuanced perspective is often\nseen to be reflected in Hesiod’s version of the tale of\nPandora. When all the evils had escaped from Pandora’s jar,\nfamously, only hope (elpis) remained (“Works and\nDays”, §90).  This seems to suggest that hope can also\nsustain human agency in the fact of widespread evil. It must be noted,\nhowever, that there are many competing interpretations of\nwhy elpis remained in the jar (Verdenius 1985): Was it to\nkeep hope available for humans or, rather, to keep hope from man? Is\nhope consequently to be regarded as good (“a comfort to man in\nhis misery and a stimulus rousing his activity”, Verdenius 1985:\n66) or as evil (“idle hope in which the lazy man indulges when\nhe should be working honestly for his living”, Verdenius 1985:\n66)? These different interpretations of Pandora’s myth are taken\nup throughout the history of Philosophy (especially among\nexistentialist authors, see\n section 2.5). \nIn the Timaeus, Plato also adopts a rather negative attitude\ntowards hope by recounting a myth according to which the divine beings\ngive us “those mindless advisers confidence and fear, (…)\nand gullible hope” (Timaeus, 69b). In the\nPhilebus, by contrast, he seems to also allow for a more\nfavorable view of the role of hope in human life. The relevant\ndiscussion of hope takes place in the context of an argument about\n“false pleasures”. Against Protarch’s objection that\nonly opinions can be true or false, but not pleasures, Socrates\ndevelops an analogy between opinion and pleasure (Philebus,\n36d). In this context, he describes “pleasures of\nanticipation”, that is, expectations of future pleasures, that\nare called hopes (Philebus, 39e3). As Frede (1985) argues, in\nthe case of such pleasures of anticipation what we enjoy at present is\nonly a thought. As there can be a discrepancy between the thought that\nwe enjoy and what is in fact going to happen, the pleasure can be\ntrue—in which case it seems appropriate to say that the\ncorresponding hope can be rationally endorsed—or false (Frede\n1985: 174f.). The Philebus also presents hope as essential to\nhuman agency: Plato seems to suggest that all our agential\nrepresentations are concerned with the future which connects them to\nhope (Vogt forthcoming). \nAnother ancient account which does not attribute a merely negative\nrole to hope is Aristotle’s whose treatment of hope in the\ncontext of his discussion of the virtue of courage has received some\nattention (Gravlee 2000; Lear 2008). On the one hand, Aristotle\ndescribes the relationship between hope and courage as a contrast. He\nidentifies two sources of hopefulness that are non-courageous: First,\nit is possible to be hopeful “at sea […] and in\ndisease”, but this hope does not involve courage, insofar as, in\nsuch situations, there is neither “opportunity of showing\nprowess” nor is death “noble” in these cases,\naccording to Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics 3.6, 1115a35ff.).\nSecond, one can be hopeful based on one’s experience of good\nfortune (Nicomachean Ethics 3.8, 1117a10ff.). In this case,\nthe belief in the probability of a good outcome is not well grounded,\nbut founded on mere induction. Both kinds of hopefulness that are\nnon-courageous. On the other hand, there is also a connection between\nhope and courage via the concept of confidence (Gravlee 2000). For\nexample, Aristotle says:  \nThe coward, then, is a despairing sort of person; for he fears\neverything. The brave man, on the other hand, has the opposite\ndisposition; for confidence is the mark of a hopeful\ndisposition (Nicomachean Ethics 3.7, 1116a2)  \nThus, even though not every hopeful person is courageous, every\ncourageous person is hopeful. Hopefulness creates confidence, which,\nif derived from the right sources, can lead to the virtue of courage.\nGravlee (2000: 471ff.) identifies two further considerations that are\nrelevant for hope’s value in Aristotle’s thought. First,\nhope underlies deliberation, which is needed for any exercise of a\nvirtuous disposition. Second, hopefulness is also presented as\nvaluable in its connection with youth and the virtue of\nmegalopsychia (high-mindedness): hopefulness spurs us to the\npursuit of the noble. \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, hope received a less favorable treatment by\nthe Stoic philosophers. In particular, Seneca emphasizes hope’s\nrelation to fear (an idea that is later taken up by Spinoza, see\n section 2.3):\n  \n[t]hey are bound up with one another, unconnected as they may seem.\nWidely different though they are, the two of them march in unison like\na prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to. Fear keeps pace with\nhope. Nor does their so moving together surprise me; both belong to a\nmind in suspense, to a mind in a state of anxiety through looking into\nthe future. Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead\nof us instead of adapting ourselves to the present. (Seneca, Letter\n5.7–8; in: 1969: 38) \nAccording to Seneca, we should avoid both fear and hope and instead\nfocus on the present and cultivate tranquility of the soul. \nWhile pre-Christian accounts see hope mostly as an attitude to reality\nthat is based on insufficient insight into what is true or good and\nthat can, therefore, contribute to virtuous action only accidentally,\nif at all. By contrast, Christian philosophers such as Augustine and\nThomas Aquinas analyze hope as one of the most central virtues of a\nbeliever: Hope, precisely in virtue of its capacity to justify action\nin a way which is not bound to knowledge, is a part of rational\nfaith. \nAlready in Saint Paul’s argument for the extension of the\nChristian community beyond the Jewish law, hope plays a central role.\nPaul states that we can only hope for what is uncertain (Romans 8:24;\nsee also Augustine, City of God, book XIX, §IV,\n1960:139). Nevertheless, such hope can be the product of the\nexperience of suffering, if this experience is seen through the lens\nof faith (Romans 5:3–5) and if the desire to be saved from this\nsuffering is supported by confidence in not being\ndisappointed. Instead of backward-looking law-conformity (associated\nby Paul with the Jewish faith), it is such forward-looking hope that\ncharacterizes the appropriate relation to God. As an illustration,\nPaul describes Abraham as “hoping against hope” (Romans\n4:18), emphasizing the way in which hope goes beyond the evidence. \nAugustine of Hippo discusses hope systematically in chapter two of his\nEnchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love (c. 420). Hope is there\ndistinguished from faith—which is also based on incomplete\nevidence—by two features: First, hope is necessarily directed to\nfuture events, whereas faith can also relate to past events (such as\nChrist’s resurrection). Second, hope only relates to what is\ngood for the hopeful person, whereas faith can also relate to what is\nbad (such as punishment for one’s sins). Finally, hope, faith\nand love are seen as interconnected—only if one loves the future\nfulfillment of God’s will and thus hopes for it, can one arrive\nat the correct form of faith (Enchiridion, II.7). As love\nprovides the normative outlook that underlies hope and faith (and\nthus, in some sense, the desire-component of hope), love is seen as a\nmore central virtue than hope (Enchiridion, XXX.114). \nThe hope for a life after death also plays an important role in\nAugustine’s political philosophy. In the City of God,\nAugustine distinguishes the actual earthly city from the heavenly city\nthat only exists in the hope placed in God (City of God, book\nXV, §XXI, 1966: 541)—the latter provides a reference point\nfor a Christian view of politics. Hope, however, not only provides for\na perspective on politics which surpasses the narrow perspective of\nclassical politics (Dodaro 2007), an appropriate theorizing of hope\nalso modifies the understanding of traditional political virtues, as\nit redirects their purpose from the earthly to the heavenly city. One\nexample of such a modification concerns punishment: through hope, a\nChristian statesman will redirect punishment away from an exclusive\nconcern with proportionality towards the potential reform of the\ncriminal (City of God, book V, §XXIV, 1963: 263). \nIn one of his letters to Macedonius, a public official, Augustine\nfinally emphasizes that the hope for a future life underlies all true\nhuman happiness, both on the level of the individual and of the state\n(Letter 155, Political Writings, §4–8,\npp. 91–94). Thus, hope is not just of concern for individual\nbelievers but also for statesmen that are concerned with collective\nhappiness, as paying attention to hope allows them to pursue a\npolitical constitution that allows true virtue of citizens to emerge\n(see also Dodaro 2007). \nWhile Augustine is more or less exclusively concerned with the\nsignificance of hope for our pursuit of a good Christian life, Thomas\nAquinas’ Summa theologiae contains a very extensive\ndiscussion of hope that also covers forms of hope that are not\nconnected to faith. As for the analysis of what hope is (as such,\nindependently from its theological significance), Aquinas argues that\nhope is one of the “irascible passions” (i.e., passions\nwhich counteract our immediate impulses, SsS III,26; ST I-II 40.1).\nHope, he argues, is always directed at a good that lies in the future.\nHowever, in contrast to mere desire, the objects of hope are unlikely\noutcomes or outcomes that are hard to achieve but which are\nnevertheless in the realm of possibility (ST I-II 40.1). As this last\npart requires a cognition of possibility, hope is also always partly\ngrounded in experience (ST I-II 40.5). \nRegarding the rationality of hope, Aquinas has a nuanced view. On the\none hand, he admits that a lack of experience can make one unaware of\nobstacles. This tendency (and drunkenness, ST I-II 40.6) can promote\n(irrational) hope. On the other hand, he assumes that hope can promote\nrational agency: as hope incorporates both knowledge of the possible\nand knowledge of the difficulties to reach the desired outcome, it can\nmotivate agents to devote energy to their activities. \nBecause of this ambivalence, hope in the ordinary sense is not a\nvirtue for Aquinas. As a passion, humans can display an excess and a\ndeficiency of hope (ST II-II 17.5); furthermore, passions are not\nvirtues by definition. This changes, however, as soon as we examine\ntheological hope, i.e., the hope we can put in God. First, as directed\ntowards God, such hope does not know any excess. Second, we cannot\nunderstand theological hope as a passion. We must analyze it as a\nhabit of the will. While hope as a passion can only be incited by\nsensible goods (and subsequently motivates action insofar the subject\ntakes herself to be capable to realize that good), we can also hope\nfor God’s assistance (ST II-II 17.1) in reaching eternal\nhappiness (ST II-II 17.2). As eternal life and happiness are not\nsensible goods, this kind of hope cannot be a passion but must reside\nin the will (ST II-II 18.1). Insofar it is a habit, hope is not under\none’s control but itself given by grace (ST II-II 17.1). From\nthis account, it follows that one cannot place one’s hope (in\nthis sense) in other people and one cannot hope, except indirectly,\nfor the happiness of others—one can only hope in God. \nBecause of these two features, hope is a theological virtue (ST II-II\n17.5; see also 1 Corinthians 13). While love (or charity) is directed\nto God for the sake of unity, faith and hope are directed towards God\nwith a view to some good to be obtained from that unity: faith relates\nto God as a source of knowledge, hope relates to God as a source of\ngoodness (ST II-II 17.6). \nThe rationality of theological hope can only be properly understood,\naccording to Aquinas when we acknowledge that hope has to be preceded\nby faith (which underlies the belief in the possibility of salvation),\nbut, given faith, hope for the good of salvation is rational. Despair,\nas caused either by the absence of faith or the desire to be saved, is\nsinful (ST II-II 20.1). As hope is, by definition, future-directed, it\nonly is possible for human beings who are uncertain of whether they\nare blessed or damned, whereas love can persist even after their\nultimate fate has been revealed (ST II-II 18.2–3). \nIn 17th and 18th-century philosophy, hope is\ndiscussed by most philosophers as a part of their general theories of\nmotivation and cognition and often discussed as a\n“passion”, i.e., as a fundamentally noncognitive attitude\n(even though it might have a belief-component). This implies a\nrejection of Aquinas’ division between different kinds of\npassions in favor of a moral psychology which classifies emotions and\ndesires together as passions that generate action, of which hope is\nusually conceived as a species. Almost all authors mentioned in the\nfollowing also embrace some version of the idea defining for the\n“standard account” that hope is based on uncertainty in\nbelief together with a representation of an object as desirable. As a\nresult, hope is seen by most philosophers in this period (with the\nexception of Spinoza) as a motivating factor in human agency that is\nneutral, as it can lead to both rational and irrational action. \nAccording to René Descartes, hope is a weaker form of\nconfidence (Passions of the Soul, [1649] 1985: 389) and\nconsists in a desire (a representation of an outcome to be both good\nfor us and possible) together with a disposition to think of it as\nlikely but not certain (Passions of the Soul, [1649] 1985:\n350f, 389). This means that hope and anxiety always accompany each\nother (in contrast to both despair and confidence which are absolute\nopposites). Hope also underlies the more complex passions of boldness\nand courage (Descartes [1649] 1985: 391). While hope for the approval\nof others can move us to virtue and thus be commendable (Descartes\n[1649] 1985: 401), it is, like all passions, a product of the\nmovements of the “spirits” and thus not completely under\nthe control of our soul (Descartes [1649] 1985: 345) which means that\nit may work against the good of the soul-body union. \nThomas Hobbes adopts a similar analysis. For him, hope is a complex\npassion or a “pleasure of the mind”, i.e., a pleasure that\narises not from direct sensation but from thinking. For Hobbes, the\nsimplest building block underlying hope is appetite, and\n“appetite with an opinion of obtaining” is hope\n(Leviathan, 36, I.VI.14). As in Descartes, hope serves as a\nbuilding block for more complex mental phenomena, such as courage or\nconfidence (Leviathan, 36f, I.VI.17/19). But hope also plays\na role in the mental activity of deliberation which is defined as the\nalternation of hope and fear with appetites and aversion\n(Leviathan, 39, I.VI.49). Hope—a term which Hobbes\noften uses more or less synonymously with (justified)\nexpectation—plays an important role in the political application\nof his moral psychology: not only is the equality in the state of\nnature defined as an equality of hope (Leviathan, 83,\nI.XIII.3)—which makes it rational for everyone to pursue their\nindividual advantage—the laws of nature also command one to seek\npeace where one has hope for obtaining it (Leviathan, 87,\nI.XIV.4). Both the collective agency problem in the state of nature\nand the solution to it thus depend on what hopes individuals can\nrationally entertain. \nBaruch de Spinoza defines the passion of hope as a form of pleasure\n(Ethics III, P18, Spinoza [1677] 1985: 505) or joy that is\nmingled with sadness (due to the uncertainty of the outcome, see\nShort Treatise, book II, ch. IX, Spinoza [c. 1660] 1985: 113).\nIn contrast to more modern definitions, Spinoza distinguishes the\npleasure that is involved in hope from desire. Hope (in the\nEthics) is thus not necessarily connected to desire, but\nrather a way in which the mind is affected by the idea of a future\nevent. \nIn contrast to Hobbes and Descartes, Spinoza understands hope as\nfundamentally irrational. He argues that it must be the result of\nfalse belief inasmuch as it does not correctly represent that\neverything is governed by necessity (Short Treatise, book II,\nch. IX, [c. 1660] 1985: 113). Additionally, in the Ethics,\nSpinoza describes hope as one of the causes of superstition,\nespecially as it is always accompanied by fear (Ethics III,\nP50, [1677] 1985: 521). Such fear necessarily precludes it from being\nintrinsically good (Ethics IV, P47, [1677] 1985: 573). This\nis also the reason why we should attempt to make ourselves independent\nfrom hope. \nSpinoza agrees with Hobbes, however, by ascribing political\nsignificance to hope. As he explains in the Theological-Political\nTreatise, the fact that men are governed by hope and fear makes\nthem easy victims of superstition and false belief\n(Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 389); however,\ngood laws can also take advantage of this and motivate people by\narranging outcomes such that they can be motivated by hope\n(Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 439). The same\nimportance he places on hope also underlies his social contract\nargument. Like Hobbes, he argues that the only reason why men remain\nfaithful to the social contract or to carry out the orders of a\nsovereign has to be found in their hope of obtaining a certain good\nthis way (Theological-Political Treatise, [1670] 2002: 529).\nEven a people as a whole is always united by common hopes and fears\n(Political Treatise, [1675] 2002: 700), but hope rather than\nfear is dominant in the case of free peoples (ibid.).This\nleads Spinoza to proclaim hope and fear as the basis of political\npower in the Political Treatise ([1675] 2002: 686). \nDavid Hume’s account is another example of an analysis of hope\nas a passion, modified, however, by the specific approach he takes to\nhuman psychology. For Hume, hope is a “direct passion”\nthat is produced when the mind considers events that have a\nprobability between absolute certainty and absolute impossibility.\nHume describes probability-beliefs as an effect of the mind\nentertaining contrary views—of an event or object as either\nexistent or nonexistent—in quick succession after another. Each\nof these views gives rise to either joy or sorrow (when the object is\nsomething good or bad) which linger longer in the mind than the\noriginal imagination of the object’s existence or non-existence.\nWhen considering objects that are probable, but not certain, the mind\nis thus affected by a mixture of joy and sorrow that, depending on the\npredominant element, can be called hope or fear.  \nIt is after this manner that hope and fear arise from the different\nmixture of these opposite passions of grief and joy, and from their\nimperfect union and conjunction. (Treatise, [1738] 2007: 283)\n \nAs Hume sees hope as a necessary effect of the consideration of an\nuncertain event, it follows that we cannot but hope for any positive\noutcome about which we are uncertain. The uncertainty in question can\nbe based on the actual uncertainty of the event but also on uncertain\nbelief. \nWhile hope is primarily discussed as a feature of the psychology of\nindividual humans in the 17th and 18th century\nand, as a noncognitive attitude, taken to be neither essentially\nrational nor irrational, it is given much greater significance by\nImmanuel Kant who adopts a much more substantial (and complex) view of\nthe connection between hope and reason, not only allowing for\nreasonable hope but even for hope as something which might be\nrationally demanded in certain contexts. \nKant’s definition of hope as “unexpected offering of the\nprospect of immeasurable good fortune” (AE 7:255) in the\nAnthropology still seems to remain within the traditional\ndiscourse about hope. However, Kant eventually promotes hope to occupy\na central place in his philosophical system by focusing on hope as an\nattitude that allows human reason to relate to those questions which\ncannot be answered by experience. In the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant states the question “For what may I\nhope?” as one of the fundamental questions of philosophy, after\n“What can I know?” and “What should I do?”\n(A805/B833). This question, as far as its answer depends on claims regarding the\nconsequences of moral righteousness and the existence of God, is\n“simultaneously practical and theoretical” (A805/B833) and\nit is answered by religion (AE 9:25). Kant’s account of hope\nconsequently connects his moral philosophy with his views on religion.\nHe emphasizes the rational potential of such hope, but he also makes\nclear that rational hope is intimately connected to religious faith,\ni.e., the belief in god. \nKant considers three primary objects of hope in his writings: (1)\nOne’s own happiness (as part of the highest good), (2)\none’s own moral progress (in the Religion) and (3) the\nmoral improvement of the human race as a whole.  \n(1) In the Canon of the Critique of Pure Reason,\nKant states clearly: “all hope concerns happiness”\n(A805/B833). However, it is not the hope for one’s own happiness\nsimpliciter that is at stake, but the hope for happiness that\none deserves because of one’s moral conduct (A809/B837). Kant\nargues that there is a necessary connection between the moral\nlaw and the hope for happiness. However, this connection exists only\n“in the idea of pure reason”, not in nature (A809/B837). A\nproportionality between happiness and morality can only be thought of\nas necessary in an intelligible, moral world, where we abstract from\nall hindrances to moral conduct. In the empirical world of experience,\nthere is no guarantee for a necessary connection between moral conduct\nand happiness. Thus, Kant concludes, we may reasonably hope for\nhappiness in proportion to morality only if we introduce the\nadditional non-empirical assumption of “a highest reason, which\ncommands in accordance with moral laws, as […] the cause of\nnature” (A810/B838). This way, Kant connects morality and\nhappiness in the object of hope and secures its possibility in a\nhighest reason, i.e., in god. Kant calls the connection between\n“happiness in exact proportion with the morality of rational\nbeings, through which they are worthy of it” the highest\ngood (A814/B842). A peculiarity of Kant’s treatment of hope\nin the Canon is that hope for the highest good is apparently\nconsidered necessary for moral motivation (A813/B841)—a thesis\nhe rejects in his later writings. \nKant’s account of hope for happiness presents hope as very\nclosely connected to Kant’s concept of faith. This becomes\nobvious in the Critique of Practical Reason. Kant argues that\nin order to believe in the possibility of the highest good—and\nwe have to believe in this possibility, as it is prescribed by the\ncategorical imperative—we have to believe in or\npostulate the existence of god and immortality of the soul.\nKant himself uses both the concept of belief or faith and the\nconcept of hope in explaining the content of the postulate of\nimmortality: we must presuppose immortality in order to\nconceive of the highest good as “practically possible” and\nwe may therefore “hope for a further uninterrupted continuance\nof this [moral] progress, however long his existence may last, even\nbeyond this life” (AE 5:123). Thus, Kant can be understood as\narguing in favor of a traditional religious form of hope—hope\nfor a life after death or immortality of the soul. However, he points\nout that immortality is not a ‘mere’ hope (i.e., a hope\nfor an outcome where we lack evidence for the claim that it is really\npossible), but that reason makes it necessary (as a consequence of the\ncategorical imperative) to assume that immortality is possible. This\nclaim that it is rationally necessary to assume something seems to be\nstronger than the claim that we may (or even must) hope for it. \nWhereas some Kant interpreters do not clearly distinguish between hope\nand faith (Rossi 1982, Flikschuh 2010), Andrew Chignell emphasizes\nthat hope is an attitude that is distinct from faith or belief and\nthat Kant follows an “assert-the-stronger” policy: he\nasserts the strongest justified attitude towards p (justified\nbelief), even if one holds also weaker attitudes towards p\n(hope) (Chignell 2013: 198). O’Neill interprets Kant as\nholding that hope provides a reason for religious belief:\nBelief in God and immortality is not “merely possible”,\nbut a matter of “taking a hopeful view of human destiny”\n(O’Neill 1996: 281). According to O’Neill, the reason for\nfaith is the hope that moral action is successful, i.e., that our\nmoral intention can make a difference to the natural order. \nAnother possible interpretation is that Kant uses “hope”\nto describe a certain kind of belief. Such a belief would refer to an\nobject that is theoretically possible, but in regard to which it is\nundecidable whether it exists and practically necessary to\nassume its existence. He holds that there can be practical (moral)\nreasons—that the highest good must be realizable—that make\nhope (for god’s existence and immortality) not only valuable and\nrational, but even rationally required. \n(2) In the Religion, Kant envisages one’s own moral\nprogress as an object of hope. He assumes that human beings have a\npropensity to evil, i.e., they occasionally prioritize maxims of\nself-love over moral ones (see AE 6:32). Consequently, our task as\nmoral agents is to perform a “revolution of the will” by\nadopting the moral law as one’s fundamental maxim. This\nrevolution is an object of hope: \nMan cannot attain naturally to assurance concerning such a [moral]\nrevolution… for the deeps of the heart (the subjective first\ngrounds of his maxim) are inscrutable to him. Yet he must be able to\nhope through his own efforts to reach the road which leads\nhither…because he ought to become a good man. (AE 6:46, see\nalso 6:48, translation from Kant [1793] 1960: 51) \nKant claims that this hope may include the hope for divine assistance\nin performing the revolution (AE 6:171). But if Kant is understood as\nclaiming that we require assistance from God in order to\nbecome morally good (Chignell 2013: 212ff.), this claim stands in\ntension with Kant’s fundamental assumption that human beings are\nfree and fully responsible for being good or evil. Chignell therefore\nproposes that Kant might  \nregard it as metaphysically possible for us to receive divine\nassistance in the intelligible realm while doing something for which\nwe are fully responsible. (Chignell 2013: 216) \n(3) In his political and historical writings, Kant considers another\nobject of reasonable hope: the hope for historical progress towards a\nmorally better, peaceful future. We find a similar relationship\nbetween rational belief and hope as with regard to God and\nimmortality: Kant sees the moral improvement of the human race both as\nan object of an assumption or rational belief, which\nis connected to a moral duty, and an object of hope (AE\n8:309). Similar to the objects of the practical postulates, God and\nimmortality, the assumption of moral improvement of the human race\ncannot be proven. Nevertheless, it is rational to believe or hope for\nit because it is a necessary presupposition for a moral duty (the duty\nto help morally improve the younger generation). Kant assigns\n“hope for better times” an important function for moral\nmotivation by claiming that without it, the desire to benefit the\ncommon good would “never have warmed the human heart” (AE\n8:309). Viewing human history with a “confirmation bias”\n(Kleingeld 2012: 175), i.e., with a view on the realization of moral\ndemands, encourages the attempt to fighting evils “instead of\nsuccumbing to despair” (ibid.). \nIndependently of these systematic issues regarding hope in\nKant’s philosophy, it is worth summarizing some general features\nthat Kant touches upon concerning hope. Regarding a\ndescriptive account of what it means that a person hopes that\np, one can extract two necessary conditions from Kant’s\nremarks that are in line with the standard account of hope: the object\nof hope must be uncertain, and the person must wish for it. Both\nconditions are can be found in the following passage from\nPerpetual Peace: \n[R]eason is not enlightened enough to survey the entire series of\npredetermining causes that foretell with certainty the happy or\nunhappy consequences of humankind’s activities in accordance\nwith the mechanism of nature (although it does let us hope that these\nwill be in accord with our wishes). (AE 8:370) \nIn regard to the normative conditions under which hope is\nrational, in Theory and Practice Kant claims that a\nparticular hope (or intention formed on the basis of hope) is not\nirrational as long as its object cannot be proven to be impossible (AE\n8:309f.). Besides this negative criterion, the main positive reason\nKant considers in favor of hope is that certain hopes are\n(necessarily) connected with a moral duty. Therefore, even though the\nthird question of philosophy is “For what may I\nhope?”, Kant in many passages discusses for what we\nmust hope (see O’Neill 1996: 285). \nIn Post-Kantian philosophy, the role of hope is disputed. One can\nidentify two more or less distinct approaches. On the one hand, there\nare authors like Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert\nCamus who reject hope, not so much as epistemically irrational but as\nexpression of a misguided relationship to the world that is unable to\nface the demands of human existence. On the other hand, authors like\nSøren Kierkegaard and Gabriel Marcel take hope to be a means to\novercome the limitations of ordinary experience. \nKierkegaard examines hope primarily as it is connected to religious\nfaith. However, whereas Kant aims to show that our belief in god and\nhope for the highest good is possible within the limits of reason,\nKierkegaard is keen to emphasize that (eternal) hope must transcend\nall understanding. As an antipode to despair, hope plays a positive\nrole in Kierkegaard’s work, culminating in his admonition:\n“a person’s whole life should be the time of hope!”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 251). In Works of Love, Kierkegaard\ndefines hope in its most general form as a relation to the possibility\nof the good: “To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility\nof the good is to hope” (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n249). \nMost interpreters of Kierkegaard emphasize a distinction between\n“heavenly” (or eternal) hope and “earthly” (or\ntemporal) hope (Bernier 2015; Fremstedal 2012; McDonald 2014). In some\npassages, Kierkegaard indeed seems to assume that there is also\n“natural hope” (Kierkegaard [1851] 1990: 82) or hope\n“for some earthly advantage” (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n261). However, strictly speaking, Kierkegaard considers this the\n“wrong language usage” (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 261). He\ncompletes his definition as follows: “To relate oneself\nexpectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which\ncannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). On Kierkegaard’s view,\nhope—strictly speaking—is thus always directed towards the\neternal, “since hope pertains to the possibility of the good,\nand thereby to the eternal” (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). This\nis connected to Kierkegaard’s account of time. Hope, as a form\nof expectation, is an attitude towards the possible. While\nexpectation, generally speaking, relates to the possibility of both\ngood and evil (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249), hope relates only to the\npossibility of good. The possibility of the good, on\nKierkegaard’s account, is a feature of the eternal (“in\ntime, the eternal is the possible, the future”). \nWhile the expectation of earthly goods is often\ndisappointed—either because it is fulfilled too late or not at\nall (Kierkegaard [1843–1844] 1990: 215)—eternal hope\ncannot in principle be disappointed (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n261–3, Kierkegaard [1843–1844] 1990: 216). Eternal hope\nmeans “at every moment always to hope all things”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). Kierkegaard mostly equates eternal\nhope with Christian hope (McDonald 2014: 164). \nIn order to understand the relation between earthly and heavenly hope,\nit is helpful to consider the dialectical progression of hope that\nKierkegaard presents in the Nachlaß (Malantschuk (ed.)\n1978: 247). There is a kind of hope that occurs spontaneously in\nyouth, which appears to be a pre-reflexive hope, a kind of immediate\ntrust or confidence (Fremstedal 2012: 52). It is followed by the\n“supportive calculation of the understanding”, i.e., by\nhope involving the reflection about the probability of the hoped-for\noutcome. This (earthly) hope is often disappointed by the lateness or\nnon-arrival of the expected goods. This disappointment is necessary in\norder to acquire eternal hope, which “is against hope, because\naccording to that purely natural hope there was no more hope;\nconsequently this hope is against hope” (Kierkegaard [1851]\n1990: 82).  Kierkegaard’s interpretation of Abraham’s\nstory in\nFear and Trembling can be understood as illustration of this\nkind of hope (Lippitt 2015). \nWhereas earthly hope is judged by the understanding according to its\nprobability, eternal hope exceeds the limits of understanding. It is\ntherefore commonly judged as irrational or as “lunacy”\n(Kierkegaard [1851] 1990: 83). Kierkegaard does not explicitly take up\nthe question of when hope is rational—presumably because eternal\nhope exceeds reason—but he frames the question of good or bad\nhope in terms of “honor” and “shame”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260f.). He observes that a person who\nentertained an earthly hope that has not been fulfilled is very often\ncriticized as imprudent (or “put to shame” (Kierkegaard\n[1847] 1995: 260)) because this is supposed to show that she\n“miscalculated” (ibid.). Kierkegaard objects to this\nperspective of “sagacity” that judges hope only with\nregard to its fulfillment. Rather, we should pay attention to the\nvalue of the hoped-for ends (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 261). Eternal\nhope, on this account, “is never put to shame”\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260, see also 263). Further, and in line\nwith the Christian tradition, he argues that the value of hope depends\non its relation to love: we hope for ourselves if and only if we hope\nfor others, and only to the same degree. Love  \nis the middle term: without love, no hope for oneself; with love, hope\nfor all others—and to the same degree one hopes for oneself, to\nthe same degree one hopes for others, since to the same degree one is\nloving. (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260) \nThus, similarly as in Kant’s account, one’s hope stands in\na proportional relationship with an ethical demand. However,\nKierkegaard does not see hope limited by our meeting an\nethical demand.  \nRather, Kierkegaard sees the proportional relation as determining\nwhether we are in fact hoping, and the actual degree of our\nexpectancy. Our hope for ourselves is only realizable in and through\nour hope for another. (Bernier 2015: 315) \nAs already mentioned, Schopenhauer represents the opposite approach in\npost-Kantian philosophy. Even though he holds that it is natural for\nhumans to hope (Parerga and Paralipomena II, 1851:\n§313), he also claims that we generally ought to hope less than\nwe are inclined to, calling hope a “folly of the heart”\n(ibid.). Ambivalent remarks concerning the value of hope (he\ninterprets Pandora’s box as containing all the goods,\nParerga and Paralipomena II, 1851: §200) can be found\nthroughout his writings, but on the whole, criticism prevails. There\nare two aspects to his critical evaluation of hope: hope’s\ninfluence on the intellect and its role for happiness. In\nSchopenhauer’s dichotomy of the will and the intellect, hope is\nan expression of the will or, more precisely, an inclination. One\nreason why hope is problematic with respect to its influence on the\nintellect is that it presents what we wish for as probable (The\nWorld as Will and Representation, vol. 2, [1818] 1958: 216,\n218). Schopenhauer concedes that hope sharpens our perception insofar\nas it makes certain features of the world salient. But he links this\nthesis to the stronger claim that hope may make it\n(often) impossible to grasp things that are relevant. Hope\nthus distorts cognition in a problematic way because it hinders the\nintellect to grasp the truth. However, Schopenhauer also concedes the\npossibility of a positive effect of hope, namely as motivation and\nsupport of the intellect (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 2, [1818] 1958: 221). \nWith regard to its contribution to personal happiness, Schopenhauer\nmentions a positive role of hope in his comparison of the life of\nanimals with that of humans. He states that animals experience less\npleasure than humans, because they lack hope and therefore the\npleasures of anticipation. But hope can not only lead to\ndisappointment when the hoped-for object is not realized, it can even\nbe disappointing when it is fulfilled if the outcome does not provide\nas much satisfaction as to be expected (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 2 [1818] 1958: 573). Schopenhauer also\ncriticizes Kant’s idea that we may hope for our own happiness in\nproportion to our moral conduct (the highest good). This conception of\nhope, according to Schopenhauer, leads Kant to remain implicitly\ncommitted to a form of eudaimonism (Basis of Morality II,\n§3, 34). \nThus, even though Schopenhauer occasionally hints at positive aspects\nof hope, his overall evaluation of hope is negative. This is\nconsistent with his view that life is filled with unavoidable\nfrustration and suffering, and that suffering can be reduced only by\ngetting rid of one’s desires. Ideally, this amounts to the\n“negation of the will to life” (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 1, [1818] 2010: 405). The “temptations\nof hope” (The World as Will and Representation, vol. 1,\n[1818] 2010: 419) function as obstacles for the negation of the will,\nwhereas hopelessness can help to transform one’s mind and\nacquire “genuine goodness and purity of mind” (The\nWorld as Will and Representation, vol. 1, [1818] 2010:\n420). Interestingly, Schopenhauer does have sympathies with the idea\nof salvation, which lies in the denial of the will (Schopenhauer\n[1818] 1958: 610), that is, he seems to subscribe to a kind of\ntranscendent hope for an end of all suffering (Schulz 2002: 125).\nEven though he does not say so, one could characterize his view as a\n“hope for the end of hope”. \nNietzsche is perhaps the most famous critic of hope in the\npost-Kantian tradition. In the third preface to Zarathustra,\nhe warns: “do not believe those who speak to you of\nextraterrestrial hopes!” (Zarathustra, [1883–85]\n2006: 6) Similarly, in Beyond Good and Evil (1886) he opposes\nall notions of hope “in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness\nand justice” (Beyond Good and Evil, [1886] 2008: 562).\nIn his interpretation of Pandora’s myth (Human, All Too\nHuman, 1878: §71), he calls hope\n“the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of\nman”. However, a closer look reveals that, outside of his\ncriticism of religious and metaphysical hopes, he also hints at a\npositive perspective on hope: “that mankind be redeemed from\nrevenge: that to me is the bridge to the highest hope and a\nrainbow after long thunderstorms” (Zarathustra,\n[1883–85] 2006: 77). Nietzsche counts hope amongst the\n“strong emotions” (Nietzsche [1887] 2006: 103), next to\nanger, fear, voluptuousness and revenge. Furthermore, he repeatedly\ncharacterizes hope using the metaphor of a rainbow: “hope is the\nrainbow over the cascading stream of life” [“Die Hoffnung\nist der Regenbogen über den herabstürzenden jähen Bach\ndes Lebens”] (as cited in Bidmon 2016: 188). However, the\nmetaphor of the “rainbow” is ambivalent. On the one hand,\nit is connected to Nietzsches vision of the “overman”:\n“Do you not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the\noverman?” (Zarathustra, [1883–85] 2006: 36). On\nthe other hand, however, the rainbow is elusive and withdraws\nitself—Nietzsche calls it an “illusory bridge”\n(Zarathustra, [1883–85] 2006: 175; see also Bidmon 2016:\n188f.). In Beyond Good and Evil, he finally claims that we\nshould “fix our hopes” in “new philosophers”,\n“in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite\nestimates of value” (Beyond Good and Evil, [1886] 2008:\n600). In Human all too human, he similarly envisages change\nof the social order as an object of hope:  \n[W]e are only reasonably entitled to hope when we believe that we and\nour equals have more strength in heart and head than the\nrepresentatives of the existing state of things. (Human All Too\nHuman, 1878: §443)  \nReasonable hope is thus grounded in a trust in one’s capacity to\nbring about the desired outcome. However, Nietzsche adds that usually\nthis hope amounts to “presumption, an\nover-estimation” (ibid.). \nCamus follows Nietzsche in declaring (religious) hope the worst of all\nevils (Judaken and Bernasconi 2012: 264). His critique of hope is\nlinked to the idea that the human existence is\n“absurd”. The “elusive feeling of absurdity”\n(Camus 1955: 12) is characterized by a discrepancy: the human mind\nasks fundamental questions about the meaning of life, but “the\nworld” does not provide answers. Camus’ understanding of\nthe absurd is best captured in the image of Sisyphus, who exemplifies\nlife’s absurdity in his “futile and hopeless labor”\n(Camus 1955: 119). The assumption that life is absurd goes hand in\nhand with the denial of religious hope for salvation. In his early\nwriting Nuptials ([1938] 1970), Camus opposes religious ideas\nabout the immortal soul and hope for an afterlife. In fact,\n“[h]ope is the error Camus wishes to\navoid” (Aronson 2012). Even though Camus is often regarded as an\n“existentialist”, he distances himself from this\nmovement. One reason is precisely his disagreement with the account of\nhope of the existentialists, Kierkegaard in particular, of which he\nsays that “they deify what crushes them and find reason to hope\nin what impoverishes them.  That forced hope is religious in all of\nthem” (Camus 1955: 32). \nAs already mentioned, one kind of hope that Camus flatly rejects is\nreligious hope for a life beyond death. A second kind of hope,\nprimarily discussed in The Rebel, is the hope founded on a\ngreat cause beyond oneself, i.e., “hope of another life one must\n‘deserve’” (Camus 1955: 8). The problem with hoping\nfor social utopias, according to Camus, is that they tend to be\ndictatorial. A further reason to reject such hopes seems to be that\nthey distract from the life of the senses, from the here-and-now and\nfrom appreciating the beauty of this life. We also do not need hope to\ncope with the hardships of life and death: instead of hoping for a\nlife after death (or committing suicide), one should be conscious of\ndeath as “the most obvious absurdity” (Camus 1955: 59) and\n“die unreconciled and not of one’s own free will”\n(Camus 1955: 55). Sisyphus exemplifies the attitude of lucidity and\nconsciousness that Camus recommends. Even though he does not hope for\na better future,—or rather because he does not hope for\na better future—“[o]ne must imagine Sisyphus happy”\n(Camus 1955: 123). \nDespite his criticism of hope, Camus states that it is (nearly)\nimpossible to live without hope, even if one wishes to be free of hope\n(Camus 1955: 113). Presumably this claim is only descriptive,\nstating a fact about human psychology. However, in a letter to his\nfriend and poet René Char, Camus called The Rebel a\n“livre d’espoir” [book of hope] (Schlette 1995:\n130). On that note, it has recently been suggested that Camus allows\nfor a positive view of hope—a kind of “étrange\nespoir” [strange hope] that is directed towards the\npossibilities inherent in the present (Schlette 1995: 134) and that is\ncharacterized by humanism and solidarity with all human beings (Bidmon\n2016: 233). \nWhereas the positive role of hope in Camus is at best hidden, it\nsurfaces prominently in the writings of Marcel. At the heart of\nMarcel’s account of hope is the distinction between\n“‘I hope…’, the absolute statement, and\n‘I hope that…’” (Marcel [1952] 2010: 26).\nMarcel is mostly interested in a general, absolute hope, which he\nconceives as “the act by which […] temptation to despair\nis actively or victoriously overcome” (Marcel [1952] 2010:\n30f.). One way in which Marcel characterizes the “mystery”\n(Marcel [1952] 2010: 29) of hope is by alluding to the connection\nbetween hope and patience (Marcel [1952] 2010: 33). Hope implies the\nrespect for “personal rhythm” (ibid.) and\n“confidence in a certain process of growth and\ndevelopment” (Marcel [1952] 2010: 34). Marcel takes up the\nquestion of the rationality of hope in asking whether hope is an\nillusion that consists in taking one’s wishes for reality\n(Marcel [1952] 2010: 39). He answers that this objection against the\nvalue of hope applies primarily to hopes that are directed towards a\nparticular outcome (“to hope that X”), but it does not\napply when hope transcends the imagination. Because the person who\nhopes simpliciter does not anticipate a particular event, her\nhope cannot be judged with regard to whether it is likely to be\nfulfilled. Marcel illustrates this with the example of an invalid\n(Marcel [1952] 2010: 40). If this person hopes that he will be healthy\nat a certain point in time, there is the danger of disappointment and\ndespair if it does not happen. However, absolute hope, Marcel\nexplains, implies a “method of surmounting”: the patient\nhas true hope, if he realizes that “everything is not\nnecessarily lost if there is no cure” (Marcel [1952] 2010: 40).\nBeing a “theistic Existentialist” (Treanor and Sweetman\n2016) like Kierkegaard, Marcel ultimately connects this possibility of\nabsolute hope to the existence of god. Absolute hope is necessarily\nconnected to faith in God and is a “response of the creature to\nthe infinite Being to whom it is conscious of owing everything that it\nhas” (Marcel [1952] 2010: 41). \nEven though hope rarely features explicitly in pragmatist writings, it\nhas been suggested that pragmatist accounts of hope can be found in\nthe works of William James and John Dewey (Fishman and McCarthy 2007;\nGreen 2008; Koopman 2006, 2009; Rorty 1999; Shade 2001). As Patrick\nShade notes, the issue of hope is “implicit in most pragmatic\nphilosophies”, as it is related to central pragmatist topics,\nsuch as meliorism and faith, and particular hopes for social progress\n(Shade 2001: 9f.). \nIndeed, James’ concept of faith in The Will to Believe\nis closely linked to hope. In his essay, James aims to offer a\n“justification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a\nbelieving attitude in religious matters” (James [1897] 2015: 1).\nEven though his primary subject is religious faith, he points out that\na structural similar justification of faith or trust can be applied to\nsocial questions. It can be rational to believe that the other is\ntrustworthy or likes us, even though we may not be able to prove it.\nThree criteria have to be fulfilled for faith to be rational: the\nquestion cannot be decided scientifically, the belief may be true, and\nwe are better off (even now) if we believe. In his argument, James\ndraws a link to the concept of hope when claiming that the skeptic or\nagnostic attitude is not more rational than the attitude of faith. The\nskeptic holds “that to yield to our fear of its being error is\nwiser and better than to yield to our hope that it may be true”\n(James [1897] 2015: 27). James criticizes this attitude: “what\nproof is there that dupery through hope is so much worse than dupery\nthrough fear?” (James [1897] 2015: 27). \nIn Dewey’s writings, the topic of hope has been connected to his\naccount of meliorism (Shade 2001: 139). Meliorism is  \nthe idea that at least there is a sufficient basis of goodness in life\nand its conditions so that by thought and earnest effort we may\nconstantly make things better. (Dewey [1916] 1980: 294)  \nDewey distinguishes meliorism from optimism: Meliorism  \nattacks optimism on the ground that it encourages the fatalistic\ncontentment with things as they are; what is needed is the frank\nrecognition of evils, not for the sake of accepting them as final, but\nfor the sake of arousing energy to remedy them. (ibid.)  \nThe object of hope or meliorism, for Dewey, is first and foremost\ndemocracy, which is “the simple idea that political and ethical\nprogress hinges on nothing more than persons, their values, and their\nactions” (ibid.: 107). \nThe contemporary debate about hope in analytic philosophy is primarily\nconcerned with providing a definition of hope, explicating standards\nof rationality and explaining the value of hope. The debate takes as\nits starting point what has been called the “orthodox\ndefinition” (Martin 2013: 11) or the “standard\naccount” (Meirav 2009: 217), which analyses hope in terms of a\nwish or desire for an outcome and a belief concerning the\noutcome’s possibility. R.S. Downie is representative of this\nposition: \nThere are two criteria which are independently necessary and jointly\nsufficient for ‘hope that’. The first is that the object\nof hope must be desired by the hoper. […] The second […]\nis that the object of hope falls within a range of physical\npossibility which includes the improbable but excludes the certain and\nthe merely logically possible. (Downie 1963: 248f.) \nSimilarly, J. P. Day writes:  \n“A hopes that p” is true iff “A\nwishes that p, and A thinks that p has some\ndegree of probability, however small” is true. (Day 1969:\n89) \nThe desire-condition captures the fact that the subject is attracted\nto the outcome. Concerning the belief-condition, there is general\nagreement that we cannot hope for what we believe to be either\nimpossible or certain. For a\ndescriptive account of hope, only the belief of the\nhoping person about the possibility of the object is relevant,\nindependently of whether this belief is true: a person can hope for an\nobject she believes to be possible even if the object is in fact\nimpossible. While most accounts employ the idea that a hoping person\nholds a positive belief to the effect that the outcome is possible,\nthe most minimal position would require only the absence of\nthe belief that the outcome is impossible (or certain) (see Pettit\n2004: 153 for both formulations). \nMost authors implicitly assume that the hoped-for event is in the\nfuture. In ordinary usage however, people often express hopes\nregarding past events of which they do not have complete knowledge. An\nexample is the hope that someone did not suffer excessively\nwhen they died. While some authors consider this use of language to be\nparasitic on the future-directed case (McGeer 2004: 104), others argue\nthat these are genuine cases of hope (Martin 2013: 68). \nAnother question in this context concerns the concept of possibility\nthat is at issue: It seems clear that we cannot hope for the logically\nimpossible, but can we hope for the physically impossible, e.g., that\nthe dead will rise tomorrow? Downie, for example, holds that logical\npossibility is not enough (Downie 1963: 249), whereas Chignell\ndoes not exclude the possibility of hope for something which is\nphysically impossible (Chignell 2013: 201ff.). Whatever the answer to\nthis question, all views (except Wheatley 1958) allow for cases of\nhope in which the outcome is extremely improbable; in other words, no\nlower bound to the probability is required for hoping (Meirav\n2009: 219). \nSimilarly, few authors doubt that the desire and belief component to which\nthe orthodox definition refers are necessary conditions for hope (although\nSegal and Textor 2015 deny this). However, convincing objections have\nbeen raised against the idea that the standard definition provides\nsufficient conditions for hope. Ariel Meirav (2009) and Philip Pettit\n(2004) raise the most important objections. \nMeirav argues that the standard definition fails to distinguish hope\nfrom despair: two people can have identical desires and beliefs about\nthe possibility of an outcome, and yet one of them may hope for the\noutcome while the other despairs of it. According to Meirav’s\n“External Factor Account” (Meirav 2009: 230), hope also\ninvolves an attitude towards an external factor (e.g., nature, fate,\nGod) on which the realization of the hoped-for end causally depends.\n“If one views the external factor as good, then one hopes for\nthe prospect. If one views it as not good, then one despairs of\nit” (Meirav 2009: 230). Meirav links this definition to a claim\nabout the rationality of hope: the rationality of hope depends on the\nrationality of the belief in the goodness of an external factor\n(Meirav 2009: 233). \nAnother concern is that the standard account fails to explain how hope\ncan have special motivating force in difficult circumstances,\nespecially when the probability of the desired outcome is low (Pettit\n2004; Calhoun forthcoming). This objection is based on the idea that\nhope is closely connected to our agency. Victoria McGeer claims that\neven in cases where we cannot bring anything about to promote the\nhoped-for end, hope is “a way of positively and expansively\ninhabiting one’s agency”, and our “energy is\n[…] oriented toward the future” (McGeer 2004: 104). In\norder to capture the motivating power of hope, Pettit distinguishes\nthe “superficial” kind of hope described by the orthodox\ndefinition from a more “substantial” hope (Pettit 2004:\n154). He construes substantial hope as acting on a belief that the\nagent does not really hold:  \nHope will consist in acting as if a desired prospect is going to\nobtain or has a good chance of obtaining, just as precaution consists\nin acting as if this were the case with some feared prospect. (Pettit\n2004: 158)  \nHowever, this definition seems to render hope an intrinsically\nirrational attitude because it appears to require the hopeful person\nto act as if she had a false belief. In typical cases, a\nhopeful person does not describe herself as acting as if the\nchances were higher, but as taking the chances as they are as\ngood enough to try (Martin 2013: 23). \nCheshire Calhoun argues that “in hope we live under some kind of\nas-if idea of the future”. Whereas Pettit suggests that act as\nif the prospect has a good chance of obtaining and Martin as if the\nprospect is merely possible, Calhoun argues that hope involves a view\nof the future in terms of success. The third component of hope besides\ndesire and belief, according to her, is “a phenomenological\nidea of the determinate future whose content includes\nsuccess.” This phenomenological idea, she argues, has\nmotivational effect independently of the agent’s desires. This\ncomponent is not a fully reason-responsive state, as it has\nnon-rational sources like habituation to success or failure. \nIn a recent proposal, Adrienne Martin aims to remedy the faults of the\nstandard definition in yet a different way and gives an account of\nhope’s rationality. Similar to Walker (Walker 2006: 48), Martin\nholds that hope should not be analyzed in terms of necessary and\nsufficient conditions, but rather as a “syndrome” with\nparadigmatic marks (Martin 2013: 62). These marks involve two more\nelements in addition to belief and desire or attraction: First, the\nagent must see or treat her belief about the possibility of the\noutcome’s occurring as licensing hopeful activities,\ni.e., as not advising against some specific activities. Second, the\nagent must treat her attraction to the outcome as a practical\nreason to engage in the activities characteristic of hope. Martin\ncalls her account the Incorporation Thesis, which refers to\nthe fact that the hoping person incorporates the desire-element into\nher rational scheme of ends. On Martin’s account, the\nrationality of hope is primarily a practical question. Whereas the\nattraction to the outcome is (on her view) not subject to rational\nnorms at all, the belief in the outcome’s possibility is\nresponsive to theoretical reasons pertaining to the possibility of the\noutcome. However, whether one sees the belief in the possibility as\nlicensing hopeful activities and, consequently, whether one takes\none’s attraction as a practical reason to engage in hopeful\nactivities is governed by norms of rational end promotion (Martin\n2013: 51). In this respect, her account is similar to Pettit’s\nposition, which emphasizes the instrumental value hope has for the\npursuit of our ends (Pettit 2004: 161). \nA further dimension of value is suggested by Luc Bovens’ (1999)\ntheory. He argues that in cases where hoping has no instrumental value\n(because we cannot contribute to bring about the desired state), hope\ncan still have intrinsic value. In Bovens’ view, this\nintrinsic value pertains to hope because hoping involves mental\nimaging. This characteristic of hope is responsible for its intrinsic\nvalue in three respects: First, hope has intrinsic value because\nmental imaging is pleasurable in itself (Bovens 1999: 675f.). Second,\nhope has epistemic value because it increases one’s\nself-understanding. Third, hope has intrinsic worth because it is\nconstitutive of love towards others and towards oneself, which are\nintrinsically valuable activities. It is in virtue of mental imaging\nthat hope is intimately connected to love, because spending mental\nenergy in thinking about the well-being of another person is\nconstitutive of loving her. \nAnother approach to the value of hope has been developed using the\nframework of virtue epistemology. Nancy Snow (2013) proposes three\nrespects in which hope can be understood as an intellectual virtue:\n(1) hope motivates the pursuit of epistemic ends such as knowledge;\n(2) hope imparts qualities to the epistemic agent, such as resilience,\nperseverance, flexibility, and openness, that further the successful\npursuit of those ends; and (3) hope functions as a kind of method in\nthe pursuit of intellectual projects. (For a critical assessment of\nSnow’s approach, see Cobb 2015.) \nIt must also be mentioned that the standard account does not exhaust\nthe meaning of “hope” as it has been treated in the\nphilosophical tradition, in particular as it does not allow for\nindeterminate hopes. For example, Marcel’s distinction between\n“hope that” and hope without a determinate object has\nrecently been taken up (with or without explicit reference to Marcel)\nby otherwise different accounts. Joseph Godfrey calls hope without\nobject “fundamental hope” and bases his account on an\nanalysis of Bloch, Kant and Marcel (Godfrey 1987). Patrick\nShade’s pragmatist theory distinguishes particular hopes and\nhopefulness as “an openness to possibilities that are meaningful\nand promising for us” (Shade 2001: 139). Jonathan Lear similarly\ndescribes “radical hope” as a sense of a future in which\n“something good will emerge” (Lear 2008: 94), even though\nall particular hopes were destroyed, and Matthew Ratcliffe takes such\nradical hope as an example for “pre-intentional hope”,\nwhich is  \na kind of general orientation or sense of how things are with the\nworld, in the context of which intentional states of the kind “I\nhope that p” are possible. (Ratcliffe 2013: 602) \nPsychologists and psychoanalysts have systematically investigated hope\nsince the 1950s (Frank 1968). In many of these first studies, hope was\nseen as a combination of the perception of an outcome as important for\nan agent to achieve and as having a certain probability (Stotland\n1969). While this\nunderstanding of hope deviates from the standard philosophical account\n(see section 3) by requiring a minimal probability, it continues to\nplay a major role in the current psychological literature. \nA very influential psychological approach to hope is Charles\nSnyder’s hope theory (for an overview, see Rand and Cheavens\n2009). Snyder defines hope as follows: \nWithin a goal-setting framework, we propose that there are two major,\ninterrelated elements of hope. First, we hypothesize that hope is\nfueled by the perception of successful agency related to goals. The\nagency component refers to a sense of successful determination in\nmeeting goals in the past, present, and future. Second, we hypothesize\nthat hope is influenced by the perceived availability of successful\npathways related to goals. (Snyder et al. 1991: 570) \nOn this basis, Snyder and others have developed a “hope\nscale” that measures several components of agency and pathways\nperception (ibid.). \nSeveral objections have been raised against this analysis of hope. One\nis that the “perception of agency” relates both to the\npast and the future and therefore measures a general trait of\nhopefulness rather than the hope for specific outcomes. As a response,\npsychologists have developed further “domain-specific”\nhope scales (Lopez et al. 2000: 61). A second question concerns the\nissue of whether Snyder’s definition of hope is sufficiently\ndistinct from optimism (see Miceli and Castelfranchi 2010; Aspinwall\nand Leaf 2002). Snyder wants to distinguish hope from optimism by\nlinking hope to beliefs about self-efficacy (Snyder 2002; Magaletta\nand Oliver 1999) and reserving the term “optimism” only\nfor generalized expectancies about positive outcomes. However, the\nordinary use of the term is better captured by the idea that hope can\nbe upheld even if one does not assign a high probability to the\noutcome. \nWhile the political importance of hope as a psychological state is\nacknowledged by pre-modern and modern philosophers and while religious hope for a\nlife after death is a major topic in medieval political philosophy,\nthe emergence of a modern worldview that conceives of history as\ncontingent and thus conceives of the future as a space for potential\nfundamental change, also changes the significance of hope. \nWhile this connection can be most clearly seen in Kant’s\nanalysis of the role of hope in our relation to human history (see\n section 2.4),\n Hannah Arendt makes a related point in passing in the Human\nCondition. According to Arendt, the “natality” of\nhuman beings allows them to make new beginnings in their actions and\nthus subvert the tendency of the public space to disintegrate into\nroutinized behaviour. Therefore, “natality” is a\nprecondition of genuine political action and a necessary condition for\nthe possibility of hope (Arendt 1958: 247). The capacity of hope and\nthe capacity to act politically are thus essentially intertwined. \nIn modern political philosophy, hope is significant for both the\nMarxist and the pragmatist-liberal (see\n section 2.6)\n tradition of thought. Both traditions have produced\nthinkers—Ernst Bloch and Richard Rorty, respectively—who\naccord hope a central place in their political thought. In\ncontemporary political philosophy, hope is not a central topic, but\nthere are interesting attempts to assess its significance for liberal\nideal and nonideal theory (see White 1991; Smith 2005b; Moellendorf\n2010). \nBloch‘s The Principle of Hope is certainly not only the\nmost radical attempt to build a critical political philosophy on a\nhighly unorthodox theory of hope, it also constitutes a decisive break\nwith standard analyses of hope found in the philosophical\ntradition. \nRegarding the nature of hope, Bloch argues that it has both an\naffective component (as the opposite of fear) and a cognitive\ncomponent (being the opposite of remembrance) through which it\nanticipates a state of affairs that not only does not yet exist, but\nthat also is not yet cognitively completely available to the subject.\nOn the affective side, Bloch describe affects as a subclass of drives\nwhich are the basic material of his (psychoanalytically inspired)\npsychology. In contrast to basic drives, affects are self-reflexive in\ntwo ways: when agents become conscious of their affects this can add\nto the motivating power of the latter (Fink-Eitel 1988: 323); and\nthrough the consciousness of its affects, the subject becomes also\ncapable of reflecting upon itself. Among the affects, we can\ndistinguish between “filled” emotions (which have as their\nobject something which is already completely available in the\nlifeworld of the agent) and “expectant emotions”\n(Erwartungsaffekte) that relate to something not yet\navailable, among them hope and fear. In this schema, hope is a\npositive expectant emotion (Bloch [1954–59] 1986: I:111), and in\ncontrast to the negative affects, to which we are subject\ninvoluntarily, it is something in regard to which we have a degree of\nfreedom. Bloch therefore claims that, as a free, future-directed form\nof anticipation, hope is the most human of all affects (Bloch\n[1954–59] 1986: I:74). \nIn regard to the cognitive component, Bloch describes hope as\nproviding new forms of access to reality in a way that defies short\nsummary. In general, however, one can say that hope is always related\nto the “not-yet-conscious” that in turn reflects\n“objective possibilities”. The terms “not-yet\nconscious” and “preconscious” (Bloch [1954–59]\n1986: I:115) are part of an oppositional reading of classic\npsychoanalysis that, according to Bloch, understands the unconscious\npredominantly as encompassing thoughts which are no longer\nconscious or repressed (ibid.), but neglects the possibility that some\nunconscious thoughts are not yet capable of being conscious. This also\nleads Bloch to introduce a future-directed counterpart to the concept\nof repression (Bloch [1954–59] 1986: I:128). Whereas repressed\nmemories are repressed by forces within the subject, resistance to\nnot-yet conscious thought is to found in the very material or content\nof that thought, namely objective, future possibilities—events\nor outcomes that are, by definition, not yet achieved and habitualized\nand thus not available in the lifeworld for the subject’s\nconceptualization. This resistance to conscious reflection is also\nalways partly due to socio-economic causes; not all projects are\nequally achievable in all historical moments and thus their becoming\nfully available to consciousness is blocked by their (present)\nimpossibility (Bloch [1954–59] 1986: I:130). \nThe content or material of the not-yet-conscious is defined by what\nBloch calls the “Front”. This concept is related to\nBloch’s processual metaphysics according to which objective\ntendencies and possibilities in reality interact with\n“closed” matters of fact, such that the moment of\npotentiality surpassing into actuality always opens up opportunities\nfor the interventions of active decision-making. The right way to\nrelate to these “Front” opportunities is, according to\nBloch, “militant optimism”, i.e., not a mere assumption\nthat things will develop in a desirable direction, but an active\nrelation to real tendencies with the goal to realize them (Bloch\n[1954–59] 1986: I:201). \nArguing from these premises, Bloch develops an integrated theory in\nwhich hope is not merely a subjective combination of desires and\nbeliefs about probabilities or facts, but rather a reflection of\nmetaphysical possibilities in the world and part of a range of human\ncapacities that make it possible to relate to that which is not yet,\nbut which is already prefigured in the objective potentials of\nreality. In the Principle of Hope, Bloch offers a\nwide-ranging overview of historical and current forms in which hope,\noptimism and utopia have been and are captured by visions of potential\nstates of affairs—the list of topics discussed ranges from\nmedial representation of desires, social and geographic utopias to\nliterary and artistic ways in which the possible can be captured and\nphilosophical theories of the goods. \nThe theoretical framework in which these analyses are embedded and in\nthe service of which they are employed, is a revised form of Marxism.\nBloch’s Marxism relies on a dialectical materialism which has\ntwo aspects that Bloch calls the “cold” and the\n“warm stream”: the first designates the materialist\ninsight that all historical developments are conditioned and\nconstrained by concrete, existing material conditions, “strict\ndeterminations that cannot be skipped over” (Bloch\n[1954–59] 1986: I:208), whereas the second acknowledges the\nprocessual constitution of reality which is adequately captured by\nhope and expectation. On this version of Marxism, hope becomes a\ncentral element of the stance of the social theorist and critic. In\nparticular, Bloch understands Marx’s account of a unity between\ntheory and practice in the Theses on Feuerbach to suggest a\nsocial theory that occupies the “horizon of the future”\n(Bloch [1954–59] 1986: I:285) and a materialism which centrally\nintegrates hope. This materialism, Bloch argues in the final pages of\nThe Principle of Hope, can overcome the division between\npowerless fantasy and a mechanical determinism which underlies mere\npredictions of the future and guide political action that is directed\ntowards a real, material, objective possibility—classless\nsociety—which is, at the same time, still acknowledged to be\ndependent on human decision (Bloch [1954–59] 1986: III:1372).\nSuch activity, according to Bloch, must be guided by militant optimism\nor hope. Political hope is thus not only valuable, it is also\nnecessary to achieve social change for the better. \nWhile Rorty agrees with Bloch that hope, rather than knowledge about\nhistorical inevitability or moral truth, is an appropriate basis for\nprogressive political theory, the argument that he develops for this\nclaim could not be more different from the one Bloch advances. Whereas\nBloch tries to underpin both his descriptive analysis of hope and the\ndialectic materialism that is to guide political action with a\nmetaphysical vocabulary that aims to identify the ultimate reality to\nwhich hope refers, Rorty arrives at his endorsement of hope as an\nimportant element in contemporary liberal politics through a rejection\nof political models that are based on the idea of (perhaps privileged)\nknowledge or insight. \nIn Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, Rorty identifies hope\nas a central element of a hermeneutic rather than an epistemological\napproach to philosophy: \nHermeneutics sees the relations between various discourses as those of\nstrands in a possible conversation, a conversation which presupposes\nno disciplinary matrix which unites the speakers, but where the hope\nof agreement is never lost so long as the conversation lasts. This\nhope is not a hope for the discovery of antecedently existing common\nground, but simply hope for agreement, or, at least, exciting and\nfruitful disagreement. (Rorty 1979: 318) \nAs Rorty also emphasizes in later writings, this hope is not based on\nany foundations—such as knowledge about\nprobabilities—rather, it is an attitude by which interlocutors\nexpress both their commitment to certain forms of future interaction\nand their belief in its possibility. Although Rorty never provides a\nformal analysis of hope (the closest he comes to such a definition is\nhis approving reference to Dewey’s analysis of hope as\n“the ability to believe that the future will be unspecifiably\ndifferent from, and unspecifiably freer than, the past”, Rorty\n1999: 120), his use of the term is consistent with the standard\ndefinition. In this sense, “political deliberation presupposes\nhope” (Rorty 2002: 153). He adds to this definition an important\nethical component, however, insofar he focusses on forms of hope that\nconcern intersubjective interactions: to approach others with the hope\nfor agreement is an expression of the liberal virtue of civility\n(Rorty 1979: 318). \nThe concept of hope gradually becomes more important throughout\nRorty’s work. In Contingency, Irony and Solidarity,\nRorty contrasts two forms of liberalism: The “liberal\nmetaphysician” expects social cooperation to be based on\nscientific or philosophical insight that penetrates individual\nidiosyncrasy and aims at the adoption of a universal, final vocabulary\nthat then leads to solidarity. By contrast, the “liberal\nironist” renounces the idea of a final vocabulary. By\nacknowledging that only the contingent overlap between “selfish\nhopes” can be a source of solidarity (Rorty 1989: 93), a liberal\nironist also must give up the idea that there is something\nintrinsically, universally human that will provide a source of\nsolidarity. Instead, we have to engage in an attempt to create\nsolidarity out of shared experiences and interests (Rorty 1999:\n87). \nRorty sees the pragmatists, and Dewey in particular (see\n section 2.6),\n as the theorists who have best captured these different aspects of\nhope. On the epistemic dimension, they embrace a form of hope that\n“doesn’t need reinforcement from ‘the idea of a\ntranscendental or enduring subject’” (Rorty 1982: 206) or\n“backup from a philosophy of history” (Rorty 1998: 243).\nOn the political dimension, pragmatist experimentalism allows for\nliberal hope—a hope for a “global, cosmopolitan,\ndemocratic, egalitarian, classless, casteless society” (Rorty\n1999: xii)—without grounding it in a historical teleology or an\nabstract utopianism. This liberalism also succeeds in capturing the\nattractive aspects of both Christianity and Marxism without succumbing\nto their metaphysical vices. \nThe most interesting aspect of Rorty’s theory is that the main\nvirtue he ascribes to hope (compared to knowledge) as a basis for\npolitics is that it “does not require foundations” (Rorty\net al. 2002b: 58) , and certain hopes may even be\n“unjustifiable” (Rorty 1982: 208). As Nicholas Smith\n(2005a) notes, Rorty does not intend this to designate an unjustified\nhope (hope for which there is no adequate justification, although such\njustification is possible). Rather, he must either mean a form of hope\nfor which the question of justification does not arise or a form of\nhope that is strictly unjustifiable in the same sense as hope for the\nimpossible. While there are traces of the latter sense to be found in\nRorty’s work (Smith 2005a: 94), he consistently seems to use the\nformer meaning in his political writings. But the absence of a need\nfor a metaphysical justification of hope does not imply that we cannot\nmake a distinction between more or less reasonable forms of hoping. As\nSmith (2005a: 95) further argues, Rorty acknowledges that hopelessness\nis always based on the absence of a narrative of political progress.\nFor this reason, if such a narrative is available, this seems to\nprovide rational support for political hope.","contact.mail":"titus.stahl@rug.nl","contact.domain":"rug.nl"}]
