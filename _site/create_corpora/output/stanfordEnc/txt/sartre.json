His indefatigable pursuit of philosophical\nreflection, literary creativity and, in the second half of his life,\nactive political commitment gained him worldwide renown, if not\nadmiration. He is commonly considered the father of Existentialist\nphilosophy, whose writings set the tone for intellectual life in the\ndecade immediately following the Second World War. Among the many\nironies that permeate his life, not the least is the immense popularity\nof his scandalous public lecture “Existentialism is a Humanism,”\ndelivered to an enthusiastic Parisian crowd October 28, 1945. Though\ntaken as a quasi manifesto for the Existentialist movement, the\ntranscript of this lecture was the only publication that Sartre openly\nregretted seeing in print. And yet it continues to be the major\nintroduction to his philosophy for the general public. One of the\nreasons both for its popularity and for his discomfort is the clarity\nwith which it exhibits the major tenets of existentialist thought while\nrevealing Sartre's attempt to broaden its social application in\nresponse to his Communist and Catholic critics. In other words, it\noffers us a glimpse of Sartre's thought “on the wing.”\n\n\n\nAfter surveying the evolution of Sartre's philosophical thinking, I\nshall address his thought under five categories, namely, ontology,\npsychology, ethics, political commitment, and the relation between\nphilosophy and the fine arts, especially literature, in his work. I\nshall conclude with several observations about the continued relevance\nof his thought in contemporary philosophy both Anglo-American and\n“Continental.”\n\n\n\nSartre was born in Paris where he spent most of his life. After a\ntraditional philosophical education in prestigious Parisian schools\nthat introduced him to the history of Western philosophy with a bias\ntoward Cartesianism and neoKantianism, not to mention a strong strain\nof Bergsonism, Sartre succeeded his former school friend, Raymond\nAron, at the French Institute in Berlin (1933–1934) where he read the\nleading phenomenologists of the day, Husserl, Heidegger and\nScheler. He prized Husserl's restatement of the principle of\nintentionality (all consciousness aims at or “intends” an\nother-than-consciousness) that seemed to free the thinker from the\ninside/outside epistemology inherited from Descartes while retaining\nthe immediacy and certainty that Cartesians prized so highly. What he\nread of Heidegger at that time is unclear, but he deals with the\ninfluential German ontologist explicitly after his return and\nespecially in his masterwork, Being and Nothingness\n(1943). He exploits the latter's version of Husserlian intentionality\nby insisting that human reality (Heidegger's Dasein or human\nway of being) is “in the world” primarily via its\npractical concerns and not its epistemic relationships. This lends\nboth Heidegger's and Sartre's early philosophies a kind of\n“pragmatist” character that Sartre, at least, will never\nabandon. It has been remarked that many of the Heideggerian concepts\nin Sartre's existentialist writings also occur in those of Bergson,\nwhose “Les Données immediates de la\nconscience” (Time and Free Will) Sartre once\ncredited with drawing him toward philosophy. But it is clear that\nSartre devoted much of his early philosophical attention to combating\nthe then influential Bergsonism and that mention of Bergson's name\ndecreases as that of Heidegger grows in Sartre's writings during the\n“vintage” existentialist years. Sartre seems to have read\nthe phenomenological ethicist Max Scheler, whose concept of the\nintuitive grasp of paradigm cases is echoed in Sartre's reference to\nthe “image” of the kind of person one should be that both\nguides and is fashioned by our moral choices. But where Scheler in the\nbest Husserlian fashion argues for the “discovery” of such\nvalue images, Sartre insists on their creation.  The properly\n“existentialist” version of phenomenology is already in\nplay. \n\nThough Sartre was not a serious reader of Hegel or Marx until during\nand after the war, like so many of his generation, he came under the\ninfluence of Kojève's Marxist and protoexistentialist\ninterpretation of Hegel, though he never attended his famous lectures\nin the 1930s as did Lacan and Merleau-Ponty. It was Jean Hyppolite's\ntranslation of and commentary on Hegel's Phenomenology of\nSpirit that marked Sartre's closer study of the seminal German\nphilosopher. This is especially evident in his posthumously published\nNotebooks for an Ethics written in 1947–48 to fulfill the\npromise of an “ethics of authenticity” made in Being and\nNothingness. That project was subsequently abandoned but the\nHegelian and Marxist presence became dominant in Sartre's next major\nphilosophical text, the Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960)\nand in an essay that came to serve as its Introduction, Search\nfor a Method (1957). Dilthey had dreamt of completing Kant's\nfamous triad with a fourth Kritik, namely, a critique of\nhistorical reason. Sartre pursued this project by combining a\nHegelian-Marxist dialectic with an Existentialist “psychoanalysis”\nthat incorporates individual responsibility into class relationships,\nthereby adding a properly Existentialist dimension of moral\nresponsibility to a Marxist emphasis on collective and structural\ncausality—what Raymond Aron would later criticize as an impossible\nunion of Kierkegaard and Marx. In the final analysis, Kierkegaard wins\nout; Sartre's “Marxism” remains adjectival to his existentialism and\nnot the reverse. This becomes apparent in the last phase of his\nwork. \n\nSartre had long been fascinated with the French novelist Gustave\nFlaubert. In what some would consider the culmination of his thought,\nhe weds Existentialist biography with Marxian social critique in a\nHegelian “totalization” of an individual and his era, to\nproduce the last of his many incompleted projects, a multi-volume\nstudy of Flaubert's life and times, The Family Idiot\n(1971–1972). In this work, Sartre joins his Existentialist\nvocabulary of the 1940s and early 1950s with his Marxian lexicon of\nthe late 1950s and 1960s to ask what we can know about a man in the\npresent state of our knowledge.  This study, which he describes as\n“a novel that is true,” incarnates that mixture of\nphenomenological description, psychological insight, and social\ncritique that has become the hallmark of Sartrean philosophy. These\nfeatures doubtless contributed to his being awarded the Nobel prize\nfor literature, which he characteristically refused along with its\nsubstantial cash grant lest his acceptance be read as approval of the\nbourgeois values that the honor seemed to emblemize. \n\nIn his last years, Sartre, who had lost the use of one eye in\nchildhood, became almost totally blind. Yet he continued to work with\nthe help of a tape recorder, producing with Benny Lévy portions\nof a “co-authored” ethics, the published parts of which\nindicate, in the eyes of many, that its value may be more biographical\nthan philosophical. \n\nAfter his death, thousands spontaneously joined his funeral\ncortège in a memorable tribute to his respect and esteem among\nthe public at large. As the headline of one Parisian newspaper\nlamented: “France has lost its conscience.” \n\nLike Husserl and Heidegger, Sartre distinguished ontology from\nmetaphysics and favored the former. In his case, ontology is primarily\ndescriptive and classificatory, whereas metaphysics purports to be\ncausally explanatory, offering accounts about the ultimate origins and\nends of individuals and of the universe as a whole. Unlike Heidegger,\nhowever, Sartre does not try to combat metaphysics as a deleterious\nundertaking. He simply notes in a Kantian manner that it raises\nquestions we cannot answer. On the other hand, he subtitles Being\nand Nothingness a “Phenomenological Ontology.” Its descriptive\nmethod moves from the most abstract to the highly concrete. It begins\nby analyzing two distinct and irreducible categories or kinds of\nbeing: the in-itself (en-soi) and the for-itself\n(pour-soi), roughly the nonconscious and consciousness\nrespectively, adding a third, the for-others (pour-autrui),\nlater in the book. He concludes with a sketch of the practice of\n“existential psychoanalysis” that interprets our actions to uncover\nthe fundamental project that unifies our lives. \n\nBeing-in-itself and being-for-itself have mutually exclusive\ncharacteristics and yet we (human reality) are entities that combine\nboth, which is the ontological root of our ambiguity. The in-itself is\nsolid, self-identical, passive and inert. It simply “is.” The\nfor-itself is fluid, nonself-identical, and dynamic. It is the\ninternal negation or “nihilation” of the in-itself, on which it\ndepends. Viewed more concretely, this duality is cast as “facticity”\nand “transcendence.” The “givens” of our situation such as our\nlanguage, our environment, our previous choices and our very selves in\ntheir function as in-itself constitute our facticity. As conscious\nindividuals, we transcend (surpass) this facticity in what constitutes\nour “situation.” In other words, we are always beings “in situation,”\nbut the precise mixture of transcendence and facticity that forms any\nsituation remains indeterminable, at least while we are engaged in it.\nHence Sartre concludes that we are always “more” than our situation\nand that this is the ontological foundation of our freedom. We are\n“condemned” to be free, in his hyperbolic phrase. \n\nOne can see why Sartre is often described as a Cartesian dualist but\nthis is imprecise. Whatever dualism pervades his thought is one of\nspontaneity/inertia. His is not a “two substance” ontology like the\nthinking thing and the extended thing (mind and matter) of Descartes.\nOnly the in-itself is conceivable as substance or “thing.” The\nfor-itself is a no-thing, the internal negation of things. The\nprinciple of identity holds only for being-in-itself. The for-itself\nis an exception to this rule. Accordingly, time with all of its\nparadoxes is a function of the for-itself's nihilating or “othering”\nthe in-itself. The past is related to the future as in-itself to\nfor-itself and as facticity to possibility, with the present, like\n“situation” in general, being an ambiguous mixture of both. This is\nSartre's version of Heidegger's “Ekstatic temporality,” the\nqualitative “lived” time of our concerns and practices, the time that\nrushes by or hangs heavy on our hands, rather than the quantitative\n“clock” time that we share with physical nature. \n\nThe category or ontological principle of the for-others comes into\nplay as soon as the other subject or Other appears on the scene. The\nOther cannot be deduced from the two previous principles but must be\nencountered. Sartre's famous analysis of the shame one experiences at\nbeing discovered in an embarrassing situation is a phenomenological\nargument (what Husserl called an “eidetic reduction”) of our awareness\nof another as subject. It carries the immediacy and the certainty that\nphilosophers demand of our perception of other “minds” without\nsuffering the weakness of arguments from analogy commonly used by\nempiricists to defend such knowledge. \n\nThe roles of consciousness and the in-itself in his earlier work are\nassumed by “praxis” (human activity in its material context) and the\n“practico-inert” respectively in the Critique of Dialectical\nReason. Praxis is dialectical in the Hegelian sense that it\nsurpasses and subsumes its other, the practico-inert. The latter, like\nthe in-itself, is inert but as “practico-” is the sedimentation of\nprevious praxes. Thus speech acts would be examples of praxis but\nlanguage would be practico-inert; social institutions are\npractico-inert but the actions they both foster and limit are\npraxes. \n\nThe Other in Being and Nothingness alienates or objectifies\nus (in this work Sartre seems to use these terms equivalently) and the\nthird party is simply this Other writ large. The “us” is objectified\nby an Other and hence has the ontological status of being-in-itself\nbut the collective subject or “we,” he insists, is simply a\npsychological experience. In the Critique another ontological\nform appears, the “mediating” third, that denotes the group member as\nsuch and yields a collective subject without reducing the respective\nagents to mere ciphers of some collective consciousness. In other\nwords, Sartre accords an ontological primacy to individual praxis\nwhile recognizing its enrichment as group member of a praxis that\nsustains predicates such as command/obedience and right/duty that are\nproperly its own. The concepts of praxis, practico-inert and mediating\nthird form the basis of a social ontology that merits closer attention\nthan the prolix Critique encourages. \n\nSartre's gifts of psychological description and analysis are widely\nrecognized. What made him so successful a novelist and playwright\ncontributed to the vivacity and force of his phenomenological\n“arguments” as well. His early studies of emotive and\nimaging consciousness in the late 1930s press the Husserlian principle\nof intentionality farther than their author seemed willing to go. For\nexample, in The Psychology of Imagination (1940), Sartre\nargues that Husserl remains captive to the idealist principle of\nimmanence (the object of consciousness lies within consciousness),\ndespite his stated goal of combating idealism, when he seems to\nconsider images as miniatures of the perceptual object reproduced or\nretained in the mind. On the contrary, Sartre argues, if one insists\nthat all consciousness is intentional in nature, one must conclude\nthat even so-called “images” are not objects “in the\nmind” but are ways of relating to items “in the\nworld” in a properly imaginative manner, namely, by what he\ncalls “derealizing” them or rendering them\n“present-absent.” \n\nSimilarly, our emotions are not “inner states” but are ways of\nrelating to the world; they too are “intentional.” In this case,\nemotive behavior involves physical changes and what he calls a quasi\n“magical” attempt to transform the world by changing ourselves. The\nperson who gets “worked up” when failing to hit the golf ball or to\nopen the jar lid, is, on Sartre's reading, “intending” a world where\nphysiological changes “conjure up” solutions in the problematic world.\nThe person who literally “jumps for joy,” to cite another of his\nexamples, is trying by a kind of incantation to possess a good “all at\nonce” that can be realized only across a temporal spread. If emotion\nis a joke, he warns, it is a joke we believe in. These are all\nspontaneous, prereflective relations. They are not the products of\nreflective decision. Yet insofar as they are even prereflectively\nconscious, we are responsible for them. And this raises the question\nof freedom, a necessary condition for ascribing responsibility and the\nheart of his philosophy. \n\nThe basis of Sartrean freedom is ontological: we are free because we\nare not a self (an in-itself) but a presence-to-self (the\ntranscendence or “nihilation” of our self). This implies that we are\n“other” to our selves, that whatever we are or whatever others may\nascribe to us, we are “in the manner of not being it,” that is, in the\nmanner of being able to assume a perspective in its regard. This inner\ndistance reflects not only the nonself-identity of the for-itself and\nthe ekstatic temporality that it generates but forms the site of what\nSartre calls “freedom as the definition of man.” To that freedom\ncorresponds a coextensive responsibility. We are responsible for our\n“world” as the horizon of meaning in which we operate and thus for\neverything in it insofar as their meaning and value are assigned by\nvirtue of our life-orienting fundamental “choice.” At this point the\nontological and the psychological overlap while remaining distinct as\noccurs so often in phenomenology. \n\nSuch fundamental “choice” has been criticized as being criterionless\nand hence arbitrary. But it would be better to speak of it as\ncriterion-constituting in the sense that it grounds the set of criteria\non the basis of which our subsequent choices are made. It resembles\nwhat ethicist R. M. Hare calls “decisions of principle” (that\nestablish the principles for subsequent decisions but are themselves\nunprincipled) and what Kierkegaard would describe as “conversion.” In\nfact, Sartre sometimes employed this term himself to denote a radical\nchange in one's basic project. It is this original sustaining “choice”\nthat Existential psychoanalysis seeks to uncover. \n\nSartre's use of intentionality is the backbone of his psychology.  And\nhis psychology is the key to his ontology that is being fashioned at\nthis time. In fact, the concept of imaging consciousness as the locus\nof possibility, negativity and lack emerges as the model for\nconsciousness in general (being-for-itself) in Being and\nNothingness. That said, it would not be an exaggeration to\ndescribe Sartre as a philosopher of the imaginary, so important a role\ndoes imaging consciousness or its equivalent play in his work. \n\nSartre was a moralist but scarcely a moralizer. His earliest studies,\nthough phenomenological, underscored the freedom and by implication\nthe responsibility of the practitioner of the phenomenological method.\nThus his first major work, Transcendence of the Ego, in\naddition to constituting an argument against the transcendental ego\n(the epistemological subject that cannot be an object) central to\nGerman idealism and Hussserlian phenomenology, introduces an ethical\ndimension into what was traditionally an epistemological project by\nasserting that this appeal to a transcendental ego conceals a\nconscious flight from freedom. The phenomenological reduction that\nconstitutes the objects of consciousness as pure meanings or\nsignifications devoid of the existential claims that render them\nliable to skeptical doubt-such a reduction or “bracketing of the\nbeing question” carries a moral significance as well. The\n“authentic” subject, as Sartre will later explain in\nhis Notebooks for an Ethics, will learn to live without an\nego, whether transcendental or empirical, in the sense that the\ntranscendental ego is superfluous and the empirical ego (of scientific\npsychology) is an object for consciousness when it reflects on itself\nin an objectifying act that he calls “accessory reflection.” His works\ntake pains either to ascribe moral responsibility to agents\nindividually or collectively or to set the ontological foundations for\nsuch ascriptions. \n\nAuthenticity is achieved, Sartre claims, by a conversion that entails\nabandonment of our original choice to coincide with ourselves\nconsciously (the futile desire to be in-itself-for-itself or God) and\nthereby free ourselves from identification with our egos as\nbeing-in-itself. In our present alienated condition, we are\nresponsible for our egos as we are for any object of\nconsciousness. Earlier he said that it was bad faith\n(self-deception)to try to coincide with our egos since the fact is\nthat whatever we are we are in the manner of not being it due to the\n“othering” nature of consciousness. Now his mention of “conversion” to\nauthenticity via a “purifying”(non-objectifying) reflection elaborates\nthat authentic project. He insists that we must allow our spontaneous\n“selfness” (what he terms ipseity here and in  Being and\nNothingness) to replace the “Me” or Ego, which he criticizes as\nan “abusive intermediary” whose future prefigures my future. The shift\nis from relations of “appropriation” or being where I focus on\nidentifying with my ego in a bad-faith flight from freedom,to\nrelations of “existence” and autonomy where I attend entirely to my\nproject and its goal. The former is egoistic, Sartre now implies,\nwhere the latter is outgoing and generous. This resonates with what he\nwill say about the creative artist's work as a gift, an appeal to\nanother freedom and an act of generosity. \n\nIt is now common to distinguish three distinct ethical positions in\nSartre's writings. The first and best known, existentialist ethics is\none of disalienation and authenticity. It assumes that we live in a\nsociety of oppression and exploitation. The former is primary and\npersonal, the latter structural and impersonal. While he enters into\nextended polemics in various essays and journal articles of the late\n1940s and ‘50s concerning the systematic exploitation of people\nin capitalist and colonialist institutions, Sartre always sought a way\nto bring the responsibility home to individuals who could in principle\nbe named. As Merleau-Ponty observed, Sartre stressed oppression over\nexploitation, individual moral responsibility over structural\ncausation but without denying the importance of the latter. In fact,\nas his concept of freedom thickened from the ontological to the social\nand historical in the mid ‘40s, his appreciation of the\ninfluence of factical conditions in the exercise of freedom grew\napace. \n\nSartre's concept of authenticity, occasionally cited as the only\nexistentialist “virtue,” is often criticized as denoting more a style\nthan a content. Admittedly, it does seem compatible with a wide\nvariety of life choices. Its foundation, again, is ontological-the\nbasic ambiguity of human reality that “is what it is not” (that is,\nits future as possibility) and “is not what it is” (its past as\nfacticity, including its ego or self, to which we have seen it is\nrelated via an internal negation). We could say that authenticity is\nfundamentally living this ontological truth of one's situation,\nnamely, that one is never identical with one's current state but\nremains responsible for sustaining it. Thus, the claim “that's just the\nway I am” would constitute a form of self-deception or bad faith as\nwould all forms of determinism, since both instances involve lying to\noneself about the ontological fact of one's nonself-coincidence and\nthe flight from concomitant responsibility for “choosing” to remain\nthat way. \n\nGiven the fundamental division of the human situation into facticity\nand transcendence, bad faith or inauthenticity can assume two\nprincipal forms: one that denies the freedom or transcendence\ncomponent (“I can't do anything about it”) and the other that ignores\nthe factical dimension of every situation (“I can do anything by just\nwishing it”).  The former is the more prevalent form of self deception\nbut the latter is common to people who lack a sense of the real in\ntheir lives. \n\nSartre sometimes talks as if any choice could be authentic so long as\nit is lived with a clear awareness of its contingency and\nresponsibility. But his considered opinion excludes choices that\noppress or consciously exploit others. In other words, authenticity is\nnot entirely style; there is a general content and that content is\nfreedom. Thus the “authentic Nazi” is explicitly disqualified as being\noxymoronic. Sartre's thesis is that freedom is the implicit object of\nany choice, a claim he makes but does not adequately defend in his\nHumanism lecture. He seems to assume that “freedom” is the aspect under which any choice is made, its “formal object,” to revive an ancient term. But a stronger argument than that would be required to disqualify an “authentic” Nazi. \n\nThough critical of its bourgeois variety, Sartre does support an\nexistentialist humanism, the motto of which could well be his remark\nthat “you can always make something out of what you've been made\ninto” (Situations 9:101). In fact, his entire career could be summarized in these words\nthat carry an ethical as well as a critical message. The first part of\nhis professional life focused on the freedom of the existential\nindividual (you can always make something out of…); the second\nconcentrated on the socioeconomic and historical conditions which\nlimited and modified that freedom (what you've been made into), once\nfreedom ceased to be merely the definition of “man” and included the\npossibility of genuine options in concrete situations. That phase\ncorresponded to Sartre's political commitment and active involvement\nin public debates, always in search of the exploitative “systems” such\nas capitalism, colonialism and racism at work in society and the\noppressive practices of individuals who sustained them. As he grew\nmore cognizant of the social dimension of individual life, the\npolitical and the ethical tended to coalesce. In fact, he explicitly\nrejected “Machiavellianism.” \n\nIf Sartre's first and best known ethics corresponds to the ontology of\nBeing and Nothingness, his second, “dialectical” ethics\nbuilds on the philosophy of history developed in the Critique of\nDialectical Reason. In a series of posthumously published notes for lectures\nin the 1960s, some of which were never delivered, Sartre sketched a\ntheory of ethics based on the concepts of human need and the ideal of\n“integral man” in contrast with its counter-concept, the\n“subhuman.”What this adds to his published ethics is a more specific\ncontent and a keener sense of the social conditions for living a\nproperly human life. \n\nSartre's third attempt at an ethics, which he called an ethics of the\n“we,” was undertaken in interview format with his\nsecretary, Benny Lévy, toward the end of his life. It purports\nto question many of the main propositions of his ethics of\nauthenticity, yet what has appeared in print chiefly elaborates claims\nalready stated in his earlier works.  But since the tapes on which\nthese remarks were recorded are unavailable to the public and Sartre's\nillness at the time they were made was serious, their authority as\nrevisionary of his general philosophy remains doubtful. If ever\nreleased in its entirety, this text will constitute a serious\nhermeneutical challenge. \n\nSartre was not politically involved in the 1930s though his heart, as\nhe said, “was on the left, like everyone's.” The War years, occupation\nand resistance made the difference. He emerged committed to social\nreform and convinced that the writer had the obligation to address the\nsocial issues of the day. He founded the influential journal of\nopinion, Les Temps modernes, with his partner Simone de\nBeauvoir, as well as Merleau-Ponty, Raymond Aron and others.  In the\n“Présentation” to the initial issue (October, 1945),\nhe elaborated his idea of committed literature and insisted that\nfailure to address political issues amounted to supporting the status\nquo. After a brief unsuccessful attempt to help organize a\nnonCommunist leftist political organization, he began his long\nlove-hate relationship with the French Communist Party, which he never\njoined but which for years he considered the legitimate voice of the\nworking class in France. This continued till the Soviet invasions of\nHungary in 1956.  Still, Sartre continued to sympathize with the movement,\nif not the Party, for some time afterwards. He summarized his\ndisillusionment in an essay “The Communists are afraid of Revolution,”\nfollowing the “events of May,” 1968. By then he had moved toward the\nradical Left and what the French labeled “les Maos,” whom he likewise\nnever joined but whose mixture of the ethical and the political\nattracted him. \n\nPolitically, Sartre tended toward what the French call “libertarian\nsocialism,” which is a kind of anarchism. Ever distrustful of\nauthority, which he considered “the Other in us,” his ideal was a\nsociety of voluntary eye-level relations that he called “the city of\nends.” One caught a glimpse of this in his description of the forming\ngroup (le groupe en fusion) in the Critique. There\neach was “the same” as the others in terms of practical concern. Each\nsuspended his or her personal interests for the sake of the common\ngoal. No doubt these practices hardened into institutions and freedom\nwas compromised once more in bureaucratic machinery. But that brief\ntaste of genuine positive reciprocity was revelatory of what an\nauthentic social existence could be. \n\nSartre came to recognize how the economic conditions the political in\nthe sense that material scarcity, as both Ricardo and Marx insisted,\ndetermines our social relations. In Sartre's reading, scarcity emerges\nas the source of structural and personal violence in human history as\nwe know it. It follows, he believes, that liberation from such violence will come\nonly through the counter violence of revolution and the advent of a\n“socialism of abundance.” \n\nWhat Sartre termed the “progressive/regressive method” for historical\ninvestigation is a hybrid of historical materialism and existentialist\npsychoanalysis. It respects the often decisive role of economic\nconsiderations in historical explanation (historical materialism)\nwhile insisting that “the men that History makes are not the men that\nmake history”; in other words, he resists complete economic\ndeterminism by implicit appeal to his humanist motto: “You can always\nmake something out of…” \n\nNever one to avoid a battle, Sartre became embroiled in the Algerian\nWar, generating deep hostility from the Right to the point that a bomb\nwas detonated at the entrance to his apartment building on two occasions by supporters\nof a French Algeria. Sartre's political critique conveyed in a series\nof essays, interviews and plays, especially The Condemned of\nAltona, once more combined a sense of structural exploitation (in\nthis case, the institution of colonialism and its attendant racism)\nwith an expression of moral outrage at the oppression of the Muslim\npopulation and the torture of captives by the French military. \n\nMention of the play reminds us of the role of imaginative art in\nSartre's philosophical work. This piece, whose chief protagonist is\nFrantz “the butcher of Smolensk,” though ostensibly about the effect\nof Nazi atrocities at the Eastern front on a postwar industrialist\nfamily in Hamburg, is really addressing the question of collective\nguilt and the French suppression of the Algerian war for independence\nraging at that time. Sartre often turned to literary art to convey or\neven to work through philosophical thoughts that he had already or\nwould later conceptualize in his essays and theoretical studies. Which\nbrings us to the relation between imaginative literature and\nphilosophy in his work. \n\nThe strategy of “indirect communication” has been an instrument of\n“Existentialists” since Kierkegaard adopted the use of pseudonyms in\nhis philosophical writings in the early nineteenth century. The point\nis to communicate a feeling and an attitude that the reader/spectator\nadopts in which certain existentialist themes such as anguish,\nresponsibility or bad faith are suggested but not dictated as in a\nlecture. Asked why his plays were performed only in the bourgeois\nsections of the city, Sartre replied that no bourgeois could leave a\nperformance of one of them without “thinking thoughts traitorous to\nhis class.” The so-called aesthetic “suspension of disbelief” coupled\nwith the tendency to identify with certain characters and to\nexperience their plight vicariously conveys conviction rather than\ninformation.  And this is what existentialism is chiefly about:\nchallenging the individual to examine their life for intimations of\nbad faith and to heighten their sensitivity to oppression and\nexploitation in their world. \n\nSartre's early work Nausea (1938) is the very model of a\nphilosophical novel. Its protagonist, Roquentin, works through many of\nthe major themes of Being and Nothingness that will appear\nfive years later. It can be read as an extended meditation on the\ncontingency of our existence and on the psychosomatic experience that\ncaptures that phenomenon. In his famous meditation on a tree root,\nRoquentin experiences the brute facticity of its existence and of his\nown: both are simply there, without justification, in excess (de\ntrop). The physicality of this revelatory “sickly sweet”\nsensation should not be overlooked. Like the embarrassment felt before\nthe Other's gaze in the voyeur example cited earlier, our bodily\nintentionality (what he calls “the body as for-itself”) is revealing\nan ontological reality. \n\nThe case at hand is an artistic way of conveying what Sartre in\nBeing and Nothingness will call “the phenomenon of being.” He\nagrees with the tradition that “being” or “to be” is not a\nconcept. But if not that, how is it to be indexed? What does it mean\n“to be”?  Sartre's existential phenomenology appeals to certain kinds\nof experience such as nausea and joy to articulate the\n“transphenomenal” character of being. Pace Kant, “being” does not\ndenote a realm behind the phenomena that the descriptive method\nanalyzes. Neither is it the object of an “eidetic” reduction (the\nphenomenological method that would grasp it as an essence). Rather,\nbeing accompanies all phenomena as their existential dimension. But\nthis dimension is revealed by certain experiences such as that of the\nutter contingency which Roquentin felt. This is scarcely\nrationalism, but neither is it mysticism.  Anyone can experience this\ncontingency and, once brought to reflective awareness, can ponder\nits implications. What this novel does imaginatively, Being and\nNothingness, subtitled “A Phenomenological Ontology,”\npursues conceptually, though with the aid of phenomenological\n“arguments,” as we have seen. \n\nIn a series of essays published as What is Literature?\n(1947), Sartre expounds his notion of “committed”\nliterature, a turn in his thought first indicated in the inaugural\nissue of Les Temps modernes two years earlier. Though steeped\nin the polemics of the day, this continues to be a seminal text of\ncriticism. It underscores what I have called the\n“pragmatist” dimension of Sartre's thought: writing is a\nform of acting in the world; it produces effects for which the author\nmust assume responsibility. Addressing the problem of “writing\nfor our time,” Sartre underscores the harsh facts of oppression\nand exploitation that were not erased by the upheaval of world\nwar. Ours remains “a society based on violence.”\nAccordingly, the author is responsible for addressing that violence\nwith a counter-violence (for example, by his choice of topics to\ndiscuss) or sharing in it by his silence. Drawing a distinction\nbetween prose, which can be committed, and “poetry”\n(basically nonrepresentational art such as music and poetry properly\nspeaking), which cannot—a distinction that will return to\nhaunt him—Sartre proceeds to urge that the prose-writer reveal\nthat man is a value to be invented each day and that “the\nquestions he raises are always moral” (203). A clear rejection\nof “art for art's sake,” Sartre insisted on the social\nresponsibility of the artist and the intellectual in general. \n\nThe artwork, for Sartre, has always carried a special power: that of\ncommunicating among freedoms without alienation or objectification. In\nthis sense, it has stood as an exception to the objectifying gaze of\nhis vintage existentialist texts. That relation between artist and\npublic via the work of art Sartre calls “gift-appeal.” In his The\nImaginary, he speaks of the portrait “inviting”\nthe viewer to realize its possibilities by regarding it aesthetically.\nBy the time he gathers these thoughts in What is Literature?\nand Notebooks for an Ethics, the concept of writing as an act\nof generosity to which the reader responds by an act of “re-creation”\nthat respects the mutuality of these freedoms—this gift/response model assumes\npolitical significance. It is offered as an example of positive reciprocity in the political realm. And, in fact, it anticipates the “free\nalterity” of the group member as analyzed in the Critique. In\nother words, Sartre's political and ethical values and concerns\nconjoin in the concept of committed literature. \n\nBefore concluding with a prognosis of Sartre's philosophical relevance\nin the twenty-first century, let me note the several “biographies”\nthat he produced of important literary figures in addition to his\nautobiography, Words. Each of these studies constitutes a\nform of existential psychoanalysis. The subject's literary production\nis submitted to a kind of “hermeneutic” in which the underlying\nlife-project is uncovered. He begins to employ the\nprogressive-regressive method in the late ‘50s whereby the\nhistorical and socioeconomic conditions of the subject are uncovered\nin a “regressive” argument from biographical and social facts to the\nconditions of their possibility followed by a “progressive” account of\nthe subjects process of “personalization.” The most extensive, if not\nthe most successful, of these “biographies” is his analysis of the\nlife and times of Gustave Flaubert, The Family Idiot. \n\nBut these biographies, almost exclusively about literary men, are also\nobject lessons in an “existentialist” theory of history. Their\nhallmark is an attempt to reconstruct the subject's project as his\nmanner of dialectically “totalizing” his epoch even as he is being\ntotalized by it. While connecting impersonal historical phenomena in\ntheir dialectical necessity (for example, the unintended consequences\ningredient in any historical account), these narratives are intent on\nconveying the subject's sense of the anguish of decision and the pinch\nof the real. In effect, biography is an essential part of an\nexistentialist approach to history and not a mere illustrative\nappendage. \n\nFoucault once dismissed Sartre testily as a man of the nineteenth\ncentury trying to think the twentieth. Presumably, he had more in mind\nthan the fact that most of Sartre's “biographies,” except for Jean Genet's and his own, were\nof nineteenth-century figures. With his emphasis on consciousness,\nsubjectivity, freedom, responsibility and the self, his commitment to\nMarxist categories and dialectical thinking, especially in the second\npart of his career, and his quasi Enlightenment humanism, Sartre\nseemed to personify everything that structuralists and\npoststructuralists like Foucault opposed. In effect, the enfant\nterrible of mid century France had become the “traditionalist”of\nthe following generation. A classic example of philosophical\nparricide. \n\nIn fact, some of this criticism was misdirected while other portions\nexhibit a genuine philosophical “choice” about goals and methods.\nThough Sartre resolutely insisted on the primacy of “free organic\npraxis” methodologically, ontologically, and ethically, on which he\nbased the freedom and responsibility that define his humanism, he\nrespected what his critic Louis Althusser called “structural\ncausality” and made allowance for it with his concept of the\npractico-inert. But it is the primacy awarded consciousness/praxis in\nthis regard that strikes structuralist and poststructuralist critics\nas naive and simply wrong. Added to this is Sartre's passion for\n“totalizing” thought, whether individually in terms of a life project\nor collectively in terms of dialectical rationality, that counters the\nfragmenting and anti-teleological claims of poststructuralist\nauthors. And then there is his famous denial of the Freudian\nunconscious and his relative neglect of semiotics and the philosophy of\nlanguage in general. \n\nOne should note that Sartre's suspicion of Freudian psychoanalysis\nbecame quite nuanced in his later years. His appeal to “the lived”\n(le vécu) and to pre-theoretical comprehension,\nespecially in his Flaubert study, for example, incorporated many\nfeatures of the “unconscious” drives and relations proper to\npsychoanalytic discourse. And while he was familiar with Saussure and\nstructural linguistics, to which he occasionally referred, he admitted\nthat he had never formulated an explicit philosophy of language but\ninsisted that one could be reconstructed from elements employed\nthroughout his work. \n\nBut at least five features of Sartre's thought seem particularly\nrelevant to current discussions among philosophers both Anglo-American\nand Continental. The first is his concept of the human agent as not a\nself but a “presence to self.” This opening up of\nthe Cartesian “thinking thing” supports a wide variety of\nalternative theories of the self while retaining the features of\nfreedom and responsibility that, one can argue, have been central\ntenets of Western philosophy and law since the Greeks. \n\nEmphasis on an ethics of responsibility in contrast to one of rules,\nprinciples or values in recent years has led to a wide-spread\ninterest in the work of Levinas as a necessary complement to so-called\n“postmodern” ethics. But Sartrean\n“authenticity” is equally relevant in this regard, as\nCharles Taylor and others have pointed out. And its location within a\nmundane ontology may resonate better with philosophers of a more\nsecular bent. \n\nNext, the recent revival of the understanding of philosophy as a\n“way of life” as distinct from an academic discipline\nfocused on epistemology or more recently on the philosophy of\nlanguage, while renewing an interest in Hellenistic ethics as well as\nin various forms of “spirituality,” can find in Sartrean\nexistentialism forms of “care of the self” that invite\nfruitful conversation with contemporary ethics, aesthetics and\npolitics without devolving into moralism, aestheticism or\nfanaticism. From a philosopher suspicious of moral recipes and focused\non concrete, lived experience, this is perhaps as much as one could\nexpect or desire. \n\nSartre dealt implicitly with issue of race in many of his works,\nbeginning with Being and Nothingness. Race relations,\nespecially segregation in the South, figured centrally in his reports\nfrom the United States during two visits after the War (1945 and 1946)\nand were a major topic of his many writings on colonialism and\nneocolonialism thereafter. It formed the theme of his play,\n“The Respectful Prostitute” (1946). He claimed that even as\na boy, whenever he heard of the French “colonies,” he\nthought of racial exploitation. He wrote in Black Orpheus\nabout the Africa poets using the colonizers' language against\nthem in their poems of liberation: “Black poetry in French is the\nonly great revolutionary poetry of our time.” He fulminated\nagainst the violence of colonialism and its implicit\n“justification” by appeal to the subhumanity of the native\npopulation. On several occasions in diverse works Sartre referred to\nthe cry of the oppressed and exploited: “We too are\nhumans!” as the guiding ideal of their fight for liberty. His\nexistential humanism grounded his critique of the capitalist and\ncolonialist “systems.” He wrote that “the meanness is\nin the system”—a claim that resonated with liberation\nmovements then and now. But his properly existentialist understanding\nof that phrase, respecting the ethical primacy of free organic praxis,\nrequires that he qualify the remark with “not entirely”;\nfor whatever system he speaks of rides on the backs of responsible\nindividuals, alone or more likely in social wholes, for whom moral\nresponsibility can and should be ascribed. This may serve as his lesson\nto the ontology and the ethics of race relations in the twenty-first\ncentury. His appeal for violence to counter the inherent violence of\nthe colonial system in Algeria reached hyperbolic proportions in his\nprefatory essay to Franz Fanon's The Wretched of the\nEarth (1961). \n\nOf the other topics in current philosophical discussions to which\nSartre offers relevant remarks, I would conclude by mentioning\nfeminism. This suggestion will certainly raise some eyebrows because\neven his fans admit that some of the images and language of his earlier\nwork were clearly sexist in character. And yet, Sartre always favored\nthe exploited and oppressed in any relationship and he encouraged his\nlife-long partner, Simone de Beauvoir, to write The Second\nSex, commonly recognized as the seminal work for the second-wave\nof the feminist movement. In addition to the plausible extrapolations\nof many remarks made apropos the exploitation of blacks and Arabs, just\nmentioned, I shall cite two concepts in Sartre's work that I\nbelieve carry particular promise for feminist arguments. \n\nThe first occurs in the short work Anti-Semite and Jew\n(1946). Many authors have mined this text for arguments critical of\n“masculinist” biases, but I wish to underscore the\n“spirit of synthesis” that Sartre champions there in\ncontrast with the “analytical spirit” that he criticizes.\nThe issue is whether the Jew should be respected legally in his\nconcrete Jewishness—his culture, his practices, including dietary\nand religious observances—or whether he should be satisfied with\nthe “Rights of Man and of the Citizen” as his analytic,\nliberal democratic “friend” proposes. The abstract,\nanalytic thinker counsels, in effect, “You enjoy all the rights\nof a French Citizen, just don't be so Jewish.” Sartre, on\nthe other hand, argues “synthetically” (concretely) for the\nrights of the Jew or the Arab or the woman (his examples) to vote\nas such in any election. In other words, their\n“rights” are concrete and not mere abstractions. One should\nnot sacrifice the Jew (or the Arab or the woman) to the\n“man.” In Michael Walzer's words: Sartre is\npromoting “multiculturalism…avant la\nlettre.” \n\nThe second concept that issues from Sartre's later writing\nwhich is of immediate relevance to feminist thought is that of\npositive reciprocity and its attendant notion of\ngenerosity. We are familiar with the conflictual nature of\ninterpersonal relations in Sartre's vintage existentialist\nwritings: “Hell is other people” and the like. But in his\naesthetic writings and in the Notebooks for an Ethics, he\ndescribes the artist's work as a generous act, an invitation from\none freedom to another. He even suggests that this might serve as a\nmodel for interpersonal relations in general. And in his major work in\nsocial ontology, the Critique of Dialectical Reason, Sartre\ncharts the move from objectifying and alienating relationships (series)\nto the positive reciprocity of the group members. Some\nfeminist authors have employed these Sartrean concepts in their\narguments. There remains much still to extract from Sartre's\nlater works in this area. \n\nAs Sartrean existentialism frees itself from the limitations\nof its post-war adolescence and shows its mature psychological,\nontological and ethical face to the new century, it enters with adult\nstanding into the ongoing conversation that we call Western philosophy.\nIts relevance remains as actual today as does the human condition that\nit describes and analyzes.","contact.mail":"tflynn@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"}]
