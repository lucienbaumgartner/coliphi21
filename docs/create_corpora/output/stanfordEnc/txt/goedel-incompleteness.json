They concern the limits of provability in formal\naxiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem states that in\nany consistent formal system \\(F\\) within which a certain amount of\narithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language of\n\\(F\\) which can neither be proved nor disproved in \\(F\\).\nAccording to the second incompleteness theorem, such a formal system\ncannot prove that the system itself is consistent (assuming it is\nindeed consistent). These results have had a great impact on the\nphilosophy of mathematics and logic. There have been attempts to apply\nthe results also in other areas of philosophy such as the philosophy\nof mind, but these attempted applications are more controversial. The\npresent entry surveys the two incompleteness theorems and various\nissues surrounding them. (See also the entry on\n Kurt Gödel\n for a discussion of the incompleteness theorems that contextualizes\nthem within a broader discussion of his mathematical and philosophical\nwork.)\n\nGödel’s incompleteness theorems are among the most\nimportant results in modern logic. These discoveries revolutionized\nthe understanding of mathematics and logic, and had dramatic\nimplications for the philosophy of mathematics. There have also been\nattempts to apply them in other fields of philosophy, but the\nlegitimacy of many such applications is much more controversial. \nIn order to understand Gödel’s theorems, one must first\nexplain the key concepts essential to it, such as “formal\nsystem”, “consistency”, and\n“completeness”. Roughly, a formal system is a\nsystem of axioms equipped with rules of inference, which allow one to\ngenerate new theorems. The set of axioms is required to be finite or\nat least decidable, i.e., there must be an algorithm (an effective\nmethod) which enables one to mechanically decide whether a given\nstatement is an axiom or not. If this condition is satisfied, the\ntheory is called “recursively axiomatizable”, or, simply,\n“axiomatizable”. The rules of inference (of a formal\nsystem) are also effective operations, such that it can always be\nmechanically decided whether one has a legitimate application of a\nrule of inference at hand. Consequently, it is also possible to decide\nfor any given finite sequence of formulas, whether it constitutes a\ngenuine derivation, or a proof, in the system—given the axioms\nand the rules of inference of the system. \nA formal system is complete if for every statement of the\nlanguage of the system, either the statement or its negation can be\nderived (i.e., proved) in the system. A formal system is\nconsistent if there is no statement such that the statement\nitself and its negation are both derivable in the system. Only\nconsistent systems are of any interest in this context, for it is an\nelementary fact of logic that in an inconsistent formal system every\nstatement is derivable, and consequently, such a system is trivially\ncomplete. \nGödel established two different though related incompleteness\ntheorems, usually called the first incompleteness theorem and the\nsecond incompleteness theorem. “Gödel’s\ntheorem” is sometimes used to refer to the conjunction of these\ntwo, but may refer to either—usually the first—separately.\nAccommodating an improvement due to J. Barkley Rosser in 1936, the\nfirst theorem can be stated, roughly, as follows: \nFirst incompleteness theorem\n\nAny consistent formal system \\(F\\) within which a certain amount of\nelementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there\nare statements of the language of \\(F\\) which can neither be proved\nnor disproved in \\(F\\).\n \nGödel’s theorem does not merely claim that such statements\nexist: the method of Gödel’s proof explicitly produces a\nparticular sentence that is neither provable nor refutable in\n\\(F\\); the “undecidable” statement can be found\nmechanically from a specification of \\(F\\). The sentence in\nquestion is a relatively simple statement of number theory, a purely\nuniversal arithmetical sentence. \nA common misunderstanding is to interpret Gödel’s first\ntheorem as showing that there are truths that cannot be proved. This\nis, however, incorrect, for the incompleteness theorem does not deal\nwith provability in any absolute sense, but only concerns derivability\nin some particular formal system or another. For any statement\n\\(A\\) unprovable in a particular formal system \\(F\\), there are,\ntrivially, other formal systems in which \\(A\\) is provable (take\n\\(A\\) as an axiom). On the other hand, there is the extremely\npowerful standard axiom system of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (denoted\nas ZF, or, with the axiom of choice,\nZFC; see the section on the axioms of ZFC in the\nentry on\n set theory),\n which is more than sufficient for the derivation of all ordinary\nmathematics. Now there are, by Gödel’s first theorem,\narithmetical truths that are not provable even in\nZFC. Proving them would thus require a formal system\nthat incorporates methods going beyond ZFC. There is\nthus a sense in which such truths are not provable using today’s\n“ordinary” mathematical methods and axioms, nor can they\nbe proved in a way that mathematicians would today regard as\nunproblematic and conclusive.  \nGödel’s second incompleteness theorem concerns the limits\nof consistency proofs. A rough statement is: \nSecond incompleteness theorem\n\nFor any consistent system \\(F\\) within which a certain amount of\nelementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of \\(F\\)\ncannot be proved in \\(F\\) itself.\n \nIn the case of the second theorem, \\(F\\) must contain a little bit\nmore arithmetic than in the case of the first theorem, which holds\nunder very weak conditions. It is important to note that this result,\nlike the first incompleteness theorem, is a theorem about formal\nprovability, or derivability (which is always relative to some formal\nsystem; in this case, to \\(F\\) itself). It does not say anything\nabout whether, for a particular theory \\(T\\) satisfying the\nconditions of the theorem, the statement “\\(T\\) is\nconsistent” can be proved in the sense of being shown to be true\nby a conclusive argument, or by a proof generally acceptable for\nmathematicians. For many theories, this is perfectly possible. \nThe existence of incomplete theories is hardly surprising. Take any\ntheory, even a complete one (see below for examples), and drop some\naxiom; unless the axiom is redundant, the resulting system is\nincomplete. The incompleteness theorems, however, deal with a much\nmore radical kind of incompleteness phenomenon. Unlike the above sort\nof trivially incomplete theories, which can be easily completed, there\nis no way of completing the relevant theories; all their extensions,\ninasmuch as they are still formal systems and hence axiomatizable, are\nalso incomplete. They remain, so to speak, eternally incomplete and\ncan never be completed. They are “essentially incomplete”.\n \nIn the first and loose statements of the incompleteness theorems given\nabove, the vague requirement that “a certain amount of\nelementary arithmetic can be carried out” occurred. It is time\nto make this more precise. \nThe weakest standard system of arithmetic that is usually considered\nin connection with incompleteness and undecidability is so-called\nRobinson arithmetic (due to Raphael M. Robinson; see Tarski, Mostowski\nand Robinson 1953), standardly denoted as Q. As\naxioms, it has the following seven assumptions: \nThe intended interpretation of\n“\\(x'\\)” is the successor\nfunction, and obviously, of + and \\(\\times\\), the addition and the\nmultiplication functions, respectively. “0” is the only\nconstant and denotes the number zero. \nAdding to these elementary axioms the axiom scheme of induction: \nresults in (first order) Peano Arithmetic (PA). Note\nthat unlike Q, PA contains\ninfinitely many axioms, because all (infinitely many) instances of the\ninduction scheme, one corresponding to every formula \\(\\phi(x)\\)\n(with at least one free variable) of the language, are taken as\naxioms. But it is a routine mechanical task to check whether a given\nsentence is an instance of this scheme. PA is\ngenerally taken as the standard first-order system of arithmetic. \nAnother natural and much-studied arithmetical system, which lies\nbetween Q and PA in strength, is\nPrimitive Recursive Arithmetic (PRA). It contains not\njust the above axioms of Q governing successor,\naddition and multiplication, but also defining axioms for all\nprimitive recursive functions (see the entry on\n recursive functions),\n and the application of the induction scheme is restricted to\nquantifier-free formulas (i.e., \\(\\phi(x)\\) is not allowed to\ncontain any (unbounded) quantifiers). \nHowever, essentially the same system is obtained if one takes just the\naxioms of Q and the induction scheme restricted to,\nroughly, purely existential formulas (in technical terms,\n \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formulas;\nsee below) (this was\nfirst showed by Parsons 1970). Moreover, \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-induction\ncan be shown (Paris and Kirby 1978) to be equivalent to the induction\nscheme restricted to (roughly) purely universal formulas \\((\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-formulas).\nPRA\ncan also be formulated as a “logic-free” equational\ncalculus. PRA, or something equivalent to it, is\nsufficient for developing the theory of syntax for formalized\ntheories. It is often taken as the unproblematic background theory in\nwhich various other systems, whose legitimacy may be more\ncontroversial, are studied. \nA much stronger system than PA, important in the\nfoundations of mathematics, which will be mentioned now and then\nbelow, is second-order arithmetic PA\\(^2\\)\n(also often denoted by Z\\(_2\\)). It is more\nthan sufficient for developing all ordinary analysis and algebra. Its\nlanguage is a two-sorted first-order language (see the entry on\n second-order and higher-order logic),\n i.e., it contains two sorts of variables, number variables\n\\(x_1,x_2,\\ldots\\) (or \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\)) and property variables \\(X_1,\nX_2,\\ldots\\) (or \\(X, Y, Z,\\ldots)\\), where properties are extensionally conceived.\nAs axioms it includes, in addition to the basic axioms of\nPA, all instances of the second-order comprehension\nscheme: \nwhere \\(\\phi(x)\\) can be any formula of the language of\nPA\\(^2\\) in which \\(X\\) doesn’t occur\nfree. (It should be mentioned that PA\\(^2\\) can\nalso be formulated by adding the primitive notion of \nset membership \\((\\in)\\) to the language, regarding the variables\n\\(X, Y, Z,\\ldots\\), as explicitly ranging\nover sets, and reformulating second-order comprehension as\n\\(\\exists X\\forall x[x \\in X \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x)\\)].) \nPA\\(^2\\) is a very strong theory. Via the\nmethod of interpretations (see below), one can show that it is\nproof-theoretically as strong as the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\nZFC without the power-set axiom, call it\nZFC–Pow (whereas the standard, first-order\nPA is similarly proof-theoretically equivalent to\nZFC without the axiom of infinity,\nZFC–Inf). (Cf. the section on the axioms of ZFC\nin the entry on\n set theory.) \nObviously, it is assumed that our formal systems are also equipped\nwith a system of rules of inferences (and possibly some logical\naxioms), usually some standard system of classical logic (though the\nincompleteness theorems do not essentially presuppose classical logic,\nbut also apply to systems with, e.g., intuitionistic logic). The above\nstandard systems all come with classical logic. The standard notation\n\\(F \\vdash A\\) is used to express (in the meta-level) that\n\\(A\\) is derivable in \\(F\\), that is, that there is a proof of\n\\(A\\) in \\(F\\), or, in other words, that \\(A\\) is a\ntheorem of \\(F\\). Accordingly, \\(F \\not\\vdash A\\)\nmeans that \\(A\\) is not derivable in \\(F\\). \nTo summarize: when it is said, in the context of the incompleteness\ntheorems, that “a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be\ncarried out” in a system, this usually means that it contains\nPRA or at least Q. For the first\nincompleteness theorem, Q is sufficient; for the\nstandard proofs of the second theorem, something like\nPRA, at a minimum, is needed. There is a version of\nthe second incompleteness theorem for Q (see\nBezboruah & Shepherdson 1976) but there has been some debate on\nwhether the relevant statement in Q can really be\ntaken to express consistency, Q being so weak (see\nKreisel 1958; Bezboruah & Shepherdson 1976; Pudlák 1996;\nFranks 2009). \nOf course, there are many important and interesting theories in\nmathematics which are not even formulated in the language of\narithmetic. However, the applicability of the incompleteness theorems\ncan be dramatically extended outside the language of first-order\narithmetic and its extensions, when it is noted that all that is\nneeded is that weak theories such as Q, or\nPRA, can be interpreted in the system in\nquestion. Most importantly, this involves various systems of set\ntheory. For example, the incompleteness theorems hold for\nZFC–Inf (i.e., ZFC without the\naxiom of infinity) and all its extensions, however strong (as long as\nthey are axiomatizable.) \nRoughly, a theory \\(T_1\\) is interpretable in another\ntheory \\(T_2\\) if the primitive concepts and the range of\nthe variables of \\(T_1\\) are definable in\n\\(T_2\\) so that it is possible to translate every theorem\nof \\(T_1\\) into a theorem of \\(T_2\\). One\nshould not misunderstand such interpretations as providing anything\nlike intuitive synonymity. Two theories may have radically different\nintended subject matter and yet, as formal systems, one may be\ninterpretable in another. (As an illustration: a simple theory of\nancestors may be, taken as a formal system, interpreted in arithmetic;\nobviously this does not mean that grandmothers and such are really\nnumbers.) What is significant is that interpretability preserves\ncertain elementary formal properties of theories, most\nimportantly, consistency: if \\(T_1\\) is interpretable in\n\\(T_2\\) and \\(T_2\\) is consistent,\n\\(T_1\\) is also consistent. And any system in which\nQ can be interpreted is guaranteed to be essentially\nincomplete. For any such theory in which Q is\ninterpretable, the incompleteness could be proved also directly; for\nexample, in various theories of set theory, one can code formulas and\nderivations (instead of numbers) by sets, “Gödel\nsets”, and proceed then as usual (see, e.g., Fitting 2007).\nHowever, for most purposes, it is just much simpler to establish the\ninterpretability of Q in the theory at issue. \nIn sum, when it is said that “a certain amount of elementary\narithmetic can be carried out within a system”, what is meant is\neither that the system is an axiomatizable extension of\nQ, or that Q can be interpreted in\nit. (In the case of (the standard proofs of) the second incompleteness\ntheorem, substitute PRA for Q.) \nOn the other hand, not all theories of arithmetic are incomplete. The\ntheory of only addition of natural numbers but without multiplication\n(often called “Presburger arithmetic”), for example, is\ncomplete (and decidable) (Presburger 1929), as is the theory of\nmultiplication of the positive integers (Skolem 1930). These theories\nare, though, very weak. But in any case, at least a theory which deals\nwith both addition and multiplication is needed. More interestingly,\nthe natural first-order theory of arithmetic of real numbers\n(with both addition and multiplication), the so-called theory of real\nclosed fields \\((\\mathbf{RCF})\\), is both complete and decidable,\nas was shown by Tarski (1948); he also demonstrated that the\nfirst-order theory of Euclidean geometry is complete and decidable.\nThus, one should keep in mind that there are some non-trivial and\ninteresting theories to which Gödel’s theorems do not\napply. \nGödel originally only established the incompleteness of a\nparticular though very comprehensive formalized theory\nP, a variant of Russell’s type-theoretical\nsystem PM (for Principia Mathematica, see the\nsections on Paradoxes and Russell’s Type Theories in the entries\non\n type theory\n and\n Principia Mathematica),\n and all extension of P with the same language, whose\nset of axioms is primitive recursive. He also suggested, though did\nnot demonstrate, that the proof could be adapted to apply also to the\nstandard axiom systems of set theory such as ZFC.\nThough it turns out that Gödel in fact already had a very general\nresult, it was, at the time, unclear just how general this really was\n(see also\n Section 5). \nWhat was still missing was an analysis of the intuitive notion of\ndecidability, needed in the characterization of the notion of an\narbitrary formal system. Recall that the set of axioms and the proof\nrelation of a formalized system are required to be decidable.\nMathematicians and logicians have implicitly used the intuitive notion\nof a decision method since antiquity, and as long as one asked for a\npositive solution, it was sufficient that one presented a concrete\nmethod that intuitively striked everyone as a mechanical method. For\nthe general limitative results, such as the general incompleteness\ntheorems, or the undecidability results (see\n 4.2),\n however, a precise mathematical explication of the notion would be\nneeded. Instead of decidable sets or properties, one often considers\neffective or computable functions or operations, but in fact these are\njust two sides of the same coin—talk of one can be easily\ntranscribed to talk of another. \nGödel (1934), Alonzo Church (1936a, b) and Alan Turing\n(1936–7) came up independently with different proposals for an\nexact mathematical definition of computable functions, and\nconsequently, of decidable sets (of numbers). These proposals, though,\nall turned out to be equivalent. Turing’s careful conceptual\nanalysis which used fictional and abstract computing machines\n(nowadays conventionally called “Turing machines”; see the\nentry on\n Turing machines)\n was particularly important, as Gödel himself emphasized (see,\ne.g., Gödel 1963). The equation of the intuitive notion and some\nof these mathematical explications is often called “The\nChurch-Turing-thesis”. The label “recursive\nfunction” has, for historical reasons, been dominant in the\nlogical literature. Consequently, decidable sets are often called\n“recursive sets”. (See the entries on\n computability,\n recursive functions and\n the Church-Turing thesis.) \nFor a proper understanding of the incompleteness and undecidability\nresults, it is vital to understand the difference between the two key\nnotions regarding sets. First, there may be a mechanical method which\ndecides whether any given number belongs to the set at issue or not\n(in which case the set is called “decidable” or\n“recursive”), and, second, there may be a mechanical\nmethod which generates or lists the elements of the set, number by\nnumber. In the latter case, the set is called “recursively\nenumerable” (r.e.), that is to say, it can be effectively\ngenerated, or it is “semi-decidable.” It is a fundamental\nresult of the theory of computability (or “the theory of\nrecursive functions”) that there are semi-decidable sets, sets\nwhich can be effectively generated (i.e., are recursively enumerable),\nbut are not decidable (i.e., not recursive). In fact, this is,\nin the very abstract level, the essence of the first incompleteness\ntheorem. However, if both a set and its complement are recursively\nenumerable, the set is recursive, i.e., decidable. \nIn this section, the main lines of the proof of the first\nincompleteness theorem are sketched. A reader interested in more\ndetails can consult the Supplements\n (Gödel Numbering\n and\n The Diagonalization Lemma). \nThe formal term (“numeral”) canonically denoting the\nnatural number \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) is abbreviated as\n\\(\\underline{n}\\). In the standard language of arithmetic used here,\nthe number \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) is denoted by the term\n\\(0^{\\prime\\cdots\\prime}\\), where the successor symbol\n‘\\('\\)’ is iterated \\(n\\) times. That is, numerals which\nname 1, 2, 3, … are \\(0', 0'', 0''',\\ldots\\) and are\nabbreviated by 1, 2, 3, … \nIn his original proof, Gödel used his specific notion of\n\\(\\omega\\)-consistency, and for some purposes, it is still convenient to\nfollow Gödel’s original approach. A formalized theory\n\\(F\\) is \\(\\omega\\)-consistent if it is not the case\nthat for some formula \\(A(x)\\), both \\(F \\vdash \\neg A(\\underline{n})\\) for all \n\\(\\mathbf{n}\\), and\n\\(F \\vdash \\exists xA(x)\\). Naturally this implies\nnormal consistency, and follows from the assumption that the natural\nnumbers satisfy the axioms of \\(F\\). \nActually, a simple special case of \\(\\omega\\)-consistency suffices\nhere; namely, the assumption is only needed with respect to what\nlogicians call \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formulas;\nthese are, roughly, the\npurely existential formulas; more exactly, formulas of the form\n\\(\\exists x_1\\exists x_2 \\ldots \\exists x_n A\\),\nwhere \\(A\\) does not contain any unbounded quantifiers \\((A\\)\nmay contain bounded universal quantifiers \\(\\forall x \\lt t\\) and bounded\nexistential quantifiers \\(\\exists x \\lt t)\\). This restricted \\(\\omega\\)-consistency is called\n1-consistency. \n\\(\\omega\\)-consistency and 1-consistency are purely syntactic\nnotions. If the use of the notions of truth and falsity is allowed,\nthe assumption of 1-consistency can be expressed intuitively simply as\nthe requirement that the formal system in question does not prove any\nfalse \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-sentences\n(i.e., the system is\nsound at least in the case of such sentences). From now on, it\nis assumed that the formalized systems under consideration contain\nQ and are assumed to be at least 1-consistent, unless\notherwise stated.  \nGödel’s proof also requires the notion of representability\nof sets and relations in a formal system \\(F\\). More precisely, two\nrelated notion are needed. \nA set \\(S\\) of natural numbers is strongly\nrepresentable in \\(F\\) if there is a formula\n\\(A(x)\\) of the language of \\(F\\) with one free variable\n\\(x\\) such that for every natural number\n\\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\): \nA set \\(S\\) of natural numbers is weakly\nrepresentable in \\(F\\) if there is a formula\n\\(A(x)\\) of the language of \\(F\\) such that for every\nnatural number \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\): \nIt is obvious how all these notions are generalized to many-place\nrelations. There are also related notions of representability for\nfunctions. As the incompleteness results in particular teach us, there\nare sets which are only weakly but not strongly representable (the key\nexample being the set of statements provable in the system). \n[Warning: Here the terminology in the literature\nvaries a lot: “strongly represent” is sometimes called,\ne.g., “represent”, “numeralwise express”,\n“bi-numerate”, “define” or “strongly\ndefine”; “weakly represent” is in turn also\nexpressed, e.g., by “represent”, “define”,\n“weakly define”, or “numerate”. One should be\ncareful here and focus on the relevant definitions, and not let the\nwords mislead.] \nIn the case of both kinds of representability (weak and strong), there\nis always a simple existential \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formula,\nwhich (weakly or strongly) represents the set in question, and usually\nsuch a formula is used to represent \\(S\\). \nThough these notions are relative to the formal system, it has turned\nout that strong and weak representability are extremely stable. Quite\nindependently of the particular formal system chosen, exactly the\ndecidable, or recursive, sets (relations) are strongly representable,\nand exactly the semi-decidable, or recursively enumerable sets\n(relations) are weakly representable. This holds for all formalized\nsystems which contain Robinson arithmetic Q, from\nRobinson arithmetic itself to the strongest axioms systems of set\ntheory like ZFC and beyond (as long as they are\n(recursively) axiomatizable). Instead of using the notion of\n“representability”, Gödel took a different approach\nby speaking of sets being “decidable in a formal system\n\\(F\\)” (“entscheidungsdefinit”). If the\nproofs of \\(F\\) are systematically generated, it will be eventually\ndetermined, for any given number \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\), whether it\nbelongs to \\(S\\) or not—given that \\(S\\) is strongly\nrepresentable in \\(F\\).  \nIn sum, we have: \nBoth notions of representability—strong and weak—must be\nclearly distinguished from mere definability (in the standard\nsense of the word). A set \\(S\\) is definable in the language\nof arithmetic if there is a formula \\(A(x)\\) in the language\nsuch that \\(A(\\underline{n})\\) is true in the standard structure\nof natural numbers (the intended interpretation) if and only if\n\\(\\boldsymbol{n} \\in S.\\) There are many sets which\ncan be defined in the language of arithmetic but not (even weakly)\nrepresented in any \\(F\\), such as the set of consistent formulas,\nthe set of sentences unprovable in the system \\(F\\), or the set of\nDiophantine equations with no solutions (see below). \nThe next essential step of Gödel’s proof is to take the\nlanguage of a formal system, which is always precisely defined (this\nis part of being a formal system), and fix a correspondence of a\ncertain kind between the expressions of that language and the system\nof natural numbers—a coding, “arithmetization”, or\n“Gödel numbering”, of the language. There are many\npossible ways of accomplishing this, and the details do not really\nmatter (for some more details of one quite standard approach, see the\nsupplementary document\n Gödel Numbering).\n The essential point is that the chosen mapping is effective: it is\nalways possible to pass, purely mechanically, from an expression to\nits code number, and from a number to the corresponding expression.\nToday, when most of us are familiar with computers and the fact that\nso many things can be coded by zeros and ones, the possibility of such\nan arithmetization is hardly surprising. \nRoughly, one proceeds as follows: First, the primitive symbols of the\nlanguage are paired with distinct natural numbers, “symbol\nnumbers”. A little number theory then suffices to code\nsequences of numbers by single numbers. Consequently,\nwell-formed formulas, as sequences of primitive symbols, are each\nassigned a unique number. Finally derivations, or proofs, of the\nsystem, being sequences of formulas, are arithmetized, and are also\nassigned specific numbers. Such a code, the “Gödel\nnumber” of a formula \\(A\\), is denoted as\n\\(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner\\), and similarly for\nderivations. \nIn this way, syntactical properties, relations and operations are\nreflected in arithmetic: for example, \\(\\textit{neg}(x)\\) is the\narithmetical function that sends the Gödel number of a formula to\nthe Gödel number of its negation; in other words,\n\\(\\textit{neg}(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) = (\\ulcorner \\neg A\\urcorner)\\);\nsimilarly, \\(\\impl(x, y)\\) is the function which maps the Gödel\nnumbers of a pair of formulas to the Gödel number of the\nimplication of the formulas: \\(\\impl(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner ,\\ulcorner\nB\\urcorner) = \\ulcorner A \\rightarrow B\\urcorner\\); and so on. There\nis an arithmetical formula, call it\n\\(\\textit{Fmla}(x)\\), which is true of \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) iff\n\\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) is a Gödel number of a well-formed formula of\nthe system. There is also an arithmetical formula \\(M(x,y,z)\\) which\nis true exactly if one has a valid application of the rule of\ninference modus ponens for some formulas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nwith \\(x = \\ulcorner A\\urcorner\\), \\(y = \\ulcorner A \\rightarrow\nB\\urcorner\\) and \\(z = \\ulcorner B\\urcorner\\); etc. In this way, all\nthe syntactic properties and operations can be simulated at the level\nof numbers, and moreover they are strongly representable in all\ntheories which contain\nQ. \nAs it is decidable (by the definition of formal systems) whether a\ngiven sequence of formulas constitutes a proof of a given sentence,\naccording to the rules of the chosen formal system \\(F\\), the binary\nrelation “\\(x\\) is (the Gödel number of) a proof of the\nformula (with the Gödel number) \\(y\\)” can be strongly\nrepresented in all systems containing Q, and thus in \\(F\\) in\nparticular. Let us denote the formula which strongly represents this\nrelation in \\(F\\) itself as \\(\\Prf_F (x, y)\\).  The property of being\nprovable in \\(F\\) can then be defined as \\(\\exists x\\Prf_F (x,\ny)\\). Let us abbreviate this formalized provability predicate\nas \\(\\Prov_F (x)\\).  It follows that\nthe latter is weakly representable (though, it turns out, not\nstrongly): \nIt is always possible to choose the provability predicate\n\\(\\Prov_F (x)\\) to be a \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formula. \nThe next and perhaps somewhat surprising ingredient of\nGödel’s proof is the following important lemma (we still\nassume that \\(F\\) is a formal system which contains\nQ): Let \\(A(x)\\) be an arbitrary formula of the language of\n\\(F\\) with only one free variable. Then a sentence \\(D\\) can be\nmechanically constructed such that (For a sketch of the proof; see Supplement: The\nDiagonalization Lemma) \nIn the literature, this lemma is sometimes also called “the\nself-referential lemma” or “the fixed point lemma”.\nIt has many important applications beyond the incompleteness\ntheorems. \nIt is often said that given a property denoted by \\(A(x)\\),\nthe sentence \\(D\\) is a self-referential sentence which “says\nof itself” that it has the property \\(A\\). Such figures of\nspeech may be heuristically useful, but they are also easily\nmisleading and suggest too much. For example, note that the lemma only\nprovides a (provable) material equivalence between \\(D\\) and\n\\(A(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner)\\) (which states\nthat both sides must have the same truth-value) and does not claim any\nsort of sameness of meaning. In particular, \\(D\\) and\n\\(A(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner)\\) are by no means\nidentical—and neither are\n\\(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner\\) and\n\\(\\ulcorner A(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner)\\urcorner\\).\n \nTo complete the proof, the Diagonalization Lemma is applied to the\nnegated provability predicate\n\\(\\neg\\Prov_F (x)\\): this gives a sentence\n\\(G_F\\) such that \nThus, it can be shown, even inside \\(F\\), that \\(G_F\\) is true if and\nonly if it is not provable in \\(F\\). \nIt is not difficult to show that \\(G_F\\) is neither provable nor\ndisprovable in \\(F\\), if \\(F\\) only is 1-consistent.  \nFor the first half, assume that \\(G_F\\) were provable. Then, by the\nweak representability of provability-in-\\(F\\) by\n\\(\\Prov_F(x)\\), \\(F\\) would also prove \\(\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner\nG_F\\urcorner)\\).  However, because \\(F\\) in fact also proves the\nequivalence (G), i.e, \\(F \\vdash G_F \\leftrightarrow \\neg\\Prov_F\n(\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\), \\(F\\) would then prove \\(\\neg G_F\\)\ntoo. But this would mean that \\(F\\) is inconsistent. In sum, if \\(F\\)\nis consistent, then \\(G_F\\) is not provable in \\(F\\). For this first\nhalf, the assumption of the simple consistency of \\(F\\) suffices. \nFor the second half, it has to be assumed that \\(F\\) is 1-consistent\n(if \\(\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\) has been chosen such that it\nis a \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-sentence; otherwise, the more general assumption\nof \\(\\omega\\)-consistency is needed). \nAssume that \\(F \\vdash \\neg G_F\\). Then \\(F\\) cannot prove \\(G_F\\),\nfor otherwise \\(F\\) would be simply inconsistent. Hence no natural\nnumber \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) is the Gödel number of a proof of\n\\(G_F\\), and because the proof relation is strongly representable, for\nall \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\), \\(F \\vdash \\neg\\Prf_F (\\underline{n},\n\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\).  If also \\(F \\vdash \\exists x\\Prf_F (x,\n\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\), \\(F\\) is not 1-consistent, against the\nassumption. Therefore \\(F\\) does not prove \\(\\exists\nx\\Prf_F (x, \\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\), in other words, by the\ndefinition of \\(\\Prov_F (x), F\\) does not prove \\(\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner\nG_F\\urcorner)\\).  By the key equivalence (G), \\(F\\) also does not\nprove \\(\\neg G_F\\). \nAssume \\(F\\) is a formalized system which contains Robinson\narithmetic Q. Then a sentence \\(G_F\\) of the language of \\(F\\)\ncan be mechanically constructed from \\(F\\) such that: \nSuch an independent, or “undecidable” (that is, neither\nprovable nor refutable in \\(F)\\) statement \\(G_F\\) in \\(F\\) is often\ncalled “the Gödel sentence” of \\(F\\). \nIn fact, in favourable circumstances, it can be shown that \\(G_F\\) is\ntrue, provided that \\(F\\) is indeed consistent. This is the case if,\nfor example, the provability predicate \\(\\Prov_F (x)\\) has been chosen\nas a \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formula: The Gödel sentence is then\nprovably equivalent to the universal formula \\(\\forall x\\neg\\Prf_F (x,\n\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\).  Such formulas can be proved false whenever\nthey in fact are false: if false, there would be a number\n\\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) such that \\(F \\vdash\\Prf_F (\\underline{n},\n\\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\) (this holds already in Q). This,\nhowever, would contradict the incompleteness theorem. Therefore,\n\\(G_F\\) cannot be false, and must be true. For this reason, the\nGödel sentence is often called “true but\nunprovable”. \nOne should not get confused here: “Gödel’s\ntheorem” is the general incompleteness result of Gödel\nwhich concerns a large class of formal systems, while the\n“Gödel sentence” is the constructed, formally\nundecidable sentence which varies from one formal system to another.\nThis is why it is important to include the subscript \\(F\\) in\n\\(G_F\\). Furthermore, one should not confuse the\ntwo different senses of “undecidable” in this context. On\nthe one hand, a particular sentence, like the Gödel\nsentence, may be undecidable in the sense of being independent, i.e.,\nneither provable not refutable in a chosen system. On the other hand,\na theory may be undecidable (see below) in the sense that there\ndoes not exist a decision method for determining of an arbitrary given\nsentence of the language whether or not it is derivable in the theory\n(so this latter sense of “undecidable” concerns, so to\nspeak, an infinite class of statements). \nIn informal explanations of the first incompleteness theorem, it is\noften said that the Gödel sentence \\(G_F\\)\n“says of itself that it is not provable”. Such imprecise\nstatements, however, should be taken at least with a grain of salt.\nThere are a number of reasons to conclude that, at least in general,\nGödel sentences do not really say anything substantial about\nthemselves (Milne 2007 is a careful analysis of such issues); for\nexample, as was previously noted in the case of the Diagonalization\nLemma, one is usually operating here with mere material\nequivalences. \nIn 1936, J. Barkley Rosser made an important improvement that allows\none to get rid of the somewhat clumsy assumption of\n\\(\\omega\\)-consistency in the proof of Gödel’s\nfirst theorem. For this purpose, Rosser introduced a new,\nsomewhat artificial “provability predicate”\n\\(\\Prov^*(x)\\) which was constructed, informally, as\nfollows: \nThere exists \\(y\\) such that \\(y\\) is the Gödel number of a\nproof of the formula with Gödel number \\(x\\), AND there\ndoes not exist \\(z\\) smaller than \\(y\\) such that \\(z\\) is the\nGödel number of a proof the negation of the formula with\nGödel number \\(x\\). \nMore formally: \nwhere \\(\\Prf_F (y, x)\\) is the more\nstandard proof relation discussed earlier. \nAs it happens, if the formal system \\(F\\) under consideration is\nindeed consistent, Rosser’s provability predicate is\nco-extensional with the ordinary provability predicate. Applying the\nDiagonalization Lemma to the negation of Rosser’s provability\npredicate \\(\\Prov^*(x)\\) gives: \nRosser’s modification of the first theorem (Rosser\n1936)\n\nLet \\(F\\) be consistent formalized system which contains\nQ. Then there is a sentence \\(R_F\\) of the language of \\(F\\)\nsuch that neither \\(R_F\\) nor \\(\\neg R_F\\) is provable in \\(F\\).\n \nIt is illuminating to reflect on the first incompleteness theorem also\nfrom the model theoretic perspective—though the theorem itself\ndoes not in any way require this. Namely, it is possible to conclude\nthat any theory \\(F\\) satisfying the conditions of the theorem must\npossess, in addition to the intended interpretation or “standard\nmodel” (in the case of arithmetical theories, the structure of\nnatural numbers), non-intended interpretations or “non-standard\nmodels”—that no such theory can rule out the latter and\nfix uniquely the intended interpretation. Namely, if there are\nindependent statements such as \\(G_F, F\\)\nmust have both models which satisfy \\(G_F\\) and\nmodels which rather satisfy \\(\\neg G_F\\). As\n\\(\\neg G_F\\) is equivalent to \n\\(\\exists x\\Prf_F (x, \\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\),\nthe latter models must possess entities which satisfy the formula\n\\(\\Prf_F (x, \\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\).\nAnd yet we know (because \\(\\Prf_F (x, y)\\)\nstrongly represents the proof relation) that for any numeral\n\\(\\underline{n}, F\\) can prove\n\\(\\neg\\Prf_F (\\underline{n}, \\ulcorner G_F\\urcorner)\\).\nTherefore, no natural number \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) can witness the\nformula. It follows that any such non-standard model must contain, in\naddition to natural numbers (denotations of the numerals\n\\(\\underline{n})\\), “infinite” non-natural numbers after the\nnatural numbers. \nThe study of non-standard models did not start with Gödel’s\nresults—Skolem, in particular, was already aware of them earlier\nin a different context (he had discovered that first-order theories of\nset theory have unnaturally small, namely, countable models, in Skolem\n1922; cf. the entry on\n Skolem’s paradox)—but\n the first incompleteness theorem elucidates the existence of\nnon-standard models in the context of arithmetic, while the\nnonstandard models elucidate the first incompleteness theorem.\nNon-standard models have since then become a rich research area in\nmathematical logic (see, e.g., Boolos & Jeffrey 1989: Ch. 17; Kaye\n1991). \nInformally, the reasoning leading to the second incompleteness theorem\nis relatively simple. Given the arithmetized provability predicate, it\nis also easy to present an arithmetized consistency statement: pick\nsome manifestly inconsistent formula (in arithmetical theories, a\nstandard choice is \\((\\underline{0} = \\underline{1})\\)); let\nus denote it by \\(\\bot\\); (the arithmetized counterpart of) the\nconsistency of the system can then be defined as\n\\(\\neg\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner \\bot \\urcorner)\\).\nLet us abbreviate this formula by \\(\\Cons(F)\\). The proof of\nthe first part of the first incompleteness theorem (i.e., the case (i)\nabove) can then presumably be formalized inside \\(F\\) (in practice\nthis would certainly be intricate). This gives: \nwhere \\(G_F\\) is the Gödel sentence for\n\\(F\\) provided by the first theorem. If \\(\\Cons(F)\\) were\nprovable in \\(F\\), so would be \\(G_F\\), by\nsimple logic. This would contradict Gödel’s first theorem.\nConsequently, \\(\\Cons(F)\\) cannot be provable in \\(F\\)\neither. \nGödel’s second incompleteness theorem\n\nAssume \\(F\\) is a consistent formalized system which contains\nelementary arithmetic. Then \\(F \\not\\vdash\\Cons(F)\\).\n \nThere is a question of philosophical importance that should be\nmentioned here: As it stands, Gödel’s second incompleteness\ntheorem only establishes the unprovability of one sentence,\n\\(\\Cons(F)\\). But does this sentence really express that\n\\(F\\) is consistent? (Compare this with the remark above that\n\\(G_F\\) does not, strictly speaking, express its\nown unprovability.) Furthermore, might there not be other\nsentences which are provable and also express the consistency of\n\\(F\\)? \nGiving a rigorous proof of the second theorem in a more general form\nthat covers all such sentences, however, has turned out to be very\ncomplicated. The basic reason for this is that, unlike in the first\ntheorem, not just any, merely extensionally adequate provability\npredicate works for the formalization of the consistency claim. The\nmanner of presentation makes all the difference. For example,\nRosser’s provability predicate mentioned above would not do; one\ncan prove the “consistency” of \\(F\\) in \\(F\\), if\nconsistency is expressed in terms of Rosser’s provability\npredicate. One must thus add some further conditions for the\nprovability predicate in order for the proof of the second\nincompleteness theorem to go through. Following Feferman (1960), it is\ncustomary to say that whereas the first theorem and its relatives are\nextensional results, the second theorem is intensional:\nit must be possible to think that \\(\\Cons(F)\\) in some sense\nexpresses the consistency of \\(F\\)—that it really\nmeans that \\(F\\) is consistent. \nThe proof of the second incompleteness theorem requires that the\nprovability predicate in \\(F\\) satisfies a number of conditions\nwhich are used in the details of the proof. There are several\ndifferent sets of conditions that will do. \nThe first detailed proof of the second incompleteness theorem appeared\nin (Hilbert & Bernays 1939) (mainly written by Bernays), though\nonly for one specific theory, PA. It uses a rather\nawkward set of conditions for the provability predicate. These were\nmore technical lemmas for the needs of a particular proof and not any\nsort of analysis of “natural” provability predicates. A\nmuch more elegant, now standard list of “derivability\nconditions” was presented by Löb (1955)—though their\nintended use was somewhat different (see below). \n(D1) is simply a restatement of the requirement from the proof of the\nfirst theorem that provability is weakly representable. Roughly put,\n(D2) requires that the whole demonstration of (D1), for the candidate\nprovability predicate \\(\\Prov_F\\), can itself be\nformalized inside \\(F\\). Finally, (D3) requires that the\nprovability predicate is closed under Modus Ponens. \nIf the arithmetized provability predicate indeed satisfies these\nconditions, the second theorem can be proved. Let\n\\(G_F\\) once again be the Gödel sentence for\n\\(F\\) given by the first theorem. It is not too difficult to show,\nusing the derivability conditions, that: \nThis immediately yields the unprovability of \\(\\Cons(F)\\),\ngiven the first incompleteness theorem.  \nFurthermore, Jeroslow (1973) demonstrated, with an ingenious trick,\nthat it is in fact possible to establish the second theorem without\n(D3). However, in some other cases (e.g., when proving\nLöb’s theorem; see below), and in Provability Logic, all\nthree conditions are still needed. \nUnder the assumption that a provability predicate for a theory\nsatisfies the derivability conditions (or, by Jeroslow’s trick,\nat least D1 and D2) it is relatively easy to prove the relevant case\nof the second incompleteness theorem. However, in practise one has to\nestablish whether a proposed arithmetized provability predicate really\nsatisfies the conditions case by case, and typically this is long and\ntedious. \nThis drawback, among other things (see Feferman 1997), led Solomon\nFeferman in the late 1950s to look for an alternative line of attack\nto the second theorem (see Feferman 1960). Feferman approaches the\nissue in two steps: First, he isolates the formulas\n\\(\\Prov_{FOL}(x)\\) which arithmetize some standard\nnotion of derivability in first-order logic in order to allow\nus to fix one chosen formula for provability in logic. How the set of\nnon-logical axioms of the system at issue are presented is left open\nat this stage. Secondly, Feferman looks for a suitable constraint for\npresenting the axioms. Among the formulas of the language of\narithmetic, he isolates what he calls PR- and RE-formulas; the former\ncorrespond to the canonical primitive recursive (PR) definitions in\narithmetic, and the latter to existential generalizations of the\nformer. Every recursively enumerable (RE) set can be defined by a\nformula of the latter sort; these are just the \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formulas.\nThese two classes are\neasy to discriminate purely by their syntactical form. (In fact, by\nthe MRDP Theorem (see below), one could—instead of\nRE-formulas—focus on even simpler class of existentially\nquantified Diophantine equations.) \nWe have above noted the important fact that in all arithmetical\ntheories \\(F\\) containing Q, a set is strongly\nrepresentable in \\(F\\) if and only if it is recursive, and a set is\nrecursively enumerable if and only if it is weakly representable.\nFurthermore, one can always take the formula weakly or strongly\nrepresenting the set to be a RE-formula (i.e., \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formula;\nand, by MRDP Theorem,\neven an existentially quantified Diophantine equation). It is then\nnatural to require that the set of non-logical axioms of the system at\nissue is represented by such a formula. If the arithmetized definition\nof the set of Gödel numbers of axioms reflects how the axioms, if\ninfinite, are inductively defined, the resulting formula will be \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\).\n(For theories which are\naxiomatizable with finitely many axioms, there is a unique\nrepresentation of the axioms in the form of a list, and consequently,\na unique consistency statement relative to\n\\(\\Prov_{FOL}(x)\\).) In contrast to determining\nwhether the derivability conditions are satisfied, it is a relatively\nroutine task to determine that a given formula which formalizes the\naxioms is indeed of the required form (\\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)). \nNow the version of the second incompleteness theorem presented in\nFeferman 1960 is: \nA variant of second incompleteness theorem (Feferman 1960) \n \nLet \\(F\\) be a consistent extension of PA, and let \\(Ax_F (x)\\)\nbe a \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formula which weakly represents the axioms of\n\\(F\\), and \\(\\Cons(F)\\) be a consistency statement constructed from\n\\(Ax_F (x)\\) and \\(\\Prov_{FOL}(x)\\). Then \\(\\Cons(F)\\) is not provable\nin \\(F\\).\n \nFor still different approaches to the second incompleteness theorem,\nsee Feferman 1982, 1989a; Visser 2011. For some philosophical\ncomplications concerning the second theorem, see Detlefsen 1979, 1986,\n1990, 2001; Auerbach 1985, 1992; Roeper 2003; Franks 2009 (see also\nsection on incompleteness in the entry on\n Hilbert’s program). \nGödel first arrived at the incompleteness results (see\n Section 5\n below) by noting that truth (of the language of a system) must be\nundefinable in the system, a result conventionally credited to Tarski\n(there are certain real virtues in Tarski’s way of presenting\nthe issue; see Gómez Torrente 2004). Let us now view the result\nin the context of Tarski’s approach to truth. \nTarski clearly distinguished the object language, i.e., the language\nthe truth of whose sentences is at stake, and the metalanguage in\nwhich the former is discussed. He also required (see the entry on\n Tarski’s truth definitions)\n that any satisfactory definition of truth \\(\\True(x)\\) for\nthe object language should satisfy his “Convention T”,\nthat is, it should have as its consequence all equivalences\n(“T-equivalences”) of the form \nwhere \\(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner\\) is a name of a\nsentence of the object language, and \\(B\\) its translation in the\nmetalanguage. If the metalanguage is identical with the object\nlanguage, or is an extension of the object language, \\(B\\) is\nsimply \\(A\\) itself, and the T-equivalences are of the form: \nWhat the undefinability theorem shows is that the object language and\nthe metalanguage cannot coincide, but must be distinct. \nTarski’s Undefinability Theorem\n\nLet \\(F\\) be a consistent formalized system that contains a sufficient\namount of arithmetic. Then there is no formula \\(Tr(x)\\) in the\nlanguage of \\(F\\) such that for every sentence \\(A\\) of the language\nof \\(F\\): The idea of the proof: If there were such a formula\nof the language of \\(F\\), an easy application of the Diagonalization\nLemma to its negation would result in the paradoxical sentence \\(L\\)\n(for “Liar”; see the Liar paradox)), such that: which, together with the T-equivalences, which were assumed to be\nderivable, would quickly give an explicit contradiction, thus\ncontradicting the assumption that \\(F\\) is consistent. \nSimilarly, it can be proved that the set of true sentences of \\(F\\)\nis not definable in the intended interpretation of \\(F\\)—in\nthe now standard sense of “definability” (see above).  \nThe tools used in proving Gödel’s theorems also provide\nvarious important undecidability results. A theory is called\ndecidable if the set of its theorems (sentences derivable in\nit) is decidable, that is (by the Church-Turing thesis) recursive.\nOtherwise, the theory is undecidable. Informally, being decidable\nmeans that there is a mechanical procedure which enables one to decide\nwhether an arbitrary given sentence (of the language of the theory) is\na theorem or not. \nIf a theory is complete, it is decidable (proof sketch: given a\nsentence \\(A\\), systematically generate the theorems of the theory;\nby completeness, eventually either \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) will be\nproduced in a finite time). The converse, though, does not always\nhold: there are incomplete theories which are decidable. Nevertheless,\nincompleteness at least opens the possibility of undecidability.\nMoreover, all theories which contain Robinson arithmetic\nQ (either directly, or Q can be\ninterpreted in them) are both incomplete and undecidable. Thus, for a\nvery wide class of theories, incompleteness and undecidability go hand\nin hand. \nOne elegant and simple way of demonstrating the undecidability of\nextensions of Q goes, roughly, as follows: Let \\(F\\) be any\nconsistent theory that contains Q.  Assume then that the set of\nits theorems is decidable, that is (by the Church-Turing thesis),\nrecursive. It would then follow that the set (of the Gödel\nnumbers) of the theorems of \\(F\\) is strongly representable\nin \\(F\\) itself. Recall that this means that there is some formula\n\\(B(x)\\) of the language of \\(F\\) such that not only \\(F \\vdash\nB(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner)\\) whenever \\(F \\vdash A\\) (which even weak\nrepresentability guarantees), but also that \\(F \\vdash \\neg\nB(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner)\\) whenever \\(F \\not\\vdash A\\). However, the\ntechnique used in the proof of the first incompleteness theorem also\nshows that there are always sentences for which the latter does not\nhold: it is possible to construct a Gödel sentence \\(G^B\\)\nrelative to \\(B(x)\\) for \\(F\\) such that: \nAs before, it follows that \\(F \\not\\vdash G^B\\). It\nhas been assumed that \\(B(x)\\) strongly represents the set\nof theorems, so this entails \\(F \\vdash \\neg B(\\ulcorner G^B \\urcorner)\\),\nand therefore, by (D), \\(F \\vdash G^B\\), a contradiction. Therefore, \\(F\\) must\nbe undecidable.  \nA theory \\(F\\) is called essentially undecidable if every\nconsistent extension of it in the language of \\(F\\) is undecidable.\nThe above proof sketch in fact establishes that Q is\nessentially undecidable. (There are some very weak theories that are\nundecidable but not essentially undecidable.) \nRecall that Q has only finitely many axioms and let\n\\(A_Q\\) stand for the single sentence consisting\nof the conjunction of the axioms of Q. Then for any\nsentence \\(B\\) of the language of arithmetic, \n\\(\\mathbf{Q} \\vdash B\\) if and only if it is a theorem\nof first-order logic that \\(A_Q \\rightarrow B\\).\n \nBut then a decision procedure for first-order logic would provide a\ndecision method for Q. The latter, however, is\nimpossible, as it has already been shown. Therefore, it can be\nconcluded: \nChurch’s Theorem\n\nFirst-order predicate logic is undecidable.\n \n(This undecidability result was first established by Church 1936a, b;\nthe method of deriving it via the undecidability of Q\nis due to Tarski, Mostowski and Robinson 1953.) \nSubsequently, a number of theories and problems from different areas\nof mathematics have been shown to be undedicable (see, e.g., Davis\n1977; Murawski 1999: Ch 3). \nHeuristically, one may view the Gödel sentence\n\\(G_F\\) as expressing its own\nunprovability—saying “I am not\nprovable”—though, as was already emphasized, such claims\nshould be taken with a grain of salt. Leon Henkin put forward the\nquestion whether the sentence expressing its own provability\n(“I am provable”) is true or false, and provable or not\n(Henkin 1952). Georg Kreisel soon pointed out that this depends\nvitally on how provability is expressed; with different choices, one\ngets opposite answers (Kreisel 1953).  \nThe paper of Martin Hugo Löb (1955), augmented by comments of a\nreferee, brought substantial advances on various fronts. First, it\nintroduces the now standard Löb derivability conditions discussed\npreviously in the context of the second incompleteness theorem.\nSecond, it contains Löb’s solution of Henkin’s\nproblem about sentences “expressing their own\nprovability”. Third, it contains a generalization now called\n“Löb’s Theorem”, but which Löb actually\ncredits to the anonymous referee (who happened to be none other than\nHenkin himself; the whole story is told in Smoryński 1991.) \nIn order to understand Löb’s theorem properly it is useful\nto first consider the so-called “reflection principles”.\nAbove, the focus has been on expressing, inside a formal system, that\nthe system is consistent, i.e., on \\(\\Cons(F)\\). But\nnaturally the theory should not merely be consistent but also\nsound, i.e., prove only true sentences. How should the\nsoundness of a system, i.e., the claim that everything derivable in\nthe system is true, be expressed? If one wants to express this in the\nlanguage of the system itself, it cannot be done by a single statement\nsaying this, because there is, by the undefinability of truth, no\nsuitable truth predicate available in the language. Various restricted\nand unrestricted soundness claims can, however, be expressed in the\nform of a scheme, the so-called Reflection Principles: \nBy taking \\(A\\) to be \\(\\bot\\), and noting that \\(\\bot\\) is refutable\nin \\(F\\), it is easy to see that Reflection Principle entails the\nconsistency statement Cons\\((F)\\), i.e., \\(\\neg\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner \\bot\n\\urcorner)\\); hence it cannot be generally provable in the system. \nThe scheme can also be restricted. Equivalent to the assumption of\n1-consistency, or \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-soundness, for example, is the\nReflection Principle restricted to \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-sentences (i.e.,\nthe sentence \\(A\\) in the scheme is required to be a\n\\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-sentence.)  Or, it can be restricted to the universal\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-sentences; and so forth. \nExactly which instances of the reflection scheme are actually provable\nin the system? Löb’s Theorem gives a precise answer to this\nquestion (assuming that \\(\\Prov_F (x)\\)\nsatisfies the derivability conditions): \nLöb’s Theorem\n\nLet \\(A\\) be any sentence of the language of \\(F\\). Then: \\(F\n\\vdash\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) \\rightarrow A\\) if, and only if,\n\\(F \\vdash A.\\)\n \nHence, the instances of soundness (reflection principle) provable in a\nsystem are exactly the ones which concern sentences which are\nthemselves provable in the system. As a consequence, this also settles\nHenkin’s original problem: assuming that the arithmetized\nprovability predicate is again “normal” (i.e., satisfies\nLöb’s derivability conditions), all sentences\n“asserting their own provability” are provable. \nActually, Löb’s theorem can be proved quite quickly as a\nconsequence of the second incompleteness theorem. Kreisel has also\nnoted that, in the opposite direction, the second incompleteness\ntheorem can also be easily derived as a consequence of\nLöb’s theorem. \nThe tenth on Hilbert’s famous list of important open problem in\nmathematics from 1900 asks for a decision method for the so-called\nDiophantine equations. Despite the unfamiliar term\n“Diophantine,” what is at issue here is truly elementary.\nConsider any equation with one or more variables and with integer\ncoefficients, which involves only addition and multiplication, such as\n\\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\), or \\(3x^2 + 5y^2 + 2xy = 0\\). If real-number\nsolutions are sought, one usually speaks simply about an\n“equation”. However, in number theory, typically a\nsolution is sought consisting only of integers. That makes a great\ndifference. The former of the above equations has infinitely many\nsolutions among real numbers, but only four among integers. The\nequation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 3\\) also has infinitely many real solutions but\nno integer solutions. When the focus is on the integer solutions, one\ntalks about “Diophantine equations” (after the ancient\nnumber theorist Diophantus of Alexandria).  \nFor a positive solution of Hilbert’s tenth problem, it would\nhave sufficed to present a particular concrete method which would have\nintuitively been a “mechanical” decision method. However,\nTuring’s pioneering analysis of the notion of decision method\nbrought into focus the possibility of a negative solution. Beginning\nin the early 1950s, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis worked on this\nproblem, later joined by Hilary Putnam. As a result of their\ncollaboration, the first important result in this direction was\nachieved. Call an equation “an exponential Diophantine\nequation” if it involves also exponentiation, as well as\naddition and multiplication (that is, one can have both constants and\nvariables as exponents); naturally, the focus is still in the integer\nsolutions. Davis, Putnam, and Robinson (1961), showed that the problem\nof solvability of exponential Diophantine equations is undecidable. In\n1970, Yuri Matiyasevich added the final missing piece, and\ndemonstrated that the problem of the solvability of Diophantine\nequations is undecidable. Hence the overall result is often called\nMRDP Theorem (for an exposition, see, e.g., Davis 1973; Matiyasevich\n1993). \nThe essential technical achievement was that all semi-decidable\n(recursively enumerable) sets can be given a Diophantine\nrepresentation, i.e., they can be represented by a simple formula of\nthe form \\(\\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_n (s = t)\\), where \\((s = t)\\)\nis a Diophantine equation. More exactly, for any given recursively\nenumerable set \\(S\\), there is a Diophantine equation \\((s(y, x_1 ,\n\\ldots ,x_n) = t(y, x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n))\\) such that \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\n\\in S\\) if and only if \\(\\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_n\n(s(\\underline{n}, x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n) = t(\\underline{n}, x_1 , \\ldots\n,x_n))\\). \nAs there are semi-decidable (recursively enumerable) sets which are\nnot decidable (recursive), the general conclusion follows immediately:\n \nMRDP Theorem\n\nThere is no general method for deciding whether or not a given\nDiophantine equation has a solution.\n \nThis also provides an elegant variant of the incompleteness theorems\ndealing with Diophantine equations: \nCorollary\n\nFor any 1-consistent axiomatizable formal system \\(F\\) there are\nDiophantine equations which have no solutions but cannot be proved in\n\\(F\\) to have no solutions.\n \n(The question of avoiding the requirement of 1-consistency here is\ntricky; see Dyson, Jones and Shepherson 1982.) \nThe undecidable sentences provided by Gödel’s proofs are\n(if written out) extremely complicated formulas with no intuitive\nsignificance, construed only for the purposes of the incompleteness\nproofs. The question then arises whether there are any simple and\nnatural mathematical statements which are likewise undecidable in\nchosen basic theories, e.g., in PA. There are now\nvarious specific statements with clear mathematical content which are\nknown to be undecidable in some standard theories (though, just how\nnatural even these are has been disputed; see Feferman 1989b). Some\nwell known, natural examples are listed below, beginning with some\nquite natural mathematical statements which are independent of\nPA, and proceeding to more and more powerful\ntheories. Sometimes such results are called variants of\nGödel’s theorem, or their proofs of independence\nalternative proofs of Gödel’s theorem, but this is\nmisleading: interesting as they may be, they don’t have the\ngenerality of Gödel’s theorems proper, but only provide\nstatements independent of a particular theory. \nIt is often stated that before the celebrated Paris-Harrington theorem\n(see below), no such natural independent mathematical statements were\nknown. This is not, however, strictly speaking, correct. Already much\nearlier, around 1935, Gerhard Gentzen (see the entry on the\n development of proof theory)\n had provided such a statement. It is very natural to generalize the\nidea of induction from the domain of natural numbers to the domain of\nordinal numbers. In set theory, such generalizations are called\nprinciples of transfinite induction. Though some constructivists may\nbe sceptical about the legitimacy of full set theory, there are\nlimited and more concrete cases of transfinite induction (only dealing\nwith some well-defined classes of countable ordinals) that are\nperfectly acceptable even from the constructivist or intuitionist\nviewpoint. One important case is the principle of transfinite\ninduction up to the ordinal called \\(\\varepsilon_0\\). Gentzen\nshowed that the consistency of PA can be proved if\nthis transfinite induction principle is assumed. Therefore, because of\nthe second incompleteness theorem, the principle itself cannot be\nprovable in PA (Gentzen 1936). \nRamsey’s theorem is a result in infinitary combinatorics,\nestablished by Frank Ramsey (1930), and deals with possibilities of\n“colouring” for certain graphs. Jeff Paris and Leo\nHarrington formulated a finitary variant of Ramsey’s theorem,\nand showed that it is not provable in PA (Paris &\nHarrington 1977). This provides a quite natural statement of finite\ncombinatorics which is independent of PA. Perhaps an\neven cleaner example is Goodstein’s theorem, due to Reuben\nGoodstein (1944), which is purely number theoretic in nature. First\none defines a certain natural class of sequences of natural numbers,\nnow called “Goodstein sequences”. The theorem states that\nevery Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Goodstein’s\ntheorem is certainly a natural mathematical statement, for it was\nformulated and proved (obviously by proof methods that go beyond\nPA) by Goodstein long before (that is, in 1944) it\nwas shown, in 1982, that the theorem is not provable in\nPA (Kirby & Paris 1982).  \nMoving now to stronger theories beyond PA, one can\nmention, for example, Kruskal’s Theorem. This is a theorem which\nconcerns certain orderings of finite trees (Kruskal 1960). Harvey\nFriedman showed that this theorem is unprovable even in subsystems of\nsecond-order arithmetic much stronger than PA (see\nSimpson 1985). In particular, it is not provable in any theory which\nis predicatively justified (under a widely accepted explication of\n“predicative”, cf. the section on predicativism in the\nentry on the\n philosophy of mathematics). \nThere are some concrete examples of mathematical statements undecided\neven in stronger theories which come from the so-called descriptive\nset theory. This field of mathematics is related to topology and was\ninitiated by the French semi-intuitionists (Lebesgue, Baire, Borel;\nsee the section on descriptive set theory, etc., in the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics).\n It studies sets which possess relatively simple definitions (in\ncontradistinction to the ideas of arbitrary sets and various higher\npower-sets, which the semi-intuitionists rejected as meaningless)\ncalled projective or analytic sets. Classically these were defined as\nthe sets that can be built up from a countable intersection of open\nsets by taking continuous images and complements finitely many times;\nthey coincide with the sets which are definable in the language of\nP\\(^2\\). In particular, the so-called Borel sets can\nbe simply defined both by a formula of the form \\(\\exists XA(x)\\) and\nby a formula of the form \\(\\forall XB(x)\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) do\nnot contain any set variables (in logician’s terminology, Borel\nsets are the \\(\\Delta^{1}_1\\) sets). A Borel function is defined\nanalogously (see, e.g., Martin 1977). \nHarvey Friedman has established the following theorem: roughly, if\n\\(S\\) is a Borel set, then there exists a Borel function \\(f\\)\nsuch that the graph of \\(f\\) is either included in or disjoint from\n\\(S\\). Friedman showed that this simple-sounding theorem is not\nprovable even in full second-order arithmetic\nP\\(^2\\), but proving it necessarily requires\nthe full power of ZFC (see Simpson 1999: 23). \nFurther, it was a traditional question of descriptive set theory (a\nquestion which can be formulated in the language of second order\narithmetic) whether all projective sets (see above) are Lebesque\nmeasurable. This remained an open problem for many decades, and for a\ngood reason: it turned out that the statement is independent even of\nthe full ZFC set theory (see Solovay 1970). Only by\npostulating the existence of some extremely large cardinals (so-called\nWoodin cardinals) can the hypothesis that all projective sets are\nLebesque measurable be proved (this was achieved as a consequence of\ntheir work on so-called projective determinacy by Woodin, Martin and\nSteel; see Woodin 1988; Martin & Steel 1988, 1989).  \nSometimes Paul Cohen’s celebrated result that the Continuum\nHypothesis (CH) is independent of ZFC (Cohen 1963,\n1964; see the entry on\n independence and large cardinals).\n However, this case is very different. In all the above independence\nresults the relevant statements are still theorems of mathematics,\ntaken as shown to be true (the last case, which requires large\ncardinal axioms that go beyond ZFC, is more\ncontroversial; still, at least many set-theoreticians find such axioms\nplausible). And with the first incompleteness theorem itself, the\ntruth of the unprovable statement easily follows, given that the\nassumption of the consistency of the system is indeed correct.\nHowever, in the case of Cohen’s result, there is absolutely no\nindication whether CH should be considered true, false, or perhaps\nlacking a truth-value.  \nGödel’s results were certainly surprising, but some sort of\nincompleteness phenomenon was not totally unexpected. The possibility\nof incompleteness in the context of set theory was discussed by\nBernays and Tarski already in 1928, and von Neumann, in contrast to\nthe dominant spirit in Hilbert’s program, had considered it\npossible that logic and mathematics were not decidable. Gödel\nhimself had mentioned the possibility of an undecidable problem\nconcerning real numbers in his thesis in 1929 (see Dawson 1985).\nHilbert (1928), on the other hand, had assumed that Peano Arithmetic\nand other standard theories were complete. Apparently Gödel was\nalso impressed by Brouwer, who in his lecture in Vienna in 1928 had\nsuggested that mathematics is inexhaustible and cannot be completely\nformalized (see Wang 1987, 84; and the section on Brouwer’s view\nof the formalist program in the entry on\n the development of intuitionistic logic). \nBe that as it may, it seems that Gödel actually arrived at the\nfirst exact observations about incompleteness via a different route,\nduring his attempts to contribute to Hilbert’s program,\nand not to undermine it (see Dawson 1997: Ch. IV). Namely, in 1930,\nGödel made an effort to advance Hilbert’s program by\nattempting to prove the consistency of analysis (or, second-order\narithmetic) with the resources of arithmetic, and thus reduce the\nconsistency of the former to the consistency of the latter. In his\nattempted proof, he needed the notion of truth. Gödel soon faced\nvarious paradoxes (such as the Liar paradox), and had to conclude that\narithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. Hence, Gödel\nfirst arrived at a version of the undefinability of truth theorem,\nusually associated with Tarski (cf. Murawski 1998). This also easily\nyields a weak version of the incompleteness result: the set of\nsentences provable in arithmetic can be defined in the language of\narithmetic, but the set of true arithmetical sentences cannot;\ntherefore the two cannot coincide. Moreover, under the assumption that\nall provable sentences are true, it follows that there must be true\nsentences which are not provable. This approach, though, does not\nexhibit any particular such sentence. \nHowever, the intellectual environment of Gödel was that of the\nVienna Circle with its radically anti-metaphysical attitude. In\nparticular, even the notion of truth was considered as suspicious or\neven nonsensical at the time, at least by some logical positivists\n(e.g., Neurath, Hempel). Therefore, Gödel worked hard to\neliminate any appeal to the notion of truth and attempted to do\nwithout it. He therefore introduced the notion of \\(\\omega\\)-consistency,\nwhich can be defined rigorously and purely syntactically. This led to\nthe incompleteness theorems in the form that they are now known. \nAs to the Diagonalization Lemma, actually Gödel himself\noriginally demonstrated only a special case of it, that is, only for\nthe provability predicate. The general lemma was apparently first\ndiscovered by Carnap 1934 (see Gödel 1934, 1935). Still more\ngeneral versions, for formulas with free variables, were presented in\nEhrenfeucht & Feferman 1960 and Montague 1962 (see Smoryński\n1981). \nThe reception of Gödel’s results was mixed. Some important\nfigures in the field of logic and the foundations of mathematics quite\nquickly assimilated the results and understood their relevance, but\nthere was also quite a lot of misunderstanding and resistance (for\ndetailed accounts of the reception, see Dawson 1985; Mancosu\n1999). \nGödel revealed his results to Carnap in Vienna on 26 August 1930,\nand announced his result (the first theorem) in a casual discussion\nremark in the famous Königsberg Conference on September 7, 1930.\nJohn von Neumann, who was in the audience and was at the time working\nin the context of Hilbert’s program, immediately understood the\ngreat importance of the result. On 20 November he wrote a letter to\nGödel on a “remarkable” corollary of\nGödel’s result he had discovered: the unprovability of\nconsistency (the second theorem). Meanwhile Gödel himself,\nhowever, had found the same idea and had already sent the final\nversion of his article, which now contained also a statement of the\nsecond incompleteness theorem, for publication. The article was\npublished in January 1931 (Gödel 1931; helpful introductions to\nGödel’s original paper are Kleene 1986 and Zach 2005). The\nword quickly started to spread of these results which apparently had\ngreat importance for the foundations of mathematics—though views\non what really was the moral varied. Paul Bernays, perhaps the most\nimportant collaborator of Hilbert, showed great interest in the\nresults, though he first had difficulties in understanding them\nproperly. His active correspondence with Gödel also shows that\nGödel was already at the time fully aware of the undefinability\nof truth. \nAs Gödel’s original approach focused on his specific though\nvery comprehensive system P and its (primitive\nrecursive) extensions, some doubted the generality of\nGödel’s results. Alonzo Church, for example, in a letter to\nGödel in July 1932, suggested that Gödel’s results\nwould not apply to his system of \\(\\lambda\\)-conversion (the system was\nlater proved to be inconsistent by Kleene and Rosser). Gödel was\nanxious to generalize his discoveries, and extended the results to a\nwider class of systems in papers in 1932 and 1934. He also suggested\nthat his methods would be applicable to standard systems of set theory\n(however, it was only after the satisfactory characterization of\ndecidability and the Church-Turing thesis a few years later that it\nwas possible to give a fully general formulation of the incompleteness\ntheorems (see above); this was first done in Kleene 1936). The eminent\nset-theorist Ernst Zermelo directed some rather harsh criticism\ntowards Gödel’s work, but the two also corresponded on the\ntopic. Zermelo seems to have had serious difficulties in understanding\nthe relevant concepts and results. \nIn March 1933, Gödel received a letter from Paul Finsler, from\nZürich, who suggested that he had already earlier (in Finsler\n1926) done closely related work but with a more general relevance.\nGödel replied that Finsler’s system was not really defined\nat all. In his heated response, Finsler claimed that it was not\nnecessary to be able to study a system for it to be sharply defined,\nand that there was no difference in principle between his ideas and\nGödel’s. In retrospect, it is quite clear that the\napproaches of Finsler and Gödel were very different: for\nGödel’s work, the notion of formalized system was\nessential, whereas Finsler rejected the very notion as artificially\nrestrictive. In fact, it is far from clear that Finsler’s ideas\nmake any sense—whatever vague analogies there may be between\nthem and Gödel’s proof. \nOn the other hand, it is fair to say that Emil Post had in some\nrespects anticipated Gödel’s discoveries. He obtained\nabstract versions of incompleteness results apparently already in\n1922. In particular, he observed that his methods would provide a\nstatement undecidable in Principia Mathematica. These results\nwere, however, based on Post’s own version of the\n“Church-Turing thesis”, with which he was dissatisfied,\nand his work was left unpublished. It was reported much later in (Post\n1941).  \nThe correctness of Gödel’s theorems remained the subject of\nlively debate throughout the 1930s (see Dawson 1985). In 1939, Hilbert\nand Bernays’ second volume of Die Grundlagen der\nMathematik appeared, including a detailed proof of the second\nincompleteness theorem. Thereafter, serious opposition to\nGödel’s conclusions disappeared at least among those who\nwere working actively in mathematical logic and the foundations of\nmathematics. However, in more philosophical circles, some resistance\nremained. Most famously, Wittgenstein made some critical remarks\nconcerning Gödel’s theorem in his posthumously published\nRemarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. The dominant initial\nreaction was that Wittgenstein simply failed to understand the result.\nMore charitable interpretations have emerged, and the debate is still\nvery much alive (see the section on Gödel and undecidable\npropositions in the entry on\n Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics). \nOf the various fields of philosophy, Gödel’s theorems are\nobviously most immediately relevant for the philosophy of mathematics.\nTo begin with, they pose, at least prima facie, serious\nproblems for Hilbert’s program (this issue is discussed in some\ndetail in the section on the impact of incompleteness in the entry on\n Hilbert’s Program).\n Then again, they have important consequences for intuitionism\n(see the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics)\n (see also Gödel 1933, 1941; Raatikainen 2005). \nThere has been some dispute on the issue as to whether\nGödel’s theorems conclusively refute logicism (see\nthe entry on\n logicism).\n Henkin (1962) and Musgrave (1977), for example, argue it does;\nSternfeld (1976) and Rodríguez-Consuegra (1993) disagree (see\nalso Hellman 1981; Raatikainen 2005). \nGödel himself developed an argument against the conventionalist\nphilosophy of mathematics of logical positivism, and of Carnap’s\nin particular, based on the incompleteness results (Gödel\n1953/9). It is discussed in Goldfarb and Ricketts 1992; Ricketts 1995;\nGoldfarb 1995; Crocco 2003; Awodey & Carus 2003, 2004; Tennant\n2008.  \nOne can also give more general epistemological interpretations of\nGödel’s theorems. Quine and Ullian (1978), for example,\nconsider the traditional philosophical picture that all truths could\nbe proved by self-evident steps from self-evident truths and\nobservation. They then point out that even the truths of elementary\nnumber theory are presumably not in general derivable by self-evident\nsteps from self-evident truths (Quine & Ullian 1978: 64–65.)\nHilary Putnam (1975) in turn submits that, under a certain natural\nunderstanding of “analytic”, there must be, by\nGödel’s theorems, synthetic truths in mathematics. In fact,\nGödel himself made remarks in a very similar spirit that even the\ntheory of integers is demonstrably non-analytic (Gödel 1944). \nThere have been repeated attempts to apply Gödel’s theorems\nto demonstrate that the powers of the human mind outrun any mechanism\nor formal system. Such a Gödelian argument against mechanism was\nconsidered, if only in order to refute it, already by Turing in the\nlate 1940s (see Piccinini 2003). An unqualified anti-mechanist\nconclusion was drawn from the incompleteness theorems in a widely read\npopular exposition, Gödel’s Theorem, by Nagel and\nNewman (1958). Shortly afterwards, J.R. Lucas (1961) famously\nproclaimed that Gödel’s incompleteness theorem \nproves that Mechanism is false, that is, that minds cannot be\nexplained as machines.  \nHe stated that  \ngiven any machine which is consistent and capable of doing simple\narithmetic, there is a formula it is incapable of producing as being\ntrue … but which we can see to be true. \nMore recently, very similar claims have been put forward by Roger\nPenrose (1989, 1994). John Searle (1997) has joined the discussion and\npartly defended Penrose against his critics. Crispin Wright (1994,\n1995) has endorsed related ideas from an intuitionistic point of view\n(for criticism, see Detlefsen 1995). They all insist that\nGödel’s theorems imply that the human mind infinitely\nsurpasses the power of any finite machine or formal system. \nThese Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however,\nproblematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail. The standard\nresponse to this argument goes along the following lines (this\nobjection goes back to Putnam 1960; see also Boolos 1968, Shapiro\n1998): The argument assumes that for any formalized system, or a\nfinite machine, there exists the Gödel sentence which is\nunprovable in that system, but which the human mind can see to be\ntrue. Yet Gödel’s theorem has in reality a conditional\nform, and the alleged truth of the Gödel sentence of a system\ndepends on the assumption of the consistency of the system. The\nanti-mechanist’s argument thus also requires that the human mind\ncan always see whether or not a given formalized theory is consistent.\nHowever, this is highly implausible (cf. Davis 1990). Lucas, Penrose\nand others have attempted to reply to such criticism (see, e.g., Lucas\n1996; Penrose 1995, 1997). For detailed criticism of Penrose, see\nBoolos 1990; Davis 1990, 1993; Feferman 1995; Lindström 2001;\nPudlák 1999; Shapiro 2003; many of these considerations are\nalso relevant for what Lucas says). \nInterestingly, Gödel himself also presented an anti-mechanist\nargument although it was more cautious and only published posthumously\n(in his Collected Works, Vol. III, in 1995). That is, in his\n1951 Gibbs lecture, Gödel drew the following disjunctive\nconclusion from the incompleteness theorems:  \neither … the human mind (even within the realm of pure\nmathematics) infinitely surpasses the power of any finite machine, or\nelse there exist absolutely unsolvable diophantine problems.  \nGödel speaks about this statement as a “mathematically\nestablished fact” (Gödel 1951; for more discussion on\nGödel’s disjunctive claim, see, e.g., Shapiro 1998).\nAccording to Gödel, the second alternative  \nseems to disprove the view that mathematics is only our own creation\n… that mathematical objects and facts … exist\nobjectively and independently of our mental acts and decisions.  \nGödel was nonetheless inclined to deny the possibility of\nabsolutely unsolvable problems, and although he did believe in\nmathematical Platonism, his reasons for this conviction were\ndifferent, and he did not maintain that the incompleteness theorems\nalone establish Platonism. Thus Gödel believed in the first\ndisjunct, that the human mind infinitely surpasses the power of any\nfinite machine. Still, this conclusion of Gödel follows, as\nGödel himself clearly explains, only if one denies, as does\nGödel, the possibility of humanly unsolvable problems. It is not\na necessary consequence of incompleteness theorems. \nNow Gödel was, unlike the later advocates of the so-called\nGödelian anti-mechanist argument, sensitive enough to admit that\nboth mechanism and the alternative that there are humanly absolutely\nunsolvable problems are consistent with his incompleteness theorems.\nHis fundamental reasons for disliking the latter alternative are much\nmore philosophical. Gödel thought in a somewhat Kantian way that\nhuman reason would be fatally irrational if it asked questions it\ncould not answer (for critical discussion, see Kreisel 1967; Boolos\n1995; Raatikainen 2005). \nAs a reaction to Lucas’ argument, but before the publication of\nGödel’s Gibbs Lecture, Paul Benacerraf (1967) put forward\nmore qualified conclusions that interestingly resemble some ideas of\nGödel. He argued that it is consistent with all the facts that I\nam indeed a Turing machine, but that I cannot ascertain which one. For\nsome critical discussion, see Chihara 1972 and Hanson 1971. \nSometimes quite fantastic conclusions are drawn from\nGödel’s theorems. It has been even suggested that\nGödel’s theorems, if not exactly prove, at least give\nstrong support for mysticism or the existence of God. These\ninterpretations seem to assume one or more misunderstandings which\nhave already been discussed above: it is either assumed that\nGödel provided an absolutely unprovable sentence, or that\nGödel’s theorems imply Platonism, or anti-mechanism, or\nboth. \nFor more discussion about the philosophical aspects of the\nincompleteness theorems, see Raatikainen 2005 and Franzén\n2005. \nA standard reference for the incompleteness theorems is: \nThere are several introductory textbooks in mathematical logic which\ngive a good exposition of the incompleteness theorems and related\ntopics; for example: \nTwo books that are dedicated to the incompleteness theorems are: \nAnother useful book on the incompleteness theorems and related topics\nis: \nA comprehensive, more advanced book on these themes is: \nAnother useful book, including also some more advanced topics is: \nThe more philosophical aspects around the incompleteness theorems are\nsurveyed in the following two sources (Franzén is an\naccessible, informal, and yet reliable, explanation of the\nincompleteness theorems): \nThe following two papers survey various issues around the first\nincompleteness theorem: \nFinally, there is an open-source e-book that contains a presentation\nof the incompleteness theorems:","contact.mail":"panu.raatikainen@tuni.fi","contact.domain":"tuni.fi"}]
