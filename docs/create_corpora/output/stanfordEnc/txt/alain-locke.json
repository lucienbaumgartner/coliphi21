Locke is best known as a theorist, critic, and interpreter of African-American literature and art. He was also a\ncreative and systematic philosopher who developed theories of value, pluralism and cultural relativism that informed and were reinforced by his work on aesthetics. Locke saw black aesthetics quite differently than some of the leading Negro intellectuals of his day; most notably W. E. B. Du Bois, with whom he disagreed about the appropriate social function of Negro artistic pursuits. Du Bois thought it was a role and responsibility of the Negro artist to offer a representation of the Negro and black experience which might help in the quest for social uplift. Locke criticized this as “propaganda” (AOP 12) and argued that the primary responsibility and function of the artist is to express his own individuality, and in doing that to communicate something of universal human appeal.\n\n\nLocke was a distinguished scholar and educator and during his lifetime an\nimportant philosopher of race and culture. Principal among his\ncontributions in these areas was the development of the notion of\n“ethnic race”, Locke's conception of race as\nprimarily a matter of social and cultural, rather than biological,\nheredity. Locke was in contemporary parlance a racial revisionist, and\nheld the somewhat controversial and paradoxical view that it was often\nin the interests of groups to think and act as members of a\n“race” even while they consciously worked for the\ndestruction or alteration of pernicious racial categories. Racial\ndesignations were for Locke incomprehensible apart from an\nunderstanding of the specific cultural and historical contexts in which\nthey grew up. A great deal of Locke's philosophical thinking and\nwriting in the areas of pluralism, relativism and democracy are aimed\nat offering a more lucid understanding of cultural or racial\ndifferences and prospects for more functional methods of navigating\ncontacts between different races and cultures.\n\n\nLocke, like Du Bois, is often affiliated with the pragmatist\nphilosophical tradition though somewhat surprisingly—surprising\nbecause Locke's actual views are closer substantively to pragmatist\nthinkers Like Dewey, James, and Royce than are Du Bois's—he does\nnot receive as much attention in the writings of contemporary\npragmatist philosophers as does Du Bois.  Regardless, he is most\nstrongly identified with the pragmatist tradition, but his\n“critical pragmatism”, and most specifically his value\ntheory, is also influenced by Hugo Münsterberg, F.S.C. Schiller,\nAlexius Meinong, Frantz Brentano, and Christian von Erhenfels. From\nearly on in his education at Harvard University, Locke had an affinity\nfor the pragmatist tradition in philosophy. Locked developed his\nmature views on axiology well in advance of many leading\npragmatists—e.g., Dewey and James.  Among pragmatists, Locke has\narguably the most developed and systematic philosophy of value, and\noffers many critical insights concerning democracy.\n\n\n\nLocke's seminal essay in value theory, “Values and\nImperatives” is as ambitious in its aims as it is pioneering. In\nit Locke states what he takes to be the central problem for axiology;\ndetails the reasons for the failure of American philosophy,\nparticularly pragmatism, to make anything more than a minimal\ncontribution to the development of the philosophical study of values;\nargues that values are primarily rooted in human attitudes; and\nprovides an elaborate theoretical account of value formation and the\nfunctional role of values.\n\nA value, according to Locke, is “an emotionally mediated form of experience.” Locke issues the following warning:\n \nValues are an important and necessary part of human\nexperience. Values are an essential part of human existence as all\nhuman persons are inherently valuing beings. He writes: \nValuations of multiple kinds pervade nearly every\naspect of our lives; our aesthetic, moral and religious evaluations and\njudgments. \n\nOn Locke's estimation,  This is the central and\ndriving question of Locke's axiology and as such it points to\nsome of the crucial aspects of his overall philosophical view, but his\ntheory of value specifically, and importantly his social and political\nphilosophy. On the axiological plane the question is reformulated as\nwhether or not the fundamental value modes automatically or\ndispositionally set up their end values prior to evaluative judgment.\nIf value modes automatically or dispositionally set up their own ends,\nthen there would exist a more direct approach to the apprehension of\nvalues. Moreover, if a connection can be discovered between certain\npsychological states and particular valuations then that might yield at\nleast one avenue for an objective assessment of values and valuations.\nOn the social and political plane—the practical plane where\npersons actually form valuations and act on them in myriad\nways—the question is formulated in terms of how  best to\navoid a theory of value that is static, arbitrary and overly formulaic\nin ways that impede the theory's ability to provide an adequate\nunderstanding of value phenomena. To do this, a functional analysis of\nvalue norms is required, and normative principles must be the result of\nthe immediate context of valuation. This we will see in the following\nsections is the major thrust of Locke's value pluralism and\nrelativism.  Locke begins by considering what he takes to be the most basic feature of values; their emotional character. He writes  There is a particular feeling or feeling-quality associated with\neach value-mode. In fact, Locke contends that value-modes differ in\nvirtue of differences in feeling-qualities. The value-mode, or perhaps\nbetter, the mode of valuing, refers to the qualitative character of a\nparticular way of experiencing as mediated by a given emotion or\nattitude which Locke terms the feeling-quality. This has several\nimportant implications for the general theory of value: predicating a\nvalue to a subject depends on the feeling-quality associated with it;\nvalues are immediately recognized through an apprehension of their\nemotional quality; value-predicates are determined by the affective\nand volitional influence of the feeling-quality; and the imperatives\nof a given value are given immediately once the primary\nfeeling-quality has been established. \n\nLocke claims that there is a necessary connection between the\nfeeling-quality and the value-mode with the former determining the\nlater. The value-mode is normally established as the value is being\napprehended. If this were not the case, the value-mode would be\nindeterminate even while its immediate quality is being felt. The basic\ncategories of value are not rational: one cannot simply reason\none's way to an understanding of them. In developing and\narticulating his axiology, Locke looks for the categories of value in\nthe actual valuations of human beings. Rather than predetermining the\ncategories of valuation and attempting to cram experiences of values\ninto them, his theory begins with our concrete valuations and\ndetermines which if any features they have in common. It is then on the\nbasis of the commonalities observed to obtain between particular\nexperiences of values that they are classed together as members of the\nsame class. Locke writes, \n\nLocke is aware that it is not easy to demonstrate that the\nfundamental identity and unity of a value-mode depends on a\nfeeling-quality. It may be that the position thus far articulated is\nmerely hypothetical and speculative and requires an experimental\nmethodology to prove it. Locke notes that the main objections to the\nposition have been addresses by developments in the Gestalt psychology\ninsofar as it has established an empirical basis for a comprehensive\nperceptual scheme functioning in recognition, comparison and choice.\nFurther circumstantial evidence is offered for the position by the\nphenomenon of transvaluation (see section 2.3 below). \n\nOn Locke's view, though the value-mode is determined\nimmediately by the affective character of the value, this is not the\nfinal determination of the value. Even after the value-mode has been\nascertained, the legitimacy of the value may still be in question, its\nplace in the overall value scheme may be unclear, and particular\naspects of the context of valuation may be uncertain. This leads Locke\nto conclude that the primary normative character of value norms is best\nsought in their functional role as stereotypes of feeling attitudes and\nas habitual impulses toward certain choices of actions. This would make\nthem culturally specific, as well as temporally and geographically\ncontingent as values can only be habituated and function with any\ndegree of reliability in specific contexts. Moreover, as in the case of\napprehending value-modes, the functionality of a given value is to be\ndiscovered experientially; rather than, postulated a priori.\nValues, then, would only become absolutes—should they become\nabsolute at all—because reason and judgment secondarily\nre-enforce them as such. In their immediate character and quality\nvalues are affective, but they are further mediated by reason and\njudgment. Value predication depends on reason and judgment; but the\npredicates themselves are determined by the modal quality of the value.\nSo, the judgment that an object is beautiful or ugly involves reason\nand judgment, but that the object is experienced as aesthetic depends\non its affective apprehension; its being experienced aesthetically.\n  \n\nCommenting on his own preference for a functional theory of value\nLocke writes:  Moreover, a functional account of value has the theoretical\nadvantages of being able to account for parallels between values, value\ninterchangeability, and transvaluation. It is perhaps in taking a\nfunctional view of values and their associated imperatives where\nLocke's theory of value is most pragmatic. A functional view of\nvalues emphasizes the fact that values are an essential feature of our\nlived-experiences. At its most basic level value functionality aims to\nprovide a way of understanding how particular values operate as\ncoordinating mechanisms for individual and collective action. Some\nvalues have a specific social role; a societal aim or goal that they\nhave been modified and adapted over time to help achieve or maintain.\nSuch values are often codified in the customs and traditions of a\nculture and can sometimes remain ritualized long after their functional\nrole is obsolete. The importance and usefulness of a functional view of\nvalues in Locke's social and political philosophy is further\nexplored in section 3.2 below. \n\nTransvaluation is a central tenet of Locke's axiology. He\nwrites:  The feeling-quality of a given value\nnecessarily establishes the mode of valuation, i.e., the type of value in\nquestion (for example, aesthetic, religious, moral etc.) as well as the\nappropriate value-predicates. However, there is no necessary connection\nbetween a given object that serves as the content of a value and any\nparticular emotional response to that object. One and the same object\nmay affect the same person differently at different times, or may at\nthe same time elicit from multiple people different emotional\nreactions. Transvaluation, then is most simply valuing something in a\ndifferent way, which requires, at first, having an atypical emotional\nassociation with the object of value. There are multifarious potential\ncauses of such transformations in one's affective responses to an\nobject, and those causes can be immediate or unfold over time.\n“The changed feeling-attitude creates a new value” says\nLocke “and the type-form of the attitude brings with it its\nappropriate value category. These modes co-assert their own relevant\nnorms; each sets up a categorical imperative of its own” (VI\n41). \n\nLocke treats transvaluation as inevitable; values are dependent upon\nsocial and cultural forces that are always in a state of flux and\nsubject to myriad transformative influences at any given time, hence\nstatic values are implausible. Value transformation can take place on\nthe individual level or on the level of widespread social or cultural\nvalues. Locke's hope is that this analysis will bring us closer\nto a practical understanding of value and the mechanism of valuation,\nwhich he hopes will bring us closer to understanding the grounds for\nboth agreements among values and value conflict. \nLocke offers a schematization of four traditional\nvalues—religious, moral, logical and aesthetic—to\ndemonstrate how his theory classifies values into types according to\ntheir characteristic feeling-quality (see the table below) (VI 43). The\nschema also charts the value-predicates and the positive and negative\npoles associated with each value-type (type of value). Finally, the\nschema further divides each value according to its directionality;\nthat is, whether the value is primarily introverted, functioning\ninwardly on the individual subject, or is extroverted, functioning\nexternally in a social context.\n Locke contends that his position has certain advantages over more\nlogical theories of value. In particular, it is better able to explain\ncertain value phenomena that are troubling for the latter type of\ntheories. Phenomena such as transvaluation, value merging, and value\nconflict are able to be explained in terms of the basic doctrine that\nthe mode of valuation is determined by the character of a\nsubject's affective response in a value context. Locke claims\nthat logical theories of value have historically had difficulty\naccounting for phenomena such as the aesthetic appraisal of a logical\nor mathematical proof; moral commitment to aesthetic production; or\naesthetic appreciation of religious practice. In particular, logical\ntheories have struggled to make sense of assigning predicates from one\nvalue-type to objects that are traditionally the content of a different\nvalue-type as when a proof in logic is deemed beautiful or ugly.\nTraditional theories treat such value predication as merely\nmetaphorical or analogical.  Locke explains value conflict in terms of a more fundamental\npsychological incompatibility. Not only does the value-feeling\ndetermine the qualitative character of a given value, it also\nestablishes broader categories of value by grouping values according to\ntheir common affective quality. As he puts it “[c]hange the\nattitude, and, irrespective of content, you change the value-type; the\nappropriate new predicates automatically follow” (VI 44).  Value\nattitudes can be psychologically incompatible, and where they are Locke\ncontends that a hierarchical ranking of values will not resolve the\nincompatibility. In fact, he suggests that people resolve the\nincommensurability of their various value attitudes by shifting from\none mode of valuation to another. This is why a functional account of\nvalues that determines the various value-modes on the basis of\nunderlying psychological states is desirable. Such a theory is better\nable to achieve a reflective equilibrium with our actual value\npractices. All values have associated with them a set of imperatives.\nLocke does not have a great deal to say about how imperatives are\nformed. Presumably, imperatives are determined, at least in part, by\nthe qualitative character of the value in question. People begin by\nforming a value-attitude based on one's initial affective\nresponse to the object of valuation. As a mediating form of experience\na value supplies motivational drives toward acting and refraining from\nacting in certain ways. Values provide normative direction not only for\ncognition and psychological drives, but also for action. Imperatives\nare partially in place as soon as the affective quality of the value is\napprehended. Locke's philosophical worldview is pervaded by a concern for\ndiversity. Locke takes pluralism in all its form—religious,\ncultural, value etc.—as a basic feature of the world. His primary\nfocus then becomes one of understanding the multiplicity of ways in\nwhich peoples meet, and providing some normative guidance concerning\nhow best to act when they do. Values organize, coordinate, mediate and\ndirect experience. In so doing, they serve both a valuable epistemic as\nwell as existential function. Values direct and guide our activity, but\nmore than that they color the nature of our encounters with other\npersons, and frequently function as a source of conflict between\nindividual persons and groups of human beings. The common mistake among\nvaluers that leads to a “totalizing” of values as\n“absolutes” or “ultimates” is to forget that\nany given value encompasses only an aspect of reality and ought not to\nbe treated as transcendent or reducible to that reality. This is a\nfundamental insight of Locke's philosophy of value as it is applied to\nsocial theory. And Locke believes that if he is correct in asserting\nthat\n“[a]s derivative aspects of the same basic reality, value\norders cannot reasonably become competitive and rival realities”\nthat he will have provided the necessary theoretical foundation for a\nmore latitudinarian exchange between diverse human collectives (VI 47).\nLocke's presentation of his pluralist position proceeds as a\nresponse to three obstacles or barriers to pluralism: absolutism,\n(counter) uniformitarianism, and arbitrary dogmatism. If individual\nvaluers or value groups are able to avoid these three pitfalls, then\neither may possibly develop a pluralistic value orientation. The first barrier to pluralism is absolutism. Values and their\nassociated imperatives are absolute when they are thought to apply to\nall human beings, at all times irrespective of social or historical\nconditions. This is because absolutist conceptions of values are\nderived from, and ultimately justified by something other than the\nlived-experiences of human beings, be it God, or human rationality.\nWhereas pluralism is intended to accommodate a wide array of contending\nvalues, absolutism countenances one, and only one set of values\nuniversally applicable to all human beings. Locke claims that\n“absolutism has come forward again in new and formidable\nguise,” and he warns us to be on guard for “social\nand political forms of it, with their associated intellectual tyrannies\nof authoritarian dogmatism and uniformitarian universality” (PID\n53). These newer forms of absolutism, Locke claimed, are the products\nof older ones. When values are held to be absolute there often results\na tendency to discount the legitimacy of rival values. Pluralism avoids\nconceiving of values in absolutist terms. Setting various value\nconceptions on equal footing is the aim of Locke's\npluralism. Uniformitarianism, the second obstacle to pluralism, is the view\nthat values ought to be uniform within a given community or group. The\nexperiences of members of a given group are filtered through the same\nforms of mediation to produce value uniformity. Values are ascribed a\nsingle form for all members of a group; rather than allowing for a\nmultiplicity of mediated experiences. Value uniformity can be achieved\nviolently, coercively or peacefully, but in all instances it is an\nattempt to replace diversity with homogeneity. Locke suspects that it\nis the desire to defend one's own culture and to create consensus\namong competing value claims that is at the root of the quest for\nuniformity. Unfortunately, that motivation can easily lapse into an\nattempt to force one's own value system onto others without\njustification. Uniformitarianism is a refusal to accommodate the myriad\nvalue forms that are essential to pluralism. Finally, Locke warns us to avoid the pitfalls of arbitrariness and\ndogmatism. Value commitments are arbitrary when one forms\nthem—thereby rejecting viable alternatives—in the absence\nof any justification for choosing them over other available options.\nOne holds her values dogmatically when she takes them to be\nindisputable and is closed-off to the possibility of taking a critical\nview of her value commitments that could possibly result in her\naltering or rejecting them. Locke describes pluralism as a functional base, one that can\nfunction as a foundation from which to achieve a rapprochement of\nconflicting values. Pluralism, as Locke envisions it, has the potential\nto create agreement among competing and conflicting values, through the\nrecognition of common features of various values and value systems. A\ncloser look at Locke's analysis of values; in particular, the three\nconcepts of basic human values, basic equivalence, and functional\nconstancy will illuminate what it means for pluralism to function in\nthis way. First, is the concept of basic human values, by which\nLocke means those values that are common to many, or all value systems;\nvalues such as belief in god, commitment to one's cultural\ncommunity, respect for human life, etc. which though they may have\nmultifarious manifestations, are in a more general way common to most,\nif not all groups. Of course, value communities differ, and no two\nvalue communities will be exactly alike, but there does exist\nsubstantial overlap of a subset of values across values communities.\nBasic human values then, are basic and human in virtue of their common\nexpression in a plurality of value contexts and their pertaining to the\nlives of human beings, and not as a matter of their universal\napplicability across all of humanity. The next two concepts—basic equivalence and functional\nconstancy—are perhaps best understood as two sides of a\ndistinction between formal and functional equivalence. Basic\nequivalence refers to a similarity of form and functional constancy\nrefers to a similarity in function. Basic equivalence is a formal\nresemblance owing to a corresponding value-mode. It is a similarity in\nthe type of value, or better, being particular values of the same type.\nThis notion rests on drawing a distinction between the object of\nvaluation and the way the object is valued. The object may differ where\nthe value mode does not. As a consequence a single object can be valued\nmultiple ways, and many different objects can be valued in the same\nway. Take for example the institution of marriage as the object of\nvaluation. Marriage is valuable in least two senses, first, it may be\nvalued as the religious union of a man and a woman, and secondly, the\nmarriage ceremony itself could be valued as a ritualized aesthetic\nexperience. In both cases one and the same phenomenon is the content of\ntwo different value modes. In the first instance, marriage is valued\nreligiously; the characteristic quality of the value, its form, is\nspiritual. In the second instance, marriage could be valued because of\nthe elegant décor, grandiose ceremony, and beautiful\narrangements that characterize the event. The example goes to\nillustrate the fact that different ways of valuing can be applied to\nthe same object by the same person or by different people. Valuation\nworks the other way as well, that is, different objects can be valued\nthe same way. As for example, a marriage, a baptism, or a christening\ncan all be valued religiously or aesthetically. One can recognize a\nsimilarity in the form of competing values even though their objects\nmay differ, or a difference in form where the object stays the same.\nBasic equivalence then speaks to an identity of form not of content. It\nis a conceptual tool that enables persons to recognize that their\nrespective value expressions are species of the same genus. Locke\nspeaks of the objective comparison of basic human values which leads\none to think that his claim is that different groups may regard\ndifferent sets of values as basic to human beings though these may not\nbe identical, but rather, formally equivalent values. The other side of the formal/functional equivalence distinction is\nthe notion of functional constancy. By functional\nconstancy is meant the ability of basic equivalent values to\noperate as stable features of value processes and activity within\nvarious value communities. Locke envisions that what will be found\nbeneath potentially vast differences in content, and beyond a\nsimilarity of form, is a comparable utility of various values across\ncontexts. Every value has an attendant function; a role that it plays\nwithin a given value community. Values that differ either in form or in\ncontent may still be equivalent as regards their function. These\nfunctional constants are discovered through comparison of fundamental\nvalues found across value groups. Thus functional equivalence provides a constancy of two sorts:\nfirst, the function is constant within a given value community insofar\nas it plays the same role for different members of the same value\ngroup, and second, the function can be a common feature across value\ngroups. Think here again of the example of marriage. Admittedly, there\nis a wide variety of particular manifestations of such a value, and\nthere can be differences in the form as well as the content of such\nvalues. But it is still the case that such variation results in a\nsimilar function within a value community. Children are reared,\nnetworks of support are maintained, property is held in common and\nbequeathed to successive generations etc. and these social roles are\nserved by a myriad of expressions of familial ties in the community.\nMoreover, family values function in this way across cultures. To be\nsure, there may not be an exact equivalence of function across value\ncommunities, or even within them for that matter, but to a large extent\nthis equivalence of function is there to be observed. It may be the\ncase that there exist social functions for a given value in one context\nthat are absent in another: if so, there is no equivalence to be made.\nAll values have a function, but as there is no necessary connection\nbetween a given value and a particular function, it does not follow\nfrom this that every value function can be found in every culture. Relativism, for Locke, begins as a systematic approach to the\nrecognition of the sorts of value equivalence discussed earlier, and is\nthen able to militate against the pernicious forms of valuing that\noften turn cultural exchanges into intractable problems. The view is\ntermed relativist because it makes a comprehensive and accurate\nunderstanding of the values of a given culture dependent—at least\nin part—on that culture being viewed in relation to other\ncultures. Moreover, Locke claims that cultural relativism can serve as\n“a scientifically impartial interpreter of human values, and\nsometimes even as a referee and mediator among conflicting\nvalues” (CRIP 70). Relativism, on Locke's view, is not a negative skeptical position\nthat is predicated upon the belief that one is unable to make a\nsatisfactory determination about the relative worth of value\ncommunities. Instead, it is a positive and affirmative position\nconcerning the relative worth of distinct value traditions and\ncultures. Locke formulates his relativism in terms of the three\nprinciples of cultural equivalence, cultural reciprocity, and cultural\nconvertibility. He claims that the three principles are derivable from\nthis larger relativist outlook and will enable “a more objective\nand scientific understanding of human cultures and…more\nreasonable control of their interrelationships” (CRIP 73).  The first of the three principles is: The effect of the first principle is to lay bare the fact that the\nseemingly vast differences between cultures is more a matter of our\nselective preferences; that is, the habits of mind we have cultivated\nfor being more keenly attuned to difference rather than similarity. The\nfirst stage of relativism, then, is to reorient our focus in favor of\nthe similarity to be found across value communities. Cultural cognates\nand correlates are objective because they are discovered to be real\nfeatures of multiple value systems. They are in an important sense\n“there” to be discovered both by internal and external\nobservers of the value group. The reason that these value cognates\ncount as neutral is that they do not, in virtue of their being\nobjective, privilege any value-type or value-content over any other. At\nthis stage they are taken as mere facts of the matter about the values\nthat exist within communities. The second principle of cultural relativism is: This aspect of Locke's relativism requires a\n“beneficent neutrality between divergent positions” (CRIP\n70–71). It begins by fostering a disposition toward cultural\ntoleration in the hope that such toleration will lead to mutual\nrespect, which would in turn serve as a foundation upon which to base\nreciprocal exchanges between cultures. In the most likely case, these\ninitial exchanges will be centered around specific values that form\nnarrowly defined communities of agreement. In the end, if cultural\nrelativism is able to foster reciprocity between value communities to a\nsufficient degree, then cultural relativism may well establish a\nfoundation of mutual understanding and appreciation to support active\ncooperation between value groups. The principle of cultural reciprocity\nrestrains the inferences that we are able to make as a result of the\nprincipal of cultural equivalence in at least two ways: first, its\nemphasis on point-by-point comparisons limits the scope of the value\ncognates that are discovered, and second, it issues an injunction\nagainst identifying or connecting specific values with specific\ncultures or value communities. Relativism is to borrow from an\nidealized model of scientific practice; a point of view that does not\nprejudge the results of a given observation before it is carried out.\nMoreover, it points out that the discovery of cognates and correlates\nis not likely to be wholesale, but instead, specific and\ncontextualized. Finally, we have the principle of cultural convertibility: All value-types are independent of any given value-content; any\ngiven value-type can be joined with any value-content. This fact of\nvaluation is what grounds cross-cultural transformation. The extent to\nwhich cultures are modified by their interactions with other cultures,\nis in part a function of how stringently the cultures in question\nassociate their own value-forms with specific value-content. At a\nhigher level, Locke indicates that associations might even be made\nbetween a value and its institutional form, by which he seems to mean\nthe manner in which the value is organized into the social structure of\na value community. If specific values are correlated with particular\ninstitutional forms, a necessary connection may be assumed to exist\nbetween them where it does not. Locke is perhaps best known for his work in aesthetics, in\nparticular, his role as both an intellectual purveyor of Negro art and\nliterary critic. Locke managed to position himself at the forefront of\none of the most significant and important artistic rebirths in American\nhistory. His seminal work, The New Negro, was ground-breaking\nin its presentation of Negro art as thoroughly self-expressive of the\nindividual artist, and not as merely representative of aesthetic,\ncultural and social possibilities. Locke's publication of The\nNew Negro was in many ways in direct defiance and contradiction of\nthe black intellectual elite of his day, most notably W. E. B. Du Bois,\nas well as being the advance guard of the aesthetic sentiments of the\naverage Negro of his day. There is evidence of his philosophical views,\nespecially in the areas of axiology, culture, race and ethnicity\nthroughout his writings on aesthetics. Major themes in Locke's\naesthetics include: universal human appeal and the relationship of\nuniversal and particular; the transition from folk art to high art; the\ncentrality of individual expressivity; and cross-cultural\ncommunicability through the aesthetic. Prior to the period of individual expression characteristic of the\nHarlem Renaissance, Negro art in Locke's estimation had as its\nprimary function representation of a Negro type that was socially\nacceptable and laudably ideal. The aim of much Negro art was to advance\npresentations of the Negro as civilized, cultured, and capable of\nmaking a worthwhile contribution to American society, or to portray\nblacks in America as a progressive people, needing only to be\nliberated from slavery or Jim Crow segregation to realize their true potential. In\ndischarging this representative function, Negro art was consumed with\nthe promulgation of stereotypes and counter-stereotypes. It had\nconstantly to react against negative portrayals and stifling social\npressures; to attempt to make out of Negro life and experience\nsomething worthy of respect, a fitting object of honor and emulation.\nAs Locke put it,   The primary consequence\nof this social environment on black aesthetics in the United States\naccording to Locke was its Ghettoization. In dealing with this\nspecialized subject matter of social uplift Negro aesthetics segregates\nitself from the broader American social context and fails to achieve\nuniversal human appeal. “The thinking Negro,” by whom Locke\nseems to have Du Bois primarily in mind, “has been induced to\nshare this same general attitude, to focus his attention on\ncontroversial issues, to see himself in the distorted perspective of a\nsocial problem” (NN 3–4).  Art at its best on Locke's view is not propaganda, and though\nthere may be some initial phase in which art is forced to perform such\na function that is not the ultimate goal. “Until\nrecently,” Locke comments “lacking self-understanding, we\nhave been almost as much of a problem to ourselves as we still are to\nothers.” Yet as “the thinking few know” as that\nself-understanding is achieved and worked into artistic expression the\nresult is “that in the reaction the vital inner grip of\nprejudice has been broken” (NN 4). This is the first significant\nchange in the social environment that produces the “New\nNegro”; namely, the attitude of young Negro artist to racial\nsegregation. Another change in American society that had a profound impact on\nthe aesthetic advancement of African-Americans at the time of\nLocke's publication of The New Negro was the Great\nMigration. One major consequence of “that shifting of the Negro\npopulation” was that it “made the Negro problem no longer\nexclusively or even predominantly Southern” (NN 5). Locke did not\nhowever regard the cause of the great migration as chiefly racial; that\nis, escape from the segregation of the South was not the major\nmotivation behind the mass African-American exodus from the South to\nthe North and Mid-West. Instead, The Great Migration brought with it a need for a plurality of\nsocial adjustments as the droves of African-Americans flooded into\nNorthern cities. Principal among this was the realization that the\nNegro was  Negro life in America according to\nLocke is comprised of many diverse elements. The plurality of groups\nthat congregated in places like Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia and\nHarlem all with varying motivations and group specific aims constituted\nsome of the largest concentrations of diverse segments of the Negro\npopulation. These circumstances coupled with the oppressive effects of\nprejudice forced myriad sectors of the African-American population to\ndiscover and interact with one another. Prior to that Locke claims that\n Locke explains that in part the artistic endeavors of the Negro\nhave failed to achieve universal resonance because the Negro himself\nhas been so poorly understood. He readily admits that “[i]t does\nnot follow that if the Negro were better known, he would be better\nliked or better treated[,]” and goes on to note that despite this\nfact “mutual understanding is basic for any subsequent\ncooperation and adjustment” predicated upon, or in pursuit of an\nunderstanding of the universality of Negro experiences as expressed in\nart. Moreover,   And in addressing that crucial fact,\nsuch efforts may go a long way towards facilitating an appreciation of\nNegro art as expressive both of the peculiar racial, ethnic, and\ncultural experiences of African-Americans, and as expressive of\nubiquitous aspects of human experience. It is a mere\n“fiction…that the life of the races is separate,”\nand a dangerously divisive one at that, “[t]he fact is that they\nhave touched too closely at the unfavorable and too lightly at the\nfavorable levels” (NN 9). Hence, it is not simply a failure of\ncontact, but a failure of the right sort of contact that accounts for\nthe under appreciation of the aesthetic life of black peoples. For his part, Locke argues, the \n“New Negro” in\nrecognizing “the necessity for fuller, truer\n self-expression,…[and] the realization of the unwisdom of\n allowing discrimination to segregate him mentally, and a counter\n attitude to cramp and fetter his own living” has played a vital role in demolishing “the\n‘spite-wall’ that the intellectuals built over the\n‘color-line[.]’” (NN, 9–10).\n  Life for the\nNegro in the early 1920's was steadily progressing toward the ideals\nof American democracy. The Negro of the time was also characterized by\na new vein; one around which there was a growing consensus primarily\nof feeling and attitude; rather than opinion or program. As Locke has\nit: Locke ends his exposition of what is characteristic of the New\nNegro with the observation that the reception of black aesthetic\nproducts is an experiment in democracy. As African-American art resists\nghettoization and increasingly makes its presence felt in the American\nartistic mainstream it seeks to establish itself as a subset of\nAmerican art; rather than, the totality of Negro American art. And since,\naccording to Locke, The North American Negro artist in being ‘new’ is a living instantiation of the fact\nthat no culture, people, race, or society is a static one. Such\nentities are always in process of transformation, and always a\ncomposite of myriad cultural, ethnic, racial, and social influences.\nThe emergence of the new is at once a presentation of what has been and\nan indication of what the future may hold. This is a deeply pragmatic\ncurrent running through Locke's aesthetic philosophy. Locke is\nlater critical of the Harlem Renaissance because it failed to sustain a\ncyclical process of rebirth. In the years following the height of the Harlem Renaissance he remarked later that that a new Negro\nmust be born every decade or two. Locke explains that the aesthetic renaissance that took place in\nHarlem and elsewhere was primarily a movement of young artists. The\nyouth, Locke claims, speak in distinctive overtones, and “out of\na unique experience and with particular representativeness” (NN\n47). The experiences of young American Negroes is uniquely representative\nbecause  Here we find an interesting problem in\nLockean exegesis: How is it that the aesthetic contribution is at once\ncharacterized by a disavowal of representativeness, while at the same\ntime being uniquely representative? Locke goes on to note that \nLocke's resolution of the seeming paradox comes by way of\nrecognizing that “[o]ur poets have now stopped speaking for the\nNegro[;]” the sort of representativeness characteristic of past\naesthetic pursuits and instead now “speak as Negroes” (NN\n48). The main difference being that “[w]here formally they spoke\nto others and tried to interpret,” the experiences of\nAfrican-Americans for white or other nonblack audiences “they now\nspeak to their own and try to express.” “They have” he notes\n“stopped posing, being nearer the attainment of poise” (NN\n48). With this change in the mind of the Negro artist the aim of art is\nno longer the presentation of an ideal type, or an effective\ncounter-stereotype; instead, it is the expression of the universal\ntruth contained in the particularity of Negro experiences. This is a major theme that runs throughout all of Locke's\naesthetic philosophy; the idea that within a particular manifestation\nof human experience can be found something of universal human\nsignificance. Indeed, this is the quintessential marker of “high\nart” or “classical art”. In the case of the young\nNegro artist Locke claims “[r]ace for them is but an idiom of\nexperience, a sort of added enriching adventure and discipline, giving\nsubtler overtones to life, making it more beautiful and interesting,\neven if more poignantly so. When viewed from this more objective\nattitude and “so experienced, it affords a deepening rather than\nnarrowing of social vision” (NN 48). The youth “constitute a new generation, not because of years\nonly, but because of the new aesthetic and a new philosophy of\nlife” (NN 49). Locke explicates this new aesthetic philosophy by\nway of comparison to “[t]he elder generation of Negro\nwriters” who were resigned to expressing themselves in\n“cautious moralism and guarded idealizations” (NN 49). This\ngeneration of artists, with \nThis hampered both the individual expressivity of the older generation\nof artists as well as their ability to communicate cross culturally the\ntruth of black experiences. The artist was not free to speak his\nheart or mind, but had to remain cognizant of the way he presented the\nNegro yet again. With the youth of the Harlem Renaissance there came a\n“newer motive,” for the younger generation of American Negro artists\nthe aim “in being racial is to be so purely for the sake of\nart.” (NN 51) The new artist does not take folksy racial types\nto be emblematic of anything but the individual artist. Locke sees this\nmanifested in the artist's ability to make of “the racial\nsubstance something technically distinctive,” a method of giving\nexpression to a specific type of experience that allows for full\nexpression of that experience across cultural, racial, or ethnic\nboundaries. In this way techniques that exist as “an idiom of\nstyle may become a contribution to general resources of art”;\n(NN 51) available in the end, not only to those who created,\ncultivated and refined them, but to any artist who wished to deal with\nthat particular idiom. In Locke's estimation, the spirituals are the quintessential\nNegro contribution to American art and culture; manifesting as they do\nso much, not only about the North American Negro and his aesthetic and cultural\nheritage and evolution, but also in standing as a paragon of processes\nof aesthetic transition and development. The best evidence, Locke seems to think, in support of the\nspirituals' claim to universality is that they have withstood the\ntest of time. As an art form they have outlived not only the\ngenerations that produced them but the peculiar social environment that\nenlivened them. Beyond this the spirituals have survived  In short, they have successfully made\nthe transition from folk art to formal music. The spirituals at once exemplify all of the three major themes of\nLocke's aesthetic philosophy: they are expressive of the\nindividuality of a given artist—think of the distinctiveness of\nPaul Robeson's baritone renderings of “Swing Low, Sweet\nChariot”; they have universal human appeal; and they epitomize\nthe process of transition from a folk art to high or classical art.\n“In its disingenuous simplicity, folk art is always despised and\nrejected at first; but generations after, it flowers again and\ntranscends the level of its origin” (NN 199). Negro folk music or spirituals contain the raw material for myriad\nnew musical developments. That material was at the time of the\npublication of The New Negro to Locke's mind\nunderdeveloped, but as Negro artists grew in sophistication and craft\nLocke saw the potential for them to complete the conversion of so\nfundamentally American and pedestrian an art form into an avenue for\ninsight into some of the most deeply emotional aspects of\nhumanity. Locke credits Du Bois with being among the first to give the\nspirituals “a serious and proper social interpretation,”\nwith his chapter in The Souls of Black Folks on the Sorrow\nSongs. “But underneath the broken words, childish imagery,\npeasant simplicity, lies” Locke notes  But whatever they may lack in terms of poetic form, they more\nthan compensate for in their ability to embody the religious mood. This\nNorth American Negro folk form is replete with the spirit of exaltation. The\nspirituals are remarkable for their ability to transcend the profound\ntragedy that gives birth to them and offer up a model of enduring\nhopefulness in this world or the next. “Their words are\ncolloquial,” Locke notes, being the products of unlettered folk\n“but their mood is epic” giving emotive expression to\nexperiences that exemplify the possibilities of humanity at its best\n(NN 201). The spirituals “are primitive, but their emotional\nartistry is perfect” (NN 201). Historically, Negro colleges were the mechanism through which the\nspirituals were popularized. The travelling choirs of Negro\ninstitutions such as Hampton University, Wilberforce University, Fisk\nUniversity and Tuskegee University performed the spirituals across the\ncountry as a means of raising funds for their respective institutions,\nall the while bringing to black and white audiences in the United\nStates knowledge and appreciation of this indigenous musical form. Many\nof these university choirs also recorded compilations of Negro\nspirituals and published them. It was thus, as Locke has it, that the\nspirituals were able to avoid simply falling out of fashion and failing\nto survive “that critical period of disfavor in which any folk\nproduct is likely to be snuffed out by the false pride of the\nsecond-generation” (NN 202). This, by Locke's lights, is\nnot an uncommon situation for folk arts to face, finding it necessary\nas they often do to resist being disavowed by subsequent generations\nwishing to distance themselves from the supposedly deficient quality of\nthe folk expression. Emotions and attitudes form the very foundation of Locke's\nphilosophy of value: undoubtedly, one reason that Locke was so enamored\nwith the spirituals was that as he understood them their primary\nartistic virtue was their deeply emotive character.\n“Emotionally,” he points out, “these songs are far\nfrom simple” (NN 205). There is to be found in the spiritual folk\nmusic of the American Negro the entire range of human moods and\nemotions, and within a given spiritual there can be a drastic change in\nmood from the deepest sorrow to glorious praise, as each and every song\nis infused with religious sentiment. Surprisingly, when it comes to the\nproblem of classification of the spirituals, Locke does not insist upon\nthe primary mode of classification being the feeling-quality of the\nsong as his value theory might suggest. In fact, Locke argues that  In the case of the spirituals Locke is in favor of a different\nmethod of classification because contemporary interpreters of the\nNegro's music tend to mischaracterize, or characterize in a way\nthat is not true to the folk that produced it, the music of the Negro.\nLocke laments the fact that “at present many a half secularized\nballad is mistaken for a ‘spiritual,’ and many a\ncamp-meeting shout for a folk hymn” (NN 205). He believed the\nfolk music of the Negro is best categorized according to the sort of\nactivity they inspired. “From this point of view” Locke\nclaims However, discriminating Negro folk music into types on the basis of\nthe folk activity that underlies them is not necessarily to exclude\nthe emotive content of the song. In fact, it seems that what is really\nbeing discriminated is the active expression of the underlying\nemotional content, i.e., the activity that is most commonly associated\nwith a particular emotion or mood. And here we see perhaps the most\ndirect effect that Locke's axiology has on his assessment of\nspirituals discriminating them as he does into types in terms of their\nfeeling-quality, but also linking each form with a set of imperatives\nin this case, a practical imperative understood by the type of\nactivity that each song is used to motivate. Locke sees as a major problem with the scholarship on Negro folk\nmusic in his day the tendency to overemphasize one of the various\ndistinctive elements of the music over the others. The result was a\njaundiced view of Negro music. “Strain out and emphasize the\nmelodic element” Locke informs \n\nLurking in the background of all of this talk of the “New\nNegro” is the assumption that there is something distinctively\nNegro about at least some American art. As to what that is, or could\nbe, answers are sometimes extremely hard to come by. But, Locke warns\n \n Beyond this Locke thinks it a meaningful query to\nask whether the racial concept has any place in art at all. Perhaps it\nwould be better to understand art as a cultural or social mode of\nproduction that cuts across racial and ethnic divisions. \n\nIn answering the question “Who is Negro?” Locke begins\nby exposing a common misguided assumption in such queries:  Locke sees this as the unfortunate consequence of the past need\nto proffer counter-stereotypes to combat demeaning stereotypes of Negro\npersons. Counter-stereotypes may well contain some element of truth,\nbut they fail to convey the whole truth about as diverse a population\nof human beings as Negroes in the United States, let alone the Americas\nor Negroes the World over. There is no distinctive singular Negro type.\nThe answer then to the question posed “who is Negro?” is no\nNegro in particular. The Negro is a dynamic and multifaceted population\nadmitting of myriad cultural and social forms characterized as those are\nby variegated linguistic, religious and artistic elements. This is\nimportant for Locke to note as the Negro of his day was thought to be\nclassless, undifferentiated, and ethnically homogeneous. In fact, Locke\nhimself thought it possible (and actual) for human beings biologically\nsimilar in the way that American race thinking presupposes to be\nmembers of different races. A full and accurate artistic portrayal of\nwho is Negro would, Locke argued, have to picture the many diverse\nNegro strands in their own right, weaving together from these diverse\nthreads a multifaceted presentation of Negro experiences. \n\n“Turning to the other basic question,—what is\nNegro,” Locke begins by narrowing the question to “what\nmakes a work of art Negro, if indeed any such nomenclature is\nproper,—its authorship, its theme or its idiom?” (WWN 211).\nIn other words, what gives a particular work of art its distinctive, if\nany, racial character: the racial identity of its author, its treatment\nof themes characteristic of a particular racial experience in a\nparticular place, or its use of styles and modes of expression peculiar\nto a given people? Of these three candidates for the foundation of\nNegro art Locke claims each has had its day depending on the social\nenvironment that was prevalent at the time. Locke dismisses nearly out\nof hand the first option remarking that many a Negro artist has\nproduced the most amateurish works of art due primarily to their poor\nmastery of Negro idioms, and inadequate treatment of Negro themes. What\nis more, some white (or at least non-Negro) artist have been quite\nadept in either their use of characteristically Negro styles, or their\ndealings with Negro motifs. Of course, it stands to reason that artist\nsteeped in the cultural, ethnic and racial environments that give rise\nto these idioms and themes are most likely to master their use and\nexpression, and that persons who do so are most likely to be members of\nthese communities, having the same racial, ethnic or cultural\nidentities as other members. However, such communal membership is not a\nnecessary condition for the work of a particular artist to count\namongst the works that comprise a racially distinctive body of art such\nas might be called “Negro art.” \n\nLocke understood race as primarily a product of social culture.\nLocke denies as do nearly all contemporary race theorists that races\nare biologically distinct categories of human beings. Locke maintained\nthat culture and race were distinct, but often overlapping categories.\nThere is no tight causal or otherwise necessary connection between race\nand culture. The two are mutually exclusive even though they do\nsometimes vary together or otherwise correspond. Race, for Locke, is\nnot determinative of culture or civilization.  Locke's\nposition on race does not deny, as some of his contemporaries concerned\nwith the notion of race and culture did, that there ever is a\nsignificant connection between racial and cultural factors, nor does it\ndeny that “race stands for significant social characters and\nculture-traits or represents in given historical contexts\ncharacteristic differentiations of culture-type” (CRASC 188).\nThis is primarily a cautionary observation on Locke's part seeing\nas how  Locke has some hesitation about the prudence and possibility of\ncompletely eradicating racial categories. He states, \n\nLocke attributes the original idea that race is a primary\ndetermining factor in culture to the work of Arthur de Gobineau, though\nhe thinks the main scientific justification for the view has been\noffered by those who seek to interpret culture in evolutionary terms\nsuch as the social evolutionism of Herbert Spencer. Positing a fixed\nlink between race and culture was useful for such theorists in\ndeveloping a step-by-step account of the development of cultures. But\neven in Locke's day, the supposed scientific foundations of such\ntheoretical positions faced challenges. In light of that Locke thinks\nit understandable for some to want to correct this misinterpretation of\nthe facts by insisting that there is no connection at all between race\nand culture. We see here again perhaps some of the influence that\npragmatist thinkers, in this case Dewey, may have had on Locke, as\nDewey was apt to point out on numerous occasions the shortcomings of\nSpencer's social Darwinism, and chiefly its attempt to offer a\nuniversal account of all aspects of human development. Locke worried\nthat extreme cultural relativism  It is “[t]he stability of\nsuch factors and their resistance to direct historical\nmodification” Locke thought, which \n\nLocke held that race was in point of fact a social and cultural\ncategory rather than a biological one. For this reason he developed the\nnotion of ethnic race or culture group. By ethnic race, I take Locke to\nmean a peculiar set of psychological and affective responsive\ndispositions, expressed or manifested as cultural traits, socially\ninherited and able to be attributed through historical\ncontextualization to a specifiable group of people. The concept of\nethnic race is a way of preserving the demonstrated distinctiveness of\nvarious groupings of human beings in terms of characteristic traits,\nlifestyles, forms of expression; without resulting to the\nscientifically invalidated notion of biological race.\n“Race,” Locke argues “would have been regarded as\nprimarily a matter of social [as opposed to biological]\nheredity,” if only the science of his day had reached a more\ntenable understanding of the relationship of race to culture which\nwould likely have resulted from focusing more on the ethnic; rather\nthan, anthropological factors. The distinctiveness of a given race\nwould be understood as the result of “the selective psychological\n“set” of established cultural reactions” (CRASC 191).\n“The best consensus of opinion” on the basis of\nLocke's study of the past, and for his day current, sociological,\nanthropological, and psychological scholarship on the subject of race,\nwas that, \n\nThe notion of ethnic race is better able to capture the myriad\ndifferences between culture groups in terms of the actual social,\ncultural and historical conditions that give rise to such variation,\nand without the scientifically indefensible reliance on biological\nfactors. On this view, race is no longer thought to be the progenitor\nof culture; instead race is understood to be a cultural product. Locke\nheld that the more objective analysis of culture he advocated would\nlikely result in the development over time of distinctive culture-types\nfor which it may prove possible to work out some principle of\ndevelopment or evolution. This he thought might eventually make it\npossible to develop “a standard of value for relative culture\ngrading” (CRASC 194). \n\nNearly every culture is highly composite; consisting as most due in\nthe union of various social and historical influences; moreover, every\nethnic group in the unique outcome of a specific social history. A more\nscientific understanding of man replaces the abstract artifice of\nbiological race, and requires that we deal with concrete culture-types\nwhich are frequently complex amalgamations of supposed races united\nprincipally by entrenchment of customary reactions, standardized\npractices, traditional forms of expression and interaction, in sum, the\nspecific history of a given people in a particular place. It is\nnoteworthy and perhaps illuminating of Locke's conception of\nethnic or social race that the groupings of human persons formerly\nthought to constitute “races” in the biological sense such\nas “Negro,” “Caucasian,” or “Asian”\nare in fact each composed of several different social or ethnic races.\nOn Locke's view there are many so-called “Negro,”\n“Caucasian,” or “Asian” races. This revised\nunderstanding of culture constitutes in Locke's estimation a\nfundamental paradigm shift in the study of human cultures ”[s]o\nconsiderable…[in] emphasis and meaning that at times it does\nseem that the best procedure would be to substitute the term\nrace the term culture group“ (CRASC 194).  Locke\nquickly notes while the notion of race has been invalidated as an\nexplanation of culture groups understood as totalities, race does help\nto explain various cultural components within a given culture.\n“Race operates as tradition,” Locke noted, “as\npreferred traits and values,” changes in these aspects of culture\nin a distinctive way by a subset of a culture group constitutes\n“ethnic remoulding” (CRASC 195). Race becomes a term that\ndesignates the specific outcome of the “peculiar selective\npreferences” in favor of some, and against other, culture-traits\nof a given group. “Such facts” Locke observed","contact.mail":"jcarter@jjay.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"jjay.cuny.edu"}]
