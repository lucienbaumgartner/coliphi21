Such acts are staples of\ncommunicative life, but only became a topic of sustained\ninvestigation, at least in the English-speaking world, in the middle\nof the twentieth \ncentury.[1] \nSince that time “speech act theory” has become influential\nnot only within philosophy, but also in linguistics, psychology, legal\ntheory, artificial intelligence, literary theory, and feminist thought\namong other scholarly \n disciplines.[2] \nRecognition of the significance of speech\nacts has illuminated the ability of language to do other things than\ndescribe reality. In the process the boundaries among the philosophy\nof language, the philosophy of action, aesthetics, the philosophy of\nmind, political philosophy, and ethics have become less sharp. In\naddition, an appreciation of speech acts has helped lay bare a\nnormative structure implicit in linguistic practice, including even\nthat part of this practice concerned with describing reality. Much\nrecent research aims at an accurate characterization of this normative\nstructure underlying linguistic practice.\n\n\n\nBertrand Russell’s  Theory of Descriptions \nwas a paradigm for many philosophers in the twentieth century. One\nreason for this is that it suggested a way to respond to longstanding\nphilosophical problems by showing them to be specious. Russell argued\nthat such sentences as ‘The present King of Singapore is\nbald,’ and, ‘The round square is impossible,’\npossess superficial grammatical forms that are misleading as to their\nunderlying logical structure. In so doing he showed how such sentences\ncan be meaningful without this fact obliging us to posit current\nSingaporean monarchs or round squares. Many philosophers in what came\nto be known as the Ordinary Language movement were inspired by this\nachievement to argue that classic philosophical problems (e.g., of\nfree will, the relation of mind to body, truth, the nature of\nknowledge, and of right and wrong) likewise rested on a\nmisunderstanding of the language in which these problem are\ncouched. In How to Do Things with Words,\n J.L. Austin for instance writes, \nThe Ordinary Language movement, with its broad claim that the meaning\nof an expression should be equated with its use, and its desire to\ntranscend traditional philosophical perplexities, did not achieve the\nrevolution of which Austin speaks. Nonetheless one of its enduring\nlegacies is the notion of a speech act. \nOne way of appreciating the distinctive features of speech acts is in\ncontrast with other well-established phenomena within the philosophy\nof language and linguistics. Accordingly in this entry we will\nconsider the relations among speech acts and: semantic content,\ngrammatical mood, speaker-meaning, logically perfect languages,\nperlocutions,\nperformatives, presuppositions,\nand implicature. This will enable us to\nsituate speech acts within their ecological niche. \n\nWhereas an act of speech is any act of\nuttering[3]\nmeaningful words, ‘speech act’ is a term of\nart. As a first approximation, speech acts are those acts that can (though need\nnot) be performed by saying that one is doing so. On this conception,\nresigning, promising, asserting and asking are all speech acts, while\nconvincing, insulting and growing six inches are not. One can, for\ninstance, resign by saying, “I resign…”, although one\ncan also resign from a position without describing oneself as doing\nso. However, this conception is too inclusive, since it also\ncounts whispering as a speech act even though one can whisper a string\nof nonsense words without meaning anything. Instead a more accurate\ncharacterization of speech acts builds on Grice’s notion of\nspeaker meaning. This notion is discussed further in Section 5 below,\nbut for now it is enough to note that in looking at my watch, I might\nbe trying to tell the time; or I might be trying to indicate to you\nthat it’s time for us to leave. The latter (but not the former)\nis a case of speaker meaning. \nAccordingly, a speech act is a type of act that can be\nperformed by speaker meaning that one is doing so. This conception\nstill counts resigning, promising, asserting and asking as speech\nacts, while ruling out convincing, insulting and whispering. This\ndefinition leaves open the possibility of speech acts being performed\nwordlessly, as well as speech acts being performed without saying that\nyou are doing so. Our characterization of speech acts captures this\nfact in emphasizing speaker meaning rather than the uttering of any\nwords. \nSpeech acts are thus also to be distinguished from\nperformatives. ‘Performative’ is another technical term,\nand as used here it refers in the first instance to a kind of\nsentence. A performative sentence is in the first person,\npresent tense, indicative mood, active voice, that describes its\nspeaker as performing a speech act. ‘I assert that George is the\nculprit,’ is a performative sentence by this test. As we have\nseen, one can perform a speech act without uttering a\nperformative. Further, since it is merely a type of sentence, one can\nutter a performative without performing a speech act. For instance,\nwhile talking in my sleep I might say, “I hereby promise to\nclimb the Eiffel Tower,” without thereby making any promise. We\nmay also define a performative utterance as an utterance of\na performative sentence that is also a speech\nact.[4] \nMore nomenclature: ‘Speech act’ and\n‘illocution’ will here be used synonymously. The latter\nterm is due to Austin, who used ‘illocutionary force’ to\nrefer to a dimension of communicative acts. (It is nowadays common\nalso to use ‘illocute’ as a verb meaning ‘to perform\na speech act.’) Austin’s reason for using\n‘force’ begins with the observation that, construed as a\nbit of observable behavior, the communicative significance of an act\nmay be underdetermined by what has been said or observably done. I bow\ndeeply before you. So far you may not know whether I am paying\nobeisance, responding to indigestion, or looking for a wayward contact\nlens. So too, an utterance of a meaningful sentence (which Austin\ncalls a locutionary act) such as ‘You’ll be more\npunctual in the future,’ may leave you wondering whether I am\nmaking a prediction or issuing a command or even a threat. The\ncolloquial question, “What is the force of those words?”\nis often used to elicit an answer. In asking such a question we\nacknowledge a grasp of those words’ meaning but seek to know how\nthat meaning is to be taken–as a threat, as a prediction, or as\na command. \nOr so it seems. In an early challenge to Austin, Cohen (1964) argues\nthat the notion of illocutionary force is otiose provided we already\nhave in place the notion of a sentence’s meaning (Austin’s locutionary\nmeaning). Cohen contends that for a performative sentence such as\n‘I promise to read that novel,’ its meaning already\nguarantees that it is a promise. On the other hand, for a sentence\nthat is not a performative, such as ‘I will read that\nnovel,’ if it is understood as being used to make a promise, the\npromise is still implicit in the sentence’s meaning. In either case,\nCohen concludes, meaning already guarantees force and so we do not\nrequire an extra-semantic notion to do so. \nCohen’s reasoning assumes that any utterance of ‘I promise\nto read that novel’ is a promise. But as we have seen with the\ncase of the somniloquist, neither a sentence, nor even the utterance\nof a sentence, is sufficient on its own for the performance of a\nspeech act, be it a promise or some other. In a similar spirit to that\nof Cohen, Searle (1968, p. 407) observes that a serious and literal\nutterance of ‘I promise to read that novel,’ made under\nwhat he terms “conditions of successful utterance”, also\ncounts as a promise. Searle concludes from this that some locutionary\nacts are also illocutionary acts, and infers from this in turn that\nfor some sentences, their locutionary meaning determines their\nillocutionary force. This last inference is, however, a non\nsequitur. As we have seen, the aforementioned sentence’s\nmeaning does not determine the illocutionary force with which it is\nuttered. Rather, when that sentence is uttered in such a way as to\nconstitute a promise, what determines that force is the meaning of the\nsentence together with such factors as the speaker’s\nbeing serious and other contextual conditions being met. \nWe may thus agree with Searle that some locutionary acts are also\nillocutionary acts, without losing sight of our earlier observation\nthat locutionary meaning underdetermines illocutionary force. This\nfact about underdetermination is implied by Davidson’s Thesis of the\nAutonomy of Linguistic Meaning, according to which once a bit of\nlanguage has acquired a conventional meaning, it can be used for any\nof a variety of extra-linguistic purposes (Davidson, 1979). Green 1997\nargues for a qualification of Davidson’s Autonomy Thesis to recognize\nsentences having the feature that if they are used in a speech act\nall, then there is at least one other illocutionary force that their\nutterance must have. Even in light of this qualified version of the\nAutonomy Thesis, the most that can be said of, ‘I promise to\nclimb the Eiffel Tower,’ is that it is designed to be used to\nmake promises, just as common nouns are designed to be used to refer\nto things and predicates are designed to characterize things referred\nto. Below (Section 6.3) we shall consider the view that force is a\ncomponent of meaning, albeit not of a sentence’s\nmeaning.[5] \nLet us return, then, to an elucidation of our distinction between what\na speaker says and the force of her utterance. A grammatical sentence\ncomposed of meaningful words is commonly thought to express a\n“content,” which is determined by what that sentence\nliterally means together with features of the context of\nutterance. Suppose I say to someone in a crowded subway, “You’re\nstanding on my foot.” I am most likely trying to convey the\nmessage that he should move. However, what I literally say is only\nthat the addressee in question is standing on my foot. This is the\ncontent of my utterance. Many if not most utterances of grammatical\nsentences composed of meaningful words express more than those\nsentences’ contents. Pragmaticians, however, commonly distinguish\ncontent from other aspects of meaning conveyed by an utterance. On\nthis way of thinking, two intertranslatable sentences of different\nlanguages will express the same content, and certain transformations\nof a sentence within a language are commonly thought to express the\nsame content. Thus, ‘Mary saw John,’ and ‘John was\nseen by Mary,’ will express the same content even if a speaker’s\nuse of one rather than another of these will carry a distinctive\nsuggestion. For indicative sentences, such contents are typically\ncalled Propositions. (In what follows I will capitalize this\nterm to signify that it is in part technical.) Propositions, then, are\nthe contents of indicative sentences, are what such sentences express,\nand, further, are often thought to be the primary bearers of truth\nvalue. \nIllocutionary force and semantic content are often taken to be\ndistinct from one another, not just in the way that your left and\nright hand are distinct, but rather by virtue of falling into\ndifferent categories. Stenius 1967 elucidates this distinction, noting\nthat in chemical parlance a radical is a group of atoms\nnormally incapable of independent existence, whereas a functional\ngroup is the grouping of those atoms in a compound that is\nresponsible for certain of that compound’s properties. Analogously, a\nProposition is itself communicatively inert. For instance, merely\nexpressing the Proposition that it is snowing is not to make a move in\na “language game”. Rather, such a move is only made by\nputting forth a Proposition with an illocutionary force such as\nassertion, conjecture, command, etc. The chemical analogy gains\nfurther support from the fact that just as a chemist might isolate\nradicals held in common among various compounds, the student of\nlanguage may isolate a common element held among ‘Is the door\nshut?’, ‘Shut the door!’, and ‘The door is\nshut’. This common element is the Proposition that the door is\nshut, queried in the first sentence, commanded to be made true in the\nsecond, and asserted in the third. According to the chemical analogy,\nthen: In light of this analogy we may see, following Stenius, that just\nas the grouping of a set of atoms is not itself another atom or set of\natoms, so too the forwarding of a Proposition with a particular\nillocutionary force is not itself a further component of Propositional\ncontent. \nEncouraged by the chemical analogy, a central tenet in the study of\nspeech acts is that content may remain fixed while force\nvaries. The force of\nan utterance also underdetermines its content: Just from the fact that\na speaker has made a promise, we cannot deduce what she has promised\nto do. For these reasons, students of speech acts contend that a given\ncommunicative act may be analyzed into two components: force and\ncontent. While semantics studies the contents of communicative acts,\npragmatics studies their force. \nThe force/content distinction also finds parallels in our\nunderstanding of mentality. Speech acts are not only moves in a\n“language game.” They also often purport to express of\nstates of mind with analogous structural properties. An assertion that\nit is snowing purports to express the speaker’s belief that it is\nsnowing. A promise to read Middlemarch purports to express\nthe speaker’s intention to read Middlemarch. We find evidence\nfor these relationships in the fact that it is in some sense absurd to\nsay, ‘It’s snowing, but I don’t believe that it is,’ and\n‘I promise to read Middlemarch, but I have no intention\nof doing \nso.’[6] \nFurther, just as we may distinguish between\nan asserting and what is asserted (the so-called\n“ing/ed ambiguity” for verbs such as\n‘assert’), and a promising from what is\npromised, we may also distinguish between a state of\nbelieving and what is believed, and a state or act of intending and\nwhat is intended. Searle 1983 delineates structural analogies between\nspeech acts and the mental states they express. Pendlebury 1986\nsuccinctly explains the merits of this approach. \nIn spite of these structural analogies, we may still wonder why an\nelucidation of the notion of force is important for a theory of\ncommunication. That A is an important component of\ncommunication, and that A underdetermines B, do not\njustify the conclusion that B is an important component of\ncommunication. Content also underdetermines the decibel level at which\nwe speak but this fact does not justify adding decibel level to our\nrepertoire of core concepts for pragmatics or the philosophy of\nlanguage. Why should force be thought any more worthy of admission to\nthis set of core concepts than decibel level? One reason for an\nasymmetry in our treatment of force and decibel level is that the\nformer, but not the latter, seems to be a component of speaker\nmeaning: Force is a feature not of what is said but of how what\nis said is meant; decibel level, by contrast, is a feature at most of\nthe way in which something is said. This point is developed in Section\n5 below. \nWe have spoken thus far as if the contents of speech acts must be\nPropositions, and indeed Searle routinely analyzes speech acts as\nhaving the form F(p) (e.g., 1975, p. 344), where\n‘F’ is the force component and\n‘p’ the Propositional content component. However,\nin the last two decades linguistic semantics has developed formal\nrepresentations of contents for the two other major grammatical moods\nbesides the indicative, namely the interrogative and the\nimperative. On the strength of the analyses of Hamblin (1958), Bell\n(1975), Pendlebury (1986) and others, one strategy for the semantics\nof interrogatives is to construe them as expressing sets of\npropositions rather than a single proposition, where each element of\nthe putative set is a complete answer to the question at issue. Thus\nthe content expressed by ‘How many doors are shut?’ will\nbe {<No doors are shut>, <One door is shut>, …}\nwhere the ellipsis will be filled by as many other Propositions as it\nis reasonable to interpret the questioner as asking after. Call such a\nset an Interrogative. A complete answer to an Interrogative\nis an element of the set by which it is defined; a partial answer is a\nsubset of that set containing two or more members, as would naturally\nbe expressed by the sentence ‘Between two and four doors are\nshut.’ On the present conceptualization, just as we may\ndistinguish between expressing and asserting a Propositional content,\nwe may also distinguish between expressing an Interrogative and asking\na question. One merely expresses an Interrogative in such an utterance\nas, ‘John wonders how many doors are shut.’ In fact, a\nsingle utterance may express two Interrogatives while asking neither,\nas in ‘How many doors are shut will depend on how many customers\nare trying on clothes.’ Asking a question is no less substantial\na conversational move than is making an assertion. \nSimilarly, work by Hamblin (1987), Belnap (1990), Portner (2004) and\nothers suggests semantic analyses for sentences in the imperative\nmood: on one approach an imperative expresses a property, and when one\nspeaker issues an imperative that her addressee accepts, that property\nis added to her “to do list”, itself a parameter of what\nwe will later describe as conversational score (Section 7). \nIn light of the above liberalization of the notion of sentential\ncontent to accommodate the contents of non-indicative sentences, we\nmay rephrase Stenius’s chemical analogy as follows: \nwith the understanding that different types of sentential content will\ncorrespond to the different grammatical moods. This refined analogy\nwould in turn require there to be different types of\nradical.[7] \nIn some cases we can make something the case by saying that it\nis. Alas, I cannot lose ten pounds by saying that I am doing so, nor\ncan I persuade you of a claim by saying that I am doing so. On the\nother hand I can promise to meet you tomorrow by uttering the words,\n“I promise to meet you tomorrow,” and if I have the\nauthority to do so, I can even appoint you to an office by saying,\n“I hereby appoint you.” (I can also appoint you without\nmaking the force of my act explicit: I might just say, “You are\nnow Treasurer of the Corporation.”) Only an appropriate\nauthority, speaking at the appropriate time and place, can: christen a\nship, pronounce a couple married, appoint someone to an administrative\npost, declare the proceedings open, or rescind an offer. Austin,\nin How To Do Things With Words, details the conditions that\nmust be met for a given speech act to be\nperformed felicitously. \nFailures of felicity fall into two classes: misfires\nand abuses. The former are cases in which the putative speech\nact fails to be performed at all. If I utter, before the QEII,\n“I declare this ship the Noam Chomsky,” I have not\nsucceeded in naming anything because I lack the authority to do\nso. My act thus misfires in that I’ve performed an act of speech but\nno speech act. Other attempts at speech acts might misfire because\ntheir addressee fails to respond with an appropriate uptake:\nI cannot bet you $100 on who will win the election unless you accept\nthat bet. If you do not accept that bet, then I have tried to bet but\nhave not succeeded in betting. As we will see in Section 9, a\nsystematic unwillingness on the part of a speaker’s interlocutors to\nrespond with the requisite uptake may compromise that speaker’s\nfreedom of speech. \nSome speech acts can be performed–that is, not\nmisfire—while still being less than felicitous. I promise to\nmeet you for lunch tomorrow, but haven’t the least intention of making\ngood. Here I have promised all right, but the act is not felicitous\nbecause it is not sincere. My act is, more precisely,\nan abuse because although it is a speech act, it fails to\nlive up to a standard appropriate for speech acts of its\nkind. Sincerity is a paradigm condition for the felicity of speech\nacts. Austin foresaw a program of research in which thousands of types\nof speech act would be studied in detail, with felicity conditions\nelucidated for each.[8] \nAs observed by Sbisà 2007, not only can I perform a speech act\nby speaker meaning that I am doing so, I can also\nsubsequently rescind that act. I cannot, it would seem,\nchange the past, and so nothing I can do on Wednesday can change the\nfact that I made a promise or assertion on Monday. However, on\nWednesday I may be able to retract a claim I made on\nMonday. I can’t take back a punch or a burp; the most I can do is\napologize for one of these infractions, and perhaps make amends. By\ncontrast, not only can I apologize or make amends for a claim I now\nregret; I can also withdraw it. Likewise, you may allow me on\nWednesday to retract the promise I made to you on Monday. In both\nthese cases of assertion and promise, I am now no longer beholden to\nthe commitments that the speech acts engender in spite of the fact\nthat the past is fixed. Just as one can, under appropriate conditions,\nperform a speech act by speaker meaning that one is doing so, so too\none can, under the right conditions, retract that very speech act. \n\nAustin famously denied that performatives are statements (1962,\np. 6). This may be taken either as the denial that performative\nsentences, even those in the indicative grammatical mood, have truth\nvalue; or instead as the denial that utterances of performative\nsentences, even when such sentences have truth value, are\nassertions. One can consistently hold that an indicative sentence has\ntruth value, and even that it may be uttered in such a way as to say\nsomething true, while denying that its utterance is an\nassertion. (Testing a microphone in a windowless room, I utter,\n“It’s raining,” and it happens to be raining outside. Here\nI have said something true but have made no assertion.) \nLemmon 1962 argues that performative utterances are true on the ground\nthat they are instances of a wider class of sentences whose utterance\nguarantees their truth. If sound, this argument would show that\nperformatives have truth value, but not that they are assertions. It\nalso leaves unanswered the question why some verb phrases such as\n‘I promise’ may be used performatively while others cannot\nbe so used. Sinnott-Armstrong 1994 also argues that performatives can\nhave truth value without addressing the question whether they are also\nused to make assertions. Reimer 1995 argues that while performatives\nhave truth values, they are not also assertions. Adopting a similar\nstrategy, Jary 2007 aims to explain how utterances of such sentences\nas “I order you to clean the kitchen,” can succeed in\nbeing orders. In so doing he draws on Green’s 2007 analysis of\nshowing to argue that such utterances show (rather than merely\ndescribe) the force of the speaker’s utterance. Because\n‘show’ is factive, if such an utterance shows its force,\nthen it must have that force. \nMost challenges to Austin, however, construe performatives as\nassertions and attempt to explain their properties in that\nlight. Ginet 1979 argues that performative verbs\n(‘promise,’ ‘appoint’, etc.) name the kinds of\nacts that one can perform by asserting that one is doing so, and\nelaborates on why this is so. In this way he offers an account of how\nperformatives work that depends on the assumption that performative\nutterances are assertions. Starting from that same assumption, Bach\n1975 contends that ‘I order you to clean the kitchen’ is\nan assertion, and proceeds to explain on this basis how the speaker is\nindirectly also issuing an order. This explanation depends on the\nspeaker’s being able to count on the addressee’s ability\nto discern the speaker’s communicative intention. In later work,\nsuch as Bach and Harnish 1978, and 1992, this view is refined with a\nnotion of standardization, so that a sufficiently common practice of\nissuing assertions with performative effect enables speakers and\nhearers to bypass complex inferential reasoning and jump by default to\na conclusion about the illocution being performed. Reimer 1995\nchallenges Bach and Harnish on the ground that hearers do not seem to\nimpute assertoric force to the indicative sentences speakers utter\nwith performative effect; her criticism would evidently carry over to\nGinet’s proposal. Instead Reimer contends that\nperformative utterances rest on systems of what she terms\nillocutionary conventions to achieve their performative effects. \n\nSearle 1969, p. 62–4, had argued that a performative formula such as\n“I promise to…” is an “illocutionary force\nindicator” in the sense that it is a device whose role is to\nmake explicit the force of the speaker’s utterance. Making something\nexplicit, however, would seem to involve characterizing an independent\nevent or state of affairs, and as a result Searle’s account\npresupposes that speakers can imbue their utterances with the force of\ndemotions and excommunications; yet this is what was to be\nexplained. Realizing this, Searle and Vanderveken (1985) characterize\nperformatives as speech acts having the force of\ndeclarations. Uncontroversial examples of this speech act are\ndeclaring war or adjourning a meeting. Searle 1989 then acknowledges\nthat this account pushes us back to the question how certain\nexpressions come to have the power to make declarations. In that same\nwork he offers an answer that depends on the view that in uttering a\nsentence with a performative prefix, a speaker manifests an intention\nto perform an act of a certain kind: in uttering the words, ‘I\norder you to close the door’, I manifest an intention to order\nyou to close the door, etc. Searle also takes it that manifesting an\nintention to perform a speech act is sufficient for the performance of\nthat act. On this basis, Searle goes on to attempt to derive the\nassertoric nature of performatives, holding that when uttered in such\na way as to say something true, they are also assertions. \n\nAustin distinguishes illocutionary acts into five categories:\nverdictives (in which a speaker gives a verdict, e.g. acquitting and\ndiagnosing), exercitives (in which speakers exercise powers, rights or\ninfluence, e.g. excommunicating and resigning), commissives (in which\nspeakers commit themselves to causes or courses of action,\ne.g. promising and betting), behabitives (concerning attitudes and\nsocial behavior, e.g. apologizing and toasting), and expositives (in\nwhich speakers clarify how their utterances fit into lines of\nreasoning, e.g., postulating and defining). \nSearle (1975) criticizes Austin’s taxonomy on two central\ngrounds. First, Austin’s methodology is unduly lexicographic,\nassuming that we can learn about the range and limits of illocutionary\nacts by studying illocutionary verbs in English or other natural\nlanguages. However, Searle observes, nothing rules out the possibility\nof there being illocutionary acts that are not named by a verb either\nin a particular language such as Swahili or Bengali, or indeed in any\nlanguage at all; similarly, two non-synonymous illocutionary verbs may\nyet name one and the same illocutionary act. \nSecond, Searle argues that the principles of distinction among\nAustin’s categories are unclear. For instance, behavitives seem\nto be a heterogeneous group with little unifying principle. Similarly,\n‘describe’ appears both as a verdictive and as an\nexpositive whereas one would expect taxonomic categories to be\nmutually exclusive. More generally, Austin’s brief account of\neach category gives no direction as to why this way of delineating\nthem does so along their most fundamental features. Searle offers a\nnew categorization of speech acts based on relatively clear principles\nof distinction. To appreciate this it will help to explain some of the\nbasic concepts he uses for this purpose. \n\nConsider an example derived from Anscombe (1963): a woman sends her\nhusband to the grocery store with a list of things to procure;\nunbeknownst to him he is also being trailed by a detective concerned\nto make a list of what the man buys. By the time the husband and\ndetective are in the checkout line, their two lists contain exactly\nthe same items. The contents of the two lists differ, however, along\nanother dimension. For the contents of the husband’s list guide what\nhe puts in his shopping cart. Insofar, his list exhibits\nworld-to-word direction of fit: It is, so to speak, the job\nof the items in his cart to conform to what is on his list. By\ncontrast, it is the job of the detective’s list to conform with the\nworld, in particular to what is in the husband’s cart. As such, the\ndetective’s list has word-to-world direction of fit: The onus\nis on those words to conform to how things are. Speech acts such as\nassertions and predictions have word-to-world direction of fit, while\nspeech acts such as commands have world-to-word direction of fit. \n\nNot all speech acts appear to have direction of fit. I can thank you\nby saying “Thank you,” and it is widely agreed that\nthanking is a speech act. However, thanking seems to have neither of\nthe directions of fit we have discussed thus far. Similarly, asking\nwho is at the door is a speech act, but it does not seem to have\neither of the directions of fit we have thus far mentioned. Some would\nrespond by construing questions as a form of imperative (e.g.,\n“Tell me who is at the door!”), and then ascribing the\ndirection of fit characteristic of imperatives to questions. This\nleaves untouched, however, banal cases such as thanking or even,\n“Hooray for Arsenal!” Some authors, such as Searle and\nVanderveken 1985, describe such cases as having “null”\ndirection of fit. That characterization is evidently distinct from\nsaying such speech acts have no direction of fit at\nall.[9] \n\nDirection of fit is also not so fine-grained as to enable us to\ndistinguish speech acts meriting different treatment. Consider\nasserting that the center of the Milky Way is inhabited by a black\nhole, as opposed to conjecturing that the center of the Milky Way is\nso inhabited. These two acts are subject to different norms: The\nformer purports to be a manifestation of knowledge, while the latter\ndoes not. This is suggested by the fact that it is appropriate to\nreply to the assertion with, “How do you know?”\n(Williamson 1996), while that is not an appropriate response to the\nconjecture (Green 2017). Nevertheless, both the assertion and\nconjecture have word-to-world direction of fit. Might there be other\nnotions enabling us to mark differences between speech acts with the\nsame direction of fit? \n\nOne suggestion might come from the related notion of conditions of\nsatisfaction. This notion generalizes that of truth. As we saw in\n2.3, it is internal to the activity of assertion that it aims to\ncapture how things are. When an assertion does so, not only is it\ntrue, it has hit its target; the aim of the assertion has been met. A\nsimilar point may be made of imperatives: it is internal to the\nactivity of issuing an imperative that the world is enjoined to\nconform to it. The imperative is satisfied just in case it is\nfulfilled. Assertions and imperatives both have conditions of\nsatisfaction—truth in the first place, and conformity in the\nsecond. In addition, it might be held that questions have answerhood\nas their conditions of satisfaction: A question hits its target just\nin case it finds an answer, often in a speech act, such as an\nassertion, that answers the question posed. Like the notion of\ndirection of fit, however, the notion of conditions of satisfaction is\ntoo coarse-grained to enable us to make some valuable distinctions\namong speech acts. Just to use our earlier case again: an assertion\nand a conjecture that P have identical conditions of\nsatisfaction, namely that P be the case. May we discern\nfeatures distinguishing these two speech acts, in a way enabling us to\nmake finer-grained distinctions among other speech acts as well? I\nshall return to this question in Sections 6–7. \n\nIn an attempt to systematize and deepen Austin’s approach, Searle and\nVanderveken 1985 distinguish between those illocutionary forces\nemployed by speakers within a given linguistic community, and the set\nof all possible illocutionary forces. While a certain linguistic\ncommunity may make no use of forces such as conjecturing or\nappointing, these two are among the set of all possible forces. (These\nauthors appear to assume that while the set of possible forces may be\ninfinite, it has a definite cardinality.) Searle and Vanderveken go on\nto define illocutionary force in terms of seven features, namely: \n\nSearle and Vanderveken (1985) suggest, in light of these seven\ncharacteristics, that each illocutionary force may be defined as a\nseptuple of values, each of which is a “setting” of a\nvalue within one of the seven characteristics. It follows, according\nto this suggestion, that two illocutionary forces\nF1 and F2 are identical just\nin case they correspond to the same septuple. \n\nI cannot slow the expansion of the universe or convince you of the\ntruth of a claim by saying that I am doing so. However, these two\ncases differ in that the latter, but not the former, is a\ncharacteristic aim of a speech act. One characteristic aim of\nassertion is the production of belief in an addressee, whereas there\nis no speech act one of whose characteristic aims is the slowing of\nthe universe’s expansion. A type of speech act can have a\ncharacteristic aim without each speech act of that type being issued\nwith that aim: Speakers sometimes make assertions without aiming to\nproduce belief in anyone, even themselves. Instead, the view that a\nspeech act-type has a characteristic aim is akin to the view that a\nbiological trait has a function. The characteristic role of wings is\nto aid in flight even though some flightless creatures are winged. \n\nAustin called these characteristic aims of speech\nacts perlocutions (1962, p. 101). I can both urge and\npersuade you to shut the door, yet the former is an illocution while\nthe latter is a perlocution. How can we tell the difference? We can do\nso by noting that under the right conditions, one can urge just by\nsaying and speaker meaning, “I hereby urge you to shut the door,” while there\nare no circumstances in which I can persuade you just by saying,\n“I hereby persuade you to shut the door.” A characteristic\naim of urging is, nevertheless, the production of a resolution to act\n(1962, p. 107). Cohen (1973) develops the idea of perlocutions as\ncharacteristic aims of speech acts. \n\nPerlocutions are characteristic aims of one or more illocution, but\nare not themselves illocutions. Nevertheless, one speech act can be\nperformed by means of the performance of another. For instance, my\nremark that you are standing on my foot is normally taken as, in\naddition, a demand that you move; my question whether you can pass the\nsalt is normally taken as a request that you do so. These are examples\nof so-called indirect speech acts (Searle 1979). Phrases that\nare commonly used in service of indirect speech acts are, ‘Would\nyou mind terribly if I…,’ ‘Might I\nsuggest…,’ and ‘It seems to me that…’,\nor simply ‘please’, as in ‘Can you pass the salt,\nplease?’ Observe that this last sentence, with its appended\ntag-question, cannot be interpreted as a request for information\n(about the addressee’s salt-passing abilities), but can only be\nunderstood as a request. Asher and Lascarides (2001) provide a formal\nmodel of indirect speech acts on which some are conventionalized while\nothers require Gricean reasoning for their interpretation.\n\n \n\nWhile indirect communication is ubiquitous, indirect speech acts are\nless common than might first appear. In asking whether you intend to\nquit smoking, I might be taken as well to be suggesting that you\nquit. However, while the embattled smoker might jump to this\ninterpretation, we do well to consider what evidence would mandate\nit. After all, while I probably would not have asked whether you\nintended to quit smoking unless I hoped you would quit, I can evince\nsuch a hope without performing the speech act of suggesting. Evincing\na psychological state, even if done intentionally, arguably does not\nconstitute a speech act. Instead, intentionally evincing a\npsychological state may be understood as simply expressing that\nstate (See Green 2020, ch. 2).  \n\nWhether, in addition to a given speech act, I am also performing an\nindirect speech act would seem to depend on my intentions. My question\nwhether you can pass the salt is also a request that you do so only if\nI intend to be so understood. What is more, this intention must be\nfeasibly discernible on the part of one’s audience. Even if, in\nremarking on the fine weather, I intend as well to request that you\npass the salt, I will not have issued a request unless I have made\nthat intention manifest in some way. \n\nHow might I do this? One way is by making an inference to the best\nexplanation. Perhaps the best explanation of my asking whether you can\npass the salt is that I mean to be requesting that you do so, and\nperhaps the best explanation of my remarking that you are standing on\nmy foot, particularly if I use a stentorian tone of voice, is that I\nmean to be demanding that you desist. By contrast, it is doubtful that\nthe best explanation of my asking whether you intend to quit smoking\nis that I intend to suggest that you do so. Another explanation at\nleast as plausible is my hope, or expression of hope, that you do\nso. Bertolet 1994 develops a more skeptical position than that\nsuggested here, arguing that any alleged case of an indirect speech\nact can be construed just as an indication, by means of contextual\nclues, of the speaker’s intentional state—hope, desire, etc., as\nthe case may be. Postulation of a further speech act beyond what has\nbeen (relatively) explicitly performed is, he contends, explanatorily\nunmotivated. McGowan et al. (2009) reply by offering three\nconditions they take to be sufficient for a case of what they term\nlinguistic communication. They would also argue that in, for instance,\nthe smoking case, the speaker meets those three conditions, and thus\ncounts as suggesting that the addressee quit smoking. Bertolet (2017)\nreplies that these three conditions are not sufficient for an instance\nof speaker meaning, and given that (as we have seen) speaker meaning\nis a necessary condition for (non-conventional) speech acts, concludes\nthat McGowan et al. have not established that the cases that\nconcern them are indirect speech acts. \n\nThese considerations suggest that indirect speech acts, if they do\noccur at all, can be explained within the framework of conversational\nimplicature–that process by which we mean more (and on some\noccasions less) than we say, but in a way not due exclusively to the\nconventional meanings of our words. Conversational implicature, too,\ndepends both upon communicative intentions and the availability of\ninference to the best explanation (Grice, 1989). In fact,\nSearle’s 1979 influential account of indirect speech acts is\ncouched in terms of conversational implicature (although he does not\nuse this phrase). The study of speech acts is in this respect\nintertwined with the study of conversations; we return to this theme\nin Section \n6.[10] \n\nNot only does content underdetermine force; content together with\ngrammatical mood does so as well. ‘You’ll be more punctual in\nthe future’ is in the indicative grammatical mood, but as we\nhave seen, that fact does not determine its force. The same may be\nsaid of other grammatical moods. Although I overhear you utter the\nwords, ‘shut the door’, I cannot infer yet that you are\nissuing a command. Perhaps instead you are simply describing your own\nintention, in the course of saying, “I intend to shut the\ndoor.” If so, you’ve used the imperative mood without issuing a\ncommand. So too with the interrogative mood: I overhear your words,\n‘who is on the phone.’ Thus far I don’t know whether\nyou’ve asked a question, since you may have so spoken in the course of\nstating, “John wonders who is on the phone.” Might either\nor both of initial capitalization or final punctuation settle the\nissue? Apparently not: What puzzles Meredith is the following\nquestion: Who is on the phone?\n \nMood together with content underdetermine force. On the other hand it\nis a plausible hypothesis that grammatical mood is one of the devices\nwe use (together with contextual clues, intonation, and the like) to\nindicate the force with which we are expressing a content. Understood\nin this weak way, it is unexceptionable to construe the interrogative\nmood as used for asking questions, the imperatival mood as used for\nissuing commands, and so on. So understood, we might go on to ask how\nspeakers indicate the force of their speech acts given that\ngrammatical mood and content cannot be relied on alone to do so. \n\nOne well known answer we may term force\nconventionalism. According to a strong version of this view, for\nevery speech act that is performed, there is some convention that will\nhave been invoked in order to make that speech act occur. This\nconvention transcends those imbuing words with their literal\nmeaning. Thus, force conventionalism implies that in order for use of\n‘I promise to meet you tomorrow at noon,’ to constitute a\npromise, not only must the words used possess their standard\nconventional meanings, there must also exist a convention to the\neffect that the use, under the right conditions, of some such words as\nthese constitutes a promise. Austin seems to have held this\nview. For instance in his characterization of “felicity\nconditions” for speech acts, Austin holds that for each speech\nact Austin’s student Searle follows him in this, writing Searle goes on to clarify this commitment in averring, Searle espouses a weaker form of force conventionalism than does\nAustin in leaving open the possibility that some speech acts can be\nperformed without constitutive rules; Searle considers the case of a\ndog requesting to be let outside (1969, p. 39). Nevertheless Searle\ndoes contend that speech acts are characteristically performed by\ninvoking constitutive rules. \n\nMillikan (1998) espouses a parsimonious conception of conventions that\nshe terms ‘natural conventions,’ and on the assumption\nthat natural conventions are a type of convention, one would expect\nthis strategy to make it easier to defend the view that speech acts\nare inherently conventional. For Millikan, a natural\nconvention is constituted by patterns that are reproduced by\nvirtue of the weight of \nprecedent.[11] \nA pattern is reproduced just in\ncase it has a form that derives from a previous entity having, in\ncertain respects, the same form, and in such a way that had the\nprevious form been different in those respects, the current form would\nbe different in those respects as well (1998, p.  163). Photocopying\nis one form of reproduction meeting these criteria; the retinotopic\nmapping from patterns of stimulation on the retina to patterns of\nstimulation in the visual cortex is evidently another. Millikan would\nnot treat retinotopic mapping as a type of convention, however, since\nit would not seem to be perpetuated by virtue of the weight of\nprecedent. The point is difficult to discern, however, since in her\ndiscussion of the matter Millikan discusses the conditions under which\na pattern is taken to be conventional, rather than for it to\nbe conventional, writing Millikan thus seems to characterize what it is for a pattern to\nhave weight of precedent in terms of that pattern’s being perceived to\nhave such weight. This notion is not itself elucidated, and as a\nresult the notion of weight of precedent is left obscure in her\naccount. Nonetheless, she tells us that just as the conventions of\nchess dictate that when one’s king is in check, one does what one can\nto get him out of check; so too the conventions of language dictate\nthat when A tells B that p, B responds by\nbelieving that p. Millikan describes the hearer’s response as a\nhidden, inner act that is not under B’s voluntary control. Millikan\nalso describes this response as being learned in the way that we learn\nwhat she calls “natural sign patterns,” such as our\nlearning that the sound of crashing waves is an indication of a nearby\ncoastline. \n\nOn Millikan’s view, then, A’s assertion of p being\nfollowed by B’s belief that p is a process that is not\nintrinsically superior to others that might have been followed. This\nmay be doubted, however. What, after, all would be viable alternative\nresponses? Disbelieving p? Remaining neutral on the question\nof p? Scratching one’s left earlobe? Any of these responses\nwould tend to undermine the use of language as a means for transmission of\ninformation. What is more, if belief formation is not under the\nvoluntary control of addressees, it is obscure how this aspect of\ncommunication could be conventional, any more than the pattern of\nstimulation of our visual cortex is conventional when that pattern\nresults from an isomorphic pattern on the retina. \n\nForce-conventionalism as espoused by Austin and later Searle has been\nchallenged by Strawson, who writes, Strawson contends that rather than appealing to a series of\nextra-semantic conventions to account for the possibility of speech\nacts, we explain that possibility in terms of our ability to discern\none another’s communicative intentions. What makes an utterance\nof a sentence in the indicative mood a prediction rather than a\ncommand, for instance, is that it manifests an intention to be so\ntaken; likewise for promises rather than predictions. This position is\ncompatible with holding that in special cases linguistic communities\nhave instituted conventions for particular speech acts such as\nappointing and excommunicating. So too, as Skinner (1970) observes,\nunderstanding the utterances of an historical figure crucially depends\non sensitivity to conventions of the society in which they are\nmade. \n\nIntending to make an assertion, promise, or request, however, is not\nenough to perform one of these acts. Those intentions must be\nefficacious. The same point applies to cases of trying to perform a\nspeech act, even when what one is trying to do is clear to\nothers. This fact emerges from reflecting on an oft-quoted passage\nfrom Searle: As Green 2013 observes, the point may be doubted. Suppose I am\ntrying to work up the courage to ask Sidney’s hand in\nmarriage. Sidney recognizes this fact on the basis of background\nknowledge, my visible embarrassment, and my fumbling in my pocket for\nan engagement ring. Here we cannot infer that I have succeeded in\nasking Sidney anything. Nothing short of coming out and saying it will\ndo. Similarly, it might be common knowledge that my moribund uncle is\ntrying, as he breathes his last, to bequeath me his fortune; still, I\nwon’t inherit a penny if he expires before saying what he was trying\nto.[12] Closer\nto Searle’s example, even if you were to find, on the basis of\nfMRI analysis of my neural activity, that I was trying to tell you\nthat it’s going to rain tomorrow, I still have not asserted\nanything about tomorrow’s weather. (If I were completely\nparalyzed as a result of Locked-In Syndrome, then making such a neural\neffort might be the most I can hope to do; in that case, your fMRI\ninformation might be enough to justify you in taking me to have\nperformed a speech act.) \n\nThe gist of these examples is not the requirement that words be\nuttered in every speech act—we have already observed that speech\nacts can be performed silently. Rather, their gist is that speech acts\ninvolve intentional undertaking of a publicly accessible commitment;\nfurther, that commitment is not undertaken simply by virtue of my\nintending to undertake it, even when it is common knowledge that this\nis what I am trying to do. Can we, however, give a more illuminating\ncharacterization of the relevant intentions than merely saying that,\nfor instance, to assert P one must intentionally put\nforth P as an assertion? Strawson (1964) proposes that we can\ndo so with aid of the notion of speaker meaning—to which we now\nturn. \n\nAs we have seen, that A is an important component of\ncommunication, and that A underdetermines B, do not\njustify the conclusion that B is an important component of\ncommunication. One reason for an asymmetry in our treatment of force\nand decibel level is that the former, but not the latter, seems\ncrucial to how I mean what I say. I intend to speak at a certain\nvolume, and sometimes succeed, but in most cases it is no part of how\nI mean what I say that I happen to be speaking at that volume. On the\nother hand, the force of my utterance is an aspect of what I mean. It\nis not, as we have seen, any aspect of what I say—that notion\nbeing closely associated with content. However, whether I mean what I\nsay as an assertion, a conjecture, a promise or something else will be\ncrucial to how I mean what I do. \n\nIn his influential 1957 article, Grice\ndistinguished between two uses of ‘mean’. One use is\nexemplified by remarks such as ‘Those clouds mean rain,’\nand ‘Those spots mean measles.’ The notion of meaning in\nplay in such cases Grice dubs ‘natural meaning’. Grice\nsuggests that we may distinguish this use of ‘mean’ from\nanother use of the word more relevant to communication, exemplified\nin such utterances as and Grice used the term ‘non-natural meaning’ for this\nuse of ‘mean’, and in more recent literature this jargon\nhas been replaced with the term ‘speaker\nmeaning’.[13]\n After distinguishing between natural and\n(what we shall hereafter call) speaker meaning, Grice attempts to\ncharacterize the latter. It is not enough that I do something that\ninfluences the beliefs of an observer: In putting on a coat I might\nlead an observer to conclude that I am going for a walk. Yet in such a\ncase it is not plausible that I mean that I am going for a walk in the\nsense germane to speaker meaning. Might performing an action with an\nintention of influencing someone’s beliefs be sufficient for speaker\nmeaning? No: I might secretly leave Smith’s handkerchief at the crime scene to\nmake the police think that Smith is the culprit. However, whether or\nnot I am successful in getting the authorities to think that Smith is\nthe culprit, in this case it is not plausible that I mean that Smith\nis the culprit. \n\nWhat is missing in the handkerchief example is the element of\novertness. This suggests another criterion: Performing an action with\nthe, or an, intention of influencing someone’s beliefs, while\nintending that this very intention be recognized. Grice contends that\neven here we do not have enough for speaker meaning. Herod presents\nSalome with St. John’s severed head on a charger, intending that she\ndiscern that St. John is dead and intending that this very intention\nof his be recognized. Grice observes that in so doing Herod is\nnot telling Salome anything, but is instead deliberately and\nopenly letting her know something. Grice concludes that Herod’s action\nis not a case of speaker meaning either. The problem is not that Herod\nis not using words; we have already considered communicators who mean things\nwordlessly. The problem seems to be that to infer what Herod intends\nher to, Salome does not have to take his word for anything. She can\nsee the severed head for herself if she can bring herself to look. By\ncontrast, in its central uses, telling requires a speaker to intend to\nconvey information (or alleged information) in a way that relies\ncrucially upon taking her at her word. Grice appears to assume that at\nleast for the case in which what is meant is a proposition (rather\nthan a question or an imperative), speaker meaning requires a telling\nin this central sense. What is more, this last example is a case of\nperforming an action with an intention of influencing someone’s\nbeliefs, even while intending that this very intention be recognized;\nyet it is not a case of telling. Grice infers that it is not a case of\nspeaker meaning either. \n\nGrice holds that for speaker meaning to occur, not only must one (a)\nintend to produce an effect on an audience, and (b) intend that this\nvery intention be recognized by that audience, but also (c) intend this effect on the audience to be produced at least in\npart by their recognition of the speaker’s intention. The intention to\nproduce a belief or other attitude by means (at least in part) of\nrecognition of this very intention, has come to be called\na reflexive communicative intention. \n\nIt may be doubted that speaker meaning requires reflexive communicative intentions. After all, a mathematics teacher who proves a theorem T for her class likely wants her pupils to believe T on the strength of her proof rather than their recognition of her intention that they come to believe T. (Vlach 1981) It may even be doubted that speaker meaning requires intentions to produce cognitive effects on addressees at all: Davis (1992) provides a range of cases such as speaking to pre-linguistic infants, uncooperative photocopy machines, and photos of deceased loved ones.[14],[15] Instead of intentions to produce psychological effects in an addressee, some authors have advocated a construal of speaker meaning as overtly manifesting an aspect of one’s commitments or state of mind (Green 2019). Compare my going to the closet to take out my overcoat (not a\ncase of speaker meaning), with the following case: After heatedly\narguing about the weather, I march to the closet while beadily meeting\nyour stare, then storm out the front door while ostentatiously donning\nthe coat. Here it is more plausible that I mean that it is raining\noutside, and the reason seems to be that I am making some attitude of\nmine overt: I am not only showing it, I am making clear my intention\nto do just that.\n \n\nHow does this detour through speaker meaning help to elucidate the\nnotion of force? One way of asserting that P, it seems, is\novertly to manifest my commitment to P, and indeed commitment\nof a particular kind: commitment to defend P in response to\nchallenges of the form, “How do you know that?” I must\nalso overtly manifest my liability to be either right or wrong on the\nissue of P depending on whether P is the case. By\ncontrast, I conjecture P by overtly manifesting my commitment\nto P in this same “liability to error” way, but I\nam not committed to responding to challenges demanding full\njustification. I must, however, give some reason for\nbelieving P; this much cannot, however, be said of a\nguess. \n\nWe perform a speech act, then, when we overtly commit ourselves in a\ncertain way to a content—where that way is an aspect of how we\nspeaker-mean that content. One way to do that is to invoke a\nconvention for undertaking commitment; another way is overtly to\nmanifest one’s intention to be so committed. We may elucidate the\nrelevant forms of commitment by spelling out the norms underlying\nthem. We have already adumbrated such an approach in our discussion of\nthe differences among asserting and conjecturing. Developing that\ndiscussion a bit further, compare\n \n\nAll three of these acts have word-to-world direction of fit, and all\nthree have conditions of satisfaction mandating that they are\nsatisfied just in case the world is as their content says it\nis. Further, one who asserts, conjectures, or guesses that P\nis right or wrong on the issue of P depending on\nwhether P is in fact so. However, as we move down the list we\nfind a decreasing order of stringency in commitment. One who\nasserts P lays herself open to the challenge, “How do\nyou know that?”, and she is obliged to retract P if she\nis unable to respond to that challenge adequately. By contrast, this\nchallenge is inappropriate for either a conjecture or a guess. On the\nother hand, we may justifiably demand of the conjecturer that she give\nsome reason for her conjecture; yet not even this much may be said of\none who makes a guess. (The “educated guess” is\nintermediate between these two cases.) \n\nThis illocutionary dimension of speaker meaning\ncharacterizes not what is meant, but rather how it is meant. Just as\nwe may consider your remark, directed toward me, “You’re\ntired,” and my remark, “I’m tired,” as having said\nthe same thing but in different ways; so too we may consider my\nassertion of P, followed by a retraction and then followed by\na conjecture of P, as two consecutive cases in which I\nspeaker-mean that P but do so in different ways. This idea\nwill be developed further in Section 8 under the rubric of\n“mode” of illocutionary\ncommitment.[16] \n\nSpeaker meaning, then, encompasses not just content but also force,\nand we may elucidate this in light of the normative structure\ncharacteristic of each speech act: When you overtly display a\ncommitment characteristic of that speech act, you have performed that\nspeech act. Is this a necessary condition as well? That depends on\nwhether I can perform a speech act without intending to do so—a\ntopic for Section 9 below. For now, however, compare the view at which\nwe have arrived with Searle’s view that one performs a speech act when\nothers become aware of one’s intention to perform that act. What is\nmissing from Searle’s characterization is the notion of overtness: The\nagent in question must not only make her intention to undertake a\ncertain commitment manifest; she must also intend that that very\nintention be manifest. There is more to overtness than wearing one’s\nheart (or mind) on one’s sleeve. \nIn elucidating this normative dimension of force, we have sought to\ncharacterize speech acts in terms of their conversational roles. That\nis not to say that speech acts can only be performed in the setting of\na conversation: I can approach you, point out that your vehicle is\nblocking mine, and storm off. Here I have made an assertion but have\nnot engaged in a conversation. Perhaps I can ask myself a question in\nthe privacy of my study and leave it at that–not continuing into\na conversation with myself. However, a speech act’s “ecological\nniche” may nevertheless be the conversation. In that spirit,\nwhile we may be able to remove a speech act type from its environment\nand scrutinize it in isolated captivity, doing so may blind us to some\nof its distinctive features. \nThis ecological analogy sheds light on a dispute over the question\nwhether speech acts can profitably be studied in isolation from the\nconversations in which they occur. An empiricist framework,\nexemplified in John Stuart Mill’s A System\nof Logic, suggests attempting to discern the meaning of a word,\nfor instance a proper name, in isolation. By\ncontrast, Gottlob Frege (1884) enjoins us to\nunderstand a word’s meaning in terms of the contribution it makes to\nan entire sentence. Such a method is indispensable for a proper\ntreatment of such expressions as quantifiers, and represents a major\nadvance over empiricist approaches. Yet students of speech acts have\nespoused going even further, insisting that the unit of significance\nis not the proposition but the speech act. Vanderveken writes, Why not go even further, since speech acts characteristically occur\nin conversations? Is the unit of significance really the debate, the\ncolloquy, the interrogation? \nStudents of conversation analysis have contended precisely\nthis, remarking that many speech acts fall naturally into\npairs.[17] For\ninstance, questions pair naturally with assertions when the latter\npurport to be answers to those questions. Likewise, offers pair\nnaturally with acceptances or rejections, and it is easy to multiply\nexamples. Searle, who favors studying speech acts in isolation, has\nreplied to these considerations (Searle 1992).  There he issues a\nchallenge to students of conversation to provide an account of\nconversations parallel to that of speech acts, arguing as well that\nthe prospects for such an account are dim. One of his reasons is that\nunlike speech acts conversations do not as such have a point or\npurpose. Green 1999 rejoins that many conversations may indeed be\nconstrued in teleological terms. For instance, many conversations may\nbe construed as aimed at answering a question, even when that question\nconcerns something as banal as the afternoon’s weather or the\nlocation of the nearest subway station. Asher and Lascardes (2003)\ndevelop a systematic treatment of speech acts in their conversational\nsetting that also responds to Searle’s challenge. Additionally,\nRoberts (2004, 2012) develops a model of conversational kinematics\naccording to which conversations are invariably aimed at answering\nwhat she terms a question under discussion (QUD). This view\nis best appreciated within the framework of the “scorekeeping\nmodel” of conversation, to which we now turn. \nMuch literature concerned with speech acts is curiously disconnected\nfrom research in the semantics of natural language emphasizing\npragmatic factors. For instance, Stalnaker (1972, 1973, 1974), Lewis\n(1979, 1980), Thomason (1990) and others have developed models of the\nkinematics of conversations aimed at understanding the role of\nquantification, presupposition (both semantic and pragmatic),\nanaphora, deixis, and vagueness in discourse. Such models typically\nconstrue conversations as involving an ever-developing set of\nPropositions that can be presupposed by interlocutors. This set of\nPropositions is the conversational common ground, defined as\nthat set of Propositions that all interlocutors take to be true, while\nalso taking it that all other interlocutors take them to be true. If a\nProposition p is in a conversation’s common ground, then a speaker may\nfelicitously presuppose p’s truth. Suppose then that the\nProposition that Singapore has a unique King is in a\nconversation’s common ground at given point; then a speaker may\nfelicitously utter a sentence such as ‘The present King of\nSingapore is wise,’ or ‘Singapore’s king is\nsleeping’. Other parameters characterizing a conversation at a\ngiven point include the domain of discourse, a set of salient\nperceptible objects, standards of precision, time, world or situation,\nspeaker, and addressee. The set of all values for these items at a\ngiven conversational moment is often referred to as\n“conversational score”. \n“Scorekeeping” approaches to language use typically\nconstrue a contribution to a conversation as a Proposition: If that\n“assertion” is accepted, then the score is updated by\nhaving the Proposition entered into common ground. In this spirit,\nMacFarlane (2011) considers an account of the speech act of assertion\nin terms an utterance’s capacity to update conversational score. Such\nan approach will, however, face a difficulty in explaining how two\nspeech acts with the same content, such as an assertion that the Milky\nWay contains a black hole, and a conjecture that it does, will make\ndifferent conversational contributions. An enrichment of the\nscorekeeping model would include sensitivity to differences such as\nthese. \nAnother development in the scorekeeping model refines the teleological\npicture adumbrated above to incorporate Questions, construed (along\nthe lines of Section 2.1) as sets of Propositions. When an\ninterlocutor proffers an assertion that is not met with objections by\nothers in the conversation, the Propositional content of that\nillocution will enter into common ground. When an interlocutor poses a\nquestion that is accepted by others, we may represent the change as an\naddition to Common Ground of the set of propositions that is the\nInterrogative content of that illocution. The presence of that\nInterrogative obliges interlocutors to work to rule all but one\nProposition that is a complete answer to the Interrogative. Because\nInterrogatives stand in inferential relations to one another (Q1\nentails Q2 just in case any answer to Q1 is an answer to Q2), one\nstrategy for answering a question is to divide it into tractable\nquestions that it entails: ‘How many covered bridges are there\nin Japan?’ can be answered by answering that question for each\nof that country’s 47 prefectures. Roberts (2004, 2012) develops\nthe Question Under Discussion model of conversational dynamics\naccording to which common ground contains a partially ordered set of\nInterrogatives in addition to a set of Propositions. This teleological\napproach to conversation bids fair to enrich our understanding of the\nrelations of speech acts to other central topics within pragmatics\nsuch as presupposition and \nimplicature.[18] \nFrege’s Begriffsschrift (1879) constitutes history’s first\nthoroughgoing attempt to formulate a rigorous formal system in which\nto carry out deductive reasoning. However, Frege did not see his\nBegriffschrift as merely a tool for assessing the validity of\narguments. Rather, he appears to have seen it as an organon for the\nacquisition of knowledge from unquestionable first principles; in\naddition he wanted to use it in order to help make clear the epistemic\nfoundations on which our knowledge rests.  To this end his formal\nsystem contains not only symbols indicating the content of\npropositions (including logical constants), but also symbols\nindicating the force with which they are put forth. In particular,\nFrege insists that when using his formal system to acquire new\nknowledge from propositions already known, we use an assertion sign to\nindicate our acknowledgment of the truth of the proposition used as\naxioms or inferred therefrom. Frege thus employs what would now be\ncalled a force indicator: an expression whose use indicates\nthe force with which an associated proposition is being put forth\n(Green 2002). \nReichenbach expands upon Frege’s idea in his 1947. In addition to\nusing an assertion sign, Reichenbach also uses indicators of\ninterrogative and imperatival force. Hare similarly introduces force\nindicators to lay bare the way in which ethical and cognate utterances\nare made (Hare 1970). Davidson (1979), however, challenges the value\nof this entire enterprise of introducing force-indicating devices into\nlanguages, formal or otherwise. Davidson’s reason is that since\nnatural language already contains many devices for indicating the\nforce of one’s speech act, the only interest a force indicator could\nhave would be if it could guarantee the force of one’s speech act. But\nnothing could do this: Any device purporting to be, say, an infallible\nindicator of assertoric force is liable to being used by a joker or\nactor to heighten the realism of their performance. Referring to the\nputative force-indicating device as a ‘strengthened mood,’\nhe writes,  Hare 1989 replies that there could be a society with a convention that utterance\nof a certain expression constituted performance of a certain\nillocutionary act, even those utterances that occur on stage or as\nused by jokers or storytellers. Green 1997 questions the relevance of this observation to asserting, which as we have seen, which as we have\nseen, seem to require intentions for their performance. Just as no\nconvention could make it the case that I believe that P, so\ntoo no convention could make it the case that I intend to put forth a\ncertain sentence as an assertion. \nOn the other hand, Green 1997 and Green 2000 also observe that even if\nthere can be no force indicator in the sense Davidson criticizes,\nnothing prevents natural language from containing devices that\nindicate force conditional upon one’s performing a speech act: such a\nforce indicator would not show whether one is performing a\nspeech act, but, given that one is doing so, it would\nshow which speech act one is performing. For instance,\nparenthetical expressions such as, ‘as is the case’ can\noccur in the antecedent of conditionals, as in: ‘If, as is the\ncase, the globe is warming, then Antarctica will melt.’ Use of\nthe parenthetical cannot guarantee that the sentence or any part of it\nis being asserted, but if the entire sentence is being asserted, then,\nGreen claims, use of the parenthetical guarantees that the speaker is\nalso committed to the content of the antecedent. If this claim is\ncorrect, natural language already contains force indicators in this\nqualified sense. Whether it is worth introducing such force indicators\ninto a logical notation remains an open question. Subsequent to Austin’s introduction of the notion of a\nperformative, it has also been suggested that what we might call\nperformative sentential frames behave like force indicators: ‘I\nclaim that it is sunny,’ seems to be a prolix way of saying that\nit is sunny, where the ‘I claim’ seems only to indicate\nhow what follows is to be taken. On the approach of Urmson (1952), for\ninstance, such a sentence should be understood on the model of\n‘It is sunny, I claim.’ Support for such an analysis may\nbe found in the fact that a potential reply to that\nutterance is ‘No it isn’t; it’s pouring\noutside!’, while ‘No you don’t’ is not. Again, if the speaker does not believe it is sunny outside, she cannot dodge, she cannot dodge\nthe accusation of lying by remarking that what she had asserted was\nthat she claimed that it is sunny, and not anything about the\nweather. \n\nNonetheless, drawing on Cohen 1964, Lycan 2018 objects to the view\nthat such performative frames make no contribution to sentence or\nutterance meaning. If Marissa felicitously utters, ‘I claim that\nit is sunny,’ while Abdul felicitously utters, ‘I\nconjecture that it is sunny,’ the view implies that their\nutterances mean the same. The two speakers have clearly said different\nthings, however. On the other hand, if we hold that the performative\nframe does contribute to the content of what Marissa and Abdul said,\nthen, Lycan points out, it will be difficult to explain how their\nutterances commit either of them to any position about the weather. It\nevidently won’t do to posit inference rules such as ‘I state\nthat p,‘ ergo, ‘p’. We will\nconsider a solution to what Lycan terms “Cohen’s Problem”\nafter developing a notion of illocutionary inference in the next\nsection. \nStudents of speech acts contend, as we have seen, that the unit of\ncommunicative significance is the Illocution rather than the\nProposition. This attitude prompts the question whether logic itself\nmight be enriched by incorporating inferential relations among speech\nacts rather than just inferential relations among Propositions.\nJust as two event-types E1 and E2 (such as running\nquickly and running) could be logically related to one another in that\nit is not possible for one to occur without the other; so too speech\nact types S1 and S2 could be\ninferentially related to one another if it is not possible to perform\none without performing the other. A warning that the bull is about to\ncharge is also an assertion that the bull is about to charge but the\nconverse is not true. This is in spite of the fact that these two\nspeech acts have the same propositional content: That the bull is\nabout to charge. If, therefore, warning implies asserting but not vice\nversa, then that inferential relation is not to be caught within the\nnet of inferential relations among propositions. \nIn their Foundations of Illocutionary Logic (1985), Searle\nand Vanderveken attempt a general treatment of logical relations among\nspeech acts.  They describe their central question in terms of\ncommitment: To explicate their notion of illocutionary commitment, these\nauthors invoke their definition of illocutionary force in terms of the\nseven values mentioned in Section 2.3 above. On the basis of this\ndefinition, they define two notions pertinent to entailment relations\namong speech acts, namely strong illocutionary commitment\nand weak illocutionary commitment. According to the former\ndefinition, an illocutionary act S1 commits a\nspeaker to another illocutionary act S2 iff it is\nnot possible to perform S1 without\nperforming S2. Whether that relation holds between\na pair of illocutionary acts depends on the particular septuples with\nwhich they are identified. Thus suppose that S1 is\nidentical with <IP1, Str1, Mode1,\nCont1, Prep 1, Sinc1,\nStresinc1> (corresponding to illocutionary point,\nstrength, mode of achievement, propositional content, preparatory\ncondition, sincerity condition, and strength of sincerity condition,\nrespectively); and suppose that S2 is identical\nwith <IP1, Str2, Mode1,\nCont1, Prep1, Sinc1,\nStresinc1>. Suppose further that Str1 and\nStr2 differ only in that 1 is stronger than 2. Then it will\nnot be possible to perform S1 without\nperforming S2; whence the former strongly\nillocutionarily implies the latter. (This definition of strong\nillocutionary commitment generalizes in a straightforward way to the\ncase in which a set of speech acts S1,\n…, Sn−1 implies a speech\nact Sn.) \nSearle and Vanderveken also define a notion of weak illocutionary\ncommitment such that S1 weakly illocutionarily\nimplies S2 iff every performance\nof S1 commits an agent to meeting the conditions\nlaid down in the septuple identical to S2 (1985,\np. 24). Searle and Vanderveken infer that this implies that\nif P logically entails Q, and an agent\nasserts P, then she is committed to believing\nthat Q. These authors stress, however, that this does not\nmean that the agent who asserts P is committed\nto cultivating the belief Q when P\nimplies Q. In lieu of that explication, however, it is\nunclear just what notion of commitment is at issue. It is unclear, for\ninstance, what it could mean to be committed to believing Q\n(rather than just being committed to Q) if this is not to be\nexplicated as being committed to cultivating the belief\nthat Q. \nOther approaches attempt to circumvent such problems by reductively\ndefining the notion of commitment in terms of obligations to action\nand liability to error and/or vindication. Performance of a speech act\nor set of speech acts can commit an agent to a distinct content, and\ndo so relative to some force. If P and Q jointly\nimply R, then my asserting both P and Q\ncommits me to R. That is not to say that I have also\nasserted R: if assertion were closed under deductive\nconsequence I would assert infinitely many things just by virtue of\nasserting one. By contrast, if I conjecture P and Q,\nthen I am once again committed to R but not in the way that I\nwould have been had I asserted P and Q. For\ninstance, in the assertion case, once my further commitment to R is\nmade clear, it is within the rights of my addressee to ask how I know\nthat R holds; this would not have been an acceptable reply to my\nmerely conjecturing P and Q. Developing this theme,\nlet S be an arbitrary speaker,\n<ΔlAl,\n…, ΔnAn,\nΔB> a sequence of force/content pairs; then: Because it concerns what force/content pairs commit an agent to\nwhat others, illocutionary validity is an essentially deontic notion:\nIt will be cashed out in terms either of obligation to use a content\nin a certain way conversationally, or liability to error or\nvindication depending upon how the world is. \nOur discussion of the possibility of an illocutionary logic answers\none question posed at the end of Section 6.3, namely whether it is\npossible to perform a speech act without intending to do so. This\nseems likely given Searle and Vanderveken’s definition of strong\nillocutionary commitment: We need only imagine an agent performing\nsome large number of speech acts, S1,\n…, Sn−1, which, unbeknownst to\nher, jointly guarantee that she fulfills the seven conditions defining\nanother speech act Sn. Even in such a case she\nperforms Sn only by virtue of intentionally\nperforming some other set of speech acts S1,\n…, Sn−1; it is difficult to see\nhow one can perform Sn while having no intention\nof performing a speech act at all. \nWe are also in a position to make headway on Cohen’s Problem as\nformulated by Lycan. As argued in Green 2000, in an assertion of\n‘I (hereby) assert that p’, a speaker commits\nherself to p even though her words do not logically entail that\nProposition; nor do they presuppose, or either conversationally or\nconventionally imply it. They do, however, illocutionarily entail it:\nanyone committed to ‘I assert that p’\nassertorically is thereby committed to p assertorically. By\ncontrast, one committed to ‘I assert that p’ as a\nsupposition for the sake of argument is not thereby committed\nto p. Accordingly, such a phrase as ‘I assert that’\nis semantically opaque (making a non-trivial contribution to the truth\nconditions of the sentences in which it occurs) but pragmatically\ntransparent in the sense that a speaker who undertakes assertoric\ncommitment to a sentence in which it has widest scope is also\nassertorically committed to its complement. Analogous remarks apply to\n‘I conjecture that’ and the like. \nIn a paradigmatic illocutionary event, a speaker has a choice of which\nif any speech act to perform and her addressee will do her charitable\nbest to discern that speaker’s intentions and, where necessary, which\nconventions she may be invoking. Pratt (1986) observes that this\nparadigm is not true to the facts of many areas of communicative\nlife, writing  Although Pratt intends this remark as a critique of speech act\ntheory, it also suggests a way in which this theory might shed light\non subtle forms of oppression. We saw in Section 2.2 that a putative\nbet can misfire if it is not accepted. In such a case the speaker\nattempts to bet but fails in that effort due to a lack of audience\nuptake. So too, a person may not be in the correct social position to, say, excommunicate or appoint, and her attempts to perform such illocutions will misfire. More momentously, a pattern of abuses\nof speech act institutions might deprive a person of an ability to\nperform speech acts: the inveterate promise-breaker will, in time, lead others\nin his community to be unwilling to accept any promises he tries to\nmake. He can perform countless locutionary acts but will be unable to\nperform the illocutionary act of promising, at least in this\ncommunity. \nA pattern of culpable behavior could make a speaker unable to perform one speech act type. Could a pattern of culpable\nbehavior–intentional or inadvertent—on the part of others\nin a speaker’s community achieve the same effect? This could happen if enough such speakers decide never\nto accept one person’s bets, warnings, or promises. Beyond such\nhypothetical cases, it has been argued that patterns of social\ninequality can prevent members of certain groups from performing the speech acts they would choose to. Building on and refining\nMcKinnon’s (1993) claim that pornography silences women, Langton\n(1993), and Hornsby and Langton (1998) argue that the industry and\nconsumption of pornography deprive women of the ability to perform the\nspeech act of refusing sexual advances. Refusing is a speech act, but\nif large enough numbers of men deny uptake (with such thoughts as,\n“By ‘no’ she really means ‘yes’,”\netc.) then, these authors argue, women’s attempts to refuse sexual\nadvances will be characteristically inert with respect to the speech\nact of refusal. Women will still be able to attempt to refuse sexual\nadvances, and can still try to prevent them by physical means, but a\ncrucial illocutionary form of protection will be closed to them. So\ntoo, apartheid, Jim Crow, and even patterns of discrimination of which\nthe perpetrators are not consciously aware, can deprive racial,\nreligious, and ethnic minority groups of the ability to perform\nspeech-act types requiring uptake. These phenomena are generally\nreferred to as illocutionary silencing. \nBird (2002) denies that the speech act of refusal requires\nuptake. Such an illocution is, he contends, like inviting and\nsurrendering, which can occur whether or not their intended audiences\ngrasp or accept the proffered illocutions. Similarly denying that the\n“silencing” argument should be cast in terms of speech\nacts, Maitra 2009 argues that the institution of pornography prevents\nspeaker-meant instances of refusal from being understood. One can\nspeaker-mean that she refuses, for instance, but patterns of cognitive\nand affective response will systematically prevent that refusal from\nbeing grasped. Broadening the scope of investigations of the\ninteraction of injustice and illocutionary phenomena, McGowan 2009\nargues that some speech acts can not only cause but also constitute\ninstances of oppression. Anderson, Haslanger and Langton (2012) provide overviews of research on racial, gender\nand related forms of oppression as they relate to speech acts.  \n\nAlthough not inherently culpable, the practice of dogwhistling has\nalso recently gained the interest of theorists of speech acts. As\nsuggested by the metaphor, an agent dogwhistles just in case one or\nmore dimensions of a speech act she performs is readily intelligible\nonly to a proper subset of her addressees. Saul 2018 notes that in\ncontemporary American politics, stating one’s opposition to the\nSupreme Court case of Dred Scott seems to be a way of signaling one’s\nanti-abortion sympathies. For those not in the know, however, a\nspeaker’s opposition to the Dred Scott appears to be an\nuncontroversial act of rejecting racism. The phenomenon of\ndogwhistling provides an apparent challenge to conceptions of speaker\nmeaning in terms of overtness, since the dogwhistler would seem to\nspeaker mean a content that is cryptic to all but her insider\naudience: is her utterance both overt and covert? Instead of adopting\nsuch a view, one who construes speech acts in terms of overtness could\nrefine the notion of manifestness occuring in her account. What is\nmanifest to one addressee may not be manifest to another, and a\nspeaker may exploit this fact. Accordingly, someone who avows, “I’m\nagainst Dred Scott,” may speaker-mean that she is both against Dred\nScott and pro-life to one part of her audience, but only that she is\nagainst Dred Scott to another part.","contact.mail":"mitchell.green@uconn.edu","contact.domain":"uconn.edu"}]
