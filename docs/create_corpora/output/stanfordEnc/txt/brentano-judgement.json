Brentano used that conception not only for distinguishing\nmental from physical phenomena, but also for developing a\nclassification of mental phenomena. If intentionality is a fundamental\nfeature of any mental act, Brentano argues, differences in the way\nmental phenomena are directed toward something constitute differences in\nkind between mental acts. Judgements are one of the three basic kinds\nof intentional phenomena with which Brentano deals at great length in\nhis Psychology. That is not to say, however, that\nBrentano’s theory of judgement is just concerned with\npsychological issues. Brentano also aims to show how an experience of\njudging, specifically the experience of judging correctly, can provide\nus with a basis for grasping concepts like existence, truth, and\nlogical inference. Brentano’s investigation of the mental act of\njudgement promises therefore to advance logic, epistemology, and\nultimately metaphysics.\n\n\nMuch of that work which Brentano started in his Psychology\nremained unfinished. It was left to his students to further flesh out\nhis view by drawing on lecture notes, letters, and unpublished\nmaterial from Brentano’s Nachlass. Whether all the\nclaims that have been ascribed to Brentano in this literature actually\nbelong to his theory remains a matter of debate in the\n literature.[1]\n From a contemporary perspective, an interesting question is which of\nthe following two claims find support in Brentano’s theory:\n\n(A)Some judgements have a propositional\ncontent, others not.\n\n(B)No judgement has a propositional\ncontent.\n\nMost scholars take claim (B) to be Brentano’s\n view.[2]\n They do this on the ground that Brentano often takes a dismissive\nattitude towards “half way” theories by his contemporaries\nthat have room for both propositional and non-propositional\njudgements. However, when we consider Brentano’s conception of\ndouble judgement in section 5 below, we will find that double\njudgements play the role that predicative judgements are supposed to\nplay in other theories. It is therefore also possible to interpret\nBrentano as being committed only to a version of claim (A), according\nto which the propositional content of a judgement supervenes on the\ncontent of several non-propositional acts that make up the\njudgement.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we start with an overview of Brentano’s theory\nof judgement, as far as it is contained in the first edition of the\nPsychology. It will be convenient to divide the material\ncovered by Brentano in chapter 7 of this work (and the final section\nof chapter 6) into four parts. The first part tries to establish the\nfundamental difference between judgements (Urteile) and\npresentations (Vorstellungen); the second part pertains to\nthe relation between judgement and truth; the third part deals with\nexistential judgements and their intentional objects; and the fourth\npart proposes a reduction of categorical and hypothetical judgements\nto the existential form. \nAs a philosopher of mind, Brentano takes it to be his task to develop\nspecific accounts of whatever phenomena one finds in inner experience.\nTo do so, one has to pay close attention to the different ways in\nwhich phenomena are directed toward something (see PES 197 [II 32; SVS 1,\n218]), and Kriegel 2017: 99ff). Applying this method to the case of\njudgement, Brentano arrives at the claim that judgements are clearly\ndistinguishable from presentations. The question that concerns him is\nhow precisely they differ. Brentano invokes three negative\nclaims to draw that distinction: \nWhen someone asks me “Is any tree red?” I will combine\nthese ideas in pondering the question, but how much I combine them, I\nmight still remain undecided whether they exist together or not. That\nsuffices to make claim (1) plausible. \n\n Claim (1)\n is compatible with the view that judging always means to hold true a\nproposition. For Brentano, that is not the right way to understand\nclaim (1) however. In order to rule out that interpretation, Brentano\ninvokes the following pair of claims: \nTogether, claims (2) and (3) imply that judgements can be made without\njudging a sentence or proposition to be true. That is what Brentano\ntries to establish. Let us see how he tries to achieve this goal. \nBrentano considers three possible ways of conceiving of the difference\nbetween presentations and judgements. There may be (i) an intrinsic\ndifference between them, (ii) they may differ in their objects, or\n(iii) in a perfection [Vollkommenheit] with which these\nobjects are thought (PES 204, [II 42f.; SVS 1, 226]). \nLet’s start with (i). What would it mean that the distinction\nbetween judgement and presentation is not intrinsic, i.e.,\nextrinsic? It would mean that the distinction between judgement and\npresentation consists in a relational property that one of these\nmental phenomena has while the other lacks it. In this sense the\ndistinction between a bachelor and a husband is extrinsic: bachelors\nlack the relational property of being married to someone; husbands\nhave it. Nothing else distinguishes bachelors and husbands from each\nother: there is no intrinsic property of husbands or bachelors that\ngrounds the relational difference. Is the distinction between\njudgement and presentation like the distinction between husbands and\nbachelors? According to Alexander Bain, it is. For Bain there are two\nkinds of ideas (presentations): those that dispose one to\nact—this is the extrinsic or relational property—and\nothers that don’t. The former are judgements and beliefs, the\nlatter are mere presentations (see Bain 1872: 372f). Mill (1878:\n403–4) criticized Bain’s proposal as incomplete. In\ngeneral, a dispositional property like disposing one to act on an\nobject is grounded in its categorical properties. Hence, the\nbelief-constituting disposition to act must be grounded in categorical\nproperties of ideas and these properties seem to be intrinsic. The\nrelational difference is not brute as in the husband/bachelor\ncase. \nBrentano finds Mill’s line of thought persuasive (see PES 202f.\n[II 40; SVS 1,\n 224]).[3]\n By Brentano’s lights, any explanation of the distinction\nbetween judgement and presentation in terms of a difference in\n“impact” on mental states or actions is\n unsatisfactory.[4]\n Like Mill, he goes for the first of the three options above: the\ndifference between presentations and judgement is an intrinsic\none. \nOn to (ii). Is the intrinsic difference between judgement and\npresentation one that concerns the objects presented? Is a judgement a\nmental phenomenon in which a connection between different features is\nthought, while a presentation does not apprehend a relation between\none or more features (cf. PES 205 [II 44; SVS 1, 227])? Again\nBrentano’s answer is NO. His argument is based on considerations\nabout existential judgements which we will discuss in detail below (in\npart III). In essence, the argument is that the existential judgement\nthat A is and a presentation of A have the same object:\nthey are both directed towards A and not a combination of\nA with something else. \nIs the intrinsic difference between judgement and presentation one\nthat concerns a perfection in which mental phenomena that have the\nsame object differ? Brentano identifies the perfection as\nstrength, intensity or vivacity of the\nmental phenomena concerned. Is, as Brentano says, “a judgement a\nstronger presentation and a presentation a weaker judgement”?\n(PES 204 [II 44; SVS 1, 226]; author translation) Brentano says NO. A\nstrong presentation is no judgement. This argument, while suggestive,\nis not persuasive because the notion of strength, vividness or\nintensity seems unclear. However, in the second edition Brentano adds\nan important consideration that improves the argument. If presentation\nand judgement were distinguished in strength, both would need to have\npositions on a scale of strength. However, Brentano now doubts that\nthere is one scale of intensity or strength on which presentations and\njudgements both lie. Different degrees of conviction that may\naccompany an act of judgement should not be confused with the degrees\nof intensity with which an object can be presented to the mind, e.g.,\nin sensation (PES 286f. [II 151ff.; SVS 1, 401). If there is not one\ndimension of strength in which both judgement and presentation can\ndiffer, strength cannot distinguish between them. \nBrentano concludes that the distinction between judgement and\npresentation is intrinsic and irreducible to other distinctions\nbetween these mental phenomena. Hillebrand (1891: 26–7) called\nBrentano’s view therefore an “idiogenetic” theory of\njudgement—it takes judgement to be a fundamental kind of mental\nphenomenon—while “allogenetic” theories take\njudgements to be composed out of other mental phenomena that belong to\nfundamental kinds. \nBut are things not much easier? Brentano himself says: \nBy “judgement” we mean, in accordance with common\nphilosophical usage, acceptance [annehmen](as true) or\nrejection [verwerfen] (as false). We have already noted,\nhowever, that such acceptance or rejection also occurs in cases in\nwhich many people would not use the term “judgement,” as,\nfor example, in the perception of mental acts and in remembering. (PES\n198 [II 34; SVS 1, 219]) \nBrentano acknowledges that “accepting as true” or\n“rejecting as false” is the natural way to describe an act\nof judgement (PES 201 [II 38; SVS 1, 223]). Meanwhile philosophers\nhave changed their habits. While it is still true, of course, that\njudgements can be true or false, most philosophers are swayed by\nFrege’s or Reinach’s argument that all judgements are\nacceptances as\n true.[5]\n When one rejects a proposition as false, e.g., that there is\nextraterrestrial life, this is still a positive judgement for them,\nbecause in making the judgement one takes it to be true that\nno life exists beyond earth. Brentano would contest this by saying\nthat their point only concerns the linguistic expression of our\njudgements, not the judgements themselves. We can find for each\njudgement a sentence that is true if and only if the judgement\nexpressed in it is correct, but that does not show that the judgement\nitself always has a positive quality. \nWhy does the characterization of judgement as either an accepting as\ntrue or a rejecting as false not suffice to distinguish judgement from\npresentation? After all, one can present something without accepting\nit as true. Because saying that in judgement we take something to be\ntrue is potentially misleading. The following passage shows what\nBrentano is aiming at: \nIf we say that every acknowledging judgement [anerkennendes\nUrteil] is an act of taking something to be true, and every\nrejecting judgement [verwerfendes Urteil] an act of taking\nsomething to be false, this does not mean that the former consists in\npredicating truth of what is taken to be true and the latter in\npredicating falsity of what is taken to be false. Our previous\ndiscussions have shown, rather, that what the expressions denote is a\nparticular kind of intentional reception of an object, a distinctive\nkind of mental reference to a content of consciousness. The only\ncorrect interpretation is that anyone who takes something to be true\nwill not only acknowledge the object, but, when asked whether the\nobject is to be acknowledged, will also acknowledge the object’s\nto-be-acknowledgedness [das Anzuerkennensein], i.e., its\ntruth (which is all that is meant by this barbarous expression).\n(PES 240 [II 89; SVS 1, 259]; emphasis added and translation\nimproved). \nThe point that Brentano wants to get across is a delicate one and\nrequires a careful wording. It is no coincidence that Brentano prefers\nhere the term “anerkennen” over\n“annehmen”, which would be closer to common usage\nin philosophy. The reason is that Brentano thinks that the more common\nway of speaking wrongly suggests that one predicates truth when one\naccepts something as true. According to Brentano, as will become clear\nlater, judgement requires no predication (not even a predication of\nexistence). Hence, the difference in meaning between “accepting\n(annehmen)” and “acknowledging\n(anerkennen)” becomes important for\n him.[6] \nBrentano’s observation leads to an important result: To say that\nsomething is true does not mean that there is an object, a\nproposition, of which one predicates a property, being true. Rather,\nwe can take the act of judgement itself as the vehicle which is true.\nTo say that a judgement is true means to make a judgement of\nhigher-order, namely to acknowledge that the object of the first\njudgement is worthy of either being acknowledged or rejected.\nPropositions are not needed for making sense of the concept of\ntruth. \nExistential judgements play a fundamental role in Brentano’s\narguments against other views of judgement as well as in his positive\naccount of judgement. Brentano’s discussion of existential\njudgements aims to show that such judgements cannot be conceived as\npredications of properties (see\n section 1.1)\n and that such judgements are either acknowledgements or rejections of\nobjects. \nThe argument focuses on existential propositions and tries to\nestablish that a mental act of denial is on a par with an act of\nacceptance. Note, that by an existential proposition we do not mean\nhere the content of a judgement, but sentences of\nthe following form: \nA exists, an A exists, As exist. \nA does not exist, an A does not exist, As do not\nexist. \nThe argument developed by Brentano relies on the following\nprinciple: \n[W]henever someone acknowledges [anerkennen] a combination of\nattributes he simultaneously acknowledges each particular element of\nthe combination. (PES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 231]; authors\ntranslation) \nApplying the principle to the case of judgement, Brentano says: \nIf this judgement were the acknowledgement of the combination of an\nattribute “existence” with A, then it would include\nthe acknowledgement of each individual element in the combination, and\nhence would include the acknowledgement of A. (ibid.) \nAcknowledging A already does all the work that judging that\nA exists is supposed to do: to commit one to the existence of\nA. Since one cannot judge that A exists without\nacknowledging A, judging that A exists is necessarily\n redundant.[7]\n Thus, we get as an intermediary conclusion of the argument the\nfollowing claim: \nWhat Brentano wants to show is this: \nThe order in which we list the two claims might suggest that (5)\nsomehow follows from (4). But nothing said by Brentano actually\nwarrants this assumption. Brentano takes (5) to be an independent\nclaim supported by the testimony of inner experience: \nThe same object is present to consciousness whether a person affirms\nit, denies it, or uncertainly asks about it; in the last case it is\nmerely presented, in the first two cases it is simultaneously\npresented and acknowledged or denied. (PES 221 [II 63; SVS 1, 241];\nauthors translation) \nA charitable interpretation of Brentano may reconstruct his reasoning\nhere as follows: Inner experience shows that positive and negative\nexistential judgements concern the same object, symbolized by\n“A”. If Brentano can establish\n claim (5)\n in that way, he once more rules out a propositional analysis of these\njudgements, and may thus buttress his arguments in favor of\n claim (4).\n We will encounter further reasons that speak for accepting (5) later\n(in\n section 5),\n where we discuss Brentano’s reasons for rejecting negative\nproperties. \nAt this stage, the structure of Brentano’s theory already leaves\nopen several possible interpretations. Neither the significance of\n (4)\n nor of\n (5)\n in Brentano’s theory are completely clear. That is to say: it\nis not completely clear that Brentano actually needs these two claims\nfor backing up his theory, in particular for backing up his claim that\ncombining two ideas in thought is not necessary for making a judgement\n(=\n claim 2).\n While Brentano presents his theory as a single whole in which claims\n(2), (4), and (5) form a tight package. one may unravel that package\nand accept (2) on the basis of (4) alone or independently of (4) and\n(5) altogether. \nIn the final part of his theory Brentano turns to so-called\ncategorical propositions. These are the sentences with which\ntraditional logic is primarily concerned: sentences of the form\n“All S are P”, “No S is\nP”, “Some S are P” and\n“Some S are not P”. With respect to these\npropositions, Brentano takes the same view as Leibniz: \nIt can be shown with utmost clarity that every categorical proposition\ncan be translated without any change of meaning into an existential\nproposition (PES 214, [II 56; SVS 1, 236]). \nIn order to prove this claim, Brentano offers examples for the\nfollowing translation schemes: \nA proposition of the form “All S are P”\nmeans the same as “An S that is not P does not\nexist.” \nA proposition of the form “No S is P” means\nthe same as “An S that is P does not\nexist.” \nA proposition of the form “Some S are P”\nmeans the same as “An S that is \nexists.” \nA proposition of the form “Some S are not P”\nmeans the same as “An S that is not P\nexists.” \nThese are semantic claims about the meanings of sentences. In this\ncase, Brentano trusts our linguistic intuitions and takes them to tell\nus something about the judgements expressed by these\npropositions. The translations are meant to reveal to us the true\nforms of judgement expressed by categorical propositions. Thus,\nBrentano advances the following reduction thesis: \nNotice that whereas the above translation schemes are symmetrical, the\nreduction thesis involves an asymmetry claim. It does not say\nthat existential propositions express categorical judgements, but\nconversely that categorical propositions express existential\njudgements. There is no explicit argument in Brentano for this\ninterpretation of the translation schemes. Rather, it is the context\nin which Brentano puts forward the reduction thesis that must provide\na justification for it. \nHow might this work? Well, consider the following argument which\nBrentano constructs with the help of\n claim (6): \nIn running this argument, Brentano advances from a claim about the\nmeaning of the copula “is” that he takes to be\nincontestable to a (contestable) claim about the meaning of\n“exists”. It is the direction of this argument that\nrequires the reduction claim made in the second premise. Thus, it is\nthe purpose of the argument that fixes for Brentano the direction in\nwhich the reduction has to go. \nIf one accepts the premises, the argument is sound. However, it still\nleaves open how one evaluates the entire argument because there are\nhidden assumptions in the premises that Brentano does not disclose. To\nmake them explicit, one has to read the argument as follows: \nThe copula does not add anything to the meaning of the terms S\nand P, and hence nothing to the subject matter of the expressed\njudgement if the subject matter is fixed by these concepts.\nTherefore, given (6), the term “exists” adds nothing to\nthe subject matter of an existential judgement if the subject\nmatter is identified with the subject matter of the categorical\nproposition which forms the basis of the reduction. \nThe parts in italics are the tacit assumptions that Brentano makes in\nthis argument. Anyone who takes the subject matter of judgements to be\npropositions would deny them and hence the soundness of the argument.\nThat would not immediately disprove the reduction\n claim (6),\n but it would deprive Brentano of a good reason for introducing an\nasymmetry into his translation schemes. Because of this problem, it\nseems questionable whether Brentano’s reduction project in the\nthird part of his theory succeeds. Apparently, Brentano himself\nchanged his mind on the validity of his argument when he later\ndeveloped his theory of double judgement (see\n section 5\n below). That means that he no longer can make use of his initial\nargument to show that “existence” has no meaning by\nitself. \nWe have seen that Brentano heavily relies on the special case of\nexistential judgements in developing a general account of judgement\nand criticizes other views because they do not work for those cases.\nWhile Brentano’s approach is original, he also draws on a range\nof sources. He finds in Aristotle, Aquinas and Kant anticipations of\nthe idea that existential judgements involve no predication (=\n claim 4).\n However, none of the named philosophers goes as far as Brentano and\ntakes all judgements to be existential. Hence, Brentano can indeed\nclaim that his own theory fills a gap in the history of ideas.\nLet’s consider what Brentano took from his predecessors in\nhistorical order. \nIn Psychology (PES 212 fn, [II 54 fn; SVS 1, 234 fn 246])\nBrentano says in a long footnote that Aristotle hinted at the right\nconception of existential judgement in Metaphysics and in\nDe Interpretatione. In Metaphysics Book IX (θ)\n10 Aristotle is faced with a problem. He has told his readers that one\njudges truly if one separates in thought what is separated in reality\nand combines in thought what is combined in reality. For example, if\nPlato and foolishness are separated—the former does not have the\nlatter—one judges truly if one separates Plato and foolishness\nin thought, that is, judges that Plato is not foolish. But now\nAristotle goes on to tell us that there are incomposites that\nare not combined with anything. How can one make true or false\n judgements pertaining to such\n things?[8] \nAristotle introduces in response a further, different notion of truth\nand judgement. Judgements pertaining to incomposites are\n“touchings” of or put us into “contact” with\nthese things, a notion that Brentano renders as\n“perception”: \nIn fact, as truth is not the same in these cases, so also being is not\nthe same; but truth or falsity is as follows—contact and\nassertion are truth (assertion not being affirmation), and ignorance\nis non-contact. (Metaphysics,\n 1051b21–25)[9] \n\nIn Brentano’s eyes, Aristotle’s “redefinition”\nof judgement and truth is highly suggestive. It shows that the\nstrategy to explain judgement and truth in terms of combining and\nseparating runs into a problem. Aristotle's appeal to the idea of\ntouching an object suggests a non-propositional form of\njudgement—good from Brentano’s perspective—while the\npostulation of two different kinds of judgement, propositional as well\nas non-propositional, results in a non-uniform account of\njudgement—bad from Brentano’s perspective. We want a\nuniform account of judgement. But such an account may not be\navailable, as Brentano later came to see. In his theory of double\njudgement he accepts, like Aristotle did, the pattern of recognition\nof non-predicative judgement combined with postulating other kinds of\n judgement (see\n section 5). \nBrentano refers also with approval to the third chapter of De\nInterpretatione. There Aristotle says about the copula “to\nbe” or “to be not” that “by itself it is\nnothing, but it additionally signifies some combination, which cannot\nbe thought of without the components.” Brentano renders this as\n \nthe “being” of the copula does not in itself signify\nanything, as a name does, but simply completes the expression of a\njudgement.  \nAs a correct reading of Aristotle this is dubious. Aristotle has the\ncopula signifying some combination. It is not merely\n“completing” the expression of a judgement, that is,\n“to be” is not only a syncategorematic expression. But we\ncan use Brentano’s interpretation of Aristotle to shed further\nlight on his own positive view. He wants to say that the meaning of\n“is” is the same in the following sentences: \nIn both sentences “is” has meaning or reference of its\nown. Hence, one cannot understand the judgement expressed by (b) as a\npredication of a property: “is” does not name the property\nof being. \nWhat does “is” then do in “God is”? In his\nanswer of this question Brentano took inspiration from St. Thomas and\nKant: \nIn the Middle Ages, St. Thomas came as close as Kant to the truth,\nremarkably enough by reflecting upon the same proposition, “God\nexists”. According to him, the “is” is not a real\npredicate but merely a sign of affirmation (Summa Theologica,\nP. I, Q. 3, A. 4 ad 2). \n(PES 211 fn, [II 53 fn; SVS 1, 234 fn 244]) \nWhat is telling here is Brentano’s use of the word\n“merely”. It implies that one can use a sign for\naffirmation without using that very same sign also as a sign for\npredication. Following Brentano’s own suggestion, we can make\nthis clear by introducing a simple formalism. Let us use the sign\n“+” as a sign for a mere affirmation (like a question mark\nis a mere sign for asking a question), and let us use\n“+is” as a sign that expresses both a judgement and a\npredication. Then we can symbolize the two judgements above as\nfollows: \nThat is the inspiration that Brentano gets from St. Thomas. But,\nagain, there is something in St. Thomas that Brentano finds\n objectionable.[11]\n As Brentano notes, Aquinas wants to uphold Aristotle’s theory\nof truth which requires that every judgement is a comparison between a\nrepresentation and its object. He does not admit that existential\njudgements simply do not fit this description. \nIt is important to note that “+” is a sign of affirmation\nand not a predicate. For example, Sundholm (2009: 274) argues that\nBrentano simply “rediscovered” an idea of Bolzano.\nAccording to Sundholm, Bolzano takes “A exists” to express\nthe propositions that the idea [A] has an object; “A does not\nexist” expresses the negation of this property. The appearance\nthat Brentano recycles this view is dispelled when we notice that\n“+” does not express a presentation, but only determines\nin which mode a content is to be thought. \nLet us now turn to Kant. Brentano disagrees with Kant’s\nepistemology on almost every single point. With respect to the nature\nof judgement, Brentano points out that Kant overlooks their essential\ncharacter by putting them together with presentations into a single\ncategory: acts of thinking. He also takes Kant to task for holding on\nto the mistaken view that a judgement always unifies several\nrepresentations (Critique of Pure Reason, A 68-9/B93-4). Thus\nit may come as a surprise that there is also a strong agreement\nbetween their views. Kant anticipates Brentano’s claim that a\n“single feature which is the object of a presentation can be\nacknowledged or denied, too” (PES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 230]). The\ninsight can be found in Kant’s seminal discussion of\nexistence: \nBeing is obviously not a real predicate, i.e., a concept of something\nthat could add to the concept of a thing. It is merely the positing of\na thing or of certain determinations in themselves. (Critique of\nPure Reason, A 598) \nKant’s slogan “being is not a real predicate” has\nbeen interpreted as saying that “exists” is no first-order\npredicate of objects, but a second-order predicate true of concepts.\nWhether this is the correct interpretation is not important for our\npurposes. Primed by Aquinas’s remarks on “to be”,\n Brentano reads Kant’s remark\n differently.[12]\n When I judge that God exists, I posit an omniscient being, but I do\nnot add something to the concept of an omniscient being. Instead of\nsaying “exists” is not a real predicate, Kant should have\nsaid that it is not a predicate at all, but a force-indicator: it has\npositing force. \nFrom Brentano’s point of view, Kant commits the same mistake as\nSt. Thomas. He too tries to make existential judgements agree with the\ntraditional view that every judgement is a combination of\nrepresentations. To fit into Kant’s category of synthetic\njudgement, the existential judgement that God exists must add\nsomething to the concept of God. “This is,” remarks\nBrentano, “an unclear and contradictory semi-truth” (PES\n211 [II 54; SVS 1, 234]; translation improved). \nKant may be forgiven his oversight, if one realizes how many logicians\nfollowed his path and found it equally incomprehensible to reach the\nposition that Brentano advocates. A telling example of such\nincomprehension is provided by John Stuart Mill in his letter to\nBrentano: \n1. I agree with you that Belief is the essential constituent in a\nDifferentia of judgment, and that the putting together of two ideas is\nmerely a prerequisite or antecedent condition. \n2. I cannot, however, think that one idea is a sufficient prerequisite\nfor a judgment. I cannot see how there can be Belief without both a\nsubject and a predicate. If you say that the idea of an elephant\nsuffices for belief in an elephant, belief in an elephant can only\nmean belief that there is such a thing as an elephant—that an\nelephant exists: or, in other words, that under some circumstances,\nand in some place known or unknown, I should perceive by my senses a\nthing answering the definition of an elephant. Now this, which is the\ntruth really believed, is a fact, in two terms, not in one\n only.[13]\n (Mill 1872 [1972: 1928–9]) \nThe one philosopher that came closest to Brentano’s view on\njudgement was Johann Friedrich\n Herbart.[14]\n Herbart does not try to assimilate existential and so-called\n“subjectless” statements (“It rains”) to\ncategorical one’s of the form “S is\n P”.[15]\n And he takes “is” in “God is” to be the sign\nof “absolute positing” (unbedingte Aufstellung)\n(Herbart 1813: 49). While Brentano praises Herbart for holding this\nview, he does not pick up his terminology, expecting little insight\nfrom the associations it encourages. \nThese comparisons are not only historically instructive. They give us\na good sense of how radical Brentano’s position really is. It is\nradical in its demand that a theory of judgement must accommodate and\nnot explain away existential judgements. And it is even more radical\nin its refusal to make existential judgements satisfy any version of\nthe view of judging as a combinatory or synthetic act, which would\nnicely fit with the correspondence theory of truth. In refusing to\ntake this step that most philosophers considered to be inevitable,\nBrentano put a heavy burden on a theory of judgement that tries to\ngive a uniform account of existential and subjectless judgements as\nwell as categorical judgements. Brentano thought that he can pull off\nthis trick by turning the traditional approach to this problem inside\nout: instead of trying to show that in fact all judgements are\ncategorical ones, he tries to show that all judgements are\nexistential. If all judgements are reducible to existential ones, no\njudgement applies a property or concept to an object. That may sound\nludicrous, but it is the only alternative left, unless one is willing\nto sacrifice the goal of giving a uniform account of judgement as a\ndistinct mental category. \nWe have now introduced the idea that animates Brentano’s theory\nof judgement: predication is one thing, judgement another. We have\nseen which views inspired Brentano to disentangle judgement and\npredication. However, so far we lack a reason to follow\nBrentano’s lead. How can he convince his readers that\npredication is not necessary for judgement, since we already judge\nwhen we merely accept or reject an object? \nSometimes Brentano simply trusts his readers to agree with him if they\npay sufficient attention to their own judgements and compare them\nwith, for example, presentations. Consider, for instance, the\nfollowing passage from the opening section of Brentano’s\ndiscussion of judgement in PES: \nIt is […] true that nothing is an object of judgement which is\nnot an object of presentation, and we maintain that when the object of\npresentation becomes the object of an affirmative or negative\njudgement, our consciousness enters into a completely new kind of\nrelationship with the object. […] This, we maintain, is\nrevealed clearly to us by inner perception and the attentive\nobservation of the phenomena of judgement in memory. (PES 201 [II\n38–9; SVS 1, 223, emphasis added) \nSo, if we are able to episodically remember judging something, we can\ncome to know that the same object given in a presentation can be\nacknowledged or rejected in judgement and that acknowledging and\nrejecting are distinct in kind from presentation. \nBut merely encouraging a philosopher who is in the grip of the idea\nthat judging is predication to pay more attention when recalling his\njudgements will not yield the intended results. Is there an argument\nthat will establish Brentano’s view on the basis of\nuncontroversial premises? Brentano thinks there is an argument that is\n based on premises his opponents find\n compelling:[16] \nThat predication is not the essence of every judgement emerges quite\nclearly from the fact that all perceptions are judgements, whether\nthey are instances of knowledge or just a mistaken taking to be true\n[Fürwahrnehmen]. And this is not denied by those\nthinkers who hold that every judgement consists in a conjunction of\nsubject and predicate. […] [I]t is hard to think of anything\nmore obvious and unmistakable than the fact that a perception is not a\n[connection] of a concept of the subject and a concept of a predicate,\nnor does it refer to such a connection. Rather, the object of an\ninner perception is simply a mental phenomenon, and the\nobject of an external perception is simply a physical\nphenomenon, a sound, odor, or the like. We have here, then, a very\nobvious proof of the truth of our assertion. (PES 209 [II 50–51;\nSVS 1, 232]) \nEveryone—even predication theorists of\njudgement—believe that in perceiving we don’t connect the\nconcept of a subject with that of a predicate. No\none—even predication theorists of judgement—denies\nthat every perception is a judgement. So, everyone accepts that there\nare some judgements that don’t predicate a property of something\n(connect a concept of a subject with a concept of a predicate). A\nfortiori the predication theorist of judgement is rationally\ncompelled to accept that there are non-predicational judgements. If he\ndoes not do so, his view of judgement is not in harmony with the right\nview of perception. Hence, the view of judgement as predication must\nbe revised. \nHow obvious is Brentano’s “very obvious” proof?\nLet’s consider Brentano’s first premise first. A\ncharitable reading of Brentano should assume that by\n“perception” he means what philosophers following Fred\nDretske now call “non-epistemic perception”. I can see\nsomething without having any beliefs about it to the effect\nthat it is so-and-so. I see the yellow canary because it looks\ndistinct from its immediate environment; I can’t see the\nchameleon because it does not look distinct from its environment. \nIs non-epistemic seeing a form of predication? Prima facie,\nit isn’t. When I see the yellow canary, I am directed towards an\nobject and it appears distinct from its environment. The canary is\ngiven to me in such a way that I can attend to it in perception, but I\nmight abstain from making any predicative judgement about it for the\ntime being. \nBrentano takes it to be beyond doubt that such a perception is a\njudgement, only not a predicative one. Why should one think of seeing\na yellow canary or hearing a sound as a judgement in the first place?\nConsider again your perception of the yellow canary. The canary looks\ndifferent from its surroundings to you and you can train your\nattention on it. In this situation you will, to use a non-committal\nphrase, “take the canary to be real”. Seeing the canary is\na particular kind of “taking the canary to be”, namely as\nsomething real; in Brentano’s terminology that is “an\nacknowledging of the canary”. If this is right, there are\njudgements that do not predicate any properties of an object and\nmerely acknowledge it. \nLet us consider three objections to firm up our understanding of\nBrentano’s line of thought. \nObjection 1: But one cannot “take something to be real”,\nyet not predicate any property of it. Taking something to be real is\njust predicating existence of it. Brentano considers this objection\n himself:[17] \nBecause we say not only that we perceive a color, a sound, an act of\nseeing, an act of hearing, but also that we perceive the existence of\nan act of seeing or of an act of hearing, someone might be led to\nbelieve that perception, too, consists in the acknowledgement\n[Anerkennung] of the conjunction of the attribute\n“existence” with the phenomenon in question. Such a\nmisunderstanding of obvious facts seems to me almost inconceivable.\n(PES 210 [II 51–52; SVS 1, 232]) \nAs said before, Brentano’s claim that the facts are obvious\nbears little argumentative weight. But the view that every\n(non-epistemic) perception is a judgement to the effect that something\nexists over-intellectualizes non-epistemic perception. Infants and\ndogs see and hear things. Does Brentano’s opponent really want\nto say that they make judgements to the effect that the objects\nperceived exist? Yet, a dog certainly takes the canary to be real when\nit chases it. \nBrentano also provides a more theoretical reason against the view that\n(non-epistemic) perception consists in predications of existence (PES\n210 [II 51–52; SVS 1, 232]). The view makes it difficult to\nexplain how we manage to acquire the concept of existence. If we\nexercise the concept in every (non-epistemic) perception, the concept\nof existence must come with the capacity to perceive objects and\nqualities. Brentano finds this unbelievable. \nIn turn, if acknowledging an object does not presuppose possession of\nthe concept of existence, our introspective knowledge of\nacknowledgement may be used to introduce the concept of existence.\nBrentano pursued this strategy following Aristotle: \nAristotle had already recognized that [the concept of existence] is\nacquired by reflection on the affirming judgement. (TE 27 [45],\ntranslation\n improved)[18] \nObjection 2: Seeing the yellow canary is not the same thing as\nacknowledging it. For instance, one can see an object without\nacknowledging it “if one does not trust one’s eyes.”\nI see the canary before me, but since you have given me misleading\nevidence that I am now hallucinating, I do not trust my senses and do\nnot take the canary to be real. So, seeing and judging are\nrelated—maybe (consciously) seeing something prompts one to\njudge that it is—but these mental acts are distinct. \nIn later work Brentano suggested that in such cases we do acknowledge\nthe bird as well as judge that there is no object in the scene\nperceived. Just as we can love and hate an object, we can accept and\nreject an object at the same time: \nAn affect that is reined in by a contradicting higher love still truly\npersists. Similarly, an acceptance of an object given in sensation,\nwhich is disapproved of by a higher judgement, could persist. Indeed,\nit is not at all clear, how the lower activity should be changed in\nits intrinsic character because of the occurrence of the higher\nactivity; if the lower activity had a relation of acceptance to the\nouter object before, it will have it later. (VNV 26, author\ntranslation.) \nIt is thus possible to acknowledge and reject an object at the same\ntime, although this is clearly not a mental state one prefers to be\nin. But sometimes things are not as we like them to be. \nWith this in mind Brentano can say that when we mistrust our senses we\nacknowledge an object, but this judgement conflicts with other\njudgements or beliefs that we have with regard to this matter. \n\nObjection 3: We have already seen that Brentano subscribes to a\nPolarity Thesis: Acknowledging an object x has an opposite: rejecting\nx (see\n section 1, claim 5).\n These attitudes are directed towards the same object, yet only one of\nthem can be correct even if they may co-exist, as Brentano allows. The\n correctness of acknowledging x is incompatible with the correctness of\nrejecting it. Hence, if non-epistemic perception is a kind of\nacknowledgement, it must have an opposite. But what could be the\n opposite of\n seeing?[19]\n According to Peter Geach, there is nothing here to be found except\nthe exclusion relation between (instances of) properties that we\nsee: \nBelieving, like seeing, has no polar opposite, though contrary dogmas\nmay be believed, as contrary colours may be seen. (Geach 1965:\n455) \nHowever, Brentano’s view of perception could gain plausibility\nby contrasting it with a form of doubt that is also non-epistemic and\ndirectly opposed to it. If I see a yellow canary, that very act could\nmake it incorrect to raise a doubt of a non-epistemic kind. If\ndoubting can be like acknowledging an object-directed act with a\nnon-propositional content, then Brentano’s Polarity thesis\nstands. If not, we must either revise the Polarity Thesis or\nBrentano’s view of perception. \nBrentano tells us that perceiving an object is acknowledging it. Such\nperceptions are for Brentano the prime example of existential\njudgements. In such judgements we acknowledge an object without\npredicating anything of it. Based on this observation, Brentano argues\nthat simple existential judgements are not of the categorical form\n“S is P” or “S has the property\nP”. In other words, simple judgements do not have a\npropositional content. In making such judgements we affirm the\nexistence of some object, but we do not affirm that the\nobject which we perceive exists. \nThe consequences of this move are indeed far reaching. Even when we\npredicate a property of an object, Brentano can say that the\npredication need not change the character of the judgement\nthat we are making. One may conceive of predication as a two-step\nprocess: one first connects the property P with the subject\nS, thus forming a complex representation of an\nS-that-is-P; then one affirms that such a complex exists\nand thus forms a judgement. The representation is complex, but the\njudgement itself is the same simple act of affirmation. \nSo far Brentano’s theory seems to have a sound footing. Now we\nneed to make a big step when we consider Brentano’s most radical\nthesis: what we called his reduction thesis (see\n section 1, claim 6):\n “The reducibility of categorical propositions, indeed the\nreducibility of all propositions which express a judgement, to\nexistential propositions is therefore indubitable” (PES 218 [II\n60; SVS 1, 239). Before we can ask on what basis Brentano makes this\nclaim, we need to get clear about its meaning. \nBrentano introduces the notion of “reduction” at a\nlinguistic level, applying it to sentences (or\n“propositions”), but what he is aiming at is a reduction\nat the level of mental phenomena. At the linguistic level, the claim\nis that any categorical proposition can be transformed without change\nof meaning into an existential proposition. At the level of judgement,\nthe claim is that all judgements are in fact existential in character\n(and hence non-propositional). That shows for Brentano how language\ndisguises the true nature of our judgements. When somebody asserts,\nfor instance, that all S are P, he seems to\nmake a positive judgement about all S. In fact, however, his\njudgement is negative and of the form “No\nS-that-is-not-P exists”. The point of the\nreduction thesis is to remove the linguistic disguise and to uncover\nthe true form of our judgements. It also ensures that the judgements\nexpressed by categorical and existential propositions are of the same\nkind. While such unification could also be achieved by saying that\nexistential propositions express categorical judgement,\nBrentano’s thesis reverses that claim by declaring categorical\npropositions to express existential judgements. \nThat is the view that Brentano puts forth in the first edition of his\nPsychology (1874). However, Brentano had second thoughts on\nthis matter. While holding on to his view that existential\npropositions express categorical judgements, and that categorical\npropositions can express existential judgements, Brentano\nlater dropped the reduction thesis. At least since 1889, Brentano no\nlonger thought that categorical propositions only express\nexistential judgements. He states the result of this change of view in\nprint first in Vom Ursprung sittlicher Erkenntnis: \nThe judgement expressed in the sentence “The rose is a\nflower” is composed out of two judgements of which one is the\nacknowledgement of the subject […] (OKRW fn. 22 [SVS 3,\n67f.]) \nIt turns out that I make two judgements in one—a “double\njudgement”—when I seem to make only one: the judgement\nthat the rose is a flower. Furthermore, higher-order judgements about\nthe correctness and incorrectness of judgements exhibit the same\ncomplexity and come to play a prominent role in Brentano’s\ntheory. \nThese new ideas complicate Brentano’s theory and force one to\nrethink the entire project of reducing categorical propositions to\nexistential ones. We will do this in two steps. In this section, we\ntake a closer look at the reduction thesis in the context in which it\noriginally appears. In\n section 5\n we explain why Brentano gave up this project. \nWe already noted that Brentano’s Psychology is not just\na book about mental phenomena. It also includes fundamental\nconsiderations pertaining to logic and epistemology. In that sense\nBrentano is no doubt a “psychologist”. He takes judgements\nto be the primary bearers of truth, he defines logical inferences as\nrelations between judgements, and he considers validity to emerge from\nthe evidence of our judgements about such relations. In taking this\napproach, Brentano sets himself apart from the rising\n“mathematical logic” (see PES Appendix x). Instead of\napplying mathematical tools in logic, Brentano believed that logic\nwill advance better by applying the tools of descriptive psychology.\nTo prove his case, Brentano sketches a reform of traditional logic\nbased on his reduction thesis. \nTo begin with, Brentano challenges the logic contained in the\ntraditional square of opposition. This square is made up of the four\ncategorial propositions:  \nAmong others, the following logical relations have been claimed to\nhold among these propositions (see Parsons 2017): \nBrentano rejects almost all these principles. After translating the\ncategorical propositions into existential form, he concludes that (i)\nand (ii) are the only rules correctly identified by traditional logic.\n(iii) to (vi) turn out to be mistaken if S is an empty term.\n(vii) and (viii) are correct principles, but no real conversion of a\njudgement takes place. The converted propositions simply express\none judgement in two ways. This is why Brentano says that his\ntheory  \nleads to nothing less than a complete overthrow, and at the same time,\na reconstruction of elementary logic. Everything then becomes simpler,\nclearer, and more exact. (PES 230 [II 77; SVS 1,\n 251]) \nThe core idea from which Brentano starts is very simple: traditional\nlogic takes the A-form and the I-form to express positive judgements,\nand the E-form and the O-form to express negative ones. According to\nBrentano, that is a confusion. All universal propositions (both A and\nE) express negative judgements and therefore lack existential import,\nwhereas all particular propositions (both I and O) express positive\njudgements with existential import. The reduction thesis fits in\nnicely with this idea, or so it seems. It helps us to correctly\ninterpret the principles of traditional logic and to see which of them\none should retain. In turn, the simplification of the square of\nopposition lends support to the reduction thesis. Everything seems to\nfit\n nicely.[20] \nBut a closer look reveals that this tight fit between Brentano’s\ntheory of judgement and his reform of logic is illusory. With the\nadvance of quantificational logic, it became clear that in order to\ncorrect the square of oppositions in the way in which Brentano\nsuggests, all one needs to do is to use existentially quantified\nformulas instead of categorical propositions (see Church 1947: 56).\nThis observation contains both good and bad news for Brentano. The\ngood news is that Brentano’s logical intuitions find support in\nquantificational logic. The bad news is that his reduction thesis\nceases to play a role in reforming logic. Surely, a quantified formula\nmay express an existential judgement with a non-propositional\ncontent, as Brentano conceived it, but it may also express a judgement\nwith a propositional content. To put it in other words:\nBrentano’s revision of traditional logic can be replicated\nwithout making use of his reduction thesis. \nWhen one reads the first edition of Brentano’s\nPsychology, the reduction thesis appears to be the backbone\nof Brentano’s theory of judgement. But that is in fact not so.\nIn the second edition (1911) Brentano added several appendices, one of\nwhich is entitled “On genuine and fictitious objects” (PES\nappendix ix). Here Brentano recapitulates his theory of judgement and\nturns his back on the reduction thesis. Neither is it true, Brentano\nnow says, that all categorical propositions can be transformed without\nchange of meaning into existential propositions. Nor is it true that\nall judgements are of existential form. \nIt takes a careful reading to fully appreciate the significance of\nBrentano’s change of mind. While the change is dramatic, it does\nnot undermine Brentano’s theory completely. On the contrary. All\nof the following claims still remain in place: in perception we make\nsimple existential judgements by affirming or rejecting an object that\nwe perceive (PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1,\n 413])[21]\n ; categorical propositions can be equivalent with existential\npropositions (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416]; existential propositions\ncan express concepts with a complex subject matter (ibid.). While\nthese claims all remain unchanged, what Brentano gives up is the idea\nof uniformity in the realm of judgement. That is what Brentano’s\nanti-reduction turn comes to: \nWhy did Brentano turn away from a unified theory of judgement?\nConsider first a line of reasoning that Brentano may have used in one\nof his\n lectures:[22] \n[…] since Aristotle, the categorical form has been considered\nas the basic form of judgement, while the other doctrine that the\nbasic form of judgement is the existential form emerged only in recent\ntimes. Yet there can be no doubt that the absolute majority of our\njudgements take the form “A is B”, not the existential\nform, and that the Aristotelian logic made the right decision to\nground its logical developments on that form [of judgement]. This\napparent contradiction we must try to resolve. (LRU 113f., author\ntranslation) \nWhether it was Hillebrand or Brentano who made the point, it is a very\ngood question: Why should one bother to reduce categorical to\nexistential judgements, if most of our judgements are expressed in\ncategorical form? That is to say: Why not take such propositions at\nface value instead of claiming that language disguises the nature of\nour judgements? \nHowever, there is also a good answer to this question. We usually do\nnot make simple judgements, but what Brentano now calls “double\njudgements”, and in order to express such judgements we make use\nof the categorical form. In a double-judgement one affirms the\nexistence of some object and then adds a second judgement that\npresupposes that the first judgement has been made. \nThe novel idea here is that judgements become more complex when they\nare built up in three steps: First one presents an object\nS and acknowledges its existence. Then one presents a property\nP and identifies P with the object S in thought\nthat one has acknowledged, and finally one acknowledges S with\nthe addition of [mit der Zugabe] P. (see PES 295 [II\n164; SVS 1, 413] \nWhat is it to identify P with S in thought? Brentano\ntells us that identification is not a kind of judgement and that the\nresult of an identification is a presentation (PES 317, [II\n 206]).[23]\n A natural way to understand Brentano is to think of identification as\na way of forming complex presentations. Brentano seems mainly to have\nconjunction in mind. We can conjoin the presentation of [warm] and\n[round] to the presentation of [something warm & round].\nConjunction is here a primitive operation on presentations that is\nindependent of\n judgement.[24] \nBut what is the point of this complication? Why does Brentano not\nstick with the simpler two-step procedure that we are already familiar\nwith: first, one combines S and P in an act of\npresentation, prior to making any judgement, and then one acknowledges\n“S-that-is-P” as a complex object? Is there\na special way of identifying S and P which presupposes\nthat the object S has to be acknowledged before such an\nidentification can be\n made?[25] \nDemonstrative judgements are a good case to support Brentano’s\nnew idea: \nA sentence of the form “That thing is P” expresses\na double judgement consisting of (i) an acknowledgement of the object\npicked out by the demonstrative “that thing” and (ii) the\nconjoinng of the idea [That] and [P] (read as “the thing\nwhich is that and P” and (iii) an acknowledgement of the\nthing which is that and P. \nThe formulation of the second judgement must be chosen with care. One\nwould miss Brentano’s point, if one took the second judgement to\nhave as content “that the thing just acknowledged is\nP”. Acknowledging an object and judging that one\nacknowledges it are not the same thing. Therefore, one could make the\nlatter judgement without actually making the first affirmation. That\nis ruled out if one describes the second judgement as affirming of\nthat thing that has been acknowledged, that it is P.\nOnly thus one capture’s Brentano idea that in a double-judgement\nthe second judgement is inseparable from the first: one can affirm\nsomething of an object only after one has actually affirmed its\nexistence (see PES 296 [II 165; SVS 1,\n 414]).[26] \nAnother possible misunderstanding is worth mentioning at this point.\nWe have earlier seen that Brentano, like Frege, distinguishes\npredication from judgement. Now it may seem that Brentano backtracks\non this agreement. On his new theory it seems that predication occurs\nwhen one affirms P of S, which means when one judges of\nS that it is P. But Brentano does not backtrack on this\npoint. He still holds that predication occurs prior to and\nindependently of judging. That is what the three-step process in a\ndouble-judgement guarantees: after acknowledging S, one must\nfirst identify P with S, i.e., predicate P of\nS, before one can judge that S is P, i.e.,\nacknowledge S in conjunction with P. \nLet us now turn to a second line of reasoning with which Brentano\nmotivates his new theory. This line involves a thorough\nreconsideration of the categorical propositions of traditional logic.\nFollowing the model of singular propositions just elaborated, Brentano\nsuggests that propositions of the I-form and the O-form also express\ndouble-judgements: \nLooked at more closely […a judgement of the form “Some\nS is P”] signifies a double judgement\n(Doppelurteil), one part of which acknowledges the\nsubject, and, after the predicate has been identified in presentation\nwith the subject, the other part acknowledges the subject which had\nbeen acknowledged all by itself by the first part, but with this\naddition—which is to say it ascribes to it the predicate\nP. (PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1, 413], translation amended) \nLikewise, the O-form “Some S is not P”: \nconsists of the acknowledgement of S, and this is the basic\nconstituent of the double judgements. The second part relates to it\nand presupposes it in such a way as to be inseparable from it. And\nthis second part is negative: it does not […] ascribe an\nattribute to the S, […] but rather denies one of it.\n(ibid.) \nWhat is the rationale behind these claims? It is obviously no\ncoincidence that Brentano makes them in the context of discussing the\ndistinction between genuine and fictitious objects. This distinction\nbecomes important for him because judgements are intentional mental\nacts, and as such they can be both about real things or about\ninventions of our own minds. These invented or\n“fictitious” objects can be of various kinds. We may\ninvent something in hallucination or by imagining it in our dreams,\nlike a magical island, or we may read about a mythological figure\ndescribed in a story, like Pegasus, or we may invent non-existing\nobjects by our way of speaking or as part of a metaphysical\ntheory. \nIn the present context, Brentano is concerned particularly with\nfictitious objects invented by language or metaphysics: he calls them\n“negatives”, since they are denoted by negative terms\nwhich may occur either in the subject-position or the\npredicate-position of a categorical proposition. Such terms are\nregularly used in common language when one speaks of an\n“unintelligent man”, or an “unattractive\nthing” (PES 298 [II 169; SVS 1,\n 417].[27]\n Or they may be introduced by artificial terms like “a non-white\nthing” or a “non-human”. Brentano denies that such\nterms actually have a denotative function and denote something that\ncould be made an object of judgement. The following consideration may\nbe taken as supporting Brentano’s point: When we count the\nproperties of an object, only genuine properties should count. The\nproperties of a flower may include being red and being a rose; but in\naddition to that the rose does not also have the further properties of\nbeing not-black and being not a daisy. It is of course correct to\nsay that the flower is neither black nor a daisy, but in\nsaying this one does not ascribe negative properties to it. One simply\ndenies that it has the properties of being black and being a daisy.\nThat is why Brentano insists that negation belongs to the mode of\njudgement, not to its content (see\n section 1, claim 5).\n  \nBrentano requires from a theory of judgement that it stays away from\npostulating fictitious entities of any kind. In this respect his\nearlier analysis of propositions of the O-form and the A-form turns\nout to be deficient. His claim about the O-form was that in judging\nthat S is not P, one affirms the existence of an\nS-that-is-not-P. That conflicts with his restriction\nagainst negative properties because when one affirms a complex like\nS-that-is-not-P, one affirms all of its parts (see PES\n208 [II 49; SVS 1, 231]). Thus, in affirming an\nS-that-is-not-P, one would affirm not only the entire\ncomplex, but also both of its “parts”: S and\nnot-P. Note that the problem cannot be solved by joining the\nnegation with the copula “is”, because the copula\nindicates the quality of the judgement and propositions of the O-form\nexpress positive judgements according to Brentano. \nThe way out of this problem is provided by Brentano’s theory of\ndouble-judgement. On the new analysis, judgements of the O-form are\npartially positive and partially negative. They affirm the existence\nof the subject S, and then deny the predicate P of that\nsubject. Now the negation belongs to the mode of judgement, not to its\nsubject matter. \nBrentano considers this new analysis to provide a further insight into\nthe way how language disguises the nature of \njudgement.[28]\nObviously, we cannot read off from the linguistic expression whether a\ngiven proposition expresses a simple or a double-judgement. It takes\nthe scalpel of a philosopher to figure this out. In some cases,\nhowever, no decision may be reached. Then Brentano advises us to\nconsider the proposition to be homonymous. This seems to be the proper\nverdict with propositions of the I-form. They can be interpreted\neither as expressing a simple judgement (“an SP exists”)\nor a double-judgement (“an S exists and that S is\nP”) (see LRU 114, and Hillebrand 1891: 98). \nA further ambiguity of this kind arises in the case of propositions of\nthe E-form (“No S is P”). Their explicit\nnegative quality speaks against an interpretation that takes them to\nexpress a double-judgement like propositions of the\n O-form.[29]\n Brentano therefore ventures another idea what these propositions\nexpress: judgements of higher-order or\n“meta-judgements”: \nAnyone who says, “No S is P” is thinking of\nsomeone judging that “An S is P”, and\ndeclaring that in thinking of him in this way he is thinking of\nsomeone who judges incorrectly. (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416]) \nBrentano here exploits the principle that judgements of the E-form\ncontradict judgements of the I-form. Denying that someone judges\ncorrectly that S is P, therefore means to judge that no\nS is P. Likewise, Brentano exploits the principle that\nA-judgements contradict O-judgements when he says that propositions of\nthe A-form also express meta-judgements:  \nIf the O-form means the double-judgement “There is an S\nand it is not P”, then the proposition “Every\nS is P,” says that anyone who makes both of those\njudgements is judging falsely. (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416]) \nIn this way, Brentano again manages to satisfy the restriction on\nnegative properties. His earlier theory takes propositions of the\nA-form to express simple existential judgement. Brentano now considers\nthat to be a mistake because it introduces the complex\nS-that-is-not-P, which includes the negative part\n“not-P”. Again, the “not” here cannot be taken\nas an indicator of the quality of the judgement, since one would then\ndeny the existence of an S-that-is P. With propositions\nof the E-form this problem does not arise. In this case, two\ninterpretations are admissible, which makes “No S is\nP” an ambiguous proposition: it either expresses the\nsimple negative existential judgement that no\nS-that-is-P exists, or the higher-order judgement that\nsomeone who accepts an S-that-is-P judges\nincorrectly. \nIn sum, Brentano’s theory of double-judgement shows why a\nreduction of all categorical propositions to existential judgements is\n impossible.[30]\n On the other hand, there is no way for Brentano of reducing\nexistential propositions to propositions expressing double-judgements.\nBrentano is therefore forced to abandon the project of giving a\nuniform treatment of all judgements within the constraints of his\n theory.[31]","contact.mail":"johannes.brandl@sbg.ac.at","contact.domain":"sbg.ac.at"},{"date.published":"2000-11-22","date.changed":"2018-11-23","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brentano-judgement/","author1":"Johannes L.

Brentano used that conception not only for distinguishing\nmental from physical phenomena, but also for developing a\nclassification of mental phenomena. If intentionality is a fundamental\nfeature of any mental act, Brentano argues, differences in the way\nmental phenomena are directed toward something constitute differences in\nkind between mental acts. Judgements are one of the three basic kinds\nof intentional phenomena with which Brentano deals at great length in\nhis Psychology. That is not to say, however, that\nBrentano’s theory of judgement is just concerned with\npsychological issues. Brentano also aims to show how an experience of\njudging, specifically the experience of judging correctly, can provide\nus with a basis for grasping concepts like existence, truth, and\nlogical inference. Brentano’s investigation of the mental act of\njudgement promises therefore to advance logic, epistemology, and\nultimately metaphysics.\n\n\nMuch of that work which Brentano started in his Psychology\nremained unfinished. It was left to his students to further flesh out\nhis view by drawing on lecture notes, letters, and unpublished\nmaterial from Brentano’s Nachlass. Whether all the\nclaims that have been ascribed to Brentano in this literature actually\nbelong to his theory remains a matter of debate in the\n literature.[1]\n From a contemporary perspective, an interesting question is which of\nthe following two claims find support in Brentano’s theory:\n\n(A)Some judgements have a propositional\ncontent, others not.\n\n(B)No judgement has a propositional\ncontent.\n\nMost scholars take claim (B) to be Brentano’s\n view.[2]\n They do this on the ground that Brentano often takes a dismissive\nattitude towards “half way” theories by his contemporaries\nthat have room for both propositional and non-propositional\njudgements. However, when we consider Brentano’s conception of\ndouble judgement in section 5 below, we will find that double\njudgements play the role that predicative judgements are supposed to\nplay in other theories. It is therefore also possible to interpret\nBrentano as being committed only to a version of claim (A), according\nto which the propositional content of a judgement supervenes on the\ncontent of several non-propositional acts that make up the\njudgement.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we start with an overview of Brentano’s theory\nof judgement, as far as it is contained in the first edition of the\nPsychology. It will be convenient to divide the material\ncovered by Brentano in chapter 7 of this work (and the final section\nof chapter 6) into four parts. The first part tries to establish the\nfundamental difference between judgements (Urteile) and\npresentations (Vorstellungen); the second part pertains to\nthe relation between judgement and truth; the third part deals with\nexistential judgements and their intentional objects; and the fourth\npart proposes a reduction of categorical and hypothetical judgements\nto the existential form. \nAs a philosopher of mind, Brentano takes it to be his task to develop\nspecific accounts of whatever phenomena one finds in inner experience.\nTo do so, one has to pay close attention to the different ways in\nwhich phenomena are directed toward something (see PES 197 [II 32; SVS 1,\n218]), and Kriegel 2017: 99ff). Applying this method to the case of\njudgement, Brentano arrives at the claim that judgements are clearly\ndistinguishable from presentations. The question that concerns him is\nhow precisely they differ. Brentano invokes three negative\nclaims to draw that distinction: \nWhen someone asks me “Is any tree red?” I will combine\nthese ideas in pondering the question, but how much I combine them, I\nmight still remain undecided whether they exist together or not. That\nsuffices to make claim (1) plausible. \n\n Claim (1)\n is compatible with the view that judging always means to hold true a\nproposition. For Brentano, that is not the right way to understand\nclaim (1) however. In order to rule out that interpretation, Brentano\ninvokes the following pair of claims: \nTogether, claims (2) and (3) imply that judgements can be made without\njudging a sentence or proposition to be true. That is what Brentano\ntries to establish. Let us see how he tries to achieve this goal. \nBrentano considers three possible ways of conceiving of the difference\nbetween presentations and judgements. There may be (i) an intrinsic\ndifference between them, (ii) they may differ in their objects, or\n(iii) in a perfection [Vollkommenheit] with which these\nobjects are thought (PES 204, [II 42f.; SVS 1, 226]). \nLet’s start with (i). What would it mean that the distinction\nbetween judgement and presentation is not intrinsic, i.e.,\nextrinsic? It would mean that the distinction between judgement and\npresentation consists in a relational property that one of these\nmental phenomena has while the other lacks it. In this sense the\ndistinction between a bachelor and a husband is extrinsic: bachelors\nlack the relational property of being married to someone; husbands\nhave it. Nothing else distinguishes bachelors and husbands from each\nother: there is no intrinsic property of husbands or bachelors that\ngrounds the relational difference. Is the distinction between\njudgement and presentation like the distinction between husbands and\nbachelors? According to Alexander Bain, it is. For Bain there are two\nkinds of ideas (presentations): those that dispose one to\nact—this is the extrinsic or relational property—and\nothers that don’t. The former are judgements and beliefs, the\nlatter are mere presentations (see Bain 1872: 372f). Mill (1878:\n403–4) criticized Bain’s proposal as incomplete. In\ngeneral, a dispositional property like disposing one to act on an\nobject is grounded in its categorical properties. Hence, the\nbelief-constituting disposition to act must be grounded in categorical\nproperties of ideas and these properties seem to be intrinsic. The\nrelational difference is not brute as in the husband/bachelor\ncase. \nBrentano finds Mill’s line of thought persuasive (see PES 202f.\n[II 40; SVS 1,\n 224]).[3]\n By Brentano’s lights, any explanation of the distinction\nbetween judgement and presentation in terms of a difference in\n“impact” on mental states or actions is\n unsatisfactory.[4]\n Like Mill, he goes for the first of the three options above: the\ndifference between presentations and judgement is an intrinsic\none. \nOn to (ii). Is the intrinsic difference between judgement and\npresentation one that concerns the objects presented? Is a judgement a\nmental phenomenon in which a connection between different features is\nthought, while a presentation does not apprehend a relation between\none or more features (cf. PES 205 [II 44; SVS 1, 227])? Again\nBrentano’s answer is NO. His argument is based on considerations\nabout existential judgements which we will discuss in detail below (in\npart III). In essence, the argument is that the existential judgement\nthat A is and a presentation of A have the same object:\nthey are both directed towards A and not a combination of\nA with something else. \nIs the intrinsic difference between judgement and presentation one\nthat concerns a perfection in which mental phenomena that have the\nsame object differ? Brentano identifies the perfection as\nstrength, intensity or vivacity of the\nmental phenomena concerned. Is, as Brentano says, “a judgement a\nstronger presentation and a presentation a weaker judgement”?\n(PES 204 [II 44; SVS 1, 226]; author translation) Brentano says NO. A\nstrong presentation is no judgement. This argument, while suggestive,\nis not persuasive because the notion of strength, vividness or\nintensity seems unclear. However, in the second edition Brentano adds\nan important consideration that improves the argument. If presentation\nand judgement were distinguished in strength, both would need to have\npositions on a scale of strength. However, Brentano now doubts that\nthere is one scale of intensity or strength on which presentations and\njudgements both lie. Different degrees of conviction that may\naccompany an act of judgement should not be confused with the degrees\nof intensity with which an object can be presented to the mind, e.g.,\nin sensation (PES 286f. [II 151ff.; SVS 1, 401). If there is not one\ndimension of strength in which both judgement and presentation can\ndiffer, strength cannot distinguish between them. \nBrentano concludes that the distinction between judgement and\npresentation is intrinsic and irreducible to other distinctions\nbetween these mental phenomena. Hillebrand (1891: 26–7) called\nBrentano’s view therefore an “idiogenetic” theory of\njudgement—it takes judgement to be a fundamental kind of mental\nphenomenon—while “allogenetic” theories take\njudgements to be composed out of other mental phenomena that belong to\nfundamental kinds. \nBut are things not much easier? Brentano himself says: \nBy “judgement” we mean, in accordance with common\nphilosophical usage, acceptance [annehmen](as true) or\nrejection [verwerfen] (as false). We have already noted,\nhowever, that such acceptance or rejection also occurs in cases in\nwhich many people would not use the term “judgement,” as,\nfor example, in the perception of mental acts and in remembering. (PES\n198 [II 34; SVS 1, 219]) \nBrentano acknowledges that “accepting as true” or\n“rejecting as false” is the natural way to describe an act\nof judgement (PES 201 [II 38; SVS 1, 223]). Meanwhile philosophers\nhave changed their habits. While it is still true, of course, that\njudgements can be true or false, most philosophers are swayed by\nFrege’s or Reinach’s argument that all judgements are\nacceptances as\n true.[5]\n When one rejects a proposition as false, e.g., that there is\nextraterrestrial life, this is still a positive judgement for them,\nbecause in making the judgement one takes it to be true that\nno life exists beyond earth. Brentano would contest this by saying\nthat their point only concerns the linguistic expression of our\njudgements, not the judgements themselves. We can find for each\njudgement a sentence that is true if and only if the judgement\nexpressed in it is correct, but that does not show that the judgement\nitself always has a positive quality. \nWhy does the characterization of judgement as either an accepting as\ntrue or a rejecting as false not suffice to distinguish judgement from\npresentation? After all, one can present something without accepting\nit as true. Because saying that in judgement we take something to be\ntrue is potentially misleading. The following passage shows what\nBrentano is aiming at: \nIf we say that every acknowledging judgement [anerkennendes\nUrteil] is an act of taking something to be true, and every\nrejecting judgement [verwerfendes Urteil] an act of taking\nsomething to be false, this does not mean that the former consists in\npredicating truth of what is taken to be true and the latter in\npredicating falsity of what is taken to be false. Our previous\ndiscussions have shown, rather, that what the expressions denote is a\nparticular kind of intentional reception of an object, a distinctive\nkind of mental reference to a content of consciousness. The only\ncorrect interpretation is that anyone who takes something to be true\nwill not only acknowledge the object, but, when asked whether the\nobject is to be acknowledged, will also acknowledge the object’s\nto-be-acknowledgedness [das Anzuerkennensein], i.e., its\ntruth (which is all that is meant by this barbarous expression).\n(PES 240 [II 89; SVS 1, 259]; emphasis added and translation\nimproved). \nThe point that Brentano wants to get across is a delicate one and\nrequires a careful wording. It is no coincidence that Brentano prefers\nhere the term “anerkennen” over\n“annehmen”, which would be closer to common usage\nin philosophy. The reason is that Brentano thinks that the more common\nway of speaking wrongly suggests that one predicates truth when one\naccepts something as true. According to Brentano, as will become clear\nlater, judgement requires no predication (not even a predication of\nexistence). Hence, the difference in meaning between “accepting\n(annehmen)” and “acknowledging\n(anerkennen)” becomes important for\n him.[6] \nBrentano’s observation leads to an important result: To say that\nsomething is true does not mean that there is an object, a\nproposition, of which one predicates a property, being true. Rather,\nwe can take the act of judgement itself as the vehicle which is true.\nTo say that a judgement is true means to make a judgement of\nhigher-order, namely to acknowledge that the object of the first\njudgement is worthy of either being acknowledged or rejected.\nPropositions are not needed for making sense of the concept of\ntruth. \nExistential judgements play a fundamental role in Brentano’s\narguments against other views of judgement as well as in his positive\naccount of judgement. Brentano’s discussion of existential\njudgements aims to show that such judgements cannot be conceived as\npredications of properties (see\n section 1.1)\n and that such judgements are either acknowledgements or rejections of\nobjects. \nThe argument focuses on existential propositions and tries to\nestablish that a mental act of denial is on a par with an act of\nacceptance. Note, that by an existential proposition we do not mean\nhere the content of a judgement, but sentences of\nthe following form: \nA exists, an A exists, As exist. \nA does not exist, an A does not exist, As do not\nexist. \nThe argument developed by Brentano relies on the following\nprinciple: \n[W]henever someone acknowledges [anerkennen] a combination of\nattributes he simultaneously acknowledges each particular element of\nthe combination. (PES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 231]; authors\ntranslation) \nApplying the principle to the case of judgement, Brentano says: \nIf this judgement were the acknowledgement of the combination of an\nattribute “existence” with A, then it would include\nthe acknowledgement of each individual element in the combination, and\nhence would include the acknowledgement of A. (ibid.) \nAcknowledging A already does all the work that judging that\nA exists is supposed to do: to commit one to the existence of\nA. Since one cannot judge that A exists without\nacknowledging A, judging that A exists is necessarily\n redundant.[7]\n Thus, we get as an intermediary conclusion of the argument the\nfollowing claim: \nWhat Brentano wants to show is this: \nThe order in which we list the two claims might suggest that (5)\nsomehow follows from (4). But nothing said by Brentano actually\nwarrants this assumption. Brentano takes (5) to be an independent\nclaim supported by the testimony of inner experience: \nThe same object is present to consciousness whether a person affirms\nit, denies it, or uncertainly asks about it; in the last case it is\nmerely presented, in the first two cases it is simultaneously\npresented and acknowledged or denied. (PES 221 [II 63; SVS 1, 241];\nauthors translation) \nA charitable interpretation of Brentano may reconstruct his reasoning\nhere as follows: Inner experience shows that positive and negative\nexistential judgements concern the same object, symbolized by\n“A”. If Brentano can establish\n claim (5)\n in that way, he once more rules out a propositional analysis of these\njudgements, and may thus buttress his arguments in favor of\n claim (4).\n We will encounter further reasons that speak for accepting (5) later\n(in\n section 5),\n where we discuss Brentano’s reasons for rejecting negative\nproperties. \nAt this stage, the structure of Brentano’s theory already leaves\nopen several possible interpretations. Neither the significance of\n (4)\n nor of\n (5)\n in Brentano’s theory are completely clear. That is to say: it\nis not completely clear that Brentano actually needs these two claims\nfor backing up his theory, in particular for backing up his claim that\ncombining two ideas in thought is not necessary for making a judgement\n(=\n claim 2).\n While Brentano presents his theory as a single whole in which claims\n(2), (4), and (5) form a tight package. one may unravel that package\nand accept (2) on the basis of (4) alone or independently of (4) and\n(5) altogether. \nIn the final part of his theory Brentano turns to so-called\ncategorical propositions. These are the sentences with which\ntraditional logic is primarily concerned: sentences of the form\n“All S are P”, “No S is\nP”, “Some S are P” and\n“Some S are not P”. With respect to these\npropositions, Brentano takes the same view as Leibniz: \nIt can be shown with utmost clarity that every categorical proposition\ncan be translated without any change of meaning into an existential\nproposition (PES 214, [II 56; SVS 1, 236]). \nIn order to prove this claim, Brentano offers examples for the\nfollowing translation schemes: \nA proposition of the form “All S are P”\nmeans the same as “An S that is not P does not\nexist.” \nA proposition of the form “No S is P” means\nthe same as “An S that is P does not\nexist.” \nA proposition of the form “Some S are P”\nmeans the same as “An S that is \nexists.” \nA proposition of the form “Some S are not P”\nmeans the same as “An S that is not P\nexists.” \nThese are semantic claims about the meanings of sentences. In this\ncase, Brentano trusts our linguistic intuitions and takes them to tell\nus something about the judgements expressed by these\npropositions. The translations are meant to reveal to us the true\nforms of judgement expressed by categorical propositions. Thus,\nBrentano advances the following reduction thesis: \nNotice that whereas the above translation schemes are symmetrical, the\nreduction thesis involves an asymmetry claim. It does not say\nthat existential propositions express categorical judgements, but\nconversely that categorical propositions express existential\njudgements. There is no explicit argument in Brentano for this\ninterpretation of the translation schemes. Rather, it is the context\nin which Brentano puts forward the reduction thesis that must provide\na justification for it. \nHow might this work? Well, consider the following argument which\nBrentano constructs with the help of\n claim (6): \nIn running this argument, Brentano advances from a claim about the\nmeaning of the copula “is” that he takes to be\nincontestable to a (contestable) claim about the meaning of\n“exists”. It is the direction of this argument that\nrequires the reduction claim made in the second premise. Thus, it is\nthe purpose of the argument that fixes for Brentano the direction in\nwhich the reduction has to go. \nIf one accepts the premises, the argument is sound. However, it still\nleaves open how one evaluates the entire argument because there are\nhidden assumptions in the premises that Brentano does not disclose. To\nmake them explicit, one has to read the argument as follows: \nThe copula does not add anything to the meaning of the terms S\nand P, and hence nothing to the subject matter of the expressed\njudgement if the subject matter is fixed by these concepts.\nTherefore, given (6), the term “exists” adds nothing to\nthe subject matter of an existential judgement if the subject\nmatter is identified with the subject matter of the categorical\nproposition which forms the basis of the reduction. \nThe parts in italics are the tacit assumptions that Brentano makes in\nthis argument. Anyone who takes the subject matter of judgements to be\npropositions would deny them and hence the soundness of the argument.\nThat would not immediately disprove the reduction\n claim (6),\n but it would deprive Brentano of a good reason for introducing an\nasymmetry into his translation schemes. Because of this problem, it\nseems questionable whether Brentano’s reduction project in the\nthird part of his theory succeeds. Apparently, Brentano himself\nchanged his mind on the validity of his argument when he later\ndeveloped his theory of double judgement (see\n section 5\n below). That means that he no longer can make use of his initial\nargument to show that “existence” has no meaning by\nitself. \nWe have seen that Brentano heavily relies on the special case of\nexistential judgements in developing a general account of judgement\nand criticizes other views because they do not work for those cases.\nWhile Brentano’s approach is original, he also draws on a range\nof sources. He finds in Aristotle, Aquinas and Kant anticipations of\nthe idea that existential judgements involve no predication (=\n claim 4).\n However, none of the named philosophers goes as far as Brentano and\ntakes all judgements to be existential. Hence, Brentano can indeed\nclaim that his own theory fills a gap in the history of ideas.\nLet’s consider what Brentano took from his predecessors in\nhistorical order. \nIn Psychology (PES 212 fn, [II 54 fn; SVS 1, 234 fn 246])\nBrentano says in a long footnote that Aristotle hinted at the right\nconception of existential judgement in Metaphysics and in\nDe Interpretatione. In Metaphysics Book IX (θ)\n10 Aristotle is faced with a problem. He has told his readers that one\njudges truly if one separates in thought what is separated in reality\nand combines in thought what is combined in reality. For example, if\nPlato and foolishness are separated—the former does not have the\nlatter—one judges truly if one separates Plato and foolishness\nin thought, that is, judges that Plato is not foolish. But now\nAristotle goes on to tell us that there are incomposites that\nare not combined with anything. How can one make true or false\n judgements pertaining to such\n things?[8] \nAristotle introduces in response a further, different notion of truth\nand judgement. Judgements pertaining to incomposites are\n“touchings” of or put us into “contact” with\nthese things, a notion that Brentano renders as\n“perception”: \nIn fact, as truth is not the same in these cases, so also being is not\nthe same; but truth or falsity is as follows—contact and\nassertion are truth (assertion not being affirmation), and ignorance\nis non-contact. (Metaphysics,\n 1051b21–25)[9] \n\nIn Brentano’s eyes, Aristotle’s “redefinition”\nof judgement and truth is highly suggestive. It shows that the\nstrategy to explain judgement and truth in terms of combining and\nseparating runs into a problem. Aristotle's appeal to the idea of\ntouching an object suggests a non-propositional form of\njudgement—good from Brentano’s perspective—while the\npostulation of two different kinds of judgement, propositional as well\nas non-propositional, results in a non-uniform account of\njudgement—bad from Brentano’s perspective. We want a\nuniform account of judgement. But such an account may not be\navailable, as Brentano later came to see. In his theory of double\njudgement he accepts, like Aristotle did, the pattern of recognition\nof non-predicative judgement combined with postulating other kinds of\n judgement (see\n section 5). \nBrentano refers also with approval to the third chapter of De\nInterpretatione. There Aristotle says about the copula “to\nbe” or “to be not” that “by itself it is\nnothing, but it additionally signifies some combination, which cannot\nbe thought of without the components.” Brentano renders this as\n \nthe “being” of the copula does not in itself signify\nanything, as a name does, but simply completes the expression of a\njudgement.  \nAs a correct reading of Aristotle this is dubious. Aristotle has the\ncopula signifying some combination. It is not merely\n“completing” the expression of a judgement, that is,\n“to be” is not only a syncategorematic expression. But we\ncan use Brentano’s interpretation of Aristotle to shed further\nlight on his own positive view. He wants to say that the meaning of\n“is” is the same in the following sentences: \nIn both sentences “is” has meaning or reference of its\nown. Hence, one cannot understand the judgement expressed by (b) as a\npredication of a property: “is” does not name the property\nof being. \nWhat does “is” then do in “God is”? In his\nanswer of this question Brentano took inspiration from St. Thomas and\nKant: \nIn the Middle Ages, St. Thomas came as close as Kant to the truth,\nremarkably enough by reflecting upon the same proposition, “God\nexists”. According to him, the “is” is not a real\npredicate but merely a sign of affirmation (Summa Theologica,\nP. I, Q. 3, A. 4 ad 2). \n(PES 211 fn, [II 53 fn; SVS 1, 234 fn 244]) \nWhat is telling here is Brentano’s use of the word\n“merely”. It implies that one can use a sign for\naffirmation without using that very same sign also as a sign for\npredication. Following Brentano’s own suggestion, we can make\nthis clear by introducing a simple formalism. Let us use the sign\n“+” as a sign for a mere affirmation (like a question mark\nis a mere sign for asking a question), and let us use\n“+is” as a sign that expresses both a judgement and a\npredication. Then we can symbolize the two judgements above as\nfollows: \nThat is the inspiration that Brentano gets from St. Thomas. But,\nagain, there is something in St. Thomas that Brentano finds\n objectionable.[11]\n As Brentano notes, Aquinas wants to uphold Aristotle’s theory\nof truth which requires that every judgement is a comparison between a\nrepresentation and its object. He does not admit that existential\njudgements simply do not fit this description. \nIt is important to note that “+” is a sign of affirmation\nand not a predicate. For example, Sundholm (2009: 274) argues that\nBrentano simply “rediscovered” an idea of Bolzano.\nAccording to Sundholm, Bolzano takes “A exists” to express\nthe propositions that the idea [A] has an object; “A does not\nexist” expresses the negation of this property. The appearance\nthat Brentano recycles this view is dispelled when we notice that\n“+” does not express a presentation, but only determines\nin which mode a content is to be thought. \nLet us now turn to Kant. Brentano disagrees with Kant’s\nepistemology on almost every single point. With respect to the nature\nof judgement, Brentano points out that Kant overlooks their essential\ncharacter by putting them together with presentations into a single\ncategory: acts of thinking. He also takes Kant to task for holding on\nto the mistaken view that a judgement always unifies several\nrepresentations (Critique of Pure Reason, A 68-9/B93-4). Thus\nit may come as a surprise that there is also a strong agreement\nbetween their views. Kant anticipates Brentano’s claim that a\n“single feature which is the object of a presentation can be\nacknowledged or denied, too” (PES 208 [II 49; SVS 1, 230]). The\ninsight can be found in Kant’s seminal discussion of\nexistence: \nBeing is obviously not a real predicate, i.e., a concept of something\nthat could add to the concept of a thing. It is merely the positing of\na thing or of certain determinations in themselves. (Critique of\nPure Reason, A 598) \nKant’s slogan “being is not a real predicate” has\nbeen interpreted as saying that “exists” is no first-order\npredicate of objects, but a second-order predicate true of concepts.\nWhether this is the correct interpretation is not important for our\npurposes. Primed by Aquinas’s remarks on “to be”,\n Brentano reads Kant’s remark\n differently.[12]\n When I judge that God exists, I posit an omniscient being, but I do\nnot add something to the concept of an omniscient being. Instead of\nsaying “exists” is not a real predicate, Kant should have\nsaid that it is not a predicate at all, but a force-indicator: it has\npositing force. \nFrom Brentano’s point of view, Kant commits the same mistake as\nSt. Thomas. He too tries to make existential judgements agree with the\ntraditional view that every judgement is a combination of\nrepresentations. To fit into Kant’s category of synthetic\njudgement, the existential judgement that God exists must add\nsomething to the concept of God. “This is,” remarks\nBrentano, “an unclear and contradictory semi-truth” (PES\n211 [II 54; SVS 1, 234]; translation improved). \nKant may be forgiven his oversight, if one realizes how many logicians\nfollowed his path and found it equally incomprehensible to reach the\nposition that Brentano advocates. A telling example of such\nincomprehension is provided by John Stuart Mill in his letter to\nBrentano: \n1. I agree with you that Belief is the essential constituent in a\nDifferentia of judgment, and that the putting together of two ideas is\nmerely a prerequisite or antecedent condition. \n2. I cannot, however, think that one idea is a sufficient prerequisite\nfor a judgment. I cannot see how there can be Belief without both a\nsubject and a predicate. If you say that the idea of an elephant\nsuffices for belief in an elephant, belief in an elephant can only\nmean belief that there is such a thing as an elephant—that an\nelephant exists: or, in other words, that under some circumstances,\nand in some place known or unknown, I should perceive by my senses a\nthing answering the definition of an elephant. Now this, which is the\ntruth really believed, is a fact, in two terms, not in one\n only.[13]\n (Mill 1872 [1972: 1928–9]) \nThe one philosopher that came closest to Brentano’s view on\njudgement was Johann Friedrich\n Herbart.[14]\n Herbart does not try to assimilate existential and so-called\n“subjectless” statements (“It rains”) to\ncategorical one’s of the form “S is\n P”.[15]\n And he takes “is” in “God is” to be the sign\nof “absolute positing” (unbedingte Aufstellung)\n(Herbart 1813: 49). While Brentano praises Herbart for holding this\nview, he does not pick up his terminology, expecting little insight\nfrom the associations it encourages. \nThese comparisons are not only historically instructive. They give us\na good sense of how radical Brentano’s position really is. It is\nradical in its demand that a theory of judgement must accommodate and\nnot explain away existential judgements. And it is even more radical\nin its refusal to make existential judgements satisfy any version of\nthe view of judging as a combinatory or synthetic act, which would\nnicely fit with the correspondence theory of truth. In refusing to\ntake this step that most philosophers considered to be inevitable,\nBrentano put a heavy burden on a theory of judgement that tries to\ngive a uniform account of existential and subjectless judgements as\nwell as categorical judgements. Brentano thought that he can pull off\nthis trick by turning the traditional approach to this problem inside\nout: instead of trying to show that in fact all judgements are\ncategorical ones, he tries to show that all judgements are\nexistential. If all judgements are reducible to existential ones, no\njudgement applies a property or concept to an object. That may sound\nludicrous, but it is the only alternative left, unless one is willing\nto sacrifice the goal of giving a uniform account of judgement as a\ndistinct mental category. \nWe have now introduced the idea that animates Brentano’s theory\nof judgement: predication is one thing, judgement another. We have\nseen which views inspired Brentano to disentangle judgement and\npredication. However, so far we lack a reason to follow\nBrentano’s lead. How can he convince his readers that\npredication is not necessary for judgement, since we already judge\nwhen we merely accept or reject an object? \nSometimes Brentano simply trusts his readers to agree with him if they\npay sufficient attention to their own judgements and compare them\nwith, for example, presentations. Consider, for instance, the\nfollowing passage from the opening section of Brentano’s\ndiscussion of judgement in PES: \nIt is […] true that nothing is an object of judgement which is\nnot an object of presentation, and we maintain that when the object of\npresentation becomes the object of an affirmative or negative\njudgement, our consciousness enters into a completely new kind of\nrelationship with the object. […] This, we maintain, is\nrevealed clearly to us by inner perception and the attentive\nobservation of the phenomena of judgement in memory. (PES 201 [II\n38–9; SVS 1, 223, emphasis added) \nSo, if we are able to episodically remember judging something, we can\ncome to know that the same object given in a presentation can be\nacknowledged or rejected in judgement and that acknowledging and\nrejecting are distinct in kind from presentation. \nBut merely encouraging a philosopher who is in the grip of the idea\nthat judging is predication to pay more attention when recalling his\njudgements will not yield the intended results. Is there an argument\nthat will establish Brentano’s view on the basis of\nuncontroversial premises? Brentano thinks there is an argument that is\n based on premises his opponents find\n compelling:[16] \nThat predication is not the essence of every judgement emerges quite\nclearly from the fact that all perceptions are judgements, whether\nthey are instances of knowledge or just a mistaken taking to be true\n[Fürwahrnehmen]. And this is not denied by those\nthinkers who hold that every judgement consists in a conjunction of\nsubject and predicate. […] [I]t is hard to think of anything\nmore obvious and unmistakable than the fact that a perception is not a\n[connection] of a concept of the subject and a concept of a predicate,\nnor does it refer to such a connection. Rather, the object of an\ninner perception is simply a mental phenomenon, and the\nobject of an external perception is simply a physical\nphenomenon, a sound, odor, or the like. We have here, then, a very\nobvious proof of the truth of our assertion. (PES 209 [II 50–51;\nSVS 1, 232]) \nEveryone—even predication theorists of\njudgement—believe that in perceiving we don’t connect the\nconcept of a subject with that of a predicate. No\none—even predication theorists of judgement—denies\nthat every perception is a judgement. So, everyone accepts that there\nare some judgements that don’t predicate a property of something\n(connect a concept of a subject with a concept of a predicate). A\nfortiori the predication theorist of judgement is rationally\ncompelled to accept that there are non-predicational judgements. If he\ndoes not do so, his view of judgement is not in harmony with the right\nview of perception. Hence, the view of judgement as predication must\nbe revised. \nHow obvious is Brentano’s “very obvious” proof?\nLet’s consider Brentano’s first premise first. A\ncharitable reading of Brentano should assume that by\n“perception” he means what philosophers following Fred\nDretske now call “non-epistemic perception”. I can see\nsomething without having any beliefs about it to the effect\nthat it is so-and-so. I see the yellow canary because it looks\ndistinct from its immediate environment; I can’t see the\nchameleon because it does not look distinct from its environment. \nIs non-epistemic seeing a form of predication? Prima facie,\nit isn’t. When I see the yellow canary, I am directed towards an\nobject and it appears distinct from its environment. The canary is\ngiven to me in such a way that I can attend to it in perception, but I\nmight abstain from making any predicative judgement about it for the\ntime being. \nBrentano takes it to be beyond doubt that such a perception is a\njudgement, only not a predicative one. Why should one think of seeing\na yellow canary or hearing a sound as a judgement in the first place?\nConsider again your perception of the yellow canary. The canary looks\ndifferent from its surroundings to you and you can train your\nattention on it. In this situation you will, to use a non-committal\nphrase, “take the canary to be real”. Seeing the canary is\na particular kind of “taking the canary to be”, namely as\nsomething real; in Brentano’s terminology that is “an\nacknowledging of the canary”. If this is right, there are\njudgements that do not predicate any properties of an object and\nmerely acknowledge it. \nLet us consider three objections to firm up our understanding of\nBrentano’s line of thought. \nObjection 1: But one cannot “take something to be real”,\nyet not predicate any property of it. Taking something to be real is\njust predicating existence of it. Brentano considers this objection\n himself:[17] \nBecause we say not only that we perceive a color, a sound, an act of\nseeing, an act of hearing, but also that we perceive the existence of\nan act of seeing or of an act of hearing, someone might be led to\nbelieve that perception, too, consists in the acknowledgement\n[Anerkennung] of the conjunction of the attribute\n“existence” with the phenomenon in question. Such a\nmisunderstanding of obvious facts seems to me almost inconceivable.\n(PES 210 [II 51–52; SVS 1, 232]) \nAs said before, Brentano’s claim that the facts are obvious\nbears little argumentative weight. But the view that every\n(non-epistemic) perception is a judgement to the effect that something\nexists over-intellectualizes non-epistemic perception. Infants and\ndogs see and hear things. Does Brentano’s opponent really want\nto say that they make judgements to the effect that the objects\nperceived exist? Yet, a dog certainly takes the canary to be real when\nit chases it. \nBrentano also provides a more theoretical reason against the view that\n(non-epistemic) perception consists in predications of existence (PES\n210 [II 51–52; SVS 1, 232]). The view makes it difficult to\nexplain how we manage to acquire the concept of existence. If we\nexercise the concept in every (non-epistemic) perception, the concept\nof existence must come with the capacity to perceive objects and\nqualities. Brentano finds this unbelievable. \nIn turn, if acknowledging an object does not presuppose possession of\nthe concept of existence, our introspective knowledge of\nacknowledgement may be used to introduce the concept of existence.\nBrentano pursued this strategy following Aristotle: \nAristotle had already recognized that [the concept of existence] is\nacquired by reflection on the affirming judgement. (TE 27 [45],\ntranslation\n improved)[18] \nObjection 2: Seeing the yellow canary is not the same thing as\nacknowledging it. For instance, one can see an object without\nacknowledging it “if one does not trust one’s eyes.”\nI see the canary before me, but since you have given me misleading\nevidence that I am now hallucinating, I do not trust my senses and do\nnot take the canary to be real. So, seeing and judging are\nrelated—maybe (consciously) seeing something prompts one to\njudge that it is—but these mental acts are distinct. \nIn later work Brentano suggested that in such cases we do acknowledge\nthe bird as well as judge that there is no object in the scene\nperceived. Just as we can love and hate an object, we can accept and\nreject an object at the same time: \nAn affect that is reined in by a contradicting higher love still truly\npersists. Similarly, an acceptance of an object given in sensation,\nwhich is disapproved of by a higher judgement, could persist. Indeed,\nit is not at all clear, how the lower activity should be changed in\nits intrinsic character because of the occurrence of the higher\nactivity; if the lower activity had a relation of acceptance to the\nouter object before, it will have it later. (VNV 26, author\ntranslation.) \nIt is thus possible to acknowledge and reject an object at the same\ntime, although this is clearly not a mental state one prefers to be\nin. But sometimes things are not as we like them to be. \nWith this in mind Brentano can say that when we mistrust our senses we\nacknowledge an object, but this judgement conflicts with other\njudgements or beliefs that we have with regard to this matter. \n\nObjection 3: We have already seen that Brentano subscribes to a\nPolarity Thesis: Acknowledging an object x has an opposite: rejecting\nx (see\n section 1, claim 5).\n These attitudes are directed towards the same object, yet only one of\nthem can be correct even if they may co-exist, as Brentano allows. The\n correctness of acknowledging x is incompatible with the correctness of\nrejecting it. Hence, if non-epistemic perception is a kind of\nacknowledgement, it must have an opposite. But what could be the\n opposite of\n seeing?[19]\n According to Peter Geach, there is nothing here to be found except\nthe exclusion relation between (instances of) properties that we\nsee: \nBelieving, like seeing, has no polar opposite, though contrary dogmas\nmay be believed, as contrary colours may be seen. (Geach 1965:\n455) \nHowever, Brentano’s view of perception could gain plausibility\nby contrasting it with a form of doubt that is also non-epistemic and\ndirectly opposed to it. If I see a yellow canary, that very act could\nmake it incorrect to raise a doubt of a non-epistemic kind. If\ndoubting can be like acknowledging an object-directed act with a\nnon-propositional content, then Brentano’s Polarity thesis\nstands. If not, we must either revise the Polarity Thesis or\nBrentano’s view of perception. \nBrentano tells us that perceiving an object is acknowledging it. Such\nperceptions are for Brentano the prime example of existential\njudgements. In such judgements we acknowledge an object without\npredicating anything of it. Based on this observation, Brentano argues\nthat simple existential judgements are not of the categorical form\n“S is P” or “S has the property\nP”. In other words, simple judgements do not have a\npropositional content. In making such judgements we affirm the\nexistence of some object, but we do not affirm that the\nobject which we perceive exists. \nThe consequences of this move are indeed far reaching. Even when we\npredicate a property of an object, Brentano can say that the\npredication need not change the character of the judgement\nthat we are making. One may conceive of predication as a two-step\nprocess: one first connects the property P with the subject\nS, thus forming a complex representation of an\nS-that-is-P; then one affirms that such a complex exists\nand thus forms a judgement. The representation is complex, but the\njudgement itself is the same simple act of affirmation. \nSo far Brentano’s theory seems to have a sound footing. Now we\nneed to make a big step when we consider Brentano’s most radical\nthesis: what we called his reduction thesis (see\n section 1, claim 6):\n “The reducibility of categorical propositions, indeed the\nreducibility of all propositions which express a judgement, to\nexistential propositions is therefore indubitable” (PES 218 [II\n60; SVS 1, 239). Before we can ask on what basis Brentano makes this\nclaim, we need to get clear about its meaning. \nBrentano introduces the notion of “reduction” at a\nlinguistic level, applying it to sentences (or\n“propositions”), but what he is aiming at is a reduction\nat the level of mental phenomena. At the linguistic level, the claim\nis that any categorical proposition can be transformed without change\nof meaning into an existential proposition. At the level of judgement,\nthe claim is that all judgements are in fact existential in character\n(and hence non-propositional). That shows for Brentano how language\ndisguises the true nature of our judgements. When somebody asserts,\nfor instance, that all S are P, he seems to\nmake a positive judgement about all S. In fact, however, his\njudgement is negative and of the form “No\nS-that-is-not-P exists”. The point of the\nreduction thesis is to remove the linguistic disguise and to uncover\nthe true form of our judgements. It also ensures that the judgements\nexpressed by categorical and existential propositions are of the same\nkind. While such unification could also be achieved by saying that\nexistential propositions express categorical judgement,\nBrentano’s thesis reverses that claim by declaring categorical\npropositions to express existential judgements. \nThat is the view that Brentano puts forth in the first edition of his\nPsychology (1874). However, Brentano had second thoughts on\nthis matter. While holding on to his view that existential\npropositions express categorical judgements, and that categorical\npropositions can express existential judgements, Brentano\nlater dropped the reduction thesis. At least since 1889, Brentano no\nlonger thought that categorical propositions only express\nexistential judgements. He states the result of this change of view in\nprint first in Vom Ursprung sittlicher Erkenntnis: \nThe judgement expressed in the sentence “The rose is a\nflower” is composed out of two judgements of which one is the\nacknowledgement of the subject […] (OKRW fn. 22 [SVS 3,\n67f.]) \nIt turns out that I make two judgements in one—a “double\njudgement”—when I seem to make only one: the judgement\nthat the rose is a flower. Furthermore, higher-order judgements about\nthe correctness and incorrectness of judgements exhibit the same\ncomplexity and come to play a prominent role in Brentano’s\ntheory. \nThese new ideas complicate Brentano’s theory and force one to\nrethink the entire project of reducing categorical propositions to\nexistential ones. We will do this in two steps. In this section, we\ntake a closer look at the reduction thesis in the context in which it\noriginally appears. In\n section 5\n we explain why Brentano gave up this project. \nWe already noted that Brentano’s Psychology is not just\na book about mental phenomena. It also includes fundamental\nconsiderations pertaining to logic and epistemology. In that sense\nBrentano is no doubt a “psychologist”. He takes judgements\nto be the primary bearers of truth, he defines logical inferences as\nrelations between judgements, and he considers validity to emerge from\nthe evidence of our judgements about such relations. In taking this\napproach, Brentano sets himself apart from the rising\n“mathematical logic” (see PES Appendix x). Instead of\napplying mathematical tools in logic, Brentano believed that logic\nwill advance better by applying the tools of descriptive psychology.\nTo prove his case, Brentano sketches a reform of traditional logic\nbased on his reduction thesis. \nTo begin with, Brentano challenges the logic contained in the\ntraditional square of opposition. This square is made up of the four\ncategorial propositions:  \nAmong others, the following logical relations have been claimed to\nhold among these propositions (see Parsons 2017): \nBrentano rejects almost all these principles. After translating the\ncategorical propositions into existential form, he concludes that (i)\nand (ii) are the only rules correctly identified by traditional logic.\n(iii) to (vi) turn out to be mistaken if S is an empty term.\n(vii) and (viii) are correct principles, but no real conversion of a\njudgement takes place. The converted propositions simply express\none judgement in two ways. This is why Brentano says that his\ntheory  \nleads to nothing less than a complete overthrow, and at the same time,\na reconstruction of elementary logic. Everything then becomes simpler,\nclearer, and more exact. (PES 230 [II 77; SVS 1,\n 251]) \nThe core idea from which Brentano starts is very simple: traditional\nlogic takes the A-form and the I-form to express positive judgements,\nand the E-form and the O-form to express negative ones. According to\nBrentano, that is a confusion. All universal propositions (both A and\nE) express negative judgements and therefore lack existential import,\nwhereas all particular propositions (both I and O) express positive\njudgements with existential import. The reduction thesis fits in\nnicely with this idea, or so it seems. It helps us to correctly\ninterpret the principles of traditional logic and to see which of them\none should retain. In turn, the simplification of the square of\nopposition lends support to the reduction thesis. Everything seems to\nfit\n nicely.[20] \nBut a closer look reveals that this tight fit between Brentano’s\ntheory of judgement and his reform of logic is illusory. With the\nadvance of quantificational logic, it became clear that in order to\ncorrect the square of oppositions in the way in which Brentano\nsuggests, all one needs to do is to use existentially quantified\nformulas instead of categorical propositions (see Church 1947: 56).\nThis observation contains both good and bad news for Brentano. The\ngood news is that Brentano’s logical intuitions find support in\nquantificational logic. The bad news is that his reduction thesis\nceases to play a role in reforming logic. Surely, a quantified formula\nmay express an existential judgement with a non-propositional\ncontent, as Brentano conceived it, but it may also express a judgement\nwith a propositional content. To put it in other words:\nBrentano’s revision of traditional logic can be replicated\nwithout making use of his reduction thesis. \nWhen one reads the first edition of Brentano’s\nPsychology, the reduction thesis appears to be the backbone\nof Brentano’s theory of judgement. But that is in fact not so.\nIn the second edition (1911) Brentano added several appendices, one of\nwhich is entitled “On genuine and fictitious objects” (PES\nappendix ix). Here Brentano recapitulates his theory of judgement and\nturns his back on the reduction thesis. Neither is it true, Brentano\nnow says, that all categorical propositions can be transformed without\nchange of meaning into existential propositions. Nor is it true that\nall judgements are of existential form. \nIt takes a careful reading to fully appreciate the significance of\nBrentano’s change of mind. While the change is dramatic, it does\nnot undermine Brentano’s theory completely. On the contrary. All\nof the following claims still remain in place: in perception we make\nsimple existential judgements by affirming or rejecting an object that\nwe perceive (PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1,\n 413])[21]\n ; categorical propositions can be equivalent with existential\npropositions (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416]; existential propositions\ncan express concepts with a complex subject matter (ibid.). While\nthese claims all remain unchanged, what Brentano gives up is the idea\nof uniformity in the realm of judgement. That is what Brentano’s\nanti-reduction turn comes to: \nWhy did Brentano turn away from a unified theory of judgement?\nConsider first a line of reasoning that Brentano may have used in one\nof his\n lectures:[22] \n[…] since Aristotle, the categorical form has been considered\nas the basic form of judgement, while the other doctrine that the\nbasic form of judgement is the existential form emerged only in recent\ntimes. Yet there can be no doubt that the absolute majority of our\njudgements take the form “A is B”, not the existential\nform, and that the Aristotelian logic made the right decision to\nground its logical developments on that form [of judgement]. This\napparent contradiction we must try to resolve. (LRU 113f., author\ntranslation) \nWhether it was Hillebrand or Brentano who made the point, it is a very\ngood question: Why should one bother to reduce categorical to\nexistential judgements, if most of our judgements are expressed in\ncategorical form? That is to say: Why not take such propositions at\nface value instead of claiming that language disguises the nature of\nour judgements? \nHowever, there is also a good answer to this question. We usually do\nnot make simple judgements, but what Brentano now calls “double\njudgements”, and in order to express such judgements we make use\nof the categorical form. In a double-judgement one affirms the\nexistence of some object and then adds a second judgement that\npresupposes that the first judgement has been made. \nThe novel idea here is that judgements become more complex when they\nare built up in three steps: First one presents an object\nS and acknowledges its existence. Then one presents a property\nP and identifies P with the object S in thought\nthat one has acknowledged, and finally one acknowledges S with\nthe addition of [mit der Zugabe] P. (see PES 295 [II\n164; SVS 1, 413] \nWhat is it to identify P with S in thought? Brentano\ntells us that identification is not a kind of judgement and that the\nresult of an identification is a presentation (PES 317, [II\n 206]).[23]\n A natural way to understand Brentano is to think of identification as\na way of forming complex presentations. Brentano seems mainly to have\nconjunction in mind. We can conjoin the presentation of [warm] and\n[round] to the presentation of [something warm & round].\nConjunction is here a primitive operation on presentations that is\nindependent of\n judgement.[24] \nBut what is the point of this complication? Why does Brentano not\nstick with the simpler two-step procedure that we are already familiar\nwith: first, one combines S and P in an act of\npresentation, prior to making any judgement, and then one acknowledges\n“S-that-is-P” as a complex object? Is there\na special way of identifying S and P which presupposes\nthat the object S has to be acknowledged before such an\nidentification can be\n made?[25] \nDemonstrative judgements are a good case to support Brentano’s\nnew idea: \nA sentence of the form “That thing is P” expresses\na double judgement consisting of (i) an acknowledgement of the object\npicked out by the demonstrative “that thing” and (ii) the\nconjoinng of the idea [That] and [P] (read as “the thing\nwhich is that and P” and (iii) an acknowledgement of the\nthing which is that and P. \nThe formulation of the second judgement must be chosen with care. One\nwould miss Brentano’s point, if one took the second judgement to\nhave as content “that the thing just acknowledged is\nP”. Acknowledging an object and judging that one\nacknowledges it are not the same thing. Therefore, one could make the\nlatter judgement without actually making the first affirmation. That\nis ruled out if one describes the second judgement as affirming of\nthat thing that has been acknowledged, that it is P.\nOnly thus one capture’s Brentano idea that in a double-judgement\nthe second judgement is inseparable from the first: one can affirm\nsomething of an object only after one has actually affirmed its\nexistence (see PES 296 [II 165; SVS 1,\n 414]).[26] \nAnother possible misunderstanding is worth mentioning at this point.\nWe have earlier seen that Brentano, like Frege, distinguishes\npredication from judgement. Now it may seem that Brentano backtracks\non this agreement. On his new theory it seems that predication occurs\nwhen one affirms P of S, which means when one judges of\nS that it is P. But Brentano does not backtrack on this\npoint. He still holds that predication occurs prior to and\nindependently of judging. That is what the three-step process in a\ndouble-judgement guarantees: after acknowledging S, one must\nfirst identify P with S, i.e., predicate P of\nS, before one can judge that S is P, i.e.,\nacknowledge S in conjunction with P. \nLet us now turn to a second line of reasoning with which Brentano\nmotivates his new theory. This line involves a thorough\nreconsideration of the categorical propositions of traditional logic.\nFollowing the model of singular propositions just elaborated, Brentano\nsuggests that propositions of the I-form and the O-form also express\ndouble-judgements: \nLooked at more closely […a judgement of the form “Some\nS is P”] signifies a double judgement\n(Doppelurteil), one part of which acknowledges the\nsubject, and, after the predicate has been identified in presentation\nwith the subject, the other part acknowledges the subject which had\nbeen acknowledged all by itself by the first part, but with this\naddition—which is to say it ascribes to it the predicate\nP. (PES 295 [II 164; SVS 1, 413], translation amended) \nLikewise, the O-form “Some S is not P”: \nconsists of the acknowledgement of S, and this is the basic\nconstituent of the double judgements. The second part relates to it\nand presupposes it in such a way as to be inseparable from it. And\nthis second part is negative: it does not […] ascribe an\nattribute to the S, […] but rather denies one of it.\n(ibid.) \nWhat is the rationale behind these claims? It is obviously no\ncoincidence that Brentano makes them in the context of discussing the\ndistinction between genuine and fictitious objects. This distinction\nbecomes important for him because judgements are intentional mental\nacts, and as such they can be both about real things or about\ninventions of our own minds. These invented or\n“fictitious” objects can be of various kinds. We may\ninvent something in hallucination or by imagining it in our dreams,\nlike a magical island, or we may read about a mythological figure\ndescribed in a story, like Pegasus, or we may invent non-existing\nobjects by our way of speaking or as part of a metaphysical\ntheory. \nIn the present context, Brentano is concerned particularly with\nfictitious objects invented by language or metaphysics: he calls them\n“negatives”, since they are denoted by negative terms\nwhich may occur either in the subject-position or the\npredicate-position of a categorical proposition. Such terms are\nregularly used in common language when one speaks of an\n“unintelligent man”, or an “unattractive\nthing” (PES 298 [II 169; SVS 1,\n 417].[27]\n Or they may be introduced by artificial terms like “a non-white\nthing” or a “non-human”. Brentano denies that such\nterms actually have a denotative function and denote something that\ncould be made an object of judgement. The following consideration may\nbe taken as supporting Brentano’s point: When we count the\nproperties of an object, only genuine properties should count. The\nproperties of a flower may include being red and being a rose; but in\naddition to that the rose does not also have the further properties of\nbeing not-black and being not a daisy. It is of course correct to\nsay that the flower is neither black nor a daisy, but in\nsaying this one does not ascribe negative properties to it. One simply\ndenies that it has the properties of being black and being a daisy.\nThat is why Brentano insists that negation belongs to the mode of\njudgement, not to its content (see\n section 1, claim 5).\n  \nBrentano requires from a theory of judgement that it stays away from\npostulating fictitious entities of any kind. In this respect his\nearlier analysis of propositions of the O-form and the A-form turns\nout to be deficient. His claim about the O-form was that in judging\nthat S is not P, one affirms the existence of an\nS-that-is-not-P. That conflicts with his restriction\nagainst negative properties because when one affirms a complex like\nS-that-is-not-P, one affirms all of its parts (see PES\n208 [II 49; SVS 1, 231]). Thus, in affirming an\nS-that-is-not-P, one would affirm not only the entire\ncomplex, but also both of its “parts”: S and\nnot-P. Note that the problem cannot be solved by joining the\nnegation with the copula “is”, because the copula\nindicates the quality of the judgement and propositions of the O-form\nexpress positive judgements according to Brentano. \nThe way out of this problem is provided by Brentano’s theory of\ndouble-judgement. On the new analysis, judgements of the O-form are\npartially positive and partially negative. They affirm the existence\nof the subject S, and then deny the predicate P of that\nsubject. Now the negation belongs to the mode of judgement, not to its\nsubject matter. \nBrentano considers this new analysis to provide a further insight into\nthe way how language disguises the nature of \njudgement.[28]\nObviously, we cannot read off from the linguistic expression whether a\ngiven proposition expresses a simple or a double-judgement. It takes\nthe scalpel of a philosopher to figure this out. In some cases,\nhowever, no decision may be reached. Then Brentano advises us to\nconsider the proposition to be homonymous. This seems to be the proper\nverdict with propositions of the I-form. They can be interpreted\neither as expressing a simple judgement (“an SP exists”)\nor a double-judgement (“an S exists and that S is\nP”) (see LRU 114, and Hillebrand 1891: 98). \nA further ambiguity of this kind arises in the case of propositions of\nthe E-form (“No S is P”). Their explicit\nnegative quality speaks against an interpretation that takes them to\nexpress a double-judgement like propositions of the\n O-form.[29]\n Brentano therefore ventures another idea what these propositions\nexpress: judgements of higher-order or\n“meta-judgements”: \nAnyone who says, “No S is P” is thinking of\nsomeone judging that “An S is P”, and\ndeclaring that in thinking of him in this way he is thinking of\nsomeone who judges incorrectly. (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416]) \nBrentano here exploits the principle that judgements of the E-form\ncontradict judgements of the I-form. Denying that someone judges\ncorrectly that S is P, therefore means to judge that no\nS is P. Likewise, Brentano exploits the principle that\nA-judgements contradict O-judgements when he says that propositions of\nthe A-form also express meta-judgements:  \nIf the O-form means the double-judgement “There is an S\nand it is not P”, then the proposition “Every\nS is P,” says that anyone who makes both of those\njudgements is judging falsely. (PES 298 [II 168; SVS 1, 416]) \nIn this way, Brentano again manages to satisfy the restriction on\nnegative properties. His earlier theory takes propositions of the\nA-form to express simple existential judgement. Brentano now considers\nthat to be a mistake because it introduces the complex\nS-that-is-not-P, which includes the negative part\n“not-P”. Again, the “not” here cannot be taken\nas an indicator of the quality of the judgement, since one would then\ndeny the existence of an S-that-is P. With propositions\nof the E-form this problem does not arise. In this case, two\ninterpretations are admissible, which makes “No S is\nP” an ambiguous proposition: it either expresses the\nsimple negative existential judgement that no\nS-that-is-P exists, or the higher-order judgement that\nsomeone who accepts an S-that-is-P judges\nincorrectly. \nIn sum, Brentano’s theory of double-judgement shows why a\nreduction of all categorical propositions to existential judgements is\n impossible.[30]\n On the other hand, there is no way for Brentano of reducing\nexistential propositions to propositions expressing double-judgements.\nBrentano is therefore forced to abandon the project of giving a\nuniform treatment of all judgements within the constraints of his\n theory.[31]","contact.mail":"mark.textor@kcl.ac.uk","contact.domain":"kcl.ac.uk"}]
