Typically, rights do\nnot surround the abstract non-physical entity; rather, intellectual\nproperty rights surround the control of physical manifestations or\nexpressions of ideas. Intellectual property law protects a\ncontent-creator’s interest in her ideas by assigning and enforcing\nlegal rights to produce and control physical instantiations of those\nideas.\n\n\n\nLegal protections for intellectual property have a rich history that\nstretches back to ancient Greece and before. As different legal\nsystems matured in protecting intellectual works, there was a\nrefinement of what was being protected within different areas.\nOver the same period several strands of moral justification for\nintellectual property were offered: namely, personality-based,\nutilitarian, and Lockean. Finally, there have been numerous\ncritics of intellectual property and systems of intellectual property\nprotection. This essay will discuss all of these topics, focusing\non Anglo-American and European legal and moral conceptions of\nintellectual property.\n\n\n\nOne of the first known references to intellectual property\nprotection dates from 500 B.C.E., when chefs in the Greek colony of\nSybaris were granted year-long monopolies for creating particular\nculinary delights. There are at least three other notable\nreferences to intellectual property in ancient times—these\ncases are cited in Bruce Bugbee’s formidable work The Genesis of\nAmerican Patent and Copyright Law (Bugbee 1967). In the\nfirst case, Vitruvius (257–180 B.C.E.) is said to have revealed\nintellectual property theft during a literary contest in\nAlexandria. While serving as judge in the contest, Vitruvius\nexposed the false poets who were then tried, convicted, and disgraced\nfor stealing the words and phrases of others. \n\nThe second and third cases also come from Roman times (first century\nC.E.). Although there is no known Roman law protecting\nintellectual property, Roman jurists did discuss the different\nownership interests associated with an intellectual work and how the\nwork was codified—e.g., the ownership of a painting and the\nownership of a table upon which the painting appears. There is also\nreference to literary piracy by the Roman epigrammatist Martial.\nIn this case, Fidentinus is caught reciting the works of Martial\nwithout citing the source. \n\nThese examples are generally thought to be atypical; as far as we know,\nthere were no institutions or conventions of intellectual property\nprotection in Ancient Greece or Rome. From Roman times to the\nbirth of the Florentine Republic, however, there were many franchises,\nprivileges, and royal favors granted surrounding the rights to\nintellectual works. Bugbee distinguishes between franchises or\nroyal favors and systems of intellectual property in the following way:\nfranchises and royal favors restrict access to intellectual works\nalready in the public domain, thus these decrees take something from\nthe people. An inventor, on the other hand, deprives the public\nof nothing that existed prior to the act of invention (Bugbee\n1967). One of the first statutes that protected authors’\nrights was issued by the Republic of Florence on June 19, 1421, to\nFilippo Brunelleschi, a famous architect. This statute not only\nrecognized the rights of authors and inventors to the products of their\nintellectual efforts; it built in an incentive mechanism that became a\nprominent feature of Anglo-American intellectual property protection.\nFor several reasons, including Guild influence, the Florentine patent\nstatute of 1421 issued only the single patent to Brunelleschi. The\nbasis of the first lasting patent institution of intellectual property\nprotection is found in a 1474 statute of the Venetian Republic.\nThis statute appeared 150 years before England’s Statute of Monopolies;\nmoreover, the system was sophisticated. The rights of inventors were\nrecognized, an incentive mechanism was included, compensation for\ninfringement was established, and a term limit on inventors’\nrights was imposed. \n\nAmerican institutions of intellectual property protection are based\non the English system that began with the Statute of Monopolies (1624)\nand the Statute of Anne (1710). The Statute of Monopolies granted\nfourteen-year monopolies to authors and inventors and ended the\npractice of granting rights to “non-original/new” ideas or works\nalready in the public domain. In contrast to patent institutions\nin Europe, literary works remained largely unprotected until the\narrival of Gutenberg’s printing press in the fifteenth century.\nEven then there were few true copyrights granted—most were\ngrants, privileges, and monopolies. \n\nThe Statute of Anne (1710) is considered by scholars to be the first\nstatute of modern copyright. The statute begins: \n\nThe law gave protection to the author by granting fourteen-year\ncopyrights, with a fourteen-year renewal possible if the author was\nstill alive. \n\nIn the landmark English case Miller v. Taylor (1769), the inherent\nrights of authors to control what they produce, independent of statute\nor law, was affirmed. While this case was later overruled in\nDonaldson v. Becket (1774), the practice of recognizing the\nrights of authors had begun. Other European countries, including\nBelgium, Holland, Italy, and Switzerland, followed the example set by\nEngland (Bugbee 1967). Various international treaties like the Berne\nConvention treaty and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\nProperty (TRIPS 1994) agreement have expanded the geographic scope of\nintellectual property protection to include most of the globe. \n\nAt the most practical level, the subject matter of intellectual\nproperty is largely codified in Anglo-American copyright, patent, and\ntrade secret law, as well as in the moral rights granted to authors\nand inventors within the continental European doctrine. Although these\nsystems of property encompass much of what is thought to count as\nintellectual property, they do not map out the entire landscape.  Even\nso, Anglo-American systems of copyright, patent, trade secret, and\ntrademark, along with certain continental doctrines, provide a rich\nstarting point for understanding intellectual property (Moore\n1998a). We will take them up in turn. \n\nThe domain of copyright protection is original works of authorship\nfixed in any tangible medium of expression (17 U.S.C. §102\n(1988)). Works that may be copyrighted include literary, musical,\nartistic, photographic, architectural, and cinematographic works;\nmaps; and computer software. For something to be protected, it must be\n“original”—the work must be the author’s own\nproduction; it cannot be the result of copying (Bleistein v.\nDonaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239 (1903)). A further\nrequirement that limits the domain of what can be copyrighted is that\nthe expression must be “non-utilitarian” or\n“non-functional” in nature. Utilitarian products, or\nproducts that are useful for work, fall, if they fall anywhere, within\nthe domain of patents.  Finally, rights only extend over the actual\nconcrete expression and the derivatives of the expression—not to\nthe abstract ideas themselves For example, Einstein’s Theory of\nRelativity, as expressed in various articles and publications, is not\nprotected under copyright law. Someone else may read these\npublications and express the theory in her own words and even receive\na copyright for her particular expression. Some may find this\ntroubling, but such rights are outside the domain of copyright\nlaw. The individual who copies abstract theories or ideas and expresses them in\nher own words may be guilty of plagiarism, but she cannot be held\nliable for copyright infringement. \n\nThere are five exclusive rights that copyright owners enjoy, and three\nmajor restrictions on the bundle. The five rights are: the right\nto reproduce the work, the right to adapt it or derive other works from\nit, the right to distribute copies of the work, the right to display\nthe work publicly, and the right to perform it publicly. Under\nU.S. copyright law, each of these rights may be individually parsed out\nand sold separately by the copyright owner. All five rights lapse\nafter the lifetime of the author plus 70 years—or in the case\nof works for hire, the term is set at 95 years from publication or 120\nyears from creation, whichever comes first. Aside from limited\nduration (17 U.S.C. §302), the rules of fair use (17 U.S.C.\n§107) and first sale (17 U.S.C. §109(a)) also restrict the\nrights of copyright owners. Although the notion of “fair use” is\nnotoriously hard to spell out, it is a generally recognized principle\nof Anglo-American copyright law that allows anyone to make limited use\nof another’s copyrighted work for such purposes as criticism, comment,\nnews reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. The\n“first sale” rule prevents a copyright holder who has sold\ncopies of a protected work from later interfering with the subsequent\nsale of those copies. In short, the owners of copies can do what\nthey like with their property, short of violating the copyrights\nmentioned above. \n\nAs a modern workaround for the first sale rule, many online content\nproviders, rather than selling a copy of a work, simply offer\nlicensing agreements (through click-wrap, shrink-wrap, etc.) that\nallow only specific uses of protected content. These approaches to\nprotecting intellectual works are relatively new and seemingly build\nupon the copyright systems already in place. For example, by using\nlicensing agreements to guarantee different levels of downstream\naccess, the Creative Commons and Copyleft models seek to expand the\ncommons of thought and expression (Stallman 1997; Lessig 2004).  An\nowner may allow others to build upon a protected work provided that\nthe “new” work is similarly accessible or usable.  Note\nthat the moral bindingness of these contracts/agreements presuppose\nprior entitlements (hinting at the moral justifications offered\nbelow).  For example, if neither party to a Copyleft license owns or\nhas legitimate title to the intellectual work in question, then the\nresulting agreement/license will not be binding. Thus, Creative\nCommons and Copyleft models are actually built upon ownership or\nentitlement claims to intellectual works.  \n\nThe domain or subject matter of patent law is the invention and\ndiscovery of new and useful processes, machines, articles of\nmanufacture, or compositions of matter. There are three types of\npatents recognized by patent law: utility patents, design patents, and\nplant patents. Utility patents protect any new, useful, and nonobvious\nprocess, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, as\nwell as any new and useful improvement thereof. Design patents protect\nany new, original, and ornamental design for an article of\nmanufacture. Finally, the subject matter of a plant patent is any new\nvariety of plant that is asexually propagated (e.g. rose bushes grown\nby cutting pieces of the stem). Patent protection is the strongest\nform of intellectual property protection, in that a twenty-year\nexclusive monopoly is granted to the owner over any expression or\nimplementation of the protected work (35 U.S.C. §101 (1988) and\n35 U.S.C. §154(a)(2)).  \n\nAs with copyright, there are restrictions on the domain of patent\nprotection. The U.S. Patent Act requires usefulness, novelty, and\nnon-obviousness of the subject matter. The usefulness requirement\nis typically deemed satisfied if the invention can accomplish at least\none of its intended purposes. Needless to say, given the expense\nof obtaining a patent, most machines, articles of manufacture, and\nprocesses are useful in this minimal sense. \n\n A\nmore robust requirement on the subject matter of a patent is that the\ninvention defined in the claim for patent protection must be new or\nnovel. There are several categories or events, all defined by\nstatute, that can anticipate and invalidate a claim of a patent (35\nU.S.C. §101 (1988)). In general, the novelty requirement\ninvalidates patent claims if the invention was publicly known before\nthe patent applicant invented it. \n\nIn addition to utility and novelty, the third restriction on\npatentability is non-obviousness. United States patent law requires\nthat the invention not be obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the\nrelevant art at the time the invention was made. A hypothetical\nindividual is constructed and the question is asked, “Would this\ninvention be obvious to an expert in the relevant field?” If it\nwould be obvious to this imaginary individual then the patent claim\nfails the test (35 U.S.C. §103). \n\nIn return for public disclosure and the ensuing dissemination of\ninformation, the patent holder is granted the right to make, use,\nsell, and authorize others to sell the patented item (35\nU.S.C. §154 (1984 and Supp. 1989)). The bundle of rights\nconferred by a patent excludes others from making, using, or selling\nthe invention regardless of independent creation. Like copyright,\npatent rights lapse after a given period of time—20 years for\nutility and plant patents, 14 for design patents. But unlike copyright\nprotection, during their period of applicability these rights preclude\nothers who independently invent the same process or machine from being\nable to patent or market their invention. \n\nThe subject matter of trade secret law is almost unlimited in terms of\nthe content or subject matter that may be protected and typically\nrelies on private measures, rather than state action, to preserve\nexclusivity. “A trade secret is any information that can be used\nin the operation of a business or other enterprise and that is\nsufficiently valuable and secret to afford an actual or potential\neconomic advantage over others” (U.S. Legal Code, The\nRestatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, 1995, §39). The secret\nmay be a formula for a chemical compound; a process of manufacturing,\ntreating, or preserving materials; a pattern for a machine or other\ndevice; or a list of customers. \n\nThe two major restrictions on the domain of trade secrets are the\nrequirements of secrecy and competitive advantage. An\nintellectual work is not a secret if it is generally known within the\nindustry, published in trade journals, reference books, etc., or\nreadily copyable from products on the market. \n\nAlthough trade secret rights have no built-in expiration, they are\nextremely limited in one important respect. Owners of trade secrets\nhave exclusive rights to make use of the secret only as long as the\nsecret is maintained. If the secret is made public by the owner, then\ntrade secret protection lapses and anyone can make use of\nit. Moreover, owners’ rights do not exclude independent\ninvention or discovery. Within the secrecy requirement, owners of\ntrade secrets enjoy management rights and are protected from\nmisappropriation. This latter protection is probably the most\nimportant right granted, given the proliferation of industrial\nespionage and employee theft of intellectual works.  If a trade secret\nis misappropriated and made public, courts may impose injunctive\nrelief and damages. For example, if someone misappropriates a trade\nsecret and publishes it on a website, courts may require deletion and\npayment of fines. \n\nThe domain or subject matter of trademark is, generally speaking, the\ngood will or good name of a company. A trademark is any word,\nname, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, adopted by a\nmanufacturer or merchant to identify her goods and distinguish them\nfrom goods produced by others (15 U.S.C. §1127 (1988)). \n\n A major restriction on what can count as a trademark is whether or\nnot the symbol is used in everyday language. In this respect, owners\nof trademarks do not want their symbols to become too widely used\nbecause once this occurs, the trademark lapses. An example of this\nrestriction eliminating a word from trademark protection is\n“aspirin”—as the word became a part of the common\nculture, rights to exclusively use the trademark lapsed. \n\nOwnership of a trademark confers upon the property holder the right to\nuse a particular mark or symbol and the right to exclude others from\nusing the same (or similar) mark or symbol. The duration of these\nrights is limited only in cases where the mark or symbol ceases to\nrepresent a company or interest, or becomes entrenched as part of the\ncommon language or culture. \n\nOutside of the regimes of copyright, patent, trade secret, and\ntrademark, there is a substantial set of case law that allows\nindividuals to protect mere ideas as personal property. This system of\nproperty is typically called the “law of ideas” (Epstein\n1992). A highly publicized case in this area is Buchwald v.\nParamount Pictures (13 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1497 (Cal. Super. Ct. 1990)),\nconcerning the Eddie Murphy movie Coming to America. Buchwald\napproached Paramount Pictures with a movie idea and it was agreed that\nif a movie was made following Buchwald’s premise he would\nreceive compensation.  Buchwald did not fix his idea, for example by\nwriting it down, and thus copyright infringement did not apply. After\nseveral years of false starts and negotiations Paramount notified\nBuchwald that the movie based on his idea was not going to be\nproduced.  Shortly after this notification, Coming to America\nwas released and credit was given to Eddie Murphy.  Even though the\nmovie supposedly lost money, Buchwald sued and received\ncompensation. \n\nThe law of ideas is typically applied in cases where individuals\nproduce ideas and submit them to corporations expecting to be\ncompensated. In certain cases, when these ideas are used by the\ncorporation (or anyone) without authorization, compensation may be\nrequired. Before concluding that an author has property rights to\nher idea(s), courts require the idea(s) to be novel or original\n(Murray v. National Broadcasting, 844 U.S. F2d 988 (Second\nCir. 1988)) and concrete (Hamilton Nat’l Bank v. Belt (D.C.\nCir. 1953)). Compensation is offered only in cases of\nmisappropriation (Sellers v. American Broadcasting Co. (11th\nCir. 1982)). \n\nArticle 6bis of the Berne Convention articulates the notion\nof “moral rights” that are included in continental\nEuropean intellectual property law. The doctrine protects the personal\nrights of creators, as distinguished from their economic rights, and\nis generally known in France as “droits morals” or\n“moral rights.” These moral rights consist of the right to\ncreate and to publish a work in any form desired, the creator’s right\nto claim the authorship of his work, the right to prevent any\ndeformation, mutilation or other modification thereof, the right to\nwithdraw and destroy the work, the prohibition against excessive\ncriticism, and the prohibition against all other injuries to the\ncreator’s personality (Roeder 1940). \n\nArguments for intellectual property rights have generally taken one of\nthree forms (Hughes 1988; Moore 2008). Personality theorists\nmaintain that intellectual property is an extension of individual\npersonality. Utilitarians ground intellectual property rights in\nsocial progress and incentives to innovate. Lockeans argue that rights\nare justified in relation to labor and merit. To this we add a recent fourth\nstrand of justification (Moore forthcoming). This more recent\njustification analyzes content creation and access as a form of the\nprisoner’s dilemma.  On grounds of prudence and self-interest, we each\nhave reason to adopt and promote institutions that protect\nintellectual works. While each of these strands of justification has\nits weaknesses, there are also strengths unique to each. \n\nPersonality theorists such as Hegel maintain that individuals have\nmoral claims to their own talents, feelings, character traits, and\nexperiences. We are self-owners in this sense. Control over physical\nand intellectual objects is essential for self-actualization—by\nexpanding our selves outward beyond our own minds and mixing these\nselves with tangible and intangible items, we both define ourselves\nand obtain control over our goals and projects. For Hegel, the\nexternal actualization of the human will requires property (Hegel\n1821). Property rights are important in two ways according to this\nview. First, by controlling and manipulating objects, both tangible\nand intangible, our will takes form in the world and we obtain a\nmeasure of freedom. Individuals may use their physical and\nintellectual property rights, for example, to shield their private\nlives from public scrutiny and to facilitate life-long project\npursuit. Second, in some cases our personality becomes fused with an\nobject—thus moral claims to control feelings, character traits,\nand experiences may be expanded to intangible works (Humboldt 1792;\nKohler 1969). \n\nThere are at least four problems with this view (Hughes 1988; Palmer\n2005; Schroeder 2006). First, it is not clear that we own our\nfeelings, character traits, and experiences. While it is true\nthat we have possession of these things or that they are a part of each\nof us, an argument is needed to establish the relevant moral\nclaims. \n\nSecond, even if it could be established that individuals own or have\nmoral claims to their personality, it does not automatically follow\nthat such claims are expanded when personalities become infused in\ntangible or intangible works. Rather than establishing property\nclaims to such works, perhaps we should view this as an abandonment of\npersonality—similar to the sloughing off of hair and skin\ncells. Moreover, misrepresenting an intellectual work (assuming\nthere are no moral rights to these expressions) might change the\nperception of an author’s personality, but it would not in fact\nchange their personality. \n\nThird, assuming that moral claims to personality could be expanded\nto tangible or intangible items, we would still need an argument\njustifying property rights. Personality-based moral claims may\nwarrant nothing more than use rights or prohibitions against\nalteration. Finally, there are many intellectual innovations in\nwhich there is no evidence of a creator’s personality—a\nlist of customers or a new safety-pin design, for instance (Hughes\n1988). Given these challenges, personality-based theories may not\nprovide a strong moral foundation for legal systems of intellectual\nproperty. \n\nEven if we acknowledge the force of these objections, there does seem\nto be something intuitively appealing about personality-based theories\nof intellectual property rights. Suppose, for\nexample, that Mr. Friday buys a painting at a garage sale—a\nlong-lost Crusoe original. Friday takes the painting home and\nalters the painting with a marker, drawing horns and mustaches on the\nfigures in the painting. The additions are so clever and fit so\nnicely into the painting that Friday hangs it in a window on a busy\nstreet. There are at least two ethical worries to consider in\nthis case. First, the alterations by Friday may cause unjustified\neconomic damage to Crusoe. Second, and independent of the\neconomic considerations, Friday’s actions may damage\nCrusoe’s reputation. The integrity of the painting has been\nviolated without the consent of the author, perhaps causing long-term\ndamage to his reputation and community standing. If these claims\nare sensible, then it appears that we are acknowledging\npersonality-based moral “strings” attaching to certain\nintellectual works. By producing intellectual works, authors and\ninventors put themselves on display, so-to-speak, and incur certain\nrisks. Intellectual property rights afford authors and inventors\na measure of control over this risk. To put the point a different\nway, it is the moral claims that attach to personality, reputation, and\nthe physical embodiments of these individual goods that justify legal\nrules covering damage to reputation and certain sorts of economic\nlosses. \n\nMoreover, personality-based theories of intellectual property often\nappeal to other moral considerations. Hegel’s\npersonality-based justification of intellectual property rights\nincluded an incentive-based component as well—he asserts that\nprotecting the sciences promotes them, benefiting society (Hegel\n1821). Perhaps the best way to protect these intuitively\nattractive personality-based claims to intangible works is to adopt a\nmore comprehensive system designed to promote progress and social\nutility. \n\nIn terms of “justification,” modern Anglo-American systems\nof intellectual property are typically modeled as incentive-based and\nutilitarian (Oppenheim 1951; Machlup 1962; Boonin 1989; Hettinger\n1989; Mackaay 1990; Coskery 1993; Palmer 1997; Moore 2001, Lemley\n2015). On this view, a necessary condition for promoting the creation\nof valuable intellectual works is granting limited rights of ownership\nto authors and inventors. Absent certain guarantees, authors and\ninventors might not engage in producing intellectual\nproperty. Although success is not ensured by granting these rights,\nfailure is inevitable if those who incur no investment costs can seize\nand reproduce the intellectual effort of others. Adopting systems of\nprotection like copyright, patent, and trade secret yields an optimal\namount of intellectual works being produced, and a corresponding\noptimal amount of social utility. Coupled with the theoretical claim\nthat society ought to maximize social utility, we arrive at a simple\nyet powerful argument for the protection of intellectual property\nrights. \n\nIt is crucial to note that the issue of whether intellectual property\nprotection does, or does not, sufficiently promote human happiness or\nwell-being is an empirical question. Whether or not, for example,\nintellectual property protection provides an incentive that elicits\nsome optimal output of content creation can be settled only by looking\nto the empirical evidence. Likewise, whether or not intellectual\nproperty protection has the effect of hindering innovation and\ninhibiting the production of novel valuable content can be settled\nonly by empirical analysis. The difficulties involved in obtaining\nsuch evidence suggest that the empirical question will remain debated\nfor some time. Complicating the task is the fact that the efficacy or\nlack thereof of intellectual protection in promoting well-being seems\nto vary from one industry to the next (Lemley 2015). \nOn the positive side there are numerous authors who claim that the\nempirical evidence is now squarely in favor of intellectual property\nprotection. The tragedy of a ‘no-protection rule’ is\nsecrecy, restricted markets, and lost opportunities (Miners &\nStaff 1990; Mossoff 2015; O’Connor 2016). William Fisher notes: \nRobert J. Barro and Xavier Sala-I-Martin note that over the long run\nthe world’s growth rate is largely: Professor Petra Moser makes the following observation: \nMichael Smith and Rahul Telang, argue that piracy harms both producers\nand consumers by undermining the income streams of producers,\nresulting in less content being created (Smith & Telang\n(2016).  \nOn the negative side there are many who argue that “the jury is out”\nor that systems of IP protection actually hinder innovative activity\n(Machlup 1958; Schiff 1971; Palmer 1990; Boldrin & Levine 2007).\nOn patent protection, Fritz Machlup (1958) wrote “No economist, on the\nbasis of present knowledge, could possibly state with certainty that\nthe patent system, as it now operates, confers a net benefit or a net\nloss upon society” (Machlup 1958). Nevertheless, Machlup went on to\nargue that such considerations do not yield the conclusion that we\nshould abolish patent protection. Professors Michele Boldrin and David\nLevine argue that a ‘first mover advantage,’ coupled with\nsecrecy and add-on services, is sufficient as an incentive for\ncreation and discovery (Boldrin & Levine 2007). Tom Palmer made a\nsimilar point seventeen years earlier, arguing that intellectual works\nshould be protected via technological fences and contracts, along with\nbundling in other products and services (Palmer 1990).  \n\nGiven that the utilitarian argument rests on providing incentives, what is\nneeded to critique it are cases that illustrate better ways, or equally\ngood ways, of stimulating production without granting private property\nrights to authors and inventors. It would be better to establish\nequally powerful incentives for the production of intellectual property\nthat did not also require initial restricted use guaranteed by rights\n(Polanyi 1943; Machlup 1962; Hettinger 1989; Waldron 1993; Moore 2003; Wright 1998). \n\nOne alternative to granting intellectual property rights to inventors\nas incentive is government support of intellectual labor (Hettinger\n1989; Calandrillo 1998). This could take the form of\ngovernment-funded research projects, with the results immediately\nbecoming public property. The question becomes: can government\nsupport of intellectual labor provide enough incentive to authors and\ninventors so that an equal or greater amount of intellectual products\nare created compared to what is produced by conferring limited property\nrights? Better results may also be had if fewer intellectual\nworks of higher quality were distributed to more people. \n\nUnlike a government-supported system of intellectual property\nrights, reward models may be able to avoid the problems of allowing\nmonopoly control and restricting access, and at the same time provide\nincentives to innovate (Shavell and Van Ypersele 2001). In this\nmodel, innovators would still burn the midnight oil chasing that pot of\ngold, and governments would not have to decide which projects to fund\nor determine the amount of the rewards before the works’\n“social value” was known. Funds necessary to pay the\nrewards could be drawn from taxes or collecting percentages of the\nprofits of these innovations. Reward models may also avoid the\ndisadvantages of monopoly pricing, and obstructions to further\nadaptation and innovation. \n\nTrade secret protection appears to be the most troubling from a\nutilitarian incentives-based perspective (Hettinger 1989). Given that\nno disclosure is necessary for trade secret protection, promoting\ntrade secrets through incentives yields no reciprocal long-term social\nbenefit. Trade secret protection allows authors and inventors the\nright to slow the dissemination of protected information\nindefinitely—a trade secret necessarily requires secrecy. \n\nThe utilitarian who defends the incentives argument may well agree\nwith many of these criticisms and still maintain that intellectual\nproperty rights, in some form, are justified—the current system\nof protection is better than government support of intellectual\nproperty creation, reward models, or nothing at all.  Additionally,\nmost of the worries surrounding the incentive-based approach appear to\nfocus on problems of implementation.  We could tinker with our system\nof intellectual property, cutting back on some legal protections and\nstrengthening others (Coskery 1993; Moore 2008). Perhaps we could\ninclude more personality-based restrictions on what can be done with\nan intangible work after the first sale, limit the term of copyrights,\npatents, and trade secrets to something more reasonable, and find ways\nto embrace technologies that promote access while protecting\nincentives to innovate. The utilitarian might also remind us of the\ncosts of changing our system of intellectual property. \n\nA different strategy for justifying intellectual property rights begins\nwith the claim that individuals are entitled to control the fruits of\ntheir labor (Locke 1690; Hettinger 1989; Becker 1993; Gordon 1993;\nMoore 1998b; Hughes 1988; Palmer 2005; Himma 2005a,\n2006, 2008, 2013; Merges 2011). In general, the intuition is that the\nperson who clears unowned land, cultivates crops, builds a house, or\ncreates a new invention obtains property rights by engaging in these\nactivities.  Laboring, producing, thinking, and persevering are\nvoluntary, and individuals who engage in these activities are entitled\nto what they produce. Subject to certain restrictions, rights are\ngenerated when individuals mix their labor with an unowned\nobject. Restrictions or limits on acquisition include a labor\nrequirement, a non-waste requirement, and the “enough and as good”\nproviso (Locke 1690). Labor, for Locke, is best understood as metaphor\nfor productive activities needed to sustain and promote human\nflourshing (Mossoff 2012).  The non-waste requirement invalidates a\nproperty claim if the appropriator takes more than she can consume or\nuse without spoilage. Unlike the labor metaphor, spoilage for Locke\nmeans rotting or the destruction of an existing good useful for\nsustaining human life.  Finally, the “enough and as good” proviso is\nbest illustrated by an example Locke gives.  When someone takes a\ndrink of water from a river it is as if he takes nothing at all.  His\nfellows are, all things considered, unaffected by this\nacquisition. \n\nConsider a more formal version of Locke’s famous argument. Individuals\nown their own bodies and labor—i.e., they are self-owners. When\nan individual labors on an unowned object, her labor becomes infused\nin the object and for the most part, the labor and the object cannot\nbe separated. It follows that once a person’s labor is joined with an\nunowned object, assuming that individuals exclusively own their body\nand labor, rights to control are generated. The idea is that there is\nan expansion of rights: we each own our labor and when that labor is\nmixed with objects in the commons, our rights are expanded to include\nthese goods.   \nIn terms of intellectual property, the act of creation or discovery\ntypically takes time, effort, and skill.  Intellectual works\ndon’t spoil like apples, so there is no “non-waste”\nconcerns.  Moreover, the creation or discovery seemingly leaves\n“enough and as good.” Creating a poem, for example, and\nholding it as a secret does not preclude others from creating their\nown poems. \n\nLocke’s argument is not without difficulties. Jeremy\nWaldron (1983) argued that the idea of mixing one’s labor is\nincoherent—actions cannot be mixed with objects. P. J.\nProudhon (1840) argued that if labor was important, the second labor on\nan object should ground a property right in an object as reliably as\nthe first labor. Nozick (1974) asked why labor mixing generated\nproperty rights rather than a loss of labor. Waldron (1983) and\nPerry (1978) have argued that mixing one’s labor with an unowned\nobject should yield more limited rights than rights of full\nownership. Finally, if the skills, tools, and inventions used in\nlaboring are social products, then perhaps individual claims to title\nhave been undermined (Grant 1987; Hettinger 1989). \n\nAmong defenders of Lockean-based arguments for private property, these\nchallenges have not gone unnoticed (Spooner 1855; Schmidtz 1990; Mack\n1990; Simmons 1992; Child 1990; Moore 2001; Mossoff 2012;\nClaeys 2017).  Rather than rehearsing the points and counterpoints,\nconsider a modified version of the Lockean argument—one that\ndoes not so easily fall prey to the objections mentioned above. \nAfter weeks of effort and numerous failures, suppose Ginger comes up\nwith an excellent new recipe for spicy noodles—a recipe\nthat she keeps in her mind and does not write down. Would anyone argue\nthat Ginger does not have at least some minimal moral claim to control\nthe recipe? Suppose that Fred samples some of Ginger’s noodles and\ndesires to purchase the recipe. Is there anything morally suspicious\nwith an agreement between them that grants Fred a limited right to\nuse Ginger’s recipe provided that Fred does not disclose the process?\nAlas, Fred didn’t have to agree to the terms and, no matter how tasty\nthe noodles, he could eat something else or create his own\nrecipe. Arguably, part of the moral weightiness of the agreement\nbetween Ginger and Fred relies on the fact that Ginger holds legitimate\ntitle to the recipe.  In small communities it may even be possible to contract with all\nof one’s fellows securing all or some of the bundle of full ownership.\nIn this sort of example, every single member of the community would be\ndirectly part of the agreement.  Ginger says to her peers, “if you\nwant access to my recipe, then you will have to agree to my right to\nenjoy income” and they reply “but such rights can’t be indefinite\n… we as a community won’t be on the hook for defending this\nagreement indefinitely.”  In the ensuing give-and-take an agreement is\nhammered out.  It is important to note that the moral bindingness of\nsuch an agreement is crucially dependent on the initial set of\nentitlement claims generated by labor, desert, and non-worsening.  If\nGinger, in this case, was not the author of the recipe — suppose\nshe took it from someone else — it is not at all clear that the\nresulting contract would be morally or legally binding. \nMoving from small communities to larger ones a more general form of\nagreement between authors, inventors, and society can be considered.\nIf intellectual works are to be held as anything other than trade\nsecrets, walled off with narrow contracts like non-disclosure\nagreements or non-competition arrangements, there must be a way of\nsecuring access.  Society may purchase access by offering limited\nrights to authors and inventors.  Moreover, if some society does not\noffer this sort of protection, then innovators would likely employ\ntheir talents in other areas or simply move to a society where such\nagreements are recognized.   \nA major concern and limitation on the traditional justifications for\nintellectual property already discussed is that many scholars reject\nthe starting assumptions needed to generate the desired moral\nclaims. For example, non-utilitarians will dismiss the theoretical\nfoundations of utilitarianism. Non-Lockeans will reject Locke’s\ncommitment to self-ownership, natural rights, and individual\nflourishing. Building off of the positive economic analysis mentioned\nin the utilitarian justification for IP discussed above, Moore\n(forthcoming) offers a different sort of argument based on individual\nprudence and self interest. Note that this argument, while concerned\nwith consequences, is not focused on maximizing human well-being or\nflourishing. \nConsider the following case. Imagine that we have two intellectual\nproperty creators, Beren and Lúthien, and two possible outcomes\nfor each. In a single-play prisoner’s dilemma game, each player\ncan copy an intellectual creation of the other, or not. Assume as well\nthat the intellectual works created by Beren and Lúthien are valuable,\ninteresting, or desired. The best case for either player is one where\ntheir own intellectual creation is not copied and yet they get to copy\nthe work of the other player.  This is ‘best’ for the\nplayer who copies and ‘worst’ for the player who\ndoesn’t because, (1) the player who copies gets to enjoy or\nconsume more content compared to the other player, (2) the player who\ncopies still has the option or possibility of obtaining benefit by\nselling, trading, or bartering with the other player, while the\nnon-copier does not enjoy these possibilities — this provides a\nway to recoup research and development costs, and (3) via selling,\ntrading, or bartering the copier may obtain a positional advantage and\nmore capital for future exchanges compared to the non-copier.  Simply\nput, the copier obtains more content and retains more opportunities to\nsell, barter, or exchange compared to the non-copier. If Beren and\nLúthien both refrain from copying each other, then each will avoid the\nworst outcome in terms of recouping investment costs and being at a\npositional disadvantage. Both will also retain the option of buying or\nbartering for the non-copied content the other enjoys.  This payoff is\n‘okay,’ better than ‘worst’ but not as good as\n‘best.’ If both Beren and Lúthien copy each other, then\nboth will get extra content to enjoy and will not be put at a\npositional disadvantage, but each will be denied the possibility of\nrecouping research and development costs. The other player will not\nbuy or barter for content he already possesses. These payoffs mirror a\nprisoner’s dilemma game. \nIn modeling content creation, access, and copying as an iterated\nprisoner’s dilemma between numerous individuals, the problem becomes\neven more salient. It will be individually rational to copy the\nintellectual efforts and creations of others. This will suppress\ninnovation and lead to a sub-optimal result. Based solely on rational\nself-interest and prudence, Moore argues we should adopt institutions\nthat promote innovation and allow inventors the capacity to recoup\nresearch and development costs. If copying becomes too widespread or\nif enforcement mechanisms fail, then we will likely spiral toward the\ncollectively sub-optimal result of suppressing innovation. We see\nsimilar results of an intellectual property prisoner’s dilemma played\nout between nations.  Through the use of sanctions against copying the\nintellectual efforts of others, we give ourselves compelling reasons\nto pursue a collectively superior outcome. \n\nPutting aside the strands of argument that seek to justify moral\nclaims to intangible works and the rather focused problems with these\nviews, there are several general critiques of the rights to control\nintellectual property to consider. \n\nCritics argue that information is not the kind of thing that can be\nowned or possessed and is not something that can be property, as that\nnotion is typically defined.  Information objects, such as numbers and\npropositions are abstract objects, which cannot causally interact with\nmaterial objects, and hence cannot be owned or possessed.  The idea,\nfor example, that one could, in the relevant sense, possess and hence\nown the novel expressed by the book A Tale of Two Cities\nmakes as little sense as the idea that one could possess and hence own\nthe entity denoted by the symbol “2.” Whatever concepts\nmight properly be applied to abstract objects, on this view, the\nconcept of property, according to these theorists, does not.  As a\nconceptual matter, the term “intellectual property,” at\nbest, applies to nothing and, at worst, is incoherent.  This analysis is vulnerable to at least two objections.  First, it\nis not clear that ownership, as a conceptual matter, requires physical\npossession.  One can argue that the essence of ownership consists in a\npower — the power to exclude others from certain behaviors\ninvolving the relevant entity — and not in physical control or\npossession of the entity. Second, the claim that information objects\ncannot be property does not imply that it is illegitimate to grant to\nauthors or content-creators a legal right to exclude others from\nappropriating those objects without their consent.  That some entity E\nis not “property” implies only that it should not be legally protected\nqua property; it does not imply that E should not be protected in very\nsimilar ways.  It might be that such legal rights should be called\nsomething other than “intellectual property rights,” but these rights\ncould be called something else, such as, for example, “intellectual\ncontent rights.” \n\nMany have argued that the non-rivalrous nature of intellectual works\ngrounds a prima facie case against rights to restrict access.\nSince intellectual works are not typically consumed by their use and\ncan be used by many individuals concurrently (making a copy does not\ndeprive anyone of their possessions), we have a strong case against\nmoral and legal intellectual property rights (Kuflik 1989; Hettinger\n1989; Barlow 1997). One reason for the widespread pirating of\nintellectual works is that many people think restricting access to\nthese works is unjustified. Consider a more formal version of\nthis argument: \n\nThe weak point in this argument is the first premise (Moore 2012;\nHimma, 2005b). Consider sensitive personal information.\nMoore argues that it false to claim that just because this information\ncan be used and consumed by many individuals concurrently, a prima\nfacie moral claim to maximal access is established. This argument\napplies as well to snuff films, obscene pornography, information\nrelated to national security, personal financial information, and\nprivate thoughts; each are non-rivalrous, but this fact does not by\nitself generate prima facie moral claims for maximal access and\nuse. Moreover, it is not clear that unauthorized copying does no\nharm to the owner even in cases where the copier would not have\npurchased a copy legitimately (and thus is not denying the owner\neconomic compensation they would otherwise receive). Unauthorized\ncopying creates un-consented to risks that owners must\nshoulder. \n\nHimma points out that, by itself, the claim that consumption of\ninformation is non-rivalrous does not imply that we have a right of any\nkind to those objects. While this certainly provides a reason\nagainst thinking protection of intellectual property is morally\njustified, it does not tell us anything about whether we have a right\nof some sort because it does not contain any information about morally\nrelevant properties of human beings—and the justification of\ngeneral rights-claims necessarily rests on attributions of value that\nimplicitly respond to interests of beings with the appropriate level of\nmoral standing—in our case, our status as persons (Himma\n2005b).  Barlow (1997) argues that information is entitled to moral\nconsideration in virtue of being alive.  On his view, information is a\nform of life with a claim to be free that is grounded in interests and\n“wants” of its own.  As he puts the point, information\nobjects “are life forms in every respect but a basis in the\ncarbon atom.  They self-reproduce, they interact with their\nsurroundings and adapt to them, they mutate, they persist.”\nFurther, these living information objects have some sort of interest\nin being made available to everyone free of charge.  Barlow’s argument can be challenged on a couple of grounds.\nFirst, Himma (2005b) argues that it is simply implausible to think of\nabstract objects as having wants — or even interests. The\nconcept of desire is such that only conscious beings are capable of\nhaving desires; although a conscious being can have subconscious\ndesires, non-sentient entitles are no more accurately characterized as\nhaving desires than as having hopes.  Second, even if information\nobjects had wants or interests, Barlow gives no reason for thinking\nthat they have a desire to, or interest in being made freely available\nto all.  Certainly, the claim that being made freely available to all\nsomehow benefits information objects needs an argument if for no other\nreason than that it is counterintuitive. \nAccording to some, promoting intellectual property rights is\ninconsistent with our commitment to freedom of thought and speech\n(Nimmer 1970; Hettinger 1989; Waldron 1993). Closely associated with\nthis argument is the position that individuals have a right to\nknowledge and intellectual property institutions interfere with this\nbasic right. Hettinger argues that intellectual property\n“restricts methods of acquiring ideas (as do trade secrets), it\nrestricts the use of ideas (as do patents), and it restricts the\nexpression of ideas (as do copyrights)—restrictions undesirable\nfor a number of reasons” (Hettinger 1989). Hettinger singles out\ntrade secrets as the most troublesome because, unlike patents and\ncopyrights, they do not require disclosure. \n\nThree sorts of replies have been offered to this kind of worry (Himma\n2006; Moore 2012). While we focus on the free speech argument against\nintellectual property, right to know arguments fall prey to similar\nobjections. The first objection notes that it is the incentives found\nin providing limited protection that fosters the creation and\ndissemination of information—a system of intellectual property\nprotection may cause restricted access in the short run, but overall,\nthe commons of thought and expression is enhanced.  Second, it is not at all clear that free speech is so presumptively\nweighty that it nearly always trumps other values. Shouting at someone\nover a bullhorn all day is not something we would countenance as\nprotected free speech. Hate speech, obscene\nexpressions, sexual harassment, and broadcasting private medical\ninformation about others are each examples of speech that we are\nwilling to limit for various reasons—perhaps intellectual\nproperty rights can be viewed in this light. Finally, consider the contentious, yet established, idea/expression\nrule of copyright.  Copyright only applies to fixed expressions, not\nto the ideas that may make up a fixed expression. For example, someone\nmay read Darwin’s original writings on evolution, express these ideas\nin her own words, and obtain a copyright in the new expression.  This\nindividual may be guilty of plagiarism, but so long as her expressions\nare not copied from Darwin’s original or substantially similar to the\noriginal, she can obtain a copyright. Copyrights and patents require\ndisclosure and thus the ideas that make up these intellectual works\nmay be discussed and analyzed. \n\nAccording to this view, information is a social product and enforcing\naccess restrictions unduly benefits authors and inventors.\nIndividuals are raised in societies that endow them with knowledge\nwhich these individuals then use to create intellectual works of all\nkinds. On this view the building blocks of intellectual\nworks—knowledge—is a social product. Individuals should\nnot have exclusive and perpetual ownership of the works that they\ncreate because these works are built upon the shared knowledge of\nsociety. Allowing rights to intellectual works would be similar to\ngranting ownership to the individual who placed the last brick in a\npublic works dam. The dam is a social product, built up by the efforts\nof hundreds, and knowledge, upon which all intellectual works are\nbuilt, is built up in a similar fashion (Proudhon 1840; Grant 1987;\nShapiro 1991; Simmons 1992, Boyle 1997). \n\nBeyond challenging whether the notion of “society” employed\nin this view is clear enough to carry the weight that the argument\ndemands, critics have questioned the view that societies can be\nowed something or that they can own or\ndeserve something (Spooner 1855; Nozick 1974; Moore\n2012). Lysander Spooner writes: \nMoore charges that defenders of this sort of argument fail to see that\nit may prove too much. \nFinally, even if a defender of this view can justify societal\nownership of general pools of knowledge and information, it could be\nargued that we have already paid for the use of this collective wisdom\nwhen we pay for education and the like. \n\nCoy (2007) argues is that, in a competitive market, the cost of\ninformation should properly reflect the cost of making it available to\nusers. On this line of analysis, while the cost of making publishing\ninformation in traditional material media like books might be\nsufficiently high to justify charging users a price for it, the cost\n(per user) of making information available on digital media approaches\nzero as the number of users grow larger.  For example, there might be\nsome fixed cost involved in making information available on a website,\nbut no additional cost is required beyond that to make that content\navailable to any number of users; the more users appropriating the\ninformation, the lower the cost of making it available to any\nparticular user.  Thus, the argument concludes, it would be unfair to\ncharge users a fee for appropriating any piece of (digital)\ninformation; information should be free (or nearly free) so as to\nreflect its dissemination costs. \nThere are two problems with this argument.  First, if one accepts the\nlegitimacy of free enterprise, as appears to be presupposed by the\nabove argument, then what is a fair price will be determined by the\nvoluntary interactions of buyers and sellers in a competitive market:\nthe fair price is that which is set by the contractual transactions of\nfree, prudentially-rational buyers and sellers.  If buyers in a\ncompetitive market are willing to pay a price for digital information\nthat is significantly higher than the seller’s marginal cost, then\nthat price can be presumed fair.  Second, the argument overlooks the\nfact that the fixed costs associated with producing and distributing\nintellectual content can be quite high.  For example, the Disney\nCompany spent more than $200 million in making the film John Carter.\nIf one assumes that a fair price is such as to allow the producer to\nrecover the fixed development costs associated with producing and\ndistributing intellectual content, this would entail that it is fair\nfor content producers to charge a price that is sufficiently above the\nmarginal costs to allow them to recover these fixed costs.

Typically, rights do\nnot surround the abstract non-physical entity; rather, intellectual\nproperty rights surround the control of physical manifestations or\nexpressions of ideas. Intellectual property law protects a\ncontent-creator’s interest in her ideas by assigning and enforcing\nlegal rights to produce and control physical instantiations of those\nideas.\n\n\n\nLegal protections for intellectual property have a rich history that\nstretches back to ancient Greece and before. As different legal\nsystems matured in protecting intellectual works, there was a\nrefinement of what was being protected within different areas.\nOver the same period several strands of moral justification for\nintellectual property were offered: namely, personality-based,\nutilitarian, and Lockean. Finally, there have been numerous\ncritics of intellectual property and systems of intellectual property\nprotection. This essay will discuss all of these topics, focusing\non Anglo-American and European legal and moral conceptions of\nintellectual property.\n\n\n\nOne of the first known references to intellectual property\nprotection dates from 500 B.C.E., when chefs in the Greek colony of\nSybaris were granted year-long monopolies for creating particular\nculinary delights. There are at least three other notable\nreferences to intellectual property in ancient times—these\ncases are cited in Bruce Bugbee’s formidable work The Genesis of\nAmerican Patent and Copyright Law (Bugbee 1967). In the\nfirst case, Vitruvius (257–180 B.C.E.) is said to have revealed\nintellectual property theft during a literary contest in\nAlexandria. While serving as judge in the contest, Vitruvius\nexposed the false poets who were then tried, convicted, and disgraced\nfor stealing the words and phrases of others. \n\nThe second and third cases also come from Roman times (first century\nC.E.). Although there is no known Roman law protecting\nintellectual property, Roman jurists did discuss the different\nownership interests associated with an intellectual work and how the\nwork was codified—e.g., the ownership of a painting and the\nownership of a table upon which the painting appears. There is also\nreference to literary piracy by the Roman epigrammatist Martial.\nIn this case, Fidentinus is caught reciting the works of Martial\nwithout citing the source. \n\nThese examples are generally thought to be atypical; as far as we know,\nthere were no institutions or conventions of intellectual property\nprotection in Ancient Greece or Rome. From Roman times to the\nbirth of the Florentine Republic, however, there were many franchises,\nprivileges, and royal favors granted surrounding the rights to\nintellectual works. Bugbee distinguishes between franchises or\nroyal favors and systems of intellectual property in the following way:\nfranchises and royal favors restrict access to intellectual works\nalready in the public domain, thus these decrees take something from\nthe people. An inventor, on the other hand, deprives the public\nof nothing that existed prior to the act of invention (Bugbee\n1967). One of the first statutes that protected authors’\nrights was issued by the Republic of Florence on June 19, 1421, to\nFilippo Brunelleschi, a famous architect. This statute not only\nrecognized the rights of authors and inventors to the products of their\nintellectual efforts; it built in an incentive mechanism that became a\nprominent feature of Anglo-American intellectual property protection.\nFor several reasons, including Guild influence, the Florentine patent\nstatute of 1421 issued only the single patent to Brunelleschi. The\nbasis of the first lasting patent institution of intellectual property\nprotection is found in a 1474 statute of the Venetian Republic.\nThis statute appeared 150 years before England’s Statute of Monopolies;\nmoreover, the system was sophisticated. The rights of inventors were\nrecognized, an incentive mechanism was included, compensation for\ninfringement was established, and a term limit on inventors’\nrights was imposed. \n\nAmerican institutions of intellectual property protection are based\non the English system that began with the Statute of Monopolies (1624)\nand the Statute of Anne (1710). The Statute of Monopolies granted\nfourteen-year monopolies to authors and inventors and ended the\npractice of granting rights to “non-original/new” ideas or works\nalready in the public domain. In contrast to patent institutions\nin Europe, literary works remained largely unprotected until the\narrival of Gutenberg’s printing press in the fifteenth century.\nEven then there were few true copyrights granted—most were\ngrants, privileges, and monopolies. \n\nThe Statute of Anne (1710) is considered by scholars to be the first\nstatute of modern copyright. The statute begins: \n\nThe law gave protection to the author by granting fourteen-year\ncopyrights, with a fourteen-year renewal possible if the author was\nstill alive. \n\nIn the landmark English case Miller v. Taylor (1769), the inherent\nrights of authors to control what they produce, independent of statute\nor law, was affirmed. While this case was later overruled in\nDonaldson v. Becket (1774), the practice of recognizing the\nrights of authors had begun. Other European countries, including\nBelgium, Holland, Italy, and Switzerland, followed the example set by\nEngland (Bugbee 1967). Various international treaties like the Berne\nConvention treaty and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\nProperty (TRIPS 1994) agreement have expanded the geographic scope of\nintellectual property protection to include most of the globe. \n\nAt the most practical level, the subject matter of intellectual\nproperty is largely codified in Anglo-American copyright, patent, and\ntrade secret law, as well as in the moral rights granted to authors\nand inventors within the continental European doctrine. Although these\nsystems of property encompass much of what is thought to count as\nintellectual property, they do not map out the entire landscape.  Even\nso, Anglo-American systems of copyright, patent, trade secret, and\ntrademark, along with certain continental doctrines, provide a rich\nstarting point for understanding intellectual property (Moore\n1998a). We will take them up in turn. \n\nThe domain of copyright protection is original works of authorship\nfixed in any tangible medium of expression (17 U.S.C. §102\n(1988)). Works that may be copyrighted include literary, musical,\nartistic, photographic, architectural, and cinematographic works;\nmaps; and computer software. For something to be protected, it must be\n“original”—the work must be the author’s own\nproduction; it cannot be the result of copying (Bleistein v.\nDonaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239 (1903)). A further\nrequirement that limits the domain of what can be copyrighted is that\nthe expression must be “non-utilitarian” or\n“non-functional” in nature. Utilitarian products, or\nproducts that are useful for work, fall, if they fall anywhere, within\nthe domain of patents.  Finally, rights only extend over the actual\nconcrete expression and the derivatives of the expression—not to\nthe abstract ideas themselves For example, Einstein’s Theory of\nRelativity, as expressed in various articles and publications, is not\nprotected under copyright law. Someone else may read these\npublications and express the theory in her own words and even receive\na copyright for her particular expression. Some may find this\ntroubling, but such rights are outside the domain of copyright\nlaw. The individual who copies abstract theories or ideas and expresses them in\nher own words may be guilty of plagiarism, but she cannot be held\nliable for copyright infringement. \n\nThere are five exclusive rights that copyright owners enjoy, and three\nmajor restrictions on the bundle. The five rights are: the right\nto reproduce the work, the right to adapt it or derive other works from\nit, the right to distribute copies of the work, the right to display\nthe work publicly, and the right to perform it publicly. Under\nU.S. copyright law, each of these rights may be individually parsed out\nand sold separately by the copyright owner. All five rights lapse\nafter the lifetime of the author plus 70 years—or in the case\nof works for hire, the term is set at 95 years from publication or 120\nyears from creation, whichever comes first. Aside from limited\nduration (17 U.S.C. §302), the rules of fair use (17 U.S.C.\n§107) and first sale (17 U.S.C. §109(a)) also restrict the\nrights of copyright owners. Although the notion of “fair use” is\nnotoriously hard to spell out, it is a generally recognized principle\nof Anglo-American copyright law that allows anyone to make limited use\nof another’s copyrighted work for such purposes as criticism, comment,\nnews reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. The\n“first sale” rule prevents a copyright holder who has sold\ncopies of a protected work from later interfering with the subsequent\nsale of those copies. In short, the owners of copies can do what\nthey like with their property, short of violating the copyrights\nmentioned above. \n\nAs a modern workaround for the first sale rule, many online content\nproviders, rather than selling a copy of a work, simply offer\nlicensing agreements (through click-wrap, shrink-wrap, etc.) that\nallow only specific uses of protected content. These approaches to\nprotecting intellectual works are relatively new and seemingly build\nupon the copyright systems already in place. For example, by using\nlicensing agreements to guarantee different levels of downstream\naccess, the Creative Commons and Copyleft models seek to expand the\ncommons of thought and expression (Stallman 1997; Lessig 2004).  An\nowner may allow others to build upon a protected work provided that\nthe “new” work is similarly accessible or usable.  Note\nthat the moral bindingness of these contracts/agreements presuppose\nprior entitlements (hinting at the moral justifications offered\nbelow).  For example, if neither party to a Copyleft license owns or\nhas legitimate title to the intellectual work in question, then the\nresulting agreement/license will not be binding. Thus, Creative\nCommons and Copyleft models are actually built upon ownership or\nentitlement claims to intellectual works.  \n\nThe domain or subject matter of patent law is the invention and\ndiscovery of new and useful processes, machines, articles of\nmanufacture, or compositions of matter. There are three types of\npatents recognized by patent law: utility patents, design patents, and\nplant patents. Utility patents protect any new, useful, and nonobvious\nprocess, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, as\nwell as any new and useful improvement thereof. Design patents protect\nany new, original, and ornamental design for an article of\nmanufacture. Finally, the subject matter of a plant patent is any new\nvariety of plant that is asexually propagated (e.g. rose bushes grown\nby cutting pieces of the stem). Patent protection is the strongest\nform of intellectual property protection, in that a twenty-year\nexclusive monopoly is granted to the owner over any expression or\nimplementation of the protected work (35 U.S.C. §101 (1988) and\n35 U.S.C. §154(a)(2)).  \n\nAs with copyright, there are restrictions on the domain of patent\nprotection. The U.S. Patent Act requires usefulness, novelty, and\nnon-obviousness of the subject matter. The usefulness requirement\nis typically deemed satisfied if the invention can accomplish at least\none of its intended purposes. Needless to say, given the expense\nof obtaining a patent, most machines, articles of manufacture, and\nprocesses are useful in this minimal sense. \n\n A\nmore robust requirement on the subject matter of a patent is that the\ninvention defined in the claim for patent protection must be new or\nnovel. There are several categories or events, all defined by\nstatute, that can anticipate and invalidate a claim of a patent (35\nU.S.C. §101 (1988)). In general, the novelty requirement\ninvalidates patent claims if the invention was publicly known before\nthe patent applicant invented it. \n\nIn addition to utility and novelty, the third restriction on\npatentability is non-obviousness. United States patent law requires\nthat the invention not be obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the\nrelevant art at the time the invention was made. A hypothetical\nindividual is constructed and the question is asked, “Would this\ninvention be obvious to an expert in the relevant field?” If it\nwould be obvious to this imaginary individual then the patent claim\nfails the test (35 U.S.C. §103). \n\nIn return for public disclosure and the ensuing dissemination of\ninformation, the patent holder is granted the right to make, use,\nsell, and authorize others to sell the patented item (35\nU.S.C. §154 (1984 and Supp. 1989)). The bundle of rights\nconferred by a patent excludes others from making, using, or selling\nthe invention regardless of independent creation. Like copyright,\npatent rights lapse after a given period of time—20 years for\nutility and plant patents, 14 for design patents. But unlike copyright\nprotection, during their period of applicability these rights preclude\nothers who independently invent the same process or machine from being\nable to patent or market their invention. \n\nThe subject matter of trade secret law is almost unlimited in terms of\nthe content or subject matter that may be protected and typically\nrelies on private measures, rather than state action, to preserve\nexclusivity. “A trade secret is any information that can be used\nin the operation of a business or other enterprise and that is\nsufficiently valuable and secret to afford an actual or potential\neconomic advantage over others” (U.S. Legal Code, The\nRestatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, 1995, §39). The secret\nmay be a formula for a chemical compound; a process of manufacturing,\ntreating, or preserving materials; a pattern for a machine or other\ndevice; or a list of customers. \n\nThe two major restrictions on the domain of trade secrets are the\nrequirements of secrecy and competitive advantage. An\nintellectual work is not a secret if it is generally known within the\nindustry, published in trade journals, reference books, etc., or\nreadily copyable from products on the market. \n\nAlthough trade secret rights have no built-in expiration, they are\nextremely limited in one important respect. Owners of trade secrets\nhave exclusive rights to make use of the secret only as long as the\nsecret is maintained. If the secret is made public by the owner, then\ntrade secret protection lapses and anyone can make use of\nit. Moreover, owners’ rights do not exclude independent\ninvention or discovery. Within the secrecy requirement, owners of\ntrade secrets enjoy management rights and are protected from\nmisappropriation. This latter protection is probably the most\nimportant right granted, given the proliferation of industrial\nespionage and employee theft of intellectual works.  If a trade secret\nis misappropriated and made public, courts may impose injunctive\nrelief and damages. For example, if someone misappropriates a trade\nsecret and publishes it on a website, courts may require deletion and\npayment of fines. \n\nThe domain or subject matter of trademark is, generally speaking, the\ngood will or good name of a company. A trademark is any word,\nname, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, adopted by a\nmanufacturer or merchant to identify her goods and distinguish them\nfrom goods produced by others (15 U.S.C. §1127 (1988)). \n\n A major restriction on what can count as a trademark is whether or\nnot the symbol is used in everyday language. In this respect, owners\nof trademarks do not want their symbols to become too widely used\nbecause once this occurs, the trademark lapses. An example of this\nrestriction eliminating a word from trademark protection is\n“aspirin”—as the word became a part of the common\nculture, rights to exclusively use the trademark lapsed. \n\nOwnership of a trademark confers upon the property holder the right to\nuse a particular mark or symbol and the right to exclude others from\nusing the same (or similar) mark or symbol. The duration of these\nrights is limited only in cases where the mark or symbol ceases to\nrepresent a company or interest, or becomes entrenched as part of the\ncommon language or culture. \n\nOutside of the regimes of copyright, patent, trade secret, and\ntrademark, there is a substantial set of case law that allows\nindividuals to protect mere ideas as personal property. This system of\nproperty is typically called the “law of ideas” (Epstein\n1992). A highly publicized case in this area is Buchwald v.\nParamount Pictures (13 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1497 (Cal. Super. Ct. 1990)),\nconcerning the Eddie Murphy movie Coming to America. Buchwald\napproached Paramount Pictures with a movie idea and it was agreed that\nif a movie was made following Buchwald’s premise he would\nreceive compensation.  Buchwald did not fix his idea, for example by\nwriting it down, and thus copyright infringement did not apply. After\nseveral years of false starts and negotiations Paramount notified\nBuchwald that the movie based on his idea was not going to be\nproduced.  Shortly after this notification, Coming to America\nwas released and credit was given to Eddie Murphy.  Even though the\nmovie supposedly lost money, Buchwald sued and received\ncompensation. \n\nThe law of ideas is typically applied in cases where individuals\nproduce ideas and submit them to corporations expecting to be\ncompensated. In certain cases, when these ideas are used by the\ncorporation (or anyone) without authorization, compensation may be\nrequired. Before concluding that an author has property rights to\nher idea(s), courts require the idea(s) to be novel or original\n(Murray v. National Broadcasting, 844 U.S. F2d 988 (Second\nCir. 1988)) and concrete (Hamilton Nat’l Bank v. Belt (D.C.\nCir. 1953)). Compensation is offered only in cases of\nmisappropriation (Sellers v. American Broadcasting Co. (11th\nCir. 1982)). \n\nArticle 6bis of the Berne Convention articulates the notion\nof “moral rights” that are included in continental\nEuropean intellectual property law. The doctrine protects the personal\nrights of creators, as distinguished from their economic rights, and\nis generally known in France as “droits morals” or\n“moral rights.” These moral rights consist of the right to\ncreate and to publish a work in any form desired, the creator’s right\nto claim the authorship of his work, the right to prevent any\ndeformation, mutilation or other modification thereof, the right to\nwithdraw and destroy the work, the prohibition against excessive\ncriticism, and the prohibition against all other injuries to the\ncreator’s personality (Roeder 1940). \n\nArguments for intellectual property rights have generally taken one of\nthree forms (Hughes 1988; Moore 2008). Personality theorists\nmaintain that intellectual property is an extension of individual\npersonality. Utilitarians ground intellectual property rights in\nsocial progress and incentives to innovate. Lockeans argue that rights\nare justified in relation to labor and merit. To this we add a recent fourth\nstrand of justification (Moore forthcoming). This more recent\njustification analyzes content creation and access as a form of the\nprisoner’s dilemma.  On grounds of prudence and self-interest, we each\nhave reason to adopt and promote institutions that protect\nintellectual works. While each of these strands of justification has\nits weaknesses, there are also strengths unique to each. \n\nPersonality theorists such as Hegel maintain that individuals have\nmoral claims to their own talents, feelings, character traits, and\nexperiences. We are self-owners in this sense. Control over physical\nand intellectual objects is essential for self-actualization—by\nexpanding our selves outward beyond our own minds and mixing these\nselves with tangible and intangible items, we both define ourselves\nand obtain control over our goals and projects. For Hegel, the\nexternal actualization of the human will requires property (Hegel\n1821). Property rights are important in two ways according to this\nview. First, by controlling and manipulating objects, both tangible\nand intangible, our will takes form in the world and we obtain a\nmeasure of freedom. Individuals may use their physical and\nintellectual property rights, for example, to shield their private\nlives from public scrutiny and to facilitate life-long project\npursuit. Second, in some cases our personality becomes fused with an\nobject—thus moral claims to control feelings, character traits,\nand experiences may be expanded to intangible works (Humboldt 1792;\nKohler 1969). \n\nThere are at least four problems with this view (Hughes 1988; Palmer\n2005; Schroeder 2006). First, it is not clear that we own our\nfeelings, character traits, and experiences. While it is true\nthat we have possession of these things or that they are a part of each\nof us, an argument is needed to establish the relevant moral\nclaims. \n\nSecond, even if it could be established that individuals own or have\nmoral claims to their personality, it does not automatically follow\nthat such claims are expanded when personalities become infused in\ntangible or intangible works. Rather than establishing property\nclaims to such works, perhaps we should view this as an abandonment of\npersonality—similar to the sloughing off of hair and skin\ncells. Moreover, misrepresenting an intellectual work (assuming\nthere are no moral rights to these expressions) might change the\nperception of an author’s personality, but it would not in fact\nchange their personality. \n\nThird, assuming that moral claims to personality could be expanded\nto tangible or intangible items, we would still need an argument\njustifying property rights. Personality-based moral claims may\nwarrant nothing more than use rights or prohibitions against\nalteration. Finally, there are many intellectual innovations in\nwhich there is no evidence of a creator’s personality—a\nlist of customers or a new safety-pin design, for instance (Hughes\n1988). Given these challenges, personality-based theories may not\nprovide a strong moral foundation for legal systems of intellectual\nproperty. \n\nEven if we acknowledge the force of these objections, there does seem\nto be something intuitively appealing about personality-based theories\nof intellectual property rights. Suppose, for\nexample, that Mr. Friday buys a painting at a garage sale—a\nlong-lost Crusoe original. Friday takes the painting home and\nalters the painting with a marker, drawing horns and mustaches on the\nfigures in the painting. The additions are so clever and fit so\nnicely into the painting that Friday hangs it in a window on a busy\nstreet. There are at least two ethical worries to consider in\nthis case. First, the alterations by Friday may cause unjustified\neconomic damage to Crusoe. Second, and independent of the\neconomic considerations, Friday’s actions may damage\nCrusoe’s reputation. The integrity of the painting has been\nviolated without the consent of the author, perhaps causing long-term\ndamage to his reputation and community standing. If these claims\nare sensible, then it appears that we are acknowledging\npersonality-based moral “strings” attaching to certain\nintellectual works. By producing intellectual works, authors and\ninventors put themselves on display, so-to-speak, and incur certain\nrisks. Intellectual property rights afford authors and inventors\na measure of control over this risk. To put the point a different\nway, it is the moral claims that attach to personality, reputation, and\nthe physical embodiments of these individual goods that justify legal\nrules covering damage to reputation and certain sorts of economic\nlosses. \n\nMoreover, personality-based theories of intellectual property often\nappeal to other moral considerations. Hegel’s\npersonality-based justification of intellectual property rights\nincluded an incentive-based component as well—he asserts that\nprotecting the sciences promotes them, benefiting society (Hegel\n1821). Perhaps the best way to protect these intuitively\nattractive personality-based claims to intangible works is to adopt a\nmore comprehensive system designed to promote progress and social\nutility. \n\nIn terms of “justification,” modern Anglo-American systems\nof intellectual property are typically modeled as incentive-based and\nutilitarian (Oppenheim 1951; Machlup 1962; Boonin 1989; Hettinger\n1989; Mackaay 1990; Coskery 1993; Palmer 1997; Moore 2001, Lemley\n2015). On this view, a necessary condition for promoting the creation\nof valuable intellectual works is granting limited rights of ownership\nto authors and inventors. Absent certain guarantees, authors and\ninventors might not engage in producing intellectual\nproperty. Although success is not ensured by granting these rights,\nfailure is inevitable if those who incur no investment costs can seize\nand reproduce the intellectual effort of others. Adopting systems of\nprotection like copyright, patent, and trade secret yields an optimal\namount of intellectual works being produced, and a corresponding\noptimal amount of social utility. Coupled with the theoretical claim\nthat society ought to maximize social utility, we arrive at a simple\nyet powerful argument for the protection of intellectual property\nrights. \n\nIt is crucial to note that the issue of whether intellectual property\nprotection does, or does not, sufficiently promote human happiness or\nwell-being is an empirical question. Whether or not, for example,\nintellectual property protection provides an incentive that elicits\nsome optimal output of content creation can be settled only by looking\nto the empirical evidence. Likewise, whether or not intellectual\nproperty protection has the effect of hindering innovation and\ninhibiting the production of novel valuable content can be settled\nonly by empirical analysis. The difficulties involved in obtaining\nsuch evidence suggest that the empirical question will remain debated\nfor some time. Complicating the task is the fact that the efficacy or\nlack thereof of intellectual protection in promoting well-being seems\nto vary from one industry to the next (Lemley 2015). \nOn the positive side there are numerous authors who claim that the\nempirical evidence is now squarely in favor of intellectual property\nprotection. The tragedy of a ‘no-protection rule’ is\nsecrecy, restricted markets, and lost opportunities (Miners &\nStaff 1990; Mossoff 2015; O’Connor 2016). William Fisher notes: \nRobert J. Barro and Xavier Sala-I-Martin note that over the long run\nthe world’s growth rate is largely: Professor Petra Moser makes the following observation: \nMichael Smith and Rahul Telang, argue that piracy harms both producers\nand consumers by undermining the income streams of producers,\nresulting in less content being created (Smith & Telang\n(2016).  \nOn the negative side there are many who argue that “the jury is out”\nor that systems of IP protection actually hinder innovative activity\n(Machlup 1958; Schiff 1971; Palmer 1990; Boldrin & Levine 2007).\nOn patent protection, Fritz Machlup (1958) wrote “No economist, on the\nbasis of present knowledge, could possibly state with certainty that\nthe patent system, as it now operates, confers a net benefit or a net\nloss upon society” (Machlup 1958). Nevertheless, Machlup went on to\nargue that such considerations do not yield the conclusion that we\nshould abolish patent protection. Professors Michele Boldrin and David\nLevine argue that a ‘first mover advantage,’ coupled with\nsecrecy and add-on services, is sufficient as an incentive for\ncreation and discovery (Boldrin & Levine 2007). Tom Palmer made a\nsimilar point seventeen years earlier, arguing that intellectual works\nshould be protected via technological fences and contracts, along with\nbundling in other products and services (Palmer 1990).  \n\nGiven that the utilitarian argument rests on providing incentives, what is\nneeded to critique it are cases that illustrate better ways, or equally\ngood ways, of stimulating production without granting private property\nrights to authors and inventors. It would be better to establish\nequally powerful incentives for the production of intellectual property\nthat did not also require initial restricted use guaranteed by rights\n(Polanyi 1943; Machlup 1962; Hettinger 1989; Waldron 1993; Moore 2003; Wright 1998). \n\nOne alternative to granting intellectual property rights to inventors\nas incentive is government support of intellectual labor (Hettinger\n1989; Calandrillo 1998). This could take the form of\ngovernment-funded research projects, with the results immediately\nbecoming public property. The question becomes: can government\nsupport of intellectual labor provide enough incentive to authors and\ninventors so that an equal or greater amount of intellectual products\nare created compared to what is produced by conferring limited property\nrights? Better results may also be had if fewer intellectual\nworks of higher quality were distributed to more people. \n\nUnlike a government-supported system of intellectual property\nrights, reward models may be able to avoid the problems of allowing\nmonopoly control and restricting access, and at the same time provide\nincentives to innovate (Shavell and Van Ypersele 2001). In this\nmodel, innovators would still burn the midnight oil chasing that pot of\ngold, and governments would not have to decide which projects to fund\nor determine the amount of the rewards before the works’\n“social value” was known. Funds necessary to pay the\nrewards could be drawn from taxes or collecting percentages of the\nprofits of these innovations. Reward models may also avoid the\ndisadvantages of monopoly pricing, and obstructions to further\nadaptation and innovation. \n\nTrade secret protection appears to be the most troubling from a\nutilitarian incentives-based perspective (Hettinger 1989). Given that\nno disclosure is necessary for trade secret protection, promoting\ntrade secrets through incentives yields no reciprocal long-term social\nbenefit. Trade secret protection allows authors and inventors the\nright to slow the dissemination of protected information\nindefinitely—a trade secret necessarily requires secrecy. \n\nThe utilitarian who defends the incentives argument may well agree\nwith many of these criticisms and still maintain that intellectual\nproperty rights, in some form, are justified—the current system\nof protection is better than government support of intellectual\nproperty creation, reward models, or nothing at all.  Additionally,\nmost of the worries surrounding the incentive-based approach appear to\nfocus on problems of implementation.  We could tinker with our system\nof intellectual property, cutting back on some legal protections and\nstrengthening others (Coskery 1993; Moore 2008). Perhaps we could\ninclude more personality-based restrictions on what can be done with\nan intangible work after the first sale, limit the term of copyrights,\npatents, and trade secrets to something more reasonable, and find ways\nto embrace technologies that promote access while protecting\nincentives to innovate. The utilitarian might also remind us of the\ncosts of changing our system of intellectual property. \n\nA different strategy for justifying intellectual property rights begins\nwith the claim that individuals are entitled to control the fruits of\ntheir labor (Locke 1690; Hettinger 1989; Becker 1993; Gordon 1993;\nMoore 1998b; Hughes 1988; Palmer 2005; Himma 2005a,\n2006, 2008, 2013; Merges 2011). In general, the intuition is that the\nperson who clears unowned land, cultivates crops, builds a house, or\ncreates a new invention obtains property rights by engaging in these\nactivities.  Laboring, producing, thinking, and persevering are\nvoluntary, and individuals who engage in these activities are entitled\nto what they produce. Subject to certain restrictions, rights are\ngenerated when individuals mix their labor with an unowned\nobject. Restrictions or limits on acquisition include a labor\nrequirement, a non-waste requirement, and the “enough and as good”\nproviso (Locke 1690). Labor, for Locke, is best understood as metaphor\nfor productive activities needed to sustain and promote human\nflourshing (Mossoff 2012).  The non-waste requirement invalidates a\nproperty claim if the appropriator takes more than she can consume or\nuse without spoilage. Unlike the labor metaphor, spoilage for Locke\nmeans rotting or the destruction of an existing good useful for\nsustaining human life.  Finally, the “enough and as good” proviso is\nbest illustrated by an example Locke gives.  When someone takes a\ndrink of water from a river it is as if he takes nothing at all.  His\nfellows are, all things considered, unaffected by this\nacquisition. \n\nConsider a more formal version of Locke’s famous argument. Individuals\nown their own bodies and labor—i.e., they are self-owners. When\nan individual labors on an unowned object, her labor becomes infused\nin the object and for the most part, the labor and the object cannot\nbe separated. It follows that once a person’s labor is joined with an\nunowned object, assuming that individuals exclusively own their body\nand labor, rights to control are generated. The idea is that there is\nan expansion of rights: we each own our labor and when that labor is\nmixed with objects in the commons, our rights are expanded to include\nthese goods.   \nIn terms of intellectual property, the act of creation or discovery\ntypically takes time, effort, and skill.  Intellectual works\ndon’t spoil like apples, so there is no “non-waste”\nconcerns.  Moreover, the creation or discovery seemingly leaves\n“enough and as good.” Creating a poem, for example, and\nholding it as a secret does not preclude others from creating their\nown poems. \n\nLocke’s argument is not without difficulties. Jeremy\nWaldron (1983) argued that the idea of mixing one’s labor is\nincoherent—actions cannot be mixed with objects. P. J.\nProudhon (1840) argued that if labor was important, the second labor on\nan object should ground a property right in an object as reliably as\nthe first labor. Nozick (1974) asked why labor mixing generated\nproperty rights rather than a loss of labor. Waldron (1983) and\nPerry (1978) have argued that mixing one’s labor with an unowned\nobject should yield more limited rights than rights of full\nownership. Finally, if the skills, tools, and inventions used in\nlaboring are social products, then perhaps individual claims to title\nhave been undermined (Grant 1987; Hettinger 1989). \n\nAmong defenders of Lockean-based arguments for private property, these\nchallenges have not gone unnoticed (Spooner 1855; Schmidtz 1990; Mack\n1990; Simmons 1992; Child 1990; Moore 2001; Mossoff 2012;\nClaeys 2017).  Rather than rehearsing the points and counterpoints,\nconsider a modified version of the Lockean argument—one that\ndoes not so easily fall prey to the objections mentioned above. \nAfter weeks of effort and numerous failures, suppose Ginger comes up\nwith an excellent new recipe for spicy noodles—a recipe\nthat she keeps in her mind and does not write down. Would anyone argue\nthat Ginger does not have at least some minimal moral claim to control\nthe recipe? Suppose that Fred samples some of Ginger’s noodles and\ndesires to purchase the recipe. Is there anything morally suspicious\nwith an agreement between them that grants Fred a limited right to\nuse Ginger’s recipe provided that Fred does not disclose the process?\nAlas, Fred didn’t have to agree to the terms and, no matter how tasty\nthe noodles, he could eat something else or create his own\nrecipe. Arguably, part of the moral weightiness of the agreement\nbetween Ginger and Fred relies on the fact that Ginger holds legitimate\ntitle to the recipe.  In small communities it may even be possible to contract with all\nof one’s fellows securing all or some of the bundle of full ownership.\nIn this sort of example, every single member of the community would be\ndirectly part of the agreement.  Ginger says to her peers, “if you\nwant access to my recipe, then you will have to agree to my right to\nenjoy income” and they reply “but such rights can’t be indefinite\n… we as a community won’t be on the hook for defending this\nagreement indefinitely.”  In the ensuing give-and-take an agreement is\nhammered out.  It is important to note that the moral bindingness of\nsuch an agreement is crucially dependent on the initial set of\nentitlement claims generated by labor, desert, and non-worsening.  If\nGinger, in this case, was not the author of the recipe — suppose\nshe took it from someone else — it is not at all clear that the\nresulting contract would be morally or legally binding. \nMoving from small communities to larger ones a more general form of\nagreement between authors, inventors, and society can be considered.\nIf intellectual works are to be held as anything other than trade\nsecrets, walled off with narrow contracts like non-disclosure\nagreements or non-competition arrangements, there must be a way of\nsecuring access.  Society may purchase access by offering limited\nrights to authors and inventors.  Moreover, if some society does not\noffer this sort of protection, then innovators would likely employ\ntheir talents in other areas or simply move to a society where such\nagreements are recognized.   \nA major concern and limitation on the traditional justifications for\nintellectual property already discussed is that many scholars reject\nthe starting assumptions needed to generate the desired moral\nclaims. For example, non-utilitarians will dismiss the theoretical\nfoundations of utilitarianism. Non-Lockeans will reject Locke’s\ncommitment to self-ownership, natural rights, and individual\nflourishing. Building off of the positive economic analysis mentioned\nin the utilitarian justification for IP discussed above, Moore\n(forthcoming) offers a different sort of argument based on individual\nprudence and self interest. Note that this argument, while concerned\nwith consequences, is not focused on maximizing human well-being or\nflourishing. \nConsider the following case. Imagine that we have two intellectual\nproperty creators, Beren and Lúthien, and two possible outcomes\nfor each. In a single-play prisoner’s dilemma game, each player\ncan copy an intellectual creation of the other, or not. Assume as well\nthat the intellectual works created by Beren and Lúthien are valuable,\ninteresting, or desired. The best case for either player is one where\ntheir own intellectual creation is not copied and yet they get to copy\nthe work of the other player.  This is ‘best’ for the\nplayer who copies and ‘worst’ for the player who\ndoesn’t because, (1) the player who copies gets to enjoy or\nconsume more content compared to the other player, (2) the player who\ncopies still has the option or possibility of obtaining benefit by\nselling, trading, or bartering with the other player, while the\nnon-copier does not enjoy these possibilities — this provides a\nway to recoup research and development costs, and (3) via selling,\ntrading, or bartering the copier may obtain a positional advantage and\nmore capital for future exchanges compared to the non-copier.  Simply\nput, the copier obtains more content and retains more opportunities to\nsell, barter, or exchange compared to the non-copier. If Beren and\nLúthien both refrain from copying each other, then each will avoid the\nworst outcome in terms of recouping investment costs and being at a\npositional disadvantage. Both will also retain the option of buying or\nbartering for the non-copied content the other enjoys.  This payoff is\n‘okay,’ better than ‘worst’ but not as good as\n‘best.’ If both Beren and Lúthien copy each other, then\nboth will get extra content to enjoy and will not be put at a\npositional disadvantage, but each will be denied the possibility of\nrecouping research and development costs. The other player will not\nbuy or barter for content he already possesses. These payoffs mirror a\nprisoner’s dilemma game. \nIn modeling content creation, access, and copying as an iterated\nprisoner’s dilemma between numerous individuals, the problem becomes\neven more salient. It will be individually rational to copy the\nintellectual efforts and creations of others. This will suppress\ninnovation and lead to a sub-optimal result. Based solely on rational\nself-interest and prudence, Moore argues we should adopt institutions\nthat promote innovation and allow inventors the capacity to recoup\nresearch and development costs. If copying becomes too widespread or\nif enforcement mechanisms fail, then we will likely spiral toward the\ncollectively sub-optimal result of suppressing innovation. We see\nsimilar results of an intellectual property prisoner’s dilemma played\nout between nations.  Through the use of sanctions against copying the\nintellectual efforts of others, we give ourselves compelling reasons\nto pursue a collectively superior outcome. \n\nPutting aside the strands of argument that seek to justify moral\nclaims to intangible works and the rather focused problems with these\nviews, there are several general critiques of the rights to control\nintellectual property to consider. \n\nCritics argue that information is not the kind of thing that can be\nowned or possessed and is not something that can be property, as that\nnotion is typically defined.  Information objects, such as numbers and\npropositions are abstract objects, which cannot causally interact with\nmaterial objects, and hence cannot be owned or possessed.  The idea,\nfor example, that one could, in the relevant sense, possess and hence\nown the novel expressed by the book A Tale of Two Cities\nmakes as little sense as the idea that one could possess and hence own\nthe entity denoted by the symbol “2.” Whatever concepts\nmight properly be applied to abstract objects, on this view, the\nconcept of property, according to these theorists, does not.  As a\nconceptual matter, the term “intellectual property,” at\nbest, applies to nothing and, at worst, is incoherent.  This analysis is vulnerable to at least two objections.  First, it\nis not clear that ownership, as a conceptual matter, requires physical\npossession.  One can argue that the essence of ownership consists in a\npower — the power to exclude others from certain behaviors\ninvolving the relevant entity — and not in physical control or\npossession of the entity. Second, the claim that information objects\ncannot be property does not imply that it is illegitimate to grant to\nauthors or content-creators a legal right to exclude others from\nappropriating those objects without their consent.  That some entity E\nis not “property” implies only that it should not be legally protected\nqua property; it does not imply that E should not be protected in very\nsimilar ways.  It might be that such legal rights should be called\nsomething other than “intellectual property rights,” but these rights\ncould be called something else, such as, for example, “intellectual\ncontent rights.” \n\nMany have argued that the non-rivalrous nature of intellectual works\ngrounds a prima facie case against rights to restrict access.\nSince intellectual works are not typically consumed by their use and\ncan be used by many individuals concurrently (making a copy does not\ndeprive anyone of their possessions), we have a strong case against\nmoral and legal intellectual property rights (Kuflik 1989; Hettinger\n1989; Barlow 1997). One reason for the widespread pirating of\nintellectual works is that many people think restricting access to\nthese works is unjustified. Consider a more formal version of\nthis argument: \n\nThe weak point in this argument is the first premise (Moore 2012;\nHimma, 2005b). Consider sensitive personal information.\nMoore argues that it false to claim that just because this information\ncan be used and consumed by many individuals concurrently, a prima\nfacie moral claim to maximal access is established. This argument\napplies as well to snuff films, obscene pornography, information\nrelated to national security, personal financial information, and\nprivate thoughts; each are non-rivalrous, but this fact does not by\nitself generate prima facie moral claims for maximal access and\nuse. Moreover, it is not clear that unauthorized copying does no\nharm to the owner even in cases where the copier would not have\npurchased a copy legitimately (and thus is not denying the owner\neconomic compensation they would otherwise receive). Unauthorized\ncopying creates un-consented to risks that owners must\nshoulder. \n\nHimma points out that, by itself, the claim that consumption of\ninformation is non-rivalrous does not imply that we have a right of any\nkind to those objects. While this certainly provides a reason\nagainst thinking protection of intellectual property is morally\njustified, it does not tell us anything about whether we have a right\nof some sort because it does not contain any information about morally\nrelevant properties of human beings—and the justification of\ngeneral rights-claims necessarily rests on attributions of value that\nimplicitly respond to interests of beings with the appropriate level of\nmoral standing—in our case, our status as persons (Himma\n2005b).  Barlow (1997) argues that information is entitled to moral\nconsideration in virtue of being alive.  On his view, information is a\nform of life with a claim to be free that is grounded in interests and\n“wants” of its own.  As he puts the point, information\nobjects “are life forms in every respect but a basis in the\ncarbon atom.  They self-reproduce, they interact with their\nsurroundings and adapt to them, they mutate, they persist.”\nFurther, these living information objects have some sort of interest\nin being made available to everyone free of charge.  Barlow’s argument can be challenged on a couple of grounds.\nFirst, Himma (2005b) argues that it is simply implausible to think of\nabstract objects as having wants — or even interests. The\nconcept of desire is such that only conscious beings are capable of\nhaving desires; although a conscious being can have subconscious\ndesires, non-sentient entitles are no more accurately characterized as\nhaving desires than as having hopes.  Second, even if information\nobjects had wants or interests, Barlow gives no reason for thinking\nthat they have a desire to, or interest in being made freely available\nto all.  Certainly, the claim that being made freely available to all\nsomehow benefits information objects needs an argument if for no other\nreason than that it is counterintuitive. \nAccording to some, promoting intellectual property rights is\ninconsistent with our commitment to freedom of thought and speech\n(Nimmer 1970; Hettinger 1989; Waldron 1993). Closely associated with\nthis argument is the position that individuals have a right to\nknowledge and intellectual property institutions interfere with this\nbasic right. Hettinger argues that intellectual property\n“restricts methods of acquiring ideas (as do trade secrets), it\nrestricts the use of ideas (as do patents), and it restricts the\nexpression of ideas (as do copyrights)—restrictions undesirable\nfor a number of reasons” (Hettinger 1989). Hettinger singles out\ntrade secrets as the most troublesome because, unlike patents and\ncopyrights, they do not require disclosure. \n\nThree sorts of replies have been offered to this kind of worry (Himma\n2006; Moore 2012). While we focus on the free speech argument against\nintellectual property, right to know arguments fall prey to similar\nobjections. The first objection notes that it is the incentives found\nin providing limited protection that fosters the creation and\ndissemination of information—a system of intellectual property\nprotection may cause restricted access in the short run, but overall,\nthe commons of thought and expression is enhanced.  Second, it is not at all clear that free speech is so presumptively\nweighty that it nearly always trumps other values. Shouting at someone\nover a bullhorn all day is not something we would countenance as\nprotected free speech. Hate speech, obscene\nexpressions, sexual harassment, and broadcasting private medical\ninformation about others are each examples of speech that we are\nwilling to limit for various reasons—perhaps intellectual\nproperty rights can be viewed in this light. Finally, consider the contentious, yet established, idea/expression\nrule of copyright.  Copyright only applies to fixed expressions, not\nto the ideas that may make up a fixed expression. For example, someone\nmay read Darwin’s original writings on evolution, express these ideas\nin her own words, and obtain a copyright in the new expression.  This\nindividual may be guilty of plagiarism, but so long as her expressions\nare not copied from Darwin’s original or substantially similar to the\noriginal, she can obtain a copyright. Copyrights and patents require\ndisclosure and thus the ideas that make up these intellectual works\nmay be discussed and analyzed. \n\nAccording to this view, information is a social product and enforcing\naccess restrictions unduly benefits authors and inventors.\nIndividuals are raised in societies that endow them with knowledge\nwhich these individuals then use to create intellectual works of all\nkinds. On this view the building blocks of intellectual\nworks—knowledge—is a social product. Individuals should\nnot have exclusive and perpetual ownership of the works that they\ncreate because these works are built upon the shared knowledge of\nsociety. Allowing rights to intellectual works would be similar to\ngranting ownership to the individual who placed the last brick in a\npublic works dam. The dam is a social product, built up by the efforts\nof hundreds, and knowledge, upon which all intellectual works are\nbuilt, is built up in a similar fashion (Proudhon 1840; Grant 1987;\nShapiro 1991; Simmons 1992, Boyle 1997). \n\nBeyond challenging whether the notion of “society” employed\nin this view is clear enough to carry the weight that the argument\ndemands, critics have questioned the view that societies can be\nowed something or that they can own or\ndeserve something (Spooner 1855; Nozick 1974; Moore\n2012). Lysander Spooner writes: \nMoore charges that defenders of this sort of argument fail to see that\nit may prove too much. \nFinally, even if a defender of this view can justify societal\nownership of general pools of knowledge and information, it could be\nargued that we have already paid for the use of this collective wisdom\nwhen we pay for education and the like. \n\nCoy (2007) argues is that, in a competitive market, the cost of\ninformation should properly reflect the cost of making it available to\nusers. On this line of analysis, while the cost of making publishing\ninformation in traditional material media like books might be\nsufficiently high to justify charging users a price for it, the cost\n(per user) of making information available on digital media approaches\nzero as the number of users grow larger.  For example, there might be\nsome fixed cost involved in making information available on a website,\nbut no additional cost is required beyond that to make that content\navailable to any number of users; the more users appropriating the\ninformation, the lower the cost of making it available to any\nparticular user.  Thus, the argument concludes, it would be unfair to\ncharge users a fee for appropriating any piece of (digital)\ninformation; information should be free (or nearly free) so as to\nreflect its dissemination costs. \nThere are two problems with this argument.  First, if one accepts the\nlegitimacy of free enterprise, as appears to be presupposed by the\nabove argument, then what is a fair price will be determined by the\nvoluntary interactions of buyers and sellers in a competitive market:\nthe fair price is that which is set by the contractual transactions of\nfree, prudentially-rational buyers and sellers.  If buyers in a\ncompetitive market are willing to pay a price for digital information\nthat is significantly higher than the seller’s marginal cost, then\nthat price can be presumed fair.  Second, the argument overlooks the\nfact that the fixed costs associated with producing and distributing\nintellectual content can be quite high.  For example, the Disney\nCompany spent more than $200 million in making the film John Carter.\nIf one assumes that a fair price is such as to allow the producer to\nrecover the fixed development costs associated with producing and\ndistributing intellectual content, this would entail that it is fair\nfor content producers to charge a price that is sufficiently above the\nmarginal costs to allow them to recover these fixed costs.
