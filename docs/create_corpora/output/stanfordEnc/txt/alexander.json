Thomas","entry":"alexander","body.text":"\n\n\n\nThe Australian-born philosopher Samuel Alexander\n(1859–1938) was a prominent figure in early twentieth-century\nBritish philosophy.  He is best known as one of the progenitors of\nBritish Emergentism, a movement that claimed that mind\n“emerges” from matter.  Alexander rejected idealism, and\naccordingly can also be labelled a “new realist” alongside\nthe likes of Bertrand Russell; however, unlike other new realists,\nAlexander maintained close ties to British idealism throughout his\ncareer, and his ontology is arguably similar to the Absolute Idealism\nof F. H. Bradley. Alexander’s mature metaphysical system is set out in\nhis greatest work Space, Time, and Deity (1920). Alexander\nconceives the world as a hierarchy of levels: space and time sit at\nthe lowest level, and through a process of emergence give rise to the\nlevels of matter, life, mind, and deity. These levels are pervaded by\n“categorical” features of reality, such as substance,\nuniversals, and causality.  Although Alexander is primarily known as a\nmetaphysician, he also wrote extensively on many other philosophical\ntopics, including the history of philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, and\nthe philosophy of religion.  Alexander spent most of his professional\ncareer at the University of Manchester, where he supported various\nmoves in education and feminism.  On his death, Alexander left his\nphilosophical papers and correspondence to the John Rylands Library at\nManchester, and this collection constitutes an extremely important\nphilosophic archive of the period. \n\n\n\nAlthough Alexander never founded a school of philosophy, his work was\nwidely celebrated during his lifetime. His friend and colleague John\nLaird describes Space, Time, and Deity as “the boldest\nadventure in detailed speculative metaphysics” since Hobbes. He\nadds that, “Alexander’s reviewers, in general, were profoundly\nand gratefully impressed—if they were seldom convinced”\n(Laird 1939: 61–5). Alexander has been credited with having an\ninfluence on figures as diverse as the process philosopher A.\nN. Whitehead, John Anderson the “father of Australian\nphilosophy” and his school at Sydney, and the philosopher of\nhistory R. G. Collingwood. A number of studies were produced on\nAlexander’s work in the mid-twentieth century, but it has since been\nneglected. \n\n\n\nAlexander was born in Sydney on 6 January 1859, to a Jewish family. He was the third son of\nSamuel Alexander, a British emigrant and saddler. Alexander’s father\ndied a few weeks after his birth, and five years later the remaining\nfamily moved to Melbourne. Alexander was home-educated by tutors\nbefore entering Wesley College in 1871. Alexander entered the\nUniversity of Melbourne in 1875, and subsequently won awards in arts,\nsciences, languages and natural philosophy. In 1877, Alexander sailed\nfor England, in an attempt to win a scholarship at Oxbridge. He\nsuccessfully obtained a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, and\nwent on to win a First in 1881. The following year, Alexander was\nawarded a Fellowship at Lincoln College. \n\nAt this time, the Oxford philosophical scene was dominated by British\nidealism, and Alexander formed lifelong ties with the Absolute\nidealists F. H. Bradley, A. C. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet. This\nidealist influence is evident in Alexander’s earliest works, on Hegel\nand moral progress. Arguably, it is also evident in his later works on\nmetaphysics too. As a student, Alexander also read Plato—under\nthe tutelage of the idealist Benjamin Jowett—and Hegel. \n\nAlexander remained at Oxford until 1893 whereupon he accepted a\nProfessorship at the University of Manchester. He took an active part\nin the university life there, and strongly supported feminism.\nAlexander remained at Manchester for the rest of his life, and in 1902\nhe brought various family members over—including his mother and\nthree of his siblings—from Australia to Manchester. Alexander\nnever married. Although Alexander never returned to Australia he\nmaintained a correspondence with several Australian philosophers,\nincluding the Scottish-born John Anderson. \n\nAs Alexander developed his anti-idealist views, he published on\nnaturalism and realism. He corresponded at length with fellow British\nemergentists C. Lloyd Morgan and C. D. Broad on psychology and\nmetaphysics. Whilst he rejected idealism, he also continued to\ncorrespond with F. H. Bradley and Bosanquet. During the War, Alexander\ncanvassed for recruits, and assisted Belgian refugees. John Laird\nreports that, after the War, Alexander struggled with writing his\ngreatest work, Space, Time, and Deity: “He was\noverwhelmed by a sense of his littleness in comparison with the task\nto which he was tied” (Laird 1939: 61). Nonetheless, Alexander\npublished the work in 1920, and with it assured his place in the\nBritish philosophical landscape. His work was praised by new realists\nand idealists alike. In a particularly fine turn of phrase, John\nPassmore writes: \n…even when he [Alexander] broke with the Idealists, they\ncontinued to speak of him with a respect they rarely showed to the New\nRealists—although this charity did not survive the bleakness of\nCambridge, where McTaggart, forgetting his own blackened pots,\ncomplained of Space, Time, and Deity that “in every\nchapter we come across some view which no philosopher, except\nProfessor Alexander, has ever maintained”. It would be inhuman\nto expect the arch-enemy of Time to praise its arch-prophet. (Passmore\n1957: 268) \nThe bleakness of Cambridge aside, Alexander received many honours\nduring his lifetime. These include his election as a Fellow of the\nBritish Academy in 1913, an honorary D.Litt from Oxford in 1924, an\nhonorary Litt.D from the University of Liverpool in 1925, and another\nfrom the University of Cambridge in 1934. In 1923, Alexander retired\nfrom Manchester. In a speech, he described how proud and happy he was\nduring his time as a professor there, “during which I tried to\ndo my part” (Alexander, cited in Laird 1939: 71). \n\nAlexander’s retirement did not stem the tide of his output.  Having\ncompleted Space, Time, and Deity, Alexander continued to\nproduce a stream of articles as prolific as it was diverse. He wrote\nseveral pieces comparing his metaphysics to that of Spinoza, and\nAlexander took pride—perhaps rooted partly in their shared\nJewish heritage—in the deep similarity he perceived\nthere. Alexander also wrote on the nature of art, history, Moliere,\nPascal, theology and Jane Austen. Alexander was a lifelong fan of\nAusten, and particularly loved Persuasion. His friend and\ncolleague, J. H. Muirhead, suggested that Alexander’s love of\nliterature may have been the result of his partial deafness, which\nmade it difficult for him to appreciate music. \n\nUltimately, Alexander turned his philosophic attention away from\nmetaphysics to art and value. Lord Listowel describes Alexander’s move\ntowards aesthetics: \nBut why, of the many unsailed seas he must have been tempted to chart,\ndid his insatiable curiosity launch him on a last voyage into the\nrough waters of aesthetic theory? There is no certain answer to this\nquestion. What we do know is that the third person of the hallowed\ntrinity whose members are Truth, Goodness, and Beauty had hitherto\nbeen sadly neglected as compared with the first two, and that a\ntreatise on aesthetics was urgently required as the coping stone of a\nneatly finished philosophical system. Yet it would be a grievous error\nto suppose that his fondness for the subject was due solely or even\nmainly to systematic grounds. Art, in its manifold shapes, attracted\nhim irresistibly… [he] wrote and talked about Art because he\nreally loved the pictures, statues, mansions, poems, novels, and plays\nthat are its concrete manifestations. (Listowel 1939: 181) \nAlexander’s full system of aesthetics can be found in his final\nmonograph, Beauty and Other Forms of Value (1933). \n\nIn his late years, Alexander continued to publish, but Laird reports\nthat Alexander was greatly troubled from the 1930s by the suffering of\nJewish refugees; Alexander did all he could to help with pen and purse\n(Laird 1939: 94). Alexander died on 13 September 1938, and his ashes\nlie in the Manchester Southern Cemetery. He bequeathed the majority of\nhis estate, and his philosophical papers, to the University of\nManchester. A bust of Alexander, by the artist Epstein, stands in the\nUniversity of Manchester’s Samuel Alexander Building (formerly known\nas the Hall of the Arts Building). Alexander reportedly said that he\nwould be happy to have Erravit cum Spinoza engraved on his\nfuneral urn; Muirhead suggested that instead he should have Ut\nalter Spinoza \nphilosophatus[1] \n(Muirhead 1939: 14).  \n\nA biography of Alexander can be found in Laird’s (1939) memoir; see\nalso Muirhead’s (1939) and G. F. Stout’s (1940). \n\nAlexander’s first publication, “Hegel’s Conception of\nNature” (1886), reveals Alexander’s philosophic upbringing in\nthe Oxford British Hegelian enclave. Alexander aims to set out Hegel’s\nconception of nature—“so fantastic and so poetical that it\nmay often be thought not to be serious”—as clearly as\npossible, and show where it agrees with, and diverges from,\ncontemporary science. He explains that science leads to a philosophy\nof nature through observation—for example, transforming\nseemingly isolated individuals into universals by discovering their\ngeneral character—and the discovery of laws. Alexander also\ncompares Hegel’s account to contemporary theories of evolution, and\nargues that there is a “great likeness” (Alexander 1886:\n518).  Arguably, some of the positions that Alexander attributes to\nHegel are similar to his own mature views; for example, Alexander\nreads Hegel as holding that space and time are “in the\nworld” as much as matter (Alexander 1886: 506). \n\nAlexander’s early monograph Locke (1908) discusses Locke’s\nviews on ethics, politics and religion as given in\nLocke’s Essay. The book is extremely short but one comes away\nwith a keen sense of Alexander’s admiration for Locke.  Whilst this\nwork is mainly of scholarly interest, Alexander spends one chapter\n“Observations on the Essay” critiquing Locke, and\nhere Alexander reveals the bent of his own early views. For example,\nAlexander complains that Locke might have gone further had he applied\nhis observations regarding the continuity of mental experience to\nsubstance (Alexander 1908: 52). This is suggestive, given that one of\nAlexander’s later key claims concerning spacetime—the stuff of\nsubstances—is that it is continuous.  \n\nAlexander’s first monograph Moral Order and Progress (1889)\nconstitutes a defence of evolutionary ethics, the naturalistic thesis\nthat human morality is a product of biological evolution. The\nmonograph is based on a dissertation written by Alexander at Oxford,\nfor which he won the T. H. Green Moral Philosophy Prize in 1887. In\nthe preface, Alexander writes, \nI am proud to have my work connected, however indirectly, with the\nname of T. H. Green; and I feel this all the more because, though, as\nwill be obvious, my obligations to him are very great, I have not\nscrupled to express my present dissent from his fundamental\nprinciples. (vii) \nThe preface also reveals the strong idealist\nbackdrop against which Alexander’s work is set: the monograph is\ndedicated to A. C. Bradley, and in the preface Alexander personally\nthanks D. G. Ritchie, William Wallace, R. L. Nettleship and\nJ. S. Haldane. Alexander adds that he owes a special debt of gratitude\nto F. H. Bradley who went through the essay with him (Alexander 1889:\nix). Alexander continued to exchange philosophic ideas with many of\nthese idealists throughout their lives. \n\nAlexander opens the monograph by stating that the proper business of\nethics is the study of moral judgements, such as “It is wrong to\nlie”. Alexander sets out to discover the nature of morality,\nasking what these judgements actually express (Alexander 1889:\n1–3).  He does so by examining a selection of “working\nconceptions” in ethics—including right, wrong, and\nduty—and asking what they correspond to. In the same way that\nthe working conceptions of physics—including energy, matter and\nmotion—are ordered according to a “natural\ncoherence”, Alexander aims to order ethical\nconceptions. Alexander concludes that these working conceptions\ncorrespond to ways of maintaining equilibrium in society.  For\nexample, ideas of good or right imply nothing more than “an\nadjustment of parts in an orderly whole”: the equilibrium of\ndifferent persons in society. \n[T]he predicate ‘good’ applied to an\naction… means that the act is one by which the agent seeks to\nperform the function required of him by his position in\nsociety. (Alexander 1889: 113) \nAlexander takes this thesis to be the common\n ground of at least two current rival ethical theories: \nNow nothing is more striking at the present time than the convergence\nof the main opposing ethical theories, at any rate, in our own\ncountry—on the one hand, the traditional English mode of\nthought, which advancing through utilitarianism has ended in the\nso-called evolutionary ethics; and on the other, the idealistic\nmovement which is associated with the German philosophy derived from\nKant… Both these views recognise that kind of proportion\nbetween the individual and his society, or between him and the law,\nwhich is expressed under the phrase, organic connection. (Alexander\n1889: 5–6) \nAlexander’s perception of progress in ethical theory, towards this\ncorrect end point, is Hegelian in style. \n\nAlexander’s ethical system is a kind of evolutionary ethics.  By\napplying the notion of evolution to ethics, Alexander explains that\none can mean either the mere integration of the biological into the\nethical sphere, or treating morals as one part of a comprehensive view\nof the universe, in which a steady development from the lower to the\nhigher can be observed, a development which follows the law of the\nsurvival of the fittest (Alexander 1889: 14). Alexander, of course,\nmeans both. He emphasises that while his ethical system, based on the\norganic nature of society, is due in part to the influence of the\nbiological sciences, it would be an “entire\nmisapprehension” to think that it were entirely due to this\ninfluence; his views are also the result of progress in ethics and\npolitics (Alexander 1889: 7–8). \n\nIt is worth noting that, despite the influence of Absolute idealism\nhovering in the background of this work, Alexander firmly resists the\ntendency of idealism towards monism, the thesis that the universe is\nin some sense One. \n[T]he conception of a common good is apt to\nsuggest an absolute identity of good… in greater or less degree\nall forms of so-called Monism, which hold that in the good act the\nindividual is at one with others, and with the Universal Being, are\nvictims of the misconception. (Alexander 1889: 174) \nIn other words, Alexander is arguing that just\nbecause he is putting forward one conception of goodness—organic\nconnection within society—that does not mean that the\nindividuals within society are not individuals.  \n\nIn a series of papers published in quick succession—including\nhis 1909–10, 1912a, 1912b and 1914—Alexander put forward a\nnumber of theses that he would later expand on in Space, Time, and\nDeity (1920). \n\nIn “The Basis of Realism” (1914) Alexander rejects\nidealism in favour of realism. He writes that the “temper”\nof realism is to de-anthropomorphise: to put man and mind in their\nproper places in the world of things. Whilst mind is properly\nunderstood as part of nature, this does not diminish its value\n(Alexander 1914: 279–80). For Alexander, realism is thus\nnaturalistic.  This paper is an expansion of Alexander’s less rigorous\n(1909–10), where he compares the new conception of mind as a\nmere part of the universe—as opposed to being at the centre of\nthe universe—to the move from geocentrism to heliocentrism. \n\nA key part of Alexander’s thesis is that minds exist in the world\nalongside other things. Minds are “compresent” with other\nobjects in the world, such as tables and mountains. In fact, all\nexistents are compresent with each other. \nThere is nothing peculiar in the relation itself between mind and its\nobjects; what is peculiar in the situation is the character of one of\nthe terms, its being mind or consciousness. The relation is one of\ncompresence. But there is compresence between two physical things. The\nrelation of mind and object is comparable to that between table and\nfloor. (Alexander 1914: 288) \nAccording to Alexander, we perceive the world directly—we do not\nperceive representations or ideas of tables, but the tables\nthemselves—and we are conscious of the process of our\nperception, a consciousness that Alexander labels\n“enjoyment”. Any direct theory of perception must account\nfor error: If we perceive the world directly, how is it that we make\nmistakes about it? Alexander’s answer is that we do not perceive the\nworld incorrectly, but we can incorrectly apply partial perceptions to\nwholes. For example, if we perceive a table as having a flat edge,\nthat is correct, but we would be incorrect to apply our perception of\npart of the table to the table as a whole. \n\nAlexander also argues here that minds emerge from lower-level living\norganisms, and are no less real for it. \n[M]ind, though descended on its physical side from lower forms of\nexistence, is, when it comes, a new quality in the world, and no more\nceases to be original because in certain respects it is resoluble into\nphysical motions, than colour disappears because it is resoluble into\nvibrations. (Alexander 1914: 304)  \nThe biology that informed Alexander’s early (1889) work on ethics\nsurvives in his account of mind: mind emerges in the world through\nevolution. This theory of “emergent evolution” is akin to\nthat advanced by C. Lloyd Morgan; Alexander later references\nMorgan’s Instinct and Experience (1912). \n\nAlexander adds here that the lowest level of existence is space and\ntime—that they are “the foundation of all\nreality”—and he greatly expands on this view in his book\n(1920). \n\nThis difficult two-volume work sets out Alexander’s grand metaphysical\npicture, a sweeping system that offers a cosmogony—an\nexplanation of how the world came to be in its current state—and\na hierarchical ontology based on emergence that attempts to account\nfor matter, life, mind, value, and deity. Alexander does not argue for\nthis picture; rather, he intends that his picture should provide a\ndescription of the world. This is in line with his general\nmethodology. \nPhilosophy proceeds by description; it only uses\nargument in order to help you to see the facts, just as a botanist\nuses a microscope. (Alexander 1921b: 423) \nThe idea is that Space, Time, and Deity\noffers us a description of the world that best fits the facts. \n\nThe first chapter of Space, Time, and Deity opens with\nAlexander’s proclamation that all the vital problems of philosophy\ndepend on space and time (Alexander 1920i: 35). Alexander goes on to\nconceive space and time as the stuff out of which all things are made:\nspace and time are real and concrete, and out of them emerge matter,\nlife and so on. Space and time are unified in a four-dimensional\nmanifold, spacetime. This single vast entity does not move but it\ncontains all motions within itself, and so Alexander labels it\n“Motion”. In this respect, Alexander’s spacetime bears\nsome resemblance to F. H. Bradley’s (1893) Absolute: neither Motion\nnor the Absolute move or exist in time, but they both contain motion\nand time within themselves.  \n\nAlexander presents a metaphysical argument for the unity of space and\ntime, arguing that they are merely distinguishable aspects of\nMotion. He argues that space and time must be unified because, when\nabstracted away from each other, it becomes clear that they could not\nexist independently. Time would become a mere “now”,\nincapable of succession; and space would become a mere\n“blank”, without distinguishable elements (Alexander\n1920i: 47). Motion is both successive and boasts distinguishable\nelements, and this is because it is the union of space and time.\nAlexander’s metaphysical argument for this union was severely\ncriticised by Broad’s (1921a,b) series of\npapers.[2]\nAlexander considered his account of spacetime to be in line with the\nphysics of his day; this might be understood as an argument from\nphysics for his position. \nOur purely metaphysical analysis of Space-Time on\nthe basis of ordinary experience is in essence and spirit identical\nwith Minkowski’s conception of an absolute world of four dimensions,\nof which the three-dimensional world of geometry omits the element of\ntime. (Alexander 1920i: 87) \nAlexander goes on to distinguish between the characters of empirical\nexistents that are variable—such as life, redness or\nsweetness—and those that are pervasive. \n[These pervasive qualities] belong in some form to all existents\nwhatever. Such are identity (numerical identity for example),\nsubstance, diversity, magnitude, even number… The pervasive\ncategories of existence are what are known from Kant’s usage as the\ncategories of experience, and I shall call them, in distinction from\nthe empirical ones or qualities, categorial characters. (Alexander\n1920i: 184–5) \nCategorical qualities are the properties of spacetime, and this is why\nthe categories apply to all things within spacetime. This discussion\nbuilds on Alexander’s “The Method of Metaphysics; and the\nCategories” (1912). In a later paper—“Some\nExplanations” (1921b)—composed in order to answer some of\nthe worries of his critics, Alexander explains that the existence of\nthe categories implies the existence of something that contains them:\nspacetime. \n[F]or me the doctrine of the categories, taken along with the notion\nof S-T [spacetime], is central… What is “relation”\nin virtue of which duration is a whole of related successive moments?\nWhat does relation stand for in our experience? I answer that it\nalready implies S-T, and that until it receives its concrete\ninterpretation it is in metaphysics a word. (Alexander 1921b:\n411–2) \nThe idea is that, by positing the existence of spacetime, we explain\nthe existence of relations—characteristics of reality that hold\nbetween all things—and, similarly, the existence of spacetime\nexplains the existence of all other categories. For more on relations,\nsee Alexander’s (1921b). \n\nIn the second volume of Space, Time, and Deity, Alexander\nasks how spacetime is related to the various levels of existence\nwithin it: matter, life, mind and deity. Alexander argues that we\nshould model the emergence of levels within spacetime on the emergence\nof mind from body. \nEmpirical things are complexes of space-time with their qualities, and\nit is now my duty to attempt to show how the different orders of\nempirical existence are related to each other… [T]he nature of\nmind and its relation to body is a simpler problem in itself than the\nrelation of lower qualities of existence to their inferior basis; and\nfor myself it has afforded the clue to the interpretation of the lower\nlevels of existence. (Alexander 1920ii: 3) \nAnalogous to the way that Alexander takes mind to emerge from body,\nnew levels of being emerge from spacetime when the motions within\nspacetime become complex enough. \nEmpirical things or existents are… groupings within Space-Time,\nthat is, they are complexes of pure events or motions in various\ndegrees of complexity. Such finites have all the categorial\ncharacters, that is, all the fundamental features which flow from the\nnature of any space-time… [A]s in the course of Time new\ncomplexity of motions comes into existence, a new quality\nemerges… The case which we are using as a clue is the emergence\nof the quality of consciousness from a lower level of complexity which\nis vital [i.e., life]. (Alexander 1920ii: 45) \nAlexander has been criticised for explaining the emergence of\nqualities within spacetime by analogy with mind-body emergence, as the\nlatter kind of emergence is rarely taken to be as unproblematic as\nAlexander appears to conceive it. For more on this, see for example\nEmmet (1950).  \n\nAccording to Alexander, the emergence of new levels of being within\nspacetime is driven by a “nisus”, a striving or felt push\ntowards some end. \nThere is a nisus in Space-Time which, as it has\nborne its creatures forward through matter and life to mind, will bear\nthem forward to some higher level of existence. (Alexander 1920ii:\n346) \nThis means that the emergence of qualities in\n spacetime is not merely a process, it is a progress. Exactly what the\n nisus is has divided\n commentators.[3]\n but however it is best understood, it pushes the emergence of new\n qualities within spacetime, and this includes the push towards\n deity. \n\nThe second volume of Space, Time, and Deity also contains a\nrelatively brief discussion of beauty, and other forms of value.\nAlexander hugely expands on this account in his 1933\nmonograph; see Section 4.2 below. \n\nAlexander’s system drew many admirers, but few converts.  Alexander\nengaged in extended correspondence on Space, Time, and\nDeity—his letters with F. H. Bradley, C. D. Broad and\nC. Lloyd Morgan are particularly important—and much of it has\nsurvived in the Samuel Alexander Papers held at the John Rylands\nLibrary, Manchester. \n\nSecondary literature on Alexander’s spacetime metaphysics includes\nBrettschneider (1964), Broad (1921a,b), Murphy’s (1927–1928)\nseries, Emmet (1950), Thomas (2013), and Fisher (2015). Schaffer’s (2009) argues for\nthe identification of spacetime with matter, and traces this line of\nthought to Alexander. Secondary literature on Alexander’s account of\nmind-body emergence include classic critiques from Broad (1921a,b),\nCalkins (1923) and Emmet (1950). Stout (1922) discusses and rejects\nAlexander’s theory of perception.  There has been more recent work on\nAlexander’s account of emergence in general; see McLaughlin (1992),\nGillet (2006), and O’Connor and Wong (2012). \n\nOne of the optimistic conclusions of Space, Time, and Deity\nis Alexander’s thesis that in the future deity will emerge as a\nquality of the universe as a whole. This deity-world emergence is akin\nto mind-body emergence. In the following passage, Alexander explains\nthat we should not identity God with spacetime. Instead, the spacetime\nsystem is in the process of “engendering” God: \nThe universe, though it can be expressed without remainder in terms of\nSpace and Time, is not merely spatio-temporal. It exhibits materiality\nand life and mind. It compels us to forecast the next empirical\nquality of deity. On the one hand, we have the totality of the world,\nwhich in the end is spatio-temporal; on the other the quality of deity\nengendered or rather being engendered, within that whole. These two\nfeatures are united in the conception of the whole world as expressing\nitself in the character of deity, and it is this and not bare\nSpace-Time which for speculation is the ideal conception of\nGod. (Alexander 1920ii: 353–4) \nFor Alexander, God is the whole world possessing the quality of deity\n(Alexander 1920ii: 353). However, the “whole world” does\nnot yet exist because Alexander’s universe is one of process; the\nuniverse is in progress towards becoming complete, and this is why\nAlexander claims the universe is in process towards deity.  The whole\nworld, which will possess the quality of deity, does not yet exist,\nbut part of it does: “As an actual existent, God is the infinite\nworld with its nisus towards deity” (Alexander 1920ii: 353). The\nquality of deity has not yet arrived—and indeed, may never\narrive—but God exists in the sense that part of his body, the\ngrowing world, does.  \n\nA potential problem for Alexander is that God is frequently perceived\nas being atemporal. In contrast, it should be clear that on\nAlexander’s system, God is both spatial and temporal. Alexander\nrecognises that this could be considered a problem, but argues that in\nfact it is an advantage. If God does not “precede” the\nworld, but rather is the product of it, one is able to avoid one\nformulation of the problem of evil, on which God creates the world and\nallows suffering within it (Alexander 1920ii: 399). \nGod is then not responsible for the miseries\nendured in working out his providence, but rather we are responsible\nfor our acts. (Alexander 1920ii: 400) \nA created deity makes our positions as free\nagents more important. \n\nAlexander’s account of deity is explored further in his essay\n“Theism and Pantheism”, originally published in 1927 and\nreprinted in his Philosophical and Literary Pieces (1939). In\nthis paper, Alexander argues that theology is a kind of science that\naims to account for a certain kind of experience: one’s sense of the\ndivine in the world (Alexander 1939: 316). Alexander discusses a\nparticular philosophical problem facing theism, the question of\nwhether transcendence (i.e., being beyond the material world) and\nimmanence (i.e., living within the world) can be combined in one\nbeing, as is often claimed of God. Alexander argues that he can offer\na solution: God can be understood as being transcendent and immanent\nif he will emerge from the world. \nGod… is himself in the making, and his divine quality or deity\na stage in time beyond the human quality. And as the root and leaves\nand sap of the plant feed its flower, so the whole world, as so far\nunrolled in the process of time, flowers into deity… God’s\ndeity is thus the new quality of the universe which emerges in its\nforward movement in time. (Alexander 1939: 330)  \nGod is transcendent in the sense that he is still in the making, and\nimmanent in the sense that he will bloom from the whole world.  \n\nExtended discussions of Alexander’s theism can be found in Titus (1933) and Thomas (2016). More  limited discussions can be found in McCarthy (1948) and Stiernotte (1954). Emergentist\ntheologies—positions holding that in some sense God\nwill emerge from the universe—are currently enjoying a revival, and in this context Clayton (2004) discusses Alexander’s system as a rival to his own. \n\nIn a late series of papers following the publication of Space,\nTime, and Deity, Alexander reportedly came across the system of\nSpinoza for the first time. In these\npapers—including Spinoza and Time (1921a) and\n“Lessons from Spinoza” (1927)—Alexander reconstructs\nhis system as a “gloss” of Spinoza. \n\nAlexander argues that philosophy and physics has only just begun to\n“Take time seriously”, and had Spinoza been aware of these\ndevelopments, his ontology would ultimately have resembled\nAlexander’s. Alexander particularly refers to the thesis that space\nand time should be combined into the four dimensional manifold\nspacetime. \n\nSpinoza argues in the Ethics that there is only one\nsubstance, and this substance is identical to God and nature. The\nsubstance has an infinite number of attributes, including spatial\nextension, and it supports an infinity of dependent modes. Alexander\nargues that his system is similar to Spinoza’s except that he\nunderstands the single substance—Motion—to have only two\nattributes, space and time. \nIn our gloss upon Spinoza the ultimate reality is full of Time, not\ntimeless but essentially alive with Time, and the theatre of incessant\nchange. It is only timeless in the sense that taken as a whole it is\nnot particularised to any one moment of duration, but comprehends them\nall… Reality is Space-Time or motion itself, infinite or\nself-contained and having nothing outside itself. (Alexander 1921a:\n39) \nAlexander argues that his gloss of Spinoza solves various problems in\nSpinoza’s original system. He also praises Spinoza for successfully\ncombining religious values and naturalism (Alexander 1927:\n14). Alexander concludes one of his pieces on this topic by saying\nthat he takes pride in the similarity between his system and Spinoza’s\n(Alexander 1921a: 79). Alexander was corresponding at this time with\nthe Spinoza scholar Harold Joachim. \n\nThere is very little secondary literature on this aspect of\nAlexander’s thought, although it has been argued that Alexander is\nbest understood through Spinoza (Thomas 2013).  \n\nAlexander’s writing on art falls into two kinds. First, there are a\nnumber of essays on literature and art. These cover a wide range of\ntopics—from the art of Jane Austen, to the writings of Pascal,\nto the origin of the creative impulse—and they are all reprinted\nin Alexander’s 1939. Second, there are the pieces that make up\nAlexander’s account of value. Alexander’s early interest in\nethics—exemplified in his first monograph (1889)—survived\nin his later work as a preoccupation with the nature of value, albeit\nwith a focus on the aesthetic value of beauty. Alexander’s 1920\ncontained several chapters on the nature of value, and he goes on to\nsupplement these with a number of further papers on the same\ntheme. These include “Naturalism and Value”, and\n“Value”, both of which are reprinted in\nAlexander’s Philosophical and Literary Pieces (1939); and\n“Morality as An Art” (1928). These papers culminate in\nanother monograph, Beauty and Other Forms of Value (1933) and\nthis constitutes Alexander’s most important work on the\ntopic. Alexander’s writings on value are of greater philosophic\ninterest than are those on literature and art. \n\nThe views that Alexander expresses in “Morality as An Art”\nprovide a useful introduction to his full account. In this paper,\nAlexander argues that we can fruitfully understand morality by\ncomparing it to fine art. He argues that, just as the value of beauty\nfound in art is a human construction, so are moral values. \nFor it is the most obvious feature of fine art that it is a human\nconstruction. But it is not so evident that truth and morality are as\nmuch constructions of ours as beauty is… I am here to plead the\nopposite doctrine. The highest so-called values, truth, beauty, and\ngoodness, are all of them human inventions, and the valuable is what\nsatisfies certain human instincts or impulses. (Alexander 1928:\n143) \nAn obvious objection to this view is that beauty is not constructed;\nwe might find it in a natural landscape, for example. Alexander\nreplies to this that landscapes and other natural phenomena are\nrendered beautiful by the parts that we pick out, akin to a\nphotographer composing a picture. As such, the beauty of nature is\ncomposed by us (Alexander 1928:149). This entails that there is no\ndifference in kind between natural beauty and art; for more on this,\nsee Alexander’s “Art and the Material” (reprinted in\nAlexander 1939). \n\nAlexander argues that we construct values in response to certain\nneeds. For example, beauty satisfies the impulse of constructiveness\nin humans. In “Value”, Alexander connects human art to the\ndam building of beavers (Alexander 1939: 296). Analogously, morality\nsatisfies the impulse of gregariousness or sociality in humans. \n[I]t is humanized out of the purely animal\nsociality… which we find in animals that live in herds like\nwild dogs, or form societies like bees. (Alexander 1928: 150) \nAlexander expands on this account in Beauty and other forms of\nValue (1933). Alexander perceives his naturalistic account of\nvalue to be similar to that offered by Spinoza. In “Naturalism\nand Value”, Alexander tells us that Spinoza’s is the\n“true” naturalism: everything is extension, including\nvalue, and yet everything is still divine (Alexander 1939: 279). \n\nBuilding on the many smaller pieces that preceded it, Beauty and\nOther Forms of Value provides Alexander’s full naturalist account\nof value. Alexander’s approach is to discuss the supreme values in\nturn—beginning with beauty, and moving on to truth and\ngoodness—and then continue down to lesser values. He aims to\nexplain not just what values are, but also how they came to be.  \n\nAlexander argues that anything can have value if it matters to a\nthing. In this sense, food is valuable to an animal, and moisture is\nvaluable to a plant. However, the “supreme”\nvalues—beauty, goodness and truth—can be distinguished\nfrom others because they are the only values that are valuable in\nthemselves, for their own sake.  \nWhen we come to the highest values, the beautiful, the true and the\ngood, these in one respect are like wheat and apples: they are objects\nof a certain constitution—statues and sonatas, landscapes,\ngenerous deeds, chemistry. Their pre-eminence as values is that they\nhave no being apart from their value. That is because they are not\nmerely found, like apples, and their value, like the value of apples\nfor food, then discovered, but are made to have value, come into\nexistence along with their value. (Alexander 1933: 293) \nThe claim that these values come into existence along with their value\nis of course referring to Alexander’s thesis—also given in\nhis Beauty and other forms of Value (1933)—that the\nsupreme values are human inventions. \n\nAs we saw above, Alexander argues that humans construct values in\nresponse to certain needs or instincts. In the final part\nof Beauty and Other Forms of Value, Alexander identifies the\nanimal origin of our supreme values. For example, there is an analogy\nto be drawn between the social impulse in humans and in bees. In\n“Naturalism and Value”, Alexander explains that in the\nsame way that the instinct of bees for finding honey once seemed to be\n“magical” and yet it has been explained by biology in\nnaturalistic terms, similarly values appear to be magical and yet they\ncan be explained naturally (Alexander 1939: 282). Alexander goes on to\nargue that Darwin’s theory of evolution plays an important role in the\ndevelopment of value: \n[T]he doctrine of natural selection may be described as the history of\nhow value makes its entry into the organic world. So far as it is a\nnecessary part of the process by which species are established, it is\nthe principle which constitutes the history of value, for it shows how\nthe mere interests of individual organisms come to be well-founded and\nto be values. (Alexander 1933: 287) \nThe idea is that, for animals, things that have value are usually\nthose that will further the survival of the species, such as food.\nAnimals whose interests do not help to maintain their existence\nsuccumb under the conditions of their existence, and “leave the\nfield” for others. In this way, natural selection provides a\nhistory of value. More on this can be found in Alexander’s\n“Naturalism and Value” (reprinted in Alexander 1939). This\nintegration of the theory of evolution into Alexander’s aesthetics\nshould come as no surprise to us, being as it is a theme in\nAlexander’s larger work.  \n\nAlexander’s writings on art and value were well received in their day. \n[Alexander’s] happy blending of Herbert Spencer’s\npatient empiricism with the bolder systematic sweep of Bradley and the\ngiant figures of German idealism was nowhere more fruitful than in his\ntreatment of aesthetics. (Listowel 1939: 183) \nSecondary literature on them includes Listowel (1939), Fox (1934), Hooper\n (1950), and Innis (2017).  \n\n“The Historicity of Things” (1936) is one of Alexander’s\nlatest papers. It is valuable in part because it gives a concise\noverview of Alexander’s spacetime metaphysics in Alexander’s own\nwords. It is also valuable because it tackles an unusual theme: the\nrelationship between history and nature. Alexander argues that while\nsome of the contributions to philosophy from science are clear, it is\nless clear what philosophy can learn from history (Alexander 1936:\n12). Alexander argues that, as time and motion belong to the most\nfundamental level of reality, all that exists is\n“historical”. As such, science begins with history: \nHistory can claim to be mistress of science, as much as mathematics,\nthough in a different sense. They stand for the two vital elements in\nevery science which cannot be separated, if they can be considered\nseparately, the constructive process by which we discover by our\nthought the order inherent in things, and the raw material\nitself… It must be remembered, however, of course, that\nhistorical science is but one of the sciences which arise\nfrom the facts and happenings of the world. (Alexander 1936: 24) \nAlexander’s characterisation of history as having the whole world as\nits subject matter is interesting not least because it proved so\ncontroversial. Both R. G. Collingwood and Hilda Oakeley, two\nphilosophers of history associated with British idealism, took strong\nissue with Alexander’s description; see Collingwood’s\nreprinted Principles of History (1938 [1999: 56]) and Oakeley’s\n“The World as Memory and as History” (1925–6). \n\nBoth Oakeley and Collingwood corresponded with Alexander, and what has\nsurvived of their correspondence can be found in the Samuel Alexander\nPapers at the John Rylands Library. A lone piece of secondary\nliterature on the relationship between Collingwood and Alexander is\nO’Neill (2006).","contact.mail":"emily.thomas@cantab.net","contact.domain":"cantab.net"}]
