There are many contexts in which we\nspeak of a person or an institution as being tolerant: parents\ntolerate certain behavior of their children, a friend tolerates the\nweaknesses of another, a monarch tolerates dissent, a church tolerates\nhomosexuality, a state tolerates a minority religion, a society\ntolerates deviant behavior. Thus for any analysis of the motives and\nreasons for toleration, the relevant contexts need to be taken into\naccount.\n\nIt is necessary to differentiate between a general concept\nand more specific conceptions of toleration (see also Forst\n2013). The former is marked by the following characteristics. First,\nit is essential for the concept of toleration that the tolerated\nbeliefs or practices are considered to be objectionable and in an\nimportant sense wrong or bad. If this objection component\n(cf. King 1976, 44–54 on the components of toleration) is\nmissing, we do not speak of “toleration” but of\n“indifference” or “affirmation.” Second, the\nobjection component needs to be balanced by an acceptance\ncomponent, which does not remove the negative judgment but gives\ncertain positive reasons that trump the negative ones in the relevant\ncontext. In light of these reasons, it would be wrong not to tolerate\nwhat is wrong, to mention a well-known paradox of toleration\n(discussed below). The said practices or beliefs are wrong, but not\nintolerably wrong. Third, the limits of toleration need to be\nspecified. They lie at the point where there are reasons for rejection\nthat are stronger than the reasons for acceptance (which still leaves\nopen the question of the appropriate means of a possible\nintervention); call this the rejection component.\nAll three of those reasons can be of one and the same\nkind—religious, for example—yet they can also be of\ndiverse kinds (moral, religious, pragmatic, to mention a few\npossibilities; cf. Newey 1999, 32–34 and Cohen 2014). \nFurthermore, it needs to be stressed that there are two\nboundaries involved in this interpretation of the concept of\ntoleration: the first one lies between (1) the normative realm of\nthose practices and beliefs one agrees with and (2) the realm of the\npractices and beliefs that one finds wrong but can still tolerate; the\nsecond boundary lies between this latter realm and (3) the realm of\nthe intolerable that is strictly rejected. There are thus three, not\njust two normative realms in a context of toleration. \nFinally, one can only speak of toleration where it is practiced\nvoluntarily and is not compelled, for otherwise it would be a\ncase of simply “suffering” or “enduring”\ncertain things that one rejects but against which one is powerless. It\nis, however, wrong to conclude from this that the tolerant need to be\nin a position to effectively prohibit or interfere with the tolerated\npractices, for a minority that does not have this power may very well\nbe tolerant in holding the view that if it had such power, it would\nnot use it to suppress other parties (cf. Williams 1996). \nBased on these characteristics, we can identify three paradoxes of\ntoleration that are much discussed in philosophical analyses of the\nconcept, and each one refers to one of the components mentioned above.\nFirst, there is the paradox of the tolerant racist, which\nconcerns the objection component. Sometimes people argue that someone\nwho believes that there are “inferior races” the members\nof which do not deserve equal respect should be “more\ntolerant.” Thus the racist would be called tolerant if he curbed\nhis desire to discriminate against the members of such groups, say,\nfor strategic reasons. Thus if (and only if) we considered tolerance\nto be a moral virtue, the paradox arises that an immoral attitude (to\nthink of other “races” in such way) would be turned into\npart of a virtue. What is more, the racist would be more\n“tolerant” the stronger his racist impulses are if only he\ndid not act on them (cf. Horton 1996). Hence, seen from a moral\nperspective, the demand that the racist should be tolerant has a major\nflaw: it takes the racist objection against others as an ethical\nobjection that only needs to be restrained by adding certain reasons\nfor acceptance. It thus turns an unacceptable prejudice into an\nethical judgment. From this it follows that the reasons for objection\nmust be reasonable in a minimal sense; they cannot be generally\nshareable, of course, but they must also not rest on irrational\nprejudice and hatred. The racist, therefore, can neither exemplify the\nvirtue of tolerance nor should he be asked to be tolerant; what is\nnecessary is that he overcome his racist beliefs. This shows that\nthere are cases in which tolerance is not the solution to\nintolerance. \nSecond, we encounter the paradox of moral tolerance, which\narises in connection with the acceptance component (for various\nanalyses of this paradox, see Ebbinghaus 1950, Raphael 1988, Mendus\n1989, Horton 1994). If both the reasons for objection and the reasons\nfor acceptance are called “moral,” the paradox arises that\nit seems to be morally right or even morally required to tolerate what\nis morally wrong. The solution of this paradox therefore requires a\ndistinction between various kinds of “moral” reasons, some\nof which must be reasons of a higher order that ground and limit\ntoleration. \nThird, there is the paradox of drawing the limits, which\nconcerns the rejection component. This paradox is inherent in the idea\nthat toleration is a matter of reciprocity and that therefore those\nwho are intolerant need not and cannot be tolerated, an idea we find\nin most of the classical texts on toleration. But even a brief look at\nthose texts, and even more so at historical practice, shows that the\nslogan “no toleration of the intolerant” is not just\nvacuous but potentially dangerous, for the characterization of certain\ngroups as intolerant is all too often itself a result of one-sidedness\nand intolerance. In a deconstructivist reading, this leads to a fatal\nconclusion for the concept of toleration (cf. Fish 1997): If\ntoleration always implies a drawing of the limits against the\nintolerant and intolerable, and if every such drawing of a limit is\nitself a (more or less) intolerant, arbitrary act, toleration ends as\nsoon it begins—as soon as it is defined by an arbitrary boundary\nbetween “us” and the “intolerant” and\n“intolerable.” This paradox can only be overcome if we\ndistinguish between two notions of “intolerance” that the\ndeconstructivist critique conflates: the intolerance of those who lie\nbeyond the limits of toleration because they deny toleration as a norm\nin the first place, and the lack of tolerance of those who do not want\nto tolerate a denial of the norm. Tolerance can only be a virtue if\nthis distinction can be made, and it presupposes that the limits of\ntoleration can be drawn in a non-arbitrary, justifiable way. \nThe discussion so far implies that toleration is a normatively\ndependent concept. This means that by itself it cannot provide\nthe substantive reasons for objection, acceptance, and rejection. It\nneeds further, independent normative resources in order to have a\ncertain substance, content, and limits—and in order to be\nregarded as something good at all. In itself, therefore, toleration is\nnot a virtue or value; it can only be a value if backed by the right\nnormative reasons. \nThe following discussion of four conceptions of toleration is not to\nbe understood as the reconstruction of a linear historical succession.\nRather, these are different, historically developed understandings of\nwhat toleration consists in that can all be present in society at the\nsame time, so that conflicts about the meaning of toleration may also\nbe understood as conflicts between these conceptions (cf. Forst\n2013). \n1. The first one I call the permission conception. According\nto it, toleration is a relation between an authority or a majority and\na dissenting, “different” minority (or various\nminorities). Toleration then means that the authority gives qualified\npermission to the minority to live according to their beliefs on\ncondition that the minority accepts the dominant position of the\nauthority or majority. So long as their being different remains within\ncertain limits, that is, in the “private” realm, and so\nlong as the minority groups do not claim equal public and political\nstatus, they can be tolerated on pragmatic or principled\ngrounds—on pragmatic grounds because this form of toleration is\nthe least costly of all possible alternatives and does not disturb\ncivil peace and order as the dominant party defines it (but rather\ncontributes to it); and on principled grounds because one may think it\nis morally problematic to force people to give up certain deep-seated\nbeliefs or practices. \nThe permission conception is a classic one that we find in many\nhistorical writings and in instances of a politics of toleration (such\nas the Edict of Nantes in 1598) and that—to a considerable\nextent—still informs our understanding of the term. According to\nthis conception, toleration means that the authority or majority,\nwhich has the power to interfere with the practices of a minority,\nnevertheless “tolerates” it, while the minority accepts\nits inferior position. The situation or the “terms of\ntoleration” are hierarchical: one party allows another party\ncertain things on conditions specified by the first one. Toleration is\nthus understood as permissio negativa mali: not interfering\nwith something that is actually wrong but not\n“intolerably” harmful. It is this conception that Goethe\n(1829, 507, transl. R.F.) had in mind when he said: “Tolerance\nshould be a temporary attitude only: it must lead to recognition. To\ntolerate means to insult.” \n2. The second conception, the coexistence conception, is\nsimilar to the first one in regarding toleration as the best means\ntoward ending or avoiding conflict and toward pursuing one’s own\ngoals. What is different, however, is the relationship between the\nsubjects and the objects of toleration. For now the situation is not\none of an authority or majority in relation to a minority, but one of\ngroups that are roughly equal in power, and who see that for the sake\nof social peace and the pursuit of their own interests mutual\ntoleration is the best of all possible alternatives (the Augsburg\nPeace Treaty of 1555 is a historical example). They prefer peaceful\ncoexistence to conflict and agree to a reciprocal compromise, to a\ncertain modus vivendi. The relation of tolerance is no longer\nvertical but horizontal: the subjects are at the same time the objects\nof toleration. This may not lead to a stable social situation in which\ntrust can develop, for once the constellation of power changes, the\nmore powerful group may no longer see any reasons for being tolerant\n(cf. Rawls 1987, 11, Fletcher 1996). \n3. Different from this, the third conception of toleration—the\nrespect conception—is one in which the tolerating\nparties respect one another in a more reciprocal sense (cf. Weale\n1985, Scanlon 1996). Even though they differ fundamentally in their\nethical beliefs about the good and true way of life and in their\ncultural practices, citizens recognize one another as moral-political\nequals in the sense that their common framework of social life\nshould—as far as fundamental questions of rights and liberties\nand the distribution of resources are concerned—be guided by\nnorms that all parties can equally accept and that do not favor one\nspecific ethical or cultural community (cf. Forst 2002, ch. 2). \nThere are two models of the “respect conception,” that of\n“formal equality,” and that of “qualitative\nequality.” The former operates on a strict distinction between\nthe political and the private realm, according to which ethical (i.e.,\ncultural or religious) differences among citizens of a legal state\nshould be confined to the private realm, so that they do not lead to\nconflicts in the political sphere. This version is clearly exhibited\nin the “secular republicanism” of the French authorities\nwho held that headscarves with a religious meaning have no place in\npublic schools in which children are educated to be autonomous\ncitizens (cf. Galeotti 1993). \nThe model of “qualitative equality,” on the other hand,\nrecognizes that certain forms of formal equality favor those\nethical-cultural life-forms whose beliefs and practices make it easier\nto accommodate a conventional public/private distinction. In other\nwords, the “formal equality” model tends to be intolerant\ntoward ethical-cultural forms of life that require a public presence\nthat is different from traditional and hitherto dominant cultural\nforms. Thus, on the “qualitative equality” model, persons\nrespect each other as political equals with a certain distinct\nethical-cultural identity that needs to be respected and tolerated as\nsomething that is (a) especially important for a person and (b) can\nprovide good reasons for certain exceptions from or general changes in\nexisting legal and social structures. Social and political equality\nand integration are thus seen to be compatible with cultural\ndifference—within certain (moral) limits of reciprocity. \n4. In discussions of toleration, one finds alongside the conceptions\nmentioned thus far a fourth one which I call the esteem\nconception. This implies an even fuller, more demanding notion of\nmutual recognition between citizens than the respect conception does.\nHere, being tolerant does not just mean respecting members of other\ncultural life-forms or religions as moral and political equals, it\nalso means having some kind of ethical esteem for their beliefs, that\nis, taking them to be ethically valuable conceptions that—even\nthough different from one’s own—are in some way ethically\nattractive and held with good reasons. For this still to be a case of\ntoleration, the kind of esteem characteristic of these relations is\nsomething like “reserved esteem,” that is, a kind of\npositive acceptance of a belief that for some reason you still find is\nnot as attractive as the one you hold. As valuable as parts of the\ntolerated belief may be, it also has other parts that you find\nmisguided, or wrong (cf. Raz 1988, Sandel 1989). \nTo answer the question which of these conceptions should be the\nguiding one for a given society, two aspects are most important. The\nfirst one requires an assessment of the conflicts that require and\nallow for toleration, given the history and character of the groups\ninvolved; and the second requires an adequate and convincing normative\njustification of toleration in a given social context. It is important\nto keep in mind that the (normatively dependent) concept of toleration\nitself does not provide such a justification; this has to come from\nother normative resources. And the list of such resources, speaking\nboth historically and systematically, is long. \nIn the course of the religious-political conflicts throughout Europe\nthat followed the Reformation, toleration became one of the central\nconcepts of political-philosophical discourse, yet its history reaches\nmuch further back into antiquity (for the following, see esp. Forst\n2013, part 1; cf. also Besier and Schreiner 1990, Nederman 2000,\nZagorin 2003, Creppel 2003, Kaplan 2007 and Bejan 2017). In stoic\nwritings, especially in Cicero, tolerantia is used as a term\nfor a virtue of endurance, of suffering bad luck, pain and injustice\nof various kinds in a proper, steadfast manner. But already in early\nChristian discourse, the term is applied to the challenge of coping\nwith religious difference and conflict. The works of Tertullian and\nCyprianus are most important in that respect. \nWithin the Christian framework, a number of arguments for toleration\nhave been developed, based on charity and love for those who err, for\nexample, or on the idea of the two kingdoms and of limited human\nauthority in matters of religious truth, i.e., in matters of the\ndivine kingdom. The most important and far-reaching justification of\ntoleration, however, is the principle credere non potest nisi\nvolens, which holds that only faith based on inner conviction is\npleasing to God, and that such faith has to develop from within,\nwithout external compulsion. Conscience therefore must not be and\ncannot be forced to adopt a certain faith, even if it were the true\none. Yet, Augustine who defends these arguments in his earlier\nwritings, later (when confronted with the danger of a schism between\nRoman Catholics and the so-called Donatists) came to the conclusion\nthat the same reasons of love, of the two kingdoms and of the freedom\nof conscience could also make intolerance and the use of force into a\nChristian duty, if it were the only way to save the soul of another\n(esp. Augustine 408, letter # 93). He cites numerous examples of\nreconverted Catholics to substantiate his position that the proper use\nof force combined with the right teaching can shake men loose from the\nwrong faith and open up their eyes so as to accept the\ntruth—still “from within.” Accordingly, individual\nconscience can and sometimes must be subjected to force. Christian\narguments thus both form the core of many modern justifications of\ntoleration and yet are janus-faced, always bound by the superior aim\nto serve the true faith. Similar to Augustine, Thomas Aquinas later\ndeveloped a number of reasons for limited and conditional toleration,\ndrawing especially strong limits against tolerating any form of\nheresy. \nThe question of peaceful coexistence of different\nfaiths—Christian, Jewish and Muslim—was much discussed in\nthe Middle Ages, especially in the 12th century. Abailard\nand Raimundus Lullus wrote inter-religious dialogues searching for\nways of defending the truth of Christian faith while also seeing some\ntruth—religious or at least ethical—in other religions. In\nJudaism and Islam, this was mirrored by writers such as Maimonides or\nIbn Rushd (Averroes), whose defense of philosophical truth-searching\nagainst religious dogma is arguably the most innovative of the period\n(see esp. Averroes 1180). \nNicolas of Cusa’s De Pace Fidei (1453) marks an\nimportant step towards a more comprehensive, Christian-humanist\nconception of toleration, though in the conversations among\nrepresentatives of different faiths his core idea of “one\nreligion in various rites” remains a Catholic one. Still, the\nsearch for common elements is a central, increasingly important topic\nin toleration discourses. This is much further developed in Erasmus of\nRotterdam’s humanist idea of a possible religious unity based on\na reduced core faith, trying to avoid religious strife about what\nErasmus saw as non-essential questions of faith\n(adiaphora). \nIn contrast with this “irenic” humanist approach, Luther\ndefended the protestant idea of the individual conscience bound only\nto the word of God, which marks the limits of the authority of the\nchurch as well as of the secular powers of the state (Luther 1523).\nThe traditional arguments of free conscience and of the two kingdoms\nwere radicalized in this period. The protestant humanist Sebastian\nCastellio (1554) attacks the intolerance of both Catholic and\nCalvinist practices and argues for the freedom of conscience and\nreason as prerequisites of true faith. In this period, decisive\nelements of early modern toleration discourse were formed: the\ndistinction between church authority and individual religious\nconscience on the one hand and the separation of religious and secular\nauthority on the other. \nJean Bodin’s work is important for the further development of\nmodern ideas of toleration in two ways. In his Six Books of a\nCommonweal (1576), he develops a purely political justification\nof toleration, following the thought of the so-called\nPolitiques, whose main concern was the stability of the\nstate. For them, the preservation of political sovereignty took\nprimacy over the preservation of religious unity, and toleration was\nrecommended as a superior policy in a situation of religious plurality\nand strife. This, however, does not amount to the (late modern) idea\nof a fully secular state with general religious liberty. More radical\nstill is Bodin’s religious-philosophical work on the\nColloquium of the Seven (1593), a discourse among\nrepresentatives of different faiths who disagree about fundamental\nreligious and metaphysical issues. For the first time in the tradition\nof religious discourse, in Bodin’s work there is no dominant\nposition, no obvious winners or losers. The agreement that the\nparticipants in the conversation find is based on respect for the\nothers and on the insight that religious differences, even though they\ncan be meaningfully discussed, cannot be resolved in a philosophical\ndiscourse by means of reason alone. Religious plurality is seen here\nas an enduring predicament of finite and historically situated human\nbeings, not as a state to be overcome by the victory of the one and\nonly true faith. \nMarked by bitter religious conflicts, the 17th century\nbrought forth a number of toleration theories, among them three\nparadigmatic classics: Baruch de Spinoza’s Tractatus\nTheologico-Politicus (1670), Pierre Bayle’s Commentaire\nPhilosophique (1686) and John Locke’s A Letter\nConcerning Toleration (1689). In his historical critique of\nbiblical religions Spinoza locates their core in the virtues of\njustice and love and separates it from both contested religious dogmas\nand from the philosophical search for truth. The state has the task of\nrealizing peace and justice, thus it has the right to regulate the\nexternal exercise of religion. The natural right to freedom of thought\nand judgment and to “inner” religion cannot, however, be\nentrusted to the state; here political authority finds the factual\nlimits of its power. \nBayle’s Commentaire is the most comprehensive attempt\nto refute the arguments for the duty of intolerance that go back to\nAugustine (and especially his interpretation of the parable\n“compel them to come in,” where the master orders his\nservants to force those who were invited to the prepared supper but\ndid not attend to come in; see Luke 14, 15ff.). In his elaborate\nargument against the use of force in matters of religion, Bayle does\nnot primarily take recourse to the idea that religious conscience must\nnot and cannot be forced, for he was aware of the powerful Augustinian\narguments against both points (cf. Forst 2008 and Kilcullen 1988).\nRather, Bayle argued that there is a “natural light” of\npractical reason revealing certain moral truths to every sincere\nperson, regardless of his or her faith, even including atheists. And\nsuch principles of moral respect and of reciprocity cannot be trumped\nby religious truths, according to Bayle, for reasonable religious\nfaith is aware that ultimately it is based on personal faith and\ntrust, not on apprehensions of objective truth. This has often been\nseen as a skeptical argument, yet this is not what Bayle intended;\nwhat he suggested, rather, was that the truths of religion are of a\ndifferent epistemological character than truths arrived at by the use\nof reason alone. Connecting moral and epistemological arguments in\nthis way, Bayle was the first thinker to try to develop a universally\nvalid argument for toleration, one that implied universal toleration\nof persons of different faiths as well as of those seen as lacking any\nfaith. \nIn important respects, this is a more radical theory than the (much\nmore popular and influential) one developed by Locke, who\ndistinguishes between state and church in an early liberal perspective\nof natural individual rights. While it is the duty of the state to\nsecure the “civil interests” of its citizens, the\n“care of the soul” cannot be its business, this being a\nmatter between the individual and God to whom alone one is responsible\nin this regard. Hence there is a God-given, inalienable right to the\nfree exercise of religion. Churches are no more than voluntary\nassociations without any right to use force within a legitimate\npolitical order based on the consent of the governed. Locke draws the\nlimits of toleration where a religion does not accept its proper place\nin civil society (such as Catholicism, in Locke’s eyes) as well\nas where atheists deny any higher moral authority and therefore\ndestroy the basis of social order. \nIn the 18th century, the conception of a secular state with\nan independent basis of authority and the distinction between the\nroles of citizen and believer in a certain faith were further\ndeveloped, even though Locke’s thought that a stable political\norder did require some common religious basis persisted (with a few\nexceptions, such as the French materialists). In the course of the\nAmerican and the French Revolutions a basic “natural”\nright to religious liberty was recognized, even though the\ninterpretations of what kind of religious dissent could be tolerated\ndiffered. \nThinkers of the French Enlightenment argued for toleration on various\ngrounds and, as in Bodin, there was a difference between a focus on\npolitical stability and a focus on religious coexistence. In his\nOn the Spirit of the Laws (1748), Montesquieu argues for the\ntoleration of different religions for the purpose of preserving\npolitical unity and peace, yet he warns that there is a limit to the\nacceptance of new religions or changes to the dominant one, given the\nconnection between a constitution and the morality and habits of a\npeople. In his Persian Letters (1721), however, he had\ndeveloped a more comprehensive theory of religious pluralism. The\ndifference between the two perspectives—political and\ninter-religious—is even more notable in Jean-Jacques\nRousseau’s writings. In his Social Contract (1762), he\ntries to overcome religious strife and intolerance by\ninstitutionalizing a “civic religion” that must be shared\nby all, while in his Emile (1762) he argues for the primacy\nof individual conscience as well as for the aim of a non-dogmatic\n“natural religion.” \nThe idea of a “religion of reason” as an alternative to\nestablished religions for the sake of overcoming the quarrels between\nthem was typical for the Enlightenment, and is found in thinkers such\nas Voltaire, Diderot and Kant. In his parable of the rings (which goes\nback to medieval precursors) in the play Nathan the Wise\n(1779), G. E. Lessing offers a powerful image for the peaceful\ncompetition of established religions that both underlines their common\nancestry as well as their differences due to multiple historical\ntraditions of faith. Since there is no objective proof as to their\ntruth for the time being, they are called upon to deliver such proof\nby acting morally and harmoniously until the end of time. \nJohn Stuart Mill’s On Liberty (1859) marks the\ntransition to a modern conception of toleration, one that is no longer\noccupied with the question of religious harmony and does not restrict\nthe issue of toleration to religious differences. In Mill’s\neyes, in modern society toleration is also required to cope with other\nforms of irreconcilable cultural, social and political plurality. Mill\noffers three main arguments for toleration. According to his\n“harm principle,” the exercise of political or social\npower is only legitimate if necessary to prevent serious harm done to\none person by another, not to enforce some idea of the good in a\npaternalistic manner. Toleration towards opinions is justified by the\nutilitarian consideration that not just true, but also false opinions\nlead to productive social learning processes. Finally, toleration\ntowards unusual “experiments of living” is justified in a\nromantic way (following Wilhelm von Humboldt), stressing the values of\nindividuality and originality. \nThe story of toleration would have to be continued after Mill up to\nthe present, yet this short overview might suffice to draw attention\nto the long and complex history of the concept and to the many forms\nit took as well as the different justifications offered for it. Seen\nhistorically, toleration has been many things: An exercise of love for\nthe other who errs, a strategy of preserving power by offering some\nform of freedom to minorities, a term for the peaceful coexistence of\ndifferent faiths who share a common core, another word for the respect\nfor individual liberty, a postulate of practical reason, or the\nethical promise of a productive pluralistic society. \nMany of the systematic arguments for toleration—be they\nreligious, pragmatic, moral or epistemological—can be used as a\njustification for more than one of the conceptions of toleration\nmentioned above (section 2). The classic argument for freedom of\nconscience, for example, has been used to justify arrangements\naccording to the “permission conception” as well as the\n“respect conception.” Generally speaking, relations of\ntoleration are hierarchically ordered according to the first\nconception, quite unstable according to the conception of\n“coexistence,” while the “esteem conception”\nis the most demanding in terms of the kind of mutual appreciation\nbetween the tolerating parties. In each case, the limits of toleration\nseem either arbitrary or too narrow, as in the esteem conception,\nwhich only allows toleration of those beliefs and practices that can\nbe ethically valued. \nAccordingly, in current philosophical discussions of toleration in\nmulticultural, modern societies, the “respect conception”\nis often seen as the most appropriate and promising. Yet in these\ndiscussions, toleration as “respect” can be justified in\ndifferent ways. An ethical-liberal, neo-Lockean justification argues\nthat respect is owed to individuals as personally and ethically\nautonomous beings with the capacity to choose, possibly revise and\nrealize an individual conception of the good. This capacity is to be\nrespected and furthered because it is seen as a necessary (though not\nsufficient) condition for attaining the good life (cf. Kymlicka 1995).\nHence the argument presupposes a specific thesis about the good\nlife—i.e., that only an autonomously chosen way of life can be a\ngood life—which can, however, reasonably be questioned. One may\ndoubt whether such a way of life will necessarily be subjectively more\nfulfilling or objectively more valuable than one adopted in a more\ntraditional way, without the presence of a range of options to choose\nfrom. Apart from that, the ethical-liberal theory could lead to a\nperfectionist justification of policies designed to further individual\nautonomy that could have a paternalistic character and lack toleration\nfor non-liberal ways of life. In other words, there is the danger of\nan insufficient distinction between the components of objection and\nrejection mentioned above (section 1). \nThus, an alternative, neo-Baylean justification of the respect\nconception seeks to avoid a particular conception of the good life,\nrelying instead on the discursive principle of justification which\nsays that every norm that is to be binding for a plurality of persons,\nespecially norms that are the basis of legal coercion, must be\njustifiable with reasons that are reciprocally acceptable to all\naffected as free and equal persons. Such persons have a basic\n“right to justification” (Forst 2012a) which gives them\nthe power to reject one-sided ethical or religious justifications for\ngeneral norms. For a complete argument for toleration, however, this\nnormative component has to be accompanied by an epistemological\ncomponent which says that ethical or religious reasons, if\nreciprocally contested, cannot be sufficient to justify the exercise\nof force, since their validation depends on a particular faith that\ncan reasonably be rejected by others who do not share it; its validity\nreaches into a realm “beyond reason,” as Bayle said (see\nalso similar arguments by Rawls 1993, ch. 2, and Larmore 1996, ch. 7).\nThus toleration consists of the insight that reasons of ethical\nobjection, even if deeply held, cannot be valid as general\nreasons of rejection so long as they are reciprocally\nrejectable as belonging to a conception of the good or true way of\nlife that is not and need not be shareable. While such a distinction\nbetween ethical reasons for objection and stronger, morally\njustifiable reasons for rejection tries to overcome the “paradox\nof moral tolerance” (see section 1 above), the “paradox of\ndrawing the limits” would be solved by seeing as tolerable all\nsuch views or practices that do not violate the principle of\njustification itself (see Forst 2013). \nWith such a reflexive turn in the debate about toleration, a number of\nquestions arise as to the alleged superior validity of the principle\nof justification and the plausibility of a neo-Baylean epistemology\ndistinguishing between faith and knowledge. Can there be an impartial\njustification that is not in the same way a “party” to the\ncontest of ethical truths and world-views? Might there be the\npossibility, using a phrase John Rawls (1993) coined in the context of\nhis theory of justice, of a “tolerant” theory of\ntoleration that is at the same time substantive enough to ground and\nlimit toleration? \nAny concrete use of the concept of toleration is always situated in\nparticular contexts of normative and political conflict, especially in\nsocieties that are transforming towards increased religious, ethical\nand cultural pluralism – even more so when societies are marked\nby an increased awareness of such pluralism, with some cultural groups\nraising new claims for recognition and others looking at their\nco-citizens with suspicion, despite having lived together for some\ntime in the past. These social conflicts always involve group-based\nclaims for recognition, both in the legal and in the social sphere\n(see generally Patten 2014, Galeotti 2002). Contemporary debate has\nfocused on questions of respecting particular religious practices and\nbeliefs, ranging from certain manners of dress, including the burka,\nto certain demands to be free from blasphemy and religious insults\n(Laborde 2008, Newey 2013, Nussbaum 2012, Leiter 2014, Taylor and\nStepan 2014, Modood 2013, Forst 2013, ch. 12). The general questions\nraised here include: What is special about religious as opposed to\nother cultural identities (Laborde and Bardon 2017)? When is equal\nrespect called for and what exactly does it imply with respect to, for\nexample, norms of gender equality (see Okin et al. 1999, Song 2007)?\nWhat role do past injustices play in weighing claims for recognition,\nand how much room can there be for autonomous forms of life in a\ndeeply pluralistic society (Tully 1995, Williams 2000)? \nOther connected and intensely debated issues of toleration include\nfree speech and “hate speech,” (Butler 1997, Waldron 2012,\nGerstenfeld 2013) as well as the ways in which new forms of digital\ncommunication change the nature of social and political discourse\n(Barnett 2007). \nFinally, in light of Goethe’s remark that to tolerate also means\nto insult, those working from the perspective of a critical theory of\ntoleration discuss how power can be exercised not only by denying\ntoleration but also by disciplining when granting toleration (Brown\n2006, Brown and Forst 2014). As much as a politics of toleration aims\nto express mutual respect, it also involves disagreement, mutual\ncriticism, and rejection. We still face the challenge of examining the\ngrounds and forms of a politics of toleration as an emancipatory form\nof politics.
