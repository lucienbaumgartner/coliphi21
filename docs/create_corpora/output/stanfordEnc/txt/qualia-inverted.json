The most popular kind is one or another variant of Locke’s\nhypothetical case of “spectrum inversion”, in which\nstrawberries and ripe tomatoes produce visual experiences of the sort\nthat are actually produced by grass and cucumbers, grass and cucumbers\nproduce experiences of the sort that are actually produced by\nstrawberries and ripe tomatoes, and so on. This entry surveys the main\nphilosophical applications of what Dennett has called “one of\nphilosophy’s most virulent memes” (1991, 389).\n\n\n\nSection 1 explains what “qualia” are supposed to be.\nSection 2 describes the many different sorts of “inverted\nqualia” (specifically, “inverted spectrum”) thought\nexperiments, including a close cousin that does not involve inversion.\nSection 3 discusses the major philosophical arguments that appeal to\nspectrum inversion.\n\n\n\nThis article is long and goes into intricate details that some readers\nwill wish to ignore. Those wanting a shorter introduction should read\nsection 1 (skipping subsection 1.1), section 2 (subsections 2.1, 2.2,\n2.3), and subsection 3.1. (Another shorter introduction is Ross 2020.)\nThose new to the topic should first read the entry on\n qualia.\n\n\n\nQualia (singular ‘quale’), in a common modern usage, are\nproperties of experiences that type them in phenomenological respects.\nImagine seeing three colored patches against a neutral background in\ngood light, one after the other. In particular, imagine seeing a\nvermilion patch, then a crimson patch, and finally a turquoise patch.\n(Those with poor imaginations may consult Figure 1.) Figure 1:\nvermilion, crimson, and turquoise patches \n\nThree experiences of the imagined sort differ in their\nphenomenology, or in “what it’s like” to undergo them. What\nit’s like to see the crimson patch is not the same as what it’s like to\nsee the turquoise patch, for example. Further—assuming you have\nnormal color vision—seeing the crimson patch is more similar,\nin phenomenological respects, to seeing the vermilion patch than it is\nto seeing the turquoise patch. \n\nThus your experience of the crimson patch has a quale (call it\n‘\\(Q_{C}\\)’) that your experiences of\nthe vermilion and turquoise patches lack. Your experience of the\nvermilion patch has a quale \\((Q_{V})\\) that your\nexperiences of the crimson and turquoise patches lack; likewise, your\nexperience of the turquoise patch has quale\n\\(Q_{T}\\). What about an experience of all three\npatches, as when viewing the whole of figure 1? Which of\n\\(Q_{C}, Q_{V}\\), and\n\\(Q_{T}\\) does that have? The answer usually\nimplicit in the literature is ‘All three’ (as opposed to\n ‘None’).[1]\n This is probably the more natural way of\nunderstanding qualia terminology, given the explanation so far, and is\nthe one adopted in this article. \n\nIn addition to the quale \\(Q_{C}\\), your\nexperience of the crimson patch has quale\n\\(Q_{R}\\) which it shares with your experiences\nof the vermilion patch, blood, fire trucks, strawberries, ripe\ntomatoes, and so on. Your experience of the turquoise patch (in\nisolation) lacks \\(Q_{R}\\). \n\nIt must be emphasized that\n‘\\(Q_{C}\\)’, for example, is not\nexplicitly defined using color terminology.\n‘\\(Q_{C}\\)’ is not stipulated to be\nan abbreviation of ‘the property of being an experience of\nsomething’s looking crimson’, for instance. Rather, the role of\ndescriptions like the latter is simply to draw attention to the salient\nproperty that ‘\\(Q_{C}\\)’ is supposed\nto be a name for, in much the same way that one might introduce the\nunfamiliar name ‘Eugene Cernan’ by saying that it refers to\nthe last man to walk on the moon. In the jargon, the description\n‘the property of being an experience of something’s looking\ncrimson’ can be used to fix the reference of\n‘\\(Q_{C}\\)’. (See the entry on\n reference.) \n\nQualia terminology can be introduced in a similar manner for other\nsorts of visual experiences (seeing differently shaped patches, for\ninstance), for other perceptual modalities, for bodily sensations, and\nfor thoughts, imagery, emotions, and so forth. It is controversial\nwhether some of these mental events/states have qualia—in\nparticular, episodes of conscious thought, at least some of which seem\ndevoid of\n phenomenology.[2] \n\nOne might wonder why some special terminology is required.\nAdmittedly ‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’, for example,\nis not defined in terms of ‘red’, but isn’t\n\\(Q_{R}\\) in fact the property of being an\nexperience of something’s looking\n red?[3]\n And if it is, why\nintroduce another name? However, as discussed later (subsection 3.2),\nthere is an argument against this identification. \n\n‘Qualia’ is an especially confusing piece of\nterminology, even by the standards of the profession that brought us\n‘realism’. In the sense just explained, the claim that\nexperiences have qualia seems fairly\n harmless.[4]\n The innocent student\nmight well be puzzled, then, to learn of Frank Jackson’s controversial\n“knowledge argument for qualia” (Jackson 1982), and\nDennett’s attempt to dismiss qualia as a philosopher’s invention\n(Dennett 1988). But on closer examination, much of this apparent\ndisagreement is merely terminological. On Jackson’s use of the term,\nqualia are properties of mental states “which no amount of purely\nphysical information includes” (1982, 273); on Dennett’s, they\nare “ineffable”, “intrinsic”,\n“private”, and “directly or immediately apprehensible\nin consciousness” (1988, 229; cf. Tye 2002, 447). And none of\nthis is part of the official explanation of ‘qualia’ in the\nprevious section. \n\nAnother use of ‘qualia’ that is particularly important\nto distinguish from the present one is Dretske’s. According to Dretske,\nqualia include colors—properties of objects like\ntomatoes, not experiences. This is because he explains qualia as\n“the ways objects phenomenally appear or seem” (1995, 73),\nand red is one way that tomatoes\n appear.[5]\n Qualia, on Dretske’s\nuse, are properties of objects of experiences; in this article\nqualia are properties of experiences. \n\nThe American pragmatist C. I. Lewis introduced ‘qualia’\ninto contemporary\n philosophy.[6]\n Qualia, he explains in Mind and the\nWorld Order, are “recognizable qualitative characters of the\ngiven” (1929, 121). According to Lewis, what is\n“given” in experience are sense-data (although Lewis\nhimself preferred other terminology: see 55–7), not objects like\ntomatoes. Goodman’s well-known discussion of qualia in The\nStructure of Appearance (1951) follows Lewis’s use. Among\nJackson, Dennett, and Dretske, Dretske’s use of ‘qualia’ is\nthe closest to Lewis’s. Restricting attention to the case of veridical\nperception, we may think of Dretske as basically agreeing with Lewis\nabout the characterization of qualia, but disagreeing with Lewis about\nthe given. When one sees that a tomato is red, according to Lewis a\nsense-datum, not the tomato, is given; according to Dretske what is\ngiven is the tomato. So, since a “recognizable qualitative\ncharacter” of the tomato is its color, Dretske thinks that colors\nare examples of\n qualia.[7] \n\nLet us say that a scenario is a (more-or-less detailed)\nstory, which may be possible or impossible. (So, for example, there is\na scenario in which someone squares the circle.) Corresponding to a\nscenario is what we can call a hypothesis: that the scenario\nis possible. So, for example, the hypothesis corresponding to\na circle-squaring scenario is false. There are a variety of\n“inverted qualia” scenarios in the literature—almost \nalways involving color perception—whose corresponding\nhypotheses differ in plausibility. These hypotheses are used as\npremises in a number of philosophical arguments, discussed in section 3\nbelow. \n\nConsider the hue circle in figure 2, taken from the Natural Color\nSystem color space, which is organized around the four hues red, green,\nblue, and\n yellow.[8]\n These are the unique hues:\nthey have shades that are not perceptual mixtures of any other hue. For\nexample, there is a shade of green that is neither bluish nor\nyellowish. The other hues are binary: all of their shades are\nperceptual mixtures of two unique hues. For example, every shade of\npurple is bluish and reddish. The four unique hues—yellow, red,\nblue, green—come in two opponent pairs: red-green and\nblue-yellow. Red is opposed to green in the sense that there are no\nreddish-greens or greenish-reds; likewise there are no bluish-yellows\nor yellowish-blues. The unique hues are equally spaced around the NCS\ncircle, and the other hues are spaced according to their perceptible\nproportion of the unique hues. So, for example, the orange patch\nequidistant from the unique yellow pole and unique red pole is equally\nsimilar to both. Figure 2:\nNCS hue circle[9] \n\nLet \\(I\\) be the function that takes each shade to its opposing\nshade, thus rotating the hue circle 180°. \\(I\\) maps reds to\ngreens, blues to yellows, bluish-greens to yellowish-reds, and so on\n(see figure 3). Figure 3:\nthe function \\(I\\) \n\nIntroduce another perceiver, Invert (you are Nonvert). Imagine you\nare looking at scene \\(S\\): an arrangement of some fruits (see the\nleft-hand part of figure 4). Now take the apparent hues of objects in\n\\(S\\), and transform them using the function \\(I\\). Use this\ntransformation to create a new scene \\(S_{I}\\), exactly\nlike the old scene \\(S\\) except that it looks to have differently\ncolored “inverted” fruits (etc.). That is, if a banana\noriginally looks to have hue \\(h\\), in \\(S_{I}\\) it\nlooks to have hue \\(I(h)\\). (See the right-hand part of\nfigure 4; notice that the greens in \\(S\\) are rather yellowish,\nand hence get mapped to bluish-reds.) Then one simple inverted qualia\nscenario is this: what it’s like for Invert to look at \\(S\\) is\nexactly the same as what it’s like for Nonvert (i.e., you) to look at\n\\(S_{I}\\), and similarly for all other scenes that Invert\nencounters. According to this scenario, if you look at the right-hand\npart of figure 4, your experience is phenomenologically the same as\nInvert’s experience when she looks at the left-hand part of figure 4.\nIn qualia terminology: if an object \\(O_{1}\\) looks to\nhave hue \\(h\\) to Nonvert (with \\(Q\\) being the corresponding\nquale of her experience), and \\(O_{2}\\) looks to have hue\n\\(I(h)\\) (with corresponding quale \\(Q^*\\)), then\nInvert’s experience of \\(O_{1}\\) has quale \\(Q^*\\) and\nher experience of \\(O_{2}\\) has quale \\(Q\\). In this\nsense Invert’s qualia are ‘inverted’ with respect to\nNonvert’s. Figure 4:\n180° hue inversion \n\nBecause the example concerns color qualia, this sort of inverted\nqualia scenario is usually described as a case of “spectrum\ninversion”. (Note that the 180° inversion takes unique hues\nto unique hues, and binary hues to binary hues. An inversion scenario\nproduced by a rotation of 45° would take the unique hue red to the\nbinary hue orange; and so presumably would be behaviorally detectable:\nsee subsection 2.3.1 below.) \n\nPhilosophy is stuck with the terminology of ‘spectrum\ninversion’, but it is potentially\n misleading.[10]\n First, a\nspectrum inversion scenario sounds like one which inverts either the\nspectrum or the colors of objects, but it actually inverts neither. In\na typical spectrum inversion scenario, the spectral band 650–700nm\nremains red, and lemons remain\n yellow.[11] \n\nSecond, even when properly taken as an inversion of experiences, one\nmight suppose that the “spectrum inversion” function\ncorresponds to flipping the spectrum over. That is, using the\ntraditional names for the spectral bands, one might suppose the\nfunction maps red to violet, orange to indigo, yellow to blue, green to\ngreen, blue to yellow, indigo to orange, and violet to red. However,\nthis is not the usual sort of inversion scenario (red is not mapped to\ngreen, for example). Further, this function is not defined for all\nhues. Many hues—in particular, a large range of\n“extra-spectral” purples—are not found in the\nspectrum. \n\nLocke appears to have been the first to formulate explicitly an\ninverted spectrum scenario. (An immediate precursor is \nMalebranche.[12]) \nIn the chapter of the Essay titled\nOf True and False Ideas, Locke writes: \n\nLocke’s description of this inverted spectrum scenario is laden with\nhis own commitment to “Ideas”, which (on one\ninterpretation) are sense-data, some of which possess both color and\n shape.[13]\n On this view, spectrum inversion is a case\nof “sense-datum inversion”: when Invert looks at a violet\nshe becomes acquainted with the kind of sense-datum Nonvert is\nacquainted with when he looks at a marigold. Setting this tendentious\ntheoretical gloss aside, Locke’s scenario has three notable features.\nFirst, it is a case of spectrum inversion from birth. Second,\nit is a case of inversion within the same linguistic\ncommunity. Third, it is (or is naturally read as being) a case in\nwhich Invert and Nonvert are behaviorally alike—a\nbehaviorally undetectable spectrum inversion. \n\nLocke does not fill in the details of his scenario, so it is left\nunclear whether, for example, the leaves of marigolds and violets would\nproduce “Red Ideas” in the mind of the inverted subject.\nBut suppose, reasonably enough, that Locke’s scenario involved a\nrotation of the hue circle. Locke evidently thought that the hypothesis\ncorresponding to his scenario was true: that his scenario is possible.\nWas he right? \n\nIf we assume that Invert is otherwise like a normal human perceiver,\nthen a major asymmetry in color space shows that Locke was incorrect.\nHue (red, green, bluish-red, etc.) is not the only perceptually salient\ndimension along which colors can vary: there are (usually taken to be)\ntwo other dimensions, saturation and\n lightness.[14]\n A color is saturated to the extent to\nwhich its hue is intense or vivid: pastels are desaturated, and\nachromatic colors (blacks, whites, and grays) have no saturation.\nColors become lighter as they become less grayish or blackened.\nArranging the colors along these three dimensions produces a color\nsolid, an example of which is shown in figure 5: Figure 5:\n3D color space: the Munsell color solid[15] \n\nThe lightness dimension corresponds to the central vertical axis,\nwith white at the top. The hue and saturation dimensions correspond,\nrespectively, to the angle around the vertical axis, and to the\ndistance from it. Thus the shades of maximum saturation are on the\noutside of the solid. Notice that the yellows have their maximum\nsaturation at higher levels of lightness than the reds and the blues.\nSo, assuming that Invert’s judgments of the relations between colors\nare—modulo the inversion—normal, a possible Lockean\n180° hue rotation scenario would be behaviorally detectable. Invert\nwould judge the maximally saturated colors she calls ‘shades of\nblue’ to be lighter than the maximally saturated colors she calls\n‘shades of yellow’. Further, there are more distinguishable\nhue steps between blue and red than there are between yellow and \ngreen—a fact that is reflected in the Munsell space, whose hue circle\nhas five hues equally spaced: red, yellow, green, blue, purple.\n(Contrast the NCS space mentioned in the previous subsection.) Hence\nthe Lockean inversion function \\(I\\), assuming it is defined on\nall hues, would map some distinct hues (in particular, some bluish\nreds) to the same hue (in particular, the same yellowish green). The\nrange of \\(I\\) would therefore contain fewer hues than its domain.\nInvert would not be able to distinguish some stimuli (those she calls\n‘bluish red’) that Nonvert could tell apart, and so again\nthe inversion would be behaviorally detectable. \n\nAs discussed in section 3 below, inverted spectrum scenarios have a\nwide range of philosophical uses, and come in a correspondingly wide\nrange of flavors. It is not always required, for example, that Invert\nand Nonvert are behaviorally alike. But suppose that a behaviorally\nundetectable scenario is needed, and moreover one that is genuinely\npossible. With the assumption that Invert is otherwise normal, we just\nsaw that Locke’s behaviorally undetectable scenario is not possible.\nWithout relaxing the simple assumption about Invert, can we find one\nthat is? \n\nSuppose we stay with the full range of normal human color\nexperience, and so with the color solid as illustrated in figure 5. The\ndiscussion of Locke’s scenario shows that a scenario corresponding to a\nrotation of the color solid around the lightness axis should be\navoided. However, as Palmer points out (1999a, 926), there are three\ninversion scenarios that at least solve the problem posed by the light\nand saturated yellows. These three scenarios correspond to,\nrespectively, a reversal of the red-green axis; a reversal of the\nblue-yellow and black-white axes; and the previous two reversals taken\ntogether: a reversal of the red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white\naxes. These three scenarios are (approximately) illustrated in Figure 6\nbelow. Figure 6:\nthree inversions: red-green (top right); blue-yellow/black-white (bottom left);\nred-green/blue-yellow/black-white (bottom right) \n\nAs noted in the previous subsection, there are more perceptually\ndistinguishable shades between red and blue than there are between\ngreen and yellow, which would make red-green inversion behaviorally\n detectable.[16]\n And there are yet further asymmetries.\nDark yellow is brown (qualitatively different from yellow), whereas\ndark blue is blue (see figure 6). Similarly, desaturated bluish-red is\npink (qualitatively different from saturated bluish-red), whereas\ndesaturated greenish-yellow is similar to saturated greenish-yellow.\nAgain, red is a “warm” color, whereas blue is\n“cool”—and perhaps this is not a matter of learned\nassociations with temperature (see Hardin 1997, 297–7). In any event,\nthere is clearly scope to resist the claim that one of Palmer’s three\ninversions would be behaviorally\n undetectable.[17] \n\nFaced with these difficulties, philosophers seeking a clearly\npossible behaviorally undetectable inversion scenario have either\nconsidered a perceiver with limited color vision (for instance\nblack-white vision), or else a perceiver with alien/quasi color vision,\nwhere any alien/quasi color space that represents perceptible\nsimilarities and differences is stipulated to have appropriate\nsymmetries. Here is Shoemaker trying the first strategy: \n\nFor some responses, see Tye 1995, 205, and Hilbert and Kalderon 2000,\n206. “Black-white” inversion is also discussed by Clark\n(1996) (Other Internet Resources), Myin (2001) and Broackes (2007), and was briefly\nmentioned by Wittgenstein (1977,\n III-84).[18]\n For a short autobiography of a complete\nachromat (someone with only black-white rod vision) who is also a\nvision scientist, see Nordby 1996 (Other Internet\n Resources).[19] \n\nHere is Block trying the second strategy: \n\nFor some doubts about the second strategy, see Hardin 1997,\n299–300. \n\nHilbert and Kalderon argue that “every possible quality space\nmust be asymmetrical” (2000, 204) (that is, must lack\nany symmetries); if so, both strategies are misguided (see also Dennett\n1991, 389–98; 1993, 927; 1994). \n\nIf a behaviorally undetectable spectrum inversion scenario is\npossible, how do we know it does not actually obtain? There is a\ntemptation to say that we do not know—moreover, that we cannot\nknow. (For more discussion, see subsection 3.6 below.) And if we cannot\nverify or falsify the claim that such a scenario does not obtain, then\naccording to the verificationist theory of meaning held by the logical\npositivists (Ayer 1959) the scenario is meaningless. Indeed, the\nlogical positivists sometimes gave spectrum inversion as an example of\nan unverifiable claim (Schlick 1932/3, 93, quoted in Shoemaker 1982,\n339; see also Ayer 1936, 173–4, and Wittgenstein 1958, §272). \n\nThe allegedly meaningless scenario is a case of\ninterpersonal (or intersubjective) spectrum inversion: Invert\nis spectrally inverted with respect to another person, Nonvert. But\nthere is another sort of inversion scenario, in which a single person’s\nqualia are inverted with respect to her qualia at an earlier time. As\nShoemaker notes (1982, 327), a case of intrapersonal (or\nintrasubjective) spectrum inversion appears to have been first\ndiscussed by Wittgenstein: \n\nAlthough Wittgenstein seems to have thought that a behaviorally\nundetectable interpersonal spectrum inversion scenario is not possible\n(arguably for verificationist reasons), Shoemaker claims that once the\npossibility of a Wittgensteinian intrapersonal inversion is\ngranted, there is an inexorable slide to the possibility of a\nbehaviorally undetectable interpersonal scenario: \n\nWe can think of this sort of argument as proceeding in four steps\n(see Block 1990, Shoemaker 1996b): Step 1: this is possible: an\n“overnight” intrapersonal inversion, as in the quotation\nfrom Wittgenstein. Step 2: if (Step 1), then this is possible: an\n“overnight” inversion followed by semantic adaptation\n(applying ‘red’ to glowing coal, ‘blue’ to the\nsky, etc.), but with memory of one’s experiences before the inversion.\nThat is, one (re)learns to use color terminology like a normal person,\nwhile remembering that one’s experiences of glowing coal (etc.) used to\nbe very different. The inversion remains detectable, because one\nasserts, for example, that one’s experiences have drastically\nchanged. Step 3: if (Step 2), then this is possible: an\n“overnight” inversion followed by semantic adaptation,\nfollowed by amnesia about one’s past experiences, with the result that\none’s pre- and post- inversion behavioral dispositions are the same. At\nthis step, one’s behavior is just as it would have been if one had\nsimply been stricken with amnesia, with no prior inversion. Step 4: if (Step 3), then this is possible: a\n“from birth” behaviorally undetectable\ninterpersonal inversion scenario. \n\nSimilar arguments starting from a Wittgensteinian intrapersonal\nscenario can be given for the other kinds of interpersonal inversion\nhypotheses discussed in section 3 below. \n\nOne might think that at least step 4 is unproblematic. However,\naccording to the “Frege-Schlick view” (Shoemaker 1982,\n339), interpersonal comparisons of qualia (unlike\nintrapersonal comparisons) do not make sense. The\nFrege-Schlick view could be supported on verificationist grounds; for\na more interesting line of defense, see Stalnaker 1999, 2006, and\nShoemaker 2006b and Block 2007, 103–7, for discussion. Since it makes\nperfect sense (and indeed is often true) to say that tomatoes look red\nto most people, a proponent of the Frege-Schlick view must deny, for\nexample, that \\(Q_{R}\\) is the property of being\nan experience of something’s looking red (see section 1 above and\nStalnaker 1999, 225). \n\nAsymmetries in color space pose problems for step 3 of the previous\nargument. But—especially for those with verificationist\nsympathies—step 3 is problematic even if these concerns are\nwaived. Why be so sure that the “total adaptation”\n(semantic adaptation plus amnesia) doesn’t reinvert the qualia? After\nall, if you imagine being the subject yourself, after the period of\namnesia you have no sense that anything is amiss—so perhaps\nnothing is. Similar doubts can be raised about step 2: suppose you use\ncolor terminology exactly as you did before the step 1 \ninversion—that is, spontaneously on the basis of how things \nlook—but you seem to recall that your past experiences were radically\ndifferent. Would you be confident that you hadn’t misremembered your\npast experiences? (See Dennett 1988; 1991, Ch. 12; 1993; 1994; and Rey\n1992.) \n\nAlthough Block thinks “that these criticisms can be defeated\non their own terms” (1990, 61), his “Inverted Earth”\nscenario is designed to sidestep them. (See Block 1990, 1996a,\n 2003.)[22]\n Instead of considering an\n“overnight” inversion and the consequent confusion,\nsemantic adaptation and amnesia, your eyes are fitted with “color\ninverting lenses” and you are transported to another \nplanet—Inverted Earth. This is a place just like Earth except that\neach object has “the complementary color of [its counterpart] on\nEarth. The sky is yellow, grass is red, fire hydrants are green,\netc.” (1990, 60). The inhabitants also speak Color Inverted\nEnglish (‘red’ means green, ‘blue’\nmeans yellow, etc.). The right hand part of figure 4 above\ndisplays a photograph of fruits taken on Inverted Earth with an\nordinary Earthly camera. (Despite the yellow sky, the illumination on\nInverted Earth is the same as it is on Earth. Note that achromatic\ncolors are not inverted—on Inverted Earth snow is white and\ncoal is\n black.)[23]\n Because of the inverting lenses—and \nignoring complications such as those mentioned in subsection \n2.3.1—when you arrive on Inverted Earth you notice no visible change.\nYour experience when you look at an arrangement of fruits on Inverted\nEarth is phenomenologically the same as your previous experience of the\ncounterpart arrangement on Earth (see the left hand part of figure 4),\nand conversation with the locals proceeds just as smoothly as it did\nback on Earth. This scenario is therefore the converse of typical\ninverted spectrum scenarios: instead of keeping the environment fixed\nand varying the internal constitution of the subject, Inverted Earth\nvaries the environment and (due to the inverting lenses) keeps the\nsubject’s internal constitution fixed. Block uses Inverted Earth in an\nargument against functionalism and representationalism (see subsections\n3.1 and 3.2\n below).[24] \n\nThe qualia inversion scenarios discussed so far are merely\nhypothetical—more cautiously, we do not know whether any of\nthem\n obtain.[25]\n There are, however, “shifted”\nqualia scenarios that actually obtain. And, in fact, many of\nthe philosophical arguments that appeal to the possibility of an\ninversion scenario can make do instead by appealing to the actual\nshifted qualia scenario, hence avoiding potentially controversial\nclaims about possibility. \n\nThe shifted qualia scenario that is usually discussed \nconcerns—unsurprisingly—color vision. There is a substantial\namount of variation between people classified as having\n“normal” color vision by standard tests, due to differences\nin the lens of the eye and photoreceptor pigments, among other factors.\nIn one experiment, introduced into the philosophical literature by\nHardin (1993, 79–80), Hurvich et al. (1968) found that the apparent\nlocation of unique green for spectral lights among 50 subjects varied\nfrom 490 to\n 520nm.[26]\n This is a large range: 15nm either side of\nunique green looks distinctly bluish or yellowish. For example, when\nSmith looks at the third patch in figure 7 (in isolation), his\nexperience might have the quale that Jones’s experience has when she\nlooks at the fourth patch in Figure 7, keeping the viewing\ncircumstances fixed. And when Smith looks at the fourth patch, his\nexperience might have the quale that Jones’s experience has when she\nlooks at the fifth patch. Thus—at least over a small\nrange of hues—Jones’s and Smith’s color qualia are\n“shifted” with respect to each other. Accordingly, this\nsort of scenario can be described as a case of “shifted spectra”\n(Block 1999). (NB: here we are assuming that the Frege-Schlick view\nmentioned in subsection 2.3.2 is incorrect.) Figure 7:\nfive patches: yellowish-green to bluish-green \n\nNotice that if a behaviorally undetectable scenario is wanted, an\nactual case of shifted spectra will not fit the bill. \n\nInversion scenarios—in particular, spectrum \ninversion—turn up in a wide range of philosophical arguments, which we\nare now in a position to examine. \n\nBehaviorism in the philosophy of mind is the view that the\nmental is nothing over and above behavior (including dispositions to\nbehave). Any version of behaviorism implies that the mental supervenes\non behavior. That is: necessarily, two creatures who are behaviorally\nalike are also mentally alike. Likewise, any version of\nfunctionalism or physicalism implies that the mental\nsupervenes on, respectively, functional organization and physical\nmakeup. For the purposes of this subsection, it is not necessary to\nget into the details of these theories. However, two points should be\nnoted. First, it should not be assumed that either behavior,\nfunctional organization, or physical makeup is an intrinsic \nmatter—the relevant sorts of behavioral, functional, and physical\nproperties may be extrinsic.\n In other words,\nperfect duplicates may differ in behavioral, functional, or physical\n respects.[27]\n Second, as these theories are usually\nunderstood, difference in behavioral respects implies difference in\nfunctional respects, which in turn implies difference in physical\nrespects; none of the converse implications\n holds.[28]\n So the three\nsupervenience theses just mentioned are related as follows: the\nbehaviorist supervenience thesis implies the functionalist thesis,\nwhich in turn implies the physicalist thesis. \n\nIf some behaviorally undetectable inverted spectrum hypothesis is\ncorrect, then there could be a pair of creatures who are behaviorally\nalike but mentally different: Invert and Nonvert are in different\nmental states when they each look at a tomato, and are behaviorally\nalike. Hence, if the inverted spectrum hypothesis is correct,\nbehaviorism is false. This gives us an argument against\nbehaviorism: \nSince P1a implies that the mental does not supervene on\nbehavior: \n\nSince behaviorism is not a popular position these days, this\napplication of an inverted qualia scenario is perhaps not so\ninteresting. And given the complications discussed in subsection 2.3.1,\nthere is even room for a behaviorist to resist. However, of\nconsiderably more interest are similar arguments against functionalism\n(and physicalism). Block and Fodor (1972), who invented the terminology\nof ‘inverted qualia’, were the first to formulate an\ninverted spectrum argument against functionalism, specifically Turing\nmachine functionalism as defended in Putnam\n 1967.[30]\n Ignoring the details\nof particular functionalisms, the argument is exactly parallel to the\none against behaviorism. (Similar remarks go for the inverted spectrum\nargument against physicalism.) According to functionalism, mental\nstates are functional states: states defined by their causal role with\nrespect to inputs, outputs, and other states. So, according to\nfunctionalism, necessarily, two creatures who are functionally alike\nare also mentally alike. In order to complete the argument, an\nappropriate inverted spectrum hypothesis must be established, where\nInvert and Nonvert are functional duplicates. \n\nThe anti-functionalist analogue of argument Aa is: \n\nSince P1b implies that the mental does not supervene on functional\norganization: \n\nThe possibility of a behaviorally undetectable inversion scenario\n(P1a) can be motivated by appeal to the sorts of considerations\ndiscussed in 2.3.1 above. However, in order to refute functionalism a\nstronger inversion hypothesis (P1b) is needed. As Block and Fodor point\nout, functionalism allows us to deny that “two organisms\nare in the same psychological state whenever their behaviors and/or\nbehavioral dispositions are identical” (1972, 86), hence avoiding\nthe stock objections to behaviorism. The functionalist, then, has no\nproblem with behaviorally undetectable inversions. But why should she\nconcede the possibility of a functionally undetectable\ninversion? The question can be made more pointed by observing that (a)\nno one has ever articulated a detailed functionalist theory of any\nmental state, and (b) any realistic version of such a theory would be\nextremely\n complicated.[31]\n In favor of the possibility of a\nfunctionally undetectable inversion, Block and Fodor offer its\n“conceptual coherence”: \n\nBlock and Fodor’s apparent move from the “conceptual\ncoherence” of the inversion scenario to its possibility can be\nquestioned. Even though one cannot know a priori that not-p (that is, p\nis conceptually coherent), p may yet be impossible. For example, one\ncannot know a priori that gold does not have the atomic number 79, but\nit is a necessary truth that gold has this atomic number. (This sort of\nseparation between conceptual coherence and possibility is not\nuncontroversial, but is commonly\n accepted.[32]) \n\nIn any case, there are other conceptually coherent scenarios that are\nconsiderably more straightforward than an inverted spectrum scenario,\nfor example a scenario containing a conscious subject and a functional\nduplicate who is not conscious at all (a “zombie”, in the\nphilosophical sense). So if the move from conceptual coherence to\npossibility is in fact legitimate, functionalism may be refuted by a\nsimpler argument that does not have an inversion hypothesis as a\npremise. (Shoemaker is a notable dissenter on this point; he holds\nthat while inverted spectrum scenarios are conceptually coherent,\nzombie scenarios are not. See Shoemaker 1975a, 1981, 1991.) \n\nA defender of the utility of an inversion scenario in an argument\nagainst functionalism might reply that the scenario’s possibility does\nnot merely rest on its conceptual coherence. In addition—this\nreply continues—there is a positive “Cartesian\nintuition” that such an inversion scenario is possible (a\n“clear and distinct idea” of the scenario, perhaps), and\nthis is prima facie evidence that it \\(is\\) possible. \n\nHowever, Cartesian intuition, just like conceptual coherence, is not\na very discriminating weapon, tending to spread possibility over a wide\nlandscape (cf. Tye 2003, section 4). Cartesian intuition also tends to\ncertify the possibility of scenarios containing zombies, thinking\nrocks, entirely disembodied minds (not even embodied in ectoplasm), and\nso forth—all impossibilities, according to the\nfunctionalist. So, as with conceptual coherence, any inverted spectrum\nargument against functionalism that relies on Cartesian intuitions can\nbe converted into an equally plausible and simpler argument that makes\nno mention of the inverted spectrum. \n\nThere is one other defense of the utility of inversion scenarios in\nanti-functionalist arguments, namely that some of them are\nbiologically possible—and hence not as far fetched as\nscenarios containing zombies or thinking rocks. If this is right, then\nspectrum inversion would be of special significance, since we have a\nfirmer grip on possibilities that are closer to home. \n\nHere is it is helpful to examine Block’s Inverted Earth argument\nagainst functionalism, which at a superficial glance might not seem to\nstray beyond the constraints of Earthly biology. As we saw in\nsubsection 2.3.3, the Inverted Earth scenario is designed to avoid\ncertain objections to the usual argument from intrapersonal inversion\nhypotheses to interpersonal inversion hypotheses. How is the scenario\nturned into an argument against functionalism? \n\nThe brand of functionalism (about qualia) that Block sets out to\nrefute is this: \n\nBlock then tries to establish that after a suitable period of time\non Inverted Earth, your beliefs and judgments about the colors of\nthings would be correct: like the locals, you would believe\nthat fire hydrants are green, the sky is yellow, and so on: \n\n(We can also add that you know that you are on Inverted Earth, and\nmake an effort to speak the local language; see Block 1996a, 42;\n2003.) \n\nThis step of the argument appeals to externalism about\nmental content (Putnam 1975, Burge 1979), specifically some sort of\ncausal covariational theory (see the entry\n externalism about mental content).\nPutting the basic idea crudely: after a while on Inverted Earth certain\nof your inner states that on Earth were reliably caused by the presence\nof red things and thereby represented redness will instead be reliably\ncaused by the presence of green things, and thereby will come to\nrepresent greenness. \n\nThis gives us an apparent counterexample against the “long\narm” functionalist theory. On Inverted Earth your experiences\nhave the functional role that the functionalist theory says is\nnecessary and sufficient for possessing\n\\(Q_{R}\\): they are “caused by red things in the\nright circumstances, and used in thought about red things and action\nwith respect to red things rightly”. But on Inverted Earth your\nexperiences with this functional role have\n\\(Q_{G}\\), not (or not always)\n\\(Q_{R}\\). \n\nIf we insist that the Inverted Earth scenario is constrained by\nactual biology, can it still be maintained that your experiences caused\nby red things on Inverted Earth have the\n\\(Q_{R}\\)-role? That is not clear, even if we\ngrant Block’s claim about the “shift in intentional\ncontents” without a corresponding change in qualia. The problem\nis twofold. First, because of asymmetries in color space and additional\ncomplications (see footnote 23),\n to say nothing of the details of the\n“inverting lenses”, your total functional organization\nwould certainly change in various respects after traveling to a\nbiologically possible Inverted Earth. Second, Block’s description of\nthe long-arm functional theory is highly schematic. It may be that a\nsuitably sophisticated and developed form of this theory would not have\nthe consequence that, on a biologically possible Inverted Earth, your\nexperiences caused by red things have the\n\\(Q_{R}\\)-role. Similar points go for an argument\nagainst functionalism using a traditional inverted spectrum\nscenario. \n\nUnsurprisingly, Block does not rest very much—if \nany—weight on the biological possibility of the Inverted Earth\nscenario: \n\nThis response concedes that the Inverted Earth argument against\nfunctionalism may need to appeal to more-or-less outlandish\npossibilities. And if it does, then since other possibilities not\ninvolving inversions, and arguably no more outlandish, will do just as\nwell, it is doubtful that Inverted Earth-type scenarios have an\nessential role to play in arguments against\n functionalism.[34] \n\nThe anti-physicalist inverted spectrum argument is: \nSince P1c implies that the mental does not supervene on physical\nmakeup: \n\nAlthough there is some controversy about just how science-fictional\nanti-functionalist inversion scenarios need to be,\nanti-physicalist inversion scenarios are usually supposed to\nbe very remote from actuality, and their possibility is hotly disputed.\nAlmost uncontroversially: if an inverted spectrum argument against\nphysicalism works at all, then a simple zombie scenario will equally\nserve the\n purpose.[35] \n\nIt is widely held that perceptual experiences represent the\nperceiver’s environment as being a certain way. For example, the\nexperience of someone with normal color vision looking at figure 1\nrepresents (inter alia) her environment as containing a crimson,\nvermilion, and turquoise square. In the terminology of Chalmers 2004\n(slightly adapted), a representational property is a property\nof a mental state/event that specifies (perhaps only in part) the\nstate/event’s representational content. For example, the property of\nbeing a visual experience that represents that there is a crimson\nsquare before one is a representational property (for a taxonomy of\nrepresentational properties, see Chalmers 2004, section 2). The basic\nidea of representationalism or intentionalism is that\nqualia are representational properties, or at least supervene on\nrepresentational properties. One advantage of representationalism is\nthat it appears to reduce “phenomenal consciousness” (Block\n1995) to a certain kind of intentionality. Since the problem of\nproviding a naturalistic account of intentionality is often thought to\nbe tractable, representationalism brings the possibility of a\nnaturalistic account of consciousness (see, e.g., Dretske 1995, Lycan\n1996, Tye 2000, and Speaks 2015).[36] \n\nSpectrum inversion scenarios help to focus the dispute between\nrepresentationalists and their critics. (Actual cases of shifted\nspectra can also serve: see Block 1999.) Any version of\nrepresentationalism is committed to the following thesis. Consider a\ncase of red-green spectrum inversion, and imagine Invert and Nonvert\nare both looking at the red peppers depicted in figure 6, against a\nneutral background. Nonvert’s experience has\n\\(Q_{R}\\), while Invert’s experience has\n\\(Q_{G}\\). Because the two experiences have\ndifferent qualia, any version of representationalism implies that, if\nthis scenario is possible, the two experiences differ in\nrepresentational content. Hence, if the foregoing scenario can be\nfilled out so that (a) the two experiences have the same\ncontent and (b) the scenario is possible, then representationalism is\nrefuted. \n\nHow can these two desiderata be satisfied? Fortunately for the\nanti-representationalist—or phenomenist (Block \n2003)—the usual ways of trying to secure (a) do not require Invert\nand Nonvert to be behavioral duplicates (or, for that matter,\nfunctional duplicates). The anti-representationalist can therefore\ndismiss concerns that a behaviorally undetectable inversion scenario is\nimpossible. \n\nThe description of the anti-representationalist scenario is\ntypically completed with the following three features. First, Invert is\nable to use her color vision to reidentify objects, distinguish objects\nfrom their backgrounds, etc., with more-or-less the facility of\nNonvert. In Locke’s phrase, Invert “would be able as regularly to\ndistinguish Things for [her] Use by those Appearances”. Second,\nInvert has been spectrally inverted from birth (or at least for a long\nperiod of time). Third, Nonvert and Invert belong to the same\nlinguistic community: in particular, they use color vocabulary in the\nsame way, applying ‘red’ to tomatoes, ‘yellow’\nto bananas, and so forth. \n\nAssume that this scenario is possible (for an argument that it isn’t,\nsee Sundström 2002 and Gibbons 2005; for a reply see Littlejohn\n2009). The three features just mentioned are intended to support the\nview that this scenario is one in which, when Invert and Nonvert both\nlook at the fruits depicted in figure 6, their experiences have\nthe same representational properties. In particular (glossing\nover a complication to be discussed in subsection 3.3 below), the\nbanana looks yellow to both Invert and Nonvert, the\nstrawberries look red to both, and so on. So, assuming that\nbananas are yellow, strawberries are red, etc., neither Invert nor\nNonvert is suffering from some global color illusion. If this inverted\nspectrum hypothesis is correct, then qualia do not supervene on\nrepresentational properties, and therefore representationalism is\nfalse. \n\n(Here is one way of putting the Inverted Earth version of this\nargument (see subsections 2.3.3 and 3.1). After first arriving on\nInverted Earth, your word ‘red’ means red, and to\nyou the green peppers on Inverted Earth look red. But after a period of\nacclimatization, you come to speak the language of the locals, and your\nexperiences come to represent correctly the colors of things—green \npeppers on Inverted Earth look green. Now compare your present\nexperience of a green pepper on Inverted Earth with your previous\nexperience of peppers of exactly that shade back on Earth. Same\ncontent, but different qualia. Alternatively, the\nanti-representationalist argument can proceed by exhibiting an example\nof the converse: same qualia, but different content—see Block\n1990, 64–7.) \n\nThe three features of the anti-representationalist scenario can\nmotivate the conclusion that Invert is not systematically misperceiving\nthe colors of things as follows. First, because Invert’s color vision\nis as useful as Nonvert’s for discriminating and identifying objects,\nsurely it would be arbitrary to suppose that Invert’s color vision, but\nnot Nonvert’s, is the source of pervasive illusions. Second, because\nNonvert has been inverted since birth, a complicated system of causal\nconnections between the colors of objects in her environment and states\nof her visual system has been in place for a long period. In\nparticular, there is a reliable causal connection between the presence\nof a red object before Invert’s eyes and a certain neural event\noccurring in Invert; this sort of causal connection is plausibly\nsufficient to bestow the property of representing redness on this type\nof neural event. Third, because Invert and Nonvert belong to the same\nlinguistic community, Invert’s word ‘red’ means\nred. So when Invert says (as she does), ‘Strawberries\nlook red to me’, she means that strawberries look red to\nher. So, if strawberries do not look red to her, Invert is\nsystematically in error about how things look, and this result is not\n credible.[37] \n\nNaturally, each of these reasons for thinking that Invert is not\nmisperceiving the colors of objects can be questioned. Against the\nfirst, one might dispute the claim that it would be arbitrary to\nconvict only Invert of error—after all, for all that’s been\nsaid, Nonvert and Invert might differ functionally, which is presumably\na relevant difference. Against the second, there are well-known\nproblems for the “causal covariational” account of mental\ncontent that it assumes (see, e.g., Fodor 1992, Ch. 3). Finally,\nagainst the third, it may be argued that the consequence that Invert is\nmistaken about the content of her experience is not unacceptable (Tye\n2002,\n 451).[38] \n\nIt will be useful to set out the anti-representationalist argument\nmore carefully. Assume as a suppressed premise that the inverted\nspectrum scenario just described is possible, and suppose that Invert\nand Nonvert are both looking at a ripe tomato in good light: Hence: Hence, from C1 and P3: \n\nSome of the dialectic surrounding P1 has been described. In the\nfollowing three subsections, other ways of resisting the argument will\nbe discussed. \n\nIf Argument B is sound, tomatoes look red to both Invert and\nNonvert, although the corresponding qualia are different. This is why\nspectrum inversion was not described in subsection 2.1 as a case where\ntomatoes look green to Invert (and look red to\nNonvert). If spectrum inversion is explained in these terms, the\nthought experiment is quite unsuitable for anti-representationalist\npurposes. \n\nAccording to the (orthodox) representationalist, an experience has\n\\(Q_{B}\\), say, just in case it is an experience\nthat represents blue. According to the phenomenist who endorses\nArgument B, an experience has \\(Q_{B}\\) just in\ncase it has a certain non-representational property. Let us\nstipulate that ‘\\(B\\)’ refers to this non-representational property,\nif such a thing exists. Then the two views may be put as follows: \nPhenomenism\n\\(Q_{B} = B\\) (a certain nonrepresentational\nproperty). \nOrthodox representationalism\n\\(Q_{B}\\) = property of visually representing\nblue (i.e., being an experience of something’s looking blue). \n\nThe sense-datum theory is usually taken to be a form of phenomenism;\nit will be treated as such\n here.[39]\n According to the sense-datum theorist, sense-data that are associated\nwith experiences of seeing the sky, lapis lazuli, cobalt glass, etc.,\nhave a distinctive property; the traditional sense-datum theorist took\nthis property to be the color blue (see, e.g., Moore 1953, 30, n.2),\nbut let us speak more neutrally and call it ‘blue\\('\\)’\n(Peacocke 1983, Ch. 1). Then, according to the sense-datum theorist,\nthe phenomenist equation can be spelled out more informatively\nthus: Sense-data theory\n\\(Q_{B} = B\\) = being a sensing of a\nblue\\('\\) sense-datum. \n\nOrthodox phenomenists (for instance Block and Levine) have\nno truck with sense-data, and typically leave the phenomenist equation\nunadorned. However, the sense-datum theorist can offer the following\nconsideration in her favor. \n\nImagine two experiences: first, an experience (call it\n‘\\(e_{1}\\)’) of a blue triangle next to a red\nsquare; second, an experience \\((e_{2})\\) of\na red triangle next to a blue square. \\(e_{1}\\) has color\nqualia \\(Q_{B}\\) and\n\\(Q_{R}\\), and also “spatial qualia”,\nwhich we can label ‘\\(Q_{Tr}\\)’ and\n‘\\(Q_{Sq}\\)’. The reference of these\nfour bits of qualia terminology\n(‘\\(Q_{B}\\)’,\n‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’,\n‘\\(Q_{Tr}\\)’, and\n‘\\(Q_{Sq}\\)’) has been fixed by, respectively,\nexperiences of blue objects, experiences of red objects, experiences of\ntriangles, and experiences of squares. \\(e_{2}\\), of\ncourse, also has \\(Q_{B},\nQ_{R}, Q_{Tr}\\), and\n\\(Q_{Sq}\\). Yet \\(e_{1}\\) and\n\\(e_{2}\\) differ phenomenologically, and therefore differ\nin qualia. So more qualia terminology is required: in particular, a\nquale name whose reference is fixed by experiences of blue triangles\nand red squares, and another name whose reference is fixed by\nexperiences of red triangles and blue squares. In a useful notation,\nthe first quale name is\n‘\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x) \\amp By \\amp Tr(y)}\\)’,\n and the second is\n‘\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Tr(x) \\amp By \\amp Sq(y)}\\)’.\n Obviously further qualia names with ever-more complicated subscripts will be\nneeded. \n\nNow notice that there are many entailment relations between\nqualia-statements—for example, ‘\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)’\nentails ‘\\(e\\) has \\(Q_{Rx}\\)’,\nand ‘\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Tr(x) \\amp By \\amp Sq(y)}\\)’\n entails ‘\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(y)}\\)’,\nand so on. The orthodox representationalist and the sense-datum\ntheorist have simple accounts of these entailments in terms of the\nstructure of the objects of experiences (apparent\nstructure, for the representationalist; actual structure, for\nthe sense-datum theorist). Assuming representationalism:\n‘\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)’\n(equivalently, ‘\\(e\\) is an experience of something’s\nlooking red and square’) clearly entails ‘\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx}\\)’ (equivalently, ‘e is an\nexperience of something’s looking red’). Assuming the sense-datum\ntheory: ‘\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx \\amp Sq(x)}\\)’\n(equivalently, ‘\\(e\\) is a sensing of a red and square\nsense-datum’) clearly entails ‘\\(e\\) has\n\\(Q_{Rx}\\)’ (equivalently,\n‘\\(e\\) is a sensing of a red sense-datum’). The\northodox phenomenist cannot give a similar explanation of these\nentailments, and it is not clear whether she is entitled to them at\n all.[40] \n\nReturn to the anti-representationalist argument of the previous\nsubsection: Hence: Hence, from C1 and P3: \n\nRepresentationalists usually resist P1. But there are other options.\nAccording to Shoemaker, the flaw in the argument is not P1, but rather\nP3. In addition to representing colors, Shoemaker thinks that visual\nexperiences represent other (“colorlike”) properties that\nwe do not have words for in English, and which he calls appearance\n properties.[41]\n On this view, both Invert and Nonvert’s\nexperiences represent the tomato as red. However, Invert’s\nexperience also represents the tomato as having a certain salient\nappearance property (call it\n‘\\(AP_{G}\\)’), while Nonvert’s\nexperience represents the tomato as having a certain salient appearance\nproperty \\((AP_{R})\\). It is this\nrepresentational difference between Invert and Nonvert that accounts\nfor the phenomenological difference between their experiences. One may,\nthen, view Shoemaker’s main argument for appearance properties as\nproceeding from P1, P2, and representationalism (i.e., not-C2), to the\nconclusion that P3 is false. \n\nWhat are the appearance properties \\(AP_{G}\\)\nand \\(AP_{R}\\)? Since Shoemaker thinks that it\nis implausible that Invert is systematically misperceiving the colors,\nit is not surprising that he also thinks that neither Nonvert nor\nInvert is systematically misperceiving the appearance properties. The\ntomato, then, has both \\(AP_{G}\\) and\n\\(AP_{R}\\). In Shoemaker 1994b,\n\\(AP_{R}\\) is said to be (where\n\\(Q_{R}\\) “is the quale that characterizes\n[Nonvert’s] experience of red things”) the property of\n“currently producing [a \\(Q_{R}\\)]\nexperience in someone related to it in a certain way, namely someone\nviewing it under normal lighting conditions” (254), and\nsimilarly for \\(AP_{G}\\) (see also Shoemaker\n1994a). This secures the result that the tomato has\n\\(AP_{R}\\) when Nonvert is looking at it; as\nShoemaker notes, it implies that the tomato lacks\n\\(AP_{R}\\) when it is not being perceived. This\naccount of appearance properties has been substantially revised and\ndeveloped in Shoemaker’s later work. According to Shoemaker 2002,\nappearance properties include dispositions to produce certain\nexperiences in certain perceivers (a suggestion that was considered\nbut rejected in Shoemaker 1994a, b). Shoemaker 2006a revises the\naccount further; for discussion, see Egan 2006 and Speaks 2015, ch. 22. \n\nThau (2002, Ch. 5) holds a similar view, but there are some\nimportant differences. First, Thau’s argument does not turn on the need\nto secure spectrum inversion without misrepresentation, and instead\ndeploys an adaptation of Jackson’s (1982) thought experiment concerning\nblack-and-white Mary. (See the entry on\n qualia: the knowledge argument.)\n Second, because Thau is not concerned to\nensure that neither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the tomato, he\ndoes not try to argue that the tomato has both\n\\(AP_{G}\\) and \\(AP_{R}\\),\nleaving the question unexamined. Third, Thau’s argument for appearance\nproperties commits him to the view that they cannot be named (222–5);\nShoemaker is not so committed. Finally, Thau does not think, unlike\nShoemaker, that colors are visually represented (211). According to\nThau, beliefs about the colors of things are based on experiences that\nrepresent objects as having appearance properties. These beliefs are\njustified, Thau argues, because there is a correlation between an\nobject’s having color \\(C\\) and its looking to have\nAP\\(_{C}\\) (235–6). \n\nAn illustration of “Frege’s puzzle” is this. It is\napparently possible to believe that Michael Caine is a Cockney, while\nnot believing that Maurice Micklewhite is a Cockney. But how can this\nbe, since Michael Caine and Maurice Micklewhite are the same\nindividual? \n\nAccording to many philosophers, appearances are not misleading, and\nthe two beliefs really are different: specifically, they represent the\nvery same individual, the beloved star of Alfie, in different\nways, or under different modes of presentation. On this view, the\npropositional content of a belief is a Fregean Thought, with modes of\npresentation as constituents—as opposed to a structured\nRussellian proposition, with objects and properties as\n constituents.[42]\n Put differently but connectedly, the\nexample shows that the names ‘Michael Caine’ and\n‘Maurice Micklewhite’ have different Fregean\nsenses—their semantic values cannot simply be their\nreferents. \n\nA similar issue arises in the philosophy of perception (see, e.g.,\nBoghossian and Velleman 1991, Peacocke 2001, Thau 2002). When one looks\nat a cucumber, does the propositional content of one’s experience have\na constituent that is a “mode of presentation” of greenness\n(a neo-Fregean view) or does it instead simply contain the property\ngreenness itself? Using the familiar ordered pair notation for\npropositional content (see, e.g., Thau 2002, 83), and ignoring issues\nabout whether the cucumber itself is associated with a mode of\npresentation, the dispute may be put as follows. On the neo-Fregean\nview, the content of one’s experience of the cucumber is \\(\\langle\\)the\ncucumber, \\(\\mathrm{MOP_{greenness}} \\rangle\\); on the neo-Russellian view, the\ncontent of one’s experiences is \\(\\langle\\)the cucumber, greenness\\(\\rangle\\). \n\nRecall the third premise of argument B (see the previous two\nsubsections): \n\nAs explained in subsection 3.3, one may resist P3 by claiming that\ncolor experience represents appearance properties. That\namounts to a defense of representationalism by introducing a\ndistinction “at the level of reference”. However, P3 may\nalso be denied by introducing a distinction “at the level of\nsense”. On this view, the difference between Invert and Nonvert\nis like the difference—as the Fregean has it—between\nIan, who believes that Michael Caine is a Cockney, and Nan, who\nbelieves that Maurice Micklewhite is a Cockney. On this Fregean view of\nthe content of perception, the difference between Invert’s and\nNonvert’s experiences is that they represent the very same property,\nnamely redness, in different ways, or under different modes of\npresentation. \n\nThau 2002 argues against modes of presentation (and also points out\nthe close connections between the inverted spectrum and Frege’s\npuzzle). Chalmers 2004 and Block 2007 defend a Fregean view. \n\nWe are not quite finished with Argument B: Hence: Hence, from C1 and P3: \n\nSo far, reasons to reject P1 and P3 have been discussed. But one\nmight also question the step from P1 and P2 to C1. As an analogy,\nsuppose that Hare is on a train, looking at a tomato in his lunchbox,\nand that Tortoise is on the platform, looking at the tomato as the\ntrain speeds by. Both Hare and Tortoise have normal vision, in\nparticular, normal visual motion perception. Consider the following\nargument. Hence: \n\nSince the tomato is moving relative to Tortoise, and is not\nmoving relative to Hare, if P2* is true, it must not be taken\nto mean that the tomato is moving relative to Hare. Assume, then, that\nP2* is given the following true interpretation: the tomato is moving\nrelative to Tortoise. However, Hare does not have to perceive that the\ntomato is moving relative to Tortoise in order to perceive (correctly)\nthe tomato’s motion—perceiving it as not moving\nrelative to himself will also suffice. Hence, Hare’s and Tortoise’s\nexperiences can both be veridical, despite representing the tomato’s\nmotion differently, which is to say that Argument B* is invalid. \n\nOne might diagnose a similar mistake in Argument B, and thus endorse\nrelativism about color. According to relativism the tomato is\nnot red simpliciter: rather, it is red relative to Nonvert\n(not green relative to Nonvert), and green relative to Invert (not red\nrelative to Invert). In other words, the tomato is simultaneously\nred-for-Nonvert and green-for-Invert. Since, on this\nview, the tomato looks red-for-Nonvert to Nonvert, and red-for-Invert\nto Invert, both their experiences are veridical, despite representing\nthe tomato differently. \n\nWhat is this property of being red-for-Nonvert? The usual answer is\nsomething along the lines of the account of appearance properties in\nShoemaker 2002: something is red-for-Nonvert iff it is disposed to\ncause experiences with \\(R\\) in perceivers of Nonvert’s kind. And\nthis, of course, is essentially the “secondary quality”\naccount of color that many find in Locke. Sometimes relativism is\ncombined with representationalism (McGinn 1983, Tye 1994), but it\narguably fits more naturally with phenomenism (McLaughlin 2003, Cohen\n2004). \n\nShoemaker did not block Argument B in this straightforward fashion\nbecause he finds relativism implausible. As he puts it in a review of\nMcGinn 1983: \n\nLike the argument for appearance properties, the argument for\nrelativism can be made by appeal to shifted spectra (see, in\nparticular, Cohen 2004). Averill 1992 argues for a version of\nrelativism using physically possible intrapersonal shifted spectra\nscenarios, involving a slight change in the eye, or in the\n atmosphere.[43] \n\nThe “inverted spectrum” quotation from Locke in\nsubsection 2.2 above continues: \n\nIt is regrettable that Locke did not trouble his Reader, because it\nis not at all clear what reasons may be offered. Malebranche was of the contrary opinion:  \n\nLet \\(p\\) be the claim that when others look at ripe tomatoes, their\nexperiences have \\(Q_{R}\\). Let \\(S\\) be a\nspectrum inversion scenario with the following simple feature: when\nothers look at ripe tomatoes, their experiences have\n\\(Q_{G}\\), not \\(Q_{R}\\).\n(So \\(p\\) and \\(S\\) are incompatible.) Consider the following\nskeptical argument: Therefore: \n\nAlthough philosophers have generally not been impressed by similar\narguments for skepticism about the external world, there is little\nconsensus on the status of arguments along the above lines. For\nexample, Block writes: “I claim we simply do not know whether\nspectrum inversion obtains or not” (1990, 57). Argument C is less\nthreatening than some other skeptical arguments because, even if sound,\ngeneralizations of it to skepticism about other kinds of mental states\nare implausible. For example, a parallel argument against one’s\nknowledge of other’s beliefs would have a dubious first premise. \n\nP1 will be denied by an orthodox representationalist. Setting a\ncontroversial skepticism about testimony aside, presumably one can know\non the basis of testimony that tomatoes look red to many people. (See\nShoemaker 1982, 334.) So, since orthodox representationalism equates\n\\(Q_{R}\\) with the property of being an\nexperience of something’s looking red, one may know on the basis of\ntestimony that when others look at tomatoes, their experiences have\n\\(Q_{R}\\). \n\nSome philosophers think that the fact that others are biologically\nsimilar to oneself is an important piece of evidence for their mental\nsimilarity (see, e.g., Hill 1991, Ch. 9), and P2 might be denied on\nthese grounds (see, e.g., Papineau 2002, 132). For more discussion, see\nBlock\n 2002.[44] \n\nMany philosophers think there is an “explanatory gap”\n(Levine 1983, 2001) between physical facts and facts about conscious\nexperience. On this view, even if consciousness is a physical\nphenomenon, it cannot be given a physical explanation. Inverted\nspectrum scenarios often play a role in arguments for the gap: \n\nThe argument for the gap suggested by Levine 1983 can be set out as\nfollows: Hence: \n\nNotice that Argument D does not have as a premise a spectrum\ninversion hypothesis—that a certain spectrum inversion\nscenario is possible. All the argument requires is that the\nspectrum inversion scenario is imaginable. Indeed, since\nLevine is a physicalist, he thinks that this scenario is not\npossible. \n\nWhat is the intended interpretation of ‘imagine’ in P1\nand P2? (In the literature ‘conceive’ is used\ninterchangeably.) The usual answer (Levine 2001, Ch. 2) is this:\n\\(p\\) is imaginable iff not-\\(p\\) is not a priori.\nOn this interpretation, P1 amounts to this: it is a priori\nthat if the explanans holds, so does the explanandum; that is, that the\nexplanans a priori entails the explanandum. This can be\nmotivated by appeal to the “deductive-nomological” model of\nexplanation (see Hempel 1965, and the entry on\n scientific explanation);\n this\nmodel is controversial, and in fact Levine rejects it, but he argues\nthat there is a broader motivation: \n\nOne might resist Argument D by denying P2 (for some ammunition, see\nHardin 1987; 1993, 134–42; for a reply see Levine 1991; see also Hardin\n1991). A much more common response is to deny P1 (Block and Stalnaker\n1999; for a reply see Chalmers and Jackson 2001). \n\nOne exegetical complication is that Levine himself now denies P1,\nwhile continuing to maintain the existence of the explanatory gap on\nthe basis of an argument related to Argument D, although somewhat more\ncomplicated (2001, Ch. 3). And in any case, just like the inverted\nspectrum argument against behaviorism, functionalism and physicalism\n(see subsection 3.1 above), inverted spectrum scenarios are not playing\nan essential role in the case for the gap, and indeed Levine 2001 leans\nmore heavily on “absent qualia” scenarios: “The\nconceivability of zombies…is the principal manifestation of the\nexplanatory gap” (79). \n\nThe introduction of ‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’,\n‘\\(Q_{G}\\)’, and so forth, at the\nstart of this article might have occasioned some suspicion. Assume\nthat spectrum inversion does not occur, and consider a\ncounterfactual situation in which, as Block puts it,\n“spectrum inversion is rife” (1990, 55). Suppose\nthat philosophers in this counterfactual situation introduced qualia\nterminology in the way it was introduced in section 1. If their qualia\nterminology is meaningless, then it is hard to see why our terminology\nis better off—we use\n‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’ just as it is used in\nthe counterfactual situation. If, on the other hand, their qualia\nterminology is meaningful, then presumably\n‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’, as they use it, refers\nto something other than a quale. (Since spectrum inversion is rife,\ntheir use of ‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’ is not\nassociated with any particular quale.) Again, given the overlap in\nuse, why suppose that our word\n‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’ is any different? Either\nway: ‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’ does not refer to a\nquale. There is a threat, then, that qualia cannot be named in a\npublic language—that they are ineffable (cf. Dennett\n1988, 228–9). Indeed, that seems to be Block’s opinion: “if an\ninverted spectrum is possible, then experiential contents that can be\nexpressed in public language (for example, looking red) are\nnot qualitative contents, but rather intentional contents”\n(1990, 55; see also Block 2007, 73–4). (“Qualitative\ncontents” are qualia that are not representational properties:\nsee subsection 3.2.) \n\nFrege held a version of the ineffability view. One of his theses in\nThe Foundations of Arithmetic is that arithmetic is\n“objective”, which he explains as follows: \n\nThis is an inverted spatial qualia scenario. According to Frege, the\ninversion would not show up in the semantics of words: both Nonvert and\nInvert use the word ‘point’ with the same meaning, despite\nassociating very different “intuitions” with it. In the\nnext paragraph, Frege makes a similar claim about color\nterminology. \n\nAlthough Frege seems to concede that sometimes a color word\n“signifies our subjective sensation”, the general drift of\nthe argument points to a much stronger conclusion, that our subjective\nsensations are simply not “expressible in words”. A related\nexample is Wittgenstein’s “beetle in the box”: \n\n(Notice that Wittgenstein imagines “absent beetles”,\ncorresponding to an “absent qualia” scenario.) \n\nHere is one argument suggested by these passages. \n\nSuppose that Humbert is semantically (and otherwise) competent, has\nnormal color vision, is a member of our linguistic community, and uses\nqualia terminology (‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’,\n‘\\(Q_{G}\\)’, etc.), as introduced in\nsection 1 above. Further suppose that spectrum inversion does not in\nfact occur. \n\nNow consider a counterfactual spectrum inversion scenario in which\n“spectrum inversion is rife”. Invert has been spectrally\ninverted with respect to some other members of his community since\nbirth, all of whom use color terminology in much the same way. Nonvert\nis spectrally inverted with respect to his neighbor Invert, but—comparing \nthis scenario with the actual scenario described in the\nprevious paragraph—is not spectrally inverted with respect to\nHumbert. Further suppose that Nonvert and his neighbor Invert use\nqualia terminology as introduced in section 1 above. Assume as a\nsuppressed premise that this scenario is possible. \n\nLet ‘\\(X\\)’ abbreviate the definite description ‘the quale\ndistinctive of Humbert’s experiences of red things’ (by hypothesis,\nthis definite description is coextensive with ‘the quale\ndistinctive of Nonvert’s experiences of red things in the\ncounterfactual inversion scenario’). Hence: Hence, from C1 and P3: \n\nSince the rest of us are in no better position than Humbert, C2\nleads inevitably to the conclusion that\n‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’,\n‘\\(Q_{G}\\)’, etc., as introduced in\nthe manner of section 1, do not in fact refer to qualia. One might view\nArgument E as showing that certain salient aspects of our mental lives\nare linguistically elusive (as Frege apparently did); alternatively,\none might follow Wittgenstein and conclude that the very idea of qualia\nrests on a conceptual confusion. \n\nIn fact, C2 does not imply that qualia are completely\nunspeakable—it does not, that is, imply that \\(no\\)\nexpression refers to \\(X\\) (i.e., the quale distinctive of\nHumbert’s experiences of red things). Indeed, if the sentence to the\nright of ‘C2’ succeeds in expressing a truth, then\n‘\\(X\\)’ (and so ‘the quale distinctive of Humbert’s\nexperiences of red things’) refers to \\(X\\). If Argument E\nis as far as we can go, then the moral seems to be that particular\nqualia can only be picked out ‘by description’—they\ncannot be referred to by semantically simple expressions, such as\n‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’ and\n ‘\\(Q_{G}\\)’.[45]\n But—bearing\nin mind Wittgenstein’s remark that “the box might even be\nempty”—one might attempt to extend the argument to show\nthat even the word ‘qualia’ itself is devoid of\nsignificance. \n\nHowever, Argument E is not obviously sound. The premise in need of\nmost defense is\n P3.[46]\n When qualia terminology was introduced in\nsection 1, it was tacitly presupposed that spectrum inversion was\nnot rife. In Invert’s and Nonvert’s community, that\npresupposition is false, and so it should not be surprising if the\nattempt to introduce ‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’ into\ntheir public language fails. But in Humbert’s community the\npresupposition is true; so why wouldn’t\n‘\\(Q_{R}\\)’, as the members of this\ncommunity use it, successfully refer to the quale distinctive of\nHumbert’s experiences of red\n things?[47] \n\nExternalism about beliefs and other propositional\nattitudes, and also about perceptual experiences, was alluded to in\nsubsections 3.1 and 3.2. Premise P1 of our much-scrutinized \nArgument B—‘Neither Invert nor Nonvert is misperceiving the color of\nthe tomato’—was supported, in part, by a particular\nexternalist theory of perceptual content. According to the externalist,\nsome representational properties of subjects, like the property of\nbelieving that water is wet, or that arthritis is painful, or the\nproperty of having an experience of something’s looking red, are\nextrinsic: these properties are not necessarily shared between perfect\nduplicates (or even less-than-perfect duplicates with perfectly\nduplicated\n brains).[48]\n Smith may believe that water is wet, yet\ntwin-Smith on Putnam’s Twin Earth does not believe that water is wet.\nThe tomato may look red to Jones, yet not to twin-Jones on Inverted\nEarth. (In an alternative scenario, twin-Jones has just been created by\nhappenstance in a swamp: see Davidson 1987.) \n\nIt is also widely held that qualia are intrinsic (see,\ne.g., Block 1990, 68). (More exactly: properties of subjects like\nhaving an experience with quale Q, are intrinsic.) If Jones is\nhaving an experience with quale \\(Q\\), then there is no possible\nworld w in which twin-Jones is not having an experience with quale\n\\(Q\\). \n\nFinally, representationalism (see subsection 3.2 above) is—if \nnot as popular as the previous two claims—at least defended\nby many contemporary philosophers. \n\nNow consider the following argument (cf. Byrne and Hilbert 1997b,\n271–2): \n\nConsider the representational property of having an experience of\nsomething’s looking red. By P1, this property is extrinsic, and so\nthere is a possible world \\(w\\) in which a subject \\(x\\) has\nthis property and \\(y\\)—a perfect duplicate of \n\\(x\\)—lacks it. Solely for illustration, we may take \\(w\\) to be\na possible world in which Nonvert and his twin Invert are both looking\nat a tomato in a white bowl (but perhaps the twins are on different\nplanets). Nonvert is having an experience of something’s looking red,\nand Invert is not; more specifically: (i) the tomato looks red, and\nnothing looks green, to Nonvert; (ii) the tomato looks green, and\nnothing looks red, to Invert. By P2, Nonvert’s experience has\n\\(Q_{R}\\) (and not\n\\(Q_{G})\\); conversely for Invert. So Nonvert and\nInvert are twins whose experiences do not share qualia; in other words,\nqualia are not intrinsic. By P3, contradiction. Hence: \n\nNotice that Argument F does not assume the possibility of a scenario\nin which duplicate perceivers are spectrally inverted. This spectrum\ninversion hypothesis is ruled out by P3, and P3 is of course consistent\nwith Argument F’s conclusion. \n\nArgument F shows that either content-externalism, representationalism,\nor qualia-internalism should be rejected. For a discussion of this\nproblem, see Egan and John 2003 (Other Internet Resources); Dretske\n(1995, Ch. 5) argues against P3 (see also Tye 1995, 150–5; 2002,\nCh. 6; Lycan 1996, 115–7; and Noë 2005, Ch. 7); P1 is\ndenied in Chalmers 2004. \n\nRelatedly, McGinn (1989, 58–94) runs a “spatially Inverted\nEarth” argument against what he calls ‘strong\nexternalism’ about perceptual content (a particular kind of\nexternalism); Davies (1997) adapts McGinn’s example to argue for\nexternalism about perceptual content. Both sides of the\n“externalism/internalism” debate as encapsulated in\nArgument F presuppose that it is possible to keep a perceiver’s\ninternal constitution fixed while greatly varying the environment; this\nassumption is critically examined in Hurley 1998, Chs. 7, 8, and Myin\n2001.","contact.mail":"abyrne@mit.edu","contact.domain":"mit.edu"}]
